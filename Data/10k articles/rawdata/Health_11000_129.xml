'''Alexander Monteith of Auldcathie''' (1660-1713) was an Edinburgh [[surgeon]], who in his three terms as Deacon (President) of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Incorporation of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], presided over some of the most important changes in its history. These included obtaining the rights to perform anatomical [[dissection]] on the bodies of prisoners dying in jail, the granting of a [[Royal Charter]] by [[William III of England|William]] and [[Mary II of England|Mary]] in 1695, and the construction of  the original [[Surgeons' Hall]], the first permanent home of the Edinburgh Surgeons.

==Surgical apprentice==
Monteith was the son of James Monteith of Auldcathie in what is now [[West Lothian]].&lt;ref&gt;List of Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Edinburgh, George Robb, 1874. https://archive.org/stream/b21465812/b21465812_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; He was apprenticed to [[William Borthwick (surgeon)|William Borthwick]] of Pilmuir.&lt;ref&gt;List of Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Edinburgh, George Robb, 1874. https://archive.org/stream/b21465812/b21465812_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt; As Borthwick had studied at two of the great European medical centres, [[Padua]] and [[Leiden University|Leyden]], it was natural that he should encourage his apprentice to do the same and Monteith spent several years studying on the Continent.
He was admitted as a Freeman (Fellow) of the Incorporation of Surgeons on 22 December 1691. &lt;ref&gt;List of Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Edinburgh, George Robb, 1874. https://archive.org/stream/b21465812/b21465812_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in establishing anatomy dissection==
On 24 October 1694 Monteith petitioned the Town Council 'for a gift' to obtain anatomical subjects for dissection.He requested 'the bodies of those who die in the Correction House [prison] and foundlings who die upon the breast...' &lt;ref&gt;Wood, Marguerite (ed) Extracts from the records of the Burgh of Edinburgh. Edinburgh: Printed for the Scottish Burgh Records Society.1869, p204 https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015068454936;view=1up;seq=204&lt;/ref&gt; In return he offered to treat the poor of the town 'gratis' and this was accepted by the Council. He had the powerful support in this venture of [[Archibald Pitcairne]], who had served as Professor of Physic at Leyden from 1692. Pitcairne wrote to a friend in 1694 'I doe propose, if it be granted, to make better emprovements, in anatomie than have been made at Leyden these thirttie years...'&lt;ref&gt;Archibald Pitcairne to Robert Gray, 24 October 1694, ''The Best of Our Owne: Letters of Archibald Pitcairne 1652–1713'' Edinburgh, 1979 p19&lt;/ref&gt; The Incorporation, concerned that Monteith might 'monopolise the whole subjects of anatomical dissection', made a similar request for bodies for dissection the following week. &lt;ref&gt;Wood, Marguerite (ed) Extracts from the records of the Burgh of Edinburgh. Edinburgh: Printed for the Scottish Burgh Records Society.1869. p206 https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015068454936;view=1up;seq=206&lt;/ref&gt; The Council agreed on condition that the Incorporation build an anatomy theatre for public anatomy dissections.
The anatomy theatre was therefore the main reason for the building of Surgeons' Hall which  opened in 1697. The first public dissection took place in 1703  when Monteith  dissected the abdominal cavity on the third day of dissection.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell,C H.  The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh: Historical notes from 1505 to 1905. Edinburgh, Oliver and Boyd, 1926 p194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deacon of the Incorporation of Surgeons==
He was elected [[List of Presidents of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh|Deacon of the Incorporation]] in 1695 and again in 1699 but on the latter occasion was deposed. This was almost certainly because he was a Jacobite and the Incorporation had a strong Presbyterian tradition - all of the surgeons had signed the [[National Covenant]] in 1638.&lt;ref&gt;Gairdner, John. ''Historical Sketch of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh''. Edinburgh, Sutherland and Knox, 1860&lt;/ref&gt; Like his friend Archibald Pitcairne, also an enthusiastic Jacobite, he seems to have had the strength of character to overcome this setback and he was again elected Deacon in 1701.&lt;ref&gt;Mannings, David. SIR JOHN MEDINA'S PORTRAITS OF THE SURGEONS OF EDINBURGH.Medical History, 1979, 23: 176-190.  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1082434/pdf/medhist00099-0054.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Monteith rented three rooms in the basement of the new Surgeons' Hall as a 'laboratory', in which he could give instruction in chemistry to the apothecaries.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell,C H.  The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh: Historical notes from 1505 to 1905. Edinburgh, Oliver and Boyd, 1926 p52&lt;/ref&gt; His course in 'chymie' [chemistry], lasting six weeks was advertised in the Edinburgh Gazette in 1699.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh Gazette No 26; 25 May 1699&lt;/ref&gt; He seems to have used this for additional purposes because in 1700 he asked the Scottish Parliament in a petition, "That the art discovered by him to draw spirits from malt equal in goodness to true French brandy maybe declared a manufactory with the same privileges and immunities as are granted to other manufactories".&lt;ref&gt;The Records of the Parliaments of Scotland to 1707, K.M. Brown et al eds (St Andrews, 2007-2017), 1700/10/81. Date accessed: 2 October 2017.http://www.rps.ac.uk/mss/1700/10/81&lt;/ref&gt; This was effectively asking for a patent to distil his own brand of malt whisky.

==Charter from William and Mary==
Monteith was therefore a Deacon at an important time in the history of the Incorporation. In 1694 the Incorporation was granted a new charter by [[King william iii|King William]] and [[Queen Mary II|Queen Mary.]] This confirmed that only certified members of the Incorporation had the  rights to practise surgery and pharmacy in south-east Scotland. The Charter also confirmed the responsibility of the Incorporation for the teaching of anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell,C H.  The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh: Historical notes from 1505 to 1905. Edinburgh, Oliver and Boyd, 1926 p121&lt;/ref&gt;

==Property==
Monteith owned the estate of Todshaugh, later Foxhall, in West Lothian.&lt;ref&gt;Creswell,C H.  The Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh: Historical notes from 1505 to 1905. Edinburgh, Oliver and Boyd, 1926 p194&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Gairdner gives his date of death as 23 December 1713.&lt;ref&gt;List of Fellows of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh. Edinburgh, George Robb, 1874. https://archive.org/stream/b21465812/b21465812_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;  This date is confirmed on his grave in [[Greyfriars Kirkyard]] in central [[Edinburgh]].&lt;ref&gt;Collection of Epitaphs and Monumental Inscriptions: Chiefly in Scotland&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Anne Anastasi''' (December 19, 1908 – May 4, 2001) was an American [[psychology|psychologist]] best known for her pioneering development of [[psychometrics]]. Her seminal work, ''Psychological Testing'', remains a classic text in which she drew attention to the individual being tested and therefore to the responsibilities of the testers. She called for them to go beyond test scores, to search the assessed individuals’ history to help them to better understand their own results and themselves.

Known as the “test guru”, Anastasi focused on what she believed to be the appropriate use of psychometric tests. As stated in an obituary, “She made major conceptual contributions to the understanding of the manner in which psychological development is influenced by environmental and experiential factors. Her writings have provided incisive commentary on test construction and the proper application of psychological tests.”.&lt;ref&gt;Reznikoff, M &amp; Procidano, M (2001): "Anne Anastasi (1908-2001)", ''American Psychologist'', ''56'':816-817&lt;/ref&gt; According to Anastasi, such tests only revealed what the test-taker knows at the time; they did not explain test scores. In addition, any psychometric measurement must take into account that aptitude is context-dependent. Anastasi stressed the importance of the role of the tester to correctly select, conduct, and evaluate tests.

She was president of the [[American Psychological Association]] in 1972, the third ever woman to be elected. In 1987, she was awarded the [[National Medal of Science]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nsf.gov/od/nms/recip_details.cfm?recip_id=17 National Science Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Problems addressed==
Anastasi's (1983) essay “What Do Intelligence Tests Measure?”&lt;ref&gt;Anastasi, A. (A) (1983): "What do intelligence tests measure?" In S.B. Anderson &amp; J.S. Hemlick (Eds.), ''On Educational Testing: Intelligence, Performance Standards, Test Anxiety, and Latent Traits'', (pp. 5-28). San Francisco: CA: Jossey-Bass, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt; aimed to correct misinterpretations regarding the understanding and use of [[aptitude]] and personality tests.  Anastasi pointed out that the “testing boom” of the 1920s caused the term [[IQ]] to be adopted and misused by the general public. According to Anastasi, the misappropriation of the term created connotations that intelligence is heritable, stable throughout one's lifespan, and resistant to change.&lt;ref name="Anastasi"&gt;Anastasi, A. (A).&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, Anastasi emphasized that psychometric scores convey an individual's present status of what he or she knows. She cautioned against interpreting such tests as serving a strong predictive function, as scores only indicated to what degree a person acquired the knowledge and skills for the criterion of a given test. They evaluate for what is in high demand within a specific context; what an individual can achieve in the future depends not only on his or her present intellectual status as determined by the test, but also on subsequent experiences.&lt;ref name="Anastasi" /&gt; Therefore, Anastasi advocated against psychometric tests definitively labelling a person, as they assess for specific types of knowledge and do not account for how intelligence can change over time.

Important to Anastasi was an understanding of the cultural frames of reference within which a test is developed. She stated that “No intelligence test can be culture free, because human intelligence is not culture free”.&lt;ref name="Anastasi" /&gt; Therefore, according to Anastasi, the first step in developing an intelligence test within a given culture was formulating a [[task analysis]] in order to determine how well individuals gain knowledge valued within that culture.

==Methods==
Anastasi mostly applied existing methods to individual and group ability testing, as well as [[self-report inventories]] and measuring interests and attitudes. She followed the methodological principles of [[psychometrics#Key concepts|norms]], [[Reliability (statistics)|reliability]], [[Validity (statistics)|validity]], and item analysis. The essay “Psychological Testing: Basic Concepts and Common Misconceptions,”&lt;ref&gt;Anastasi, A. (B) (1985): "Psychological testing: basic concepts and common misconceptions" In A.M. Rogers &amp; C.J. Sheirer (Eds.), ''G. Stanley Hall Lecture Series'', ''5'' (pp. 87-120). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association.&lt;/ref&gt; encapsulates Anastasi's methodological positions.  Anastasi stressed that, in order to evaluate any psychometric test, the tester must be knowledgeable of the main features of the tests, particularly as they apply to norms, validity, and reliability. Her approach to [[standard scores]] and [[standard deviation]] was one in which she believed that understanding statistical concepts was essential to understanding the meaning of statistical computation.&lt;ref name="Anastasi_a"&gt;Anastasi, A. (B).&lt;/ref&gt;

In regards to [[criterion-referenced tests]], Anastasi diverged from [[educational psychologist]] [[Robert Glaser]], who first introduced the concept in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;Glaser, R. (1963): "Instrumental technology and the measurement of learning outcomes", ''American Psychologist'', ''18'': 519-522.&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of approaching such tests as fundamentally different from [[norm-referenced tests]], Anastasi maintained that the two could be combined to give a more comprehensive evaluation of the individual's test performance. An example is the Stanford Diagnostic Test in reading and mathematics, which assesses specific subject mastery by combining both interpretations.&lt;ref name="Anastasi_a" /&gt;

Anastasi recognized that there are many types of test reliability. However, when dealing with standardized testing, much of the variance in reliability can be minimized by controlling such conditions as the testing environment, rapport, instructions, and time limits.&lt;ref name="Anastasi_a" /&gt;

In contrast with the belief that there are three kinds of validity - [[content validity]], [[criterion validity]], and [[construct validity]] - Anastasi espoused to the then-growing belief of the mid-1980s that many more procedures could be used to build validity into a test. Defining the constructs to be assessed initiates the validation process. It culminates with “validating and cross-validating various scores through statistical analyses against external, real-life criteria”.&lt;ref name="Anastasi_a" /&gt;

==Difference between aptitude and achievement test ==
In ''Psychological Testing: Basic Concepts and Common Misconceptions,'' Anastasi clarified differences between types of tests. Two differences between [[aptitude]] tests and [[achievement tests]] are test use and the degree of experiential specificity forming the foundation of the tests’ construction. Achievement tests are used to assess current status; [[aptitude tests]] can predict future performance as defined by their specific criteria. Experiential specificity is narrowly defined for achievement tests, such as  [[SAT Subject Tests]]. In contrast, the [[Stanford-Binet Intelligence Scales]] aptitude tests are based on broad knowledge of American culture beginning in the twentieth century.&lt;ref name="Anastasi_a" /&gt;

==Theoretical stance==
Anastasi's theoretical framework that ability or intelligence change with experience and that their cultural context dictates their parameters informed her methodological approach to psychometric testing. Tests should be selected and used while bearing in mind their contextual appropriateness and limitations. She emphasized that tests serve specific functions in Western society, such as school/occupational placement or to assess for mental disabilities.

==Criticism==
The 1955 first edition of Psychological Testing was criticized for attributing test results only to individual differences, instead of recognizing that “‘occasional differences’ are also measured by means of tests".&lt;ref&gt;Guilford, J. (1955): "Review of ''Psychological Testing'', ''Psychological Bulletin'', ''52''(1), 97-98.&lt;/ref&gt; In the latest edition of the book, Anastasi and her co-author Susana Urbina suggested that more accurate results can be obtained by combining information from several fairly homogeneous tests. Each one would cover a single trait, or different aspect of the criterion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Anastasi |first1=Anne |last2=Urbina |first2=Susana |authorlink1=Anne Anastasi |authorlink2=Susana Urbina |title=Psychological Testing |edition=Seventh |location=Upper Saddle River (NJ) |publisher=[[Prentice Hall]] |isbn=978-0-02-303085-7 |year=1997 |laysummary=http://www.pearsonhighered.com/educator/product/Psychological-Testing-7E/9780023030857.page |laydate=28 July 2010 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{verify source|date=November 2010}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2792">An '''asynclitic birth''' or '''asynclitism''' refers to the [[Pelvimetry|position]] of a [[fetus]] in the [[uterus]] such that the head of the baby is presenting first and is tilted to the shoulder,&lt;ref name="spinningbabies"&gt;[http://www.spinningbabies.com/baby-positions/all-positions/asynclitism Asynclitism], spinningbabies.com&lt;/ref&gt; causing the fetal head to no longer be in line with the [[birth canal]] (vagina).&lt;ref name=Healthline&gt;[http://www.healthline.com/yodocontent/pregnancy/assisted-delivery-types-forceps.html Healthline &gt; Types of Forceps Used in Delivery] February 2006. Reviewer: Douglas Levine, Gynecology Service/Department of Surgery, [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]], New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt; Asynclitic presentation is significantly different from a [[shoulder presentation]], in which the shoulder is presenting first. Many babies enter the pelvis in an asynclitic presentation, and most asynclitism corrects spontaneously as part of the normal birthing process. Persistence of asynclitism can cause problems with [[dystocia]], and has often been associated with [[cesarean]] birth. However, with a skilled [[midwife]] or [[obstetrician]] a complication-free [[vaginal birth]] can sometimes, though not necessarily, be achieved through movement and positioning of the birthing woman,&lt;ref name="Simkin 2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Simkin|first=Penny|title=The Labor Progress Handbook: Early Interventions to Prevent and Treat Dystocia (3rd ed.)|year=2011|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Labor_Progress_Handbook.html?id=HHodimrcuA0C}}&lt;/ref&gt; and patience and extra time to allow for movement of the baby through the pelvis and moulding of the skull during the birthing process if this is safe in the circumstances.&lt;ref name="Simkin 2011"/&gt;

Where intervention is the safest option in asynclitic birth, [[Kielland forceps]] are preferable [[obstetric forceps]] used in asynclitic births, for example by their sliding mechanism, availing for more appropriate adjustment of the blades.&lt;ref name="Healthline"/&gt;

'''Birth weight''' is the [[body weight]] of a [[infant|baby]] at its [[childbirth|birth]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://oasis.state.ga.us/oasis/help/mch.html Definitions] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402214755/http://oasis.state.ga.us/oasis/help/mch.html |date=April 2, 2012 }} from Georgia Department of Public Health.

There have been numerous studies that have attempted, with varying degrees of success, to show links between birth weight and later-life conditions, including [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[obesity]], [[tobacco smoking]], and [[intelligence]]. Low birth weight is associated with [[neonatal infection]] and [[infant mortality]].

==Abnormalities==
*A [[low birth weight]] can be caused either by a [[preterm birth]] (low gestational age at birth) or of the infant being [[small for gestational age]] (slow prenatal growth rate), or a combination of both.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.marchofdimes.org/complications/low-birthweight.aspx|title=Low birthweight|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A very large birth weight is usually caused by the infant having been [[large for gestational age]].

==Determinants==
[[File:Weight vs gestational Age.jpg|thumb|Relation of weight and [[gestational age]]{{where|date=September 2016}}.]]

=== Genetics ===
There are two genetic loci that have been strongly linked to birth weight, [[ADCY5]] and [[CCNL1]], as well  four that show some evidence ([[CDKAL1]], HHEX-IDE, [[GCK (gene)|GCK]], and [[TCF7L2]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Freathy|first=Rachel M|last2=Mook-Kanamori|first2=Dennis O|last3=Sovio|first3=Ulla|last4=Prokopenko|first4=Inga|last5=Timpson|first5=Nicholas J|last6=Berry|first6=Diane J|last7=Warrington|first7=Nicole M|last8=Widen|first8=Elisabeth|last9=Hottenga|first9=Jouke Jan|date=2010-04-06|title=Variants in ADCY5 and near CCNL1 are associated with fetal growth and birth weight|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/ng.567|journal=Nature Genetics|language=En|volume=42|issue=5|pages=430–435|doi=10.1038/ng.567|issn=1061-4036|pmc=2862164|pmid=20372150}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yaghootkar|first=Hanieh|last2=Freathy|first2=Rachel|date=May 2012|title=Genetic origins of low birth weight|url=|journal=Paediatrics|volume=15|issue=3|pages=258–264|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ryckman|first=Kelli K.|last2=Feenstra|first2=Bjarke|last3=Shaffer|first3=John R.|last4=Bream|first4=Elise N.A.|last5=Geller|first5=Frank|last6=Feingold|first6=Eleanor|last7=Weeks|first7=Daniel E.|last8=Gadow|first8=Enrique|last9=Cosentino|first9=Viviana|date=January 2012|title=Replication of a Genome-Wide Association Study of Birth Weight in Preterm Neonates|url=https://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0022347611007670|journal=The Journal of Pediatrics|volume=160|issue=1|pages=19–24.e4|doi=10.1016/j.jpeds.2011.07.038|issn=0022-3476|pmc=3237813|pmid=21885063}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[heritability]] of birth weight ranges from 25-40 %.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Clausson|first=Britt|last2=Lichtenstein|first2=Paul|last3=Cnattingius|first3=Sven|date=March 2000|title=Genetic influence on birthweight and gestational length determined by studies in offspring of twins|journal=BJOG: An International Journal of Obstetrics and Gynaecology|volume=107|issue=3|pages=375–381|doi=10.1111/j.1471-0528.2000.tb13234.x|issn=1470-0328}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lunde|first=A.|last2=Melve|first2=K.

[[Foetal]] genes influence how the fetus grows in [[In utero|utero]], and the maternal genes influence how the environment affects the growing fetus.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

===Maternal Health===
The [[health]] of the mother, particularly during the pregnancy. [[Intercurrent diseases in pregnancy]] are sometimes associated with decreased birth weight. For example, [[Celiac disease]] confers an [[odds ratio]] of low birth weight of approximately 1.8.&lt;ref name="TersigniCastellani2014"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tersigni C, Castellani R, de Waure C |title=Celiac disease and reproductive disorders: meta-analysis of epidemiologic associations and potential pathogenic mechanisms |journal=Human Reproduction Update |volume=20 |issue=4 |pages=582–93 |year=2014 |pmid=24619876 |doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu007|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certain medications ( high blood pressure, epilepsy, etc. )can put a mother at a higher risk for delivering a low birth weight baby.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
Giving birth to a child when you are younger than 15 or older than 35 puts you at a higher risk to have a low-birth weight baby.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="hrsa"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://mchb.hrsa.gov/chusa11/hstat/hsi/pages/201lbw.html |title=Low Birth Weight |website=Child Health USA 2011 |access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple births, where a mother has more than one child at one time,  can also  be a determinant in birth weight as  each baby is likely to be outside the AGA (appropriate for gestational age). Multiple births put children at a higher rate to have low birth weight (56.6%) compared to children born in a single birth ( 6.2%).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Low birth weight can also vary by maternal age. In 2008 the rate of low birth weight was the highest in babies born to women at an age that is younger than 15 years old which is 12.4 percent.&lt;ref name="hrsa"/&gt; Women aged 40–54 had a rate of low birth weight at 11.8 percent. The lowest rates of birth weight happened among babies to mothers that were between the ages of 25–29 years at 4.4 percent and 30–34 years at 7.6 percent.&lt;ref name="hrsa"/&gt;

=== Stress ===
[[Psychological stress|Stressful]] events have been demonstrated to produce significant effects on birth weight. Those mothers who have stressful events during [[pregnancy]], especially during the first and second trimester, are at higher risk to deliver low-birth weight babies.&lt;ref name="Hedegaard"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hedegaard|first1=Morten|last2=Henriksen|first2=Tine Brink|last3=Secher|first3=Niels Jergen|last4=Hatch|first4=Maureen C.|last5=Sabroe|first5=Svend|date=July 1996|title=Do Stressful Life Events Affect Duration of Gestation and Risk of Preterm Delivery?|journal=Epidemiology|volume=7|issue=4|pages=339–345|jstor=3702049}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhu et. al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zhu|first1=Peng|last2=Tao|first2=Fangbiao|last3=Hao|first3=Jiahu|last4=Sun|first4=Ying|last5=Jiang|first5=Xiaomin|date=July 2010|title=Prenatal life events stress: implications for preterm birth and infant birthweight|journal=American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology|volume=34|pages=1–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers furthered this study and found that maternal stressful events that occur prior to conception have a negative impact on birth weight as well, and can result in a higher risk for preterm and lower birth weight babies.&lt;ref name="Witt et. al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Witt|first1=Whitney P.|last2=Cheng|first2=Erika R.|last3=Wisk|first3=Lauren E.|last4=Litzelman|first4=Kristin|last5=Chatterjee|first5=Debanjana|last6=Mandell|first6=Kara|last7=Wakeel|first7=Fathima|date=2014|title=Maternal Stressful Life Events Prior to Conception and the Impact on Infant Birth Weight in the United States|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=104|issue=1|pages=81–89}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Khashan et. al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Khashan|first1=A.S.|last2=McNamee|first2=R.|last3=Abel|first3=K.M.|last4=Mortensen|first4=P.B.|last5=Kenny|first5=L.C.|last6=Pedersen|first6=M.G.|last7=Webb|first7=R.T.|last8=Baker|first8=P.N.|date=2009|title=Rates of preterm birth following antenatal maternal exposure to severe life events: a population-based cohort study|journal=Human Reproduction|volume=24|issue=2|pages=429–437|doi=10.1093/humanrep/den418|doi-broken-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Class et. al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Class|first1=Quetzal A.|last2=Khashan|first2=Ali S.|last3=Lichtenstein|first3=Paul|last4=Langstrom|first4=Niklas|last5=D'Onofrio|first5=Brian M.|date=2013|title=Maternal Stress and Infant Mortality: The Importance of the Preconception Period|journal=Psychological Science|volume=24|issue=7|pages=1309–1316|doi=10.1177/0956797612468010|pmid=23653129|pmc=3713176}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women who experienced abuse (physical, sexual, or emotional) during pregnancy are also at increased risk of delivering a low-birth weight baby.&lt;ref name="Murphy"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Murphy|first1=Claire C.|last2=Schei|first2=Berit|last3=Myhr|first3=Terri L.|last4=Du Mont|first4=Janice|date=May 29, 2001|title=Abuse: a risk factor for low birth weight?

One way to decrease rates of low birth weight and premature delivery is to focus on the health of women prior to conception through reproductive education, screening and counseling regarding mental health issues and stress, and access to primary care.&lt;ref name="Cheng"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Tina L.|last2=Kotelchuck|first2=Milton|last3=Guyer|first3=Bernard|date=2012|title=Preconception Women's Health and Pediatrics: An Opportunity to Address Infant Mortality and Family Health|journal=Academic Pediatrics|volume=12|issue=5|pages=357–359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Racial Stress===
Non-Hispanic Blacks have the highest infant mortality rate in the United States (11.4%, compared to the national average of 5.9%).&lt;ref name="CDC Infant Mortality"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/reproductivehealth/MaternalInfantHealth/InfantMortality.htm|title=Infant Mortality {{!}} Maternal and Infant Health {{!}} Reproductive Health {{!}} CDC|date=3 August 2018|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently,  there has been growing research supporting the idea of [[racial discrimination]] as a risk factor for low birth weight. In one study by Collins et. al, evidence suggested that African American mothers who experienced high levels of racial discrimination were at significantly higher risk of delivering a very low-birth weight baby compared to African American mothers who had not experienced racial discrimination.&lt;ref name="Collins et. al"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Collins Jr.|first1=James W.|last2=David|first2=Richard J.|last3=Handler|first3=Arden|last4=Wall|first4=Stephen|last5=Andes|first5=Steven|date=December 2004|title=Very Low Birthweight in African American Infants: The Role of Maternal Exposure to Interpersonal Racial Discrimination|journal=American Journal of Public Health|volume=94|issue=12|pages=2132–2138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Black infants (13.2%) are more likely  to have low birth weight compared to Asian and Pacific Islander (8.1%), American Indian and Alaska Native (7.6%), Non-Hispanic White (7.0%), and Hispanic Infants (7.1%).&lt;ref&gt;Child Trends Databank. (2016). ''Low and very low birthweight infants''. Available at: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.childtrends.org/?indicators=low-and-very-low-birthweight-infants&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Neonatal Care ==
Most babies admitted to the [[Neonatal intensive care unit|NICU]] are born before 37 weeks of pregnancy or have low birth weight which is less than 5.5 pounds.&lt;ref name="stanford"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/topic/default?id=the-neonatal-intensive-care-unit-nicu-90-P02389|title=The Neonatal Intensive Care Unit|website=Stanford Children Health |language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; They could also have a medical condition that requires special care. In the United States nearly half a million babies are born preterm because of this many of these babies also have low birth weights.&lt;ref name="stanford"/&gt; There are four levels of care in the neonatal care units. [[Intensive care unit|Intensive Care]], High Dependency Care, Low Dependency, and Transitional Care are the four levels:&lt;ref name="LiverpoolWhat"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.liverpoolwomens.nhs.uk/our-services/neonatal-care/what-is-neonatal-care/|title=What is neonatal care?|website=Liverpools Womens NHS Foundation Trust |language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Intensive Care: For babies with serious problems. This includes babies born three months early and have extremely low birth weight.
* High Dependency Care: For babies with less serious problem, but who still may not to be looked after or babies that are recovering from a critical illness.
* Low Dependency Care: For babies that do not need a continuous supervision.
* Transitional Care: For babies that still need medical treatment, but are well enough to be called for at their mother’s bedside.

==Influence on the first few years of life==
Children born with an abnormally low birth weight can have significant problems within the first few years of life. They may have trouble gaining weight, obtaining adequate nutrition, and supporting a strong immune system. They also have higher risks for mortality, behavior problems, and mental deficiencies.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Low birth weight babies are more likely to develop the following conditions after birth compared to normal birth weight babies:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* Breathing problems ( [[Infant respiratory distress syndrome|Infant Respiratory Distress Syndrome)]]
* Bleeding in the brain ([[Intraventricular hemorrhage|Intraventricular Hemorrage)]]
* [[Patent ductus arteriosus]] (PDA)
* [[Necrotizing enterocolitis]]
* [[Retinopathy of prematurity]]
* [[Neonatal jaundice|Jaundice]]
* Infections

That said, the effects of low birth weight on a child's first few years of life are often intertwined with other maternal, environmental, and genetic factors and most effects of low birth weight are only slightly negatively significant on a child's life when these factors are controlled for.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Datar|first=Ashlesha|last2=Jacknowitz|first2=Alison|date=2009-03-24|title=Birth Weight Effects on Children's Mental, Motor, and Physical Development: Evidence from Twins Data|journal=Maternal and Child Health Journal|language=en|volume=13|issue=6|pages=780–794|doi=10.1007/s10995-009-0461-6|issn=1092-7875|pmc=2855622|pmid=19308711}}&lt;/ref&gt; When these factors are controlled, the only significant effect low birth weight has on a child's development is physical growth in the early years and the likelihood of being underweight compared to normal birth weight babies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

==Influence on adult life==
Studies have been conducted to investigate how a person's birth weight can influence aspects of their future life. This includes theorised links with [[obesity]], [[diabetes]] and [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]].

===Obesity and Diabetes===
A baby born small or large for gestational age (either of the two extremes) is thought to have an increased risk of [[obesity]] in later life,&lt;ref name="title3 stages of childhood may predict obesity risk - Fitness - MSNBC.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msnbc.msn.com/id/8088161/ |title=3 stages of childhood may predict obesity risk - Fitness - MSNBC.com |accessdate=2007-11-28 |format= |website=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Singhal A, Wells J, Cole TJ, Fewtrell M, Lucas A |title=Programming of lean body mass: a link between birth weight, obesity, and cardiovascular disease? |journal=Am J Clin Nutr |volume=77 |issue=3 |pages=726–30 |date=1 March 2003|pmid=12600868 |url=http://www.ajcn.org/cgi/content/full/77/3/726 |doi=10.1093/ajcn/77.3.726 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was also shown that this relationship is fully explained by maternal weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Parsons TJ, Power C, Manor O |title=Fetal and early life growth and body mass index from birth to early adulthood in 1958 British cohort: longitudinal study |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |issue=7325 |pages=1331–5 |date=December 2001|pmid=11739217 |pmc=60670 |url=http://www.bmj.com/cgi/content/full/323/7325/1331 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7325.1331}}&lt;/ref&gt; Middle aged adults with low birth weight present with a higher chance of obesity and diabetes.

[[Bone density|Bone mineral density]] SDS measured by [[DEXA]] increased significantly in the GH-treated group compared to the untreated subjects, though there is much debate over whether or not SGA (small for gestational age) is significantly adverse to children to warrant inducing catch-up.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=GH Treatment Effects on Body Composition in SGA |journal=Growth, Genetics &amp; Hormones |volume=24 |issue=1 |date=May 2008 |url=http://gghjournal.com/volume24/1/ab13.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Low birth weight is linked with increase rates of obesity, [[insulin resistance]], and type 2 diabetes and it is shown that children with the low birth weights have increased [[leptin]] levels after they catch up growth during childhood.&lt;ref name="leptin"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jornayvaz|first1=Francois|last2=Vollenweider|first2=Peter|last3=Bochud|first3=Murielle|last4=Mooser|first4=Vincent|last5=Waeber|first5=Gerard|last6= Marques-Vidal|first6=Pedro|title=Low birth weight leads to obesity, diabetes and increased leptin levels in adults: The CoLaus study|journal=BMJ|volume=15|pages=73|date=May 3, 2016|doi=10.1186/s12933-016-0389-2 |pmid=27141948|pmc=4855501}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adiponection levels are positively related with birth weight and BMI in babies with an increase of risk of type 2 diabetes.&lt;ref name="leptin"/&gt; The leptin and adiponection mechanisms are still being studied when involving low birth weight.&lt;ref name="leptin"/&gt;

Some studies have shown a direct link between an increased birth weight and an increased [[intelligence quotient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Matte TD, Bresnahan M, Begg MD, Susser E |title=Influence of variation in birth weight within normal range and within sibships on IQ at age 7 years: cohort study |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |issue=7308 |pages=310–4 |date=August 2001  |pmid=11498487 |pmc=37317 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7308.310}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="titleThe Future of Children - Sub-Sections"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=256519 |title=The Future of Children - Sub-Sections |accessdate=2007-11-28 |format= |website= |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071022213938/http://futureofchildren.org/information2827/information_show.htm?doc_id=256519 &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Matte TD, Bresnahan M, Begg MD, Susser E |title=Influence of variation in birth weight within normal range and within sibships on IQ at age 7 years: cohort study |journal=BMJ |volume=323 |issue=7308 |pages=310–4 |date=August 2001  |pmid=11498487 |pmc=37317 |doi=10.1136/bmj.323.7308.310 |laysummary=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/1483134.stm |laysource=BBC News |laydate=August 9, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Increased birth weight is also linked to greater risk of developing autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Lord C |title=Fetal and sociocultural environments and autism |journal=The American Journal of Psychiatry |volume=170 |issue=4 |pages=355–8 |date=April 2013  |pmid=23545788 |doi=10.1176/appi.ajp.2013.13010078 |laysummary=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2013/05/130502081741.htm |laysource=ScienceDaily |laydate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Around the World ==
There is much variation regarding birth weight within continents, countries, and cities.  Even though over 20 million babies are born each year with low birth weight, it is hard to know the exact number as more than half of babies born in the world are not weighed at birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/low-birthweight/|title=Low birthweight - UNICEF DATA|work=UNICEF DATA|access-date=2018-11-25|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The baby’s weight is an indicator of the mother and babies health. In 2013 22 million newborns had low birth weight, around 16 percent of all babies globally.&lt;ref name="unicef"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/topic/nutrition/low-birthweight/|title=Low BirthWeight |website=UNICEF DATA|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Data on low birth weight is adjusted to account for under reporting. South Asia has the highest rate of babies not weighted at birth with 66 percent, but also have the highest low birth weight at 28 percent worldwide.&lt;ref name="unicef"/&gt; West and Central Africa and least developed countries are next with 14 percent low birth weight worldwide.&lt;ref name="unicef"/&gt;

More than 96.5% of low birth weight babies are born in developing countries around the world.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Because low birth weight babies can require more extensive care, it places a financial burden on communities.

== Prevention ==
The [[World Health Organization|World Health Organizatio]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n (WHO) recently announced an initiative to have a thirty percent reduction in low birth weight worldwide. This is public health priority, as birth weight can have short and long term effects. WHO estimates that worldwide, 15-20 % of all births each year are considered low birth weight, which is about 20 million births.&lt;ref name="WHOnutrition"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.who.int/nutrition/publications/globaltargets2025_policybrief_lbw/en/|title=Global Nutrition Targets 2025: Low birth weight policy brief|website=World Health Organization|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The start of prenatal care is very important to help prevent low birth weight and early medical problems. Going to regular doctor’s visits is very important for the health of the mother and the baby. At the visits the OB/GYN will be checking maternal nutrition and weight gain because that is linked with the baby’s weight gain. The mother having a healthy diet is essential for the baby. Maintaining good nutrition by taking folic acid which is found in fruits and vegetables is linked to premature births and low birth weight.  Alcohol, cigarettes, and drugs should also be avoided during pregnancy because they can also lead to poor growth and other complications. By seeing the doctor they are also able to monitor pre-existing medical illnesses to make sure they are under control during pregnancy. Mothers with [[Hypertension|high blood pressure]] and [[Diabetes mellitus type 2|type 2 diabetes]] are more likely to have infants with low birth weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.healthxchange.sg/women/pregnancy/low-birth-weight-babies-prevention|title=Low and Very Low Birth Weight Babies:Prevention Tips for Expectant Mothers|website=HealthXchange|language=en=GB|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; One essential action to increase normal birth weights is to have affordable ,accessible, and culturally sensitive prenatal care worldwide. This is essential not just for treating low birth weight, but also preventing it.  Other prevention efforts include: [[smoking cessation]] programs, food-distribution systems, stress reduction and social service supports.&lt;ref name="WHOnutrition" /&gt;

A '''cancer vaccine''' is a [[vaccine]], that either treats existing [[cancer]] or prevents development of a cancer. Vaccines that treat existing cancer are known as ''therapeutic'' cancer vaccines.

Some/many of the vaccines are "autologous", being prepared from samples taken from the patient, and are specific to that patient.

Some researchers claim that cancerous cells routinely arise and are destroyed by the immune system;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=2001-04-26|title=IFNgamma and lymphocytes prevent primary tumour development and shape tumour immunogenicity.|journal=Nature|volume=410|issue=6832|pages=1107–1111|doi=10.1038/35074122|pmid=11323675|vauthors=Shankaran V, Ikeda H, Bruce AT, White JM, Swanson PE, Old LJ, Schreiber RD}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that tumors form when the immune system fails to destroy them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=2004|title=The three Es of cancer immunoediting|journal=Annu. Rev. Immunol.|volume=22|issue=i|pages=329–60|doi=10.1146/annurev.immunol.22.012703.104803|pmid=15032581|vauthors=Dunn GP, Old LJ, Schreiber RD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Traditional vaccines ==
Some [[types of cancer]], such as [[cervical cancer]] and some [[Hepatocellular carcinoma|liver cancers]], are caused by viruses (oncoviruses). Traditional vaccines against those viruses, such as [[HPV vaccine]]&lt;ref name=Babu2010&gt;{{cite journal | author1 = Arvind Babu RS | author2 = Kiran Kumar K | author3 = Sridhar Reddy G | author4 = Anuradha Ch | year = 2010 | title = Cancer Vaccine : A Review | url = http://www.jofs.in/temp/JOrofacSci2377-614488_170408.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Orofacial Sciences | volume = 2 | issue = 3 | pages = 77–82 }}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[hepatitis B vaccine]], prevent those types of cancer. These vaccines are not further discussed in this article. Other cancers are to some extent caused by bacterial infections (e.g. stomach cancer and ''[[Helicobacter pylori]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vaccinenewsdaily.com/news/213394-oral-vaccine-could-fight-source-of-stomach-cancers|title=Oral vaccine could fight source of stomach cancers|publisher=Vaccine News Reports}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Traditional vaccines against cancer-causing bacteria (oncobacteria) are not further discussed in this article.

== Method ==
One approach to cancer vaccination is to separate proteins from cancer cells and immunize patients against those proteins as antigens, in the hope of stimulating the immune system to kill the cancer cells. Research on cancer vaccines is underway for treatment of breast, lung, colon, skin, kidney, prostate and other cancers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Oncology (Williston Park) |year=2007 |volume=21 |issue=11 Suppl Nurse Ed |pages=11–8 |title= Cancer vaccines: a new frontier in prevention and treatment |author= Giarelli E |pmid=18154203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another approach is to generate an immune response ''in situ'' in the patient using [[oncolytic viruses]]. This approach was used in the drug [[talimogene laherparepvec]], a version of [[herpes simplex virus]] engineered to selectively replicate in tumor tissue and to express the immune stimulatory protein [[GM-CSF]]. This enhances the anti-tumor immune response to [[tumor antigen]]s released following viral lysis and provides a patient-specific vaccine.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Amgen press release.

== Clinical trials ==
In a phase III trial of [[follicular lymphoma]] (a type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma), investigators reported that the [[BiovaxID]] (on average) prolonged remission by 44.2 months, versus 30.6 months for the control.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asco.org/ASCOv2/Meetings/Abstracts?&amp;vmview=abst_detail_view&amp;confID=65&amp;abstractID=33572 Idiotype vaccine therapy (BiovaxID) in follicular lymphoma in first complete remission: Phase III clinical trial results.] S. J. Schuster, et al. 2009 ASCO Annual Meeting, J Clin Oncol 27:18s, 2009 (suppl; abstr 2)&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 14, 2009, [[Dendreon]] Corporation announced that their Phase III clinical trial of [[sipuleucel-T]], a cancer vaccine designed to treat prostate cancer, had demonstrated an increase in survival. It received [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) approval for use in the treatment of advanced prostate cancer patients on April 29, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/CellularGeneTherapyProducts/ApprovedProducts/ucm210215.htm |date=2010-04-29 |title=Approval Letter - Provenge |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.genengnews.com/analysis-and-insight/what-comes-after-dendreon-s-provenge/77899342/ |title=What Comes After Dendreon's Provenge? |date=18 Oct 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 8, 2008, New York–based company Antigenics announced that it had received approval for the first therapeutic cancer vaccine in Russia. It is the first approval by a regulatory body of a cancer immunotherapy. The treatment, [[Oncophage]], increased recurrence-free survival by a little more than a year according to the results of a phase III clinical trial. The approval is for a subset of [[kidney cancer]] patients who are at intermediate risk for disease recurrence. It awaits approval in the US and EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-scientist.com/templates/trackable/display/blog.jsp?type=blog&amp;id=54528&amp;o_url=blog/display/54528|title=Dead|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; but will need a new trial for FDA approval.

Interim results from a phase III trial of [[talimogene laherparepvec]] in melanoma showed a significant tumour response compared to administration of GM-CSF alone.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Approved oncovaccines ==
[[Oncophage]] was approved in Russia in 2008 for [[kidney cancer]]. It is marketed by Antigenics Inc.

Sipuleucel-T, [[Provenge]], was approved by the FDA in April 2010 for metastatic [[hormone-refractory prostate cancer]]. It is marketed by [[Dendreon]] Corp.

== Abandoned research ==
[[CancerVax]] (Canvaxin), Genitope Corp (MyVax personalized immunotherapy), and FavId (Favrille Inc) are examples of cancer vaccine projects that have been terminated, due to poor phase III results.

== Desirable characteristics ==
Cancer vaccines seek to target a tumor-specific [[antigen]] and distinct from self-proteins. Selection of the appropriate [[immunologic adjuvant|adjuvant]] to activate antigen-presenting cells to stimulate immune responses, is required. [[Bacillus Calmette-Guérin]], an aluminum-based salt, and a squalene-oil-water emulsion are approved for clinical use. An effective vaccine also should seek to stimulate long term memory to prevent tumor recurrence. Some scientists claim both the [[Innate immune system|innate]] and [[adaptive immune system]]s must be activated to achieve total tumor elimination.&lt;ref name="Pejawar-Gaddy S 2008"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pejawar-Gaddy S, Finn O | year = 2008 | title = Cancer vaccines: Accomplishments and challenges | url = | journal = Critical Reviews in Oncology Hematology | volume = 67 | issue = | pages = 93–102 | doi=10.1016/j.critrevonc.2008.02.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Antigen candidates ==
[[Tumor antigen]]s have been divided into two categories: ''shared'' tumor antigens; and ''unique'' tumor antigens. Shared antigens are expressed by many tumors. Unique tumor antigens result from mutations induced through physical or chemical carcinogens; they are therefore expressed only by individual tumors.

In one approach, vaccines contain whole tumor cells, though these vaccines have been less effective in eliciting immune responses in spontaneous cancer models. Defined tumor antigens decrease the risk of autoimmunity, but because the immune response is directed to a single [[epitope]], tumors can evade destruction through antigen loss variance. A process called "epitope spreading" or "provoked immunity" may mitigate this weakness, as sometimes an immune response to a single antigen can lead to immunity against other antigens on the same tumor.&lt;ref name="Pejawar-Gaddy S 2008"/&gt;

For example, since Hsp70 plays an important role in the presentation of antigens of destroyed cells including cancer cells,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nishikawa|first=Makiya|last2=Takemoto|first2=Seiji|last3=Takakura|first3=Yoshinobu|date=2008-04-16|title=Heat shock protein derivatives for delivery of antigens to antigen presenting cells|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378517307008174|journal=International Journal of Pharmaceutics|series=Special Issue in Honor of Prof. Tsuneji Nagai|volume=354|issue=1–2|pages=23–27|doi=10.1016/j.ijpharm.2007.09.030}}&lt;/ref&gt; this protein may be used as an effective adjuvant in the development of antitumor vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Savvateeva|first=L.

== Hypothesized problems ==
A vaccine against a particular virus is relatively easy to create. The virus is foreign to the body, and therefore expresses [[antigen]]s that the [[immune system]] can recognize. Furthermore, viruses usually only provide a few viable variants. By contrast, developing vaccines for viruses that mutate constantly such as [[influenza]] or [[HIV]] has been problematic.

A tumour can have many cell types of cells, each with different cell-surface antigens. Those cells are derived from each patient and display few if any antigens that are foreign to that individual. This makes it difficult for the immune system to distinguish cancer cells from normal cells. Some scientists believe that [[renal cancer]] and [[melanoma]] are the two cancers with most evidence of spontaneous and effective immune responses, possibly because they often display antigens that are evaluated as foreign. Many attempts at developing cancer vaccines are directed against these tumors. However, Provenge's success in prostate cancer, a disease that never spontaneously regresses, suggests that cancers other than melanoma and renal cancer may be equally amenable to immune attack.

However, most vaccine clinical trials have failed or had modest according to the standard [[RECIST]] criteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15340416 | doi=10.1038/nm1100 | volume=10 | issue=9 | title=Cancer immunotherapy: moving beyond current vaccines | pmc=1435696 |date=September 2004 |vauthors=Rosenberg SA, Yang JC, Restifo NP | journal=Nat. Med. | pages=909–15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The precise reasons are unknown, but possible explanations include:

* Disease stage too advanced: bulky tumor deposits actively suppress the immune system using mechanisms such as secretion of [[cytokines]] that inhibit immune activity. The most suitable stage for a cancer vaccine is likely to be early, when the tumor volume is low, which complicates the trial process, which take upwards of five years and require many patients to reach measurable end points. One alternative is to target patients with residual disease after surgery, radiotherapy or chemotherapy that does not harm the immune system.
* Escape loss variants (that target a single [[tumor antigen]]) are likely to be less effective. Tumors are heterogeneous and antigen expression differs markedly between tumors (even in the same patient). The most effective vaccine is likely to raise an immune response against a broad range of tumor antigens to minimise the chance of the tumor mutating and becoming resistant to the therapy.
* Prior treatments may have modified tumors in ways that nullify the vaccine. (Numerous clinical trials treated patients following chemotherapy that may destroy the immune system. Patients who are immune suppressed are not good candidates for vaccines.)
* Some tumors progress rapidly and/or unpredictably, and they can outpace the immune system. Developing a mature immune response to a vaccine may require months, but some cancers (e.g. advanced pancreatic) can kill patients in less time.
* Many cancer vaccine clinical trials target patients' immune responses. Correlations typically show that the patients with the strongest immune responses lived the longest, offering evidence that the vaccine is working. An alternative explanation is that patients with the best immune responses were healthier patients with a better prognosis, and would have survived longest even without the vaccine.

== Recommendations  ==
In January 2009, a review article made recommendations for success as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johnson|first=Robert S.|last2=Walker|first2=Anthony I.|last3=Ward|first3=Stephen J.|date=2009-01-01|title=Cancer vaccines: will we ever learn?|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1586/14737140.9.1.67|journal=Expert Review of Anticancer Therapy|volume=9|issue=1|pages=67–74|doi=10.1586/14737140.9.1.67|issn=1473-7140}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Target settings with a low disease burden.
* Conduct randomized Phase II trials so that the Phase III program is sufficiently [[Statistical power|powered]].
* Do not randomize antigen plus adjuvant versus adjuvant alone. The goal is to establish clinical benefit of the immunotherapy (i.e., adjuvanted vaccine) over the standard of care. The adjuvant may have a low-level clinical effect that skews the trial, increasing the chances of a false negative.
* Base development decisions on clinical data rather than immune responses. Time-to-event end points are more valuable and clinically relevant. 
* Design regulatory into the program from inception; invest in manufacturing and product assays early.

'''Christopher Lukas''' (born  March 6, 1935) is an American writer, stage actor, television producer and director who, for the past forty-five years, has worked primarily for [[public television]]. From 1963 to 1971 he produced for [[WNET]] in [[New York City]], making over 200 hours of programming for the educational station. In 1969 he was promoted to director of programming.

==His birth, early years, and education==
Christopher "Kit" Lukas was born to Elizabeth and Edwin Lukas in [[White Plains, New York]]. His mother was an actress, and his uncle [[Paul Lukas]] was an Academy Award–winning actor. After his mother's death by suicide and his father's illness after her death, he was at the age of six enrolled in the coeducational Putney School boarding school in Vermont. He graduated with high honors from [[Swarthmore College]] and married Susan Ries in 1962. His older brother was [[J. Anthony Lukas]], [[Pulitzer Prize]]-winning journalist and writer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Conjunctivitis''', also known as '''pink eye''', is [[inflammation]] of the [[conjunctiva|outermost layer of the white part of the eye]] and the inner surface of the [[eyelid]].&lt;ref name=Peads10&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Richards A, Guzman-Cottrill JA |title=Conjunctivitis |journal=Pediatr Rev |volume=31 |issue=5 |pages=196–208 |date=May 2010 |pmid=20435711 |doi=10.1542/pir.31-5-196 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes the eye appear pink or reddish.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Pain, burning, scratchiness, or itchiness may occur.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; The affected eye may have increased tears or be "stuck shut" in the morning.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Swelling of the [[sclera|white part of the eye]] may also occur.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Itching is more common in cases due to allergies.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Conjunctivitis can affect one or both eyes.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Causes and diagnosis --&gt;
The most common infectious causes are [[viral infection|viral]] followed by [[bacterial infection|bacterial]].&lt;ref name=Az2013&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Azari|first1=AA|last2=Barney|first2=NP|title=Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment.|journal=JAMA|date=23 October 2013|volume=310|issue=16|pages=1721–9|pmid=24150468|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.280318|pmc=4049531}}&lt;/ref&gt; The viral infection may occur along with other symptoms of a [[common cold]].&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Both viral and bacterial cases are easily spread between people.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Allergies to pollen or animal hair are also a common cause.&lt;ref name=Az2013/&gt; Diagnosis is often based on signs and symptoms.&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt; Occasionally, a sample of the discharge is sent for [[microbial culture|culture]].&lt;ref name=NIH2015/&gt;

{{TOC limit|3}}

== Signs and symptoms ==
[[Red eye (medicine)|Red eye]], [[chemosis|swelling of the conjunctiva]], and [[epiphora (medical)|watering]] of the eyes are symptoms common to all forms of conjunctivitis. However, the pupils should be normally reactive, and the visual acuity normal.

Conjunctivitis is identified by irritation and redness of the conjunctiva. Except in obvious [[pyogenic]] or toxic/chemical conjunctivitis, a [[slit lamp]] (biomicroscope) is needed to confirm the diagnosis. Examination of the eyelid conjunctiva is usually more diagnostic than examination of the scleral conjunctiva.

=== Viral ===
[[File:Hemorragicconjunctivitis2.jpg|thumb|upright=2|Conjunctivitis due to a viral infection resulting in some bleeding]]
Viral conjunctivitis is often associated with an infection of the upper respiratory tract, a common cold, or a sore throat. Its symptoms include excessive watering and itching. The infection usually begins in one eye, but may spread easily to the other eye.

Viral conjunctivitis manifests as a fine, diffuse pinkness of the conjunctiva, which is easily mistaken for a [[Ciliary body|ciliary]] infection of the iris ([[iritis]]), but corroborative signs on [[microscopy]], particularly numerous [[Lymph follicle|lymphoid follicle]]s on the [[Tarsus (eyelids)|tarsal]] conjunctiva, and sometimes a [[punctate keratitis]] are seen.

=== Allergic ===
[[File:Allergicconjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|right|An eye with [[allergic conjunctivitis]] showing conjunctival edema]]

[[Allergic conjunctivitis]] is [[Allergic Inflammation|inflammation]] of the conjunctiva due to allergy.&lt;ref name="Bielory"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Bielory L, Friedlaender MH | title = Allergic conjunctivitis | journal = Immunol Allergy Clin North Am | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 43–58, vi |date=February 2008 | pmid = 18282545 | doi = 10.1016/j.iac.2007.12.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific [[allergen]]s may differ among patients. Symptoms result from the release of [[histamine]] and other active substances by [[mast cell]]s, and consist of redness (mainly due to [[vasodilation]] of the peripheral small blood vessels), swelling of the conjunctiva, itching, and increased production of tears.

=== Bacterial ===

[[File:Swollen eye with conjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|right|An eye with bacterial conjunctivitis]]
Bacterial conjunctivitis causes the rapid onset of conjunctival redness, swelling of the eyelid, and a sticky discharge.  Typically, symptoms develop first in one eye, but may spread to the other eye within 2–5 days.  Conjunctivitis due to common [[pyogenic|pus-producing]] bacteria causes marked grittiness or irritation and a stringy, opaque, greyish or yellowish [[mucopurulent discharge|discharge]] that may cause the lids to stick together, especially after sleep.  Severe crusting of the infected eye and the surrounding skin may also occur.  The gritty or scratchy feeling is sometimes localized enough that patients may insist that they have a foreign body in the eye.

Common bacteria responsible for nonacute bacterial conjunctivitis are ''[[Staphylococcus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Pink Eye (Conjunctivitis) |publisher=MedicineNet |url=http://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622062209/http://www.medicinenet.com/pink_eye/article.htm |archivedate=22 June 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Haemophilus]]'' species.

Bacteria such as ''[[Chlamydia trachomatis]]'' or ''[[Moraxella]]'' spp. can cause a nonexudative but persistent conjunctivitis without much redness.  Bacterial conjunctivitis may cause the production of membranes or pseudomembranes that cover the conjunctiva.  Pseudomembranes consist of a combination of [[inflammatory cell]]s and exudates and adhere loosely to the conjunctiva, while true membranes are more tightly adherent and cannot be easily peeled away.  Cases of bacterial conjunctivitis that involve the production of membranes or pseudomembranes are associated with ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'', β-hemolytic streptococci, and ''[[Corynebacterium diphtheriae]]''.  ''C. diphtheriae'' causes membrane formation in conjunctiva of unimmunized children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epidemiology and Prevention of Vaccine-Preventable Diseases|veditors =Hamborsky J, Kroger A, Wolfe C|first=|publisher=U.S. Dept. of Health &amp; Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|year=2015|isbn=978-0990449119|location=|pages=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical ===
Chemical eye injury may result when an [[acidic]] or [[alkali]]ne substance gets in the eye.&lt;ref name=Bet09&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Zentani A, Burslem J |title=Towards evidence based emergency medicine: best BETs from the Manchester Royal Infirmary.

Irritant or toxic conjunctivitis is primarily marked by redness. If due to a chemical splash, it is often present in only the lower conjunctival sac.  With some chemicals, above all with caustic alkalis such as [[sodium hydroxide]],  [[necrosis]] of the conjunctiva marked by a deceptively white eye due to vascular closure may occur, followed by sloughing off of the dead [[epithelium]]. A slit lamp examination is likely to show evidence of [[iritis|anterior uveitis]].

[[File:Chlamydial-conjunctivitis.jpg|thumb|right|An eye with chlamydial conjunctivitis]]
Inclusion conjunctivitis of the newborn  is a conjunctivitis that may be caused by the bacterium ''Chlamydia trachomatis'', and may lead to acute, [[purulent]] conjunctivitis.&lt;ref name=Microbiology&gt;{{cite book |author1=Fisher, Bruce |author2=Harvey, Richard P. |author3=Champe, Pamela C. |title=Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews: Microbiology (Lippincott's Illustrated Reviews Series) |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=Hagerstown MD |year= 2007 |isbn=0-7817-8215-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is usually self-healing.&lt;ref name=Microbiology/&gt;

== Causes ==
Infective conjunctivitis is most commonly caused by a virus.&lt;ref name=JAMA2013/&gt; Bacterial infections, allergies, other irritants, and dryness are also common causes. Both bacterial and viral infections are contagious, passing from person to person or spread through contaminated objects or water.

=== Viral ===
[[Adenoviruses]] are the most common cause of viral conjunctivitis ([[adenoviral keratoconjunctivitis]]).&lt;ref name=Yanoff/&gt; [[Herpetic keratoconjunctivitis]], caused by [[herpes simplex]] viruses, can be serious and requires treatment with [[aciclovir]]. Acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis is a highly contagious disease caused by one of two [[enterovirus]]es, enterovirus 70 and [[coxsackievirus]] A24. These were first identified in an outbreak in Ghana in 1969, and have spread worldwide since then, causing several epidemics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lévêque N, Huguet P, Norder H, Chomel JJ |title=[Enteroviruses responsible for acute hemorrhagic conjunctivitis] |language=French |journal=Med Mal Infect |volume=40 |issue=4 |pages=212–8 |date=April 2010 |pmid=19836177 |doi=10.1016/j.medmal.2009.09.006 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bacterial ===
The most common causes of acute bacterial conjunctivitis are ''[[Staphylococcus aureus]]'', ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.&lt;ref name=Yanoff&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yanoff|first1=Myron|last2=Duker|first2=Jay S.|title=Ophthalmology|year=2008|publisher=Mosby|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-0-323-05751-6|pages=227–236|edition=3rd|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though very rare, hyperacute cases are usually caused by ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' or ''[[Neisseria meningitidis]]''.  Chronic cases of bacterial conjunctivitis are those lasting longer than 3 weeks, and are typically caused by ''S. aureus'', ''[[Morax-Axenfeld diplobacilli|Moraxella lacunata]]'', or Gram-negative enteric flora.

=== Allergic ===
Conjunctivitis may also be caused by allergens such as pollen, perfumes, cosmetics, smoke,&lt;ref name="FD"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/allergic-conjunctivitis/causes-risk-factors.html |title=Allergic Conjunctivitis |publisher=familydoctor.org |accessdate=18 September 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906031026/http://familydoctor.org/familydoctor/en/diseases-conditions/allergic-conjunctivitis/causes-risk-factors.html |archivedate=6 September 2015 |df=dmy-all }}{{Unreliable medical source|date=September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; dust mites, [[Balsam of Peru]],&lt;ref name="google1"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eReGG6UtxbcC&amp;pg=PT413 |title=The Daily Telegraph: Complete Guide to Allergies |author=Pamela Brooks – |publisher= |date=25 October 2012 |accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; or eye drops.&lt;ref name="MedNews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/157692.php |title=What Is Allergic Conjunctivitis?

=== Other ===
Conjunctivitis is part of the triad of [[reactive arthritis]], which is thought to be caused by [[autoimmune]] cross-reactivity following certain bacterial infections. Reactive arthritis is highly associated with [[HLA-B27]]. Conjunctivitis is associated with the autoimmune disease [[relapsing polychondritis]].&lt;ref name="Puechal 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Puéchal|first1=X|last2=Terrier|first2=B|last3=Mouthon|first3=L|last4=Costedoat-Chalumeau|first4=N|last5=Guillevin|first5=L|last6=Le Jeunne|first6=C|title=Relapsing polychondritis.|journal=Joint, bone, spine : revue du rhumatisme|date=March 2014|volume=81|issue=2|pages=118–24|pmid=24556284|doi=10.1016/j.jbspin.2014.01.001|url=http://www.hal.inserm.fr/inserm-00951203}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cantarini 2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cantarini|first1=Luca|last2=Vitale|first2=Antonio|last3=Brizi|first3=Maria Giuseppina|last4=Caso|first4=Francesco|last5=Frediani|first5=Bruno|last6=Punzi|first6=Leonardo|last7=Galeazzi|first7=Mauro|last8=Rigante|first8=Donato|title=Diagnosis and classification of relapsing polychondritis|journal=Journal of Autoimmunity|volume=48–49|year=2014|pages=53–59|issn=0896-8411|doi=10.1016/j.jaut.2014.01.026|pmid=24461536}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diagnosis ==
Cultures are not often taken or needed as most cases resolve either with time or typical antibiotics.  If bacterial conjunctivitis is suspected, but no response to topical antibiotics is seen, swabs for bacterial culture should be taken and tested. Viral culture may be appropriate in epidemic case clusters.

A [[patch test]] is used to identify the causative allergen in allergic conjunctivitis.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FtlsAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Conjunctivitis+%22patch+test%22&amp;dq=Conjunctivitis+%22patch+test%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=oY9UU932MMPjsAT5j4KYCg&amp;ved=0CF8Q6AEwBg |title=Eye and skin disease |author1=Mark J.

Although conjunctival scrapes for [[Cytopathology|cytology]] can be useful in detecting chlamydial and [[fungal]] infections, allergy, and [[dysplasia]], they are rarely done because of the cost and the general dearth of laboratory staff experienced in handling ocular specimens.  Conjunctival incisional biopsy is occasionally done when [[granulomatous]] diseases (''e.g.'', [[sarcoidosis]]) or dysplasia are suspected.

=== Classification ===
Conjunctivitis may be classified either by cause or by extent of the inflamed area.

==== Causes ====
* Allergy
* Bacteria
* Viruses
* Chemicals
* Autoimmune

Neonatal conjunctivitis is often grouped separately from bacterial conjunctivitis because it is caused by different bacteria than the more common cases of bacterial conjunctivitis.&lt;!-- Source? --&gt;

==== By extent of involvement ====
Blepharoconjunctivitis is the dual combination of conjunctivitis with [[blepharitis]] (inflammation of the eyelids).

[[Keratoconjunctivitis]] is the combination of conjunctivitis and [[keratitis]] ([[cornea]]l inflammation).&lt;!-- Two good bullet points, but try to find a source for them. --&gt;

Blepharokeratoconjunctivitis is the combination of conjunctivitis with blepharitis and keratitis. It is clinically defined by changes of the lid margin, meibomian gland dysfunction, redness of the eye, conjunctival chemosis and inflammation of the cornea.&lt;ref name="OGallagher"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors = O'Gallagher M, Banteka M, Bunce C, Larkin F, Tuft S, Dahlmann-Noor A |title= Systemic treatment for blepharokeratoconjunctivitis in children |journal = Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume= |issue = 5|pages = CD011750 |date = 2016 |pmid=27236587 |doi= 10.1002/14651858.CD011750.pub2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differential diagnosis ===

Some more serious conditions can present with a red eye, such as infectious keratitis, angle-closure glaucoma, or iritis. These conditions require the urgent attention of an ophthalmologist. Signs of such conditions include decreased vision, significantly increased sensitivity to light, inability to keep the eye open, a pupil that does not respond to light, or a severe headache with nausea.&lt;ref name="McGra-Hill"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Longo|first1=DL|title=Harrison's Principles of Internal Medicine|date=2012|publisher=McGra-Hill|chapter=Disorders of the Eye(Horton JC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fluctuating blurring is common, due to tearing and mucoid discharge.  Mild photophobia is common.  However, if any of these symptoms is prominent, considering other diseases such as [[glaucoma]], [[uveitis]], [[keratitis]], and even [[meningitis]] or [[caroticocavernous fistula|carotico-cavernous fistula]] is important.

A more comprehensive differential diagnosis for the red or painful eye includes:&lt;ref name="McGra-Hill"/&gt;
* [[Corneal abrasion]]
* [[Subconjunctival hemorrhage]]
* [[Pinguecula]]
* [[Blepharitis]]
* [[Dacryocystitis]]
* [[Keratoconjunctivitis sicca]] (dry eye)
* [[Keratitis]]
* [[Herpes simplex]]
* [[Herpes zoster]]
* [[Episcleritis]] - an [[Inflammation|inflammatory]] condition that produces a similar appearance to conjunctivitis, but without discharge or tearing
* [[Uveitis]]
* [[Acute angle-closure glaucoma]]
* [[Endophthalmitis]]

== Prevention ==
The most effective prevention is good hygiene, especially avoiding rubbing the eyes with infected hands. Vaccination against adenovirus, ''Haemophilus influenzae'', pneumococcus, and ''Neisseria meningitidis'' is also effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/conjunctivitis/about/prevention.html|title=Protect Yourself From Pink Eye|date=2 October 2017|work=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|access-date=18 October 2017|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Povidone-iodine]] eye solution has been found to prevent neonatal conjunctivitis.&lt;ref name=Is2003/&gt; It is becoming more commonly used globally because of its low cost.&lt;ref name=Is2003&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Isenberg|first1=SJ|title=The ocular application of povidone-iodine.|journal=Community eye health / International Centre for Eye Health|date=2003|volume=16|issue=46|pages=30–1|pmid=17491857|pmc=1705857}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Management ==
Conjunctivitis resolves in 65% of cases without treatment, within 2-5 days. The prescription of antibiotics is not necessary in most cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rose P |title=Management strategies for acute infective conjunctivitis in primary care: a systematic review |journal=Expert Opin Pharmacother |volume=8 |issue=12 |pages=1903–21 |date=August 2007 |pmid=17696792 |doi=10.1517/14656566.8.12.1903 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viral ===
Viral conjunctivitis usually resolves on its own and does not require any specific treatment.&lt;ref name=JAMA2013&gt;{{cite journal|last=Azari|first=AA|author2=Barney, NP|title=Conjunctivitis: a systematic review of diagnosis and treatment.|journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association|date=23 October 2013|volume=310|issue=16|pages=1721–9|pmid=24150468|doi=10.1001/jama.2013.280318|pmc=4049531}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antihistamines (e.g., diphenhydramine) or mast cell stabilizers (e.g., [[Cromoglicic acid|cromolyn]]) may be used to help with the symptoms.&lt;ref name=JAMA2013/&gt; Povidone-iodine has been suggested as a treatment, but as of 2008, evidence to support it was poor.&lt;ref name="BartlettJaanus2008"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jimmy D. Bartlett|author2=Siret D. Jaanus|title=Clinical Ocular Pharmacology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Eybg7fbs65MC&amp;pg=PA454|year=2008|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=0-7506-7576-4|pages=454–|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161203204429/https://books.google.com/books?id=Eybg7fbs65MC&amp;pg=PA454|archivedate=3 December 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Allergic ===
For allergic conjunctivitis, cool water poured over the face with the head inclined downward constricts capillaries, and [[artificial tears]] sometimes relieve discomfort in mild cases. In more severe cases, [[NSAID|nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory medications]] and [[antihistamine]]s may be prescribed. Persistent allergic conjunctivitis may also require topical steroid drops.

=== Bacterial ===
Bacterial conjunctivitis usually resolves without treatment.&lt;ref name="JAMA2013"/&gt; Topical antibiotics may be needed only if no improvement is observed after 3 days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Visscher|first=KL|author2=Hutnik, CM |author3=Thomas, M |title=Evidence-based treatment of acute infective conjunctivitis: Breaking the cycle of antibiotic prescribing.|journal=Canadian Family Physician |date=November 2009 |volume=55|issue=11|pages=1071–5|pmid=19910590|pmc=2776793}}&lt;/ref&gt; No serious effects were noted either with or without treatment.&lt;ref name=Sheikh2012 /&gt; Because antibiotics do speed healing in bacterial conjunctivitis, their use may be considered.&lt;ref name=Sheikh2012&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sheikh|first=A|author2=Hurwitz, B |author3=van Schayck, CP |author4=McLean, S |author5=Nurmatov, U |title=Antibiotics versus placebo for acute bacterial conjunctivitis.|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|date=12 September 2012|volume=9|pages=CD001211|pmid=22972049|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001211.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antibiotics are also recommended for those who wear contact lenses, are [[immunocompromised]], have disease which is thought to be due to chlamydia or gonorrhea, have a fair bit of pain, or have copious discharge.&lt;ref name=JAMA2013/&gt; Gonorrheal or chlamydial infections require both oral and topical antibiotics.&lt;ref name=JAMA2013/&gt;

The choice of antibiotic varies based on the strain or suspected strain of bacteria causing the infection. [[Fluoroquinolones]], [[sodium sulfacetamide]], or [[trimethoprim/polymyxin]] may be used, typically for 7–10 days.&lt;ref name=Yanoff /&gt;  Cases of meningococcal conjunctivitis can also be treated with systemic penicillin, as long as the strain is sensitive to penicillin.

When investigated as a treatment, povidone-iodine ophthalmic solution has also been observed to have some effectiveness against bacterial and chlamydial conjunctivitis, with a possible role suggested in locations where topical antibiotics are unavailable or costly.&lt;ref name="Am J Ophthalmol 2002"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Isenberg |first1=SJ |last2=Apt |first2=L |last3=Valenton |first3=M |last4=Del Signore |first4=M |last5=Cubillan |first5=L |last6=Labrador |first6=MA |last7=Chan |first7=P |last8=Berman |first8=NG |pmid=12429243 |title=A controlled trial of povidone-iodine to treat infectious conjunctivitis in children |journal=[[American Journal of Ophthalmology]] |date=November 2002 |volume=134 |issue=5 |pages=681–688|doi=10.1016/S0002-9394(02)01701-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chemical ===
Conjunctivitis due to chemicals is treated via [[Therapeutic irrigation|irrigation]] with [[Ringer's lactate]] or [[saline (medicine)|saline solution]]. Chemical injuries, particularly alkali burns, are medical emergencies, as they can lead to severe scarring and intraocular damage. People with chemically induced conjunctivitis should not touch their eyes to avoid spreading the chemical.

== Epidemiology ==
Conjunctivitis is the most common eye disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smeltzer|first1=Suzanne C.|title=Brunner &amp; Suddarth's textbook of medical-surgical nursing.|date=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=9780781785891|page=1787|edition=12th|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=SmtjSD1x688C&amp;pg=RA1-PA1787|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160815203433/https://books.google.ca/books?id=SmtjSD1x688C&amp;pg=RA1-PA1787|archivedate=15 August 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- Include more on epidemiology if more info can be found. --&gt;

== History ==
An adenovirus was first isolated by Rowe ''et al.'' in 1953.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11463">The '''Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE)''' is a 501(c)(6) non-profit organization originally organized in 1955, founded in 1992, and based in Atlanta, Georgia. CSTE works to advance public health policy and workforce capacity for applied public health [[Epidemiology#The profession|epidemiologists]] in all localities, states, and territories in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists – CDC|url=https://www.cdc.gov/stltpublichealth/Partnerships/cste.html|website=CDC National Partners – CSTE|publisher=Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|accessdate=December 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CSTE also provides information, education, and developmental support of practicing epidemiologists in a wide range of areas as well as expertise for program and surveillance efforts. CSTE works with [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], [[United States Congress|the U.S. Congress]], the [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|U.S. Department Health and Human Services]], [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA)]], and other partners. CSTE is led by an executive board composed of members who lead activities in various subject-specific steering committees.

==Vision and mission==
The Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists (CSTE) is committed to improving the public's health by supporting the efforts of epidemiologists working at the state and local level to influence public health programs and policy based on science and data.

CSTE promotes the effective use of epidemiologic data to guide public health practice and improve health. CSTE accomplishes this by supporting the use of effective public health surveillance and good epidemiologic practice through training, capacity development, and peer consultation, developing standards for practice, and advocating for resources and scientifically based policy.

CSTE has worked with the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] (CDC) on ''Case Definitions for Public Health Surveillance'' and ''Chronic Disease Indicators''.

'''Disability Studies in Education''' (DSE) is a field of academic study concerned with education research and practice related to [[disability]]. DSE scholars promote an understanding of disability from a [[social model of disability]] perspective to “challenge social, medical, and psychological models of disability as they relate to education".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aera.net/SIG143/DisabilityStudiesinEducationSIG143/tabid/12121/Default.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; A DSE perspective situates disability within social and political context and is concerned with the civil and human rights of students with disabilities, including issues of equity, access, and inclusion in educational settings, curricula, and activities. DSE emerged as a part of the broader, interdisciplinary [[Disability Studies]] movement and as a critique of [[special education]].

==Foundations==

DSE scholarship is based on a social conception of disability that identifies barriers, attitudes, and actions that serve to systematically exclude individuals with disabilities society.  It is a reaction to the dominant [[medical model of disability]] which positions people with disabilities as having limitations outside of the "normal" or typical boundaries that require remediation and intervention. DSE has its origins in sociological theories of [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]], [[social stigma]]&lt;ref&gt;Goffman, E. (1961 ). Asylums: Notes on the management of a spoiled identity. Boston: Prentice-Hall.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Becker, H. (1963). Outsiders: Studies in the sociology of deviance. New York: Free Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erikson, K. T. (1962). Notes on the sociology of deviance. Social Problems, 9, 307-314&lt;/ref&gt; and [[labeling theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, L.M. (1969). Small, special-purpose residential facilities for the retarded. In R. B. Kugel and W. Wolfensberger (Eds.), Changing patterns in residential services for the mentally retarded (pp. 211-226). Washington, DC: President' s Committee on Mental Retardation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, J. R. ( 1965). Social system perspective and clinical perspective: Frames of reference for understanding career patterns of persons labeled as mentally retarded. Social Problems, 13(1), 18-34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mercer, J. R. (1973). Labelling the mentally retarded: Clinical and social system perspectives on mental retardation. Berkeley: University of California Press.&lt;/ref&gt; as social construction.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan, R., and Taylor, S. J. (1976). The judged, not the judges: An insider's view of mental retardation. American Psychologist, 31(1), 47-52.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1970, there emerged critiques of labeling in special education, now referred to as [[ableism]].&lt;ref&gt;Gabel, S. L. (2005). Disability studies in education: Readings in theory and method (Vol. 3). Peter Lang.&lt;/ref&gt;

The social model of disability positions physical, intellectual, psychological, sensory, and emotional variations as natural and therefore requires societal changes in the response to those variations. The problem therefore resides not within the individual with impairments, but in the attitudes toward and treatment of people with disabilities.  A DSE perspective is grounded in the belief that a collective social response to disability has resulted in systematic inequality, [[marginalization]], discrimination, and oppression. There is also the recognition that disability is both a form of individuation and group identification. Because individual identities are complex and intersect with other identity categories (i.e. race, gender, social class, sexual orientation), there are varied ways that individuals may identify themselves as disabled.

==Issues==

DSE is concerned with critical issues concerning the education of people identified as disabled.  Central questions of concern to DSE scholars are:

;1. What is an appropriate education for students with disabilities?

DSE scholars promote academic activism in that they seek to counter the dominant discourse of the disabled student as deficient and abnormal. They criticize [[special education]] as an inadequate response to disability which seeks to remediate the individual in order for them to fit in with the norm. They promote a [[social justice]] perspective in which the purpose of education is to accept and care for all students.

;2. What counts as research and inquiry?

DSE scholars challenge research methodologies that serves to objectify, marginalize, and oppress disabled people. They promote research that is created by and accountable to disabled people, rather than portraying them as subjects. They recognize the value of interdisciplinary approaches within and outside the educational field and promote interaction among researchers from a variety of disciplinary perspectives.

;3. What is [[inclusion (education)|inclusion]] and who is included?

A DSE perspective foregrounds the interests and voices of disabled students in their education. DSE scholars reject deficit models of disability and assume that all children have the right to equitable, full, and meaningful access to educational opportunities. At the same time, DSE scholars understand that special education ≠ inclusive education ≠ disability studies in education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4196">A '''food hub''', as defined by the [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]], is “a centrally located facility with a business management structure facilitating the aggregation, storage, processing, distribution, and/or marketing of locally/regionally produced food products.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blogs.usda.gov/2010/12/14/getting-to-scale-with-regional-food-hubs/|title=USDA Blog  » Getting to Scale with Regional Food Hubs|website=blogs.usda.gov|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Food hubs are a part of the [[agricultural value chain]] model and often share common values relating to conservation, sustainability, healthy food access, and supporting local farmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ams.usda.gov/services/local-regional/food-hubs|title=Food Value Chains and Food Hubs: Supporting Local Producers Through Collaborative Planning, Aggregation, and Distribution {{!}} Agricultural Marketing Service|website=www.ams.usda.gov|access-date=2016-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A defining characteristic of food hubs is source identification, a food safety and marketing benefit that allows consumers to trace the origin of products they buy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Food Hubs: Supply Chain Traceability to Enhance Local Food Systems|journal=Food Studies: An Interdisciplinary Journal|volume= 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  One of the primary goals of food hubs is to give small and medium-sized farmers access to larger or additional markets.

== Core functions ==
Food hubs handle some or all of the following:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ngfn.org/resources/ngfn-database/knowledge/2013%20Food%20Hub%20Survey%20Report.pdf|title=Findings of the 2013 National Food Hub Survey|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Aggregation: Compile products from different suppliers/farms to distribute through a single channel
* Distribution: Store products and transport them to the customer
* Marketing and sales: Find buyers, sell and advertise products, and promote farms’ brand identities

== Types ==
Food hubs are generally categorized into three different types. 
* Retail or Farm to Consumer (F2C): This model gives farmers more access to high-value markets by distributing products directly to consumers online, in a retail space, or via a [[community-supported agriculture]] (CSA) subscription.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ngfn.org/resources/ngfn-database/knowledge/FoodHubResourceGuide.pdf|title=Regional Food Hub Resource Guide|last=|first=|date=2012|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* Wholesale or Farm to Business/Institution (F2B):This model gives farmers access to high-volume markets such as schools, grocery stores, hospitals, and restaurants that they couldn’t normally obtain on their own due to lack of volume or consistency. This method of aggregating products to meet higher volume needs is more efficient for buyers and makes it easier for them to buy regionally throughout the year.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 
* Hybrid: This model includes both retail and wholesale operations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A food hub may be set up as a non-profit organization, a for-profit business, or a cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nesfp.org/sites/default/files/resources/worldpeas_scalingupguide.pdf|title=A Guide for Scaling Up Food Hubs|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Geralt of Rivia''' ({{lang-pl|Geralt z Rivii}}) is a fictional character, the [[protagonist]] of ''[[The Witcher]]'' series of short stories and novels by Polish writer [[Andrzej Sapkowski]], as well as its adaptations, which include film, TV series, comic books and video games. Geralt, one of the few remaining [[vedmak|witcher]]s on the Continent, is a traveling monster slayer for hire, mutated and trained from an early age to slay deadly beasts.

Geralt was portrayed by [[Michał Żebrowski]] in [[The Hexer (film)|''The Hexer'' film]] and [[The Hexer (TV series)|TV series]], and will be portrayed by [[Henry Cavill]] in a [[The Witcher (U.S. TV series)|netflix television adaptation.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/henry-cavill-the-witcher-netflix-series-1202925521/ |title=Henry Cavill to Star in ‘Witcher’ Series at Netflix |last=Otterson |first=Joe |date=4 September 2018 |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |publisher=[[Penske Media Corporation]] |access-date=5 September 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fictional biography==
===Original===
Geralt, the central character, is a [[The Witcher|witcher]]. Shortly after being born, Geralt was forced (by the "Law of Surprise", a law that states that if one cannot pay for the services of a witcher, the witcher is entitled to something the debtor does not yet know they have) to undergo training and, eventually, become a witcher at Kaer Morhen — the stronghold of the Wolf School Witchers. Geralt survived numerous mutations during the Trial of the Grasses, thanks to which he gained practically superhuman physical and mental abilities with minimal side effects. He resisted the "changes" brought on by the Trial of Grasses better than most, which encouraged his makers to perform even more dangerous experimental procedures on him, making him lose all body pigmentation. Because of his pale skin and white hair, he is also known in the Elder Speech as "Gwynbleidd", the White Wolf.

Despite his name, Geralt does not come from [[The Witcher#Setting|Rivia]] (although he learned how to mimic a Rivian [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]] and is later knighted for services to the queen of Rivia): young witchers were encouraged to make up surnames for themselves by master Vesemir, to make their names sound more trustworthy. He once claimed that his first choice was Geralt Roger Eric du Haute-Bellegarde, but this was dismissed by Vesemir as silly and pretentious.

After completing his witcher training, he received his Wolf medallion (the symbol of Kaer Morhen) and embarked into the world on his horse called ''Płotka'' — (literally, "[[Common roach|Roach]]" with a dimunitive suffix. More accurately "Roachie" in English; he gave the same name to every horse he owned) to become a monster slayer for hire.

{{Quote|text=I looked for the words "Witcher urgently needed". And then there'd be a sacred site, a dungeon, necropolis or ruins, forest ravine or grotto hidden in the mountains, full of bones and stinking carcasses. Some creatures which lived to kill, out of hunger, for pleasure, or invoked by some sick will. A manticore, wyvern, fogler, aeschna, ilyocoris, chimera, leshy, vampire, ghoul, graveir, were-wolf, giant scorpion, striga, black annis, kikimora, vypper... so many I've killed.|character=Geralt|author=[[Andrzej Sapkowski]]|title=''[[The Last Wish (book)|The Last Wish]]''|source="The Voice of Reason 4"}}

Even though Geralt did not believe in destiny, he unknowingly demanded the unborn child of princess Pavetta and her husband Duny as a reward for his services by invoking "the Law of Surprise". The child turned out to be a girl, [[Ciri (character)|Ciri]] (otherwise known as Ziri coming from the elder speech word Zireael meaning ''Swallow''). At first, Geralt did not take her because women cannot become witchers. However, fate or blind chance caused Geralt and Ciri to cross their paths thrice, and after the death of her grandmother, Queen Calanthe of Cintra, Geralt ends up taking the girl into his care, training and loving her as his own daughter.

The events of the novels unfold as Geralt is pulled into a whirlwind of events in his attempts to protect Ciri from those who would do her harm, becoming reluctantly embroiled in the political contentions of monarchs and emperors.

===Continuation in video games===
After seemingly being killed by a mob during a slaughter of non-humans at the end of the ''Witcher'' saga and taken, with Yennefer, to the Isle of Avalon, by Ciri, who then revives them, Geralt's story continues in CD Projekt Red's video game trilogy (''[[The Witcher (video game)|The Witcher]]'', ''[[The Witcher 2: Assassins of Kings]]'' and ''[[The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt]]''). Geralt wakes in the outskirts of the Kaer Morhen fortress, with no recollection of the details of his sudden reappearance, (after Yennefer was captured by the Wild Hunt, he offered himself for her freedom. He was saved once again by Ciri, and left wounded and without memory of his past in the wood near Kaer Morhen). He is rescued by his fellow witchers of the school of the wolf and taken back to Kaer Morhen.

Geralt, voiced by [[Doug Cockle]], appeared as a guest character in the 2018 game ''[[Soulcalibur VI]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.cdprojektred.com/news/play-as-geralt-of-rivia-in-soulcalibur-vi/ |title=Play as Geralt of Rivia in SOULCALIBUR VI! |last= |first= |date=15 March 2018 |website=[[CD Projekt|CD Projekt Red]] |publisher=[[CD Projekt]] |access-date=19 March 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sapkowski stated that the games are a work of art of their own and that they cannot be considered either an "alternative version", or a sequel, "because this can only be told by Geralt's creator. A certain Andrzej Sapkowski." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2012-11-06-ever-wondered-what-the-author-of-the-witcher-books-thinks-about-the-games|title=Ever wondered what the author of The Witcher books thinks about the games?|last=Purchese|first=Robert|date=7 November 2012|work=[[Eurogamer]]|publisher=Gamer Network|accessdate=22 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary analysis and reception ==
Geralt is described as being emblematic of Polish popular culture's spirit of "[[neo-liberal]] anti-politics" in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="Apor2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Apor|first=Péter|title=Past for the eyes: East European representations of communism in cinema and museums after 1989|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SO8LAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=28 May 2011|year=2008|publisher=Central European University Press|isbn=9789639776050|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a professional, carrying out his duties and unwilling to become involved in the "petty quarrels" of the contemporary politics.&lt;ref name="Apor2008"/&gt; [[Marek Oramus]] compared Geralt to [[Raymond Chandler]]'s signature character [[Philip Marlowe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Oramus |first=Marek |author-link=Marek Oramus |date=2 September 2000 |title=Only the right image of a witcher |trans-title=Jedynie słuszny wizerunek wiedźmina |url=https://archiwum.polityka.pl/art/jedynie-sluszny-wizerunek-wiedzmina,365834.html |language=Polish |work=[[Polityka]] |location=[[Poland]] |access-date=30 May 2011 |pages=52-54}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[GamesRadar]] ranked him as the 50th best hero in video game history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/top-100-video-game-heroes |title=The best heroes in video games |last= |first= |date=28 February 2018 |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |publisher=[[Future plc|Future Publishing]] |access-date=5 September 2018 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Global Virus Network''' ('''GVN''') is an international coalition of medical [[Virology|virologists]] founded in 2011, and covering 24 countries in 2015.&lt;ref name=McSweegan2015/&gt;The Global Virus Network has grown to be a demanding and fundamental defense against any and all diseases of viral nature&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/integratedglobalbiomedicalsciences/projects/Global-virus-network.html|title=Global Virus Network - Center for Integrated Global Health Sciences - University at Buffalo|website=www.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It fosters research into [[virus]]es that cause human disease, with the aim of promoting the development of [[diagnostics]], [[antiviral drug]]s and [[vaccine]]s.In addition, GVN's mission includes strengthening medical research and response mechanisms to current viral causes to human disease.  It was co-founded by [[Robert Gallo]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.nature.com/nm/journal/v17/n4/full/nm0411-394a.html |title=New organization pledges scientific expertise for viral outbreaks |author= Mann A |journal=[[Nature Medicine]] |year=2011 |volume=17 |pages=394 |doi=10.1038/nm0411-394a }}&lt;/ref&gt; who is its scientific director. It is headquartered at the Institute of Human Virology at the [[University of Maryland School of Medicine]] in the USA.

GVN organises task forces in the areas of [[chikungunya]] and [[human T-lymphotropic virus]], and launched one in the area of [[Zika fever|Zika]] in 2016.&lt;ref name=McSweegan2015&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = McSweegan E, Weaver SC, Lecuit M, Frieman M, Morrison TE, Hrynkow S | title = The Global Virus Network: Challenging chikungunya | journal = Antiviral Research | volume = 120 | pages = 147–52 | date = August 2015 | pmid = 26071007 | pmc = 4843800 | doi = 10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.06.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://gvn.org/task-forces/task-force-viruses-responsible-for-leukemia-and-neurologic-disorders/ |publisher=GVN |title=Leading Virologists Join Together to Tackle Viruses, Leukemia and Neurologic Disorders |access-date= 25 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mission ==
GVN's main mission is to tackle current broad viral threats as they develop, and to strengthen current research of viruses that cause human disease. By doing so they prepare themselves as well as the world for any and all viral hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/integratedglobalbiomedicalsciences/projects/Global-virus-network.html|title=Global Virus Network - Center for Integrated Global Health Sciences - University at Buffalo|website=www.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;Their mission is outlined by 3 steps that they take to achieve it. They are as follows: 1. International collective research, 2. On going raining of up coming generations of medical virologists (public education), and 3. Advocacy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/integratedglobalbiomedicalsciences/projects/Global-virus-network.html|title=Global Virus Network - Center for Integrated Global Health Sciences - University at Buffalo|website=www.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== International Collective research: ===
With the use of small grants provided to the GVN, they are capable of providing training fellowships. that ensures that current virologists are where they need to be to address any viral challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gvn.org/about/|title=About – GVN|website=gvn.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;Global partnerships and mutual cooperation is the reason why the GVN can span globally, and be able to research viruses as the manifest and spread.

=== Public Education: ===
GVN is a source of credible information about viruses, vaccines, and breakthroughs in both fields. They spread information through digital, and public speaking platforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gvn.org/about/|title=About – GVN|website=gvn.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;The GVN promotes educational and valuable programs for future generations of scientists and biologists. Its a stable resource for both large governments and small organizations who are attempting to prepare themselves for viral threats.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McSweegan|first=Edward|last2=Weaver|first2=Scott C.|last3=Lecuit|first3=Marc|last4=Frieman|first4=Matthew|last5=Morrison|first5=Thomas E.|last6=Hrynkow|first6=Sharon|date=August 2015|title=The Global Virus Network: Challenging chikungunya|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843800/|journal=Antiviral research|volume=120|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.06.003|issn=0166-3542|pmc=4843800|pmid=26071007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advocacy: ===
Ensuring that funding is kept up and that they are able to provide up to ate information through partnerships with different governments and agencies spread-out throughout the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gvn.org/about/|title=About – GVN|website=gvn.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;The GVN is a huge advocate for further research to be done and for more training opportunities to be given for everyone across the globe

== Funding ==
All scientists and research under the GVN is supported through different continuous small grants. The GVN works side by side with governments as well as with research companies found worldwide, in order to insure that money for both training for virologists and research money are kept high enough to meet the demands of global health.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buffalo.edu/integratedglobalbiomedicalsciences/projects/Global-virus-network.html|title=Global Virus Network - Center for Integrated Global Health Sciences - University at Buffalo|website=www.buffalo.edu|language=en|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;Funding also comes from the GVN's partnerships. The GVN is partnered with The Global Health Security Security Agenda (GHSA), the [[Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations]] (CEPI), and with the Medical Technology Enterprise Consortium (MTEC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gvn.org/about/partners/|title=Partners – GVN|website=gvn.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History and Centers ==
The GVN was founded collectively by William Hall (MD, PHD), [[Robert Gallo]] (MD), and the late Reinhard Kurth (MD) in 2011.

The GVN is the only Institute of its nature, and has 34 centers of excellence spread globally across 17 nations. Each center for the GVN has a medical virologist as its director, is willing to commit to GVN's mission, and the centers are effectively showing expertise in no fewer than two viral areas of science.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gvn.org/gvn-centers/|title=GVN Centers – GVN|website=gvn.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Accomplishments ==

=== GVN against the [[Chikungunya]] virus (CHIKV): ===

==== Chikungunya virus explained: ====
CHIKV has presented itself as mainly an onset febrile illness that works rapidly. Its first visible symptom is a rash on the hands and arms. It is known to cause a high fever, and has the same intensity of that of an acute viral infection. Both of those facts corresponds with any virus that is present and visible in the blood stream.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McSweegan|first=Edward|last2=Weaver|first2=Scott C.|last3=Lecuit|first3=Marc|last4=Frieman|first4=Matthew|last5=Morrison|first5=Thomas E.|last6=Hrynkow|first6=Sharon|date=August 2015|title=The Global Virus Network: Challenging chikungunya|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843800/|journal=Antiviral research|volume=120|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.06.003|issn=0166-3542|pmc=4843800|pmid=26071007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== What the GVN has done: ====
The GVN was initially formed in 2011 in response to the outbreak of the Chikungunya virus. At the time the virus had just spread to the Western Hemisphere. The GVN also talked about tackling the ongoing Ebola crisis centered around West Africa but the Chikungunya virus was their main priority at the time. CHIKU was discovered a little before 1968, and has had outbreaks from Thailand to the French Island of Reunion. The virus at the time had caused 254 deaths in the Island of Reunion. In 2013 the virus had begun spreading to the Caribbean and across to South America. The GVN is working toward Antiviral drugs and vaccines against the Chikungunya virus. A problem they faced from the beginning is limiting diagnosing capabilities. It was hard to be able to diagnose those with the virus from where they were located. They couldn't control the outbreaks in the regions where the virus was most prominent because of that limitation. However, so far the GVN has advanced the knowledge about the CHIKV infections, and have also aided in drawing up what preventative measures can be done globally.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McSweegan|first=Edward|last2=Weaver|first2=Scott C.|last3=Lecuit|first3=Marc|last4=Frieman|first4=Matthew|last5=Morrison|first5=Thomas E.|last6=Hrynkow|first6=Sharon|date=August 2015|title=The Global Virus Network: Challenging chikungunya|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843800/|journal=Antiviral research|volume=120|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.06.003|issn=0166-3542|pmc=4843800|pmid=26071007}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In response to the viruses ability to spread a lot quicker than first thought, the GVN honed in its efforts to learn more about and get ahead of the virus. They enlisted a task force on the CHIKV. Different people working underneath the GVN were chosen based on their own personal research, their qualifications, and what they had already accomplished.The task force is made up of 22 members, 3 co-chairs, and is overseen by Scott Weaver, John Fazakerley, and Marc Lecuit. the task force had 4 main tasks for the Chikungunya virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McSweegan|first=Edward|last2=Weaver|first2=Scott C.|last3=Lecuit|first3=Marc|last4=Frieman|first4=Matthew|last5=Morrison|first5=Thomas E.|last6=Hrynkow|first6=Sharon|date=August 2015|title=The Global Virus Network: Challenging chikungunya|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843800/|journal=Antiviral research|volume=120|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.06.003|issn=0166-3542|pmc=4843800|pmid=26071007}}&lt;/ref&gt; They would find out where potential funding for what was needed to be done would come from, provide information to all journalists and health officials, advocate for more research to be done on the mosquitos that carry many viruses, and to review the basic science of the disease in order to identify vaccines and to start drug trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McSweegan|first=Edward|last2=Weaver|first2=Scott C.|last3=Lecuit|first3=Marc|last4=Frieman|first4=Matthew|last5=Morrison|first5=Thomas E.|last6=Hrynkow|first6=Sharon|date=August 2015|title=The Global Virus Network: Challenging chikungunya|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4843800/|journal=Antiviral research|volume=120|pages=147–152|doi=10.1016/j.antiviral.2015.06.003|issn=0166-3542|pmc=4843800|pmid=26071007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GVN against the [[Zika virus]]: ===

==== Zika virus explained: ====
The Zika virus is an fast acting virus that can be transferred through mosquito bites, and from a pregnant woman to her fetus. Currently there is no vaccines or specific medication to treat the symptoms associated with the Zika virus. However there are general medications that help dampen the common symptoms of the virus. Common symptoms include: fever, rash, headache joint pain, red eyes, and muscle pain. Symptoms typically don't last more than a week and people rarely die from this virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/zika/about/overview.html|title=What We Know About Zika|date=2018-06-06|work=CDC|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;The virus starts posing a threat if it gets transferred to a fetus, because it can cause birth defects, and can cause miscarriages and stillbirths.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/zika/about/overview.html|title=What We Know About Zika|date=2018-06-06|work=CDC|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==== GVN's Plan: ====
The GVN also assembled a task force to tackle the Zika virus. Unlike the CHIKV task force, Membership to this task force is voluntary and its of any GVN member who has research or new developments that can be used in response to the Zika virus epidemic. Scott Weaver acts as chairman to this task force.  The task force reports to all the GVN centers regarding news and information about the virus. The GVN's main goal is to be able to control the outbreak and keep it in one general area in order to make it easier to diagnose, control, and possibly treat the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cdc.gov/zika/about/overview.html|title=What We Know About Zika|date=2018-06-06|work=CDC|access-date=2018-11-29|language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== GVN against the Human T-[[Leukemia]] Virus (HTLV-1): ===

==== HTLV-1 explained: ====
This infection effects one’s t cells. The virus usually causes no visible minor signs/symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rarediseases.info.nih.gov/diseases/9645/human-t-cell-leukemia-virus-type-1|title=Human T-cell leukemia virus type 1             {{!}} Genetic and Rare Diseases Information Center (GARD) – an NCATS Program|website=rarediseases.info.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, severe and are symptoms include: motor changes in your limbs, and inflamed spinal cord, weakened legs, and cognitive impairment. Some of those effected can later on develop adult T-cell Leukemia and can be pre-disposed to other severe medical conditions. This virus can spread through sexual contact, used (un sterile) needles, and by blood transfusions. It can also spread to a child from the mother’s breast milk. There are currently no treatments or cures for HTLV-1, and those who have it, have it all their life. It isn’t considered a huge threat because about 95% f those infected stay asymptomatic their whole life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gvn.org/programs/htlv-1-task-force/|title=HTLV-1 Task Force – GVN|website=gvn.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== GVN's Plan: ====
The GVN has stated how important its work is, The GVN is bring together the global community to work and talk through these viral problems that go under-recognized in a lot of countries. The task force made up of experts working on this virus spans across 11 countries, and is led by Dr. Robert Gallow in [[Maryland]], Dr. Luc Willems in [[Belgium]], and DR. Hideki Hasegawa in [[Japan]]. The task force works daily to accelerate and provide more research in order to hopefully stop HTLV-1 their mission includes funding drugs that can work in stopping the [[virus]] from growing into a [[disease]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://gvn.org/programs/htlv-1-task-force/|title=HTLV-1 Task Force – GVN|website=gvn.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21323">The '''Grand Challenges in Global Health''' (GCGH) is a research initiative launched by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]]&lt;ref name= GHC/&gt; in search of solutions to health problems in the developing world.  Fifteen challenges are categorized in groups among seven stated goals plus an eighth group for family health.  The disciplines involved include [[immunology]], [[microbiology]], [[genetics]], [[molecular|molecular biology]] and cellular biology, [[entomology]], [[agricultural science]]s, clinical sciences, [[epidemiology]], population and [[behavioral science]]s, [[ecology]], and [[evolutionary biology]].

== The Grand Challenges ==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2013}}

'''Goal 1: Improve Vaccines''' 
* ''Grand Challenge #1: Create Effective Single-Dose Vaccines that Can be used Soon After Birth''
:Potential benefits of this challenge include increased effectiveness of immunization, decreased cost of immunization systems, and decreased deaths in early childhood. One project to combat this challenge that is currently underway is the development of a live recombinant attenuated salmonella anti pneumococcal vaccine for newborns, which is being investigated by Dr. Roy Curtiss III at Arizona State University.
* ''Grand Challenge #2: Prepare Vaccines that Do Not Require Refrigeration''
:Potential benefits include increased efficacy of immunization systems as well as reduced cost of vaccine delivery. Dr. Abraham L. Sonenschein and his team at Tufts University School of Medicine are currently working to develop childhood vaccines for [[diphtheria]], [[tetanus]], and [[pertussis]] that can endure a wide range of temperatures with the encapsulation of heat-resistant bacterial spores.
* ''Grand Challenge #3: Develop Needle-Free Delivery Systems for Vaccines''
:Potential benefits include improved access and compliance and the avoidance of infection from the re-use of needles. Dr. James R. Baker and a team at the University of Michigan are working on a way of preparing vaccines that can be given as nasal drops, eliminating the need for preservatives or refrigeration.

'''Goal 2: Create New Vaccines'''
* ''Grand Challenge #4: Devise Reliable Tests in Model Systems to Evaluate Live-attenuated Vaccines''
:The priority areas for this challenge are viruses refractory to vaccine development, pathogenic bacteria, and complex pathogens such as protozoa and fungi. Dr. Hongkui Deng of Peking University in China is currently working with his colleagues to create mouse models with immune systems and livers that are similar enough to humans to allow testing of potential [[HIV]] and [[Hepatitis C virus|HCV]] vaccines.
* ''Grand Challenge #5: Solve How to Design Antigens for Effective, Protective immunity''
:The priority areas for this challenge involve HIV and [[malaria]]. Dr. Ralph Steinman and his team are currently developing vaccines that stimulate the immune system’s dendritic cells, which are known to help protect against infectious diseases.
* ''Grand Challenge #6: Learn Which Immunological Responses Provide Protective immunity''
:A potential benefit of this challenge is the establishment of new diagnostic and prognostic tools for assessing public health. Dr. Patrick E. Duffy’s team at the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute is currently attempting to identify the antibodies and other immunological responses that help protect children from death due to malaria.

'''Goal 3: Control Insect Vectors'''
* ''Grand Challenge #7: Develop a Genetic Strategy to Deplete or Incapacitate a Disease-transmitting Insect Population''
:The priority areas for this challenge include malaria, dengue, and other tropical arboviral diseases. Dr. Scott O’Neill of the University of Queensland in Australia is attempting to modify mosquito population age structure in order to eliminate dengue transmission.
* ''Grand Challenge #8: Develop a Chemical Strategy to Deplete or Incapacitate a Disease-transmitting Insect Population''
:The hope with this challenge is that this challenge will effectively disrupt the diseases transmission cycle. At Virginia Tech University, Dr. Jeffery Bloomquist and a team are using molecular modeling and a new chemical synthesis method known as “click chemistry” to produce insecticides targeted to the primary malaria vector mosquitoes, ''[[Anopheles gambiae]]''.

'''Goal 4: Improve Nutrition'''
* ''Grand Challenge #9: Create a Full Range of Optimal, Bioavailable Nutrients in a Single Staple Plant Species''
:To improve nutrition, this grand challenge focuses on iron, zinc, and selenium deficiencies. At Ohio State University, Dr. Richard Sayre is leading a team of scientists to create nutritious cassava for sub-Saharan Africa.

'''Goal 5: Limit Drug Resistance'''
* Grand Challenge #10: Discover Drugs and Delivery Systems that Minimize the Likelihood of Drug Resistant Micro-organisms
:This challenge focuses on [[Tuberculosis|TB]], Malaria, and HIV. Potential benefits include reduced treatment failures and simple treatment regimens. Dr. Brett Finlay and a team at the University of British Columbia are investigating new therapeutics that boost innate immunity to treat infectious diseases.

'''Goal 6: Cure Infection'''
* ''Grand Challenge #11: Create Therapies that Can Cure Latent Infection''
:This challenge focuses on HIV, [[Hepatitis B virus|HBV]], Herpes, TB, [[Schistosomiasis]], and [[Toxoplasmosis]]. Dr. Douglas Young of the Imperial College in London is leading researchers from the U.K, U.S., Singapore, Korea, and Mexico to further expose the biology of latency and then develop drugs against latent TB.
* ''Grand Challenge #12: Create Immunological Methods that Can Cure Latent Infection''
:This challenge focuses on similar priority areas as Challenge #11, and Dr. Robert Garcea and a group of researchers from the University of Colorado School of Medicine are working to identify the best protein candidate for a therapeutic vaccine that will target HPV infection.

'''Goal 7: Measure Health Status'''
* ''Grand Challenge #13: Develop Technologies that Permit Quantitative Assessment of Population Health''
:Potential benefits include a standardized global system for assessing the status of population health as well as accurate assessment of injury, disease prevalence, and incidence. Dr. Christopher Murray and international investigators are working to develop ways to assess and measure mortality.
* ''Grand Challenge #14: Develop Technologies that Allow Assessment of Individuals for Multiple Conditions or Pathogens at Point of Care''
:A potential benefit of this challenge is the rapid detection and diagnoses of disease exposure. At Northwestern University, Dr. David Kelso’s team is trying to develop rapid and affordable point-of-care systems.&lt;ref name=GH&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter A Singer |year=2007 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040265|title= Grand Challenges in Global Health: The Ethical, Social and Cultural Program|journal=PLoS Med|volume=4|issue=9|doi= 10.1371/journal.pmed.0040265|pages=e265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two additional challenges for family health were announced in 2011.
* ''Discover New Ways to Achieve Health Growth''
:A potential benefit of this challenge might lead to new methods of aiding the development of prevention of [[intrauterine growth restriction]] (IUGR), stunting, and wasting of newborns and infants in the developing world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandchallenges.org/GrantOpportunities/Pages/healthygrowth.aspx |title=Grand Challenges: Achieving Healthy Growth Grant Opportunity. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111225214346/http://www.grandchallenges.org/GrantOpportunities/Pages/healthygrowth.aspx |archivedate=2011-12-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Preventing Preterm Birth''
:Potential benefits of this initiative could lead to low-cost technologies that reduce the global problem of prematurity.

== History ==
In January 2003, Bill Gates first announced the Grand Challenges in Global Health at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland. In partnership with the [[National Institutes of Health]] (NIH), the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation (BMFG) granted $200 million to the [[Foundation for the National Institutes of Health]] (FNIH).&lt;ref name=GHC&gt;{{cite journal|author=Tindana PO|year=2007 |url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040273|title= Grand Challenges in Global Health: Community Engagement in Research in Developing Countries|journal=PLoS Med|volume=4|issue=9|doi= 10.1371/journal.pmed.0040273|pages=e273}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fnih.org/work/key-initiatives/grand-challenges-global-health |title=Grand Challenges in Global Health |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903135429/http://fnih.org/work/key-initiatives/grand-challenges-global-health |archivedate=2013-09-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The goal behind the initiative was to fund research to advance the fight against disease that disproportionately affects people in the world’s poorest countries. At this time the scientific board’s responsibilities were outlined: to identify scientific or technological innovations that have a global impact or show potential for feasibility.

In May 2003, the scientific board publicly advertised for ideas. Over a thousand suggestions from scientists and institutions in 75 countries were submitted by July. The scientific board met to further discuss these proposals, which were presented orally with a statement of the problem, descriptions of obstacles to progress, the challenge itself, and a discussion of potential benefits and priority areas for study and application. The following questions raised during the meetings reflect the difficulty in defining these Grand Challenges:
* Does the proposal describe a difficult and discrete roadblock to progress?
* What is the likelihood that creative solutions are required and that grant proposals worthy of funding will be received to address it?
* Is there already substantial scientific activity aimed at solving the problem, which would make the intent of a grand challenge redundant?
* What are possible impacts on various diseases if the challenge is successfully met?
* Will envisioned advances be suitable for implementation in poorer parts of the world?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=H. Varmus |author2=R. Klausner |author3=E. Zerhouni |author4=T. Acharya |author5=A. S. Daar |author6=P. A. Singer |year=2003|url=http://www.sciencemag.org/content/302/5644/398.full|title=Grand Challenges in Global Health|journal=Science|volume= 302|pages= 398–399|doi=10.1126/science.1091769 |pmid=14563993 |pmc=243493}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2003, the scientific board announced fourteen Grand Challenges.

In August 2004, the evaluation of letters from around the world led to over 400 full proposals.  Experts assessed proposals and the Executive Committee of the scientific board and staff members from FNIH and BMGF reviewed the projects to move into the negotiations for grants.

In May 2005, The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation gave an additional $250 million to fund research for the initiative, bringing the foundation’s commitment to $450 million.&lt;ref name=ESC/&gt;

In June 2005, the initiative announced grants for 43 new projects, attracting international partners.

Grants for challenges 15 and 16 (in family health) were awarded in 2012.

In February 2015, GCGH and the [[Global Health Innovative Technology Fund (GHIT)]] partnered to launch Target Research Platform to invest up to ¥100 million (US$1 million) for early stage development and approximately ¥200 million (US$2 million) in Grand Challenges grant investments per year. Successful projects will then move into GHIT’s regular investment program.&lt;ref&gt;"GHIT Funds Grand Challenges", Asian Scientist Magazine, February 9, 2015 (http://www.asianscientist.com/2015/02/topnews/ghit-funds-grand-challenges/), accessed on 10/20/2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explorations==
Launched in 2008, Grand Challenges Explorations, promotes invention in global health research. The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation committed $100 million and grants have already been awarded to 495 researchers from 42 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scangrants.com/files/pdfs/grant/2011/11/17/call-for-applications-grand-challenges-explorations-round-8.pdf|title=Grand Challenges Explorations}}{{dead link|date=July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{when|date=August 2013}}  Some grantees are pursuing radioactivity to kill infected cells, others are trying to develop a waterless toilet that is cost efficient as well as environmentally productive.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gatesfoundation.org/How-We-Work/Quick-Links/Grants-Database/Grants/2013/07/OPP1083134&lt;/ref&gt;

The Explorations grant initiative requires two short page applications but no preliminary data. Applications are submitted online. Initial grants of $100,000 are awarded two times a year. Successful projects have the opportunity to receive a follow-on grant of up to $1 million and could eventually evolve into Grand Challenges project.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grandchallenges.org/Explorations/Pages/Introduction.aspx|title= Rewarding Innovative Ideas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Ethical, social, and cultural issues ==
The key challenge associated with such large-scale research projects called for by the initiative is the addressing of ethical, social, and cultural (ESC) issues related to the Grand Challenges. Dr. [[Peter A. Singer]] and Dr. James Lavery and a team of colleagues are employing projects to address these barriers, but for the GCGH initiative to be successful, compliance and collaboration with this concept is absolutely critical.&lt;ref name=GH/&gt;

=== Project goal ===
The Ethical, Social, and Cultural Program of the Grand Challenges in Global Health, launched in 2005, is targeted to address the ethical, social, and cultural issues that may arise as a result of the initiative - either in the development of the research itself, or in the implementation of knowledge and technology by the communities in need. The GCGH ESC program is the first significant science project concentrated entirely on ESC issues linked to the developing world.&lt;ref name=ESC/&gt; ESC issues can have a series of consequences that involve new technologies and approaches: rejection of safety precautions or genetically modified foods, for example, because of culture sensitivity or perceived health, environmental, or economic risks. The ESC program assumes that science and technology are essential to global health development, but the appropriate development of this technology requires attention to the accompanying ethical, social and cultural issues. The program aims to link ESC activities with the research projects and to include voices from the developing world within these projects. Its two main goals are (1) to provide an advisory service for GCGH projects and (2) to create a research program to facilitate appropriate adoption in the long-term.{{clarify|date=April 2012|reason=adoption of the what?}} The Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation granted money{{specify|date=August 2013}} in November 2005 for the program to be carried out. The program is described and discussed at length in a series of four articles published in [[PLoS Medicine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/browse/issue/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fissue.pmed.v04.i09|title= Grand Challenges in Global Health|journal=PLoS Medicine|date= September 2007|volume=4|issue= 9|doi=10.1371/issue.pmed.v04.i09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In defining ESC issues, the program’s creators underwent a process of document analysis, group discussions with investigators and program staff, and interviews with experts from the developing world. The findings include thirteen issues that include: community engagement, public engagement, cultural acceptability, gender, post-trail obligations/benefit sharing, collaboration, the involvement of civil society organizations, affordability, accessibility, regulatory issues, collection, management, and storage of tissue samples, corruption and poor governance, and unintended consequences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Berndtson, Kathryn, Tina Daid, C. Shawn Tracy, Anant Bhan, Emma R. M. Cohen, Ross E. G. Upshur, Jerome A. Singh, Abdallah S. Daar, James V. Lavery, and Peter A. Singer|year=2007|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040268|title= Grand Challenges in Global Health: Ethical, Social, and Cultural Issues Based on Key Informant Perspectives|journal= PLoS Medicine|volume= 4|issue=9|pages=e268|pmid=17850176|pmc=1989735}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ESC advisory service was created to address ESC issues identified at the start of GCGH research projects, as well as challenges encountered as projects progress.&lt;ref name=ESC&gt;{{cite journal|author=Anant Bhan |year=2007 |title= Grand Challenges in Global Health: Engaging Civil Society Organizations in Biomedical Research in Developing Countries|journal=PLoS Med|volume=4|issue=9|doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040272|pages=e272|pmid=17850177|pmc=1989739}}&lt;/ref&gt; An advisory service co-leader and a lead bioethicist are assigned to each GCGH project. During the initial phase of communication, the co-leader and lead bioethicist define the issues and develop a strategy for addressing the challenge's issues based on their specific expertise. A process of consultation with the GCGH program officers has also been implemented to help identify issues within the challenges and its individual projects. The program officers often join the advisory service conference calls and offer expertise and insights that help anticipate ESC concerns.

=== Research program ===
The goal of the research program is to provide knowledge in order to facilitate the successful adoption of technology by GCGH's targeted communities. With working papers, working groups, global case studies, and demonstration projects on public engagement, research enhances the ESC expertise with respect to specific goals of the Grand Challenges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Singer, Peter A., Andrew D. Taylor, Abdallah S. Daar, Ross E. G. Upshur, Jerome A.Singh, and James V. Lavery |year=2007 |url=http://www.ploscollections.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040265 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120612105905/http://www.ploscollections.org/article/info%3Adoi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0040265 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-06-12 |title=Grand Challenges in Global Health: The Ethical, Social and Cultural Program |journal=PLoS Medicine |volume=4 |issue=9 |doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040265 |pages=e265 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==
As is the case with most health initiatives, the GCGH have been subject to a fair degree of criticism.

A very widely circulated critique was published in 2005 in ''[[The Lancet]]''. In the column, Anne-Emanuelle Birn, Sc.D., an associate professor of Public Health Sciences at the University of Toronto, described the initiative's role as "weak" for focusing too narrowly on the power of science and neglecting the importance of economic, social, and political factors. She cites the 20th century cultural obsession with technological advancement as one that cannot ignore the need to redistribute economic and social resources within impoverished communities. She suggests that rather than trying to finance, develop and distribute new and existing vaccines, a more sustainable effort might focus on public support for a universal, accessible public health system. She references Goal #4, which involves improved nutrition, as a specific challenge that is shortsighted and "overlooks key distributional questions". She explains that because malnutrition and famine are not the result of technical obstacles, but rather, political and economic ones, technology is not the answer. These issues are not about supply or the lack of nutritional value available in foods, but rather, poor income distribution and market shifts leading to populations unable to afford food.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Birn, Anne-Emanuelle|year=2005|url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(05)66479-3/fulltext|title= Gates’s Grandest Challenge: Transcending Technology as Public Health Ideology|journal= The Lancet|pages=514–519|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(05)66479-3|volume=366|pmid=16084261}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurie Garrett, in her article published in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'', says the main problem in global health was lack of resources but with the input of private players such as Bill and Melinda Gates, there has been a major contribution to pressing health issues such as HIV, Malaria, TB and others. Although these contributions are useful, they also highlight specific diseases which are more high-profile or research that may fascinate the public. The BMGF initiative may have provided funds for improving health care but this is not enough to improve public health, as education and an all-disease health system are needed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author= Garrett, Laurie|year=2007|jstor= 10.2307/20032209|title=The Challenge of Global Health|journal= Foreign Affairs|pages= 14–38|volume=86}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lewis Griffith Cresswell Evans Pugh''' (29 October 1909 –  22 December 1994), generally known as '''Griffith Pugh''', was a British physiologist and mountaineer. He was the expedition physiologist on the [[1953 British Mount Everest expedition|1953 British expedition]] that made the [[first ascent]] of [[Mount Everest]], and a researcher into the effects of cold and altitude on human physiology.

==Childhood, education and family==
Pugh's father was Lewis Pugh Evans Pugh [[Queen's Counsel|KC]], a Welsh barrister who practised in Calcutta,&lt;ref name=fail/&gt;&lt;ref name=indy&gt;{{cite news|last1=Milledge|first1=James S.|title=OBITUARIES: Griffith Pugh|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/obituaries-griffith-pugh-1569956.html|work=Independent|date=27 January 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; and who had two children: Griffith, and Gwladys Mary Pugh.&lt;ref name=peer1&gt;{{cite web|title=Person Page – 8267|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p8267.htm#i82664|website=The Peerage}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pugh went to [[Harrow School]], and between 1928 and 1931 took a degree in law at [[New College, Oxford University]], although he switched to medicine, which he studied for three more years, after which he qualified at [[St Thomas' Hospital]], London, in 1938, where he subsequently worked.&lt;ref name=AJ&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ward|first1=Michael|title=Lewis Griffith CressweIl Evans Pugh 1909–1994|journal=Alpine Journal|year=1995|pages=326–327|url=http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1995_files/AJ%201995%20325-345%20In%20Memoriam.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 September 1939, Pugh married Josephine Helen Cassel, daughter of Sir [[Felix Cassel]] and Lady Helen Grimston, and they had four children: David Sheridan Griffith Pugh, Simon Francis Pugh, 
Harriet Veronica Felicity Pugh (whose married name is Harriet Tuckey) and 
Oliver Lewis Evans Pugh.&lt;ref name=Peer2&gt;{{cite web|title=Person Page – 20706|url=http://www.thepeerage.com/p20706.htm#i207052|website=The Peerage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Skiing==
Pugh was a keen skier, learning the skill in the Swiss resort of [[Engelberg]] as a child,&lt;ref name=AJ2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Riddell|first1=W. J.|title=Lewis Griffith CressweIl Evans Pugh 1909–1994|journal=Alpine Journal|year=1995|pages=328–329|url=http://www.alpinejournal.org.uk/Contents/Contents_1995_files/AJ%201995%20325-345%20In%20Memoriam.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and later competing in the World Championships.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; He was selected to represent Britain in the [[1936 Winter Olympics]] in [[Garmisch-Partenkirchen]] in all three skiing disciplines but was unable to compete as a result of injury.&lt;ref name=AJ/&gt; He also made frequent trips to the [[Mont Blanc massif]] and the [[Bernese Oberland]] to climb.&lt;ref name=AJ/&gt;

==Wartime service==
Having served in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]] in Britain, Greece, Crete, Egypt, Ceylon, Iraq and Jerusalem,&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; Pugh was invited by fellow Harrovian W. J. Riddell, on the basis of his skiing and climbing expertise, to join the recently established School of Mountain Warfare at the Cedars resort in [[Lebanon]], working for two years alongside A. D. M. Cox (an Oxford don and a considerable alpinist in his own right) and John Carryer.&lt;ref name=AJ/&gt; Pugh wrote papers for the School that were later used in the Army Training Manual, did much ski mountaineering, often ascending 3,000 to 4,000 feet, crossing 20 miles on trips that lasted up to 12 hours in self-contained units that could be self-sufficient for over a week,&lt;ref name=AJ/&gt; and training troops to oppose crack German mountain formations.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

==Mountaineering and physiology==
After the war, Pugh worked in [[Hammersmith]] in clinical research at the Post-Graduate Medical School. His much-noted eccentricity was already evident, as when he attached electrodes to his body and submerged himself in an ice bath from which he had to be rescued as the cold had paralysed him.&lt;ref name=fail&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tuckey|first1=Harriet|title=The pyjama-clad hero robbed of Everest glory:|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2326727/The-pyjama-clad-hero-robbed-Everest-glory-The-bizarre-story-genius-helped-Hillary-summit-60-years-ago--wearing-night-clothes.html|work=Daily Mail|date=18 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved in 1950 to the [[Medical Research Council (United Kingdom)|Medical Research Council]] laboratories in [[Hampstead]] to work under Professor Otto Edholm in the Department of Human Physiology as head of the Laboratory of Field Physiology.&lt;ref name=AJ/&gt; He stayed there for the rest of his career.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

===Cho Oyo 1952===
Expedition leader [[Eric Shipton]] invited Pugh, now on the High Altitude Committee of the Medical Research Council,{{sfn|Hunt, p. 23}} to accompany the [[Mount Everest reconnaissance from Nepal#1952 Cho Oyu reconnaissance|British 1952 Cho Oyo expedition]] to perform research on oxygen equipment that would be useful on the following year's expedition to [[Mount Everest]]. Pugh realised that the best way to do this was to study climbers in the field at altitude, and he analysed rates of breathing, and food and fluid intake. His report on his findings was, according to [[George Band]], a climber on the 1953 Mount Everest expedition, of "fundamental value" to that expedition.{{sfn|Band, p. 115}} These included the need to drink considerably more than the usual three or four pints of liquid per day;{{sfn|Band, p. 115}} on Mount Everest Hunt reports that Pugh's advice was that they drink six or seven pints of fluid a day.{{sfn|Hunt, p. 83}} In June 1952, Pugh reported to the [[Joint Himalayan Committee]] that the failure of the Swiss on Mount Everest in the spring of that year suggested that the British, who he deemed to be less fit and less experienced mountaineers, therefore needed to be supplied with "only the best oxygen equipment ... to put up a better performance than the Swiss".{{sfn|Band, p. 120}}

===Mount Everest 1953===
{{main|1953 British Mount Everest expedition}}
Pugh accompanied the Mount Everest expedition as field physiologist under the sponsorship of the Medical Research Council,{{sfn|Hunt, p. 29}} although he did not travel with the main party, which left England for India in February 1953 aboard the S.S. ''Stratheden''. As well as the oxygen equipment, which he developed alongside [[Tom Bourdillon]],{{sfn|Band, p. 120}}  much of the other high-altitude equipment – boots, tents, clothing, stoves and airbeds – was designed by him.{{sfn|Hunt, p. 37}}&lt;ref name=fail/&gt; Pugh also designed the diet, which included 400g of sugar a day for the assault party, most of which "astonishing amount", according to Band, was consumed by the Sherpas in their tea.{{sfn|Band, p. 135}} In addition to his research on Cho Oyo, Pugh had taken part in tests of the oxygen equipment in a decompression chamber at the [[Royal Aircraft Establishment]] in [[Farnborough, Hampshire|Farnborough]], where according to Hunt he displayed symptoms of anoxia when taken to the artificial height of 29,000&amp;nbsp;ft and had his oxygen mask removed;{{sfn|Hunt, pp. 50–1}} Band records his "spasmodic twitching" and attempts to prevent the instructor to replace his mask".{{sfn|Band, p. 130}} Pugh arranged for the use of "sleeping oxygen" at higher camps, where one oxygen bottle supplied two men through masks of the type used by [[British Overseas Airways Corporation|BOAC]]; Pugh was with Hunt at Camp IV, where Hunt reported a restful night using the system.{{sfn|Hunt, p. 147}}

Pugh's scientific equipment was carried from Kathmandu to [[Everest Base Camp]] in a "shining aluminium trunk of coffin-like dimensions",{{sfn|Hunt, p. 65}} and during the walk-in he subjected expedition members to a number of physiological tests, including a "maximum work test", which involved going uphill as fast as possible and then breathing into a bag on collapsing exhausted at the top.{{sfn|Hunt, p. 71}} He continued these tests at the camp at [[Tengboche|Thyangboche]], where he set up his physiological tent, which contained scales, medical tools, thermometers and other equipment.{{sfn|Hunt, p. 78}} His dress for the walk-in was pyjamas, a deerstalker's hat and sunglasses;{{sfn|Hunt, p. 71}} he wore these pyjamas at the reception given by the King of Nepal at the expedition's end.{{sfn|Hunt, p. 224}} Band accounts for them by stating that Pugh was protecting his fair skin from the sun, which suffered badly before he started wearing them, and relates that the Sherpas treated him as the expedition's "holy man" on account of his appearance and his "absent-minded" air.{{sfn|Band, p. 136}}

Pugh was part of the first party to ascend from Thyangboche to find a route through the [[Khumbu Icefall]].{{sfn|Band, p. 141}}

In ''Everest – The First Ascent: The Untold Story of Griffith Pugh, the Man Who Made It Possible'' by Pugh's daughter Harriet Tuckey, published in 2013, Tuckey argues that her father was  given insufficient credit in the official accounts of the first ascent – ''The Ascent of Everest'' by expedition leader [[John Hunt, Baron Hunt|John Hunt]] and the film ''The Conquest of Everest'' – for his role in making it possible. These accounts stressed the derring-do and "grit and determination" of the expedition team, while simultaneously downplaying the important role that science, in particular the science of Pugh, played.&lt;ref name=spec&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kavenna|first1=Joanna|title=Everest, by Harriet Tuckey|url=http://www.spectator.co.uk/books/8919701/everest-by-harriet-tuckey/|work=The Spectator|date=1 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, in the film, Pugh was depicted as a mad scientist, 
"belittled, his work passed over without mention", because to the British establishment of the time, Tuckey maintains, science was perceived as unheroic and to stress its key role would have undermined the heroism of the ascent.&lt;ref name=spec/&gt; In a section of George Band's ''Everest: 50 Years on Top of the World'' (2003) entitled "Why Did We Succeed?", Band lists among the factors "the research of those, such as Griff Pugh, Dr Bradley and the developers of our oxygen sets who all helped to endure that our acclimatization, clothing and equipment were better than ever before".{{sfn|Band, p. 174}}

==="Silver Hut" expedition 1960–61===
Having been on three previous expedition with [[Edmund Hillary]], the New Zealand mountaineer invited him in 1960–61 on a nine-month-long expedition to the Himalaya on which the long-term effects of altitude on human physiology were studied. A prefabricated hut was carried up to an altitude of 5,800m and experiments on the cardiac and pulmonary response to a prolonged period at altitude were carried out.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt; Here Pugh showed that Mount Everest could be climbed without oxygen, which was shown to be the case by [[Reinhold Messner]] and [[Peter Habeler]] in their ascent of 1978.&lt;ref name=AJ/&gt; An attempt was also made to climb the world's fifth-highest mountain, [[Makalu]], but it was unsuccessful.

==Polar work 1956–57==
Pugh was invited by the University of California's Nello Pace in 1956–57 to the [[Scott Base]] in [[Antarctica]] to carry out research into [[carbon monoxide]] poisoning in huts and tents, the adaptation to and tolerance of cold, and the warming effect of solar radiation.&lt;ref name=indy/&gt;

According to the [[Government of Brazil|Brazilian Government]], the most serious health problems are:&lt;ref&gt;Ministério do Planejamento website, [http://www.planejamento.gov.br/planejamento_investimento/conteudo/radarsocial/saude.htm "Saúde" (fact sheet, 2002)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107174329/http://www.planejamento.gov.br/planejamento_investimento/conteudo/radarsocial/saude.htm |date=2006-01-07 }}. Retrieved 12 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Childhood mortality: about 1.51% of childhood mortality, reaching 2.77% in the northeast region.
* Motherhood mortality: about 42.1 deaths per 100,000 born children in 2016.
* Mortality by non-transmissible illness: 65.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by heart and circulatory diseases, along with 26.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants caused by cancer.
* Mortality caused by external causes (transportation, violence and suicide): 55.7 deaths per 100,000 inhabitants (10.9% of all deaths in the country), reaching 62.3 deaths in the southeast region.

In 2002, Brazil accounted for 40% of [[malaria]] cases in the Americas.&lt;ref name="malaria"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rbm.who.int/wmr2005/profiles/brazil.pdf|title=World Health Organization: Brazil: Malaria|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120916051914/http://rbm.who.int/wmr2005/profiles/brazil.pdf|archivedate=2012-09-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 99% are concentrated in the Legal Amazon Region, which is home to not more than 12% of the population.&lt;ref name="malaria"/&gt;

==Life expectancy==
The [[life expectancy]] of the [[Brazilian people|Brazilian population]] increased from 71.16 years in 1998 to 76.2 years in 2016, according to the [[Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics]] (IBGE).&lt;ref&gt;[http://g1.globo.com/economia/seu-dinheiro/noticia/2015/12/com-revisao-na-expectativa-de-vida-valor-de-novas-aposentadorias-cai.html]&lt;/ref&gt; The data indicate a significant progress compared with 55.50 years in 1940. According to the IBGE, Brazil will need some time to catch up with [[Japan]], [[Hong Kong]] (China), [[Switzerland]], [[Iceland]], [[Australia]], [[France]] and [[Italy]], where the average life expectancy is already over 81. Research has shown that [[Brazil]] would achieve that level by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;From the IBGE's Complete Mortality Tables for Brazil's population, which have been published annually since 1999. They are used by the [[Ministry (government)|Ministry]] of [[social security|Social Security]] as one of the parameters for the retirement fund factor under the General System of Social Security.[http://english.peopledaily.com.cn/90001/90782/6830022.html Life Expectancy in Brazil (2008)]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Demographic]] [[Forecasting|projection]]s foresee the continuation of this process, estimating a life expectancy in Brazil around 77.4 years in 2020. The decline in [[mortality rate|mortality]] at young ages and the increase in [[longevity]], combined with the decline of [[fecundity]] and the accentuated increase of degenerative chronic diseases, caused a rapid process of demographic and epidemiologic transition, imposing a new public health agenda in the face of the complexity of the new morbidity pattern.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0102-311X2005000700002 Demographic projections in Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infant mortality==
[[File:Hospital Infantil Cândido Fontoura.jpg|thumb|right|Cândido Fontoura Children's Hospital, [[São Paulo]].]]
[[Child]] [[health]] is a central issue on the public [[policy]] agenda of [[developing countries]]. Several policies geared to improving child health have been implemented over the years, with varying degrees of success. In Brazil, such policies have led to a significant decline in [[infant mortality]] rates over the last 30 years. Despite this improvement, however, [[mortality rate]]s are still high by international standards and there is substantial variation across Brazilian municipalities, which suggests that differentiated policies should be devised. For example, mortality among indigenous infants in 2000 was more than triple that of the general population, highlighting the importance of tailored health policies to address disparities in health outcomes for Brazil's Indigenous Peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Coelho|first=V|author2=Shankland, A.|title=Making The Right To Health A Reality For Brazil’s Indigenous Peoples: Innovation, Decentralization And Equity|journal=MEDICC Review|year=2011|volume=13|issue=3|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/making-the-right-to-health-a-reality-for-brazils-indigenous.html|accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sanitation]], [[education]] and [[per capita income]] are the most important explanatory factors of poor child health in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iadb.org/res/publications/pubfiles/pubR-493.pdf History - Infant Mortality - Brazil]&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, ethnographic findings of infant mortality rates (IMR) in northeast Brazil are not accurate because the government tends to overlook infant morality rates in rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nations|first=Marilyn K.|author2=Mara Lucia Amaral|title=Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality|journal=Medical Anthropology Quarterly|year=1991|volume=5|issue=4|pages=204–220|doi=10.1525/maq.1991.5.3.02a00020}}&lt;!--|accessdate=22 September 2012--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; These issues tend to be inaccurate due to a huge amount of underreporting and causes us to question the cultural validity and the contextual soundness of these mortality statistics. There is a solution to this issue however and scientists stress that quality local-level cultural data can serve to craft as the alternative and appropriate method to measure infant death in Brazil accurately. In order to not overlook infant mortality rates it is also stressed that there needs to be a focus on an ethnography of experience, a vision that cuts to the core of human suffering as it flows from daily life and experiences. For example, one must get down to the flesh, blood and souls of infant death in the impoverished households of Brazilians in order to understand and live with those who have to suffer its tragic consequences. Methods of gathering mortality data also need to be respectful of local death customs and must be implemented in places where death is experienced through a different cultural lens.&lt;ref&gt;Nations, Marilyn K.; Mara Lucia Amaral (1991). "Flesh, Blood, Souls, and Households: Cultural Validity in Mortality". Medical Anthropology Quarterly 5 (4): 204-220.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[UNICEF]] [[report]] shows a rising rate of survival for Brazilian children under the age of five. UNICEF says that out of a total of 195 [[countries]] analyzed, [[Brazil]] is among the 25 [[nation]]s with the best improvement in survival rates for children under the age of 5. The report shows that Brazil's infant mortality rate for live [[birth]]s in 2012 was 14 per thousand. Mortality rates for children at one year of age was 18 per thousand, a reduction of 60%. The study went on to show that malnutrition among children of less than two years of age during the period between 2000 and 2008 fell by 77%. There was also a substantial drop in the number of [[school]] age children who were not in school, falling from 920,000 to 570,000 during the same period. Cristina Albuquerque, coordinator of the UNICEF Infant Survival and Development Program called the numbers "an enormous victory" for Brazil. She added that with regard to public policy aimed at reducing social disparities, Brazil's [[Bolsa Família]] program had become an international benchmark in combating poverty, reducing vulnerability and improving quality of life. "Brazil is going through a great moment, but much remains to be done. So, along with the celebrating it is a good time to reflect on the many challenges still to be overcome," Albuquerque declared.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agenciabrasil.gov.br/news-in-english/2009/12/17/materia.2009-12-17.0817559779/view Infant Mortality in Brazil (2009)]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Karanda Mission Hospital''' was established in 1961 to meet the needs of mission stations in the [[Zambezi River]] valley which were established as churches and then, as the abundant health care challenges were seen, small dispensaries/clinics were developed along with the churches (then came schools). To help the clinics, the hospital was built. Karanda is in a remote area of northern [[Zimbabwe]] nearest to [[Mount Darwin, Zimbabwe|Mount Darwin]]. Its location is approximately {{convert|200|km|mi}} from the capital, [[Harare]].

The mission complex has a nurse training school for around 55 students and a primary school offering grades 1-7 for children of the hospital staff. The hospital also offers a home-based care program that works with the Evangelical church, a [[non-denominational]] church very similar in doctrine to the Evangelical Free church in the US.

The hospital is licensed for 150 beds and on an average work day sees between 10–20 surgeries and 200–300 outpatients. The hospital's inpatient capacity is 90% full most of the time. The facility is known for the large number of surgical cases it handles as well as treating [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]], [[obstetrics]], and [[hydrocephalus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Stephens|first=Daniel|title=Head Surgeon at Karanda|url=http://www.karanda.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Belz|first=Mindy|title=Long hours and little thanks|url=http://www.worldmag.com/articles/17402|work=www.worldmag.com|accessdate=28 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samaritan's Purse International Relief website, at http://www.samaritanspurse.org/medical/karanda-mission-hospital-mt-darwin-zimbabwe/ .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Physicians Aiding Physicians Abroad website, at http://papamissions.org/portfolio/karanda-mission-hospital-in-zimbabwe/ .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Team Zimbabwe website, at https://zimbabwe.team.org/ .&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Patients flock to Karanda hospital," May 12, 2013,  in ''The Standard'' (Zimbabwe) online, at http://www.thestandard.co.zw/2013/05/12/patients-flock-to-karanda-hospital/ .&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kardzhali Reservoir''' is a  [[reservoir]] formed by the [[Kardzhali Dam]], situated less than 1&amp;nbsp;km to the west of the town of [[Kardzhali]] in [[Kardzhali Province]], [[Bulgaria]]. It is the second largest reservoir by volume in the country.

The dam was constructed between 1957 and 1963 and was commissioned into service in the year of its completion. The reservoir has water catchment area of 1182&amp;nbsp;km² and maximum volume of 539.9 million m3. When it is filled to its maximum capacity the reservoir covers are of 16.07&amp;nbsp;km² and its surface has elevation of 324.3 meters above the sea level. The Hydroelectric Power Plant is situated at the foot of the dam.

The reservoir was recently seeded artificially with [[European perch]]. The fish was taken from the [[Ovcharitsa]] reservoir.

The first historical moment of the reservoir was in the 1970s, when it was artificially seeded with [[Wels catfish|catfish]]. Nowadays there are 100&amp;nbsp;kg representatives. Later, 45,000 [[carp]] were introduced into the reservoir as well.

[[File:Klement Jug.jpg|thumb|right|225px|Klement Jug]]
'''Klement Jug''' (19 November 1898 – 11 August 1924) was a [[Slovenes|Slovene]] [[philosopher]], [[essayist]] and [[mountaineer]] who died while climbing Mount [[Triglav]]. Although he did not publish many works during his lifetime, he became one of the most influential thinkers of the younger generations of Slovenian intellectuals in the [[interwar period]].

== Life ==
Jug was born in a wealthy peasant-merchant family in [[Solkan]], [[Slovenia]], then a suburb of the [[Austro-Hungarian]] town of [[Gorizia]]. He attended the grammar school in Gorizia and then enrolled at the [[University of Ljubljana]] where he studied philosophy under the supervision of the Slovene [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologist]] philosopher [[France Veber]]. A fervent reader of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], [[Nietzsche]] and [[Freud]], Jug developed his own philosophy based on the supremacy of the [[Will (philosophy)|will]] and the unappealable adherence to [[ethics]] and personal responsibility.

Since young age, Jug also practiced extreme [[alpinism]], in which he saw a way to practice the effort self-control. In one of his solitary excursions to the [[Julian Alps]], he died by falling from the northern face of Mount [[Triglav]].

== Legacy ==

Jug left very few written works. During his lifetime, he published only a few essays, while several philosophic and ethical reflections have been found as manuscripts after his death and published [[List of works published posthumously|posthumous]]ly by his closest friends. Nevertheless, his influence has been relatively big. He was considered to be the ideological leader of the younger generations of Slovene students from the [[Julian March]], the western Slovenian region which came under [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)|Italian]] administration after [[World War I]]. These youngsters rejected any compromises with [[Italian Fascist]]s and urged for a radical and organized resistance against the policies of [[Fascist Italianization]]. Many of them found in Jug the source for their intellectual and personal inspiration. 

Among Jug's direct disciples were the famous novelist [[Vladimir Bartol]] and [[Zorko Jelinčič]], one of the co-founders of the [[Militant anti-fascism|militant anti-fascist]] organization [[TIGR]]. Already in 1925, the two organized the first seminar dedicated to Jug's memory in the village of [[Krn (village)|Krn]] near [[Kobarid]], in which they discussed the issues of Jug's [[Voluntaryism|voluntaristic]] world view. Due to the effort of Jug's colleagues, his posthumous fame spread in the intellectual circles of interwar Slovenia. The list of his admirors included the author, politician and diplomat [[Anton Novačan]], the poet [[Oton Župančič]], the playwrights [[Pavel Golia]] and [[Ivan Mrak]], and the poet and political activist [[Edvard Kocbek]].

Many prominent Slovene thinkers and artists have published their reflections over Jug's fate, including the literary critic [[Josip Vidmar]], the novelist Vladimir Bartol, philosopher [[Milan Komar]], essayist [[Jože Javoršek]], and philosopher and literary critic [[Taras Kermauner]]. Jug has also influenced the strong Slovenian mountaineer subculture and the literature which emerged from it; authors who have been influenced by Klement Jug include [[Igor Škamperle]] and [[Dušan Jelinčič]]. The controversial Slovenian psychologist and therapist [[Janez Rugelj]] also wrote on Jug, taking him as a positive example of a self-made man. The sociologist [[Lev Milčinski]], on the other hand, analyzed Jug as an example of a self-destructive and [[suicidal]] personality.

In 1988, the writer and playwright [[Drago Jančar]] portraited Jug in the play "Klement's Fall" (''Klementov padec''). In 2006, a documentary on Klement Jug was filmed and broadcast on [[Slovenian National Television]]. A popular Alpine lodge in the upper [[Soča]] Valley is named after him.

'''Leslie Enraught Keeley''', [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] (June 10, 1836 – February 21, 1900) was an [[United States|American]] physician, originator of the [[Keeley Cure]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/timeline/gold_cure_for_alcoholism.htm |title=Gold Cure for the Liquor Habit |date= |accessdate=2014-01-18 |quote= |publisher=[[Nebraska State Historical Society]] |location= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
He was born in [[Potsdam, New York]] on June 10, 1836.&lt;ref&gt;The [[American National Biography]] uses the year 1832. The [[National Cyclopaedia of American Biography]] uses 1834. His passport applications consistently use the date June 10, 1836. The 1880 US Census uses 1836. The [[Virtual International Authority File]] uses 1842.&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeley graduated at the [[Rush Medical College]], [[Chicago]], in 1863, and later entered the [[Union Army]] as a [[Surgery|surgeon]].   At the end of the war he moved to [[Dwight, Illinois]], where he began his private medical practice.  There, in 1880, he opened a [[sanatorium]] for persons addicted to the immoderate use of [[alcoholic beverage|alcohol]] and [[opium]]. He asserted  that "Alcoholism is a disease and I can cure it." His treatment centered on a secret preparation that he said contained [[bichloride of gold]]. However, chemical analysis revealed that the proprietary tonic contained 27.55% alcohol plus [[ammonium chloride]], [[aloin]] and tincture of [[cinchona]] but no gold. His hypodermic injections contained sulfate of [[strychnine]], [[atropine]] and [[boracic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Keeley 'gold cure' for inebriety|journal= British Medical Journal|year=1892|page= 85|doi= 10.1136/bmj.2.1645.85 |volume=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;James Roosevelt, [https://archive.org/details/insicknessandin00roosgoog In Sickness and Health]. Appleton, 1896, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1890, Keeley began selling franchises and by 1893 there were 92 Keeley Institutes in the US, Canada, and Mexico&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lib.unb.ca/archives/finding/keeley.html University of New Brunswick Archives &amp; Special Collections-The Leslie E. Keeley Institutes of the Maritime Provinces Company (Fredericton, N.B.) fonds]. Lib.unb.ca. Retrieved on 2012-04-21.&lt;/ref&gt; and that number grew to over 200 and expanded to Europe.&lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.www.nebraskahistory.org/publish/publicat/timeline/keeley_cure.html] {{dead link|date=April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

In 1939, [[Time Magazine|''Time'' magazine]] reported that "Unvarying is the traditional Keeley routine.  An incoming inebriate pays $160, plus room and board, must stay for 31 days. His weekly whiskey ration is gradually tapered off: eight ounces the first day, six ounces the second, four ounces the third, none from there on. Four times a day he gets gold chloride injections; every two hours he takes a tonic." &lt;ref&gt;Keeley cure, Time, September 25, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; At its  height, the clinic in Dwight treated 700 patients per day.&lt;ref name=wsj&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=If Dr. Keeley Could See You Now |url=https://online.wsj.com/news/articles/SB119906066755458505 |quote=In the late 19th century, Dr. Keeley claimed he had invented a scientific cure for alcoholism with a 95% success rate. His Keeley Institute in the small town of Dwight, Ill., was the Betty Ford Center of the era. At its peak, the institute treated some 700 patients a day, and 'gone to Dwight' became shorthand for checking into rehab. |newspaper=[[Wall Street Journal]] |date=December 31, 2007 |accessdate=2014-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeley claimed that when his medicine was administered according to his directions, it had no injurious effects and that 95 per cent of the patients were permanently cured.  If they did return to drinking, he insisted that they were cured but that they drank because they choose to do so, not because they were still addicted.&lt;ref name=wsj/&gt; However, it was later noted that a "high percentage of those "cured" had relapsed."&lt;ref name="Reznicek 2012"&gt;Reznicek, Michael J. (2012). ''Blowing Smoke: Rethinking the War on Drugs Without Prohibition and Rehab''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers, Inc. p. 11. {{ISBN|978-1-4422-1516-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keeley published numerous articles in the popular press in addition to pamphlets promoting his therapy, and wrote ''The Morphine Eater, or From Bondage to Freedom'' (1881) and the ''Non-Heredity of Inebriety'' (1896).

He died on February 21, 1900 in [[Los Angeles, California]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=Author Of Keeley Cure Dead. Dr. Leslie E.

Keeley was widely cited as a quack. A 1908 article in the ''Illinois Medical Journal'' stated that "Leslie Keeley was a common, ordinary quack with a useless remedy which made good by advertising and catching suckers."&lt;ref&gt;The Illinois Medical Journal, Volume 14.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4875">'''Luis Simarro Lacabra''' (6 January 1851 &amp;ndash; 19 June 1921) was a Spanish [[psychiatrist]] who was born in [[Rome]] while his parents were living in Italy. 

He studied medicine in [[Valencia, Spain|Valencia]] and [[Madrid]], and in 1877 was appointed director of the Santa Isabel insane asylum at [[Leganés]], outside of Madrid. From 1880 he lived in [[Paris]] and studied general [[anatomy]] and [[histology]] with [[Louis-Antoine Ranvier]] and clinical [[neurology]] under [[Jean Martin Charcot]]. Here he also came under the influence of philosopher [[Ernest Renan]] (1823–1892). anatomist [[Mathias-Marie Duval]] (1844–1907) and psychiatrist [[Valentin Magnan]] (1835–1916). In 1885 he returned to Madrid and opened a private practice, and in 1902 was appointed to the first chair of [[experimental psychology]] in Spain.

[[File:Portrait of Dr Simarro at the microscope.JPG|thumb|''Portrait of Dr Simarro at the microscope'', 1897, (Luis Simarro Legacy Trust, Fundación General, Complutense University)]]

As a psychiatrist, Simarro was heavily influenced by developments in Germany, particularly [[Emil Kraepelin]]'s classification and treatment of the insane, [[Wilhelm Wundt]]'s theory of [[experimental psychology]] and [[Theodor Ziehen]]'s critical analysis of Wundt's approach to psychology. 

Notwithstanding his work in psychiatry, Simarro is largely remembered for a contribution made in histology when he developed a [[silver bromide]] modification of [[Camillo Golgi]]'s [[silver chromate]] technique. Famed Spanish histologist [[Ramon y Cajal]] recognized Simarro's achievement, and mentioned that it was a milestone that allowed him to abandon general histology and to focus on neurohistology.

'''Lycopene''' (from the [[New Latin language|neo-Latin]] ''[[Lycopersicum]]'', the tomato species) is a bright red [[carotene]] and [[carotenoid]] pigment and [[phytochemical]] found in [[tomato]]es and other red fruits and vegetables, such as red [[carrot]]s, [[watermelon]]s, [[gac]], and [[papaya]]s, but it is not in [[Strawberry|strawberries]] or [[Cherry|cherries]].&lt;ref name=nd/&gt; Although lycopene is chemically a carotene, it has no [[vitamin A]] activity.&lt;ref name="lpi"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lpi.oregonstate.edu/mic/dietary-factors/phytochemicals/carotenoids|title=Carotenoids: α-Carotene, β-Carotene, β-Cryptoxanthin, Lycopene, Lutein, and Zeaxanthin|publisher=Micronutrient Information Center, Linus Pauling Institute, Oregon State University, Corvallis, OR|date=July 2016|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foods that are not red may also contain lycopene, such as [[asparagus]] and [[parsley]].&lt;ref name="nd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nutritiondata.self.com/foods-000137000000000000000-4w.html?|title=Foods highest in lycopene, Nutrition Data, USDA Nutrient Database, version SR-21|publisher=Conde Nast|website=nutritiondata.com|date=2014|accessdate=2014-08-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lycopene is a symmetrical [[terpene|tetraterpene]] assembled from eight [[isoprene]] units. It is a member of the carotenoid family of compounds, and because it consists entirely of carbon and hydrogen, is also a [[carotene]].&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; Isolation procedures for lycopene were first reported in 1910, and the structure of the molecule was determined by 1931. In its natural, all-''trans'' form, the molecule is long and straight, constrained by its system of 11 conjugated double bonds. Each extension in this [[conjugated system]] reduces the energy required for electrons to transition to higher [[energy state]]s, allowing the molecule to absorb visible light of progressively longer wavelengths. Lycopene absorbs all but the longest wavelengths of visible light, so it appears red.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;

Plants and photosynthetic bacteria naturally produce all-''trans'' lycopene.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; When exposed to light or heat, lycopene can undergo [[isomerization]] to any of a number of ''cis''-isomers, which have a bent rather than linear shape. Different isomers were shown to have different stabilities due to their molecular energy (highest stability: 5-cis ≥ all-trans ≥ 9-cis ≥ 13-cis &gt; 15-cis &gt; 7-cis &gt; 11-cis: lowest).&lt;ref&gt;Chasse ''et al.'' Journal of Molecular Structure: THEOCHEM, Volume 571, Number 1, 27 August 2001 , pp. 27-37(11)[http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/els/01661280/2001/00000571/00000001/art00424]&lt;/ref&gt; In human blood, various ''cis''-isomers constitute more than 60% of the total lycopene concentration, but the biological effects of individual isomers have not been investigated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=16046737|year=2005|author1=Erdman Jr|first1=J.

[[Image:Carotenoid synthetic pathway.svg|thumb|Lycopene is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of many carotenoids.]]

Carotenoids like lycopene are found in [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] pigment-protein complexes in plants, photosynthetic bacteria, fungi, and algae.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; They are responsible for the bright orange&amp;ndash;red colors of fruits and vegetables, perform various functions in photosynthesis, and protect photosynthetic organisms from excessive light damage. Lycopene is a key intermediate in the biosynthesis of carotenoids, such as [[beta-carotene]], and [[xanthophyll]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last=NDSU Agriculture | title=What Color is Your Food? |url=http://www.ag.ndsu.edu/pubs/yf/foods/fn595w.htm | accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biosynthesis===
The unconditioned biosynthesis of lycopene in eukaryotic plants and in prokaryotic cyanobacteria is similar, as are the enzymes involved.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; Synthesis begins with [[mevalonic acid]], which is converted into [[dimethylallyl pyrophosphate]].  This is then condensed with three molecules of [[isopentenyl pyrophosphate]] (an isomer of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate), to give the 20-carbon [[geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate]].  Two molecules of this product are then condensed in a tail-to-tail configuration to give the 40-carbon [[phytoene]], the first committed step in carotenoid biosynthesis.  Through several desaturation steps, phytoene is converted into lycopene.  The two terminal isoprene groups of lycopene can be cyclized to produce beta-carotene, which can then be transformed into a wide variety of xanthophylls.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;

===Staining and removal===
Lycopene is the [[pigment]] in tomato-containing sauces, turning plastic cookware orange, and is insoluble in water. It can be dissolved only in organic solvents and oils. Because of its nonpolarity, lycopene in food preparations will stain any sufficiently [[porosity|porous]] material, including most plastics. To remove this staining, the plastics can be soaked in a solution containing a small amount of household bleach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/chris-barnes/how-to-clean-tomato-sauce_b_1521201.html|title=How To Clean Tomato Sauce Stains From Plastic Storage Containers|author=Barnes, Chris|date=11 October 2011|publisher=The Huffington Post|accessdate=29 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diet==
===Consumption by humans===

Absorption of lycopene requires that it be combined with [[bile salts]] and fat to form [[micelle]]s.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; Intestinal absorption  of lycopene is enhanced by the presence of fat and by cooking.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; Lycopene [[dietary supplement]]s (in oil) may be more efficiently absorbed than lycopene from food.&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt;

Lycopene is not an [[essential nutrient]] for humans, but is commonly found in the diet mainly from dishes prepared from tomatoes.&lt;ref name=nd/&gt;&lt;ref name=lpi/&gt; The median and 99th percentile of dietary lycopene intake have been estimated to be 5.2 and 123&amp;nbsp;mg/d, respectively.&lt;ref name="pmid16046742"/&gt;

Cooking and crushing tomatoes (as in the [[canning]] process) and serving in oil-rich dishes (such as [[spaghetti]] sauce or [[pizza]]) greatly increases assimilation from the digestive tract into the bloodstream. Lycopene is fat-soluble, so the oil is said to help absorption. Gac has high lycopene content derived mainly from its [[seed coat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Safety===
In humans, the Observed Safe Level for lycopene is 75&amp;nbsp;mg/day, according to one preliminary study.&lt;ref name="pmid16814439"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shao A, Hathcock JN | title = Risk assessment for the carotenoids lutein and lycopene | journal = Regulatory Toxicology and Pharmacology : RTP | volume = 45 | issue = 3 | pages = 289–98 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16814439 | doi = 10.1016/j.yrtph.2006.05.007 | url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0273-2300(06)00092-4 | accessdate = 2016-07-17 | quote = &lt;small&gt;The OSL risk assessment method indicates that the evidence of safety is strong at intakes up to 20mg/d for lutein, and '''75 mg/d for lycopene''', and these levels are identified as the respective OSLs.

===Adverse effects===
[[File:Lycopene in DCM.jpg|thumb|right|100px|Test tube containing a dichloromethane solution of lycopene]]

Lycopene is non-toxic and commonly found in the diet, mainly from tomato products. There are cases of intolerance or allergic reaction to dietary lycopene, which may cause [[diarrhea]], [[nausea]], stomach pain or cramps, gas, and loss of appetite.&lt;ref name="mayo"&gt;{{cite web

Lycopene may affect the [[immune system]], the [[nervous system]], sensitivity to sunlight, or drugs used for stomach ailments.&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt;

[[Lycopenemia]] is an orange discoloration of the skin that is observed with high intakes of lycopene.&lt;ref name="pmid16046742"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Trumbo PR | title = Are there adverse effects of lycopene exposure? | journal = The Journal of Nutrition | volume = 135 | issue = 8 | pages = 2060S–1S | year = 2005 | pmid = 16046742 | doi = 10.1093/jn/135.8.2060s| url = http://jn.nutrition.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=16046742 | accessdate = 2017-12-03 | quote = &lt;small&gt;Lycopenemia, characterized by an orange discoloration of the skin, has been observed with high intakes of lycopene-containing foods.

Although there was evidence of lycopene and fatty deposits in the liver, there was an absence of measurable hepatic dysfunction. After 3 wk of consuming a diet free of tomato juice, the orange discoloration faded.&lt;/small&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The discoloration is expected to fade after discontinuing excessive lycopene intake.&lt;ref name="pmid16046742"/&gt;

==Regulatory status in Europe and the United States==

In a review of literature on lycopene and its potential role as a dietary antioxidant, the [[European Food Safety Authority]] concluded that   evidence was insufficient for lycopene having antioxidant effects in humans, particularly in skin, heart function, or vision protection from [[ultraviolet light]].&lt;ref name="efsa"&gt;{{cite journal|journal=EFSA Journal|volume=9|issue=4|year=2011|title=Scientific Opinion on the substantiation of health claims related to lycopene and protection of DNA, proteins and lipids from oxidative damage (ID 1608, 1609, 1611, 1662, 1663, 1664, 1899, 1942, 2081, 2082, 2142, 2374), protection of the skin from UV-induced (including photo-oxidative) damage (ID 1259, 1607, 1665, 2143, 2262, 2373), contribution to normal cardiac function (ID 1610, 2372), and maintenance of normal vision (ID 1827) pursuant to Article 13(1) of Regulation (EC) No 1924/2006|doi=10.2903/j.efsa.2011.2031 |page=2031}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although lycopene from tomatoes has been tested in humans for cardiovascular diseases and prostate cancer, no effect on any disease was found.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|title=Qualified Health Claims: Letter Regarding Tomatoes and Prostate Cancer (Lycopene Health Claim Coalition) (Docket No. 2004Q-0201)|publisher=US Food and Drug Administration|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/IngredientsPackagingLabeling/LabelingNutrition/ucm072767.htm|date=8 November 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), in rejecting manufacturers' requests in 2005 to allow "qualified labeling" for lycopene and the reduction of various cancer risks, provided a conclusion that remains in effect {{Asof|2017|lc=y}}:

"...no studies provided information about whether lycopene intake may reduce the risk of any of the specific forms of cancer. Based on the above, FDA concludes that there is no credible evidence supporting a relationship between lycopene consumption, either as a food ingredient, a component of food, or as a dietary supplement, and any of these cancers."

==Research and potential health effects==

A 2017 review concluded that tomato products and lycopene supplementation had small positive effects on [[Circulatory system|cardiovascular]] [[risk factor]]s, such as elevated [[blood lipids]] and [[blood pressure]].&lt;ref name="ChengKoutsidis2017"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cheng|first1=Ho Ming|last2=Koutsidis|first2=Georgios|last3=Lodge|first3=John K.|last4=Ashor|first4=Ammar|last5=Siervo|first5=Mario|last6=Lara|first6=José|title=Tomato and lycopene supplementation and cardiovascular risk factors: A systematic review and meta-analysis|journal=Atherosclerosis|volume=257|year=2017|pages=100–108|issn=00219150|doi=10.1016/j.atherosclerosis.2017.01.009|pmid=28129549}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 review concluded that research has been insufficient to establish whether lycopene consumption affects human health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3850026|year=2010|author1=Story|first1=E.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9749">'''Medical social work''' is a sub-discipline of [[social work]], also known as hospital social work. Medical social workers typically work in a hospital, outpatient clinic, community health agency, skilled nursing facility, long-term care facility or [[Hospice care|hospice]]. They work with patients and their families in need of psychosocial help. Medical social workers assess the psychosocial functioning of patients and families and intervene as necessary. Interventions may include connecting patients and families to necessary resources and supports in the community like preventative care; providing psychotherapy, supportive counseling, or grief counseling; or helping a patient to expand and strengthen their network of social supports. Role of a medical social worker is to "restore balance in an individual’s personal, family and social life, in order to help that person maintain or recover his/her health and strengthen his/her ability to adapt and reintegrate into society" (Ordre professionnel des travailleurs sociaux du Québec, OPTSQ, 1999). Professionals in this field typically work with other disciplines such as medicine, nursing, physical, occupational, speech and recreational therapy.

Medical social workers in Britain and Ireland were originally known as hospital [[almoner]]s or "lady almoners" until the profession was officially renamed medical social work in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=A Close and Practical Association with the Medical Profession: Scottish Medical Social Workers and Social Medicine, 1940–1975|first1=Christ|last1=Nottingham|first2=Rona|last2=Dougall|journal=Medical History|volume=51|issue=3|year=2007|pmc=1894864}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1895, [[Mary Stewart (social worker)|Mary Stewart]] became the first lady almoner in Britain with her appointment to the [[Royal Free Hospital]] in London for a three-month trial period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|title=The Social Worker Speaks: A History of Social Workers Through the Twentieth Century|first=David|last=Burnham|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xOgCwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA42&amp;dq=%22lady%20almoner%22%20%22social%20worker%22&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=978-1-317-01546-8|page=41–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some sources credit [[Anne Cummins (social worker)|Anne Cummins]] as the "mother of almoners" as she had the ability and the funding to first establish a comprehensive social work service at [[St Thomas's Hospital]] in London in 1909.&lt;ref name="Burnham2016"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Burnham|title=The Social Worker Speaks: A History of Social Workers Through the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9xOgCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA43|date=24 February 2016|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-01546-8|pages=43–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, the Institute of Almoners in Britain was formed, which, in 1964, was renamed as the [[Institute of Medical Social Workers]].  The Institute was one of the founder organizations of the [[British Association of Social Workers]], which was formed in 1970. In Britain, medical social workers were transferred from the [[National Health Service (England)|National Health Service]] (NHS) into local authority Social Services Departments in 1974, and generally became known as hospital social workers.

===China===
Medical social work was started in 1921 by [[Ida Pruitt]] in Beijing. In-service training was given to social workers for carrying out casework, [[adoption]] services and recuperation services.&lt;ref name=oup&gt;Lynne M. Healy, ''International Social Work: Professional Action in an Interdependent World'', Oxford University Press, 2001, {{ISBN|9780195124460}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=e5AFjjff8HUC&amp;pg=PA24 p.24]&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
Dr. Clifford Manshardt an American missionary in 1936 started formal training in social work in India through Dorabji Tata Graduate School of Social Work.&lt;ref name=oup/&gt; The first medical social worker was appointed in 1946 in J.J. Hospital, Bombay. In 1960s scope of medical social workers increased in India.&lt;ref&gt;G.R. Madan, ''Indian Social Problems (Vol-2): Social Disorganization and Reconstruction'', Allied Publishers, 1967, {{ISBN|9788184244601}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=RdAIBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA351 p.351]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
In Ireland, the origins of medical social work go back to paediatrician [[Ella Webb]], the first physician in Ireland to appoint almoners to work in her dispensary for sick children that she established in the [[Adelaide Hospital (Dublin)|Adelaide Hospital]] in Dublin, and to Winifred Alcock, the first almoner appointed by Webb in 1918.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite|last1=Kearney|first1=Noreen|last2=Skehill|first2=Caroline|year=2005|chapter=Chapter 8: An Overview of the Development of Health-Related Social Work in Ireland|title=Social Work in Ireland: Historical Perspectives|publisher=Institute of Public Administration|isbn=978-1-904541-23-3|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jC2IcX513UMC&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=%22medical%20social%20work%22%20british%20history&amp;pg=PA165#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|page=165–170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The [[Massachusetts General Hospital]] was the first American hospital to have professional social workers on site, in the early 1900s. Garnet Pelton, Ida Cannon and Dr. [[Richard Clarke Cabot]] were the central figures of the hospital social work.&lt;ref name=geh/&gt; Clarke credited his approach as similar to that of [[Anne Cummins (social worker)|Anne Cummins]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;Baraclough, J.

The major duties carried out by medical social workers were case management, data collection, follow ups, care coordination, health education, financial assessment and discounting patient medical fees.&lt;ref name=geh&gt;Sarah Gehlert, Teri Browne, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=LRTGZTa3Gb4C Handbook of Health Social Work]'', John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, {{ISBN|9781118115916}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3054">The '''Medicines Act 1968''' is an [[Act of Parliament]] of the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.Legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/1968/67/contents|title=Medicines Act 1968|website=www.Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It governs the control of [[Medication|medicines]] for human use and for [[Veterinary medicine in the United Kingdom|veterinary]] use, which includes the manufacture and supply of medicines.

The Act defines three categories of medicine: [[Prescription drug|prescription only medicine]]s (POM),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997|url=http://www.Legislation.gov.uk/uksi/1997/1830/made|website=www.Legislation.gov.uk|publisher=[[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government of the United Kingdom]]|accessdate=7 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are available only from a pharmacist if prescribed by an appropriate practitioner; pharmacy medicines (P), available only from a pharmacist but without a prescription; and general sales list (GSL) medicines which may be bought from any shop without a prescription.

The Act controls supply of the [[Pharmaceutical drug|drugs]] it covers, but does not define any offence of simple possession.  Possession of a prescription only drug without a prescription is only an offence if the drug is also controlled under the [[Misuse of Drugs Act 1971]] and possession is thus specified as an offence.  Therefore, for example, possession of a prescription only antibiotic without a prescription is not an offence.

For description of the legal classification of medicines in the UK see the [[Royal Pharmaceutical Society]] web site, and the publication 'Medicines ethics and practice'.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.rpharms.com/mep/legal-classification-of-medicines.asp {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Act was introduced following problems with the [[off-label use]] of [[thalidomide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conroy|first1=S.|last2=McIntyre|first2=J.|last3=Choonara;|first3=I.|last4=HULL|first4=P.

A '''needlestick injury''', '''percutaneous injury''', or '''percutaneous exposure incident''' or '''sharps injury''' is the penetration of the skin by a needle or other sharp object, which has been in contact with blood, tissue or other body fluids before the exposure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web |title = The National Surveillance System for Healthcare Workers (NaSH) Summary Report for Blood and Body Fluid Exposure (1995 - 2007) |url = https://www.cdc.gov/nhsn/PDFs/NaSH/NaSH-Report-6-2011.pdf |publisher = CDC |date = 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though the acute physiological effects of a needlestick injury are generally negligible, these injuries can lead to transmission of blood-borne diseases, placing those exposed at increased risk of contracting infectious diseases, such as [[hepatitis B]] (HBV), [[hepatitis C]] (HCV), and the [[HIV|human immunodeficiency virus]] (HIV). Among healthcare workers and laboratory personnel worldwide, more than 25 blood-borne viruses have been reported to be caused by needlestick injuries.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Prevention of needle-stick injuries in healthcare facilities: a meta-analysis|journal = Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology|date = 2015-07-01|issn = 1559-6834|pmid = 25765502|pages = 823–829|volume = 36|issue = 7|doi = 10.1017/ice.2015.50|first = Lukman H.|last = Tarigan|first2 = Manuel|last2 = Cifuentes|first3 = Margaret|last3 = Quinn|first4 = David|last4 = Kriebel}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to needlestick injuries transmission of these viruses can also occur as a result of contamination of the mucous membranes, such as those of the eyes, with blood or body fluids but needlestick injuries make up more than 80% of all percutaneous exposure incidents in the United States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Leigh |first1 = JP |last2 = Markis |first2 = CA |last3 = Iosif |first3 = A |last4 = Romano |first4 = PS |title = California's nurse-to-patient ratio law and occupational injury |journal = International Archives of Occupational and Environmental Health |date = 2015 |pmid = 25216822 |doi=10.1007/s00420-014-0977-y |volume=88 |pages=477–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various other occupations are also at increased risk of needlestick injury, including law enforcement, laborers, tattoo artists, food preparers, and agricultural workers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Alamgir&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Alamgir |first1 = H |last2 = Yu |first2 = S |title = Epidemiology of occupational injury among cleaners in the healthcare sector |journal = Occupational Medicine |date =  2008 |pmid = 18356143 |doi=10.1093/occmed/kqn028 |volume=58 |pages=393–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Increasing recognition of the unique occupational hazard posed by needlestick injuries, as well as the development of efficacious interventions to minimize the largely preventable occupational risk, encouraged legislative regulation in the US, causing a decline in needlestick injuries among healthcare workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Wicker |first1 = S |last2 = Ludwig |first2 = A |last3 = Gottschalk |first3 = R |last4 = Rabenau |first4 = HF |title = Needlestick injuries among health care workers: Occupational hazard or avoidable hazard? |journal = Wiener klinische Wochenschrift |date = 2008 |pmid = 18820853 |doi=10.1007/s00508-008-1011-8 |volume=120 |pages=486–92}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Phillips |first1 = EK |last2 = Conaway |first2 = M |last3 = Parker |first3 = G |last4 = Perry |first4 = J |last5 = Jagger |first5 = J |title = Issues in Understanding the Impact of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act on Hospital Sharps Injuries |journal = Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology |date = 2013 |pmid = 23917907 |doi=10.1086/671733 |volume=34 |pages=935–9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==

Needlestick injuries are a common event in the healthcare environment. When drawing blood, administering an [[Intramuscular injection|intramuscular]] or [[Intravenous therapy|intravenous]] drug, or performing any procedure involving sharps, accidents can occur and facilitate the transmission of [[blood-borne disease]]s. Injuries also commonly occur during needle recapping or via improper disposal of devices into an overfilled or poorly located sharps container. Lack of access to appropriate [[personal protective equipment]], or alternatively, employee failure to use provided equipment, increases the risk of occupational needlestick injuries.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Needlestick injuries may also occur when needles are exchanged between personnel, loaded into a [[Needle holder|needle driver]], or when [[Surgical suture|sutures]] are tied off while still connected to the needle. Needlestick injuries are more common during [[Shift work|night shifts]]&lt;ref name="MDPH"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mass.gov/eohhs/docs/dph/occupational-health/injuries/injuries-hospital-2010.pdf|title=Sharps injuries among hospital workers in Massachusetts, 2010: findings from the Massachusetts Sharps Injury Surveillance System.|last1=Laramie|first1=AK|last2=Davis|first2=LK|date=March 2012|publisher=Massachusetts Department of Public Health|last3=Miner|first3=C|last4=Pun|first4=VC|last5=Laing|first5=J|last6=DeMaria|first6=A}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for less experienced people; fatigue, high workload, shift work, high pressure, or high perception of risk can all increase the chances of a needlestick injury. During surgery, a surgical needle or other sharp instrument may inadvertently penetrate the glove and skin of operating room personnel;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; scalpel injuries tend to be larger than a needlestick. Generally, needlestick injuries cause only minor visible trauma or bleeding; however, even in the absence of bleeding the risk of viral infection remains.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

In 2007, the [[World Health Organization]] estimated annual global needlestick injuries at 2 million per year, and another investigation estimated 3.5 million injuries yearly.&lt;ref name="Alamgir" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal

It is difficult to establish correct figures for the risk of exposure or the incidence of needlestick injuries. First of all it is difficult to observe a needlestick injury, either in oneself or in other persons. Glove perforations in surgeons are considered a reasonable proxy that can be measured objectively. Even though glove perforations can be objectively measured, it is still unclear what the relation is between glove perforations and needlestick injuries.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; Another problem is underreporting of needlestick injuries.

Most studies use databases of reported needlestick injuries to determine preventable causes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; However this is different from establishing an exposure risk.

Among healthcare workers, nurses and physicians appear especially at risk; those who work in an operating room environment are at the highest risk.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; An investigation among American surgeons indicates that almost every surgeon experienced at least one such injury during their training.&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt; More than half of needlestick injuries that occur during surgery happen while surgeons are sewing the [[muscle]] or [[fascia]].&lt;ref name="Kirchner" /&gt; Within the medical field, specialties differ in regard to the risk of needlestick injury: surgery, [[anesthesia]], [[otorhinolaryngology]] (ENT), [[internal medicine]], and [[dermatology]] have high risk, whereas [[radiology]] and [[pediatrics]] have relatively low rates of injury.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kuhar|first1=DT|last2=Henderson|first2=DK|last3=Struble|first3=KA|last4=Heneine|first4=W|last5=Thomas|first5=V|last6=Cheever|first6=LW|last7=Gomaa|first7=A|last8=Panlilio|first8=AL|last9=US Public Health Service Working|first9=Group|title=Updated US Public Health Service guidelines for the management of occupational exposures to human immunodeficiency virus and recommendations for postexposure prophylaxis.|journal=Infection Control and Hospital Epidemiology|date=September 2013|volume=34|issue=9|pages=875–92|pmid=23917901|doi=10.1086/672271}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

In the United States, approximately half of all needlestick injuries affecting health care workers are not reported, citing the long reporting process and its interference with work as their reason for not reporting an incident. The availability of hotlines, witnesses, and response teams can increase the percentage of reports.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid = 17596603 |last1 = Makary |first1 = MA |last2 = Al-Attar |first2 = A |last3 = Holzmueller |first3 = CG |last4 = Sexton |first4 = JB |last5 = Syin |first5 = D |last6 = Gilson |first6 = MM |last7 = Sulkowski |first7 = MS |last8 = Pronovost |first8 = PJ |title = Needlestick Injuries among surgeons in training |journal = The New England Journal of Medicine |date = 2007 |doi=10.1056/NEJMoa070378 |volume=356 |pages=2693–9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicians are particularly likely to leave a needlestick unreported, citing worries about loss of respect or a low risk perception.

== Consequences of needlestick injuries ==

While needlestick injuries have the potential to transmit bacteria, [[protozoa]], viruses and [[prions]],&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt; the risk of contracting [[hepatitis B]], [[hepatitis C]], and [[HIV]] is the highest.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; The [[World Health Organization]] estimated that in 2000, 66,000 hepatitis B, 16,000 hepatitis C, and 1,000 HIV infections were caused by needlestick injuries.&lt;ref name=Alamgir/&gt;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt; In places with higher rates of blood-borne diseases in the general population, healthcare workers are more susceptible to contracting these diseases from a needlestick injury.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;

Hepatitis B carries the greatest risk of transmission, with 10% of exposed workers eventually showing [[seroconversion]] and 10% having symptoms.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite web |publisher = [[United States General Accounting Office]] |title = Occupational safety: Selected cost and benefit implications of needlestick prevention devices for hospitals. GAO-01-60R |date = November 17, 2000 |url = http://www.gao.gov/products/GAO-01-60R}}&lt;/ref&gt; Higher rates of hepatitis B vaccination among the general public and healthcare workers have reduced the risk of transmission;&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; non-healthcare workers still have a lower HBV vaccination rate and therefore a higher risk.&lt;ref name="Rachiotis"&gt;{{cite journal |last1 = Rachiotis |first1 = G |last2 = Papagiannis |first2 = D |last3 = Markas |first3 = D |last4 = Thanasias |first4 = E |last5 = Dounias |first5 = G |last6 = Hadjichristodoulou |first6 = C |title = Hepatitis B virus infection and waste collection: Prevalence, risk factors, and infection pathway |journal = American Journal of Industrial Medicine |date =  2012 |pmid = 22544469 |doi=10.1002/ajim.22057 |volume=55 |pages=650–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hepatitis C transmission rate has been reported at 1.8%,&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; but newer, larger surveys have shown only a 0.5% transmission rate.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The overall risk of HIV infection after percutaneous exposure to HIV-infected material in the health care setting is 0.3%.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; Individualized risk of blood-borne infection from a used biomedical sharp is further dependent upon additional factors. Injuries with a hollow-bore needle, deep penetration, visible blood on the needle, a needle located in a deep artery or vein, or a biomedical device contaminated with blood from a terminally ill patient increase the risk for contracting a blood-borne infection.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Rachiotis" /&gt;

=== Psychological effects ===

The psychological effects of occupational needlestick injuries can include [[health anxiety]], anxiety about disclosure or transmission to a sexual partner, trauma-related emotions, and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. These effects can cause self-destructive behavior or functional impairment in relationships and daily life. This is not mitigated by knowledge about disease transmission or PEP. Though some affected people have worsened anxiety during repeated testing, anxiety and other psychological effects typically abate after testing is complete. A minority of people affected by needlestick injuries may have lasting psychological effects, including [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wald|first=J|year=2009|title=The psychological consequences of occupational blood and body fluid exposure injuries|journal=[[Disability &amp; Rehabilitation]]|volume=31|pages=1963–9|doi=10.1080/09638280902874147|pmid=19479544}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In cases where an injury was sustained with a clean needle (i.e. exposure to body fluids hadn't occurred), the likelihood of infection is generally minimal. Nonetheless, workers are often obligated to report the incident as per the facility's protocol regarding [[occupational safety]].

== Post Exposure Prophylaxis ==
After a needlestick injury, certain procedures can minimize the risk of infection. Lab tests of the recipient should be obtained for baseline studies, including HIV, acute hepatitis panel (HAV IgM, HBsAg, HB core IgM, HCV) and for immunized individuals, HB surface antibody. Unless already known, the infectious status of the source needs to be determined.&lt;ref name="HCV" /&gt; Unless the source is known to be negative for HBV, HCV, and HIV, [[post-exposure prophylaxis]] (PEP) should be initiated, ideally within one hour of the injury.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

=== Hepatitis B ===

The risk of hepatitis B (e antigen positive) seroconversion is estimated at 37-62%, significantly more than other blood borne pathogens.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; After exposure to the hepatitis B virus (HBV), appropriate and timely prophylaxis can prevent infection and subsequent development of chronic infection or [[liver disease]]. The mainstay of PEP is the [[hepatitis B vaccine]]; in certain circumstances, [[Hepatitis B immune globulin|hepatitis B immunoglobulin]] is recommended for added protection.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ACIP&gt;{{cite journal |publisher = CDC |title = A comprehensive immunization strategy to eliminate transmission of hepatitis B virus infection in the United States: recommendations of the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (ACIP).

=== Hepatitis C  ===

The risk of hepatitis C seroconversion is estimated at 0.3-0.74%.&lt;ref name="MDPH" /&gt; Immunoglobulin and antivirals are not recommended for hepatitis C PEP.&lt;ref name=HCV&gt;{{cite journal |pmid = 9790221 |publisher = CDC |title = Recommendations for prevention and control of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection and HCV-related chronic disease |journal = MMWR |date = 1998 |volume=47 |pages=1–39}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no vaccine for HCV; therefore, post-exposure treatment consists of monitoring for seroconversion.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; There is limited evidence for the use of antivirals in acute hepatitis C infection.{{Citation needed|date = February 2016}}

=== HIV ===

The risk of HIV transmission with a skin puncture is estimated at 0.3%.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt; If the status of the source patient is unknown, their blood should be tested for HIV as soon as possible following exposure. The injured person can start [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretroviral drugs]] for PEP as soon as possible, preferably within three days of exposure.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; There is no vaccine for HIV.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; When the source of blood is known to be HIV positive, a 3-drug regimen is recommended by the CDC; those exposed to blood with a low viral load or otherwise low risk can use a 2-drug protocol.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt; The antivirals are taken for 4 weeks and can include [[Reverse-transcriptase inhibitor|nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors]] (NRTIs), [[nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NtRTIs), [[Non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor]]s (NNRTIs), [[Protease inhibitor (pharmacology)|protease inhibitors]] (PIs), or [[Entry inhibitor|fusion inhibitors]]. All of these drugs can have severe side effects. PEP may be discontinued if the source of blood tests HIV-negative. Follow-up of all exposed individuals includes counseling and [[Diagnosis of HIV/AIDS|HIV testing]] for at least six months after exposure. Such tests are done at baseline, 6 weeks, 12 weeks, and 6 months and longer in specific circumstances, such as co-infection with HCV.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

== Prevention ==

[[File:DrawingBloodUnitedStatesVacutainer.jpg|thumb|Blood being drawn with a [[Vacutainer]]. A protective cap (pink) protects the needle after it is removed.]]
The prevention of needlestick injuries should focus on those health care workers that are most at risk.

The group most at risk are surgeons and surgical staff in the operating room who sustain injuries from suture needles and other sharps used in operations. There are basically three complementary approaches to prevention of these sharps injuries. The first one is the use of tools that have been changed so that they are less likely to lead to a sharps injury such as blunt or taper-point surgery needles and safety engineered scalpels.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt; The second is to start using safe working practices such as the hands-free technique.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stringer|first=Bernadette|last2=Haines|first2=A. Ted|last3=Goldsmith|first3=Charles H.|last4=Berguer|first4=Ramon|last5=Blythe|first5=Jennifer|title=Is use of the hands-free technique during surgery, a safe work practice, associated with safety climate?|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0196655309005422|journal=American Journal of Infection Control|volume=37|issue=9|pages=766–772|doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2009.02.014|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third line of prevention is increased personal protective equipment such as the use of two pairs of gloves.&lt;ref name=":25" /&gt; In addition to these preventive approaches implementation measures are necessary because the measures are not universally taken up. To achieve better implementation, legislation, education and training are necessary among all health care workers at risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasak|first=Jessica M.|last2=Novak|first2=Christine B.|last3=Patterson|first3=Jennifer Megan M.|last4=Mackinnon|first4=Susan E.|date=2018-02-01|title=Prevalence of Needlestick Injuries, Attitude Changes, and Prevention Practices Over 12 Years in an Urban Academic Hospital Surgery Department|url=http://Insights.ovid.com/crossref?an=00000658-201802000-00016|journal=Annals of Surgery|language=ENGLISH|volume=267|issue=2|pages=291–296|doi=10.1097/sla.0000000000002178|issn=0003-4932}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another large group at risk are nurses but their frequency of exposure is much less than in surgeons. Their main risk comes from the use and disposal of injection syringes. The same prevention approaches can be implemented here. There are many so-called safety engineered devices such as retractable needles, needle shields/sheaths, needle-less IV kits, and blunt or valved ends on IV connectors.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Reddy|first=V|date=2017|title=Devices for preventing percutaneous exposure injuries caused by needles in healthcare personnel.|url=|journal=Cochrane Database Syst Rev|volume=11|pages=CD009740|doi=10.1002/14651858.cd009740.pub3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of extra gloves is less common among nurses.

Some studies have found that safer needles attached to syringes reduce injuries, but others have shown mixed results or no benefit.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt; The adherence to "no-touch" protocols that eliminate direct contact with needles during use and disposal greatly reduces the risk of needlestick injuries. In the surgical setting, especially in abdominal operations, blunt-tip suture needles were found to reduce needle stick injuries by 69%. Blunt-tip or tapered-tip suture needles can be used to sew muscle and fascia. Though they are more expensive than sharp-tipped needles, this cost is balanced by the reduction in injuries, which are expensive to treat.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirchner" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=L|last2=Mullan|first2=B|year=2011|title=Reducing needle stick injuries in healthcare occupations: an integrative review of the literature|journal=ISRN nursing|volume=2011|pages=315432|doi=10.5402/2011/315432|pmc=3169876|pmid=22007320}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sharp-tipped needles cause 51-77% of surgical needlestick injuries.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The [[American College of Surgeons]] (ACS) and the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) have endorsed the adoption of blunt-tip suture needles for suturing fascia and muscle.&lt;ref name="Kirchner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SoRelle"&gt;{{cite journal|last=SoRelle|first=R|date=2000|title=Precautions Advised to Prevent Needlestick Injuries Among US Healthcare Workers|journal=Circulation|volume=101|pages=E38|doi=10.1161/01.cir.101.3.e38|pmid=10645936}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

== Cost ==

There are indirect and direct costs associated with needlestick injuries. The US [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) determined that requiring hospitals to use safety-engineered needles would result in substantial savings due to the reduction in needlestick injuries requiring treatment. Costs of needlestick injuries include prophylaxis, wages and time lost by workers, quality of life, emotional distress, costs associated with drug toxicity, organizational liability, mortality, quality of patient care, and workforce reduction.&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Testing and follow-up treatment for healthcare workers who experienced a needlestick injury was estimated at $5,000 in the year 2000, depending upon the medical treatment provided. The [[American Hospital Association]] found that a case of infection by blood-borne pathogens could cost $1 million for testing, follow-up, and disability payments. An estimated $1 billion annually is saved by preventing needlestick injuries among healthcare workers in the US, including fees associated with testing, laboratory work, counseling, and follow-up costs.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Anderson JM | year = 2008 | title = Needle stick injuries: prevention and education key.

== Legislation ==
{{Over-coverage|date=February 2016}}

In the United States, the  Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act of 2000 and the subsequent Bloodborne Pathogens Standard of 2001 require safer needle devices, employee input, and records of all sharps injuries in healthcare settings.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kirchner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NSPA"&gt;{{cite web |title = Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act. H.R. 5178 |date = 2000 |url = https://www.cdc.gov/sharpssafety/pdf/Neelestick%20Saftety%20and%20Prevention%20Act.pdf |accessdate=2016-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Tatelbaum"&gt;{{cite journal |last = Tatelbaum |first = MF |title = Needlestick safety and prevention act |journal = Pain Physician |date = 2001 |pmid = 16902692 |volume=4 |pages=193–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the US, nonsurgical needlestick injuries decreased by 31.6% in the five years following the passage of the Needlestick Safety and Prevention Act. However, this legislation did not affect surgical settings, where injuries increased 6.5% in the same period.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":23" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":24" /&gt;

== Needlestick injuries outside healthcare ==
The Coalition for Safe Community Needle Disposal estimates there are over 7.5 billion syringes used for home medical care in the United States.&lt;ref name="Gold"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gold K|year=2011|title=Analysis: The impact of needle, syringe, and lancet disposal in the community|url=|journal=Journal of Diabetes Science and Technology|volume=5|issue=4|pages=848–850|doi=10.1177/193229681100500404|pmc=3192588}}&lt;/ref&gt; This large amount of home medical syringes has added to the problem of non-healthcare related needlestick injuries due to mishandling and improper disposal of the syringes. Blood on any sharp instrument may be infectious, whether or not the blood is fresh. HIV and hepatitis C virus are only viable for hours after blood has dried, but hepatitis B virus is stable even when dried.&lt;ref name="ACIP" /&gt; The risk of hepatitis B (HBV) transmission in the community is also increased due to the higher prevalence of HBV in the population than HIV and the high concentration of the virus in the blood.&lt;ref name="Macalino"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Macalino GE, Springer KW, Rahman ZS, Vlahov D, Jones TS|year=1998|title=Community-based programs for safe disposal of used needles and syringes|url=|journal=Journal of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndromes and Human Retrovirology|volume=18|issue=Supp 1|pages=S111–S119|doi=10.1097/00042560-199802001-00019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many professions are at risk of needlestick injury including [[law enforcement]], [[Waste collection|waste collectors]], laborers, and agricultural workers. There is no standard system for collecting and tracking needlestick injuries in the community, which makes it difficult to measure the full impact of this problem.&lt;ref name="Gold" /&gt; Law enforcement workers, like healthcare workers, under-report needlestick injuries. In [[San Diego]], 30% of police reported needle sticks. A study of 1,333 police officers in the [[Denver Police Department]] found that only 43.4% reported a needlestick injury they received; 42% of which occurred during their evening shift. Most of the needlestick injuries experienced by these workers occurred in their first 5 years of employment.&lt;ref name=":18" /&gt; In New York City, a study found a rate of 38.7 exposures (needlesticks and human bites) per 10,000 police officers.&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;

Needlestick injuries are among the top three injuries that occur among material-recovery facility workers who sort through trash to remove recyclable items from the community-collected garbage.&lt;ref name="Gold" /&gt; Housekeeping and janitorial workers in public sites, including hotels, airports, indoor and outdoor recreational venues, theaters, retails stores, and schools are at daily risk of exposure to contaminated syringes.&lt;ref name="Gold" /&gt; Needlestick injuries that occur in children from discarded needles in community settings, such as parks and playgrounds, are especially concerning. Not only for families but also for the entire community.  While the exact number of needlestick injuries in children in the US is unknown, even one injury in a child is enough to cause public alarm.  Studies in Canada have reported 274 injuries from needlesticks in children with the majority being boys (64.2%) and occurring from needles discarded in streets and/or parks (53.3%).&lt;ref name="Papenburg"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Papenburg J, Blais D, Moore D, Al-Hosni M, Laferrière C, Tapiero B, Quach C|year=2008|title=Pediatric injuries from needles discarded in the community: epidemiology and risk of seroconversion|url=|journal=Pediatrics|volume=122|issue=2|pages=487–492}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of ways in which needlestick injuries could be prevented. First and foremost, increased education in the community is vital. It is especially important to educate kids while they are young. Studies of injuries from discarded needles have reported that the average age of children injured is between five and eight years.&lt;ref name="Moore"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1997|title=Coreceptors: implications for HIV pathogenesis and therapy|journal=Science|volume=276|issue=5309|pages=51–2|doi=10.1126/science.276.5309.51|pmid=9122710|vauthors=Moore JP}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one study, 15% of injuries occurred in children pretending to use drugs.&lt;ref name="Moore" /&gt; Therefore, children should be taught at a young age about the risks of handling needles and the correct actions to take if they find a syringe.

More outreach programs for addiction treatment and infection prevention programs for injection drug users would be very beneficial.  Public [[needle disposal]] and [[syringe service]] programs (SSPs) or needle exchange programs (NEPs) have also proven to reduce the number of needles discarded in public areas.  According to the CDC, these programs are effective in the prevention of HIV and they help reduce the risk of infection with hepatitis C virus.&lt;ref name="Bloodborne"&gt;Bloodborne Infectious Diseases: HIV/AIDS, Hepatitis B, Hepatitis C. (2016, September 30). Retrieved March 16, 2017, from https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/topics/bbp/disposal.html&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, in 2004, the Environmental Protection Agency came up with a number program options for safe disposal including:

*Drop-off collection sites
*Syringe exchange programs
*Mail-back programs
*Home needle destruction devices
*Household hazardous waste collection sites

In the event that needlestick prevention programs are not put in place in a given community, a 1994 study suggests an alternative for "high risk" areas. The study proposed the implementation of a vaccination effort to give children a routine prophylaxis against hepatitis B to prevent the development of the illness in the event that a child encounters an improperly disposed needle.&lt;ref name="Wyatt"&gt;{{cite journal|year=1998|title=The HIV-1 envelope glycoproteins: fusogens, antigens, and immunogens|journal=Science|volume=280|issue=5371|pages=1884–8|bibcode=1998Sci...280.1884W|doi=10.1126/science.280.5371.1884|pmid=9632381|vauthors=Wyatt R, Sodroski J}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gold" /&gt;

Needle exchange programs are an effective way of decreasing the risk associated with needlestick injuries. These programs remove contaminated syringes from the street, reducing the risk of inadvertent transmission of blood-borne infections to the surrounding community and to law enforcement. A study in [[Hartford, Connecticut]] found that needlestick injury rates among Hartford police officers decreased after the introduction of a needle exchange program: six injuries in 1,007 drug-related arrests for the 6-month period before vs. two in 1,032 arrests for the 6-month period after.&lt;ref name=Tatelbaum/&gt;

Data almost universally confirm the value of needle exchange programs, which substantially decrease the risk of HIV among injectable drug users, and do not carry unintended negative consequences.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":20" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":21"&gt;{{cite journal |pmid = 24374889 |last1 = Aspinall |first1 = EJ |last2 = Nambiar |first2 = D |last3 = Goldberg |first3 =DJ |last4 = Hickman |first4 = M |last5 = Weir |first5 = A |last6 = Van Velzen |first6 = E |last7 = Palmateer |first7 = N |last8 = Doyle |first8 = JS |last9 = Hellard |first9 = ME |last10 = Hutchinson |first10 = SJ |title = Are needle and syringe programmes associated with a reduction in HIV transmission among people who inject drugs: a systematic review and meta-analysis |journal = Int J Epidemiol |date = 2014 |doi=10.1093/ije/dyt243 |volume=43 |pages=235–48}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":21" /&gt; US states that publicly fund exchange programs are associated with reduced rates of HIV transmission, increased availability of sterile syringes among injecting drug users, and increased provision of health and social services to users.

Nevertheless, the US government has explicitly prohibited federal funding for needle exchange programs since 1988, as part of the zero tolerance drug policy in that country.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":16" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Needle exchange programs have therefore been sparsely implemented in the United States.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

A [[phoropter]] is one of several generic names for modern instruments containing an optometer (battery of lenses for determination of optical error), combined with prisms and other attachments for measuring [[binocularity]]. The term refractor is another such term, and "vision tester" or other descriptive terms are used because phoroptor, spelled with "-or", is actually a trademark of one company.&lt;ref&gt;"Visual Optics and Refraction" by David D. Michaels, Mosby 1980, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Greens' refractor 001.jpg|thumb|Greens' Refractor, 1934 to 1978]]

== The modern phoropter or refractor ==
In the middle of the 19th century, doctors tested for optical error using single hand-held lenses, held one at a time in front of the patient's eye, or in a trial frame. A wooden case with dozens or hundreds of lenses was held on the doctor's lap, or in a case near the patient's chair, as he or she examined the patient.

In the later part of the 19th century, the United States, Germany, France and the UK were actively inventing numerous mechanical optometers, to speed up the process of bringing lenses before the patients' eyes. Various patented or unpatented optometers were sold throughout the later 19th and turn of the 20th centuries, some containing rotating batteries of lenses in various arrangements, usually with the name of the inventor in front of it.

Around 1910, binocularity was tested using trial frames which sat on the patient's face or on a support bar, with extra testing devices added to the front of the frames, such as Maddox rods, rotating prisms, and phorometers. The refraction part of the exam was done with trial lenses that fit into the back of the same trial frame. Optometer was the generic name for devices, crude and simple, with rotating batteries of sphere and cylinder lenses placed in front of each eye, one at a time, so there was no testing for binocularity. When the optometer and phorometer were combined into single instruments, the modern [[Phoropter|refractor/phoropter]] was born, which happened in the middle 1910s when two companies in the New York City area began to market [[Phoroptor#Shigon/Woolf/Genothalmic|competing versions]].&lt;ref&gt;[[phoropter]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Paralympic Charter''' is the name given to a set of rules and regulations that bind the running of the [[Paralympic Games]]. It sets out the constitution of the [[International Paralympic Committee]] and other members of the Paralympic movement including national Paralympic committees and other sporting bodies.

The Paralympic Charter parallels the [[Olympic Charter]].

Academic commentators have noted that the goals of the Paralympic movement expressed in the Charter and other key documentation are "vague" and not necessarily as clearly separated from the Olympic Charter as might be desirable.&lt;ref name="GilbertSchantz2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Keith Gilbert|author2=Otto J.

In a [[Health care|healthcare]] setting, a protocol, also called a [[medical guideline]], is a set of instructions which describe a process to be followed to investigate a particular set of [[Medical findings|findings]] in a [[patient]], or the method which should be followed to [[Disease Control|control]] a certain [[disease]].

== Passive protocol systems ==
Passive protocol systems are a source of information which health care providers have the freedom to choose to consult or not; they are not intrinsically incorporated into the healthcare process. The purpose of a passive protocol system is to give healthcare providers access to information which may remind healthcare providers of steps during patient care which may otherwise be forgotten or changed.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

== Active protocol systems ==
Active protocol systems are specific guidelines for healthcare providers to follow. They are a central way which healthcare is delivered. Examples of active protocol systems include trigger-automated [[order entry]] systems and appointment scheduling. Active protocol systems may provide an explanation function which offers background information, definitions, [[risk]]s, and the rationale that supports specific recommendations.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

The '''Red Cross Society of China''' ({{zh|c=中国红十字会}}) is the national [[Red Cross Society]] in the [[China|People's Republic of China]].

==Origins and history before 1949==
The Red Cross Society of China was founded as the '''Shanghai International Red Cross Committee''' on March 10, 1904, during the [[Russo-Japanese War]]. The founders were a group of Chinese business and political leaders, led by [[Shanghai]] tea merchant [[Shen Dunhe]]. Shen chose to use the Red Cross aegis for his group because the neutrality provided by the Red Cross symbol allowed Chinese relief teams into the Manchurian war zones to aid Chinese civilians caught in the conflict between Japan and Russia. Shen created a Red Cross organization made up of wealthy Chinese and prominent Westerners living in China. The Red Cross Society, supported by government officials, Chinese elites and Western medical workers provided aid to more than a quarter of a million people in China's northeast.&lt;ref name="The China Beat"&gt;{{cite web | author=Caroline Reeves | url = http://thechinabeat.blogspot.com/2008/05/history-of-chinese-red-cross-part-ii.html | title = History of Chinese Red Cross: Part II | publisher = The China Beat | date = 2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the end of the Russo-Japanese War, the Chinese Red Cross expanded exponentially, now providing peacetime relief as well. There was no shortage of natural disasters in China for the new group to work on. Floods, famine and fire were endemic in the first half of China's 20th century, along with the outbreak of civil war. The Society opened Red Cross hospitals in Shanghai and in other cities, while local Red Cross chapters blossomed throughout the country, staffed and funded by Chinese eager to participate in patriotic activities, particularly as part of an organization with international connections and an aura of "modernity." By the 1920s, there were over 300 Red Cross chapters in China.&lt;ref name="The China Beat"/&gt;

The [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] recognized the Red Cross Society of China in 1912 after the establishment of the [[Republic of China (1912–1949)|Republic of China]]. The Red Cross Society of China formally joined the [[International Federation of Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies|International Federation]] in 1919 and was one of the first members. During the 1920s, the Red Cross Society of China contributed to help other countries hit by natural disasters. In 1906, during the San Francisco earthquake and fire that killed 3,000 and destroyed the city, the Chinese Red Cross sent 20,000 silver [[tael]]s to its San Francisco counterpart to help with relief efforts. In 1923, after the great Tokyo earthquake, the Chinese Red Cross sent a relief team, crates of medicines, and almost $20,000 (in 1923 Chinese dollars) to Japan.&lt;ref name="The China Beat"/&gt; The Society's leadership from the 1920s-1940s was closely tied with the American and British Red Cross societies, the [[Kuomintang]] government and the [[Shanghai]] business community. In 1937, while the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]] was raging on, the Act of Administrative Rules and Procedures of the Republic of China Red Cross Society (中華民國紅十字會管理條例施行細則) was passed, and the society was renamed [[Red Cross Society of the Republic of China]], a society that still exists today, but located in [[Taiwan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.redcross.org.tw/RedCross/index.jsp | title = 中華民國紅十字會 | publisher = 中華民國紅十字會 (Red Cross Society of the Republic of China) | date = 2008-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Red Cross Society of the Republic of China (the name of the organization at the time) was naturally very active during the [[Second Sino-Japanese War]], though its operations were mostly limited to the [[Kuomintang]] strongholds in southwest China and some areas under Japanese occupation. Invaluable medical supplies from the [[United States]] and the [[United Kingdom]] were transferred to the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China by their American and British counterparts, through [[Burma]] and [[India]]. [[Overseas Chinese]] from Southeast Asia and around the world also raised funds for the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China, and appeals by Chinese diplomats and advocates around the world convinced the American public to make significant donations to support the Chinese people.

==After the proclamation of the People's Republic of China in 1949==
Following the outcome of the [[Chinese civil war]], the Red Cross Society, together with other government agencies of the Republic of China, moved to Taiwan. In 1955, the government of the [[Taiwan|Republic of China]] declared the Red Cross Society of the Republic of China the sole national humanitarian organization in the country, and a law was enacted that same year. The [[Communist Party of China]] re-organized the Red Cross organization in Beijing and was admitted to the International Federation in 1950 under the name of Red Cross Society of China.&lt;ref name="profile"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifrc.org/docs/profiles/cnprofile.pdf |title=Introduction of the RCSC |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-12-11 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071114104113/http://www.ifrc.org/docs/profiles/cnprofile.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the liberalization of the communist regime after the death of [[Mao Zedong]], a new Red Cross Law was enacted in 1993, allowing the Chinese people to connect with and help each other once again on a private, grassroots basis.&lt;ref name="The China Beat"/&gt; The law describes the legal relationship of the Red Cross Society and the PRC government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title=China Marks 8th Anniversary of Red Cross Society Law. |url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-79564143.html |work= |publisher=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |date=2001-10-31 |accessdate=2007-12-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Hong Kong Red Cross]] and the [[Macau Red Cross]] became autonomous members of the Red Cross Society of China after their handover to the [[People's Republic of China]] in 1997 and 1999 respectively.&lt;ref name="profile"/&gt;

Since the early 1990s, the Red Cross Society of China has negotiated with the [[Red Cross Society of the Republic of China]] to facilitate exchanges of individuals, mostly illegal immigrants or fugitives, between both sides of the [[Taiwan Strait]].

In 2008, the RCSC received 1.537 billion yuan (about 220 million US dollars) in donations from both domestic and overseas sources, nine times the figure of 2007. Ninety percent of the donation was received for disaster-relief work in Sichuan and other quake-hit areas in China, while the Red Cross Angel Program, which provides medical aid to poor areas, received 104 million yuan, and the Bo'Ai Aid Program for poor students received 36.95 million. The Angel Program helped to train 400 rural doctors, and provided aid to about 7,800 people with leukemia, congenital heart disease, cleft lip and palate, deafness, paraplegy  and cancer. The Bo'ai Aid Program trained 100 rural teachers, helped 107 needy students to complete their middle school study, and built 556 Red Cross libraries for rural middle and primary schools. That more than 6.9 million people had benefited from the total of 2,194 clinics, 194 schools and 1,112 libraries the foundation had built throughout the country by the end of 2008.&lt;ref name="donations"/&gt;

The organization came under public scrutiny in 2011 when [[Guo Meimei (Internet celebrity)|Guo Meimei]], a 20-year-old who claimed to be the general manager of a company called Red Cross Commerce and had boasted online about her luxurious lifestyle, cars and home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= |last= |authorlink= |coauthors= |title='Boyfriend' of woman in Red Cross scandal resigns. |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2011-07/05/content_12833100.htm |work= |publisher=[[China Daily]] |date=2011-07-05 |accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This led to public speculation that funds meant for earthquake ravaged areas were instead diverted to internal officials.

Exposed group has smaller risk of adverse outcome (RD = −0.25, ARR = 0.25).|thumb|The adverse outcome (black) risk difference between the group exposed to the treatment (left) and the group unexposed to the treatment (right) is −0.25 (RD = −0.25, ARR = 0.25).]]
In [[epidemiology]], '''risk difference''' (RD) or '''excess risk''' is the difference between the [[risk]] of an outcome in the exposed group and the unexposed group. It is computed as &lt;math&gt;I_e - I_u&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;I_e&lt;/math&gt;is the incidence in the exposed group, and &lt;math&gt;I_u&lt;/math&gt; is the incidence in the unexposed group. If the risk of an outcome is increased by the exposure, the term '''absolute risk increase''' (ARI) is used, and computed as &lt;math&gt;I_e - I_u&lt;/math&gt;. Equivalently, If the risk of an outcome is decreased by the exposure, the term '''absolute risk reduction''' (ARR) is used, and computed as &lt;math&gt;I_u - I_e&lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordreference.com/view/10.1093/acref/9780199976720.001.0001/acref-9780199976720|title=Dictionary of Epidemiology - Oxford Reference|language=en|doi=10.1093/acref/9780199976720.001.0001|access-date=2018-05-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/750986180|title=Epidemiology : an introduction|last=J.|first=Rothman, Kenneth|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=|isbn=9780199754557|edition=2nd|location=New York, NY|pages=66, 160, 167|oclc=750986180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inverse of the absolute risk reduction is the [[number needed to treat]], and the inverse of the absolute risk increase is the [[number needed to harm]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Usage in reporting==
It is recommended to use absolute measurements, such as risk difference, alongside the relative measurements, when presenting the results of randomized controlled trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Moher D, Hopewell S, Schulz KF, Montori V, Gøtzsche PC, Devereaux PJ, Elbourne D, Egger M, Altman DG|date=March 2010|title=CONSORT 2010 explanation and elaboration: updated guidelines for reporting parallel group randomised trials|journal=BMJ|volume=340|pages=c869|doi=10.1136/bmj.c869|pmc=2844943|pmid=20332511}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their utility can be illustrated by the following example of a hypothetical drug which reduces the risk of [[colon cancer]] from 1 case in 5000 to 1 case in 10,000 over one year. The relative risk reduction is 0.5, while the absolute risk reduction is 0.0001. The absolute risk reduction reflects the low probability of getting colon cancer in the first place, while reporting only relative risk reduction, would run into risk of readers exaggerating the effectiveness of the drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stegenga|first1=Jacob|date=2015|title=Measuring Effectiveness|url=https://www.academia.edu/16420844/Measuring_Effectiveness|journal=Studies in History and Philosophy of Biological and Biomedical Sciences|volume=54|pages=62–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Authors such as [[Ben Goldacre]] believe that the risk difference is best presented as a [[natural number]] - drug reduces 2 cases of colon cancer to 1 case if you treat 10,000 people. Natural numbers, which are used in the number needed to treat approach, are easily understood by non-experts.&lt;ref name="isbn0-00-724019-8"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bad Science|author=Ben Goldacre|publisher=Fourth Estate|year=2008|isbn=0-00-724019-8|location=New York|pages=239–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Inference ==
Risk difference can be estimated from a 2x2 [[contingency table]]:
{| class="wikitable"
! rowspan="2" |&amp;nbsp;
! colspan="2" |Group
|-
!Experimental (E)&lt;th&gt;[[Scientific control|Control]] (C)&lt;/th&gt;
|- href="Digital object identifier"
|Events (E)&lt;td&gt;EE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;CE&lt;/td&gt;&lt;tr&gt;&lt;td&gt;Non-events (N)&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;EN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;td&gt;CN&lt;/td&gt;&lt;/tr&gt;
|}The point estimate of the risk difference is

:&lt;math&gt;RD = \frac{EE}{EE + EN} - \frac{CE}{CE + CN}.&lt;/math&gt;

The sampling distribution of RD is approximately normal, with standard error

:&lt;math&gt;SE(RD) = \sqrt{\frac{EE\cdot EN}{(EE + EN)^3} + \frac{CE\cdot CN}{(CE + CN)^3}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The &lt;math&gt;1 - \alpha&lt;/math&gt; confidence interval for the RD is then

:&lt;math&gt;CI_{1 - \alpha}(RD) = RD\pm SE(RD)\cdot z_\alpha,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;z_\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is the [[standard score]] for the chosen level of [[Statistical significance|significance]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;[[Statistical significance|.]]

The '''Submarine Safety Program (SUBSAFE)''', is a [[quality assurance]] program of the [[United States Navy]] designed to maintain the safety of its [[submarine]] fleet; specifically, to provide maximum reasonable assurance that submarine hulls will stay watertight, and that they can recover from unanticipated flooding.

SUBSAFE covers all systems exposed to sea pressure or critical to flooding recovery. All work done and all materials used on those systems are tightly controlled to ensure the material used in their assembly as well as the methods of assembly, maintenance, and testing are correct. They require certification with traceable quality evidence which track the item from the point of manufacture (including all records of the creation of the product, i.e. source materials as well as smelting and hardening process for metals) to the point of installation within a SUBSAFE boundary. These measures increase the cost of submarine construction and maintenance.

SUBSAFE addresses only flooding; mission assurance is not a concern, simply a side benefit. Other safety programs and organizations regulate such things as fire safety, weapons systems safety, and nuclear reactor systems safety.&lt;ref name=Sullivan&gt;http://www.navy.mil/navydata/testimony/safety/sullivan031029.txt&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1915 to 1963, the United States Navy lost 16 submarines to non-combat related causes. Since SUBSAFE began in 1963, only one submarine, the non-SUBSAFE-certified {{USS|Scorpion|SSN-589}}, has been lost.&lt;ref&gt;https://history.nasa.gov/columbia/Troxell/Columbia%20Web%20Site/Documents/Congress/House/OCTOBE~1/Sullivan%20opening%20statement.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
On 10 April 1963, while on a deep test dive about 200 miles off the northeast coast of the [[United States]], {{USS|Thresher|SSN-593}} was lost with all hands.  The loss of the lead ship of a new, fast, quiet, deep-diving class of submarines led the Navy to re-evaluate the methods used to build its submarines.  A "''Thresher'' Design Appraisal Board" determined that, although the basic design of the {{sclass-|Thresher|submarine|4}} was sound, measures should be taken to improve the condition of the hull and the ability of submarines to control and recover from flooding casualties. It included addressing the following issues on ''Thresher'':

* Some silver-brazed joints could have been sub-standard. One or more of these joints is believed to have failed, resulting in flooding in the engine room. 
* The crew was unable to access vital equipment to stop the flooding. 
* Saltwater spray on electrical components caused short circuits, reactor shutdown, and loss of propulsion power.  
* The main ballast tank blow system failed to operate properly at test depth. Various restrictions in the air system coupled with excessive moisture in the system probably led to ice formation in the blow system piping.  The resulting blockage caused an inadequate blow rate.  Consequently, the submarine was unable to overcome the increasing weight of water rushing into the engine room.&lt;ref name=Sullivan/&gt;

==SUBSAFE certification==
SUBSAFE certification is carried out in four areas; Design, Material, Fabrication, &amp; Testing. The exact procedures are documented in  the initial design &amp; construction for new submarines, while undergoing routine maintenance in naval depots, and in the fleet maintenance manual for operating submarines. During each step, quality evidence is collected, reviewed, approved, and stored for the life of the submarine. This process is reinforced with external and internal audits.

==NASA==
After the [[Space Shuttle Columbia disaster|loss of the Space Shuttle Columbia]], the [[Columbia Accident Investigation Board]] described SUBSAFE as "successful safety programs and practices that could be models for NASA".&lt;ref&gt;https://history.nasa.gov/columbia/Troxell/Columbia%20Web%20Site/Documents/Congress/House/OCTOBE~1/hearing_charter.html&lt;/ref&gt; Following this recommendation, a number of exchanges and conferences have been held between SUBSAFE naval personnel and NASA.

'''Safety in [[NASCAR]]''' has evolved into one of the biggest concerns in stock car racing's largest sanctioning body. Mainly after the [[death of Dale Earnhardt]], a seven time [[Winston Cup Series]] champion, NASCAR has decided to change all of their safety policies, such as the use of the [[HANS device]]. Since 2001, NASCAR has also changed the cars for the Sprint Cup Series and the [[Xfinity Series]]. NASCAR's safety policy includes the racing fire suit, [[carbon fiber]] seating, and [[roof flap]]s.

==Car of Tomorrow==
{{Main|Car of Tomorrow}}

During a series of deaths of several drivers, NASCAR began researching a new, safer car.  After a seven-year program, NASCAR presented a design for a new car.  The new car, known as the Car of  Tomorrow, features a reinforced roll cage. The left side skin has a steel plate for better resiliency in crashes.  The roof is four inches higher and two inches wider for safety in rolls. First implemented in the Car of Tomorrow was the separated wing. From 2009-early 2010, the wing was blamed for several flips.  Starting in the 2010 spring [[Martinsville Speedway|Martinsville]] race, the wing was replaced by the traditional spoiler.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nascar.com/2010/news/headlines/cup/03/17/spoiler.debut.martinsville/index.html Nascar.com] Accessed 10/16/2010&lt;/ref&gt; Also new to the Car of tomorrow, is the stronger smaller fuel cell {{convert|17.75|USgal|L}} for a reduced risk of fires.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-racing/nascar/nascar-basics/nascar-car-of-tomorrow.htm/printable How Stuff Works]&lt;/ref&gt;  The windshield is made of [[bullet-resistant glass|Lexan]] which gains its strength from its flexibility.  Under normal circumstances, the glass bends and absorbs the force of the object.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-racing/nascar/nascar-basics/nascar-safety3.htm How Stuff Works page 3]&lt;/ref&gt;  Implemented in a limited schedule in 2007, the car was immediately criticized by the drivers for lack of handling.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.NASCAR.com/news/headlines/cup/car.of.tomorrow/index.html NASCAR.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, a [[Car of Tomorrow#Gen 6 era|sixth-generation]] stock car was unveiled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mikemulhern.net/MikesTake/peeling-the-onion-that-is-this-2013-nascar-stocker A Look At Development Of The 2013 NASCAR Race Car]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Racing suit==
{{main|Racing suit}}
[[File:Jeff Gordon wins Phoenix - February 27, 2011 cropped.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[Jeff Gordon]] and his crew wearing a fire suit for safety.]]
NASCAR drivers are required to wear a fire-retardant suit and underwear along with certified helmets.  This suit serves a dual purpose of identifying the driver outside the car, and protecting them during a fire.  The driver also wears fire retardant shoes and gloves.  During long races, the heat of the engine might warm the feet to uncomfortable levels, so most drivers wear a heat shield on the bottom of their shoes.

The helmets serve many safety purposes in the NASCAR circuit. First, the helmet protects the driver from injuries.  Second, the helmet has hook-ups for radio to communicate with the [[Spotter (auto racing)|spotter]] and [[Crew chief (auto racing)|crew chief]].  Third, the helmets sometimes have visors that reduce the sun's glare so the driver can have better vision. Fourth they have anchor points that connect to the H.A.N.S. device to reduce the risk of neck injuries and concussions in a crash.

==Seats==
The seats that the drivers sit in have evolved over the past few years. Most of the seats found in the race cars wrap around the driver's rib cage. This provides some support during a crash, spreading the load out over the entire rib cage instead of letting it concentrate in a smaller area. Some of the newer seats wrap around the driver's shoulders as well, which provides better support because the shoulders are more durable than the rib cage.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/auto-racing/nascar/nascar-basics/nascar-safety1.htm How Stuff Works page 1]&lt;/ref&gt; The introduction of carbon fiber seats has also helped improve safety, as carbon fiber absorbs more energy from an impact than the traditional aluminum seats.

==Seat belts and harnesses==
{{See also|HANS device}}
The seat belts used are five- or six-point harness, which have two straps coming down over the driver's shoulders, two straps wrapping around the waist, and one or two coming up between the legs. Since a string of accidents in 2000 and 2001 that killed [[Adam Petty]], [[Kenny Irwin, Jr.|Kenny Irwin]], [[Tony Roper (racing driver)|Tony Roper]] and Dale Earnhardt (plus several other drivers in minor circuits) under similar circumstances, NASCAR has made it mandatory for the drivers to wear the HANS device. Though NASCAR allowed another system, the [[Hutchens device]], in the past, since 2005 HANS is the only head and neck restraint device allowed for use.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.NASCAR.com/2005/news/headlines/cup/01/04/bc.car.NASCAR.hutchensd.ap/] Article about the Hutchens device&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, Hutchens has been allowed again by NASCAR, as seen by its usage by [[Kyle Larson]] and [[Austin Dillon]]. The HANS device reduces the risk of [[whiplash (medicine)|whiplash]] during a crash.

==Window nets==
All cars must have a nylon window net to protect the driver from flying debris and to contain the driver’s arms during a crash.  In addition, the drivers are instructed to lower the window net after a wreck to signify that they are uninjured.

==Restrictor plate==
{{main|Restrictor plate}}
[[Image:Restrictor-Plate-Rendering.png|right|thumb|200px|Artist rendering of a NASCAR restrictor plate]]
As a safety measure to reduce speeds at the two high-banked superspeedways (Daytona and Talladega), restrictor plates are used. There are some tracks, however, where restrictor plates are not mandated and therefore see faster speeds—specifically [[Atlanta Motor Speedway]] and Texas Motor Speedway. While Atlanta is generally considered the fastest track, restrictor plates are not mandated there. In 2004 and 2005, higher qualifying speeds were posted at Texas, earning it the title of the circuit's fastest track. Unrestricted, Sprint Cup cars produce over 750 [[horsepower]] (560 [[Watt|kW]]) and can run at speeds in excess of 200&amp;nbsp;mph. [[Rusty Wallace]] completed a 2004 test for NASCAR at Talladega in which he used an unrestricted motor to complete average lap speeds of {{convert|221|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}} and top speeds near {{convert|230|mi/h|km/h|abbr=on}}. The 2010 width is 63/64-inch. This is the largest carburetor restrictor plate opening since the one-inch mandate in 1988, the first year the horsepower-reducing plates were used in the Cup Series at Daytona.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.NASCAR.com/2004/news/headlines/cup/06/10/rwallace_talladega/index.html NASCAR.com] Report on Rusty Wallace at Talladega&lt;/ref&gt;

Unfortunately, the restrictor plates have an unintended effect on the race.  Because of the reduced horsepower of the cars, the cars form large packs.  During a race it is not uncommon to see thirty or more lead changes during a race.  This also is the source of the [[The Big One (NASCAR)|Big One]].  When a driver crashes, usually, they take that pack with them.  During the [[2010 Coke Zero 400]], 21 of the 43 cars crashed.  This is a safety concern that has puzzled NASCAR. However, an unexpected consequence of the introduction of the [[Car of Tomorrow]] and re-paving of Daytona and Talladega track surfaces has been the separation of the pack into two-car pairs.

Since the 2012 season, NASCAR Cup cars now have fuel injection instead of carburetors, but restrictor plates are still being used.

==Roof flaps==
In 1994, NASCAR introduced roof flaps to the car, which is designed to keep cars from getting airborne and possibly flipping down the track. Following Rusty Wallace's crashes at Daytona and Talladega, Penske Racing designed the original roof flaps.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jayski.com/past/050221.htm] Jayski's Silly Season Site&lt;/ref&gt; NASCAR team owner Jack Roush helped improve on the design of the roof flaps, in conjunction with [[Embry-Riddle Aeronautical University]], Daytona, Florida, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Various Contributors |title= Official NASCAR Trivia |publisher= [[Harper Collins]] |year= 1998 |isbn= 0-06-107304-0}}
&lt;/ref&gt; During spins, as a result of accidents or loss of handling, as the car rotates it eventually reaches an angle where the oncoming air reacts with the profile of the vehicle in the same manner as a wing. If the speed is high enough air flowing over the car's overall airfoil shape will create sufficient [[Lift (force)|lift]] to force the car to become airborne. To prevent this, NASCAR developed a set of flaps that are recessed into pockets on the roof of the car. As a car is turned around and reaches an angle where significant lift occurs, the low pressure above the flaps causes them to deploy. The first flap oriented 140 degrees from the centerline of the car typically deploys first. After flap deployment, higher pressure air is forced through an air tube which connects to a second flap, deploying it. This second flap ensures that, should the car continue to spin, no further lift will be created as the vehicle's angle changes. The deployment of these flaps eliminates most of the lift on the vehicle. The roof flaps generally keep the cars on the ground as they spin, alt.&lt;ref&gt;[http://auto.howstuffworks.com/NASCAR-safety1.htm Howstuffworks.com] Explanation of roof flaps.&lt;/ref&gt;

==SAFER barriers==
{{main|SAFER barrier}}
Beginning in 2002 (at [[Indianapolis Motor Speedway|Indianapolis]]), many tracks were retrofitted with SAFER barriers along the walls of the track. These walls absorb the energy of an impact better than concrete walls, while maintaining integrity better than traditional steel barriers. This system costs millions of dollars to install, and the creation of this wall, which connects to the original wall, took many more millions to design and create. Some SAFER barriers were installed in 2003 at Richmond (July), and Homestead, others in 2004 at Talladega, Daytona (July, before [[2004 Pepsi 400]]) and other tracks, in 2005 at Dover and at Watkins Glen in 2010. The [[Iowa Speedway]] is the first track that was built with the SAFER Barrier around the entire track. Starting in 2015, the majority of NASCAR tracks have SAFER Barriers surrounding the entire perimeter of the outside walls.

==Pit road safety==
Pit road safety has become a major focus of NASCAR officials in recent years since the 1990 [[Pep Boys Auto 500|Atlanta Journal 500]], where the rear tire changer for [[Melling Racing]] was killed in a pit road crash.

By April 1991, NASCAR implemented the current policy of pit road speed limits. The speed limit depends on the size of the track and the size of pit road. NASCAR uses an electronic scoring system, similar to the [[VASCAR]] system, to monitor the speeds of cars on pit road by measuring the time it takes to get from checkpoint to checkpoint. The cars are not equipped with speedometers, therefore during the pre-race warm-up laps, the cars are driven around the track at the pit road speed limit behind the pace car. The drivers then select a [[Gear ratio|gear]] (usually 2nd gear) and observe and record the corresponding [[Revolutions per minute|RPM]] on their respective [[tachometer]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tennessean.com/sports/motorsports/archives/05/01/66209967.shtml?Element_ID=66209967] Article about pit road speed&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1994, almost every form of motorsport had adopted pit lane speed limits, following NASCAR's cue.

NASCAR does not allow the use of pit road specific rev limiters as found in most other forms of racing. Allowing a pit road limiter would require the addition of several electronic components into the car, and NASCAR has long opposed the installation of electronics into cars, citing the decline of open wheel racing once technology was introduced.

Since 2002, NASCAR has implemented a rule where all over the wall pit members are required to wear helmets, no visors needed, full fire suits, and gloves; while the gas man must wear a fire apron as well as the suit. While it is not required yet, it is recommended that tire changers wear safety glasses to prevent eye injuries from lug nuts thrown off the car and fuel spills. Some tire changers wear face shields or goggles.

Beginning in 2008, teams in the top three series may not roll a car more than three pit box lengths to [[push start]] a car. This prevents teams from pushing a car the length of pit road when the [[Automobile self starter|starter motor]] fails. Also, outside tires that have been removed from a vehicle during a pit stop can no longer be free-rolled from the outside of the pit box to the pit wall; rather, they must be hand-directed to the inner half of the pit box before being released.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.NASCAR.com/2008/news/headlines/cup/01/10/pit.road.rule.changes/index.html NASCAR.COM&amp;nbsp;– NASCAR changes two pit rules for safety reasons&amp;nbsp;– Jan 10, 2008&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Effective in 2012, teams may not plug a cable that connects an engine control unit to a computer during a pit stop with the car on pit lane.  In such cases, the car must be in the garage area for the team to run the cable from the car to the computer.  This rule was implemented for the Sprint Cup Series, which switches to electronic fuel injection for 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scenedaily.com/news/articles/sprintcupseries/Engine_builders_pleased_with_fuel_injection_results_from_Daytona_test.html Engine builders pleased with fuel injection results from Daytona Test]&lt;/ref&gt;
As with changes to car models, NASCAR will institute new rules during a season if it deems it necessary to enhance safety.

==Spotter==
[[File:NASCAR spotters photo D Ramey Logan.jpg|thumb|NASCAR spotters November 5, 2004]]
In contrast with [[open-wheel]], [[Sports car racing|sports car]], and [[Touring car racing|touring car]] governing bodies, NASCAR does not allow race cars to have [[wing mirror]]s. Drivers may still use a [[rear-view mirror]] and mirrors attached to the roll bar, but no mirror can extend outside of the car. As a result, they are left with large [[Blind spot (automobile)|blind spot]]s. In NASCAR’s more prominent series, spotters are used to combat this problem. The spotter’s purpose is to relay information about where cars in these blind spots are to the driver via [[two-way radio]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.popularmechanics.com/automotive/motorsports/1268766.html?page=2 Popular Mechanics] NASCAR Spotters: The Driver's Eye In The Sky&lt;/ref&gt;  Spotters also advise drivers on navigating track-obstructing crashes and may relay messages from one driver to another. NASCAR requires spotters at all times a car is on the track, including series in practice, qualifying, and the race. In many cases, a spotter is a former driver.

At some tracks, mostly the road courses, NASCAR mandates multiple spotters at key locations around the track.

'''Samuel Moor Shoemaker III''' DD, STD (December 27, 1893 &amp;ndash; October 31, 1963)&lt;ref&gt;"[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1963/11/02/89970879.pdf Rev. Dr. Samuel Shoemaker Dies; Pittsburgh Episcopal Canon, 69]", New York Times, November 2, 1963. Note: Shoemaker's death date is often incorrectly cited as January 31; e.g., David Hein &amp; Gardiner H. Shattuck Jr. (2004), ''The Episcopalians'', p. 295, 2004, Church Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; was a priest of the [[Episcopal Church (USA)|Episcopal Church]]. Considered one of the best preachers of his era, whose sermons were syndicated for distribution by tape and radio networks for decades, Shoemaker served as the rector of [[Calvary Church (Manhattan)|Calvary Episcopal Church]] in [[New York City]], the United States headquarters of the [[Oxford Group]] during the 1930s, and later at [[Calvary Episcopal Church (Pittsburgh)|Calvary Episcopal Church]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nycago.org/Organs/NYC/html/CalvaryEpis.html|title=Calvary Episcopal Church |author= |date= |work= |publisher=American Guild of Organists, New York City Chapter|accessdate=February 25, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Shoemaker's interdenominational focus and the Oxford Group were significant influences for the founders of [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]. [[Bill W.|Bill Wilson]] attended [[Oxford Group]] meetings at Calvary Church, and Sam Shoemaker also helped start an Oxford Group chapter in Akron, Ohio,&lt;ref&gt;Mel B., "New Wine: The Spiritual Roots of the Twelve Step Miracle," pp. 64-69, 1991, Hazelden, {{ISBN|0-89486-772-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; where [[Bob Smith (doctor)|Dr. Bob Smith]] became involved.

Shoemaker's contributions and service to [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] had a worldwide effect. The philosophy that Shoemaker codified, in conjunction with [[Bill W.|Bill Wilson]], is used in almost every country around the world to treat [[alcoholism]]. Similar programs are used to help [[Al-Anon/Alateen|relatives of alcoholics]], as well as people suffering with other addictions such as [[Nar-Anon|to narcotics]].

Serious disagreements with Oxford Group founder [[Frank Buchman]] led Shoemaker to separate from Buchman in 1941. Sam Shoemaker and his followers later formed "Faith At Work" as a continuation of his interdenominational conference and publication projects.

==Early life==
Shoemaker was born in a rented house on Read Street in [[Baltimore, Maryland]] on December 27, 1893 to Samuel Moor Shoemaker, Jr. (later chairman of the Board of Regents of the [[University of Maryland]]) and Nellie Whitridge (later president of the Women's Auxiliary of the [[Episcopal Diocese of Maryland]]), who had met at [[Emmanuel Church, Baltimore|Emmanuel Church]] in Baltimore, where his uncle was rector.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Smith Shoemaker, ''I Stand by the Door'' (Harper and Row, 1967) p. 14&lt;/ref&gt;

Two years later, the young family moved to his late paternal grandfather's property, 'Burnside',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.estately.com/listings/info/10510-burnside-farm-road&lt;/ref&gt; about 10 miles north of Baltimore at the entrance to the [[Green Spring Valley Historic District|Green Spring Valley]]. In 1898, his father turned Burnside into a dairy farm, with a prize herd of Guernsey cattle, though his grandfather had preferred Jerseys.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; Sam Shoemaker was well aware of his privileged upbringing: Mennonite Schumachers had moved from Germany, Holland and Switzerland hundreds of years earlier, converted to Quakerism under the influence of [[William Penn]]'s missionaries and Anglicised their surname as they moved to Germantown, which became a [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania|Philadelphia]] neighborhood. One of his ancestors of the same name had twice served as Philadelphia's mayor, and his paternal grandfather (who died in 1884 and for whom both Sam's father and young Sam were named), although born in [[Lafourche Parish, Louisiana]], made his fortune organizing the [[Great Western Express]] transportation line between Philadelphia and Baltimore.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker pp. 10-11&lt;/ref&gt; His paternal grandmother, the Victorian matriarch who raised him as an Episcopalian, was Augusta Chambers Eccleston, of [[Chestertown, Maryland]], daughter of Maryland Court of Appeals Judge John Bowers Eccleston (1794-1860) and sister of the Rev. John H. E. Eccleston, whose Emmanuel Episcopal Church was decorated with flowers from the family's greenhouses. A more distant John C. Eccleston (1828-1912) served as a priest in [[Richmond County, New York]]. Sam's maternal grandfather, John Augustus Whitridge, had a fleet of [[clipper ship]]s, although he died when Sam was 13. Shoemaker later became known for a slight southern inflection in his speech, which he attributed not to these relatives, but to his lifelong friend Hen Bodley, and to James (actually Richard Hugh Gwathney), a longtime family servant, who had been born in [[Fredericksburg, Virginia]].&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

When Sam was 14, he was sent to St. George's, an Episcopal boarding school in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] run by the Rev. John B. Diman, who later converted to Roman Catholicism and founded the Portsmouth Priory near the school. Sam, homesick, initially did not feel comfortable among the "Yankees." He also did not consider himself a good student, but did hold several positions during his two years at the school, including as president of the missionary society.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker pp. 16-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon graduating in 1912, Shoemaker attended [[Princeton University]], as had his father. A fan of President [[Woodrow Wilson]], Shoemaker became acquainted with the political controversies of the day, and after his sophomore year traveled to Europe. Upon returning, Shoemaker and three other students protested war propaganda and military drills at the university.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker, pp. 17-19&lt;/ref&gt; At Princeton, Shoemaker met [[Robert Elliott Speer|Robert Speer]], [[John Mott]] and [[Sherwood Eddy]] through the [[World Student Christian Federation]]. He became interested in personal evangelism and missionary work, as well as the relatively new ecumenical movement.&lt;ref&gt;Holy Women, Holy Men: Celebrating the Saints (Church Publishing Company, New York, 2010) p. 200&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Harris at p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1917, with the blessing of the Rt. Rev. [[John Gardner Murray]], bishop of Maryland, Sam Shoemaker went to China to start a branch of the [[YMCA]] and teach business courses at the Princeton-in-China Program. Shoemaker spent several years in China, but attracted few converts until he came under the influence of the [[Oxford Group]] and [[Frank Buchman]]. A follower of Dr. Mott as well as leader of [[Pennsylvania State University|Penn State]]'s Y group, Buchman advised Shoemaker to look inside himself, and to talk about his personal experiences.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''The Breeze of the Spirit'' (The Seabury Press, 1978) pp. 4-5&lt;/ref&gt; Buchman also told Shoemaker about the essence of the [[Sermon on the Mount]] being four absolutes: honesty, purity, unselfishness and love.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Smith Shoemaker, ''I Stand By the Door: The Life of Sam Shoemaker,'' (Word Books, 1978) pp. 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; After contemplating his own inadequacy compared to those absolutes, Shoemaker decided to let God guide his life.&lt;ref&gt;Bill Pittman, "AA, the way it began" (Glen Abbey Books, 1988) p. 117&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Princeton in 1919 to head the Philadelphian Society, a campus Christian organization which he had led during his senior year.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker pp. 20, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in New York==
In 1920, bishop Murray ordained Shoemaker a deacon in the Episcopal Church. Shoemaker then returned to his earlier post at Princeton through the school year, 1922&amp;ndash;23. There, he maintained his ties with the Oxford Group; Buchman also made frequent visits to Princeton. However, by the time Shoemaker returned to Princeton, the movement's personal evangelism had begun to gather both friends and foes in England (where Buchman had started his "First Century Christian Fellowship" at Oxford and Cambridge) as well as America.

After completing his missionary year at Princeton, Shoemaker entered [[General Theological Seminary]] in New York. During his second year, Dr. Charles Louis Slattery of [[Grace Church (Manhattan)|Grace Church]] off lower Broadway appointed him as a part-time assistant. After graduation and ordination, with his bishop's approval, Shoemaker and two British university graduates traveled with Buchman through Europe and the Middle East, exploring the meaning of Christian discipleship in missions and hospitals as they had in Beijing.&lt;ref&gt;Harris at p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; Between Egypt and India Shoemaker received a cable and letter from the vestry at [[Calvary Church (Manhattan)]], a then-dwindling but storied missionary congregation in a once-fashionable but changing neighborhood that wanted the energetic youth to become their rector.&lt;ref&gt;Harris pp. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker pp. 45-47&lt;/ref&gt;

Bishop [[William T. Manning]] of New York approved of the Oxford Group and Shoemaker's taking the helm at Calvary Church in the Gramercy Park neighborhood.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker pp. 48-50&lt;/ref&gt; At Calvary, where he became rector after a successful two-year trial term, Shoemaker constantly balanced both the institutional and sacramental aspects of the church's life, as well as his personal faith as influenced by Buchman and the Oxford Group. He held outdoor services in nearby Madison Square beginning in the summer of 1927, attracting new parishioners through music as well as his sermons, and began transforming the church school that winter term.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker pp. 54-55&lt;/ref&gt;
 
For the next eleven years, Sam and Helen Shoemaker managed to combine the diverse interests of Calvary Church with the life style and program of the Oxford Group. The church's ministry grew exponentially, by about 100 parishioners at the Sunday morning service in his first year, and another 100 during the second.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all of Calvary's members could have been committed to the radical life style and "hot gospelling" of the Oxford Group. Selling some church lots on 22nd Street to build a new seven-story Calvary House in place of the old rectory also caused controversy.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker pp. 57-58&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1926, Shoemaker founded the 'Faith at Work' movement (later called LUMUNOS and Moral Re-Armament in the years immediately preceding World War II) out of his passion for personal witness in the workplace. Faith at Work begun circa 1926 in a mission at Calvary. On Thursday evenings through approximately 1936, lay persons both presented their witness of their life as Christians in the workaday world and were trained to witness to that world.

However, when the Great Depression hit and continued, controversy grew around Shoemaker. In 1932, the Calvary vestry granted him an extended leave of absence to bring his ideas to a wider audience.  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We must all realize that the work which has been characteristic of Calvary Parish for the past few years is part of a much larger movement which is making a tremendous spiritual contribution in many countries today. A First Century Christian Fellowship or the Oxford Group has been called by Archbishop William Temple of York one of the main movements of the Spirit in our time. 
"The evident need of our country in the world of spiritual awakening lays a special obligation upon us all at Calvary to share with others what has helped us. 
"When therefore the Rector asked us to come to a special meeting of the vestry on June 15, and proposed to us that he be released for a six month sabbatical leave during which time he would devote himself entirely to the furtherance of this important work, (with the International Team of the Oxford Group) throughout America, we felt that this was a call which neither he nor we should disregard. Further we wanted him to go as our representative."&lt;ref&gt;Karl Olsson, '''Sam Shoemaker and Faith at Work''' citing The Vestry's letter to the congregation&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Around 1938, Faith at Work transformed into Moral Re-Armament. However, controversy grew because the latter dissociated from Christian churches and New Testament orientation. Moral Re-Armament also took an increasing share of Shoemaker's time and the facilities of Calvary House in New York. Shoemaker re-evaluated his priorities, including with Frank Buchman and the Oxford Group, as well as his commitment to evangelism, devotion to the Church of Christ in general and to the Episcopal Church. Efforts to work through these concerns in 1940 and 1941 proved fruitless. In the closing months of 1941, Calvary Church's vestry formally asked Moral Re Armament to stop using Calvary House.

==Pittsburgh==
Shoemaker had become involved in radio preaching, and in 1946, Dr. Frank Goodman of the Federal Council of Churches offered Shoemaker a daily five-minute spot on station WJZ. That proved successful, leading to a Sunday half hour broadcast on station WOR, and another half-hour program called "Faith in our Time".&lt;ref&gt;Shomemaker p.109&lt;/ref&gt;

Shoemaker's fame led him to receive a call (which he declined) to become Dean of San Francisco Cathedral in 1950. However, the following year, after celebrating his own quarter century of ministry at Calvary in New York, [[Calvary Episcopal Church (Pittsburgh)|Calvary Church]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania]] called Shoemaker to serve as its rector. The Bishop of Pittsburgh called to urge him to accept, as did a group of Pittsburgers who called themselves the 'Golf Club crowd'. He ultimately did, and in 1955 launched what he called the interdenominational 'Pittsburgh Experiment,' seeking to bring Christianity into everyday life, and about which he wrote ''The Experiment of Faith''(1957).&lt;ref&gt;Helen Shoemaker, ''I Stand by the Door'' (Harper &amp; Row, 1967) pp. 194-95&lt;/ref&gt; The Pittsburgh Jaycees named him their Man of the Year in 1956, and the previous year [[Newsweek]] named him among the country's ten best preachers.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pittsburghexperiment.org/history&lt;/ref&gt;

While based in Pittsburgh, Shoemaker continued to tape his sermons as the "Episcopal Hour" (and during 1957-1958 the "Art of Living") for distribution by the National Council of the Churches of Christ. Shoemaker also evangelized among young people and in the surrounding area, including setting up an Oxford Group meeting in [[Akron, Ohio]]. Shoemaker also had a half hour radio show called "Faith that Works." After the break with the Oxford Group in 1941 mentioned below, Faith at Work meetings also resumed.

==Family Life==
[[File:Shoemaker family gravesite.jpg|150px|left|Helen and Sam Shoemakers' white gravestones in rear of Shoemaker family plot in St. Thomas' churchyard]]
His wife, [[Helen Smith Shoemaker]], whom he met at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] and married in 1925, was an author and sculptor as well as fellow church leader. They had two daughters, one of whom married a missionary who served in Asia, and the other of whom also traveled extensively abroad as the wife of a State Department official.

==Death and legacy==
Declining health caused Shoemaker to retire from Calvary Church and return home to Burnside, although he continued to broadcast Sunday sermons on the "Faith that Works" radio program from WBAL in Baltimore. He died after a prolonged illness on the eve of All Saints' Day, 1963, and was buried after a service at [[St. Thomas Church (Owings Mills, Maryland)|St. Thomas Church]] in Owings Mills, Baltimore County. He was interred in the family plot in the St. Thomas churchyard, as was his wife who died in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/73326782&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 7, 1963, an additional memorial service was held in his honor at Calvary Church in Pittsburgh, and later yet another at Calvary Church in Manhattan, with Dr. [[Norman Vincent Peale]] contributing material for the commemorative edition of 'Faith at Work' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;Shoemaker pp. 217-219&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Episcopal Church in the United States of America]] honors Shoemaker with a [[feast day]] on its [[Calendar of saints (Episcopal Church in the United States of America)|liturgical calendar]] on January 31.

==Alcoholics Anonymous==
Bill Wilson credited Sam Shoemaker as a key source of the ideas underpinning Alcoholics Anonymous:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"It was from Sam Shoemaker that we absorbed most of the Twelve Steps of Alcoholics Anonymous, steps that express the heart of AA's way of life. Dr. Silkworth gave us the needed knowledge of our illness, but Sam Shoemaker had given us the concrete knowledge of what we could do about it, he passed on the spiritual keys by which we were liberated. The early AA got its ideas of self-examination, acknowledgment of character defects, restitution for harm done, and working with others straight from the Oxford Group and directly from Sam Shoemaker, their former leader in America, and from nowhere else."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although Bill Wilson later said in an address about Shoemaker at the St Louis AA convention in 1955 alongside Father Ed. &lt;blockquote&gt;"It is through Sam, that most of our principles have come, that is he has been the connecting link for them, it is what Ebby learned from Sam and what Ebby told me that makes up the linkage between Sam the man of religion, and ourselves. How well I remember that first day I caught sight of Sam, it was a Sunday service in his church. I was still rather gun-shy and diffident about churches. I can still see him standing there before the lectern, and Sam's utter honesty, his tremendous forthrightness, his almost terrible sincerity struck me deep. I shall never forget it."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Shoemaker also addressed an AA group in Charlotte, North Carolina, June 17, 1962 saying:&lt;blockquote&gt;To set the record straight, that there has gotten going in AA, a kind of rumor, that I had a lot to do with the 12 steps. I didn't have anymore to do with those 12 steps other than that book had, those twelve steps, I believe came to Bill by himself, I think he told me they came to him in about 40 minutes and I think its one of the great instances of direct inspiration that I know in human history, inspiration which doesn't only bring material straight down outta heaven, but brings rather I think from God the ability to interpret human experience in such a way that you distill it down into transmissible principles, I compare it to Moses going up on a mountain and bringing down Ten tables of the Law, I don't think that's the first time Moses ever thought about righteousness, but I'm glad he went up there and got those ten and brought em down and gave em to us. And I'm glad Bill got quiet for those 40 minutes, until he finished off these 12 steps and I believe they have only been changed by about one word. Bill said at the end of this talk "Who invented AA?, It was God almighty that invented AA, but this is the story of how we learned to be Free." And he closed by saying "God grant that AA and the program of recovery, and unity, and service be a story that continues into the future as long as God needs it." Praise be to God for it, and for the life of that fellow and all those who were with him in the beginnings of this incredible movement.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Transformation of Faith at Work==
The Thursday evening sessions already alluded to, which were devoted to lay witnesses, provided models for subsequent Faith at Work programs. In it can be traced the lineaments of the "''witnesses''," still a part of the Faith at Work Conference ministry and of the spate of personal witness articles which appeared in the Calvary Evangel, and the Evangel and have continued in the pages of Faith At Work magazine. The "''Lay Witness Missions''," now conducted under other auspices than Faith at Work, also had their beginnings in the Thursday evening meetings.

The Thursday night "''witness''" sessions were paralleled by an activity which began in the Calvary House boiler room when the janitor, Herbie Lantau, witnessed to a painter named Bill Levine. They were later joined by Ralston Young, Red Cap #42, from Grand Central Station. Ralston did his witnessing to the people whose baggage he handled and later to groups that gathered for prayer in a car placed in a siding, on Track 13, at Grand Central.

This small group joined some others who were disenfranchised when the split came with MRA in 1942. They and many others met with Irving Harris whose work at the Calvary Evangel and later with its successors covered a period of over three decades. Irving gave structure to the Thursday evening services and was later the enabler of the Monday groups. These were to continue in one form or another until Faith at Work moved to Columbia, Maryland, in 1971.

According to Helen Shoemaker, Sam believed that "small group action ... always started with personal counseling" and then continued in the group. This is probably a carry-over from Sam's work in the Oxford Group where conversion or change was the starting point and the group sharing followed. Sam's often repeated triad, "Get changed, get together, and get going" also reflects this order. We shall have occasion to return to the topic in a subsequent section. 
An activity related to the Thursday night "witness" services was the work of "Alcoholics Anonymous." AA began under Sam's inspiration and meetings were held every Tuesday night in the Great Hall of Calvary House. The starting points of Faith at Work and AA were similar, although the latter obviously addressed itself to a more particular audience.

The first week-end conference of Faith at Work, the progenitor of hundreds of such conferences to be conducted all over the country, in subsequent years was held at Calvary House in 1943. The means and methods adopted for the conference included: &lt;blockquote&gt;
1) the Conversion of Individuals to Christ; 2) Listening to God; 3) Loyalty to the Church and the Bible; 4) Fellowship, Prayer, and Training Groups; 5) Literature; 6) Impact on Situations; 7) Cooperation between Christian Groups and People. Of these methods, the first, second, and fourth have strong affinities with the procedures of the Oxford Group.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''A Meeting in Print'''
 
Faith at Work would probably never have come into existence as an independent movement if it had not been for the growing influence of The Calvary Evangel, later called The Evangel, a magazine of Faith at Work, and still later simply Faith at Work. 
The Calvary Evangel started out as the monthly church publication of Calvary Church providing both parish information and fairly traditional inspiration from the time of its inception in 1888 until it was taken over by Sam Shoemaker and his friends in 1925. In 1930, Irving Harris became the editor of The Evangel on a part-time basis and from that time until Sam Shoemaker's departure for Pittsburgh at the end of 1951, it reflected faithfully the life style and point of view of its leadership. 
In 1942, the editor spoke of The Evangel as "a magazine for life changing and spiritual continuance and a regular means of keeping in touch with one another." 
A superficial analysis of the contents of The Evangel in the period 1925-51 suggests that in addition to serving as a newsletter, the magazine provided two kinds of input: 
  
&lt;blockquote&gt;
•	stories or witnesses of particular personal experiences of Christ and His power to change lives, and 
•	practical but more general and professional input on how to live the Christian life in a more formal and practical way. 
Sam Shoemaker's description of the Faith at Work magazine is apt for this period of the organization's life: 
Faith at Work is not a popular "how to get ahead" manual. It is not concerned with offering faith as the key to wealth, popularity, and success. It makes no attempt to prove that through faith life can be made easy; rather it tries to make clear that through faith at work life can be made great. Faith at Work is a meeting in print."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Books==
Shoemaker wrote over thirty books, about half of which were circulating before A.A.’s 12 Steps were first published in the Big Book in 1939. Shoemaker's books were circulated in New York, Akron, and the Oxford Group.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aa-history.com/samshoemaker.html AA History website], accessed 2007-06-03&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Self-advocacy''' refers to the [[civil rights]] movement for people with [[developmental disability|developmental disabilities]], also called cognitive or intellectual disabilities, and other [[disability|disabilities]]. It is also an important term in the [[disability rights movement]], referring to people with disabilities taking control of their own lives, including being in charge of their own care in the medical system. The self-advocacy movement is (in basic terms) about people with disabilities speaking up for themselves. It means that although a person with a disability may call upon the support of others, the individual is entitled to be in control of their own resources and how they are directed. It is about having the right to make life decisions without undue influence or control by others.

People with intellectual disabilities are often some of the most powerless members of society. They may live in large institutions or in smaller residences known as [[group home]]s which are staff-directed environments where residents have little or no control over their living conditions or with whom they share their living space. People with intellectual disabilities are extremely vulnerable to abuse due to their social and physical isolation. They are eight to ten times more likely to suffer [[sexual abuse]] than the non-disabled population.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

The self-advocacy movement seeks to reduce the isolation of people with disabilities and give them the tools and experience to take greater control over their own lives. The self-advocacy movement for people with intellectual disabilities lags far behind many other civil rights efforts, such as those related to race or physical disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What is self advocacy?|url=http://www.inclusionbc.org/what-is-self-advocacy|website=Inclusion BC|publisher=Inclusion BC}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is due to many factors including low literacy and other communication challenges that are a barrier for people with intellectual disabilities.

The self-advocacy movement for people with disabilities has its roots in the broader civil rights movements of the 1960s and 1970s but is in many respects still in its infancy. In North America the self-advocacy movement is led by a national organization called [[Self Advocates Becoming Empowered]] (SABE)&lt;ref&gt;http://sabeusa.org&lt;/ref&gt; and supported by a relatively small number of organizations, such as ACT in the United States&lt;ref&gt;http://self-advocacy.org&lt;/ref&gt; and LiveWorkPlay in Canada and internationally through the People First organization.

==Medical and psychiatric patients==
In the [[medical]] and [[psychiatric]] areas, emphasis is placed on self-advocacy or self-empowerment ([[patient empowerment]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Honey|first1=Anne|title=Empowerment versus power: Consumer participation in mental health services|journal=Occupational Therapy International|date=1999|volume=6|issue=4|pages=257–276}}&lt;/ref&gt; This emphasis started in the psychiatric field during the 1970s, not only to advocate for needed changes in the delivery of services but to encourage patients to take a more active role in their own care.

Similar changes occurred in the medical area, especially in the 1980s with the beginnings of [[palliative care|hospice]] and [[home care]]/home health care industries. Patients since the 1980s have been encouraged to become participants in their own care and to become knowledgeable consumers of the services of medical care. In the UK for example, the government has largely contributed to encouraging patients to become more active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Spencer|first1=John|last2=Godolphin|first2=William|last3=Karpenko|first3=Natalia|last4=Towle|first4=Angela|title=Report: Can patients be teachers? Involving patients and service users in healthcare professionals' education|date=October 2011|publisher=The Health Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government has focused on developing information services such as the [[National Health Service]]'s ''NHS Direct'' and ''NHS Direct Online''.

As the medical field has become more complex, along with the myriad of problems with [[health insurance|insurance]] coverage, patients have had to become stronger self-advocates for their own care and for the insurance coverage due in their case. Every time people speak up for themselves to resolve a problem, they are practicing self-advocacy. Patients should know their rights, and be willing to honor themselves by being proactive in their care. In all medical situations, patients must be given, must read, and must sign [[Informed consent|medical consent]] before procedures, tests or surgery. If patients do not understand anything about their care, they should ask questions. The simple act of asking questions and fully understanding what will be done in your care is an act of self-advocacy. Through being one's own advocate there is patient empowerment.

Self-advocacy can include any action, verbal or written, which is intended to outline and describe a particular problem an individual is encountering. Self-advocacy is intended to create the interest and action by another person to assist the person in resolving the specific problem. Thus, a person might be self-advocating to an individual (such as directly to a nurse or doctor), to an institution (such as a hospital, clinic, or agency), or to a company or organized body (such as an insurance company or a government agency.)

Since individuals know their own situations the best, they can often be the best advocates for themselves.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} It helps if they can communicate a description of the problem in clear and concise fashion, and are able to listen to the responses from the person/agency to whom they bring the problem.

Patients are often more successful at self-advocacy if the particular problem they are describing also connects to some aspect protected under the [[Patients' rights|Patient Bill of Rights]]. However, self-advocacy can also resolve other situations, such as differences of opinion between the patient and doctor, or personality conflicts, or even minor problems in delivery of health care.

==Opposition==
* Dixon-Woods&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dixon-Woods|first1=Mary|title=Writing wrongs? An analysis of published discourses about the use of patient information leaflets|journal=Social Science &amp; Medicine|date=May 2001|volume=52|issue=9|pages=1417–1432}}&lt;/ref&gt; studied patient information leaflets and found they privileged the [[biomedical]] model's explanations for illness and disease. Other models providing information and knowledge about health are therefore ignored. By failing to provide alternatives to the biomedical, model patients are forced to comply with the biomedical model. This means they may not be empowered insomuch as they are not as free to choose between a number of models on health as a result of being unaware of these alternatives. For example, alternative therapies may not be recognized as valuable. This explains how when people do use alternative therapies, they often use them alongside more traditional forms of medicine. Traditional forms of medicine based on the biomedical model are trusted more. Nevertheless, there has been an increase in the use of alternative medicine, so the biomedical model may not be as strong as it once was.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eisenberg|first1=D.M.|last2=Davis|first2=R.B.|last3=Ettner|first3=S.L.|last4=Appel|first4=S|last5=Wilkey|first5=S|last6=Van Rompay|first6=M|last7=Kessler|first7=R.C.|title=Trends in alternative medicine use in the United States, 1990-1997: results of a follow-up national survey|journal=JAMA|date=11 November 1998 |volume=280|issue=18|pages=1569–75|pmid=9820257}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Zola claims there is still evidence suggesting some believe certain information within medicine should be confined to the sphere of the experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zola |first=I.K. |author-link=Irving Zola |date=1975 |chapter=Medicine as an Institution of Social Control |editor1-last=Cox |editor1-first=Caroline |editor2-last=Mead |editor2-first=Adrianne |title=A Sociology of Medical Practice |location=London |publisher=Collier-MacMillan |oclc=911274466 |isbn=978-0-02-972750-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Pages needed|date=October 2017}} Therefore, if some knowledge or information is excluded from the public, the public lacks power to challenge this knowledge or information. This is because the public could be entirely unaware of the existence of this information or knowledge. In this way the extent of the public's self-advocacy of the public is challenged and the public lacks power. This is because, as [[Michel Foucault|Foucault]] claimed, power and knowledge coincide.
* Increased medicalization is evident in that everyone{{citation needed|date=October 2017}} believes there are problems with their mental or physical health.{{According to whom|date=April 2014}} This is usually phrased in positive terms of believing their body or health may be able to be improved upon. Responsibility is placed{{by whom|date=October 2017}} on patients themselves to take greater roles in their own health care through self-advocacy. Nevertheless, medicalization critics{{specify|date=October 2017}} say that if our problems are described in biological or medical terms, this overlooks the fact that our problems are often caused by social factors. Medicalization critics{{specify|date=October 2017}} claim society is able to relinquish responsibility to solve problems caused by social factors, linked to structural problems in society. They{{Who|date=October 2017}} claim that society does so by handing responsibility to patients to seek medical solutions for individual problems. Therefore, self-advocacy may not always be entirely positive.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}
* Lupton{{Nonspecific|date=October 2017}} questions whether self-advocacy is always possible or even beneficial for patients. He claims that in cases of intense suffering and maybe even possibility of death, for the doctor to take on an absolutely authoritative controlling role may be important as a form of comfort. Ideas on self-advocacy tend to promote ideas of patients as being rational at times of illness, so detached from one's emotions, themselves maybe be produced by one's illness. Nevertheless, such detachment is not always possible. Lack of rationality here may be considered as negative in that it can create dependency seen as weakness. However, Lupton{{Nonspecific|date=October 2017}} says there are also disadvantages for patients responding with greater levels of self-advocacy. To question the doctor's expert knowledge, can undermine the trust in doctors, and faith in their expert knowledge, needed to comfort the extremely ill.

==Role of the Internet==
{{See also|Health information on the Internet}}
Many{{Who|date=October 2017}} claim the [[Internet]] is a powerful tool for self-advocacy. This is because one may be able to research the risks and benefits of a number of different treatments. One can also use it to become better informed of a variety of explanations of one's illness. Patients are able to create their own web pages to provide knowledge about illnesses and build support communities.

Nevertheless, Henwood, Wyatt, Hart and Smith challenge the extent to which others claim the internet is able to promote self-advocacy. They did research on thirty-two women wanting to know about how [[hormone replacement therapy]] (HRT) could relieve menopausal symptoms.&lt;ref name=Henwood&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Henwood |first1=Flis |last2=Wyatt |first2=Sally |last3=Hart |first3=Angie |last4=Smith |first4=Julie |date=September 2003 |title='Ignorance is bliss sometimes': constraints on the emergence of the 'informed patient' in the changing landscapes of health information |journal=Sociology of Health &amp; Illness |volume=25 |issue=6 |pages=589–607 |pmid=12919447 |doi=10.1111/1467-9566.00360 |doi-access=free }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}} They point out that to become informed of one's illness and treatments in this way, requires having skills to be able to access this information using the internet in the first place. Also, one has to start out with some knowledge to distinguish the usefulness of different types of information and decipher what information is valid. As one of their research participants claimed, much information can be gotten from the internet but unlike a doctor, the internet is unable to answer questions about specific information found. Henwood ''et al.'' felt that strategies that the patients used for searching for information on the internet were unsystematic.&lt;ref name=Henwood/&gt;{{Primary source inline|date=October 2017}} Therefore, research participants were unaware of the commercial interests many sites had. For example, many sites created by lay people are sponsored by large pharmaceutical companies in return for the site's promotion of their drug.

==Effect of the patient-doctor relationship==
{{See also|Doctor–patient relationship}}
* Drug companies claim the role of advertising drugs is for patients to become more aware of options of treatment available. They are then able to ask their doctor about whether the treatment would be appropriate for them. Therefore, there at least seems to be the potential for patients to become more active in their own health care this way by introducing them to different options available.
* Fuller{{nonspecific|date=October 2017}} claims that despite the public recognizing that certain scientific knowledge in the past has been discredited, scientists still present a history of advancement overcoming past weaknesses. This means the medical model of treating illness and disease is still dominant. Therefore, doctors are treated as experts on medical and increasingly other matters, as the process of medicalization indicates. If an expert fails to be correct, trust between them and their client is broken. Nevertheless, Fuller{{nonspecific|date=October 2017}} believes the client is excused too easily after all they have chosen the wrong expert or model of expertise for their case. Therefore, Fuller{{nonspecific|date=October 2017}} advocates self-advocacy in patient's relationships with their doctors. Wisdom is required to choose the correct expert. Wisdom is also needed for the expert to present themselves as competent at solving particular individual cases. A problem may emerge however when the expert refocuses the client's problem to correspond to their type of expertise, as opposed to what is needed for the client's individual case. Fuller{{nonspecific|date=October 2017}} questions whether scientists' research is valid concerning whether they can get consistent results where these results are important (in cases the results are actually really applicable to).
* Todd argues many may feel unable to challenge doctors.&lt;ref name=Todd1989&gt;{{cite book |last=Todd |first=Alexandra Dundas |date=1989 |title=Intimate Adversaries: Cultural Conflict Between Doctors and Women Patients |location=Philadelphia |publisher=University of Pennsylvania Press |oclc=760603907 |isbn=978-0-8122-8152-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}} Doctors are often viewed as having good intentions and as wanting to help patients. Therefore, many feel uncomfortable questioning the form of "help" doctors give them, even if the patient feels the form of help may potentially be inappropriate.
* Moreover, Todd claims that the traditional sexist view of women as too emotional and irrational is perpetuated by medicine.&lt;ref name=Todd1989/&gt;{{Page needed|date=October 2017}} There is evidence to suggest women's complaints are taken less seriously than men's as doctors view them as over-emotional and therefore, exaggerating their symptoms. Symonds{{Full citation needed|date=October 2017}} claims doctors feel that when women ask doctors questions, thus being active in their own health care, this is taken as unnatural as women are traditionally considered as passive.

==Role of public intellectuals==
{{Pro and con list|section|date=October 2017}}

===In promotion===
* Intellectuals are said to speak on behalf of the public so may potentially promote self-agency concerning health matters. Parsi and Geraghty point out [[bioethics]] is especially relevant to the public as science is influencing people's lives further.&lt;ref name=Parsi_and_Geraghty&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Parsi |first1=Kayhan P. |last2=Geraghty |first2=Karen E. |date=Winter 2004 |title=The Bioethicist as Public Intellectual |journal=American Journal of Bioethics |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=W17–W23 |pmid=15035927 |doi=10.1162/152651604773067514}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, bioethicists can inform the public about these health issues as being very relevant to their lives. To be democratic, Parsi and Geraghty claim the public should be educated on matters, so they can take part in defining and shaping issues.&lt;ref name=Parsi_and_Geraghty/&gt;
* Intellectuals are said to present their ideas using a variety of different media. Parsi and Geraghty point out bioethicists may need training as part of their course in using a variety of media to become public intellectuals.&lt;ref name=Parsi_and_Geraghty/&gt; Though bioethicists academics use a variety of media Parsi and Geraghty point out that this is usually in the [[expert]] role.&lt;ref name=Parsi_and_Geraghty/&gt; This means the information presented by them is harnessed only for specific concerns taken out of the larger context.
* Intellectuals often choose to support ideas for their use value. Fuller{{nonspecific|date=October 2017}} points out this is what we should do when judging knowledge given to us by scientists. Scientists are often successful at finding facts, but in medicine the use value of such facts is especially important. Therefore, medicalization critics{{specify|date=October 2017}} may question the use value of medicalization claiming [[disease mongering]] is taking place. It is said{{by whom|date=October 2017}} that pharmaceutical companies want more money and power to create new categories of illnesses treatable by drugs already existing.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}} In this way, categories of what is considered normal or healthy become smaller. Medicine intrudes into people's lives more and more exerting greater control and influence when this control and influence may not be necessary.
* Intellectuals may uphold ideas that politicize and create new social groups. In this case the intellectual may help patients lacking health insurance barred from certain treatments they cannot afford. Also, they may question how many off-label treatments are not covered by insurance. This means patients who are able to afford it pay themselves, which creates inequalities in health as others do not have the means to do this. Intellectuals may also challenge medicine for possibly claiming illnesses largely caused by structural inequalities, are caused purely by biological factors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Germov|first1=John|title=Imagining Health Problems as Social Issues|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Intellectuals may defend absent ideals like in this case, they may advocate the idea of the patient as taking on a consumer role actively participating in their own health care. On the other hand, intellectuals may defend the [[status quo]]. Defending the status quo may not mean they are being conservative but may be supporting fading ideals in society. For example, in medicine's case they may criticize how the health care system now is commercially driven. Therefore, doctors and [[pharmaceutical companies]] may be more concerned with profit than patient well-being much of the time.
* Intellectuals may contribute to the public questioning if they are mistaken in accepting ideas that are unquestioned as being possibly wrong by society. In the case of medicine, there is proof doctors are not trusted as much.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Blendon|first1=Robert J.|last2=Benson|first2=John M.|last3=Hero|first3=Joachim O.|title=Public Trust in Physicians — U.S. Medicine in International Perspective|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=23 October 2014|volume=371|issue=17|pages=1570–1572|doi=10.1056/NEJMp1407373|pmid=25337746}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the authority of medicine as a whole is still upheld and respected. Moreover, even in relations with doctors patients on the whole still decide to take on passive patient roles. Intellectuals may help the public to question if passively accepting doctors' and medicine's claims is beneficial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kaba|first1=P|last2=Sooriakumaran|first2=P|title=The evolution of the doctor-patient relationship|journal=International Journal of Surgery|date=February 2007|volume=5|issue=1|pages=57–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===In opposition===
* Posner&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Posner|first1=Richard|title=Public Intellectuals: A Study of Decline|date=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims intellectuals may question ideas when they have no proof that these could be wrong or may have poor evidence. Indeed, Parsi and Geraghty claim there is a danger of this for bioethicists as bioethics advances so quickly but facts must be established before questioning takes place.&lt;ref name=Parsi_and_Geraghty/&gt;
* Lippmann&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Whitehead|first1=Amy Solomon|title=The Unattainable Ideal: Walter Lippmann and the Limits of the Press and Public Opinion|journal=LSU Master Theses'|date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; claims the public cannot have knowledge about everything so therefore, experts are needed to produce knowledge on behalf of the public and make decisions for them so the public cannot make wrong decisions due to lack of complete knowledge on the subject. Therefore, Parsi and Geraghty say academic experts often see the public as being unable to further academic research interests, or shape academics' intellectual ideas.&lt;ref name=Parsi_and_Geraghty/&gt; Democracy for Lippmann consists of the public electing a party in charge who makes decisions for them.
* However, Dewey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dewey|first1=John|title=Democracy and education: An introduction to the philosophy of education|date=1916|publisher=The Free Press|location=New York, NY}}&lt;/ref&gt; believes though that the public is able to participate in democracy. They can do this by helping create knowledge used by society as a whole. The public is passive in society because they have formed the habit of being passive, not because they are incapable of being active agents. Whipple claims the number of participants taking part in knowledge creation is more imp than variety of ideas discussed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Whipple |first=Mark |date=June 2005 |title=The Dewey-Lippmann Debate Today: Communication Distortions, Reflective Agency, and Participatory Democracy |journal=Sociological Theory |volume=23 |issue=2 |pages=156–178 |doi=10.1111/j.0735-2751.2005.00248.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Slain in the Spirit''' or '''slaying in the Spirit''' are terms used by [[Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic Christianity|charismatic Christians]] to describe a form of [[prostration]] in which an individual falls to the floor while experiencing [[religious ecstasy]]. Believers attribute this behavior to the power of the [[Holy Spirit in Christianity|Holy Spirit]]. Other terms used to describe the experience include '''falling under the power''', '''overcome by the Spirit''', and '''resting in the Spirit'''.&lt;ref name='NIDPCM "slain"'&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burgess|first1=Stanley M.|first2=Eduard M.|last2=van der Maas|title=The New International Dictionary of Pentecostal and Charismatic Movements s.v. "Slain in the Spirit"|year=2002|publisher=[[Zondervan]]|isbn=0-310-22481-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The practice is associated with [[faith healing]] because individuals are often slain while seeking prayer for illness.

Christians who support the practice cite biblical evidence for its authenticity and use. Christians who oppose the practice dispute the interpretation of those [[Bible]] passages, arguing that there is no biblical precedent and that the practice may be [[satan]]ic in origin. Those skeptical of the practice have explained it as being caused by [[hypnosis]], [[autosuggestion]], or [[peer pressure]].

==Description==
Sociologist [[Margaret Poloma]] has defined slaying in the Spirit as "the power of the Holy Spirit so filling a person with a heightened inner awareness that the body's energy fades away and the person collapses to the floor".&lt;ref name=Crossroads&gt;{{cite book|last=Poloma|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Poloma|title=The Assemblies of God at the Crossroads: Charisma and Institutional Dilemmas|year=1989|publisher=The University of Tennessee Press|location=Knoxville}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} Slaying in the Spirit may occur in a variety of settings, including while a person prays in solitude. However, it usually occurs in group settings, including small prayer groups, religious conferences or retreats, regular church services and large [[healing crusade]]s.&lt;ref name=Sacred/&gt;{{rp|232}}

In church services or healing crusades, attendees may be invited to the front of the church or other venue to receive prayer from a [[Minister (Christianity)|minister]] or a team of ministers.&lt;ref name=Chaos&gt;{{cite book|last=MacArthur|first=John F.|authorlink=John F. MacArthur|title=Charismatic Chaos: Signs and Wonders; Speaking in Tongues; Health, Wealth and Prosperity|year=1993|publisher=Zondervan|location=Grand Rapids}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|91}} Often, the prayer is accompanied with the [[laying on of hands]] and [[anointing with oil]]. Those being prayed for perceive the Spirit of God upon them and they fall, usually onto their backs. In most cases, their fall is broken by ushers or "catchers". Once fallen, a person may lay on the floor face up and eyes closed for several seconds to several hours in some cases.&lt;ref name=Sacred&gt;{{cite book|last=Csordas|first=Thomas J.|title=The Sacred Self: A Cultural Phenomenology of Charismatic Healing|year=1997|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|232–233}}

People who have experienced the phenomenon report different degrees of awareness ranging from total consciousness to complete unconsciousness. They also report feelings of peace and relaxation.&lt;ref name=Sacred /&gt;{{rp|241}} While lying down, they may [[speak in tongues]], laugh, weep or speak praises to God.&lt;ref name='NIDPCM "slain"' /&gt; According to anthropologist Thomas Csordas:

{{quote|In Charismatic ritual life, resting in the Spirit can serve the purposes of demonstrating divine power; of exhibiting the faith of those who are "open" to such power; of allowing a person to be close to, "touched by," or "spoken to" by God (sometimes via embodied imagery); of preparing a person to receive and exercise a [[spiritual gift]]; or of healing.&lt;ref name=Sacred /&gt;{{rp|247}}}}

Not all incidents of falling or swooning in Pentecostal and charismatic churches are attributed to the Holy Spirit. Besides the possibility of fraud, charismatics may also attribute the behavior to [[demon]]ic activity.&lt;ref name=Sacred /&gt;{{rp|229}} Analyzing accounts of early Pentecostal religious ecstasy, historian [[Grant Wacker]] concluded that communal cues helped religious communities determine whether specific incidents were instigated by the Holy Spirit or not.&lt;ref name=HeavenBelow&gt;{{cite book|last=Wacker|first=Grant|title=Heaven Below : Early Pentecostals and American Culture|year=2001|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56}} Other explanations of the phenomenon have also been proposed, such as [[autosuggestion]], peer pressure, or a desire to experience what others have experienced. In addition, sociologists note that similar phenomena, such as [[spirit possession]] and [[trance]], can be found in other religions.&lt;ref name='NIDPCM "slain"' /&gt;

[[Joe Nickell]], writing in the [[Skeptical Inquirer]], observed the use of slaying in the Spirit during a [[Benny Hinn]] healing crusade in 2001. He compared the practice to [[hypnosis]], writing that participants "merely engage in a form of role-playing that is prompted by their strong desire to receive divine power as well as by the influence of suggestion that they do so&amp;nbsp;... In short, they behave just as if 'hypnotized.{{' "}} According to Nickell, a professional hypnotist stated that "This is something we do every day".&lt;ref name=CSI&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nickell | first = Joe | author-link = Joe Nickell | title = Benny Hinn: Healer or Hypnotist? | journal = Skeptical Inquirer | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = | publisher = [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] | date = May–June 2002| language = | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/benny_hinn_healer_or_hypnotist | access-date = June 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Beginning with the [[First Great Awakening]] that impacted Protestant Europe as well as Britain's [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]] in the eighteenth century, bodily movements became a prominent and controversial part of Protestant [[Christian revival|revivalism]]. Supporters of the revivals within various denominations including [[Presbyterians]], [[Congregationalists]], [[Baptists]] and [[Methodists]] argued that trembling, groaning, screaming and falling to the ground "as dead" were signs of divine power in those who were becoming aware of their own [[sin]]fulness. This bodily agitation, as well as the problem of sin and guilt, was resolved through a conscious [[Born again (Christianity)|conversion experience]], which was marked by peace and joy.&lt;ref name=Jeffrey&gt;{{cite book|last=Williams|first=Jeffrey|title=Religion and Violence in Early American Methodism : Taking the Kingdom by Force|year=2010|publisher=Indiana University Press|location=Bloomington, Indiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|35}}

[[John Wesley]], the founder of Methodism, considered falling down and other bodily movements to be natural (not [[supernatural]]) human responses to the supernatural "testimony" or "witness" of the Holy Spirit in conversion. Occasionally, Wesley attributed bodily movements to [[Satan]]'s attempt at disrupting the conversion process, but at other times, he described bodily movements as natural human responses to [[Love of God (Christianity)|God's love]].&lt;ref name=Jeffrey/&gt;{{rp|36}} Wesley, [[George Whitefield]] and [[Jonathan Edwards (theologian)|Jonathan Edwards]] all record instances of people falling during their ministries. During the [[Second Great Awakening]] of the early nineteenth century, [[Peter Cartwright (revivalist)|Peter Cartwright]] and [[Charles G. Finney]] also recorded similar behavior.&lt;ref name='NIDPCM "slain"'/&gt;

In the twentieth century, "prostrate trance" became chiefly associated with Pentecostalism and its offshoots. Historian Grant Wacker argues that early Pentecostals replaced the [[liturgies]] and [[sacrament]]s of traditional churches with the "disciplined use of ecstasy", including the regular occurrence of slaying in the Spirit. Regarding the sacramental undertones of slaying in the Spirit, Wacker writes:

{{quote|In those situations Christ's physical death and resurrection was re-embodied—not just reenacted but literally re-embodied—night after night, before the very eyes of believers and nonbelievers alike. In one account after another we read that prostrate worshipers covered the floor. The stories sometimes stated and often implied that no one was left standing, which suggests that prostration gained a ritualistic significance comparable, perhaps, to kneeling or genuflecting in liturgical church traditions.&lt;ref name=HeavenBelow/&gt;{{rp|108}}}}

The frequency of slaying in the Spirit and the importance that Pentecostals placed on it decreased over time as Pentecostals rose to the ranks of the middle class and attempted to shed the stereotype of being "[[Holy Rollers]]" (a derogatory term derived from instances of people literally rolling in the aisles when [[baptism with the Holy Spirit|baptized in the Holy Spirit]]).&lt;ref name=Crossroads/&gt;{{rp|84}} In 1989, Margaret Poloma noted that some pastors and even high ranking leaders within the [[Assemblies of God USA]], a Pentecostal denomination, were critical of the practice.&lt;ref name=Crossroads/&gt;{{rp|272}}

Slaying in the Spirit saw a resurgence during the 1960s and 1970s due to the influence of the [[charismatic movement]], which disseminated Pentecostal beliefs and practices among [[mainline Protestants]] and [[Roman Catholic]]s. During the 1980s, it experienced another surge in visibility due to the influence of [[John Wimber]], an [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] pastor and founder of the [[Vineyard Movement]].&lt;ref name=Sacred /&gt;{{rp|230–231}}

==Biblical basis==
[[Michael L. Brown|Michael Brown]] quotes a number of scriptures which he claims support the practice of being slain in the Spirit.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Michael L. ''Let No One Deceive You.'' Shippensburg, PA: Destiny Image, 1997. ({{ISBN|1-5604-3693-X}})&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Wayne Grudem]] states that while the phrase "slaying in the Spirit" is not found in Scripture, there are a number of instances where people are described as falling to the ground or falling into a trance in the presence of God.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne A. Grudem, Systematic Theology: An Introduction to Biblical Doctrine (Leicester, England; Grand Rapids, MI: Inter-Varsity Press; Zondervan Pub. House, 2004), 640.&lt;/ref&gt;

Others refute these claims. Calvinist pastor and author [[John F. MacArthur|John MacArthur]] argues the practice is neither described nor prescribed specifically in the Bible and that it is, at best, of satanic origin.&lt;ref&gt;MacArthur, John F. Jr. ''Charismatic Chaos: Signs and Wonders; Speaking in Tongues; Health, Wealth and Prosperity.'' Grand Rapids, MI: Zondervan, 1993 ({{ISBN|0-3105-7572-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Pawson]], a Bible teacher and charismatic Christian, states the closest Biblical reference is the story of [[Ananias and Sapphira]], which has a quite different connotation.&lt;ref&gt;Pawson, David. ''Is the Blessing Biblical?'' London: Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1996 ({{ISBN|0-3406-6147-X}})&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew J. Slick|Matthew Slick]] of the [[Christian Apologetics and Research Ministry]] advises caution and discernment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What does it mean to be slain in the Spirit? |url=https://carm.org/questions/about-church/what-does-it-mean-be-slain-spirit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stanine''' (STAndard NINE) is a method of scaling test scores on a nine-point standard scale with a [[mean]] of five and a [[standard deviation]] of two.

Some web sources attribute stanines to the [[United States Army Air Forces|U.S. Army Air Forces]] during [[World War II]]. Psychometric legend has it that a 1-9 scale was used because of the compactness of recording the score as a single digit but Thorndike&lt;ref&gt;Thorndike, R. L.  (1982).  Applied Psychometrics. Boston, MA: Houghton Mifflin&lt;/ref&gt;  claims that by reducing scores to just nine values, stanines "reduce the tendency to try to interpret small score differences (p. 131)". The earliest known use of stanines was by the U.S. Army Air Forces in 1943.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}}

==Calculation==
Test scores are scaled to stanine scores using the following algorithm:
# Rank results from lowest to highest
# Give the lowest 4% a stanine of 1, the next 7% a stanine of 2, etc., according to the following table:

{| class="wikitable" style="text-align:center"
|+ Calculating Stanines

| '''Result Ranking'''|| width="9%" |4%|| width="9%" |7%|| width="9%" |12%|| width="9%" |17%|| width="9%" |20%|| width="9%" |17%|| width="9%" |12%|| width="9%" |7%|| width="9%" |4%

|}

The underlying basis for obtaining stanines is that a [[normal distribution]] is divided into nine intervals, each of which has a width of 0.5 standard deviations excluding the first and last, which are just the remainder (the tails of the distribution). The mean lies at the centre of the fifth interval.

==Use today==
Today stanines are mostly used in educational assessment.{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} 
* The [[University of Alberta]] in [[Edmonton, Alberta]], Canada used the stanine system until 2003, when it switched to a 4-point scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/ro.cfm?id=184 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-01-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061212012831/http://www.registrar.ualberta.ca/ro.cfm?id=184 |archivedate=2006-12-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  
* In the United States, the [[Educational Records Bureau]] (they administer the "ERBs") reports test scores as stanines and percentiles.
* The [[NZCER|New Zealand Council for Educational Research]] uses stanines.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nzcersupport.org.nz/marking/?p=75 "Understanding Stanines"], nzcersupport.org.nz&lt;/ref&gt;
* GL Assessment use stanines alongside SAS (Standardised Age Scores) to express the results of its CAT4 assessments, used in many UK and British international schools &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gl-assessment.co.uk/products/cat4-cognitive-abilities-test-fourth-edition "GL Assessment"]&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Otis-Lennon School Ability Test]] uses a stanine system along with percentiles.

'''Stephen Henry Lewis''' {{Post-nominals|country=CAN|CC}} (born November 11, 1937) is a [[Canadians|Canadian]] politician, public speaker, broadcaster and [[diplomacy|diplomat]]. He was the leader of the [[social democracy|social democratic]] [[Ontario New Democratic Party]] for most of the 1970s.

During many of those years as leader, his father [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]] was simultaneously the leader of the federal [[New Democratic Party of Canada|New Democratic Party]]. After politics, he became a broadcaster on both [[CBC Radio]] and Toronto's [[Citytv]]. In the mid-1980s, he was appointed as Canada's [[United Nations]] ambassador, by Progressive Conservative Prime Minister [[Brian Mulroney]]. He quit in 1988 and worked at various United Nations agencies during the 1990s. In the 2000s, he served a term as the United Nations' [[special envoy]] for [[HIV/AIDS in Africa]]. In 2003, he gained investiture into the [[Order of Canada]]. As of 2014, he is a Distinguished Visiting Professor at [[Ryerson University]] in [[Toronto]].

==Early life and education==
Stephen Lewis was born in [[Ottawa, Ontario]], on November 11, 1937, to Sophie Lewis (née Carson) and [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]].&lt;ref name ="Smith, p. 258"&gt;Smith, p.258&lt;/ref&gt; His parents gave him the Hebrew name "Sholem", a [[Yiddish]] derivation of the Hebrew word ''shalom'', which means peace, because he was born on [[Armistice Day]].&lt;ref name ="Smith, p. 330"&gt;Smith, p.330&lt;/ref&gt; From the time he was born, and through his early childhood, his father was the National Secretary of the [[Co-operative Commonwealth Federation]] (CCF), the predecessor party to the NDP.&lt;ref name ="Age question"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Frayne | first = Trent | title =David Lewis has it all to win NDP leadership except for his age: 61 | newspaper = [[The Toronto Star]] | location = Toronto | page = 11  | date = 1971-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; When his family moved to [[Toronto]] in 1950, he attended  secondary school first at Toronto's Oakwood Collegiate, and then his final three years of high school at [[Harbord Collegiate Institute]].&lt;ref name ="Smith, p.338"&gt;Smith, p.338&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1956, he entered the [[University of Toronto]] (UofT) where he became a member of the [[Hart House (University of Toronto)|Hart House]] debating committee, and on 14 November 1957, debated the senator and future American president, [[John F. Kennedy]], on the question, "Has the United States failed in its responsibilities as a world leader?"&lt;ref name ="Smith, pp. 382-383"&gt;Smith, p.382-383&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Varsity"&gt;{{Cite news | newspaper = The Varsity | location = Toronto | publisher = University of Toronto | date = 1957-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Senator narrowly beat the Hart House team 204-194.&lt;ref name ="Kennedy"&gt;{{Cite news | title = U.S. Senator Sees Mideast Strife | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]]  |location = Toronto | page = 4 | date = 1957-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis's performance was considered the highlight of the event, while Kennedy's was flat according to many members in the audience like [[John Brewin]].&lt;ref name ="Smith, pp. 382-383"/&gt; He spent his third year of university at the [[University of British Columbia]] (UBC) before spending his final undergraduate year back at UofT where he failed to write his final examinations.&lt;ref name ="Smith, p. 365-366"&gt;Smith, pp.365-366&lt;/ref&gt;  He went to law school twice in the early 1960s, dropping out of both UofT and UBC's programs.&lt;ref name ="Smith, p. 365-366"/&gt;

==Political career==
He left his studies in the 1960s and took up a clerical position with the [[Socialist International]], where he received an invitation to a conference in Ghana. He attended, and instead of returning to Canada, spent more than a year working, traveling, and teaching in various places in Africa. He recalled in his 2005 [[Massey Lectures]] that the relatively brief sojourn would be a key influence on his life, especially after the turn of the new millennium.

He came back to Canada at the instigation of [[Tommy Douglas]], and in 1963, at the age of 26, he was elected to the [[Legislative Assembly of Ontario]]. Following the engineered 1970 resignation of [[Donald C. MacDonald]],&lt;ref&gt;MacDonald, pp. 151-152&lt;/ref&gt; Lewis was elected leader of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]]. His initial experience at the helm in the [[Ontario general election, 1971|1971 provincial election]] was a disappointment, with the party slipping from 20 seats to 19.

A radical left wing group nicknamed [[The Waffle]] had gained prominence, with one of its leaders, [[James Laxer]], winning one-third of the vote when he ran to be leader of the federal NDP in 1971. Lewis felt that The Waffle was threatening the credibility and stability of the party and supported a movement against the group in June 1972 on the basis that it was a ''party within a party''.&lt;ref name="waffle ends"&gt;McLeod &amp; McLeod, pp.360-362&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis led a strong campaign during the [[Ontario general election, 1975|1975 election]] with his oratory and passion bringing new supporters to the party. The NDP highlighted issues such as rent control and workplace safety. Each day, Lewis told the story of a different Ontarian in trouble, making a case that this was because of the lack of adequate legislation. Polls showed the NDP surging and the incumbent [[Ontario Progressive Conservative Party]] in freefall and in the course of the campaign [[Premier (Canada)|Premier]] [[Bill Davis|William Davis]] was forced to commit his party to bringing in [[rent control]] and other progressive reforms in order to retain power. When the ballots were counted the Tories were reduced to a [[minority government]]. Lewis' NDP had doubled its seats from 19 to 38, surpassing the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] to become the [[Official Opposition]]. To some it appeared that it was only a matter of time before the NDP would form the government.

The next election, in [[Ontario general election, 1977|1977]], proved to be a disappointment. The growth of support for the NDP stalled, and while the Tories were kept to a minority, the NDP failed to make any gains. The party was reduced to 33 seats and lost its status as Official Opposition to the Liberals. In 1978, a frustrated Lewis stepped down as party leader and as a [[Member of Provincial Parliament (Ontario)|Member of Provincial Parliament]].

==Diplomatic and academic career==
[[Image:Stephen-Lewis 2006-01-30.jpg|thumb|250 px|Stephen Lewis, speaking at the [[University of Alberta]], January 30, 2006]]

After working for several years as a labour mediator, columnist and broadcaster, in 1984 Lewis was appointed [[Permanent Representative of Canada to the United Nations]] by [[Governor General of Canada|Governor General]] [[Jeanne Sauvé]], on the advice of [[Prime Minister of Canada|Prime Minister]] [[Brian Mulroney]]. Lewis served at the post until 1988. In the 1980s, he became a familiar voice appearing  with [[Dalton Camp]] and [[Eric Kierans]] as part of a weekly political panel on [[Peter Gzowski]]'s [[CBC Radio One|CBC Radio]] show, ''[[Morningside (radio program)|Morningside]]''.

From 1995 to 1999, Lewis was Deputy Director of [[UNICEF]]. From 2001 until 2006, he worked as United Nations [[UN Special Envoy for HIV/AIDS in Africa]]. In this role, he drew attention to the HIV/AIDS crisis and convinced leaders and the public that they have a responsibility to respond. He has been widely praised for his effectiveness in this role. In 2005 he adapted his [[Massey Lectures]] in a book titled "[[Race Against Time (Lewis)|Race Against Time]]", where he describes the disjuncture between what the international community promises and their actions in responding to the pandemic in Africa.

In May 2006, Lewis joined the Faculty of Social Sciences at [[McMaster University]] as a Scholar-in-Residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Christmas | first = Jane | title = Stephen Lewis to join McMaster faculty: Named University's first Social Sciences Scholar-in-Residence | newspaper = McMaster Daily News | location = [[Hamilton, Ontario|Hamilton]], Canada | publisher = [[McMaster University]] | date = 2006-05-04 | url = http://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/story.cfm?id=3989 | accessdate = 2014-04-03 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110727094725/http://dailynews.mcmaster.ca/story.cfm?id=3989 | archive-date = 2011-07-27 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2006, he was elected a Senior Fellow of [[Massey College]] in the University of Toronto. In 2009, Lewis strongly criticized [[Pope Benedict XVI]]'s assertion that condom use only makes the AIDS crisis worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Ward | first =  Olivia | title = Pope's condom remarks 'real tragedy' | newspaper = [[The Toronto Star]] | pages =  A8 | date = 2009-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stephen Lewis Foundation==
Lewis is chair of the board of the Stephen Lewis Foundation, a non-profit organization that helps people affected and infected by [[HIV/AIDS]] in Africa.&lt;ref name="Stephen Lewis Foundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://stephenlewisfoundation.org/who-we-are/about-stephen-lewis |publisher=Stephen Lewis Foundation |title=About Stephen Lewis |accessdate=2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, to raise money for the foundation, Lewis helped with a campaign to dare Canadians to do something for Africa called A Dare to Remember.&lt;ref name="dare"&gt;{{Cite news | last = Wiebe | first = Lindsey | title = Raise money for AIDS by going out on a limb | newspaper = [[Winnipeg Free Press]] | location = Winnipeg | page = C7 | publisher =  FP Canadian Newspapers Limited Partnership | date = 2009-09-01 | url = http://www.winnipegfreepress.com/entertainment/raise-money-for-aids-by-going-out-on-a-limb-56534832.html | accessdate = 2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign saw Lewis, along with musician [[k-os]], [[Federal NDP]] leader [[Jack Layton]], Olympic gold medalist [[Duff Gibson]] and many other [[Canadians]], performing various [[:wikt:dare|dares]] for the event.&lt;ref name="dare"/&gt;  He faced his own personal fears as part of the campaign, and sang live on [[The Hour (Canadian TV series)|CBC's The Hour]] with the band the Arkells.

==AIDS-Free World==
In 2007, Stephen Lewis and long-time colleague [[Paula Donovan]] co-founded ''AIDS-Free World'', a non-profit organization that advocates for more effective global responses to HIV and AIDS.&lt;ref name="AIDS-Free World"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aidsfreeworld.org/About-Us.aspx AIDS-Free World |title=About Us |publisher=AIDS-Free World |accessdate=2014-04-03 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140306150002/http://www.aidsfreeworld.org/About-Us.aspx |archivedate=2014-03-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a [[AIDS#Prevention|preventative HIV/AIDS strategy]], Lewis has made a somewhat controversial call for [[male circumcision]] when African boys receive the first of two UN-administered [[Measles|measles vaccination]] shots, so that their recovery progress can be monitored at the time of the second vaccination.&lt;ref name="circumcision"&gt;{{Cite web | last = Lewis | first = Stephen | title = Male Circumcision Part 1 | work = AIDS Free World | publisher = [[YouTube]] | date = 2010-01-06  | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n9kIqB_6KRg | format = online video | accessdate = 2014-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many studies have been conducted into [[Circumcision and HIV|the role circumcision can play]] in reducing the spread of HIV.

==Personal==
Stephen Lewis is the son of former federal NDP leader [[David Lewis (politician)|David Lewis]] and the grandson of [[Moishe Lewis]] (1888-1950), an activist in the [[General Jewish Labour Bund in Lithuania, Poland and Russia|Jewish Bund]] in Russia and the [[Jewish Labour Committee]] in Montreal.

Lewis has three siblings. Two of them were active and high-ranking officials within the Ontario NDP during the 1980s and 1990s: Michael Lewis was the secretary, and Janet Solberg was the president. His second sister is Nina Lewis-Libeskind, the wife and partner of world-renowned architect [[Daniel Libeskind]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Birnbaum | first = Elisa | title = Stephen Lewis: The Voice of a Continent | work = Lifestyles Magazine | issue = 217 | date = Fall 2008 | url = http://www.lifestylesmagazine.com/website/archive/C217.html | accessdate = 2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewis is married to journalist [[Michele Landsberg]]. Their son is broadcaster [[Avi Lewis]], who married journalist and author [[Naomi Klein]]. Their daughters are Ilana Naomi Landsberg-Lewis and Jenny Leah Lewis; Ilana serves as executive director of the [[Stephen Lewis Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://216.129.193.100/daily/lifestyle/story.cfm?content=170376 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121128211004/http://216.129.193.100/daily/lifestyle/story.cfm?content=170376 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=November 28, 2012 |title=Michele Landsberg celebrates 70 years |newspaper=[[Now (newspaper)|Now]] |date=July 15, 2009 |accessdate=2014-04-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honours==
For his humanitarian work in Africa and the United Nations, the Governor General of Canada appointed Lewis a Companion of the [[Order of Canada]] on October 10, 2002.&lt;ref name= "OC"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Stephen Lewis | work = Honours, Order of Canada
  | publisher = Governor General of Canada | date = 2009-04-30 | url = http://archive.gg.ca/honours/search-recherche/honours-desc.asp?lang=e&amp;TypeID=orc&amp;id=4206 | accessdate = 2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; His investiture into the order was held on October 23, 2003.&lt;ref name= "OC"/&gt;  He delivered the annual [[Massey Lecture]] in 2005, and it was published in book form under the title  ''[[Race Against Time: Searching for Hope in AIDS-Ravaged Africa]]''. The book consists of five lectures that depict the HIV/AIDS pandemic in Africa, critically examining the international community's passivity as a contributing factor.

In 2006, two new secondary schools in the Toronto area were named after Lewis: one in Mississauga, Ontario, [[Stephen Lewis Secondary School (Mississauga)|Stephen Lewis Secondary School]] and one in [[Stephen Lewis Secondary School (Vaughan)|York Region]]. The Mississauga school has a special focus on educating students on issues relating to social justice and global citizenship to enhance the Ontario Curriculum.

In 2007, Lewis received the [[World Citizenship Award]], from the [[World Association of Girl Guides and Girl Scouts]], as well as the Health and Human Rights Leadership Award from [http://www.doctorsoftheworld.org/ Doctors of the World-USA].   Lewis was also invested as a Knight Commander of the [[Order of Moshoeshoe|Most Dignified Order of Moshoeshoe]] by King [[Letsie III of Lesotho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Nolen | first =  Stephanie | title = Stephen Lewis Given Lesotho's Highest Honour | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] | pages =  | date = 2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Nolen | first = Stephenie | title = 'Trusty and well-beloved' Lewis surprised with Lesotho's highest honour | newspaper = [[The Globe and Mail]] | location = Toronto | page = A13 | date = 2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, [[Forbes magazine]], in conjunction with their 2010 list of ''World's Most Powerful People'', asked the feminist playwright [[Eve Ensler]] to identify Worlds' Most Powerful Feminists. She named Stephen Lewis as one of her top seven.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://blogs.forbes.com/carolinehoward/2010/11/04/the-worlds-most-powerful-feminists-and-least-powerful-women/ | title=The world's most powerful feminists and least powerful women | work=Forbes | first=Caroline | last=Howard}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, The Mark S. Bonham Centre for Sexual Diversity Studies at the University of Toronto presented Stephen Lewis with the Bonham Centre Award, recognizing his contribution to the advancement and education of human rights issues surrounding sexual education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://media.utoronto.ca/media-releases/mark-s-bohnam-centre-for-sexual-diversity-studies-announces-2013-award-recipients-stephen-lewis-dan-savage-and-bent-on-change/ |title=Mark S.

'''Storakersvatnet''' is a [[lake]] in the municipality of [[Rana, Norway|Rana]] in [[Nordland]] county, [[Norway]].  The lake lies about {{convert|15|km}} south of the town of [[Mo i Rana]] and less than {{convert|900|m}} from the border with [[Sweden]].  The original lake was only {{convert|15.9|km2}}, but a [[dam]] was built at the northern end so that it can serve as a reservoir for the Rana power station.

'''''The Biggest Loser''''' was a British [[reality television]] show that began airing on [[Sky Living]] from 2005 to 2006, before moving to [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]] in 2009 and finished in 2012. Most recently hosted by [[Davina McCall]], the show is a spin-off of the American reality television show of the [[The Biggest Loser (U.S. TV series)|same name]].

The show originally featured [[Angie Dowds]] and Mark Bailey as the personal trainers, with Richard Callender replacing Bailey from [[The Biggest Loser UK (series 3)|series 3]]. After Dowds died in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.express.co.uk/posts/view/328113/328113 TV guru leapt to her death after split with girlfriend]&lt;/ref&gt; she was replaced by Charlotte Ord and [[Rob Edmond|Rob "The Killer" Edmond]] for the fifth series.&lt;ref&gt;Leon Watson (24 November 2011) [http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2065042/Angie-Dowds-Davina-McCall-pays-tribute-diet-guru-Biggest-Loser.html "'So, so sad': Davina McCall pays tribute to diet guru in ITV's Biggest Loser after she dies 'jumping from Beachy Head'"] ''Daily Mail''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first two series of the show were hosted by [[Vicki Butler-Henderson]] on [[Sky Living|Living TV]], the third series was hosted by [[Kate Garraway]] and [[Davina McCall]] began presenting the show in its fourth series on [[ITV (TV network)|ITV]].

In September 2012, it was announced that the show would be cancelled, with no further series planned.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mirror.co.uk/3am/celebrity-news/itv-axe-biggest-loser-after-1324639&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format==
The basic format of the show is that overweight contestants compete to win a cash prize by losing the highest percentage of their starting body weight.

In its first two series, it was an individual competition, even though the contestants train together in teams, and immunity from elimination is initially based on team competitions. The red team was trained by Angie Dowds, who used a hard no-nonsense approach. The blue team was trained by [[Mark Bailey (personal trainer)|Mark Bailey]], who trained with a more nurturing approach.

In the first two series, the winner received £25,000 in cash, the third series winnings was reduced to £10,000 but was reverted to the £25,000 cash prize as of the fourth series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s142/the-biggest-loser-uk/news/a295950/biggest-loser-uk-offers-gbp25k-prize.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The third series changed to the new 'couples' format, where 8 pairs of friends, relatives or colleagues started together for the first 5 weeks, before they got split up into a 'black team', trained by Angie Dowds, and a 'blue team', trained by Richard Callender,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s142/the-biggest-loser-uk/realitybites/a301639/richard-callender-chats-biggest-loser.html&lt;/ref&gt; and started competing against each other, similar to the first two series.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.digitalspy.co.uk/tv/s142/the-biggest-loser-uk/news/a295909/in-pictures-itv1s-biggest-loser-cast.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Marfan Foundation''' (formerly '''National Marfan Foundation''', '''NMF''') is a [[non-profit organization]] in the [[United States]] established to raise awareness and promote research on treatment of [[Marfan syndrome]] and related disorders. The Foundation provides information about Marfan syndrome and funds research for the purposes of saving lives and improving the quality of life for people affected by the condition which is a genetic [[connective tissue]] disorder. The Foundation also lobbies Congress to fund Marfan syndrome research and engages in its own fundraising activities.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.marfan.org/about-us/how-we-help| title =How We Help| publisher =The Marfan Foundation| accessdate =2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Foundation was established in 1981 by Priscilla Ciccariello, who lost a husband and son to the disorder, and Reed E. Pyeritz, MD, a geneticist at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.longisland.com/articles/05-20-11/celebrate-national-marfan-foundations-30th-anniversary-by-voting-in-chase-community-giving.html?print=1&amp;page=1 | title = Celebrate National Marfan Foundation's 30th Anniversary by Voting in Chase Community Giving | publisher =LongIsland.com| accessdate =2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to providing [[Grant (money)|grants]] for research on Marfan syndrome, the foundation raises awareness of the condition, which often goes undiagnosed, among health care providers and the public. The Foundation hosts an annual conference, has dozens of chapters and support groups across the U.S., and sponsors fundraising events. Carolyn Levering became the Marfan Foundation's first President &amp; CEO in 1994. She announced her retirement in early 2014. Before it began using the current name, the organization was known as the "National Marfan Foundation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.prweb.com/releases/TheMarfanFoundation/08052013/prweb10996983.htm | title = The Marfan Foundation Adopts New Brand to Better Reflect its Mission for Marfan Syndrome and Related Disorders | publisher = PRWeb | date = August 5, 2013 | accessdate =2014-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
The Marfan Foundation operates under the guidance of its Board of Directors, which consists of "a diverse group of business leaders and long-time Foundation members."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://www.marfan.org/about-us/team| title =Boards and Staff | publisher=The Marfan Foundation| accessdate =2014-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Foundation also has a Professional Advisory Board consisting of physicians and other health care professionals, and is currently chaired by Alan C. Braverman, MD, of [[Washington University School of Medicine]]. The Marfan Foundation has a separate Scientific Advisory Board, currently chaired by Craig T. Basson, MD, PhD of [[Novartis]] Institutes for Biomedical Research. The late geneticist [[Victor A. McKusick]] was also a member of the Foundation's Scientific Advisory Board.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1131">The '''Walker Law''' passed in 1920 was an early [[New York (state)|New York]] state law regulating [[boxing]].  The law reestablished legal boxing in the state following the three-year ban created by the repeal of the [[Frawley Law]].  The law instituted rules that better ensured the safety of combatants and reduced the roughness of the sport.  The law limited matches to fifteen rounds, required a physician in attendance, restricted certain aggressive acts such as head-butting, and created a regulatory commission, the [[New York State Athletic Commission]].

The first main event conducted under this new law was the [[Joe Welling]] vs. [[Johnny Dundee]] bout. [[Sammy Nable]] vs. Bobby Hanson possibly was the very first bout ever conducted under the law.
