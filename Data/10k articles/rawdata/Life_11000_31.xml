      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8201">The '''African Mine Workers' Strike''' was a labour dispute involving mine workers of [[Witwatersrand]] in [[South Africa]]. It started on 12 August, 1946 and lasted approximately a week. The strike was attacked by police and over the week, at least 1,248 workers were wounded and at least 9 killed.

==African Mine Workers' Union==
In 1941 a miners' conference was called by the [[Transvaal Provincial Committee]] of the [[African National Congress]]. The conference was supported by [[Paramount Chief]] of [[Natal Province|Zululand]] and trade unions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=E. |last=Roux |title=Time Longer than Rope |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |location=Madison |page=335 |isbn= |year=1964 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was here that the African Mine Workers' Union came into being and elected a committee under the presidency of [[J. B. Marks]], who also became President of the Transvaal African National Congress.

At first the union was not recognised by the Chamber of Mines, but after sustained pressure for better wages and conditions, the prime minister, Field Marshal [[Jan Smuts]], announced some piecemeal increases improvements in conditions while at the same time issuing War Measure No. 1425—banning gatherings of more than twenty people on mining property without permission.

Despite union officials being arrested in 1944 at a meeting in Witwatersrand and in Springs, a conference was held in May 1946 which decided to approach the government with demands for a ten shillings a day wage and other improvements—or to take strike action.

On August 12, 1946, more than 60,000 workers in Witwatersrand refused to continue working for the existing wages.  Within a week police were deployed and incorporated brutal tactics in an effort to break the strike.  Officially 9 died and more than 1,248 workers were injured, and many regarded the strike as a failure.  Although the initial demands were ignored and the workers returned to the mines after only a week, the strike was viewed as a crucial moment in South Africa's development.  Ultimately this initial protest later influenced political realignments, and has been associated with increased labour conscience and social change.  By addressing the conditions necessary to maintain cheap migrant labour, this movement provided insight into the manner in which Apartheid serves as a vehicle for perpetuating pre-capitalist modes of production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wolpe|first=Harold|title=Migrancy and Militance: The case of the National Union of mineworkers of South Africa.|journal=African Affairs|date=Jan 1989|volume=88}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Methods such as the 'compound system', which essentially restrained workers from having any contact with Union organizers, were direct results of the initial failed Union Strike of 1946.

In August 1946 an open air conference was held in Newtown Market Square as no hall where Africans could hold meetings was big enough to accommodate those present and the decision to strike was taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The African Miners' Strike of 1946 |first=M.

==Bloody Tuesday==

The police attacked the workers with batons, bayonets, and gunfire outside the mines and in the mines when forced to work.

[[Police brutality]] reached a bloody climax on a peaceful march from the East Rand to Johannesburg on Tuesday, 13 August. Police opened fire on the procession and a number of workers were killed.

This led to the Transvaal [[Council of Non-European Trade Unions]] (CONETU) calling a general strike in Johannesburg on Wednesday, 14 August. CONETU called a meeting at Newtown Market Square the next day which was banned by the Riotous Assemblies Act. This meeting was also attacked by police with guns and bayonets.

During the week workers and leaders of the ANC, the Communist Party, the Indian and Coloured Congresses and the trade unions were arrested, tried, imprisoned, and deported.

The 1946 African miners strike signified a shift in public conscience, and was widely considered the beginning of what would later become the anti-apartheid movement.  This strike, " was led by the African Mine Workers Union, whose president, J.B. Marks, was also a leader in the South African Communist Party." (Workers World newspaper, Aug. 29, 1996.  Monica Moorehead).  Most workers averaged two shillings per shift, and were responsible for contributing a portion of their wages towards work clothes and bedding.  Many were removed from their families, sometimes for years, while their children and spouses starved.  The AMWU initially placed demands to create a legal minimum wage, cost-of-living allowance, and regular wage increases.  The miners settled on a 10 shilling per day minimum wage, and improved working conditions as the basis of their demands.  The Transvaal Chamber of Mines functioned as a closely knit cartel comprising five separate mining groups that essentially controlled the largest labour force in South Africa.  Their influence over state revenue, and political seats in the government allowed them to function with relative impunity.  With a general monopoly over South Africa's agricultural and industrial products, the Transvaal Chamber of Mines was in effect capable of controlling workers wages and suppressing efforts to unionize.  This was largely achieved by keeping workers in policed compounds and brutally restricting their ability to communicate or be contacted by union organizers.
In the wake of discontent following settlements that maintained the existing labour cost, Prime Minister Smuts issued War Measure NO. 1425 this measure which, " prohibiting gatherings of more than twenty persons on mining property without special permission," effectively ceased further organized trade union meetings. (African National Congress, Sept. 12,1976, Monty Naicker).  Following the suppression of the 1946 strike, union groups like The Communist Party of South Africa experienced brutal treatment at the hands of the existing government.  Many of the parties leaders were indicted on charges of sedition and treason. "This was followed by a systematic series of measures to destroy the CPSA, culminating in the suppression of Communism Act in 1950." (Communist University, COSATU, 1946 mineworkers strike, press release, Aug. 11, 2006).  However, despite continual efforts through the media to define the strike as a failure this initial protest has had a lasting impact on South African politics.  The formation and emergence of the National Union of Mineworkers (NUM) represents a direct lineage to these early union organizers.  This organization, " arguably the heirs to the 1946 strike are currently engaged in a series of territorial disputes with the breakaway Association of Mineworkers and Construction Union (AMCU)." (Global Research, Aug. 21, 2012. Chris Webb).
Cheap Labour has historically provided the back-bone for South Africa's thriving mining industry.  Much of this work-force has routinely been composed of poor workers abducted from surrounding regions. " Research shows that by 1929, more than 115,000 Mozambicans had been forcibly recruited to work in South African mines." (The Southern Times, Felix Njini, Sept. 17, 2012).  The increased foreign demand for platinum has only served to perpetuate this system of abuse and oppression.  While the number of workers extracted from the surrounding areas has declined, local peasants are still routinely pressured into labour once they reach the working age.  While many of the injustices  imposed by South Africa's mining industry persist, the 1946 miners strike remains a prevalent reminder of the plight of  African workers and their families.

'''Abba of Carthage''' was a [[Judaism|Jewish]] [[Amoraim|amora]] (scholar), who flourished at the end of the third century CE. His birthplace was [[Carthage]], and it is incorrect to refer his surname to Cartagena in Spain or to a town of Armenia. He is frequently mentioned in the Jerusalem [[Talmud]] and in the haggadic traditions.

'''Attila Petschauer''' (December 14, 1904 – January 30, 1943) was a Hungarian [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] champion [[fencing|fencer]] of [[Jewish]] heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t0KzECrIQDQC&amp;pg=PA32&amp;dq=%22Jews+and+the+Olympic+Games%22+petschauer&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=NyugTqauLOrh0QGPmZn7BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Jews%20and%20the%20Olympic%20Games%22%20petschauer&amp;f=false |title=Jews and the Olympic Games: The Clash Between Sport and Politics - With a ... |author=Paul Taylor |publisher= |date= |accessdate=January 23, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Olympic career===
In [[1928 Summer Olympics|Amsterdam in 1928]] at the age of 23 he was part of the [[gold medal]]-winning Hungarian team in [[sabre]], winning all 20 of his competition matches. In the individual sabre competition, Petschauer won the [[silver medal]].&lt;ref name="Jews In Sports"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jewsinsports.org/olympics.asp?ID=75|title=Petschauer, Attila|publisher=Jews In Sports|accessdate=11 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;

In the [[1932 Summer Olympics]] in Los Angeles, Petschauer was again part of the champion Hungarian sabre team.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt;  The Hungarians won the gold medal in team sabre, and Petschauer finished 5th in individual sabre.&lt;ref name="Jews In Sports"/&gt;

==Murder==
According to legend, Petschauer was [[Roundup (history)|arrested by the Nazis]] in 1943 and sent to a [[Arbeitslager|forced labor camp]] in [[Davidovka concentration camp|Davidovka]], Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Y1kaDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT243&amp;dq=Attila+Petschauer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikupKQk6rbAhUF7YMKHQtPDKEQ6AEIMTAC#v=onepage&amp;q=Attila%20Petschauer&amp;f=false ''Not Just a Game'' - Doug Zipes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ewqzCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=Attila+Petschauer&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikupKQk6rbAhUF7YMKHQtPDKEQ6AEIUTAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Attila%20Petschauer&amp;f=false ''In the Darkroom'' - Susan Faludi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WWII"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/friv/lists.cgi?id=65 |title=Olympians Who Were Killed or Missing in Action or Died as a Result of War |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=Sports Reference}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some claime that Petschauer was tortured and murdered under orders of a Hungarian officer, a fellow former Hungarian Olympian named Kalman Czéh, during his service in a Hungarian-Jewish Forced Labor Battalion.&lt;ref name="Auto4U-6"/&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;  A fellow inmate, Olympic champion wrestler [[Károly Kárpáti]], recalled: “The guards shouted: ‘You, Olympic fencing medal winner . . . let’s see how you can climb trees.’ It was midwinter and bitter cold, but they ordered him to undress, then climb a tree. The amused guards ordered him to crow like a rooster, and sprayed him with water.

'''Bird–skyscraper collisions''' are a problem in [[urban areas]].  Several major cities like [[Toronto]] in Canada and [[New York City]] in the United States have programs to abate this, such as Toronto's [[Fatal Light Awareness Program]] (FLAP) and New York City's [[Lights Out New York]], a program of [[New York City Audubon]] an environmental organization.  According to FLAP, between one and nine million birds die each year in the city from hitting skyscrapers due to mistaking reflective windows for open sky, or being drawn to lights at night.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2006-07-06/news_onthestreet.php] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323085010/http://www.nowtoronto.com/issues/2006-07-06/news_onthestreet.php |date=March 23, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2014 article in the ornithological journal [[The Condor (journal)|Condor]], an estimated 365 million to 988 million birds die each year by colliding into buildings in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Logan |first=Tim |url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/business/2018/03/14/city-adds-glass-towers-birds-finding-lethal-obstacles-flight/nKRNv6RPCJbz87koMYkaEP/story.html |title=As Boston adds glass towers, birds find more lethal obstacles |work=[[The Boston Globe]] |date=2018-03-15 |accessdate=2018-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Legislation ==
Governments of Canada and the United States have recently introduced legislation to make new and existing buildings bird friendly. Examples include Toronto's Bird-Friendly Development Guidelines&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.toronto.ca/lightsout/pdf/development_guidelines.pdf |format=PDF |title=Environment |publisher=Toronto.ca |accessdate=2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; that requires new buildings to be bird friendly, Chicago's Design Guide For Bird-Safe Buildings New Construction And Renovation,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.birdsandbuildings.org/docs/ChicagoBirdSafeDesignGuide.pdf]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927184229/http://www.birdsandbuildings.org/docs/ChicagoBirdSafeDesignGuide.pdf |date=September 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; New York's Bird Friendly-Buildings Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://m.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/S4204-2011 |title=S4204-2011 - NY Senate Open Legislation - Enacts the "bird-friendly buildings act" to require use of bird-friendly building materials and design features in buildings - New York State Senate |publisher=M.nysenate.gov |date= |accessdate=2015-10-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616160647/http://m.nysenate.gov/legislation/bill/S4204-2011 |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; that will require new and existing building be bird friendly effective Jan 1, 2012. On the Federal level the Federal Bird-Safe Buildings Act of 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h112-1643 |title=Text of H.R. 1643 (112th): Federal Bird-Safe Buildings Act of 2011 (Introduced version) |publisher=GovTrack.us |date=2011-04-15 |accessdate=2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; calls for each public building constructed, acquired, or altered by the General Services Administration (GSA) to incorporate bird-safe building materials and design features. The legislation would require GSA to take similar actions on existing buildings, where practicable.

== Solutions ==
Recent developments in legislation necessitate architects and property managers to take mitigating measures to combat the bird collision issue. There are a variety of different solutions including special window film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.featherfriendly.org/ |title=Feather Friendly Bird Deterrent Window Films &amp;#124; Protecting Our Feathered Friends |publisher=Featherfriendly.org |date= |accessdate=2015-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rs|date=October 2015}} specialized glass, decals, screens and external shutters. Some of these solutions have been proven to significantly reduce bird collisions with buildings, but some are unproven and testing is required to prove the claims made for some.

"'''Brian: Portrait of a Dog'''" is the seventh episode and the [[season finale]] of the [[Family Guy (season 1)|first season]] of the [[animated cartoon|animated]] [[television comedy|comedy series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. It originally aired on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] in the United States on May 16, 1999. The episode features [[anthropomorphism|anthropomorphic]] dog [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] after he swallows his pride, and joins a dog show, after much convincing, in order to win money for a new air conditioner. But after an argument over a trick gone bad, with his owner, [[Peter Griffin]], Brian realizes he is a [[second-class citizen]] and runs away from home, landing him in the pound on death row. Desperate to save their dog, the [[Griffin family]] attempts to release Brian, and prevent him from being [[euthanized]].&lt;ref name="Episode"&gt;{{cite video|date=2003|title=Plot synopsis information for the episode "Brian: Portrait of a Dog"| medium=DVD|publisher=20th Century Fox}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The episode was written by [[Gary Janetti]] and directed by [[Michael Dante DiMartino]]. It received praise from television critic Ahsan Haque for its storyline and use of cultural references. The episode featured guest performances by [[Butch Hartman]], [[Rachael MacFarlane]], [[Dick Van Patten]], [[Mary Scheer]], [[Joey Slotnick]] and [[Wally Wingert]], along with several recurring voice actors for the series.

==Plot==
Quahog is in the grip of an unusual [[heat wave]] and, not having air conditioning, the [[Griffin family|Griffins]] are suffering. [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] learns of an upcoming dog show offering a top prize of $500, which he sees as the perfect way to be able to buy an [[air conditioner]]. He persuades a reluctant [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] to participate.  Brian performs his tricks at the [[Conformation show|dog show]]. Peter puts a bone biscuit on Brian's nose; finding this demeaning and becoming [[angry]], Brian refuses to "perpetuate the [[stereotype]] of the 'good dog'", as well as Peter saying he is embarrassed that Brian would not comply. Brian subsequently exits in a huff.

On the way home, Peter and Brian argue until Brian gets out of the car. A [[police officer]] gives Brian a ticket, for which Peter has to pay $10, for violating the local leash law, which only widens the rift between Peter and Brian. Another argument ensues and Peter mentions that he found Brian on the road as a stray dog. Angry that Peter brought that up and becoming more angry when Peter then demands that Brian stop being a bad dog, Brian leaves the house, whereupon he is treated cruelly by the community, and is (ultimately) forced to sleep at the bus shelter. Peter buys a new cat which turns out to be troublesome and abusive; the family gets rid of it and searches for Brian. By the time Peter decides to apologize to Brian, Brian has been kicked out of a restaurant and a public store and chased by the police when he was found drinking from a water fountain. Brian becomes homeless, having actually attacked a man on the street for treating him as a drunken [[hobo]] and for not believing that he was not a good dog but a crazy animal. He is subsequently taken away by the police.

A social worker announces to Brian and the rest of his family that Brian is sentenced to be put down by a [[lethal injection]], which shocks everyone. While Peter works on Brian's [[appeal]], Brian decides to study the Law as much as he can, and goes to court to defend himself, and finally gets the chance to plead his case before the Quahog City Council. During his parole hearing, he references the court case ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', but unfortunately for him, the council believes that it's stupid to listen to a dog. Just when Brian is about to be dismissed, Peter steps in and delivers a last-ditch emotional appeal on his behalf. The city council members remain unmoved until Peter bribes them with $20 each, and Brian is immediately freed. The charges against him are finally dropped and the town shows him new respect, allowing him to finally drink out of a water fountain, showing his status to be the same as that of the other citizens of the community. The family returns home and Stewie, in an unusual (at the time) display of respect towards Brian, bows ever so slightly towards him. Brian and Peter are then left alone. Brian licks Peter's face in an endearing dog gesture, and threatens to kill him if he ''ever'' tells anyone about it.&lt;ref name="Episode"/&gt;&lt;ref name="book"&gt;{{cite book|last=Callaghan |first=Steve|title=''Family Guy: The Official Episode Guide Seasons 1–3'' |year=2005 |publisher=Harper Collins Publishers|isbn=0-7528-7399-7|pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
The episode makes references to the U.S. [[Civil Rights Movement]]. While arguing his case before the city council, Brian tries to reference the landmark [[United States Supreme Court|U.S. Supreme Court]] case ''[[Plessy v. Ferguson]]'', before being cut off. Another reference comes after Brian is freed, he drinks from a drinking fountain in a defiant manner, a reference to the 1974 television movie, ''[[The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman]]''.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; Other media references include the Griffins watching the TV show ''[[Eight is Enough]]'' and Peter writing a letter to [[Angus MacGyver]], from the show ''[[MacGyver (1985 TV series)|MacGyver]]'', asking him to rescue Brian from jail.&lt;ref name="IGN"/&gt; When Brian puts eye drops into his eyes before the dog show, he says "Showtime" with [[jazz hands]]. This ritual and phrase are a reference to Joe Gideon in ''[[All That Jazz (film)|All That Jazz]]''

==Reception==
Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] rated the episode a 9.6/10, praising the random jokes and calling it "yet another finely crafted early episode that tells a great cohesive story, has some great random jokes, and throws in a bucket of social satire for good measure. This was also the final episode of the extremely short but groundbreaking first season, and definitely ranks amongst the best in the series."&lt;ref name="IGN"&gt;{{cite web|author=Haque, Ashan (2008)|url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/885/885471p1.html|title=Family Guy Flashback: "Brian: Portrait of a Dog" Review|accessdate=2009-09-14|publisher=IGN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Portrait of a Dog", along with the twenty-seven other episodes from ''Family Guy''{{'}}s first and second season, were released on a 4-disc [[DVD]] set in the U.S. on April 15, 2003.

'''Charles Delauney Bravo''' (30 November 1845 – 21 April 1876) was a [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] lawyer who was fatally [[poison]]ed with [[antimony]] in 1876. The case is still sensational, notorious and unresolved.  The case is also known as '''The Charles Bravo Murder''' and the '''Murder at the Priory'''.

It was an unsolved crime committed within an elite Victorian household at The Priory, a landmark house in [[Balham, London]]. Leading doctors attended the bedside, including the royal physician [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article492828.ece | location=London | work=The Times | first=Adam | last=Sherwin | title=Was it the wife the lover the stableman or the maid who poisoned Charles Bravo | date=11 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; and all agreed that it was a case of [[antimony]] poisoning. The victim took three days to die, but gave no indication of the source of the poison during that time. No one was ever charged with the crime.

==Background==
Charles Bravo was born Charles Delauney Turner in [[St Pancras, London]], and baptised in [[Saint Helier]], [[Jersey]], in 1852. He was the son of Augustus Charles Turner and Mary Turner, but later took the surname Bravo from his stepfather, Joseph Bravo. He attended [[Trinity College, Oxford]] and became a barrister. He by the time of his marriage to Florence Ricardo (née Campbell) he had fathered an illegitimate child.

His wealthy wife Florence (1845-1878) had previously been married, in 1864, to Alexander Louis Ricardo, son of [[John Ricardo]] MP, but had been separated from him because of his affairs and violent [[alcoholism]]. She herself had had an extramarital affair with the much older Dr [[James Manby Gully]], a fashionable society doctor who was also married at the time, and she had fallen out of favour with her family and society. Ricardo died in 1871 and Florence married Charles, a respected up-and-coming barrister, on 7 December 1875, terminating her affair with Gully.

Police inquiries in the case revealed that Charles's behaviour towards Florence was controlling, mean, violent and bullying. Florence was wealthier than Charles, and had opted from the start to hold onto her own money, an option only recently provided by the [[Married Women's Property Act 1870]]. This led to tensions within the marriage.

==The poisoning and the mystery==
The poisoning of Charles Bravo occurred four months into the marriage. Bravo's death was drawn out, lasting from two to three days, and painful. It was particularly notable that he did not offer any explanation of his condition to the attending doctors.

One hypothesis is that Charles Bravo was slowly poisoning his wife with small cumulative doses of antimony in the form of [[antimony potassium tartrate|tartar emetic]], which explains the chronic illness that she suffered from since shortly after their marriage. While treating himself with [[laudanum]] for toothache before going to bed he mistakenly swallowed some; then took the tartar emetic, mistakenly believing it was a true [[Vomiting#Emetics|emetic]] that would induce vomiting.&lt;ref&gt;Bridges (1956)&lt;/ref&gt; Their housekeeper Mrs. Cox reportedly told police that when they were alone together, Charles had admitted using the tartar emetic on himself; but she later changed her statement, perhaps to deflect suspicion from herself to Florence.

Other investigators have offered different suggestions as to what happened to cause the poisoning, including suicide, murder by the housekeeper Mrs. Cox (whom Bravo had threatened to sack), murder by Florence, and murder by a disaffected groomsman whom Bravo had discharged from employment at The Priory.

==Aftermath==
Two inquests were held, and the details were considered to be so scandalous that women and children were banned from the room while Florence Bravo testified. The searching cross-examination launched the career of the lawyer [[George Henry Lewis]]. The first inquest returned an [[open verdict]]. The second inquest returned a verdict of willful murder, but no one was ever arrested or charged.&lt;ref&gt;''The Murder Almanac'' {{ISBN|978-1-897784-04-4}} p. 29&lt;/ref&gt;

The household broke up after the inquest ended and the twice-widowed Florence moved away to [[Southsea]], [[Hampshire]]. She died at 33 of alcohol poisoning two years later on Tuesday 24 (possibly 17) September 1878.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Death of Mrs Brave|work=The Cornishman|issue=11|date=26 September 1878|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==

The novel ''[[So Evil My Love]]'' by Joseph Shearing (pseudonym of [[Marjorie Bowen]]) has elements of the Bravo poisoning in its plot. It was later made into a film.

The novel ''[[Below Suspicion]]'' by [[John Dickson Carr]] also has elements of the Bravo case in the first murder.

[[Agatha Christie]]'s ''[[Ordeal by Innocence]]'' refers to the Bravo case as a case unsolved, the permanent shade of suspicion thus destroying the lives of the innocent (Florence Bravo, Dr. Gully and Mrs. Cox, or at least two of them).

The graphic novel ''[[From Hell]]'' by [[Alan Moore]] and [[Eddie Campbell]] briefly features both Charles and Florence Bravo in Chapter 2. One of the protagonists is the royal physician [[Sir William Gull, 1st Baronet|Sir William Gull]], who is shown attending Charles Bravo on his deathbed.

[[Shirley Jackson]]'s novel ''[[We Have Always Lived in the Castle]]'' was inspired by the Charles Bravo mystery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Franklin |first1=Ruth |title=A Rather Haunted Life |date=2016 |publisher=Liverlight |isbn=1631493418 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case features in the first episode of [[Edward Woodward]]'s TV series ''[[In Suspicious Circumstances]]''.

'''Charles O. Howard''' (January 31, 1961 &amp;ndash; July 7, 1984) was an American murder victim in [[Bangor, Maine]] in 1984. As Howard and a male companion, Roy Ogden, were walking down the street, three teenagers, Shawn I. Mabry, age 16, James Francis Baines, age 15,  and Daniel Ness, age 17, harassed and assaulted Howard for being [[gay]]. The youths chased the pair, yelling [[homophobia|homophobic]] [[epithet]]s, until they caught Howard and threw him over the State Street Bridge into the [[Kenduskeag Stream]], despite his pleas that he could not swim. He drowned, but his friend escaped and pulled a [[fire alarm]]. Charlie Howard's body was found by rescue workers several hours later.

This event galvanized the Bangor community in ways similar to the killing of [[Matthew Shepard]], although the case never attained the same level of national notoriety. As an adult Jim Baines later spoke to various groups in Maine about his involvement in the murder and the damage that intolerance can do to people and their community. His story, ''Penitence: A True Story'' by Edward Armstrong, was published, although he received no royalties from the book. The Maine Lesbian/Gay Political Alliance, which later became [[EqualityMaine]], was formed in part as a reaction to Howard's death.&lt;ref name="Love2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Love|first=Barbara J.|title=Feminists who changed America, 1963-1975|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;pg=PA109|accessdate=10 April 2011|year=2006|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-03189-2|page=109}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bangor [[City Council]] and members of the [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[Bisexuality|bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) community have erected a monument along the Kenduskeag Stream honoring the memory of Charlie Howard as the victim of a [[hate crime]]. On July 7, 2004, a twentieth anniversary walk was held in memory of Howard. The Maine Speakout Project maintains the Charlie Howard Memorial Library in Portland, Maine. The library is open to the public.

Charlie Howard was from Portsmouth, New Hampshire.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/katsuyo_chan04/roseforcharlie.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:14:00 WebCite query result&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A young, fair-haired man, Charlie was small boned and suffered from asthma.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt; He was often made fun of as a small child, and was bullied in high school due to his sexual orientation. He did not attend his graduation to spare his family from the taunts he often received. With his poor grades, he knew college was not for him.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;

==Move to Maine==
Charlie left [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire]] and eventually landed in [[Ellsworth, Maine]].&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt; When the relationship that he was in ended in January 1984, Charlie left Ellsworth for Bangor, Maine.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;

In Bangor, Paul Noddin and Scott Hamilton befriended Charlie. Charlie was homeless with no prospects and Scott and Paul welcomed Charlie into their home. After a month, Charlie's opportunities were nil and Scott and Paul convinced him to return home to Portsmouth to live with his mother and stepfather.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;

==Charlie's fateful return==
Charlie was not home a week when he knew he could not stay. He had a brief relationship that ended quickly. When he called his two friends in Bangor, they realized Charlie was hurting and invited him to come back to Bangor.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;

Charlie returned - in high spirits and determined. He joined the local supportive Unitarian Church on Union Street as well as the Bangor support group Interweave. Here he made new friends and was accepted for who he was. In thanks for their support, Charlie prepared an Easter dinner for Paul and Scott and decorated their home. Eventually Charlie took an apartment on First Street, near his church, and adopted a kitten.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;

==Homophobic experiences==
Charlie lived at a time when most homosexuals were still closeted, but Charlie was "out" and even flamboyant. If he felt like "sissying up" e.g. wearing make up, jewelry and feminine accessories, he did so. He was known for singing the song "[[I Am What I Am (Broadway musical song)|I Am What I Am]]" from the musical ''[[La Cage aux Folles (play)|La Cage aux Folles]]''.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;

In 1984, many were not tolerant of homosexuals and victims of gay bashing often did not report incidents.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt; Charlie was often tormented by local high school boys and was asked to leave a local night club when he danced with a man.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt; Charlie was accosted by a woman in a local market one day, who shouted epithets at him such as "''You pervert''" and "''You queer''!" Frightened, Charlie quickly left, but as he was leaving, he stopped, turned around, and blew a kiss.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt; After this, Charlie was more wary of strangers. Leaving his apartment one day, he found his pet kitten dead on the doorstep. It had been strangled.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;

== July 7, 1984 ==
On Saturday, July 7, 1984, Charlie attended a potluck supper at Interweave. Leaving the party about 10&amp;nbsp;pm with his friend Roy Ogden, Charlie decided to walk to the post office to retrieve his mail. As Charlie and Roy walked up State Street and began to cross the Kenduskeag River Bridge, a car full of high school teenagers began to slow down.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;   
In the car were Shawn Mabry, Jim Baines, Daniel Ness and two girls. They had been at a party and had left to purchase alcohol with a fake ID that one of the girls had in her possession.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt; Seeing Charlie, the boys got out of the car and decided to give chase. The two girls remained in the car.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;

Charlie began to run when he recognized the vehicle from an earlier incident. Shouting epithets, the boys gave chase. Charlie fell and because of his asthma could not catch his breath. Roy ran further down State Street and stopped and observed.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;

Pouncing on Charlie, the boys began beating and kicking him. Jim Baines shouted to throw Charlie over the bridge and grabbed him by the legs. Jim Baines and Daniel Ness grabbed Charlie and they began lifting him.  Pleading for his life, Charlie grabbed the rail and begged them not to throw him in the river as he could not swim. Prying his hand loose, they began to pitch him over the rail, with Shawn Mabry  giving the final push. The boys then returned to the car, which the girls were trying to start. Spying Roy Ogden, they threatened him not to tell anyone. Roy Ogden then ran for help and pulled the first fire alarm he came to on State Street.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;

Soon, the sirens could be heard. An immediate search for Charlie began among the concrete walls that retain the Kenduskeag. At 1&amp;nbsp;am Charlie was found. An autopsy would show he had suffered from a severe asthma attack and drowned.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt;

Returning to the party, the boys bragged about their encounter. The next day one of the boys turned himself in after he learned that Charlie had died.  The other two boys decided to leave town on a freight train and then thought better of it. Returning home, they were arrested.

==The aftermath==
The boys were sent to the Hancock County Jail and later released into their parents' custody. The boys were tried as juveniles and sentenced to the Maine Youth Center not to exceed their 21st birthdays.&lt;ref name="geocities.com"/&gt; The boys were sentenced on 1 October 1984. According to the ''Bangor Daily News'', "Baines was released after serving two years and Mabry was released after 22 months."&lt;ref name="bangordailynews.com"&gt;[http://www.bangordailynews.com/detail/110585.html Where are Charlie Howard’s killers? — Bangor — Bangor Daily News — BDN Maine&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Twenty-five years later==
25 years later, ''The Bangor Daily News'' tried to locate Shawn Mabry, Jim Baines and Daniel Ness, now middle-aged men, for their views on the murder. They were unable to locate Mabry and Ness at that time, but found Jim Baines, who was living and working in Bangor. Following his release from the detention center, he spoke regularly about tolerance to local students and even addressed the Maine State Legislature in "support of a bill to ban discrimination based on sexual orientation".&lt;ref name="bangordailynews.com"/&gt; In addition, he co-authored the book ''Penitence'' with Ed Armstrong in 1994. Baines did not receive any of the profits of the book. That same year, Shawn Mabry expressed his regrets about his participation. He stated that he thinks about Charlie Howard every day.&lt;ref name="bangordailynews.com"/&gt;

Today, a short distance from Howard's murder site, a memorial has been erected; engraved on the stone are the words: “May we, the citizens of Bangor, continue to change the world around us until hatred becomes peacemaking and ignorance becomes understanding.”&lt;ref name="365gay.com"&gt;[http://www.365gay.com/news/community-rededicates-vandalized-gay-memorial-in-maine/ 365gay.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

July 7, Howard's death date, is now Diversity Day in Bangor.

===Memorial vandalized===
In May 2011, vandals spray-painted graffiti and an anti-gay slur on Charlie Howard's memorial. Family and friends cleaned it up and rededicated it.&lt;ref name="365gay.com"/&gt;

== Legacy in pop culture ==
This incident inspired a similar scene near the beginning of [[Stephen King]]'s novel ''[[It (novel)|It]]'', in which three homophobic teenagers throw an [[closeted|openly]] gay man, Adrian Mellon, over a bridge and into the Kenduskeag, where he was set upon and murdered by the monster [[Pennywise the Dancing Clown|Pennywise]].&lt;ref name="Sprinkle"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sprinkle |first=Stephen V. |title=Unfinished Lives |publisher=[[Resource Publications]] |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-4982-5786-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mark Doty]] wrote a poem about the tragedy called "Charlie Howard's Descent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Doty|first=Mark|title=Turtle, Swan|year=1987|publisher=David R. Godine|location=Boston|isbn=0-87923-698-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The murder is also the inspiration for a novel by [[Bette Greene]] titled ''The Drowning of Stephan Jones''.

==Fictional character biography==

===John Doe===
The criminal known as Copperhead first appeared in [[Gotham City]] in a [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]] costume. He committed numerous thefts before finally being apprehended by [[Batman]] and [[Barbara Gordon|Batgirl]]. Copperhead then turned to more deadly pursuits as a super-assassin, constricting victims to a suffocating death with his costume's tail. During this time, he would become [[Obsessive-compulsive disorder|obsessive]] about his target and think of nothing until the target was dead, which proved to be a weakness at times as he would ignore anything he did not consider immediately relevant. Copperhead used the travel opportunities his freelance career afforded him to pursue his [[hobby]] of collecting [[transistor radio]]s.

Although a master [[contortion]]ist, Copperhead was largely powerless without his snake-skin costume.

During the ''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' storyline, Copperhead sold his soul to the demon [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] in exchange for power, being transformed into a deadly human-snake hybrid.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Underworld Unleashed]]'' #1 (November 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Damage (DC comics)|Damage]]'' #18 (November 1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

He was later killed by [[Manhunter (Kate Spencer)|Manhunter, Kate Spencer]].&lt;ref name="dc-ency"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Manhunter'' #1 (October 2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ''[[Blackest Night]]'' storyline, Copperhead has been identified as one of the deceased entombed below the [[Hall of Justice (comics)|Hall of Justice]]. He is listed as "[[John Doe]]", as his real name had never been discovered.&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #1&lt;/ref&gt; He was reanimated as a member of the [[Black Lantern Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;''Blackest Night'' #3&lt;/ref&gt; Copperhead is destroyed by the combined efforts of seven Lanterns during the Black Lantern Corps' attack on Coast City.&lt;ref&gt;''Green Lantern'' (vol. 4) #50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nathan Prince===
''[[Teen Titans]]'' #56 featured a team of villains called the "[[Terror Titans]]", legacy villains whose mantles are inherited from older villains. One of the members shown is identified as Copperhead and appears visually as the character prior to the deal with Neron. The story did not reveal any information about the character or provide context with regard to previous stories.

In the subsequent ''Terror Titans'' miniseries, it is revealed that the second Copperhead's true identity is '''Nathan Prince''', and he is the only member of the Terror Titans who does not have a family connection to his predecessor. As a child, Nathan drowned his baby sibling out of jealousy, and even attempted to kill his parents. Unable to go through with it, he instead ran away to live on the streets, where he would solicit himself, having sex with older men, after which he would kill and rob them. It is still unknown how Prince came to work for [[Clock King]]. During [[The Dark Side Club]]'s metahuman battles, the heroine TNTeena is badly injured, and Clock King tasks Copperhead with watching over her as she recuperates. Copperhead complies, and over time, falls in love with her.&lt;ref&gt;''Terror Titans'' #4&lt;/ref&gt; However, Nathan is later forced by Clock King to kill her.&lt;ref&gt;''Terror Titans'' #5&lt;/ref&gt; Nate and the rest of the Terror Titans are then sent to assist the '''Martyr Militia''', a group of brainwashed metahumans, in destroying Los Angeles, but the tables are turned by [[Rose Wilson|Ravager]] and [[Miss Martian]], who uses her telepathy to undo the brainwashing. The Terror Titans flee to their base, only for Clock King to kill [[Disruptor (comics)|Disruptor]], and leave them to be apprehended by the metahumans. Two weeks later, Nate breaks his fellow Terror Titans out of custody, and the group swear revenge on Clock King.&lt;ref&gt;''Terror Titans'' #6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sameer Park===
Copperhead appears in [[the New 52]] (a 2011 reboot of the DC Comics universe). He is a criminal named '''Sameer Park'''{{citation needed|date=September 2017}}, and is a mutated anthropomorphic snake man as opposed to being a villain wearing a snake costume. Copperhead  as a member of the [[Secret Society of Super Villains]].&lt;ref&gt;''Justice League of America'' vol. 3 #4&lt;/ref&gt; He is killed by Deathstroke in ''[[Forever Evil]]'' #5. 

Another Copperhead resembling Sameer Park appears in [[DC Rebirth]], later as one of the many villains Batman and Catwoman take down when he takes her on a typical night of his job. He is later shown as one of the many villains in Batman's Rogues Gallery to be beaten down by Bane in his attempt to reach Batman in Arkham &lt;ref&gt;Batman (vol. 3) #19&lt;/ref&gt;. He later appears in the Batgirl and the Birds of Prey comics.

===Jane Doe===
A female Copperhead using the alias '''Jane Doe''' makes her debut sometime after the death of her predecessor. This version of the character resembles its appearance in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'', DC Chief Creative Officer Geoff Johns has said that this new incarnation and daughter of Copperhead would appear as a villain in the New 52 "after the game's release. Copperhead is described as a deadly hitwoman and one of the two most toxic individuals on the planet (the other being [[Cheshire (comics)|Cheshire]]).&lt;ref&gt;''All-Star Batman'' #2&lt;/ref&gt;.

Real name unknown, Copperhead is a crime boss in Central City, as well as a former mercenary. She is an antagonist of both Batman and the Flash.
Two-Face placed a large bounty on Batman's head that many super-villains and mercenaries intended to collect, including Copperhead. Alongside several other villains Copperhead tracked down the Bat to a active train. Climbing on board the train Copperhead attempted to kill Batman but he was able to escape by jumping into a flowing stream.
After a brief stint of assassinations and other mercenary jobs, Copperhead was called up to lead her families' crime business in Central City. After a mysterious rival boss started muscling in on her territory she decided to hire several mercenaries to enforce her rule, two of these mercenaries were Shrapnel and Black Spider. However Black Spider was arrested by the Flash for robbing a diamond exchange, and Shrapnel was arrested after murdering the Road Reapers. Soon after this another pair of mercenaries were apprehended by the Flash- Trigger Twins, this prompted Copperhead to open negotiations with the mysterious crimelord whom she discovered was Captain Cold of the Rogues, in order to find away to defeat the Flash. Copperhead followed Cold's plan to eliminate the Flash, but Cold turned on her when he planted a cold bomb in a weapons delivery. The Flash was able to save her after he apprehended Cold, but without any evidence of her involvement she was aloud to walk free. 

This version of the character is exclusive to the continuity of the DC Rebirth and is an adaptation of Copperhead. The original character was created by WB Games Montréal and first appeared in Batman: Arkham Origins.

===Nora Park===
the Figthing Copperhead is Sameer Park's niece, She appears later as one of the many villains Batman and Catwoman take down when he takes her on a typical night of his job. This version appears again to be inhuman, with copper skin but with some un-snake-like qualities, such as teeth.&lt;ref&gt;Batman (vol. 3) #14&lt;/ref&gt; She is later shown as one of the many villains in Batman's Rogues Gallery to be beaten down by Bane in his attempt to reach Batman in Arkham &lt;ref&gt;Batman (vol. 3) #19&lt;/ref&gt;. He later appears in the Batgirl and the Birds of Prey comics.

==Powers and abilities==
Copperhead's [[contortion]]ist skills allow him to fit himself into incredibly small spaces (such as [[chimney]]s). He originally wore a snake-themed costume. The suit was a weave of [[metal]]lic and [[Elastomer|elastic]] [[fiber]]s and covered vulnerable points (such as the [[chest]]) with [[Kevlar]], making it [[bulletproof]] and impenetrable to almost any cutting edged weapon. The costume had been treated with a highly slippery [[water]]- and [[heat]]-proof [[silicon]] [[gel]], allowing Copperhead to slide along any surface and slip out of tight spots. The tail could be stretched several feet and was strong enough to snap [[bone]] and shatter [[rock (geology)|stone]]. The suit's helmet contained two seven-inch-long fangs which were capable of piercing human skin, and were coated in a potent [[neurotoxin]] derived from [[Agkistrodon contortrix|copperhead]] snakes. The toxin could [[paralyze]] a person almost instantly, and [[death]] would follow within 30 minutes. Later, Copperhead sold his [[soul]] to the [[demon]] [[Neron (DC Comics)|Neron]] and was transformed into a human-snake hybrid. His reflexes and agility were greatly increased, and he gained [[venom (poison)|venomous]] [[tooth|fangs]], a forked tongue, claws, and a prehensile tail.

In "Terror Titans", [[Clock King]] mentions that the second Copperhead does not have any superpowers, meaning he utilizes a snake-themed suit, like the original once did.&lt;ref&gt;''Teen Titans'' #59&lt;/ref&gt;

The Copperhead from "The New 52" has snake-like abilities.

The female Copperhead does not appear to have any superpowers and instead uses different poison equipment such as darts.

[[Image:Copper3.jpg|right|170px|thumb|Copperhead as depicted in ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' and ''[[Justice League Unlimited]]'']]
* The John Doe version of Copperhead appears in the ''[[Justice League (TV series)|Justice League]]'' TV series voiced by Efrain Figueroa and later voiced by Jose Yenque. He is similar to the comic version with a poisonous bite and prehensile tail. Copperhead is generally portrayed as an acrobatic idiot, consistently outsmarting himself in almost every appearance. He is not cowardly, however, having once mocked Superman while the latter attempted to interrogate him. He has been seen as a member of both [[Lex Luthor]]'s and [[Aresia|Aresia's]] [[Injustice Gang]]. He also appears briefly in "Only a Dream" in which he fights with Hawkgirl after he, [[Firefly (DC Comics)|Firefly]], [[Volcana (DC Comics)|Volcana]], [[Luminus (comics)|Luminus]], and [[Solomon Grundy (comics)|Solomon Grundy]] escape from Stryker's Island.

She first appeared in "Lovecraft" (he is based in Jane Done version of Copperhead that appears in [[Batman: Arkham Origins]]), where she and two unnamed assassins are sent by an as-yet-unknown party to target Selina Kyle after killing Wayne Manor's groundskeeper. While one of the unnamed assassins was killed in a gunfight with [[Alfred Pennyworth]], Copperhead and the other assassin went after Selina Kyle and Bruce Wayne. In a discussion with [[James Gordon (comics)|James Gordon]], [[Two-Face|Harvey Dent]] suspects Dick Lovecraft hired the assassins. When at Dick Lovecraft's condo, Copperhead and the unnamed assassin attacked James Gordon and Dick Lovecraft. Copperhead managed to knock out James Gordon with her contortionist moves. By the time James Gordon regained conscious, he found that Copperhead and the other assassin had managed to kill Dick Lovecraft. Copperhead and the other assassin are tipped off of Selina Kyle's location by her fence Clyde. After the other assassin was knocked out by Selina Kyle, Copperhead held Bruce Wayne at gunpoint asking where Selina Kyle is. Upon Alfred's arrival, Copperhead gets away.

===Film===

He appears in the film as a member of [[Amanda Waller]]'s [[Suicide Squad|Task Force X program]]. While he plays a big role in the mission the Squad is sent for, he is the one who speaks less in the team and through most of his moments, he intimidates others by hissing and showing off his fangs and tongue. In the film's climax, Copperhead fights Killer Frost to stop her from escaping with the "Get Out of Hell Free" card until Amanda Waller detonates the bomb in him, killing him and Killer Frost.

===Video games===
* Copperhead appears in ''[[Batman: The Brave and the Bold – The Videogame]]'', voiced by [[Dee Bradley Baker]].
* The Jane Done version of Copperhead (character created in the game) appears in ''[[Batman: Arkham Origins]]'' voiced by [[Rosa Salazar]]. DC Chief Creative Officer [[Geoff Johns]] has said that this new incarnation and daughter of Copperhead would appear as a villain in the New 52 "after the game's release."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsarama.com/18399-sdcc-13-batman-arkham-origins-panel-live.html|title=SDCC '13: BATMAN: ARKHAM ORIGINS Panel Reveals COPPERHEAD, More.|last=Siegel|first=Lucas|publisher=Newsarama|date=July 18, 2013|accessdate=July 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;Copperhead is among the eight assassins that are hired by Black Mask to kill Batman. She is portrayed as a skilled contortionist and escape artist wearing metal, clawed gloves coated with a toxin that makes those she scratches experience intense hallucinations before dying. This version is also implied to be part of a group of South American assassins who all use the moniker "Copperhead", as Batman is surprised that this Copperhead is a woman as previous versions were supposed to be male. Copperhead first appears in the Sionis Steel Mill, killing some of the [[Joker (comics)|Joker]]'s men before attacking Batman as he interrogates [[Black Mask (comics)|Roman Sionis]] about Joker (who has been posing as Black Mask). Black Mask offers to pay Copperhead double Joker's rate for killing Batman, but Copperhead calls him a fallen king with no money stating that she knows about the Joker causing Black Mask to flee. Copperhead catches Batman by surprise and slips away after she slashes him with a hallucinogenic poison. While infected, Batman experiences visions of [[Alfred Pennyworth]] dismissing him as a failure, a female bank manager that Joker killed saying it was his fault for letting her die, and [[Gillian B. Loeb|Commissioner Gillian B. Loeb]] saying he wasn't a real hero for letting him die. Copperhead later attacks him head-on using the toxin to its full advantage as Batman is forced to fight dozens of Copperhead illusions along with the original, fighting more and more Copperheads as the poison weakens him. Eventually, Alfred delivers a cure into the Steel Mill, allowing Batman to easily defeat her and throw her into one of the shipping containers. She tries to bargain for freedom by revealing that a meeting between all the assassins enlisted by "Black Mask" had been called, but Batman leaves her in the shipping yard anyway tracing the meeting using the electromagnetic pulse from [[Electrocutioner]]'s gloves. Batman later tells Alfred to send an anonymous tip for [[James Gordon (comics)|Captain James Gordon]] about Copperhead's location. If the player listens in to corrupt cops, they say that Copperhead was put in a cell without bars to prevent her escape (most likely similar to the one [[Clayface]] would be put in years later). This female interpretation is notably barefoot, with claws from her toes. She has ritualistic tattoos known to be found on the skin of gang members in Spanish gangs across the country, she also wears leather skin tight pants which cover both her ankles and partially her feet. Fans have speculated this version of the character is the daughter of [[Bane (DC Comics)|Bane]] due to her Spanish accent and Bane not knowing who he is; however, none of this has been confirmed by DC.
* In ''[[Batman: Arkham Knight]]'', Copperhead's poison can be found in one of the tables of [[Ace Chemicals]].
* The John Doe version of Copperhead appears in ''[[Lego DC Super Villains]]''.

===Toys===
* Copperhead's first toy released was an action figure in the [[DC Superheroes: Justice League Unlimited (toy)|Justice League Unlimited toyline]] with Lex Luthor and Mirror Master. He reappeared as a single figure with a snake as an accessory.
* Copperhead appears in Wave 12 of the [[DC Universe Classics]] line of action figures.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19150">'''Cord blood''' ('''umbilical cord blood''') is [[blood]] that remains in the [[placenta]] and in the attached [[umbilical cord]] after [[childbirth]]. Cord blood is collected because it contains [[stem cells]], which can be used to treat [[hematopoietic]] and [[genetic disorder]]s.

== Medical uses ==
Cord blood is used the same way that [[hematopoietic stem cell transplantation]] is used to reconstitute bone marrow following radiation treatment for various blood cancers, and for various forms of [[anemia]].&lt;ref name=milestones2016/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ballen2013rev/&gt;  Its efficacy is similar as well.&lt;ref name=milestones2016/&gt;

== Adverse effects ==
Adverse effects are similar to hematopoietic stem cell transplantation, namely [[graft-versus-host disease]] if the cord blood is from a genetically different person, and the risk of severe infection while the immune system is reconstituted.&lt;ref name=milestones2016/&gt; To assure that the smallest amount of complications occur during transplantation, levels of engraftment must be present; specifically both neutrophils and platelets must be being produced &lt;ref&gt;Waller-Wise, R. (2011). Umbilical Cord Blood: Information for Childbirth Educators. The Journal of Perinatal Education, 20(1), 54–60. http://doi.org/10.1891/1058-1243.20.1.54
&lt;/ref&gt;. This process of neutrophil and platelet production after the transplant, however, takes much longer than that of stem cells &lt;ref&gt;Waller-Wise, R. (2011). Umbilical Cord Blood: Information for Childbirth Educators. The Journal of Perinatal Education, 20(1), 54–60. http://doi.org/10.1891/1058-1243.20.1.54
&lt;/ref&gt;. In many cases, the engraftment time depends on the cell dose, or the amount of stem cells obtained in the sample of blood &lt;ref&gt;Waller-Wise, R. (2011). Umbilical Cord Blood: Information for Childbirth Educators. The Journal of Perinatal Education, 20(1), 54–60. http://doi.org/10.1891/1058-1243.20.1.54
&lt;/ref&gt;. In Dr. Moise’s article about umbilical cord blood &lt;ref&gt;Moise K. J. (2005). Umbilical cord stem cells. Obstetrics and Gynecology, 106(6), 1393–1407 [PubMed]&lt;/ref&gt; (as cited in &lt;ref&gt;Waller-Wise, R. (2011). Umbilical Cord Blood: Information for Childbirth Educators. The Journal of Perinatal Education, 20(1), 54–60. http://doi.org/10.1891/1058-1243.20.1.54
&lt;/ref&gt;), it was found that there is approximately 10% less stem cells in cord blood than there is in bone marrow. Therefore a sufficient amount of cord blood must be obtained in order to collect an adequate cell dose, however this amount varies from infant to infant and is irreplaceable. Given that this idea is quite new, there is still a lot of research that needs to be completed. For example, it is still unknown how long cord blood can safely be frozen without losing its beneficial effects &lt;ref&gt;Waller-Wise, R. (2011). Umbilical Cord Blood: Information for Childbirth Educators. The Journal of Perinatal Education, 20(1), 54–60. http://doi.org/10.1891/1058-1243.20.1.54
&lt;/ref&gt;.


There is a lower incidence with cord blood compared with traditional HSCT, despite less stringent HLA match requirements.  &lt;ref name=milestones2016/&gt;

== Collection and storage ==
Umbilical cord blood is the blood left over in the placenta and in the umbilical cord after the birth of the baby. The cord blood is composed of all the elements found in whole blood. It contains red blood cells, white blood cells, plasma, platelets and is also rich in [[hematopoietic stem cells]].  There are several methods for collecting cord blood. The method most commonly used in clinical practice is the "closed technique", which is similar to standard blood collection techniques. With this method, the technician [[cannula]]tes the [[Umbilical vein|vein]] of the severed umbilical cord using a needle that is connected to a blood bag, and cord blood flows through the needle into the bag. On average, the closed technique enables collection of about 75 ml of cord blood.&lt;ref name="isbn012-348-776-5"&gt;
{{cite book |author= Christopher D. Hillyer |author2= Ronald G. Strauss |author3= Naomi L. C. Luban |last-author-amp= yes |title=Handbook of Pediatric Transfusion Medicine |publisher=Academic Press |location= |year=2004 |pages=295, 296 |isbn=978-0-12-348776-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Collected cord blood is [[Cryopreservation|cryopreserved]] and then stored in a [[cord blood bank]] for future transplantation. Cord blood collection is typically depleted of red blood cells before cryopreservation to ensure high rates of stem cell recovery.&lt;ref name="pmid26133757 "&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Roura|first1=S|last2=Pujal|first2=JM|last3=Gálvez-Montón|first3=C|last4=Bayes-Genis|first4=A|title=The role and potential of umbilical cord blood in an era of new therapies: a review|journal=Stem Cell Research &amp; Therapy|date=2 July 2015|volume=6|pages=123|pmid=26133757|pmc=4489204|doi=10.1186/s13287-015-0113-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The first successful cord blood transplant (CBT) was done in 1988 in a child with [[Fanconi anemia]].&lt;ref name=milestones2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Juric|first1=MK, et al.|title=Milestones of Hematopoietic Stem Cell Transplantation - From First Human Studies to Current Developments|journal=Frontiers in Immunology|date=9 November 2016|volume=7|pages=470|pmid=27881982|pmc=5101209|doi=10.3389/fimmu.2016.00470}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early efforts to use CBT in adults led to mortality rates of about 50%, due somewhat to the procedure being done in very sick people, but perhaps also due to slow development of immune cells from the transplant.&lt;ref name=milestones2016/&gt; By 2013, 30,000 CBT procedures had been performed and banks held about 600,000 units of cord blood.&lt;ref name=Ballen2013rev&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ballen|first1=KK|last2=Gluckman|first2=E|last3=Broxmeyer|first3=HE|title=Umbilical cord blood transplantation: the first 25 years and beyond|journal=Blood|date=25 July 2013|volume=122|issue=4|pages=491–8|pmid=23673863|pmc=3952633|doi=10.1182/blood-2013-02-453175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Society and culture ==

=== Regulation ===
The [[AABB]] has generated accreditation standards for cord blood banking facilities.&lt;ref name=Armitage2016&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Armitage|first1=S|title=Cord Blood Banking Standards: Autologous Versus Altruistic|journal=Frontiers in Medicine|date=8 January 2016|volume=2|pages=94|pmid=26779485|pmc=4705863|doi=10.3389/fmed.2015.00094}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] regulates any facility that stores cord blood; cord blood intended for use in the person from whom it came is not regulated, but cord blood for use in others is regulated as a drug and as a biologic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Consumers (Biologics) - Cord Blood Banking - Information for Consumers|url=http://www.fda.gov/BiologicsBloodVaccines/ResourcesforYou/Consumers/ucm236044.htm|publisher=FDA Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research|language=en|date=July 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several states also have regulations for cord blood banks.&lt;ref name=Armitage2016/&gt;

In Europe, Canada, and Australia use of cord blood is regulated as well.&lt;ref name=Armitage2016/&gt; In the [[United Kingdom]] the NHS Cord Blood Bank was set up in 1996 to collect, process, store and supply cord blood; it is a public cord blood bank and part of the NHS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About the NHS Cord Blood bank|url=http://www.nhsbt.nhs.uk/cordblood/about/|publisher=NHS Cord Blood Bank|accessdate=28 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Private and public banks===
A cord blood bank may be private (i.e. the blood is stored for and the costs paid by donor families) or public (i.e. stored and made available for use by unrelated donors).  While public cord blood banking is widely supported, private cord banking is controversial in both the medical and parenting community.  Although umbilical cord blood is well-recognized to be useful for treating hematopoietic and genetic disorders, some controversy surrounds the collection and storage of umbilical cord blood by private banks for the baby's use.   Only a small percentage of babies (estimated at between 1 in 1,000 to 1 in 200,000&lt;ref name=AAP2007/&gt;) ever use the umbilical cord blood that is stored.  [[The American Academy of Pediatrics]] 2007 Policy Statement on Cord Blood Banking stated: "Physicians should be aware of the unsubstantiated claims of private cord blood banks made to future parents that promise to insure infants or family members against serious illnesses in the future by use of the stem cells contained in cord blood."  and  "private storage of cord blood as 'biological insurance' is unwise" unless there is a family member with a current or potential need to undergo a stem cell transplantation.&lt;ref name=AAP2007/&gt;&lt;ref name=Thornley2009&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thornley|first1=I, et al.|title=Private cord blood banking: experiences and views of pediatric hematopoietic cell transplantation physicians|journal=Pediatrics|date=March 2009|volume=123|issue=3|pages=1011–7|pmid=19255033|pmc=3120215|doi=10.1542/peds.2008-0436}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The American Academy of Pediatrics also notes that the odds of using a person's own cord blood is 1 in 200,000  while the [[Institute of Medicine]] says that only 14 such procedures have ever been performed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Umbilical cord blood banking: Pros &amp; cons, costs, banking basics|url = http://www.webmd.com/parenting/baby/features/banking-your-babys-cord-blood?page=2|website = www.webmd.com|accessdate = 2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Private storage of one's own cord blood is unlawful in Italy and France, and it is also discouraged in some other European countries. The [[American Medical Association]] states "Private banking should be considered in the unusual circumstance when there exists a family predisposition to a condition in which umbilical cord stem cells are therapeutically indicated. However, because of its cost, limited likelihood of use, and inaccessibility to others, private banking should not be recommended to low-risk families."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Opinion 2.165 - Umbilical Cord Blood Banking|url = http://www.ama-assn.org/ama/pub/physician-resources/medical-ethics/code-medical-ethics/opinion2165.page|website = www.ama-assn.org|accessdate = 2015-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Society for Blood and Marrow Transplantation and the [[American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists]] also encourage public cord banking and discourage private cord blood banking. Nearly all cord blood transplantations come from public banks, rather than private banks,&lt;ref name=Thornley2009/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Cord Blood: Marketing Before Medicine?|url = http://abcnews.go.com/WN/WorldNews/cord-blood-banking-marketing-medicine/story?id=10577020|website = ABC News|date = 2010-05-07|accessdate = 2015-04-17|first = Dr Richard|last = Besser|first2 = Susan|last2 = Schwartz|first3 = Christine|last3 = Romo}}&lt;/ref&gt; partly because most treatable conditions can't use a person's own cord blood.&lt;ref name=AAP2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Hematology/Oncology|last2=American Academy of Pediatrics Section on Allergy/Immunology|last3=Lubin|first3=BH|last4=Shearer|first4=WT|title=Cord blood banking for potential future transplantation|journal=Pediatrics|date=January 2007|volume=119|issue=1|pages=165–70|pmid=17200285|url=http://pediatrics.aappublications.org/content/119/1/165.full|doi=10.1542/peds.2006-2901}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|title = Inside the Private Umbilical Cord Blood Banking Business|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303887804579501500366071342|newspaper = Wall Street Journal|date = April 25, 2014|first = Dionne|last = Searcey|first2 = Christopher S.|last2 = Stewart}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The World Marrow Donor Association and European Group on Ethics in Science and New Technologies states "The possibility of using one’s own cord blood stem cells for regenerative medicine is currently purely hypothetical....It is therefore highly hypothetical that cord blood cells kept for autologous use will be of any value in the future" and "the legitimacy of commercial cord blood banks for autologous use should be questioned as they sell a service which has presently no real use regarding therapeutic options."&lt;ref name=WMDA2011&gt;{{cite web|title=WMDA Policy Statement on the Utility of Autologous or Family Cord Blood Unit Storage|url=http://bloodcell.transplant.hrsa.gov/cord/files/wmdapolicystatement.pdf|publisher=World Marrow Donation Association|date=April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The American Academy of Pediatrics supports efforts to provide information about the potential benefits and limitations of cord blood banking and transplantation so that parents can make an informed decision. In addition, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommends that if a patient requests information on umbilical cord blood banking, balanced information should be given. Cord blood education is also supported by legislators at the federal and state levels. In 2005, the National Academy of Sciences published an Institute of Medicine (IoM) report titled "Establishing a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Program".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Establishing a National Cord Blood Stem Cell Bank Program - Institute of Medicine|url = http://www.iom.edu/en/Activities/Research/CordBloodBank.aspx|website = www.iom.edu|accessdate = 2015-04-17|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091123092544/http://www.iom.edu/en/Activities/Research/CordBloodBank.aspx|archivedate = 2009-11-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2004, the European Union Group on Ethics (EGE) has issued Opinion No.19&lt;ref name="EGE"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/european_group_ethics/docs/avis19_en.pdf Opinion N&amp;#176; 19] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071201142808/http://ec.europa.eu/european_group_ethics/docs/avis19_en.pdf |date=2007-12-01 }}, European Union Group on Ethics&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Ethical Aspects of Umbilical Cord Blood Banking''. The EGE concluded that "[t]he legitimacy of commercial cord blood banks for autologous use should be questioned as they sell a service, which has presently, no real use regarding therapeutic options. Thus they promise more than they can deliver. The activities of such banks raise serious ethical criticisms."&lt;ref name="EGE"/&gt;

== Research ==
Though uses of cord blood beyond blood and immunological disorders is speculative, some research has been done in other areas.&lt;ref name=Walther2009&gt;{{cite book|last1=Walther|first1=Mary Margaret|editor1-last=Appelbaum|editor1-first=Frederick R.|editor2-last=Forman|editor2-first=Stephen J.|editor3-last=Negrin|editor3-first=Robert S.|editor4-last=Blume|editor4-first=Karl G.|title=Thomas' hematopoietic cell transplantation stem cell transplantation|date=2009|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|location=Oxford|isbn=9781444303537|edition=4th|chapter=Chapter 39. Cord Blood Hematopoietic Cell Transplantation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any such potential beyond blood and immunological uses is limited by the fact that cord cells are [[hematopoietic]] stem cells (which can differentiate only into blood cells), and not [[pluripotent]] stem cells (such as [[embryonic stem cells]], which can differentiate into any type of tissue). Cord blood has been studied as a treatment for diabetes.&lt;ref name=Haller2008&gt;{{cite journal |author=Haller M J et al. |title=Autologous umbilical cord blood infusion for type 1 diabetes |journal=Exp. Hematol. |volume=36 |issue=6 |pages=710–715 |year=2008 |pmid=18358588 |pmc=2444031 |doi=10.1016/j.exphem.2008.01.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, apart from blood disorders, the use of cord blood for other diseases is not in routine clinical use and remains a major challenge for the stem cell community.&lt;ref name=Walther2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Haller2008/&gt;

Along with cord blood, [[Wharton's jelly]] and the [[cord lining]] have been explored as sources for [[mesenchymal stem cells]] (MSC),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Caseiro|first1=AR|last2=Pereira|first2=T|last3=Ivanova|first3=G|last4=Luís|first4=AL|last5=Maurício|first5=AC|title=Neuromuscular Regeneration: Perspective on the Application of Mesenchymal Stem Cells and Their Secretion Products|journal=Stem Cells International|date=2016|volume=2016|pages=1-16|pmid=26880998|pmc=4736584|doi=10.1155/2016/9756973}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and as of 2015 had been studied in vitro, in animal models, and in early stage clinical trials for cardiovascular diseases,&lt;ref name="pmid25861654"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors=Roura S, Pujal JM, Gálvez-Montón C, Bayes-Genis A | title=Impact of umbilical cord blood-derived mesenchymal stem cells on cardiovascular research | journal= [[BioMed Research International]] | volume=2015  | pages=1-6 | year=2015 |url=https://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2015/975302/ | doi= 10.1155/2015/975302 | pmc=4377460 | pmid = 25861654 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  as well as  neurological deficits, liver diseases, immune system diseases, diabetes, lung injury, kidney injury, and leukemia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=T|last2=Xia|first2=M|last3=Gao|first3=Y|last4=Chen|first4=Y|last5=Xu|first5=Y|title=Human umbilical cord mesenchymal stem cells: an overview of their potential in cell-based therapy|journal=Expert Opinion on Biological Therapy|date=2015|volume=15|issue=9|pages=1293–306|pmid=26067213|doi=10.1517/14712598.2015.1051528}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cord blood is being used to get stem cells with which to test in people with type 1 diabetes mellitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Reddi|first1=AS|last2=Kuppasani|first2=K|last3=Ende|first3=N|title=Human umbilical cord blood as an emerging stem cell therapy for diabetes mellitus|journal=Current Stem Cell Research &amp; Therapy|date=December 2010|volume=5|issue=4|pages=356–61|pmid=20528762|doi=10.2174/157488810793351668}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stem cells from umbilical cord blood are also being used in the treatment of a number of blood diseases including blood cancers.&lt;ref name=Glu2015&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gluckman|first1=E|title=Umbilical cord blood transfusions in low-income countries|journal=The Lancet.

Cord blood is also being studied as a substitute for normal blood transfusions in the developing world.&lt;ref name=Glu2015/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bmj.com/rapid-response/2011/10/28/do-not-discard-9999of-human-placental-umbilical-cord-blood-sake-stem-cells&lt;/ref&gt; More research is necessary prior to the generalized utilization of cord blood transfusion.&lt;ref name=Glu2015/&gt;

The '''frilled shark''' (''Chlamydoselachus anguineus'') is one of two [[extant taxon|extant]] [[species]] of [[shark]] in the [[family (biology)|family]] [[Chlamydoselachus|Chlamydoselachidae]], with a wide but patchy distribution in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s. This species is found over the outer [[continental shelf]] and upper [[continental slope]], generally near the bottom, though there is evidence of substantial upward movements. It has been caught as deep as {{convert|1570|m|ft|abbr=on}}, although it is uncommon below {{convert|1200|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| first= Dianne J. |last= Bray| year= 2011| title= Frill Shark, Chlamydoselachus anguineus| website=FishesofAustralia.net.au| accessdate= October 7, 2014| url=  http://www.fishesofaustralia.net.au/home/species/3419}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Suruga Bay]], [[Japan]], it is most common at depths of {{convert|50|–|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Exhibiting several primitive features, the frilled shark has often been termed a [[living fossil]]. It reaches a length of {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}} and has a dark brown, [[eel]]-like body with the [[dorsal fin|dorsal]], [[pelvic fin|pelvic]], and [[anal fin]]s placed far back. Its [[common name]] comes from the frilly or fringed appearance of its six pairs of [[gill slit]]s, with the first pair meeting across the throat.

Seldom observed, the frilled shark may capture prey by bending its body and lunging forward like a snake. The long, extremely flexible jaws enable it to swallow prey whole, while its many rows of small, needle-like teeth make it difficult for the prey to escape. It feeds mainly on [[cephalopod]]s, as well as [[bony fish]]es and other sharks. This species is [[aplacental viviparous]]: the [[embryo]]s emerge from their [[egg case (Chondrichthyes)|egg capsules]] inside the mother's [[uterus]], where they survive primarily on [[yolk]]. The [[gestation period]] may be as long as three and a half years, the longest of any [[vertebrate]]. Litter sizes vary from two to fifteen, and there is no distinct [[breeding season]]. Frilled sharks are occasional [[bycatch]] in [[commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]], but have little economic value.

==Taxonomy and phylogeny==
[[Image:Chlamydoselachus anguineus by garman.png|thumb|left|alt=Line drawing of a frilled shark curled on its side, with insets depicting dorsal and ventral views of the head, and of two teeth|Garman's illustration of the frilled shark, accompanying his 1884 species description]]
The frilled shark was first  scientifically recognized by German [[ichthyologist]] [[Ludwig Heinrich Philipp Döderlein|Ludwig Döderlein]], who visited Japan between 1879 and 1881 and brought two specimens to [[Vienna]]. However, his manuscript describing the species was lost, so the first description of the frilled shark was authored by American [[zoologist]] [[Samuel Garman]], working from a {{convert|1.5|m|adj=on}}-long female caught from [[Sagami Bay]] in Japan. His account, "An Extraordinary Shark", was published in an 1884 volume of ''Proceedings of the Essex Institute''.&lt;ref name="garman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bright"/&gt; Garman placed the new species in its own genus and family, and gave it the name ''Chlamydoselachus anguineus'' from the [[Greek language|Greek]] ''chlamy'' (frill) and ''selachus'' (shark), and the [[Latin]] ''anguineus'' for "eel-like".&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; Other [[common name]]s for this species include frill shark, lizard shark, scaffold shark, and silk shark.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fishbase"/&gt;

Several early authors believed the frilled shark to be a living representative of otherwise long-extinct groups of [[elasmobranch]]s (sharks, [[Batoidea|rays]], and their ancestors), based on its multiple-pointed teeth, the articulation of its upper jaw directly to the [[cranium]] behind the eyes (called "amphistyly"), and its "[[notochord]]-like" [[spinal column]] with indistinct [[vertebra]]e.&lt;ref name="compagno2"/&gt; Garman proposed that it was allied with the [[cladodont]]s, a now-obsolete taxonomic grouping containing forms that thrived during the [[Palaeozoic era]], such as ''[[Cladoselache]]'' from the [[Devonian period]] (416–359 [[mya (unit)|Mya]]). His contemporaries [[Theodore Gill]] and [[Edward Drinker Cope]] suggested it was instead related to the [[Hybodontiformes|hybodonts]], which were the dominant sharks during the [[Mesozoic era]]. Cope went as far as to assign this species to the fossil genus ''[[Xenacanthus|Didymodus]]''.&lt;ref name="garman and gill"/&gt;&lt;ref name="martin2"/&gt;

More recent investigations have found the similarities between the frilled shark and extinct groups may have been overstated or misinterpreted, and this shark exhibits a number of skeletal and muscular traits that firmly place it with the neoselachians (modern sharks and rays), and more specifically with the [[cow shark]]s in the order [[Hexanchiformes]] (though [[systematist]] [[Shigeru Shirai]] has proposed that it be placed in its own order, Chlamydoselachiformes).&lt;ref name="compagno2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="martin2"/&gt; Nevertheless, the frilled shark belongs to one of the oldest still-extant shark lineages, dating back to at least the [[Late Cretaceous]] (about 95 Mya) and possibly to the [[Late Jurassic]] (150 Mya).&lt;ref name="martin3"/&gt; Because of their ancient ancestry and primitive characteristics, the frilled shark and other members of this lineage have been described as a [[living fossil]].&lt;ref name="bright"/&gt; However, the frilled shark itself is a relatively recent species, with the earliest known fossil teeth belonging to this species dating to the early [[Pleistocene]] epoch.&lt;ref&gt;Marsili, S. (2007). ''Analisi systematic, paleoecological e paleobiogeographical Della selaciofauna polio-Pleistocene del Mediterraneo''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Distribution and habitat==
[[Image:Chlamydoselachus anguineus NOOA.jpg|thumb|left|alt=A shark swimming in dark water over sand; the labels indicate that it was taken on August 26, 2004 at a depth of 2866 ft, a temperature of 4.3°C, and a salinity of 35|First known footage of a frilled shark in its natural habitat, recorded on the [[Blake Plateau]] in 2004]]
Rather uncommon, the frilled shark has been recorded from a number of widely scattered locations in the [[Atlantic]] and [[Pacific Ocean]]s. In the eastern Atlantic, it occurs off northern [[Norway]], northern [[Scotland]], and western [[Ireland]], from [[France]] to [[Morocco]] including [[Madeira]], and off [[Mauritania]].&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt; In the central Atlantic, it has been caught at several locations along the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], from north of the [[Azores]] to the Rio Grande Rise off southern [[Brazil]], as well as over the Vavilov Ridge off [[West Africa]]. In the western Atlantic, it has been reported from waters off [[New England]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], and [[Suriname]].&lt;ref name="jenner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kukuev and pavlov"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ebert and compagno"/&gt; In the western Pacific, it is known from southeastern [[Honshu]], [[Japan]], to [[Taiwan]], off [[New South Wales]] and [[Tasmania]] in [[Australia]], and around [[New Zealand]]. In the central and eastern [[Pacific]], it has been found off [[Hawaii]] and [[California]] in the US, and northern [[Chile]].&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt; The frilled sharks off [[southern Africa]] were described as a different species, [[Southern African frilled shark|''C. africana'']], in 2009.&lt;ref name="ebert and compagno"/&gt;

The frilled shark inhabits the outer [[continental shelf]] and upper to middle [[continental slope]], seeming to favor [[upwelling]]s and other [[productivity (ecology)|biologically productive]] areas.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; Though it has been caught from a depth of {{convert|1570|m|ft|abbr=on}}, it usually does not occur deeper than {{convert|1000|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fishbase"/&gt; In [[Suruga Bay]], it is most common at a depth of {{convert|50|-|200|m|ft|abbr=on}}, except from August to November when the temperature at the {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}} water layer exceeds {{convert|15|C|F}} and the sharks shift into deeper water.&lt;ref name="kubota et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tanaka et al"/&gt; On rare occasions, this species has been seen at the surface.&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt; The frilled shark is usually found close to the bottom, with one individual observed swimming over an area of small sand dunes.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;&lt;ref name="jenner"/&gt; However, its diet suggests that it does make substantial forays upward into open water.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; This species may make [[diel vertical migration|vertical migrations]], approaching the surface at night to feed.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; There is spatial segregation by size and reproductive condition.&lt;ref name="tanaka et al"/&gt;

==Description==
[[Image:Frilled shark head2.jpg|thumb|alt=The head of a preserved shark, with the large mouth open|The frilled shark has long, terminally positioned jaws.]]
[[Image:Frilled shark throat.jpg|thumb|alt=The head of a preserved shark lying on its side, showing large, flared gill slits|The frilled shark's first pair of gill slits are continuous across its throat.]]
With its elongated, [[eel]]-like body and strange appearance, the frilled shark has long been likened to the mythical [[sea serpent]]. The head is broad and flattened with a short, rounded snout. The [[nostril]]s are vertical slits, separated into incurrent and excurrent openings by a leading flap of skin. The moderately large eyes are horizontally oval and lack [[nictitating membrane]]s (protective third eyelids). The very long jaws are positioned terminally (at the end of the snout), as opposed to the underslung jaws of most sharks. The corners of the mouth are devoid of furrows or folds. The tooth rows are rather widely spaced, numbering 19–28 in the upper jaw and 21–29 in the lower jaw.&lt;ref name="garman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ebert and compagno"/&gt; The teeth number around 300 in all; each tooth is small, with three slender, needle-like cusps alternating with two cusplets.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt;&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; There are six pairs of long [[gill slit]]s with a frilly appearance created by the extended tips of the [[gill filament]]s, giving this shark its name. The first pair of gill slits meet across the throat, forming a collar.&lt;ref name="garman"/&gt;

The [[pectoral fin]]s are short and rounded. The single, small [[dorsal fin]] is positioned far back on the body, about opposite the [[anal fin]], and has a rounded margin. The [[pelvic fin|pelvic]] and anal fins are large, broad, and rounded, and also positioned well back on the body. The [[caudal fin]] is very long and roughly triangular, without a lower lobe or a ventral notch on the upper lobe. There are a pair of thick skin folds of unknown function running along the belly, separated by a groove.&lt;ref name="garman"/&gt; The midsection is relatively longer in females than in males, with the pelvic fins pushed closer to the anal fin.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="last and stevens"/&gt; The [[dermal denticle]]s are small and shaped like the tip of a [[chisel]], becoming enlarged and sharp on the dorsal margin of the caudal fin.&lt;ref name="garman"/&gt; This species is a uniform dark brown or gray.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; The frilled shark differs from its southern African relative, ''C. africana'', in having more vertebrae (160–171 vs 147) and more turns in the [[spiral valve]] [[intestine]] (35–49 versus 26–28), as well as in various proportional measurements such as a longer head and shorter gill slits.&lt;ref name="ebert and compagno"/&gt; The maximum known length is {{convert|1.7|m|ft|abbr=on}} for males and {{convert|2.0|m|ft|abbr=on}} for females.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt;

==Biology and ecology==
Highly specialized for life in the deep sea, the frilled shark has a reduced, poorly [[calcification|calcified]] [[skeleton]] and an enormous [[liver]] filled with low-density [[lipid]]s, allowing it to maintain its position in the water column with little effort.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; It is one of the few sharks with an "open" [[lateral line]], in which the [[mechanoreceptor|mechanoreceptive]] [[hair cell]]s are positioned in grooves that are directly exposed to the surrounding seawater. This configuration is thought to be [[basal clade|basal]] in sharks and may enhance its sensitivity to the minute movements of its prey.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt;&lt;ref name="martin4"/&gt; Many frilled sharks are found with the tips of their tails missing, probably from predatory attacks by other shark species.&lt;ref name="tanaka et al"/&gt; [[Parasite]]s identified from this shark include a [[tapeworm]] in the genus ''Monorygma'', the [[trematoda|fluke]] ''Otodistomum veliporum'',&lt;ref name="collett"/&gt; and the [[nematode]] ''Mooleptus rabuka''.&lt;ref name="machida et al"/&gt;

Fossils of frilled sharks from the Takatika Grit of the [[Chatham Islands]] in New Zealand, dated to the [[Cretaceous–Paleogene boundary]], were found together with those of birds and conifer cones, which suggests that the sharks lived in shallow waters at that time. Previous research on other ''Chlamydoselachus'' species has shown that individuals living in shallower water had larger and stronger teeth for eating hard-shelled invertebrates. It has been hypothesized that frilled sharks, surviving the [[mass extinction]] of the K-T boundary event, were able to make use of vacated niches in shallow water and on continental shelves, the latter opening up a move to the deep-water habitats they now inhabit. Changing food availability may be reflected in how tooth morphology has shifted to become sharper and inward-pointing to prey on soft-bodied deep-sea animals. From the Late Paleocene to the present, frilled sharks may have been out-competed, restricting them to their current habitats and distribution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Consoli|first1=Christopher, P.|title=A rare Danian (Paleocene) Chlamydoselachus (Chondricthyes: Elasmobranchii) from the Takatika Grit, Chatham Islands, New Zealand|journal=Journal of Vertebrate Paleontology|date=2008|volume=28|issue=2|pages=285–290|doi=10.1671/0272-4634(2008)28[285:ardepc]2.0.co;2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feeding===
[[Image:Chlamydoselachus anguineus (mouth and teeth) by OpenCage.jpg|thumb|upright=0.9|left|alt=Close up of the lower jaw of a preserved shark, showing many small, sharp teeth|The numerous needle-like teeth of the frilled shark are suited for snagging soft-bodied squid.]]
The long jaws of the frilled shark are highly distensible with an extremely wide gape, allowing it to swallow whole prey over one-half its size.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; However, the length and articulation of its jaws means that it cannot deliver as strong a bite as more conventionally built sharks.&lt;ref name="moss"/&gt; Most captured individuals are found with no or barely identifiable [[stomach]] contents, suggesting a fast [[digestion]] rate and/or long intervals between feedings.&lt;ref name="kubota et al"/&gt; This species preys on [[cephalopod]]s, [[bony fish]]es, and smaller sharks.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; One {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long individual, caught off [[Chōshi, Chiba|Chōshi]], was found to have swallowed a {{convert|590|g|lb|abbr=on}} [[Japanese catshark]] (''Apristurus japonicus'').&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; [[Squid]] comprise some 60% of the diet of sharks in Suruga Bay; this includes not only slow-moving, deep-dwelling types, such as ''[[Chiroteuthis]]'' and ''[[Histioteuthis]]'', but also relatively large, powerful swimmers of the open ocean, such as ''[[Onychoteuthis]]'', ''[[Sthenoteuthis]]'', and ''[[Todarodes]]''.&lt;ref name="kubota et al"/&gt;

How the ostensibly weak-swimming frilled shark captures active, fast-moving squid is a matter of speculation. One possibility is that it takes advantage of injured squid, or those that are exhausted and dying after [[spawn (biology)|spawning]].&lt;ref name="kubota et al"/&gt; Alternatively, it may surprise its prey by curving its body and, bracing itself with its posteriorly positioned fins, launching a quick strike forward in the manner of a snake. It may also be able to close its gill slits and create [[Suction|negative pressure]] to suck prey into its mouth.&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; The many small, sharp, recurved teeth of the frilled shark are functionally similar to squid [[jigging|jigs]] and could easily snag the body or tentacles of a squid, particularly as they are rotated outwards when the jaws are protruded. Observations of captive frilled sharks swimming with their mouths open suggest that the small teeth, light against the dark mouth, may even fool squid into attacking and entangling themselves.&lt;ref name="ebert and compagno"/&gt;

===Life history===
The frilled shark is [[aplacental viviparous]]; the developing [[embryo]]s are mainly nourished by [[yolk]], though the difference in weight between the egg and the newborn indicates that the mother also provides additional nutrition via unknown means. Adult females have two functional [[ovary|ovaries]] and one functional [[uterus]], on the right. Unsurprisingly, there is no defined breeding season for either sex, as this shark inhabits depths at which there is little to no seasonal influence.&lt;ref name="tanaka et al"/&gt; A possible mating aggregation of 15 male and 19 female sharks has been recorded over a [[seamount]] on the Mid-Atlantic Ridge.&lt;ref name="kukuev and pavlov"/&gt; The litter size ranges from two to fifteen, with an average of six.&lt;ref name="ebert"/&gt; Females [[ovulation|ovulate]] eggs into the uterus about once every two weeks; [[vitellogenesis]] (yolk formation) and the growth of new ovarian eggs halt during pregnancy, apparently due to insufficient space inside the [[body cavity]].&lt;ref name="tanaka et al"/&gt;

Newly ovulated eggs and early-stage embryos are enclosed in a thin, ellipsoid, golden-brown [[egg case (Chondrichthyes)|capsule]]. When the embryo is {{convert|3|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, the head is pointed when seen from above or below, the jaws are barely developed, the external gills have begun to appear, and all the fins are present. The egg capsule is shed when the embryo grows to {{convert|6|-|8|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, and is expelled from the female's body; at this time the embryo's external gills are fully developed.&lt;ref name="tanaka et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nishikawa"/&gt; The size of the [[yolk sac]] remains mostly constant until around an embryonic length of {{convert|40|cm|in|abbr=on}}, whereupon it begins to shrink, mostly or completely disappearing by an embryonic length of {{convert|50|cm|in|abbr=on}}. The embryonic growth rate averages {{convert|1.4|cm|in|abbr=on}} per month, and therefore the entire [[gestation period]] may last three and a half years, far longer than any other [[vertebrate]].&lt;ref name="tanaka et al"/&gt;&lt;ref name="martin"/&gt; Newborn sharks measure {{convert|40|-|60|cm|in|abbr=on}} long; males attain [[sexual maturity]] at {{convert|1.0|-|1.2|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, and females at {{convert|1.3|-|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

==Human interactions==
The frilled shark has seldom been encountered alive, and thus poses no danger to humans (though scientists have accidentally cut themselves examining its teeth).&lt;ref name="compagno"/&gt; On August 27, 2004, the first observation of this species in its natural habitat was made by the [[remotely operated underwater vehicle|ROV]] ''[[Johnson Sea Link]] II'', on the [[Blake Plateau]] off the southeastern United States.&lt;ref name="jenner"/&gt; On January 21, 2007, a Japanese fisherman discovered a {{convert|1.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} long female alive at the surface, perhaps there because of illness or weakness from the warm water. It was brought to Awashima Marine Park in [[Shizuoka, Shizuoka|Shizuoka]], where it died after a few hours.&lt;ref name="underwatertimes"/&gt; Garman, and numerous authors since, have advanced the frilled shark as an explanation for sea serpent sightings. Because of the shark's modest size, some zoologists have posited the existence of a giant relative, particularly as larger ''Chlamydoselachus'' species are known from the fossil record.&lt;ref name="garman"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bright"/&gt;

Small numbers of frilled sharks are [[bycatch|caught incidentally]] by various deepwater [[commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]] around the world, using [[trawl]]s, [[gillnet]]s, and [[longline fishing|longlines]].&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt; In particular, it is regularly taken in Suruga Bay in bottom gillnets meant for [[sea bream]] and [[gnomefish]], and in midwater trawls meant for the [[shrimp]] ''[[Sergia lucens]]''. Japanese fishermen regard it as a nuisance, as it damages the [[fishing net|nets]].&lt;ref name="tanaka et al"/&gt; This shark is sometimes sold for meat or processed into [[fishmeal]], but is not economically significant. Because of its very low reproductive rate and the continuing expansion of [[commercial fishing|commercial fisheries]] into its habitat, the [[International Union for Conservation of Nature]] (IUCN) has previously listed it as [[Near Threatened]], although the species was downlisted to [[Least Concern]] in 2016.&lt;ref name="iucn"/&gt;

In December 2014, trawler skipper David Guillot caught a {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} frilled shark while "fishing in water more than {{convert|1|km|ft|abbr=on}} deep near [[Lakes Entrance, Victoria|Lakes Entrance]]", in [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], [[Australia]]. The shark was taken to the [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]], where its identification was confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/victoria/horrific-rarelysighted-frilled-shark-caught-off-southeast-victoria-20150121-12unjr.html |title='Horrific' rarely-sighted frilled shark caught off south-east Victoria |work=[[The Age]] |location=Melbourne, Australia |publisher=[[Fairfax Media]] |date=2015-01-21 |accessdate=2015-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early in April 2017, during the filming of a Japanese television variety program in [[Tokyo Bay]], a live specimen of the creature was captured.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.oricon.co.jp/news/2090645/full |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;TOKIO城島&amp;山口“幻の古代サメ”捕獲 『鉄腕!DASH!!』で再び超貴重生物を発見&lt;/nowiki&gt; |publisher=Oricon News |date=2017-05-13 |accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://mantan-web.jp/2017/05/13/20170512dog00m200053000c.html |title=TOKIO：城島＆山口が古代ザメ「ラブカ」を東京湾で捕獲 |publisher=MANTANWEB |date=2017-05-13 |accessdate=2017-05-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017 a group of scientists caught a {{convert|1.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} frilled shark in the waters off of [[Portimão]], [[Portugal]].

'''George John Frederick Sackville, 4th Duke of Dorset''' (15 November 1793 – 14 February 1815), styled '''Earl of Middlesex'''
until 1799, was a British nobleman.

The only son of [[John Sackville, 3rd Duke of Dorset]] and his wife Arabella, he was educated at [[Harrow School|Harrow]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]], receiving a [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge)|MA]] from the latter on 30 June 1813.

He was appointed [[High steward (civic)|High Steward]] of [[Stratford-on-Avon]], and was commissioned a [[Captain (British Army and Royal Marines)|captain]] of the local militia on 27 April 1813. On 26 July 1813, he was made lieutenant-colonel commandant of the Sevenoaks and Bromley battalion of militia. However, he died in February 1815, of a fall from his horse while hunting on Killiney Hill in County Dublin.  He had no children, so he was succeeded as duke by his cousin [[Charles Sackville-Germain, 5th Duke of Dorset|Charles Sackville-Germain]]. His estate of [[Knole]] passed to his sister [[Elizabeth Sackville-West, Countess De La Warr]].

'''Good clinical laboratory practice (GCLP)''' is a [[GxP]] guideline for laboratory samples from clinical studies.

[[Good clinical practice]] (GCP) does not define requirements for laboratories and [[good laboratory practice]] (GLP) focusses on pre-clinical analyses and not on human samples from clinical trials.  The [[Research Quality Association|Research Quality Association (RQA)]] suggested in 2003 a guideline to close the gap. Later the [[World Health Organization]] and the British [[Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency]] issued their own versions of a GCLP guideline.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5478">'''Hantu Raya''' in early Malay '''[[animism]]''', refers to a supreme ghost or demon that acts as a double for a black magic practitioner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dx5fZhYuja4C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=hantu+raya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O95ST4_yDITirAf_zMy6DQ&amp;ved=0CEAQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=hantu%20raya&amp;f=false Wives and Midwives: Childbirth and Nutrition in Rural Malaysia, By Carol Laderman]&lt;/ref&gt; Like the [[Toyol]] it has a master. In [[Malay folklore]], it is a spirit which is supposed to confer the owner with great powers. ''Hantu'' means ghost and ''raya'', great, in [[Malay language|Malay]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=K9Ly7Q9p-dgC&amp;pg=PA104&amp;dq=hantu+raya&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=YQ7vTJH6A4q-vgPjvejFDQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=hantu%20raya&amp;f=false Malay magic: an introduction to the folklore and popular religion of the ... By Walter William Skeat]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
'''Hantu Raya''' originates in [[Malaysia]] and is said to be the master of all ghosts (''hantu''). It is the leader of the underworld legion and those who make alliance with it, are considered powerful. Hantu Raya is the acronym for '''Hantu''' or [[Ghost]] and '''Raya''', large, huge, supreme, enormous, great, gigantic, titanic, humongous, as in "Malaysia Raya" and "Asia Raya" and [[Hari Raya Aidilfitri|Hari Raya]] (Great Celebration or Festival).

In modern [[Islamic]] Malay culture, the belief in Hantu Raya is no longer valid, but rather it is identified with a demon, [[Satan]] and the Djinn ([[Genie]]). [[Muslim]]s believe that djinns and demons are more powerful than man but less intelligent.

===Spirit worship===
In ancient times, Malay spirituality was a mix of [[animism]], [[Hinduism]] and [[Buddhism]]. Spirit worship was common and these beliefs persisted in rural areas until the latter half of the 20th century. In the case of Hantu Raya, the owner is said to have formed a pact with demon or inherited it from older generations in the form known as '''Saka''' or legacy which is handed on down the generations. In return for the advantages and power, the owner agrees to provide for the ghost and appoints a new owner for it before dying.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.everything2.com/index.pl?node_id=1528018 Hantu @ Everything2.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, people who fail to untie their bond with the hantu will suffer especially during death. Hantu Raya will resemble the look of its owner ever after death and go roaming. People seeing him will assume that the deceased has been brought back to life. It will search for food and new owner at night and goes around haunting people.

Another legend goes that the dying soul will face difficulty in dying and becomes a living corpse or [[zombie]].

==Functions==
Hantu Raya is capable of materializing itself into another human being or animals and sometimes makes itself a double for the owner.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=eO2FD2K3iokC&amp;pg=PA120&amp;dq=hantu+raya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O95ST4_yDITirAf_zMy6DQ&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q=hantu%20raya&amp;f=false ''Taming the Wind of Desire: Psychology, Medicine, and Aesthetics in Malay...'' by Carol Laderman, "Taking Human Form".]&lt;/ref&gt; Among its other trick is to form its owner's shape and sleep with the owner's partners. It can be used to perform heavy duties as commanded by its master, even to harm his enemies. It can also possess or cause death to other people if so ordered.

Normally Hantu Raya feasts on ''ancak'' – an offering made for the spirits, containing: yellow glutinous rice, eggs, roasted chicken, rice flakes and a doll. In some cases Hantu Raya is offered the blood of a slaughtered animal as a sacrifice. Food offerings must strictly be observed in a timely manner, to avoid any harm caused by the hantu.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=RajBf3GDsysC&amp;pg=PA21&amp;dq=hantu+raya&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=O95ST4_yDITirAf_zMy6DQ&amp;ved=0CFsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=hantu%20raya&amp;f=false Demons, By Kris Hirschmann]&lt;/ref&gt;

Hantu raya is also blamed for childbirth death, which was quite common in the days before modern medicine.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=dx5fZhYuja4C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=hantu+raya&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Ew3vTNr3L4m6vQO1qfnODQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=hantu%20raya&amp;f=false Wives and Midwives: Childbirth and Nutrition in Rural Malaysia By Carol Laderman]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film==
''Jangan Pandang Belakang'' (or, ''Don't Look Back'') is a Malay [[horror movie]] based on the "hantu raya" demon. The story is about a young man named Darma (Pierre Andre) who tries to find out the truth about the death of his fiancée, Rose. A Malay family has a "saka" (thing that is passed down from generation to generation in the family), in the form of hantu raya. They keep this hantu because they want to benefit, because it can make them richer, stronger or whatever they desire, but it asks something in return. It will haunt or otherwise disturb their descendants unless somebody does something about it, like contain it or removing it altogether from the family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120701003629/http://headangol.blogspot.com/search/label/hantu%20raya My head's angol: hantu raya&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] &lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1657">'''Heterologous expression''' refers to the [[gene Expression|expression]] of a [[gene]] or part of a gene in a [[host organism]], which does not naturally have this gene or gene fragment. Insertion of the gene in the heterologous host is performed by [[recombinant DNA technology]]. After being inserted in the host, the gene may be integrated into the host DNA, causing permanent expression, or not integrated, causing transient expression. Heterologous expression can be done in many type of host organisms. The host organism can be a bacterium, yeast, mammalian cell, or plant cell. This host is called the "expression system".
Homologous expression, on the other hand, refers to the overexpression of a gene in a system from where it originates.

Genes are subjected to heterologous expression often to study specific protein interactions. ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', yeast (''[[Saccharomyces cerevisiae|S. cerevisiae]], [[Pichia pastoris|P. pastoris]]''), [[Immortalised cell line|immortalized mammalian cells]], and amphibian [[Oocyte|oocytes]] (i.e. unfertilized eggs) are commonly for studies that require heterologous expression. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007/978-3-540-29678-2_2190|title=Encyclopedia of Neuroscience|date=2009|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|isbn=9783540237358|editor-last=Binder|editor-first=Marc D.|pages=1830–1830|language=en|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-29678-2_2190|editor-last2=Hirokawa|editor-first2=Nobutaka|editor-last3=Windhorst|editor-first3=Uwe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5259">'''Illusionism''' is a [[metaphysics|metaphysical theory]] first propounded by professor Saul Smilansky of the [[University of Haifa]].  It holds that people have illusory beliefs about [[free will]].{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}  Furthermore, it holds that it is both of key importance and morally right that people not be disabused of these beliefs, because the illusion has benefits both to individuals and to society.{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}}{{sfn|Holroyd|2010|p=110}}  Belief in [[hard incompatibilism]], argues Smilansky, removes an individual's basis for a sense of self-worth in his or her own achievements.  It is "extremely damaging to our view of ourselves, to our sense of achievement, worth, and self-respect".{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}

Neither compatibilism nor hard determinism are the whole story, according to Smilansky, and there exists an ''ultimate perspective'' in which ''some'' parts of compatibilism are valid and ''some'' parts of hard determinism are valid.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=4}}  However, Smilansky asserts, the nature of what he terms the ''fundamental dualism'' between hard determinism and compatibilism is a morally undesirable one, in that both beliefs, in their absolute forms, have adverse consequences.  The distinctions between choice and luck made by compatibilism are important, but wholly undermined by hard determinism.  But, conversely, hard determinism undermines the morally important notions of justice and respect, leaving them nothing more than "shallow" notions.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=6}}

Smilansky's thesis is considered a radical one,{{sfn|Kane|2011|p=26}} and other philosophers disagree with it.  Professor [[Derk Pereboom (philosopher)|Derk Pereboom]] of Cornell University, for example, disagrees that hard incompatibilism necessarily does away with self-worth, because to a large extent that sense of self-worth isn't related to will at all, let alone to free will.  Aspects of worthiness such as natural beauty, native physical ability, and intelligence are not voluntary.{{sfn|Pereboom|2008|p=472}}  Professor James Lenman of the University of Glasgow (at the time) takes a similar line, arguing that Smilansky's expression of the problems is overstated.  The problems that he presents are less fundamentally metaphysical than simply practical in nature.{{sfn|Lenman|2002|p=15–17}}

'''Italian submarine ''Corallo''''' was a {{sclass-|Perla|submarine|2}} built for the [[Royal Italian Navy]] (''Regia Marina'') during the 1930s. She was named after a gemstone [[Precious coral|Coral]].

==Design and description==
The ''Perla''-class submarines were essentially repeats of the preceding {{sclass-|Sirena|submarine|4}}. The modifications that were made compared to the boats of the previous series were mostly of upgrade nature. Among them were enlargement of the false tower at the top, more modern engines, installation of a radiogoniometer that could be controlled from inside the ship. Improvements and the installation of new air conditioning equipment meant a slight increase in displacement, and increase in the fuel stowage also increased the autonomy of these boats compared to the previous series.&lt;ref name=ISI1&gt;Pollina, p.155&lt;/ref&gt; Their designed full load [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]] was {{convert|695|t|LT|sp=us}} surfaced and {{convert|855|t|LT|sp=us}} submerged, but varied somewhat depending on the boat and the builder. The submarines were {{convert|197|ft|6|in|m|sp=us}} long, had a [[beam (nautical)|beam]] of {{convert|21|ft|m|sp=us}} and a [[draft (hull)|draft]] of {{convert|15|ft|m|sp=us}} to {{convert|15|ft|5|in|m|sp=us}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ISI&gt;Pollina, pp.152-153&lt;/ref&gt;

For surface running, the boats were powered by two [[diesel engine]]s, each driving one [[propeller shaft]] with overall power of {{convert|675|-|750|hp|abbr=on|lk=in|0|adj=on}}.&lt;ref name=b4/&gt; When submerged each propeller was driven by a {{convert|400|hp|0|adj=on}} [[electric motor]]. They could reach {{convert|14|kn|lk=in}} on the surface and {{convert|7.5|kn}} underwater. On the surface, the ''Perla'' class had a range of {{convert|5200|nmi|lk=in}} at {{convert|8|kn}}, submerged, they had a range of {{convert|74|nmi|abbr=on}} at {{convert|4|kn}}.&lt;ref name=b4&gt;Bagnasco, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ISI&gt;Pollina, pp.152-153&lt;/ref&gt;

The boats were armed with six internal {{convert|53.3|cm|in|1|abbr=on|sp=us}} [[torpedo tube]]s, four in the bow and two in the stern. One reload torpedo was carried for each tube, for a total of twelve. They were also armed with one [[Škoda 10 cm K10#OTO 100.2F47 History|{{convert|100|mm|in|abbr=on|0}}]] [[deck gun]] for combat on the surface. The light anti-aircraft armament consisted of one or two pairs of [[Breda Model 1931 Machine Gun|{{convert|13.2|mm|in|abbr=on}}]]  machine guns.&lt;ref name=ISI/&gt;

==Construction and career==
''Corallo'' was built by [[Cantieri Riuniti dell' Adriatico|CRDA]] at their shipyard in [[Monfalcone]], laid on 1 October 1935, [[Ship naming and launching|launched]] on 2 August 1936 and completed on 26 September 1936.&lt;ref name=ISI&gt;Pollina, pp.152-153&lt;/ref&gt;

After delivery, ''Corallo'' was assigned to the 34th Squadron (III Submarine Group) based at [[Messina]]. After a brief training, she carried out a long endurance cruise in the [[Dodecanese]] and the [[Adriatic]]. In 1937 she carried out a training campaign, followed by another one in 1938. On October 15, 1938 she was temporarily assigned to Flotilla Submarine school. In 1939 ''Corallo'' returned to active duty, and was assigned to the 72nd Squadron (VII Submarine Group) based at [[Cagliari]] where she remained until the end of her career.&lt;ref name="m2"&gt;[http://www.mucamonfalcone.it/aspx/ViewProspettazioneNave.aspx?idCon=1221&amp;idAmb=149&amp;idMenu=-1&amp;liv=0&amp;order=0&amp;tp=vArchivioNavi&amp;cosaCerca=corallo ''Corallo'' at Monfalcone Naval Museum]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kingdom of Italy|Italy]]'s entry into [[World War II]] found ''Corallo'' at [[Monfalcone]] undergoing repairs and maintenance which were finished in late August 1940. On September 3, 1940 ''Corallo'', under command of captain Loris Albanese, was sent to patrol an area 60 miles south of [[Crete]], between [[Gavdos|Gaudo]] and [[Alexandria]]. At 18:00 on September 17 ''Corallo'' sighted in the position {{Coord|33|34|N|25|34|E}} a zigzagging British column heading towards [[Alexandria]]. The British force was made up of the aircraft carrier {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}}, battleship {{HMS|Valiant|1914|6}} escorted by five destroyers returning to [[Alexandria]] after bombarding [[Derna, Libya|Derna]] and [[Benghazi]]. At 18:30 ''Corallo'' launched two torpedoes from 1,500 meters against {{HMS|Illustrious|87|6}} and immediately dove down to 80 meters &lt;ref name=g1&gt;Giorgerini, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;. After 75 seconds two loud explosions were heard, but no ship, however, was hit. ''Corallo'' was then subjected to depth charge attacks by the destroyers which went on for 3 hours.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; The submarine suffered some damage which impaired her operational efficiency, and two crew members died in the attack. Since the damage to submarine could not be repaired by means available at sea, ''Corallo'' was forced to interrupt her mission and headed to [[Tobruk]] which she reached on September 18, 1940 &lt;ref name=g2&gt;Giorgerini, p. 245&lt;/ref&gt;.

On November 5, 1940 ''Corallo'' and four other submarines ({{ship|Italian submarine|Topazio||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Fratelli Bandiera||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Pier Capponi||2}} and {{ship|Italian submarine|Goffredo Mameli||2}}) were deployed about 90 miles south-east of [[Malta]] with the task of intercepting a British convoy, part of Operation "Coat". ''Corallo'' and other submarines formed a barrier with a 20 to 30 miles spacing between them. ''Corallo'', however, did not detect any enemy vessels &lt;ref name=g3&gt;Giorgerini, p. 267&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bertke4&gt;Bertke, p.108&lt;/ref&gt;.

On January 21, 1941 ''Corallo'' and {{ship|Italian submarine|Diaspro||2}} patrolled off the northern Tunisian coast.&lt;ref name=bertke&gt;Bertke, p.242&lt;/ref&gt; ''Corallo'' had to abort her mission almost immediately due to a failure, and the submarine had to return to the base.&lt;ref name="x2"&gt;[http://www.xmasgrupsom.com/Sommergibili/corallo.htm ''Corallo'' on XMasGrupSom]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 1941 she was on patrol north of Cape Bougaroun, but engine problems forced the submarine to return to the base.

In April 1941 she patrolled south of [[Sardinia]], but her mission was cut short again, this time because of the adverse weather conditions.&lt;ref name=x2/&gt;

In May 1941 she patrolled around 50 miles west of the island of [[Galite Islands|La Galite]] without any sightings.&lt;ref name=x2/&gt;

In July 1941 ''Corallo'' was involved in another uneventful patrol southwest of [[Sardinia]].&lt;ref name=x2/&gt;

In October 1941 she was posted off [[Cap Zebib]], but still without success.&lt;ref name=x2/&gt;

On November 3, 1941 ''Corallo'' under command of captain Andreani was deployed west of [[Malta]] as a protective screen for a large Italian "Beta" convoy travelling to [[Libya]]. Her job was to detect and report any British naval movements west of Malta, and attack the sighted ships when possible. On November 9, 1941 the "Beta" convoy was intercepted and destroyed by British Force K in the [[Battle of the Duisburg Convoy]]. Force K managed to leave [[Malta]] without ''Corallo'' being able to detect it since it did not pass through her area of operation, but rather through the one controlled by {{ship|Italian submarine|Settembrini||2}}. At sunset, the submarine left her assigned area and moved to her new area of operations off [[Algeria]] and [[Tunisia]].

In January 1942 she patrolled between [[Malta]] and [[Capo Passero]].&lt;ref name=x2/&gt;

In March 1942 ''Corallo'' again patrolled off [[Malta]].&lt;ref name=x2/&gt;

In April 1942 ''Coralllo'' was sent to patrol off [[Cape Bon]]. At 4:10 on April 28, 1942 off [[Annaba|Bona]], ''Corallo'' stopped Tunisian sailboats ''Dar es Salaam'' (138 GRT) and ''Tunis'' (41 GRT). The boats carried a Vichy France flag, but didn't have a special permit allowing them to sail. ''Corallo'' took their crew on board, thirteen men in total, then sank the sailboats with gunfire in the position {{coord|37|01|N|11|09|E}}. &lt;ref name=g4&gt;Giorgerini, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;

In May and June 1942 she patrolled east of the island of [[Galite Islands|La Galite]]. At 2:00 on June 7, 1942, ''Corallo'' stopped another Tunisian sailboat ''Hady M'Hammed'' (26 GRT).  Believing the boat was carrying materials on behalf of the Allies, captain Adreani ordered the crew of the sailboat (6 men) to abandon ship, took them prisoners and then sank the sailboat with gunfire in the position {{coord|37|24|N|09|10|E}}.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt; ''Corallo'' then received an order to patrol another area northwest of [[Algiers]]. Upon return to the base, a new commander, captain Guido Guidi, was appointed.

On June 11, 1942 the submarine was sent along with four other submarines ({{ship|Italian submarine|Onice||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Ascianghi||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Aradam||2}} and {{ship|Italian submarine|Dessiè||2}}) to patrol the triangle between [[Malta]], [[Pantelleria]] and [[Lampedusa]] with the task of interception of a British convoy, part of Operation ''Harpoon''. ''Corallo'' did not, however, sight any enemy ships &lt;ref name=g5&gt;Giorgerini, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt;.

In October 1942 she was sent to patrol an area south of the [[Balearic Islands]].&lt;ref name=x2/&gt;

In November 1942 after the launch of [[Operation Torch]] she was deployed to patrol an area off [[Bizerta]]. ''Corallo'' also penetrated into [[Skikda|Philippeville]] harbor, but there were no ships to attack.&lt;ref name=x2/&gt;

In early December she was deployed together with {{ship|Italian submarine|Alagi||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Argento||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Bronzo||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Galatea||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Porfido||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Volframio||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Mocenigo||2}}, {{ship|Italian submarine|Diaspro||2}} and {{ship|Italian submarine|Malachite||2}} in the western Mediterranean, as a defensive screen protecting Axis convoys to [[Tunis]].

On December 10, 1942 ''Corallo'' sailed from [[Cagliari]] to patrol an area between [[Annaba|Bona]] and [[Bizerta]] with a task of trying to penetrate [[Bougie]] harbor during the night of December 13 and destroying any ships she would have found there. After the departure, ''Corallo'' was never heard from again.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;

After the end of the war, from British records, it was established that on the night of December 13, 1942, ''Corallo'' 14 miles from [[Bougie]], was spotted and attacked by four British escorts ({{HMS|Enchantress|L56|6}}, {{HMS|Fleetwood|U47|6}}, {{HMS|Velox|D34|6}}, {{HMS|Venomous|D75|6}}) from the KMS-4 convoy, sailing from [[Gibraltar]] to [[Algiers]]. ''Corallo'' was depth charged, damaged and forced to surface. At this point, according to some sources, ''Corallo'' tried to engage {{HMS|Enchantress|L56|6}} with her deck gun, but the British sloop accelerated and rammed the submarine. While {{HMS|Enchantress|L56|6}} suffered serious collision damage even to her inner structures, ''Corallo'' had the worst of it, and sunk with all hands (commander Guidi, 5 officers, and 43 other crew members) in the position {{coord|36|58|N|05|07|E}}.&lt;ref name=m2/&gt;

'''James Anthony Traficant Jr.''' (May 8, 1941 – September 27, 2014) was a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]], and later independent, politician and member of the [[United States House of Representatives]] from [[Ohio]].  He represented the [[Ohio's 17th congressional district|17th Congressional District]], which centered on his hometown of [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]] and included parts of three counties in northeast Ohio's [[Mahoning Valley]]. He was [[Expulsion from the United States Congress|expelled from the House]] after being convicted of taking bribes, filing false tax returns, [[Racket (crime)|racketeering]] and forcing his aides to perform chores at his farm in Ohio and houseboat in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref name=April_2002&gt;{{cite web|title=Traficant guilty of bribery, racketeering|url=http://www.cnn.com/2002/LAW/04/11/traficant.trial|website=cnn.com|date=12 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sentenced to prison and released on September 2, 2009, after serving a seven-year sentence.

Traficant died on September 27, 2014, as the result of injuries sustained in an accident that had occurred several days earlier when his tractor flipped over as he was driving it into his barn.

==Early life, education, and career==
Born into a working-class [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] family in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], Traficant was the son of Agnes (''née'' Farkas) and James Anthony Traficant Sr.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jerome |first=Richard |url=http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20137670,00.html |title=To the Bitter End – Crime &amp; Courts |publisher=People.com |date= |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=VRFJAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=TYMMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3191,5487854&amp;dq=agnes+farkas+traficant&amp;hl=en Mass, Parties Fete Traficants on Anniversary], Youngstown Vindicator, June 15, 1977&lt;/ref&gt;  He was of mostly Italian and Slovak ancestry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MyIoy7F9uEoC&amp;pg=PA221 |title=Buy American: The Untold Story of Economic Nationalism – Dana Frank – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.ca |date= |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traficant graduated from [[Cardinal Mooney High School (Youngstown, Ohio)|Cardinal Mooney High School]] in 1959 and the [[University of Pittsburgh]] in 1963. He played [[quarterback]] for Pitt's [[American football|football]] team, and his teammates included [[Mike Ditka]].&lt;ref&gt;Milan Simonich, Pittsburgh Post-Gazette, [http://old.post-gazette.com/nation/20020412traf0412p3.asp Rep.

At the start of his career, Traficant worked as consumer finance director for the Youngstown Community Action Program.  He taught courses on drug and alcohol dependency and recovery at Youngstown State University and [[Kent State University]], as well as lecturing on drug and alcohol abuse for colleges and government agencies outside Ohio. In addition, Traficant taught at the Ohio Peace Officer Training Academy.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Government Printing Office, [https://books.google.com/books?id=zRw5AQAAMAAJ&amp;q=traficant+youngstown+community+action+program&amp;dq=traficant+youngstown+community+action+program&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=ZsC-U7WJG5TQsQSqt4C4Cg&amp;ved=0CCEQ6AEwAQ Congressional Directory], 1999, page 213&lt;/ref&gt; He was the executive director of the Mahoning County Drug Program from 1971 to 1981, and Sheriff of [[Mahoning County]] from 1981 to 1985. While serving as sheriff, Traficant made national headlines by refusing to execute foreclosure orders on several unemployed homeowners, many of whom had been left out of work by the recent closures of steel mills. This endeared him to the local population, which was dealing with a declining economy following the closures and relocations of steel making and steel-associated businesses.&lt;ref name="peykonyt"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00E6D81531F93BA15751C0A9649C8B63&amp;st=cse&amp;sq=peyko&amp;scp=1 | first = Mark C | last = Peyko |title = Notes From Youngstown: The Angry Voice of a City Left Behind | work = The New York Times | accessdate = 2008-03-24 | date=February 28, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, he was charged with racketeering for accepting bribes. Traficant, who represented himself in the criminal trial, argued that he accepted the bribes only as part of his own alleged secret undercover investigation into corruption. Traficant was acquitted of the charges, becoming the only person ever to win a [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) case while representing himself.&lt;ref&gt;Scott A. Frisch, Sean Q. Kelly, [https://books.google.com/books?id=QA1Mx_51nbUC&amp;pg=PA170&amp;dq=traficant+sheriff+acquitted+fbi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fsG-U5H6N-jQsATV_YHIBQ&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=traficant%20sheriff%20acquitted%20fbi&amp;f=false Committee Assignment Politics in the U.S. House of Representatives], 2006, page 170&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Quarterly, Traficant Responds Defiantly to Corruption Indictment, Volume 59, 2001, page 989&lt;/ref&gt;

Publicity from the RICO trial increased Traficant's local visibility. He was elected as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] to Congress from Ohio's 17th District, defeating [[Lyle Williams]], a three-term [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] incumbent. He was [[Ohio's 17th congressional district|reelected eight times]] without serious opposition.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
While in Congress, Traficant was a supporter of [[Immigration reduction in the United States|immigration reduction]],&lt;ref&gt;"[http://profiles.numbersusa.com/improfile.php3?DistSend=OH&amp;VIPID=647 All Immigration Votes of Representative James Traficant]." [[NumbersUSA]]. Accessed January 6, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; and a strong opponent of [[illegal immigration]]. In the controversy surrounding the [[Bob Dornan#Defeat|defeat of Congressman Bob Dornan]] (R-CA) by Democrat [[Loretta Sanchez]], Traficant was the only Democratic member of Congress who advocated a new election, due to Dornan's allegations of voting in that race by undocumented immigrants. The allegations went unproven, and a new election was not held.

Traficant's major legislative accomplishment in the House was the adoption of some of his proposals to constrain enforcement activities by the [[Internal Revenue Service]] against delinquent taxpayers.

After the Republicans took control of the House in 1995, Traficant tended to vote more often with the Republicans than with his own party. On the issue of abortion, Traficant voted with the position of the [[National Right to Life Committee]] 95% of the time in the 105th Congress, and 100% of the time in the 106th and 107th Congresses. However, he voted against all four articles of impeachment against [[Bill Clinton]]. After he voted for Republican [[Dennis Hastert]] for [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] in 2001, the Democrats stripped him of his seniority and refused to give him any committee assignments. Because the Republicans did not assign him to any committees either, Traficant became the first member of the House of Representatives in over a century—outside the top leadership—to lack a single committee assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Katherine |last=Rizzo |agency=Associated Press |url=http://lubbockonline.com/stories/050801/upd_075-2220.shtml |title=Armey: GOP doesn't want Traficant |publisher=Lubbockonline.com|date=2001-05-08 |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defense of John Demjanjuk===
Traficant championed the unpopular cause of [[John Demjanjuk]], a [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]]-born autoworker from [[Seven Hills, Ohio|Seven Hills]], who had been convicted in [[Israel]] and sentenced to hang for having been the brutal [[Internment#Concentration camp|concentration camp]] guard [[Ivan the Terrible (Treblinka guard)|Ivan the Terrible]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jta.org/news/article/2009/10/30/1008850/traficant-says-he-will-testify-for-demjanjuk |title=Traficant says he would testify for Demjanjuk |publisher=[[Jewish Telegraphic Agency]] |date=October 30, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130415083224/http://jta.org/news/article/2009/10/30/1008850/traficant-says-he-will-testify-for-demjanjuk |archivedate=April 15, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; For almost a decade, Traficant (along with [[Pat Buchanan]])&lt;ref&gt;[[Pat Buchanan|Buchanan, Pat]] (2011-05-13) [http://www.amconmag.com/blog/2011/05/12/demjanjuk-convicted-by-the-kgb/ Demjanjuk Convicted – By the KGB], ''[[The American Conservative]]''&lt;/ref&gt; insisted that Demjanjuk had been denied a fair trial, and been the victim of mistaken identity; in 1993 the [[Supreme Court of Israel]] overturned the conviction, on the basis of doubt. Demjanjuk was later deported to Germany on May 11, 2009, after the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] refused to overturn his deportation order. Demjanjuk was tried and convicted by a German criminal court of being an accessory to murder, but died before the German Appellate Court could hear his case, thereby voiding the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Aderet, Ofer |title=News article: Convicted Nazi criminal Demjanjuk deemed innocent in Germany over technicality |publisher=Haaretz.com |date=March 23, 2012 |accessdate=July 4, 2012 |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/news/convicted-nazi-criminal-demjanjuk-deemed-innocent-in-germany-over-technicality-1.420280}}&lt;/ref&gt;. [[Drake Caggiula]] was later not charged for a similar offense by the German government.

===Defense of Arthur Rudolph===
Following [[Pat Buchanan]]'s recommendation to reconsider the denaturalization of former Nazi and [[NASA]] scientist [[Arthur Rudolph]], who had been brought to the United States under [[Operation Paperclip]], Traficant spoke to the Friends of Arthur Rudolph, an organization based in [[Huntsville, Alabama]].&lt;ref name="moniquegerman173"&gt;{{cite book |last=Laney |first=Monique |date=2015 |title=German Rocketeers in the Heart of Dixie: Making Sense of the Nazi Past During the Civil Rights Era  |location=New Haven and London |publisher=Yale University Press |pages=173–174 |isbn=978-0-300-19803-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that denaturalization had happened because of a "powerful Jewish lobby" influencing Congress.&lt;ref name="moniquegerman173"/&gt; He added that it was a violation of a United States citizen's civil rights, and he suggested that Rudolph return to the United States nonetheless.&lt;ref name="moniquegerman173"/&gt; Additionally, he "introduced a resolution in Congress [...] calling for an investigation into the [[Office of Scientific Intelligence|OSI]]'s handling of Rudolph's case."&lt;ref name="moniquegerman173"/&gt; Meanwhile, in 1990, Traficant had planned to meet Rudolph in [[Niagara Falls]], on the Canadian–American border; however, Rudolph was arrested by immigration officials in [[Toronto]], and the meeting never occurred.&lt;ref name="moniquegerman173"/&gt;

===Trial and expulsion===
In 2002, Traficant was indicted on federal corruption charges for taking campaign funds for personal use. Again, he opted to represent himself, insisting that the trial was part of a vendetta against him dating back to his 1983 trial. After a two-month federal trial, on April 11, 2002, he was convicted of 10 felony counts including bribery, racketeering and tax evasion.&lt;ref name=April_2002 /&gt; Per House rules, he lost his right to vote on legislation pending an investigation by the [[United States House Committee on Ethics]].

Eventually, the House Ethics Committee recommended that Traficant be expelled from Congress. On July 24 the House voted to expel him by a 420–1 vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In the Matter of Representative James A. Traficant Jr.|url=http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/query/F?r107:196:./temp/~r107VGqzPr:e164602:| work=U.S. House of Representatives| date=24 July 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sole vote against expulsion was Rep. [[Gary Condit]], who at the time was in the midst of a scandal of his own and had been defeated in his reelection primary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clerk.house.gov/evs/2002/roll346.xml|title=Final Vote Results for Roll Call 346 | last=Trandahl | first=Jeff | date=July 24, 2002 | work=clerk.house.gov | publisher=Clerk of the United States House of Representatives | accessdate=March 22, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traficant was the first representative to be expelled since [[Michael Myers (politician)|Michael Myers]]'s expulsion in 1980 as a result of the [[Abscam]] scandal.

After his expulsion, Traficant ran as an independent candidate for another term in the House while incarcerated at the [[United States Penitentiary, Allenwood]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/08/05/traficant.prison/|title=Traficant arrives at federal prison|date=2002-08-06|publisher=CNN|accessdate=2009-11-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091010204322/http://archives.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/08/05/traficant.prison/|archivedate=October 10, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received 28,045 votes, or 15 percent, and became one of only a handful of individuals in the history of the United States to run for a federal office from prison. The election was won by one of his former aides, [[Tim Ryan (politician)|Tim Ryan]].&lt;ref name="2010-election"/&gt;

== Prison and later life ==

=== Incarceration ===
Traficant entered the [[Federal Correctional Institution, Allenwood]], on August 6, 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

He was released on September 2, 2009, at age 68, and was subject to three years of [[probation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cantonrep.com/ohio/x1595417268/Ex-congressman-Traficant-freed |title=Ex-congressman Traficant freed |last=Merchant |first=Norman |date=2009-09-02 |accessdate=2009-09-29 |agency=Associated Press |work=Canton Rep}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While in prison, Traficant received support from [[David Duke]], who urged visitors to his personal website to donate to his personal fund. Duke posted a letter written by Traficant stating that he was targeted by the [[United States Department of Justice]] for, among other things, defending [[John Demjanjuk]]. Traficant also claimed, in the letter, that he knew facts about "[[Waco siege|Waco]], [[Ruby Ridge]], [[Pan Am Flight 103]], [[Jimmy Hoffa]] and the [[Assassination of John F. Kennedy|John F. Kennedy assassination]]", which he may divulge in the future. Author [[Michael Collins Piper]], who initially helped circulate Traficant's letter, said that "There's stuff I've written about Traficant that's showing up in places I don't even know. It's like (six) degrees of separation with the Internet now," and denied that Traficant had any direct connections to Duke.&lt;ref name="davidduke"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tribtoday.com/page/content.detail/id/526652.html?nav=5021|title=White nationalists, conspiracy theorists join Traficant’s cause|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901054106/http://www.tribtoday.com/page/content.detail/id/526652.html?nav=5021|first=Bill|last=Rodgers|date=August 30, 2009|work=[[Tribune Chronicle]]|archivedate=September 1, 2009|accessdate=January 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Release ===
Traficant was released from prison on September 2, 2009.&lt;ref name="TraficantBOP"/&gt; On September 6, 2009, 1200 supporters welcomed him home at a banquet with an [[Elvis impersonator]], and a Traficant lookalike contest. "Welcome home Jimbo" was printed on T-shirts. "I think it's time to tell the FBI and the IRS that this is our country and we're tired—tired of the pressure, tired of the political targeting, tired of a powerful central government that is crippling America," he said. He also said he was considering running for his old seat in Congress. Traficant signed a limited, three-month contract to work as a part-time weekend [[talk radio]] host for [[Cleveland]] news/talk station [[WTAM]] in January 2010. His contract permitted him to quit if he chose to run for office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2010/jan/05/traficant-lands-a-part-time-job-on-radio/?newswatch |title=Traficant lands a part-time job on radio |publisher=Vindy.com |date=2010-01-05 |accessdate=2013-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 2, 2009, a column by Traficant in the [[American Free Press]] continued his defense of the accused concentration camp guard John Demjanjuk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.adl.org/main_Extremism/jim_traficant_writes_afp_column.htm |title=Former Congressman Traficant to Contribute Column to Anti-Semitic Newspaper |publisher=[[Anti-Defamation League]] |date=November 2, 2009 |accessdate=October 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Collins Piper]] an AFP writer—who authored ''Target: Traficant, The Untold Story''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Piper |first1=Michael |authorlink=Michael Collins Piper |title=Target: Traficant: the outrageous inside story of how the Justice Department, the Israeli lobby and the American mass media conspired to set up and take down Congressman Jim Traficant |location=Washington, D.C.|publisher=[[American Free Press]] |year=2005 |isbn=0981808611}} {{ISBN|978-0981808611}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– previously defended Traficant against his accusers.

=== 2010 congressional campaign ===
In September 2010, Traficant was certified to run for the same seat he held before his expulsion, and said that his platform would be to repeal the [[Sixteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution]].&lt;ref name="sixteenth"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ohio.com/news/break_news/92681999.html|title=Traficant files petitions to be candidate for Akron congressional district|accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traficant lost the election to his former aide [[Tim Ryan (politician)|Tim Ryan]], to whom he lost an earlier race in 2002, in which Traficant ran as an independent from his prison cell.&lt;ref name="2010-election"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2002/11/07/us/the-2002-elections-midwest-ohio.html|title=The 2002 Elections: Midwest; Ohio|date=2002-11-07|work=The New York Times|accessdate=2013-05-20 | first1=Nichole M. | last1=Christian | first2=John H. | last2=Cushman Jr | first3=Sherri | last3=Day | first4=Sam | last4=Dillon | first5=Neil A. | last5=Lewis | first6=Robert | last6=Pear | first7=Terry | last7=Pristin | first8=Philip | last8=Shenon | first9=Jacques | last9=Steinberg &lt;!--exactly 9 authors--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traficant received 30,556 votes, or 16%.

== Post-prison life ==
After his release from prison, he was featured as a guest speaker at a [[Tea Party protests|Tea Party protest]] in [[Columbiana, Ohio]], among other events affiliated with [[right-wing politics|conservatism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.business-journal.com/default.asp?sourceid=&amp;smenu=1&amp;twindow=&amp;mad=&amp;sdetail=14598&amp;wpage=1&amp;skeyword=&amp;sidate=&amp;ccat=&amp;ccatm=&amp;restate=&amp;restatus=&amp;reoption=&amp;retype=&amp;repmin=&amp;repmax=&amp;rebed=&amp;rebath=&amp;subname=&amp;pform=&amp;sc=1711&amp;hn=business-journal&amp;he=.com|title=Traficant Draws Cheers at TEA Party|accessdate=September 16, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="afp"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1209/31066.html|title=Jim Traficant: 'I'm going to run'|accessdate=December 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traficant began a grassroots campaign in July 2014, "Project Freedom USA",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projectfreedomusa.com|title=Project Freedom USA|accessdate=September 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; to, among other things, put people pressure on Congress to get rid of the IRS and "divorce" the Federal Reserve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nuCeTfo-cac|title=Traficant launches Project Freedom|work=YouTube|accessdate=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Accident and death==
Traficant was injured in an accident at his farm on September 23, 2014. A tractor he was driving into a [[Pole building framing|pole barn]] flipped over and trapped him underneath. Traficant was taken to Salem Regional Medical Center in [[Salem, Ohio]], then airlifted to St. Elizabeth's Health Center in Youngstown. On the evening of September 24, his wife described him as "sedated and not doing well."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Sabina |last= Eaton |title= Ex. Rep.

By September 26, via news reports and statements from attorney and family spokesman Heidi Hanni, it was learned that the family was awaiting the doctors' assessment; there was no word as to whether or not Traficant had suffered a heart attack, but he was still unconscious and was being sedated for pain and other reasons. A number of longtime family friends, including Linda Kovachik, a former congressional aide to Traficant, told ''[[The Vindicator]]'' that it is believed Traficant had a heart attack, causing the tractor accident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vindy.com/news/2014/sep/27/traficant-remains-critical-respirator-re/|title=Youngstown News,  Former congressman no longer on respirator, still unconscious|work=Vindy.com|accessdate=September 28, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A text message was sent out Friday evening September 26 by Jim Condit Jr., the Constitution Party candidate for Ohio's 8th congressional district and a close friend who had been traveling with Traficant to help promote Project Freedom USA. The text message stated that "the machines were disconnected at 2:00 p.m. (Friday). He is still breathing. Thousands are praying."

'''John Leigh''' {{small|[[Chemical Society|FCS]]}} {{small|[[Member of the Royal College of Surgeons|MRCS]]}} (8 June 1812 – 11 November 1888) was a chemist and surgeon in [[Manchester]], England, who became that city's first appointed [[Medical Officer of Health]], having responsibility for [[public health]].

== Early life ==
John Leigh was born on 8 June 1812, probably at [[Foxdenton|Foxdenton Hall]] in [[Chadderton]] but possibly in [[Liverpool]]. His father, Thomas, was a [[pharmacist|druggist]] and tea-dealer from [[Ashton-under-Lyne]], whilst his mother, Hannah, came from [[Saddleworth]]. John said he was related to an ancient [[Cheshire]] family, the [[Egerton Leigh|Leighs of West Hall]], and thus also with the [[Earl of Bridgewater]], but doubt has been cast on these claims.{{sfn|Povey|2004|ps=}}

Leigh attended a school associated with [[Dukinfield Moravian Church]] and then pursued a career in medicine, being initially apprenticed to a doctor based in [[Ashbourne, Derbyshire]]. From 1831,{{sfn|Povey|2004|ps=}} he studied at [[Thomas Turner (surgeon)|Thomas Turner's]] Pine Street medical school in Manchester and at [[Guy's Hospital]], [[London]], as well as working for a period as a clerk at the [[Manchester Royal Infirmary|Manchester Infirmary]].&lt;!--please don't change this pipe: the MRI was not Royal until later--&gt; Possessed of much ability, Leigh was training other medical students and successfully proposing them for their professional qualifications before achieving his own qualification as a [[Member of the Royal College of Surgeons]].{{efn|Leigh held the licence of the [[Society of Apothecaries]] from 1834 or earlier and became MRCS in 1837.{{sfn|Povey|2004|ps=}}}}  After qualifying, he had an extensive private medical practice in Manchester until 1868 and worked as a resident medical officer at the Infirmary. He also held chairs in chemistry and [[forensic medicine]] at the Pine Street school and also at one located on Marsden Street in the city, which eventually amalgamated to form the [[Manchester Royal School of Medicine]].{{sfnp|Kargon|1977|pp=66-67|ps=}}{{sfnp|BMJ|1888|ps=}} He was also a registrar for births and deaths at this time.{{sfn|Povey|2004|ps=}}

== Chemist ==
Manchester was one of the first towns to use [[coal gas]] extensively{{sfnp|Kargon|1977|pp=67-69|ps=}} and Leigh, who became a fellow of the [[Chemical Society]],{{sfn|Povey|2004|ps=}} was employed as a chemical analyst by the municipally-owned [[Manchester Gas Works]], perhaps beginning in 1837. Manufacture of coal gas was not a trivial undertaking, requiring analysis of the raw material and of methods of chemical purification and extraction. The purpose of Leigh's work was to enable production of a high-quality gas suitable for use in illumination and to prevent emission of noxious fumes and by-products. He developed a considerable expertise, presenting papers on the subject of gas analysis to learned societies such as the [[British Association]] and, in 1863, patenting a process for the extraction of [[benzole]] from coal gas.{{sfnp|Kargon|1977|pp=67-69|ps=}}

== Interest in public health ==
The professional interest in gas analysis, prior experiences at the Manchester Infirmary, where he often saw damaged lungs, and the publication of [[Edwin Chadwick|Edwin Chadwick's]] ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' in 1842 caused Leigh to take an interest in public health matters. From the 1840s, he proposed that the high incidence of [[respiratory disease]] in Manchester, compared to other areas of England, was due to the city's poor [[air pollution|air quality]] and that this was largely attributable to the extensive use of coal as fuel in what was the first industrial city.{{sfnp|Kargon|1977|p=69|ps=}} [[Charles James Napier]] had described Manchester as "the chimney of the world" in 1839{{sfnp|Mosley|2013|p=21|ps=}} and a near-contemporary study of deaths in the city between 1840-42 blamed "diseases of the windpipe and chest" as the major causes, accounting for nearly 30 per cent of all fatalities and blaming the smoke-filled air in particular for poor health among children.{{sfnp|Mosley|2013|p=90|ps=}}{{efn|In [[Ancoats]], which was a particularly unpleasant area of the city to live, the average age at death in 1842 was 14 years.{{sfnp|Roberts|1993|ps=}}}} Leigh believed that the level of harmful particulates in the air needed to be reduced and he also thought it necessary to ensure better-quality food and better ventilation of homes.{{sfnp|Kargon|1977|pp=70-73|ps=}} The tendency of city officials throughout the century was to rely on the goodwill of manufacturers to achieve improvements in air quality rather than the blunt instrument of prosecution.{{sfnp|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|ps=}}

Although Leigh did not subscribe to a commonly held belief that smoke from burning coal had purifying properties, he did generally appear to accept the popular [[miasma theory]] as an explanation for transmission of diseases. The theory was that bad smells from rotting organic matter, excrement and similar were the cause of transmission, rather than the [[microbes]] that found a breeding-ground in such an environment. While [[germ theory]] was gaining ground as an alternate proposition, Leigh did not mention it in any of his annual reports until 1887 and even on that occasion he qualified his support.{{sfnp|Mosley|2013|pp=77-78|ps=}} Leigh's position was not uncommon: during the period that he was active in civic life, policy both nationally and locally was influenced more by the miasma theory than germ theory and so concentrated more on matters relating to sanitation than, say, [[immunisation]]. It was the era of the [[Health of Towns Association]], the first [[Local board of health|local boards of health]] and the reformist bodies such as the [[Manchester and Salford Sanitary Association]] and the [[Manchester Statistical Society]], although the city elders of Manchester - a "self-perpetuating inner circle of big merchants, manufacturers and landlords", according to Platt{{sfnp|Platt|2005|p=210|ps=}} - had been reluctant to accept early government initiatives such as the 1848 Public Health Act.{{sfnp|Ashton|Ubido|1991|ps=}}{{sfnp|Platt|2005|p=209|ps=}}{{sfnp|Pickstone|1987|ps=}}{{efn|The councillors considered such national legislation to be centrist, interfering and addressing issues that they were already dealing with.{{sfnp|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|ps=}}}} [[Robert Rawlinson]], a noted sanitarian and engineer of the time, described how public policy in Manchester had affected the city's rivers by the 1840s: {{quote|a semi-liquid compound is formed, an accurate idea of which no writen description can convey. A thick scum coats the surface [of the rivers], upon and over which birds can walk; the putrid carcasses of dead animals, dogs, cats, etc. float and rot in the midst; fermentation takes place rapidly, as large bubbles of gas may be seen escaping, and a thick vapour hangs over the entire area.{{sfnp|Platt|2005|p=209|ps=}}}}

Leigh became recognised locally as an expert in matters relating to chemistry as applicable to civic administration. His ability to analyse manufacturing processes caused him to be consulted by the council when they were attempting to educate industrialists and enforce smoke abatement measures.{{sfnp|Kargon|1977|pp=70-73|ps=}}{{sfnp|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|ps=}} In 1850, he co-authored ''A History of the Cholera in Manchester in 1849'', the aims of which have been described by Robert Kargon, a historian of science, as "nothing less than the scientific assessment of disease and the public health measures taken against it." To that end, he not merely attempted to document the outbreak of [[cholera]] itself but also the environmental context in which it occurred. He attempted to map the progress of the disease from one area to another and he tested various theories of probable cause. After rejecting suggestions that the cause may have lain in, for example, a deficiency of "atmospheric electricity" or the amount of [[ozone]] in the air, the conclusions drawn were that the outbreak had been mostly restricted to areas where the standards of sanitation were particularly poor, although it was at pains to point out that those standards existed both before and after the outbreak and thus could not in themselves have caused it. While movement of infected people from one place to another seemed to explain how the disease was introduced from affected areas to previously unaffected locations, often at a relatively large distance, the study suggested that direct contact with a carrier was not necessary for propagation. Kargon quotes from the study:{{sfnp|Kargon|1977|pp=70-73|ps=}}

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;whatever may have been observed in other parts of England, it is proveable then, that Cholera has almost entirely confined its ravages to those localities or particular streets in which noxious exhalations proceeding from putrifying or otherwise decomposing matters in rivers, canals, stagnant water, etc. prevail; in which the inhabitants breathe a polluted air, arising from bad drainage, overcrowding, and bad ventilation, whose employment is precarious and not very remunerative, and whose means, therefore, are insufficient to procure a necessary amount of suitable and nutritious food.{{sfnp|Gardiner|Leigh|1850|p=15|ps=}}}}

In 1859, Leigh was a member of a [[Nuisance in English law|Nuisance Committee]] that examined air pollution caused by manufacturers in the [[Ardwick]] area and which was considered to have had success in improving the situation.{{sfnp|Kargon|1977|p=73|ps=}}{{efn|The [[Court Leet]] and the Police Commissioners were involved in attempts to control the effects of smoke until around the time of Manchester's incorporation in 1838 but, according to Bowler and Brimblecombe, "The interconnection between the local government and the business elite of Manchester resulted in vested interests which weakened local commitment to smoke abatement measures." A new form of Nuisance Committee, based on a model previously used by the Commissioners, was established by the council in 1843.{{sfnp|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|ps=}}}} All of these various efforts, and more, garnered Leigh a reputation for an investigative, analytical mind and an expertise in medicine and chemistry. They qualified him for appointment as Manchester's first Medical Officer of Health,{{efn|[[Leicester]] appointed the first Medical Officer of Health in England in 1846, Liverpool appointed one in 1847; Manchester was considered to be negligent in not doing so until 1868. The 1872 Public Health Act made such posts compulsory.{{sfnp|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|ps=}}}} responsible for matters relating to public health, but an initial proposal to that effect by the city council's General Purposes committee in 1867 was challenged by in general council discussion. A subsequent formal recruitment process led by another committee resulted in a recommendation in March 1868 to appoint a different applicant but the [[alderman|aldermen]] over-ruled again, this time preferring Leigh to the proposed candidate.{{sfnp|Kargon|1977|p=73|ps=}}{{sfnp|Manchester Guardian|1868|p=6|ps=}} Kargon believes that Leigh's abilities and reputation as a scientist, in particular, were thought to be superior and carried the day{{sfnp|Kargon|1977|p=73|ps=}} but Harry L. Platt says that the aldermen were intent on minimising the cost of local government and that Leigh's appointment on a part-time basis was preferred because, as an existing employee, it would entail no additional salary.{{efn|A contemporary newspaper report of the council discussion stipulates a salary of £500 per annum.{{sfnp|Manchester Guardian|1868|p=6|ps=}}}} He says that a series of increasingly disastrous floods of the rivers [[Irk]], [[River Irwell|Irwell]] and [[River Medlock|Medlock]] from the 1840s had resulted in large part from the council's unwillingness to charge the public purse in the cause of  environmental improvements and that, after the floods of 1866, their hand was forced in large part because of the increased concern of death from cholera.{{sfnp|Platt|2005|pp=210-216|ps=}} Fear of epidemic and reaction to emergencies were, according to the historian Anthony Wohl, the cause of rebalancing an official mindset that was general based on "corruption, lethargy, innate conservatism&amp;nbsp;... and parsimony."{{sfnp|Wohl|1983|ps=}}

== Medical Officer for Health ==
Platt describes Leigh as being "compliant" but not uncritical of the city that employed him.{{sfnp|Platt|2005|p=217|ps=}} Although Manchester was considered to be a leader in efforts relating to smoke abatement, often acting in advance of national legislative measures, Leigh's reports as Medical Officer for Health were unremitting in their criticism of air quality. He drew attention to and demanded vigorous action against smoke and other emissions, which he noted caused not only respiratory disease but also, for example, limited the impact of sunlight and thus exacerbated [[rickets]] and [[Depression (mood)|depression]]. Despite a zealous personal desire for eradication and the emergence between 1870-1888 of a range of pressure groups in Manchester that sought abatement of emissions, the official belief throughout the century was that the nuisance was in fact being reduced. Leigh's 1883 report supported this in noting a visible reduction in smoke density resulting from greater regulation and the deployment of more inspectors, although quantitative measurements were rare and the belief of success was thus mostly subjective. Bowler and Brimblecombe say that, despite the history of progressive efforts by the civic authorities on this issue, abatement measures could not keep up with the rapid development of the town, whose industrial expansion had continued apace and whose population had grown from 70,000 to 243,000 between 1801-1841 alone. There was little scientific monitoring of smoke levels.{{sfnp|Bowler|Brimblecombe|2000|ps=}}

Leigh also supported the promotion of [[public bath]]s, believing like many of his contemporary social reformers, that if people had the opportunity to improve their cleanliness then that would in turn aid improvement of their moral and social behaviour.{{sfnp|Parker|2000|ps=}}

== Other interests ==
Leigh held other scientific interests, notably in [[botany]] and [[geology]], and both shared and developed these in his close friendship with [[Edward William Binney]] and with other prominent members of the [[Manchester Literary and Philosophical Society]], such as [[John Davies (lecturer)|John Davies]], [[James Prescott Joule]] and [[William Sturgeon]].{{sfnp|Kargon|1977|pp=39-40, 61, 67|ps=}} He also published a volume of poetry, ''Sir Percy Legh: a legend of Lyme, and other ballads'', in 1861,{{sfnp|Reilly|1999|p=272|ps=}} and wrote ''Lays and Legends of Cheshire''.{{sfnp|BMJ|1888|ps=}}

== Death ==
Leigh was still the incumbent Medical Officer at the time of his death from [[cardiac disease]] at his home in [[Hale Barns]], [[Cheshire]], on 11 November 1888. He was buried nearby, at [[Timperley]], four days later. He had moved to the Manchester suburb of [[Whalley Range, Manchester|Whalley Range]] upon being appointed Medical Officer in 1868 and then relocated to a purpose-built [[Mock Tudor|Tudor-style]] Cheshire mansion, which was called the Manor House, in 1879.{{sfn|Povey|2004|ps=}}{{efn|The Manor House no longer exists. It was bombed in 1941, during [[World War II]], and Holy Angels Catholic Church was built on the site in the 1940s.{{sfn|Fleming|1996|p=8|ps=}}}}

A first marriage, to Marianne Goodwin on 29 August 1840, ended with his wife's death in 1847; he then married Elizabeth Collier on 11 October 1848 and she survived until 1891. He had a son and a daughter from his first marriage, and a further two daughters and three sons from his second. One son predeceased him and it seems that the surviving male children were excluded from his will.{{sfn|Povey|2004|ps=}}

'''Kaichi Hirate''' was a Japanese soldier. He was a Captain in the [[Japanese Imperial Army]] and during [[World War II]] was Camp Commander of the First Branch Camp at [[Hakkokate]]. In 1946, charged with mistreatment of [[prisoners of war]], he was tried by the [[International Military Tribunal for the Far East]] at [[Yokohama]]. He was found guilty, sentenced to death, and hanged.&lt;ref&gt;Stella Lee Researcher, U.C.

{{nihongo|'''Kenji Nagai'''|長井 健司|Nagai Kenji|August 27, 1957 &amp;ndash; September 27, 2007}} was a [[Japan]]ese [[Photojournalism|photojournalist]] who took many assignments to conflict zones and dangerous areas around the world.

He was shot dead in Myanmar (also known as Burma) during the [[Saffron Revolution]]. Nagai continued to take photos as he lay wounded on the ground, later dying from [[Ballistic trauma|gunshot injuries]] to the chest.  He was the only foreign national killed in the protests.&lt;ref name="AFP"&gt;{{cite news

== Background ==
Kenji Nagai grew up in [[Imabari, Ehime]], Japan, and graduated from Imabari Nishi High School.  Nagai attended [[Tokyo Keizai University]] ([[:ja:東京経済大学|東京経済大学]]), and after graduation he studied abroad in the [[United States]] for a year.  After his return to Japan, Nagai held a part-time job before embarking upon his career as a [[Freelancer|freelance]] [[journalist]].&lt;ref name="DYO"&gt;{{cite news

Nagai arrived in Myanmar two days before the government began attacking [[Bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] protesting against the [[military junta]]&lt;ref name="AFP" /&gt; that has ruled the country since deposing the democratic government in a [[Post-independence Burma, 1948-1962|1962 coup d'état]].&lt;ref name="AP1"&gt;{{cite news

== Death ==
Nagai had been in Myanmar covering the anti-government protests since Tuesday, September 25.&lt;ref name="AP3" /&gt; On Thursday, September 27, Nagai was photographing the protests near the [[Shangri-La Hotels and Resorts|Traders Hotel]], a few blocks away from the [[Sule Pagoda]] in downtown Yangon, when soldiers opened fire on demonstrators, killing Nagai and reportedly injuring another foreign journalist.&lt;ref name="RWB"&gt;{{cite press release

Reports initially stated that Nagai was hit by stray bullets fired by soldiers or possibly shot from the front.&lt;ref name="CP" /&gt; The "stray bullet" explanation was proposed by the [[Politics of Myanmar|government of Myanmar]] as an explanation for Nagai's death. However, video footage obtained by Japanese television appears to show a [[Myanmar Armed Forces|Burmese soldier]] shoving Nagai to the ground and shooting him at [[point-blank range]].&lt;ref name="Times Online"&gt;{{cite news

This photograph appeared on the front page of ''[[The New York Times]]'' on September 28, 2007. A subsequent shot showed Nagai's body sprawled in the street as the soldier walked away. Judging from the patch, the soldier responsible is believed to be from one of the [[Myanmar Army#Light Infantry Divisions .28LID.29|Light Infantry Divisions]] (possibly LID 66) in charge of crowd control in [[Yangon]] at the time of protests.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}} At the Japanese embassy in Myanmar, a physician established the trajectory of the fatal bullet that killed Nagai, determining that the bullet entered Nagai's chest from the lower right side and pierced his heart before exiting from his back.&lt;ref name="Times Online" /&gt;

On October 8, new footage showing how a Burmese soldier apparently confiscating a fallen Nagai's video camera was revealed on a Japanese news show.&lt;ref name="JNR1009"&gt;{{cite news

=== Response ===
[[Reporters Without Borders]] condemned the killing of Nagai, noting that Nagai was carrying a camera in his hand when he was shot, identifying him as a journalist.  The director of the RWB's [[Washington, D.C.]] branch, Lucie Morillon, said that Nagai was "left to die in the street."&lt;ref name="NYP"&gt;{{cite news

Japanese Prime Minister [[Yasuo Fukuda]] bemoaned Nagai's death as "extremely unfortunate" and Chief Cabinet Secretary [[Nobutaka Machimura]] offered his prayers and condolences.&lt;ref name="CP" /&gt;  Machimura said: "We strongly protest the Myanmar government and demand an investigation (into the death). We demand (Myanmar)  take appropriate steps to ensure the safety of the Japanese citizens in that country."&lt;ref name="AP3"&gt;{{cite news

According to Kōmura, U.S. Secretary of State [[Condoleezza Rice]] told him that the "international community cannot allow peaceful protesters to be killed and injured".&lt;ref name="AP3" /&gt;  On September 28, Masahiko Kōmura lodged a protest over the killing of Nagai when he met with Myanmar's Foreign Minister [[Nyan Win]] at the [[United Nations Headquarters]].  In the meeting, Nyan Win apologized for Nagai's death. Yabunaka Mitoji, Deputy Minister for Japanese Foreign Affairs, left for Myanmar on September 30.&lt;ref name="MDN0930"&gt;{{cite news

Although Nyan Win officially apologized, an October 13 article locally published in the government-owned ''Mirror'' newspaper offered a different view of the events. It claimed that Nagai had entered the country using a tourist visa instead of proper journalist visa and faulted the cameraman for failing to get a permit to cover the news inside Myanmar. It emphasized that the event occurred at the time of martial law being imposed and the soldiers could not differentiate between a Burmese citizen and a Japanese because of the resemblance in Asian looks.&lt;!--This entire paragraph sounds very much like a paraphrasing, at great length (and with extremely poor grammar and spelling), of Myanmar government propaganda. Also, because he appeared to be Burmese, that means it was okay to simply kick a cameraman documenting the scene for the world to the ground and shoot him in the heart?--&gt;&lt;ref name="Mirror"&gt;{{cite news

"The Group Protesting the Murder of Mr. Nagai by the Army of Myanmar" was founded by Japanese journalists, intellectuals and celebrities in order to protest Nagai's killing and petition for the return of his camera and tape.  By November 2007 the group collected 20,000 signatures, primarily in Japan.  On November 26, 2007, the group posted an English version of the letter on their website and started collecting signatures internationally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

The [[Burma Media Association]] established an award in Nagai's memory. The award aims to recognize individuals who have reported the truth about Myanmar. The first award, in 2009, was presented to Eint Khaing Oo, a Burmese female journalist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Myanmar woman to get Nagai award|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2009/02/15/national/myanmar-woman-to-get-nagai-award/|publisher=[[Kyodo News]]|date=February 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lady Mary Butler''' (1689 – 2 January 1713) was the second daughter of the [[James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde|2nd Duke of Ormonde]] and maternally a granddaughter of the [[Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort|1st Duke of Beaufort]]. She was born at [[Kilkenny Castle]] in [[Ireland]]. She married [[John Ashburnham, 1st Earl of Ashburnham|John, 3rd Baron Ashburnham]], on 21 October 1710, and died two years later in childbirth. She was [[Jonathan Swift]]’s "greatest favourite"; he wrote "I am in excessive concern for her death, I hardly knew a more valuable person on all accounts."

The nature of the [[neighborhood]] in which a person resides affects the set of lifestyles available to that person due to differences between various neighborhoods' degrees of affluence and proximity to natural and cultural environments&lt;ref&gt;Haenfler, R., Johnson, B., &amp; Jones, E. 2012 Lifestyle Movements: Exploring the Intersection of Lifestyle and Social Movements. Social Movement Studies, 11(1), 1-20.&lt;/ref&gt;. For example, in areas within a close proximity to the sea, a [[surf culture]] or lifestyle can often be present.

==Individual identity==
A lifestyle typically reflects an individual's attitudes, way of life, values, or [[world view]]. Therefore, a lifestyle is a means of forging a sense of [[Self-concept|self]] and to create cultural [[symbol]]s that resonate with personal identity&lt;ref&gt;Cherry, E., 2015. I was a teenage vegan: motivation and maintenance of lifestyle movements. Sociological Inquiry, 85(1), pp.55-74.&lt;/ref&gt;. Not all aspects of a lifestyle are voluntary. Surrounding social and technical systems can constrain the lifestyle choices available to the individual and the symbols she/he is able to project to others and the self.&lt;ref&gt;Spaargaren, G., and B. VanVliet (2000) "Lifestyle, Consumption and the Environment:  The Ecological Modernisation of Domestic Consumption", ''Environmental Politics'' 9(1): 50-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

The lines between personal identity and the everyday doings that signal a particular lifestyle become blurred in modern society.&lt;ref&gt;Giddens, A. (1991) ''Modernity and self-identity: self and society in the late modern age'', Cambridge: [[Polity Press]]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, "[[green lifestyle]]" means holding beliefs and engaging in activities that consume fewer resources and produce less harmful waste (i.e. a smaller [[ecological footprint]]), and deriving a sense of self from holding these beliefs and engaging in these activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Lynn R. Kahle, Eda Gurel-Atay, Eds|title=Communicating Sustainability for the Green Economy|year=2014|location=New York|publisher=M.E. Sharpe|isbn=978-0-7656-3680-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some commentators argue that, in [[modernity]], the cornerstone of lifestyle construction is consumption behavior, which offers the possibility to create and further individualize the self with different products or services that signal different ways of life.&lt;ref&gt;Ropke, I. (1999) "The Dynamics of Willingness to Consume", [[Ecological Economics (journal)|Ecological Economics]] 28: 399-420.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lifestyle may include views on politics, religion, health, intimacy, and more. All of these aspects play a role in shaping someone's lifestyle.
&lt;ref&gt;Giuffrâe, K., &amp; DiGeronimo, T. (1999) ''Care and Feeding of Your Brain : How Diet and Environment Affect What You Think and Feel'', Career Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
In the [[magazine]] and [[television]] industries, "lifestyle" is used to describe a category of publications or programs.

==History of lifestyles studies==

Three main phases can be identified in the history of lifestyles studies:&lt;ref&gt;Berzano L., Genova C., Lifestyles and Subcultures. History and a New Perspective, Routledge, London, 2015 (Part I).&lt;/ref&gt;

;Lifestyles and social position: Earlier studies on lifestyles focus on the analysis of social structure and of the individuals’ relative positions inside it. [[Thorstein Veblen]], with his ‘emulation’ concept, opens this perspective by asserting that people adopt specific ‘schemes of life’, and in particular specific patterns of ‘conspicuous consumption’, depending on a desire for distinction from social strata they identify as inferior and a desire for emulation of the ones identified as superior. [[Max Weber]] intends lifestyles as distinctive elements of status groups strictly  connected with a dialectic of recognition of prestige: the lifestyle is the most visible manifestation of social differentiation, even within the same social class, and in particular it shows the prestige which the individuals believe they enjoy or to which they aspire. [[Georg Simmel]] carries out formal analysis of lifestyles, at the heart of which can be found processes of individualisation, identification, differentiation, and recognition, understood both as generating processes of, and effects generated by, lifestyles, operating “vertically” as well as “horizontally”. Finally, [[Pierre Bourdieu]] renews this approach within a more complex model in which lifestyles, made up mainly of social practices and closely tied to individual tastes, represent the basic point of intersection between the structure of the field and processes connected with the habitus.

;Lifestyles as styles of thought: The approach interpreting lifestyles as principally styles of thought has its roots in the soil of psychological analysis. Initially, starting with [[Alfred Adler]], a lifestyle was understood as a style of personality, in the sense that the framework of guiding values and principles which individuals develop in the first years of life end up defining a system of judgement which informs their actions throughout their lives. Later, particularly in [[Milton Rokeach]]’s work, [[Arnold Mitchell]]’s VALS research and [[Lynn Kahle]]’s LOV research, lifestyles’ analysis developed as profiles of values, reaching the hypothesis that it is possible to identify various models of scales of values organized hierarchically, to which different population sectors correspond. Then with [[Daniel Yankelovich]] and [[William Wells (social scientist)|William Wells]] we move on to the so-called AIO approach in which attitudes, interests and opinions are considered as fundamental lifestyles’ components, being analysed from both synchronic and diachronic points of view and interpreted on the basis of socio-cultural trends in a given social context (as, for instance, in [[Bernard Cathelat]]’s work). Finally, a further development leads to the so-called profiles-and-trends approach, at the core of which is an analysis of the relations between mental and behavioural variables, bearing in mind that socio-cultural trends influence both the diffusion of various lifestyles within a population and the emerging of different modalities of interaction between thought and action.

;Lifestyles as styles of action: Analysis of lifestyles as action profiles is characterized by the fact that it no longer considers the action level as a simple derivative of lifestyles, or at least as their collateral component, but rather as a constitutive element. In the beginning, this perspective focussed mainly on consumer behaviour, seeing products acquired as objects expressing on the material plane individuals’ self-image and how they view their position in society. Subsequently, the perspective broadened to focus more generally on the level of daily life, concentrating – as in authors such as [[Joffre Dumazedier]] and [[Anthony Giddens]] – on the use of time, especially loisirs, and trying to study the interaction between the active dimension of choice and the dimension of routine and structuration which characterize that level of action. Finally, some authors, for instance [[Richard Jenkins]] and [[A. J. Veal]], suggested an approach to lifestyles in which it is not everyday actions which make up the plane of analysis but those which the actors who adopt them consider particularly meaningful and distinctive.

==Health==

A healthy or unhealthy lifestyle will most likely be transmitted across generations. According to the study done by Case et al. (2002), when a 0-3 year old child has a mother who practices a healthy lifestyle, this child will be 27% more likely to become healthy and adopt the same lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;Ponthiere G. (2011) "Mortality, Family and Lifestyles", ''Journal of Family and Economic Issues'' 32 (2): 175-190&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, high income parents are more likely to eat organic food, have time to exercise, and provide the best living condition to their children. On the other hand, low income parents are more likely to participate in unhealthy activities such as smoking to help them release poverty-related stress and depression.&lt;ref&gt;Case, A., Lubotsky D. &amp; Paxson C. (2002) "Economic Status and Health in Childhood: The Origins of the Gradient", [[The American Economic Review]] 92(5): 1308-1334&lt;/ref&gt; Parents are the first teacher for every child. Everything that parents do will be very likely transferred to their children through the learning process.

Adults may be drawn together by mutual interest that results in a lifestyle. For example, [[William Dufty]] described how pursuing a sugar-free diet led to such associations:&lt;ref&gt;[[William Dufty]] (1975) [[Sugar Blues]], page 204&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{quotation| I have come to know hundreds of young people who have found that illness or bingeing on drugs and sugar became the doorway to health. Once they reestablished their own health, we had in common our interest in food. If one can use that overworked word lifestyle, we shared a sugarfree lifestyle. I kept in touch with many of them in campuses and communes, through their travels here and abroad and everywhere. One day you meet them in Boston. The next week you run into them in Southern California.}}

==Class==
Lifestyle research can contribute to the question of the relevance of the class concept.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Bögenhold|first=Dieter|title=Social Inequality and the Sociology of Life Style: Material and Cultural Aspects of Social Stratification|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1536-7150.00125/abstract|publisher=American Journal of Economics and Sociology|accessdate=26 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Media culture==
The term '''lifestyle''' was introduced in the 1950s as a derivative of that of [[Style (aesthetics)|style in art]]:&lt;ref name="Bernstein1991p23Diversity"&gt;Bernstein (1991) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lTo8YrSbIbQC&amp;pg=PA23&amp;lpg=PA23 p.23]&lt;/ref&gt;
: {{quotation|"Life-styles", the culture industry’s recycling of style in art, represent the transformation of an aesthetic category, which once possessed a moment of negativity [shocking, emancipatory], into a quality of commodity consumption.|sign=|source=}}

[[Theodor W. Adorno]] noted that there is a "culture industry" in which the [[mass media]] is involved, but that the term "mass culture" is inappropriate:
&lt;ref name="Adorno1963mass"&gt;Adorno [1963] [https://books.google.com/books?id=lTo8YrSbIbQC&amp;pg=PA98&amp;lpg=PA98 p.98]&lt;/ref&gt; 
:{{quotation|In our drafts, we spoke of "mass culture." We replaced that expression with "culture industry" in order to exclude from the outset the interpretation agreeable to its advocates: that it is a matter of something like a culture that arises spontaneously from the masses themselves, the contemporary form of popular art.}}

The [[media culture]] of [[advanced capitalism]] typically creates new "life-styles" to drive the consumption of new commodities:&lt;ref name="Bernstein1991p23Diversity"/&gt;{{quotation|Diversity is more effectively present in mass media than previously, but this is not an obvious or unequivocal gain. By the late 1950s, the homogenization of consciousness had become counterproductive for the purposes of capital expansion; new needs for new commodities had to be created, and this required the reintroduction of the minimal negativity that had been previously eliminated. The cult of the new that had been the prerogative of art throughout the modernist epoch into the period of post-war unification and stabilization has returned to capital expansion from which it originally sprang. But this negativity is neither shocking nor emancipatory since it does not presage a transformation of the fundamental structures of everyday life. On the contrary, through the culture industry capital has co-opted the dynamics of negation both diachronically in its restless production of new and "different" commodities and synchronically in its promotion of alternative "life-styles."}}

'''Malnutrition''' continues to be a problem in the Republic of [[South Africa]], although it is not as endemic as in other countries of [[Sub-Saharan Africa]].

15% of South African infants are born with a low birth weight.&lt;ref name="Nutrition at a Glance: South Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Nutrition at a Glance: South Africa|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/NUTRITION/Resources/281846-1271963823772/southafrica.pdf|publisher=The World Bank}}&lt;/ref&gt;  5% of South African children are so underweight they are considered to be wasted.&lt;ref name="Nutrition at a Glance: South Africa" /&gt; Since the 1990s South Africa's malnutrition problem has remained fairly stable.&lt;ref name="Nutrition at a Glance: South Africa" /&gt; It is estimated that South Africa loses about US$1.1 billion every year in GDP to vitamin and mineral deficiencies arising from malnutrition, although it would only cost an estimated US$55 million to alleviate this problem through micronutrient nutrition interventions.&lt;ref name="Nutrition at a Glance: South Africa" /&gt;

The prevalence of '''malnutrition in South Africa''' varies across different geographical areas and socio-economic groups.&lt;ref name="Nutrition at a Glance: South Africa" /&gt; Many infants in Africa suffer from malnutrition because their mothers do not breastfeed them. The mothers in South Africa that do not breast feed their children do not do it mainly to try to avoid the possibility that in doing so, their children may contract [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding by HIV-1-infected women and outcome in their infants: a cohort study from Durban, South Africa "&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bobat|first=Raziya|author2=Moodley, ohayendree |author3=Coutsoudis, Anna |author4= Coovadia, Hoosen |title=Breastfeeding by HIV-1-infected women and outcome in their infants: a cohort study from Durban, South Africa|journal=AIDS|date=11 November 1997|volume=11|issue=13|pages=1627–1633|url=http://journals.lww.com/aidsonline/Fulltext/1997/13000/Breastfeeding_by_HIV_1_infected_women_and_outcome.12.aspx|doi=10.1097/00002030-199713000-00012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2010 [[Department of Health (South Africa)|South Africa Department of Health]] Study found that 30.2% of pregnant women in South Africa have AIDS.&lt;ref name="South Africa HIV &amp; AIDS Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa HIV &amp; AIDS Statistics|url=http://www.avert.org/south-africa-hiv-aids-statistics.htm|publisher=Avert: International HIV &amp; AIDS Charity|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Malnutrition can cause several different health problems, such as [[pellagra]].&lt;ref name="Malnutrition in South Africa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Impressions ofhealth in the new South Africa: a period of convalescence" /&gt;

The specific consequences of malnutrition vary depending on the individual and the specific nutrients the individual's diet is lacking. South Africa's Department of Health has established various special programs and initiatives, like the Integrated Nutrition Program, to combat the detrimental effects of malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Combating Malnutrition in South Africa" &gt;{{cite news|title=Combating Malnutrition in South Africa|url=https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=http:%2F%2Fwww.dbsa.org%2FResearch%2FDocuments%2FSouth%2520Africa%2520Nutrition_%2520input%2520paper_roadmap.pdf)&amp;oq=http:%2F%2Fwww.dbsa.org%2FResearch%2FDocuments%2FSouth%2520Africa%2520Nutrition_%2520input%2520paper_roadmap.pdf)&amp;gs_l=hp.3...3936.3936.0.5425.1.1.0.0.0.0.70.70.1.1.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.2.fI12OIdQAKg&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=a82d8ac0e00dcd3d&amp;bpcl=39650382&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=598|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=Input Paper for Health Roadmap|date=September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; All programs and initiatives have faced copious challenges and their individual success rates vastly vary as a result.

==Health effects==
Malnutrition can lead to an onslaught of additional health [[Complication (medicine)|complication]]s,&lt;ref name="The Right to Food in Theory and Practice" /&gt; and eventually even death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gomez|first=Federico|author2=Rafael Ramos Galvan |author3=Silvestre Frenk |author4=Joaquin Cravioto Munoz |author5=Raquel Chavez |author6=Judith Vasquez |title=Mortality in Second And Third Degree Malnutrition|journal=Journal of Tropical Pediatrics|year=1956|volume=2|issue=2|pages=77–83|url=http://tropej.oxfordjournals.org/content/2/2/77.extract#|doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.tropej.a057419|pmc=2560616}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In fact, UNICEF found that 11.4% of deaths of South African children under five can be attributed to low weight, making low birth weight the second most prominent cause of children's death in South Africa.&lt;ref name="What Are the Leading Causes of Death Among South African Children?" /&gt; According to 2008 statistics, out of 10 million children's deaths, 5.6 million can somehow be attributed to malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Factors Contributing To Malnutrition In Children
0-60 Months Admitted To Hospitals In The Northern
Cape"/&gt; Although all cases of malnutrition in South Africa will not necessarily lead to death, they will most likely lead to a decline in health. The most easily preventable yet most prominent detrimental health conditions associated with malnutrition are [[nutrient deficiencies]].&lt;ref name="The Right to Food in Theory and Practice" /&gt;

=== Vitamin and mineral deficiencies ===
A deficiency in [[iron]] levels can lead to [[anemia]], which is a condition classified by decreased [[hemoglobin]] levels in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute|title=What Is Anemia?|url=http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/health-topics/topics/anemia/|publisher=National Institutes of Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21.4% of pre-school children have anemia in South Africa.&lt;ref name="Malnutrition in South Africa" /&gt; Anemia is also a major cause of maternal mortality.&lt;ref name="The Right to Food in Theory and Practice" /&gt; Approximately 50% of pregnant women in South Africa have anemia.&lt;ref name="Malnutrition in South Africa"&gt;{{cite web|title=Malnutrition in South Africa|url=http://myfundi.co.za/e/Malnutrition_in_South_Africa|accessdate=10 December 2012}}{{dead link|date=March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anemia causes tiredness and weakness. If left untreated for long periods of time, it can damage the heart, brain, and other vital organs.&lt;ref name="Malnutrition in South Africa" /&gt;

Another common nutritional problem among South Africans is [[hypocalcemia]], a deficiency in [[calcium]]. In a study of a randomly chosen rural South African community, 13.2% of children were found to have abnormally low levels of calcium in their blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettifor|first=J. M.|author2=P Ross |author3=G Moodley |author4=E Shuenyane |title=Calcium Deficiency In Rural Black Children in South Africa--a Comparison Between Rural and Urban Communities|journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]|date=December 1979|volume=32|issue=12|pages=2477–2483|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/32/12/2477.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional studies done on South African children show that this deficiency can lead to [[Rickets]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pettifor|first=JM|author2=Ross P |author3=Wang J |author4=Moodley G |author5=Couper-Smith J |title=Rickets in Children of Rural Origin in South Africa: is Low Dietart Calcium a Factor?|journal=Journal of Pediatrics|year=1978|volume=92|pages=320–324|doi=10.1016/s0022-3476(78)80035-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rickets causes weakness and pain in bones and dental structures, impaired growth, muscle cramps, and skeletal deformities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kaneshiro|first=Neil K.|title=Rickets Osteomalacia in children; Vitamin D Deficiency; Renal Rickets; Hepatic Rickets|publisher=Pub Med Health|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmedhealth/PMH0001384/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many South Africans also have a [[Thiamine]] ([[Vitamin B1]]) deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vorvick|first=Linda J.|title=Beriberi|url=http://health.nytimes.com/health/guides/disease/beriberi/overview.html|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=10 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A serious deficiency in this vital nutrient can cause [[beriberi]], which has the immediate symptom of severe [[fatigue (medical)|lethargy]]. If left untreated, Beriberi can cause inflammation of the [[nervous system]] and even [[heart failure]].

Another disease common to South Africa is [[pellagra]].

An additional malnutrition problem is a deficiency in [[vitamin A]]. It is especially prominent in the [[Northern Province, South Africa|Northern Province]], the [[KwaZulu]]/[[Natal (region)|Natal]],  the [[Mpumalanga]], the [[North West Province]], and the [[Eastern Cape]] of South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nutrition Information Centre University of Stellenbosch|title=Vitamin A|url=http://sun025.sun.ac.za/portal/page/portal/Health_Sciences/English/Centres%20and%20Institutions/Nicus/Nutrition_Facts_sheets/Vitamin%20A.pdf|accessdate=10 December 2012|newspaper=NICUS|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090711014515/http://sun025.sun.ac.za/portal/page/portal/Health_Sciences/English/Centres%20and%20Institutions/Nicus/Nutrition_Facts_sheets/Vitamin%20A.pdf#|archive-date=11 July 2009|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The South African Vitamin A Consultancy Group (SAVACG) conducted a national survey for the [[Department of Health (South Africa)|South African Department of Health]] that showed that one out of three children under the age of six have a Vitamin A deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faber|first=Mieke|author2=Wenhold, Friede|title=Nutrition in Contemporary South Africa|journal=Water SA|year=2007|volume=33|issue=3|pages=393–400|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/49122/35467}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vitamin A is necessary for good vision, and a shortage of this substance can lead to [[visual impairment]]s and potentially even [[blindness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=West Jr.|first=K.|title=Extent of Vitamin A Deficiency Among Preschool children and Women of Reproductive Age|journal=The Journal of Nutrition|date=1 September 2002|volume=132|issue=9|pages=2857S-2866S}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[World Health Organization]] showed that half of Vitamin A-deficient blind children die within the year, due to the detrimental effects of Vitamin A on the immune system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Micronutrient Deficiencies|url=http://www.who.int/nutrition/topics/vad/en//|publisher=World Health Organization|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vitamin C]] deficiency also has detrimental effects on the South African population.

==Causes==
An individual in South Africa may develop malnutrition because of several factors, not all of them necessarily having to do with diet. According to UNICEF, factors that can cause malnutrition include but are not limited to [[Stress (physiology)|stress]], [[psychological trauma|trauma]], poor psychological care, [[neglect]], and abuse.&lt;ref name="Factors Contributing To Malnutrition In Children
0-60 Months Admitted To Hospitals In The Northern
Cape"&gt;{{Cite thesis |type=M. Sc. |title=Factors Contributing To Malnutrition In Children 0-60 Months Admitted To Hospitals In The Northern Cape |url=http://etd.uovs.ac.za/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11192010-135204/unrestricted/DeLangeJC.pdf |author= |last=De Lange |first=Johanna Christina |year=2010 |publisher=University of the Free State |accessdate=4 December 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140726010112/http://etd.uovs.ac.za/ETD-db/theses/available/etd-11192010-135204/unrestricted/DeLangeJC.pdf# |archivedate=26 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a woman with [[mental disorder|psychological problems]] may not have the cognitive abilities to recognize that she needs to feed her children, and thus may neglect to do so, causing her children not to obtain the sufficient nutrients they need to thrive. However, even mothers with full cognitive abilities may still cause their children to suffer from malnutrition by not partaking in breastfeeding.

===Breastfeeding and HIV transmission avoidance===
{{main article|Breastfeeding by HIV infected mothers}}
[[Human breast milk|Breast milk]] contains many vital nutrients and minerals that protect against [[infant mortality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Heinig|first=Jane|title=Host Defense Benefits of Breastfeeding for the Infant : Effect of Breastfeeding Duration and Exclusivity|journal=Pediatric Clinics of North America|date=February 2001|volume=48|series=Breastfeeding 2001, Part 1: The Evidence for Breastfeeding|issue=1|pages=105–123|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0031395505702881|doi=10.1016/S0031-3955(05)70288-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many infants in Africa suffer from malnutrition because their mothers do not breastfeed them. The mothers in South Africa that do not breast feed their children do not do it mainly to try to avoid the possibility that in doing so, their children may contract [[AIDS]].&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding by HIV-1-infected women and outcome in their infants: a cohort study from Durban, South Africa "/&gt; The 2010 [[Department of Health (South Africa)|South Africa Department of Health]] Study found that 30.2% of pregnant women in South Africa have AIDs.&lt;ref name="South Africa HIV &amp; AIDS Statistics"/&gt;

Thus, these women pose a huge risk to their infants because infants drinking breast milk infected with the [[HIV virus]] may contract the virus as well.&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding by HIV-1-infected women and outcome in their infants: a cohort study from Durban, South Africa " /&gt; Infants with the HIV virus are more likely to pass away if they are breast fed than if they are [[infant formula|formula]]-fed.&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding by HIV-1-infected women and outcome in their infants: a cohort study from Durban, South Africa " /&gt; A study published in ''the [[Journal of the International AIDS Society]]'' found that the mortality for infected infants was 19% for exclusively breast-fed infants, 13% for mixed-fed infants, and 0% for formula-fed infants.&lt;ref name="Breastfeeding by HIV-1-infected women and outcome in their infants: a cohort study from Durban, South Africa " /&gt;

Thus, many conflicted South African mothers are faced with the morally difficult decision of whether to prevent malnutrition in their children by breastfeeding them at the risk of them contracting HIV, or preventing HIV in their children at the risk of them not being properly nourished. Because the health cost of not breastfeeding a child is not widely known, most South African women chose the latter option and turn to baby formula to replace breast milk as the main nutritional source for their infants. In fact, according to the South African Demographic Health Service, out of all 3-month-old babies in South Africa, only 10% were exclusively breast-fed and 48.3% were bottle-fed.&lt;ref name="Factors Contributing To Malnutrition In Children
0-60 Months Admitted To Hospitals In The Northern
Cape"/&gt;

The formula readily available to the average South African woman does not provide the sufficient nutrients necessary to sustain an infant when utilized by itself. Thus, many infants are not provided with the necessary nutrients they need to thrive, and this can lead to severe cases of malnutrition. The first two years of a person's life constitutes the most vulnerable period for malnutrition, making this lack of nutrients especially detrimental to an infant's health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Faber|first=Mieke|author2=Wenhold, Freid|title=Nutrition in Contemporary South Africa|journal=Water South Africa|year=2007|volume=33|issue=3|pages=393–400|url=http://www.ajol.info/index.php/wsa/article/view/49122/35467}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the problem of malnutrition isn't simply solved by a mother choosing to breastfeed her child. Many infants who are breastfed have mothers who are severely undernourished themselves. If a mother doesn't have sufficient nutrients for herself, she is much less likely to have sufficient nutrients in her breast milk. Thus, breast milk from undernourished women is often lacking sufficient quantities of several vital [[vitamins]] and minerals like [[vitamin B6]] and [[folic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sneed|first=S M|author2=C Zane |author3=M R Thomas |title=The Effects of Ascorbic Acid, Vitamin B6, Vitamin B12, and Folic Acid Supplementation on the Breast Milk and Maternal Nutritional Status of Low Socioeconomic Lactating Women.|journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]|date=July 1981|volume=34|issue=7|pages=1338–1346|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/34/7/1338.short}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lack of nutrients can lead to a [[nutritional deficiencies|nutritional deficiency]] in the child being breastfed as well.

=== Additional factors ===
Another main determinant of malnutrition is [[culture]] and [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]].&lt;ref name="The Right to Food in Theory and Practice" /&gt; Various rural South African groups lead [[Agriculture|agricultural]] cultivation-based lifestyles that only allow them to live on the very limited amount of resources given to them by their land. The food resources they have access to lack several vital nutrients, making malnutrition among these people more prevalent than among [[pastoral]] people and other people with more animal-based diets. In comparison to the average American diet, rural South African groups like the South African [[Bantu peoples|Bantu]] consume a diet with less than half of the [[fat]] content.&lt;ref name="Fat Intake, Serum Cholesterol Concentration, and Atherosclerosis in the South African Bantu. Part I. Low Fat Intake and the Age Trend of Serum Cholesterol Concentration in the South African Bantu "&gt;{{cite journal|last=Walker|first=Alexander R. P.|author2=Ulla B. Arvidsson|title=Fat Intake, Serum Cholesterol Concentration, and Atherosclerosis in the South African Bantu. Part I. Low Fat Intake and the Age Trend of Serum Cholesterol Concentration in the South African Bantu|journal=The Journal of Clinical Investigation|date=October 1954|volume=33|issue=10|pmc=1072555|pmid=13201641|doi=10.1172/JCI103012|pages=1358–65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A lack of fat often accompanies a lack of [[protein]]. A lack of protein in a South African's diet can lead to a form of severe malnutrition known as "[[kwashiorkor]]."&lt;ref name="Kwashiorkor in Africa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brock|first=J. F.|author2=M. Autret|title=Kwashiorkor in Africa|journal=Bull World Health Organ|year=1952|volume=5|issue=1|pages=1–71|pmc=2554082|pmid=14925815}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research was done to compare the frequency of kwashiorkor among five African groups: the [[Maasai people|Maasai]], the [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]], the Batussi, the Bahutu, the Pieraerts, and the Wakamba.&lt;ref name="Kwashiorkor in Africa" /&gt; The Masai are pastoral people who consume milk and on occasion, meat. The Wakamba, Kikuyu, and Bahutu are non-pastoral agricultural people who cultivate the foods that they eat. The Batussi people are [[Animal husbandry|livestock raisers]] who consume large amounts of [[curd]]led milk. The Pieraert people are lake-side dwellers who consume fresh fish and dried fish. The research found no incidences of kwashiorkor among the Masai, Batussi, the Pieraert, and a small part of the Bahutu who in addition to vegetables and grains, also cultivate beans.&lt;ref name="Kwashiorkor in Africa" /&gt;

However, numerous incidences of kwashiorkor were found among the Wakamba, Kiyuku, and solely grain and vegetable-consuming Bahutu.&lt;ref name="Kwashiorkor in Africa" /&gt; This shows that South African people who have an agricultural cultivation-based lifestyle are at high risk for malnutrition. In addition to those living in desolate, rural areas, those living in South African [[slum]]s and other [[poverty]]-stricken conditions also only have access to a high-starch, low protein diet.&lt;ref name="Fat Intake, Serum Cholesterol Concentration, and Atherosclerosis in the South African Bantu. Part I. Low Fat Intake and the Age Trend of Serum Cholesterol Concentration in the South African Bantu " /&gt; The typical undernourishing South African diet is based on the main staples of [[rice]], [[porridge]], and [[maize]].&lt;ref name="Fat Intake, Serum Cholesterol Concentration, and Atherosclerosis in the South African Bantu. Part I. Low Fat Intake and the Age Trend of Serum Cholesterol Concentration in the South African Bantu " /&gt;

===Poverty===
Malnutrition is an underlying cause of severe poverty.&lt;ref name="The Right to Food in Theory and Practice" /&gt; According to statistics from the year 2000, 50% of the South African population is under the [[poverty line]].&lt;ref name="Chronic Poverty In South Africa"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aliber|first=Michael|title=Chronic Poverty In South Africa: Incidence, Causes and Policies|journal=World Development|date=March 2003|volume=31|issue=3|pages=473–490|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0305750X0200219X|doi=10.1016/S0305-750X(02)00219-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa's [[per capita GDP]] is $11000 but 21% of people live on a dollar or less a day. In 2008, 27.9% of youth between ages fifteen and twenty-four were unemployed, and the amount of overall unemployment was even higher (33.2%).&lt;ref&gt;
Armstrong, P., Lekezwa, B., &amp; Siebrits, K. (2008)."Poverty in South Africa: A profile based on recent household surveys". ''Matieland: Stellenbosch Economic Working Paper text'', 4(08)&lt;/ref&gt;

The unemployment rate partly stems from South Africa's unstable [[Macroeconomics|macroeconomic]] status that regardless of modern attempts, is yet to be effectively controlled. The nationwide economic instability causes income instability for many Africans, which is reflected in a drop of food and beverage purchases. Statistics have shown the percentage of South African incomes being spent on food and beverage purchases have dropped drastically from 27.4% in the year 2000 to 16.6%  in the year 2005.&lt;ref&gt;(2008).

===Income inequality===
According to 2008 statistics, South Africa has the third most unequal economy in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chopra|first=M.|author2=Drimie, S. |author3=Witten, C. |title=Combating Malnutrition in South Africa. Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition|journal=Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition (GAIN), Working Paper Series|year=2009|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The widespread poverty in Africa can be traced to many factors. UNICEF states that the main causes of malnutrition are "household food insecurity, inadequate care for the vulnerable groups such as maternal and childcare, insufficient essential human services including health, education, water and environmental [[sanitation]] and housing.&lt;ref name="The Right to Food in Theory and Practice"&gt;{{cite book|last=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations|title=The Right to Food in Theory and Practice|year=1998|publisher= Rome: Food &amp; Agriculture Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;UNICEF. (1998). The State of the World's Children 1998: A UNICEF report. Malnutrition: causes, consequences, and solutions. Nutr Rev, 56(4 part I), 115-123.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the effects of [[South African Apartheid]] listed in the [[World Fact Book]], Apartheid has helped create many of these issues, especially housing, healthcare, and education. Issues like education (i.e. poor performance in school, poor cognitive development) are directly connected to malnutrition in children.&lt;ref name="Poverty, Household Food Insecurity and Nutrition: Coping Strategies in an Informal Settlement in the Vaal Triangle, South Africa. " /&gt;

South Africa is unique from other African countries in its particular experience with Apartheid and [[colonialism]].&lt;ref name="Chronic Poverty In South Africa" /&gt;  South Africa has numerous rich [[natural resource]]s like diamonds and gold. When diamonds and gold were discovered in 1867 and 1886, instead of causing widespread richness for the African people, it caused widespread subjugation to the [[Boer]]s (Dutch Settlers).&lt;ref name="Africa: South Africa"&gt;{{cite web|last=The World Factbook|title=Africa: South Africa|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/sf.html|publisher=Central Intelligence Agency|accessdate=10 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon their arrival, the [[Dutch people|Dutch]] forced black farmers to either abandon their land, become [[sharecroppers]], or become [[farm laborer]]s.&lt;ref name="Chronic Poverty In South Africa" /&gt;  Subjugation from non-native groups continued until South Africa became a [[Republic]]. This long period of subjugation eventually lead to the establishment of Apartheid in South Africa in 1948 by the [[National Party (South Africa)|National Party]] ( the ruling political party of the time).&lt;ref name="Poverty, Household Food Insecurity and Nutrition: Coping Strategies in an Informal Settlement in the Vaal Triangle, South Africa. " /&gt;

In the 1960s, the Apartheid-centered government created African reserves where blacks could live and have a chance at "[[separate development]]."&lt;ref name="Chronic Poverty In South Africa" /&gt; Although the majority of South Africans were (and continue to be) black, the reserves compromised a disproportionally small amount of land (13% of South Africa).&lt;ref name="Chronic Poverty In South Africa" /&gt; The reserves were geographically isolated and had poor healthcare, infrastructure and irrigation.&lt;ref name="Chronic Poverty In South Africa" /&gt; Although the first multiracial election in 1994 brought an immediate end to Apartheid, the detrimental effects of Apartheid in South Africa continue to be felt today.&lt;ref name="Africa: South Africa" /&gt;

The poorest South African provinces today are those that encompass former African reserves ( Eastern Cape, Limpopo Province, and Kwazulu-Natal).&lt;ref name="Chronic Poverty In South Africa" /&gt; These places are especially known for their higher rates of malnutrition as compared to the already high rates of South Africa. [[HIV/AIDS in South African townships|These Black areas also have the highest rates of AIDS in South Africa]]&lt;ref name="ten"&gt;"South Africa HIV &amp; AIDS Statistics." AVERT. Web. 3 Mar. 2012. &lt;http://www.avert.org/south-africa-hiv-aids-statistics.htm&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; - 13.6% of black Africans in South Africa are HIV-positive, whereas only 0.3% of whites living in South Africa have the disease.&lt;ref name="ten"/&gt;

While 72% of the South African population considered poor live in rural areas, 86.9% of the chronically poor in [[Kwazulu-Natal]] live in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Chronic Poverty In South Africa" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;May, J., &amp; Govender, J. (1998). [http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/1998/poverty/presentation.pdf "Poverty and inequality in South Africa."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120227140825/http://www.info.gov.za/otherdocs/1998/poverty/presentation.pdf |date=27 February 2012 }} ''Indicator South Africa'', 15, 53-58.&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas people in wealthy urban areas tend to have a better nutritional status, rural and agriculturally based people in South Africa tend to have the most inadequate diet.&lt;ref name="The Right to Food in Theory and Practice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Poverty, Household Food Insecurity and Nutrition: Coping Strategies in an Informal Settlement in the Vaal Triangle, South Africa. " /&gt;

This is because while wealthy urban residents have access to better education and food, their rural, chronically poor counterparts are less educated, have lower literacy levels, and have limited food access.&lt;ref name="The Right to Food in Theory and Practice" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Chronic Poverty In South Africa" /&gt; In 1997, 900,000 households that were located in formal reserves had no arable land access, 1.4 million had no access to any livestock besides chickens, and 770,000 households had access to neither arable land or other livestock.&lt;ref name=zaf-statssa-ohs-1999-v01&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa - October Household Survey 1999|publisher=Statistics South Africa}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, many of the rural households that did have access to livestock had to sell the livestock in order to alleviate poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Ardington, E. M. (1988). ''Nkandla revisited: A longitudinal study of the strategies adopted to alleviate poverty in a rural community.'' Durban: University of Natal.&lt;/ref&gt; All this results in a severe shortage of food among the rural poor, thereby leading to a shortage of nutrients.&lt;ref name="The Right to Food in Theory and Practice" /&gt;

==Treatment==
Since the 1990s, the first [[Millennium Development Goals|Millennium Development Goal]] of the [[United Nations]] has been to eradicate [[world hunger]] and malnutrition. According to the United Nations, there are certain steps that could be especially beneficial in combating malnutrition.&lt;ref name="The Right to Food in Theory and Practice" /&gt; It is estimated that by simply increasing Vitamin A and C intake along with improving breastfeeding methods, the lives of 2.4 million children throughout the world could be saved annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kowal|first=Paul R.|author2=Lopez A.D. |author3=Norton M. |author4=Berman P. |author5=Belizan J.M. |author6=Cafferata M.L. |author7=Belizan M. |author8=Cunha A.L.A. |title=Child Survival [1] (multiple letters)|journal=The Lancet|year=2003|volume=362|series=The Child Survival Series|issue=9387|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(03)14308-5|pages=915–917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Various programs in South Africa have been established since then to help achieve this, all with different success rates.

===Integrated nutrition program===
In accordance with the goal of the United Nations, the South Africa Department of Health established the Integrated Nutrition Program in 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Combating Malnutrition in South Africa |url=https://www.google.com/#hl=en&amp;tbo=d&amp;output=search&amp;sclient=psy-ab&amp;q=http:%2F%2Fwww.dbsa.org%2FResearch%2FDocuments%2FSouth%2520Africa%2520Nutrition_%2520input%2520paper_roadmap.pdf)&amp;oq=http:%2F%2Fwww.dbsa.org%2FResearch%2FDocuments%2FSouth%2520Africa%2520Nutrition_%2520input%2520paper_roadmap.pdf)&amp;gs_l=hp.3...3936.3936.0.5425.1.1.0.0.0.0.70.70.1.1.0.les%3B..0.0...1c.2.fI12OIdQAKg&amp;pbx=1&amp;bav=on.2,or.r_gc.r_pw.r_qf.&amp;fp=a82d8ac0e00dcd3d&amp;bpcl=39650382&amp;biw=1280&amp;bih=598 |accessdate=10 December 2012 |newspaper=Input Paper for Health Roadmap |date=September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121209235137/https://www.google.com/ |archivedate=9 December 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The INP aims to mainly help the people most prevalently at risk for malnutrition: children six years old and under,  pregnant women, and lactating women. The main foci of the INP are breastfeeding promotion, growth monitoring and promotion, food fortification, micronutrient supplementation, hospital-based management of severe malnutrition, nutrition rehabilitation in communities, and nutrition management during illness.&lt;ref name="Combating Malnutrition in South Africa" /&gt; The INP addresses these foci through nutritional education,
nutrition counseling services and support for specific ailments, and indirect provision of healthcare services.&lt;ref name="Combating Malnutrition in South Africa" /&gt;

Since the establishment of the INP in 1995, South Africa has adopted the [[International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes]] to promote breastfeeding.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective"&gt;Swart, R., Sanders, D., &amp; McLachlan, M. (2008). [http://healthlink.org.za/uploads/files/chap9_08.pdf ''Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective.''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150518092146/http://healthlink.org.za/uploads/files/chap9_08.pdf# |date=18 May 2015 }} South African health review, 129-148.&lt;/ref&gt; The code was cofounded by the [[World Health Organization]] and [[UNICEF]] during the thirty-third [[World Health Assembly]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (1981). International Code of Marketing of Breast-milk Substitutes. World Health Organization.&lt;/ref&gt; It aims to provide nutrition to malnourished infants through the facilitation of breast-feeding and proper use of breast-feeding substitutes only when absolutely necessary. Unfortunately, there has been a delay in the legislation of the code. If passed, it will need to promote intensive training that follows along the national breastfeeding guidelines for health workers, so that they can reach out to individuals that are doubtful of the benefits of breastfeeding their children.&lt;ref name="Combating Malnutrition in South Africa" /&gt; It will also need to promote the extension of maternity leave benefits to give working South African mothers sufficient time and resources to breastfeed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=A.|title=The Rationale for Adopting Current International Breastfeeding Guidelines in South Africa|journal=Maternal &amp; Child Nutrition|date=October 2007|volume=3|issue=4|pages=271–280|doi=10.1111/j.1740-8709.2007.00117.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The INP has implemented growth monitoring in South Africa through the following measures: the provision of growth cards to all caretakers of children under two years old, the constant monitoring of growth and detection of malnutrition, the provision of counsel to caretakers, and the promotion of growth.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt; However, there are various shortcomings in Africa's approach to growth monitoring and promotion. These include inaccurate weight assessment, lack of weight plotting, nurses not trained sufficiently to detect malnutrition, inability to supply growth cards to all infants, and lack of sufficient communication with caretakers.&lt;ref name="The Targeting of Nutritionally
at Risk Children Attending a Primary Health Care Facility in
the Western Cape Province of South Africa"&gt;Schoeman SE, Hendricks MK, Hatting SP, Benade AJ,
Laubscher JA, Dhansay MA. (2006).

In order to directly address nutrient deficiencies, the INP established a mandatory food fortification program in 2003, which is interrelated to the micronutrient supplementation program.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt; However, the programs have not reached their anticipated success rates.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt; The food fortification program has created a food fortification mix imbedded in maize meal and other complementary foods. The mix's high Folate content seems to have eradicated Folate deficiencies.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt; The food fortification program also made the iodization of salt mandatory since 1995.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt; This seems to have halted incidences of iodine deficiencies.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt; However, any micronutrients lacking in the food fortification mix can still cause malnutrition. Unfortunately, it has been difficult for the micronutrient supplementation program to provide all the lacking micronutrients to those in need. The program faces various limitations in the forms of supply, supplement quality, bio-availability, outreach, and compliance.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt;  For example, the Vitamin A supplementation program has been criticized for its struggles with reaching its most vulnerable target: children and post-partum women.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt;

The INP has not failed to recognize the challenges that arise in the hospital-based management of severe malnutrition. South African hospitals admit numerous children for severe malnutrition, yet many of these children end up suffering easily avoidable deaths.&lt;ref&gt;Schofield, C., &amp; Ashworth, A. (1996). [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2486901/pdf/bullwho00400-0105.pdf "Why Have Mortality Rates for Severe Malnutrition Remained So High?" ''Bulletin of the World Health Organization'', 74(2), 223.]&lt;/ref&gt; Even after the 2006 South African amendment of the [[District Health Information System]], which was supposed to provide the case fatality rates of severe malnourishment among children in hospitals, the lack of identification of malnutrition-related deaths remains high.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt; However, there has been a notable drop of malnutrition-related deaths among hospitals due to training and capacity development geared at the hospital staff.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt;

In order to address the problem of nutrient supplementation on a community-wide level, the INP helped establish the short-term program "Nutrition Supplementation Program" (previously known as the PEM Scheme).&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt; This program has been fairly effective because of the well-trained nutritionists that assist it.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt; However, various shortcomings remain. The program has struggled with community based interventions and with properly reaching out to and enrolling all malnourished children without misusing resources on children that are not truly malnourished.&lt;ref name="The Targeting of Nutritionally
at Risk Children Attending a Primary Health Care Facility in
the Western Cape Province of South Africa" /&gt; If the Child Support Grant was extended to apply to all families of malnourished children, all at risk children could be reached and enrolled at hospitals, clinics, and other places that participate in growth monitoring.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt;

Nutrition management during disease is another method used by the INP to prevent malnutrition. South Africa's Department of Health adapted the [[Integrated Management of Childhood Illness]] to encourage proper nutrition management.&lt;ref name="Nutrition: A Primary Health Care Perspective" /&gt; UNICEF, in conjunction with the World Health Organization,  established the IMCI to increase child survival in areas with poor resources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IMCI Integrated Management of Childhood Illness|url=http://crh.ukzn.ac.za/ProgrammesandResearch/IMCI.aspx|publisher=Centre for Rural Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; IMCI aims to achieve this through a combination of improved management of common childhood diseases and proper nutrition and immunization.&lt;ref&gt;Lambrechts T, Bryce J, Orinda V. (1999) [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2557705/ "Integrated Management of Childhood Illnesses." ] ''A Summary of First Experiences.'' ''Bull World Health Organ.'' 77(7) 582-594.&lt;/ref&gt; However, there are various vague generalities in IMCI's guidelines that make it difficult for South African health providers to know exactly how to train mothers to provide food for their children.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. (2005). Handbook: IMCI Integrated Management of Childhood Illness. Geneva: WHO.&lt;/ref&gt; This presents a problem because most ill South African children are never seen by a nutritionist so they have no other way of learning how to have a proper nutrition.

==Epidemiology==
The article ''Agreement on Defining Malnutrition'' defines [[malnutrition]] as affecting individuals whom "food and nutrient intake is consistently inadequate to meet individual requirements."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Annalynn|first=Skipper|title=Agreement on Defining Malnutrition|journal=Journal of Parenter Enteral Nutrition|date=May 2012|volume=36|issue=3|pages=261-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the standards of this definition, malnutrition is a prevalent problem in South Africa. In the year 2000, 39% of the country's population suffered from malnutrition.&lt;ref name="Malnutrition in South Africa" /&gt; Children are the most affected by this problem, especially young children. South Africa's problem of malnutrition is unique to other countries' malnutrition problems because South Africa is a primarily young country, with one third of the population being under the age of 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Census 2001: Census in Brief|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za|publisher=Statistics South Africa|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thus, the fact that 25% of pre-school children and 20% of primary school children in South Africa suffered from malnutrition in the year 2000 means that the future population of South Africa is being endangered by the problems of malnutrition&lt;ref name="Malnutrition in South Africa" /&gt; The problem of malnutrition in South Africa can be individually assessed through the deviation of weight of each child from the average weight for their age. According to the [[World Health Organization]], the deviation from the average weight of children under age five in South Africa has dropped from 31.5% to 8.7% from 1994 to 2008.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization."Global Database on Childhood Growth and Malnutrition". ''UNICEF/WHO Joint Global Malnutrition Analysis Set,'' cited in [http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/south-africa/malnutrition-prevalence "South Africa-Malnutrition Prevalence.]"''Index Mundi."''&lt;/ref&gt; Malnutrition can also be individually assessed through the deviation of [[Human height|height]] of each child from the average height for their age. This is because malnutrition [[Stunted growth|stunts growth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Scrimshaw|first=Nevin S.|title=Malnutrition, Learning, and Behavior|journal=[[The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition]]|year=1967|volume=20|issue=5|pages=493–502|url=http://ajcn.nutrition.org/content/20/5/493.short|accessdate=9 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The World Health Organization showed that over the span of thirteen years (1995 to 2008), the deviation from the average height of children under age five in South Africa has slightly decreased from 28.7% to 23.9%.&lt;ref&gt;"Global Database on Child Growth and Malnutrition."''World Health Organization,'' cited in [http://www.indexmundi.com/facts/south-africa/malnutrition-prevalence "South Africa-Malnutrition Prevalence.]"''Index Mundi."''&lt;/ref&gt; These decreases in deviation show that the problem of malnutrition in South Africa has decreased over recent years. However, it remains a prevalent problem, notably in the regions of [[Eastern Cape]] and the [[Limpopo Province]]. These two areas are especially poor and rural as compared to the rest of South Africa. According to [[UNICEF]], although 84.5% of South Africans have access to piped water, only 62.4% of Eastern Cape residents have access to piped water.&lt;ref name="What Are the Leading Causes of Death Among South African Children?"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bradshaw|first=Debbie|author2=David Bourne |author3=Nadine Nannan |title=What Are the Leading Causes of Death Among South African Children?|journal=MRC Policy Brief|date=December 2003|volume=3|url=http://www.unicef.org/southafrica/SAF_publications_mrc.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, although only 13.6% of South African households have no toilet facilities, 30% of Eastern Cape residents lack toilet facilities.&lt;ref name="What Are the Leading Causes of Death Among South African Children?" /&gt; Similar statistics are true for the rural areas of the Limpopo Province in northern South Africa. The prevalence of malnutrition in Limpopo is so vast that 48% percent of children in the Limpopo Province evaluated in a 2005 study were shown to have stunted growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Mamabolo, Ramoteme L; Marianne Alberts, Nelia P Steyn, Henriette A Delemarrevan de Waal and Naomi S Levitt|title=Prevalence and determinants of stunting and overweight in 3-year-old black South African children residing in the Central Region of Limpopo Province, South Africa|journal=Public Health Nutrition|date=August 2005|volume=8|issue=5|pages=501–508|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/download.php?file=%2F76830_BDFEF7B97CE67879C2761EF7C7246ADE_journals__PHN_PHN8_05_S1368980005000698a.pdf&amp;cover=Y&amp;code=10d30438857b9a7c00062d1042e9273c|doi=10.1079/phn2005786}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the high levels of poverty and the rural state of these two areas reflect back through high levels of malnutrition.

&lt;!-- Definition and symptoms --&gt;
'''Melanoma''', also known as '''malignant melanoma''', is a type of [[cancer]] that develops from the pigment-containing cells known as [[melanocyte]]s.&lt;ref name="NCI2015"&gt;{{cite web|title=Melanoma Treatment–for health professionals (PDQ®)|url=http://www.cancer.gov/types/skin/hp/melanoma-treatment-pdq|website=National Cancer Institute|accessdate=30 June 2015|date=June 26, 2015|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150704213842/http://www.cancer.gov/types/skin/hp/melanoma-treatment-pdq|archivedate=4 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Melanomas typically occur in the skin, but may rarely occur in the mouth, [[intestines]], or [[uveal melanoma|eye]].&lt;ref name=NCI2015/&gt;&lt;ref name=WCR2014/&gt; In women, they most commonly occur on the legs, while in men they are most common on the back.&lt;ref name=WCR2014/&gt; Sometimes they develop from a [[nevus|mole]] with changes such as an increase in size, irregular edges, change in color, itchiness, or [[Ulcer (dermatology)|skin breakdown]].&lt;ref name=NCI2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
The primary cause of melanoma is [[ultraviolet light]] (UV) exposure in those with low levels of [[human skin color|skin pigment]].&lt;ref name=WCR2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kanavy HE, Gerstenblith MR |title=Ultraviolet radiation and melanoma |journal=Semin Cutan Med Surg |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=222–28 |date=December 2011 |pmid=22123420 |doi=10.1016/j.sder.2011.08.003 |url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S1085-5629(11)00130-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UV light may be from either the sun or from other sources, such as [[tanning lamp|tanning devices]].&lt;ref name=WCR2014/&gt; About 25% develop from moles.&lt;ref name=WCR2014/&gt; Those with many moles, a history of affected family members, and who have [[immunosuppression|poor immune function]] are at greater risk.&lt;ref name=NCI2015/&gt; A number of rare genetic defects such as [[xeroderma pigmentosum]] also increase risk.&lt;ref name=Az2014/&gt; Diagnosis is by [[biopsy]] and analysis of any skin lesion that has signs of being potentially cancerous.&lt;ref name=NCI2015/&gt;

&lt;!-- Prevention, treatment and prognosis --&gt;
Using [[sunscreen]] and avoiding UV light may prevent melanoma.&lt;ref name=WCR2014/&gt; Treatment is typically removal by surgery.&lt;ref name=NCI2015/&gt; In those with slightly larger cancers, nearby [[lymph nodes]] may be tested for spread.&lt;ref name=NCI2015/&gt; Most people are cured if spread has not occurred.&lt;ref name=NCI2015/&gt; For those in whom melanoma has spread, [[Cancer immunotherapy|immunotherapy]], [[biologic therapy]], [[radiation therapy]], or [[chemotherapy]] may improve survival.&lt;ref name=NCI2015/&gt;&lt;ref name="Syn2017"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Syn NL, Teng MW, Mok TS, Soo RA | title = De-novo and acquired resistance to immune checkpoint targeting | journal = The Lancet.

==Signs and symptoms==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Early signs of melanoma are changes to the shape or color of existing [[Mole (skin marking)|moles]] or, in the case of [[nodular melanoma]], the appearance of a new lump anywhere on the skin. At later stages, the mole may [[itch]], [[Ulcer (dermatology)|ulcerate]] or bleed.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}  Early signs of melanoma are summarized by the mnemonic "ABCDE":{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} 
*'''A'''symmetry
* '''B'''orders (irregular with edges and corners)
*'''C'''olor (variegated)
*'''D'''iameter (greater than {{convert|6|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, about the size of a pencil eraser)
*'''E'''volving over time
These classifications do not, however, apply to the most dangerous form of melanoma, nodular melanoma, which has its own classifications:{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} 

*'''E'''levated above the skin surface
*'''F'''irm to the touch
*'''G'''rowing
Metastatic melanoma may cause nonspecific [[paraneoplastic syndrome|paraneoplastic symptoms]], including loss of appetite, [[nausea]], vomiting and fatigue. [[Metastasis]] of early melanoma is possible, but relatively rare: less than a fifth of melanomas diagnosed early become metastatic. [[brain metastasis|Brain metastases]] are particularly common in patients with metastatic melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Fiddler IJ | title = Melanoma Metastasis | journal = Cancer Control | volume = 2 | issue = 5 | pages = 398–404 | date = October 1995 | pmid = 10862180 | doi = 10.1177/107327489500200503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can also spread to the liver, bones, abdomen or distant lymph nodes.

==Cause==
Melanomas are usually caused by DNA damage resulting from exposure to ultraviolet light from the sun. Genetics also plays a role.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} Melanoma can also occur in skin areas with little sun exposure (ie. mouth, soles of feet, palms of hands, genital areas).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Goydos|first=James S.|last2=Shoen|first2=Steven L.|date=2016|title=Acral Lentiginous Melanoma|journal=Cancer Treatment and Research|volume=167|pages=321–329|doi=10.1007/978-3-319-22539-5_14|issn=0927-3042|pmid=26601870|isbn=978-3-319-22538-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; People with [[dysplastic nevus syndrome]], also known as familial atypical multiple mole melanoma (FAMMM, are at increased risk for the development of melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perkins|first=Allen|last2=Duffy|first2=R.

===UV radiation===
The ultraviolet radiation from tanning beds increases the risk of melanoma.&lt;ref name="pmid22833605"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Boniol M, Autier P, Boyle P, Gandini S | title = Cutaneous melanoma attributable to sunbed use: systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = BMJ (Clinical Research Ed.) | volume = 345 | issue = | pages = e4757 | date = July 2012 | pmid = 22833605 | pmc = 3404185 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.e4757 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[International Agency for Research on Cancer]] finds that tanning beds are "carcinogenic to humans" and that people who begin using tanning devices before the age of thirty years are 75% more likely to develop melanoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |author=WHO International Agency for Research on Cancer Monograph Working Group |title=A Review of Human Carcinogens – Part D: Radiation |journal=[[The Lancet Oncology]]|date = August 2009| volume=10| issue=8| pages=751–52| doi=10.1016/S1470-2045(09)70213-X| pmid=19655431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those who work in airplanes also appear to have an increased risk, believed to be due to greater exposure to UV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sanlorenzo M, Wehner MR, Linos E, Kornak J, Kainz W, Posch C, Vujic I, Johnston K, Gho D, Monico G, McGrath JT, Osella-Abate S, Quaglino P, Cleaver JE, Ortiz-Urda S | title = The risk of melanoma in airline pilots and cabin crew: a meta-analysis | journal = JAMA Dermatology | volume = 151 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–8 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25188246 | pmc = 4482339 | doi = 10.1001/jamadermatol.2014.1077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ultraviolet|Ultraviolet UVB light]] (wavelengths between 315–280&amp;nbsp;nm) from the sun is absorbed by skin cell DNA and results in a type of [[direct DNA damage]] called [[Pyrimidine dimers|cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers (CPDs)]]. [[Thymine]]-thymine, [[cytosine]]-cytosine or cytosine-thymine [[Protein dimer|dimer]]s are formed by the joining of two adjacent [[pyrimidine]] bases within a DNA strand. Somewhat similarly to [[UVB]], [[Ultraviolet|UVA light]] (longer wavelengths between 400–315&amp;nbsp;nm) from the sun or from tanning beds can also be directly absorbed by skin DNA (at about 100 to 1000 fold lower efficiency than UVB is absorbed).&lt;ref name="pmid22005748"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rünger TM, Farahvash B, Hatvani Z, Rees A |title=Comparison of DNA damage responses following equimutagenic doses of UVA and UVB: a less effective cell cycle arrest with UVA may render UVA-induced pyrimidine dimers more mutagenic than UVB-induced ones |journal=Photochem.

Possible significant elements in determining risk include the intensity and duration of sun exposure, the age at which sun exposure occurs, and the degree of [[skin pigmentation]]. Melanoma rates tend to be highest in countries settled by migrants from [[northern Europe]] that have a large amount of direct, intense sunlight that the skin of the settlers is not adapted to, most notably Australia. Exposure during childhood is a more important risk factor than exposure in adulthood. This is seen in migration studies in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Khlat M, Vail A, Parkin M, Green A | title = Mortality from melanoma in migrants to Australia: variation by age at arrival and duration of stay | journal = Am J Epidemiol | volume = 135 | issue = 10 | pages = 1103–13 | year = 1992 | pmid = 1632422}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Having multiple severe sunburns increases the likelihood that future sunburns develop into melanoma due to cumulative damage.&lt;ref name=Mayo2016/&gt; The sun and tanning beds are the main sources of UV radiation that increase the risk for melanoma and living close to the equator increases exposure to UV radiation.&lt;ref name=Mayo2016/&gt;

===Genetics===
A number of rare mutations, which often run in families, greatly increase melanoma susceptibility. Several [[genes]] increase risks. Some rare genes have a relatively high risk of causing melanoma; some more common genes, such as a gene called [[melanocortin 1 receptor|MC1R]] that causes red hair, have a relatively lower elevated risk. [[Genetic testing]] can be used to search for the mutations.

One class of mutations affects the gene [[P16 (gene)|CDKN2A]]. An alternative [[reading frame]] mutation in this gene leads to the destabilization of [[p53]], a [[transcription factor]] involved in [[apoptosis]] and in fifty percent of human cancers. Another mutation in the same gene results in a nonfunctional inhibitor of [[CDK4]], a [[cyclin]]-dependent [[kinase]] that promotes [[cell division]]. Mutations that cause the skin condition [[xeroderma pigmentosum]] (XP) also increase melanoma susceptibility. Scattered throughout the genome, these mutations reduce a cell's ability to repair DNA. Both CDKN2A and XP mutations are highly penetrant (the chances of a carrier to express the phenotype is high).

Familial melanoma (FAMMM) is genetically heterogeneous,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greene MH | title = The genetics of hereditary melanoma and nevi. 1998 update | journal = Cancer | volume = 86 | issue = 11 Suppl | pages = 2464–77 | date = December 1999 | pmid = 10630172 | doi = 10.1002/(SICI)1097-0142(19991201)86:11 &lt;2464::AID-CNCR3&gt;3.0.CO;2-F }}&lt;/ref&gt; and loci for familial melanoma appear on the [[chromosome]] arms 1p, 9p and 12q.

The earliest stage of melanoma starts when [[melanocytes]] begin out-of-control growth. Melanocytes are found between the outer layer of the skin (the [[epidermis (skin)|epidermis]]) and the next layer (the [[dermis]]). This early stage of the disease is called the radial growth phase, when the tumor is less than 1&amp;nbsp;mm thick. Because the cancer cells have not yet reached the blood vessels deeper in the skin, it is very unlikely that this early-stage melanoma will spread to other parts of the body. If the melanoma is detected at this stage, then it can usually be completely removed with surgery.

When the tumor cells start to move in a different direction – vertically up into the epidermis and into the [[papillary dermis]] – cell behaviour changes dramatically.&lt;ref name=Hershkovitz10/&gt;

The next step in the evolution is the invasive radial growth phase, which is a confusing term; however, it explains the process of the radial growth, in which individual cells start to acquire invasive potential. From this point on the melanoma is capable of spreading. The [[Breslow's depth]] of the lesion is usually less than {{convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, while the [[Clark level]] is usually 2.

The vertical growth phase (VGP) following is the invasive melanoma. The tumor becomes able to grow into the surrounding tissue and can spread around the body through blood or [[lymph vessels]]. The tumor thickness is usually more than {{convert|1|mm|2|abbr=on|lk=out}}, and the tumor involves the deeper parts of the dermis.

The host elicits an immunological reaction against the tumor during the VGP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=ASCO Annual Meeting Proceedings Part I.

These cells sometimes completely destroy the primary tumor; this is called regression, which is the latest stage of development.

Visual inspection is the most common diagnostic technique.&lt;ref name="ap01"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Wurm EM, Soyer HP |title=Scanning for melanoma |date=October 2010 |journal=Australian Prescriber |issue=33 |pages=150–55 |url=http://www.australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/5/150/5 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019035021/http://australianprescriber.com/magazine/33/5/150/5 |archivedate=2010-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Moles that are irregular in color or shape are typically treated as candidates. To detect melanomas (and increase survival rates), it is recommended to learn to recognize them (see "ABCDE" mnemonic below), to regularly examine [[Melanocytic nevus|moles]] for changes (shape, size, color, itching or bleeding) and to consult a qualified physician when a candidate appears.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Prevention: ABCD's of Melanoma |publisher=American Melanoma Foundation |url=http://www.melanomafoundation.org/prevention/abcd.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030423111111/http://melanomafoundation.org/prevention/abcd.htm |archivedate=2003-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | vauthors = Friedman R, Rigel D, Kopf A | title = Early detection of malignant melanoma: the role of physician examination and self-examination of the skin | journal = CA Cancer J Clin | volume = 35 | issue = 3 | pages = 130–51 | year = 1985 | pmid = 3921200 | doi = 10.3322/canjclin.35.3.130 | deadurl = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many melanomas present as lesions smaller than 6&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter; and all melanomas are malignant when they first appear as a small dot. Physicians typically examine all moles, including those less than 6&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter. [[Seborrheic keratosis]] may meet some or all of the ABCD criteria, and can lead to [[false alarm]]s. Doctors can generally distinguish seborrheic keratosis from melanoma upon examination, or with [[dermatoscopy]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} 

Some advocate replacing enlarging with evolution. Certainly moles that change and evolve will be a concern. Alternatively, some practitioners prefer elevation. Elevation can help identify a melanoma, but lack of elevation does not mean that the lesion is not a melanoma. Most melanomas in the US are detected before they become elevated. By the time elevation is visible, they may have progressed to the more dangerous invasive stage.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

=== Ugly duckling ===
A recent and novel method is the "ugly duckling sign".&lt;ref name="pmid9828892"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mascaro JM, Mascaro JM |title=The dermatologist's position concerning nevi: a vision ranging from "the ugly duckling" to "little red riding hood" |journal=Arch Dermatol |volume=134 |issue=11 |pages=1484–85 |date=November 1998 |pmid=9828892 |doi=10.1001/archderm.134.11.1484}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  It is simple, easy to teach, and highly effective. Correlation of common lesion characteristics is made. Lesions that greatly deviate from the common characteristics are labeled an "Ugly Duckling", and a further professional exam is required. The "Little Red Riding Hood" sign&lt;ref name="pmid9828892" /&gt; suggests that individuals with fair skin and light-colored hair might have difficult-to-diagnose [[amelanotic melanomas]]. Extra care is required when examining such individuals, as they might have multiple melanomas and severely [[dysplastic]] [[nevi]]. A dermatoscope must be used to detect "ugly ducklings", as many melanomas in these individuals resemble non-melanomas or are considered to be "wolves in sheep's clothing".&lt;ref name="dermnetnz.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dermnetnz.org/doctors/dermoscopy-course/introduction.html|title=Introduction to Dermoscopy|publisher=DermNet New Zealand|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090507183545/http://dermnetnz.org/doctors/dermoscopy-course/introduction.html|archivedate=2009-05-07|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These fair-skinned individuals often have lightly pigmented or amelanotic melanomas that do not present easy-to-observe color changes and variations. Their borders are often indistinct, complicating visual identification without a dermatoscope.

Amelanotic melanomas and melanomas arising in fair-skinned individuals are very difficult to detect, as they fail to show many of the characteristics in the ABCD rule, break the "Ugly Duckling" sign and are hard to distinguish from acne scarring, insect bites, [[Benign fibrous histiocytoma|dermatofibromas]], or [[Lentigo|lentigines]].

=== Biopsy ===
Following a visual examination and a dermatoscopic exam,&lt;ref name="dermnetnz.org" /&gt; or ''[[in vivo]]'' diagnostic tools such as a confocal microscope, the doctor may [[biopsy]] the suspicious mole. A [[skin biopsy]] performed under [[local anesthesia]] is often required to assist in making or confirming the diagnosis and in defining severity. Elliptical excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, followed by [[histological]] analysis and Breslow scoring. Incisional biopsies such as [[Skin biopsy#Punch biopsy|punch biopsies]] are usually contraindicated in suspected melanomas, because of the possibility of sampling error&lt;ref name="pmid19155361"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Montgomery BD, Sadler GM |title=Punch biopsy of pigmented lesions is potentially hazardous |journal=Can Fam Physician |volume=55 |issue=1 |page=24 |date=January 2009 |pmid=19155361 |pmc=2628830}}&lt;/ref&gt; or local implantation causing misestimation of tumour thickness.&lt;ref name="pmid25827527"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Luk PP, Vilain R, Crainic O, McCarthy SW, Thompson JF, Scolyer RA |title=Punch biopsy of melanoma causing tumour cell implantation: another peril of utilising partial biopsies for melanocytic tumours |journal=Australas J Dermatol |volume=56 |issue=3 |pages=227–31 |date=August 2015 |pmid=25827527 |doi=10.1111/ajd.12333}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid22471244"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lin SW, Kaye V, Goldfarb N, Rawal A, Warshaw E |title=Melanoma tumor seeding after punch biopsy |journal=Dermatol Surg |volume=38 |issue=7 pt 1 |pages=1083–85 |date=July 2012 |pmid=22471244 |doi=10.1111/j.1524-4725.2012.02384.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, fears that such biopsies may increase the risk of metastatic disease seem unfounded.&lt;ref name="pmid16307945"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Martin RC 2nd, Scoggins CR, Ross MI, Reintgen DS, Noyes RD, Edwards MJ, McMasters KM |title=Is incisional biopsy of melanoma harmful? |journal=Am J Surg |volume=190 |issue=6 |pages=913–17 |date=December 2005 |pmid=16307945 |doi=10.1016/j.amjsurg.2005.08.020}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid24665419"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Yamashita Y, Hashimoto I, Abe Y, Seike T, Okawa K, Senzaki Y, Murao K, Kubo Y, Nakanishi H |title=Effect of biopsy technique on the survival rate of malignant melanoma patients |journal=Arch Plast Surg |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=122–25 |date=March 2014 |pmid=24665419 |doi=10.5999/aps.2014.41.2.122 |pmc=3961608}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Total body photography, which involves photographic documentation of as much body surface as possible, is often used during follow-up for high-risk patients. The technique has been reported to enable early detection and provides a cost-effective approach (with any digital camera), but its efficacy has been questioned due to its inability to detect macroscopic changes.&lt;ref name="ap01" /&gt; The diagnosis method should be used in conjunction with (and not as a replacement for) dermoscopic imaging, with a combination of both methods appearing to give extremely high rates of detection.

===Classification===

* [[Uveal melanoma]]
* [[Vaginal melanoma]]

===Laboratory===
[[Lactate dehydrogenase]] (LDH) tests are often used to screen for [[metastasis|metastases]], although many patients with metastases (even end-stage) have a normal LDH; extraordinarily high LDH often indicates metastatic spread of the disease to the liver.

It is common for patients diagnosed with melanoma to have chest X-rays and an LDH test, and in some cases [[computed tomography|CT]], [[MRI]], [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] and/or PET/CT scans. Although controversial, [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsies and examination of the [[lymph node]]s are also performed in patients to assess spread to the lymph nodes. A diagnosis of melanoma is supported by the presence of the [[S-100 protein]] marker.

[[HMB-45]] is a monoclonal antibody that reacts against an antigen present in melanocytic tumors such as melanomas. It is used in anatomic pathology as a marker for such tumors.  The antibody was generated to an extract of melanoma. It reacts positively against melanocytic tumors but not other tumors, thus demonstrating specificity and sensitivity. The antibody also reacts positively against junctional nevus cells but not intradermal nevi, and against fetal melanocytes but not normal adult melanocytes.

HMB-45 is nonreactive with almost all non-melanoma human malignancies, with the exception of rare tumors showing evidence of melanogenesis (e.g., pigmented schwannoma, clear cell sarcoma) or tumors associated with tuberous sclerosis complex (angiomyolipoma and lymphangiomyoma).

===Staging===
''Further context on [[cancer staging]] is available at [[TNM staging system|TNM]].''

Also of importance are the "[[Clark level]]" and "[[Breslow's depth]]", which refer to the microscopic depth of tumor invasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Malignant Melanoma: staging |date=1 September 2006 |website=Collaborative Hypertext of Radiology |publisher=Medical College of Wisconsin |url=http://chorus.rad.mcw.edu/doc/00955.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718150647/http://chorus.rad.mcw.edu/doc/00955.html |archivedate=2010-07-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==

===Avoiding ultraviolet radiation===
Minimizing exposure to sources of ultraviolet radiation (the sun and sunbeds),&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Autier P | title = Cutaneous malignant melanoma: facts about sunbeds and sunscreen | journal = Expert Rev Anticancer Ther | volume = 5 | issue = 5 | pages = 821–33 | year = 2005 | pmid = 16221052 | doi = 10.1586/14737140.5.5.821}}&lt;/ref&gt; following sun protection measures and wearing [[sun protective clothing]] (long-sleeved shirts, long trousers, and broad-brimmed hats) can offer protection.

Using artificial light for tanning was once believed to help prevent skin cancers, but it can actually lead to an increased incidence of melanomas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clough-Gorr KM, Titus-Ernstoff L, Perry AE, Spencer SK, Ernstoff MS |title=Exposure to sunlamps, tanning beds, and melanoma risk |journal=Cancer Causes Control |volume=19 |issue=7 |pages=659–69|date=September 2008 |pmid=18273687 |doi=10.1007/s10552-008-9129-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UV nail lamps, which are used in nail salons to dry nail polish, are another common and widespread source of UV radiation that could be avoided.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Shihab N, Lim HW | title = Potential cutaneous carcinogenic risk of exposure to UV nail lamp: A review | journal = Photodermatology, Photoimmunology &amp; Photomedicine | volume = 34 | issue = 6 | pages = 362–365 | date = November 2018 | pmid = 29882991 | doi = 10.1111/phpp.12398 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = O'Sullivan NA, Tait CP | title = Tanning bed and nail lamp use and the risk of cutaneous malignancy: a review of the literature | journal = The Australasian Journal of Dermatology | volume = 55 | issue = 2 | pages = 99–106 | date = May 2014 | pmid = 24592921 | doi = 10.1111/ajd.12145 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the risk of developing skin cancer through UV nail lamp use is low, it is still recommended to wear fingerless gloves and/or apply SPF 30 or greater sunscreen to the hands before using a UV nail lamp.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The body uses UV light to generate [[vitamin D]] so there is a need to balance getting enough sunlight to maintain healthy vitamin D levels and reducing the risk of melanoma; it takes around a half hour of sunlight for the body to generate its vitamin D for the day and this is about the same amount of time it takes for fair-skinned people to get a sunburn.  Exposure to sunlight can be intermittent instead of all at one time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Greinert R, de Vries E, Erdmann F, Espina C, Auvinen A, Kesminiene A, Schüz J | title = European Code against Cancer 4th Edition: Ultraviolet radiation and cancer | journal = Cancer Epidemiology | volume = 39 Suppl 1 | issue = Suppl 1 | pages = S75–83 | date = December 2015 | pmid = 26096748 | doi = 10.1016/j.canep.2014.12.014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sunscreen also protects against [[squamous cell carcinoma]], another skin cancer.&lt;ref name="SunS"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Burnett M.E. |author2=Wang S.Q. | title = Current sunscreen controversies: a critical review | journal = Photodermatology, Photoimmunology &amp; Photomedicine | volume = 27 | issue = 2 | pages = 58–67 |date=April 2011 |pmid = 21392107 | doi = 10.1111/j.1600-0781.2011.00557.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerns have been raised that sunscreen might create a false sense of security against sun damage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Planta MB | title = Sunscreen and melanoma: is our prevention message correct? | journal = Journal of the American Board of Family Medicine | volume = 24 | issue = 6 | pages = 735–9 | date = 2011-11-01 | pmid = 22086817 | doi = 10.3122/jabfm.2011.06.100178 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medications ===
A 2005 review found tentative evidence that [[statin]] and [[fibrate]] medication may decrease the risk of melanoma.&lt;ref name="Dell2005"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dellavalle RP, Drake A, Graber M, Heilig LF, Hester EJ, Johnson KR, McNealy K, Schilling L | title = Statins and fibrates for preventing melanoma | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 4 | pages = CD003697 | date = October 2005 | pmid = 16235336 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD003697.pub2 | url = http://www.cochrane.org/CD003697/SKIN_currently-there-is-no-clear-evidence-that-cholesterol-drugs-reduce-melanoma-risk. }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 review however did not support any benefit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Freeman SR, Drake AL, Heilig LF, Graber M, McNealy K, Schilling LM, Dellavalle RP | title = Statins, fibrates, and melanoma risk: a systematic review and meta-analysis | journal = Journal of the National Cancer Institute | volume = 98 | issue = 21 | pages = 1538–46 | date = November 2006 | pmid = 17077356 | doi = 10.1093/jnci/djj412 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==
[[File:Malignant melanoma on chest.jpg|thumb|Extensive malignant melanoma on a person's chest]]
Confirmation of the clinical diagnosis is done with a [[skin biopsy]]. This is usually followed up with a wider excision of the scar or tumor. Depending on the stage, a [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsy may be performed. Controversy exists around trial evidence for sentinel lymph node biopsy;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/sentinel-node-biopsy/sentinel-node-biopsy-false-positivity/ |title=The Sentinel Node Biopsy Procedure in Melanoma does not offer a survival advantage |publisher=Malignant Melanoma |date=2008-01-08 |access-date=2012-08-13 |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711150413/http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/sentinel-node-biopsy/sentinel-node-biopsy-false-positivity/ |archive-date=2012-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; with unclear evidence of benefit as of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kyrgidis A, Tzellos T, Mocellin S, Apalla Z, Lallas A, Pilati P, Stratigos A | title = Sentinel lymph node biopsy followed by lymph node dissection for localised primary cutaneous melanoma | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 5 | pages = CD010307 | date = May 2015 | pmid = 25978975 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010307.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment of advanced malignant melanoma is performed from a multidisciplinary approach.

===Surgery===

Excisional biopsies may remove the tumor, but further surgery is often necessary to reduce the risk of recurrence. Complete surgical excision with adequate [[surgical margin]]s and assessment for the presence of detectable metastatic disease along with short- and long-term followup is standard. Often this is done by a [[wide local excision]] (WLE) with {{convert|1-2|cm|1|abbr=on}} margins. Melanoma-in-situ and lentigo malignas are treated with narrower surgical margins, usually {{convert|0.2-0.5|cm|1|abbr=on}}. Many surgeons consider {{convert|0.5|cm|1|abbr=on}} the standard of care for standard excision of melanoma-in-situ,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Clark GS, Pappas-Politis EC, Cherpelis BS, Messina JL, Möller MG, Cruse CW, Glass LF | title = Surgical management of melanoma in situ on chronically sun-damaged skin | journal = Cancer Control | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 216–24 | date = July 2008 | pmid = 18596673 | doi = 10.1177/107327480801500304 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but {{convert|0.2|cm|1|abbr=on}} margin might be acceptable for margin controlled surgery ([[Mohs surgery]], or the double-bladed technique with margin control). The wide excision aims to reduce the rate of tumor recurrence at the site of the original lesion. This is a common pattern of treatment failure in melanoma. Considerable research has aimed to elucidate appropriate margins for excision with a general trend toward less aggressive treatment during the last decades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balch CM, Urist MM, Karakousis CP, Smith TJ, Temple WJ, Drzewiecki K, Jewell WR, Bartolucci AA, Mihm MC, Barnhill R | title = Efficacy of 2-cm surgical margins for intermediate-thickness melanomas (1 to 4 mm).

Melanomas that spread usually do so to the [[lymph nodes]] in the area of the tumor before spreading elsewhere. Attempts to improve survival by removing lymph nodes surgically ([[lymphadenectomy]]) were associated with many complications, but no overall survival benefit. Recently, the technique of [[sentinel lymph node]] biopsy has been developed to reduce the complications of lymph node surgery while allowing assessment of the involvement of nodes with tumor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/surgery/lymph-node-dissection-surgery/ |title=The Screening and Surveillance of Ultrasound in Melanoma trial (SUNMEL) |publisher= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090106181514/http://www.malignant-melanoma.org/surgery/lymph-node-dissection-surgery/ |archivedate=2009-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sentinel lymph node biopsy is often performed, especially for T1b/T2+ tumors, mucosal tumors, ocular melanoma and tumors of the limbs.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}} A process called [[lymphoscintigraphy]] is performed in which a radioactive tracer is injected at the tumor site to localize the sentinel node(s). Further precision is provided using a blue tracer [[dye]], and surgery is performed to biopsy the node(s). Routine [[H&amp;E stain|hematoxylin and eosin]] (H&amp;E) and [[immunoperoxidase]] staining will be adequate to rule out node involvement. [[Polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR) tests on nodes, usually performed to test for entry into clinical trials, now demonstrate that many patients with a negative sentinel lymph node actually had a small number of positive cells in their nodes. Alternatively, a [[fine-needle aspiration]] biopsy may be performed and is often used to test masses.

If a lymph node is positive, depending on the extent of lymph node spread, a radical lymph node dissection will often be performed. If the disease is completely resected, the patient will be considered for adjuvant therapy.
Excisional [[skin biopsy]] is the management of choice. Here, the suspect lesion is totally removed with an adequate (but minimal, usually 1 or 2&amp;nbsp;mm) ellipse of surrounding skin and tissue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Swanson N, Lee K, Gorman A, Lee H | title = Biopsy techniques. Diagnosis of melanoma | journal = Intensive 2011: The Third International Conference on Resource Intensive Applications and Services | volume = 20 | issue = 4 |pages = 677–80 | year = 2002 | pmid = 12380054 | doi = 10.1016/S0733-8635(02)00025-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To avoid disruption of the local lymphatic drainage, the preferred surgical margin for the initial biopsy should be narrow (1&amp;nbsp;mm). The biopsy should include the epidermal, dermal, and subcutaneous layers of the skin. This enables the [[pathology|histopathologist]] to determine the thickness of the melanoma by microscopic examination. This is described by [[Breslow's thickness]] (measured in millimeters). However, for large lesions, such as suspected lentigo maligna, or for lesions in surgically difficult areas (face, toes, fingers, eyelids), a small punch biopsy in representative areas will give adequate information and will not disrupt the final staging or depth determination. In no circumstances should the initial biopsy include the final surgical margin (0.5&amp;nbsp;cm, 1.0&amp;nbsp;cm, or 2&amp;nbsp;cm), as a misdiagnosis can result in excessive scarring and [[morbidity]] from the procedure. A large initial excision will disrupt the local lymphatic drainage and can affect further lymphangiogram-directed lymphnode dissection. A small punch biopsy can be used at any time where for logistical and personal reasons a patient refuses more invasive excisional biopsy. Small punch biopsies are minimally invasive and heal quickly, usually without noticeable scarring.

===Add on treatment===
High-risk melanomas may require [[adjuvant therapy|adjuvant]] treatment, although attitudes to this vary in different countries. In the United States, most patients in otherwise good health will begin up to a year of high-dose [[interferon]] treatment, which has severe side effects, but may improve the patient's prognosis slightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kirkwood JM, Strawderman MH, Ernstoff MS, Smith TJ, Borden EC, Blum RH | title = Interferon alfa-2b adjuvant therapy of high-risk resected cutaneous melanoma: the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group Trial EST 1684 | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 14 | issue = 1 | pages = 7–17 | date = January 1996 | pmid = 8558223 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.1996.14.1.7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[British Association of Dermatologists]] guidelines on melanoma state that interferon is not recommended as a standard adjuvant treatment for melanoma.&lt;ref name="Dermatologists' Management Guidelines"&gt;{{cite book|last=English|title=British Association of Dermatologists' management guidelines|year=2010|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell |isbn=978-1-4443-3552-1|url=http://as.wiley.com/WileyCDA/WileyTitle/productCd-1444335529,descCd-buy.html|editor1=Neil H.

===Lentigo maligna===

Standard excision is still being done by most surgeons. Unfortunately, the recurrence rate is exceedingly high (up to 50%). This is due to the ill-defined visible surgical margin, and the facial location of the lesions (often forcing the surgeon to use a narrow surgical margin). The narrow surgical margin used, combined with the limitation of the standard "bread-loafing" technique of fixed tissue histology – result in a high "false negative" error rate, and frequent recurrences. Margin control (peripheral margins) is necessary to eliminate the false negative errors. If [[bread loafing]] is used, distances from sections should approach 0.1&amp;nbsp;mm to assure that the method approaches complete margin control. A meta-analysis of the literature in 2014 found no randomized controlled trials of surgical interventions to treat lentigo maligna or melanoma in-situ, even though surgery is the most widely used treatment.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Tzellos T, Kyrgidis A, Mocellin S, Chan AW, Pilati P, Apalla Z | title = Interventions for melanoma in situ, including lentigo maligna | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | issue = 12 | pages = CD010308 | date = December 2014 | pmid = 25526608 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD010308.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some melanocytic nevi, and melanoma-in-situ ([[lentigo maligna]]) have resolved with an experimental treatment,  [[imiquimod]] (Aldara) topical cream, an immune enhancing agent. Some dermasurgeons are combining the 2 methods: surgically excising the cancer and then treating the area with Aldara cream postoperatively for three months. While some studies have suggested the adjuvant use of topical tazarotene, the current evidence is insufficient to recommend it and suggests that it increases topical inflammation, leading to lower patient compliance.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

[[Radiation therapy]] is often used after surgical resection for patients with locally or regionally advanced melanoma or for patients with unresectable distant metastases. Kilovoltage x-ray beams are often used for these treatments and have the property of the maximum radiation dose occurring close to the skin surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hill R, Healy B, Holloway L, Kuncic Z, Thwaites D, Baldock C | title = Advances in kilovoltage x-ray beam dosimetry | journal = Physics in Medicine and Biology | volume = 59 | issue = 6 | pages = R183–231 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 24584183 | doi = 10.1088/0031-9155/59/6/r183 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may reduce the rate of local recurrence but does not prolong survival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bastiaannet E, Beukema JC, Hoekstra HJ | title = Radiation therapy following lymph node dissection in melanoma patients: treatment, outcome and complications | journal = Cancer Treatment Reviews | volume = 31 | issue = 1 | pages = 18–26 | date = February 2005 | pmid = 15707701 | doi = 10.1016/j.ctrv.2004.09.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Radioimmunotherapy]] of metastatic melanoma is currently under investigation.

==Prognosis==
[[File:Diagram showing the most common places for melanoma to spread to CRUK 312.svg|thumb|A diagram showing the most common sites for melanoma to spread]]
[[File:5YearSurvival2008to14.jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|5 year relative survival by stage at diagnosis for melanoma of the skin in the United States as of 2014]]
Features that affect [[prognosis]] are [[tumor]] thickness in millimeters ([[Breslow's depth]]), depth related to skin structures ([[Clark level]]), type of melanoma, presence of ulceration, presence of lymphatic/[[perineural invasion]], presence of tumor-infiltrating [[lymphocyte]]s (if present, prognosis is better), location of lesion, presence of satellite lesions, and presence of regional or distant [[metastasis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |vauthors=Homsi J, Kashani-Sabet M, Messina J, Daud A |title=Cutaneous melanoma: prognostic factors |journal=Cancer Control |volume=12 |issue=4 |pages=223–29 |year=2005 |pmid=16258493 |url=https://www.moffitt.usf.edu/pubs/ccj/v12n4/pdf/223.pdf |archive-url=https://wayback.archive-it.org/all/20080216112052/https://www.moffitt.usf.edu/pubs/ccj/v12n4/pdf/223.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-02-16 |format=PDF |df= |doi=10.1177/107327480501200403 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Certain types of melanoma have worse prognoses but this is explained by their [[Breslow's depth|thickness]]. Less invasive melanomas even with lymph node metastases carry a better prognosis than deep melanomas without regional metastasis at time of staging. Local recurrences tend to behave similarly to a primary unless they are at the site of a [[wide local excision]] (as opposed to a staged excision or punch/shave excision) since these recurrences tend to indicate lymphatic invasion.

When melanomas have spread to the [[lymph node]]s, one of the most important factors is the number of nodes with malignancy. Extent of malignancy within a node is also important; micrometastases in which malignancy is only microscopic have a more favorable prognosis than macrometastases. In some cases micrometastases may only be detected by special staining, and if malignancy is only detectable by a rarely employed test known as the [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), the prognosis is better. Macrometastases in which malignancy is clinically apparent (in some cases cancer completely replaces a node) have a far worse prognosis, and if nodes are matted or if there is extracapsular extension, the prognosis is worse still. In addition to these variables, expression levels and copy number variations of a number of relevant genes may be used to support assessment of malignant melanoma prognosis.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = van Kempen LC, Redpath M, Robert C, Spatz A | title = Molecular pathology of cutaneous melanoma | journal = Melanoma Management | volume = 1 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–164 | date = November 2014 | pmid = 30190820 | pmc = 6094595 | doi = 10.2217/mmt.14.23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brunner13"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Brunner G, Reitz M, Heinecke A, Lippold A, Berking C, Suter L, Atzpodien J | title = A nine-gene signature predicting clinical outcome in cutaneous melanoma | journal = Journal of Cancer Research and Clinical Oncology | volume = 139 | issue = 2 | pages = 249–58 | date = February 2013 | pmid = 23052696 | doi = 10.1007/s00432-012-1322-z }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When there is distant metastasis, the cancer is generally considered incurable. The five-year survival rate is less than 10%.&lt;ref name="AJCC"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Balch CM, Buzaid AC, Soong SJ, Atkins MB, Cascinelli N, Coit DG, Fleming ID, Gershenwald JE, Houghton A, Kirkwood JM, McMasters KM, Mihm MF, Morton DL, Reintgen DS, Ross MI, Sober A, Thompson JA, Thompson JF | title = Final version of the American Joint Committee on Cancer staging system for cutaneous melanoma | journal = Journal of Clinical Oncology | volume = 19 | issue = 16 | pages = 3635–48 | date = August 2001 | pmid = 11504745 | doi = 10.1200/JCO.2001.19.16.3635 | url = http://www.jco.org/cgi/content/full/19/16/3635 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.475.6560 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060305151011/http://www.jco.org/cgi/content/full/19/16/3635 | df =  | deadurl = no | archive-date = 2006-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The median survival is 6–12 months. Treatment is [[Palliative care|palliative]], focusing on life extension and [[quality of life]]. In some cases, patients may live many months or even years with metastatic melanoma (depending on the aggressiveness of the treatment). Metastases to skin and lungs have a better prognosis. Metastases to brain, bone and liver are associated with a worse prognosis. Survival is better with metastasis in which the location of the primary tumor is unknown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bae JM, Choi YY, Kim DS, Lee JH, Jang HS, Lee JH, Kim H, Oh BH, Roh MR, Nam KA, Chung KY | title = Metastatic melanomas of unknown primary show better prognosis than those of known primary: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies | journal = Journal of the American Academy of Dermatology | volume = 72 | issue = 1 | pages = 59–70 | date = January 2015 | pmid = 25440435 | doi = 10.1016/j.jaad.2014.09.029 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is not enough definitive evidence to adequately stage, and thus give a prognosis for, ocular melanoma and melanoma of soft parts, or mucosal melanoma (e.g. rectal melanoma), although these tend to metastasize more easily. Even though regression may increase survival, when a melanoma has regressed, it is impossible to know its original size and thus the original tumor is often worse than a [[Pathology|pathology report]] might indicate.

About 200 genes are prognostic in melanoma, with both unfavorable genes where high expression is correlated to poor survival and favorable genes where high expression is associated with longer survival times. Examples of unfavorable genes are [[MCM6]] and [[Timeless (gene)|TIMELESS]] and an example of a favorable gene is [[WIPI1]].&lt;ref name="proteinatlas.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Uhlen eaan2507"/&gt;

Globally, in 2012, melanoma occurred in 232,000 people and resulted in 55,000 deaths.&lt;ref name=WCR2014/&gt; Australia and New Zealand have the highest rates of melanoma in the world.&lt;ref name=WCR2014/&gt; It has become more common in the last 20 years in areas that are mostly [[White people|Caucasian]].&lt;ref name=WCR2014/&gt;

The rate of melanoma has increased in the recent years, but it is not clear to what extent changes in behavior, in the environment, or in early detection are involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Berwick M, Wiggins C | title = The current epidemiology of cutaneous malignant melanoma | journal = Front Biosci | volume = 11 | pages = 1244–54 | year = 2006| pmid = 16368510 | doi = 10.2741/1877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
[[Australia]] has a very high – and increasing – rate of melanoma. In 2012, deaths from melanoma occurred in 7.3–9.8 per 100,000 population. In Australia, melanoma is the third most common cancer in either sex; indeed, its incidence is higher than for [[lung cancer]], although the latter accounts for more deaths. It is estimated that in 2012, more than 12,000 Australians were diagnosed with melanoma: given Australia's modest population, this is better expressed as 59.6 new cases per 100,000 population per year; &gt;1 in 10 of all new cancer cases were melanomas.&lt;ref name="aihw2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aihw.gov.au/cancer/cancer-in-australia-overview-2012/|title=Cancer in Australia: an overview 2012|publisher=AIHW|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140602195619/http://aihw.gov.au/cancer/cancer-in-australia-overview-2012/|archivedate=2014-06-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Melanoma incidence in Australia is matter of significance, for the following reasons: 
* Australian melanoma incidence has increased by more than 30 per cent between 1991 and 2009. 
* Australian melanoma age-standardised incidence rates were, as of 2008, at least 12 times higher than the world average.
* Australian melanoma incidence is, by some margin, the highest in the world. 
* Overall age-standardised cancer incidence in Australia is the highest in the world, and this is attributable to melanoma alone. Age-standardised overall cancer incidence is similar to New Zealand, but there is a statistically-significant difference between Australia and all other parts of the developed world including North America, Western Europe, and the Mediterranean.

===United States===
In the United States about 9,000 people die from melanoma a year.&lt;ref name=Vital2015/&gt; In 2011 it affected 19.7 per 100,000, and resulted in death in 2.7 per 100,000.&lt;ref name="Vital2015"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Guy GP, Thomas CC, Thompson T, Watson M, Massetti GM, Richardson LC |title=Vital signs: melanoma incidence and mortality trends and projections – United States, 1982–2030 |journal=MMWR Morb.

In 2013:
* 71,943 people in the United States were diagnosed with melanomas of the skin, including 42,430 men and 29,513 women.
* 9,394 people in the United States died from melanomas of the skin, including 6,239 men and 3,155 women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/statistics/|title=CDC – Skin Cancer Statistics|website=www.cdc.gov |access-date=2017-04-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410214142/https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/statistics/|archivedate=2017-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The American Cancer Society’s estimates for melanoma incidence in the United States for 2017 are:
* About 87,110 new melanomas will be diagnosed (about 52,170 in men and 34,940 in women).
* About 9,730 people are expected to die of melanoma (about 6,380 men and 3,350 women).
Melanoma is more than 20 times more common in whites than in African Americans. Overall, the lifetime risk of getting melanoma is about 2.5% (1 in 40) for whites, 0.1% (1 in 1,000) for African Americans, and 0.5% (1 in 200) for Hispanics.

The risk of melanoma increases as people age. The average age of people when the disease is diagnosed is 63.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cancer.org/cancer/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html|title=Key Statistics for Melanoma Skin Cancer|website=www.cancer.org|access-date=2017-04-10|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170410135926/https://www.cancer.org/cancer/melanoma-skin-cancer/about/key-statistics.html|archivedate=2017-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{see also|Timeline of melanoma}}
Although melanoma is not a new disease, evidence for its occurrence in antiquity is rather scarce. However, one example lies in a 1960s examination of nine [[Peru]]vian mummies, [[radiocarbon]] dated to be approximately 2400 years old, which showed apparent signs of melanoma: melanotic masses in the skin and diffuse metastases to the bones.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name="urteaga"&gt;{{Cite journal|vauthors=Urteaga O, Pack G | title = On the antiquity of melanoma | journal = Cancer | volume = 19 | issue = 5 | pages = 607–10 | year = 1966 | pmid = 5326247 | doi = 10.1002/1097-0142(196605)19:5&lt;607::AID-CNCR2820190502&gt;3.0.CO;2-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] is reported to be the first to operate on metastatic melanoma in 1787. Although not knowing precisely what it was, he described it as a "cancerous fungous excrescence". The excised tumor was preserved in the [[Hunterian and Wellcome Museums|Hunterian Museum]] of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]]. It was not until 1968 that microscopic examination of the specimen revealed it to be an example of metastatic melanoma.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name="bodenham"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Bodenham D | title = A study of 650 observed malignant melanomas in the South-West region | journal = Annals of the Royal College of Surgeons of England | volume = 43 | issue = 4 | pages = 218–39 | year = 1968 | pmid = 5698493 | pmc = 2312310}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French physician [[René Laennec]] was the first to describe melanoma as a disease entity. His report was initially presented during a lecture for the Faculté de Médecine de Paris in 1804 and then published as a bulletin in 1806.&lt;!--
  --&gt;&lt;ref name="laennec"&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Laennec RTH | year = 1806 | title = Sur les melanoses | journal = Bulletin de la Faculte de Medecine de Paris | volume = 1 | pages = 24–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The first English language report of melanoma was presented by an English general practitioner from Stourbridge, William Norris in 1820.&lt;ref name="norris1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Norris W | title = Case of Fungoid Disease | journal = Edinburgh Medical and Surgical Journal | volume = 16 | issue = 65 | pages = 562–565 | date = October 1820 | pmid = 30332089 | pmc = 5830209 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In his later work in 1857 he remarked that there is a familial predisposition for development of melanoma (''Eight Cases of [[Melanosis]] with Pathological and Therapeutical Remarks on That Disease''). Norris was also a pioneer in suggesting a link between nevi and melanoma and the possibility of a relationship between melanoma and environmental exposures, by observing that most of his patients had pale complexions.&lt;ref&gt;Norris W. Eight cases of Melanosis with pathological and therapeutical remarks on that disease. London: Longman; 1857.&lt;/ref&gt; He also described that melanomas could be amelanotic and later showed the metastatic nature of melanoma by observing that they can disseminate to other visceral organs.

The first formal acknowledgment of advanced melanoma as untreatable came from [[Samuel Cooper (surgeon)|Samuel Cooper]] in 1840. He stated that the only chance for a cure depends upon the early removal of the disease (i.e., early excision of the malignant mole) ...'&lt;ref name="cooper"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cooper|first=Samuel | name-list-format = vanc |title=The First Lines of the Theory and Practice of Surgery: Including the Principle Operations|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=hgE0AQAAMAAJ}}|year=1844|publisher=S.S. and W. Wood}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More than one and a half centuries later this situation remains largely unchanged.

===Terminology===
The word ''melanoma'' came to English from 19th-century [[New Latin]]&lt;ref name="MW_Collegiate"&gt;{{Citation |author=Merriam-Webster |authorlink=Merriam-Webster |title=Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary |publisher=Merriam-Webster |url=http://unabridged.merriam-webster.com/collegiate/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and uses [[classical compound|combining forms]] derived from [[ancient Greek]] roots: ''[[wikt:melano-#Prefix|melano-]]'' (denoting [[melanin]]) + ''[[wikt:-oma#Suffix|-oma]]'' (denoting a tissue mass and especially a [[neoplasm]]), in turn from [[Greek language|Greek]] [[wikt:μέλας|μέλας]] ''melas'', "dark",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dme%2Flas μέλας] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605183904/http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dme%2Flas |date=2011-06-05 }}, Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus&lt;/ref&gt; and [[wikt:-ωμα|-ωμα]] ''oma'', "process". The word ''melanoma'' has a long history of being used  [[word sense|in a broader sense]] to refer to any [[melanocytic tumor]], benign or malignant but usually malignant,&lt;ref name="Dorlands"&gt;{{Citation |author=Elsevier |authorlink=Elsevier |title=Dorland's Illustrated Medical Dictionary |publisher=Elsevier |url=http://dorlands.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AHD"&gt;{{Citation |author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |title=The American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language |publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt |url=https://ahdictionary.com/ |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; but today the narrower sense referring only to malignant types has become so dominant that benign tumors are usually not called melanomas anymore and the word ''melanoma'' is now usually taken to mean malignant melanoma unless otherwise specified. Terms such as "benign [[melanocytic tumor]]" unequivocally label the benign types, and modern histopathologic tumor classifications used in medicine do not use the word for benign tumors.

== Research ==

Pharmacotherapy research for unresectable or metastatic malignant melanoma is ongoing.&lt;ref name="melanoma2012"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Drugs in Clinical Development for Melanoma|journal=Pharmaceutical Medicine|date=23 December 2012|volume=26|issue=3|pages=171–83|doi=10.1007/BF03262391|url=http://adisonline.com/pharmaceuticalmedicine/Abstract/2012/26030/Drugs_in_Clinical_Development_for_Melanoma__.4.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Targeted therapies===

In clinical research setting other therapies, such as adoptive cell therapy or [[gene therapy]], are being tested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sotomayor M, Yu H, Antonia S, Sotomayor E, Pardoll D | title = Advances in gene therapy for malignant melanoma | journal = Cancer Control | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 39–48 | year = 2002| pmid = 11907465| doi = 10.1177/107327480200900106 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two kinds of experimental treatments developed at the [[National Cancer Institute]] (NCI), have been used in metastatic melanoma with tentative success.&lt;ref name="Hershkovitz10"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hershkovitz L, Schachter J, Treves AJ, Besser MJ |title=Focus on adoptive T cell transfer trials in melanoma |journal=Clin.

The first treatment involves adoptive cell therapy (ACT) using TILs immune cells (tumor infiltrating lymphocytes) isolated from a person's own melanoma tumor.&lt;ref name="Current_Future_Melanoma"/&gt; These cells are grown in large numbers in a laboratory and returned to the patient after a treatment that temporarily reduces normal T cells in the patient's body.

The second treatment, adoptive transfer of genetically altered autologous lymphocytes, depends on delivering genes that encode so called [[T cell receptor]]s (TCRs), into patient's lymphocytes.&lt;ref name="Current_Future_Melanoma"/&gt; After that manipulation lymphocytes recognize and bind to certain molecules found on the surface of melanoma cells and kill them.&lt;ref name="nih"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/aug2006/nci-31b.htm|title=New Method of Gene Therapy Alters Immune Cells for Treatment of Advanced Melanoma; Technique May Also Apply to Other Common Cancers|date=30 December 2015|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060928214625/http://www.nih.gov/news/pr/aug2006/nci-31b.htm|archivedate=28 September 2006|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===BRAF inhibitors===
About 60% of melanomas contain a mutation in the [[BRAF (gene)|B-Raf gene]]. Early clinical trials suggested that B-Raf inhibitors including Plexxicon's [[vemurafenib]] could lead to substantial tumor regression in a majority of patients if their tumor contain the B-Raf mutation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/health/research/22trial.html? | work=The New York Times | title=A Roller Coaster Chase for a Cure | first=Amy | last=Harmon | name-list-format = vanc | date=February 21, 2010 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170210085433/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/22/health/research/22trial.html | archivedate=February 10, 2017 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In June 2011, a large [[clinical trial]] confirmed the positive findings from those earlier trials.&lt;ref name="studies"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=New York Times|author=Andrew Pollack|date=June 5, 2011|title=Drugs Show Promise Slowing Advanced Melanoma|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/health/research/06melanoma.html|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170131105246/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/06/health/research/06melanoma.html|archivedate=January 31, 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid21639808"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Chapman PB, Hauschild A, Robert C, Haanen JB, Ascierto P, Larkin J, Dummer R, Garbe C, Testori A, Maio M, Hogg D, Lorigan P, Lebbe C, Jouary T, Schadendorf D, Ribas A, O'Day SJ, Sosman JA, Kirkwood JM, Eggermont AM, Dreno B, Nolop K, Li J, Nelson B, Hou J, Lee RJ, Flaherty KT, McArthur GA, ((BRIM-3 Study Group)) |title=Improved Survival with Vemurafenib in Melanoma with BRAF V600E Mutation|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|date=30 June 2011|volume=364|issue=26|pages=2507–16|doi=10.1056/NEJMoa1103782|pmid=21639808|pmc=3549296}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2011 Vemurafenib received FDA approval for the treatment of late-stage melanoma. In May 2013 the [[Food and Drug Administration|US FDA]] approved dabrafenib as a single agent treatment for patients with BRAF V600E mutation-positive advanced melanoma.&lt;ref name="r20150530"&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/30/us-glaxosmithkline-approvals-idUSBRE94S1A020130530 | title = GSK melanoma drugs add to tally of U.S. drug approvals | publisher = Reuters | date = May 30, 2013 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150924181713/http://www.reuters.com/article/2013/05/30/us-glaxosmithkline-approvals-idUSBRE94S1A020130530 | archivedate = September 24, 2015 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers believe that combination therapies that simultaneously block multiple pathways may improve efficacy by making it more difficult for the tumor cells to mutate before being destroyed. In October 2012 a study reported that combining Dabrafenib with a [[MEK inhibitor]] [[trametinib]] led to even better outcomes. Compared to Dabrafenib alone, progression-free survival was increased to 41% from 9%, and the median [[progression-free survival]] increased to 9.4 months versus 5.8 months. Some side effects were, however, increased in the combined study.

===Ipilimumab===
At the [[American Society of Clinical Oncology]] Conference in June 2010, the [[Bristol-Myers Squibb]] pharmaceutical company reported the clinical findings of their drug [[ipilimumab]]. The study found an increase in median survival from 6.4 to 10 months in patients with advanced melanomas treated with the monoclonal ipilimumab, versus an experimental vaccine. It also found a one-year survival rate of 25% in the control group using the vaccine, 44% in the vaccine and ipilimumab group, and 46% in the group treated with ipilimumab alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Bristol drug cuts death risk in advanced melanoma | url = https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0218461520100605 | work = Reuters | date = June 5, 2010 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20101109095301/http://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN0218461520100605 | archivedate = November 9, 2010 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some have raised concerns about this study for its use of the unconventional control arm, rather than comparing the drug against a placebo or standard treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/06/the-risk-for-bristol/ |title=The Risk For Bristol |work=Forbes |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110315041905/http://blogs.forbes.com/sciencebiz/2010/06/06/the-risk-for-bristol/ |archivedate=2011-03-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100609/Phase-3-clinical-study-Ipilimumab-boosts-sustains-immune-system-responses-against-melanoma-tumors.aspx |title=Phase 3 clinical study: Ipilimumab boosts, sustains immune system responses against melanoma tumors |publisher=News-medical.net |date=2010-06-09 |accessdate=2012-08-13 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121019003945/http://www.news-medical.net/news/20100609/Phase-3-clinical-study-Ipilimumab-boosts-sustains-immune-system-responses-against-melanoma-tumors.aspx |archivedate=2012-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The criticism was that although Ipilimumab performed better than the vaccine, the vaccine has not been tested before and may be causing toxicity, making the drug appear better by comparison.

Ipilimumab was approved by the FDA in March 2011 to treat patients with late-stage melanoma that has spread or cannot be removed by surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm1193237.htm |title=FDA approves new treatment for a type of late-stage skin cancer |author=Jefferson E |date=2011-03-25 |publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|U.S. Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) |accessdate=2011-03-25 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110327063147/http://www.fda.gov/NewsEvents/Newsroom/PressAnnouncements/ucm1193237.htm |archivedate=2011-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/business/26drug.html |title=Approval for Drug That Treats Melanoma |author=Pollack, Andrew |date=2011-03-25 |work=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=2011-03-27 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110401011816/http://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/26/business/26drug.html |archivedate=2011-04-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Drugs.com"&gt;Drugs.com: [https://www.drugs.com/yervoy.html Yervoy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110809231412/http://www.drugs.com/yervoy.html |date=2011-08-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, a clinical trial of ipilimumab plus [[dacarbazine]] combined this immune system booster with the standard chemotherapy drug that targets cell division. It showed an increase in median survival for these late stage patients to 11 months instead of the 9 months normally seen. Researchers were also hopeful that perhaps 10–20% of patients could live a long time. Some serious side-effects of revving up the immune system were seen in some patients. A course of treatment costs $120,000. The drug's brandname is Yervoy.&lt;ref name="studies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Robert C, Thomas L, Bondarenko I, etal |title=Ipilimumab plus dacarbazine for previously untreated metastatic melanoma |journal=N.

In some countries oncolytic virotherapy methods are studied and used to treat melanoma.

'''Metempsychosis''' ({{lang-grc-gre|μετεμψύχωσις}}) is a philosophical term in the [[Greek language]] referring to transmigration of the [[soul]], especially its [[reincarnation]] after death. Generally, the term is derived from the context of [[ancient Greek philosophy]], and has been recontextualised by modern philosophers such as [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]&lt;ref&gt;Schopenhauer, A: "Parerga und Paralipomena" (Eduard Grisebach edition), On Religion, Section 177&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Kurt Gödel]];&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goedelexhibition.at/goedel/goedel.html Gödel Exhibition: Gödel's Century&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; otherwise, the term "[[Reincarnation#Conceptual definitions|transmigration]]" is more appropriate.  The word plays a prominent role in [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' and is also associated with [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]].&lt;ref&gt;Nietzsche and the Doctrine of Metempsychosis, in J. Urpeth &amp; J. Lippitt, ''Nietzsche and the Divine'', Manchester: Clinamen, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Another term sometimes used synonymously is [[palingenesis]].

==Europe before the pre-Socratic philosophers==

It is unclear how the doctrine of metempsychosis arose in Greece. It is easiest to assume that earlier ideas which had never been extinguished were utilized for religious and philosophic purposes. The [[Orphism (religion)|Orphic religion]], which held it, first appeared in Thrace upon the semi-barbarous north-eastern frontier. [[Orpheus]], its legendary founder, is said to have taught that soul and body are united by a compact unequally binding on either; the soul is divine, immortal and aspires to freedom, while the body holds it in fetters as a prisoner. Death dissolves this compact, but only to re-imprison the liberated soul after a short time: for the wheel of birth revolves inexorably. Thus the soul continues its journey, alternating between a separate unrestrained existence and fresh reincarnation, round the wide circle of necessity, as the companion of many bodies of men and animals." To these unfortunate prisoners Orpheus proclaims the message of liberation, that they stand in need of the grace of redeeming gods and of [[Dionysus]] in particular, and calls them to turn to God by ascetic piety of life and self-purification: the purer their lives the higher will be their next reincarnation, until the soul has completed the spiral ascent of destiny to live for ever as a God from whom it comes. Such was the teaching of Orphism which appeared in Greece about the 6th century BC, organized itself into private and public mysteries at [[Eleusis]] and elsewhere, and produced a copious literature.&lt;ref&gt;Linforth, Ivan M. (1941) ''The Arts of Orpheus'' Arno Press, New York, {{OCLC|514515}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Herbert S. (1948) ''A Study of the doctrine of metempsychosis in Greece, from Pythagoras to Plato'' (Long's 1942 PhD dissertation) Princeton, New Jersey, {{OCLC|1472399}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Long, Herbert S. (16 February 1948) "Plato's Doctrine of Metempsychosis and Its Source" ''The Classical Weekly'' 41(10): pp. 149&amp;#151;155&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Greek philosophy==

The earliest Greek thinker with whom metempsychosis is connected is [[Pherecydes of Syros]];&lt;ref&gt;Schibli, S., Hermann, Pherekydes of Syros, p. 104, Oxford Univ. Press 2001&lt;/ref&gt; but [[Pythagoras]], who is said to have been his pupil, is its first famous philosophic exponent. Pythagoras is not believed to have invented the doctrine or to have imported it from Egypt. Instead he made his reputation by bringing the Orphic doctrine from North-Eastern Hellas to Magna Graecia, and creating societies for its diffusion.

The real weight and importance of metempsychosis in Western tradition is due to its adoption by [[Plato]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In the eschatological myth which closes the ''[[Republic (Plato)|Republic]]'' he tells the myth how Er, the son of Armenius, miraculously returned to life on the twelfth day after death and recounted the secrets of the other world. After death, he said, he went with others to the place of Judgment and saw the souls returning from heaven, and proceeded with them to a place where they chose new lives, human and animal. He saw the soul of Orpheus changing into a swan, Thamyras becoming a nightingale, musical birds choosing to be men, the soul of Atalanta choosing the honours of an athlete. Men were seen passing into animals and wild and tame animals changing into each other. After their choice the souls drank of [[Lethe]] and then shot away like stars to their birth. There are myths and theories to the same effect in other dialogues, the [[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]], [[Meno]], [[Phaedo]], [[Timaeus (dialogue)|Timaeus]] and [[Laws (dialogue)|Laws]]. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} In Plato's view the number of souls was fixed; birth therefore is never the creation of a soul, but only a transmigration from one body to another.&lt;ref&gt;"That is the conclusion, I said; and if a true conclusion, then the souls must always be the same, for if none be destroyed they will not diminish in number." Republic X, 611. The Republic of Plato By Plato, Benjamin Jowett Edition: 3 Published by Clarendon press, 1888.&lt;/ref&gt; Plato's acceptance of the doctrine is characteristic of his sympathy with popular beliefs and desire to incorporate them in a purified form into his system. {{Citation needed|date=February 2009}}
The extent of Plato's belief in metempsychosis has been debated by some scholars in modern times. [[Marsilio Ficino]] (''Platonic Theology'' 17.3–4), for one, argued that Plato's references to metempsychosis were intended allegorically.

In later Greek literature the doctrine appears from time to time; it is mentioned in a fragment of [[Menander]] (the Inspired Woman) and satirized by [[Lucian]] (Gallus 18 seq.). In [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] literature it is found as early as [[Ennius]],&lt;ref&gt;Poesch, Jessie (1962) "Ennius and Basinio of Parma" ''Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes'' 25(1/2): pp. 116&amp;#151;118, page 117, FN15&lt;/ref&gt; who in his Calabrian home must have been familiar with the Greek teachings which had descended to his times from the cities of Magna Graecia. In a lost passage of his Annals, a Roman history in verse, Ennius told how he had seen [[Homer]] in a dream, who had assured him that the same soul which had animated both the poets had once belonged to a peacock. [[Persius]] in one of his satires (vi. 9) laughs at Ennius for this: it is referred to also by [[Lucretius]] (i. 124) and by [[Horace]] (Epist. II. i. 52). [[Virgil]] works the idea into his account of the Underworld in the sixth book of the [[Aeneid]] (vv. 724 sqq.). It persists in antiquity down to the latest classic thinkers, [[Plotinus]] and the other [[Neoplatonist]]s.

== Post-Classical occurrence ==

Metempsychosis was a part of the Neo-[[Manichaean|Manichaen]] dogma of the [[Albigenses]] around France in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.therealpresence.org/archives/Heresies_Heretics/Heresies_Heretics_006.htm|title=Fr.

Created in the early XVth century, the [[Rosicrucianism|Rosicrucianist]] movement also conveyed an occult doctrine of metempsychosis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/sro/sdr/sdr11.htm Part X Metempsychosis], ''Sacred-texts.com''&lt;/ref&gt;

== In literature after the classical era ==
"Metempsychosis" is the title of a longer work by the metaphysical poet [[John Donne]], written in 1601.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Siobhán (2005) "Bodily Formations and Reading Strategies in John Donne's ''Metempsychosis''" ''Critical Studies'' 26: pp. 191&amp;#151;208, page 191&lt;/ref&gt; The poem, also known as the ''Infinitati Sacrum'',&lt;ref name="Donne"&gt;[http://www.luminarium.org/editions/metempsycosis.htm full text of ''Metempsychosis'' or ''Infinitati Sacrum''] from Luminarium Editions&lt;/ref&gt; consists of two parts, the "Epistle" and "The Progress of the Soule".  In the first line of the latter part, Donne writes that he "sing[s] of the progresse of a deathlesse soule".&lt;ref name="Donne" /&gt;

Metempsychosis is a prominent theme in [[Edgar Allan Poe]]'s 1832 short story "[[Metzengerstein]]".&lt;ref&gt;Bonaparte, Marie (1949) ''The life and works of Edgar Allan Poe: a psycho-analytic interpretation'' Imago, London, page 273, {{OCLC|1398764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poe returns to metempsychosis again in "Morella" (1835)&lt;ref&gt;Roderick, Phillip L. (2006) ''The Fall of the House of Poe: And Other Essays'' iUniverse, New York, [https://books.google.com/books?id=L3Xp39H4apQC&amp;pg=PA22 page 22], {{ISBN|0-595-39567-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "The Oval Portrait" (1842).&lt;ref&gt;Quinn, Patrick F. (1971) ''The French face of Edgar Poe'' (2nd edition) Southern Illinois University Press, Carbondale, Illinois, page 272, {{ISBN|0-8093-0500-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metempsychosis is referred to prominently in the concluding paragraph of Chapter 98, "Stowing Down and Clearing Up", of [[Herman Melville]]'s ''[[Moby-Dick]]''.

Metempsychosis is mentioned as the religion of choice by the minor character Princess Darya Alexandrovna Oblonsky in [[Leo Tolstoy]]’s ''[[Anna Karenina]]''.

[[Herbert Giles]] uses the term metempsychosis in his translation of the butterfly dream from the [[Zhuangzi (book)|''Zhuangzi'']] ({{zh|c=《莊子》}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Giles|first=Herbert|authorlink=Herbert Giles|title=Chuang Tzŭ: Mystic, Moralist, and Social Reformer|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vMNI-aFtF4UC|year=1889|publisher=B. Quaritch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of this term is contested by Hans Georg Möller ([[:de:Hans Georg Möller|de]]), though, who claims that a better translation is “the changing of things”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Möller|first=Hans Georg|authorlink=:de:Hans Georg Möller|title=Daoism Explained: From the Dream of the Butterfly to the Fishnet Allegory|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZzdrPwnXJ_kC|year=2011|publisher=Open Court|isbn=978-0-8126-9750-6|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Metempsychosis is a recurring theme in [[James Joyce]]'s [[modernism|modernist]] novel ''[[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]'' (1922).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rac101/concord/texts/ulysses/ulysses.cgi?word=Metempsychosis List of occurrences of Metempsychosis in Ulysses]&lt;/ref&gt; In Joycean fashion, the word famously appears in [[Leopold Bloom]]'s inner monologue, recalling how his wife, [[Molly Bloom]], apparently mispronounced it earlier that day as "met him pike hoses."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Joyce, ''Ulysses'', §8 [http://www.doc.ic.ac.uk/~rac101/concord/texts/ulysses/files/ulysses8.html#7285 Lestrygonians]&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Thomas Pynchon]]'s 1963 premiere novel ''[[V.]]'', metempsychosis is mentioned in reference to the book "The Search for [[Bridey Murphy]]" by Morey Bernstein, and also later in chapter eight.

Metempsychosis is referenced in [[Don DeLillo]]'s 1982 novel ''[[The Names (novel)|The Names.]]''

In [[David Foster Wallace]]'s 1996 novel ''[[Infinite Jest]]'', the name of the character Madame Psychosis is an intentional [[malapropism]] of metempsychosis.

[[Guy de Maupassant]]'s story "Le docteur Héraclius Gloss" (1875) is a fable about metempsychosis.

In [[Marcel Proust]]'s famous first paragraph from ''[[In Search of Lost Time]]'', the narrator compares his separation from the subject of a book to the process of metempsychosis.

In [[Robert Montgomery Bird]]'s fiction novel ''Sheppard Lee Written by Himself'' (1836) the protagonist is a serial identity thief by way of metempsychosis.

The eponymous Archy of [[Don Marquis|Don Marquis's]] ''[[archy and mehitabel]]'' poems is a cockroach with the transmigrated soul of a human [[vers libre]] poet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9445">In the [[philosophy of mind]], '''neutral monism''' is the view that the mental and the physical are two ways of organizing or describing the same elements, which are themselves "neutral", that is, neither physical nor mental.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Craig (philosopher)|Craig, Edward]]. (1998). ''Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. Routledge. p. 816. {{ISBN|0415-07310-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This view denies that the mental and the physical are two fundamentally different things. Rather, neutral monism claims the universe consists of only one kind of stuff, in the form of neutral elements that are in themselves neither mental nor physical.

== History ==
[[File:Dualism-vs-Monism.png|thumb|right|A diagram with neutral monism compared to Cartesian dualism, physicalism and idealism.]]
Neutral monism about the [[mind–body problem|mind–body relationship]] is described by [[C. D. Broad]] in one of his earlier works, ''The Mind and Its Place in Nature''. Broad's list of possible views about the mind-body problem, which became known simply as "Broad's famous list of 1925" (see chapter XIV of'),&lt;ref&gt;[[C. D. Broad|Broad, C. D]]. (1925) [http://www.ditext.com/broad/mpn.html ''The Mind and Its Place in Nature'']. London: Kegan Paul.&lt;/ref&gt; states the basis of what this theory had been and was to become. There are few self-proclaimed neutral monists; most of the philosophers who are seen to have this view were classified after their deaths. Some examples of this are [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[David Hume]], [[Ernst Mach]], [[Richard Avenarius]], [[Kenneth M. Sayre|Kenneth Sayre]] and [[Joseph Petzoldt]] and [[Jonathan Westphal]].

Earlier, [[William James]] had propounded the notion in his essay "Does [[Consciousness]] Exist?" in 1904 (reprinted in ''Essays in [[Radical Empiricism]]'' in 1912).&lt;ref&gt;[[William James|James, William]]. (1912). [https://archive.org/stream/essaysinradicale00jameuoft#page/n7/mode/2up ''Essays in Radical Empiricism]. New York: Longmans, Green, and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Whately Carington]] in his book ''Matter, Mind, and Meaning'' (1949) advocated a form of neutral monism. He held that mind and matter both consist of the same kind of components known as "cognita" or [[sense data]].&lt;ref&gt;[[C. D. Broad|Broad, C. D]]. (1950). ''Matter, Mind, and Meaning by W. Whately Carington. Philosophy''. Vol. 25, No. 94. pp. 275–277.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Grenell, R. G. (1953). ''Matter, Mind and Meaning by Whately Carington''. The Quarterly Review of Biology. Vol. 28, No. 4. pp. 404–405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Oakeshott, Michael; O'Sullivan, Luke. (2007). ''The Concept of a Philosophical Jurisprudence: Essays and Reviews 1926–51''. Imprint Academic. p. 286. {{ISBN|978-1845401801}} "The doctrine that Mr Carington comes to favour is a form of Neutral Monism: the common constituents of mind and matter are sense-data or cognita. In themselves these cognita are neither mental nor material."&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Stephen Stich]] and Ted Warfield, neutral monism has not been a popular view in philosophy as it is difficult to develop or understand the nature of the neutral elements.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stephen Stich|Stich, Stephen]]; Warfield, Ted. (2003). ''The Blackwell Guide to Philosophy of Mind''. Blackwell Publishing. pp. 20-21. {{ISBN|0-631-21774-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Bertrand Russell ==
&lt;!-- [[Russellian monism]] and [[Russellian monist]] redirect to here. --&gt;
In 1921, [[Bertrand Russell]] adopted a similar position to that of William James.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bertrand Russell|Russell, Bertrand]]. (1921). ''The Analysis of Mind''. London, G. Allen &amp; Unwin; New York, Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Russell quotes from James's essay "Does 'consciousness' exist?" as follows:
{{quote|"My thesis is," [James] says, "that if we start with the supposition that there is only one primal stuff or material in the world, a stuff of which everything is composed, and if we call that stuff 'pure experience,' then knowing can easily be explained as a particular sort of relation towards one another into which portions of pure experience may enter. The relation itself is a part of pure experience; one of its 'terms' becomes the subject or bearer of the knowledge, the knower, the other becomes the object known (p. 4)."&lt;ref&gt;r.e. "(p. 4)" see next footnotes about source of James's quote. The James quote appears at Russell 1921:10.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Russell summarizes this notion as follows:
{{quote|James's view is that the raw material out of which the world is built up is not of two sorts, one matter and the other mind, but that it is arranged in different patterns by its inter-relations, and that some arrangements may be called mental, while others may be called physical.&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1921:10&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Russell observes that the same view of "consciousness" is set forth in James's succeeding essay, "A World of Pure Experience" (''ib.'', pp.&amp;nbsp;39–91).&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1921:10. The ''ibid'' refers to footnote #5 on Russell 1921:9 with regards to the quotes from James derived from ''[[Journal of Philosophy, Psychology and Scientific Methods]]''{{'}}s," vol. i, 1904. Reprinted in "Essays in Radical Empiricism" (Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 1912), pp. 1–38.&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition to the role of James, Russell observes the role of two American Realists:
{{quote|the American realists [...] Professor [[R. B. Perry]] of Harvard and Mr. [[Edwin B. Holt]] [...] have derived a strong impulsion from James, but have more interest than he had in logic and mathematics and the abstract part of philosophy. They speak of "neutral" entities as the stuff out of which both mind and matter are constructed. Thus Holt says: "... perhaps the least dangerous name is neutral-stuff."&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1921:10–11&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Russell goes on to agree with James and in part with the "American realists": 
{{quote|My own belief – for which the reasons will appear in subsequent lectures – is that James is right in rejecting consciousness as an entity, and that the American realists are partly right, though not wholly, in considering that both mind and matter are composed of a neutral-stuff which, in isolation is neither mental nor material.&lt;ref&gt;Russell 1921:11&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== David Chalmers ==

[[David Chalmers]]&lt;ref&gt;Chalmers 1996: 293-301 "Is Experience Ubiquitous?" which includes subsections ''What is it like to be a thermostat?'', ''Whither pansychism?'', and ''Constraining the double-aspect principle''.&lt;/ref&gt; considers the consciousness of rocks as well as thermostats, although he eschews the notion that rocks are conscious:
{{quote|I do not think it is strictly accurate to say that rocks (for example) have experiences . . . although rocks may have experiences associated with them. ... Personally, I am much more confident of naturalistic dualism than I am of panpsychism. The latter issue seems to be very much open. But I hope to have said enough to show that we ought to take the possibility of some sort of panpsychism seriously: there seem to be no knockdown arguments against the view, and there are various positive reasons why one might embrace it. (Chalmers 1996:299)}}

In his 2002 "Consciousness and its Place in Nature", Chalmers carefully considers neutral monism and [[panpsychism]], variants of what he calls "Type-F Monism".&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2002:264-267"&gt;Chalmers 2002: 264-267&lt;/ref&gt; He admits that:
{{quote|The type-F view is admittedly speculative and it can sound strange at first hearing. Many find it extremely counterintuitive to suppose that fundamental physical systems have phenomenal properties: e.g. that there is something it is like to be an electron.&lt;ref name="Chalmers 2002:264-267" /&gt;}}

The '''''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate transporter''' '''(AbgT) family''' ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.68 TC# 2.A.68]) is a family of transporter proteins belonging to the [[Ion transporter|ion transporter (IT) superfamily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Prakash S, Cooper G, Singhi S, Saier MH | title = The ion transporter superfamily | journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta | volume = 1618 | issue = 1 | pages = 79–92 | date = December 2003 | pmid = 14643936 | doi = 10.1016/j.bbamem.2003.10.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rabus R, Jack DL, Kelly DJ, Saier MH | title = TRAP transporters: an ancient family of extracytoplasmic solute-receptor-dependent secondary active transporters | journal = Microbiology | volume = 145 ( Pt 12) | pages = 3431–45 | date = December 1999 | pmid = 10627041 | doi = 10.1099/00221287-145-12-3431 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The AbgT family consists of the AbgT (YdaH; [http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.68.1.1 TC# 2.A.68.1.1]) protein of ''E. coli'' and the MtrF drug exporter ([http://www.tcdb.org/search/result.php?tc=2.A.68.1.2 TC# 2.A.68.1.2]) of ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hussein MJ, Green JM, Nichols BP | title = Characterization of mutations that allow p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate utilization by Escherichia coli | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 180 | issue = 23 | pages = 6260–8 | date = December 1998 | pmid = 9829935 | pmc = 107711 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Folster JP, Shafer WM | title = Regulation of mtrF expression in Neisseria gonorrhoeae and its role in high-level antimicrobial resistance | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 187 | issue = 11 | pages = 3713–20 | date = June 2005 | pmid = 15901695 | pmc = 1112036 | doi = 10.1128/JB.187.11.3713-3720.2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former protein is apparently cryptic in wild-type cells, but when expressed on a high copy number plasmid, or when expressed at higher levels due to mutation, it appeared to allow uptake (''K''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;123&amp;nbsp;nM; see [[Michaelis–Menten kinetics]]) and subsequent utilization of ''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate as a source of [[P aminobenzoate|''p''-aminobenzoate]] for ''p''-aminobenzoate [[Auxotrophy|auxotrophs]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Carter EL, Jager L, Gardner L, Hall CC, Willis S, Green JM | title = Escherichia coli abg genes enable uptake and cleavage of the folate catabolite p-aminobenzoyl-glutamate | journal = Journal of Bacteriology | volume = 189 | issue = 9 | pages = 3329–34 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17307853 | pmc = 1855889 | doi = 10.1128/JB.01940-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''p''-Aminobenzoate is a constituent of and a precursor for the biosynthesis of [[folic acid]].

== Structure ==
AbgT is 510 amino acyl residues long and has 12-13 putative transmembrane α-helical spanners (TMSs). MtrF is 522 aas long and has 11 or 12 putative TMSs. The 3-d structures of MtrF and a YdaH homologue have been solved, and functional studies show that it is a drug exporter.  The 3-d structure shows that it has 9 TMSs with hairpin entry loops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Su CC, Bolla JR, Kumar N, Radhakrishnan A, Long F, Delmar JA, Chou TH, Rajashankar KR, Shafer WM, Yu EW | title = Structure and function of Neisseria gonorrhoeae MtrF illuminates a class of antimetabolite efflux pumps | journal = Cell Reports | volume = 11 | issue = 1 | pages = 61–70 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25818299 | pmc = 4410016 | doi = 10.1016/j.celrep.2015.03.003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Crystal Structures:

== Genetics ==
The ''abgT'' gene is preceded by two genes, ''abgA'' and ''abgB,'' which code for homologous amino acyl amino hydrolases and hydrolyze ''p''-aminobenzoyl glutamate to ''p''-aminobenzoate and glutamate.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Because of the structural similarity of ''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutatmate to peptides, and the enzymatic activities of the ''abgA'' and ''abgB'' gene products, it has been suggested that AbgT is also a peptide transporter.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Demonstration of an energy requirement suggested an H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;-dependent mechanism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Expression of these genes is regulated by AbgR and an unknown effector.

== Function ==
As noted above, the AbgT family of transporters has been thought to contribute to bacterial [[Folic acid|folate biosynthesis]] by importing the catabolite ''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate for producing folate. Approximately 13,000 putative family members were identified in 2015.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Delmar JA, Yu EW | title = The AbgT family: A novel class of antimetabolite transporters | journal = Protein Science | volume = 25 | issue = 2 | pages = 322–37 | date = February 2016 | pmid = 26443496 | pmc = 4815354 | doi = 10.1002/pro.2820 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The X-ray structures of the full-length ''[[Alcanivorax borkumensis]]'' YdaH (AbgT) and ''[[Neisseria gonorrhoeae]]'' MtrF proteins. The structures revealed that these two transporters assemble as dimers with architectures distinct from all other families of transporters for which 3-d structures were available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bolla JR, Su CC, Delmar JA, Radhakrishnan A, Kumar N, Chou TH, Long F, Rajashankar KR, Yu EW | title = Crystal structure of the Alcanivorax borkumensis YdaH transporter reveals an unusual topology | journal = Nature Communications | volume = 6 | pages = 6874 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25892120 | doi = 10.1038/ncomms7874 | url = https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms7874 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Both YdaH and MtrF are bowl-shaped dimers with a solvent-filled basin extending from the cytoplasm halfway across the [[Lipid bilayer|membrane bilayer]]. The protomers of YdaH and MtrF contain nine transmembrane helices and two hairpins which suggested a plausible pathway for substrate transport.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A combination of the crystal structure, genetic analyses and substrate accumulation assays indicated that both YdaH and MtrF behave as exporters, capable of removing the folate metabolite ''p''-aminobenzoic acid from bacterial cells. In fact, it was shown that both YdaH and MtrF participate as [[Antibiotics|antibiotic]] efflux pumps, mediating bacterial resistance to [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamide antimetabolite drugs]]. Possibly, many AbgT-family transporters act as exporters, conferring resistance to [[Sulfadiazine|sulfonamides]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Transport reaction ===
The generalized transport reaction initially proposed for AbgT is:&lt;blockquote&gt;''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate (out) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → ''p''-aminobenzoyl-glutamate (in) + nH&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)&lt;/blockquote&gt;but the more recently proposed transport reaction is:&lt;blockquote&gt;Sulfonamide drugs (in) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (out) → Sulfonamide drugs (out) + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (in)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Paul Knapman''' [[Deputy Lieutenant|DL]]  was Her Majesty’s [[Coroner]] for Westminster (and Inner West London), from 1980 to 2011 (and Deputy Coroner from 1975-1980).  His responsibility for investigating sudden deaths as an independent judicial officer saw him preside over numerous notable cases.

He was made a Deputy Lieutenant of Greater London in 2008 and advanced to the representative Deputy Lieutenant for Westminster in 2013.

As coroner he dealt with approximately 85,000 deaths and 12,500 inquests (including about  500 murder/mansalughter cases). One of his last major cases (October 2010) was presiding over the inquest of the barrister Mark Saunders, controversially shot to death by Metropolitan Police on 6 May 2008. After the ruling of ‘lawful killing’  Knapman revealed that he would use his powers as coroner to highlight lessons that should be learned by the police for the future&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mpa.gov.uk/committees/sop/2011/0317/08/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-03-17 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927172531/http://www.mpa.gov.uk/committees/sop/2011/0317/08/ |archivedate=27 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and would make copies of his recommendation available to [[Secretary of State for Justice]], [[Kenneth Clarke]].

He has an entry in  Who's Who and [[Debrett's]],&lt;ref name=debretts&gt;http://www.debretts.com/people/biographies/browse/k/990/Paul+Anthony.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; the two-century-old guide to people of distinction and etiquette.

== Sandra Rivett, Nanny to Lord Lucan in 1975==
As the Deputy Coroner he was much involved with the preparation of the inquest into the death of Sandra Rivett, nanny to the children of Lord Lucan. He sat with the coroner during the inquest (16–19 November June 1975), when the jury returned the verdict that Lord Lucan should stand trial at The Old Bailey charged with the murder of Sandra Rivett. Lord Lucan had disappeared and has never been found.

==Georgi Markov, in 1978==
As Deputy Coroner he was consulted and involved in all stages following the death of Georgi Markov, who died on 11 November 1978. Markov was a Bulgarian working for the BBC World Service and considered a thorn in the side of the Communist authorities. His cause of death was by a pellet  probably containing ricin (which was never actually analysed). Although the press and others showed diagrams of the poison's administration by an umbrella, no umbrella was ever found.

==Iranian Embassy Siege, in 1980==
At that time the US Embassy in Tehran was besieged by the Iranian Authorities with the American citizens working in the Embassy having been taken hostage. President Carter sanctioned a rescue by US forces, but the US helicopters unfortunately came down in the desert and the hostage rescue had to be abandoned. Subsequently, the Iranian Embassy in London was seized by six terrorists on 30 April, and they  shot one hostage. The Home Secretary, William Whitelaw, handed control of the situation from the Metropolitan Police to the British Army.

Then, it being a Bank holiday weekend, in the full blaze of publicity and live television, soldiers of the Special Air Service (SAS) successfully rescued the hostages on 5 May. At the subsequent inquest the jury learnt that during the rescue another hostage was killed by a terrorist and five terrorists were shot and killed by the SAS. One terrorist survived. At the inquest the jury unanimously returned a verdict of justifiable homicide concerning the death of the terrorists.

==Libyan Embassy Siege in 1984==
On 17 April in 1984 there was a protest demonstration outside the Libyan Embassy in St.James' Square, London. Shots were fired from the Embassy injuring demonstrators and killing WPC Yvonne Fletcher. At the inquest it was shown that the shots came from the first floor of the Embassy and the pathologist Dr. West opined that her fatal injury was consistent with this. The inquest jury concluded she was unlawfully killed.

==Clapham Junction Rail Disaster in 1988==
On Monday 12 December 1988, just outside Clapham Junction railway station a crowded train from Basingstoke was shunted at speed from behind by a following train from Bournemouth, a third train from London on the adjacent line collided with the wreckage, a fourth train stopped in time. thirty-five people were killed.

The site of the crash and the dead were within the jurisdiction of the Coroner for Inner West London and the bodies were taken to an expanded mortuary at Westminster. All the inquests were opened and adjourned at Westminster Coroner's Court.

The inquests into all 35 people were subsequently held at a special court at Westminster Council House. It started with a very brief outline of the timings and mechanisms of the accident. Then subsequently the Coroner and jury heard the following evidence  regarding each of the deceased: an outline of personal details, including character of each person provided by a relative; evidence of how precisely they were identified; an indication of where precisely they were at the time of the collision, assisted by visual aids; and a brief summary of injuries and the cause of death provided by the pathologist.

Then, having heard the evidence on each of the 35 people, the Coroner announced he was adjourning the inquest for a Public Enquiry to be held by Anthony Hidden QC who had been appointed for that purpose by The Secretary of State for Transport under regulations of The Railways Act 1871.

The cause of the crash was found to be that a wiring fault in signalling mean that the signal would not show red even though the track circuit ahead was occupied by a train. Re-wiring had recently been performed on Clapham Junction A box, and redundant wires had not been cut back and insulated sufficiently causing a false feed. A number of recommendations were made. (Ref: Hidden 1989) Following a prosecution, British Rail were fined £250,000 for a breach of the Health &amp; Safety at Work etc. Act. Knapman concluded it was not necessary to resume the inquests.

==Marchioness Boat Disaster in 1989==

On 20 August 1989 the Marchioness Boat was struck by the Bowbelle on the River Thames in London. This fatal collision resulted in the drowning of 51 people.

Dr Paul Knapman was the coroner, Dr Dolman was deputising as Dr. Knapman was out of London at that time.

Having returned to London,  although not specifically recalling it, Dr. Knapman said that had he been asked by the Metropolitan Police he would certainly have given consent for hands to be removed from the decomposed bodies. This was standard practice for all London coroners at the time for any bodies that were badly decomposed (especially by water).  During an inquiry into Dr Knapman’s actions he stated the hands had been removed for identification purposes in an attempt to get identification of the victims to their families as soon as practically possible.  However, subsequently it was determined that at least 12 of the victims who had their hands removed were simultaneously in the process of potential dental identification that might have resulted in identification sooner. Visual identification is not considered reliable in such circumstances and many errors have occurred in the past leading to greater distress.

In 1992 Dr Knapman refused to resume the inquest into the victims deaths adding that there had been four inquiries/court proceedings already.  In January 1993, mothers of two of the victims, began legal action for judicial review of his decision.

In June 1994, after a judicial review, the Court of Appeal heard the appeal. Lord Justice Brown said... "no-one should interpret this judgement as a condemnation of Dr. Knapman, almost without exception he handled the many difficulties he faced not merely with sensitivity but with an evident sympathy for the bereaved families. Understandably, and indeed justifiably riled by an unfair article in The Mail on Sunday he was guilty of but a single intemperate comment" (See Reference 1) Lord Justice Farquharson said "the various affidavits and other documents in these proceedings clearly demonstrate that the Coroner was most concerned about the welfare of the bereaved families and he repeatedly consulted them, indeed the lengths he went to showed that his actions went far beyond those normally expected of a Coroner." Sir Thomas Bingham, The Master of the Rolls said, "I reach this decision with regret, the Coroner reacted to this horrific tragedy with energy and public spirit. He went to great lengths to treat the bereaved with sympathy and understanding.....the issue for this court is however, the single limited question. Conscious though I am of the great difficulty in which the Coroner was placed, I never the less feel bound to reach the conclusion I have expressed." Dr Knapman and Dr Dolman were stood down and a new coroner was appointed by the High Court and Home Office, Dr John Burton. Burton then held an Inquest into all the Marchioness deaths.

In February 2000 Deputy Prime Minister John Prescott announced that he had ordered a Public Enquiry into the circumstances surrounding Marchioness disaster. During a Non-Statutory Inquiry into the Identification of the 51 Victims, overseen by Lord Justice Clarke. Lord Justice Clarke also expressed his concerns over the removal of the hands of the victims. (See Reference 2)
Some of the family members of the victims urged Dr Knapman to resign and stated they would call on the Home Secretary if action was not taken against him. However, Dr Knapman continued to act as Her Majesty’s Coroner for London and Westminster for another 11 years and went on to have assigned to him many high-profile cases including the tragic death of Diana, Princess of Wales in 2007.

==The Ladbroke Grove Rail Disaster in 1999==
The Ladbroke Grove Rail crash (also known as The Paddington Rail crash) occurred on 5 October 1999. On that day in the morning, a Thames train to Bedwyn in Wiltshire left Paddington Station and collided head on with a First Great Western train travelling into Paddington from Cheltenham. The combined speed was 130&amp;nbsp;mph and ignited fuel, caused a fireball and the first carriage of the Cheltenham train was totally burnt out. Both drivers and 29 passengers, a total of 31 people were killed. The site of the crash and the dead came within the jurisdiction of the Coroner for Inner West London and the bodies were taken to an expanded mortuary at Westminster. All the inquests were opened and adjourned at Westminster Coroner's Court.

The inquests into all 31 dead was subsequently held at a special court at Westminster Council House. Each started with a very brief outline of the timings and mechanism of the accident. The Coroner heard the following evidence regarding each of the deceased: an outline of personal details, including character of each person provided by a relative; an indication of where it was estimated  they were at the time of the collision assisted by visual aids; and a brief summary of the injuries and the cause of death (mostly severe burns) was provided by a pathologist.

Then, having heard all the evidence a contrivance was shared and announced, that a letter from The Lord Chancellor had just been delivered. The letter requested the Coroner to adjourn the inquest pending the result of a public enquiry conducted by Lord Cullen. This contrivance was as a consequence of legislation passed only a month earlier, whereby the Lord Chancellor could require an inquest to be adjourned and only resumed if the Coroner "believes there is exceptional reason for doing so".

The cause of the crash was found to be the driver of the Thames train from Paddington passing signal SN109 at red, probably due to bad sighting of SN109 and bright sunlight at a low angle, and other factors outlined. There had been previous difficulty with this signal and eight events of "signal passed at danger - SPAD" in the proceeding six years. Significant other problems surfaced, resulting in the creation of the Rail Safety Standards Board in 2003.

In 2004 Thames Trains was fined a record £2,000,000 and were ordered to pay £75,000 in costs. The inquest was not resumed.

==7/7 London Bombings in 2005==
On 7 July 2005 in the morning four separate suicide bombs exploded at approximately the same time in London. The first suicide bomb exploded on a London Underground train close to Aldgate Station, the second suicide bomb exploded on a London Underground train close to Edgware Road Station, a third suicide bomb exploded on a London Underground Train close to King's Cross/Russell Square Stations. A fourth suicide bomb exploded almost one hour later on a double decker bus at Tavistock Square. It was originally thought there had been six rather than three explosions on the Underground Network as smoke billowed out of both ends of the tunnels. The bus brought the number to seven but this was clarified to four sites later in the day.

The number of fatalities were seven at Aldgate, six at Edgware Road, twenty-six at Kings Cross/Russell Square and thirteen at Tavistock Square plus the four suicide bombers themselves making a total number of 56 fatalities.

As there were four sites of the bombings it happened that there were two other coroners involved apart from Knapman. He was the "Incident" or "Lead Coroner" for the first 10 days until all the bodies had been identified. Knapman then handed over to Dr. Andrew Reid, Coroner for Inner North London, as the Incident Coroner. Unusually, quite apart from the anti-terrorist police, there were three police forces involved namely The Metropolitan Police, The British Transport Police and The City of London Police.

A "temporary mortuary" was set up at The Honorary Artillery Company Headquarters at City Road, London EC1. The challenges were: there had been four sites of the bombs;  many thousands of "missing persons" reported initially; a cosmopolitan city; disrupted bodies; and computer hard and software of 2005. For the first time features of Lord Justice Clark's report "identification of victims following Major Transport Accidents" were used. This put the Coroner in overall charge, but with a Senior Identification Manager (and Deputy), together with a Mortuary Documentation Officer, from within the police. There was also an "Identification Commission" chaired by the Coroner to scrutinise all documentation etc. before an identification was absolutely confirmed. Inquests were opened and adjourned by each of the three Coroners.

It was considered prudent that all the inquests be transferred to Dr. Knapman at Westminster under the provisions of The Coroners' Act 1988. Subsequently, Dr. Knapman appointed Lady Justice Hallett to be his Assistant Deputy Coroner, and she eventually held inquests into the deaths.

==Inquest into Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Al-Fayed in 2007==
The death of Diana, Princess of Wales and Mr. Dodi Al-Fayed occurred on 31 August 1997 in Paris. The cause was a collision involving the car in which they were both travelling in the Alma tunnel hitting a pillar at speed inside the tunnel. Both bodies were repatriated to London.

Due to protracted enquiries and legal difficulties, the delayed inquests into both were opened eventually on 6 January 2004 by Michael Burgess, HM Coroner for Surrey and The Royal Household. Subsequently, he announced he would resign from the cases said to be due to "heavy and constant workload" on 24 July 2006, and he appointed Lady Butler-Sloss as his deputy.

Following court proceedings in the High Court on 2 March 2007, Paul Knapman was appointed Coroner. He appointed Lady Butler-Sloss, a retired Court of Appeal Judge to hear the inquests as his Assistant Deputy Coroner. She resigned on 24 April 2007.  On 7 June 2007 Knapman appointed Lord Justice Scott Baker as his Assistant Deputy Coroner to hear the cases. He then held inquests into both Diana, Princess of Wales and Dodi Al-Fayed which began on 2 October 2007.

The jury returned a verdict of "unlawful killing" implicating the driver Henri Paul and the paparazzi.

==Early life==
Paul Knapman went to [[Epsom College]], Surrey, [[King's College London]], and [[St George's Hospital Medical School]], London, where he qualified as a doctor – MB, BS (1968). He then proceeded to read for the Bar at the Council of Legal Education, and was called to the Bar as a barrister by Gray's Inn in 1972.

'''Prehistoric Trackways National Monument''' is a [[national monument]] in the [[Robledo Mountains]] of [[Doña Ana County, New Mexico|Doña Ana County]], [[New Mexico]], [[United States]], near the city of [[Las Cruces, New Mexico|Las Cruces]]. The monument's [[Paleozoic|Paleozoic Era]] [[fossil]]s are on {{convert|5,255|acre|0}}&lt;ref name="blm_details"/&gt; of land administered by the [[Bureau of Land Management]].&lt;ref name="blm.gov"&gt;{{cite web |date=May 31, 2011 |title=Prehistoric Trackways National Monument |publisher=Bureau of Land Management: |url=http://www.blm.gov/nm/st/en/prog/recreation/las_cruces/trackways.html |accessdate=August 4, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It became the 100th active U.S. national monument when it was designated on March 30, 2009.

==Fossils==
The Prehistoric Trackways National Monument site includes a major deposit of Paleozoic Era [[fossil]]ized footprints in [[fossil trackway|fossil mega-trackway]]s of land animals, sea creatures, and insects. These are known as trace fossils or ichnofossils. There are also fossilized plants and [[petrified wood]] present, as well as plenty of marine invertebrate fossils including [[brachiopods]], [[gastropods]], [[cephalopods]], [[bivalves]], and [[echinoderms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kozur |first1=Heinz W. |last2=LeMone |first2=David V. |year=1995 |title=The Shalem colony Section of the Abo and Upper Hueco Members of the Hueco formation of the Robledo Mountains, Dona Ana County, New Mexico: Stratigraphy and New Conodont Based Age Determinations |journal=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin |volume=6 |pages=39–55}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the fossilized material originated during the [[Permian Period]] and is around 280 million years old.&lt;ref name="blm.gov"/&gt;

[[File:Dimetrodon track.jpg|thumb|250px|left|Possible ''[[Dimetrodon]]'' track]]
Some of the animals who may have left tracks in the Robledo Mountains include ''[[Dimetrodon]]'', ''[[Eryops]]'', ''[[Edaphosaurus]]'', and multiple other [[pelycosaurs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lockley |first=M. |year=1995 |title=Dinosaur tracks: and other fossil footprints of the western United States |location=New York |publisher=Columbia University Press |isbn=978-0231079266}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are at least 13 major trace fossils found at the monument, including Selenichnites (sel-EEN-ick-NIGHT eez) or moon-shaped trace, Kouphichnium (koof-ICK-nee-um) or light trace, Palmichnium (pal-ICK-nee-um) or palm [frond] trace, Octopodichnus (oct-toe-pod-ICK-nuss) or eight-footed trace, Lithographus (lith-oh-GRAFF-us) or rock writing, Tonanoxichnus (tong-a-nox-ICK-nuss) or Tonganoxie [Kansas] trace, Augerinoichnus (aw-gurr-EE-no-ICK-nuss) or [[Augerino]] trace, Undichna (und-ICK-nuh) or wave-shaped trace, Serpentichnus (serpent-ICK-nuss) or snake-like trace, Batrachichnus (baa-track ICK-nuss) or frog trace, Dromopus (dro-MOE-puss) or running foot, and Dimetropus (die-MEET-row-puss) or Dimetrodon foot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Lucas |first=S. |year=2011 |title=Traces of a Permian Seacoast |location=Albuquerque |publisher=New Mexico Museum of Natural History |isbn=978-0615471709}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trackways can be difficult for the general public to find, as the monument is largely undeveloped with few facilities yet existing to aid fossil hunters. Many of the slabs pulled out by Jerry MacDonald are housed at the [[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]], although they are not on display at this time. Guided hikes are periodically offered by BLM interpretive staff.&lt;ref name="blm.gov"/&gt;

==Geology==
The monument lies along the western portion of the [[Rio Grande rift]] and is within part of the [[Robledo Mountains]]. It is made up of [[Cenozoic]] and [[Paleozoic]] (Hueco Group) sediments. The Hueco Group is early [[Permian]] strata. Most of the monument is [[Permian]] and would have been underwater or along the coast of what was once the Hueco Seaway. The tracks can be found in the red rock which is called the abo red beds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lucas |first=S. G. |title=Geology of Early Permian tracksites, Robledo Mountains, south-central New Mexico |journal=New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science Bulletin |volume=6 |pages=13–32|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Flora and fauna==
The monument is situated at the northern tip of the [[Chihuahuan Desert]]. Some examples of plants within the monument are [[ocotillo]], [[mesquite]], [[creosote bush]], [[Opuntia|prickly-pear cactus]], [[Yucca faxoniana|Torrey yucca]], [[barrel cactus]], [[sotol]], [[agave]] and [[snakeweed]]. A few of the animals that you may see are [[mule deer]], [[rattlesnakes]], [[desert cottontail]], many species of lizards, and several species of birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chihuahuandesert.org/fieldguide2.htm |title=Chihuahuan Desert Field Guide - Plants |publisher=Chihuahuan Desert Education Coalition |accessdate=2012-12-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130221044445/http://www.chihuahuandesert.org/fieldguide2.htm |archivedate=2013-02-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
On average the coolest month in the monument is January with an average high of {{convert|57|F|C}}, the hottest month is June with an average high temperature of {{convert|94|F|C}}, and the wettest month is August with about {{convert|2.52|in}} of precipitation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/overview/US0875 |title=Overview for Robledo Mountains |publisher=The Weather Channel |accessdate=2011-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121024195518/http://www.weather.com/outlook/recreation/outdoors/overview/US0875 |archivedate=2012-10-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery==
In situ Paleozoic Era tracks were discovered on June 6, 1987 by Jerry Paul MacDonald. Scattered footprints had been found in the Robledos for almost fifty years prior to MacDonald starting his search. He used the recollections of local hikers, quarrymen, and fossil hunters to concentrate his search. This initial site was named the "Discovery Site". It is one of the best places in the monument for visitors to see fossilized tracks. Jerry MacDonald excavated three long trackways, carrying over 2500 slabs out from the site on his back. The majority of the slabs are housed in the [[New Mexico Museum of Natural History and Science]] in the Jerry MacDonald Paleozoic Trackways Collection. Two other continuous trackways are held in the [[Carnegie Museum of Natural History]] and [[Smithsonian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacDonald |first=J. |year=1994 |title=Earths First Steps |location=Boulder Co. |publisher=Johnson Printing |isbn=978-0585036632}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monument designation==
Prehistoric Trackways National Monument was sponsored by Senators [[Jeff Bingaman]] (D-NM) and [[Pete Domenici]] (R-NM) and was part of the [[National Landscape Conservation System]] of the [[United States of America]] under the [[Omnibus Public Land Management Act]], signed into law on March 30, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=United States Congress |title=Omnibus Public Land Management Act of 2009, Title II |date=October 3, 2009 |url=http://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Omnibus_Public_Land_Management_Act_of_2009/Title_II |accessdate=2012-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first [[National Monument (United States)|national monument]] established under the [[Barack Obama]] administration, and the fourth established in 2009. At the time of its establishment, it was the 100th active national monument in the United States (not the 100th national monument ever designated, since some monuments were previously designated and later dissolved, but the 100th national monument still in operation).

==Recreation==
The Bureau of Land Management is in the process of writing a resource management plan for the monument to be completed in 2012. In the meantime, there are no developed hiking or equestrian trails, and only one interpretive sign. Roads are not maintained and there are no facilities. There are OHV and mountain bike trails, which are rugged and require appropriate skills and equipment.&lt;ref name="blm.gov"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6982">A '''probabilistic neural network (PNN)''' is a [[feedforward neural network]], which is widely used in classification and pattern recognition problems. In the PNN algorithm, the parent probability distribution function (PDF) of each class is approximated by a [[Kernel density estimation|Parzen window]] and a  non-parametric function. Then, using PDF of each class, the class probability of a new input data is estimated and Bayes’ rule is then employed to allocate the class with highest posterior probability to new input data. By this method, the probability of mis-classification is minimized.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/312519997_Competitive_probabilistic_neural_network|title=Competitive probabilistic neural network (PDF Download Available)|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This type of ANN was derived from the [[Bayesian network]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://herselfsai.com/2007/03/probabilistic-neural-networks.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218121158/http://herselfsai.com/2007/03/probabilistic-neural-networks.html |archivedate=2010-12-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a statistical algorithm called [[Kernel Fisher discriminant analysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psi.toronto.edu/~vincent/research/presentations/PNN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120131053940/http://www.psi.toronto.edu/~vincent/research/presentations/PNN.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was introduced by D.F.

* Input layer
* Pattern layer
* Summation layer
* Output layer

==Layers ==

PNN is often used in classification problems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mathworks.in/help/toolbox/nnet/ug/bss38ji-1.html{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; When an input is present, the first layer computes the distance from the input vector to the training input vectors. This produces a vector where its elements indicate how close the input is to the training input. The second layer sums the contribution for each class of inputs and produces its net output as a vector of probabilities. Finally, a compete transfer function on the output of the second layer picks the maximum of these probabilities, and produces a 1 (positive identification) for that class and a 0 (negative identification) for non-targeted classes.

=== Input layer ===
Each neuron in the input layer represents a predictor variable. In categorical variables, ''N-1'' neurons are used when there are ''N'' number of categories. It standardizes the range of the values by subtracting the median and dividing by the [[interquartile range]]. Then the input neurons feed the values to each of the neurons in the hidden layer.

===Pattern layer===
This layer contains one neuron for each case in the training data set. It stores the values of the predictor variables for the case along with the target value. A hidden neuron computes the Euclidean distance of the test case from the neuron’s center point and then applies the [[radial basis function]] kernel function using the sigma values.

===Summation layer===
For PNN networks there is one pattern neuron for each category of the target variable. The actual target category of each training case is stored with each hidden neuron; the weighted value coming out of a hidden neuron is fed only to the pattern neuron that corresponds to the hidden neuron’s category. The pattern neurons add the values for the class they represent.

===Output layer===
The output layer compares the weighted votes for each target category accumulated in the pattern layer and uses the largest vote to predict the target category.

== Advantages==
There are several advantages and disadvantages using PNN instead of [[multilayer perceptron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtreg.com/pnn.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302075157/http://www.dtreg.com/pnn.htm |archivedate=2012-03-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* PNNs are much faster than multilayer perceptron networks.
* PNNs can be more accurate than multilayer perceptron networks.
* PNN networks are relatively insensitive to outliers.
* PNN networks generate accurate predicted target probability scores.
* PNNs approach Bayes optimal classification.

==Disadvantages ==
* PNN are slower than multilayer perceptron networks at classifying new cases.
* PNN require more memory space to store the model.

"'''Shooting the messenger'''" is a [[metaphor]]ic phrase used to describe the act of blaming the [[Porter (carrier)|bearer]] of bad news.

Until the advent of modern telecommunication, messages were usually delivered by human envoys. For example, in [[war]], a messenger would be sent from one camp to another. If the message was unfitting, the receiver might blame the messenger for such bad news and take their anger out on them.

==History==
An analogy of the phrase can come from the breaching of an unwritten code of conduct in war, in which a commanding officer was expected to receive and send back emissaries or diplomatic envoys sent by the enemy unharmed. During the early [[Warring States]] period of China, the concept of chivalry and virtue prevented the executions of messengers sent by opposing sides.

An early literary citing of "shooting the messenger" is in [[Plutarch]]'s ''[[Parallel Lives|Lives]] states'': "The first messenger, that gave notice of [[Lucullus]]' coming was so far from pleasing [[Tigranes II|Tigranes]] that, he had his head cut off for his pains; and no man dared to bring further information. Without any intelligence at all, Tigranes sat while war was already blazing around him, giving ear only to those who flattered him".&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch's ''Life of Lucullus'' (Dryden transl.), paragraph 25; a slightly different account (the messenger was hanged) is in Appian's ''Mithradatic Wars'', paragraph 84&lt;/ref&gt;

A related sentiment was expressed in ''[[Antigone (Sophocles)|Antigone]]'' by [[Sophocles]] as "no one loves the messenger who brings bad news" or "no man delights in the bearer of bad news" ({{lang-gr| στέργει γὰρ οὐδεὶς ἄγγελον κακῶν ἐπῶν}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Antigone of Sophocles|others=Edited with introduction and notes by Sir Richard Jebb|chapter=Line 277|year=1891|author=Sophocles|chapterurl=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0186%3Acard%3D237|publisher=Cambridge University Press}} At the [[Perseus Project]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The sentiment that one should not shoot the messenger was expressed by [[Shakespeare]] in ''[[Henry IV, Part 2]]'' (1598)&lt;ref&gt;Act I, scene 1, lines 95-103; "Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin to speak a truth. ... Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news hath but a losing office, and his tongue sounds ever after as a sullen bell, remember'd tolling a departed friend."&lt;/ref&gt; and in ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'': [[Cleopatra]] threatens to treat the messenger's eyes as balls when told [[Mark Antony|Antony]] has married another, eliciting the response "Gracious madam, I that do bring the news made not the match."&lt;ref&gt;II, 5; cf. I, 2 : "The nature of bad news infects the teller."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also applied to a [[town crier]], an officer of the court who made public pronouncements in the name of the ruling monarch, and often including bad news. Harming a town crier was considered treason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/local/bradford/hi/people_and_places/arts_and_culture/newsid_8931000/8931369.stm|title=Top town crier to be crowned as Hebden Bridge hits 500|publisher=BBC|date=2010-08-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Freud and defense ==
[[Sigmund Freud]] considered shooting the messenger a "marginal case of this kind of [[Defence mechanism|defense]]...of fending off what is distressing or unbearable", citing the example of "the famous lament of the Spanish Moors ''[[Alhama de Granada|Ay de mi Alhama]]'', which tells how King [[Boabdil]] received the news of the fall of his city of [[Alhama de Granada|Alhama]]. He feels that this loss means the end of his rule. But he will not 'let it be true....He threw the letters in the fire and killed the messenger'".&lt;ref&gt;Sigmund Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' (PFL 11) p. 454-5&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud added that "a further determinant of this behaviour of the king was his need to combat a feeling of powerlessness. By burning the letters and having the messenger killed he was still trying to show his absolute power."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, ''On Metapsychology'' p. 455&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Carl G. Jung]], a peer of Freud’s, describes the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] in the individual as part of the unconscious mind, which is largely negative. “Everyone carries a shadow", Jung wrote, "and the less it is embodied in the individual’s conscious life, the blacker and denser it is". It may be in part one’s links to more primitive animal instincts, which are superseded in early childhood by the conscious mind. V.G. Hufnagel, a bioethics expert wrote, “the shadow of the institution protects its own fraternity".&lt;ref&gt;Hufnagel,V.G. (2014) “The Truth Hurts”, Introduction :Kill the Messinger, Kill the Message.&lt;/ref&gt; The fraternity members form a collective and share a collective consciousness with a predatory instinctive animal in nature and hold the fears of childhood. These fears stimulate actions to destroy any message that may harm them. There is no cognitive process in these actions. These are forced on death of an individual and of an idea through human sacrifice. There are religious aspects to these actions. The fraternity of authority believes it holds a right to exterminate those who could harm them.&lt;ref name="Jung, C.G. 1938 P.131"&gt;Jung, C.G. (1938). "Psychology and Religion." In CW 11: Psychology and Religion: West and East. P.131&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jung, C.G. 1938 P.131"/&gt; The shadow is a part of the "psychology of institutions". Institutions have enormous funds to use unlike an individual whistleblower. Institutions also have massive communication systems and a loyal population that supports the institution.

==Current application==
A modern version of "shooting the messenger" can be perceived when someone [[blame]]s the [[Mass media|media]] for presenting bad news about a favored cause, person, organization, etc. "Shooting the messenger" may be a time-honored emotional response to unwanted news, but it is not a very effective method of remaining well-informed."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce W. Sanford, ''Don't Shoot the Messenger'' (2001) p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

Getting rid of the messenger may be a tactical move, but danger found in nondisclosure may result in either hostile responses or negative feedback from others. "People learn very quickly where this is the case, and will studiously avoid giving any negative feedback; thus the 'Emperor' continues with the self-delusion....Obviously this is not a recipe for success".&lt;ref&gt;Mike Robson/Ciaran Beary, ''Facilitating'' (1995) p. 135&lt;/ref&gt; [[Barbara Ehrenreich]] in ''Bright-sided/Smile or Die'' argued that a culture of "thinking positive" so as to "purge 'negative people' from the ranks...[fed into] the ''[[Financial crisis of 2007-2010|bubble-itis]]''"&lt;ref&gt;Barbar Ehrenreich, ''Smile or Die'' (London 2009) p. 188-9&lt;/ref&gt; of the 2000s.

Reactions to the [[whistleblowing]] organization [[WikiLeaks]] led to calls not to shoot the messenger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/julian-assange-dont-shoot-the-messenger-2153616.html |title=Julian Assange: 'Don't Shoot the Messenger' |publisher=''[[The Independent]]'' |accessdate=7 January 2011 |location=London |date=7 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar phrases==
A syntactically similar expression "Please do not shoot the pianist. He is doing his best". It originated around 1860 in the [[Wild West]] of the United States when [[Oscar Wilde]], during his 1883 tour of the United States, saw this saying on a notice in a [[Leadville, Colorado]], saloon.&lt;ref name="Wilde's visit to Leadville documented at:"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oscarwildeinamerica.org/lectures-1882/april/0413-leadville.html | title=Oscar Wilde in Leadville | accessdate=23 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This phrase is sometimes attributed to [[Mark Twain]], but neither Wilde nor Twain ever claimed authorship.

'''Simplified Aid For EVA Rescue''' ('''SAFER''') is a small, self-contained, propulsive backpack system ([[jet pack]]) worn during [[spacewalk]]s, to be used in case of emergency only. If an untethered astronaut were to lose physical contact with the vessel, it would provide free-flying mobility to return to it. It is worn on spacewalks outside the [[International Space Station]] (ISS), and was worn on spacewalks outside the [[Space Shuttle]]. So far, there has not been an emergency in which it was needed.&lt;ref name="day8-92"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-92/sts-92-day-08-highlights.html|title=STS-92 Day 8 Highlights|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2000|author=NASA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Flying Astronaut Over Earth"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.sai.msu.su/apod/ap011002.html|title=Astronomy Picture of the Day A Flying Astronaut Over Earth  |accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=2001|author=APOD}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFER is a small, simplified version of the [[Manned Maneuvering Unit]] (MMU), which was used for regular maneuvering.&lt;ref name="assembly"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption.jsp?searchpage=true&amp;keywords=SAFER&amp;textsearch=Go&amp;hitsperpage=5&amp;pageno=3&amp;photoId=S93-50137|title=SAFER Assembly|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=NASA|year=1993|author=NASA|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110613224209/http://images.jsc.nasa.gov/luceneweb/caption.jsp?searchpage=true&amp;keywords=SAFER&amp;textsearch=Go&amp;hitsperpage=5&amp;pageno=3&amp;photoId=S93-50137|archivedate=June 13, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application==
SAFER is designed to be used as a self-rescue device if in spite of precautions such as tethers, safety grips, and the robot arm an EVA crewmember gets separated and no vehicles can provide rescue capability.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A05E5D61F38F933A2575AC0A962958260|title=Shuttle Soars Into Orbit to Test Device for Space Rescues |accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|author=Broad, William J. | date=September 10, 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; SAFER is worn by every ISS crewmember using an [[Extravehicular Mobility Unit]]. SAFER was co-invented by former astronaut [[Joseph Kerwin]], [[Paul Cottingham]] and [[Ted Christian]] under a Lockheed contract to NASA for [[Space Station Freedom]]. It was later sponsored by the Space Shuttle Program and developed by [[Lockheed Corporation|Lockheed]] and NASA personnel. [[Ralph Anderson (NASA)|Ralph Anderson]] was the Shuttle Program Office's Project Manager for the SAFER Development Test Objective (DTO).  [[Cliff Hess]] was the NASA Project Engineer. The device was developed by the Robotics Division (with its Lockheed staff) of [[NASA]] at the [[Johnson Space Center]].  The SAFER was the design solution to the Shuttle Program's requirement to provide a means of self rescue should an EVA crewmember become untethered during an EVA.

SAFER was first flown on [[STS-64]] September 9, 1994, where an untethered flight test was performed first by astronaut [[Mark C. Lee|Mark Lee]] and then [[Carl Meade]]. Both astronauts flew the SAFER up and around the Shuttle's [[Canadarm|Robotic Arm]] along with a demonstration test of the SAFER's automatic attitude hold feature.  This feature arrests uncontrolled rotation of a detached crewmember expected in an accidental separation.  SAFER has a mass of approximately 83&amp;nbsp;lb (38&amp;nbsp;kg) and can provide a total change in velocity ([[delta-v]]) of at least 10&amp;nbsp;ft/s (3&amp;nbsp;m/s).&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; It was also tested during flight [[STS-92]] when astronauts [[Peter Wisoff]] and [[Michael López-Alegría]] performed test maneuvers, flying up to 50 feet (15&amp;nbsp;m) while remaining tethered to the spacecraft.&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/missions/sts-92/news/sts-92-mcc-15.txt STS-92 NASA Mission Report #15] NASA, 2008-10-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Complications==

The left side latch on the SAFER unit became unlatched during an EVA by astronaut [[Piers Sellers]] on [[STS-121]] while testing shuttle repair techniques.&lt;ref name="msnbc"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/13815044/|title=Duct tape suggested for spacewalk repair|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|year=2006|author=Mike Schneider for the Associated Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="drama"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn9524-high-drama-spacewalk-ends-in-success.html|title=High drama spacewalk ends in success|accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=New Scientist|year=2006|author=Kelly Young}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latch had been inadvertently bumped and moved to the unlatch position.  As a precaution, [[Mike Fossum]] tethered it to him and the spacewalk continued.&lt;ref name="spacecom"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.space.com/missionlaunches/060712_sts121_eva3.html|title=Spacewalkers Test Shuttle Heat Shield Repair Technique |accessdate=October 6, 2008|publisher=Space.com|year=2006|author=Tariq Malik}}&lt;/ref&gt; In subsequent spacewalks, the latches were secured with [[Kapton]] tape, a space-rated form of [[adhesive tape]], to prevent the latches from inadvertently opening. A hard cover is being designed for future missions.{{Citation needed|reason=No proof|date=August 2017}}

'''The Ghost Club''' is a [[paranormal investigation]] and research organization, founded in London in 1862.&lt;ref name=Underwood&gt;Peter Underwood (1978) "Dictionary of the Supernatural", Harrap Ltd., London, {{ISBN|0-245-52784-2}}, Page 144&lt;/ref&gt; It is widely believed to be the oldest such organization in the world.&lt;ref name=Underwood/&gt; Since 1862 it has primarily investigated [[ghost|ghosts and hauntings]].

==History==

The club has its roots in [[Cambridge]] in 1855, where [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellows]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] began to discuss [[ghost]]s and [[Parapsychology|psychic phenomena]]. Launched officially in London in 1862, it counted [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] among its members.&lt;ref name=brock440&gt;{{cite book | title=William Crookes (1832-1919) and the commercialization of science | series=Science, technology, and culture, 1700-1945 | author=William Hodson Brock | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | year=2008 | isbn=0-7546-6322-1 | page=440 }}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the club's earliest [[Ghost hunting|investigations]] was of the [[Davenport brothers]] and their "spirit cabinet" [[hoax]], the club challenging the Davenports' claim of contacting the dead.

The group continued to undertake practical investigations of [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] phenomena, a topic then in vogue, meeting to discuss ghostly subjects. The Ghost Club dissolved in the 1870s following the death of Dickens.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===1882 revitalisation===

The club was revived on [[All Saints Day]] 1882 by the medium [[Stainton Moses]] and [[Alaric Alfred Watts]].&lt;ref name=brock440/&gt; initially claiming to be the original founders, without acknowledging its origins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ghostclub.org.uk/history.html|title=The Ghost Club History|publisher="Ghost Club" |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1882, the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR), with whom there was an initial overlap, was founded at a similar time.&lt;ref name=brock440/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Oppenheim|Oppenheim, Janet]]. (1988). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. p. 138. {{ISBN|978-0521347679}} "Moses became one of the first vice-presidents and council members of the SPR"&lt;/ref&gt;

While the SPR was a body devoted to scientific study, the Ghost Club remained a selective and secretive organization of [[Spiritualism|convinced believers]] for whom psychic phenomena were an established fact.&lt;ref name=brock440/&gt; Stainton Moses resigned from the vice presidency of the SPR in 1886 and thereafter devoted himself to the Ghost Club. Membership was small (82 members over 54 years{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}) and women were not allowed but during this period it attracted some of the most original and controversial minds in psychical research. These included Sir [[William Crookes]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The spiritualists: the story of Florence Cook and William Crookes | first=Trevor H. | last=Hall | publisher=Helix Press | year=1963 | page=97n }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sir [[Oliver Lodge]], [[Nandor Fodor]] and Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].

The archives{{Clarify|date=February 2016}} of the Club reveal that the names of members, both living and dead, were solemnly recited each November 2. Each individual, living or dead, was recognized a member of the Club. On more than one occasion deceased members were believed to have made their presence felt.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Also involved were the poet [[W. B. Yeats]] (joined 1911) and [[Frederick Bligh Bond]] (joined 1925), who became infamous with his investigations into spiritualism at [[Glastonbury]]. Bligh Bond later left the country and became active in the [[American Society for Psychical Research]]. He was ordained into the [[Old Catholic Church]] and rejoined the Ghost Club on his return to Britain in 1935.

The Principal of [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], Arthur Grey fictionalized the Ghost Club in 1919 as "The Everlasting Club"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0605771h.html |title=Read "The Everlasting Club" |publisher=Project Gutenberg Australia |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a ghost story that many still believe to be true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ash-tree.bc.ca/atp134tediousbrieftales.htm |title="Tedious Brief Tales of Granta and Gramarye" by Arthur Grey |publisher=Ash-Tree Press |date= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mythosbooks.com/?page=shop/flypage&amp;product_id=54807&amp;CLSN_23=1246353232238b39aa06f9d73fa1f62e |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714145228/http://www.mythosbooks.com/?page=shop%2Fflypage&amp;product_id=54807&amp;CLSN_23=1246353232238b39aa06f9d73fa1f62e |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-07-14 |title="Tedious Brief Tales of Granta and Gramarye" by Arthur Grey |publisher=Mythos Books |date= |accessdate= |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 20th century===

The 20th century's move from [[séance]] room investigation to laboratory-based research meant the Ghost Club fell out of touch with contemporary psychic research. [[Harry Price]], famous for his investigation into [[Borley Rectory]], joined as a member in 1927 as did psychologist [[Nandor Fodor]] who represented the changing approach to psychical research taking place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/the-ghost-club-a-history-by-peter-underwood.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703003858/http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/the-ghost-club-a-history-by-peter-underwood.html |archivedate=2013-07-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With attendance falling, the club closed in 1936 after 485 meetings. The Ghost Club records were deposited in the [[British Museum]] under the proviso that they would remain closed until 1962 out of respect for confidentiality.&lt;ref name=brock440/&gt;

Within 18 months, Price relaunched the Ghost Club as a society dining event where psychic researchers and mediums delivered after-dinner talks. Price decided to admit women to the club, also specifying that it was not a spiritualist church or association but a group of [[Skepticism|skeptics]] that gathered to discuss paranormal topics. Members in this period included {{nowrap|[[C. E. M. Joad]]}}, Sir [[Julian Huxley]], [[Algernon Blackwood]], Sir [[Osbert Sitwell]] and [[Frederick Montague, 1st Baron Amwell|Lord Amwell]].

Following Price's death in 1948, the club was again relaunched by members of the committee, Philip Paul and [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]]. From 1962 Underwood served as President; many accounts of club activities are found in his books.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Tom Perrott]] joined the club in 1967 and served as Chairman from 1971 to 1993.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 1993, the club underwent a period of internal disruption, during which Underwood left to become Life President of another society he had revived called "The Ghost Club Society".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.castleofspirits.com/ghostclub.html The Ghost Club Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216181942/http://www.castleofspirits.com/ghostclub.html |date=2014-12-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ghost Club later expanded its remit to include the study of [[UFO]]s, [[dowsing]], [[cryptozoology]] and similar topics.

===Recent history===

In 1998, Perrott resigned as chairman (although he remained active in club affairs), and [[barrister]] Alan Murdie was elected as his successor. Murdie has written a number of ghost books including ''Haunted [[Brighton]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.britishlocalhistory.co.uk/Default.aspx?tabid=8770&amp;ProductID=1114 |title=Haunted Brighton |publisher=British Local History |date= |ISBN=978-0-7524-3829-0 |accessdate= }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and regularly writes for ''[[Fortean Times]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.forteantimes.com/strangedays/ghostwatch/1035/yorkshire_ghost_busters.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314220116/http://www.forteantimes.com/strangedays/ghostwatch/1035/yorkshire_ghost_busters.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-03-14 |title="Fortean Times" article by Alan Murdie |publisher=Fortean Times |date=March 2008 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005 he was succeeded by Kathy Gearing, the club's first female chairperson. Gearing announced her resignation in the club's Summer 2009 newsletter.&lt;ref&gt;The Ghost Club newsletter, Summer 2009, page 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The club continues to meet monthly at the Victory Services Club near [[Marble Arch]], in London. Several investigations are performed in England every year. In recent times, investigations have been organised in [[Scotland]] by the club's Scottish Area Investigation Coordinator.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

&lt;/ref&gt; Oracle operates a [[interfaith|multi-faith]] spirituality school, an award-winning publishing house, the Peace Pentagon conference center, and programs that support pluralistic and progressive values. Oracle's stated purpose is to serve as "An Advocate for Peace and a Vanguard for Conscious Evolution," and its formal mission statement is an adaptation of [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom|Act for Establishing Religious Freedom]].&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Jefferson, ''Act for Establishing Religious Freedom: ''http://www.virginiamemory.com/online_classroom/shaping_the_constitution/doc/religious_freedom&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle's spirituality school offers courses, conferences, and retreats which focus on the five primary religions ([[Hinduism]], [[Judaism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]), indigenous wisdom traditions, [[New Age]] philosophies, peace-building, [[social justice]], and [[sustainability]]. In 2015, Oracle sponsored the "Building the New World Conference" at Radford University, which featured futurists [[Barbara Marx Hubbard]], [[Jerome C. Glenn]], and [[Charles Eisenstein]].&lt;ref&gt;"Building the New World: An International Networking Event," Fellowship for Intentional Community Website: https://www.ic.org/building-the-new-world-an-international-networking-event/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Building the New World Conference 2015." Kurzweil Network Website: http://www.kurzweilai.net/building-the-new-world-conference-2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Oracle publishes books under its imprint, Oracle Institute Press. Genres include religion and spirituality, personal growth and social evolution, mysticism, the arts, and children's fiction. Oracle Institute Press has won two [[Independent Publisher Book Awards]] in the Religion category,&lt;ref&gt;''Independent Publisher Website: ''http://www.independentpublisher.com/newsdetail.php?page=1049&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Independent Publisher Website:'' http://www.independentpublisher.com/article.php?page=1442&lt;/ref&gt; the Young Voices Seal of Approval for children's fiction, and two Indie Book Awards in the Spirituality and Performing Arts categories.&lt;ref&gt;''Indie Book Awards Website:'' {{cite web |url=http://www.indiebookawards.com/2015_winners_and_finalists.php |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-08-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150817013623/http://www.indiebookawards.com/2015_winners_and_finalists.php |archivedate=2015-08-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''theory of constraints''' ('''TOC''') is a management paradigm  that views any manageable system as being limited in achieving more of its goals by a very small number of [[Theory of constraints#Constraints|constraints]]. There is always at least one constraint, and TOC uses [[#The five focusing steps|a focusing process]] to identify the constraint and restructure the rest of the organization around it. TOC adopts the common idiom "a chain is no stronger than its weakest link". This means that processes, organizations, etc., are vulnerable because the weakest person or part can always damage or break them or at least adversely affect the outcome.

== History ==
The theory of constraints (TOC) is an overall [[management philosophy]] introduced by [[Eliyahu M. Goldratt]] in his 1984 book titled ''[[The Goal (novel)|The Goal]]'', that is geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals.&lt;ref name=goal&gt;{{cite book |author1=Cox, Jeff |author2=Goldratt, Eliyahu M. |title=The goal: a process of ongoing improvement |publisher=North River Press |location=[Croton-on-Hudson, NY] |year=1986 |pages= |isbn=0-88427-061-0 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Goldratt adapted the concept to project management with his book ''Critical Chain'', published in 1997.

An earlier propagator of a similar concept was Wolfgang Mewes&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wolfgangmewes.de/wm.htm|title=Beratergruppe Strategie|author=|date=|website=www.wolfgangmewes.de|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in Germany with publications on ''power-oriented management theory'' (Machtorientierte Führungstheorie, 1963) and following with his ''Energo-Kybernetic System (EKS, 1971)'', later renamed ''[[:de:Engpasskonzentrierte Strategie|Engpasskonzentrierte Strategie]]'' (Bottleneck-focused Strategy) as a more advanced ''theory of bottlenecks''. The publications of Wolfgang Mewes are marketed through the FAZ Verlag, publishing house of the German newspaper ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' (Frankfurt General Newspaper). However, the paradigm ''Theory of constraints'' was first used by Goldratt.

===Key assumption===
The underlying premise of the theory of constraints is that organizations can be measured and controlled by variations on three measures: throughput, operational expense, and inventory. Inventory is all the money that the system has invested in purchasing things which it intends to sell. Operational expense is all the money the system spends in order to turn inventory into throughput. Throughput is the rate at which the system generates money through sales.&lt;ref name=essays&gt;{{cite book |author=Goldratt, Eliyahu M. |title=Essays on the ''Theory of Constraints'' |publisher=North River Press |location=[Great Barrington, MA] |pages= |isbn=0-88427-159-5 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the goal itself can be reached, necessary conditions must first be met. These typically include safety, quality, legal obligations, etc.  For most businesses, the goal itself is to make money.  However, for many organizations and non-profit businesses, making money is a necessary condition for pursuing the goal.  Whether it is the goal or a necessary condition, understanding how to make sound financial decisions based on throughput, inventory, and operating expense is a critical requirement.&lt;ref name=essays /&gt;

===The five focusing steps===
Theory of constraints is based on the premise that the rate of [[goal]] achievement by a goal-oriented [[system]] (i.e., the system's [[Throughput (business)|throughput]]) is limited by at least one [[Theory of constraints#Constraints|constraint]].

The argument by [[reductio ad absurdum]] is as follows: If there was nothing preventing a system from achieving higher throughput (i.e., more goal units in a unit of time), its throughput would be infinite — which is impossible in a real-life system.

Only by increasing flow through the constraint can overall throughput be increased.&lt;ref name=goal/&gt;

Assuming the goal of a system has been articulated and its measurements defined, the steps are:

# Identify the system's constraint(s).
# Decide how to exploit the system's constraint(s).
# Subordinate everything else to the above decision(s).
# Alleviate the system's constraint(s).
# Warning! If in the previous steps a [[Theory of constraints#Breaking a constraint|constraint has been broken]], go back to step 1, but do not allow [[inertia]] to cause a system's constraint.&lt;ref&gt;Eliyahu M. Goldratt. 2004. _The Goal: A Process of Ongoing Improvement, {{ISBN|978-0-88427-178-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The goal of a commercial organization is: "Make more money now and in the future",&lt;ref&gt;Theory of Constraints Handbook, {{ISBN|978-0-07-166554-4}}, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and its measurements are given by [[throughput accounting]] as: throughput, [[inventory]], and [[operating expenses]].

The five focusing steps aim to ensure ongoing improvement efforts are centered on the organization's constraint(s).  In the TOC literature, this is referred to as the ''[[Continual improvement process|process of ongoing improvement]]'' (POOGI).

These focusing steps are the key steps to developing the specific [[#Applications|applications]] mentioned below.

===Constraints===
A constraint is anything that prevents the system from achieving its goal. There are many ways that constraints can show up, but a core principle within TOC is that there are not tens or hundreds of constraints. There is at least one, but at most only a few in any given system. Constraints can be internal or external to the system. An internal constraint is in evidence when the market demands more from the system than it can deliver. If this is the case, then the focus of the organization should be on discovering that constraint and following the five focusing steps to open it up (and potentially remove it). An external constraint exists when the system can produce more than the market will bear. If this is the case, then the organization should focus on mechanisms to create more demand for its products or services.

Types of (internal) constraints
* Equipment: The way equipment is currently used limits the ability of the system to produce more salable goods/services.
* People: Lack of skilled people limits the system. Mental models held by people can cause behaviour that becomes a constraint.
* Policy: A written or unwritten policy prevents the system from making more.

The concept of the constraint in Theory of Constraints is analogous to but differs from the [[Constraint (mathematics)|constraint]] that shows up in mathematical [[optimization (mathematics)|optimization]]. In TOC, the constraint is used as a focusing mechanism for management of the system.  In optimization, the constraint is written into the mathematical expressions to limit the scope of the solution (X can be no greater than 5).

Please note: organizations have many problems with equipment, people, policies, etc. (A breakdown is just that – a breakdown – and is not a constraint in the true sense of the TOC concept). The constraint is the [[limiting factor]] that is preventing the organization from getting more throughput (typically, revenue through sales) even when nothing goes wrong.

===Breaking a constraint===
If a constraint's throughput capacity is elevated to the point where it is no longer the system's limiting factor, this is said to "break" the constraint. The limiting factor is now some other part of the system, or may be external to the system (an external constraint). This is not to be confused with a breakdown.

===Buffers===
Buffers are used throughout the theory of constraints. They often result as part of the exploit and subordinate steps of the five focusing steps. Buffers are placed before the governing constraint, thus ensuring that the constraint is never starved. Buffers are also placed behind the constraint to prevent downstream failure from blocking the constraint's output. Buffers used in this way protect the constraint from variations in the rest of the system and should allow for normal variation of processing time and the occasional upset ([[Murphy's Law|Murphy]]) before and behind the constraint.

Buffers can be a bank of physical objects before a work center, waiting to be processed by that work center. Buffers ultimately buy you time, as in the time before work reaches the constraint and are often verbalized as time buffers. There should always be enough (but not excessive) work in the time queue before the constraint and adequate offloading space behind the constraint.

Buffers are ''not'' the small queue of work that sits before every work center in a [[Kanban]] system although it is similar if you regard the assembly line as the governing constraint. A prerequisite in the theory is that with one constraint in the system, all other parts of the system must have sufficient capacity to keep up with the work at the constraint and to catch up if time was lost. In a balanced line, as espoused by Kanban, when one work center goes down for a period longer than the buffer allows, then the entire system must wait until that work center is restored. In a TOC system, the only situation where work is in danger is if the constraint is unable to process (either due to malfunction, sickness or a "hole" in the buffer – if something goes wrong that the time buffer can not protect).

Buffer management, therefore, represents a crucial attribute of the theory of constraints. There are many ways to apply buffers, but the most often used is a visual system of designating the buffer in three colors: green (okay), yellow (caution) and red (action required). Creating this kind of visibility enables the system as a whole to align and thus subordinate to the need of the constraint in a holistic manner. This can also be done daily in a central operations room that is accessible to everybody.

===Plant types===
There are four primary types of plants in the TOC lexicon. Draw the flow of material from the bottom of a page to the top, and you get the four types. They specify the general flow of materials through a system, and also provide some hints about where to look for typical problems. This type of analysis is known as VATI analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=APICS Dictionary, 13th Edition|last=Blackstone, Jr., editor|first=John H.|publisher=APICS self-published|year=2013|isbn=978-0-9882146-1-3|location=Chicago|pages=186|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as it uses the bottom-up shapes of the letters V, A, T, and I to describe the types of plants. The four types can be combined in many ways in larger facilities, e.g. "an A plant feeding a V plant".
* V-plant: The general flow of material is one-to-many, such as a plant that takes one raw material and can make many final products.  Classic examples are meat rendering plants or a steel manufacturer. The primary problem in V-plants is "robbing," where one operation (A) immediately after a diverging point "steals" materials meant for the other operation (B). Once the material has been processed by A, it cannot come back and be run through B without significant rework.
* A-plant: The general flow of material is many-to-one, such as in a plant where many sub-assemblies converge for a final assembly. The primary problem in A-plants is in synchronizing the converging lines so that each supplies the final assembly point at the right time.
* T-plant: The general flow is that of an I-plant (or has multiple lines), which then splits into many assemblies (many-to-many). Most manufactured parts are used in multiple assemblies and nearly all assemblies use multiple parts. Customized devices, such as computers, are good examples. T-plants suffer from both synchronization problems of A-plants (parts aren't all available for an assembly) and the robbing problems of V-plants (one assembly steals parts that could have been used in another).
* I-plant: Material flows in a sequence, such as in an assembly line. The primary work is done in a straight sequence of events (one-to-one). The constraint is the slowest operation.

From the above list, one can deduce that for non-material systems one could draw the flow of work or the flow of processes, instead of physical flows, and arrive at similar basic V, A, T, or I structures. A project, for example, is an A-shaped sequence of work, culminating in a delivered product (''i.e., the intended outcome of the project'').

==Applications==
The focusing steps, this process of ongoing improvement, have been applied to [[manufacturing]], [[project management]], supply chain/distribution generated specific solutions. Other tools (mainly the "thinking process") also led to TOC applications in the fields of [[marketing]] and [[sales]], and [[finance]].  The solution as applied to each of these areas are listed below.

===Operations===
Within manufacturing operations and [[operations management]], the solution seeks to pull materials through the system, rather than push them into the system. The primary methodology used is drum-buffer-rope (DBR)&lt;ref name=race&gt;{{cite book |author1=Goldratt, Eliyahu |author2=Fox, Robert |title=The Race |publisher=North River Press |location=[Croton-on-Hudson, NY] |year=1986 |pages=179 |isbn=978-0-88427-062-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a variation called simplified drum-buffer-rope (S-DBR).&lt;ref name=sdbr&gt;{{Cite journal |author1=Eli Schragenheim  |author2=H. William Dettmer  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = Simplified Drum-Buffer-Rope: A Whole System Approach to High Velocity Manufacturing | year=  2000 | url = http://www.goalsys.com/books/documents/S-DBRPaper.pdf | format = [[PDF]] | accessdate = 2007-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drum-buffer-rope is a manufacturing execution methodology based on the fact the output of a system can only be the same as the output at the constraint of the system. Any attempt to produce more than what the constraint can process just leads to excess inventory piling up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Race|last=Goldratt|first=Eliyahu M.|publisher=North River Press|year=1986|isbn=9780884270621|location=Croton-on Hudson, New York|pages=77–97|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The method is named for its three components. The ''drum'' is the rate at which the physical constraint of the plant can work: the work center or machine or operation that limits the ability of the entire system to produce more. The rest of the plant follows the beat of the drum. Schedule at the drum decides what the system should produce, in what sequence to produce and how much to produce.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Goldratt|first1=Eliyahu|title=The Haystack Syndrome:: Sifting Information out of the Data Ocean|date=1990|publisher=New York: North River Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; They make sure the drum has work and that anything the drum has processed does not get wasted.

The ''buffer'' protects the drum, so that it always has work flowing to it. Buffers in DBR provide the additional lead time beyond the required set up and process times, for materials in the product flow. Since these buffers have time as their unit of measure, rather than quantity of material, this makes the priority system operate strictly based on the time an order is expected to be at the drum. Each work order will have a remaining buffer status that can be calculated. Based on this buffer status, work orders can be color coded into Red, Yellow and Green. The red orders have the highest priority and must be worked on first, since they have penetrated most into their buffers followed by yellow and green. As time evolves, this buffer status might change and the color assigned to the particular work order change with it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Shri Shrikanth|first1=M|title=DBR, Buffer Management, and VATI flow classification|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=J. F. Cox III &amp; J. J. Schleier|title=Theory of Constraints Handbook|publisher=McGraw Hill|location=New York|pages=175–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional DBR usually calls for buffers at several points in the system: the constraint, synchronization points and at shipping. S-DBR has a buffer at shipping and manages the flow of work across the drum through a load planning mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schragenheim|first1=e|last2=Dettmer|first2=H. W|last3=Patterson|first3=J. W.|title=Supply Chain Management at Warp Speed|date=2009|publisher=Auerbach publications|location=Boca Raton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''rope'' is the work release mechanism for the plant. Orders are released to the shop floor at one "buffer time" before they are due to be processed by the constraint. In other words, if the buffer is 5 days, the order is released 5 days before it is due at the constraint. Putting work into the system earlier than this buffer time is likely to generate too-high work-in-process and slow down the entire system.&lt;ref name="International Journal of Production Research"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Russell|first1=G. R.|last2=Fry|first2=T. D|title=Order review/release and lot splitting in drum-buffer-rope|date=1997|pages=35:827–845}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===High-speed automated production lines===
Automated production lines that are used in the beverage industry to fill containers usually have several machines executing parts of the complete process, from filling primary containers to secondary packaging and palletisation. These machines operate at different speeds and capacities and have varying efficiency levels.

To be able to maximize the throughput, the production line usually has a designed constraint. This constraint is typically the slowest and often the most expensive machine on the line. The overall throughput of the line is determined by this machine. All other machines can operate faster and are connected by conveyors.

The conveyors usually have the ability to buffer product. In the event of a stoppage at a machine other than the constraint, the conveyor can buffer the product enabling the constraint machine to keep on running.

A typical line setup is such that in normal operation the upstream conveyors from the constraint machine are always run full to prevent starvation at the constraint and the downstream conveyors are run empty to prevent a back up at the constraint. The overall aim is to prevent minor stoppages at the machines from impacting the constraint.

For this reason as the machines get further from the constraint, they have the ability to run faster than the previous machine and this creates a V curve.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}

===Supply chain and logistics===
In general, the solution for supply chains is to create flow of inventory so as to ensure greater availability and to eliminate surpluses.

The TOC distribution solution is effective when used to address a single link in the supply chain and more so across the entire system, even if that system comprises many different companies. The purpose of the TOC distribution solution is to establish a decisive competitive edge based on extraordinary availability by dramatically reducing the damages caused when the flow of goods is interrupted by shortages and surpluses.

This approach uses several new rules to protect availability with less inventory than is conventionally required. Before explaining these new rules, the term Replenishment Time must be defined. Replenishment Time (RT) is the sum of the delay, after the first consumption following a delivery, before an order is placed plus the delay after the order is placed until the ordered goods arrive at the ordering location.

# Inventory is held at an aggregation point(s) as close as possible to the source. This approach ensures smoothed demand at the aggregation point, requiring proportionally less inventory. The distribution centers holding the aggregated stock are able to ship goods downstream to the next link in the supply chain much more quickly than a make-to-order manufacturer can.
# Following this rule may result in a make-to-order manufacturer converting to make-to-stock.  The inventory added at the aggregation point is significantly less than the inventory reduction downstream.
# In all stocking locations, initial inventory buffers are set which effectively create an upper limit of the inventory at that location. The buffer size is equal to the maximum expected consumption within the average RT, plus additional stock to protect in case a delivery is late. In other words, there is no advantage in holding more inventory in a location than the amount that might be consumed before more could be ordered and received. Typically, the sum of the on hand value of such buffers are 25–75% less than currently observed average inventory levels.
# Once buffers have been established, no replenishment orders are placed as long as the quantity inbound (already ordered but not yet received) plus the quantity on hand are equal to or greater than the buffer size. Following this rule causes surplus inventory to be bled off as it is consumed.
# For any reason, when on hand plus inbound inventory is less than the buffer, orders are placed as soon as practical to increase the inbound inventory so that the relationship On Hand + Inbound = Buffer is maintained.
# To ensure buffers remain correctly sized even with changes in the rates of demand and replenishment, a simple recursive algorithm called Buffer Management is used.  When the on hand inventory level is in the upper third of the buffer for a full RT, the buffer is reduced by one third (and don’t forget rule 3).  Alternatively, when the on hand inventory is in the bottom one third of the buffer for too long, the buffer is increased by one third (and don’t forget rule 4).  The definition of “too long” may be changed depending on required service levels, however, a rule of thumb is 20% of the RT. Moving buffers up more readily than down is supported by the usually greater damage caused by shortages as compared to the damage caused by surpluses.

Once inventory is managed as described above, continuous efforts should be undertaken to reduce RT, late deliveries, supplier minimum order quantities (both per SKU and per order) and customer order batching. Any improvements in these areas will automatically improve both availability and inventory turns, thanks to the adaptive nature of Buffer Management.

A stocking location that manages inventory according to the TOC should help a non-TOC customer (downstream link in a supply chain, whether internal or external) manage their inventory according to the TOC process. This type of help can take the form of a vendor managed inventory (VMI). The TOC distribution link simply extends its buffer sizing and management techniques to its customers’ inventories. Doing so has the effect of smoothing the demand from the customer and reducing order sizes per SKU. VMI results in better availability and inventory turns for both supplier and customer. More than that, the benefits to the non-TOC customers are sufficient to meet the purpose of capitalizing on the decisive competitive edge by giving the customer a powerful reason to be more loyal and give more business to the upstream link. When the end consumers buy more, the whole supply chain sells more.

One caveat should be considered. Initially and only temporarily, the supply chain or a specific link may sell less as the surplus inventory in the system is sold.  However, the sales lift due to improved availability is a countervailing factor. The current levels of surpluses and shortages make each case different.

===Finance and accounting===
The solution for finance and accounting is to apply holistic thinking to the finance application. This has been termed [[throughput accounting]].&lt;ref name=tpa&gt;{{cite book |author=Corbett, Thomas |title=Throughput Accounting |publisher=North River Press |year=1998 |pages=160 |isbn=978-0-88427-158-1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughput accounting suggests that one examine the impact of investments and operational changes in terms of the impact on the throughput of the business.  It is an alternative to [[cost accounting]].

The primary measures for a TOC view of finance and accounting are: throughput, operating expense and investment. Throughput is calculated from sales minus "totally variable cost", where totally variable cost is usually calculated as the cost of raw materials that go into creating the item sold.&lt;ref name=tocma&gt;
{{cite book |author=Eric Noreen|author2=Debra Smith |author3=James T. Mackey  |title=The ''Theory of Constraints'' and its implications for Management Accounting |publisher=North River Press |year=1995 |isbn=0-88427-116-1 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=13–14}}

===Project management===
[[Critical Chain Project Management]] (CCPM) are utilized in this area.&lt;ref name=criticalchain&gt;{{cite book |author=Goldratt, Eliyahu M. |title=Critical Chain |publisher=North River Press |location=Great Barrington, MA |year=1997 |pages= |isbn=0-88427-153-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; CCPM is based on the idea that all projects look like A-plants: all activities converge to a final deliverable. As such, to protect the project, there must be internal buffers to protect synchronization points and a final project buffer to protect the overall project.

===Marketing and sales===
While originally focused on manufacturing and logistics, TOC has expanded lately into sales management and marketing. Its role is explicitly acknowledged in the field of [[sales process engineering]].&lt;ref name="Selden"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sales Process Engineering: A Personal Workshop |author = Paul H. Selden|publisher=ASQ Quality Press|location = Milwaukee, WI|year=1997|pages =33–35, 264–268|isbn=0-87389-418-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; For effective sales management one can apply Drum Buffer Rope to the sales process similar to the way it is applied to operations (see Reengineering the Sales Process book reference below). This technique is appropriate when your constraint is in the sales process itself, or if you just want an effective sales management technique which includes the topics of funnel management and conversion rates.{{Citation needed|date=December 2007}}

==Thinking processes==
{{main|Thinking processes (theory of constraints)}}
The thinking processes are a set of tools to help managers walk through the steps of initiating and implementing a project. When used in a logical flow, the thinking processes help walk through a buy-in process:
# Gain agreement on the problem
# Gain agreement on the direction for a solution
# Gain agreement that the solution solves the problem
# Agree to overcome any potential negative ramifications
# Agree to overcome any obstacles to implementation

TOC practitioners sometimes refer to these in the negative as working through ''layers of resistance'' to a change.

Recently, the ''[[Current reality tree (theory of constraints)|current reality tree]]'' (CRT) and ''future reality tree'' (FRT) have been applied to an argumentative academic paper.&lt;ref&gt;See the annex of: Vidal, C. 2008.[https://arxiv.org/abs/0803.1087 The Future of Scientific Simulations: from Artificial Life to Artificial Cosmogenesis]. In Death And Anti-Death , ed. Charles Tandy, 6: Thirty Years After Kurt Gödel (1906–1978) pp. 285-318. Ria University Press.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its origins as a manufacturing approach (Goldratt &amp; Cox, The Goal: A process of Ongoing Improvement, 1992), Goldratt's Theory of Constraints (TOC) methodology is now regarded as a systems methodology with strong foundations in the hard sciences (Mabin, 1999). Through its tools for convergent thinking and synthesis, the “Thinking processes”, which underpin the entire TOC methodology, help identify and manage constraints and guide continuous improvement and change in organizations (Dettmer H. , 1998).

The process of change requires the identification and acceptance of core issues; the goal and the means to the goal. This comprehensive set of logical tools can be used for exploration, solution development and solution implementation for individuals, groups or organizations. Each tool has a purpose and nearly all tools can be used independently (Cox &amp; Spencer, 1998). Since these thinking tools are designed to address successive “layers of resistance” and enable communication, it expedites securing “buy in” of groups. While CRT (current reality tree) represents the undesirable effects of the current situation, the FRT (the future reality tree), NBR (negative branch) help people plan and understand the possible results of their actions. The PRT (prerequisite tree) and TRT (transition tree) are designed to build collective buy in and aid in the Implementation phase. The logical constructs of these tools or diagrams are the necessary condition logic, the sufficient cause logic and the strict logic rules that are used to validate cause-effect relationships which are modelled with these tools (Dettmer W. , 2006).

A summary of these tools, the questions they help answer and the associated logical constructs used is presented in the table below.

'''TOC Thinking Process Tools:'''
Use of these tools are based on the fundamental beliefs of TOC that organizations a) are inherently simple (interdependencies exist in organizations) b) desire inherent harmony (win – win solutions are possible) c) are inherently good (people are good) and have inherent potential (people and organizations have potential to do better) (Goldratt E. , 2009). In the book “Through the clouds to solutions” Jelena Fedurko (Fedurko, 2013) states that the major areas for application of TP tools as:
* To create and enhance thinking and learning skills
* To make better decisions
* To develop responsibility for one’s own actions through understanding their consequences
* To handle conflicts with more confidence and win-win outcomes
* To correct behavior with undesirable consequences
* Assist in evaluating conditions for achieving a desired outcome
* To assist in peer mediation
* To assist in relationship between subordinates and bosses{{citation needed|date=July 2016}}

==Development and practice==
TOC was initiated by Goldratt, who until his recent death was still the main driving force behind the development and practice of TOC. There is a network of individuals and small companies loosely coupled as practitioners around the world. TOC is sometimes referred to as "constraint management". TOC is a large body of knowledge with a strong guiding philosophy of growth.

==Criticism==
Criticisms that have been leveled against TOC include:

===Claimed suboptimality of drum-buffer-rope===
While TOC has been compared favorably to linear programming techniques,&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal |doi = 10.1049/me:20020411 |first1 = Mabel |last1 = Qui |first2 = Lawrence |last2 = Fredendall |first3 = Zhiwei |last3 = Zhu |title = TOC or LP? [production control] |journal = Manufacturing Engineer|volume = 81 |issue = 4 | year = 2002| pages = 190–195 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; D. Trietsch from University of Auckland argues that DBR methodology is inferior to competing methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Trietsch | first1 = D. | year = 2005 | title = From Management by Constraints (MBC) to Management By Criticalities (MBC II) | url = http://ac.aua.am/trietsch/web/MBC_to_MBC_II.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Human Systems Management | volume = 24 | issue = | pages = 105–115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://ac.aua.am/trietsch/web/WorkingPaper281.pdf D.

&lt;/ref&gt;
says that TOC borrows heavily from [[System dynamics|systems dynamics]] developed by [[Jay Forrester|Forrester]] in the 1950s and from [[statistical process control]] which dates back to World War II. And Noreen Smith and Mackey, in their independent report on TOC, point out that several key concepts in TOC "have been topics in management accounting textbooks for decades."&lt;ref name=tocma/&gt;{{rp|page=149}}

People claim{{Citation needed|date=November 2007}} Goldratt's books fail to acknowledge that TOC borrows from more than 40 years of previous management science research and practice, particularly from [[program evaluation and review technique]]/[[critical path method]] (PERT/CPM) and the [[Just-in-time (business)|just in time]] strategy. A rebuttal to these criticisms is offered in Goldratt's "What is the ''Theory of Constraints'' and How Should it be Implemented?", and in his audio program, "Beyond The Goal". In these, Goldratt discusses the history of disciplinary sciences, compares the strengths and weaknesses of the various disciplines, and acknowledges the sources of information and inspiration for the thinking processes and critical chain methodologies. Articles published in the now-defunct Journal of ''Theory of Constraints'' referenced foundational materials. Goldratt published an article&lt;ref name=giants&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Goldratt|first1=Eliyahu M.|title=Standing on the shoulders of giants: production concepts versus production applications. The Hitachi Tool Engineering example.|journal=Gestão &amp; produção|date=2009|volume=16|issue=3|pages=333–343|url=http://www.scielo.br/scielo.php?pid=S0104-530X2009000300002&amp;script=sci_arttext|accessdate=2015-12-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and gave talks&lt;ref name=giantsvideo&gt;{{cite video |author=Eliyahu Goldratt | title=Standing on the Shoulders of Giants | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C3RPFUh3ePQ}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the title "Standing on the Shoulders of Giants" in which he gives credit for many of the core ideas of Theory of Constraints. Goldratt has sought many times to show the correlation between various improvement methods.

Goldratt has been criticized on lack of openness in his theories, an example being him not releasing the algorithm he used for the Optimum Performance Training system.&lt;ref name=rahman1998&gt;Rahman, Shams-ur. "Theory of constraints: a review of the philosophy and its applications." International Journal of Operations &amp; Production Management 18.4 (1998): 336-355.
&lt;/ref&gt; Some view him as unscientific with many of his theories, tools and techniques not being a part of the public domain, rather a part of his own framework of profiting on his ideas.
According to Gupta and Snyder (2009), despite being recognized as a genuine management philosophy nowadays, TOC has yet failed to demonstrate its effectiveness in the academic literature and as such, cannot be considered academically worthy enough to be called a widely recognized theory. TOC needs more case studies that prove a connection between implementation and improved financial performance.&lt;ref name=gupta2009&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
Nave (2002) argues that TOC does not take employees into account and fails to empower them in the production process. He also states that TOC fails to address unsuccessful policies as constraints.&lt;ref name=nave2002&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;
In contrast, Mukherjee and Chatterjee (2007) state that much of the criticism of Goldratt’s work has been focused on the lack of rigour in his work, but not of the bottleneck approach, which are two different aspects of the issue.&lt;ref&gt;Mukherjee, S.M. and Chatterjee, A.K. (2007). The concept of bottleneck. Working Paper No. 2006-05-01, IIM Ahmedabad&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification and education==
The Theory of Constraints International Certification Organization (TOCICO) is an independent not-for-profit incorporated society that sets exams to ensure a consistent standard of competence. It is overseen by a board&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tocico.org/?page=tocico_board|title=TOCICO Board of Directors - Theory of Constraints International Certification Organization|author=|date=|website=www.tocico.org|accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{secondary source needed|date=December 2015}} of academic and industrial experts.  It also hosts an annual international conference. The work presented at these conferences constitutes a core repository of the current knowledge.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1351">"'''What the Dead Men Say'''" is a [[science fiction]] [[novella]] by American writer [[Philip K. Dick]], first published in ''[[Worlds of Tomorrow (magazine)|Worlds of Tomorrow]]'' magazine in June 1964. The manuscript, originally titled "Man With a Broken Match", was received by Dick's agent on 15 April 1963.

==Plot summary==
[[Death]] is followed by a period of '[[half-life]]', a short amount of time which can be rationed out over long periods in which the dead can be revived—so that, potentially, they can 'live' on for a long time. When attempts to bring back important businessman Louis Sarapis fail, it's clearly more than mere negligence. Sure enough, Sarapis starts speaking from beyond the grave. From [[outer space]], in fact. Yet no-one seems terribly bothered, other than those directly concerned in the plot mechanics. Eventually entire [[communications networks]] (phones, TV, radio) are blocked by Sarapis' broadcasts.

The concept of 'half-life' was used again and developed in Dick's 1969 novel ''[[Ubik]]'', which even re-uses a page of the novella verbatim.
