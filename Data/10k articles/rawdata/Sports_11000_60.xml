'''Affliction Clothing''' is an American clothing manufacturer and retailer based in [[Seal Beach, California]].&lt;ref name="Entrepreneur Magazine"/&gt; It is owned by Affliction Holdings LLC.

== History ==
Affliction Clothing was launched in August 2005 by Courtney Dubar, Todd Beard, Nicole Behrle, Eric Foss, and Clifton Chason.  In 2012, Courtney Dubar (current CEO) bought Todd Beard’s portions of the company, making him majority shareholder of Affliction Clothing.{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

== Products ==
Affliction's clothing line includes men’s and women’s T-shirts, polo shirts, thermals, button downs, hoodies, denim, dresses, watches, headwear, shorts, and swimwear. While the company has deep roots in the [[Mixed martial arts|MMA]] community, its “Live Fast” motto represents and appeals to audiences who appreciate a variety of disciplines and eras such as [[Rock &amp; Roll]], Moto Culture, [[Tattoo]], Vintage Americana, [[Mixed martial arts clothing|Mixed Martial Arts]] and Impact Sports. The ''Signature Series'' of Affliction shirts bear the logos of many of the world's top-ranked [[Mixed Martial Arts|MMA fighters]], including [[Randy Couture]], [[Georges St-Pierre]], [[Fedor Emelianenko]], [[Quinton Jackson]], and [[Renato Sobral]] and boxers, including [[Oscar De La Hoya]], [[Shane Mosley]], and Zab Judah. Affliction has also produced ''signature'' shirts in collaboration with musicians like [[Avenged Sevenfold]], [[Ozzy Osbourne]], [[Black Sabbath]], [[Megadeth]], [[Pantera]], [[Korn]], [[Staind]], [[Static-X]], [[Testament (band)|Testament]], [[Shadows Fall]], [[Atreyu (band)|Atreyu]], [[Behemoth]], and [[Biohazard (band)|Biohazard]]. Designs incorporate graphic images of angel wings, roses, skulls, skeletons, crosses, and swords.

Affliction was a longtime sponsor of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]] (UFC) and its fighters, until 2008, when it broke ranks and formed [[Affliction Entertainment]] to compete with the UFC. As a result, UFC banned its fighters from wearing Affliction branded clothing.&lt;ref name="ClowBaack2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clow|first1=Kenneth E.|last2=Baack|first2=Donald|title=Cases in Marketing Management|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fI74N3u4USwC&amp;pg=PA115|year=2012|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-1-4129-9603-7|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== American Fighter ===
''American Fighter'' is a clothing and sports equipment company.  Trademarked in 2006, it became a registered trademark of Affliction Holdings LLC on April 22, 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trademarkia.com/american-fighter-78974979.html|title=American Fighter}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several fighters have been sponsored by this sub brand, including [[Rich Franklin]].

=== Archaic ===

=== Sinful ===
''Sinful'' is a clothing line specifically designed for women, as part of Affliction Inc., and is the sister brand to Affliction men's clothing. Its T-shirts, pants, and hoodies often feature a mix of spirited elements, including angels, angel wings, doves, crosses, burning hearts, roses and skulls.

=== Throwdown ===
''Throwdown'' was founded as a hard goods company, positioning its products and services within the market of Mixed Martial Arts and the Combative Sports Industry. Affliction joined forces with Throwdown to develop a full clothing brand in order to complement the already successful hard goods line with items such as protective gear, training bags, cages and rings. Throwdown clothing is sold internationally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.honcho-sfx.com/affliction-m4 Affliction Clothing UK]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Xtreme Couture'' clothing was founded in 2006 by Affliction, in a partnership with [[Randy Couture]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120818140148/http://www.xtremecoutureclothing.com/about/ Xtreme Couture]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sponsorship ==
In June 2011, Affliction sponsored a photo contest in which the prize was a custom [[Harley-Davidson]] worth $25,000 or $12,000. These motorcycles were:
* A men’s 2010 Harley-Davidson Softail ‘crossbones’ American Customs Harley-Davidson customized Motorcycle with 1584 Twin cam 96B counterbalanced engine – worth about $25,000 after customizations.

'''Alush Noga Stadium''' is a multi-use [[stadium]] in [[Patos]], [[Albania]]. The stadium has a capacity of 2,150 people and it is mostly used for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches and it is the home ground of [[KS Albpetrol]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.panorama-sport.com/albpetrol/ Panorama Sport]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldstadiums.com/europe/countries/albania.shtml World Stadiums]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Following [[KF Albpetrol]]'s promotion to the [[Albanian First Division]] in 2013, [[Patos, Albania|Patos Municipality]] funded the reconstruction of the stadium which was previously just a playing field surrounded by grass where a total of 4,000 to 5,000 spectators were able to stand or sit on to see the field from an elevated position. The stadium had just one main stand which housed all of the facilities on offer, and in September 2013 work began on the construction of concrete stands to turn the stadium into an all seater with a capacity of around 3,000. 

In 2016 the stadium received 2,100 plastic seats from the [[Qemal Stafa Stadium]] following its demolition, and the seats were installed onto the concrete stands which lowered the capacity to around 2,150 including the existing VIP seating in the main stand.

== History ==
Amart Sports was founded in 1976 with the first store located in [[Underwood, Queensland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.amartsports.com.au/helpdesk/about-amart/about-us/|title=About Amart Sports|website=www.amartsports.com.au|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then Amart Sports expanded throughout [[Australia]] and has over 60 stores - mainly in homemaker destination centres across Queensland, Victoria, South Australia, New South Wales and Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.superretailgroup.com.au/about-us/amart-all-sports/|title=Amart Sports - Super Retail Group|website=www.superretailgroup.com.au|access-date=2016-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Super Retail Group, who also operates [[Rebel Sport]], acquired the Amart Sports business in November 2011.

On 24 July 2017, after failing to compete with superior regional sporting goods retailers, it was announced that Super Retail Group will convert its network of Amart Sports stores into new Rebel stores by 31 October 2017, expanding the Rebel brand's national footprint to almost 160 stores in Australia. The Amart Sports brand was discontinued as of 1 November 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://media.supercheapauto.com.au/corp/files/documents/ASX%20Release%20-%20Supe.pdf|title=Super Retail Group provides update on Sports Division brand portfolio|date=24 July 2017|access-date=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Fred Bramlage Coliseum''' is a 12,528-seat multi-purpose [[List of indoor arenas|arena]] in [[Manhattan, Kansas]]. The arena's primary function is as home to the [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|men's]] and [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball|women's]] [[basketball]] teams for [[Kansas State University]]. The building also holds offices for [[Kansas State Wildcats baseball]], Intercollegiate Athletics, and Sports Information.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kstatesports.com/facilities/bramlage-coliseum.html Bramlage Coliseum - Kansas State University Wildcats Official Athletics Site]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101101072937/http://www.kstatesports.com/facilities/bramlage-coliseum.html |date=November 1, 2010  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emporia.edu/business/kbhfcontdetail.php?k_id=23 Fred Bramlage Bio] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100601210434/http://www.emporia.edu/business/kbhfcontdetail.php?k_id=23 |date=June 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Construction and usage==
The arena is located in the northwest corner of the Kansas State campus, along with the rest of the school's athletic facilities, abutting the south end zone of [[Bill Snyder Family Football Stadium]].

The arena was built to replace [[Ahearn Field House]], K-State's basketball facility from 1950 to 1988. Construction of Bramlage Coliseum began with a groundbreaking on October 18, 1986, and was completed in 1988.  The construction was funded entirely by student fees and donations from alumni and friends of the University.

It was named for Junction City businessman Fred Bramlage, who played a major role in raising the funds needed to build the arena.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/fred-bramlage/18155&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 26, 1988, Kansas State University officially opened Bramlage Coliseum with an 81-77 victory over [[Purdue University]]. The first basketball game actually played in the arena, however, was an [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] exhibition game between the [[Dallas Mavericks]], led by former K-State standout [[Rolando Blackman]], and the [[San Antonio Spurs]] on October 21, 1988.

As of February 16, 2016, the [[Kansas State Wildcats men's basketball]] team has posted a 328-105 (.758) record in Bramlage Coliseum. Since the inception of "The Octagon of Doom" title in the 2007-2008 season, the home record is 124-23 (.845).

The facility hosted [[NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Championship|women's NCAA basketball tournament]] games in [[2002 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|2002]] and [[2003 NCAA Women's Division I Basketball Tournament|2003]].  Kansas State played in Bramlage Coliseum in both tournament years.

Bramlage has also been home to the [[Kansas State High School Activities Association]] Class 2A boys and girls state championship tournaments since 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newsgroup|title=High school state Basketball sites |date=January 31, 2010 |newsgroup=Kansas State High School Activities Association |url=http://www.kshsaa.org/BASKETBALL/bskchmp.html |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080424073225/http://www.kshsaa.org/BASKETBALL/bskchmp.html |archivedate=2008-04-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical displays===
The concourse around the arena is decorated with pictures of Wildcat greats and trophies won by the men's and women's teams over the years. A painted border around the top of the walls inside the Coliseum shows the years the Wildcat basketball programs won conference crowns or participated in the NCAA Tournament or NIT (WNIT). Hanging from the rafters in Bramlage are the retired numbers of former Wildcat greats including: [[Ernie Barrett]], [[Rolando Blackman]], [[Mitch Richmond]], [[Bob Boozer]], [[Mike Evans (basketball)|Mike Evans]], [[Dick Knostman]], [[Lon Kruger]], [[Jack Parr (basketball)|Jack Parr]], [[Chuckie Williams]], [[Nicole Ohlde]], [[Kendra Wecker]] and [[Shalee Lehning]].

==Traditions==
The unofficial nickname for Bramlage Coliseum is "The Octagon of Doom," due to the building's eight sides. The nickname was popularized in the media during the 2009-2010 season, but it was first used in on-line [[internet forum]]s in early 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=Kansas State Fans Delight in Their 'Octagon of Doom' |newspaper=Kansas City Star |date=January 28, 2010 |url=http://www.kansascity.com/sports/story/1714954.html |accessdate=2010-02-04 |postscript= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100202055118/http://www.kansascity.com/sports/story/1714954.html |archivedate=February 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newsgroup |title=The History of "The Octagon of Doom"|date=January 31, 2010|newsgroup=goemaw.com|url=http://goemaw.com/forum/index.php?topic=468.0|accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; K-State students bring octagonal shaped signs with "Doom" written on them and wear "Doom" T-shirts to games.

Before every game, the crowd sings [[Wildcat Victory]], the Kansas State fight song, and then rocks back and forth to the [[Wabash Cannonball]]. As the K-State players make their way from the locker room to the court, the crowd chants, "Bring on the Cats, Bring on the Cats, Bring on the Cats."  When the Cats hit the floor the crowd erupts and rises to their feet. While the opposing team's starting lineup is announced, the [[student section]] shakes newspapers, and after each name chants, "So What"  "Who Cares"  "Who's He?"  "Big Deal"  "Go Home," and then rips the papers and throws them in the air at the beginning of the introduction of the Kansas State starting lineup.  Each time an opposing player commits a foul the student section chants the number of fouls that player has, and every time a K-State player sinks a three-point basket, the announcer says the name of the player followed by "for", and then the crowd echoes "three!"  Following a K-State victory, the crowd performs a "K-S-U Wildcats" chant. If an opposing team's player fouls out of the game, the crowd chants "left, right, left" for each step. If he stands, they chant "standing, standing" until the player sits down, at which time the crowd yells "Sit down!"

==Seating capacity==
Seating capacity in Bramlage was originally 13,500.  Adjustments for fire codes lowered this number to 13,340 in the 2000s, and construction prior to the [[2007-08 NCAA Division I men's basketball season|2007-2008 season]] eliminated another approximately 800 seats to add [[luxury box]]es and bring handicap seating up to compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=K-State Has Grand Plans|newspaper=The Topeka Capital-Journal|date=June 26, 2007|url=http://cjonline.com/stories/062607/cat_180019837.shtml|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current capacity is 12,528.

The '''Brisbane Rugby League Premiership''' is a [[rugby league football]]  competition in [[Brisbane]], [[Queensland]], [[Australia]]. It was first held in 1922 and for every year until 1997. The competition was reinstated in 2016, replacing the [[FOGS competition]] under the [[Queensland cup]]. The competition consists of Brisbane’s top six rugby league clubs. Each participating team is a feeder club for the [[Queensland Cup]].

Prior to 1922, the competition was conducted under the auspices of the [[Queensland Rugby League]]. Until the 1980s it was the premier sporting competition in Brisbane, attracting large crowds and broad media coverage. The Brisbane Rugby League however, had been in slow decline for some 15 years as large numbers of its players left to compete in the more lucrative [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|Sydney Rugby League premiership]], and began to lose popular interest with the creation of the [[Brisbane Broncos]] in 1988. The Brisbane Rugby League premiership was replaced by the [[Queensland Cup]] before the 1998 season. In 2016 the competition was reinstated with the [[Redcliffe Dolphins]] winning the competition that year.

==History==

===Establishment of the Queensland Rugby League===
The [[Queensland Rugby Football League]] (QRFL) was formed in 1908 by seven former [[rugby union]] players who were dissatisfied with the administration of the [[Queensland Rugby Union]] (QRU). The new organisation was attacked by both the local press and the QRU for introducing professionalism, which they claimed would destroy the sport. The "founding fathers" of the QARFL included [[John Fihelly]], an [[Australian Labor Party]] Member of Parliament who became Minister for Railways and Deputy Premier.

The first official club competition kicked off in Brisbane on 8 May 1909. [[Norths Devils|Norths]] played against [[Souths Magpies|Souths]] before a handful of spectators at [[Brisbane Cricket Ground]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Matches were played under the auspices of the Queensland Amateur Rugby Football League (later renamed Queensland Rugby League). The foundation clubs were:

* [[Norths Devils|North Brisbane]]
* [[Fortitude Valley Diehards|Fortitude Valley]]
* [[Souths Magpies|South Brisbane]]
* [[Nundah, Queensland|Toombul]]

===Schism: establishment of the Brisbane Rugby League===
In 1922 the Brisbane Rugby Football League (Brisbane Rugby Football League, later Brisbane Rugby League) was formed out of dissatisfaction with the way the Queensland Rugby League ran the game. Those involved took particular exception to the salary being earned by [[Harry Sunderland]] as secretary of the Queensland Rugby League. The Brisbane Rugby League took control of the local competition. Competing in the Brisbane Rugby League competition that year were Brothers, Carltons, Coorparoo, University, Valley and Past Grammars. Although the Queensland Rugby League attempted to regain control of the Brisbane Rugby League competition in 1923 and 1924, the Brisbane Rugby League remained steadfast and the dispute simmered into the next decade. so dire did the situation become, that by the late 1920s, the Queensland Rugby League commenced its own competition involving Ipswich clubs and two supporting Brisbane clubs.

Until 1932 [[Brisbane Exhibition Ground]] was the home of rugby league in the city. The complicated arrangement between the Brisbane Rugby League, Queensland Rugby League and Royal National Association (who administered the Exhibition Ground) led to [[Brisbane Cricket Ground]] being used for rugby league matches.

In 1933 district football was introduced to provide community support and player equalisation. This meant that players had to live within a certain distance of their club. Accordingly, Brisbane was divided into [[Eastern Suburbs (Brisbane)|Eastern Suburbs]] (incorporating Coorparoo and Wynnum), [[Southern Suburbs (Brisbane)|Southern Suburbs]] (incorporating Carltons), [[Western Suburbs (Brisbane)|Western Suburbs]], [[Northern Suburbs (Brisbane)|Northern Suburbs]] (incorporating Past Grammars), [[Fortitude Valley]] and [[Past Brothers]] (whose players had to prove that they had attended a Christian Brothers school). In 1934, the University Amateur Rugby League Club folded and disappeared from the competition.

In 1953 the friction between the Queensland Rugby League and Brisbane Rugby League ended, with the Brisbane Rugby League being replaced by the Brisbane division of the Queensland Rugby League.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Teams that joined the Brisbane Rugby League competition around this time were South Coast (1952–1953), [[Wynnum-Manly]] (1951) and [[Redcliffe City, Queensland|Redcliffe]] (1960).

A record crowd at Lang Park of 19,824 saw Northern Suburbs defeat Fortitude Valley in the Brisbane Rugby League grand final in September 1961.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

  | accessdate = 2010-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Decline===
In 1967 the Queensland Rugby League removed the residential qualifications for players in Brisbane Rugby League clubs, meaning that players did not have to reside in their certain suburbs to play for their teams. This reduced community support for teams, and club decisions began to be made on a more commercial basis.

This coincided with the commencement of television broadcasts of Brisbane Rugby League games in the same year. The money made from jersey sponsorships and advertising hoardings at grounds was not able to compete with poker machine money available to Sydney Rugby League clubs in the [[New South Wales Rugby League|Sydney Rugby League]], and an increasing number of players left the Brisbane Rugby League. This also affected the popularity of the [[Bulimba Cup (rugby league competition)|Bulimba Cup]] which had been held between the cities of Brisbane, Ipswich and Toowoomba since the 1930s.

The effect of television coverage on attendances became pronounced by the mid-1970s and crowds began to desert the Brisbane Rugby League competition. Clubs found themselves in financial hardship, and the public began to support the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership|Sydney Rugby League]] which by then was being broadcast in Queensland. In 1978 the premiership trophy, the Kirks Cup was replaced by the Winfield Cup.

The Queensland Rugby League commissioned Eric White Associates to investigate the administrative structure of the game in Queensland in 1977. One of the recommendations was the creation of a statewide competition. The [[Winfield State League]] was created in 1982. The State League competition ran in parallel to the Brisbane Rugby League competition from 1982 to 1995. Also, like with Sydney's competition, Brisbane's competition was also called the Winfield Cup during the 1980s, due to sponsorship from [[Winfield cigarettes]]. The [[Queensland Cup]] would eventually replace both the State league and the Brisbane Rugby League premiership in 1998.

In the 1980s, two further teams were added to the Brisbane Rugby League competition: [[Ipswich Jets|Ipswich]] (1986) and [[Logan Scorpions|Logan]] (1987).

In 1986 the New South Wales Rugby League decided to allow a team from Brisbane to enter the Sydney Rugby League premiership. The [[Brisbane Broncos]] debuted in the Sydney Rugby League premiership in [[New South Wales Rugby League season 1988|1988]]. As the Broncos began to represent Brisbane at rugby league in the public eye the Brisbane Rugby League competition entered the terminal phase of its decline. Indeed, 1987, the year before the Broncos commenced playing, was the last year that a Brisbane Rugby League player would be selected to play for Queensland in the State of Origin series.

The Brisbane Rugby League premiership was fully superseded by the Queensland Cup competition in 1998. Redcliffe won the last Brisbane Rugby League Grand Final in 1997 defeating Easts 35–6.

===Rebirth===
On September 26, 2014, the South East Queensland Division announced that they will be scrapping the existing [[Brisbane A-Grade Rugby League|FOGS Cup]] structure and reforming the Brisbane Rugby League as the state's secondary competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==Quotes==
* "Well that is a tragedy, to be honest with you. There's no club identity at all now. If you don't follow the Broncos well who do you follow? That means you've got to follow a New South Wales side. I think I'm sure that's what McAuliffe didn't want to happen. But when they brought in the Queensland side into the NSWRL that was the end of the Brisbane Rugby League, as far as that was concerned. It should never have happened because as it turned out, if we did lose players from Queensland to go to New South Wales we had the State of Origin. We've been winning the State of Origin, and you can imagine if we were keeping our players, the club competition would be just as good as what it was when I was playing. But that is a tragedy as far as I'm concerned is that the people miss that club identity." ''-[[Barry Muir]], in 2001, on the decline of the Brisbane Rugby League and the rise of the [[New South Wales Rugby League premiership]].''
* "Yeah well the crowd was great, they supported you wholeheartedly, they came along but it wasn't only down here on the football field it was on the streets up there. People would come up and talk to you, they'd stop you in the street and get your autograph and have a talk to you and wish you all the best and really support you in what you were doing and lifting the Club. There was four or five players here that were top-line footballers and we used to go up on the terrace and sell raffles in front of McCarthy's Jewellers store on the terrace and we'd do an hour there and then pop down to the Manly Hotel and do an hour there and then we'd pop down to Fishers (pub) and do an hour there. The players were prepared to do it because they were getting the support from this area and they would give it back on the playing field and however they could meet the people on the streets. I don't think anyone turned away from you, it was just one big happy family. We used to have like a barbecue after the game and there'd be 100 or 200 people that would turn up for the barbecue, we had it at various areas." ''-[[Lionel Morgan (rugby league)|Lionel Morgan]], in 2001, on the support of the Brisbane Rugby League in the Wynnum-Manly district.''

The '''[[Central African Republic]]''' made its [[Paralympic Games]] début at the [[2004 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Athens]]. It sent a single athlete, [[Thibaut Bomaya]], to compete in [[powerlifting]]. The country also entered a single-man delegation at the [[2008 Summer Paralympics]] in [[Beijing]], where [[Rosel-Clemariot-Christian Nikoua]] competed in [[shot put]]. The Central African Republic has never taken part in the Winter Paralympics, and has never won a Paralympic medal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.paralympic.org/Sport/Results/search.html?npc=CAF&amp;gender=all&amp;medal=all&amp;sport=all&amp;games=all Central African Republic at the Paralympics], [[International Paralympic Committee]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Central African Republic will be taking part in the [[2012 Summer Paralympics]], and the [[Comité National Paralympique Centrafricain]] have chosen [[Bedford]] as the UK training base for its Paralympians.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bedford.gov.uk/council_and_democracy/council_news/archived_news/february_2012/on_your_marks.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

{{short description|Archaic and derogatory baseball term for a home run that barely clears the nearest outfield fence}}
[[File:1954 World Series game two.jpeg|thumb|right|The short right field fence at the Polo Grounds|alt=A black and white image of right field and first base in a baseball diamond in a large stadium with filled stands. A runner is rounding first.]]
In [[baseball]], a '''Chinese home run''', also a '''Chinese homer''', '''Harlem home run''',&lt;ref name="Teaching Tolerance"&gt;{{cite web|title=Origins: A simple word game for use in human relations trainings|url=http://www.tolerance.org/sites/default/files/documents/wordorigins_upper_handout2.pdf|publisher=[[Teaching Tolerance]]|page=6|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or '''Pekinese poke''',&lt;ref name="Dickson definition"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dickson|first=Paul|title=The Dickson Baseball Dictionary|date=2011|publisher=[[W.W. Norton &amp; Co.]]|location=New York|isbn=9780393073492|pages=182–84|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ceeU7xSLw5kC&amp;pg=PA182|edition=3d|editor=Skip McAfee|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a derogatory and archaic term for a hit that just barely clears the [[outfield]] fence at its closest distance to [[home plate]]. It is essentially the shortest [[home run]] possible in the ballpark in question, particularly if the park has an atypically short fence to begin with. The term was most commonly used in reference to home runs hit along the [[right field]] [[Glossary of baseball terms#foul lines|foul line]] at the [[Polo Grounds]], home of the [[History of the New York Giants (NL)|New York Giants]], where that distance was short even by contemporary standards. When the Giants moved to [[San Francisco Giants|San Francisco]] in 1958, the [[Los Angeles Coliseum]], temporary home of the newly relocated [[Los Angeles Dodgers]], gained the same reputation for four seasons until the team took up residence in its permanent home at [[Dodger Stadium]] in 1962. Following two seasons of use by the [[expansion team|expansion]] [[New York Mets]] in the early 1960s, the Polo Grounds were demolished, and the term gradually dropped out of use.&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

Why these home runs were called "Chinese" is not definitely known, but it is believed to have reflected an [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|early 20th-century perception]] that [[Chinese American|Chinese immigrants]] to the United States did [[History of Chinese Americans#Indispensable workforce|the menial labor they were consigned to with a bare minimum of adequacy, and were content with minimal reward for it]]. A [[Tad Dorgan]] cartoon has been proposed as the likely origin, but that has not been proven; the earliest known use is in a 1927 newspaper account of a [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]-[[Philadelphia Phillies]] game. In the 1950s, an extended take on the term in the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' led [[Chinese in New York City|the city's Chinese-American community]] to ask sportswriters not to use it.&lt;ref name="Bill Madden book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Madden|first1=Bill|authorlink=Bill Madden (sportswriter)|title=1954: The Year Willie Mays and the First Generation of Black Superstars Changed Major League Baseball Forever|date=2014|publisher=[[Da Capo Press]]|isbn=9780306823329|page=242|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6vMdBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This perception of ethnic insensitivity has further contributed to its disuse.&lt;ref name="SB Nation post"&gt;{{cite web|last=Neyer|first=Rob|title=Seven things you can't say on (baseball) television|url=https://www.sbnation.com/2013/5/8/4312552/dirty-words-baseball-television-george-carlin|publisher=[[SB Nation]]|date=May 8, 2013|accessdate=March 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been [[usage|used]] to disparage not only the hit but the batter, since it implies minimal effort on his part. Giants' outfielder [[Mel Ott]], who hit many such home runs in the Polo Grounds during his career, was a frequent target of this as his physique and unusual batting stance were not those associated with a [[power hitter]]. The hit most frequently recalled as a Chinese home run was the three-run [[pinch hit]] [[walk-off home run|walk-off shot]] by [[Dusty Rhodes (outfielder)|Dusty Rhodes]] that won the first game of the [[1954 World Series]] for the Giants on their way to a sweep of the [[Cleveland Indians]].

A secondary meaning, which continues today, is of a [[foul ball]] that travels high and far, often behind home plate. However, this appears to be confined to [[sandlot baseball|sandlot]] and high-school games in [[New England English|New England]]. Research into this usage suggests that it may not, in fact, have had anything initially to do with Chinese people, but is instead a [[corruption (linguistics)|corruption]] of "Chaney's home run", from a foul by a player of that name which supposedly won a game when the ball thus hit, the only one remaining, could not be found.&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

==Etymology==
{{wiktionary|Chinese home run}}
As early as the late 19th century, baseball players and fans had recognized that parks with shorter distances to the foul poles and back fence allowed for home runs that were regarded as undeserved or unearned, since [[Batted ball|fly balls]] of the same distance hit closer to or in [[Baseball field#outfield|center field]] could easily be caught for [[Out (baseball)|outs]]. In 1896 Jim Nolan of the ''[[The Daily News (Texas)|Daily News]]'' of [[Galveston, Texas]], reporting on the expansion of the local ballpark, wrote: "The enlarged size of the grounds will enable the outfielders to cover more ground and take in fly balls that went for cheap home runs before. Batsmen will have to earn their triples and home runs hereafter".&lt;ref name="ADS O'Toole post"&gt;{{cite mailing list|url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2010-November/104287.html|title=And in (additional) honor of the Giants' World Series win... |date=November 4, 2010|accessdate=March 12, 2015|mailing-list=ADS-L|last=O'Toole|first=Grant}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 Jonathan E. Lighter, editor of the ''[[Historical Dictionary of American Slang]]'',&lt;ref name="UTK news Lighter page"&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Slang|url=https://news.utk.edu/1992/04/28/slang/|location=[[Knoxville, Tennessee]]|publisher=[[University of Tennessee]]|date=April 28, 1992|access-date=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HDAS Google Books page"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Random House Historical Dictionary of American Slang: H-O|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dKEYAAAAIAAJ|accessdate=April 18, 2018|isbn=9780679434641|last1=Lighter|first1=Jonathan E.|date=1997-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; posted on the [[American Dialect Society]]'s (ADS) [[listserv]] that he had found the earliest use of the term "Chinese home run" for that type of hit in a [[Charleroi, Pennsylvania]], newspaper's 1927 account of a [[Philadelphia Phillies]] game against the [[Pittsburgh Pirates]]: "The Phillies went into a deadlock on [[Cy Williams|Cy]]'s Chinese homer only to see the Buccos hammer over four runs a little later."&lt;ref name="Lighter ADS post 1"&gt;{{cite mailing list|url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2010-November/104275.html|title=And in (additional) honor of the Giants' World Series win... |date=November 3, 2010|accessdate=April 18, 2015|mailing-list=ADS-L|last=Lighter|first=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This predates by three years the earliest use that [[Paul Dickson (writer)|Paul Dickson]] found when researching ''The Dickson Baseball Dictionary''. In a 1930 ''[[Washington Post]]'' story, writer Brian Bell quoted [[Dan Howley]], [[manager (baseball)|manager]] of the [[Cincinnati Reds]], defending the hitting prowess of [[Harry Heilmann]], who was then finishing his career under Howley. "[They] were real home runs", Howley said, pointing out how far from the field they had landed. "They were not Chinese home runs in that short bleacher at right", referring to the back fence on the foul line at the [[Polo Grounds]], a mere {{convert|258|ft}} from home.&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;
[[File:Thomas A. Dorgan.png|thumb|200px|left|Cartoonist [[Tad Dorgan]] may have popularized the term.]]
Dickson reiterated the results of two attempts in the 1950s to determine the term's origin, following its widespread use in stories. After Rhodes' home run, Joseph Sheehan of ''[[The New York Times]]'' made the first attempt. His research took him to Garry Schumacher, a former baseball writer then working as the Giants' press relations executive, who had himself been known for creating some baseball terms that went into wide use. Schumacher told him that he believed [[Tad Dorgan]], a cartoonist popular in the early decades of the 20th century, had introduced it, probably in one of his widely read ''Indoor Sports'' [[Panel (comics)|panels]].&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT Sheehan 1954 article"&gt;{{cite news|last=Sheehan|first=Joseph|title='Chinese Homer': How it All Began|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1954/10/01/85661677.html?action=click&amp;contentCollection=Archives&amp;module=ArticleEndCTA&amp;region=ArchiveBody&amp;pgtype=article&amp;pageNumber=29|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=October 1, 1954|accessdate=April 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has, however, been suggested that Dorgan disliked the Giants and their manager, [[John McGraw]], which may have also given him a reason to coin a disparaging term for short home runs&lt;ref name="Baseball Bits"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Schlossberg|first1=Dan|title=Baseball Bits|date=2008|publisher=[[Penguin Books]]|isbn=9781440630002|page=185|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hBw9uWwLxSoC&amp;pg=PA185|accessdate=March 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; (however, Lighter said in a followup post to the ADS listserv that he had found no evidence Dorgan coined the term, or even that the cartoonist had heard it&lt;ref name="Lighter ADS post 2"&gt;{{cite mailing list|url=http://listserv.linguistlist.org/pipermail/ads-l/2010-November/104277.html|title=And in (additional) honor of the Giants' World Series win... |date=November 3, 2010|accessdate=April 18, 2018|mailing-list=ADS-L|last=Lighter|first=Jonathan}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

During the 1910s, when Dorgan's cartoon was at its most popular, there was an ongoing debate over the [[Chinese Exclusion Act]], the first immigration law in U.S. history to bar entry to the country on the basis of ethnicity or national origin.&lt;ref name="Chinese Exclusion Act"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese Exclusion Act (1882)|url=https://www.ourdocuments.gov/doc.php?flash=true&amp;doc=47|publisher=[[U.S. National Archives]]|accessdate=February 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese immigrants who had entered prior to its 1882 passage remained, however, and were often hired as "[[coolie]]s", doing menial labor for low pay. "The idea was to express a cheap home run as Chinese then represented what was cheap, such as their labor", [[lexicography|lexicographer]] [[David Shulman]] told Dickson.&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt; This was in keeping with a bevy of other contemporary such usages, such as calling a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] automobile a "Chinese [[Rolls-Royce Limited|Rolls-Royce]]". Sheehan also wrote that it carried the additional "connotation of a homer of little account."&lt;ref name="NYT Sheehan 1954 article" /&gt; He did not think that Dorgan, known for the gentleness of his [[satire]], had meant it to be insulting, especially since he had two [[international adoption|adopted sons from China]].&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

In 1958, when the [[San Francisco Giants|Giants moved to San Francisco]] and left the Polo Grounds, [[J. G. Taylor Spink]], publisher of ''[[The Sporting News]]'', made another attempt to find the source of the term. He agreed with Sheehan that it had originated with Dorgan and the association of Chinese immigrants with cheap labor. However, his article was reprinted in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', and readers there wrote in with alternative suggestions.&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

One was from Travis McGregor, a retired San Francisco sportswriter. In his recollection, the term had been in use on the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] in the years just before World War I. He attributed it to a joke derived from an aspiring Chinese-American sportswriter covering [[Minor League Baseball|minor league]] games in the [[Pacific Coast League]], whom the typists at newspapers simply credited as "Mike Murphy" since they couldn't properly [[transcription (linguistics)|transcribe]] his name. "He had a keen sense of humor, a degree from [[Stanford University|Stanford]] and a great yen to be a newspaperman", McGregor wrote in his own letter to ''The Sporting News''. As a result of his education, he spoke with no accent, but still used affected [[syntax]]. "He was a one-man show at baseball games ... for two or three seasons, an Oriental [[Fred Allen]]", according to McGregor. Once, he recalled, Murphy described one batter as "wave at ball like [[Mandarin (bureaucrat)|Mandarin]] with fan".&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

This phrase stuck in the minds of the other sportswriters in attendance and, McGregor suggested, it spread among all the league's writers, becoming a [[catch phrase]]. "The old Oakland park's short fence caught the most of it from Mike, and his 'Mandarin fan' waving balls out of the park were knocked back to 'Chinese homers'", said McGregor. A number of Murphy's comments were adapted into cartoons by Dorgan, a native of San Francisco, and from there the term migrated into print. McGregor believed that either Ed Hughes or Harry Smith of the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'' were the first to do so, and better-known writers like [[Ring Lardner]] and [[Damon Runyon]] may have picked it up from them and popularized it nationwide.&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

Sportswriters extended the idea. Shulman wrote in 1930 of hearing them talk about short [[pop fly|pop flies]] as "Chinese [[line drive]]s".&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt; [[Texas leaguer]]s, or high bloop [[single (baseball)|singles]] that fell between the [[infield#baseball|infielders]] and outfielders, were likewise called "Japanese line drives" when hit in [[Pacific Coast League]] games.&lt;ref name="Dickson 466"&gt;Dickson, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ceeU7xSLw5kC&amp;pg=PA466 466].&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been other theories to explain how home runs that barely cleared the fence came to be called "Chinese". Dan Schlossberg, a veteran [[Associated Press]] baseball writer, accepts the Dorgan story but also reports that [[W. O. McGeehan|Bill McGeehan]], then sports editor of the ''[[New York Tribune]]'', had in 1920 likened the right field fence at the Polo Grounds to the [[Great Wall of China]]: "thick, low, and not very formidable", suggesting that that may also have had something to do with the term's coinage.&lt;ref name="Baseball Bits" /&gt; [[Russ Hodges]], who called Giants games on the radio in both New York and San Francisco, told the latter city's ''[[San Francisco Call|Call-Bulletin]]'' in 1958 that the term came into use from the supposed tendency of Chinese gamblers watching games at the Polo Grounds in the early 20th century to cluster in seats next to the left field foul pole. "Any hit that went out at that point", he explained, "was followed by cries of 'There goes one for the Chinese'".&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

Another ''Sporting News'' columnist, [[Joe Falls]], devoted a column to the term and solicited theories of its origin from readers. Some suggested that it had something to do with the "short jump" in [[Chinese checkers]], or that since Chinese people were generally short, that short home runs would be named after them. Another reader claimed that the term arose because the outfield seats in the Polo Grounds supposedly stuck out in ways that suggested a [[pagoda]].&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

==History==
The term appears to have caught on quickly in baseball throughout the 1920s. By the 1950s, it was still in use but its [[connotation]]s were no longer clear, and its use after one notoriously short home run that won a [[World Series]] game sparked a protest. After the 1964 demolition of the [[Polo Grounds]], with its notoriously short right field fence, the term largely fell from use.&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

===1920s–1954: Mel Ott===
[[File:MelOttGoudeycard.jpg|thumb|right|Mel Ott, on a 1933 baseball card]]
After establishing itself in baseball's argot, "Chinese home run" continued to be used, even while most of the other derogatory terms related to the Chinese fell from use; the American public opinion began to see the Chinese people in a more sympathetic light due to China's struggles against Japanese domination during the 1930s, struggles that led to the U.S. and China becoming allies during World War II. Within baseball it was frequently associated with the Giants and the Polo Grounds, with its short right-field fence. One Giant in particular, outfielder [[Mel Ott]], was sometimes described as the master of the Chinese home run, since he hit many of his 511 career home runs (a [[National League]] record at the time of his retirement) to right field in the team's home stadium (although often to the upper deck) during his 1926–45 playing career.&lt;ref name="Baseball and the Mythic Moment"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hardy Jr.|first1=James D.|authorlink=James D. Hardy, Jr.|title=Baseball and the Mythic Moment: How We Remember the National Game|date=2007|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786426508|pages=32–34|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xCE35pZXU0QC&amp;pg=PA33|accessdate=March 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The association likely developed because not only did Ott not have the physique commonly associated with [[power hitter]]s, he used an unusual batting technique. The {{convert|5|ft|9|in|cm|adj=on}} outfielder preceded his swings by dropping his hands, lifting his front leg and stepping forward on it as the [[pitch (baseball)|pitch]] came. Since that defied accepted baseball wisdom about how to hit home runs, it was assumed that Ott was focusing on the short right field fence, and sportswriters often kidded him about this. Ott, who worked on his technique extensively, usually responded that if it was so easy, other batters in the league should have been able to hit even more of those home runs when visiting the Giants. It has also been pointed out that Ott's best-known home run, which won his team the [[1933 World Series]] from the [[History of the Washington Senators (1901–60)|Washington Senators]], was hit in [[Griffith Stadium]], not the Polo Grounds, and over a longer fence.&lt;ref name="Baseball and the Mythic Moment" /&gt;

===1954–57: Dusty Rhodes===
While [[Bobby Thomson]]'s 1951 pennant-clinching "[[Shot Heard 'Round the World (baseball)|Shot Heard 'Round The World]]" has sometimes been described as a Chinese home run,&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt; the best-known such hit by a Giant in the Polo Grounds also won an [[extra innings|extra-inning]] [[World Series]] game, and may have proved decisive in eventually winning that series for the Giants. In the 10th inning of Game 1 of the [[1954 World Series]] against the heavily favored [[Cleveland Indians]], Giants' manager [[Leo Durocher]], on a hunch, sent in [[Dusty Rhodes (outfielder)|Dusty Rhodes]] to [[pinch hit]] for [[Monte Irvin]]. The left-handed Rhodes hit a [[walk-off home run]] just over the right field fence, giving the Giants the three runs they needed to win the game.&lt;ref name="Baseball and the Mythic Moment" /&gt;

The extensive media coverage led to discussions of both the term, such as Sheehan's in the ''[[New York Times|Times]]'', and Chinese home runs themselves. Since the late 1940s, there had been complaints from older fans that they were part of the decline of the game. "Ballplayers played ball in those days", said a writer in a 1948 column in the [[Lowell, Massachusetts]], ''[[The Sun (Lowell)|Sun]]''. "Now they pop a Chinese home run into an overhanging balcony and the crowd thinks it's wonderful".&lt;ref name="Lighter ADS post 1" /&gt; Two years later, Richard Maney included the Chinese home run among the failings of the postwar game in a ''Times'' piece.&lt;ref name="NYT 1950 Maney piece"&gt;{{cite news|last=Maney|first=Richard|title=Shades of Abner Doubleday!; From a grandstand seat on Broadway, this baseball fan rises to denounce the modern game as ersatz, a fraud and a bore.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1950/09/10/archives/shades-of-abner-doubleday-from-a-grandstand-seat-on-broadway-this.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=September 10, 1950|accessdate=March 13, 2015|quote=Another victim of the Chinese home run is the [[base stealing|stolen base]].}}&lt;/ref&gt;

That 1954 game is chiefly remembered today for [[Willie Mays]]' [[The Catch (baseball)|catch]] of a [[Vic Wertz]] fly to deep center in the eighth inning, which broke up an Indians' rally that might otherwise have led to them winning the game. It had happened because of the {{convert|483|ft|adj=on}} distance of the Polo Grounds' fences in that area, its other peculiarity, which offset the advantage to hitters of its short right-field fence. The Indians attributed their upset loss to the park's unusual dimensions. "The longest out and the shortest home run of the season beat us, that's all", Indians manager [[Al López]] told the ''[[Washington Post]]''. The team was unable to recover psychologically,&lt;ref name="Indians 1954 history"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Webster|first1=Gary|title=0.721: A History of the 1954 Cleveland Indians|date=2013|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9781476605623|page=158|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Rd_-AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA158|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Giants swept them three games later.&lt;ref name="Blame game"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Billheimer|first1=John|title=Baseball and the Blame Game: Scapegoating in the Major Leagues|date=2007|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786429066|pages=94–96|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z1bkbVyrKHMC&amp;pg=PA94|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sportswriters made much humor of the "Chinese" aspect of Rhodes' home run. One newspaper's photographer posed him reading a Chinese newspaper, apparently looking for an account of his hit.&lt;ref name="Summer of Shadows"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Knight|first1=Jonathan|title=Summer of Shadows: A Murder, A Pennant Race, and the Twilight of the Best Location in the Nation|date=2013|publisher=Clerisy Press|isbn=9781578604678|page=110|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R5eLAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA110|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''New York Times'' called it "more Chinese than [[chow mein]] and just as Chinese as [[Shanghai]] and [[Beijing|Peiping]]".&lt;ref name="NYT 1954 story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Daley|first=Arthur|title=Sports of the Times: The Psychic Durocher Clicks|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1954/09/30/archives/sports-of-the-times-the-psychic-durocher-clicks.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 30, 1954|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dick Young (sportswriter)|Dick Young]] extended this [[Trope (literature)|trope]] the furthest in his ''[[New York Daily News|Daily News]]'' coverage:&lt;ref name="Bill Madden book" /&gt;
{{quote|The story of the Giants' 5–2 win over Cleveland in yesterday's World Series opener should be written vertically, from top to bottom ... in [[Chinese characters|Chinese hieroglyphics]].

This unrestrained use of [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|Chinese stereotypes]], both in content and phrasing, drew a protest. Shavey Lee, long considered the unofficial "mayor" of New York's [[Chinatown, Manhattan|Chinatown]], collected signatures on a [[petition]] (in Chinese&lt;ref name="Mears auction page"&gt;{{cite web|title=Lot #641: 1954 "Chinese Home Run" Protest Letter "The Sporting News Collection Archives" Original 8" x 10" Photo (Sporting News Collection Hologram/MEARS Photo LOA) – Lot of 2|url=http://sports.mearsonlineauctions.com/1954-%22chinese-home-run%22-protest-letter-%22the-sporting-news-collection-archives%22-original-8%22-x-10%22-pho-lot43120.aspx|publisher=[[Mears Online Auctions]]|date=April 30, 2011|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) from himself and other members of the city's [[Chinese American]] community, demanding not just Young but ''all'' sportswriters stop using the term, and presented it to the Giants' secretary Eddie Brannick.&lt;ref name="Bill Madden book" /&gt; "It isn't the fault of the Chinese if you have a 258-foot fence", he wrote. "Why should we be blamed all the time? What makes a cheesy home run a Chinese home run?"&lt;ref name="Bill Madden book" /&gt;

After Brannick posted it on the wall of the team's press room, Lee's petition earned him congratulatory letters from Chinese Americans all over the country, and became national news, earning time on the television series ''[[What's the Story]]''. Jack Orr, a ''[[Sporting News]]'' writer, went to Lee's restaurant and told him he was right to object. "Writers shouldn't be using that term", he said. "But what took you so long to get around to protesting?"&lt;ref name="Bill Madden book" /&gt; Two years later, another New York sportswriter, [[Jimmy Cannon]], noted when defining "Chinese home run" in a glossary of baseball terms he wrote for ''[[Baseball Digest]]'' that it "would probably be called something else if the Chinese had more influence".&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

The Giants [[1957 New York Giants (MLB) season#Relocation to San Francisco|moved from the Polo Grounds to San Francisco at the end of the 1957 season]]. Chinese home runs were once again a subject of discussion, with many writers recalling short shots like Thomson's and Rhodes' as a quirk of the former stadium now lost to baseball. Writing in ''The New York Times'' as [[spring training]] was underway, [[Gay Talese]] wrote that Giants' players in their new home missed the "cheap (or Chinese) home runs ... legal nonetheless".&lt;ref name="Talese NYT piece"&gt;{{cite news|last=Talese|first=Gay|authorlink=Gay Talese|title=Rigney's Players Yearn for Cabbies, Cheap Homers and Even Ebbets Field|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1958/03/03/archives/rigneys-players-yearn-for-cabbies-cheap-homers-and-even-ebbets.html|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=March 3, 1958|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1958–61: Los Angeles Coliseum===
Another park quickly took over the Polo Grounds' reputation for Chinese home runs. New York City's other National League team, the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]], had also moved to the [[West Coast of the United States|West Coast]] for [[1958 Los Angeles Dodgers season|the 1958 season]], where they played their first home games in the [[Los Angeles Memorial Coliseum]]. Built for the [[1932 Summer Olympic Games|1932 Olympics]], it had mainly been used for [[American football|football]] since then. Its field was well-suited for that sport and the track and field events it had been designed for, but putting a baseball diamond in it was awkward.&lt;ref name="Farewell to the Last Golden Era"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Morales|first1=Bill|title=Farewell to the Last Golden Era: The Yankees, the Pirates and the 1960 Baseball Season|date=2011|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786485680|pages=81–82|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZV-gXBxKhYC&amp;pg=PA81|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The left field pole was just {{convert|251|ft}} from the plate, even shorter than right had been at the Polo Grounds, and it was much more likely that balls would be hit there due to the majority of batters being right-handed. Before the [[regular season]] even began, players from other teams were complaining about it.&lt;ref name="2008 NYT story"&gt;{{cite news|last=Schwarz|first=Alan|authorlink=Alan Schwarz|title=201 Feet to Left, 440 Feet to Right: Dodgers Play the Coliseum|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/26/sports/baseball/26coliseum.html|newspaper=The New York Times|date=March 26, 2008|accessdate=March 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Giants' [[pitcher]] [[Johnny Antonelli]] called it a "farce". [[Warren Spahn]], [[Ace (baseball)|ace]] for the [[1957 World Series|defending World Series champion]] [[Milwaukee Braves]], suggested that a rule be established requiring that all fences be at least 300 feet (91 m) from the plate.&lt;ref name="2008 NYT story" /&gt; Owner [[Walter O'Malley]] ordered that a {{convert|40|ft|adj=on}} wire mesh screen be put up behind the left field fence. "We don't want to acquire a reputation for Chinese home runs", he said.&lt;ref name="Bilko Atheltic Club"&gt;{{cite book|last1=White|first1=Gaylon H.|title=The Bilko Athletic Club: The Story of the 1956 Los Angeles Angels|date=2014|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9780810892903|page=31|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mEsJAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA3|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sports media, particularly back in New York, charged that O'Malley was destroying the game for the sake of ticket sales. ''[[Sports Illustrated]]'' titled a critical [[editorial]] "Every Sixth Hit a Homer!", expressing concern that [[Babe Ruth]]'s record of 60 home runs during a season might easily fall to a less worthy hitter in the coming season due to the Dodgers' short fence.&lt;ref name="Mover and Shaker"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McCue|first1=Andy|title=Mover and Shaker: Walter O'Malley, the Dodgers, and Baseball's Westward Expansion|date=2014|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|location=Lincoln, Nebraska|isbn=9780803255050|pages=221–22|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vh0KAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA221|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Associated Press (AP) poll of baseball writers found that a majority believed that any home run records set mainly in the Coliseum should carry an [[Asterisk#Baseball|asterisk]].&lt;ref name="Farewell to the Last Golden Era" /&gt;

As had happened with Rhodes' home run four years earlier, the Chinese-themed joking around the short fence continued. The screen was called the "Chinese screen" or the "[[Great Wall of China]]",&lt;ref name="Farewell to the Last Golden Era" /&gt; and the Coliseum as a whole became known as "O'Malley's Chinese Theatre",&lt;ref name="Mover and Shaker" /&gt; "The House that Charlie Chan Built",&lt;ref name="Close Shave"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Szalontai|first1=James D.|title=Close Shave: The Life and Times of Baseball's Sal Maglie|date=2002|publisher=McFarland &amp; Company|location=Jefferson, North Carolina|isbn=9780786411894|page=356|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sxQ0aNbCw-kC&amp;pg=PA356|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even, in one [[Willard Mullin]] cartoon, "Flung Wong O'Malley's Little Joss House in Los Angeles".&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt; ''The Sporting News'', contrary to the preseason trend, editorialized that it could not yet be said that the short wall would adversely affect the game. But on the cover of that issue (which also included Spink's [[etymology|etymological]] investigation) it put a cartoon showing an outsized Chinese [[coolie]] hanging over the Coliseum's back fence.&lt;ref name="The Empire Strikes Out"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elias|first1=Robert|title=The Empire Strikes Out: How Baseball Sold U.S. Foreign Policy and Promoted the American Way Abroad|date=2010|publisher=[[The New Press]]|isbn=9781595585288|page=1961|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=o1YkeL_97hIC&amp;pg=RA1-PA1961|accessdate=March 15, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|The cover design, with its suggestions of the [[Yellow Peril]], may also have reflected another change in American perceptions of the Chinese. Nine years earlier, the [[Communist Party of China|Communists]] had won [[Chinese Civil War|China's civil war]] and established the [[China|People's Republic of China]], ostensibly allied with the Soviet Union against the U.S. in the [[Cold War]]. At that time, with China undergoing its [[Great Leap Forward]], an attempt to rapidly industrialize the country, Americans were particularly fearful of what Chinese workers might be able to accomplish.&lt;ref name="Close Shave" /&gt;}} The Chinese American community in the Los Angeles area made its objections known.&lt;ref name="Close Shave" /&gt;

At first the worst fears of the media appeared justified. In the first week of play at the Coliseum, 24 home runs were hit, most of them over the left field fence and screen. [[Chicago Cubs]] outfielder [[Lee Walls]], not especially distinguished as a hitter, was responsible for three of them—in a single game. [[Commissioner of Baseball|Baseball Commissioner]] [[Ford Frick]], who had defended the Coliseum's dimensions during the preseason, quickly proposed that a second, {{convert|60|ft|adj=on}} mesh screen be established in the stands at {{convert|333|ft}} from the plate, with any balls that fell between the two a [[ground rule double]]; however, that turned to be impossible under earthquake-safety provisions of the Los Angeles building code.&lt;ref name="2008 NYT story" /&gt;

Pitchers soon adjusted. They threw outside to right-handed hitters, requiring them to [[Pull hitter|pull]] hard for the left-field fence, and as at the Polo Grounds, a deep fence in right center ({{convert|444|ft}}) challenged lefties, and over the course of the season the home run count at the Coliseum declined to the same level as other National League parks. At the end of the season, ''The Sporting News'' noted, there had been only 21 more home runs in the Coliseum than there were in the smaller [[Ebbets Field]], where the Dodgers had played in [[Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name="2008 NYT story" /&gt; During the off-season, Frick announced a rule change stipulating that any new stadium built for major-league play must have all its fences at least {{convert|325|ft}} from home plate, as Spahn had suggested. This was widely viewed as a response to the preseason controversy.&lt;ref name="Home Run"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vincent|first1=David|title=Home Run: The Definitive History of Baseball's Ultimate Weapon|date=2011|publisher=Potomac Books|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=9781597976572|page=104|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_69wBas7CsoC&amp;pg=PA104|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The only hitter to truly benefit from the short left-field fence was [[Wally Moon]], a left-handed outfielder who began playing for the Dodgers [[1959 Los Angeles Dodgers season|the next season]]. He figured out how to lift balls high enough so that they dropped down, almost vertically, just beyond the screen. This brought him 37 of his 49 homers for that season. He was not accused of exploiting the short distance to the fence for Chinese home runs. Instead, he was celebrated for his inventiveness; similar home runs have since been called "[[Moonshot (baseball)|Moon shots]]" in his honor.&lt;ref name="2008 NYT story" /&gt;

Game 5 of [[1959 World Series|that year's World Series]], ultimately won by the Dodgers over the [[Chicago White Sox]], would be the last postseason [[Major League Baseball]] game played at the Coliseum. After two more seasons at the Coliseum, the Dodgers moved to [[Dodger Stadium]] in 1962, where they have played home games since. After the then–[[Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim|Los Angeles Angels']] first [[American League]] season in 1961, the club asked for a new home in the Los Angeles area, initially asking if they could play in the Coliseum. Frick refused.&lt;ref name="Purdy team encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Purdy|first1=Dennis|title=The Team by Team Encyclopedia of Major League Baseball|date=2006|publisher=[[Workman Publishing]]|isbn=9780761139430|page=510|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uXCw8nHLVRQC&amp;pg=PA510|accessdate=March 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, to celebrate their 50th anniversary in Los Angeles, the Dodgers played a preseason [[exhibition game]] at the Coliseum against the [[Boston Red Sox]], losing by a score of 7–1. The wire mesh screen was restored, this time at the {{convert|60|ft|adj=on}} height Frick had sought because an additional section of seats had been added there since 1959, shortening left field to {{convert|201|ft}}. A Dodgers executive noted that it mimicked the [[Green Monster]] in left field at [[Fenway Park]], the Red Sox' home field.&lt;ref name="2008 NYT story" /&gt;

===1962–63: Return of the Polo Grounds===
In 1962, baseball returned to the Polo Grounds when the National League created the [[New York Mets]] as an [[expansion team]], to replace the Giants and Dodgers. The new team used the old stadium for two seasons while [[Shea Stadium]] was built out in the [[Queens]] neighborhood of [[Flushing, Queens|Flushing]]. The Mets lost the franchise's first six games at the Giants' former home, on their way to [[1962 New York Mets season|a 40–120 record]], still the most losses in a major-league season, but in those games they and their opponents hit ten home runs apiece. Sportswriters took notice, and one AP writer picked up where Dick Young had left off eight years before: "So solly, honorable sir. Chinese home run not buried in Coliseum. Making big comeback in honorable ancient Polo Grounds".&lt;ref name="April 1962 AP story"&gt;{{cite news|agency=[[Associated Press]]|title=Chinese Home Run Making Big Comeback at Polo Grounds|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2199&amp;dat=19620421&amp;id=WT0yAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=O-UFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7241,1619877|newspaper=[[Lawrence Journal-World]]|location=Lawrence, Massachusetts|date=April 21, 1962|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the team's poor play and last-place finishes in its two seasons in the Polo Grounds left few individual home runs over the right-field fence to become the subject of popular comment and mockery as Rhodes' had, the term was still in use during the team's radio broadcasts, as Yale professor Dana Brand recalled in his 2007 memoir, ''Mets Fan'':
{{quote|If you hit a 300-foot home run in the Polo Grounds, [[Lindsey Nelson]] or [[Ralph Kiner]] or [[Bob Murphy (announcer)|Bob Murphy]] would call it a Chinese home run. Obviously, they wouldn't call it a Chinese home run now, even if you could still hit a 300-foot home run. To this day, I don't know what made a home run like this Chinese. Was it because it was short, something a small person could hit? Was there some implication that it was tricky or cheap or sneaky?

Problems in completing Shea Stadium forced the Mets to stay [[1963 New York Mets season|one season more]]. At one point during the season, manager [[Casey Stengel]] alluded to the short home runs when berating pitcher [[Tracy Stallard]]. "At the end of this season they're gonna tear this place down", he reminded Stallard as he took him out of a game in which he had given up several home runs. "The way you're pitching, that right field section is gone already". In April 1964, the Polo Grounds were demolished and replaced with [[Polo Grounds Towers|a public housing project]].&lt;ref name="American Places"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Leuchtenberg|first1=William E.|title=American Places: Encounters with History|date=2002|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780195152456|page=308|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kyq6JlqU58kC&amp;pg=PA308|accessdate=March 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1965–present: Disuse===
Use of the term largely faded out afterwards, and it was seen as offensive. In 1981 ''San Francisco Chronicle'' columnist [[Herb Caen]] criticized [[Oakland Athletics|Oakland A's]] radio announcer [[Bill King]] for saying a [[Bobby Murcer]] shot was "not a Chinese home run". Caen called the remark "racist" and wrote: "I'm sure he has heard from militant Oriental groups, all of which hit hard".&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

==Secondary definition==
Dickson found another usage, referring to a high [[foul ball]] that travels a great distance, usually behind home plate. In [[Stephen King]]'s 1980 short story "[[The Monkey]]", anthologized five years later in ''[[Skeleton Crew]]'', the protagonists' father recalls days watching [[sandlot baseball|sandlot]] games during his own childhood, when he "was too small to play, but he sat far out in foul territory sucking his blueberry [[Ice pop|Pop]]sicle and chasing what the big kids called 'Chinese home runs'". Dickson wrote to King, who told him two years later that he had first heard the term when learning to play baseball in his own childhood, during a time when he lived, briefly, in [[Stratford, Connecticut]]. After he returned to his native [[Maine]] in 1958, the same year the Giants and Dodgers moved west, he recalled hearing it again. "In both cases", he told Dickson, "a Chinese home run was a foul ball, usually over the backstop". Dickson concluded from his correspondence that that use may well be limited to [[New England]].&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt; All three definitions submitted to the online [[Urban Dictionary]] in the early 21st century are in accord with this usage.&lt;ref name="Urban Dictionary"&gt;{{cite web|title=Chinese home run|url=http://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=Chinese+homerun|publisher=[[Urban Dictionary]]|date=2006–2011|accessdate=March 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dickson, one of the etymologies submitted to Joe Falls' ''Sporting News'' column, by a [[St. Louis]] man named Tom Becket, may explain this usage. "In this version, the term harks back to the turn of the 20th century and a game played in [[Salem, Massachusetts]], between teams of [[Irish Americans|Irish]] and [[Polish American|Polish immigrants]]". The game was close, and went deep into [[extra innings]]. By the 17th inning, only one ball was left. A [[shortstop]] named [[Chaney]], playing for the Irish team, fouled the ball deep into unmowed grass and weeds behind the [[backstop (baseball)|backstop]]. After searching through it for 20 minutes, the [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] gave up and declared that the Polish team had [[Forfeit (baseball)|forfeited]] the game since it had failed to provide enough balls. "So the cheer went up, 'Chaney's home run won the game!'", Becket explained. "[[Corruption (linguistics)|Various misunderstandings as to dialects]] eventually brought it around to the now-familiar 'Chinese home run'".&lt;ref name="Dickson definition" /&gt;

The '''Concave Football Boot''' is a special boot designed to increase the 'sweet spot' (the area of the boot that makes contact with the ball) by approximately four times. It has evolved the games of [[Australian Football League]], [[Soccer]] and [[Rugby League]]. Independent testing at Deakin University has shown the boot increases power  by between 8-15% and provides increased accuracy with a smaller margin of error. Concave also designed this new boot to [http://soccerlens.com/shirts/concave-pt-metatarsal-injuries/6456/ protect] the [[metatarsal]] bones.&lt;ref name="Soccerlens - Metatarsal"&gt;[http://soccerlens.com/metatarsal/16159/ The Metatarsal], Metatarsal bone injuries in football.&lt;/ref&gt; The upper of the boot contains a flexible layer of TPU ([[Thermoplastic polyurethane]]) and a reinforced cushioning foam composite called "MetaGuard".&lt;ref name="technology"&gt;[http://soccerlens.com/shirts/concave-boots-hit-it-longer-faster-and-on-target/543/ SoccerLens], review of Concave football boot technology.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research and development was independently conducted by [[Monash University]] and Invetech Systems Pty. Ltd. in Australia. Strategic design thinking and industrial design of the concave device and each year’s boot model range was undertaken by Melbourne-based design group, [http://www.CobaltNiche.com/ CobaltNiche] who also created the brand design and related marketing material.&lt;ref name="Cobalt Niche design awards"&gt;[http://ianwongresearch.blogspot.com.au/2013/10/premiers-design-awards-cobaltniche.html], CobaltNiche design awards&lt;/ref&gt;  The Concave company is globally oriented with offices in [[Manchester]] and [[Melbourne]].

==Investors and Endorsements==
Concave has a number of high-profile investors and former professional footballers involved including former [[Liverpool F. C.]] manager [[Kenny Dalglish]] and a number of former Australian football representatives including [[Kevin Muscat]], [[Paul Trimboli]], [[Michael Petersen]], [[Oscar Crino]], [[Warren Spink]] and [[Alistair Edwards]].

[[File:ETDS Groningen-2009-05-30.JPG|thumb|300px|The 41st ETDS in Groningen]]
The '''European Tournament for Dancing Students''' or '''ETDS''' is a recurring tournament for [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] and [[Latin dance|Latin-American]] dancing for students from Europe.

== Introduction ==
The tournament is held twice a year, once during the [[Pentecost]] weekend and once in autumn. The event always starts on a Friday  evening and ends on the following Monday morning. Although each ETDS is organised by a different party, the structure remains fairly constant: on Friday evening, the [[wiktionary:blind date|blind date]] program takes place, in which dancers without a partner can try to find someone with which to compete in one or both dance disciplines. Blind dating is also a motivation for some dancers that want to meet new people. On Saturday, the [[Ballroom dance|ballroom]] tournament for the ''breitensport'' class (German, meaning amateur sports for the masses) takes place and the [[Latin dance|Latin-American]] tournament for the open class as well as, if so chosen by the organising party, for the CloseD class. On Sunday, all classes dance the respective other discipline. The event ends on Monday with a last common breakfast.

The organisation of each tournament is in the hands of a different participating university. The tournament takes place in the city of the organising university, the location changing every half year to another European city. So far, the tournament has taken place most of the times either in [[Germany]] or the [[Netherlands]]. In autumn 2015, the ETDS took place in [[Czech Republic]], breaking that series for the first time. With the participation of some students from South Africa, it also premiered hosting dancers from outside Europe.

Although the primary focus of the ETDS lies in organising a tournament of high standards, the event equally aims at creating a social happening where dancers from all of Europe can meet each other. This is encouraged by the possibility to blind date and by a themed festival ("motto party") on the event's Saturday evening and a gala ball on Sunday evening.

The sleeping accommodation is commonly a local gym.

== History ==
The ETDS was founded by the university dance teams of [[Clausthal-Zellerfeld|Clausthal]], [[Braunschweig]] and [[Kiel]], who agreed to get to know each other during a tournament. The event was organised by these three German universities for a number of times. There was not a regular structure, but the tournament was organised ad hoc. Finding a sleeping accommodation was easy, as the number of participants was still very low.

In November 1990, a tournament price was introduced that has been used ever since, “der tanzmaus” (German for “the dance mouse”), a pluche mouse. The tanzmaus was a donation of the university of Kiel; Clausthal was the first university to win the mouse. It is given to the winning university which "hosts" the price until the next ETDS.

In December 1991, a tournament during [[Sinterklaas]] took place. The tournament gained more participants and Berlin started participating as well. Berlin won the dance mouse during this Sinterklaas tournament, and promised to organise the event somewhere in the future. During this tournament, only one class existed. 

In April 1992, the tournament took place in Clausthal. This was the first tournament in which the team of [[Dortmund]] started participating. Some tournaments later, [[Ulm]] and [[Marburg]] started participating as well.

The University of Berlin fulfilled their promise in 1993 by taking care of the organisation of the tournament. The tournament still did not have separate classes.

The next tournament took place in the spring of 1994, and the tournament gained in popularity; fifteen universities from Germany participated. Also, for the first time, universities from the Netherlands started to participate. The new universities were from [[University of Mainz|Mainz]], [[Geisenheim Grape Breeding Institute|Geisenheim]], [[Kaiserslautern]], [[Delft]] and [[Eindhoven]].

During autumn of 1994, the number of participants had increased to such a high amount that problems started to arise between the organisation and the administration of Kiel. The result was that Kiel was disallowed to organise the event for five years.

The next tournament took place in the spring of 1995, and for the first time, the tournament was separated into two classes. They were called “amateurs” and “profis” ("professionals"). [[Leipzig]] also joined this tournament.

The tournament that was held in the summer of 1995 was the first event to take place in the Netherlands. The organisation was in the hands of [[ESDV Footloose]] from [[Eindhoven]]. [[Groningen (city)|Groningen]] joined during this tournament. From now on, the ETDS was no longer organised on an ad hoc basis, but was organised regularly twice each year, during Pentecost and in the autumn, each time by a different university.

The number of participants continued to grow, and around 2004 a third class, "masters", was added to the breitensport section. More than 500 participants took part in the 41st tournament in Groningen in May 2009, and another breitensport class by the name of “champions” was introduced.

The event continued to grow in popularity, and 570 participants were competing in the 47th edition during Pentecost, May 2012. In October 2015, the event was held for the first time in the Czech Republic, in the city of [[Brno]]. This was the first ETDS not organised in Germany or the Netherlands.

== Rules ==
Every ETDS organisation is allowed to make their own rules for the tournament. Each organisation describes rules about clothing and the calculation of the tanzmaus evaluation. Because the focus of each organization may be different, the balance between social orientation and competition changes slightly. Nevertheless, several rules exist during each tournament:

=== Structure ===
Dancers can sign up for two disciplines, [[Ballroom dance|standard]] and [[Latin dance|Latin-American]].

In the breitensport class, only untrained and low level training dancers are allowed. Professional dancers, i.e. those who have reached a higher class in official tournaments held by dance associations, are excluded from the breitensport tournaments. They instead dance in the open class which ranges at least from B to S class dancers.

Some hosting universities decide to provide another separate tournament for a class called CloseD, which consists of dancers of the official D and C classes (varying between national dance associations). In case a separate tournament for this class is chosen not to be held, the organising team will classify the concerning dancers into either breitensport (D class) or open class (C class).

Participants that belong to a [[Formation dance|dance formation]] may also be required to dance in the CloseD or open class, depending on the league in which their formation is classified.

In the breitensport section, a pre-qualification round takes place, where each participating couple is classified into the amateur, professional ("profi"), master or the optional champion class, so that each couple will dance the subsequent actual tournament in a class that matches their levels. These tournaments follow the rules of official dancing tournaments. During the finals, open adjudication is sometimes performed, with each adjudicator showing their ranking of the couples on the floor immediately after each dance. However, closed adjudication is often chosen in order to save time. There are winner's certificates and medals for all participants in the finals as well as trophies (instead of medals) for the [[podium]] finishers.

=== Dances===
In the respective disciplines, the following dances have to be performed (example rule set):
* ''Breitensport'': ballroom preliminary round: [[Waltz (International Standard)|slow waltz]], [[Tango (ballroom)|tango]], [[quickstep]], from the semi-final of masters and champions additionally: [[Viennese waltz]] and/or [[slowfox]]; latin preliminary round: [[Cha-cha-cha (dance)|cha-cha-cha]], [[Rhumba|rumba]], [[Jive (dance)|jive]], from the semi-final of masters and champions additionally: [[Samba (ballroom dance)|samba]], [[paso doble]]
* ''CloseD'': similar to breitensport, but with a re-dance round for those who didn't directly qualify for the next round
* ''Open class'': similar to CloseD
The ETDS has also seen separate competitions without class separation in [[Discofox]], [[Salsa (dance)|Salsa]] and [[Polka]].

=== Adjudication ===
The adjudicators are chosen from volunteers of the participating universities that do not compete themselves in the discipline in which they judge. Adjudicators are selected by their adjudicator's license, by their experience and/or by their level of dancing in regular dance competitions.

=== Blind dating ===
A blind date couple consists of two dancers from different universities. Blind dating is mandatory in the CloseD and open classes (in the latter case sometimes being replaced by composing couples by the lot or by other rules), and stimulated in the breitensport by a blind date programme on Friday and Saturday for the following day's tournament. During the breitensport tournaments, a blind date couple can score more points for a university, and thereby improve their team's chance of winning the tanzmaus prize.

=== Participants ===
Every member of a student dancing society or university student can participate. Each couple dances under the flag of his or her university or dance society. Staff members of the university or dancing society are also allowed to participate. When universities have too few participants to compete for the tanzmaus, they can team up with other universities to improve their chances.

== Nationalities ==
Every European university or student dance society can participate. In practice, a majority of the participants is German. The second largest participating party is from the Netherlands, and some dancers from the [[United Kingdom]], [[Switzerland]], [[Estonia]], [[Norway]] and other neighbouring countries participate as well.

==History==
Guangdong Olympic Stadium broke ground on 31 December 1998 at the former site of [[Guangzhou Huangcun Airport|Huangcun Airport]]. It opened to the public for the [[National Games of China|Ninth National Games of China]] in 2001. It was originally planned to help host the [[2008 Summer Olympics]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.architectureweek.com/2002/0501/design_1-1.html ArchitectureWeek - Design - China's Banner Stadium - 2002.0501&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; until a decision was made to construct the [[Beijing National Stadium|National Stadium]] in Beijing. The original design for the Guangdong Olympic Stadium was announced in 1999. Taking Guangzhou's nickname, the ''Flower City'', the American [[architecture|architectural]] firm of [[Ellerbe Becket]] designed Guangdong Olympic Stadium's sunscreen roof to resemble layers of petals on a [[flower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Guangdong_Olympic_Stadium |title=Guangdong Olympic Stadium |publisher=Archiplanet |date= |accessdate=2011-05-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226181452/http://www.archiplanet.org/wiki/Guangdong_Olympic_Stadium |archivedate=26 February 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The design firm stated in its press release: "The stadium bowl grows out of the ground to a sculpted upper edge, like the [[petal]]s of a flower. Floating above the bowl is a shimmering [[ribbon]] of [[roof]] flowing like a [[wave]] over the [[chair|seat]]s. It parts at the ends and holds the [[Olympic flame]], suspended between the two ribbons. A [[hotel]] surrounds a circular opening in the roof that forms a vertical [[tower]] of light, which at night is visible for a great distance." The stadium's multi-colored seats are positioned in multiple sections that are visually connected via a ribbon pattern.

{{about|the annual track and field award|Big Ten Conference Athlete of the Year|Big Ten Athlete of the Year}}
The '''Jesse Owens Award''' is an annual [[track and field]] award that is the highest accolade given out by [[USA Track and Field]] (USATF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usatf.org/statistics/awards/TF/JesseOwensAward.asp |accessdate=November 3, 2010 |title=Jesse Owens Award |publisher=[[USA Track and Field]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304192040/http://www.usatf.org/statistics/awards/TF/JesseOwensAward.asp |archivedate=March  4, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As the country's highest award for the sport, it bears [[Jesse Owens]]' name in recognition of his significant career, which included four gold medals at the [[1936 Summer Olympics|1936 Olympic Games]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.usatf.org/news/view.aspx?duid=USATF_2009_11_19_13_34_17 | title = Gay, Richards win 2009 Jesse Owens Awards| publisher = [[USA Track and Field]] | date = November 19, 2009| accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; First awarded in 1981 to [[hurdles|hurdler]] [[Edwin Moses]], it was created to recognize the season's top [[United States|American]] performer in track and field competitions. In 1996, the award was divided into two categories, with both a male and female winner. The 1996 winners, [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]] and [[Gail Devers]], each won two gold medals at that year's [[1996 Summer Olympics|Olympics in Atlanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.iaaf.org/news/kind=100/newsid=54927.html |title = Gay, Richards selected USA Athletes of the Year| publisher=[[International Association of Athletics Federations]] | date = November 20, 2009| accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Up to 2008, the award was voted on by members of the United States athletics media only, but in 2009 fans were able to vote via the USA Track and Field website, with their opinions contributing 10% of the overall result.&lt;ref name=smh/&gt;

The winners of the award are typically announced in late November or early December after the end of the outdoor track and field season. A number of athletes have received the award on more than one occasion: [[Jackie Joyner-Kersee]] was the first to do so with back-to-back wins in 1986 and 1987, while [[Carl Lewis]] won his second award in 1991. [[Michael Johnson (athlete)|Michael Johnson]] was the first to receive the award three times (winning consecutively from 1994–1996) and [[Marion Jones]] became the first woman to collect three awards after wins in 1997, 1998 and 2002. In 2012, [[Allyson Felix]] won the award for the fourth time, thus distinguishing herself as the athlete with the most wins. 2014 winners are [[Mebrahtom Keflezighi]] and [[Jennifer Simpson]]. Winners receive a replica of the award while the original remains on permanent display at the USATF Headquarters in [[Indianapolis, Indiana]].&lt;ref name=2010award/&gt;

As of 2013, the female version of the award was renamed the '''Jackie Joyner-Kersee Athlete of the Year Award'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.usatf.org/statistics/Annual-Awards/TF/JesseOwensAward.aspx | title = Jesse Owens Award| publisher = USA Track &amp; Field | accessdate = October 18, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Invicta FC 24: Dudieva vs. Borella''' was a mixed martial arts event originally scheduled to be headlined by [[Megan Anderson (fighter)|Megan Anderson]]; defending her featherweight championship against Helena Kolesnyk. However, Megan was signed by the UFC. As a result, Invicta bantamweight champion [[Tonya Evinger]] would move up to featherweight to replace Anderson in the fight against Kolesnyk. However, Anderson would end up pulling out of her UFC fight which then led to Evinger stepping in for that fight, removing her from this event. Due to the change, Helena Kolesnyk received a new opponent in Pam Sorenson while the previous co-main event of [[Milana Dudieva]] vs. [[Mara Romero Borella (fighter)|Mara Romero Borella]] was moved up to become the new main event. A bout between [[Yana Kunitskaya]] and [[Raquel Pa'aluhi]] was removed with plans to reschedule due to Kunitskaya suffering an injury. The fight between Mallory Martin and Tiffany Masters was cancelled the day before the event due to medical issues.

'''Invicta FC 10: Waterson vs. Tiburcio''' is a mixed martial arts event that took place on December 5, 2014. It was announced that [[Cris Cyborg]] would return and drop down in weight to bantamweight. However at Invicta FC 9, it was announced that Justino suffered an injury that forced her off the card. As a result, the new main event was announced to be atomweight champion [[Michelle Waterson]] defending her championship against [[Herica Tiburcio|Hérica Tibúrcio]]. The fight between [[Roxanne Modafferi]] and [[Vanessa Porto]] was expected to determine who gets the next title shot against Barb Honchak. On November 20, Porto was removed from the card due to visa issues and was replaced by [[Andrea Lee (fighter)|Andrea Lee]]. A bantamweight bout between Irene Aldana and Marion Reneau was scheduled to take place but four days before the event, Aldana was hospitalized with bronchitis and it was announced that the fight would be postponed. On December 3, the fight between [[Charmaine Tweet]] and [[Faith Van Duin]] was pulled from the event due to medical concerns.

Livia von Plettenberg was scheduled to fight Laura Sanko but Sanko withdrew from the fight on April 26 due to pregnancy. She was replaced by Cassie Robb. On June 4, Carla Esparza withdrew from her Strawweight title defense due to a knee injury and was replaced by Cláudia Gadelha, who was originally scheduled to fight Joanne Calderwood. Calderwood was then matched up against Sarah Schneider. On June 23, Schneider also withdrew due to injury and was replaced by Norma Rueda Center. On June 26, Julia Budd withdrew from her fight against Ediane Gomes due to injury and was replaced by Charmaine Tweet. However, on July 10, Tweet announced that she was unable to make the fight due to visa issues and she was replaced by Tamikka Brents just three days before the event in what was to be a catchweight fight at 150&amp;nbsp;lbs. Brents weighed in 5 pounds over so the fight was made a lightweight fight. On July 12, the day before the event at the weigh-ins, it was announced that Veronica Rothenhausler was deemed medically unable to compete after passing out due to her weight cut thus canceling her planned fight with Mollie Estes although Estes did still receive her fight purse. The planned fight between Cassie Robb and Livia von Plettenberg was also canceled due to von Plettenberg failing to make the weight limit. Due to this, a new fight was made between Livia von Plettenberg and Kathina Catron. During the event, it was announced that Tamikka Brents suffered an injury, canceling her fight with Ediane Gomes.

After the event, fight of the night was awarded to Leslie Smith &amp; Jennifer Maia. Jessica Penne received the submission of the night bonus while knockout of the night went to [[Miriam Nakamoto]].

'''Invicta FC 5: Penne vs. Waterson''' was a mixed martial arts event held on April 5, 2013. Shannon Knapp announced during Invicta FC 4 that the event will be headlined by a co-main event of [[Jessica Penne]] defending her Invicta FC Atomweight Championship against "The Karate Hottie" [[Michelle Waterson]] along with a flyweight championship bout between [[Vanessa Porto]] and [[Barb Honchak]] and that [[Sarah Kaufman (fighter)|Sarah Kaufman]] would make her Invicta debut on the show. The show was originally targeted for April 13, however Knapp announced they would change it to April 5 after the UFC announced a show on that date.

On February 5, 2013 it was announced that Invicta FC had signed [[Zoila Frausto Gurgel]] and she would make her debut at Invicta FC against Jennifer Maia.

On February 15, 2013, Shannon Knapp announced that Invicta FC had signed [[Cris Cyborg]] to debut at Invicta 5 against Ediane Gomes. The signing was notable because it was the first professional bout for Santos since her suspension in December 2011 while competing in the now-defunct [[Strikeforce (mixed martial arts)|Strikeforce]] organization. The winner of the fight will face [[Marloes Coenen]] at Invicta FC 6 to crown the first Invicta FC Featherweight Champion. Gomes was originally scheduled to fight Julia Budd but was moved when Santos was signed. Budd will now face Fiona Muxlow. On March 19, 2013, Ediane Gomes suffered an injury and was forced to withdraw from the fight with Santos. As a result, Fiona Muxlow was moved to fight Santos and Budd would be matched against another new opponent in Mollie Estes. Mollie's original opponent was to be Veronica Rothenhausler but Veronica suffered an injury and was dropped from the card allowing Estes to be moved into the fight with Budd.

A fight between River Jones and Lauren Barefoot was originally scheduled to take place on the preliminary card but was canceled when Jones suffered an injury. Cassie Rodish was originally scheduled to fight Nicdali Rivera-Calanoc but Nicdali was forced to withdraw due to injury on March 11 and she was replaced by Simona Soukupova. Kaitlin Young was set to fight [[Amanda Nunes]], but Nunes suffered an arm injury in training and was replaced by Lauren Taylor.

After the event, fight of the night went to [[Sarah Kaufman (fighter)|Sarah Kaufman]] and [[Leslie Smith (fighter)|Leslie Smith]]. Submission of the night went to Rose Namajunas and knockout of the night went to [[Miriam Nakamoto]]. Additionally, [[Bec Hyatt]] and [[Jessica Penne]] both received social media bonuses for promoting the event.

The event was the first successful Internet [[Pay-per-view|Pay-Per-View]] for Invicta, broadcast for $9.95 by [[Ustream]].&lt;ref name="ustream_fc_5"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mmajunkie.com/2013/04/08/when-invicta-claims-success-skepticism-soon-follows/ | title=When Invicta claims success, skepticism soon follows | website=MMA Junkie | date=April 8, 2013 | accessdate=November 29, 2013 | first=Ben | last=Fowlkes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Invicta FC 4: Esparza vs. Hyatt''' was a mixed martial arts event held on {{Start date|2013|1|05}} at the Memorial Hall in Kansas City, Kansas. The event was headlined by a strawweight championship bout between [[Carla Esparza]] and [[Bec Hyatt]]. Esparza was originally scheduled to fight [[Ayaka Hamasaki]] for the title but Hamasaki pulled out of the fight due to commitments to defending her JEWELS lightweight title in December and was replaced by undefeated Brazilian fighter [[Cláudia Gadelha]]. On December 28, Gadelha was forced to withdraw from the main event title fight after suffering a broken nose in training. Gadelha was replaced by [[Bec Hyatt]], who was originally set to face [[Joanne Calderwood]]. As a result, Calderwood's opponent was changed to Livia von Plettenberg. On December 19, Shannon Knapp announced Invicta FC 4 would air as an online pay-per-view however due to purchasing issues on the night of the event, the idea was thrown out and it was announced that all buyers would be refunded. The price for the [[Ustream]] run iPPV for IFC4 was $7.95.&lt;ref name="IFC4_price"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.middleeasy.com/fighting/item/9978-before-you-drop-7-95-on-tonight-s-invicta-fc-4-watch-this-eloquent-breakdown-of-the-event|title=Before you drop $7.95 on tonight's Invicta FC 4, watch this eloquent breakdown of the event|date=January 5, 2013|accessdate=December 6, 2013|website=middleeasy.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ottawa Cliffsides''' were a senior [[ice hockey]] team that played in the [[Inter-Provincial Amateur Hockey Union]] from 1908–1911.

They were the first winner of the [[Allan Cup]] in [[1909 Allan Cup|1909]] when the cup was given to the winner of the Inter-provincial Hockey League. [[Alf Smith (ice hockey)|Alf Smith]] coached the Ottawa Cliffsides to win the first [[Allan Cup]] in March 1909, only to lose it to [[Queen's University]] in a challenge.

The Cliffsides played for only three seasons in the Inter-provincial League. They then reappeared in the [[Ottawa City Senior League]] in 1919-20 before disappearing for good.

'''Retriever Activities Center''' is a 4,024-seat multi-purpose [[arena]] in [[Catonsville, Maryland]]. The arena opened in 1973. It was home to the [[UMBC Retrievers]] basketball and volleyball teams, which represent the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore County]] in [[NCAA Division I]] athletics, from its opening until the larger [[UMBC Event Center]] opened on campus in February 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/college/basketball/mens/bs-sp-umbc-vermont-event-center-20180124-story.html|title=New UMBC Event Center to open for Feb. 3 men's basketball game vs. Vermont|first=Jonas|last=Shaffer|newspaper=[[Baltimore Sun]] |date=January 24, 2018 |accessdate=February 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It hosted the 2008 [[America East Conference]] men's basketball tournament final.

[[File:Retriever Activities Center Exterior.jpg|left|thumb|The entrance to the RAC in December 2017.]]

The RAC includes:&lt;ref&gt;http://recreation.umbc.edu/inside-recreation/recreation-hours-the-rac/&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[UMBC Aquatic Complex]]''', a state-of-the-art swimming pool complex (indoor and outdoor), as well as locker rooms and showers.
*'''RAC Arena''', formerly the university's main arena; previously used for basketball and volleyball games and commencement ceremonies, and still used for other events.
*'''RAC Gymnasium''', the student gym complex includes a weight room, cardio balcony, and fitness studio.
*'''Arena Track''', an indoor track encircling the main arena used for running and jogging.
*'''Outdoor Tennis Courts''',  located behind the RAC, the Outdoor Tennis Courts offer an additional amenity to the center.

'''Rhone Apparel''' (referred to simply as '''Rhone''') is an [[United States|American]] [[startup company]] producing and selling men's [[sportswear (activewear)]]. Its product line is intended for high-income, active men between 25 and 50 years of age, who look for activewear that is functional and attractive. The company uses premium custom fabrics, which include silver thread that provides permanent antibacterial and anti-odorant protection.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt;&lt;ref name=News /&gt;

All of Rhone's products are designed in [[Connecticut]], with a warehouse in [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=FAQ /&gt; Rhone has been called "2016's hottest men's activewear brand."&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt;

== History ==

Rhone was founded in [[New Canaan, Connecticut]], in 2014 by Nate Checketts, an ex-[[National Football League|NFL]] employee, Kyle McClure, a former [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] [[lacrosse]] player, and two other founders.&lt;ref name=Post&gt;{{cite web |url = https://nypost.com/2014/09/17/athletic-gear-fit-for-superman/ |title = Athletic gear fit for Superman |author = Stephanie Smith |publisher = New York Post |date = 17 September 2014 |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's name comes from the [[Rhône|river and region]] in Europe.&lt;ref name=Ruden&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.therudenreport.com/top-of-the-line-two-new-canaan-football-graduates-looking-to-make-it-big-in-mens-activewear/ |title = Top Of The Line: Two New Canaan Football Graduates Looking To Make It Big In Men's Activewear |author = Dave Ruden |publisher = The Ruden Report |date = 28 July 2014 |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The founders were inspired by the fact that the [[Rhône]] is not only aesthetically beautiful, but was also highly functional for the surrounding civilizations.&lt;ref name=Story&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rhone.com/pages/our-story |title = Our Story |publisher = Rhone Apparel |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company launched as a [[Online shopping|web-only retailer]], but partnered with [[Bloomingdale's]] in November 2014 to sell in five locations. In 2015, it entered 127 retail storefronts, selling at such retailers as [[Nordstrom]], [[Equinox Fitness|Equinox]] and [[CorePower Yoga]].&lt;ref name=Retailer /&gt; Rhone launched its first pop-up store in [[New York City]].&lt;ref name=Shopify&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.shopify.com/enterprise/93488390-how-rhone-apparel-uses-pop-up-stores-to-create-3d-customer-experiences-grow-500 |title =  How Rhone Apparel Uses Pop-up Stores to Create 3D Customer Experiences &amp; Grow 500% |author = Nick Winkler |publisher = Shopify |date = 19 February 2016 |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhone experienced sharp growth in 2015. In the month of November, it earned 62% of its 2014 revenue. Its website traffic rose by 350% from 2014 to 2015.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt; Wholesale became the primary driver of the company's 500% growth over the year before that.&lt;ref name=Retailer /&gt;

The company announced the closing of a $5 million [[Series A round|Series A financing]] in September 2015. The investors came from sports, media and fashion circles, including [[Steve Bornstein]], [[David Stern]], [[Ryen Russillo]], and [[Shane Battier]].&lt;ref name=Forbes&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonbelzer/2015/11/11/move-over-lululemon-rhone-is-about-to-take-over-the-mens-activewear-market/#53f27eb1af86 |title = Move Over Lululemon, Rhone Is About To Take Over The Men's Activewear Market |author = Jason Belzer |publisher = Forbes |date = 11 November 2015 |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since its launch, Rhone has raised a total of $6.2 million.&lt;ref name=Retailer&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.internetretailer.com/2016/01/13/activewear-retailer-rhone-apparel-grows-500-2015 |title = Activewear retailer Rhone Apparel grows 500% in 2015 |author = Fareeha Ali |publisher = Internet Retailer |date = 13 January 2016 |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2016, Rhone organized the purchase of a building from 1892 in [[Stamford, Connecticut|Stamford]] to convert it to a new headquarters.&lt;ref name=Stamford&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.stamfordadvocate.com/business/article/Just-for-men-Rhone-picks-Stamford-for-new-6801894.php#photo-9341424 |title = Just for men: Rhone picks Stamford for new headquarters |author = Alexander Soule |publisher = Stamford Advocate |date = 3 February 2016 |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, about 65% of its business was online.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg&gt;{{cite web |url = https://www.bloomberg.com/news/videos/2015-12-23/rhone-apparel-gets-into-the-activewear-game |title = Rhone Apparel Gets Into the Activewear Game |publisher = Bloomberg Business |date = 23 December 2015 |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Profile and products ==

Rhone is targeting sophisticated, high-income, active men that look for activewear that is both functional and attractive.&lt;ref name=Shopify /&gt; Its targeted demographic is between 25 and 50 years of age.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt; Its buyers are diverse, including a unit that [[War in Afghanistan (2015-present)|defuses bombs in Afghanistan]] as well as [[marathon]] winners.&lt;ref name=Ruden /&gt; The fitness clothes can also be used for day-to-day activities.&lt;ref name=Complex&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.complex.com/style/2014/11/rhone-presents-activewear-line-that-combats-odor |title = Rhone's Activewear Will Fight Sweat Stains and Odor Permanently |author = Joshua Espinoza |publisher = Complex |date = 19 November 2014 |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The company's product line aims to separate the brand from competitors like [[Lululemon Athletica|Lululemon]], [[Nike, Inc.|Nike]] and [[Under Armour]], whose premium men's offerings are more generic and less available.&lt;ref name=Forbes /&gt; The company uses superior materials in order to create clothes that last longer than the average product. While the average mass brands spend between $2 and $4 a yard for fabrics, some of Rhone's fabrics cost $15 per yard.&lt;ref name=Ruden /&gt;&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt; 

When the company founders began researching [[antimicrobial]] fabrics, they found that weaving silver into cloth created permanent antibacterial and anti-odorant protection, unlike typical anti-odorant treatments which last for 15 to 20 washes.&lt;ref name=News&gt;{{cite web |url = http://connecticut.news12.com/news/growing-new-canaan-startup-rhone-apparel-to-move-headquarters-to-stamford-1.11514454?pts=174621 |title = Growing New Canaan startup to move to Stamford |publisher = News 12 Connecticut |date = 26 February 2016 |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; SilverTech is the brand name of the silver thread that is woven into the company's fabrics.&lt;ref name=FAQ&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.rhone.com/pages/support |title = Frequently Asked Questions |publisher = Rhone Apparel |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, silver has been [[medical uses of silver|used as an antiseptic]] since [[Hippocrates]]. The kind of silver threading Rhone uses was initially developed by the [[United States Army|American military]] for [[Iraq War|soldiers in Iraq]].&lt;ref name=Hook&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.insidehook.com/nation/rhone-apparel/ |title = Right on Track |publisher = Inside Hook |accessdate = 28 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it launched, Rhone got numerous orders from army bases, as captains were ordering the gear for troops to wear during training.&lt;ref name=Post /&gt;

Other apparel includes the Rhone Flask, which keeps drinks cold for 24 hours and hot for 12 hours.&lt;ref name=Bloomberg /&gt;

Rhone's style names come from masculine icons, like the Durden T-shirt after [[Fight Club (novel)#Tyler Durden|"Fight Club" character Tyler Durden]],&lt;ref name=WSJ /&gt; or the Mako short after the shark from ''[[The Old Man and the Sea]]''.&lt;ref name=Ruden /&gt;

[[File:Bandystick.gif|thumb|right|A (rink) bandy stick and ball]]
[[File:Bandy ball (Orange).JPG|thumb|The ball]]
[[File:УФХМР 2013.jpg|thumb|Rink bandy in [[Dnipro]]]]
'''Rink bandy''' and '''rinkball''' are variants of [[bandy]] played on significantly smaller [[ice rink]]s. While a [[bandy field|bandy rink]] is about the same size as a [[football pitch]], rink bandy is played on [[ice hockey rink]]s.

Rink bandy originated in [[Sweden]] in the 1960s and was originally called '''hockeybockey'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skelleftea.org/forening/spif/rbandy/r_start.htm Skelleftepolisens IF - ''Rinkbandy''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040121040252/http://www.skelleftea.org/forening/spif/rbandy/r_start.htm |date=2004-01-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the arrival of indoor ice hockey arenas, it was a way for [[bandy]] players to practice on ice a longer time of the year; as [[bandy field]]s are larger, they were still only made outdoors in the wintertime when artificial freezing was not necessary.

The game uses a [[bandy ball]] and bandy sticks. The goalkeeper has no stick. As in hockey, a game lasts 60 minutes, but is composed of either two 30 minute halves or three 20 minute periods. Similar rules to normal bandy are used, but they are simplified to increase the pace of the game. [[Checking (ice hockey)|Checking]] is prohibited, making the sport relatively safer than its relatives. Because of the smaller playing area, there are fewer players, normally six a side. In the [[Bandy in the United States#League_play|USA Rink Bandy League]], five players are used because of the smaller ice hockey rinks there.

== Organisation ==
[[File:Balashikha Arena.jpg|right|220px|thumb|[[Balashikha Arena]], where the 2017 Russian Rink Bandy Cup took place.&lt;ref&gt;https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rusbandy.ru%2Fnews%2F11118%2F&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Rink bandy is governed by the [[Federation of International Bandy]]. In its quest to have bandy accepted into the programme of the [[Winter Olympics]], rink bandy is an important way for the Federation of International Bandy to gain more members, thus also spreading bandy, since many countries, which lack a full-size field and where the game is still new, only play rink bandy at home but still participate in the [[Bandy World Championship]]. 

As artificially frozen and indoor bandy arenas have become more prevalent, the interest for rink bandy has dwindled in the main bandy-playing nations (Russia, Sweden, Finland, Norway). There are still several rink bandy tournaments in [[Russia]],&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9qhuUv9bBQg Video of the 2nd half between [[Lokomotiv Orenburg]] and [[CSK VVS Samara (ice hockey)|CSK VVS Samara]] in the 2011 Russian Rink Bandy Cup]&lt;/ref&gt; including the Patriarch Cup ({{lang|ru|Турнир на призы Святейшего Патриарха Московского и всея Руси}}&lt;ref&gt;http://uniorsport.ru/bandy_kp_2017.php&lt;/ref&gt;) for children at [[Moscow]]'s [[Red Square]].&lt;ref&gt;https://translate.google.co.uk/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=ru&amp;u=https://pravoslavie.ru/68869.html&lt;/ref&gt;

A world cup for rink bandy clubs was held every year from 1984-1998 in [[Hofors]], Sweden, and called [[Hofors World Cup]]. Rink bandy was included in the programme of the 2012 European Company Sports Games&lt;ref&gt;http://www.visitsodradalarna.se/en/ECSG-2012/Sports/Rinkbandy/&lt;/ref&gt; and a European championship existed, though there is currently no top-level international competition. However, in 2017 the Federation of International Bandy decided to hold an international tournament for developing bandy countries in [[Nymburk]], [[Czech Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.worldbandy.com/newspost_8333.html European Rinkbandy Cup in Nymburk, Czech Republic]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7FhQ8r0ES5o Video from the whole 2017 European Rink Bandy Cup final]&lt;/ref&gt; and an international rink bandy club competition called Dniprobandy has been organised by the [[Ukrainian Bandy and Rink bandy Federation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://worldbandy.com/news.asp?newsid=524&amp;title=Information%20about%20the%20second%20international%20rink%20bandy%20tournament|title= Information about the second international rink bandy tournament|publisher= Federation of International Bandy|date= 2013-07-04|accessdate= 9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the [[List of German rink bandy champions|national bandy championship]] is played under rink bandy rules.

==Rinkball==
In the 1970s rinkball, which is played by more ice hockey-like sticks, grew from being played in local tournaments by villagers around Finland to national-level competitions involving 100 teams or more. The sport first gained international attention in 1984 when teams from [[Finland]] and Sweden hosted one another. The International Rinkball Association was formed soon after, and in the late 1990s included [[Russia]], Sweden, [[Kazakhstan]], [[Estonia]], [[Switzerland]], [[Hungary]], Finland and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="Rinkball history"/&gt; The Finnish Rinkball Federation has 1000 teams, including women, men and children. Play is divided into eight male divisions, two female divisions, and children's play is divided by age.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kaukalopalloliitto.fi/ Finnish Rinkball and Ringette Federation]&lt;/ref&gt; The first World Championship Games for men was held in [[Omsk]], Russia, in 1998.&lt;ref name="Rinkball history"&gt;[http://rinkball.ru/history/hist3.htm Rinkball history]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Rinkball League in Finland publishes a magazine called ''Liiga Extra'', which offers international coverage of tournaments, equipment, and tips. In Finland, leagues and a national championship is held annually (as of 2016).

'''Springs Brooks Stadium/Vrooman Field''' is a [[baseball]] [[Baseball park|park]] in the [[Southeastern United States|southeastern]] [[United States]], located on the campus of [[Coastal Carolina University]] in [[Conway, South Carolina]]. It is the home field of the [[Coastal Carolina Chanticleers baseball|Coastal Carolina Chanticleers]] of the [[Sun Belt Conference]]. The {{convert|33,000|sqft|adj=on}} baseball project includes 2,500 permanent seats, with the potential to accommodate between 5,000-6,000&lt;!-- fans--&gt; for major events like the [[NCAA Division I Baseball Championship|NCAA postseason tournament]].

==History==
Formerly known as '''Charles Watson Stadium - Vrooman Field''', the facility underwent renovations in 2004, which included a new scoreboard, a new fence, a new infield, and a new sound system.  The field also had new lights installed in 2005.  In 2008, new seats and new turf outside of the bases and home plate were installed.  The clubhouse was also renovated with new lockers, a new lounge and a new training facility.  Stadium capacity was expanded to nearly 2,200 during the 2008 season, with the addition of a right field deck dubbed "The Rooster's Nest." The stadium hosted an [[2008 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament#Cary Super Regional|NCAA Regional]] for the first time in [[2008 NCAA Division I Baseball Tournament#Cary Super Regional|2008]]. Following the 2012 season, the venue underwent major renovations and Coastal Carolina played their home games in 2013 and 2014 in nearby [[Myrtle Beach, South Carolina|Myrtle Beach]] at [[TicketReturn.com Field]]&lt;!-- while Watson Stadium was under construction--&gt;. 

The ballpark officially reopened in 2015 under its new name, '''Springs Brooks Stadium - Vrooman Field''', on February 13. Its first game was between [[Maryland Terrapins baseball|Maryland]] and [[Western_Kentucky_Hilltoppers_and_Lady_Toppers#Baseball|Western Kentucky]] as part of the Caravelle Resort Tournament that CCU hosted. Later that day, Coastal Carolina defeated [[Old Dominion Monarchs baseball|Old Dominion]] 4–0 in front of a crowd of 1,736, their first home game since renovations were completed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goccusports.com/sports/m-basebl/recaps/021315aaa.html&lt;/ref&gt; The attendance record of 3,086 was set on March 24, 2015, when CCU defeated [[2015 South Carolina Gamecocks baseball team|South Carolina]] 9–8 in {{nowrap|eleven  innings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.goccusports.com/sports/m-basebl/recaps/032415aaa.html&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The diamond has an unorthodox southeasterly&lt;!--(southeast by east)--&gt; alignment (home plate to center field); the recommended orientation is {{nowrap|east-northeast.&lt;ref name=ofbblrles&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mlb.mlb.com/documents/0/8/0/268272080/2018_Official_Baseball_Rules.pdf |publisher=Major League Baseball |title=Official Baseball Rules: 2.01 Layout of the Field |date=2018 |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[elevation]] of the field is approximately {{convert|40|ft|0|spell=in}} above [[sea level]].

The '''Stade Amédée-Domenech''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Brive-la-Gaillarde]], [[France]].  It is currently used mostly for [[rugby union]] matches and is the home stadium of [[CA Brive]]. The stadium is able to hold 13,979.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.laprovence.com/rc-toulon-resultats?rugby/equipe/10/brive&lt;/ref&gt;
Its official name was the Stadium until 2004, but it was called Stade Amedee-Domenech after the French international rugby player [[Amédée Domenech]] died in 2003.

The Stade Amédée-Domenech is the theatre of the matches of the Brive rugby team since 1921. There were some interruptions. From 1938 to 1941, the Brive rugby XIII team has played to the Stadium, and at the beginning of the Second World War, the field was invaded by army's machines. And till 1957 to 1960, there were refection works in the Stadium, which was damaged. There were important rugby matches in the Stadium. In October 1991, a Rugby World Cup match between Romania and Fiji, and two years later, the France national team played there against Romania.
There were also football matches in the Stade Amedee-Domenech. The local football team, [[ESA Brive]], has played important matches of the French Cup, especially in 2004, against the [[Association de la Jeunesse Auxerroise|AJ Auxerre]] and [[Paris Saint-Germain Football Club|Paris Saint-Germain]].

It is the most important stadium of the [[Limousin (région)|Limousin]].

Natural grass practice fields and throwing venues for baseball and softball are directly adjacent to the main stadium. The baseball stadium seats 1,000, including 800 chairs, and has handicap accessible areas on the main concourse. The baseball field measures 325 feet to the outfield fence. Oversized dugouts allow for maximum player comfort. The stadium features a large electronic scoreboard and message board, and a public address system provides coverage to the stands and concourse.
