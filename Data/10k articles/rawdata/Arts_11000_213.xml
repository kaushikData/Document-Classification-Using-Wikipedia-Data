[[File:Roman pottery African Red Slip.jpg|thumb|A typical plain African Red Slip dish with simple rouletted decoration. 4th century]]

'''African red slip ware''', also '''African Red Slip''' or ARS, is a category of ''[[terra sigillata]]'', or "fine" [[Ancient Roman pottery]] produced from the mid-1st century AD into the 7th century in the province of [[Africa Proconsularis]], specifically that part roughly coinciding with the modern country of [[Tunisia]] and the [[Diocletian]]ic provinces of  [[Byzacena]] and [[Zeugitana]]. It is distinguished by a thick-orange red [[slip (ceramics)|slip]] over a slightly granular fabric. Interior surfaces are completely covered, while the exterior can be only partially slipped, particularly on later examples.

By the 3rd century AD, African red slip appears on sites throughout the [[Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]] and in the major cities of [[Roman Empire|Roman]] [[Europe]]. It was the most widely distributed representative of the sigillata tradition in the late-Roman period, and occasional imports have been found as far afield as Britain in the 5th-6th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Tyers 1996, pp.80-82&lt;/ref&gt;  African red slip ware was still widely distributed in the 5th century but after that time the volume of production and trade may well have declined. While the latest forms continued into the 7th century and are found in such major cities as [[Constantinople]] and [[Marseille]], the breakup of commercial contacts that typified the later 7th century coincides with the final decline of the African red slip industry.

The production and success of African red slip is probably closely tied to the agricultural productivity of Rome's North African provinces, as indicated in part by the contemporaneous distribution of Roman-period North African [[amphoras]].

==Vessel forms==
[[File:African cup in terra sigillata with moulded interior decoration showing Mithras slaying the bull, from Lavinium, second half of 4th century - first half of 5th century AD, Museo Nationale, Rome (9442849659).jpg|thumb|Moulded [[Mithras]] slaying the bull, from [[Lavinium]] near Rome, 400 ± 50]]
From about the 4th century, competent copies of the fabric and forms were also made in several other regions, including [[Asia Minor]], the eastern Mediterranean and Egypt.   Over the long period of production, there was obviously much change and evolution in both forms and fabrics.  Both Italian and Gaulish plain forms influenced ARS in the 1st and 2nd centuries AD (for example, Hayes Form 2, the cup or dish with an outcurved rim decorated with barbotine leaves, is a direct copy of the samian forms Dr.35 and 36, made in South and Central Gaul),&lt;ref&gt;Hayes 1972, p. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; but over time a distinctive ARS repertoire developed.

There was a wide range of dishes and bowls, many with rouletted or stamped decoration, and closed forms such as tall ovoid flagons with appliqué ornament (Hayes Form 171).  The ambitious large rectangular dishes with relief decoration in the centre and on the wide rims (Hayes Form 56), were clearly inspired by decorated silver platters of the 4th century, which were made in rectangular and polygonal shapes as well as in the traditional circular form.

==Surface decoration==
[[File:Dionisos plate Barcelona.jpg|thumb|Stamped [[Dionisos]], 550-600]]
[[File:Ceramic cylindrical jug with Orpheus, from Tunisia, 3rd century AD, Neues Museum, Berlin (13717014633).jpg|thumb|Jug with scenes of [[Orpheus]], 3rd century]]
A wide range of bowls, dishes and flagons were made in ARS, but the technique of making entire relief-decorated vessels in moulds was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;For the detailed typology and distribution maps, see Hayes 1972 and Hayes 1980&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, appliqué motifs were frequently used where decoration in relief was required, separately made and applied to the vessel before drying and firing.  Stamped motifs were also a favoured form of decoration, and decorative motifs reflected not only the Graeco-Roman traditions of the Mediterranean, but eventually the rise of Christianity as well: there is a great variety of monogram crosses and plain crosses amongst the stamps in the later centuries.  Similar forms and fabrics were made for more local distribution in Egypt, which had its own very active and diverse ceramic traditions in the Roman period.

Surface decoration of ARS is relatively simple during the first three centuries of production, with occasional [[rouletting]], [[barbotine]] motifs and some appliqué being typical. In the 4th century applied decoration becomes common. By the 5th century stamped central [[Motif (visual arts)|motif]]s such as animals, crosses and humans are common on larger plates. Paralleling developments in other visual media, gladatorial scenes and references to pagan mythology come to be replaced by [[Christianity|Christian]] figures. In the last phase of production, surface treatment consists of light spiral burnishing on some plates and rouletting around the floor of certain bowls.

==Main typologies==
{{main|List of common forms of African red slip ware}}
In 1972 John Hayes published a type series running from form 1 to 200, with forms 112-120 remaining unused.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, John. (1972). ''Late Roman Pottery''. London: British School at Rome (hardcover, {{ISBN|0-904152-00-6}})&lt;/ref&gt; A supplement appeared in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Hayes, John. 1980. ''A Supplement to Late Roman Pottery''. London: British School at Rome {{ISBN|0-904152-10-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to other previous work, Hayes made use of Waage's work in both [[Antioch]] and the [[Ancient Agora of Athens|Athenian Agora]], as well as Lamboglia's in [[Ventimiglia, Italy|Ventimiglia]].  Michael Fulford's publication of the British excavations at Avenue du Président Habib Bourguiba, Salammbo in [[Carthage]] expanded on the work of Hayes.&lt;ref&gt;Fulford, Michael &amp; Peacock, David. (1984). ''The Avenue du President Habib Bourguiba, Salammbo: the pottery and other ceramic objects from the site excavations at Carthage''. (The British Mission 1.2.) Sheffield: University of Sheffield, Department of Prehistory and Archaeology.&lt;/ref&gt; Carandini's typology, published in ''Enciclopedia dell'arte antica classica e orientale'', is also important.&lt;ref&gt;1981. ''Enciclopedia dell'arte antica classica e orientale. Atlante delle Forme Ceramiche I, Ceramica Fine Romana nel Bacino Mediterraneo (Medio e Tardo Impero)''. Rome: Istituto della Enciclopedia italiana.&lt;/ref&gt; Michael Mackensen offers an alternate typology for later forms based on his work in northern Tunisia.&lt;ref&gt;Mackensen, Michael (1993). ''Die spätantiken Sigillata- und Lampentöpfereien von el Mahrine (Nordtunesien): Studien zur nordafrikanischen Feinkeramik des 4. bis 7. Jahrhunderts''. Munich: Beck (hardcover, {{ISBN|978-3-406-37015-1}})&lt;/ref&gt; Michel Bonifay has also collected previous scholarship alongside his own observations.&lt;ref&gt;Bonifay, Michel. 2004. ''Études sur la céramique romaine tardive d’Afrique''. (British Archaeological Reports International Series 1301) Oxford: B. A. R.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Centers of Production==

'''Alexis Carrington Colby''' (maiden name '''Morell''';&lt;!--''The Authorized Biography of the Carringtons'' (1984) spells her maiden name "Morell", any assertions otherwise must cite a reliable source.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Auth Bio"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dynasty: The Authorized Biography of the Carringtons|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday/Dolphin]]|date=1984|page=28|isbn=0-385-19525-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; formerly '''Dexter''' and '''Rowan''') is a fictional character on the American TV series ''[[Dynasty (1981 TV series)|Dynasty]]''. She is the ex-wife of [[Blake Carrington]] ([[John Forsythe]]) whose schemes cause one problem after another for him and their children.

The role was originated by [[Joan Collins]] in the first episode of the show's second season in 1981, though the character appeared briefly in the first season finale, non-speaking and face unseen. Collins remained on the show until the finale in 1989, and then returned as Alexis for the 1991 [[miniseries]] ''[[Dynasty: The Reunion]]''. The character appeared later in the first season of the 2017 [[Dynasty (2017 TV series)|''Dynasty'' reboot]] series, portrayed by [[Nicollette Sheridan]].

Alexis' schemes to destroy ex-husband Blake, undermine his marriage to  [[Krystle Carrington|Krystle]] ([[Linda Evans]]), and control her children drive much of the action over the series' run. Passionate yet vengeful, Alexis loves her children fiercely and will do anything to protect them, but she often ignores their own needs and desires in place of what she thinks is best. Alexis marries three additional times, to [[Cecil Colby]], [[Dex Dexter]], and [[Sean Rowan]]. She is widowed twice, first by Cecil and then by fourth husband Sean, prompting Alexis' cousin [[Sable Colby|Sable]] to remark that with Alexis "death is always a simpler solution than divorce." Her third marriage (to Dex) ends in divorce after Alexis catches him in bed with her adult daughter [[Amanda Carrington|Amanda]]. The name Alexis uses the most consistently over the course of the series is Alexis Colby, though her marriage to Cecil Colby is her shortest. Alexis is romantically linked to a number of men over the years, including oilman Rashid Ahmed, tennis pro (and Krystle's first husband) [[Mark Jennings (Dynasty character)|Mark Jennings]], [[King Galen of Moldavia]], shipping tycoon [[Zach Powers]], Congressman [[Neal McVane]], Blake's brother [[Ben Carrington]], Dirk and Gavin Maurier, Cecil's brother [[Jason Colby]], and even a near-reconciliation with an [[amnesia]]c Blake.

''[[TV Guide]]'' named Alexis #7 in their 2013 list of "The 60 Nastiest Villains of All Time", and in 2016 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' ranked her #27 of their "40 Greatest TV Villains of All Time". In 2015, executive producer [[Lee Daniels]] noted that [[Taraji P. Henson]]'s character [[Cookie Lyon]] in his TV series ''[[Empire (2015 TV series)|Empire]]'' was partially based on Alexis.

==Original series==

===Development===
In the first season finale episode, "[[The Testimony (Dynasty)|The Testimony]]", [[Blake Carrington]] is on trial for murder, and a female mystery witness in a large hat and veil appears.&lt;ref name="NYM Esther"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KxMCAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32&amp;dq=pamela+sue+martin+leave+dynasty&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YJNGfhghOd&amp;sig=G5SxzxQS2hci3hr7irVt-cEWR-k&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiL1v-s-ZzUAhUBfiYKHfBLAlY4RhDoAQgwMAI#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Real Star of ''Dynasty''|work=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|first=Joe|last=Klein|authorlink=Joe Klein|date=September 2, 1985|pages=32–39|via=Google Books|accessdate=June 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writers [[Eileen Pollock (writer)|Eileen]] and [[Robert Mason Pollock]], brought in for season two, were told by the Shapiros that the character would be Blake's ex-wife Madeline, who would be played by [[Sophia Loren]] for four to six episodes.&lt;ref name="NYM Esther"/&gt;&lt;ref name="HR Spelling"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatedynasty.net/autorizedbio.html|title=Portraying of Characters: Casting (Excerpt of Aaron Spelling/Douglas S.

Series co-creator [[Esther Shapiro]] later said that the character of Alexis was based on the Roman empress [[Livia]], as characterized in the 1934 novel ''[[I, Claudius]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/features/the-good-the-bad-and-the-wildly-bitchy-2192378.html|title=The good, the bad and the wildly bitchy|work=[[The Independent]]|publisher=Independent.co.uk|first=Fiona|last=Sturges|date=January 24, 2011|accessdate=July 20, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of creating the character, Collins said in 2018:

The other part of her brain, the glamorous part with the over-the-top clothes, I based on one of my best friends called Cappy Badrutt. She was extremely glamorous, and unfortunately very miserable. But I don’t think Alexis was miserable. I think she enjoyed her life and lived it to the fullest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a22628104/joan-collins-interview-american-horror-story/|title=Living Legend Joan Collins on Her Past, Her Future, and the Very Bad Advice She Got from Warren Beatty|date=August 7, 2018|work=[[Town &amp; Country (magazine)|Town &amp; Country]]|first=David|last=Netto|accessdate=August 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shapiro said in 1985 that she and costume designer [[Nolan Miller]] "had the same vision" for Alexis: [[Joan Crawford]].&lt;ref name="NYM Esther"/&gt;
{{quote|In fact, Nolan had designed for Crawford, and he told me that she had a photo index of every outfit she owned. Everything was coordinated: Each dress had its own particular hat, purse, gloves, shoes, and it never varied. Joan Crawford didn't mix and match. We decided to take it one step further: Alexis would never wear the same thing twice. In fact, no one on ''Dynasty'' would.&lt;ref name="NYM Esther"/&gt;}}

===Characterization===
The character of Alexis is a foil for "good girl" [[Krystle Carrington|Krystle]] ([[Linda Evans]]),&lt;ref name="Newcomb Encyc"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JUzIAgAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=Encyclopedia+of+Television+edited+by+Horace+Newcomb+dynasty&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjo5LKIvfreAhVjyVQKHdMCANcQ6AEIKjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=dynasty&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of Television|first=Sharon R.|last=Mazzarella|editor-first=Horace|editor-last=Newcomb|chapter=''Dynasty''|date=February 3, 2014|publisher=[[Routledge]]|pages=771–773|via=Google Books|isbn=1-57958-394-6|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; with an opposing moral stature and attitude.&lt;ref name="women"&gt;{{cite book |first=Christine |last=Geraghty |title=Women and Soap Opera |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=d3hWqZwJgN8C&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Krystle+Carrington#PPA90,M1|year=1991|publisher=Wiley-Blackwell|isbn=978-0-7456-0568-5|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; Described as "scheming, conniving, and ruthless", Alexis was often called a "suberbitch" and the "quintessential character you love to hate" by critics.&lt;ref name="Newcomb Encyc"/&gt;

===Appearances===
Though Maggie Wickman appeared briefly at the end of the first season finale as the veiled surprise witness, the role of Alexis was originated by [[Joan Collins]] in the first episode of the show's second season in 1981.&lt;ref name="SOE 1985"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schemering|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Schemering|title=[[The Soap Opera Encyclopedia (Schemering book)|The Soap Opera Encyclopedia]]|date=September 1985|publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]|isbn=0-345-32459-5|edition=1st|pages=80–84}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collins was an English actress with a prolific film and television career, best known at that point for appearing in the [[Bette Davis]] film ''[[The Virgin Queen (1955 film)|The Virgin Queen]]'' (1955), and for [[B movies]] like ''[[Land of the Pharaohs]]'' (1955), ''[[The Stud (film)|The Stud]]'' (1978), and ''[[The Bitch (film)|The Bitch]]'' (1979).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.com/archive/a-determined-actress-pulls-her-daughter-from-the-depths-of-a-coma-vol-16-no-20/|title=A Determined Actress Pulls Her Daughter from the Depths of a Coma|work=[[People (magazine)|People]]|first=Joan|last=Collins|date=November 16, 1981|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gritten|first=David|url=http://people.com/archive/imperfect-past-behind-her-joan-collins-says-she-likes-turning-homebody-vol-12-no-22/|title=Imperfect Past Behind Her, Joan Collins Says She Likes Turning Homebody|work=People|date=November 26, 1979|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2009/dec/31/the-virgin-queen-reel-history|title=''The Virgin Queen'': red tights, black teeth and a kitten-fight|first=Alex von|last=Tunzelmann|date=December 31, 2009|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/536419%7C0/The-Virgin-Queen.html|title=''The Virgin Queen'' (1955)|website=[[Turner Classic Movies]]|accessdate=March 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The addition of Alexis, as well as the Pollocks' change in the writing, were credited with lifting ''Dynasty'' in the [[Nielsen ratings|ratings]], and the character "quickly set off a host of female imitators in other prime-time soaps."&lt;ref name="SOE 1985"/&gt; Producer [[E. Duke Vincent]] said of Collins in 2005, "Joan Collins is the queen of the archetype … How do you get that? You get it in the storytelling, obviously, but the actress herself, her personality, brought something to that role which I don't think anybody else could have done."&lt;ref name="SMH 2005-09-19"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/the-great-escape/2005/09/17/1126750167460.html|title=The Great Escape|last=Idato|first=Michael|date=September 19, 2005|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=February 25, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130091807/http://www.smh.com.au/news/tv--radio/the-great-escape/2005/09/17/1126750167460.html|archivedate=January 30, 2009|deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spelling added, "We didn't write Joan Collins. She played Joan Collins … We wrote a character, but the character could have been played by 50 people and 49 of them would have failed. She made it work."&lt;ref name="SMH 2005-09-19"/&gt; Collins said in 2012 that [[Larry Hagman]]'s performance as [[J.R. Ewing]] on ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]'' had inspired her to play Alexis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite tweet |user=Joancollinsdbe |number=272301497587474432 |date=November 24, 2012 |title=Oh no just heard about Larry , he was magnificent as JR &amp; inspired me to play Alexis. RIP |accessdate=October 31, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alexis' annual [[catfight]]s with [[Linda Evans]]' Krystle became eagerly anticipated,&lt;ref name="SOE 1985"/&gt; and Alexis would later have similar brawls with [[Dominique Deveraux]] ([[Diahann Carroll]]) and [[Sable Colby]] ([[Stephanie Beacham]]). As the sixth season began, Collins was in a tense contract renegotiation with the show, seeking an increased salary. The first episode of the new season, which followed the "[[Moldavian Massacre]]" [[cliffhanger]], was rewritten without Alexis. Collins reportedly signed a $60,000 per episode contract, and returned for the season's second episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatedynasty.net/archives/archives15.html |title=Behind ''Dynasty'' 's breakdown ... and recovery |work=[[TV Guide]] |via=UltimateDynasty.net |date=May 17, 1986 |accessdate=November 20, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331192546/http://www.ultimatedynasty.net/archives/archives15.html |archivedate=March 31, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Storylines===

====Season 1====
In ''Dynasty''{{'s}} first season finale episode, "[[The Testimony (Dynasty)|The Testimony]]", [[Blake Carrington]] is on trial for killing his son [[Steven Carrington|Steven]]'s male lover, [[Ted Dinard (Dynasty 1981)|Ted Dinard]]. A veiled surprise witness for the prosecution appears, and Blake angrily asks his lawyer: "What's she doing here?" Blake's daughter [[Fallon Carrington|Fallon]] gasps in recognition, "Oh my God, that's my mother."

====Season 2====
As the second season opens with the episode "[[Enter Alexis (Dynasty 1981)|Enter Alexis]]", the character has not only a face but a name: Alexis Morell Carrington. She had been exiled from Denver by Blake after an affair with Carrington estate manager Roger Grimes; her testimony, that Blake has a violent temper, proves damaging to his case. At odds with his father, Steven is drawn to the mother he hardly remembers; Fallon, however, is devoted to Blake and has long held a grudge against Alexis, a grudge further fueled by her testimony. Fallon says to her mother:
{{quote|You're even more beautiful and more ugly than that grand English lady I vaguely remember, and whom I've tried very hard to forget existed these past sixteen years.|Fallon Carrington Colby|"Enter Alexis"}}
Alexis soon sparks the ire of Blake's wife [[Krystle Carrington|Krystle]], and brazenly moves into a cottage on the Carrington estate: her former art studio which she still owns, thanks to a technicality. The household staff remembers the first Mrs. Carrington all too well—especially longtime Carrington majordomo [[Joseph Anders]]. Staunchly loyal to Blake, Joseph has a particular dislike for Alexis and has followed her scandalous adventures for years through the tabloids. Fallon, although not openly hostile, keeps an icy distance from Alexis and the two trade subtle barbs; Steven is seduced by his mother's apparent devotion to him, but soon gets a taste of her poison. According to Alexis, Fallon is not Blake's daughter at all: her father is really Blake's longtime friend and business rival, [[Cecil Colby]]. The secret eats at Steven, and Fallon eventually finds out. Ultimately, it is proven untrue. Alexis' consistent meddling and intrusions help improve Krystle's relationship with Fallon, Joseph, and the rest of the household staff, and they soon accept her unconditionally as Blake's wife. Alexis makes an enemy in Krystle when she purposefully fires a shotgun to make Krystle's horse throw her; the pregnant Krystle miscarries and is told she will probably be unable to have more. Alexis becomes romantically involved with Cecil, now Blake's adversary, but Cecil has a heart attack while in bed with her.

====Season 3====
In 1982, Alexis and Cecil marry on his deathbed (episode 40), Cecil exacting a promise from Alexis that she will use his company ColbyCo to ruin Blake. Two episodes previously, after their infant grandson [[L.B. Colby]] (son of Fallon and [[Jeff Colby]]) is kidnapped, former spouses Blake and Alexis make a televised plea that he be returned. Alexis confesses a dark secret from their past: their firstborn son, [[Adam Carrington|Adam]], had been kidnapped as a baby and had never been returned. Traumatized by the event, they had hidden his existence from their subsequent children, Fallon and Steven. Meanwhile, in [[Billings, Montana]], an old woman named Kate Torrance tearfully tells her grandson Michael that he is really the Carrington heir. Armed with items from Adam Carrington's baby carriage, lawyer "Michael" comes to Denver and is eventually accepted as a Carrington; but like Alexis, his selfishness, greed and ambition put him at odds with all of his relatives at one time or another.

In episode 42, Alexis offers Adam a job at ColbyCo. When she also recruits Fallon's husband Jeff, Adam is jealous. Revealing his devious nature, Adam has Jeff's office painted with toxic paint. Gradually, Jeff's behavior becomes increasingly erratic. In episode 51, Alexis sends Jeff away on a vacation. Realizing that Jeff will "recover" when he's not breathing toxic fumes every day, Adam confesses to Alexis, who orders Adam to have the paint removed from Jeff's office. Adam warns his mother that if she betrays him, he will implicate her in the scheme, since Alexis used Jeff's poor health to trick him into signing over his son's shares in Denver-Carrington to her.

====Season 4====
In episode 66, Alexis learns that Fallon is investigating Jeff's mysterious illness and warns Adam that if Fallon learns the truth that he's on his own. In return, Adam tricks Alexis into signing documents that make it look like she ordered the office to be painted. Alexis travels to Montana to investigate her son's background and learns from Dr. Edwards that Adam had experimented with drugs as a teen and suffered a psychotic breakdown. She becomes more sympathetic to Adam at this point, feeling guilty that they gave up the search for their lost son so many years ago, condemning him to such a tragic life. As she doesn't want his past drug addiction to be widely known, Alexis is resigned to suffer the consequences of his actions. Therefore, she gave up her control of Denver-Carrington.

Later, in 1983, she becomes romantically involved with [[Dex Dexter|Farnsworth "Dex" Dexter]], the son of a Denver-Carrington board member Sam Dexter, an old friend of Blake Carrington's. Dex has been sent by his father to understand why ColbyCo. abruptly abandoned its plans to acquire Denver-Carrington. In episode 69,&lt;!-- "69", LOL --&gt; Dex confronts Blake and his ex-wife Alexis Colby. Dex and Alexis are immediately drawn to each other. Dex gets the best of Alexis in a business deal (he discovers information in her office and acts on it before she can) and offers her a 60-40 split so they can work together. Although Alexis resists, by episode 72 they become lovers.

Their relationship is tempestuous and passionate. In episodes 82 and 83, Dex learns that Alexis has slept with Rashid Ahmed in order to sabotage a deal he has with Blake. A furious Dex confronts Alexis. She slaps him - and much to her shock, he slaps her back. Their fight soon turns to lovemaking. However, Alexis continues to demand independence from Dex and he turns to Denver-Carrington PR Director Tracy Kendall for solace in a one-night stand. Tracy tells Alexis about their affair, and Alexis ends their relationship.{{clarify|date=June 2016}}

====Season 5====
After Alexis was arrested for the murder of [[Mark Jennings (Dynasty character)|Mark Jennings]] in episode 88, Dex rallies to her defense and bails her out of jail. Once she is found guilty because Steven testified against her, Dex and Adam desperately try to clear her name. They eventually uncover evidence that [[Neal McVane]] is the killer, trying to frame Alexis for ruining him. Alexis is freed.

Soon after, in 1984, a young woman named [[Amanda Carrington|Amanda Bedford]] appears on Alexis' doorstep; she is Alexis' daughter,&lt;ref group="note"&gt;Amanda's arrival is [[foreshadowing|foreshadowed]] in the season four episode "[[The Birthday (Dynasty 1984)|The Birthday]]" when Alexis mentions that she has been through four pregnancies. Krystle notes the discrepancy (at this time, Alexis is known to have just three children, Adam, Fallon and Steven), but Alexis explains that one resulted in a [[miscarriage]]. Amanda appears 11 episodes later in "[[Amanda (Dynasty)|Amanda]]."&lt;/ref&gt; and as news of her spreads, Blake takes a special interest. He soon learns that Alexis was pregnant when he banished her decades before. Though Alexis insists that Amanda's father is a ski instructor with whom she was involved, it is eventually revealed that she is indeed Blake's daughter.

Unaware of the brief affair Amanda had with Dex when they found themselves snowed in together in a remote cabin, Alexis proposes Dex to marry her and, as he regrets his actions, he accepts the proposal. Later, Alexis becomes suspicious and tries to keeps Amanda out from Dex by marrying her to Prince Michael of Moldavia, son of King Galen that she had known years ago. But during the wedding celebration which takes place in the 15 May 1985 season finale "[[Royal Wedding (Dynasty)|Royal Wedding]]", terrorists interrupt the ceremony in an attempt to kill Galen and spray the chapel with gunfire, leaving the entire wedding party seemingly dead or dying on the floor.

====Season 6====
Alexis survives the wedding massacre, as do most of the wedding guests, but she is kept as prisoner as the rebels want to sign a deal with ColbyCo. Eventually she is released when Blake pays ransom for her (and for Krystle who was also imprisoned). The King is missing and presumed dead, however, Alexis learns that he is being held for ransom. Dex agrees to help her rescue the King. They sneak into Moldavia where they are captured. In episode 125, Dex escapes and rescues Alexis and Galen. Upon returning to Denver, Dex refuses to let a paralyzed Galen recuperate in their home. Dex suspects (correctly) that Galen is feigning his paralysis and tries to force him to walk. When Alexis rushes to his defense, Dex is driven closer to Amanda. When Dex catches Alexis imagining herself as Queen of Moldavia (complete with crown) in episode 135, he is heartbroken. Amanda finds a drunken Dex and they make love again - only to be caught in the act by Alexis in episode 136. Alexis immediately flies to St Thomas for a quick divorce.

In the meantime, Alexis' younger sister [[Caress Morell|Cassandra Morell]] is released from a Caracas, Venezuela prison, having been incarcerated years before after an incident involving Alexis and her then-paramour, [[Zach Powers]]. Calling herself Caress, the younger Morell comes to Denver and hopes to make a fortune by writing a scathing tell-all book about Alexis and exposing her sister's darkest secrets. Alexis finds out about the book, secretly buys the publishing company and scuttles the project.

In 1986, Alexis turns on Blake as she wants him again in her life (episode 137). When he refuses to have an affair with her, she decides to destroy him for good. She flies to Australia and encourages Blake's brother [[Ben Carrington|Ben]] to come back in Denver and claim his share of his late father's estate. Alexis commits perjury on the stand and helps Ben to win over Blake during the trial (episodes 141 &amp; 142). Wanting revenge, Blake mortgages his house and holdings on the hope that he will gain control over ColbyCo. Thanks to Ben and Alexis, he loses both the house and the holdings and also his lucrative South China Sea oil leases. In the cliffhanger season finale, Alexis informs Blake she has bought his house. Furious, he grabs her by the throat and starts to strangle her.

====Season 7====
Alexis is saved when Krystle pulls Blake off of her. Weeks after, Blake finds a way to force Alexis and Ben to relinquish their ownership of Denver-Carrington and all its holdings back to him. Later on, Blake, Alexis, and Ben are in southeast Asia visiting an oil rig when it catches on fire. Ben rescues a trapped Blake moments before the rig explodes. Blake awakens in the hospital with no memories of the last 25 years. Alexis has him discharged from the hospital and convinces him that they're still married. However, when Krystle finds them, Blake's memories return.

====Season 8====
A handsome stranger saves Alexis from drowning in a river in 1987; dashing [[Sean Rowan]] soon sweeps her off her feet and they marry. Sean soon insinuates himself into her business, alienating Alexis' son Adam. It is revealed that Sean is actually the son of former Carrington majordomo [[Joseph Anders]], and is bent on avenging his father (who committed suicide) and sister, [[Kirby Anders|Kirby]] (who had been ill-treated by Alexis). Sean has an affair with [[Leslie Carrington]] and schemes to destroy the family, but is ultimately killed by Dex after trying to kill Alexis.

====Season 9====
A body is found at the bottom of a lake on the Carrington property in 1988. The dead body turns out to be Roger Grimes, the man with whom Alexis was sleeping when she and Blake divorced. He had been dead for 20 years but the cold temperatures in the lake preserved his body. Ultimately, it is revealed that 8-year-old Fallon had shot Grimes after finding him beating Alexis, and Blake's late father had hidden the body in a mine under the lake to protect Fallon.

The situation is complicated by the fact that the mine is full of stolen Nazi treasure, hidden there by Blake's late father. Roger's body had been disturbed from its hiding place by a man looking for the treasure. The man happens to have been hired by Alexis' cousin, [[Sable Colby]] who was looking for some embarrassing information on her ex-husband [[Jason Colby|Jason]]. But Sable has not come to Denver for having a revenge on Jason only but also on Alexis, who has betrayed her at several times in the past. Most of the season's action revolves around the battle between Alexis and Sable.

In episode 220, the final episode of the series, at the Carlton Hotel Dex confronts Sable and Alexis for using him and throwing him aside. He mentions that Sable is pregnant, much to her chagrin. Alexis and Adam taunt Dex with the news, causing Dex to push Adam to the floor in frustration. When Dex turns his back, Adam rushes him. Dex falls backward into Alexis, sending them both crashing through a railing and falling off a second-story balcony while Adam, Sable, and Monica (Sable's daughter) watch in horror.

====''The Reunion''====
Two years after her fall at the Carlton, in 1991, Alexis (who managed to turn in mid-air and land on top of Dex, who "didn't fare that well") meets [[Jeremy Van Dorn]], head of Trans-Media Relations, who convinces her she needs to diversify her business. However, Jeremy is actually working for an international consortium who has its eye on ColbyCo. When Alexis learns the truth and wants to put an end to their partnership, Jeremy tries to kill her but she gets saved at the last minute by Steven.

===Impact===
The additions of Collins as Alexis and the "formidable writing team" of [[Eileen Pollock (writer)|Eileen]] and [[Robert Mason Pollock]] are generally credited with ''Dynasty''{{'s}} rise in the [[Nielsen ratings]] in its second season, the start of the series' rise to #1.&lt;ref name="SOE 1985"/&gt; Collins's performance "set off a host of female imitators in other prime time soaps."&lt;ref name="SOE 1985"/&gt;

Since we live in a world that already knows about Alexis and knows about Joan Collins, we thought it'd be fun to build up that wonderful, delicious character before her grand entrance. We can only bring her in once, so we're taking our time to figure it out.&lt;ref name="TVL Alexis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tvline.com/2017/09/02/dynasty-reboot-alexis-casting-spoilers-interview/ |title=When Will Alexis Join The CW's ''Dynasty'' Reboot?

She wanted it, and she will be great in it."&lt;ref name="DH Pedowitz"/&gt; Sheridan said of the ''Dynasty'' role, "I thought [''Dynasty''] was such a splashy, fun, strong comeback. It was just the right thing at the right time."&lt;ref name="EW Lawsuit"/&gt; Sheridan admitted, "I have always been attracted to playing the naughty girl. And for some reason, my audience loves seeing me in that role. It's challenging to make that person likable, and I get to do it again [with Alexis]."&lt;ref name="EW Sheridan First Look"/&gt; Sheridan's casting was a key factor in the decision to give ''Dynasty'' a [[back nine order]] of episodes after the initial 13.&lt;ref name="DH Pedowitz"/&gt; Pedowitz said in January 2018, "I'm disappointed in the ratings, I wanted it to do more, but I'm happy with the production values that Josh, Steph and Sallie are doing. There are changes coming, I'm thrilled to have Nicollette [Sheridan] ... I'm looking forward to Nicollette and Liz [Gillies] really going at it as a mother-daughter situation, and I think that will add some juice to the show."&lt;ref name="DH Pedowitz"/&gt;

A [[press release]] announced that the character "will return unexpectedly ... challenging Blake's marriage to Cristal, seeking to reunite with her children, and fighting to claim what is hers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thefutoncritic.com/news/2017/11/28/nicollette-sheridan-is-alexis-carrington-on-the-cws-dynasty-625415/20171128cw01/|title=Breaking News: Nicollette Sheridan Is Alexis Carrington on The CW's ''Dynasty'' |publisher=[[The Futon Critic]]|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ew.com/tv/2017/11/28/dynasty-nicollette-sheridan-alexis-carrington/|title=''Dynasty'' casts Nicollette Sheridan as Alexis Carrington|work=Entertainment Weekly|first=Samantha|last=Highfill|date=November 28, 2017|accessdate=November 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Alexis first appeared in episode 16, "[[Poor Little Rich Girl (Dynasty)|Poor Little Rich Girl]]", on March 23, 2018.&lt;ref name="EW Sheridan First Look"/&gt;&lt;ref name="DH Pedowitz"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://deadline.com/2018/01/the-cw-supernatural-future-spinoff-dynasty-changes-valor-fate-sabrina-move-netflix-1202237432/ |title=The CW Boss On ''Supernatural''{{'s}} Future &amp; Possible Spinoff, ''Dynasty'' Tweaks, ''Valor''{{'s}} Fate &amp; Sabrina's Move To Netflix |website=Deadline Hollywood |first=Nellie |last=Andreeva |date=January 7, 2018 |accessdate=February 27, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick said:

===Characterization===
Sheridan said that Alexis "truly is a loving mother", though "sometimes she gets a little lost in her quest for power or manipulation."&lt;ref name="EW Sheridan First Look"/&gt; Of Fallon she noted, "Fallon Carrington is fierce, and upon mama's return, she has met her match tenfold. Alexis has the experience and the wisdom that comes with age. So as brilliant as her daughter is, she's in trouble now. [The writers] are really exploring the mother-daughter relationship, which to me is the most complicated relationship on the planet, so I love that."&lt;ref name="EW Sheridan First Look"/&gt; Patrick said, "It's been a blast writing for Alexis, who in our version is part [[Mildred Pierce]] (willing to do anything to help her daughter), part ''[[Blue Jasmine]]'' (delusional on the verge of a nervous breakdown), and Nicollette is perfect for the role. When she goes toe-to-toe with Fallon, it's electric."&lt;ref name="EW Sheridan First Look"/&gt;

===Storylines===
In "Poor Little Rich Girl", Blake is eulogizing his father [[Thomas Carrington]] when a woman appears whom Fallon recognizes as her mother, Alexis.&lt;ref name="DoG 1.16"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.com/us/tv/dynasty/272010/dynasty-episode-16-review-poor-little-rich-girl|title=''Dynasty'' Episode 16 Review: 'Poor Little Rich Girl'|work=[[Den of Geek]]|first=Delia|last=Harrington|date=March 24, 2018|accessdate=March 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="B+C 1.16"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.brit.co/dynasty-recap-poor-little-rich-girl-episode-16-alexis/|title=''Dynasty'' Recap: Alexis Carrington Sure Knows How to Make an Entrance|first=Andrea|last=Reiher|publisher=[[Brit + Co]]|date=March 26, 2018|accessdate=April 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In "[[Enter Alexis (Dynasty 2017)|Enter Alexis]]", the Carringtons are shocked to discover that Thomas has left the mansion and the grounds to Alexis.

Accused of abandoning her children, Alexis tells Fallon that Blake bribed a judge to seize custody and exile her, which Cristal confirms. Fallon soon discovers, however, that Alexis has not been living a life of luxury abroad, but is housed in a trailer nearby, and has stayed in touch with Steven. A furious Fallon confronts Alexis, and their catfight takes them into the pool.

Fallon thwarts the plan, and Sam assists her in a plot to expose Alexis' machinations to Steven. Fallon manipulates Alexis into confessing, but Steven is more mad at Fallon for endangering Sam.

The '''Anataban Campaign''' ({{lang-ar|انا تعبان}}, ''Ana Taban'', meaning "I am tired") is an [[artist collective]] based in [[Juba]], [[South Sudan]].&lt;ref name=Leach2016&gt;{{cite news |last= Leach|first= Anna  |date= September 21, 2016 |title= Tired of war: South Sudan street artists calling for peace - in pictures |url= https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/gallery/2016/sep/21/tired-war-south-sudan-street-artists-calling-peace |work= The Guardian|location= South Sudan|access-date= June 3, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group uses street theater, graffiti, murals, sculpture and poetry to foster public discussion about the issues of social injustice and government accountability, and transparency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Dahir|first= Abdi Latif |date= September 21, 2016|title= "I am tired": Young South Sudanese are using art to protest the endless cycle of violence and death |url= https://qz.com/786411/south-sudans-ana-taban-campaign-calls-for-change-as-the-country-is-marred-in-civil-war/ |work= Quartz Africa |location= South Sudan |access-date= June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news &lt;!-- staff author--&gt; |date= October 25, 2016 |title= South Sudan artists paint for peace in Juba|url= https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-37754047 |work= BBC |location= South Sudan |access-date= June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anataban members see solidarity, courage, integrity, inclusion, non-violence and political neutrality as the important values guiding their work.

==Background==
The [[South Sudanese Civil War]] began in 2013. The people live in fear because there is a high level of armed violence and sexual violence, mostly against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/uk-southsudan-violence-women-idUKKCN0S11XR20151007|title=Scale of South Sudan sexual violence is unprecedented - Red Cross|last=Esslemont|first=Tom|newspaper=Reuters UK|access-date=2017-02-20|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conflict has affected food production leading to hunger and poverty.

==History==

In September 2016, Anataban was founded in [[Juba]] by a group of [[Demographics of South Sudan|South Sudanese]] visual artists, musicians, actors, poets, and fashion designers. The group was created in response to the [[South Sudanese Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news &lt;!--staff writer--&gt; |date= October 20, 2016 |title= Interview with #Ana Taban Art Movement |url= http://www.africanpoliticsandpolicy.com/?p=4182 |work= African Politics and Policy |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign emerged from a collaborative workshop held in [[Naivasha]], [[Kenya]], with Pawa 254, a [[Nairobi| Nairobi-based]] hub for activists, journalists, and artists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last= Bul |first= Jacob|date= October 28, 2016 |title= 'Tired' of war, young South Sudanese artists form 'Ana Taban' movement |url= http://observers.france24.com/en/20161028-south-sudan-art-ana-taban-youth-music-peace-war |work= The Observers - Copyright France 24 |location= South Sudan|access-date= June 4, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Juba Arabic]], ''Ana Taban'', means "I am tired".&lt;ref name=Leach2016 /&gt;

In ''[[The Guardian]]'', the Anataban collective said, "We are tired of war and all the suffering that comes with it. We are tired of just sitting by and seeing our country burn. We are tired of having a country with vast natural resources and yet a crashing economy. We are tired of the fact that we have a beautiful cultural diversity that is destroyed by tribal animosity. We are tired of having a starving population yet we have a fertile land. We are tired of being used to kill ourselves for the benefit of a few".&lt;ref name=Leach2016 /&gt;

On September 21, 2016, the [[International Day of Peace]] Anataban distributed 1000 white handkerchiefs with the message "we are sorry for what we have done to each other" written on them. They spoke with people in the streets, apologizing for what they have had to endure in this country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Anataban South Sudan|title=#Anataban #PeaceDay Activities September 21st 2016: Juba, South Sudan|date=2016-09-21|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N1Hu5QQs_Og&amp;t=18s|accessdate=2017-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Anataban launched the campaign "#BloodShedFree2017"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://unmiss.unmissions.org/youth-demand-bloodshed-free-2017|title=Youth demand bloodshed free 2017|date=10 February 2017|agency=UNIMISS|last1=Oked|first1=Patricia|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seeks a genuine and permanent ceasefire in South Sudan; security for all citizens; an end to ethnic targeting and violence; protection of the right to free speech; and a return to justice and the rule of law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jx5a88osF2U&amp;t=9s|title=#SouthSudan #BloodShedFree2017 #Anataban Campaign|website=YouTube|accessdate=19 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Messager André compositeur 1921.jpg|thumb|alt=head and shoulder shot of an elderly bald man with a large moustache|André Messager, 1921]]
'''André Charles Prosper Messager''' ({{IPA-fr|mɛsaʒe|lang}}; 30 December 1853&amp;nbsp;– 24 February 1929) was a French composer, organist, pianist and conductor. His compositions include eight ballets and thirty [[opéra comique|opéras comiques]], [[opérette]]s and other stage works, among which his ballet ''[[Les Deux Pigeons (ballet)|Les Deux Pigeons]]'' (1886) and opéra comique ''[[Véronique (operetta)|Véronique]]'' (1898) have had lasting success; ''[[Les p'tites Michu|Les P'tites Michu]]'' (1897) and ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (opera)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'' (1919) were also popular internationally.

Messager took up the piano as a small child and later studied composition with, among others, [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Gabriel Fauré]]. He became a major figure in the musical life of Paris and later London, both as a conductor and a composer. Many of his Parisian works were also produced in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and some on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]; the most successful had long runs and numerous international revivals. He wrote two operatic works in English, and his later output included [[Musical theatre#Early 20th century|musical comedies]] for [[Sacha Guitry]] and [[Yvonne Printemps]].

As a conductor, Messager held prominent positions in Paris and London, at the head of the [[Opéra-Comique]], the [[Paris Opera|Paris Opéra]], the [[Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire]], and the [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden. Although as a composer he is known chiefly for his light works, as a conductor he presented a wide range of operas, from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] to [[Richard Strauss]], and he acquired a reputation as a conductor of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. In Paris he conducted the world premieres of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'', [[Jules Massenet|Massenet's]] ''[[Grisélidis]]'' and [[Gustave Charpentier|Charpentier]]'s ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]''.  At Covent Garden, he gave the British premieres of operas by Saint-Saëns and Massenet.

Messager's music became known for its melodic and orchestral invention, musical craftsmanship, and characteristically French elegance and grace. Although most of his works have been infrequently revived, historians of music consider him the last major figure in French opéra comique and opérette.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
[[File:Messager's-mentors.jpg|left|alt=four head and shoulder photos of middle-aged nineteenth-century men in semi-profile. All are wearing suits and have facial hair.|thumb|upright|Four of Messager's musical influences: clockwise from top left, [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]; [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]]; [[Eugène Gigout|Gigout]]; [[Emmanuel Chabrier|Chabrier]]]]
Messager was born at [[Montluçon]] in central France on 30 December 1853, the son of Paul-Philippe-Émile Messager, a prosperous local tax collector, and his wife Sophie-Cornélie, ''née'' Lhôte de Selancy.&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled, "You would not find any musicians among my ancestors. When very young I learned the piano; but later on my intentions to become a composer met with such opposition from my father".&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wagstaff, pp. 157 and 161&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of seven he was sent as a boarder to a [[Marist Brothers|Marist]] school where he continued his interest in the piano.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Wagstaff, John and [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]]. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/18492 "Messager, André"], ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 15 March 2018 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 1860s disastrous stock-market speculation brought Messager's family financial ruin and they could no longer afford to keep him at the Marist school.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; They dropped their objection to music as a profession, viewing a post as a church organist as a respectable and steady career. He was awarded a bursary to study at the [[École Niedermeyer de Paris|École Niedermeyer]] in Paris, an academy known for its focus on church music.&lt;ref&gt;Ferchault, Guy, and Jacqueline Gachet.

Fauré and Messager quickly moved from being master and pupil to being firm friends and occasional collaborators.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones, pp. 51–63&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 Messager succeeded Fauré as ''organiste du chœur'' (choir organist) at [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]], Paris, under the principal organist, [[Charles-Marie Widor]].&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876 he won the gold medal of the Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique with a symphony, the work being warmly received when performed by the [[Concerts Colonne]] at the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in January 1878.{{refn|Following its good reception the symphony was given several repeat performances soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He won further prizes for his [[cantata]]s ''Don Juan et Haydée'' and ''Prométhée enchaîné''.&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt;

In 1879 Fauré and Messager travelled to [[Cologne Opera|Cologne]] to see [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and ''[[Die Walküre]]'', and later to [[Bavarian State Opera|Munich]] for the complete ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle, ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'' and ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''; in 1888 they went to [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuth]] for ''Die Meistersinger'' and ''[[Parsifal]]''.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent ''Souvenirs de Bayreuth'' (c. 1888).{{refn|The date is Nectoux's estimate.&lt;ref name=n541&gt;Nectoux, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; Wagstaff and Lamb in ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove]]'' put the date earlier, possibly 1880.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The work was not published during either composer's lifetime.

===First successes===

In 1878 Messager was appointed conductor at the [[Folies Bergère]], and he began his career composing for the stage with two short ballets, ''Fleur d'oranger'' (1878) and ''Les Vins de France'' (1879).&lt;ref&gt;Duteurtre, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 a former manager of the Folies, M. Comy, was appointed to run the new Eden Théâtre in Brussels. At his invitation, Messager resigned from the Folies in 1880 and became conductor of the Eden.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Brussels", ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 20 June 1880, p. 12; and Wagstaff, John, and Andrew Lamb.

''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 15 March 2018 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Paris in 1881 as organist of [[Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis]] church, and from 1882 to 1884 he was organist and choirmaster at Ste Marie-des-[[Batignolles]], a small church in the north west of Paris, where his assistant was another young composer, [[Claude Terrasse]].&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt;&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

Messager's career took a new turn in 1883 when the composer [[Firmin Bernicat]] died leaving an unfinished [[opérette]], ''[[François les bas-bleus]]''. Messager was invited to complete it; he orchestrated the entire work and composed between twelve and fifteen numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; It was staged in November 1883 at the [[Théâtre des Folies-Dramatiques]] and was an immediate critical and popular success.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 17 November 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later produced in London and New York.&lt;ref name=ftr/&gt;&lt;ref name=fus/&gt; In 1883, while deputising for Saint-Saëns as the soloist at a concert in [[Le Havre]], Messager met a young woman, Edith Clouette, whom he married in the same year.&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Fauré played the organ at the ceremony,{{refn|As bride and bridegroom processed solemnly down the aisle Fauré mischievously included in his improvisation a tune from one of Messager's Folies Bergère ballets.&lt;ref name=harding124&gt;Harding, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} and composed a mildly cynical song, "[[Madrigal (Fauré)|Madrigal]]", as a wedding present.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; There was one child of the marriage, Jean André Emile Charles (1886–1952).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.artlyriquefr.fr/personnages/Messager%20Andre.html "André Messager"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407135915/https://www.artlyriquefr.fr/personnages/Messager%20Andre.html |date=7 April 2018}}, Association l'Art Lyrique Français, accessed 7 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1883 Messager and [[Emmanuel Chabrier]] gave the first performance of the latter's ''[[Trois valses romantiques]]'' at the [[Société Nationale de Musique]]. The concert also included the premiere of the two-piano version of ''[[España (Chabrier)|España]]'', arranged by Messager.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, p. 47; and Wagstaff, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Messager and Chabrier were close friends until the latter's death in 1894. Both were known for their comic operas and opérettes, but Chabrier's one serious opera, ''[[Gwendoline (opera)|Gwendoline]]'', appealed strongly to Messager, who vowed to conduct it in Paris, which he later did.{{refn|Messager's first Paris performance of ''Gwendoline'' was on 12 May 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Delage, p. 625&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He also prepared a piano reduction of the orchestral parts for the vocal score of the work.{{refn|The score was published in 1890 in Paris by Enoch frères and Costallat; and in Brunswick by [[Henry Litolff]]s Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Library]] catalogue number 004260835; {{OCLC|497254214}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Following the success of ''François les bas-bleus'' Messager accepted simultaneous invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an opérette for the Folies-Dramatiques. The opérette, ''[[La fauvette du temple|La Fauvette du temple]]'', first performed on 17 November 1885, confirmed Messager's early reputation. It ran well into the following year in Paris, and he was able to sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 13 February 1886; "The Theatres", ''The Daily News'', 30 November 1885, p. 2; and "Occasional Notes", ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 17 November 1891, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The ballet, ''[[Les Deux Pigeons (ballet)|Les Deux Pigeons]]'', which became one of Messager's best known works, took longer to reach the stage. It was put into rehearsal at the Opéra, but the staging, which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene, was considered a fire hazard by the police, and the production was temporarily shelved.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 25 October 1884, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after the opening of ''La Fauvette du temple'' the Bouffes-Parisiens premiered Messager's opéra comique ''[[La Béarnaise]]'', with [[Jeanne Granier]] in the title role. It ran for three months and was successfully produced in Britain the following year with a cast including [[Florence St. John]] and [[Marie Tempest]], running for more than 200 performances.&lt;ref&gt;"La Bearnaise", ''The Era'', 2 October 1886, p. 9; "The London Theatres", ''The Era'', 9 October 1886, p. 14; and "The Drama in America", ''The Era'', 2 July 1887, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' said of this production that it gave Messager a secure footing in London, which led to important results later in his career.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Obituary, "M. André Messager", ''The Times'', 25 February 1929, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; A production of ''La Béarnaise'' in New York followed in 1887, under the title ''Jacquette''.&lt;ref name=traubner223/&gt;

In 1886 ''Les Deux Pigeons'' was finally produced at the Paris Opéra and was a box office triumph. It was Messager's last popular success for four years. His attempt at a more serious opera, ''[[Le bourgeois de Calais|Le Bourgeois de Calais]]'' (1888), was not well received. [[Richard Traubner]] remarks in ''Operetta: A Theatrical History'' on its "boring historical plot, bad lyrics, and a banal score";&lt;ref name=traubner223/&gt; a contemporary critic wrote, "That ''Le Bourgeois de Calais'' will have a successful career there is not the faintest chance, for all the patriotic bolstering in the world could not make it an attractive piece."&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 16 April 1887, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Messager followed this with a musical fairy tale, ''[[Isoline (opera)|Isoline]]'' (1888), which was slightly better received, and a three-act opérette, ''[[Le mari de la reine|Le Mari de la reine]]'' (1889), which failed, although Messager thought it "the best of my flops".&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt;&lt;ref name=traubner223&gt;Traubner, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

Messager's fortunes revived in 1890 with ''[[La Basoche]]'', produced with much success at the [[Opéra-Comique]].&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt; The critic who had pronounced so unfavourably on ''Le Bourgeois de Calais'' wrote of the new piece, "an exceptionally pleasing work&amp;nbsp;... a dainty piece which cannot fail to obtain widespread popularity."&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 7 June 1890, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  An English-language version was produced in London in 1891 by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]].

''[[The New York Times]]'', 11 March 1893, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Messager was a dandy and a philanderer. The musical historian [[D. Kern Holoman]] describes him as "given to immaculately tailored suits emphasizing his thin frame, careful grooming with particular attention to his mustaches, fine jewelry, and spats&amp;nbsp;... a witty conversationalist with an inexhaustible store of anecdotes and ''bons mots''" and a womaniser.&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, p. 229–230&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 1890s Edith Messager, tired of her husband's infidelities, divorced him. Shortly afterwards she became ill; her condition deteriorated, and Messager visited her daily. By the time of her death in 1892 the two had become close again, and Messager felt her loss deeply.&lt;ref name=hu129/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1892 Messager's career as a conductor began to advance when he was invited to conduct ''Die Walküre'' at [[Marseille]]. As a composer the early 1890s brought him mixed fortunes. ''[[Madame Chrysanthème (opera)|Madame Chrysanthème]]'', staged at the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]] in 1893, was a setting of [[Pierre Loti]]'s story of a betrayed [[geisha]], a theme that later inspired Puccini's ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''; it was politely rather than enthusiastically received. ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'', produced by Carte at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1894, was Messager's first opera written expressly for the London stage and was the only original [[Savoy opera]] by a French composer.&lt;ref name=traubner213&gt;Traubner, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; To assist him in what was for him (at the time) an unfamiliar idiom, Messager enlisted the help of the songwriter Dotie (Alice Maude) Davis (1859–1938), known professionally as [[Hope Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Coles, Clifton. [http://gsarchive.net/savoy/mirette/intro.html "''Mirette'': Introduction"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180315174638/http://gsarchive.net/savoy/mirette/intro.html |date=15 March 2018 }}, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 May 1998, accessed 15 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; She became Messager's second wife in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]], Messager, concluding from the reception of ''La Basoche'' in London that it was unwise to offer the British public anything too intelligent, decided that the new opera was going to be as commonplace as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Shaw, II, p. 537 and III, p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; It ran for 41 performances, was withdrawn and revised, and then ran for another 61 performances.&lt;ref&gt;Rollins and Witts, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; Messager vetoed any production in Paris.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; His next opera, a serious work, ''[[Le chevalier d'Harmental (opera)|Le Chevalier d'Harmental]]'' (1896), was unsuccessful, and for a while he and his new wife withdrew to the English countryside near [[Maidenhead]], [[Berkshire]].&lt;ref&gt;Duteurtre, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1897 Messager's career revived. He later recalled that he had received by post an unsolicited libretto:
{{quote|I was attracted by the gaiety of its subject, and putting aside my dark thoughts, I set to work on it with such enthusiasm that the work was completed in three months, and performed in the same year at the Bouffes, with great success.

At the Opéra-Comique, Messager conducted the premieres of [[Jules Massenet|Massenet's]] ''[[Grisélidis]]'' and [[Gustave Charpentier|Charpentier]]'s ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]'',&lt;ref name=grove /&gt; and gave the first French performances of operas as contrasted as ''[[Hansel and Gretel (opera)|Hansel and Gretel]]'' and ''[[Tosca]]''.&lt;ref name=d127/&gt; But by far the best known of his premieres was [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'' (1902).&lt;ref name=hol330/&gt; Messager encouraged the composer to complete the opera and worked closely with him in getting the orchestration ready for the premiere.

Cochran]]'s planned production starring Printemps and Guitry.&lt;ref&gt;"Bars L'Amour Masqué", ''The New York Times'', 22 January 1928, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In Messager's late stage works his lighter touch was balanced by echoes of the nineteenth century, with hints of Fauré and, particularly, Chabrier's ''[[L'étoile (opera)|L'Étoile]]''.&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt; Fauré, by 1923 too frail and deaf to go to the theatre, was lent a copy of the score of ''L'Amour masqué'' and wrote to Messager, "Your wit is the same as always – it never grows old – and so are your charm and very personal brand of music that always remains exquisite even amid the broadest clowning".&lt;ref name=harding147/&gt; Fauré died the following year, and Messager dedicated the music of ''Deburau'' to his memory.&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 [[Sergei Diaghilev]] persuaded Messager to conduct the Paris premieres of [[Georges Auric|Auric]]'s ballet ''Les Fâcheux'' and [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]]'s ''[[Les biches|Les Biches]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Messager played a key role in establishing important updates to copyright law, though he was on the losing side of the case. He sued the [[BBC]] for breach of copyright for broadcasting his works without his consent. He lost because he had assigned his British performing rights to [[George Edwardes]], whose estate had given the BBC permission for the broadcast. The case established that as the broadcasting rights had not been specifically reserved, the Edwardes estate's rights included them.&lt;ref&gt;"Summary of Cases", ''The Times'', 9 November 1928, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

After a short illness Messager died in Paris on 24 February 1929 aged 75.&lt;ref&gt;"André Messager", ''The Manchester Guardian'', 25 February 1929, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the [[Passy Cemetery]] near the graves of Debussy and Fauré.&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, p. 169&lt;/ref&gt; His last completed work, the opérette ''[[Coups de roulis]]'', was running in Paris when he died.{{refn|At his death, Messager left some numbers for an unfinished work, ''Sacha'', to a libretto by [[Maurice Donnay]], [[André Rivoire]] and Léon Guillot de Saix. He had composed about a quarter of the score, which was completed by [[Marc Berthomieu]]. It was staged at the Théâtre Garnier, Monte Carlo in December 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://194.254.96.55/cm/?for=fic&amp;cleoeuvre=310 "Sacha"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223085326/http://194.254.96.55/cm/?for=fic&amp;cleoeuvre=310 |date=2014-12-23 }}, ''L'encyclopédie multimedia de la comédie musicale théâtrale en France (1918–1944)'', accessed 7 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} A contemporary critic commented, "Its tuneful melodies show that the veteran composer had lost nothing of the qualities that made ''Véronique'' such a success.

===Honours and awards===
Messager was elected President of the [[Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques]] in 1926, the first composer to hold this office. In the same year he was elected to the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]]. In 1927 he was appointed Commander of the [[Légion d'honneur]].&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; In his native town of Montluçon, the music academy, opened in 2009, is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agglo-montlucon.fr/index.php/conservatoire.html "Conservatoire à rayonnement départemental pour la musique et l'art dramatique André Messager"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601213409/http://www.agglo-montlucon.fr/index.php/conservatoire.html |date=1 June 2016 }}, Montluçon Communauté, accessed 15 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, Messager was the subject of a large exhibition at the Musée des musiques populaires de Montluçon, recounting his biography and illustrating his works in the various genres. Among the ''comité d'honneur'' of the exhibition were the composer's three grandchildren, and the singers [[Susan Graham]], [[Felicity Lott|Dame Felicity Lott]] and [[Mady Mesplé]], the conductors [[John Eliot Gardiner|Sir John Eliot Gardiner]], [[John Nelson (conductor)|John Nelson]] and [[Michel Plasson]], and the director [[Jérôme Savary]].&lt;ref&gt;Duteurtre, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[File:Fauré-ecole-group-.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.25|alt=A group of 18 men in 19th century dress|Staff and students of the École Niedermeyer, 1871. Messager is in the middle row, second from right; his teachers [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]] and [[Eugène Gigout|Gigout]] are in the front row, second from left and furthest right, respectively.]]
In his 1991 study of Messager, John Wagstaff writes that the composer's music is notable for its fine orchestration, easy-flowing melody, and skilfully written music, dance-like in character. Unlike his teacher Fauré,&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Messager enjoyed orchestrating. He said that musical ideas came to him "already clothed in the appropriate instrumental shades",&lt;ref name=h128&gt;Hughes, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; and after the concentrated effort of composing his scores he found it relaxing to work on "the handling of instruments, the balancing of different sonorities, the grouping of colours and the structuring of effects".&lt;ref name=hu129&gt;Hughes, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; He remarked that composers who had their music orchestrated by assistants presumably did not care if their helpers lacked "that indefinable sixth sense which would indicate the right combination of sonorities to carry out the original intentions of the composer". To Messager, passages often depended for their significance or flavour on the orchestral writing alone.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gervase Hughes]], in a study of French opérette, comments that Messager's only technical defect was "one all too common to many composers of operetta – too close an adherence to repetitive rhythmic figures and four-bar rigidity", although such was Messager's "innate artistry that criticism on that score would be academic pedantry".&lt;ref name=hu99/&gt; One of the composer's distinguishing characteristics was a liking for [[chromaticism]];&lt;ref name=ha127&gt;Harding, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; this appealed to a younger generation of composers. His "Eh que ne parliez-vous?", from ''La Basoche'', was quoted note-for-note by [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] in ''[[Les Mamelles de Tirésias]]''.&lt;ref name=ha127/&gt; Although Messager greatly admired Wagner, and was a celebrated conductor of his music, he distanced himself from Wagnerian influences in his own compositions. In ''Madame Chrysanthème'' he made use of [[leitmotif]]s, and included other references to Wagner, but such examples are rare in his works.&lt;ref name=w17&gt;Wagstaff, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballets apart, Messager composed thirty works for the stage; they fall into several different, or sometimes overlapping, genres; the most numerous are opéras comiques (9), opérettes (7) and comédies musicales (3).{{refn|There is no universally agreed dividing line between opéra comique and opérette; a 2003 study of opera suggests that the latter is essentially frivolous, and the former, though often (but not always) humorous, also has some element of genuine human interest and is seen as of loftier artistic intent.&lt;ref&gt;Grout and Williams, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagree that opérette is "essentially" frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;Traubner, "Introduction", second and third unnumbered pages.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The composer remarked late in his career:
{{quote|I have never intended to write what is nowadays called "opérette". This designation – which all too often has pejorative overtones – seems to have become common since the work of [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]]. Many of my works&amp;nbsp;... were only called operéttes at the request of theatre directors who saw in that term some extra chance of success. Neither did I wish to compose [[opéra-bouffe]]s, the best examples of which were provided by the works of [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]], where the element of parody is very dominant. My idea was always to continue the tradition of French opéra-comique (with dialogue) as established by [[opéra comique|Dalayrac]], [[François-Adrien Boieldieu|Boieldieu]] and [[Daniel Auber|Auber]].&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in English in Wagstaff, p. 164. Original French version published in Rohozinski, p. 276.&lt;/ref&gt;|}}

===Early stage works===
[[File:Deux-pigeons-final-tableau-ROH-1906.jpg|alt=photograph of a large ballet troupe posed on a large stage with an elaborate woodland set|thumb|upright=1.75|''Les Deux Pigeons''&amp;nbsp;– final tableau]]
Although Messager called some of his early stage works opéras comiques they have, Gervase Hughes suggests, more in common with opérette than their composer acknowledged. Nevertheless, Messager introduced adventurous modern harmonic details in his early pieces, and strove to raise the artistic standards of opérette to that of opéra comique while retaining the essential panache of the genre.&lt;ref name=h94&gt;Hughes, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes finds the first stage works uneven in quality but ''[[La fauvette du temple|La Fauvette du temple]]'' (1884) to contain two fine expressive duets as well as waltzes and polkas with "an Offenbach lilt".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes judges the next two scores, ''[[La Béarnaise]]'' and ''La Fauvette'' (both 1885), less satisfying but nonetheless at least as good as anything by Messager's older contemporaries [[Robert Planquette|Planquette]], [[Gaston Serpette|Serpette]] and [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]].&lt;ref name=h93&gt;Hughes, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagstaff writes that the composer's most enduring work is the ballet score ''[[Les Deux Pigeons (ballet)|Les Deux Pigeons]]'' (1886).&lt;ref name=wv/&gt; The piece is based on the fable ''[[The Two Pigeons]]'' by [[Jean de La Fontaine]].&lt;ref name=harding124/&gt; The music is best known in the five-movement suite arranged from the full score, which includes the "Entrée de tziganes".&lt;ref name=DeuxROH&gt;[http://www.roh.org.uk/articles/rhapsody-the-two-pigeons-digital-programme-the-two-pigeons-production-photographs "The Two Pigeons"] {{webarchive| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317170225/http://www.roh.org.uk/articles/rhapsody-the-two-pigeons-digital-programme-the-two-pigeons-production-photographs |date=17 March 2018}}, Royal Opera House, accessed 17 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  Messager revived the ballet in 1906 in London and in 1912 in Paris in a shortened, two-act version.&lt;ref&gt;Pougin, Arthur. Review in ''Le Ménéstrel Musique et Théatres'', 30 March 1912&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 [[John Lanchbery]] revised this for [[Frederick Ashton]]'s new version of the ballet, with a closing reconciliation scene from earlier music and a passage transcribed from ''Véronique''. This was first given at Covent Garden, is revived regularly by the [[Royal Ballet]] and has been staged by such other companies as [[CAPAB]] and [[Australian Ballet]].&lt;ref name=DeuxROH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, pp. 315 and 487&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Isoline (opera)|Isoline]]'' (1888), a musical fairy story ("conte des fées"), is neither an opérette nor an opéra comique. Writing in 1908, Fauré called it "one of the most poetic, most expressive works that have been written in France in the last twenty years",&lt;ref name=fauré&gt;''Quoted'' in Duteurtre, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; but it made little impact. The score remained in obscurity until 1930 when [[Reynaldo Hahn]] staged the ballet section of the work at Cannes.&lt;ref name=h125/&gt; The whole piece was revived at the Opéra-Comique in 1958; it failed again, but the ballet, unencumbered by the portentousness of the libretto, which weighs down the rest of the piece, has remained in the repertory.&lt;ref name=h125&gt;Harding, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In the discography section of his book on Messager, Wagstaff lists 13 recordings of the ballet music.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

===1890s stage works===
[[File:La-Basoche-Pick-Me-Up-1891.jpg|thumb|left|alt=black and white drawing of a stage scene showing a plaza with a man addressing a woman, both in aristocratic mediaeval costume|Scene from ''[[La Basoche]]'']]
The decade began well for Messager with the artistic and commercial success of ''[[La Basoche]]'' (1890). Février in his ''André Messager: Mon Maître, Mon Ami'' calls it "the last of the great nineteenth-century French comic operas" ("le dernier des grands opéras-comique français du XIX siècle")&lt;ref name=f49&gt;Février, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it of the greatest importance not only in Messager's career but in the history of French musical theatre.&lt;ref name=f49/&gt; Hughes says it has a good claim to be the composer's masterpiece.&lt;ref name=h93/&gt; The musicologist [[James Harding (music writer)|James Harding]] rates it "the best Messager had written to date&amp;nbsp;... one of his finest works".&lt;ref name=ha127/&gt; When the work was given in London, a year after its Parisian premiere, the reviewer in ''The Times'' called it, "A work of great beauty and charm", although "the influence of ''[[Die Meistersinger]]'' is felt to an extent that is almost absurd both in the bright overture and again in the procession of the guild, but elsewhere the music is as original as it is charming".&lt;ref&gt;"Royal English Opera", ''The Times'', 4 November 1891, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''[[Madame Chrysanthème (opera)|Madame Chrysanthème]]'' (1893), a four-act "lyric comedy" with no spoken dialogue, Messager reached a turning point in his development. The crux of the plot was the same as that later used by [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]] for ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' (1904): a young Japanese [[geisha]] wooed and then abandoned by a foreign sailor.&lt;ref name=traubner213/&gt; Messager's treatment of the story was praised for its sensitivity – reviewers in the Parisian press applauded him for raising opérette to the level of "comédie lyrique"&lt;ref&gt;Février, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; – but he was a self-critical artist, and he felt he had strayed too far in the direction of opera and away from his chosen genre.&lt;ref name=h94/&gt; Harding suggests that the unusual seriousness of the score may be connected with the recent illness and death of Edith Messager.&lt;ref name=ha129&gt;Harding, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hughes and Harding comment that Messager's score is subtler than Puccini's,{{refn|Reviewing ''Madama Butterfly'' at the Opéra-Comique in December 1908, Fauré, whose view of Puccini's music was less favourable than it later became, made a plea for a revival of ''Madame Chrysanthème''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 299; and Wagstaff, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} but add that the almost total eclipse of ''Madame Chrysanthème'' by ''Madama Butterfly'' may be partly due to the relative effectiveness of their libretti.&lt;ref name=h130&gt;Harding, p. 130; and Hughes, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Messager's librettists ([[Georges Hartmann]] and Alexandre André) stuck closely to Loti's original with external local colour, whereas Puccini's, based on [[David Belasco]]'s stage play on the theme, added considerable extra incident to the mainly uneventful story, focusing on the private drama.&lt;ref name=h130/&gt;|group= n}} After this, Messager consciously simplified his style, greatly reducing the harmonic subtleties that had been characteristic of his earlier works.&lt;ref name=hu95&gt;Hughes, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The works from the middle of the decade were unsuccessful financially and artistically. ''[[Le chevalier d'Harmental|Le Chevalier d'Harmental]]'' (1896), classed by Hughes as Messager's first true opéra comique ("in a somewhat pretentious style") was a failure, and an unpretentious opérette in the same year, ''La Fiancée en loterie'', fared no better.&lt;ref name=hu95/&gt; After these disappointments Messager finished the 1890s with two considerable successes. Traubner describes ''Les P'tites Michu'' (1897) as "a sensational hit",&lt;ref name=t214&gt;Traubner, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; and Harding calls it the best of Messager's opérettes so far (classing ''Le Basoche'' as opéra comique, as did its composer).&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The plot was not strikingly original: critics commented that its story of babies switched at birth was already very familiar from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.&lt;ref name=t214/&gt;{{refn|The device was a key plot point in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878) and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889).&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt; A similar plot device had earlier been used by Offenbach in ''[[L'île de Tulipatan]]'' (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Traubner, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Traubner describes the piece as "one of those unusual works that begin well enough and gets better and better".&lt;ref name=t214/&gt; Setting a scene in the market of [[Les Halles]] was not innovative, but Messager's chorus for the marchands and marchandes was out of the ordinary, and Traubner also singles out the duet for the Michus in Act 1: "clever, lilting&amp;nbsp;... pulsating with an elegance and grace that other operetta composers have failed to obtain".&lt;ref name=t214/&gt; He also judges the finales as outstanding, including a waltz number that in other hands would be predictable but is turned by Messager into something much more symphonic.&lt;ref name=t214/&gt;

The final work from the decade was ''Véronique''. Messager described it as an opéra comique, but commentators have classed it as a mixture of opérette and opéra comique.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 133; and Traubner, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The score contains two of the composer's best known numbers, the "Swing duet" ("Poussez, poussez l'escarpolette") and the "Donkey duet" ("De ci, de la").&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; When the work was revived at the [[the Proms|Proms]] in London in the 1960s, the music critic of ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "Charming as it can prove in the theatre, the music alone is a little thin, with none of the piquancy that – thanks perhaps to Gilbert – redeems Messager's famous English contemporary Sullivan&amp;nbsp;... but ''Véronique'' has plenty of pretty things".&lt;ref&gt;"Véronique at the Proms", ''The Times'', 21 August 1967, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It became and has remained the composer's most performed musical theatre piece.&lt;ref name=wv&gt;Wagstaff, John.

===20th century===
[[File:Monsieur-beaucaire1.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a scene in upper-class 18th century costume, a young man kneeling and grasping the hand of a young woman, who is standing and leaning towards him|Marion Green and [[Maggie Teyte]] in ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (opera)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'', 1919]]
Messager's work running opera houses in Paris and London limited his composing between ''Véronique'' and the period after the First World War. ''[[Fortunio (opera)|Fortunio]]'' (1907) was a rare example in his oeuvre of a [[sung-through]] opera. Eight decades later the critic [[Edward Greenfield]] described it as "a long-buried jewel of a piece&amp;nbsp;... an improbable cross between musical comedy and ''Tristan und Isolde''".&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Edward. "Fortunio smiles: uncovering a Messager gem of charm and romance", ''The Guardian'', 15 July 1988, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Unlike many of Messager's stage works, ''Fortunio'' was not seen in London shortly after the Parisian premiere: it was not given in Britain until 2001, when it was greeted as "an adorable blend of romanticism and Gallic cynicism" by ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', "a little-known delight" by ''The Times'', "pure joy" by ''[[The Independent]]'' and "tosh of the highest order" by ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Fortunio", ''The Guardian'', 14 July 2001, p. H17&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} From 1919 onwards Messager composed no more opéras comiques. Among his post-war stage works, ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (opera)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'', a "romantic operetta" (1919), was his second work to an English libretto. French critics were inclined to look down on "Messager's English operetta" as over-sweet and sentimental to suit Anglo-Saxon tastes.&lt;ref name=h141&gt;Harding, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Harding comments that the composer was successful in his attempt to produce an English flavour: one number is "pure [[Edward German]]" and there is much pastiche throughout the score. Despite the critics the piece ran well not only in Britain and the US, but also in France, with more than 300 performances in Paris and a long life in French provincial theatres.&lt;ref name=h141/&gt;&lt;ref name=mbnote/&gt;

Of Messager's 1920s comédies musicales the best known is ''[[L'amour masqué|L'Amour masqué]]'' (1923). The [[Théâtre Édouard VII]] where it was premiered had a small orchestra pit, and Messager developed a new style of orchestration to deliver his desired musical effects with a small number of players. Harding comments that the piece was up-to-date enough to include a [[tango]], "a beautifully written example with luscious harmonies that by contrast show up the threadbare nature of most other efforts of the time".&lt;ref name=harding147&gt;Harding, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-stage works and role in French music===
[[File:André-Messager-c1888.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Head and shoulders photo of a youngish man with receding dark hair and large moustache, wearing striped suit|left|Messager in 1890]]
Messager wrote songs for solo voice with piano throughout his career. Like Fauré, he was fond of the poetry of [[Paul Armand Silvestre|Armand Sylvestre]], and from "La Chanson des cerises" in 1882 to the cycle ''Amour d'hiver'' in 1911 he set thirteen of Sylvestre's poems. Others whose verse he set ranged widely, from [[Victor Hugo]] to [[Frederic Weatherly]] (author of among other things "[[Danny Boy]]").&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In his old age Messager said that he would have liked to write more concert works, but had never had the opportunity.&lt;ref name=xd/&gt; The Symphony in A, written when he was 22, is on the normal classical plan with [[sonata form]] in the first and last movements, a songlike theme in the [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|adagio]] and a [[scherzo]] third movement. Looking back he described it as "très classique".&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; In notes to a 1992 recording of the piece, Xavier Deletang comments that although the influence of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and possibly [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] may be discernible, the work reveals a mastery of instrumentation and a quintessentially French flavour, particularly in the wind parts. The two main subjects of the Allegro ''con moto'' first movement are strongly contrasted, with the opening string theme followed by a chorale-like theme for the winds.&lt;ref name=xd&gt;Deletang, Xavier. Notes to Skarbo CD DSK 3921 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Messager was elected to membership of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1926 the influential musical journal ''[[Le Ménestrel]]'' remarked that this conferred on his chosen genre – opérette – official status and recognition;&lt;ref name=nytdeb&gt;"The Youthful Genius of Debussy", ''The New York Times'', 6 June 1926, p. X5&lt;/ref&gt; but his fame as a composer of light music has tended to obscure his considerable standing in contemporary serious musical circles. It was said of him that he had "seen all, heard all, and remembered all".&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; The leading composers of the time valued his friendship and advice. Fauré called him "familiar with everything, knowing it all, fascinated by anything new".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Messager's younger colleague, the composer Reynaldo Hahn, wrote, "I do believe that no musician has ever loved music as much as André Messager did. In any case, it would be impossible to have a greater musical curiosity than he did, up to the end of his life, too."&lt;ref name=hahn&gt;Hahn, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Like Fauré, Messager wrote musical criticism for ''Le Figaro'' and other publications in the first decades of the 20th century. Unlike Fauré, who was known for his kindly reviews,&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, Jean-Michel. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09366 "Fauré, Gabriel (Urbain)"], ''Grove Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 7 April 2018 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messager was frequently severe. His views carried weight: some of his criticisms were reported in the international press.&lt;ref&gt;"Events of Music Overseas", ''The New York Times'', 1 April 1923, p. X5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Fauré wrote of Messager, "There are not many examples in the history of music of an artist with such a complete education, of such profound knowledge, who consents to apply his gifts to forms regarded, nobody knows why, as secondary".&lt;ref name=fauré/&gt; ''[[Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians]]'' says of Messager, "His style may be described as enlightened eclecticism; his music was characteristically French, and more specifically Parisian, in its elegance and gaiety."&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; In his book ''Composers of Operetta'', Hughes comments that Messager combined "a flow of spontaneous melody worthy of Offenbach with a flair for economic workmanship at least the equal of Lecocq's" and in much of his music "a measure of Massenet's fluent grace, Saint-Saëns's aristocratic elegance, even Fauré's refined subtlety".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; He observes that Messager spanned an entire era: "Auber, [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] were still alive when he began his studies, yet he survived the First World War and witnessed the rise and decline of "[[les Six]]".&amp;nbsp;... For forty years he carried aloft the torch kindled by [[Adolphe Adam]] in 1834; after his death it soon flickered out".&lt;ref name=hu99&gt;Hughes, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conductor===
[[File:Messager-dirigeant-lorchestre-de-lOpéra.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=caricature of elderly man in evening dress conducting an orchestra|Messager conducting at the Opéra, 1908]]
The wide range of Messager's musical sympathies was noted by ''Le Menéstral'', which said that he "has served Wagner, Debussy, Fauré, Ravel and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] when their works were still struggling for recognition".&lt;ref name=nytdeb/&gt; He was widely admired as a conductor. He avoided extravagant gesturing on the podium; Harding records, "His manner was precise and undemonstrative. The baton flicked neatly here and there in a way that meant little to the audience behind him but conveyed volumes to the orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The music critic [[Pierre Lalo]] wrote that under Messager's direction, ''Parsifal'', without losing any of its grandeur, "assumed a French clarity, and a sobriety, nobility and order&amp;nbsp;... even the most famous Bayreuth conductors have not always been able to do this."&lt;ref&gt;Lalo, p. 146. ''Quoted'' in English in Wagstaff, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone shared Lalo's view; some audience members equated undemonstrativeness with dullness: Reynaldo Hahn commented, "[Messager] is not a master of the theatre ["chef du théâtre"], being too exclusively musical; he sets too much store by detail without feeling the spirit of the public behind him, and does not understand the variable musical flow that makes one hold one's breath, sigh and wait."&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wagstaff, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Hahn admired Messager as an orchestral conductor:
&lt;blockquote&gt; André Messager is the most French of conductors; I mean that in this art he embodies sharpness. Grace and clarity are not uniquely French qualities: they are frequently found among the Italians and even some Germans. But sharpness is a French virtue, and nothing but French. M. André Messager has it to an exceptional degree, and it shows in how he writes, orchestrates, dresses, talks, and plays the piano. But it is when he conducts the orchestra that what one might call his organic sharpness shows itself most forcefully.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Reynaldo, in ''Musica'', September 1908, ''quoted'' in Duteurtre, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Recordings===
In 1918 Messager conducted recordings in New York, with the [[Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire]], of ''Les Chasseresses'' and ''Cortège de Bacchus'' from ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]'' by [[Léo Delibes|Delibes]], Sérénade and Mules from ''Impressions d'Italie'' by Charpentier, the Bacchanale from ''Samson et Dalila'' and the Prelude to ''[[Le Déluge (Saint-Saëns)|Le Déluge]]'', both by Saint-Saëns, and 4½-minute extracts from ''[[Capriccio Espagnol|Capriccio espagnol]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] and ''Le Rouet d'Omphale'' by Saint-Saëns.&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, D. Kern.

==Life and career==

Born on 2 October 1914 in [[Battersea]], [[London]], [[United Kingdom]], Bernarr Rainbow was the son of Ephraim James Rainbow (1888-1983), a cabinet-maker at [[Buckingham Palace]], who later became the Curator of pictures at [[Hampton Court]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia

  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Rainbow first became a church chorister when his family moved to [[Clapham]], and he was intrigued by watching the organist play. 

After another move he attended [[Rutlish School]] in [[London Borough of Merton|Merton]]. Even though he still at school, Bernarr was appointed the organist and choirmaster at St James's, Merton, later holding similar posts at St Mary's, East Molesey and St Andrew's, Wimbledon.&lt;ref name ="ODNB"/&gt;

After his family moved to Hampton Court, Bernarr attended [[Trinity College of Music]] between 1933–1939, where he was a pupil of Dr [[William Lovelock]].&lt;ref name ="Independent"&gt;{{Cite news

  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt; His 21st birthday was marked by a reception and dance at Hampton Court attended by 80 guests.&lt;ref name="appreciation"&gt;'An appreciation of our Founder President', address by Professor Peter Dickinson, accessed 31 August 2007 {{cite web|url=http://www.ctcc.org.uk/address.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928201649/http://www.ctcc.org.uk/address.htm |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While studying at Trinity he earned a living in the Map Branch of the Land Registry near Lincoln's Inn.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;  Rainbow's studies were interrupted by [[World War II]]  and he served with the Army in North Africa and Italy, until he was invalided out in 1944.&lt;ref name="appreciation"/&gt; In 1941 Rainbow married Olive Grace Still (1915–1996), at the church of St Mary the Virgin, Merton; composing the music for the service himself.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

In September 1944 he became Organist of the Parish Church of All Saints, High Wycombe and, a few months later, the Senior Music Master at [[Royal Grammar School, High Wycombe]].&lt;ref name="appreciation"/&gt; He made a considerable public impact at High Wycombe. He produced [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operettas at the Royal Grammar School, put on concerts at the Parish Church, and started a week-long annual Festival there in 1946.  Bernarr's pupils won awards and scholarships and in 1947 representatives from 30 local choirs joined in Handel's Messiah. Bernarr conducted the High Wycombe String Orchestra and was the soloist in his own Piano Concerto. In 1951 the High Wycombe Parish Church Choir was chosen to sing Evensong in the Festival Church on the new South Bank site.  He turned the Royal Grammar School at High Wycombe into a singing school. Bemarr realised that the quality of music teaching in schools was paramount. This meant focussing on the teachers themselves. So in 1952 he became Director of Music at [[College of St Mark &amp; St John|The College of St. Mark and St. John]], Chelsea, the Church of England College for teachers, a remarkable community whose members have stayed friends. Later he became Head of Music at Gypsy Hill College, now Kingston University, and retired in 1978.

His distinguished record was acknowledged when he was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Arts in 1994 and an Honorary Fellow of Trinity College in the following year. He was President of the Campaign for the Defence of the Traditional Cathedral Choir and in 1996 he established the Bernarr Rainbow Award for School Music Teachers.

Bernarr Rainbow died in Esher, Surrey on 17 March 1998 at the age of 83.&lt;ref name ="Independent"/&gt;

'''Brand architecture''' is the structure of [[brand]]s within an organizational entity. It is the way in which the brands within a company’s portfolio are related to, and differentiated from, one another. The architecture should define the different leagues of branding within the organization; how the [[corporate branding|corporate brand]] and sub-brands relate to and support each other; and how the sub-brands reflect or reinforce the core purpose of the corporate brand to which they belong. Often, decisions about brand architecture are concerned with how to manage a parent brand, and a family of sub-brands – managing brand architecture to maximize [[shareholder value]] can often include using [[brand valuation]] model techniques.

Brand architecture may be defined as an integrated process of brand building through establishing [[brand relationships]] among branding options in the competitive environment. The brand architecture of an organization at any time is, in large measure, a legacy of past management decisions as well as the competitive realities it faces in the marketplace.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rajagopal|author2=Romulo Sanchez|year=2004|title=Conceptual analysis of brand architecture and relationships within product categories|journal=Journal of Brand Management|pages=233–247|url=http://www.palgrave-journals.com/bm/journal/v11/n3/abs/2540169a.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==

There are three key levels of branding:

* ''[[Corporate branding|Corporate brand]], [[umbrella brand]],'' and ''[[Family branding|family brand]]'' – Examples include [[Virgin Group]] and [[H. J. Heinz Company|Heinz]]. These are consumer-facing brands used across all the firm's activities, and this name is how they are known to all their stakeholders – consumers, employees, shareholders, partners, suppliers and other parties. These brands may also be used in conjunction with product descriptions or sub-brands: for example Heinz Cream of Tomato Soup, or [[Virgin Trains]].
* ''Endorsed brands,'' and ''sub-brands'' – For example, [[Nestle]] [[KitKat]], [[Cadbury Dairy Milk]], [[Sony]] [[PlayStation]] or Polo by [[Ralph Lauren]]. These brands include a parent brand – which may be a corporate brand, an [[umbrella brand]], or a [[Family branding|family brand]] – as an endorsement to a sub-brand or an individual, product brand. The endorsement should add credibility to the endorsed sub-brand in the eyes of consumers.
* ''[[Individual branding|Individual product brand]]'' – For example, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]]’s [[Pampers]] or [[Unilever]]'s [[Dove (toiletries)|Dove]]. The individual brands are presented to consumers, and the parent company name is given little or no prominence. Other stakeholders, like shareholders or partners, will know the producer by its company name.

Procter &amp; Gamble is quoted by many authors as the antithesis of a corporate brand (Asberg and Uggla, Muzellec and Lambkin, Olins).&lt;ref&gt;Asberg &amp; Uggla (2009) The Brand Relationship Cycle: Incorporating Co-Branding into Brand Architecture&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;L.Muzellec, M.Lambkin (2009). Corporate Branding And Brand Architecture: A Conceptual Framework. Marketing Theory&lt;/ref&gt; "However, this situation changed in 2012. After more than 150 years of invisibility of the organization for consumer, the brand developed corporate brand promise during the 2012 Olympic games. Commercials are aired on television around a message thanking all the "moms". In addition, each of their products is associated with the brand "PG" in advertisements for products.

A recent example of brand architecture in action &lt;ref name="GM_Brand_Architecture_Reorganized"&gt;[http://lisamerriam.com/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company// GM Reorganized Brand Architecture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; is the reorganization of the General Motors brand portfolio to reflect its new strategy. Prior to bankruptcy, the company pursued a corporate-endorsed hybrid brand architecture structure, where GM underpinned every brand. The practice of putting the "GM Mark of Excellence" on every car, no matter what the brand, was discontinued in August, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/driveon/post/2009/08/68497806/1 | work=USA Today | first=Chris | last=Woodyard | title=General Motors to remove its 'Mark of Excellence' logos from new cars | date=26 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the run-up to the IPO, the company adopted a multiple brand corporate invisible brand architecture structure.&lt;ref name="Brand-Architecture-Structure-Choices"&gt;[http://lisamerriam.com/brand-architecture-structure-choices// Brand Architecture Structure Choices&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  The company's familiar square blue "badge" has been removed from the Web site and advertising, in favor of a new, subtle all-text logo treatment.&lt;ref name="GM_Brand_Architecture_Reorganized"&gt;[http://lisamerriam.com/general-motors-a-reorganized-brand-architecture-for-a-reorganized-company// GM Reorganized Brand Architecture&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of brands==

'''''Ambassador Brands'''''
Those brands that reflect the image of the company are Ambassador Brands. Success or Failure of these brands affect the favorable or unfavorable opinion respectively, of the company.
E.g.: Colgate toothpaste, the market leader in toothpaste segment in India, can be rightly called Ambassador brand.

'''''Piggyback Brands'''''
The nature of these brands is to live on other brands. They are not profit generators but build their image and gain mileage by riding on the back of these brands.
E.g.: Colgate toothbrush is a piggyback brand which survives on the back of Colgate Toothpaste.

'''''Budget Brands'''''
These brands signify those that are welcomed in every home. They do not lower the status of the upper-middle-class families as well as are affordable by the lower-class homes too.
E.g.: Cibaca toothpaste can be described as budget brand which is mainly targeted in rural areas of India.

==Strategic considerations==
Structuring a company brand portfolio can involve choosing a strategy based upon a number of variables, including the business strategy, market trends, competitive tactics, and sources of growth and profit.&lt;ref name="Brand Architecture Strategic Considerations"&gt;http://lisamerriam.com/brand-architecture-strategic-considerations//&lt;/ref&gt; Often [[marketing mix modeling]] is used to help understand the role of brands in a portfolio, and how they support or cannibalize one another. A strong parent brand can be leveraged across multiple sub-brands to help maximize [[Return on Marketing Investment]]. Managing brand architecture to maximize shareholder value can often include using [[brand valuation]] model techniques.

==Job titles==
In the UK, the term "brand architect" is sometimes used, but it is worth noting that the title [[architect]] is a legally protected title controlled by the [[Architects Registration Board]].

'''Buda Castle''' ({{lang-hu|Budavári Palota}}, {{lang-de|link=no|Burgpalast}}) is the historical castle and palace complex of the Hungarian kings in [[Budapest]]. It was first completed in 1265, but the massive [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] palace today occupying most of the site was built between 1749 and 1769. The complex in the past was referred to as either the '''Royal Palace''' ({{lang-hu|Királyi-palota}}) or the '''Royal Castle''' ({{lang-hu|Királyi Vár}}, {{lang-de|link=no|Königliche Burg}}). The castle now houses the Hungarian National Gallery and The Budapest History Museum.

Buda Castle sits on the south tip of Castle Hill, bounded on the north by what is known as the Castle District ({{lang|hu|Várnegyed}}), which is famous for [[Middle Ages|medieval]], [[Baroque]] and 19th-century houses, churches and public buildings. The hill is linked to Clark Ádám Square and the [[Széchenyi Chain Bridge]] by the [[Budapest Castle Hill Funicular|Castle Hill Funicular]]. The castle is a part of the Budapest [[World Heritage Site]], so declared in 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/400 |title=Budapest, including the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle Quarter and Andrássy Avenue – UNESCO World Heritage Centre |publisher=UNESCO |accessdate=16 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==History==

===Middle Ages===
{{Merge from|Medieval Royal Palace (Buda Castle)|date=August 2017}}
[[File:Buda 1493.jpg|thumb|Buda Castle in the ''[[Nuremberg Chronicle]]'', 1493]]

[[File:Mátyás budai vára.jpg|thumb|Eastern view of the Medieval Royal palace (1490s)]]
[[File:Buda látképe-XVI. sz.jpg|thumb|Southern view of the Medieval Royal palace (1520s)]]
The first royal residence on the Castle Hill was built by [[Béla IV of Hungary|King Béla IV of Hungary]] between 1247 and 1265. It is uncertain whether it was situated on the southern tip of the hill or on the northern elevation, near the Kammerhof.

The oldest part of the present-day palace was built in the 14th century by [[Stephen, Duke of Slavonia]], who was the younger brother of King [[Louis I of Hungary]]. Only the foundations remain of the [[keep|castle keep]], which was known as '''Stephen's Tower''' (Hungarian: ''István-torony''). The [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] palace of King Louis I was arranged around a narrow courtyard next to the keep.

[[Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor|King Sigismund]] significantly enlarged the palace and strengthened its fortifications. Sigismund, as a [[Holy Roman Emperor]], needed a magnificent royal residence to express his prominence among the rulers of Europe. He chose Buda Castle as his main residence, and during his long reign it became probably the largest Gothic palace of the late [[Middle Ages]]. Buda was an important artistic centre of the [[International Gothic]] style.

Construction began in the 1410s and was largely finished in the 1420s, although some minor works continued until the death of the king in 1437. The palace was first mentioned in 1437, under the name "''fricz palotha''".

The most important part of Sigismund's palace was the northern wing, known as the Fresh Palace (Hun: ''Friss-palota''). On the top floor was a large hall called the Roman Hall ({{convert|70|xx|20|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) with a carved wooden ceiling. Great windows and balconies faced toward the city of [[Buda]]. The façade of the palace was decorated with statues, a and coat-of-arms. In front stood the bronze [[equestrian statue]] of Sigismund, later repaired by King [[Matthias Corvinus of Hungary|Matthias Corvinus]].

The southern part of the royal residency was surrounded with narrow ''[[zwingers]]''. Two parallel walls, the so-called "cortina walls", run down from the palace to the River [[Danube]] across the steep hillside. The most imposing structure, the Broken Tower (Hun: ''Csonka-torony''), on the western side of the ''[[cour d'honneur]]'', remained unfinished. The basement of the tower was used as a [[dungeon]]; the top floors were probably the treasury of the royal jewels.

The last phase of large-scale building activity took place under King Matthias Corvinus. During the first decades of his reign the king finished the work on the Gothic palace. The Royal Chapel, with the surviving [[Palace Chapel (Buda Castle)|Lower Church]], was likely built at that time.

After the marriage of Matthias and [[Beatrice of Naples]] in 1476, Italian [[humanists]], artists and craftsmen arrived at Buda. The Hungarian capital became the first centre of [[Renaissance]] north of the Alps. The king rebuilt the palace in an early Renaissance style. The ''cour d'honneur'' was modernised and an Italian ''[[loggia]]'' was added. Inside the palace were two rooms with golden ceilings: the [[Bibliotheca Corviniana]] and a passage with the frescoes of the twelve signs of the [[Zodiac]]. The façade of the palace was decorated with statues of [[John Hunyadi]], [[László Hunyadi]] and King Matthias. In the middle of the court there was a fountain with a statue of [[Pallas Athene]].

Only fragments remain of this Renaissance palace: some red marble balustrades, lintels and decorative glazed tiles from stoves and floors.

[[File:Var rondellecivertanlegi.jpg|thumb|upright=1.20|The reconstructed medieval fortifications and the Great Rondella]]
In the last years of his reign Matthias Corvinus started construction of a new Renaissance palace on the eastern side of the Sigismund Courtyard, next to the Fresh Palace. The '''Matthias Palace''' remained unfinished because of the king's early death. The palace had a monumental red marble stairway in front of the façade. Matthias Corvinus was usually identified with [[Hercules]] by the humanists of his court; the bronze gates were decorated with panels depicting the deeds of Hercules, and a great bronze statue of the Greek hero welcomed the guests in the [[forecourt]] of the palace complex, where [[jousts]] were held.

The walled gardens of the palace were laid out on the western slopes of the Castle Hill. In the middle of the enclosure, a Renaissance villa was built by Matthias. Only one column survives of this so-called ''Aula Marmorea''.

After the death of Matthias Corvinus, his successor, King [[Vladislaus II of Bohemia and Hungary|Vladislaus II]], carried on the works of the '''Matthias Palace''', especially after his marriage with [[Anna of Foix-Candale]] in 1502.

Under the reign of King [[John Zápolya]] (the last national ruler of Hungary) the palace was repaired. On the southern tip of the Castle Hill, the Great Rondella was built by Italian military engineers. The circular [[bastion]] is one of the main surviving structure of the old palace.

===Ottoman Era===
[[File:Buda Citerioris Hungariae Caput Regni avita sedes. vulgo Ofen 1617.jpg|thumb|Georg Houfnagel's view of Buda in 1617]]
After the [[Battle of Mohács]], the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary]] collapsed. The [[Ottoman Turks]] occupied the evacuated town on 11 September 1526. Although Buda was sacked and burned, the Royal Palace was not damaged. Sultan [[Suleiman the Magnificent]] carried away all the bronze statues (the Hunyadis, Pallas Athene and Hercules) with him to [[Constantinople]]. The statues were destroyed there in a rebellion a few years later. The Sultan also took many volumes from the [[Bibliotheca Corviniana|Corvina library]].

In 1529 the Ottoman army besieged and occupied Buda again, and the palace was badly damaged. On 29 August 1541 Buda was occupied again by the Ottomans, without any resistance. Buda became part of [[Ottoman Empire]] and the seat of the [[Eyalet]] of Budin.

Although Turkish travel writers wrote enthusiastically about the beauty of the palace of the Hungarian kings, the new Ottoman government let the palace decay. It was partially used as barracks a storage place and stables, and otherwise it stood empty.

The palace was called ''Iç Kala'' ("Inner Castle") and ''Hisar Peçe'' ("Citadel") by the Turks. The name of the ''cour d'honneur'' was ''"Seray meydani"''. The favourite nickname of the complex was "Palace of the Golden Apples".

The economic decline of [[Buda]] the capital city during the Ottoman conquest characterised by the stagnation of population, the population of Buda was not larger in 1686, than the population of the city two centuries earlier in the 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=András Gerő, János Poór|title=Budapest: a history from its beginnings to 1998, Volume 86 van Atlantic studies on society in change , Volume 462 van East European monographs|publisher=Social Science Monographs|page=3|year=1997|ISBN=9780880333597|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=sONnAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22population+of+Buda%22&amp;dq=%22population+of+Buda%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwBDgKahUKEwjIufSz26vIAhXEWxoKHVEpAqg}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ottomans allowed the Hungarian royal place to fall into ruins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Andrew Wheatcroft|title=The Enemy at the Gate: Habsburgs, Ottomans, and the Battle for Europe|publisher=Basic Books|page=206|year=2010|ISBN=9780465020812|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uOYWBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA206 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amortised palace was later transformed into a gunpowder storage and magazine by the Ottomans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Steve Fallon, Sally Schafer|title=Lonely Planet Budapest|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2015|ISBN=9781743605059|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=jOJzBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT443 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which caused its detonation during the siege in 1686. The original Christian Hungarian population didn't feel secure during the Ottoman conquest, their numbers significantly shrank in the next decades, due to their fleeing to the Habsburg ruled [[Royal Hungary]]. The number of Jews and Gypsy immigrants became dominant during the Ottoman rule in Buda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ga ́bor A ́goston, Bruce Alan Masters|title=Encyclopedia of the Ottoman Empire Facts on File Library of World History Gale virtual reference library|publisher=Infobase Publishing|page=96|year=2009|ISBN=9781438110257|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QjzYdCxumFcC&amp;pg=PA95 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Die Einnahme von Buda 1686.JPG|thumb|250px|The [[Holy League (1684)|Holy League]] took [[Buda]] after a long [[Battle of Buda (1686)|siege]] in 1686]]

In the era between 1541 and 1686, the [[Habsburg]]s tried to re-capture Buda several times. Unsuccessful sieges in 1542, 1598, 1603 and 1684 caused serious damage. The Ottoman authorities repaired only the fortifications. According to 17th-century sources, many buildings of the former Royal Palace were roofless and their vaults collapsed. Nonetheless the medieval palace mostly survived until the great siege of 1686.

===Destruction of the medieval castle===
[[File:Ostrom1686.jpeg|thumb|upright=1.2|The great siege of Buda (1686); contemporary drawing]]
The medieval palace was destroyed in the [[Battle of Buda (1686)|great siege of 1686]] when Buda was captured by allied Christian forces.

In 1686, two years after the unsuccessful siege of Buda, a renewed Western European Christian campaign was started to take the city. This time the Holy League's army was much larger, consisting of 65,000–100,000 men, including German, Hungarian, Croat, Dutch, English, Spanish, Czech, Italian, French, Burgundian, Danish and Swedish soldiers and other Europeans as volunteers, [[artillerymen]] and officers. The [[Ottoman Empire|Turkish]] defenders consisted of 7,000 men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Young|first=William|title=International Politics and Warfare in the Age of Louis XIV and Peter the Great: A Guide to the Historical Literature|year=2004|publisher=iUniverse|page=433|ISBN=9780595329922|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wErzZ_lUWAQC&amp;pg=PA432}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a heavy artillery bombardment, many buildings burned and collapsed. The Stephen's Tower, used as a [[gunpowder]] store by the Ottomans, exploded when hit by a single cannon, said to have been fired by a [[friar]] called Gábor, also referred as Tüzes Gábor ("Gabriel Fiery"). According to contemporary sources, the explosion killed as many as 1,500 Turkish soldiers and caused a wave on the Danube that washed away artillery batteries and guards standing on the opposite shore.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

Habsburg military engineers made several plans and drawings of the buildings in subsequent decades. Although the walls mainly survived, the burned-out shell rapidly decayed from a lack of maintenance. Between 1702 and 1715, Stephen's Tower disappeared completely, and the palace was beyond repair. In 1715, [[Charles VI, Holy Roman Emperor|King Charles III]] ordered the demolition of the ruins. Johann Hölbling surveyed the still-existing structures. The king ordered the surviving marble statues, antiquities, inscriptions and coins should be spared (there is no evidence about the realization of the royal decree). The main part of the palace and the Broken Tower were totally demolished, the hollows and moats were filled and a new flat [[Terrace (building)|terrace]] was established. The southern fortifications, zwingers and rooms were buried under tons of rubbish and earth.

===Early Baroque palace===
[[File:Samuel Mikoviny 001.jpg|thumb|The royal castle built under King Charles III (1733)]]
In 1715 a small [[Baroque architecture|Baroque]] palace was built according to the plans of Johann Hölbling. It was a simple rectangular building, with an inner court and a shorter side wing, which was later demolished. The Hölbling palace is identical with the core of the present-day palace, where the Baroque Court of the Budapest Historical Museum is now located.

The interior of the palace was left unfinished when work stopped in 1719. The [[Hofkriegsrat]] commissioned Fortunato di Prati to make several plans for the palace, but lack of money hindered their implementation.

In 1723 the palace was accidentally burned down and the windows were walled up in order to stop further deterioration. Several drawings from the 1730s and 1740s show the unfinished decaying shell of the simple two-storey blockhouse. Some engravings show an idealised finished version which never existed. Sometime around 1730 the roof was repaired.

===Era of Maria Theresa===
[[File:Budapest Budai Várpalota.png|thumb|The façade of the ''cour d'honneur'' constructed under Hillebrandt in the 1760s]]
[[File:Johann Ernst Mansfeld 001.jpg|thumb|The royal castle during the reign of Maria Theresa (1777)]]
In 1748 Count Antal Grassalkovich, President of the Hungarian Chamber, appealed to the public to finish the derelict palace by means of public subscription. Palatine [[János Pálffy]] called upon the [[Administrative divisions of the Kingdom of Hungary|counties]] and cities to award grants for the project. The moment was favourable because relations between the Hungarian nobility and the Habsburgs were exceptionally good. The Hungarians supported Queen [[Maria Theresa of Austria|Maria Theresa]] in the dire need of the [[War of the Austrian Succession]]. The queen was grateful for this, and the new Royal Palace became the symbol of peace and friendship between the dynasty and the nation.

The plans of the splendid, U-shaped Baroque palace with a ''cour d'honneur'' were drawn by Jean Nicolas Jadot, chief architect of the Viennese court. After 1753 the plans were modified by his successor, Nicolaus Pacassi. Ignác Oraschek, master builder, who guided the works, and modified the plans according to his own ideas. The foundation stone of the palace was laid on 13 May 1749, which was the Queen's birthday. The work continued at a good pace until 1758, when financial difficulties caused a seven-year break. By that time only the interiors were left unfinished.

According to surviving historical documents, the layout of the palace followed Jadot's signed plans of 1749. The façades, some interior elements and the St. Sigismund Chapel are the works of [[Nicolò Pacassi]], while the special double false domes were probably planned by Oraschek, formerly the master builder of Count Grassalkovich. Double false domes were typical features of the so-called Grassalkovich-type Baroque castles like [[Gödöllő]]. However, this feature was later removed from the palace.

In 1764 the Queen visited the palace and allotted 20,000 [[thalers]] a year for the work, which recommenced in 1765 according to the plans of Franz Anton Hillebrandt. Hillebrand altered the ''cour d'honneur'' façade of the central wing in [[Rococo]] style. In 1769 the St. Sigismund Chapel was consecrated and the palace was finished the same year. According to the aggregate statement of Grassalkovich, the costs were 402,679 [[forints]].

===Nuns and scholars===
The future of the complex was uncertain; the Queen had no intention to use it as a royal residence, because she did not spend much time in Buda. In 1769 she gave one wing to the [[Sisters of Loreto]], who came from [[Sankt Pölten]]. The building was handed over on 13 May 1770, but the elegant Baroque rooms were considered unsuitable for a [[nunnery]]. Alexander [[House of Keglević|Keglevich]], rector of the [[Eötvös Loránd University]],&lt;ref&gt;Ungarische Revue, Volume 11, S.53, Magyar Tudományos Akadémia, Franklin-Verein, 1891.&lt;/ref&gt; had provided financing to Maria Theresa, which supposedly should have been repaid, according to her letters to her children and friends.&lt;ref&gt;Briefe an ihre Kinder und Freunde; Verfasser/in: Maria Theresa, Empress of Austria; Alfred Ritter von Arneth, Verlag: Braumüller, Wien 1881.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1777 the Queen decided that the University of [[Trnava|Nagyszombat]] should move to Buda.

The nuns moved out and the palace was hastily adapted to use as a university. The work was guided by [[Wolfgang von Kempelen|Farkas Kempelen]] and led to classrooms, teacher's cabinets, museums, a library and a university press being built. In the front, the false dome was removed and a four-storey observatory tower, planned by [[Alfred Hillebrandt]] or Karl Georg Zillack was erected.

In 1778 Hillebrandt built a new chapel for [[Saint Stephen of Hungary|the first king of Hungary, Saint Stephen's]], the mummified right hand, which was recovered by Queen Maria Theresa from the [[Republic of Ragusa]] in 1771.&lt;ref&gt;Europe's centre around AD 1000, Volume 1, page 7, Council of Europe, Art Exhibition, Alfried Wieczorek, Hans-Martin Hinz, Theiss, 2000. {{ISBN|978-3-8062-1549-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Ruđer Bošković]], page 54, Željko Brnetić, Školska knjiga, 1990. {{ISBN|978-86-03-99817-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chapel of the Holy Right was situated near the St Sigismund Chapel, in the middle of an inner court. The outer form was [[octagon]]al and the inside was oval, crowned by a dome. The altar-piece was painted by Joseph Hauzinger.

The ribbon-cutting ceremony of the university was held on 25 June 1780, the 40th anniversary of the coronation of the Queen. The throne room became a splendid [[wikt:aula#Latin|aula]] decorated with frescoes depicting the four faculties. In 1953, two [[grisaille]] frescoes were discovered on the shorter sides of the room.

===Residence of the Palatines===
[[File:József nádor Barabás Miklós.jpg|thumb|Archduke Joseph Anton, [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|Palatine of Hungary]], resided in the castle.]]
Functional problems of the university remained unresolved, which led to the faculties being moved to [[Pest, Hungary|Pest]] in 1783. In 1791 the palace became the residence of the new Habsburg [[Palatine (Kingdom of Hungary)|palatine]] of the Kingdom of Hungary, [[Archduke Alexander Leopold of Austria]]. After the early death of the palatine in 1795, his younger brother [[Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary|Archduke Joseph]] succeeded him, followed by [[Archduke Stephen, Palatine of Hungary|Archduke Stephen]]. The palatinal court in Buda Castle was the centre of fashionable life and high society in the Hungarian capital.

In 1810 the palatinal palace was damaged by fire, but in the next decades, plans were made to raise the building with an upper storey, but they were not implemented, although the observatory tower, which hindered the work, was removed. In 1838 the crypt of the St. Sigismund Chapel was rebuilt according to the plans of Franz Hüppmann: the [[Palatinal Crypt]] was the burial place of Palatine Joseph and his family. The crypt is the only part of the palace that survived the Second World War.

Palatine Joseph established gardens on the southern and eastern hillsides of the Castle Hill according to the plans of Antal Tost. The gardens of Buda Castle were among the most famous English-style [[landscape garden]]s in Hungary.

Palatine Stephen left the palace on 23 September 1848 when a break between the liberal Hungarian government and the dynasty became inevitable.

On 5 January Buda was occupied by the Austrian army led by [[Alfred I, Prince of Windisch-Grätz]]. The chief commander lodged in the royal palace.

On 4 May 1849, the Hungarian army, led by [[Artúr Görgey]], [[Battle of Buda (1849)|laid siege on Buda Castle]], which was being defended by General [[Heinrich Hentzi]]. On 20 May the Hungarians captured Buda with an assault. The palace was the last stronghold of the Austrian troops, and became a site of heavy artillery fighting. The ensuing fire consumed the central and southern wings; they were completely burned out and their interiors were destroyed.

===Era of Franz Joseph===
[[File:Budai var01.jpg|thumb|Buda Castle before its remodeling in the 1880s]]
[[File:Gyoergy Kloesz 001.jpg|thumb|View of the castle before its remodeling, as seen from the Danube]]
The palace was rebuilt between 1850 and 1856 by Josef Weiss and Carl Neuwirth. The 13-axis central wing was raised with a third storey and a squat attic-tower. The central [[risalit]] was decorated with a balcony of six colossal columns. With these changes, the former Viennese Baroque palace of Maria Theresa became considered a more austere [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical Baroque]] building.

The ballroom was redecorated with marbles and stuccoes. After 1853 stately rooms were designed in a French Rococo style, with white-gold [[stucco]]es and furniture from the [[Hofburg]]. The palace was already too small for the needs of the royal court, so the kitchens and service rooms were housed in the neighbouring [[Zeughaus, Buda|Zeughaus]]. The palace was connected with the Zeughaus by a glassed passageway.

On the western side of the ''cour d'honneur'' two smaller buildings were erected, using plans by Weiss and Neuwirth in 1854. The two-storey ''Stöckl'' housed the apartments of the archdukes and imperial officials, whereas the Wachlokal was built for the royal guards.

Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria]] visited Buda Castle in 1856 and 1857. After the [[Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867]], Franz Joseph was crowned king of Hungary. The palace played an important part in the lavish ceremony and was a symbol of peace between the dynasty and the nation.

In the last decades of the 19th century Budapest experienced rapid economic development. Ambitious [[urban planning]] projects were carried out to express the growing wealth and higher status of the Hungarian capital, with special attention being paid to the rebuilding of Buda Castle. The autonomous Hungarian government intended to create a royal palace to match any famous European royal residence (especially their old rival, [[Vienna]]'s Hofburg). The rebuilding spanned forty years, between 1875 and 1912, and caused sweeping changes in topography of the entire area.

First the Várkert-bazár (Royal Garden Pavilion) was built on the embankment of the Danube, at the foot of the Castle Hill, between 1875 and 1882. This [[Neo-Renaissance]] gateway was designed by an Hungarian architect named [[Miklós Ybl]]. The structure was an open arcade, with pavilions, stairways and ramps, and two blocks of flats. Ybl also built a new waterworks pumping station, named Várkert-kioszk (Royal Garden Kiosk), and two stair towers against the medieval cortina walls. The southern stair tower followed French Renaissance style, resembling a small turreted castle, while the northern stair tower was similar to a Gothic brick donjon (a fortified main tower from a castle, also called a keep). Only Várkert-bazár and Várkert-kioszk survive currently.

[[File:Budai var03.jpg|thumb|upright|left|The Danube terrace with Eugene of Savoy's monument]]
In 1882 Prime Minister [[Kálmán Tisza]] charged Ybl with drawing a master plan for rebuilding the palace. In his 1885 plan, Ybl preserved the old Baroque palace, but mirrored it on the western side of the ''cour d'honneur'', which doubled the size of the residence. He also planned a new [[carriageway]] on the western hillside, demolishing the medieval walls and towers of the Újvilág-kert terrace. The narrowness of the natural plateau of the Castle Hill meant there was not enough space for the new Krisztinaváros wing, which Ybl solved by erecting a substructure down to the foot of the hill. The monumental western façade sits on this windowless, three-storey high substructure. The whole block covered almost the entire hill, but the main façade on the ''cour d'honneur'' had the same modest height as the Baroque palace. The façade was clad with stone slabs, while the old parts are stuccoed; hence, the difference between the original Baroque and the Neo-Renaissance wings is obvious. The formerly open ''cour d'honneur'' became a closed court with an arched gateway, guarded by the four lions of the sculptor, [[János Fadrusz]]. The court is called Lions Court (or ''Oroszlános udvar'').

[[File:Buda Royal Castle western courtyard 1880.jpg|thumb|Royal procession in the western courtyard (1880s)]]
The work began on 1 May 1890, but Ybl died on 22 January 1891. His successor, [[Alajos Hauszmann]], slightly modified the plans of the Krisztinaváros wing. In 1896 the building reached the level of the court, and King Franz Joseph ceremoniously laid down the foundation stone of the palace, which was soon completed.

In 1893, the 25th anniversary of King Franz Joseph's coronation was celebrated in the Royal Palace. However, the old banqueting hall proved to be too small, so Hauszmann enlarged the room by knocking down and reconstructing the wall towards the ''cour d'honneur'' (which additionally had the Hillebrandt façade).

In spite of this expansion and Ybl's new wing, the palace was still deemed insufficient for great royal celebrations, so another round of construction began. The north wing, standing on the site of the old Zeughaus, was completely designed by Hauszmann. The architect doubled the Baroque palace on the Danube side, generally imitating its traditional architectural style. At the meeting point of the old and the new wings, a colonnaded portico was erected, with a lavishly-decorated [[tympanum (architecture)|tympanum]] (with allegorical statues by Károly Sennyey) and a flight of stairs called the ''Habsburg Stairs''. The whole palace was crowned with a dome with a copy of the [[Crown of St. Stephen]] at its apex. The dome, like other details of the north wing, shows German ''[[Jugendstil]]'' influences, as does the rear façade towards the western forecourt. This forecourt also contains the [[Matthias Fountain]] (Hungarian: ''Mátyás kútja'') by sculptor [[Alajos Stróbl]]. Above the main gate, towards Szent György tér, stood a statue of the Goddess Hungaria. This side was the main façade of the complex, but it was much shorter and less characteristic than the long Danube façade. The old Chapel of the Holy Right was demolished to make room for a carriageway.

[[File:Budai var02.jpg|thumb|The western forecourt with the facade of the Grand Ballroom]]
Hauszmann designed a new riding school in the former Újvilág terrace, which was now named the ''Csikós'' court, after the Csikós statue of György Vastagh (now in the western forecourt). In front of the long Danube façade, an equestrian statue was erected in honour of [[Prince Eugene of Savoy]], the victorious leader of the Habsburg army in the [[Battle of Zenta]]. The eastern forecourt was closed off with a lavish wrought-iron rail, which ended in a pillar crowned by a statue of the legendary [[Turul]], the sacred bird of the [[Magyars]], spreading its wings above Budapest. Two flights of stairs led up to the Szent György tér, which was on much higher ground.

In the western forecourt, Hauszmann designed a new neo-Baroque guardhouse and rebuilt the old Royal Stables. The Royal Gardens on the southern hillside were famous for their precious plants, glass houses and picturesque terraces. In the middle of the gardens stood the Swiss House of [[Empress Elisabeth of Austria|Queen Elisabeth]], furnished with Hungarian folk art objects. The house was built above the ruins of the medieval gatehouse, partially making use of them.

The interior of the palace was decorated and furnished exclusively with works of the leading Hungarian artists of the age. The Royal Palace was officially inaugurated in 1912. Contemporary critics praised it as the most outstanding Hungarian building of the turn of the 20th century.

===Interbellum years and World War II===
[[File:Royal Castle Budapest 1926.JPG|thumb|View of the dome and the terrace with Prince Eugene's monument (1926)]]
[[File:Budavári Palota 10x15.jpg|thumb|The Royal Palace in the 1930s]]
The Hauszmann palace existed for around three decades: on 30 December 1916, the building played a part in the coronation ceremony of the last Hungarian king, [[Charles I of Austria|Charles IV of Hungary]]. After the 1918 revolution and the removal of the Habsburg dynasty, the Royal Palace became the seat of the new regent of the Kingdom of Hungary, [[Miklós Horthy]]. Horthy lived in the Krisztinaváros wing with his family between the years of 1920 and 1944. In this era the palace was the centre of Hungarian political and social life. Famous guests entertained by Horthy in the palace included King [[Victor Emmanuel III of Italy]] in 1937 and Cardinal Eugenio Pacelli (later [[Pope Pius XII]]) in 1938.

On 16 October 1944 a Nazi German commando unit, led by [[Otto Skorzeny]], occupied the Royal Palace and forced the regent to abdicate. Buda Castle was the last major stronghold of Budapest held by [[Axis Powers of World War II|Axis forces]] during the [[Battle of Budapest|siege of Budapest]] between 29 December 1944 and 13 February 1945. The German and Hungarian forces defending the castle attempted to break the Soviet blockade on 11 February 1945, but failed. Allegedly the Soviet Red Army knew about their plans and had aimed heavy weapons at the possible escape routes hours earlier. This is considered one of the biggest disasters of Hungarian military history.

Heavy fights and artillery fire rendered the palace into ruins. The furniture vanished, roofs and vaults collapsed and the southern and western wings were burned out. The destruction was comparable to that of the great siege of 1686.

===Reconstruction===
Immediately after the war, archeological research was begun in order to unearth the remains of the [[Medieval Royal Palace (Buda Castle)|medieval castle]]. The research, led by László Gerő (1946–1966) and László Zolnay (1967–1979), was likely the biggest castle excavation in Europe. The former Royal Gardens stairways, pavilions and glass houses, which dated from the turn of the 20th century, had to be sacrificed. Important parts of the former Sigismund and Matthias Palace had survived under the thick earth fill.

[[File:Lanc hid - Budapest 3 Febr 1946 Foto Takkk Hungary.jpg|thumb|The burned-out ruins of the Royal Palace and the Chain Bridge (1946)]]
The first reconstruction plan of the medieval remains was written by László Gerő in 1950 and finalised in 1952. The reconstruction work was finished in 1966. Contrary to the generally accepted principles of historic reconstruction, the medieval fortification system was rebuilt in its entirety. Important elements like the 16th century Great Rondella and the medieval Gatehouse, the Mace Tower, the walls and the zwingers were reconstructed according to the results of the archaeological research and contemporary pictorial evidence. The low-lying southern wing of the Gothic palace was also reconstructed, together with the vaulted Gothic Hall and the Lower Church of the former Royal Chapel. Medieval-style gardens were planted in the zwingers. The foundation of the Stephen's Tower was unearthed, but as archaeological evidence was lacking, the tower was not reconstructed. The remains of the Broken Tower were covered again.

The large-scale reconstruction of the medieval fortifications substantially changed the cityscape of Budapest. At the time it was considered a highly successful project, reconciling historical authenticity with urban-planning demands.

In the 1970s, archeological research continued on the northern and western side of the palace, led by László Zolnay. It produced many important achievements, including the Late Gothic Buda Castle Statues. The Karakash Pasha Tower, in the ''Újvilág Garden'', was a Turkish-era tower demolished at the end of the 19th century. Photographic evidence enabled its reconstruction, but the new tower was only a copy of the original, and the details are not considered authentic.

===Modernization===
[[File:Buda Castle 2365941876 12a03f263c.jpg|thumb|The modernist dome designed by Lajos Hidasi in 1961. Vast amounts of art work and sculpture on the exterior and almost all of the interior that survived the war were intentionally destroyed during the postwar reconstruction.]]
[[File:Buda--Castles01.jpg|thumb|Aerial view of the castle today]]
The government made a decision about reconstruction only in 1948. According to contemporary photos, all the important interiors were in a damaged state, but their reconstruction was technically possible. The new communist government of Hungary considered the Royal Palace a symbol of the former regime. Therefore, Hungarian leaders chose to thoroughly modernise the interior and exterior of the palace. Architectural trends played a part in the decision, as modernist architects had condemned the Hauszmann style as "too ornate".

The first modernist reconstruction plan was made by architect István Janáky in 1950. His controversial concept was later modified. In 1952 the Hungarian government asked for help from Poland, because they had successfully rebuilt [[Warsaw]] and, indeed, other cities. A delegation of Polish experts, led by the architectural historian [[Jan Zachwatowicz]], proposed the rebuilding of the Hauszmann palace.

During the 1950s the palace was gutted and all the remaining interior, including the rooms and halls that were undamaged, were destroyed. Important exterior details, such as the main entrance, the Habsburg Steps, the dome, the Royal Stables, the guardhouse and the riding school were demolished, and the remaining façades were simplified. In Lions Court the ornate gates of ''King's Stairs'' and ''Diplomat's Stairs'' were demolished. The doorway of the castle church disappeared, as did the chapel. The detailed Neo-Baroque roofs were simplified and plain new windows were installed. The allegorical sculpture group of the tympanum was destroyed.

At the same time however, medieval elements that were uncovered were reconstructed in what was thought their appearance was. No precise drawings existed of the medieval elements, therefore an approximate reconstruction of their appearance was done.

The modernist dome was designed by Lajos Hidasi in 1961 after Italian Baroque models. The palace was rebuilt by 1966, but the interior spaces were ready only in the 1980s. Buda Castle became a cultural centre, home to three museums and the [[National Széchényi Library]].

===21st century===
In March 2006 the National Office of Cultural Heritage finalised the long-term development plan of Buda Castle. Asserting that the modernisation in 1952–66 caused irreversible damage, they proposed the partial reconstruction of the façades, including the dome and the Habsburg Steps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.nol.hu/archivum/archiv-390037?ref=sso |title=Népszabadság – Papíron szép a Vár jövője |work=nol.hu|accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; No decision has been reached about the realization of the development plan.

On 25 July 2007 Prime Minister [[Ferenc Gyurcsány]] chose the medieval King's Cellar in Buda Castle as the place to announce the list of the "most important public works projects", which was financed by [[European Union]] funds between 2007 and 2013.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfu.hu/a_kormany_dontott_az_uj_magyarorszag_fejlesztesi_terv_akcioterveirol |title=Nemzeti Fejlesztési Ügynökség |publisher=Nfu.hu |date=25 July 2007 |accessdate=19 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206091241/http://www.nfu.hu/a_kormany_dontott_az_uj_magyarorszag_fejlesztesi_terv_akcioterveirol |archivedate=6 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 an international consortium began to build an underground garage for 700 cars under the former Csikós Court. The developer was granted permission to demolish a {{convert|4.5|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|0}} section of the 15th-century castle wall. The demolition was carried out in spite of criticism from archeologists and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Vargha Mihály [1952–2010] építészfórum |url=http://epiteszforum.hu/vedett-falat-bont-a-beruhazo-a-budai-varban-koh-elfogadhato-a-fal-bontasa |title=Védett falat bont a beruházó a budai Várban – KÖH: elfogadható a fal bontása &amp;#124; építészfórum &amp;#124; építészet . város . vizuális kultúra |publisher=Epiteszforum.hu |accessdate=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area had been previously excavated by archeologists, who discovered many important finds, including medieval children's toys and a tooth from the pet [[leopard]] of King Matthias Corvinus.

The castle courtyard was also used as the setting for Katy Perry's 2010 music video, "[[Firework (Katy Perry song)|Firework]]", part of her ''[[Teenage Dream (Katy Perry album)|Teenage Dream]]'' album.

==Medieval wing==

In 1958–1962, architect László Gerő partially recreated the façades of the Gothic castle facing the narrow southern, western and eastern courts. Only the ground and first floors were reconstructed; the castle was originally much higher. The unfinished façade stops at the level of the Baroque terrace above, with two windows opening towards the southern court and another two opening towards the eastern court. The four almost-identical windows are square, four-panel stone constructions of very fine Gothic craftsmanship, with their outer frames decorated with small columns. One window, which had been walled up, was discovered ''in situ'' during archeological research, and the others were reconstructed from fragments by the sculptor Ernő Szakál by means of [[anastylosis]]. The ground floor openings are simpler. An arched stone doorway gives access to the southern court from the cellar under the Gothic Hall.

The façade was originally plastered. The whitewashed surface was decorated with a painted pattern in a rusty hue, resembling [[Rustication (architecture)|rustication]]. Fragments of painted geometrical decoration, a common feature on the medieval buildings of Buda, were discovered on the eastern façade, but it was not restored.

A Gothic balcony tower projects from the wall at the end of the eastern façade. Its reconstruction was a much debated issue, because the balcony tower goes above the level of the Baroque terrace, disturbing the harmonious panorama of the palace. On the other hand, it clearly indicates that there are higher, missing floors.

The balcony tower is a two-storey structure standing on a wide stone basement. The first floor is a solid stone wall without any openings and the niche behind it belongs to the Gothic Hall. The second floor has a balcony with three windows; it is now closed off by a glass wall. Originally it would have been part of an important ceremonial room. The balcony is in the shape of half an octagon. The three Gothic double lancet windows are considered the most important architectural elements of the tower and the profiles; frames and mullions were restored in a simplified form, using many of the original stones. The tower is covered with a flat metal roof.

The Gothic Hall is connected to Stephen's Castle (''István vár'') on the western side. It was named after Prince Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, the younger brother of King Louis I of Hungary. Built in the 1340s–1370s, it is the oldest part of the medieval royal palace. Only the foundation and three interconnected barrel-vaulted rooms survive.

Stephen's Tower (''István torony'') was the keep of Stephen's Castle. However, it was destroyed by an explosion in 1686. The ground floor walls were discovered a little time after 1946. It was a square building (11.7 × 11.1 m), built upon the rock surface of Castle Hill. The walls are 2.31 to 2.7 m thick with narrow [[arrowslit]]s on the southern, western and northern sides. The original doorway, on the eastern side, was walled up after the Gothic Hall was built in the 15th century.

Stephen's Tower was originally a free-standing structure, sited differently from later buildings. The triangle in front of it was walled up to create a continuous southern façade for the palace. During post-war reconstruction, this part of the façade (with a broken stone doorway) was not reconstructed. A vaulted room (6.2 × 6.3 m) on the ground floor was still intact in 1820, according to a contemporary drawing. Although the ribs, [[corbel]]s and [[key stone]] were discovered during archeological research, the room was not reconstructed. A spiral stairway had connected the room with the missing higher floors.

The remaining part of the Stephen's Castle (with the barrel-vaulted rooms behind) has a simple stone façade with a Gothic doorway. The pointed arch was later restored.

==Interior==
The interior from the time of Maria Theresa and Franz Joseph was mostly destroyed during World War II and the post-war reconstruction, excluding the Palatinal Crypt, which survived both. Little information exists about the interiors from the medieval and Baroque eras, but the palace built at the turn of the 20th century was meticulously recorded, using detailed descriptions, photographic documentation and grounds plans. Architect Alajos Hauszmann said about the royal apartments: "I created a {{convert|200|m|ft|-1|abbr=on|disp=sqbr}} long series of rooms, longer than any similar royal apartments in continental Europe except [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]]."

A series of rooms from the medieval castle were unearthed and reconstructed during the post-war rebuilding of Buda Castle in 1958–62. They are now part of the permanent exhibition of the Budapest History Museum in "Building E" of Buda Castle.

===Medieval period===

====Architectural context====
Only a fragment of the medieval castle survived the destruction of 1686–1715. The surviving rooms are not considered the most important ones; and none of the more famous rooms and buildings mentioned in the medieval sources exist today. The rooms which were unearthed after 1946 were only saved by chance and by their geographical position at a lower level than the newly created Baroque terrace. The Gothic Hall and the Palace Chapel were built by King Sigismund Luxemburg at the beginning of the 15th century. The castle wing is surrounded by a complex system of medieval fortifications.

====Castle chapel====
[[File:Buda castle interior church.JPG|thumb|The lower chapel of the medieval castle]]
The first chapel in the castle was probably built in the 14th century during the reign of Louis I of Hungary. Eberhard Windecke claimed in his Chronicle that [[Charles II of Hungary]] was murdered in 1386 in a room from which the royal chapel could be seen. The chapel was again mentioned in the Chronicle of [[Lorenzo de Monacis]], which was written around 1390.

King Sigismund of Luxemburg thoroughly rebuilt the old Anjou castle during the first decades of the 15th century. He erected a Gothic church in place of the former chapel. The Anjou castle's façade was now facing towards the inner palace courtyard, and the long chancel was projecting from the eastern side of the palace. The [[chancel]] was built upon a lower church due to a lack of space on the narrow plateau. The church had a {{convert|21|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|0}} nave and an {{convert|11|m|ft|adj=mid|-long|0}} chancel. The [[flamboyant]] Royal Church of Buda Castle was similar to the more famous [[Sainte-Chapelle]] in Paris.

[[File:Schedel chapel.JPG|thumb|Buda Castle in the [[Middle Ages]], from the Chronicles of [[Hartmann Schedel]]. The castle church, dedicated to St. John the Almoner, is indicated by the blue rectangle.]]
Archeological research proved the date of the church, because 15th-century strata were discovered under the intact brick floor of the lower church.&lt;ref&gt;László Zolnay: A budai vár, Bp: 1981, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1489, Sultan [[Bayezid II]] of the Ottoman Empire sent the relics of [[John the Merciful|John the Almoner]] to King Matthias Corvinus. The King placed the relics in the Royal Chapel, which was re-dedicated and embellished with Renaissance furniture. In 1526, Buda was plundered by the Ottoman Turks after the Battle of Mohács. The relics were rescued in time and carried to [[Pressburg]], where they are still kept currently. A surviving church inventory from 1530 shows a wealth of furnishings. Later, King [[János Szapolyai]] converted the lower church into a bastion. The large Gothic windows were walled up; and only the rectangular arrow slits were left open.

In 1541 the Ottoman Turks captured Buda without resistance, and the Royal Church ceased to be a place of Christian worship. The upper church was destroyed in the 1686 siege of Buda, and the ruins were demolished in 1715. The vault of the lower church collapsed, and the interior was filled with rubbish. The remains were then buried under the new Baroque terrace for two centuries.

The ruins of the lower church were discovered by archeologists in 1949–50. The remains were buried in 1953 because of conceptional disputes about the possible reconstruction. The chapel, finally reconstructed by 1963, was re-consecrated in 1990.

====Gothic Hall====
The Gothic Hall is one of the most important surviving example of secular Gothic architecture in Central Europe. It was built by King Sigismund of Luxemburg in the early 15th century as an extension of the earlier [[Anjou]] palace. It was built on the southern edge of the natural rock plateau of Castle Hill. The level difference between the plateau and the southern court was about {{convert|2.79|m|ft|1}}. A vaulted cellar was built under the hall to span this difference.

The Gothic Hall is an irregular rectangle of {{convert |20.2|xx|11.55|m|ft|abbr=on}}, with a closed niche on the eastern side, which is the inside of the balcony tower. It is divided into two naves with Gothic [[rib vault]]s. The vaults are supported by two massive pillars which come up through the floor from the cellar beneath the room, and in addition, half-pillars in the corners support the ribs. All six vaults are quadripartite, and the two on the inner side are irregularly shaped.

The hall has four windows, two on the southern side and two on the eastern side, with stone benches in the window niches. The Hall was connected to the palace through a door in the northern wall, supposedly on the place of the original doorway. The northern section of the floor is three steps higher.

All the newly built side walls were plastered and painted white, while the original stone surfaces were left uncovered. The ribs, pillars, arches and window niches were restored by sculptor Ernő Szakál in 1961–62. The ribs have a simple profile, but fragments of a more complicated type were also found in the rubble, together with [[Keystone (architecture)|keystone]]s. These pieces supposedly belonged to another stately hall situated above the room, but they were built into the reconstructed vaults by restorers in the 20th-century.

The northern pillar of the Gothic Hall was already discovered by Alajos Hauszmann at the beginning of the 20th century. The remains were buried under the outbuildings of the Royal Gardens, and Hauszmann protected the medieval pillar by building a brick shaft around it.

====Barrel-vaulted rooms====
Three interconnected barrel-vaulted rooms belong to the oldest part of the palace, Stephen's Castle, which was built by Prince Stephen, Duke of Slavonia, in the 14th century. The northern room is larger ({{convert|6.62|xx|9.42|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}) than the southern ones ({{convert|5|xx|4.55|m|ft|abbr=on|disp=or}}). The northern room is covered by an east-west axial vault while the southern rooms have north-south axial vaults.

The southern room is connected to the inner courtyard by a doorway. There is a small window high on the western wall. The middle room has a similar window. The larger northern room has three slit windows, one facing west and two facing north, all had iron rails. The rooms were connected to each other with carved Gothic corbel doors. The walls were originally plastered. In the southern room, a medieval stairway led to a [[trapdoor]] and a medieval toilet hidden in the empty space between the walls of the castle and the keep.

The barrel vaulted rooms were supposedly used as a prison in the Middle Ages. Later the southern vaults collapsed. The intact barrel vault of the northern room was broken by Alajos Hauszmann at the beginning of the 20th century when he filled the cellar with rubble. The barrel-vaulted rooms were restored in 1958–1962.

====Albrecht Cellar====
A medieval cellar north of the barrel-vaulted rooms, later called ''Albrecht pince'' (Albrecht Cellar), is covered with a Gothic brick barrel vault. The walls are blackened from burning. The cellar was probably built by King Sigismund of Luxemburg as the ''Cisterna Regia'', i.e. the great underground [[cistern]] of the palace.

The Cisterna Regia was situated under the former northern zwinger of the palace. This small rectangular courtyard became a private royal garden during the reign of King Matthias Corvinus. The private garden was an early Renaissance ''giardino segreto'' (hidden garden). It was designed by architect [[Chimenti Camicia]] in the 1470s. A well in the middle of the garden was fed by the cistern underneath.

The hidden garden, the well and the cistern survived the 1686 siege of Buda. They were indicated on the plans of the area drawn by military architect Joseph de Haüy in 1687. In 1715–1724 the former Cisterna Regia became the cellar of the new Baroque palace. A section of this room was later used as an ice chamber.

====King's Cellar====
The King's Cellar (''Király pince'') is not a medieval structure, but a Baroque-era brick cellar under the Danube side of Building E. It was filled with tons of earth and rubble, and the original eastern façade of the medieval royal palace survived under the fill. The inner walls of the Baroque palace were actually built upon the old façade. Only the {{convert|7|m|ft|adj=mid|-high|0}} basement section of the original façade remained.

This wing was built by King Sigismund of Luxenburg in the early 15th century and was rebuilt by King Matthias Corvinus 50 years later. The surviving eastern façade was built from large, finely carved blocks of stone. It followed the contour of Castle Hill with a break in the middle. A [[buttress]] was added and a rectangular tower with two buttresses on its corners. The lower part of a balcony on the tower was reconstructed, with three elegant Gothic corbels decorated with cusps.

It was not possible to demolish the King's Cellar because the whole Baroque palace was resting upon it; the inner fill was removed in 1961. The medieval façade was reconstructed inside the cellar space between 1961 and 1965. Large windows were cut in the outer wall of the cellar to let in the daylight. Currently, the architectural history of the palace is discernible by viewing the interwoven layers of the past.

On 25 July 2007 Prime Minister Ferenc Gyurcsány chose the King's Cellar as the place to announce the list of the "most important public works projects", financed by European Union funds between 2007 and 2013.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

=== Baroque and Historicism ===

==== Old ceremonial rooms ====
The old ceremonial rooms were as follows:

===== "Zenta" Room =====
[[File:Zenta Eloterem.png|thumb|The Zenta Room]]
The "Zenta" Room (''"Zenta" előterem'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was situated next to the audience antechamber. It opened from the main staircase of the central wing and was the first room of the ceremonial apartments on that side. In the early 1900s, it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier. The name of the chamber referred to the large painting of the Battle of Zenta contained therein.

===== Audience Antechamber =====
[[File:Fogadasi Varoterem.png|thumb|left|The Audience Antechamber]]
The Audience Antechamber (''Fogadási váróterem'') was situated north of the ballroom on the first floor of the Baroque wing. In the Baroque era it was called ''Antichambre Ihrer Majestat der Kaiserin'' ("Her Majesty the Empress' Antechamber"). The room gave access to Maria Theresa's private apartments from the ballroom. In the early 1900s, the audience antechamber became part of the ceremonial apartments and had the same white-golden Rococo stucco decoration as the white antechamber on the other side.

===== Grand Throne Room =====
[[File:Buda Castle nagyterem-mj.jpg|thumb|The Grand Throne Room (c. 1894)]]
The Grand Throne Room (''Nagy trónterem''), formerly known as the ballroom (''Nagyterem''), on the first floor of the Baroque wing had several layers of Baroque decoration from the second half of the 18th and the 19th century. Two surviving drawings record the oldest form of the room. Jakob Schmutzer's drawing from 1777 shows the opening ceremony of the Eötvös Loránd University after it was moved to the palace. The room had a Late Baroque decoration with double grooved [[Corinthian order|Corinthian]] [[pilaster]]s between the windows and stucco garlands. The walls were decorated with [[Vinzenz Fischer]]'s frescoes of the four faculties. József Pollencig's drawing from 1795 shows a ball scene in the "Prunksaal". The pilasters were kept, but the frescoes were already covered, and the whole room was stuccoed. On the vault the coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary can be seen. After the destruction of the 1849 siege, the room was redecorated in Neo-Baroque style. In 1892 the old ballroom was rebuilt with a new ceiling and a gallery towards the Lions Court; three of its side walls were preserved. It was enlarged again after 1896. The function of the ballroom was given to another new hall and this room was converted into the main throne hall instead. In the early 1900s, the room had a Rococo white-golden stucco decoration with three large chandeliers.

Vinzenz Fischer's frescoes were re-discovered in 1953 during the post-war reconstruction. In spite of this, all the decoration layers were destroyed. Today it houses the Gothic altar collection of the [[Hungarian National Gallery]].

===== White Antechamber =====
[[File:Feher Eloterem.png|thumb|left|The White Antechamber]]
The White Antechamber (''Fehér előterem'') is on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated south of the throne room. In the Baroque era it was called ''Zweyten Antichambre'' ("second antechamber"). In the early 1900s it had a Rococo white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a white Rococo stove.

===== "Coronation" Room =====
[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Koronazas Eloterem.png|thumb|The Coronation Room]]
The "Coronation" Room (''"Koronázás" előterem''), also on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was situated next to the white antechamber. It opened from the main staircase of the southern wing and was the first room of the ceremonial apartments on that side. In the early 1900s it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier. The name of the chamber referred to the painting of Franz Joseph I's coronation as [[King of Hungary]] after the Austro-Hungarian Compromise of 1867.

==== Old royal apartments ====
The old royal apartments are as follows:

===== Small Throne Room =====
[[File:Kis Tronterem.jpg|thumb|left|The Small Throne Room]]
The Small Throne Room (''Kis trónterem''), which was situated next to the Audience Antechamber on the first floor of the Baroque wing. In the Baroque era it was called ''Audienz-Zimmer'' and was part of the Empress' private apartments. In Hauszmann's time it was converted into the throne room of the palace, with a simple Baroque throne under a [[baldachin]]. It had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a Rococo tile stove.

===== "Circle" Tearoom =====
[[File:Circle Teaszalon.png|thumb|The "Circle" Tearoom]]
The "Circle" Tearoom (''"Circle" teaszalon'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and situated next to the small throne room, in the corner of the southern wing. In the Baroque era it was called ''Gesellschaft Zimmer Ihrer Majestat der Kaiserin'' ("Her Majesty the Empress' Parlour") and was part of Maria Theresa's private apartments. In the early 1900s, it had a white-golden stucco decoration with one chandelier and a Rococo tile stove. The furniture consisted a Rococo parlour suite.

===== Antechamber =====
[[File:Eloszoba 25.png|thumb|left|Antechamber, former dressing room of the Queen]]
The Antechamber was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated next to the "circle" tearoom with two windows opening on to the Danube. In the Baroque era it was called ''Ankleide-Zimmer Ihrer Majestät der Kaiserin'' ("Her Majesty the Empress' Dressing Room") and was part of Maria Theresa's private apartments. It was connected to another small room, the ''Frauen Kammer''. In Hauszmann's time the walls were largely clad with wallpaper. The furniture consisted a Rococo tile stove, chairs and paintings. The last small room of the Empress, the former ''Schreib cabinet'' ("writing room"), with one window opening on to the Danube, later became a simple passageway.

===== Smoking Room =====
[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Dohanyzo Szalon.png|thumb|The Smoking Salon, former bedchamber of Queen Maria Theresa]]
The Smoking Room (''Dohányzó szalon'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing and was situated in the middle of the Danube side of the old palace. In the Baroque era it was called ''Schlafzimmer Ihrer k.k. Majestäten'' ("The Imperial Couple's Bedroom"). It was the only common room of Empress Maria Theresa and her husband, Francis I. In the early 1900s, the walls were largely hung with wallpaper. The furniture consisted a Rococo parlour suite and paintings. In the old imperial apartments only the ceilings had the typically white-golden stucco decoration, used in the old ceremonial apartments.

===== Writing Room =====
[[File:Iroszoba.png|thumb|left|The Writing Room]]
The Writing Room (''Írószoba'') was on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was formerly part of the private apartments of Francis I. One window opened to the Danube. In the Baroque era it was called ''Ankleidecabinet S.M. des Kaisers'' ("Emperor's Dressing Room"). It was connected to another small room, the second dressing room. Later, the imperial dressing room was divided with a wall; with half being converted into a simple passageway, the other into a small writing room. In the early 1900s the latter's walls were largely clad with a very ornate Rococo wallpaper. It had a white marble mantelpiece with a large Rococo mirror above.

===== Parlour =====
[[File:Tarsalkodo Terem.png|thumb|The Parlour]]
The Parlour (''Társalkodó terem''), on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was part of the private apartments of [[Francis I, Holy Roman Emperor|Francis I]]. It was situated in the corner of the southern wing with 2+3 windows opening on to the Danube. In the Baroque era the room was divided with a wall, one half named ''Empfangs Zimmer S.M. des Kaisers'' ("Imperial Audience Room"), the other ''Arbeits Cabinet'' ("Study"). In Hauszmann's time, it was converted to a great parlour with wallpaper clad walls, a Rococo tile stove, a chandelier, paintings, chairs and a mirror.

===== Antechamber =====
[[File:Eloszoba 29.png|thumb|left|last Antechamber]]
The Antechamber, on the first floor of the Baroque wing, was the last room of the former private apartments of Francis I. In the Baroque era it was called ''Zweyten Audienz Zimmer'' ("second audience room"). In Hauszmann's time the walls were mainly clad with wallpaper, and it had a Rococo tile stove, a chandelier, paintings and chairs.

====South Wing====
The rooms of the south wing are as follows:

===== Baroque Court =====
The Baroque Court (''Barokk udvar''), a rectangular court, which is the oldest part of the Baroque palace. Here the original 18–19th century façades survived, and in 1997 the court was covered with a glass roof and became the main exhibition hall of the Budapest History Museum.

===== King's Staircase =====
[[File:Királylépcső bejárata.png|thumb|upright|Entrance to the King's Staircase]]
The King's Staircase (''Király-lépcső''), the Baroque main staircase of the southern wing gave access to the private apartments of Emperor Francis I. Both the King's Staircase and its northern twin, the Diplomat's Staircase, had ornate gates opening onto Lions Court, decorated with [[telamon]]s. The kitchens were originally situated on the ground floor of the southern wing, but they were relocated by Hauszmann.

==== Central Wing ====
The central wing had the following rooms:

===== Diplomat's Staircase =====
The Diplomat's Staircase (''Diplomata-lépcső'') was the Baroque main staircase of the central (originally northern) wing and gave access to the private apartments of Maria Theresa. In the 18th century there was an officer's dining room and a smaller kitchen on the ground floor and another dining room with a cafe kitchen on the first floor. The southern and northern (later central) wings had the same ground plan: all the rooms opened from a passageway running along the sides of a rectangular central court. The two monumental stairways were rebuilt by Hauszmann in Neo-Baroque style.

===== St Stephen's Chapel =====
[[File:Kapolna Buda varpalota.jpg|thumb|upright|St Stephen's Chapel]]
St Stephen's Chapel, known before as St. Sigismund Chapel, or Castle Church (''Szent Zsigmond-kápolna'', ''Vártemplom'') was the [[chapel royal]] in the western end of this wing, which had no façades, only a door opening onto Lions Court (through an antechamber). Construction was finished in 1768 and the church was consecrated in 1769. The ground plan was drawn by Nicolaus Pacassi, with the interior was designed by his follower, Franz Anton Hillebrandt. The ground plan followed a typical "violin" form favoured in the Baroque church architecture of Central Europe at that time. It had a rectangular chancel and a nave with four bays for side altars. On the first and the second floors two oratories opened into the chancel and a two-storey high gallery was situated above the entrance. In 1777–78 a new door was opened in the first side bay to give access to the new chapel of the Holy Right. An engraving from 1771 to 1780 shows the original interior design in its completed form: double pilasters, windows with segmental arches, stucco and false marble decoration, double oratory windows and a doorway with a stucco veil drawn aside by flying [[Putto|putti]]. The church was slightly rebuilt by Hauszmann, who demolished the Chapel of the Holy Right in 1899 and built a new chapel for the relic behind the chancel (converting a small recess). This chapel was decorated with the golden Venetian mosaics of [[Károly Lotz]]. A new Neo-Baroque main altar was built in the church in 1899.

20th-century photos testify that the church survived in its Baroque form until the war. During a siege, the vaults of the church partially collapsed and the furniture was plundered. The Castle Church was left decaying for more than a decade. In 1957 the remaining two vaults collapsed, and the church was totally destroyed and converted to exhibition spaces. The altar table was rescued and re-erected in [[Pilisvörösvár]] in 1957. The Lotz mosaics from the Chapel of the Holy Right were also rescued and re-assembled in [[Balatonalmádi]].

===== Palatinal Crypt =====
[[File:Jozsefnador palatin Hungary tombstone.jpg|thumb|upright|Tomb of [[Archduke Joseph, Palatine of Hungary]] in the Palatinal Crypt]]
The [[Palatinal Crypt]] (''Nádori kripta'') was under the former palace chapel and is the only surviving room of the whole Royal Castle. The underground crypt was first used as a burial place between 1770 and 1777. In August 1820, Elisabeth Karoline, Palatine Joseph's infant daughter was buried in the crypt. Seventeen years later, the Palatine's 13-year-old son Alexander Leopold followed. Palatine Joseph decided to convert the crypt into a family mausoleum and commissioned Franz Hüppmann with the task. The work was finished in 1838, and other members of the Palatine's family were reburied here. Palatine Joseph himself was interred on 13 January 1847. The crypt was continuously used by the Hungarian branch of the Habsburg family. It was repeatedly restored and enriched with new works of art, frescoes, statues and ornate stone sarcophagi, made by renowned artists of the 19th century. The last member of the family buried there was Archduchess Klotild in 1927. The crypt survived the war unscathed and was spared during the post-war reconstruction.

The crypt was looted in 1966 and 1973 (during the construction works), when some corpses were thrown out of the sarcophagi by the thieves. The human remains were later identified and reburied. The crypt was restored in 1985–1987. Since then the Palatinal Crypt is part of the exhibition of the Hungarian National Gallery.

====North Wing====

===== Lobby =====
The main lobby (''Előcsarnok'') of the Royal Palace was situated in Hauszmann's Northern Wing On the Danube side. It was a long, rectangular hall divided into four sections with free standing [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] and two square pillars. The section at the southern end was elevated a few steps. Nine arched windows opened towards the Danube. In the middle of the other sidewall, a doorway led to the inner courtyard. The walls and the ceiling were stuccoed. The southern elevation was closed off with a stone balustrade between the pillars and the wall. The ornate lobby was designed for important state ceremonies.

===== Grand Ballroom =====
[[File:Nagy Balterem.png|thumb|left|The Grand Ballroom]]
The Grand Ballroom (''Nagy bálterem''), in the middle part of the northern wing, took over the function of the smaller old ballroom in the Baroque wing. Designed by Hauszmann, it was the most splendid room of the palace. The two-storey high, airy room was lavishly decorated with stuccoes, half columns, trabeation, balconies and six crystal chandeliers in Neo-Baroque style. Seven arched windows and doorways opened towards a pillared terrace facing the western forecourt. On the other side, the ballroom was connected to the Buffet Hall through three doors.

Photos made after the war show the room with its vaulted ceiling collapsed. The ballroom was not restored but totally destroyed in the course of the post-war remodelling.

===== Dining Hall =====
[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Buffet Csarnok.png|thumb|The Dining Hall]]
The Dining Hall (''Buffet-csarnok''), on the Danube side of the northern wing, was a very long hall used for state banquets. It was connected to the Great Ballroom nearby and it was possible to join them together. There was a shorter, passage-like space between the two rooms. This passage was separated from the Buffet Hall by six square pillars, while its other side was a solid wall with three doors. On the eastern side of the Buffet Hall a long row of windows opened towards the Danube and a pillared terrace. The Buffet Hall was divided into three sections with free-standing Ionic columns, holding trabeations. The vaulted ceiling was lavishly decorated with frescoes and stuccoes.

===== Habsburg Hall =====
[[File:Budapest, Királyi Palota, Habsburg Nagyterem.png|thumb|left|The Habsburg Hall]]
The Habsburg Hall (''Habsburg terem'') was situated in the middle of the long palace complex, under Hauszmann's (false) dome, where the new northern wing and the old palace met. Although this part of the building belonged to the original palace, it was thoroughly rebuilt by Hauszmann–this stately room was totally his own work. It was one of the three historical rooms of the palace representing the important periods of Hungarian history. A free-standing, double flight of steps, called the Habsburg Steps, connected the room with the Royal Gardens on the Danube terrace. The room had lavish Baroque decorations with half-pillars and gilded stuccoes. The vaulted ceiling was decorated with Károly Lotz's fresco ''Apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty''. Károly Senyei's four [[Carrara marble]] busts stood in front of the sidewalls representing King Charles III, Queen Maria Theresa, King Franz Joseph and [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Queen Elisabeth]].

The Habsburg Hall survived World War II relatively undamaged, but in the 1950s it was demolished for political reasons.

====Krisztinaváros wing====
[[File:BudapestDSCN3998.JPG|thumb|Wing facing the district of Krisztinaváros]]
The Krisztinaváros wing faces the district of [[Krisztinaváros]], which was named in honour of the daughter of Queen Maria Theresa, Archduchess [[Maria Christina, Duchess of Teschen]].

===== Entrance hall =====
The entrance hall (''Előcsarnok'') opened from Lions Court, under an arcaded Neo-Renaissance portico, through ornate wrought-iron doors. This now serves as the entrance of the [[Hungarian National Library]]. The hall was a long, oblong-shaped room with 4+4 free standing Ionic columns in front of the walls on the longer sides, holding a trabeation. In the end of the shorter sides two doors opened into antechambers. The three arcaded doorways on the longer side opened into a lobby. The ceiling of the hallway was stuccoed, and the whole design was Italian Renaissance in style.

===== Lobby =====
The lobby (''Előcsarnok'') was connected to the hall of the main staircase through pillars. The stuccoed ceiling was held up by two rectangular pillars. The apartments of Archduke József Ágost and his wife, Archduchess Auguszta, were situated on the ground floor of the Krisztinaváros wing and opened from this room. Now it serves as the lobby of the Hungarian National Library in a radically modernised form.

===== Main Staircase =====
[[File:Lepcsohaz.jpg|thumb|The Grand Staircase]]
The monumental main staircase (''Főlépcsőház''), with three flights, led up from the lobby to the first floor in an airy, glass-roofed hall. The side walls of the hall were decorated in Italian Renaissance style with colossal Corinthian half-columns, stuccoes and lunette openings. Ornate wrought-iron chandeliers and intricate balustrades decorated the stairs. On the ground floor, colossal [[Atlas (architecture)|Atlas statues]] stood beside the side pillars, holding the weight of the upper flights. The marble statues were the works of János Fadrusz from 1897. During the post-war reconstruction the main staircase was radically modernised. Only the two colossal Atlas statues survived. Now they are standing somewhat incongruently near their original places.

===== St Stephen's Room =====
[[File:Szent Istvan Terem.png|thumb|left|St Stephen's Room]]
St Stephen's Room (''"Szent István" terem''), on the first floor of the Krisztinaváros wing, was one of the "historical rooms" of the palace, created by Hauszmann. Together with the Matthias Room and the Habsburg Room, they represented the three most important periods of [[History of Hungary|Hungarian history]]. Saint Stephen's Room connected the new Private Royal Apartments and—through a very long passageway—the Old Royal Apartments in the Danube Wing. Its style evoked the age of the [[Árpáds]], the first Hungarian dynasty in the early Middle Ages. The walls were clad with dark carved wood paneling. The most spectacular item was a large stone mantelpiece with [[Romanesque Revival architecture|Romanesque Revival]] architectural details and the bust of King [[Stephen I of Hungary|Saint Stephen]], the first king of Hungary. The room was furnished with medieval-looking metal chandeliers and heavy wooden furniture.

===== Matthias Room =====
[[File:Matyas Terem 1903.jpg|thumb|Matthias Room]]
Matthias Room (''Mátyás terem'') was named after King [[Matthias Corvinus]], who ruled in the late Middle Ages. It was one of the three "historical rooms" of the palace, created by Hauszmann. The room opened from the Royal Bedroom, at the end of the line of private apartments. It had three windows opening towards the hills of Buda. There was a long terrace in front of the room. The style of the Matthias Room was [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], with carved wooden paneling and a coffered ceiling. It was furnished with a mantelpiece in the corner and two chandeliers, the most spectacular item being the equestrian statue of King Matthias, sculpted by János Fadrusz. The statue was a miniature copy of the original standing on the main square of [[Kolozsvár]] (now Cluj-Napoca). This copy was saved after the war and put on display in the Hungarian National Gallery.

===== Strong Room =====
The Hungarian crown jewels were kept in the specially-designed Strong Room (''Páncélterem'') on the second floor of the Krisztinaváros Wing. The [[Crown of Saint Stephen]] was kept here between 1900 and 1944.

===== Queen Elisabeth Memorial Museum =====
The small Queen Elisabeth Memorial Museum (''Erzsébet Királyné Emlékmúzeum'') on the second floor of the Krisztinaváros Wing was established in remembrance of Queen Elisabeth after her murder in 1898. Memorabilia were collected by Ida Ferenczy, Elisabeth's former [[lady-in-waiting]], Viscountess Pallavicini and Countess Ilona Batthyány. The museum opened on 15 January 1908 as an affiliate of the [[Hungarian National Museum]]. The collection contained personal items, letters and clothes. Its most important relic was the costume that Elisabeth had been wearing when she was murdered. One room was meticulously recreated as the Queen's own writing room with her original writing desk and her 219 Hungarian books. The museum was badly damaged during World War II,&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;"Budapest including the Banks of the Danube, the Buda Castle", UNESCO.hu, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; and the surviving relics were bestowed to other museums.

====Private royal apartments====

===== Royal Entrance Hall =====
[[File:I. Fejedelmi eloterem 54.jpg|thumb|The Entrance Hall]]
The Royal Entrance Hall (''Fejedelmi előterem''), on the first floor of the Krisztinaváros Wing, gave access to the rooms of the Private Royal Apartments of King Franz Joseph I. The private apartments were situated in the southwestern part of the Krisztinaváros wing, their windows opening towards the hills of Buda. The Royal Entrance Hall was connected through a wide passageway to the main staircase hall. The spacious, oblong-shaped hall was divided in three, with two pairs of Ionic marble columns supporting [[architrave]]s. The central part of the room was much longer than the bays at the ends. Doors connected the hall with the rooms of the private apartments. In the middle of the longer wall stood an ornate stone mantelpiece with the bust of Franz Joseph. On the other side, three windows opened to the inner courtyard of the Krisztinaváros wing. The ceiling was stuccoed and the side walls of the hall were covered with marble.

===== Antechamber =====
[[File:Eloterem 58.jpg|thumb|left|Antechamber]]
The antechamber (''Előterem'') of the private apartments opened from the Royal Entrance Hall. It had three windows facing toward the hills. The room had a typical [[Biedermeier]] white-golden stucco decoration with floral wallpapers, resembling to the cosy rooms of [[Schönbrunn Palace]]. All the rooms of the private apartments followed this Viennese style favoured by the King. The antechamber was furnished with a stone mantelpiece (with a mirror above), an [[Empire (style)|Empire]] crystal chandelier, a stone flowerpot standing on a fluted column and Neo-Renaissance table with chairs.

===== Audience Room =====
[[File:Fogadoszoba 59.jpg|thumb|The Audience Room]]
The audience room (''Fogadószoba'') of Franz Joseph I was situated in a corner of the private apartments wing, with two windows opening southwards and three windows opening westwards. It had a beautiful stuccoed and frescoed ceiling. The walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, a golden Rococo console table with a large mirror and a parlour suite.

===== Writing Room =====
[[File:Iroszoba 60.png|thumb|left|Writing room in the royal suite]]
The writing room (''Írószoba'') of Franz Joseph had two windows opening towards the hills of Buda. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, an ornate white tile stove, a table and chairs. To the right and left two similar parlours opened from the room.

===== Royal Bedroom =====
[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, I. Fejedelmi Haloszoba.png|thumb|Bedroom of the king]]
The bedroom (''Fejedelmi hálószoba'') of the king had two windows opening towards the hills of Buda. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, the baldachined royal bed and a [[folding screen]]. The bedroom was connected to a dressing room, a private bathroom and smaller rooms belonging to the butler and the servants.

===== Royal Dining Hall =====
[[File:I. Fejedelmi Ebedlo 57.jpg|thumb|left|The Dining Room]]
The Royal Dining Hall (''Fejedelmi ebédlő'') opened from the Royal Entrance Hall, and it was the largest room of the private apartments. The long hall had six windows opening towards [[Gellért Hill]]. Three crystal chandeliers gave light to the elegant stuccoed space. In the middle of the longer side wall, between the two doors, stood a marble mantelpiece.

===== "Circle" Room =====
[[File:Circle Terem 56.jpg|thumb|The "Circle" Room]]
The "Circle" Room (''"Circle" terem'') opened from the Royal Dining Hall. It was the last room of the private apartments on the southern side, with three windows opening towards Gellért Hill. It had a white-golden stuccoed ceiling and the walls were covered with floral wallpapers. The room was furnished with a crystal chandelier, an ornate white tile stove and chairs.

===== Dining Room =====
[[File:Budapest, Kiralyi Palota, Ebedlo.png|thumb|left|The Dining Room in the royal guest suite]]
The small dining room (''Ebédlő'') was situated in the northern part of the Krisztinaváros wing, among the other rooms of the Royal Guest Suite. Four windows opened towards Krisztinaváros. The ceiling was stuccoed, while the walls were covered with carved wooden panelling and wallpaper. A stone mantelpiece and large painting above it (depicting a hunting scene with a deer) gave a homey feeling to the room. It was furnished with a crystal chandelier and a long dining table with 12 chairs.

==== Archducal Apartments ====
These apartments, on the ground floor of the Krisztinaváros Wing, were designed in 1902 for [[Archduke Joseph August of Austria]] (1872–1962), the head of the Hungarian branch of the Habsburgs and his wife, [[Princess Auguste of Bavaria (1875–1964)|Archduchess Augusta]] (1875–1964). They could be reached from the lobby of the Krisztinaváros wing through a long passageway. The most important rooms were (in due course): the ''salon'', where guests were entertained; the ''great parlour''; ''parlour''; ''dining room''; the ''Archduke's study''; the ''Archduke's bedroom''; the ''Archduchess' bedroom''; the ''Archduchess' study''; and the ''breakfast parlour''. All rooms had a relatively simple decoration with white stuccoed ceilings and stucco panels above the doorways. The walls were covered with wallpaper. Crystal chandeliers, stone mantelpieces and typical turn-of-the-century furniture gave the rooms a homey ambiance. The great parlour was decorated with large paintings.

==Works of art==
The castle and its gardens have been decorated with works of art since their foundation in the 14th century. Only written sources speak about the most important medieval works, but detailed pictorial and written information exists about the 19th-century artistic decoration of the palace, which was mainly created by the most important Hungarian artists of the era. Many of the statues survived the destruction during the siege of Budapest in 1944–45 and were later restored. On the other hand, important works of art were destroyed during the controversial reconstruction of the castle during the 1950s and 1960s.

===Sculptural monuments===
[[File:Mátyás kút.JPG|thumb|Matthias Fountain]]
;Matthias Fountain (''Mátyás kútja'')
The spectacular fountain decorates the western forecourt of the palace. It shows a group of hunters led by King Matthias Corvinus together with hounds, a killed deer, Galeotto Marzio with a hawk and Szép Ilonka with a doe. This group of people stands between fallen rocks with water running down into a basin. The fountain was made by sculptor Alajos Stróbl. The dead deer was modelled upon a majestic stag killed in 1896 by poachers in the forest owned by Stróbl. The damaged sculpture was restored after the war. Nowadays it is probably the most photographed object in the palace.

[[File:Budapest princ Eugen 1.jpg|thumb|left|Monument of Prince Eugene of Savoy]]
;Monument of Prince Eugene of Savoy
The equestrian statue of Prince Eugene of Savoy stands on the Danube terrace, in a prominent position, high above Budapest. The Neo-Baroque statue was made by sculptor [[József Róna]] for the town of [[Senta|Zenta]], but the town could not afford the price. The monument was bought in 1900 as a temporary solution until the planned equestrian statue of King Franz Joseph was completed. This never happened, so Prince Eugen remained on his plinth. The plinth is decorated with two bronze reliefs showing the capture of the earth-works in Zenta and the decisive cavalry charge in the Battle of Zenta in 1697.

[[File:Csikós statue by György Vastagh, Hunyadi Courtyard, Royal Palace. 2009 BudapestDSCN3859.jpg|thumb|Statue of the horseherd]]
;Horseherd (''Csikós'')
The statue of the [[Hortobágy National Park]] horseherd taming a wild horse originally stood in front of the Riding School in the former Újvilág terrace. It is the work of György Vastagh from 1901. The statue was displayed in the [[Exposition Universelle (1900)|Exposition Universelle]] in Paris (1900). The damaged statue was removed during the 1960s, but it was later restored and erected in the western forecourt of the palace in 1983, next to the Matthias Fountain.

[[File:Turul and Hungarian flag.jpg|thumb|left|The mythological [[Turul]] bird]]
;Turulbird (''Turulmadár'')
The mythological Turul, high above the Danube, was made by [[Gyula Donáth]] in 1905. The plinth and the ornate Neo-Baroque rail ([[Gyula Jungfer]]'s work) was seriously damaged during the siege of Buda, but they were restored in 1981, together with the broken coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary on the plinth.

[[File:BudapestDSCN3839.JPG|thumb|''Fishing Children'' by Károly Senyei]]
;Fishing Children
The Fountain of the Fishing Children on the Danube terrace is the work of sculptor Károly Senyei from 1912. It depicts two children grappling with a fish. The fine workmanship of the fishing net is remarkable. The fountain was removed in 1955 and re-erected at Rákóczi Square in Pest, but brought back to its original place in 1976. It was restored in 2001.

;Csongor and Tünde
The two statues depicting Csongor and Tünde, literary figures from [[Mihály Vörösmarty]]'s drama, originally decorated the Habsburg Steps in front of the palace. They are the works of sculptor [[Miklós Ligeti]] from 1903. The steps were demolished after the war, but the statues were saved and re-erected in 1976 on top of two simple concrete plinths near their original locations.

[[File:Várbelső.jpg|thumb|left|One of the lions in the inner courtyard]]
;Lions
Two pairs of lions guard the monumental gate leading into Lions Court. The four statues are the works of János Fadrusz from 1901. The animals standing on the outer side of the gate are calm and dignified, while the inner ones are menacing. One lion was broken in two pieces during the war, but it was recreated in the 1950s.

;War and Peace
The monumental allegorical bronze statues of War and Peace stand beside the entrance to the Budapest History Museum. They are the work of Károly Senyei. Both War and Peace are represented by angels, one with a trumpet, the other with an olive branch. Under the angel of Peace is a returning soldier, while under the angel of War there is a dead Ottoman soldier and ancient Hungarian warriors.

There are sepulchral monuments in the Palatinal Crypt decorated with the statues of [[György Zala (sculptor)|György Zala]], Alajos Stróbl and Károly Senyei.

===Lost works of art===
;Hungaria
The monumental sculpture group decorated the main (northern) façade of the palace, facing Szent György Square. On the top of the attic, crowning the façade, stood the female figure of Hungaria, the allegorical representation of Hungary. Two semi-nude figures sat at her side, one male and one female, representing Industry and Commerce. The group was made by sculptor Gyula Jankovits in 1905. The sculpture was destroyed, together with the whole northern façade, during the 1950s.

;Pediment Group
The pediment above the Habsburg Steps was decorated with an allegorical group of Károly Senyei representing the ''Apotheosis of the Dual Monarchy''. It was destroyed during the 1950s, together with the great coat-of-arms of the Kingdom of Hungary which originally crowned the façade. The present-day pediment is plain, without any sculptural decoration.

;Apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty
The ceiling of the Habsburg Room was decorated with a fresco representing the apotheosis of the Habsburg Dynasty. It was the last important work of Károly Lotz, painted in 1903, one year before his death. The artist was already seriously ill when he worked on the fresco. The "Apotheosis" followed the traditions of Baroque court painting, and the work was praised by contemporary critics. The fresco survived the war unscathed, but it was destroyed in the 1950s.

==Museums and institutions==
{{Main|Hungarian National Gallery|National Széchényi Library}}
[[File:Floor plans of Buda Castle en.svg|thumb|The ground plan of the castle complex, with the location of the museums]]
The Budapest History Museum is located in the southern wing of Buda Castle, in Building E, over four floors. It presents the history of Budapest from its beginnings until the modern era. The restored part of the medieval castle, including the Royal Chapel and the rib-vaulted Gothic Hall, belongs to the exhibition. The highlights of the exhibition are the Gothic statues of Buda Castle and a 14th-century silk tapestry decorated with the [[Capetian House of Anjou|Angevin]] coats of arms. Small gardens were recreated in the medieval zwingers around the oldest parts of the building.

The Hungarian National Gallery is located in Building A, B, C and D. The museum presents the history of Hungarian art from the 11th century until the present, with a special exhibition concentrating on Gothic altarpieces (housed in the former Baroque Ballroom). The only surviving interior from the pre-war Royal Palace, the Palatinal Crypt, belongs to the museum.

"Building F" is occupied by the National Széchényi Library, the national library of Hungary. Its collection of rare and antique books, [[codices]] and manuscripts contains 35 Corvina pieces from the famous library of King Matthias Corvinus. The original Bibliotheca Corviniana was housed in the medieval Royal Castle of Buda.

== The cellars and caves ==
During the ottoman era, the extensive cave system was utilized by the hunters to store tigers and Hungarian mountain bears. 

The cellars stored an ornate wine collection from the Ergi wine growing region in the Northern frontier of Hungary.

'''''Children of Men''''' is a 2006 British-American [[dystopian]] [[thriller film]] directed and co-written by [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. The screenplay, based on [[P. D. James]]' 1992 novel ''[[The Children of Men]]'', was credited to five writers, with [[Clive Owen]] making uncredited contributions. The film takes place in 2027, where two decades of human [[infertility]] have left society on the brink of collapse. [[Illegal immigrant]]s seek sanctuary in the United Kingdom, where the last functioning government imposes oppressive immigration laws on [[refugee]]s. Owen plays civil servant Theo Faron, who must help a refugee ([[Clare-Hope Ashitey]]) escape the chaos. ''Children of Men'' also stars [[Julianne Moore]], [[Michael Caine]], [[Chiwetel Ejiofor]], [[Pam Ferris]] and [[Charlie Hunnam]].

The film was released on 22 September 2006 in the UK and on 25 December in the U.S. Critics noted the relationship between the U.S. Christmas opening and the film's themes of hope, redemption, and faith. Despite the limited release and low earnings at the box office compared to its budget, ''Children of Men'' received critical acclaim and was recognised for its achievements in screenwriting, cinematography, art direction, and innovative [[Long take|single-shot]] action sequences. It was nominated for three [[79th Academy Awards|Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Adapted Screenplay|Best Adapted Screenplay]], [[Academy Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[Academy Award for Best Film Editing|Best Film Editing]]. It was also nominated for three [[60th British Academy Film Awards|BAFTA Awards]], winning [[BAFTA Award for Best Cinematography|Best Cinematography]] and [[BAFTA Award for Best Production Design|Best Production Design]], and for three [[Saturn Awards]], winning [[Saturn Award for Best Science Fiction Film|Best Science Fiction Film]]. In 2016 it was voted 13th among 100 films considered the [[BBC's 100 Greatest Films of the 21st Century|best of the 21st century]] by 117 film critics from around the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20160819-the-21st-centurys-100-greatest-films|title=The 21st Century’s 100 greatest films|date=August 23, 2016|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
In 2027, after 18 years of global human infertility and depression, the world is on the brink as humanity faces extinction.  The [[United Kingdom]], one of the very few stable nations with a functioning government, is deluged by asylum seekers fleeing the radiation and [[antibiotic-resistant]] plagues which have rendered the rest of the world uninhabitable. In response, the UK has become a [[police state]] as the [[British Army]] rounds up and exterminates immigrants. Theo Faron, a former activist turned cynical bureaucrat, is kidnapped by the "Fishes", a militant immigrants' rights group. They are led by Theo's estranged wife, Julian Taylor, from whom he separated after their son Dylan's death during a 2008 flu pandemic.

Julian offers Theo money to acquire transit papers for a young refugee named Kee. Theo later obtains the papers from his cousin Nigel, a government minister who runs a state-sponsored collection of salvaged art from around the world. Since the transit papers require that the bearer be accompanied, Theo agrees to escort Kee in exchange for a large sum. Luke, a Fishes member, drives Theo, Kee, and former [[midwife]] Miriam towards [[Canterbury]]. While en route, they are ambushed by an armed gang, and Julian is killed. When the group is stopped by the police, Luke kills the officers and then the group hides Julian's body in the forest before heading to a Fishes safe house.

Kee reveals to Theo that she is pregnant and that Julian had told her to trust only Theo. Julian had intended to hand Kee to the "Human Project," a supposed scientific group in the [[Azores]], dedicated to curing infertility. However, Luke persuades Kee to stay and is voted as the new leader of the Fishes. Later that night, Theo eavesdrops on a discussion and learns that Julian's death was orchestrated by the Fishes so Luke could become leader; they intend to kill Theo and use the baby as a political tool to support the coming revolution. Theo wakes Kee and Miriam, and they steal a car, escaping to the secluded hideaway of Theo's ageing friend Jasper Palmer, a former political cartoonist turned pot dealer.

The group makes plans to board the Human Project ship, the ''Tomorrow'', which will arrive offshore from a refugee camp at [[Bexhill-on-Sea]]. Jasper proposes getting Syd, a camp guard to whom he frequently sells drugs, to smuggle them into Bexhill, masquerading as refugees. When the Fishes discover Jasper's house, the group flees while Jasper stays behind to stall the Fishes; Luke shoots and kills Jasper as Theo watches from the woods. The group meets Syd at an abandoned school, and he helps them board a bus to Bexhill. When Kee experiences [[uterine contraction|contractions]] while at a checkpoint, Miriam distracts a suspicious guard by feigning [[mania]] and is taken away.

Inside the camp, Theo and Kee meet a [[Romanians|Romanian]] woman, Marichka, who provides a room where Kee gives birth to a baby girl. The next day, Syd informs Theo and Kee that war has broken out between the British Army and the refugees—led by the Fishes. Having learned that they have a bounty on their heads, Syd attempts to capture them, but Theo kills him with a car battery and they escape. Amidst the fighting, the Fishes capture Kee and the baby. Theo tracks them to an apartment building under heavy fire; he confronts Luke, who is then killed in an explosion, and escorts Kee and the baby out. Awed by the baby, the combatants temporarily stop fighting and allow the trio to leave. Marichka leads them to a hidden boat, but chooses to stay behind as they depart.

As military aircraft bomb Bexhill from a distance, Theo reveals that he had been shot by Luke. He tells Kee how to wind/burp her baby to soothe her crying, and Kee tells Theo she will name her Dylan—after Theo and Julian's lost son. Theo loses consciousness as the ''Tomorrow'' approaches through the fog.

D. James]]' novel ''[[The Children of Men]]'' (1992), describes what happens when society is unable to reproduce, using male infertility to explain this problem.&lt;ref name="Independent1"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/p-d-james-you-ask-the-questions-687268.html |title=You ask the questions: P.

James writes, "It was reasonable to struggle, to suffer, perhaps even to die, for a more just, a more compassionate society, but not in a world with no future where, all too soon, the very words 'justice,' 'compassion,' 'society,’ 'struggle,' 'evil,' would be unheard echoes on an empty air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bowman |first=James |title=Our Childless Dystopia |journal=[[The New Atlantis (journal)|The New Atlantis]] |issue=15 |pages=107–110 |year=2007 |url=http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/15/bowman.htm |accessdate=25 May 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070526121608/http://www.thenewatlantis.com/archive/15/bowman.htm |archivedate=26 May 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film switches the infertility from male to female&lt;ref name="HollywoodElsewhere" /&gt; but never explains its cause: environmental destruction and divine punishment are considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Bob |last=Ross |title=Hope is as scarce as ''Children'' in Dystopian Sci-Fi Thriller |work=[[Tampa Tribune]] |date=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; This unanswered question (and others in the film) have been attributed to Cuarón's dislike for expository film: "There's a kind of cinema I detest, which is a cinema that is about exposition and explanations&amp;nbsp;... It's become now what I call a medium for lazy readers&amp;nbsp;... Cinema is a hostage of narrative.

So if you're a hopeful person you'll see a lot of hope, and if you're a bleak person you'll see a complete hopelessness at the end."&lt;ref name="Filmmaker"&gt;{{cite web |first=Jason |last=Guerrasio |url=http://www.filmmakermagazine.com/archives/online_features/hopeless_future.php |title=A New Humanity |work=[[Filmmaker Magazine]] |date=22 December 2006 |accessdate=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
Like [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'', [[Dante Alighieri|Dante]]'s ''[[The Divine Comedy|Divine Comedy]]'', and [[Geoffrey Chaucer|Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales|Canterbury Tales]]'', the crux of the journey in ''Children of Men'' lies in what is uncovered along the path rather than the terminus itself.&lt;ref name="America" /&gt;  Theo's [[hero's journey (phrase)|heroic journey]] to the south coast mirrors his personal quest for "self-awareness",&lt;ref name="FJI" /&gt; a journey that takes him from "despair to hope".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Robert W. |last=Butler |title=Sci-fi movie paints grim future |work=[[Kansas City Star]] |date=5 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Cuarón, the title of P. D. James' book (''The Children of Men'') is a Catholic allegory derived from a [[Psalm 90|passage of scripture]] in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Richard |last=von Busack |url=http://metroactive.com/metro/01.10.07/alfonso-cuaron-0702.html |title=Making the Future: Richard von Busack talks to Alfonso Cuarón about filming ''Children of Men'' |work=[[Metro Silicon Valley|Metroactive]] |date=10 January 2007 |accessdate=23 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Psalm 90|Psalm 90 (89):3]] of the [[King James Version of the Bible|KJV]]: "Thou turnest man to destruction; and sayest, Return, ye children of men.")  James refers to her story as a "Christian fable"&lt;ref name="Independent1" /&gt; while Cuarón describes it as "almost like a look at Christianity": "I didn't want to shy away from the spiritual archetypes," Cuarón told ''Filmmaker Magazine''.  "But I wasn't interested in dealing with [[dogma]]."&lt;ref name="Filmmaker" /&gt;
{{Rquote|right|Ms. James's nativity story is, in Mr. Cuarón's version, set against the image of a prisoner in an orange smock with a black bag on his head, arms stretched out as if on a cross.|[[Manohla Dargis]]|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Dargis |first=Manohla |authorlink=Manohla Dargis |series=Awards Season |title=Beauty and Beasts of England, in a World on Its Last Legs |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=7 January 2007 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/07/movies/awardsseason/07darg.html |accessdate=2008-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} This divergence from the original was criticised by some, including Anthony Sacramone of ''[[First Things]]'', who called the film "an act of vandalism", noting the irony of how Cuarón had removed religion from P.D. James' fable, in which morally sterile [[nihilism]] is overcome by [[Christianity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Anthony Sacramone |url=http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/2008/11/sacramone-children-of-men |title=Children of Men |work=[[First Things]] |date=8 November 2008 |accessdate=20 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has been noted for its use of [[Christian symbolism]]; for example, British terrorists named "[[Ichthys|Fishes]]" protect the rights of refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeff |last=Simon |title=Life Force: Who carries the torch of hope when the world is without children? |work=[[The Buffalo News]] |date=4 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opening on [[Christmas Day]] in the United States, critics compared the characters of Theo and Kee with Joseph and Mary,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title= Children of Men |magazine=[[People (magazine)|People]] |date=8 January 2007 |volume=67 |issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; calling the film a "modern-day [[Nativity story]]".&lt;ref name="Slate"&gt;{{cite news|first=Dana |last=Stevens |url=http://www.slate.com/id/2155950 |title=The Movie of the Millennium |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |date=21 December 2006 |accessdate=15 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kee's pregnancy is revealed to Theo in a barn, alluding to the manger of the [[Nativity scene]], when Theo asks Kee who the father of the baby is she jokingly states she is a virgin, and when other characters discover Kee and her baby, they respond with "Jesus Christ" or the [[sign of the cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Richstatter |first=Katje |date=Mar–Apr 2007 |title=Two Dystopian Movies...and their Visions of Hope |magazine=[[Tikkun (magazine)|Tikkun]] |volume=22 |issue=2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Also the [[Archangel Gabriel]] (among other religious figures) is invoked in the bus scene.

To highlight these spiritual themes, Cuarón commissioned a 15-minute piece by British composer [[John Tavener]], a member of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] whose work resonates with the themes of "motherhood, birth, rebirth, and redemption in the eyes of God."  Calling his score a "musical and spiritual reaction to Alfonso's film", snippets of Tavener's "Fragments of a Prayer" contain lyrics in Latin, German and Sanskrit sung by mezzo-soprano, [[Sarah Connolly]]. Words like "mata" (mother), "pahi mam" (protect me), "avatara" (saviour), and "alleluia" appear throughout the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Broxton |first=Jonathan |title=Children of Men |publisher=Movie Music UK |url= http://www.moviemusicuk.us/childrenofmencd.htm |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=5 February 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070228105041/http://www.moviemusicuk.us/childrenofmencd.htm |archivedate = 28 February 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kevin |last=Crust |title=Unconventional soundscape in ''Children of Men'' |work=[[Chicago Tribune]] |url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2007-01-17/features/0701160308_1_refugee-camp-jasper-immigrants |date=17 January 2007 |accessdate=26 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[closing credits]], the [[Sanskrit]] words "Shantih Shantih Shantih" appear as end titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=LaCara |first=Len |title=Cruelest of months leaves more families grieving |work=[[Coshocton Tribune]] |date=22 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Lowman |first=Rob |title=Cuaron vs. the world |work=[[Los Angeles Daily News]] |date=27 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer and [[film critic]] Laura Eldred of the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] observes that ''Children of Men'' is "full of tidbits that call out to the educated viewer". During a visit to his house by Theo and Kee, Jasper says "Shanti, shanti, shanti." Eldred notes that the "shanti" used in the film is also found at the end of an [[Upanishad]] and in the final line of [[T. S. Eliot]]'s poem ''[[The Waste Land]]'', a work Eldred describes as "devoted to contemplating a world emptied of fertility: a world on its last, teetering legs". "Shanti" is also a common beginning and ending to all Hindu prayers, and means "peace," referencing the invocation of divine intervention and rebirth through an end to violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew |last=Kozma |author2=Eldred, Laura |url=http://www.revolutionsf.com/article.php?id=3444 |title=Children of Men: Review |publisher=RevolutionSF |date=16 January 2007 |accessdate=8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contemporary references==
''Children of Men'' takes an unconventional approach to the modern [[action film]], using a documentary, newsreel style.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Rowin |first=Michael Joshua |date=Spring 2007 |title=Children of Men |magazine=[[Cineaste (magazine)|Cineaste]] |volume=32 |issue=2 |url=http://www.cineaste.com/articles/review-children-of-men.htm |pages=60–61 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928175957/http://www.cineaste.com/articles/review-children-of-men.htm |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Film critics Michael Rowin, Jason Guerrasio and Ethan Alter observe the film's underlying touchstone of [[immigration]]. Alter notes that the film "makes a potent case against the [[Opposition to immigration|anti-immigrant sentiment]]" prevalent in modern societies like the United Kingdom and the United States, with Guerrasio describing the film as "a complex meditation on the politics of today".&lt;ref name="Filmmaker" /&gt;&lt;ref name="FJI"&gt;{{cite news|first=Ethan |last=Alter |url= http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/reviews/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003522882 |title= Reviews: Children of Men |work=[[Film Journal International]] |accessdate= 28 January 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071008193044/http://www.filmjournal.com/filmjournal/reviews/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003522882 |archivedate = 8 October 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Alter and other critics, the structural support and impetus for the contemporary references rests upon the visual nature of the film's [[exposition (plot device)|exposition]], occurring in the form of imagery as opposed to conventional dialogue.&lt;ref name="FJI" /&gt;  Visually, the [[refugee camp]]s in the film intentionally evoke [[Abu Ghraib prison]], [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp]], and [[Maze (HM Prison)|The Maze]].&lt;ref name="Tomatoes1" /&gt; Other popular images appear, such as a sign over the refugee camp reading "Homeland Security".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Ray |last=Bennett |url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003086948 |title=Children of Men |work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] |date=4 September 2006 |accessdate=29 January 2007 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070120211523/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/search/article_display.jsp?vnu_content_id=1003086948 |archivedate = 20 January 2007 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The similarity between the hellish, [[cinéma vérité]] stylized battle scenes of the film and current news and documentary coverage of the [[Iraq War]], is noted by film critic [[Manohla Dargis]], describing Cuarón's fictional landscapes as "war zones of extraordinary plausibility".&lt;ref name="NYT1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Manohla |last=Dargis |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/2006/12/25/movies/25chil.html |title=Apocalypse Now, but in the Wasteland a Child Is Given |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=25 December 2006 |accessdate=30 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the film, refugees are "hunted down like cockroaches", rounded up and put into roofless cages open to the elements and camps, and even shot, leading film critics like Chris Smith and Claudia Puig to observe symbolic "overtones" and images of the [[Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="USATODAY" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Smith |url=http://bangordailynews.com/news/templates/?a=144701&amp;z=518 |title=''Children of Men'' a dark film, and one of 2006's best |work=[[Bangor Daily News]] |date=1 January 2007 |accessdate=29 January 2007}} {{dead link|date=June 2010| bot=DASHBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This is reinforced in the scene where an elderly refugee woman speaking German is seen detained in a cage,&lt;ref name="FilmComment"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Romney |first=Jonathan |year=January–February 2007 |title=Green and Pleasant Land |magazine=[[Film Comment]] |pages=32–35}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the scene where British Homeland Security strips and beats illegal immigrants; a song by [[The Libertines]], "[[Arbeit macht frei]]", plays in the background.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Zachary |last=Herrmann |url=http://media.www.diamondbackonline.com/media/storage/paper873/news/2006/12/14/Diversions/Championing.The.Children-2551628.shtml?sourcedomain=www.diamondbackonline.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com |title=Championing the Children |work=[[The Diamondback]] |date=14 December 2006 |accessdate=4 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928060231/http://media.www.diamondbackonline.com/media/storage/paper873/news/2006/12/14/Diversions/Championing.The.Children-2551628.shtml?sourcedomain=www.diamondbackonline.com&amp;MIIHost=media.collegepublisher.com |archivedate=28 September 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;  "The visual allusions to the Nazi round-ups are unnerving," writes Richard A. Blake.  "It shows what people can become when the government orchestrates their fears for its own advantage."&lt;ref name="America"&gt;{{cite web |first=Richard A. |last=Blake |url=http://americamagazine.org/issue/601/film-review/what-if|title=What If...? |publisher=[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]] |date=5 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuarón explains how he uses his imagery to cross-reference fictional and futuristic events with real, contemporary, or historical incidents and beliefs:

{{quote|They exit the Russian apartments, and the next shot you see is this woman wailing, holding the body of her son in her arms. This was a reference to a real photograph of a woman holding the body of her son in the Balkans, crying with the corpse of her son. It's very obvious that when the photographer captured that photograph, he was referencing [[Pietà (Michelangelo)|La Pietà]], the Michelangelo sculpture of Mary holding the corpse of Jesus. So: We have a reference to something that really happened, in the Balkans, which is itself a reference to the Michelangelo sculpture. At the same time, we use the sculpture of [[David (Michelangelo)|David]] early on, which is also by Michelangelo, and we have of course the whole reference to the [[Nativity of Jesus|Nativity]]. And so everything was referencing and cross-referencing, as much as we could.&lt;ref name="Cinematical" /&gt;}}

==Production==
The adaptation of the [[P. D. James]] novel was originally written by [[Paul Chart]], and later rewritten by [[Mark Fergus and Hawk Ostby]]. The studio brought director [[Alfonso Cuarón]] on board in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Michael |last=Fleming |title=Helmer Raises ''Children'' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Daily Variety]] |date=5 October 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Cuarón and screenwriter Timothy J. Sexton began rewriting the script after the director completed ''[[Y tu mamá también]]''. Afraid he would "start second guessing things",&lt;ref name="Moviehole" /&gt; Cuarón chose not to read P. D. James' novel, opting to have Sexton read the book while Cuarón himself read an abridged version.&lt;ref name="Cinematical" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Filmmaker" /&gt; Cuarón did not immediately begin production, instead directing ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. During this period, David Arata rewrote the screenplay and delivered the draft which secured [[Clive Owen]] and sent the film into [[pre-production]]. The director's work experience in the United Kingdom exposed him to the "social dynamics of the British psyche", giving him insight into the depiction of "British reality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Edward |last=Douglas |url= http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=17831 |title=Exclusive: Filmmaker Alfonso Cuarón |publisher=[[ComingSoon.net]] |date=8 December 2006 |accessdate=8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cuarón used the film ''[[The Battle of Algiers (film)|The Battle of Algiers]]'' as a model for social reconstruction in preparation for production, presenting the film to Clive Owen as an example of his vision for ''Children of Men''.  In order to create a philosophical and social framework for the film, the director read literature by [[Slavoj Žižek]], as well as similar works.&lt;ref name="time out"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeout.com/film/news/1418.html |title=''Children of Men'' feature |work=[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out]] |date=21 September 2006 |accessdate=8 February 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070216220635/http://www.timeout.com/film/news/1418.html |archivedate=16 February 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The film ''[[Sunrise (film)|Sunrise]]'' was also influential.&lt;ref name="HollywoodElsewhere" /&gt;

===Location===
''[[A Clockwork Orange (film)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' was one of the inspirations for the futuristic, yet battered patina of 2027 London.&lt;ref name="HollywoodElsewhere" /&gt; ''Children of Men'' was the second film Cuarón made in London, with the director portraying the city using single, wide shots.&lt;ref name="Variety_Nightmare"&gt;{{cite news|first=Leo |last=Barraclough |title=Nightmare on the Thames |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=18 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; While Cuarón was preparing the film, the [[7 July 2005 London bombings|London bombings]] occurred, but the director never considered moving the production. "It would have been impossible to shoot anywhere but London, because of the very obvious way the locations were incorporated into the film," Cuarón told ''Variety''. "For example, the shot of [[Fleet Street]] looking towards St. Paul's would have been impossible to shoot anywhere else."&lt;ref name="Variety_Nightmare" /&gt; Due to these circumstances, the opening terrorist attack scene on Fleet Street was shot a month and a half after the London bombing.&lt;ref name="time out" /&gt;

Cuarón chose to shoot some scenes in [[East London]], a location he considered "a place without glamour". The set locations were dressed to make them appear even more run-down; Cuarón says he told the crew "'Let's make it more Mexican'.

===Single-shot sequences===
''Children of Men'' used several lengthy [[Long take|single-shot sequences]] in which extremely complex actions take place. The longest of these are a shot in which Kee gives birth (199 seconds; 3:19); an ambush on a country road (247 seconds; 4:07); and a scene in which Theo is captured by the Fishes, escapes, and runs down a street and through a building in the middle of a raging battle (378 seconds; 6:18).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Miller|first=Neil|title=Scenes We Love: Explore Alfonso Cuaron's Addiction to Single Takes in 'Children of Men'|url=http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/scenes-we-love-explore-alfonso-cuarons-addiction-to-single-takes-in-children-of-men.php|publisher=[[Film School Rejects]]|accessdate=14 April 2014|date=29 April 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415083501/http://filmschoolrejects.com/features/scenes-we-love-explore-alfonso-cuarons-addiction-to-single-takes-in-children-of-men.php|archivedate=15 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; These sequences were extremely difficult to film, although the effect of continuity is sometimes an illusion, aided by [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]] effects.&lt;ref name="VFX"&gt;{{cite web |title=Framestore CFC Delivers Children of Men |last=|first= |date=16 October 2006 |accessdate=8 February 2007 |url=http://www.vfxworld.com/?sa=adv&amp;code=3631a5a1&amp;atype=news&amp;id=18187 |work=VFXWorld Magazine }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuarón had experimented with long takes in ''[[Great Expectations (1998 film)|Great Expectations]]'', ''[[Y tu mamá también]]'', and ''[[Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban (film)|Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban]]''. His style is influenced by the Swiss film ''[[Jonah Who Will Be 25 in the Year 2000]]'', a favorite of Cuarón's. Cuarón said "I was studying cinema when I first saw [''Jonah''], and interested in the [[French New Wave]]. ''Jonah'' was so unflashy compared to those films. The camera keeps a certain distance and there are relatively few close-ups. It's elegant and flowing, constantly tracking, but very slowly and not calling attention to itself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2006/09/30/bffmof30.xml&amp;menuId=564&amp;sSheet=/arts/2006/09/30/ixfilmmain.html |title=Film-makers on film: Alfonso Cuarón |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=30 September 2006 |accessdate=8 February 2007 | first=Sheila | last=Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The creation of the single-shot sequences was a challenging, time-consuming process that sparked concerns from the studio. It took fourteen days to prepare for the single shot in which Clive Owen's character searches a building under attack, and five hours for every time they wanted to reshoot it. In the middle of one shot, blood splattered onto the lens, and cinematographer [[Emmanuel Lubezki]] convinced the director to leave it in. According to Owen, "Right in the thick of it are me and the camera operator because we're doing this very complicated, very specific dance which, when we come to shoot, we have to make feel completely random."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Claire |last=Sutherland |url=http://www.news.com.au/sundayheraldsun/story/0,,20603665-5006023,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120907065329/http://www.news.com.au/sundayheraldsun/story/0,,20603665-5006023,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 September 2012 |title=Clive's happy with career |work=[[Herald Sun]] |date=19 October 2006 |accessdate=8 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cuarón's initial idea for maintaining [[Continuity (fiction)|continuity]] during the roadside ambush scene was dismissed by production experts as an "impossible shot to do". Fresh from the visual effects-laden ''Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban'', Cuarón suggested using computer-generated imagery to film the scene. Lubezki refused to allow it, reminding the director that they had intended to make a film akin to a "raw [[Documentary film|documentary]]". Instead, a special camera rig invented by [[Gary Thieltges]] of Doggicam Systems was employed, allowing Cuarón to develop the scene as one extended shot.&lt;ref name="ChicagoTribune" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.doggicam.com/twoaxisdolly.php |title=Two Axis Dolly |publisher=Doggicam Systems |accessdate=24 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A vehicle was modified to enable seats to tilt and lower actors out of the way of the camera, and the windshield was designed to tilt out of the way to allow camera movement in and out through the front windscreen. A crew of four, including the director of photography and camera operator, rode on the roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=mseymour7 |url=http://www.fxguide.com/article390.html |title=''Children of Men'' – Hard Core Seamless vfx |publisher=fxguide |date=4 January 2007 |accessdate=6 November 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011200509/http://www.fxguide.com/article390.html |archivedate=11 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the commonly reported statement that the action scenes are continuous shots&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steve |last=Murray |url=http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/content/movies/stories/2006/12/28/1229MMscene.html |title=Anatomy of a Scene |work=[[The Atlanta Journal-Constitution]] |date=29 December 2006 |accessdate=24 January 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070122042320/http://www.accessatlanta.com/movies/content/movies/stories/2006/12/28/1229MMscene.html |archivedate=22 January 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; is not entirely true. Visual effects supervisor Frazer Churchill explains that the effects team had to "combine several takes to create impossibly long shots", where their job was to "create the illusion of a continuous camera move." Once the team was able to create a "seamless blend", they would move on to the next shot. These techniques were important for three continuous shots: the coffee shop explosion in the opening shot, the car ambush, and the battlefield scene. The coffee shop scene was composed of "two different takes shot over two consecutive days"; the car ambush was shot in "six sections and at four different locations over one week and required five seamless digital transitions"; and the battlefield scene "was captured in five separate takes over two locations". Churchill and the [[Double Negative (VFX)|Double Negative]] team created over 160 of these types of effects for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alain |last=Bielik |title=Children of Men: Invisible VFX for a Future in Decay |url=http://vfxworld.com/?atype=articles&amp;id=3127 |work=VFXWorld Magazine |date=27 December 2006 |accessdate=24 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview with ''Variety'', Cuarón acknowledged this nature of the "single-shot" action sequences: "Maybe I'm spilling a big secret, but sometimes it's more than what it looks like. The important thing is how you blend everything and how you keep the perception of a fluid choreography through all of these different pieces."&lt;ref name="Debruge" /&gt;

Tim Webber of VFX house [[Framestore CFC]] was responsible for the three-and-a-half-minute single take of Kee giving birth, helping to choreograph and create the CG effects of the childbirth.&lt;ref name="Variety_Nightmare" /&gt; Cuarón had originally intended to use an [[animatronic]] baby as Kee's child with the exception of the childbirth scene. In the end, two takes were shot, with the second take concealing Clare-Hope Ashitey's legs, replacing them with prosthetic legs. Cuarón was pleased with the results of the effect, and returned to previous shots of the baby in animatronic form, replacing them with Framestore's [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] baby.&lt;ref name="VFX" /&gt;

===Sound===
{{see also|Children of Men (soundtracks)}}
Cuarón uses sound and music to bring the fictional world of social unrest and infertility to life.&lt;ref name="LATimes"&gt;{{cite news|last=Crust |first=Kevin |title=Critic's Notebook; Sounds to match to the ''Children of Men'' vision |page=E–24 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/2007/jan/07/entertainment/ca-crust7 |work=[[Los Angeles Times]] |date=7 January 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A creative yet restrained combination of rock, pop, electronic music, hip-hop and classical music replaces the typical [[film score]].&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt; The mundane sounds of traffic, barking dogs, and advertisements follow the character of Theo through London, East Sussex and Kent, producing what ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' writer Kevin Crust calls an "urban audio rumble".&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;  For Crust, the music comments indirectly on the barren world of ''Children of Men'': [[Deep Purple]]'s version of "[[Hush (Billy Joe Royal song)|Hush]]" blaring from Jasper's car radio becomes a "sly lullaby for a world without babies" while [[King Crimson]]'s "[[The Court of the Crimson King]]" make a similar allusion with their lyrics, "three lullabies in an ancient tongue".&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;

Amongst a genre-spanning selection of [[electronic music]], a remix of [[Aphex Twin]]'s "Omgyjya Switch 7", which includes the 'Male Thijs Loud Scream' audio sample by Thanvannispen,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://soundcloud.com/linus-carl-norl-n/9432-thanvannispen-male-thijs |title=9432 thanvannispen male-thijs-loud-scream by Linus Carl Norlen |publisher= Soundcloud.com |accessdate=21 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; not present on the original (nor indeed on the official soundtrack) can be heard during the scene in Jasper's house, where Jasper's "Strawberry Cough" (a potent, strawberry-flavoured strain of [[marijuana]]) is being sampled. During a conversation between the two men, [[Radiohead]]'s "[[Life in a Glasshouse]]" plays in the background.

A number of [[dubstep]] tracks, most notably ''Anti-War Dub'' by [[Digital Mystikz]], as well as tracks by [[Kode9]] &amp; The Space Ape and [[Kevin Martin (British musician)|Pressure]] are also featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Reasons to Be Cheerful (Just Three) |magazine=[[The Village Voice]] |first=Simon |last=Reynolds |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/pazzandjop06/0706,reynolds,75737,22.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070622075548/http://www.villagevoice.com/pazzandjop06/0706%2Creynolds%2C75737%2C22.html |archivedate=22 June 2007 |accessdate=18 July 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the Bexhill scenes during the film's second half, the director makes use of silence and cacophonous [[sound effect]]s such as the firing of automatic weapons and loudspeakers directing the movement of "fugees" (illegal immigrants).&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt; Here, classical music by [[George Frideric Handel]], [[Gustav Mahler]], and [[Krzysztof Penderecki]]'s "[[Threnody to the Victims of Hiroshima]]" complements the chaos of the refugee camp.&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt; Throughout the film, [[John Tavener]]'s ''Fragments of a Prayer'' is used as a spiritual motif to explain and interpret the story without the use of narrative.&lt;ref name="LATimes" /&gt;

A few times during the film, a loud, ringing tone evocative of [[tinnitus]] is heard. This sound generally coincides with the death of a major character (Julian, Jasper) and is referred to by Julian herself, who describes the tones as the last time you'll ever hear that frequency. In this way, then, the loss of the tones is symbolic of the loss of the characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.filmint.nu/?q=node/87 |title="Children of Men": The Repetition of the Ringing |publisher= Filmint.nu |accessdate=13 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical reception===
''Children of Men'' received critical acclaim; on the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], the film received a 92% approval rating based on 238 reviews from critics, with an average rating of 8/10. The site's critical consensus states: "''Children of Men'' works on every level: as a violent chase thriller, a fantastical cautionary tale, and a sophisticated human drama about societies struggling to live."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/children_of_men/ |title=Children of Men (2006) |publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |accessdate=14 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score of 84 out of 100, based on 38 reviews, indicating "universal acclaim".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/film/titles/childrenofmen |title=Children of Men (2006): Reviews |publisher=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate= 8 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dana Stevens (critic)|Dana Stevens]] of ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' called it "the herald of another blessed event: the arrival of a great director by the name of Alfonso Cuarón." Stevens hailed the film's extended car chase and battle scenes as "two of the most virtuoso single-shot chase sequences I've ever seen."&lt;ref name="Slate" /&gt; [[Manohla Dargis]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' called the film a "superbly directed political thriller", raining accolades on the long chase scenes.&lt;ref name="NYT1" /&gt; "Easily one of the best films of the year" said Ethan Alter of ''Film Journal International'', with scenes that  "dazzle you with their technical complexity and visual virtuosity."&lt;ref name="FJI" /&gt; Jonathan Romney of ''[[The Independent]]'' praised the accuracy of Cuarón's portrait of the United Kingdom, but he criticized some of the film's futuristic scenes as "run-of-the-mill future fantasy."&lt;ref name="FilmComment" /&gt; ''[[Film Comment]]'s'' critics' poll of the best films of 2006 ranked the film number 19, while the 2006 readers' poll ranked it number two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=March–April 2007 |title=Readers' Poll |magazine=[[Film Comment]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; On their list of the best movies of 2006, ''[[The A.V.

According to Metacritic's analysis of the most often and notably noted films on the best-of-the-decade lists, ''Children of Men'' is considered the 11th greatest film of the 2000s.

In the wake of the [[European migrant crisis]] of 2015, the [[Brexit|British withdrawal from the European Union]] of the late mid-to-late 2010s, and the [[United States presidential election, 2016|election of Donald Trump in 2016]], all of which involved divisive debates about immigration and increasing border enforcement, several commentators reappraised the film's importance, with some calling it "prescient".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barber|first1=Nicholas|title=Why Children of Men has never been as shocking as it is now|url=http://www.bbc.com/culture/story/20161215-why-children-of-men-has-never-been-as-shocking-as-it-is-now|website=BBC Culture|accessdate=20 Jan 2018|date=15 Dec 2016|quote=Today, it’s hard to watch the television news headlines in Children of Men without gasping at their prescience:}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rodriguez-Cuervo|first1=Ana Yamel|title=Are We Living in the Dawning of Alfonso Cuarón's CHILDREN OF MEN?|url=https://tribecafilm.com/stories/children-of-men-movie-alfonso-cuaron-immigration-issues|website=TribecaFilm|accessdate=20 Jan 2018|date=30 Nov 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Newton|first1=Mark|title='Children Of Men' 10 Year Anniversary: Why Cuarón's Dystopian Masterpiece Is Even More Relevant Today|url=https://moviepilot.com/p/children-of-men-2016-still-relevent/4173074|website=Movie Pilot|accessdate=20 Jan 2018|date=22 Dec 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riesman|first1=Abraham|title=Why 'Children of Men' is the most relevant film of 2017|url=https://www.sbs.com.au/movies/article/2017/11/27/why-children-men-most-relevant-film-2017|website=SBS|accessdate=20 Jan 2018|date=29 Nov 2017|quote=[...] the 55-year-old director gets a little irritated when I laud the film’s imaginative prescience.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Novak|first1=Matt|title=The Syrian Refugee Crisis Is Our Children of Men Moment|url=https://paleofuture.gizmodo.com/the-syrian-refugee-crisis-is-our-children-of-men-moment-1728761526|website=Paleofuture|accessdate=20 Jan 2018|date=9 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, director [[Marc Webb]] included the film on his list of Top 10 Greatest Films when asked by ''[[Sight &amp; Sound]]'' for his votes for the [[BFI The Top 50 Greatest Films of All Time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Marc Webb| url= http://explore.bfi.org.uk/sightandsoundpolls/2012/voter/1052 | work= [[Sight &amp; Sound]] Greatest Films Poll| year=2012| publisher= [[British Film Institute]] | accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2015, the film was named number one on an all-time Top 10 Movies list by the blog ''Pop Culture Philosopher''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Top 10 Movies: #1 – Children of Men|author=Sunami, Chris|work=The Pop Culture Philosopher| url=http://popculturephilosopher.com/top-ten-movies-children-of-men/|date=7 May 2015|accessdate=24 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 2017 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' magazine ranked ''Children of Men'' as the best [[Sci-fi]] film of the 21st century.

===Accolades===
[[P. D. James]] was reported to be pleased with the film,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=IWJBlog |url=http://www.internetwritingjournal.com/cgi-bin/iwjblog.pl?id=108071 |title=P.D. James Pleased With Film Version of Children of Men |date=9 January 2007 |accessdate=7 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the screenwriters of ''Children of Men'' were awarded the 19th annual [[USC Scripter Award 2006|USC Scripter Award]] for the screen adaptation of the novel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/awards_festivals/news/e3i92e281f2c3f748bef245fa46b2804a0a|title=Scripter goes to ''Children of Men''|last=Kit|first=Boris|date=13 January 2007|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|accessdate=2 December 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070915080946/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/awards_festivals/news/e3i92e281f2c3f748bef245fa46b2804a0a|archivedate=15 September 2007|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Howard A. Rodman]], chair of the USC School of Cinematic Arts Writing Division, described the book-to-screen adaptation as "writing and screen writing of the highest order", although Gerschatt, writing in ''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'', noted that the screenplay bore very little resemblance to the novel: The gender of the baby was changed (to female), as was the character who was pregnant (Julian, in the novel); Theo, who appears to die in the film, does not die in the novel.

[[File:De vulgari eloquentia.tif|thumb|''De vulgari eloquentia'', 1577]]
'''''De vulgari eloquentia''''' ({{IPA-la|de vulˈɡari eloˈkwentsi.a|church}}, {{IPA-la|deː wʊɫˈɡaːriː eːɫɔˈkᶣɛnti.aː|classical}}; {{IPA-it|de vulˈɡaːri eloˈkwɛntsja|lang}}; "On eloquence in the [[vernacular]]") is the title of a [[Latin]] essay by [[Dante Alighieri]]. Although meant to consist of four books, its writing was abandoned in the middle of the second book. It was probably composed shortly after Dante went into exile; internal evidence points to a date between 1302 and 1305.

In the first book, Dante discusses the relationship between Latin and [[vernacular]], and the search for an "illustrious" vernacular in the [[Italy|Italian]] area; the second book is an analysis of the structure of the ''canto'' or song (also spelled ''[[canzone|canzuni]]'' in [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]]), which is a [[literary genre]] developed in the Sicilian School of poetry.

Latin essays were very popular in the [[Middle Ages]], but Dante made some innovations in his work: firstly, the subject (writing in vernacular) was an uncommon topic in literary discussion at that time. Also significant was how Dante approached this theme; that is, he presented an argument for giving vernacular the same dignity and legitimacy Latin was typically given. Finally, Dante wrote this essay in order to analyse the origin and the [[philosophy]] of the vernacular, because, in his opinion, this language was not something static, but something that evolves and needed a historical contextualisation.

==Structure==
Dante interrupted his work at the fourteenth chapter of the second book, and though historians have tried to find a reason for this, it is still not known why Dante so abruptly aborted his essay. Indeed it is an unfinished project, and so information about its intended structure is limited. Though at some point, Dante mentions a fourth book in which he planned to deal with the [[comic genre]] and the "mediocre" style, nothing at all is known about the third book. It is thought, however, that the first book was meant to be a sort of preface to the following three books, and so shorter than the others.

==Content==
In the beginning, Dante tackles the historical evolution of [[language]], which he thinks was born unitary and, at a later stage, was separated into different idioms because of the presumptuousness demonstrated by humankind at the time of the building of the [[Tower of Babel]]. He compiles a map of the geographical position of the languages he knows, dividing the European territory into three parts: one to the east, with the [[Greek language]]s; one to the north, with the [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] languages, which he believed included Magyar and Slavic languages; one to the south, separated into three Romance languages identified by their word for 'yes': [[Occitan language|oc language]], [[Langue d'oïl|oïl language]] and [[Italian language|sì language]]. He then discusses ''gramatica'', "[[grammar]]", which is a static language consisting of unchanging rules, needed to make up for the [[natural language]]s. In chapters ten to fifteen of the first book, Dante writes about his search for the [[illustrious vernacular]], among the fourteen varieties he claims to have found in the Italian region. In the second book, Dante deals with literary genres, specifying which are the ones that suit the vernacular.

==Models==
Dante takes inspiration from rhetorical essays in Latin, [[Occitan language|Occitan]], [[Sicilian language|Sicilian]], and Italian, and from philosophical readings. The main classical rhetorical texts from which he drew information were the ''[[Ars Poetica (Horace)|Ars Poetica]]'' by [[Horace]], the ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' by an anonymous author, and ''[[De Inventione]]'' by [[Cicero]]. About the philosophical works, it is important to know that Dante read not only first hand texts, but also summaries  that sometimes were not of the original work, but of an intermediary one.  The influence and importance of the contribution of the Sicilian language is emphasized by his assertion that "the first hundred and fifty years of Italian poetry was written in Sicilian". 

The major Occitan work that influenced Dante was probably ''Razos de trobar'' by the [[Catalan people|Catalan]] [[troubadour]] [[Raimon Vidal de Bezaudun]] and the ''Vers e regles de trobar'', an amplification of Vidal's manual, by [[Jofre de Foixà]].{{sfn|Ewert|1940|page=357}}{{sfn|Weiss|1942|page=160 n1}} Both of these works were Occitan manuals of grammar for troubadour poetry. They implicitly and explicitly defended Occitan as the best vernacular for song and verse, prompting Dante to come to the defence of his beloved Tuscan tongue. The popularity of both singing and composing in Occitan by Italians prompted Dante to write: {{lang|it|A perpetuale infamia e depressione delli malvagi uomini d'Italia, che commendano lo volgare altrui, e lo loro proprio dispregiano, dico...}},{{sfn|Graham-Leigh|2005|pages=32 and n130}} meaning "To the perpetual shame and lowness of the wicked men of Italy, that praise somebody else's vernacular and despise their own, I say..." (''[[Convivio]]'', treatise I, XI).

Directly or indirectly, Dante came to read [[Augustine of Hippo|Saint Augustine]]'s works, the ''[[Consolation of Philosophy|De Consolatione Philosophiae]]'' by [[Anicius Manlius Severinus Boethius|Boëthius]], [[Saint Thomas Aquinas]]'s works and some [[encyclopedic dictionary|encyclopedic dictionaries]] like the ''[[Etymologiae]]'' by [[Isidore of Seville]] and the ''[[Livre du Tresor]]'' by [[Brunetto Latini]]. He takes also inspiration from [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] philosophy, and references to texts by representatives of what is sometimes referred to as [[Radical Aristotelianism]] can be found in Dante's work.

Before services, they bathe and don white clothing, turbans,&lt;ref name="Kaufman" /&gt; and a loose striped over-garment called a ''shamma''.  Debteras carry prayer sticks to the service, where they sing, dance, and play drums and [[sistrum|sistra]] outside the church or the [[synagogue]] during religious services.&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p52-53" /&gt;

=== Among the Beta Israel ===
Among the Beta Israel, the status of debtera is a milestone in the study to become a [[kahen]]. Unlike fully-fledged Kahens (who perform none of the functions of ''debtra''), debteras are closer to the laypeople, often serving as intermediaries between them and the clergy. A Kahen who gives up his position or is deposed may serve as a ''debtera''.&lt;ref name="Greenfield"&gt;Isaac Greenfield, "The Debtera and the education among Ethiopian Jewry until the arrival of Dr. Faitlovitch" in Menachem Waldman (ed.), ''Studies in the History of Ethiopian Jews'', Habermann Institute of Literary Research, 2011, pp. 109-135 (Hebrew)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Among Christians ===
''Kahens'' and ''debteras'' are two separate professions,&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p47"&gt;{{cite book|last=Munro-Hay|first=Stuart|authorlink=Stuart Munro-Hay|title=Ethiopia, the Unknown Land: A Cultural and Historical Guide|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NWNTfztz5KoC&amp;pg=PA47|year=2002|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=978-1-86064-744-4|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; though it is possible to pursue both roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Crummey|first=Donald|title=Land and Society in the Christian Kingdom of Ethiopia: From the Thirteenth to the Twentieth Century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Di0w6h0qHGMC&amp;pg=PA174|year=2000|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-02482-5|page=174}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Orthodox Tewahedo]] churches see the division as following the model used by the ancient Israelites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Milkias|first=Paulos|title=Ethiopia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Iu9mnXhvSswC&amp;pg=PA175|year=2011|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-258-6|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Lenten services, ''debteras'' tap prayer sticks to keep the rhythm.  The Ethiopian Church condones the performances of ''debteras'', citing the story in [[2 Kings]] of [[David]] dancing at the temple and {{Bibleverse||Psalm|47:1|KJV}} ("[[Psalm 47|O clap your hands]]") for Biblical examples.  These performances also feature symbols connected to the [[Passion of Jesus]]: the sistrum's swaying and the beating of the drums represent Christ's swaying while enduring beatings, and the tapping of the prayer sticks represent the [[flagellation of Christ]].&lt;ref name="Munro-Hay p47" /&gt;

== Religio-Magical Healing ==
Debteras participate in liturgy as singers and musicians and, outside the Church religio-magical healers by performing as herbalists, astrologers, fortune-tellers etc. Some Ethiopian authors consider these healers as ‘spiritual healers’ whereas, they are purely religio-magical healers.&lt;ref name="Janetius, S.T 2016"&gt;Janetius, S.T. Abyssinia in the New Millennium (Revised Edition), 2016. {{ISBN|9783659710629}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all duties taken on by Debteras are condoned by the Ethiopian Church. Many distribute contraceptive herbs to women and perform magic meant to perform contraceptive functions, in contradiction to the Ethiopian Church's teachings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=l4WUdKWGcYsC&amp;lpg=PA4&amp;ots=pammUsXz-J&amp;dq=famous%20dabtaras&amp;pg=PA4#v=onepage&amp;q=famous%20dabtaras&amp;f=false "Healer," Encyclopaedia Aethiopica: He-N, by Siegbert Uhlig, publ. by Otto Harrassowitz Verlag, 2007, p. 4]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some are also reputed to study [[black magic]] invoking [[demon]]s alongside their more benevolent official learning.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

Some Debteras manufacture [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] [[amulet]]s meant to protect the wearer from evil spirits.&lt;ref name="Turner" /&gt;  These amulets are often made of silver and are noted for their use against the legendary [[Buda (folk religion)|budas]], [[zār]] spirits, and the [[evil eye]].  They may also study a variety of anti-magic invocations, [[prayer]]s, and exorcisms.  These exorcisms may include prayers, blessing of [[holy water]] (which the possessed person drinks), burning of roots, and incantations from a ''Magic Star Book''.&lt;ref name="Geleta" /&gt;  Some amulets may take the form of small scrolls kept in pouches or similar containers, made from the skin of a sacrificed goat or lamb whose blood is used to ritually purify the intended owner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.medievalportland.pdx.edu/?q=ethiopian-magic-scroll Description of Ethiopian Magic Scroll] at [[Portland State University]]'s [http://www.medievalportland.pdx.edu/ Medieval Portland site].&lt;/ref&gt;  Some practice (or rather circumvent) [[astrology]], by giving unlucky people new stars by changing their names.  This may be considered "cheating" by the locals, however.  Some Debteras have also been noted to use [[Datura stramonium]] to cause hallucinations.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

A debtera may charge a fee for his charms, exorcisms, and astrological practices, but not liturgical activities.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=J00xEkY-vTEC&amp;lpg=PA56&amp;dq=debtera&amp;pg=PA56#v=onepage&amp;q=debtera&amp;f=false A History of African Higher Education from Antiquity to the Present: A Critical Synthesis By G-m G-m Lulat, ABC-CLIO, 30 Aug 2005, p.56]&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all of the Debteras duties and cures are [[supernatural]].  Debteras place [[scarecrow]]s in farm fields to protect them and shave heads to prevent [[lice]] outbreaks.&lt;ref name="Finneran" /&gt;  Before the [[Derg|1974 revolution]], nobles would often hire Debteras to educate their children.&lt;ref name="Molvaer" /&gt;

A major theological difference in the healing practices of Priests and Debteras is that for the priests, sin Vs virtue or evil-spirit Vs God is the basis for any sickness and healings. Therefore, they prescribe prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel), baptism (washing of sins), fasting, penance together with holy water as a remedy. For the debteras it is evil spirit Vs human beings; almost all the sickness are possession of evil spirits or caused by evil spirits, therefore, prayer (degmit) and holy water (tsebel) become the integral part of any ritualistic religious healing ceremony. Besides these, kitab or amulets are also prepared and give by them to be worn to wade away the evil spirits and evil eye (buda). On the other hand, the priests use the practice of confession, fasting, penance and Church attendance as a means of healing together with some sort of advice and guidance. The soul-father, called yenafs abbat is a kind of family spiritual-doctor, common in many places makes frequent visits to the home and performs services as required.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.in/Abyssinia-New-Millennium-Dr-Janetius/dp/1522757716&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Janetius, S.T 2016"/&gt;

'''Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc.''' (often called '''Diamond Comics''', '''DCD''', or casually '''Diamond''') is a [[comic book]] [[distribution (business)|distributor]] serving retailers in North America and worldwide. They transport comic books and graphic novels from both big and small comic book publishers, or suppliers, to [[retail]]ers, as well as other pop-culture products such as toys, games, and apparel. Diamond distributes to the [[direct market]] in the United States, and has an exclusive distribution arrangements with most major U.S. comic book publishers, including [[Dark Horse Comics]], [[DC Comics]], [[IDW Publishing]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsbeat.com/2010/03/18/idw-become-premier-publisher-with-diamond/ "IDW Becomes Diamond Premiere Publisher"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100322225332/http://www.comicsbeat.com/2010/03/18/idw-become-premier-publisher-with-diamond/ |date=2010-03-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Image Comics]], [[Marvel Comics]], and more.

Diamond is also the parent company of [[Alliance Game Distributors]], Diamond Book Distributors, Diamond UK, [[Diamond Select Toys]],  [[Gemstone Publishing]], E. Gerber Products, Diamond International Galleries, Hake's Americana &amp; Collectibles, Morphy's Auctions, the [[Geppi's Entertainment Museum]], and [[Baltimore (magazine)|''Baltimore'' magazine]],

Diamond is the publisher of ''Previews'', a monthly catalog/magazine showcasing upcoming comic books, graphic novels, toys, and other pop-culture merchandise available at comic book specialty shops. The publication is available to both comic shop retailers and consumers.

==History==
In 1982, Baltimore-based comics retailer Steve Geppi founded Diamond Comic Distributors. Diamond became the successor to direct market pioneer [[Phil Seuling]]'s distribution dream when it took over [[New Media/Irjax]]'s warehouses in 1982. Diamond further bought out early-distributor [[Bud Plant Inc.]] in 1988, and main rival [[Capital City Distribution]] in 1996, to assume a near-monopoly on comics distribution, including exclusivity deals with the major [[List of comics publishing companies|comic book publishers]].

=== Beginnings ===
By 1981/82 Geppi had four comics retail locations and was already "doing a little informal distributing... for smaller retailers."&lt;ref name="Success"&gt;Warshaw, Michael with illustration by [[Neal Adams]], "From Mailman to Tycoon," ''[[Success (magazine)|Success]]'' (June, 1994), pp. 28–32&lt;/ref&gt; Geppi found himself "one of the biggest accounts" for New Media/Irjax,&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; and when the distributor "relocated to Florida, he asked Geppi to service more accounts for a bigger discount."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; One of the "last loyal customers" when New Media began having fiscal difficulties, Geppi made a deal: "[t]he owner was going into retail," so Geppi agreed to provide New Media/Irjax with "free books for a period of time in return for his account list," buying parts of the company, and founding Diamond Comic Distribution.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt;

Geppi had been a sub-distributor for Hal Shuster's Irjax in the late 1970s.&lt;ref name="DuinDD"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "[[Direct market|Direct Distribution]]" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 126-130&lt;/ref&gt; In what [[Mile High Comics]]' [[Chuck Rozanski]] describes as an "incredibly risky and gutsy move," Geppi took over New Media/Irjax's "office and warehouse space" and, recalled Rozanski, had to "sort out the good customers from the bad overnight" negotiating with creditors to continue Shuster's distribution business as Diamond Comic Distribution.&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt; Almost overnight, noted Rozanski, "[h]e went from being a retailer in Baltimore to having warehouses all over the place."&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt;

Geppi named his new company 'Diamond' "after the imprint [[Marvel Comics]] used on non-returnable comics," and although the "publisher discontinued the symbol" months later, the name remained.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; "Diamond grew an average of 40 percent a year," as comics retail took off.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt;

In 1983, Diamond hired an accounting firm, and in 1985 hired "no-nonsense CPA" Chuck Parker "as Diamond's first controller".&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; In 1994, Diamond employee Mark Herr noted that this move was Geppi's "best decision", as Parker "cares nothing about the comics. To him, it's dollars and cents."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; Parker describes his role as "smooth[ing] the emotion out of some decisions. Steve [Geppi] is a visionary and a risk-taker... and I tend to be more conservative."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt;

===Expansion===
After starting his business through buying New Media/Irjax's warehouses and offices in 1982, Geppi's distribution company has bought out many other distribution companies since. Many fans "with little experience" started rival distribution companies only to "find they were in over their heads," allowing Geppi to "[buy] out the smart ones or pick... up the pieces after the stupid ones went out of business," according to Herr.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; Diamond was aided in his efforts by the publishers themselves. In the early 1980s, Marvel and DC Comics provided trade terms favorable for larger distributors and those with efficient freight systems, effectively "play[ing] into the hands of the major distributors such as Capital and Diamond," and hastening the demise of smaller distributors.&lt;ref name="DuinDD"/&gt;

==== Bud Plant Inc. ====
Most notably, in 1988, Geppi bought up early mail-order distributor Bud Plant Inc.,&lt;ref&gt;"Bud Plant Sells Out to Diamond," ''The Comics Journal'' #124 (August 1988), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; who had himself bought out [[Charles Abar Distribution]] in 1982.&lt;ref name="DuinPlant"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Bud Plant" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 356-357&lt;/ref&gt; Plant had, since 1970, been selling [[underground comics]] (a field which Geppi and fellow distributor [[Buddy Saunders]] had tended to steer clear of).&lt;ref name="DuinPlant"/&gt; After making $19m in sales in 1987, Diamond bought West Coast distributor Plant's business&lt;ref&gt;Plant maintains a mail-order and Internet presence in art books, trade paperbacks and rare books, however. Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Bud Plant" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 356-357&lt;/ref&gt; in 1988 "and went national"&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; thereby assuming control of "40 percent of the [[direct market|direct-sales market]]."&lt;ref name="DuinPlant"/&gt; (Diamond and Capital City Distribution had control of at least 70% between them.)

==== Further expansion ====
In 1990, Diamond acquired the Seattle-based sub-distributor [[Destiny Distribution]].&lt;ref name=Diamond-timeline&gt;[http://www.diamondcomics.com/Home/1/1/3/597?articleID=117735 "Diamond Timeline Chronicles 30 Years of Service &amp; Success,"] Diamond Comic Distributors, Inc. official website. Accessed Feb. 10, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Independent Meets Its Destiny," ''The Comics Journal'' #139 (December 1990), pp. 12-13.&lt;/ref&gt; Destiny had been started by Phil Pankow in the early 1980s, and was initially supplied by Bud Plant. Also in 1990, Diamond acquired Oregon-based [[Second Genesis Distribution]]&lt;ref name=Diamond-timeline /&gt; (whose operations folded in 1991).&lt;ref&gt;"Second Genesis Delaying Its Exodus," ''The Comics Journal'' #140 (February 1991), p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1991, Diamond moved into the [[UK]] market, acquiring [[Pacific Comics|Pacific Distribution, Ltd.]]&lt;ref name=Diamond-timeline /&gt; In 1992, Diamond acquired the British distributor [[Titan Distributors]], an arm of [[Titan Entertainment Group]].&lt;ref&gt;"NewsWatch: Diamond Acquires Titan Distributors," The Comics Journal #154 (Nov. 1992), p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, Diamond acquired Staten Island-based distributor [[Comics Unlimited]].&lt;ref name=Diamond-timeline /&gt; By this point, Diamond had "27 warehouses in the U.S., Canada, and the U.K., employ[ing] between 750 and 900 people;" operated its own trucking line; and controlled 45% of the market, making $222 million in sales.&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt;

==== Heroes World and Capital City ====
In 1995, Marvel Comics challenged Diamond and main rival Capital City by buying the third largest distributor — [[Heroes World Distribution]] — and distributing its titles in-house.&lt;ref name="DuinCC"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Capital City" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Diamond reacted by outbidding Capital City for exclusive deals with Marvel's main rivals [[DC Comics]], as well as [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]], [[Image Comics|Image]], and [[Archie Comics]].&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Tip 11: Go Exclusive with Diamond" ''The Comics Journal'' #185 (March 1996), p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; Capital City's response saw it sign exclusive deals with [[Kitchen Sink Press]] and [[Viz Comics]], but a year later faced the choice between bankruptcy and selling out. Diamond bought Capital City in the summer of 1996, assuming near-control of the comics distribution system.&lt;ref name="DuinCC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bNet"&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0EIN/is_1996_July_26/ai_18526328 "Diamond Comic Distributors acquires Capital City Distribution; Comic distribution industry stabilized by purchase," bNet: Business Wire (July 26, 1996).]&lt;/ref&gt;  The purchase price was not disclosed, but the acquisition brought an estimated $50 million in sales revenue to Diamond.&lt;ref name="bNet" /&gt;

In early 1997, when Marvel's Heroes World endeavor failed, Diamond also forged an exclusive deal with the House of Ideas&lt;ref&gt;"Hello Again: Marvel Goes with Diamond," ''The Comics Journal'' #193 (February 1997), pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; — giving the company its own section of comics catalog ''Previews'' (not least because the DC/Dark Horse/Image deal gave contractual prominence to those companies) — making "Geppi... the sole king of comics industry distribution in the summer of 1996."&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt;

==== Antitrust litigation ====
In 1997, Diamond's position in the comics industry, as "the sole source of most new comics products to comics specialty shops," ultimately saw the company become the subject of "an investigation by the [[United States Department of Justice|U.S. Justice department]] for possible [[antitrust]] violations."&lt;ref name="DuinDD"/&gt; The Justice Department launched an antitrust investigation into the comics industry and the alleged [[monopoly]] of Diamond Comics. The investigation was closed in November 2000, with no further action deemed necessary&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/comicbrief/archives.cgi?category=1&amp;view=11-00#973711307 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060322213439/http://www.comicbookresources.com/comicbrief/archives.cgi?category=1&amp;view=11-00 |archivedate=2006-03-22 |title=Comic Book Resources &gt; The Comic Brief &gt; DOJ concludes investigation of Diamond Comic Distributors |accessdate=2009-05-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dean, Michael, "Will DC Buy Diamond?" for ''[[The Comics Journal]]'', April 5, 2002. Accessed March 6, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; on the basis that, although Diamond enjoyed a monopoly in the North American comic book direct market distribution, they did not enjoy a monopoly on book distribution (books including non-comic books).

==== Books and games ====
In addition to having cornered the American comics distribution market, Diamond includes a number of subsidiary and affiliated companies. UK and European comics distribution is served by Diamond UK, based in Runcorn, England.&lt;ref name="Affil"/&gt;

On August 31, 2000, Diamond Comic Distributors acquired [[Alliance Game Distributors]], North America's largest distributor of tabletop games.&lt;ref name="baltimoresun-adams"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2000-09-01/business/0009010129_1_geppi-comic-books-diamond-comic |title=Geppi, the comics king, is buying Alliance Games |date=September 1, 2000 |first=Paul |last=Adams |work=[[The Baltimore Sun]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2002, Diamond consolidated its book trade into Diamond Book Distributors, marketing [[graphic novel]]s and [[Trade paperback (comics)|trade paperback]]s to bookstores including [[Barnes &amp; Noble]], [[Ingram Content Group|Ingram]], [[Baker &amp; Taylor]], [[Amazon.com]] and [[Borders Group|Borders]].&lt;ref name="Affil"/&gt;

==Criticism==
In 1983, Diamond was criticized for taking exception to certain "adult"-themed titles and scenes, effectively causing the cancellation of a series called ''[[Void Indigo]]'' for its excessive violence.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

In 1987, Geppi responded to "a graphic childbirth scene in ''[[Miracleman]]'' #9 [written by [[Alan Moore]]]." Geppi wrote to retailers that:
{{cquote|"Diamond values its retailers too much to take chances on such a dangerous situation... We are not [[Censorship|censor]]s. We no more want someone deciding for us than you do. We cannot, however, stand by and watch the marketplace become a dumping ground for every sort of graphic fantasy that someone wants to live out. We have an industry to protect; we have leases to abide by; we have a community image to maintain."&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt;}}
This call for retailers to refuse to stock ''Miracleman''&lt;ref&gt;"Geppi of Diamond Calls on Retailers to Voice Objections to Publishers," ''The Comics Journal'' #113 (December 1986), pp. 12-14.&lt;/ref&gt; led to accusations of censorship,&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond Policies Questioned," ''The Comics Journal'' #116 (July 1987), pp. 18-20.&lt;/ref&gt; charges the company was forced to address when it criticized or refused to carry other titles, including books by Kitchen Sink Press,&lt;ref name="TCJ Diamond Back Down" /&gt; and [[Dave Sim]] in 1988,&lt;ref name="TCJ Diamond Back Down"&gt;"Diamond Backs Down," ''The Comics Journal'' #121 (April 1988), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond Distributors Clashes With Aardvark-Vanaheim," ''The Comics Journal'' #122 (March 1988), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"A-V, Diamond Clash Again," ''The Comics Journal'' #122 (June 1988), pp. 20-21.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond Loosens Up," ''The Comics Journal'' #122 (June 1988), pp. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Jon Lewis (comics)|Jon Lewis]] in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Diamond Refuses to Distribute Xeric Winner ''True Swamp''," ''The Comics Journal'' #166 (February 1994), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Mike Diana]] in 1996.&lt;ref name="TCJ Bias"&gt;"What's the Story Behind Diamond's Rejection of Mike Diana?: Three Diana Comics Rejected in 1996: Publishers and Distributor give Different Reasons; Accusation of Bias against Small Publishers" ''The Comics Journal'' #192 (December 1996), pp. 7-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Diamond lost customers with this approach, however, "and eventually backed down."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; Geppi recalls compromising, and accepting "that as a distributor, I owed the retailers the product they wanted."&lt;ref name="Success"/&gt; In fact, in an attempt to prove Diamond did not practice censorship, the company joined DC Comics in 1993 to raise money for the industry's [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]] advocacy group [[Comic Book Legal Defense Fund]].&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond and DC Raise Money for CBLDF," ''The Comics Journal'' #160 (June 1993), p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its industry dominance, Diamond also faced charges it bullied publishers&lt;ref&gt;Stump, Greg. "News Watch: Paranoia? Some Retailers Fear Diamond," ''The Comics Journal'' #199 (October 1997), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and discriminated against small publishers. These charges first surfaced in 1988 when Diamond rejected [[Matt Feazell]]'s comic ''[[Ant Boy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond Rejects Ant Boy" ''The Comics Journal'' #124 (August 1988), pp. 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Baisden, Greg. "Diamond Accepts ''Ant Boy''" ''The Comics Journal'' #125 (October 1988), pp. 17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1989 when it similarly decided not to carry [[Allen Freeman]]'s ''Slam Bang'' anthology.&lt;ref&gt;"Diamond Distributors Rejects ''Slam Bang''" ''The Comics Journal'' #132 (November 1989), pp. 14-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the industry consolidation of 1996, Diamond faced similar charges in 1996,&lt;ref name="TCJ Bias" /&gt; 1999,&lt;ref&gt;Spurgeon, Tom with Craig McKenney. "Diamond and the Small Press, Part II: Breaking the Cycle: Rick Veitch Leaves Diamond Behind," ''The Comics Journal'' #21 (November 1999), pp. 16-19.&lt;/ref&gt; and 2000 (when smaller publishers like [[Fantagraphics]] and [[Drawn and Quarterly]] lodged complaints).&lt;ref&gt;Stroup, Tim and Mark Thompson.

== Publishing ==
Diamond's monthly comics retail catalog, ''Previews'' has been produced by Diamond for over twenty-five years for store owners and comic shop customers to order their products. It is additionally available for sale to customers to facilitate pre-orders from "pull and hold" or subscription customers who frequent comic shops on a regular basis. Comics publishers vie for space within the publication's pages, with Dark Horse, DC Comics, Image Comics, and [[IDW Publishing]] taking precedence as "Premier" publishers. Marvel Comics has its own mini-catalog of ''Marvel Previews'' available separately, for contractual reasons.

Geppi is also owner of [[Gemstone Publishing|Gemstone Publishing Inc.]], through which he publishes ''[[The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide]]''.&lt;ref name="GEM"/&gt; Gemstone has also published [[Russ Cochran (publisher)|Russ Cochran]]'s [[EC Comics]] reprints, [[Disney comics]] and [[Blue Book]] price guide in the past as well.

=== ''Baltimore'' ===
In 1994, Geppi purchased ''[[Baltimore (magazine)|Baltimore]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Geppi Buys ''Baltimore''," ''The Comics Journal'' #174 (February 1995), p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; "a 50,000 circulation monthly and one of the nation's oldest regional publications."&lt;ref name="GEM"&gt;[http://www.geppismuseum.com/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=52&amp;s=508&amp;ai=69010 Geppi's Entertainment Museum Press Room: "Geppi's Entertainment Museum President/CEO Stephen A. Geppi Bio"]. Accessed March 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gemstone Publishing===
{{main|Gemstone Publishing}}

Geppi's publishing ventures in the comics field saw him create Gemstone Publishing Inc., which was formed in large part from other purchases. In 1992, Diamond bought [[Ernst Gerber|Ernst Gerber Publishing]] (publisher-author of the ''Photo-Journal Guide to Comics'').&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"&gt;Duin, Steve and [[Mike Richardson (publisher)|Richardson, Mike]] (ed.s) "Diamond Comic Distributors" in ''Comics Between the Panels'' ([[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse Publishing]], 1998) {{ISBN|1-56971-344-8}}, p. 125-126&lt;/ref&gt; E. Gerber Products, LLC is a Diamond-affiliated company started by Gerber in 1977 which sells [[Mylar]] bags as well as "acid-free boxes and acid-free backing boards" for comics collectors to store their collection in.&lt;ref name="Affil"&gt;[http://www.diamondcomics.com/public/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=3&amp;s=305&amp;ai=36048 Diamond Comics Distributors, Inc. "Affiliated Companies"]. Accessed March 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1993, Geppi bought Russ Cochran Publishing.&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt; Long-term EC Comics fan Cochran auctioned [[Bill Gaines]]' personal file copies of EC publications, as well as most pages of original EC artwork (which, almost uniquely, Gaines had maintained ownership and possession of), before being granted the reprint rights to the EC back catalog itself. Geppi included Cochran's publications — and Cochran himself — under his new imprint, Gemstone Publishing.&lt;ref name="GEM"/&gt;

In 1994, Geppi bought Overstreet Publishing, taking up the publishing reins of official-Blue Book price guide ''The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide'', and other related publications, bringing them under the Gemstone imprint.&lt;ref name="DuinDiamond"/&gt; Geppi's publishing activities with Gemstone Publishing consist primarily of reprints of classic titles and artworks, as well as publications (including professional [[comics fanzine|fanzines]] "pro-zines") focusing heavily on the history of the comics medium. Many Gemstone publications revolve around ''[[Comic Book Marketplace]]''-editor and EC-shepherd Russ Cochran.

====EC Comics reprints====
{{main|EC Comics|EC Archives}}

Cochran, like Geppi, was a particular fan of [[Carl Barks]]' Disney comics, and had previously-published EC reprints in association with Disney-reprinter Gladstone Publishing. In the early 1990s, Geppi's Gemstone embarked on a full series of reprints of classic EC titles, starting with new reprints of the Cochran/Gladstone-reprints of ''[[The Haunt of Fear]]'', ''[[The Vault of Horror]]'' and ''[[Weird Science (comic)|Weird Science]]'' (all 1992). Gemstone also republished (in single issue and 'annual' — four issues per 'annual' — format) EC's ''[[List of EC Comics Publications#New Trend|New Trend]]'' and ''[[List of EC Comics Publications#New Direction|New Direction]]'' titles between 1992 and 2000.

In 2005, Gemstone added to Cochran's earlier-published oversize, hardback, black &amp; white slip-cased "The Complete EC Library" collections with the complete ''[[List of EC Comics Publications#Picto-Fiction|Picto-Fiction]]'' collection, comprising the EC comics: ''[[Confessions Illustrated]]'', ''[[Crime Illustrated]]'', ''[[Shock Illustrated]]'' and ''[[Terror Illustrated]]'', along with "18 previously unseen stories, never published before".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bookpalace.com/acatalog/Home_Complete_EC_Library_31.html The Book Palace's "Complete EC Library" pages]. Accessed 12 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, Gemstone began producing a more durable and luxurious series of hardback reprint collections; the [[EC Archives]] — similar to the [[DC Archive Editions|DC Archives]] and [[Marvel Masterworks]] volumes — which reprint in full-color hardback ('archival') format sequential compilations of the EC titles. Designed by art director/designer [[Michael Kronenberg]], a number of volumes have been released, with the entirety of the ''[[List of Entertaining Comics publications#New Trend|New Trend]]'' and ''[[List of Entertaining Comics publications#New Direction|New Direction]]'' planned for eventual release.&lt;ref&gt;[http://marvelmasterworksfansite.yuku.com/sreply/154876/t/WEIRD-SCIENCE-3-Error.html Michael Kronenberg posting at MarvelMasterworksFansite.Yuku.com, July 26, 2008]. Accessed September 1, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These EC Archives volumes have drawn praise for their quality, and feature introductions by such notable EC fans as [[George Lucas]], [[Steven Spielberg]], [[Joe Dante]] and [[Paul Levitz]].

====Disney comics====
{{main|Disney comics|Carl Barks}}

In December 2002, it was announced that "Gemstone Publishing had signed the license to publishing Disney comics in North America," with ex-Gladstone Publishing editor-in-chief John Clark joining Gemstone in the same position over its Disney line.&lt;ref name="ScoopDisney"&gt;[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=34&amp;s=265&amp;ai=42560&amp;ssd=1/25/2003&amp;arch=y "Starting Over — The Return of the Disney Comics" online in Diamond's ''Scoop'', January 25, 2003]. Accessed March 5, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Launched with a title for [[Free Comic Book Day]] 2003, the line started soon after with ''[[Walt Disney's Comics and Stories]]'' and ''[[Uncle Scrooge|Walt Disney's Uncle Scrooge]]'', both described by Clark as "monthly 64-page prestige-format books at $6.95, which is the same price they were when last produced, in 1998."&lt;ref name="ScoopDisney"/&gt; Other titles followed, and Gemstone held their license until early 2009.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolfstad.com/dcw/blog/2009/03/gemstone-ends-disney-license/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide====
{{main|The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide}}

The (Official) Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide, first published by Robert M. Overstreet in 1970 as one of the earliest authorities on [[United States|American]] [[comic book]] industry grading and collection values. Overstreet sold his company to Gemstone in 1994,&lt;ref&gt;"Newswatch: Overstreet Purchase Causes Stir," ''The Comics Journal'' #172 (November 1994), pp. 37-38.&lt;/ref&gt; but continued to "serve as author and/or publisher of Geppi's Entertainment Publishing &amp; Auctions' line of books."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.geppisentertainment.com/bob_overstreet.html "Robert M. Overstreet" bio at ''Geppi's Entertainment'']. Accessed April 7, 2009  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090718002412/http://www.geppisentertainment.com/bob_overstreet.html |date=July 18, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Publication of the ''Price Guide'' was taken over by Gemstone in 1998, Gemstone took over publication, and the twenty-eighth edition to the present have been (co-)published by Geppi's Gemstone publications.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comicsresearch.org/collect.html Comics Research.org's "Collecting Guides"]. Accessed March 7, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Guide'''s 39th edition was published by Gemstone Publishing in 2009.

Overstreet also produced a variety of smaller publications updating his yearly guides on a monthly schedule. The most recent of these - ''Overstreet's Comic Price Review'' - began publication from Gemstone in July 2003, and was a monthly publication designed to update the yearly price guide more regularly, as well as provide articles, analysis and various lists of comics prices.

Gemstone published more than a hundred issues of the magazine ''Comic Book Marketplace'', a monthly magazine for comics fans focusing heavily on the [[Golden Age of Comic Books|Golden]] and [[Silver Age of Comic Books|Silver]] ages, while more popular magazines (such as ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard]]'') skew more recent in focus.

====Future====
In early 2009, the future of Gemstone Publishing was unclear, after reports of unpaid printing bills, particularly from the EC Archives.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2009/02/18/steve-geppis-debt-woes-growing/ Heidi MacDonald, "Steve Geppi’s debt woes growing" in ''The Beat'', February 18, 2009]. Accessed March 5, 2009 {{Webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120714211923/http://pwbeat.publishersweekly.com/blog/2009/02/18/steve-geppis-debt-woes-growing/ |date=July 14, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April, Geppi responded to the uncertainty, noting that while there had been "a reduction in staff at Gemstone," such moves did "not signal the end of Gemstone Publishing."&lt;ref name="ScoopGemstone"&gt;[http://scoop.diamondgalleries.com/public/default.asp?t=1&amp;m=1&amp;c=34&amp;s=259&amp;ai=81682 "Rumors about Gemstone Publishing?"] in ''Scoop'', April 18, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, Diamond introduced ComicSuite, an add-on application for Microsoft Dynamics’ Retail Management System (RMS) software. Together, ComicSuite &amp; RMS give specialty storeowners a point-of-sale (POS) system specifically geared towards their unique business model, offering a host of exclusive features that grant you direct communication with Diamond databases, making it easier than ever before to place orders, track inventory and maintain “pull-and-hold” subscriptions for your customers."

== Affiliated and subsidiary companies ==
In 1995, Geppi founded Diamond International Galleries, which acquired Hake's [[Americana]] &amp; [[Collectibles]] [[auction house]] (2004), and in 2005, Pennsylvania-based Morphy Auctions.&lt;ref name="Antiq"&gt;[http://www.journalofantiques.com/Sept06%5Cfeature.html "Sneak Preview Geppi's Entertainment Museum at Camden Yards – Baltimore, Maryland," ''The Journal of Antiques and Collectibles'' (September 2006)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705084736/http://www.journalofantiques.com/Sept06/feature.html |date=2008-07-05 }}.

While they also make action figures in a variety of sizes, as well as banks, busts, statues and prop replicas, many of their licensed properties are released in the form of [[Minimates]], which has helped make Minimates one of the most prolific and diverse block figure toy lines in the world. In 2007, after years of partnership, Diamond Select Toys made a move to acquire select assets of New York-based design house Art Asylum,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.toymania.com/news/messages/9319.shtml "Diamond Select Acquires Art Asylum"]&lt;/ref&gt; the creators of Minimates and DST has since developed Minimates based on its own concepts, under the brands Minimates M.A.X. and Calico Jack's Pirate Raiders.

=== Diamond International Galleries ===
In 1995, Geppi "opened Diamond International Galleries," a showplace for comics and collectibles, part of Geppi's attempts to "see... collectibles attain serious respect."&lt;ref name="Antiq"/&gt; Nine years later, Diamond International Galleries purchased "one of the country’s first, and most respected, collectibles auction houses: Hake's Americana &amp; Collectibles."&lt;ref name="Antiq"/&gt; In 2005, Geppi added the "[[Denver, Pennsylvania|Denver]], Pennsylvania-based Morphy Auctions" to his growing stable of parts of the collectibles market, which already included publishing the main comics price guide: ''The Overstreet Comic Book Price Guide''.&lt;ref name="Antiq"/&gt;

Geppi describes his International Galleries as being "at the heart of many significant opportunities to preserve, promote and present historical comic character collectibles," an endeavor that led to his establishing Geppi's Entertainment Museum.&lt;ref name="Affil"/&gt; Geppi's galleries showcase much of his private collection, including comics, [[film poster|movie poster]]s, toys, original artwork by individuals including "Carl Barks, [[Gustaf Tenggren|Gustav Tengren &lt;small&gt;(sic)&lt;/small&gt;]], [[Alex Ross]], [[Murphy Anderson]], [[Joe Shuster]], [[Joe Simon]] and [[Charles Schulz]]."&lt;ref name="Affil"/&gt;

Diamond International Galleries has assisted "in such projects as DC's [[DC Archives|Archive series]]," as well as hosting industry events.&lt;ref name="Affil"/&gt;

'''Direct-to-fan''' is a [[business model]] used by independent musicians, [[independent record label|independent music labels]], music marketing professionals, promoters, and others in the music industry.  Direct-to-fan is also becoming a model used by the broad definition of artists, including comedians, visual artists, and other entertainers looking to build and [[Leverage (negotiation)|leverage]] a fan community throughout their career.

The direct-to-fan model bypasses the [[major record label]] model that historically controlled radio, [[Music venue|venue]], and [[Distribution (business)|distribution]] channels, and lets the artist (or the team that supports that musician) create interest in their music directly with their [[Fan (person)|fans]], identify those fans, market directly to and develop relationships with those fans, sell directly to and [[monetize]] those relationships, and use those relationships to expand their fan base.

Foundation components of this model include music [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] sites, and direct-to-fan music sales, marketing, and business solutions.

Direct-to-fan models encourage engaging directly between the artist and their fans, keeping the fans engaged, knowing who they are (who, what, when, where, why), building the artist's brand, and developing the artist-to-fan relationship over time.

==Background==
An early example of this method in the music industry was by the British rock band [[Marillion]], who used the internet to connect with their fans to finance a North American tour in 1997 and a subsequent album in 2001, instead of signing to a record label.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/music/1325340.stm | title= Marillion fans to the rescue | first=Tim |last=Masters | work=BBC News | date=11 May 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, [[Alexis Petridis]] described the band in ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "the undisputed pioneers" of this practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2008/apr/18/popandrock.alexispetridis | title= This song was brought to you by ... | work=The Guardian | first=Alexis | last=Petridis | date=18 April 2008 | accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also addressed by [[Michael Lewis]] in his book ''[[Next: The Future Just Happened]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url= https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/jul/21/computingandthenet.highereducation | title= The kids are all wired | work=The Guardian | first=Steven | last=Poole | date=21 July 2001 | accessdate=8 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tools==
Some tools supporting direct-to-fan include: storefronts to sell direct-to-fan on band websites and on [[social networking]] sites such as Facebook or MySpace, [[GUI widget|Widget]] tools to embed sales, gig or event calendar, [[User profile|profile]] info anywhere including [[blogs]], Marketing tools such as [[email marketing]] and [[messaging]], [[Event planning|Event]] tools, Central [[Content Management]] tools, Central Catalog Management tools for both digital and physical products, and digital delivery platforms that make it easy for you to sell direct from your website or social media by integrating with payment gateways, providing a checkout and automatically delivering music to fans via a download link.

==Sales, marketing, and business solutions==
More complete, one-place-to-manage-everything direct-to-fan solutions are beginning to emerge.  They help the artist's team with fan management, [[brand management]], sales, marketing, distribution, manufacturing, [[event management]], [[merchandizing]], warehousing, fulfillment, and more, all from one [[dashboard]].

==Solution example==
An example of a direct-to-fan solution would have online storefronts for their official band websites, Facebook, MySpace, [[blogs]], etc.; Marketing solutions for [[email marketing]], [[Fan (person)|fan]] capture, fan [[messaging]], and fan management; Label services including [[digital distribution]] to [[iTunes]], [[Amazon.com|Amazon]], and other retail sites, CD and DVD manufacturing, custom [[merch]], print services, [[graphic design]] and web services, [[warehousing]] and fulfilment, backend [[ecommerce]] and payment processing, and more.

Core applications that assist musicians in implementing a direct-to-fan approach include:

* Fan community platforms
*Band website and storefronts
* digital delivery companies
* CD/DVD manufacturing
* [[Digital music]] distribution
* Download cards
* E-tickets and mobile-tickets
* Fan email marketing and messaging
* Fan marketing solutions
* Merchandise
* Music discovery
* Music festival submissions
* Payment processing
* Physical warehousing and fulfillment
* [[Poster]] and print services
* Storefronts
* Pre-sale ticket and album options
* Integration of social sites, such as Facebook and Twitter
* Fan-funding capabilities

Companies that are delivering portions of the above direct-to-fan solution include:

[[Bandcamp]], [[Shopify]], [[Cafe Press]], [[CD Baby]], [[Constant Contact]], [[Music Glue]], [[Nimbit]], [[NoiseTrade]], [[Pledgemusic]], [[ReverbNation]], [[TuneCore]], [[Zazzle]], [https://www.gigrev.com GigRev]

'''''Guerrillero Heroico''''' ({{lang-en|"Heroic Guerrilla Fighter"}}) is an [[icon]]ic [[photograph]] of [[Marxism|Marxist]] [[revolutionary]] [[Che Guevara]] taken by [[Alberto Korda]]. It was captured on March 5, 1960, in [[Havana]], [[Cuba]], at a memorial service for victims of the [[La Coubre explosion|''La Coubre'' explosion]]. By the end of the 1960s, the image, in conjunction with Guevara's subsequent actions and eventual execution, helped solidify the charismatic and controversial leader as a cultural icon.&lt;ref name="CNNCasey"&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/books/05/05/argentina.che.photo/ Communists, Capitalists still buy into Iconic Che Photo, Author says] by Brian Byrnes, ''[[CNN]]'', May 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; Korda has said that at the moment he shot the picture, he was drawn to Guevara's facial expression, which showed "absolute implacability"&lt;ref&gt;''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', by [[Jon Lee Anderson]], 1997, pg 465&lt;/ref&gt; as well as anger and pain.&lt;ref name="Ziff15"&gt;''Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon'', by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 15&lt;/ref&gt; Years later, Korda would say that the photograph showed Che's firm and stoic character.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 33&lt;/ref&gt; Guevara was 31 years old at the time the photograph was taken.

Emphasizing the image's ubiquitous nature and wide appeal, the [[Maryland Institute College of Art]] called the picture a symbol of the 20th century and the world's most famous photograph.&lt;ref&gt;Maryland Institute of Art, referenced at BBC News, "Che Guevara photographer dies", May 26, 2001. [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/1352650.stm Online at BBC News], accessed January 4, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Versions of it have been painted, printed, digitized, embroidered, tattooed, silk-screened, sculpted or sketched on nearly every surface imaginable, leading the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]] to say that the photograph has been reproduced more than any other image in photography.&lt;ref name="va"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vam.ac.uk/vastatic/microsites/1541_che/index.html?page=the_exhibition.html |title=V&amp;A: The story of an image, exhibition organised by UCR/California Museum of Photography |publisher=Vam.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jonathan Green, director of the [[University of California, Riverside California Museum of Photography|UCR/California Museum of Photography]], has speculated that "Korda's image has worked its way into languages around the world. It has become an alpha-numeric symbol, a hieroglyph, an instant symbol. It mysteriously reappears whenever there's a conflict.

The history and contemporary global impact of the image is the basis for the 2008 documentary ''[[Chevolution]]'', directed by Trisha Ziff,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvdtown.com/review/chevolution/dvd/7726 DVD Review: Chevolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214002912/http://www.dvdtown.com/review/chevolution/dvd/7726 |date=2010-02-14 }} by David Van Der Haeghen, ''DVD Town'', January 16, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; along with the 2009 book ''Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image'' by Michael Casey.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/21/books/21kaku.html?_r=2&amp;pagewanted=all Brand Che: Revolutionary as Marketer’s Dream] by [[Michiko Kakutani]], ''[[The New York Times]]'', April 20, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins ==
[[File:CheLaCoubreMarch.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Che Guevara (third from left) and Fidel Castro (far left) marching to Colón Cemetery.]]
On March 4, 1960, the French freighter [[La Coubre explosion|''La Coubre'']] suspiciously exploded in [[Havana Harbor]], killing up to 100 people and injuring several hundred more.&lt;ref name="JLA442"&gt;''Che Guevara: A Revolutionary Life'', by [[Jon Lee Anderson]], 1997, pg 442&lt;/ref&gt; Upon hearing the blast, Guevara rushed to the harbor to board the burning ship, angrily forcing his way past those concerned for his safety following a secondary explosion.&lt;ref name="JLA442" /&gt;

The following day on March 5, President [[Fidel Castro]] blamed the U.S. [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and called for a memorial service and mass demonstration at Havana's [[Colon Cemetery, Havana|Colón Cemetery]], to honor the victims.&lt;ref name="JLA442" /&gt; At the time, Guevara was Minister of Industry in the new government, and Korda was Castro's official photographer. After a funeral march along the seafront boulevard known as [[Malecón, Havana|Malecón]], Fidel Castro gave a eulogy for the fallen at a stage on 23rd street.&lt;ref name="timeskordaobit"&gt;[http://www.blythe.org/nytransfer-subs/2001-Caribbean-Vol-2/Obit:_Alberto_Korda_(Times_of_London) Obit: Alberto Korda] [[The Times]], May 28, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Castro gave a fiery speech, using the words ''"Patria o Muerte"'' ("Homeland or Death") for the first time.&lt;ref name="LAHT50" /&gt;  Meanwhile, at 11:20&amp;nbsp;am, Guevara came into view for a few seconds. Korda snapped just two frames of him from a distance of about {{Convert|25|–|30|ft|m|abbr=on}} before he disappeared from sight.&lt;ref name="timeskordaobit" /&gt; Korda immediately realised his photograph had the attributes of a portrait.&lt;ref name="findarticles.com"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_qn4156/is_20071007/ai_n21035836 |title=''The Making of an Icon: Forty Years'', Sunday Herald, Oct 7 2007 |publisher=Findarticles.com |date= October 7, 2007|accessdate=2011-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Korda said of this photograph, "I remember it as if it were today … seeing him framed in the viewfinder, with that expression. I am still startled by the impact … it shakes me so powerfully".&lt;ref name="va" /&gt;

[[File:KordaFilmRollChe detail.jpg|250px|thumb|The two photographs of Che from Korda's film.]]
During the rally, Korda took pictures of Cuban dignitaries and famous French [[existentialism|existentialist]] philosophers [[Jean-Paul Sartre]] and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], both admirers of Guevara at the time. Included in the film roll were shots of all the speakers and two pictures of Che's brief appearance. The classic picture appears on frame number 40 shot horizontally.&lt;ref&gt;[http://emiliobrizzi.blogspot.com/2007/02/el-guerrillero-heroico-1960.html "El Guerrillero Heroico (1960)"] by Emilio Brizzi, On Photography And More, February 5, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The first photograph had Guevara framed alone between the silhouette of [[Jorge Masetti]] and a palm tree; the second with someone's head appearing above his shoulder. The first picture, with the intruding material cropped out and the image rotated slightly, became Guevara's most famous portrait. The editor of ''Revolución'' where Korda worked, decided to use only his shots of Castro, Sartre, and Beauvoir, while sending the Che shot back to Korda. Believing the image was powerful, Korda made a cropped version for himself, which he enlarged and hung on his wall next to a portrait of the Chilean poet [[Pablo Neruda]],&lt;ref name="LAHT50"&gt;[http://www.laht.com/article.asp?ArticleId=353283&amp;CategoryId=14510 Iconic Photo of Che Guevara Now Half a Century Old] by the ''[[Latin American Herald Tribune]]'', March 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; and also gave copies to some others as a gift. It was not until 1986 that José Figueroa, an established photographer in his own right who printed for Korda and was his unofficially "adopted" son, suggested they try printing the full frame version of the portrait. Korda continued to print both versions of the image up until his death.&lt;ref name="introduction2005"&gt;[http://www.cmp.ucr.edu/exhibitions/che/essay_002.htm Introduction: Korda's Che Moves Out into the World] by Trisha Ziff, January 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leica M2 Summicron 35.jpg|230px|right|thumb|Leica M2]]

To take the photograph, Korda used a [[Leica Camera|Leica]] [[Leica M2|M2]] with a 90&amp;nbsp;mm lens, loaded with [[Kodak]] [[Kodak Plus-X|Plus-X]] pan film. In speaking about the method, Korda remarked that "this photograph is not the product of knowledge or technique. It was really coincidence, pure luck."&lt;ref name="ArtH"&gt;[http://www.arthistoryarchive.com/arthistory/photography/Alberto-Korda.html Alberto Korda at The Art History Archive] by Brandi Leigh, November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alberto Korda ==

As a lifelong [[communist]] and supporter of the [[Cuban Revolution]] until his death, [[Alberto Korda]] claimed no payment for his picture. A modified version of the portrait through the decades was also reproduced on a range of different media, though Korda never asked for [[royalties]]. Korda reasoned that Che's image represented his revolutionary ideals, and thus the more his picture spread the greater the chance Che's ideals would spread as well. Korda's refusal to seek royalties for the vast circulation of his photograph "helped it become the ultimate symbol of Marxist revolution and anti-imperialist struggle."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2010/03/che-guevara-alberto-korda Cuba, 5 March 1960: Alberto Korda] by Ian K Smith, ''[[New Statesman]]'', April 1, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Korda did not want commercialization of the image in relation to products he believed Guevara would not support, especially alcohol. This belief was displayed for the first time in 2000, when in response to [[Smirnoff]] using Che's picture in a vodka commercial, Korda claimed his [[Moral rights (copyright law)|moral rights]] (a form of [[copyright law]]) and sued advertising agency Lowe Lintas and Rex Features, the company that supplied the photograph.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/aug/07/cuba.mattwells After 40 Years and Millions of Posters, Che's Photographer Sues for Copyright] by Matt Wells, ''[[The Guardian]]'', August 7, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; Lintas and Rex claimed that the image was in the [[public domain]]. The final result was an out of court settlement for USD $50,000 to Korda,&lt;ref&gt;Ariana Hernández-Reguant, Copyrighting Che: Art and Authorship under Cuban Late Socialism, Public Culture 2004 v. 16 pp. 1–30. pg 4&lt;/ref&gt; which he donated to the Cuban healthcare system, stating "if Che was still alive, he would have done the same."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.companeroche.com/index.php?id=90 Cuba's Che Photographer Korda Dies in Paris] by Andrew Cawthorne, ''[[Reuters]]'', May 25, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

After the settlement, Korda reiterated that he was not against its propagation altogether, telling reporters:

{{quote|"As a supporter of the ideals for which Che Guevara died, I am not averse to its reproduction by those who wish to propagate his memory and the cause of social justice throughout the world, but I am categorically against the exploitation of Che's image for the promotion of products such as alcohol, or for any purpose that denigrates the reputation of Che."&lt;ref name="findarticles.com" /&gt; }}

== Giangiacomo Feltrinelli ==
Passed out to the occasional friend and published in a few small Cuban publications, Che's image remained relatively unknown for 7 years. A print was sold or given to wealthy Italian publisher and intellectual [[Giangiacomo Feltrinelli]] in 1967. Feltrinelli had just returned from Bolivia where he had hoped his fame would help in negotiating the release of French journalist and professor [[Régis Debray]]. Debray had been arrested in Bolivia in connection with guerrilla operations led by [[Che Guevara]]. As Guevara's eventual capture or death appeared to be imminent with the CIA closing in on his whereabouts, Feltrinelli acquired the rights to publish Che's captured Bolivian Diary. At this time Feltrinelli asked Cuban officials where to obtain Guevara images and was directed to Korda's studio where he presented a letter of introduction from the government. The document asked for Korda's assistance in finding a good portrait of Che. Korda knew right away that his favorite image of Che was perfect and pointed to the 1960 shot of Che hanging on the wall, saying that the photograph was the best of those he had taken of Che. Feltrinelli agreed and ordered 2 prints. When he returned the next day to pick them up Korda told him that because he was a friend of the revolution he did not have to pay.

Upon his return to Italy, Feltrinelli disseminated thousands of copies of the poster to raise awareness of Che's precarious situation and impending demise. Later in 1967 after his October 9, 1967 execution, Che's ''Bolivian Diary'' with Korda's photograph on the cover was released worldwide. Feltrinelli also created posters to promote the book, crediting the copyright to (c) Libreria Feltrinelli 1967 (in the lower left hand corner of the image) with no mention of Korda.&lt;ref name="introduction2005" /&gt; By this time, Korda's image had officially entered the public consciousness. Alberto Korda later expounded that if Feltrinelli had paid him just one lira for each reproduction, that he would have received millions. However, Korda also expressed that he forgave him, because through his actions, the image became famous.&lt;ref name="timeskordaobit" /&gt;

=== Milan 1967 ===
Feltrinelli's version of the image was used in October 1967 in [[Milan]], Italy, when spontaneous protests occurred in response to the news of Che's death. Italian photographer Giorgio Mondolfo later stated that "the first time I saw the picture by Alberto Korda, I was not even slightly interested in the author. I was only fifteen, and it was the picture that had drawn us – many for the first time – to gather in the streets, crying ''Che lives!''"&lt;ref&gt;The 150th Anniversary of Photography catalogue, an exhibition curated by Guiliana Scimè, Pier Paolo Pasolini, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Paris Match'' ===
''Guerrillero Heroico'' also appeared in the August 1967 issue of ''[[Paris Match]]''. Published only a few months before his eventual capture and execution, the issue featured a major article titled "Les Guerrilleros" by journalist Jean Lartéguy. Lartéguy wrote "At a time when Cuban revolutionaries want to create [[Vietnam War|Vietnams]] all over the world, the Americans run the risk of finding their own [[Algerian War|Algeria]] in Latin America."&lt;ref name="revolutionary19"&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 19&lt;/ref&gt; The article ended by asking "Where is Che Guevara?" The caption of the photograph read "The official photograph of Che Guevara; on his beret the star, the symbol of the Comandante."&lt;ref name="revolutionary19" /&gt; It is not known who provided the magazine with the image, and it was also not credited to Feltrinelli. However, with its wide circulation throughout Europe, and its status as an influential news journal, ''Paris Match'' could also be viewed as one of the original purveyors of the image.

=== Riots ===
During the [[May 1968 in France|May 1968 Paris student riots]], which eventually shook the [[Charles de Gaulle|de Gaulle]] government (but did not overthrow it), organizer [[Daniel Cohn-Bendit|"Danny The Red"]] utilized Fitzpatrick's rendition of Che during the protests. At this time, Che's image was picked up by the Dutch anarchist group [[Provo (movement)|"The Provos"]] in Amsterdam, who focused on triggering violent responses from authorities through non-violent means.

== Jim Fitzpatrick ==
[[File:FitzpatrickChe.jpg|thumb|left|upright|The original 1968 stylized image created by Jim Fitzpatrick.]]

In 1967, Irish artist [[Jim Fitzpatrick (artist)|Jim Fitzpatrick]] was also using Korda's image as a basis for creating his own stylized posters.  Fitzpatrick claims he received a copy of the photograph from the Dutch anarchist group "the [[Provo (movement)|Provos]]", who produced a magazine bearing the group's name. Fitzpatrick remembers that Provo magazine claimed the image originally came to Europe via [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Fitzpatrick's source of the image, then, would not have been Feltrinelli.&lt;ref name="introduction2005" /&gt;

{{quote|"The first image I did of Che was psychedelic, it looks like he is in seaweed. His hair was not hair, it was shapes that I felt gave it an extra dimension. That was the image I produced for the magazine and that was done before he died and that is the important thing about that image. At first it did not print. It was considered far too strong and revolutionary. I was very inspired by Che's trip to Bolivia. He went there with the intent to overthrow the intensely corrupt government, helped by the Americans at the time, and that's where he died. I thought he was one of the greatest men who ever lived and I still do in many ways. And when he was murdered, I decided I wanted to do something about it, so I created the poster. I felt this image had to come out, or he would not be commemorated otherwise, he would go where heroes go, which is usually into anonymity."| Jim Fitzpatrick, 2005&lt;ref name="aleksandramir.info" /&gt;}}

To create the image Fitzpatrick made a paper negative on a piece of equipment called a grant. They were then printed in one color black and one color red, and he handpainted the star in yellow. Fitzpatrick "wanted the image to breed like rabbits" and hand printed thousands of images to give away to anyone for free in London, in addition to getting friends to pass them out while encouraging others to make their own versions. He printed about a hundred copies at a time to fulfill the demand of political groups in Ireland, France, and the Netherlands who began requesting the image. A batch was also sent to Spain, where they were seized by [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]'s police.

Because of the high demand, Fitzpatrick formed a poster company called ''Two Bear Feet'' and produced a variety of posters in 1967 using the Korda image. All of them were created without copyright, because Fitzpatrick wanted them to be reproduced. One of these posters would be published in the satirical magazine ''[[Private Eye]]''. The best-known was printed on silver foil and was exhibited in an exhibition in London called "Viva Che" at the Arts Laboratory, curated by Peter Meyer. This show was originally to be held at the [[Lisson Gallery]] in 1968 and illustrates how fast the image moved from protest into the realm of fine art.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 21&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of Fitzpatrick's desire for the photograph to reflect something of himself, he raised Che's eyes more and added his initial, a reversed "F" on the shoulder. It was not until the 40th anniversary of Che's death that Fitzpatrick admitted to this fact stating "I’m a bit mischievous, so I never told anyone."&lt;ref name="webstudio.ie"&gt;Artist reveals his guerrilla tactics with iconic image’s secret mark, by Web Studio Ireland, October 9, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; At this time Fitzpatrick said that "I love the picture and wherever I am in the world, if I see it, I take a photo of it. I always have a chuckle when I see that little 'F'. I know that it's mine."&lt;ref name="webstudio.ie" /&gt; In November 2008, Fitzpatrick announced that he would be signing over the copyright of his Che image to the William Soler Pediatric Cardiology Hospital in Havana, Cuba. In announcing his reason for ensuring all future proceeds would go to the children's hospital, Fitzpatrick stated that "Cuba trains doctors and then sends them around the world … I want their medical system to benefit." Additionally, Fitzpatrick publicized his desire to gift the original artwork to the archive run by Guevara's widow, Aleida March.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2008/nov/30/the-diary-ken-sweeney-che-and-share-alike-says-jim/ The Diary, Ken Sweeney – Che and Share Alike, says Jim] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081207122042/http://www.tribune.ie/news/home-news/article/2008/nov/30/the-diary-ken-sweeney-che-and-share-alike-says-jim/ |date=2008-12-07 }} November 30, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Meeting Guevara in Ireland ===

According to Fitzpatrick, in 1963 while a teenage student at [[Gormanston College]] he worked a summer job at the Marine Hotel pub in [[Kilkee]], the remote town of his mother's birth. One morning Che Guevara walked in with two Cubans and ordered an Irish whiskey. Fitzpatrick immediately recognized him because of his interest in the [[Cuban Revolution]]. Knowing about the [[Irish settlement in Argentina|Irish diaspora and history in Argentina]], Fitzpatrick asked Che vaguely about his roots. Che told Fitzpatrick that his grandmother was Irish and that his great-grandmother, Isabel, was from [[Galway]], with other family being from [[County Cork|Cork]].

}}

Guevara's father also bore the Irish surname "[[Lynch (surname)|Lynch]]." Fitzpatrick describes Che as "curious" about Ireland "from a revolutionary point of view" and remarks that Che proclaimed his "great admiration" for the fact that, in his view, Ireland was the first country to "shake off the shackles of the British Empire".&lt;ref name="aleksandramir.info"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aleksandramir.info/texts/fitzpatrick.html |title=A phone conversation between Aleksandra Mir and Jim Fitzpatrick, (Dublin), January 3, 2005 |publisher=Aleksandramir.info |date= |accessdate=2011-03-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110316155355/http://www.aleksandramir.info/texts/fitzpatrick.html |archivedate=March 16, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Apparently Che was stranded on an overnight flight from Moscow to [[Cuba]], and had touched down at [[Shannon Airport]], where the Soviet airline ''[[Aeroflot]]'' had a refueling base. Unable to depart because of thick fog, Che and his accompanying Cubans took the day off for an "unofficial" visit. It was this experience, according to Fitzpatrick, that gave him the impetus to follow the future actions of Che, including his ill-fated mission to Bolivia.&lt;ref name="aleksandramir.info" /&gt;

In December 2008, Jim Fitzpatrick, along with local historian Anne Holliday and the [[Shannon Development]], announced plans to commemorate Guevara's visit to Ireland, and specifically his time spent in [[Limerick]]. Early plans are focused on an exhibition of Guevara's visit at the City Museum, followed by the creation of a "permanent mark" symbolizing his time spent at Hanratty Hotel's – White House pub in [[Shannon, County Clare|Shannonside]]. Fitzpatrick defended the move by remarking "we want to commemorate the fact Che Guevara spent some very important hours of his life here … this probably was Che's last hurrah."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.limerickleader.ie/features/Marking-Che-Guevaras-Limerick-link.4763656.jp Marking Che Guevara's Limerick Link] ''Limerick Leader'', December 4, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sinn Féin]] president [[Gerry Adams]] is interviewed in the 2008 documentary ''Chevolution'' about the famous photograph. As he speaks, the film shows a montage of Che murals in [[Belfast]], with Adams remarking "I suppose people from my background were drawn to that image, because of what Che Guevara represented."&lt;ref name="IrishC" /&gt;

== Cuba ==
[[File:SculptureCheGuevaraCuba.jpg|thumb|right|Plaza de la Revolución – in Havana, Cuba]]

Cuban historian Edmundo Desnoes has stated that "Che's image may be cast aside, bought and sold and deified, but it will form a part of the universal system of the revolutionary struggle, and can recover its original meaning at any moment."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.q-news.com/367-ShaykhChe.html "Shaykh Che Guevara"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080507121101/http://www.q-news.com/367-ShaykhChe.html |date=2008-05-07 }} Q-News, July 2006, Issue 367, pg 80&lt;/ref&gt; That meaning's origin harkens back to when Korda's photograph was first published on April 16, 1961, in the daily Cuban newspaper ''Revolución'', advertising a noon conference during which the main speaker was "Dr. Ernesto 'Che' Guevara." The conference was disrupted however, when 1,300 CIA-supported counter-revolutionaries stormed the beaches of Cuba, in what became known as the failed [[Bay of Pigs invasion]]. The image was thus republished a second time advertising the newly convened conference on April 28, 1961. Because of this fact, it seems very likely that in the context of both of these publications, that Che could have seen the photograph that would later contribute to his iconic status.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 16&lt;/ref&gt;

The very first time Cubans on a large scale became familiar with the photograph, despite its earlier reproduction in ''Revolución'', was on hearing the news of Che's death. Upon the news of Che's execution, it was enlarged and draped on a banner down the five-story building of the Ministry of the Interior in the [[Plaza de la Revolución]] in [[Havana]]. This building where Che himself had formerly worked, served as a backdrop to [[Fidel Castro|Fidel's]] eulogy on October 18, 1967, publicly acknowledging the death of Che Guevara before a crowd of over a million mourners. José Gómez Fresquet, renowned Cuban poster maker and graphic artist, recalls how on hearing the news of Guevara's death, he immediately worked all night producing the poster to be used at the rally honoring him the next day. Korda had given Fresquet a copy of the portrait as a basis for the poster, which he created on red paper. This was the first privately produced ''Guerrillero Heroico'' to be created in Cuba. Since then the building has seen many versions of the image, and today a permanent steel outline, derived from the photograph, adorns the building.&lt;ref name="revolutionary19" /&gt;

== The United States and fame ==
''Guerrillero Heroico'' made its American debut in 1968 on [[New York City Subway]] billboards, when the image appeared in painted form by [[Paul Brooks Davis|Paul Davis]], for a poster advertising the February issue of [[Evergreen Review]].&lt;ref name="Ziff 2006 pg 22"&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 22&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Davis has stated that he was "inspired by Italian paintings of martyred saints and Christ", in his romanticised version of Che.&lt;ref name="Ziff 2006 pg 22" /&gt;

However, the fascination was not solely an American phenomenon. For instance, British journalist [[Richard Gott]] who met with Che Guevara several times expressed a similar view, by stating how he was "struck by his magnetic physical attraction, comparable to the aura of a rock star." In Gott's opinion "almost everyone had the same impression, and journalists were particularly susceptible."&lt;ref name="thehindu2006"&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2006/06/05/stories/2006060506501100.htm The story of the iconic image of Che Guevara] by Richard Gott, ''The Hindu'', June 5, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, in an August 8, 1960, cover story after meeting with Guevara displayed this view, by remarking that Che wore "a smile of melancholy sweetness that many women find devastating."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/printout/0,8816,869742,00.html Castro's Brain] by ''[[Time magazine]]'', August 8, 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Argentina|Argentine]] journalist Julia Costenlos, recalls that in her view he was "blessed with a unique appeal, an incalculable enchantment that came completely naturally."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2006/jun/03/art.art "Poster Boy"] by Richard Gott, The Guardian, June 3, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Indian Ambassador K Gajendra Singh, posted in 1965 as a young diplomat in [[Algiers]], recalls his own similar personal encounter with meeting Guevara; describing him as "indisputably the dazzling star of the show" and compared shaking his hand at an economic seminar to "getting an autograph of a celebrity." According to Singh, Che's "charismatic presence in green olive fatigues and black beret" at the time embodied "the very best of the Hollywood and Bollywood stars all rolled into one"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globalresearch.ca/index.php?context=va&amp;aid=9324 A Meeting with Che Guevara] by K Gajendra Singh, Global Research, June 14, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Even under duress, ''[[The Times]]'' journalist Henry Brandon, who spoke with Guevara at the height of the [[Cuban missile crisis]], remarked that Che possessed a "genial charm" that "might have made [[Charles Boyer]] envious."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/us_and_americas/article5062895.ece From the archive: Attack us at your peril, cocky Cuba warns US] ''Times'' Online, November 2, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In judging the enduring appeal of the image, Darrel Couturier, representative for Korda since 1997, has opined that it was "the image of a very dashing young man" and that in the "age of free love and flower power … the time was ripe for a figure" or "image that could represent this great diversity in thinking and behavior the world over." According to Couturier, this "age of religious revolution", matched with Guevara's premature death, "elevated him to almost [[martyrdom]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=156339 ‘Korda’s Che from Revolution to Icon’ travels to İstanbul] by Rumeysa Kiger, ''Today's Zaman'', October 20, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|"When you look closely, you can see that many iconic photographs are constructed in the same way; it is possible to copy the formula. Look at some of the most enduring images of our age … Like Che, they are shot from below against a light background, giving them a raised, Godlike quality. The angle of the shot is particularly crucial, as profiles have little impact and full frontals tend to flatten the features. The direction and intensity of the subject's gaze is also key. Che is looking past the camera, out to his vision. His line of vision has been much tinkered with by various artists, but it retains its passion even on a table mat or a screensaver. An image like this is about a sign: it's a shorthand. This particular one now stands for opposition to the establishment, freedom and revolution."| [[Alison Jackson]], photographer and filmmaker &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newstatesman.com/print/200606120036 Che: The Artists View] by [[Alison Jackson]], ''[[New Statesman]]'', June 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As pop artists took to the image with glee, it evolved into a popular and heavily commercialized icon that often strayed far from Che’s hard-line [[Marxist]] message.&lt;ref name="WSJ2010" /&gt; British [[pop artist]] [[Peter Blake (artist)|Sir Peter Blake]] has referred to ''Guerrillero Heroico'' as "one of the great icons of the 20th century."&lt;ref name="guardian2004"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/film/2004/jul/11/features.review Just a Pretty Face?] by Sean O'Hagan, ''The Observer'', July 11, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;  When converted into a stark black cut-out, Korda's photograph became easy, cheap, and fast to copy using the favored material and method of the 1960s: lith film and screen painting.&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 42&lt;/ref&gt; By the time of his death in 1967, Che was already "a legend, the romantic epitome of worldwide rebellion" and in the wake of his perceived martyrdom, Korda's photograph went viral.&lt;ref name="Alook"&gt;A look at Che Guevara through the Lens of his Iconic Image, by Robert W.

According to the [[Victoria and Albert Museum|V&amp;A Museum]], "the photograph enshrines Che as a mythic hero. Taken from below, the revolutionary leader with searching eyes and resolute expression becomes larger than life. A perspective that dominates the imagery of social realism, it bears an irresistible aura of authority, independence and defiance."&lt;ref name="va" /&gt; The V&amp;A Museum goes on to state that Korda's famous photograph first [[Apotheosis|deified]] Che and turned him into an [[icon]] of [[radical chic]]. Its story, a complex mesh of conflicting narratives, gave ''Guerrillero Heroico'' a life of its own, an enduring fascination independent of Che himself.&lt;ref name="va" /&gt; The Italian magazine ''Skime'' evokes even more praise, decreeing it "absolutely the most famous of history" while proclaiming that it "captures beauty and youth, courage and generosity, aesthetic and moral virtues of a person who possessed all the characteristics necessary to be converted into a symbol of an [[Epoch (reference date)|epoch]] like ours, lacking in historic legends and mythic incarnations."&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 41&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Richard Gott]] has also remarked that "the red star in Che's beret was up there with '[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]].{{' "}}&lt;ref name="thehindu2006" /&gt; Jonathan Green, director of the [[University of California Riverside|UCR]] photography museum, has remarked that "pop art is a rejection of traditional figuration, rhetoric, and rendition. Its egalitarian anti-art stance was the perfect corollary for Che's anti-establishment attitude."&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 75&lt;/ref&gt;

Fitzpatrick's graphic was later used in a 1968 painting attributed to [[Andy Warhol]] and sold to a gallery in Rome. The painting used the same graphic processes used on the acclaimed [[Marilyn Monroe]] pieces. However this painting was a forgery, created by [[Gerard Malanga]] who was in need of money. When Warhol heard of the fraud, he "authenticated" the fake, provided that all the money from sales went to him.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdon, David. ''"Warhol"''. Harry N. Abrams Inc, 1989 pg 291&lt;/ref&gt;

Its presence, everywhere from Belfast to Soweto, or from walls in the Palestinian territories to Parisian boutiques, makes it an image that is out of control.

Journalist Michael Casey, in his 2009 book ''Che's Afterlife: The Legacy of an Image'', notes how the universal image can be found "in all corners of the world" and theorizes that it arrived as a symbol of rebellion during an era when the world was aching for change.&lt;ref name="CNNCasey" /&gt; In defining Korda's photograph as a "brand" and "quintessential post-modern icon", Casey notes that somehow the photograph encapsulates "hope and beauty," which causes people around the globe to "invest their dreams in it."&lt;ref name="CNNCasey" /&gt; While David Kunzle, author of the book ''Che Guevara: Icon, Myth, and Message'', has opined that "The [[beret]] functions subliminally as a flattened [[Halo (religious iconography)|halo]]."&lt;ref&gt;"Che Guevara: Revolutionary &amp; Icon", by Trisha Ziff, Abrams Image, 2006, pg 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Trisha Ziff, the curator of ''Che!

For decades the famous image was unhindered by [[international copyright agreements]], because Cuba was not a signatory to the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne Convention]]. [[Fidel Castro]] described it as a "[[bourgeois]] concept" which meant that artists and advertisers were free to use Korda’s work as they pleased.&lt;ref name="WSJ2010"&gt;[https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2010/03/05/che-the-birthday-of-a-revolutionary-brand/ Che: The Birthday of a Revolutionary Brand] by Michael J.

Despite conflicting claims about whether or not the image could have copyright established, Korda's children have sought to control commercial use of the image from [[defamation]]. Korda's daughter Diana Diaz pursued a 2003 lawsuit in France against a Paris-based press rights group [[Reporters Without Borders]], for using the Che photograph in a poster campaign decrying Cuba as "the world's largest jail", aimed at dissuading French tourists from vacationing in Cuba after the jailing of 29 dissident journalists.&lt;ref name="commondreams2005"&gt;Reuters,

Ariana Hernández-Reguant addressed the image's copyright status in 2004 in her article ''Copyrighting Che: Art and Authorship under Cuban Late Socialism''. She expressed a skeptical view towards Korda's heirs being able to establish ownership over the image, noting in reference to the lawsuits involving the image, "There was never any official ruling on whether the depiction constituted a violation of copyright." The author goes on to state that: "Korda took the picture while working for a state-run newspaper, his actual property rights would be questionable under both Cuban and international law."&lt;ref&gt;Hernandez-Reguant, Ariana.

In 2007, law student Sarah Levy also addressed the potential legal status of the image in Cuba. It was her ultimate contention that "in Cuba the copyright protection in Korda's Guevara photograph would have already expired, and despite the claims of ownership from Korda's heirs, the State would now hold any rights associated with the photograph."&lt;ref name="revolution2007"&gt;''"A Copyright Revolution: Protecting the Famous Photograph of Che Guevara"'', by Sarah Levy, 13 Law and Business Review of the Americas, Am. 687. Summer of 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to the more commonly disseminated stylized version of the photograph, lawyers say it will be an uphill struggle to deter non-photographic use of such a widely reproduced image, other than in countries like Italy where laws protect image rights.&lt;ref name="commondreams2005" /&gt;

Guevara's heirs also believe they have legal justification to prevent the image's "exploitation" or [[slander]]. Guevara's Cuban widow Aleida March stated in 2005 that "We have a plan to deal with the misuse. We can't attack everyone with lances like Don Quixote, but we can try to maintain the ethics of Guevara's legacy."&lt;ref name="commondreams2005" /&gt; In reference to this pronouncement, Guevara's daughter [[Aleida Guevara]] told [[Reuters]], "It will be costly and difficult because each country has different laws, but a limit has to be drawn."&lt;ref name="commondreams2005" /&gt; However, the family has not yet mounted any court challenges, and no determination of legal copyright internationally has been established.

{{History of printing}}

The '''hectograph''', '''gelatin duplicator''' or '''jellygraph''' is a [[printing]] process that involves transfer of an original, prepared with special inks, to a pan of [[gelatin]] or a gelatin pad pulled tight on a metal frame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/hectograph|title=Hectograph - Definition of hectograph by Merriam-Webster|work=merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the original use of the technology has diminished, it has recently been revived for use in the art world. The hectograph has been modernized and made practical for anyone to use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7htAoISU9x8|title=Sophie (age 5) doing a gelli print tutorial}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

===Master===
The special [[aniline]] dyes for making the master image came in the form of [[ink]] or in pens, pencils, carbon paper and even [[typewriter ribbon]]. Hectograph pencils and pens are sometimes still available. Various other inks have been found usable to varying degrees in the process; master sheets for [[spirit duplicator]]s have also been pressed into service. Unlike a spirit duplicator master, a hectograph master is not a mirror image. Thus, when using a spirit duplicator master with a hectograph, one writes on the back of the purple sheet, using it like carbon paper to produce an image on the white sheet, rather than writing on the front of the white sheet to produce a mirror image on its back.

===Gelatin image===
The master is placed on the gelatin and spirits applied to transfer the ink from the master to the gelatin.

===Copies===
After transfer of the image to the inked gelatin surface, copies are made by pressing paper against it.

===Cleanup ===
When a pad ceased to be useful, the gelatin could be soaked with spirits, the ink sponged away, and the pad left clean for the next master.

===Storage===
A grey-colored, thick, absorbent paper pad was supplied to cover the gelatin surface for storage. This also removed ink from the surface, but it took many hours to do so. Care needed to be taken that the gelatin surface was kept clean, and not damaged (e.g. by [[fingernail]]s) during duplicating.

The gelatin process produced print runs of somewhere between 20 and 80 copies, depending upon the skill of the user and the quality of the original. At least eight different colors of hectographic ink were available at one time, but purple was the most popular because of its density and contrast.

Hectography, requiring limited technology and leaving few traces behind, has been deemed useful both in low-technology environments and in clandestine circumstances where discretion was necessary. In the earlier 20th century, the process lent itself to small runs of school classroom test papers, church newsletters and [[science fiction fanzine]]s. Prisoners-of-war at [[Stalag Luft III]] (the scene of The Great Escape)&lt;ref&gt; Paul Brickhill's eyewitness account inaccurately describes the process as a mimeograph&lt;/ref&gt; and at [[Colditz Castle]] during [[World War II]] used an improvised hectograph to reproduce documents for a planned [[Colditz Castle/List of Colditz Castle escape attempts|escape attempt]].

The [[Communist Party of China|Communist authorities]] in the [[Jiangsu]]-[[Anhui]] Border Area of [[China]] used the process for postage stamps in November 1948, produced in sheets of 35, with 13 $50 values, six $100, twelve $200, two $300 and two $500 values.&lt;ref&gt;[[Stanley Gibbons]] [[Stanley Gibbons catalogue|Stamp Catalogue]] Part 17&lt;/ref&gt;

It has also been used, though not very extensively, as an artistic medium in [[printmaking]]. The [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futurists]] used it for book illustrations, and the [[German Expressionism|German expressionist]] [[Emil Nolde]] made four hectographs.

[[Stephen King]], in his book ''[[On Writing: A Memoir of the Craft|On Writing]]'', writes of how he and his elder brother Dave used the process to create their newspaper, ''Dave's Rag''.

It was also used in professional situations; in [[Macy's]] advertising department during the 1950s and 1960s, full-page newspaper ad layouts were drawn with hectograph pencils and then duplicated on a hectograph to make file copies for future reference. Before the popularization of [[spirit duplicator]]s and the [[mimeograph]], there were mechanized hectography machines that used a drum, rather than a simple flat tray of gelatin.

In the final chapters of ''[[The Pothunters]]'' by [[P. G. Wodehouse]] the major characters use a jellygraph to produce a school magazine at very short notice. Wodehouse assumes his reader knows exactly what a jellygraph is and alludes to its being unattractive: "This jelly business makes one beastly sticky. I think we'll keep to print in future."

[[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Keep the Aspidistra Flying]]'' (1936) describes a somewhat more subversive schoolboy publication:

{{quote|"And at that moment, in the years just after the War, England was so full of revolutionary opinion that even the public schools were infected by it. The young, even those who had been too young to fight, were in a bad temper with their elders, as well they might be; practically everyone with any brains at all was for the moment a revolutionary. Meanwhile the old—those over sixty, say—were running in circles like hens, squawking about "subversive ideas". Gordon and his friends had quite an exciting time with their "subversive ideas". For a whole year they ran an unofficial monthly paper called the ''Bolshevik'', duplicated with a jellygraph. It advocated Socialism, free love, the dismemberment of the British Empire, the abolition of the Army and Navy, and so on and so forth. It was great fun. Every intelligent boy of sixteen is a Socialist. At that age one does not see the hook sticking out of the rather stodgy bait." &lt;ref&gt;George Orwell (1936) ''Keep the Aspidistra Flying''&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Current uses==
While the hectograph process is obsolete for printing on paper, it is still used for making [[temporary tattoos]] on human skin. Tattoo artists use hectograph pencils to draw pictures on paper and then transfer them to the recipient's skin.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}}

It is also used to create unique acrylic paint prints. The gelatine hectograph has been commercialized by Joan Bess and Lou Ann Gleason.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gelliarts.com/pages/about-us|title=About Us|work=gelliarts.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hectograph has been plasticized, and made more resilient. Recipes are available on the web, to create a plate from common household substances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://calligraphycards-shazinoz.blogspot.com/2013/05/how-to-make-gelli-plate-or-jelly-pad.html|title=Calligraphy   Cards - Shaz in Oz: How to make a Gelli Plate or Jelly pad? + WOYWW4|author=Shaz in Oz.CalligraphyCards|work=calligraphycards-shazinoz.blogspot.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The basic printing technique is simple. One spreads paint over the plate with a brayer, lays a sheet of paper over the paint, rubs the back of the paper a bit and pulls it up. The wet paint adheres to the paper. The interest and uniqueness of the prints comes in by the marks made in the paint before laying the paper down.

The materials used for printing on are almost as limitless. Any paper can be used. Fabric, plastic/acetate sheets, different types of tape, cardboard, wooden boards, sheet metal, almost anything that paint will stick to can be used. The prints are used in many different artistic applications.

== Background ==

=== Creation ===
In Judy Chicago's autobiography, ''Beyond the Flower'', she discusses initiating the International Quilting Bee, stating that "people would be invited to submit their triangular quilts. . .honoring women of their own determination. By doing this, I intended to provide an opportunity for community participation and also to counter another criticism that had emerged, this time about my choices of women."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Beyond the Flower: The Autobiography of a Feminist Artist|last=Chicago|first=Judy|publisher=Penguin Group|year=1996|isbn=0-670-85295-3|location=New York|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Community collaboration ===
Individual Quilt panels were often created by groups of women after viewing or hearing about Chicago's ''Dinner Party'' . For example, a group from the Chrysallis Center at [[Saginaw Valley State University]], Michigan, visited the Dinner Party exhibition in Chicago in 1981. Returning to Saginaw via bus that evening, they decided they needed to create a quilt panel and submit it to the project.  Under the leadership of Rosalie (Riegle) Troester,  an English instructor at the University, and Trish Nowicke, Campus Minister, a group of fourteen students created a multicolored butterfly wing ([http://digital.library.louisville.edu/cdm/compoundobject/collection/ihq/id/1178/rec/1 IQB-352]) representing the growth stage it symbolizes as well as the student career counseling and  support center of which they were members. They completed the project and forwarded their creation to Through the Flower for display in the next Dinner Party venue, [[Montreal]].&lt;ref name="washingtontimes.com"/&gt;

== Description ==
The ''International Honor Quilt'' is a collection of 539 panels of triangular quilts honoring women, women's organizations, and women's issues.&lt;ref&gt;"Extending the Spirit of The Dinner Party: The International Honor Quilt," University of Louisville, Hite Art Institute, 2015 (brochure)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir John Kenneth Tavener''' (28 January 1944 – 12 November 2013) was an English composer, known for his extensive output of religious works, including ''[[The Protecting Veil]]'', ''[[Song for Athene]]'' and ''[[The Lamb (Tavener)|The Lamb]]''.

Tavener first came to prominence with his cantata ''[[The Whale (Tavener)|The Whale]]'', premiered in 1968. Then aged 24, he was described by ''[[The Guardian]]'' as "the musical discovery of the year",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Meirion Bowen|title=Two Tavener Works at the Queen Elizabeth Hall |url= https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/12/john-tavener-guardian-review|work=[[The Guardian]]| origyear=13 June 1968 |date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; while ''[[The Times]]'' said he was "among the very best creative talents of his generation."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rockian.biz/linn/ckd378.htm Linn Records: "Carmina Celtica: Canty"]&lt;/ref&gt; During his career he became one of the best known and popular composers of his generation, most particularly for ''The Protecting Veil'', which as recorded by cellist [[Steven Isserlis]] became a bestselling album, and ''Song for Athene'' which was sung at the [[Funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales|funeral of Princess Diana]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; ''The Lamb'' featured in the soundtrack for [[Paolo Sorrentino]]'s film ''[[The Great Beauty]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://janusfilms.com/thegreatbeauty/ |title=Janus Films presents The Great Beauty (La Grande Bellezza) |publisher=Janusfilms.com |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavener was [[British honours system|knight]]ed in 2000 for his services to music and won an [[Ivor Novello Award]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://technology.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/tech_and_web/gadgets_and_gaming/article6991720.ece|title=Not just a blip: Ivor Novello awards to recognise computer game music |author=Adam Sherwin|date=18 January 2010|work=The Times|accessdate=12 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==

Tavener was born on 28 January 1944 in [[Wembley]], London.&lt;ref&gt;David Mason. ''Greene's biographical encyclopedia of composers''. Doubleday, 1995. 31. {{ISBN|0-385-14278-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents ran a family building firm&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; and his father was also an organist at St Andrew's Presbyterian Church in [[Frognal]], [[Hampstead]].&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Ivan Moody.

Retrieved 13 November 2013 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 12, Tavener was taken to [[Glyndebourne]] to hear Mozart's ''[[The Magic Flute]]'', a work he loved for the rest of his life.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; That same year he heard Stravinsky’s most recent work, ''[[Canticum Sacrum]]'', which he later described as "the piece that woke me up and made me want to be a composer".&lt;ref name=telegraphobit&gt;{{cite news|title=Music Obituary: Sir John Tavener |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/culture-obituaries/music-obituaries/10444987/Sir-John-Tavener-obituary.html|work=[[The Daily Telegraph]]| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tavener became a music scholar at [[Highgate School]] (where a fellow pupil was [[John Rutter]]).&lt;ref name=White2013p29/&gt; The school choir was often employed by the BBC in works requiring boys' voices, so Tavener gained choral experience singing in Mahler's [[Symphony No. 3 (Mahler)|Third Symphony]] and Orff's ''[[Carmina Burana (Orff)|Carmina Burana]]''.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; He started to compose at Highgate, and also became a sufficiently proficient pianist to perform the second and third movements of Beethoven's [[Piano Concerto No. 4 (Beethoven)|Fourth Piano Concerto]] and, in 1961 with the [[National Youth Orchestra of Great Britain|National Youth Orchestra]], Shostakovich's [[Piano Concerto No. 2 (Shostakovich)|Piano Concerto No. 2]].&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; He also became organist and choirmaster in 1961 at St John's Presbyterian Church, Kensington (now St Mark's [[Coptic Orthodox]] Church),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stmark.org.uk/history/pre-1975-st-johns-presbyterian-church |title=Our History (Pre-1975) |publisher=Stmark.org.uk |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; a post he held for 14 years.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt;&lt;!-- the St Mark's website says "appointed in 1952" which is obviously wrong, as he was only 8 years old then --&gt;

Tavener entered the [[Royal Academy of Music]] in 1962, where his tutors included Sir [[Lennox Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit&gt;{{cite news|author=Michael J Stewart|title=Sir John Tavener obituary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2013/nov/12/john-tavener|work=The Guardian| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=12 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; During his studies there he decided to give up the piano and devote himself to composition.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt;

==''The Whale'' and early career==
Tavener first came to prominence in 1968 with his dramatic cantata ''The Whale'', based on the Old Testament story of [[Book of Jonah|Jonah]].&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; It was premièred at the [[London Sinfonietta]]'s début concert,&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; which was also the opening concert of the [[Queen Elizabeth Hall]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael White, "A Time for Reflection", ''[[BBC Music Magazine]]'', Vol. 22 No. 2 (December 2013), p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; Tavener's younger brother, Roger, was then doing some building work on [[Ringo Starr]]'s home and, gaining the musician's interest, persuaded [[the Beatles]] to have ''The Whale'' recorded by [[Apple Records]] and released in 1970.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; The following year Tavener began teaching at [[Trinity College of Music]], London.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Other works by Tavener released by Apple included his ''[[A Celtic Requiem]]'', which impressed [[Benjamin Britten]] enough to persuade [[Covent Garden]] to commission an opera from Tavener:&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; the ultimate result, to a libretto by playwright [[Gerard McLarnon]], was ''Thérèse''. When staged in 1979 the opera was thought too static to be a successful drama.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

Tavener had also been deeply affected by his brief 1974 marriage to the Greek dancer Victoria Maragopoulou.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; His chamber opera ''A Gentle Spirit'' (1977), with a libretto by McLarnon based on a story by [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]], concerns a pawnbroker whose marriage fails to the extent that his wife commits suicide. It has been deemed "far superior to ''Thérèse'', with the internal drama more suited to the stage".&lt;ref name= Guardianobit/&gt; Significantly, it also touched on [[Russian Orthodox Church|Russian Orthodoxy]], to which McLarnon had been a convert for several years.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

==Conversion to Orthodox Christianity==
Tavener converted to the Russian Orthodox Church in 1977.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;{{Failed verification|date=September 2015}}&lt;!--Ivan Moody's NG article does not specify whether the Orthodox Church to which Tavener converted was Russian, Greek, or some other variety.--&gt; Orthodox theology and liturgical traditions became a major influence on his work. He was particularly drawn to its [[mysticism]], studying and setting to music the writings of [[Church Fathers]] and completing a setting of the [[Divine Liturgy of St. John Chrysostom]], the principal eucharistic liturgy of the Orthodox Church: this was Tavener's first directly Orthodox-inspired music.&lt;ref name=nprobit&gt;{{cite news|author=Anastasia Tsioulcas|title=Remembering 'Holy Minimalist' Composer John Tavener |url= https://www.npr.org/blogs/deceptivecadence/2013/11/12/244788638/remembering-holy-minimalist-composer-john-tavener|work=[[NPR Music]]| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate=13 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later career==
[[File:William Blake - Songs of Innocence and Experience - The Lamb.jpg|thumb|200px| John Tavener's choral arrangement of [[William Blake]]'s "[[The Lamb]]" from his collection ''[[Songs of Innocence and of Experience]]'' is a continually popular work.

Essick, and Joseph Viscomi| accessdate = 26 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Tavener's subsequent explorations of Russian and Greek culture resulted in ''Akhmatova Requiem'': this failed to enjoy success either at its Edinburgh Festival premiere in 1981, or at its [[The Proms|Proms]]' performance the following week where many of the audience left before it finished.&lt;ref name=telegraphobit/&gt; Of more lasting success was Tavener's short unaccompanied four-part choral setting of [[William Blake]]'s poem "[[The Lamb]]", written one afternoon in 1982 for his nephew Simon's third birthday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicsalesclassical.com/composer/work/11167 |title=John Tavener - The Lamb (1982) |publisher=Music Sales Classical |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; This simple [[homophonic]] piece is usually performed as a [[Christmas carol]]. Later prominent works include ''The Akathist of Thanksgiving'' of 1987, written in celebration of the millennium of the Russian Orthodox Church; ''The Protecting Veil'', first performed by cellist Steven Isserlis and the [[London Symphony Orchestra]] at the 1989 Proms; and ''Song for Athene'' (1993). The two choral works were settings of texts by [[Mother Thekla]], a Russian Orthodox abbess who was Tavener's long-time spiritual adviser until her death in 2011.&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt; ''Song for Athene'' in particular gained worldwide exposure when performed at the [[funeral of Diana, Princess of Wales]] in 1997.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt;

Tavener's ''Fall and Resurrection'', first performed in 2000, used instruments such as [[Shofar|ram's horn]], [[Ney|ney flute]] and [[kaval]]. It was dedicated to the [[Charles, Prince of Wales|Prince of Wales]], with whom Tavener formed a lasting friendship.&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; In 2003 Tavener composed the exceptionally large work ''[[The Veil of the Temple]]'' (which was premièred at the [[Temple Church]], London), based on texts from a number of religions. Identified by Tavener as "the supreme achievement of my life",&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt; it is set for four choirs, several orchestras and soloists and lasts at least seven hours.&lt;ref name=White2013p29/&gt; ''Prayer of the Heart'', written for and performed by [[Björk]], was premiered in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|agency=Associated Press|title=John Tavener, composer and seeker, dies at 69 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2013/11/12/john-tavener-composer-and-seeker-dies-at-69/3508339/|work=[[USA Today]]| date=12 November 2013 |accessdate= 14 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 Tavener composed ''The Beautiful Names'', a setting of the 99 names of God in the Muslim tradition, sung in [[Arabic]].&lt;ref name=nprobit/&gt;

It had been reported, particularly in the British press, that Tavener left [[Orthodox Christianity]] to explore a number of other different religious traditions, including [[Hinduism]] and [[Islam]], and became a follower of the [[Traditionalist School|Traditionalist]] philosopher [[Frithjof Schuon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Morrison|title=99 Names for God: John Tavener Turns his Back on Orthodoxy|publisher=BBC Music|date=November 2004}}: p. 30.

The interviewer also reported at the time that he "hasn’t abandoned Orthodoxy. He remains devotedly Christian."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/06/17/arts/music/17whit.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin&amp;ref=music&amp;pagewanted=print&amp; |title=Christian Composer, Inspired by Allah's 99 Names |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |accessdate=28 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the [[BBC Four]] television programme ''Sacred Music'' in 2010, Tavener described himself as "essentially Orthodox".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b00rs3w2 ''Sacred Music''], series 2, episode 4, broadcast in the UK on [[BBC Four]] on 2 April 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; He reiterated both his desire to explore the musical traditions of other religions, and his adherence to the Orthodox Christian faith, on ''[[Start the Week]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b006r9xr |title=BBC Radio 4 - Start the Week |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded only days before his death and broadcast on 11&amp;nbsp;November 2013.

==Music==
[[John Rutter]] describes Tavener as having the "very rare gift" of being able to "bring an audience to a deep silence."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt; According to Steven Isserlis, "he had his own voice. He wasn't writing to be popular – he was writing the music he had to write."&lt;ref name=bbc /&gt;

===Style and development===
While Tavener's earliest music was influenced by [[Igor Stravinsky]] and [[Olivier Messiaen]] – often invoking the sound world of Stravinsky, in particular ''Canticum Sacrum'',&lt;ref name=Guardianobit/&gt; and the ecstatic quality found in various works by Messiaen – his later music became more sparse, using wide [[Register (music)|registral space]] and was usually [[diatonic]]ally [[Tonality|tonal]].&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Tavener recognised [[Arvo Pärt]] as "a kindred spirit" and shared with him a common religious tradition and a fondness for textural transparency.&lt;ref name=White2013p29&gt;Michael White, "A Time for Reflection", [[BBC Music Magazine]], Vol. 22 No. 2 (December 2013): p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Le livre des sauvages au point de vue de la civilization''''' was a 19th century hoax manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://history.howstuffworks.com/history-vs-myth/10-fake-antiques8.htm|title=10 Famous Fake Antiques and the Suckers Who Bought Them|date=8 April 2013|website=howstuffworks.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The French missionary [[Emmanuel Domenech]]'s work ''Manuscrit pictographique américain, précédé d'une notice sur l'idéographie des Peaux Rouges'' (Paris, 1860) was the result of an unintentional hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/archive/permalink/the_pictographs_of_emmanuel_domenech|title=The Pictographs of Emmanuel Domenech|website=museumofhoaxes.com|accessdate=8 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German orientalist Julius Petzholdt declared that the manuscript consisted only of scribbling and incoherent illustrations in a local German dialect. Domenech maintained the authenticity of the manuscript in a pamphlet entitled ''La vérité sur le livre des sauvages'' (1861), which drew forth a reply from Petzholdt, translated into French (by [[:fr:Philippe Van der Haeghen|Philippe Van der Haeghen]]) under the title of ''Le livre des sauvages au point de vue de la civilization Française'' (Brussels, 1861).

[[Image:Madwomannahadr.jpg|thumb|African American Performance Artist Mem Nahadr as "Madwoman"]]
'''''Madwoman: A Contemporary Opera''''' (also known as ''Madwoman'') is an [[opera]] - [[performance art]] work created by the American performance artist and composer [[Mem Nahadr]] (also known as M). It depicts a series of compositions, "M-mination" from a woman with [[Albinism]], deemed a "Madwoman" by society because of her depth of understanding and unconditional Self Acceptance.  This art piece is presented in an interactive multimedia installation of space, UV light, 5.1 surround sound, items, images and concepts. This installation includes a one-woman live performance by Mem Nahadr, and stands as a sculptured interactive artpiece otherwise. 

Supported by a team of artists and technicians, this presentation includes a multimedia system created by [[James P. Nichols]], Broadway, Jazz and Grammy Award Winning Producer/Engineer; as well as Creative - Stage Direction by Claude E. Sloan, Jr., of the LOEB Drama Center Experimental Theater at Harvard, and the New York Shakespeare Festival at the Public Theater.

Album cover for the opera was photographed by the famed fashion photographer and Human Rights organizational founder, Rick Guidotti of Positive Exposure.

An excerpt from the ''Madwoman'' opera was performed before [[Queen Beatrix]] of Holland during the 25th annual [[Veerstichting]] Symposium at the St. Pieterskerk church in Lieden, The Netherlands.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4027">'''''Me and Rubyfruit''''' is a short 1989&lt;ref&gt;Horrigan, Bill. "Sadie Benning or the Secret Annex." Art Journal 54.4 (1995): 26-29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;/1990&lt;ref&gt;http://www.moma.org/collection/browse_results.php?criteria=O%3AAD%3AE%3A34902&amp;page_number=5&amp;template_id=1&amp;sort_order=1&lt;/ref&gt; videorecording by [[Sadie Benning]] that runs for 5 minutes and was filmed with [[PixelVision]] camera in black and white. The title alludes to ''[[Rubyfruit Jungle]]'', a 1973 novel by [[Rita Mae Brown]] that has explicitly [[lesbian]] themes.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.vdb.org/titles/me-and-rubyfruit&lt;/ref&gt;

The video bears the signature features of [[PixelVision]]: It is black and white and the image is grainy, fuzzy, and contained within a solid black frame. These hallmark characteristics are why PixelVision has been recognized for an erotic, tactile visuality &lt;ref&gt;Marks, L. "Video Haptics and Erotics." Screen 39.4 (1998): 331-48. Web.&lt;/ref&gt; which compliments the video's erotic subject matter.

Issues of female sexuality, and whether or not homoerotic desires can be reconciled with mainstream culture and normative gender roles are explored in the video. The dialogue, presented alternately through spoken words and hand-written quotations on scraps of paper, questions whether or not [[Sapphic love|sapphic]] attraction is acceptable, and depending on the answer to this, what the future holds for [[lesbian]] relationships.

The dialogue is an almost word-for-word recreation of a conversation between Molly Bolt, the protagonist of ''Rubyfruit Jungle'' with whom Benning identified,&lt;ref&gt;Spiro, Ellen. "Shooting Star: Teenage Video Maker Sadie Benning Attracts a Youthful Audience." The Advocate. 26 Mar. 1991: 68-69.&lt;/ref&gt; and her first girlfriend, Leota. The story is told in the style of a video-diary, through which Benning came out,&lt;ref&gt;Horrigan, Bill. "Sadie Benning or the Secret Annex." Art Journal 54.4 (1995): 26-29. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; though it is unclear to what extent the video constitutes an autobiography or memoir. Spoken dialogue is often paired with close-up shots of Benning's eye, while shots of written text pan from left to right, so that at each moment the viewer can read only a portion of what is written on the paper;&lt;ref&gt;Sadie Benning, “Me and Rubyfruit” (1990, 5:30) Video Works, Vol. 1&lt;/ref&gt; the movement of the camera mimics the movement of the eye when reading. The dialogue is not attributed to its speakers in the book, nor are they distinguished by medium; both girls' lines appear in written and spoken word. For this reason, the video's dialogue has also been interpreted as an internal conversation between two parts of Sadie herself, one that is more traditional and one that is more rebellious.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.newmedia-art.org/cgi-bin/show-oeu.asp?ID=BEN007-3&amp;lg=GBR&lt;/ref&gt;

She made her movie debut in the [[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (film)|film version]] of the latter in 1967. Her other film appearances include the [[Walt Disney Productions|Disney]] film ''[[The Love Bug]]'' (1968),  ''[[The Comic]]'' (1969) and ''[[Along Came Polly]]'' (2004).&lt;ref name="yahoo"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://movies.yahoo.com/person/michele-lee/biography.html | title=Michele Lee- Biography | publisher=[[Yahoo!]] | accessdate=2013-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was nominated for the [[Tony Award for Best Actress in a Musical]] in 1974 for ''[[Seesaw (musical)|Seesaw]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Broadway League |url=http://www.ibdb.com/person.php?id=49332 |title=Michele Lee &amp;#124; IBDB: The official source for Broadway Information |publisher=IBDB |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and for the [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play]] in 2001 for ''[[The Tale of the Allergist's Wife]]''. She also played the title role in the 1998 TV film ''Scandalous Me: The [[Jacqueline Susann]] Story'', and [[Madame Morrible]] in the Broadway musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]'' in 2015.

==Early life==
Lee was born '''Michele Lee Dusick''' on June 24, 1942, in [[Los Angeles]], California, the daughter of Sylvia Helen (née Silverstein) and Jack Dusick, a make-up artist.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.filmreference.com/film/40/Michele-Lee.html Profile at FilmReference.com]&lt;/ref&gt; She is of [[Ashkenazi Jewish]] descent, her ancestors being from Poland and Russia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0497891/bio IMDb profile/Michele Lee]&lt;/ref&gt; She attended [[Alexander Hamilton High School (Los Angeles)|Alexander Hamilton High School]]. Her television career began at age 19, on the December 26, 1961, episode of the CBS-TV sitcom ''[[The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis]]''.

==Career==

===Early years===
When Lee was 18, after graduation from high school, she auditioned for the Broadway play, ''Vintage '60''. She soon began appearing in musicals, becoming a Broadway performer at the age of 19 in ''[[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (musical)|How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying]]'' opposite [[Robert Morse]] and [[Rudy Vallee]], a role she reprised in the [[How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying (film)|film version]]. She also appeared in dramas such as the Los Angeles production of [[Jerry Herman]]'s ''[[Parade (revue)|Parade]]'' and the Broadway productions of ''[[Bravo Giovanni]]'' and ''[[The Tale of the Allergist's Wife]]''.

After she sang in the film version of ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'', she became known for her roles in the films ''The Comic'', opposite [[Dick Van Dyke]], and ''[[The Love Bug]]'', opposite [[Dean Jones (actor)|Dean Jones]]. The latter becoming the third-highest-grossing film of 1968 in the United States.  That same year, she starred in a special television production of the [[Jerome Kern]]–[[Otto Harbach]] musical, ''[[Roberta]]'', in which she sang "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes", and also peaked at #52 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]] with "L. David Sloane"&lt;!-- on 6-20 April --&gt;.  After the birth of her son, she worked infrequently until accepting a role on Broadway in ''[[Seesaw (musical)|Seesaw]]'', which netted her a [[Tony Award]] nomination in 1974. After her mother's death, she stopped working to spend time with her son.

In 1974, Lee starred in the [[pilot episode]] for proposed CBS sitcom ''The Michele Lee Show''. She played Michele Burton, a clerk in a hotel newsstand, with support from [[Stephen Collins (actor)|Stephen Collins]]. However, only the pilot episode was aired and the series did not proceed. Lee became a busy guest actor in the 1970s, appearing on ''[[Marcus Welby, M.D.]]'', ''[[Alias Smith and Jones]]'', ''[[Night Gallery]]'', ''[[Love, American Style]]'', ''[[Fantasy Island]]'' and ''[[The Love Boat]]''.

===''Knots Landing''===
In 1979, Lee accepted the role of [[Karen MacKenzie|Karen Fairgate]] on ''Knots Landing'', a spin-off of the immensely popular ''[[Dallas (1978 TV series)|Dallas]]''. Though slow to start, the series eventually became a ratings hit and became one of the longest-running American primetime dramas ever, lasting for a total of 14 seasons from 1979 - 1993.&lt;ref name="yahoo"/&gt; Due to her long-running tenure, Lee's alter ego is often credited as being the center of the program. Television personality [[Joan Rivers]] commented that Lee was, in theory, the "[[First Lady]] of ''Knots Landing''" during her guest appearance on ''[[The Late Show (1986 TV series)|The Late Show]]'', which Rivers hosted at the time.&lt;ref name="Joan Rivers"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5VfImoq2VrA |title=Michele Lee on Joan Rivers with Lucille Ball (Part 3)|work=The Joan Rivers Show|accessdate=January 31, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The characters of the serial often represented what was happening in society at the time. Lee acknowledged that, saying: "Karen wanted to be a [[Pollyanna]] and wasn't ashamed of that. Remember in our society, maybe people don't remember, but remember when we could go over to other people's houses and come in through an open back door? I remember when I was a little girl and my mother and father would have people over and they'd walk into an unlocked door in our house."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.knotslanding.net/interviews/michele.htm |title=Knots Landing official website exclusive web only interviews Michele Lee |publisher=Knotslanding.net |date=2003-03-16 |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lee was the only performer to appear in all of the show's 344 episodes.

Although Lee was enjoying a successful career on television, her marriage to actor [[James Farentino]] was failing. Farentino and she separated around the same time Lee's onscreen husband, [[Don Murray (actor)|Don Murray]], left the series. Lee thus played a single mother on ''Knots Landing'' at the same time she was becoming one in real life. Lee revealed that when her character took off her wedding ring in a 1982 episode, she was taking off her real wedding band.

During the fall of 1982, her character met M. Patrick "Mack" MacKenzie ([[Kevin Dobson]]), who became her screen husband the following year. They would continue working together until the end of the series. Lee won the ''Soap Opera Digest'' Award for Best Lead Actress (Primetime) three times, and was also nominated for an Emmy in 1982 for "Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emmys.com/bios/michele-lee |title=Michele Lee &amp;#124; Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences |publisher=Emmys.com |date= |accessdate=2013-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the writers/producers of ''Knots Landing'' urged her to do a storyline based on prescription drug dependency which became one of her most prominent storylines. Six years later, Lee directed her first of several episodes of the series. In 1991, ''Knots Landing'' reached a milestone with its 300th episode. During the same season, Lee filmed her favorite scene from the series, known as the "[[Pollyanna]] Speech" among fans. In this scene, for which Lee had much input, Karen reacts strongly against all of the social problems of 1990s society and explains how she does not want to be a Pollyanna and see the world through rose-colored glasses, but rather wanted the world to be rose-colored.

As ''Knots Landing'' moved into the 1990s, its popularity began to wane, although it had outlived all of its contemporaries. The big budget that the series once had was trimmed to the extent that, in the final season, the higher paid cast members were asked to appear in only 15 of the season's 19 episodes as the production company could not afford to pay them. However, Lee insisted on appearing in all 19 episodes that season, doing her extra four episodes for "union scale" pay.

===Later career ===
After ''Knots Landing'' ended in 1993, Lee has appeared in many made-for-TV movies, including a [[biopic]] of late [[country music|country]] star [[Dottie West]] (''[[Big Dreams and Broken Hearts: The Dottie West Story]]'') and she became the first woman to star in, direct, and produce a TV movie for Lifetime, ''Color Me Perfect'' (1996). She also starred in the reunion miniseries ''[[Knots Landing: Back to the Cul-de-Sac]]'' (1997), and portrayed novelist [[Jacqueline Susann]] in the television biopic ''Scandalous Me: The Jacqueline Susann Story'' (1998). In 2000, she returned to the Broadway stage in ''[[The Tale of the Allergist's Wife]]'' and received a 2001 Tony Award nomination for [[Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play|Best Featured Actress in a Play]]. In 2004, she returned to feature films in the role of [[Ben Stiller]]'s character's mother in ''[[Along Came Polly]]''. She guest-starred alongside [[Chita Rivera]] in a February 2005 episode of ''[[Will &amp; Grace]]''. Also in 2005, she reunited with her ''Knots Landing'' co-stars for the nonfiction special ''[[Knots Landing Reunion: Together Again]]'', in which the stars reminisced about their time on the hit series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tvguide.com/news/Knots-Landing-Reunion-59581.aspx | title=Knots Landing Reunion: Together... | publisher=[[TV Guide]] | date=Dec 5, 2005 | accessdate=2013-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, she appeared alongside [[Tyne Daly]], [[Leslie Uggams]], [[Christine Baranski]] and [[Karen Ziemba]] for the [[Kennedy Center]] Honor of [[Julie Harris (American actress)|Julie Harris]]. In 2010, Lee did voice work for an episode of the animated comedy series ''[[Family Guy]]''. She returned to Broadway in 2015 to star as Madame Morrible in the musical ''[[Wicked (musical)|Wicked]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/michele-lee-will-show-how-to-succeed-in-broadways-wicked-351880 |work=Playill.com |title=Michele Lee Will Show How to Succeed in Broadway's ''Wicked'' |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
In 1963, Lee met actor [[James Farentino]] on the set of the play, ''How to Succeed in Business Without Really Trying'', and in 1966, they were married. Their son, David Farentino, was born July 6, 1969. Lee and Farentino divorced in 1983. She  married producer and writer Fred Rappaport in 1987.

[[File:The Combat of Ares and Athena.jpg|thumb|300px]]
'''''Minerva Fighting Mars''''' (''Combat de Mars contre Minerve'') is a 1771 painting by [[Jacques-Louis David]], now in the [[Louvre]].

==History==
David produced the painting to compete for the [[Prix de Rome]] of 1771 - he and the seven other competitors were assigned the task of painting a new work in 10 weeks on a set subject, which that year was the ''[[Iliad]]''. David lost that year to [[Joseph-Benoît Suvée]], finally winning on his fourth attempt in 1774 with ''[[Erasistratus Discovering the Cause of Antiochus' Disease]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3471">'''Mogu''' ({{zh|c=沒骨}}) is a [[painting]] skill or technique in traditional [[Chinese painting]]. It literally means "boneless".&lt;ref name="Mogu Biadu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://baike.baidu.com/view/183922.htm |title=没骨 (Mogu) |publisher=[[Baidu Baike]]  |accessdate=31 May 2010|language=Chinese}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bribai/&gt;

On paintings in the style of mogu, forms are made by [[Ink wash painting|ink]] and color washes rather than by outlines.&lt;ref name=bribai&gt;{{cite web|title=baimiao|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/438394/baimiao#ref225112|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=16 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Derivation of the name==

There are mainly two derivatives:

[[Image:Lotus Flower Breaking the Surface by Yun Shouping.jpg|thumb|right|300px|[[Yun Shouping]]'s ''Mogu'' painting: ''Lotus Flower Breaking the Surface'' (出水芙蓉圖) ([[Palace Museum]], [[Beijing]])]]

According to some ancient records, the technique was first created and theorized by [[Zhang Sengyou]] of the [[Liang Dynasty]] in 557 during the [[Southern dynasties]] period.&lt;ref name="Mogu Biadu"/&gt;

During the period of the [[Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms period]], a painter named Huang Quan (黄筌) from [[Former Shu]] significantly developed the techniques in [[bird-and-flower painting]], especially in painting trees and flowers, and his painting was called as the fine-sounding name ''Mogu Huazhi'' (沒骨花枝).&lt;ref name="Mogu Biadu"/&gt;

In [[Tang Dynasty]], notable painters mastered this technique includes Yang Sheng (楊升).

[[Xu Chongsi]] (徐崇嗣) during the [[Northern Song Dynasty]] continued developing the technique from Huang, and his paintings were named ''Mogu-Tu'' (沒骨圖). Xu started applying this technique in [[shan shui]] painting.&lt;ref name="Mogu Biadu"/&gt;

The technique gained popularity during the Late-[[Ming Dynasty]] and [[Qing Dynasty]], and the most famous master would be [[Yun Shouping]].

==The technique==

The method mainly is a [[staining]] and dying one, by using [[ink brush]] pens. Less or absolutely no [[sketch (drawing)|sketch]] or [[drawing]], so people can hardly observe solid lines or curves in the painting.

There are basically three ''Mogu'' staining methods: the staining by smearing (渲染; Xuàn-Rǎn), the staining by dotting (点染; Diǎn-Rǎn), and the staining by just filling [[colour]]s (填染; Tián-Rǎn).

'''Napkin folding''' is a type of [[decorative folding]] done with a [[napkin]]. It can be done as art or as a hobby. Napkin folding is most commonly encountered as a table decoration in fancy restaurants.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Doris (2005). Napkin Folding for Every Occasion. New York: Sterling Publishing. p. 9. {{ISBN|9781402728020}}. "It is no accident that fine restaurants have long preserved the art of napkin folding as an important element of presentation."&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, and for best results, a clean, pressed, and starched square cloth (linen or cotton) napkin is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marthastewart.com/276337/napkin-folding-ideas/@center/276958/holiday-entertaining#267716 | title=Napkin Folding Ideas | publisher=Marthastewart.com | accessdate=2013-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are variations in napkin folding in which a rectangular napkin, a [[napkin ring]], a glass, or multiple napkins may be used.

== History ==
The earliest instruction manual for the artistic folding of napkins was published in 1639 by Matthia Gieger, a German meat carver working in Padua, as a part of a series of treatises on culinary arts titled Le tre trattati.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ediblegeography.com/the-history-and-techniques-of-napkin-folding/|title=The History and Techniques of Napkin Folding|website=www.ediblegeography.com|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Napkin folding has a centuries-old history&lt;ref&gt;Hetzer, Linda (2001). [https://books.google.com/books?id=lQ3xaui3OCoC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Simple+Art+of+Napkin+Folding+94+Fancy+Folds+for+Every+Tabletop+Occasion&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=a_aIUdmuF8rIiwKq0oGYDQ&amp;ved=0CD8Q6AEwAA ''The Simple Art of Napkin Folding: 94 Fancy Folds for Every Tabletop Occasion'']. Robert Penny (1st William Morrow pbk. ed.). New York, N.Y.: William Morrow. p. 7. {{ISBN|9780060934897}}. Retrieved 26 February 2013. "More than three centuries ago, napkin folding was developed into an art, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; and dates back to the times of [[Louis XIV of France]] (5 September 1638 – 1 September 1715), known as Louis the Great (Louis le Grand) or the Sun King (le Roi-Soleil), was a monarch of the House of Bourbon who ruled as King of France from 1643 until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, Doris (2005). Napkin Folding for Every Occasion. New York: Sterling Publishing. pp. 9–10. {{ISBN|9781402728020}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The shift of the napkin from simply a folded cloth to a folded art object occurred in the 16th century in Florence, Italy around the same as voluminous clothing, such as ballooned sleeves, had become fashionable among the wealthy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2015/08/12/431271509/unfolding-the-history-of-napkin-art|title=Unfolding The History Of Napkin Art|access-date=2016-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Rather than simply laying a tablecloth flat on a table, starched linens were folded into large centerpieces, called "triumphs," that could depict a variety of real and mythical animals, natural elements and architectural forms.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;  A popular gift wedding guests received during this time was a personally folded napkin that distinguished whether they were related to the bride or groom.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the mid-18th century, table setting practices were so specific that in Germany there were particular traditions on how to fold napkins, display figures at the table and arrange plate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/art/T082928?q=napkin+folding&amp;search=quick&amp;pos=4&amp;_start=1#firsthit|title=Table Services and Ornament|last=Tattersall|first=Bruce|date=|website=Oxford Art Online|publisher=Grove Art Online|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this golden age of napkin folding, there was a school in Nuremberg devoted entirely to this art and butlers had shelves of instructional books to keep up with the changes in the field.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Napkin folding in the form of table sculptures began being replaced by porcelain decorations during the 18th century.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

'''New Holland Island''' ({{lang-ru|Но́вая Голла́ндия}}) is a historic triangular artificial island in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]], dating from the 18th century.

==History==
The island was created in 1719, when the newly built [[Kryukov Canal]] and [[Admiralty Canal]] connected the [[Moika River]] with the [[Neva]]. The triangular island took its name after a number of canals and shipbuilding facilities that rendered its appearance similar to [[Amsterdam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.saint-petersburg.com/buildings/new-holland/ | title=New Holland | website=Saint-Petersburg.com | accessdate=27 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Peter the Great]] took the opportunity to create a naval port, including a wooden palace for his own use.

During the following centuries, the island belonged to the [[Russian Admiralty]], which would adapt the plot for its various needs. Originally, there was a minor [[shipyard]] for [[rowing boat]]s. In 1732, the Admiralty engaged architect [[Ivan Korobov]] to construct a network of basins and wooden warehouses along the island's perimeter in order to store lumber for shipbuilding.

In 1765, [[Savva Chevakinsky]] was ordered to rebuild the warehouses in brick but without customary [[stucco]] decoration. By 1788, when the project was halted, [[Jean-Baptiste Vallin de la Mothe]] had designed and supervised the construction of a highly pitched [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] [[arch]] over the canal. This magnificent red-brick gateway to the island, known as the New Holland Arch, is flanked by massive [[Tuscan column]]s of red granite.

New Holland did not achieve its present appearance until the building of a naval [[prison]] in 1828–29 and a [[Basin (maritime)|basin]] for naval architects in 1893. [[Aleksei Krylov]] used this basin for testing new models of ships between 1900 and 1908. The most powerful [[radio station]] in [[Imperial Russia]] was launched there by the General Staff of the Navy in 1915. 

After the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], the 18th-century buildings of New Holland Island fell into neglect, serving time as military barracks, warehouses and (most recently) offices for various commercial enterprises.

==Recent developments==
[[File:Санкт-Петербург. "Новая Голландия". Морская тюрьма. 2011г..jpg|thumb|275px|The former naval prison]]
On [[Navy Day#Russia|Navy Day]] in 2000, New Holland was opened to the public for the emplacements project (1997–2000), an art project created by artists [[Françoise Dupré]] and [[Roxane Permar]] with support from Russian artists, including [[Lyudmila Belova]] and [[Tatyana Nikolaenko]], involving over two dozen artists altogether.

In 2004, the Ministry of Defense evacuated the buildings, which were to be refurbished for hotels and clubs to a design by [[Norman Foster, Baron Foster of Thames Bank]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.fosterandpartners.com/projects/new-holland-island/ | title=Projects / New Holland Island – St Petersburg, Russia – 2006 | publisher=[[Foster + Partners]] | date=2006 | accessdate=27 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; until the consortium running the project ran into difficulties.

In 2010, a new project was established, under the control of [[Roman Abramovich]], with space for galleries and a museum, possibly to house Abramovich's art collection, acquired with the help of [[Daria Zhukova]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/russia/8164981/Roman-Abramovich-to-spend-250-million-on-St-Petersburg-art-museum-project.html | title=Roman Abramovich to spend £250 million on St Petersburg art museum project | newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] | first1=Robert | last1=Mendick | first2=Nigel | last2=Rosser | date=28 November 2010 | accessdate=27 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The island opened to the public in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.rt.com/art-and-culture/new-island-opens-public/ | title=New Holland Island in St. Petersburg opens to public | publisher=[[Russia Today]] | date=20 July 2011 | accessdate=27 December 2015 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105031909/https://www.rt.com/art-and-culture/new-island-opens-public/ | archivedate=5 January 2016 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Work Architecture Company]] (WORKac) of [[New York City|New York]] is working on the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.archdaily.com/156067/workac-to-redesign-st-petersburgs-new-holland-island | title=WORKac to Redesign St. Petersburg's New Holland Island | date=3 August 2011 | first=Kelly | last=Minner| publisher=ArchDaily.com | accessdate=27 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The planned £256m complex is intended to combine commercial and residential properties with the restoration of monuments that are protected by [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sponsored/rbth/features/8241788/Roman-Abramovichs-romantic-island-dream.html | title=Roman Abramovich's romantic island dream | newspaper=[[Daily Telegraph]] | first=Susanna | last=Alperina | date=5 January 2011 | accessdate=27 December 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A branch of the [[Centre of Contemporary Art]] (based in Moscow) is also planned.

'''New York Feminist Art Institute''' (NYFAI) was founded in 1979 (to 1990) by women artists, educators and professionals. NYFAI offered workshops and classes, held performances and exhibitions and special events that contributed to the political and cultural import of the women's movement at the time. The women's art school focused on self-development and discovery as well as art. [[Nancy Azara]] introduced "visual diaries" to artists to draw and paint images that arose from consciousness-raising classes and their personal lives. In the first half of the 1980s the school was named the Women's Center for Learning and it expanded its artistic and academic programs. Ceres Gallery was opened in 1985 after the school moved to [[TriBeCa]] and, like the school, it catered to women artists. NYFAI participated in protests to increase women's art shown at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], [[The Whitney Museum of American Art]] and other museums. It held exhibitions and workshops and provided rental and studio space for women artists. Unable to secure sufficient funding to continue its operations, NYFAI closed in 1990. [http://www.ceresgallery.org Ceres Gallery] moved to [[SoHo, New York|SoHo]] and then to Chelsea and remained a gallery for women's art. However, a group continues to meet called [http://www.nyfai.org/currentactivities.html (RE)PRESENT], a series of intergenerational dialogues at a NYC gallery to encourage discussion across generations about contemporary issues for women in the arts. It is open to all.

==History==
New York Feminist Art Institute opened in June 1979 at 325 Spring Street in the Port Authority Building. The founding members and the initial board of directors were [[Nancy Azara]], [[Miriam Schapiro]], Selena Whitefeather, Lucille Lessane, [[Irene Peslikis]] and Carol Stronghilos.&lt;ref name=Rutgers&gt;Fernanda Perrone, Amy Dawson, and Caroline T. Caviness. [http://www2.scc.rutgers.edu/ead/manuscripts/nyfaif.html Inventory to the Records of the New York Feminist Art Institute, 1976-1990.] Administrative History. Rutgers. July 2009. Retrieved January 15, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; A board of advisers was established of accomplished artists, educators and professional women.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt; For instance, feminist writer and arts editor at ''Ms. Magazine'' Harriet Lyons was an adviser from its start.&lt;ref name="Love2006"&gt;Barbara J. Love. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;pg=PA24 Feminists who Changed America, 1963-1975]''. University of Illinois Press; 2006. {{ISBN|978-0-252-03189-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the actions of the [[Feminist art movement in the United States|Feminist art movement]], the founders sought to create a community that would inspire women artists and help them assess how their art was created in the "social and psychological context of our identity as women."&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt;

NYFAI Mission (1979): "Our vision of the New York Feminist Art Institute obliges us to act now to create an environment for the training of women in the arts. The challenge is to discover a teaching method which encourages women to use personal experience to create a radiant art of our own. The curriculum of the school involves the development of self-awareness in a social and political context, and the development of a sense of group identity. Work is both collective and individual. Consciousness raising and feminist philosophy are the primary components from which the curriculum organically develops."{{fact|date=October 2017}}

The Joint Foundation provided a grant that allowed the organization to operate initially. The [[American Stock Exchange]], The Eastman Fund, America the Beautiful Fund, [[RCA]], the Ford Foundation and the NEA also provided grants to the organization. It held biannual open houses and annual benefits to raise funds. One of the earliest was very successful and had [[Louise Nevelson]] as a guest of honor.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt; Open house honorees were Alice Neel, Elaine DeKooning, Vivian Browne, Louise Bourgeois, Lenore Tawney, Faith Ringgold, Nancy Spero, Elizabeth Murray and The Guerilla Girls among others.

In April 1981 the organization held a weekend conference "Political Consciousness/ Political Action: Dialogues and Strategies for the 80s" to help women gain a greater sense of personal power and discover ways to engage in the political process.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt; NYFAI also moved to a new location in 1984 in [[TriBeCa]] on Franklin Street, which had gallery space for the cooperative Ceres Gallery, additional space for its school and had rental studio and storage space for artists.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt;

In 1984 they co-sponsored a [[Museum of Modern Art]] protest, "Let MoMA Know: Women Artists Visibility Event (WAVE)," with the Women's Interart Center, [[Heresies: A Feminist Publication on Art and Politics|the Heresies Collective]], and the [[Women's Caucus for Art]]'s New York chapter. They protested the few numbers of women in MoMA's grand-reopening and "An International Survey of Recent Painting and Sculpture" exhibition; Of 165 exhibitors, only 14 of them were women. Buttons with the statement, "The Museum of Modern Art Opens but Not to Women," were worn by 400 protesters.&lt;ref&gt;Arlene Raven, [https://www.questia.com/read/93799051 "The Archaic Smile,"] in New Feminist Criticism: Art, Identity, Action, ed. Joanna Frueh, Cassandra L. Langer, and Arlene Raven (New York: Icon Editions, 1994), 12, accessed via [[Questia]] (subscription required)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Institute, which had struggled with ensuring it had sufficient funding for some time, shut down its operations by 1991. [[Rutgers University]] Libraries received its library and archives. The non-profit Ceres Gallery moved in 1992 to SoHo and then Chelsea at 547 West 27th Street.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt;

==Women's Center for Learning/ New York Feminist Art Institute==
The Art Institute focused on self-discovery and art education. First years students participated in consciousness-raising classes developed by Nancy Azara where students created "visual diaries" by recording their feelings and thoughts by writing, painting or writing words into art journals. It taught the history of anthropology and art and feminist theory. Art studies included drawing, sculpture, and painting. It was a program that required inspiration and self-motivation, students did not have grades. Performance was measured by teachers assessments and student self-assessments. Students were offered the opportunity to work as apprentices with professional artists. Part-time students attended weekend workshops and evening courses.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt;

The school added the title the "Women's Center for Learning" in the early 1980s. Focused on personal development, it added writing and psychology classes. Its art program was expanded to include basketry, puppetry, printmaking, papermaking, poetry, filmmaking and much more.&lt;ref name=Rutgers /&gt;

==Ceres Gallery==
'''[http://www.ceresgallery.org/ Ceres Gallery]''' is a feminist, not-for-profit, alternative gallery in New York City, dedicated to the promotion of contemporary women in the arts. Ceres provides an exhibition space that enhances public awareness and helps remediate women’s limited access to commercial galleries. It also serves as a supportive base for a diversity of artistic and political views. Over the years Ceres has encouraged not only artists but writers, musicians, dancers, poets and storytellers to perform in the gallery and take risks with their work that might not be possible in a commercial setting. The members of Ceres Gallery believe the arts provide an important social service - that art has the power to educate, enhance and enrich the quality and depth of people’s lives.
 
Ceres provides a showcase for women artists regardless of age, artistic style or commercial viability to exhibit their work in New York City, many for the first time. All work meets professional standards of excellence but is not restricted in style, medium or theme. Through its progressive programing, the Gallery has become a gathering place for educational and community activities and in addition to providing the general public with a place to expand their knowledge of contemporary art is also a place for women artists to gather for support and friendship. Many artistic and political events are presented throughout the year with participation by gallery artists, artists not affiliated with the gallery and others from the larger arts community. The gallery operates as a cooperative which means members vote on all decisions including the review of possible new members and they participate in monthly meetings to plan the overall direction of the gallery. In addition, Ceres has a professional Director to facilitate the smooth running of all programs and exhibitions. Currently, Ceres has a roster of showing artists from the New York metropolitan area and from across the country with a small number from countries outside the U.S.

'''Ceres Gallery''' was founded in 1984 by Rhonda Schaller, Polly Lai and Darla Bjork, in conversation with NYFAI director, artist Nancy Azara as a program of the New York Feminist Art Institute (NYFAI, 1979-1990). Early members included: Carol Goebel, Phyllis Rosser, Joan Arbeiter, Sandra Branch and Vivien Tsao. The gallery was first located at 91 Franklin Street in Tribeca on the ground floor of the building which housed the New York Feminist Art Institute (NYFAI). Large salon style shows, joint exhibitions and others were held yearly such as: “Reflections: Women in Their Own Image” and “Heroic Female: Images of Power.” In 1993 it moved to 584 Broadway in SoHo where it remained until 2003. Today, Ceres Gallery has 2000+ square feet in one of Chelsea’s premier art destination buildings, The Landmark Arts Building, 547 West 27th Street. Members still at Ceres include Carol Goebel, Phyllis Rosser and Vivian Tsao.

'''PIPA Prize''' is an initiative of PIPA Institute in partnership with the [[Museum of Modern Art, Rio de Janeiro|Museum of Modern Art of Rio de Janeiro]] – MAM/RJ to bring visibility to and encourage the production of [[contemporary art]] in Brazil.

Created in 2010, the yearly [[award]] is considered one of the most important art prizes in [[Brazil]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.correiobraziliense.com.br/app/noticia/diversao-e-arte/2010/07/04/interna_diversao_arte,200762/index.shtml|title=Brasilienses indicados ao Prêmio Pipa|last=Braziliense|first=Correio|work=Correio Braziliense|access-date=2017-07-07|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.select.art.br/premio-pipa-2016/|title=Prêmio PIPA 2016 - seLecT|date=2016-07-26|work=seLecT|access-date=2017-07-07|language=pt-BR}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it supports up-and-coming artists, PIPA Prize's mission is not to discover new talents, but to recognize new Brazilian contemporary artists that already have a [[Art criticism|critical]] following and a place in the [[Art valuation|art market]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://artrio.art.br/pt-br/noticias/artistas-indicados-ao-pipa-2014|title=Artistas indicados ao PIPA 2014 {{!}} ArtRio|last=Artrio|website=artrio.art.br|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== PIPA Online ===
This award is determined by popular vote on the PIPA Prize website and encompasses all of the nominated artists. The website features profiles for each of the nominated artists in both [[English language|English]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] with photos of their work, texts and videos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://dasartes.com.br/materias/premio-pipa-possibilidade-de-uma-curadoria-coletiva/|title=Prêmio PIPA: possibilidade de uma curadoria coletiva? {{!}} DASartes|website=dasartes.com.br|language=pt-BR|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2012 onward, the voting process happens in two shifts: artists that receive more than 500 votes on the first round go on to the second one, where a winner is determined. First place wins a cash prize of R$10,000, the runner-up receives R$5,000. From 2014 to 2014, the winning artist would also participate in a two month long art residency at Instituto Sacatar, in Bahia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sacatar.org/sacatar-media/2015/|title=Sacatar Foundation Brazil    » 2015|website=sacatar.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 and 2015, the Online category was split up into two distinct categories: '''PIPA Online''', where a juri determined the winner among all nominated artists; and '''PIPA Popular Online''', where the winning artists was selected by popular vote on the award's website.

A '''projection plane''', or '''plane of projection''', is a type of view in which graphical projections from an object intersect.&lt;ref name="Bert02"&gt;Gary R. Bertoline et al. (2002) ''Technical Graphics Communication''. McGraw–Hill Professional, 2002. {{isbn|0-07-365598-8}}, p. 330.&lt;/ref&gt; Projection planes are used often in [[descriptive geometry]] and graphical representation. A [[picture plane]] in [[perspective drawing]] is a type of projection plane.

With perspective drawing, the '''lines of sight''', or '''projection lines''', between an object and a picture plane return to a [[vanishing point]] and are not parallel. With [[parallel projection]] the lines of sight from the object to the projection plane are parallel.

The '''Public Domain Enhancement Act''' ('''PDEA''') ({{USBill|108|H.R.|2601}} (108th Congress), {{USBill|109|H.R.|2408}} (109th Congress)) was a bill in the [[United States Congress]] which, if passed, would have added a [[tax]] for [[copyright]]ed works to retain their copyright status.  The purpose of the bill was to make it easier to determine who holds a copyright (by determining the identity of the person who paid the tax), and to allow copyrighted works which have been abandoned by their owners, also known as [[orphan works]], to pass into the [[public domain]].

==Impact==
In the bill's latest form, the tax would have been a multiple-time affair, a sum of US$1 per work charged 50 years after the date of first publication or on December 31, 2006, whichever occurs later, and every 10 years thereafter until the end of the [[copyright term]], only on works first published within the United States (as charging it from foreigners would violate the [[Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works|Berne convention]] except in some interpretations of the [[Berne three-step test]]). Failure to pay the [[United States Copyright Office|Copyright Office]] the copyright renewal fee on or before the date the fee is due or within a grace period of 6 months thereafter would allow the work to irreversibly lapse into the public domain in the United States and other countries and areas applying the [[rule of the shorter term]] of the Berne Convention. However, if payments are made in time, the copyright may be extended to the end of the normal maximum term, currently 95 years for a work made for hire. In practice, this would resemble copyright renewal under the [[Copyright Act of 1909]], but the bill will create a 50-year term renewable five times for 45 years.

The problem that the law attempts to solve is that the cost of locating the owner of a work is often prohibitive. For works that are still in print, this is usually not a problem, but otherwise there is typically not a clear record of whether the original creator transferred the rights, died, or had a clear successor to its rights.  The PDEA solves this problem by requiring a small tax to maintain copyright on a work. For works that the copyright owner no longer cares about, the copyright will lapse, and so copies and derivatives can be made freely.  The Act would also require the Copyright Office to maintain an easily searchable database, so that for works that the original publisher still wishes to maintain copyright on, potential derivative creators can find out who paid the US$1 tax and negotiate with them for permission.

==Legislative history==
This bill was first introduced in the House on June 25, 2003 by representatives [[Zoe Lofgren]] ([[Democratic Party (United States)|D]]-[[California|CA]]) and [[John T. Doolittle]] ([[Republican Party (United States)|R]]-CA) where it went to the [[U.S. House Committee on the Judiciary|House Committee on the Judiciary]].  On September 4, 2003, it moved to the House Subcommittee on Courts, the Internet, and Intellectual Property.  On May 17, 2005 it was reintroduced by Lofgren as H.R. 2408, and was once again referred to the House Judiciary Committee.

==Opposition to PDEA==

Opposition to the Public Domain Enhancement Act comes from the entertainment industry sphere, particularly the [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) and its lobbyists. In his book ''Free Culture'', [[Lawrence Lessig]] lays out the reason for the MPAA opposition to the bill:

# Congress had already "firmly rejected" the concept of copyright renewal in the [[Copyright Act of 1976]], which eliminated the need for registration and renewal of copyrighted works.
# The $1 fee would harm copyright owners, particularly those with large numbers of active and potentially commercially viable works.
# The extension fee would encourage copyright restoration, a process that re-asserts copyright over a public domain work that originated outside the US and for which US copyright was not renewed.&lt;ref&gt;Public Domain Sherpa. [http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/copyright-restoration.html Copyright restoration and foreign works: be careful].&lt;/ref&gt;
# The benefits would fail to justify the administrative costs needed to set up and fund a registration system.
# The MPAA expressed concern about the effects of a story that underlies a currently copyrighted film moving into the public domain (although this would not invalidate the copyright of the film).
# The MPAA argues that current law already allows for the creation of derivative works via licensing and release of rights.

Proponents such as Lessig have suggested that copyright holders may be motivated to oppose the PDEA by a competitive threat: a huge wave of abandoned works would spill into the public domain which could form the basis of new derived works that would compete commercially with established copyrighted works.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence Lessig. [http://www.free-culture.cc/freeculture.pdf Free Culture: The Nature and Future of Creativity], 252-256. Penguin. {{ISBN|0-14-303465-0}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Master Cat, or The Booted Cat'''" ({{lang-it|Il gatto con gli stivali}}; {{lang-fr|Le Maître chat ou le Chat botté}}), commonly known in English as "'''Puss in Boots'''", is a European literary [[fairy tale]] about a [[cat]] who uses trickery and deceit to gain power, wealth, and the hand of a princess in marriage for his penniless and low-born master. The oldest telling is by Italian author [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]], who included it in his ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' (c. 1550–53) in XIV–XV. Another version was published in 1634 by [[Giambattista Basile]] with the title ''Cagliuso'', and a tale was written in French at the close of the seventeenth century by [[Charles Perrault]] (1628–1703), a retired civil servant and member of the ''[[Académie française]]''.&lt;ref name="OpieP21"&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tale appeared in a handwritten and illustrated manuscript two years before its 1697 publication by Barbin in a collection of eight fairy tales by Perrault called ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé]]''.&lt;ref name="OpieP23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TatarP234" /&gt; The book was an instant success and remains popular.&lt;ref name="OpieP21" /&gt;
&lt;!--Aside from the uncited and thus POV "apparently" supposition, this paragraph is contradicted by this footnoted sentence under "Publication": The book was advertised in June 1729 as being "very entertaining and instructive for children".[13] 
The tale's immorality has provoked some concern about its influence on young minds, but apparently Perrault composed "Le Maistre Chat" and the other tales of ''Histoires'' to reinforce standards of civilized conduct in the upper-class French society of the seventeenth century rather than to provide amusement and instruction for the young. Indeed, Puss has been described by one commentator as "the epitome of the educated bourgeois secretary who serves his master with complete devotion and diligence."&lt;ref name="ZipesP25" /&gt;--&gt;

Perrault's ''Histoires'' has had considerable impact on world culture. The original Italian title of the first edition was ''Costantino Fortunato'', but was later known as ''Il gatto con gli stivali'' (lit. ''The cat with the boots''); the French title was "Histoires ou contes du temps passé, avec des moralités" with the subtitle "Les Contes de ma mère l'Oye" ("Stories or Fairy Tales from Past Times with Morals", subtitled "[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé|Mother Goose Tales]]"). The [[book frontispiece|frontispiece]] to the earliest English editions depicts an old woman telling tales to a group of children beneath a placard inscribed "MOTHER GOOSE'S TALES" and is credited with launching the [[Mother Goose]] legend in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name="OpieP23" /&gt; "Puss in Boots" has provided inspiration for composers, choreographers, and other artists over the centuries. The cat appears in the third act ''pas de caractère'' of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ballet ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'',&lt;ref name="BrownP351"&gt;{{Harvnb|Brown|2007|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|appears]] in the [[sequel]]s to the animated film ''[[Shrek (film)|Shrek]]''. Puss in Boots is a popular [[pantomime]] in the UK.

==Plot== 
The tale opens with the third and [[youngest son]] of a [[miller]] receiving his [[inheritance]]—a [[cat]]. At first, the youngest son laments, as the eldest brother gains the mill, and the middle brother gets the [[mule]]s. The feline is no ordinary cat, however, but one who requests and receives a pair of boots. Determined to make his master's fortune, the cat bags a [[rabbit]] in the forest and presents it to the [[Monarch|king]] as a gift from his master, the fictional [[Marquess|Marquis]] of Carabas. The cat continues making gifts of game to the king for several months, for which he is rewarded.

[[File:Lechatbotte4.jpg|thumb|left|Puss meets the ogre in a nineteenth-century illustration by [[Gustave Doré]]]]

One day, the king decides to take a drive with his daughter. The cat persuades his master to remove his clothes and enter the river which their carriage passes. The cat disposes of his master's clothing beneath a rock. As the royal coach nears, the cat begins calling for help in great distress. When the king stops to investigate, the cat tells him that his master the Marquis has been bathing in the river and robbed of his clothing. The king has the young man brought from the river, dressed in a splendid suit of clothes, and seated in the coach with his daughter, who falls in love with him at once.

The cat hurries ahead of the coach, ordering the country folk along the road to tell the king that the land belongs to the "Marquis of Carabas", saying that if they do not he will cut them into mincemeat. The cat then happens upon a castle inhabited by an [[ogre]] who is capable of transforming himself into a number of creatures. The ogre displays his ability by changing into a [[lion]], frightening the cat, who then tricks the ogre into changing into a [[mouse]]. The cat then pounces upon the mouse and devours it. The king arrives at the castle that formerly belonged to the ogre, and, impressed with the bogus Marquis and his estate, gives the lad the princess in marriage. Thereafter, the cat enjoys life as a great lord who runs after mice only for his own amusement.&lt;ref name="OpiePP113–116"&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|pp=113–116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tale is followed immediately by two [[moral]]s: "one stresses the importance of possessing ''industrie'' and ''[[List of French words and phrases used by English speakers#S|savoir faire]]'' while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess."&lt;ref name="ZipesP26" /&gt; The Italian translation by [[Carlo Collodi]] notes that the tale gives useful advice if you happen to be a cat or a Marquis of Carabas.

This is the theme in France, but other versions of this theme exist in Asia, Africa, and South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Great Cat Massacre|last = Darnton|first = Robert|publisher = Basic Books, Ink.|year = 1984|isbn = 978-0-465-01274-9|location = New York, NY|pages = 29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Puss-in-Boots-1695.jpg|thumb|upright|Handwritten and illustrated manuscript of Perrault's "Le Maître Chat" dated 1695]]

Perrault's "The Master Cat, or Puss in Boots" is the most renowned tale in all of Western folklore of the [[donor (fairy tale)|animal as helper]].&lt;ref name="OpieP110" /&gt; However, the [[trickster]] cat was not Perrault's invention.&lt;ref name="OpieP110"&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Centuries before the publication of Perrault's tale, [[Somadeva]], a [[Kashmir]] [[Brahmin]], assembled a vast collection of [[India]]n [[Folklore|folk tale]]s called ''[[Katha Sarit Sagara|Kathā Sarit Sāgara]]'' (lit. "The ocean of the streams of stories") that featured stock fairy tale characters and trappings such as invincible swords, vessels that replenish their contents, and helpful animals. In the ''[[Panchatantra]]'' (lit. "Five Principles"), a collection of [[Hindu]] tales from the fifth century A.D., a tale follows a cat who fares much less well than Perrault's Puss as he attempts to make his fortune in a king's palace.&lt;ref name="OpieP18"&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1553, "Costantino Fortunato", a tale similar to "Le Maître Chat", was published in [[Venice, Italy|Venice]] in [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]]'s ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola|Le Piacevoli Notti]]'' (lit. ''The Facetious Nights''),&lt;ref name="OpieP112"&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|p=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; the first European storybook to include fairy tales.&lt;ref name=OpieP20&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|p=20}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Straparola's tale however, the poor young man is the son of a [[Bohemia]]n woman, the cat is a fairy in disguise, the princess is named Elisetta, and the castle belongs not to an ogre but to a lord who conveniently perishes in an accident. The poor young man eventually becomes King of Bohemia.&lt;ref name="OpieP112" /&gt; An edition of Straparola was published in France in 1560.&lt;ref name="OpieP110" /&gt; The abundance of oral versions after Straparola's tale may indicate an oral source to the tale; it also is possible Straparola invented the story.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|2001|p=877}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1634, another tale with a trickster cat as hero was published in [[Giambattista Basile]]'s collection ''[[Pentamerone]]'' although neither the collection nor the tale were published in France during Perrault's lifetime. In Basile, the lad is a beggar boy called Gagliuso (sometimes Cagliuso) whose fortunes are achieved in a manner similar to Perrault's Puss. However, the tale ends with Cagliuso, in gratitude to the cat, promising the feline a gold coffin upon his death. Three days later, the cat decides to test Gagliuso by pretending to be dead and is mortified to hear Gagliuso tell his wife to take the dead cat by its paws and throw it out the window. The cat leaps up, demanding to know whether this was his promised reward for helping the beggar boy to a better life. The cat then rushes away, leaving his master to fend for himself.&lt;ref name="OpieP112" /&gt; In another rendition, the cat performs acts of bravery, then a fairy comes and turns him to his normal state to be with other cats.

It is likely that Perrault was aware of the Straparola tale, since 'Facetious Nights' was translated into French in the sixteenth century and subsequently passed into the oral tradition.
&lt;ref name="OpieP21"/&gt;

==Publication==
[[File:Straparola.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] is known as the writer of the oldest version of the tale. He probably invented the original story.]]
[[File:ChPerrault.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Detail of a portrait of [[Charles Perrault]] by [[Philippe Lallemand]]]]
The oldest record of written history was published in [[Venice]] by the Italian author [[Giovanni Francesco Straparola]] in his ''[[The Facetious Nights of Straparola]]'' (c. 1550-53) in XIV-XV. His original title was ''Costantino Fortunato'' (lit. ''Lucky Costantino'').
 
''Le Maître Chat, ou le Chat Botté'' was later published by Barbin in Paris in January 1697 in a collection of tales called ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé]]''.&lt;ref name="OpieP21" /&gt; The collection included "La Belle au bois dormant" ("The Sleeping Beauty in the Wood"), "Le petit chaperon rouge" ("Little Red Riding Hood"), "[[Bluebeard|La Barbe bleue]]" ("Blue Beard"), "[[Diamonds and Toads|Les Fées]]" ("The Enchanted Ones", or "Diamonds and Toads"), "Cendrillon, ou la petite pantoufle de verre" ("Cinderella, or The Little Glass Slipper"), "Riquet à la Houppe" ("[[Riquet with the Tuft]]"), and "[[Hop o' My Thumb|Le Petit Poucet]]" ("Hop o' My Thumb").&lt;ref name="OpieP21" /&gt; The book displayed a frontispiece depicting an old woman telling tales to a group of three children beneath a placard inscribed "CONTES DE MA MERE L'OYE" (Tales of Mother Goose).&lt;ref name="OpieP23" /&gt; The book was an instant success.&lt;ref name="OpieP21" /&gt;

''Le Maître Chat'' first was translated into English as "The Master Cat, or Puss in Boots" by [[Robert Samber]] in 1729 and published in London for J. Pote and R. Montagu with its original companion tales in ''Histories, or Tales of Past Times, By M. Perrault''.&lt;ref group="note"&gt;The distinction of being the first to translate the tales into English was long questioned. An edition styled ''Histories or Tales of Past Times, told by Mother Goose, with Morals. Written in French by M. Perrault, and Englished by G.M. Gent'' bore the publication date of 1719, thus casting doubt upon Samber being the first translator. In 1951, however, the date was proven to be a misprint for 1799 and Samber's distinction as the first translator was assured.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OpieP24" /&gt; The book was advertised in June 1729 as being "very entertaining and instructive for children".&lt;ref name="OpieP24"&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A frontispiece similar to that of the first French edition appeared in the English edition launching the [[Mother Goose|Mother Goose legend]] in the English-speaking world.&lt;ref name="OpieP23"&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|p=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samber's translation has been described as "faithful and straightforward, conveying attractively the concision, liveliness and gently ironic tone of Perrault's prose, which itself emulated the direct approach of oral narrative in its elegant simplicity."&lt;ref name="GillespieP351"&gt;{{Harvnb|Gillespie|p=351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since that publication, the tale has been translated into various languages and published around the world.

==Question of authorship==
Perrault's son Pierre Darmancour was assumed to have been responsible for the authorship of ''Histoires'' with the evidence cited being the book's dedication to [[Élisabeth Charlotte d'Orléans]], the youngest niece of [[Louis XIV of France|Louis XIV]], which was signed "P. Darmancour". Perrault senior, however, was known for some time to have been interested in ''contes de veille'' or ''contes de ma mère l'oye'', and in 1693 published a versification of "[[The Ridiculous Wishes|Les Souhaits Ridicules]]" and, in 1694, a tale with a Cinderella theme called "[[Donkeyskin|Peau d'Ane]]".&lt;ref name="OpieP23" /&gt; Further, a handwritten and illustrated manuscript of five of the tales (including ''Le Maistre Chat ou le Chat Botté'') existed two years before the tale's 1697 Paris publication.&lt;ref name="OpieP23" /&gt; Pierre Darmancour was sixteen or seventeen years old at the time the manuscript was prepared and, as scholars Iona and Peter Opie note, quite unlikely to have been interested in recording fairy tales.&lt;ref name=OpieP23 /&gt; Darmancour, who became a soldier, showed no literary inclinations, and, when he died in 1700, his obituary made no mention of any connection with the tales. However, when Perrault senior died in 1703, the newspaper alluded to his being responsible for "La Belle au bois dormant", which the paper had published in 1696.&lt;ref name="OpieP23" /&gt;

==Adaptations==

[[File:Pussboots.jpg|200px|thumb|right|[[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] as he appears in the 2004 film ''[[Shrek 2]]'']]
Perrault's tale has been adapted to various media over the centuries. [[Ludwig Tieck]] published a dramatic satire based on the tale, called ''Der gestiefelte Kater'',&lt;ref name="PaulinP65"&gt;{{Harvnb|Paulin|2002|p=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, in 1812, the [[Brothers Grimm]] inserted a version of the tale into their ''Kinder- und Hausmärchen''.&lt;ref name="WundererP202"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wunderer|2008|p=202}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ballet, Puss appears in the third act of [[Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky|Tchaikovsky]]'s ''[[The Sleeping Beauty (ballet)|The Sleeping Beauty]]'' in a ''pas de caractère'' with The White Cat.&lt;ref name="BrownP351" /&gt; In film and television, [[Walt Disney]] produced [[Puss in Boots (1922 film)|an animated black and white silent short]] based on the tale in 1922.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disneyshorts.org/shorts.aspx?shortID=7 |title=Puss in Boots |publisher=The Disney Encyclopedia of Animated Shorts |accessdate=2009-06-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also adapted into a manga by the famous Japanese writer and director [[Hayao Miyazaki]] in 1969, and in the mid-1980s, ''Puss in Boots'' was televised as [[Puss in Boots (Faerie Tale Theatre episode)|an episode]] of ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]'' with [[Ben Vereen]] and [[Gregory Hines]] in the cast.&lt;ref name="ZipesP102"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1997|p=102}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another version from the ''[[Cannon Movie Tales]]'' series features [[Christopher Walken]] as Puss, who in this adaptation is a cat who turns into a human when wearing the boots. Another adaptation of the character with little relation to the story was in the [[Pokémon]] anime episode "Like a Meowth to a Flame," where a [[Meowth]] owned by the character Tyson wore boots, a hat, and a neckerchief. [[DreamWorks Animation]] released the animated feature ''[[Puss in Boots (2011 film)|Puss in Boots]]'', with [[Antonio Banderas]] reprising his [[voice-over]] role of [[Puss in Boots (Shrek)|Puss in Boots]] from the ''[[Shrek]]'' films, on November 4, 2011. This new film's story bears no similarities to the book. The cat food named Puss n Boots is owned by Retrobrands USA LLC and is available in the United States and Canada.

==Commentaries==
Jacques Barchilon and Henry Pettit note in their introduction to ''The Authentic Mother Goose: Fairy Tales and Nursery Rhymes'' that the main motif of "Puss in Boots" is the [[donor (fairy tale)|animal as helper]] and that the tale "carries [[atavism|atavistic memories]] of the familiar [[totem]] animal as the father protector of the tribe found everywhere by missionaries and anthropologists." They also note that the title is original with Perrault as are the boots; no tale prior to Perrault's features a cat wearing boots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Barchilon|1960|pp=14,16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Slide61l.gif|thumb|upright|Woodcut [[book frontispiece|frontispiece]] copied from the 1697 Paris edition of Perrault's tales and published in the English-speaking world.]]

Folklorists [[Iona Opie|Iona]] and [[Peter Opie]] observe that "the tale is unusual in that the hero little deserves his good fortune, that is if his poverty, his being a third child, and his unquestioning acceptance of the cat's sinful instructions, are not nowadays looked upon as virtues." The cat should be acclaimed the prince of 'con' artists, they declare, as few swindlers have been so successful before or since.&lt;ref name="OpieP110"&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; The success of ''Histoires'' is attributed to seemingly contradictory and incompatible reasons. While the literary skill employed in the telling of the tales has been recognized universally, it appears the tales were set down in great part as the author ''heard'' them told. The evidence for that assessment lies first in the simplicity of the tales, then in the use of words that were, in Perrault's era, considered ''populaire'' and ''du bas peuple'', and finally, in the appearance of [[vestige|vestigial]] passages that now are superfluous to the plot, do not illuminate the narrative, and thus, are passages the Opies believe a literary artist would have rejected in the process of creating a work of art. One such vestigial passage is Puss's boots; his insistence upon the footwear is explained nowhere in the tale, it is not developed, nor is it referred to after its first mention except in an aside.&lt;ref name="OpieP22"&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|p=22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Opies, Perrault's great achievement was accepting fairy tales at "their own level." He neither recounted them with impatience nor mockery, and without feeling that they needed any aggrandisement such as a [[frame story]]—although he must have felt it useful to end with a rhyming ''moralité''. Perrault would be revered today as the father of [[folklore]] if he had taken the time to record where he obtained his tales, when, and under what circumstances.&lt;ref name="OpieP22" /&gt;

[[Bruno Bettelheim]] remarks that "the more simple and straightforward a good character in a fairy tale, the easier it is for a child to identify with it and to reject the bad other." The child identifies with a good hero because the hero's condition makes a positive appeal to him. If the character is a very good person, then the child is likely to want to be good too. Amoral tales, however, show no polarization or juxtaposition of good and bad persons because amoral tales such as "Puss in Boots" build character, not by offering choices between good and bad, but by giving the child hope that even the meekest can survive. Morality is of little concern in these tales, but rather, an assurance is provided that one can survive and succeed in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Bettleheim|1977|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small children can do little on their own and may give up in disappointment and despair with their attempts. Fairy stories, however, give great dignity to the smallest achievements (such as befriending an animal or being befriended by an animal, as in "Puss in Boots") and that such ordinary events may lead to great things. Fairy stories encourage children to believe and trust that their small, real achievements are important although perhaps not recognized at the moment.&lt;ref name="OpieP73"&gt;{{Harvnb|Bettelheim|1977|p=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Charles Perrault02.jpg|thumb|left|upright|An early nineteenth-century engraving of Perrault surrounded by vignettes from ''[[Histoires ou contes du temps passé]]'']]

In ''Fairy Tales and the Art of Subversion'' [[Jack Zipes]] notes that Perrault "sought to portray ideal types to reinforce the standards of the civilizing process set by upper-class French society".&lt;ref name="ZipesP26" /&gt; A composite portrait of Perrault's heroines, for example, reveals the author's idealized female of upper-class society is graceful, beautiful, polite, industrious, well groomed, reserved, patient, and even somewhat stupid because for Perrault, intelligence in womankind would be threatening. Therefore, Perrault's composite heroine passively waits for "the right man" to come along, recognize her virtues, and make her his wife. He acts, she waits. If his seventeenth century heroines demonstrate any characteristics, it is submissiveness.&lt;ref name="ZipesP25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1991|p=25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A composite of Perrault's male heroes, however, indicates the opposite of his heroines: his male characters are not particularly handsome, but they are active, brave, ambitious, and deft, and they use their wit, intelligence, and great civility to work their way up the social ladder and to achieve their goals. In this case of course, it is the cat who displays the characteristics and the man benefits from his trickery and skills. Unlike the tales dealing with submissive heroines waiting for marriage, the male-centered tales suggest social status and achievement are more important than marriage for men. The virtues of Perrault's heroes reflect upon the bourgeoisie of the court of [[Louis XIV]] and upon the nature of Perrault, who was a successful civil servant in France during the seventeenth century.&lt;ref name="ZipesP26" /&gt;

According to fairy and folk tale researcher and commentator Jack Zipes, Puss is "the epitome of the educated bougeois secretary who serves his master with complete devotion and diligence."&lt;ref name="ZipesP25" /&gt; The cat has enough wit and manners to impress the king, the intelligence to defeat the ogre, and the skill to arrange a royal marriage for his low-born master. Puss's career is capped by his elevation to ''grand seigneur''&lt;ref name="ZipesP26"&gt;{{Harvnb|Zipes|1991|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the tale is followed by a double moral: "one stresses the importance of possessing ''industrie et [[List of French words and phrases used by English speakers#S|savoir faire]]'' while the other extols the virtues of dress, countenance, and youth to win the heart of a princess."&lt;ref name="ZipesP26" /&gt;

The renowned illustrator of [[Charles Dickens|Dickens]]' novels and stories, [[George Cruikshank]], was shocked that parents would allow their children to read "Puss in Boots" and declared: "As it stood the tale was a succession of successful falsehoods—a clever lesson in lying!—a system of imposture rewarded with the greatest worldly advantages."

Another critic, [[Maria Tatar]], notes that there is little to admire in Puss—he threatens, flatters, deceives, and steals in order to promote his master. She further observes that Puss has been viewed as a "linguistic virtuoso", a creature who has mastered the arts of persuasion and rhetoric to acquire power and wealth.&lt;ref name="TatarP234"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2002|p=234}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Puss in Boots" has successfully supplanted its antecedents by Straparola and Basile and the tale has altered the shapes of many older oral trickster cat tales where they still are found. The morals Perrault attached to the tales are either at odds with the narrative, or beside the point. The first moral tells the reader that hard work and ingenuity are preferable to inherited wealth, but the moral is belied by the poor miller's son who neither works nor uses his wit to gain worldly advantage, but marries into it through trickery performed by the cat. The second moral stresses womankind's vulnerability to external appearances: fine clothes and a pleasant visage are enough to win their hearts. In an aside, Tatar suggests that if the tale has any redeeming meaning, "it has something to do with inspiring respect for those domestic creatures that hunt mice and look out for their masters."&lt;ref name="TatarP235"&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2002|p=235}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Briggs does assert that cats were a form of fairy in their own right having something akin to a fairy court and their own set of magical powers. Still, it is rare in Europe's fairy tales for a cat to be so closely involved with human affairs. According to Jacob Grimm, Puss shares many of the features that a household fairy or deity would have including a desire for boots which could represent [[seven-league boots]]. This may mean that the story of "Puss and Boots" originally represented the tale of a family deity aiding an impoverished family member.&lt;ref&gt;name=Nukiuk|2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Stefan Zweig, in his 1939 novel, ''Ungeduld des Herzens'', references Puss in Boots' procession through a rich and varied countryside with his master and drives home his metaphor with a mention of Seven League Boots.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3041">In the [[visual arts]], '''shape''' is a flat, enclosed area of an artwork created through lines, textures, colours or an area enclosed by other shapes such as triangles, circles, and squares.&lt;ref name="niu"&gt;[http://www.niu.edu/art/foundations/site/Vocabulary.htm  NIU School of Art Vocabulary] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040624191040/http://www.niu.edu/art/foundations/site/Vocabulary.htm |date=2004-06-24 }} URL accessed December 15, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise, a '''form''' can refer to a three-dimensional composition or object within a three-dimensional composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Stewart | page = 381}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, it is an enclosed space, the boundaries of which are defined by other elements of art. Shapes are limited to two dimensions: length and width.

== Form ==
A form is an artist's way of using elements of art, principles of design, and media. Element of art that is three-dimensional and encloses space. Like a shape, a form has length and width, but it also has depth. Forms are either geometric or free-form.

==Categories==

===Geometric and organic===
''Geometric shapes'' are precise edged and mathematically consistent curves,{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} they are pure forms and so consist of circles, squares, spirals, triangles, while ''geometric forms'' are simple volumes, such as cubes, cylinders and pyramids.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Stewart | pages = 378–384}}&lt;/ref&gt; They generally dominate architecture, technology, industry and crystalline structures.

In contrast, ''organic shapes'' are free-form, unpredictable and flowing in appearance. These shapes, as well as ''organic forms'', visually suggest the natural world of animals, plants, sky, sea, etc... The addition of organic shapes to a composition dominated by geometric structures can add unpredictable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Stewart | page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Bell Shaped Flowers.jpg|thumb|Bell-shaped flowers]]

===Positive and negative===
A positive shape is a shape, that has details inside it, such as an outline of a human, with body features. Contrarily, a negative shape is a shape without any details; it's just an outline.

'''Software studies''' is an emerging [[interdisciplinary]] research field, which studies [[software systems]] and their social and cultural effects.

==Overview==
The implementation and use of software has been studied in recent fields such as [[cyberculture]], [[Internet studies]], [[new media studies]], and [[digital culture]], yet prior to software studies, software was rarely ever addressed as a distinct object of study.

Software studies is an interdisciplinary field. To study software as an artifact, it draws upon methods and theory from the [[digital humanities]] and from computational perspectives on software. Methodologically, software studies usually differs from the approaches of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], which concern themselves primarily with software in information theory and in practical application; however, these fields all share an emphasis on computer literacy, particularly in the areas of programming and source code. This emphasis on analyzing software sources and processes (rather than interfaces) often distinguishes software studies from new media studies, which is usually restricted to discussions of interfaces and observable effects.

==History==
The conceptual origins of software studies include [[Marshall McLuhan]]'s focus on the role of media in themselves, rather than the content of media platforms, in shaping culture. Early references to the study of software as a cultural practice appear in [[Friedrich Kittler]]'s essay, "Es gibt keine Software,"&lt;ref name="Kittler, 1993"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Reclam| pages = 225–242| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = Draculas Vermächtnis: Technische Schriften| chapter = Es gibt keine Software| location = Leipzig| year = 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last = Kittler| first = Friedrich| title = There is no software| work = CTheory.net| accessdate = 2013-01-19| date = 1995| url = http://www.ctheory.net/articles.aspx?id=74}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lev Manovich]]'s ''Language of New Media'',&lt;ref name="Manovich, 2001"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = MIT Press| isbn = 0-262-13374-1 | pages = xxxix, 354| last = Manovich| first = Lev| title = The language of new media| year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Matthew Fuller's ''Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software''.&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2003"&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Autonomedia| isbn = 1-57027-139-9 | page = 165| last = Fuller| first = Matthew| title = Behind the Blip: Essays on the culture of software| year = 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the impetus for the development of software studies has come from videogame studies, particularly platform studies, the study of videogames and other software artifacts in their hardware and software contexts. New media art, software art, motion graphics, and [[computer-aided design]] are also significant software-based cultural practices, as is the creation of new protocols and platforms.

The first conference events in the emerging field were Software Studies Workshop 2006 and SoftWhere 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100327185154/http://pzwart.wdka.hro.nl/mdr/Seminars2/softstudworkshop Software Studies Workshop] Rotterdam 2006 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://workshop.softwarestudies.com/ SoftWhere: Software Studies Workshop] San Diego 2008 conference website&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, [[MIT Press]] launched a ''Software Studies'' book series&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Fuller |first=Matthew |author2=Lev Manovich |author3=Noah Wardrip-Fruin |title=Software Studies - Series |work=MIT Press |accessdate=2013-01-18 |date=2010 |url=http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100803154024/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/browse/browse.asp?btype=6&amp;serid=179 |archivedate=August 3, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; with an edited volume of essays (Matthew Fuller's "Software Studies: a Lexicon"),&lt;ref name="Fuller, 2008"&gt;{{cite book | last = Fuller | first = Matthew | title = Software Studies: a lexicon | year = 2008 | publisher = The MIT Press | url = http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100717061342/http://mitpress.mit.edu/catalog/item/default.asp?ttype=2&amp;tid=11476 | archivedate = 2010-07-17 | isbn = 0-262-06274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first academic program was launched, ([[Lev Manovich]], [[Benjamin H. Bratton]] and [[Noah Wardrip-Fruin]]'s "Software Studies Initiative" at U. California San Diego).&lt;ref&gt;[http://lab.softwarestudies.com/ Software Studies Initiative @ UCSD] official website&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
In 2011, a number of mainly British researchers established ''Computational Culture'', an open-access peer-reviewed journal. The journal provides a platform for "inter-disciplinary enquiry into the nature of the culture of computational objects, practices, processes and structures."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gold.ac.uk/cultural-studies/calendar/?id=4870|title=Computational Culture: Double Book Launch and Launch of Computational Culture, a journal of software studies|work=Goldsmiths|date=December 2011|accessdate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related fields==
Software studies is closely related to a number of other emerging fields in the [[digital humanities]] that explore functional components of technology from a social and cultural perspective.  Software studies' focus is at the level of the entire program, specifically the relationship between interface and code.  Notably related are [[critical code studies]], which is more closely attuned to the code rather than the program,&lt;ref&gt;http://criticalcodestudies.com/wordpress&lt;/ref&gt; and platform studies, which investigates the relationships between hardware and software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Bogost | first = Ian |author2=Nick Montfort  | title = Platform Studies, a book series published by MIT Press | work = Platform Studies | accessdate = 2013-01-18 | url = http://platformstudies.com/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last = Kirschenbaum| first = Matthew| title = Where Computer Science and Cultural Studies Collide [paywalled]| journal = The Chronicle of Higher Education| accessdate = 2013-01-18| date = 2009-01-23| url = http://chronicle.com/article/Where-Computer-Science-and/14806}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spaceship Earth''''' is a 350,000-pound Brazilian blue [[quartzite]] sculpture created by Finnish American artist [[Eino]].&lt;ref name='Birth'&gt;{{cite news | first=Angela | last=Hill | title=175-ton East Bay-inspired 'Earth Spaceship' needs landing pad | date=2007-03-24 | publisher=MediaNews Group, Inc. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =Alameda Times-Star | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The sculpture was commissioned by Brian Maxwell of [[Powerbar]] the Maxwell Family Foundation for the late environmentalist [[David Brower]] and its name was often used by Brower referring to mankind traveling through life in a common vehicle.&lt;ref name='possible'&gt;{{cite news | first=Kristin | last=Bender | title=Artist's tribute may get a home;Berkeley Marina probable site for 'Spaceship Earth,' a memorial | date=2004-07-12 | publisher=MediaNews Group, Inc. and ANG Newspapers | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =Alameda Times-Star | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today the sculpture is located at [[Kennesaw State University]] adjacent to the Social Science building, the first [[Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design|LEED]]-certified building at the [[University System of Georgia]].&lt;ref name='kennesaw'&gt;{{cite news | first=Stacey | last=Moore | title=Spaceship Earth sculpture unveiled | date=2006-10-30 | publisher=[[Kennesaw State University]] | url=http://acsdevl.kennesaw.edu/access/story.asp?sto=340 | archive-url=https://archive.is/20070620001812/http://acsdevl.kennesaw.edu/access/story.asp?sto=340 | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2007-06-20 | work=Access Online | accessdate=2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 175-ton chunk of rock was formed from 88 individual pieces of [[quartzite]] and bonded with specially made [[polyepoxide]].&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt;  After these pieces were in place, Eino attached a life-size bronze model of the late Brower.  Additionally, 2,400 bronze pieces were added to the exterior to outline land masses on the earth.&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt;

''Spaceship Earth'' was completed in August 2006 and unveiled in October.&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt;  The sculpture broke apart and started spilling over just two months later.  First reports cited poor adhesive and unsound construction contributed to its demise while Eino argued that it had to have been an act of vandalism.  The sculpture was rededicated in November 2006.&lt;ref name='collapse'&gt;{{cite news | title=Earth Collapses | publisher =[[Associated Press]] | url =http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=news/bizarre&amp;id=5723603 | accessdate = 2009-12-31 | date = 2007-10-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

A few months before the November 2000 death of the first Executive Director [[Sierra Club]] and lifelong environmentalist David Brower, the founders of [[PowerBar]], Brian and Jennifer Maxwell,  commissioned the 175-ton tribute in his honor.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt; It was during a morning run with photographer Galen Rowell and PowerBar's Brian Maxwell that the tribute was conceived.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;  Shortly after Maxwell met with his friend, environmentalist and Finnish-American artist Eino, to create such a sculpture.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;

Eino was sent stone samples from a rock quarry in Brazil at the start of the project and "[he] thought, oh my, this is three times harder than marble. But immediately I understood this was the right stone. It is more permanent than anything else. No pollution can hurt it. No graffiti will harm it. It was the right stone to be here for 1,000 years."&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt; Over 175 tons of Brazilian blue quartzite was shipped and stored in a parking lot while Eino and Maxwell sought to secure a home for the sculpture.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;  Locations in Berkeley to Washington, D.C., were proposed, but all were turned down by local art commissions or city councils.&lt;ref name='Birth'/&gt;&lt;ref name='Halted' /&gt;  For nearly a year, Eino argued to have the sculpture placed in the streets of San Francisco, but the San Francisco Arts Commission’s Visual Arts Committee turned it down by saying it "not only had little or nothing to do with the city" but "was too big and did not represent Brower's ideals."&lt;ref name='Finding'&gt;{{cite news | first=Leah | last=Garchik | title=175-ton East Bay-inspired 'Earth Spaceship' needs landing pad | date=2003-08-13 | publisher=The Chronicle Publishing Co. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work = The San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Home' /&gt;

Later, in 2004, Jennifer Maxwell, then the widow of Brian Maxwell, contacted the City of Berkeley to find a home for the tribute.&lt;ref name='sleepwalking'&gt;{{cite news | first=Ken | last=Coupland | title=Spaceship Earth Tries to Land A sleepwalking David Brower sculpture looks for a home | date=2004-09-15 | publisher=East Bay Express Publishing, LP | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =East Bay Express | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A few members of the Berkeley Arts Commission spoke out against the sculpture's design and how it seemed to be forced on the city.  In October 2004, the commission voted 7-2 to accept the sculpture with conditions.&lt;ref name='altered'&gt;{{cite news | first=Patrick | last=Hoge | title=Panel OKs accepting altered sculpture | date=2004-10-30 | publisher=The Chronicle Publishing Co. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work = The San Francisco Chronicle | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  For final approval by the Civic Art Commission {{convert|15|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} sculpture could not be adorned with the bronze statue of Brower, and the Maxwell family had to pay the entire installation cost.&lt;ref name='Halted'&gt;{{cite news | first=Susan | last=Kuchinskas | title=Lost in Space | date=2005-08-03 | publisher=East Bay Express Publishing, LP | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =East Bay Express | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='altered' /&gt;  By 2005, with a push from the Mayor, the Civic Art Commission found nearly 30 different locations the sculpture could live.&lt;ref name='possible' /&gt;&lt;ref name='sleepwalking' /&gt; In August 2005, two Berkeley area commissions voted to consider another location.&lt;ref name='Halted' /&gt;  While negotiations were dragging on with bureaucrats in Berkeley, officials at [[Kennesaw State University]] contacted Eino and accepted the memorial.&lt;ref name='Home'&gt;{{cite news | title='Spaceship Earth' to land in Georgia | date=2005-11-04 | publisher=U.P.I. | url =http://www.lexisnexis.com/ | work =UPI | accessdate = 2007-11-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the sculpture resides at [[Kennesaw State University]], adjacent to the Social Science building.&lt;ref name='Home' /&gt; Nearly six years after its conception, Spaceship Earth was finished and unveiled on October 20, 2006.&lt;ref name='kennesaw' /&gt; In late December 2006, only three months after its installation on campus, ''Spaceship Earth'' collapsed. The sculpture was intended to be a permanent reminder to future generations to take care of their delicate planet. After the collapse, Eino attributed the disaster to vandalism, but later reports associated the collapse with poor construction. Reconstruction was to begin in February 2007 but was delayed until July and was completed by November 2007.&lt;ref name='collapse' /&gt;

In 2017, multiple female students of the school came forward and stated that Franco had behaved in inappropriate or sexually exploitative ways while serving as their teacher.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-james-franco-allegations-20180111-htmlstory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
Studio 4 was created to provide a place for students to be grounded in acting and focus on performance while not having to be tied up with additional school requirements.  Franco wanted to emulate the creative environment he found at Playhouse West, in addition to providing opportunities through his production company, [[Rabbit Bandini Productions]], that would otherwise not available to acting, directing, or writing students.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.backstage.com/news/james-franco-says-class-session/|title=James Franco Says Class Is in Session|newspaper=Backstage.com|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://deadline.com/2014/02/one-more-hyphenate-for-james-franco-acting-school-headmaster-677054/|title=One More Hyphenate For James Franco: Acting School Headmaster|last=Jr|first=Mike Fleming|date=2014-02-04|newspaper=Deadline|language=en-US|access-date=2017-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The school offered a two-year [[Sanford Meisner|Meisner technique]] conservatory study for actors and on-going [[screenwriting]] and [[Film director|directing]] courses that were instructed by working industry professionals.  Among some of the school guests instructors and lecturers include: [[James Caan]], [[John Patrick Shanley]], [[Ahna O'Reilly]], [[Campbell Scott]], [[Scott Caan]], [[Paul Calderón|Paul Calderon]], Alex Morf, [[Pamela Romanowsky]], Joel Marsh Garland, [[Gabrielle Demeestere]], [[Natalie Gold]], [[Tom Leopold]], and [[Horatio Sanz]].

== Sexual misconduct allegations ==
In 2017, multiple female students of the school came forward and stated that Franco had behaved in inappropriate or sexually exploitative ways while serving as their teacher. One student stated that Franco "would always make everybody think there were possible roles on the table if we were to perform sexual acts or take off our shirts" in his projects. Another student stated that Franco held a sex scenes class and removed students' vaginal guards while simulating oral sex with them.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/business/hollywood/la-fi-ct-james-franco-allegations-20180111-htmlstory.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's initial German title is '''''Der ewige Jude''''', the German term for the character of the "[[Wandering Jew]]" in medieval folklore. At the insistence of [[Nazi Germany]]'s [[Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Minister of Propaganda]], [[Joseph Goebbels]], the film was directed by [[Fritz Hippler]].

With a screenplay credited to [[Eberhard Taubert]], the film consists of feature and documentary footage combined with materials filmed shortly after the [[Occupation of Poland (1939-1945)|Nazi occupation of Poland]]. At this time, Poland's Jewish population was about three million, roughly ten percent of the total population. Actor [[Harry Giese]] narrated.

==Background==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 119-04-29-36, München, Ausstellung "Der ewige Jude".jpg|thumb|left|The interior of the exhibition ''The Eternal Jew'' (1937/1938)]]
[[File:Plakat der ewige Jude, 1937.jpg|thumb|right|Poster for ''The Eternal Jew'' exhibition, 1937]]
Hitler and Goebbels believed that film was a vital tool for molding public opinion.  The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] first established a film department in 1930 and Goebbels had taken a personal interest in the use of film to promote the Nazi philosophy and agenda.  Soon after the Nazi takeover, Goebbels insisted in speeches that the role of the German cinema was to serve as the "vanguard of the Nazi military".&lt;ref name="Eisner2008"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eisner|first=Lotte H. |title=The Haunted Screen: Expressionism in the German Cinema and the Influence of Max Reinhardt|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=lwZ_S6ap1LcC&amp;pg=PA329|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=29 September 2008|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-25790-0|page=329}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Goebbels film appears to have been intended as a violently anti-Semitic version of the British film ''[[The Wandering Jew (1933 film)|The Wandering Jew]]'', which argued that Jews were victims of relentless persecution throughout history. Saul Friedländer suggests that Goebbels' intent was to counter three films: [[Jew Süss (1934 film)|''Jew Süss'']], ''[[The House of Rothschild]]'', and ''The Wandering Jew''. These three films, all released in 1933-34, showed that Jews were persecuted throughout history; the Goebbels films presented the opposite message.&lt;ref name="Friedländer2008_20"&gt;{{cite book|last=Friedländer|first=Saul|title=The Years of Extermination: Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1939-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7KaCGDUys50C&amp;pg=PA20|accessdate=21 November 2018|date=6 October 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-093048-6|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, a special wing of the [[Reichs Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda|Propaganda Ministry]] put on an art exhibition in [[Munich]] titled ''[[The Eternal Jew (art exhibition)|Der ewige Jude]]''.  It followed this up with the publication of [[The Eternal Jew (book)|a book of the same title]], consisting of 265 photographs, each with a derogatory caption asserting the degeneracy of the Jewish race.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Jewish Virtual Library: The Eternal Jew |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Holocaust/eternal.html |accessdate=13 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Maxwell2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Maxwell|first=Anne |title=Picture Imperfect: Photography and Eugenics, 1870-1940|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=X99qg-eQDKcC&amp;pg=PA178|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=1 April 2010|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-415-4|page=178}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1938, Goebbels made a series of attacks against the Jews in the German media that were a factor which resulted in the pogrom known as [[Kristallnacht]].  Despite the emotional satisfaction afforded the Nazis by carrying out their antisemitism with direct violence, Kristallnacht was considered by Hitler to have been a political disaster both within Germany and internationally.  Not only did the brutality indirectly caused by Goebbels evoke harsh criticism internationally, the mixed reaction in the German media showed a lack of broad-based support among Germans for antisemitism and violence.&lt;ref name="Fritz2011 p. 15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fritz|first=Stephen G. |title=Ostkrieg: Hitler's War of Extermination in the East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNsg8VBGs8AC&amp;pg=PA15|accessdate=21 November 2018|date=8 September 2011|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-3416-1|page=15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hitler expressed his frustration and anger at the mixed response from the German media and insisted that, instead of openly calling for violence against the Jews as Goebbels had in instigating the pogrom, Nazi propaganda should "elucidate events of foreign policy" in such a way that the German people themselves would call for violence against the Jews.&lt;ref name="Fritz2011 p. 15" /&gt;&lt;ref name=Hazkani_2008&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Moreshet |date=Summer 2008 |first=Shay|last=Hazkani|title=Forbidden Films – An Analysis of the Nazi Propaganda Films The Eternal Jew and Jew Suess and Their Influence on the German Public|page=181|url=http://issuu.com/shay_hazkani/docs/hazkani_y5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to Hitler's harsh reprimand, Goebbels launched a campaign to promote the anti-Semitic views of the Nazis to the German populace. He ordered each film studio to make an anti-Semitic film.  In the case of ''The Eternal Jew'', Goebbels conceived of a film that would communicate to the German people the same antisemitic message that had been the theme of the 1937 Munich exhibition. Hitler preferred films such as ''The Eternal Jew'' which presented the Nazi anti-Semitic agenda openly and directly; however Goebbels disliked the crudeness of such straightforward approaches, preferring the much more subtle approach of couching anti-Semitic messages in an engaging story with popular appeal.  The film ''[[Jud Süß (1940 film)|Jud Süß]]'' is an example of Goebbels' preferred approach.&lt;ref name="Rees2006"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rees|first=Laurence |title=Auschwitz: A New History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Wh9QVS3A5QIC&amp;pg=PR16|accessdate=8 November 2011|date=9 January 2006|publisher=PublicAffairs|isbn=978-1-58648-357-9|page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Although Goebbels did not generally take an active role in the production of particular films, he elected to do so in the case of major propaganda films such as ''The Eternal Jew''.&lt;ref name="Friedländer2008_20" /&gt; The film was in production for over a year.&lt;ref name="HaggithNewman2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haggith|first1=Toby |last2=Newman|first2=Joanna |title=Holocaust and the moving image: representations in film and television since 1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hetrpvcBuuEC&amp;pg=PA85|accessdate=16 November 2011|date=1 August 2005|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-904764-51-9|page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout the end of 1939 and the beginning of 1940, Goebbels devoted "constant attention" to the production of what he referred to as "the Jew film".&lt;ref name="FriedländerKenan2009"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Friedländer|first1=Saul |last2=Kenan|first2=Orna|title=Nazi Germany and the Jews, 1933-1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EY2npqn0J8UC&amp;pg=PA153|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=10 March 2009|publisher=HarperCollins|isbn=978-0-06-135027-6|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As early as 1938, Goebbels had wanted to have a film crew travel to Poland to shoot the ghetto scenes; however, he was unable to gain permission from the Polish government.  In October and November 1939, almost immediately after the German/Soviet [[invasion of Poland]], he instructed Hippler to send camera crews to [[Łódź]], [[Warsaw]], [[Cracow]] and [[Lublin]] to shoot footage of Polish Jews.&lt;ref name="Etlin2002_148"&gt;{{cite book|last=Etlin|first=Richard A. |title=Art, culture, and media under the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQXoZ3oZ3-cC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=15 October 2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22087-1|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PagesRhiel2008"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Pages|first1=Neil Christian |last2=Rhiel|first2=Mary |last3=O'Sickey|first3=Ingeborg Majer |title=Riefenstahl screened: an anthology of new criticism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4vf4k0Y3mMcC&amp;pg=PA96|accessdate=14 November 2011|date=1 May 2008|publisher=Continuum International Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-8264-2801-1|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The footage that Hippler shot in the Jewish ghettos of those cities in German occupied Poland was the only footage shot specifically for the purpose of the film.  At the beginning of the film, animated text informs the audience that this "documentary footage" shows Jews in their original state "before they put on the mask of civilized Europeans."&lt;ref name="Reimer2002_135"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reimer|first=Robert C. |title=Cultural History Through a National Socialist Lens: Essays on the Cinema of the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zf0FW0fjLNQC&amp;pg=PA135|accessdate=16 November 2011|year=2002|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-134-8|page=135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Nazi press, Hippler expanded on this claim, asserting that his filming techniques captured Jews "in an unprejudiced manner, real to life as they live and as they react in their own surroundings."&lt;ref name="Reimer2002_136"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reimer|first=Robert C. |title=Cultural History Through a National Socialist Lens: Essays on the Cinema of the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Zf0FW0fjLNQC&amp;pg=PA136|accessdate=16 November 2011|year=2002|publisher=Camden House|isbn=978-1-57113-134-8|page=136 |quote=In the Nazi press, Hippler explained, "No Jew was forced into any kind of action or position during the shooting. Moreover, we let the filmed Jews be on their own and tried to shoot in moments when they were unaware of the camera's presence.  Consequently, we have rendered the Ghetto Jews in an unprejudiced manner, real to life as they live and as they react in their own surroundings.  All who see this film will be convinced that there is never a forced or scared expression in the faces of the Jews who are filmed passing by, trading or attending ritual services."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Hippler advertised the film as being a factual documentary consisting of pictures of real Jews with nothing faked or simulated, his claims were complete falsehoods.  In reality, the film was an exercise in manipulation for the purposes of propaganda.  In shooting his footage, Hippler did in fact simulate scenes and use actors who were performing under duress and without knowledge of how the footage would be employed.  For example, in order to get shots of Jewish worship services, Hippler and Goebbels assembled the congregation of the Vilker synagogue, ordered them to wear the ''tallithim'' and ''tefillin'' and hold a full-scale service.  When the Germans ordered the Torah reader to read from the Torah, he started by saying on camera "Today is Tuesday" signalling that his reading of the Torah was coerced since it was not customary to read the Torah on Tuesdays.&lt;ref name="FriedländerKenan2009" /&gt;

Aside from the footage shot in Poland, the rest of the film consisted of stills and archival footage from feature films (often without permission) that the film presented as if they were documentary footage.&lt;ref name="HuenerNicosia2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Huener|first1=Jonathan |last2=Nicosia|first2=Francis R. |title=The arts in Nazi Germany: continuity, conformity, change|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ynlpiQ7LUjsC&amp;pg=PA72|accessdate=12 November 2011|year=2006|publisher=Berghahn Books|isbn=978-1-84545-209-4|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format and structure==
The movie was produced in a documentary format and, like other Hippler films, relied heavily on narration.&lt;ref name="Barnouw1993 pp. 141–142"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnouw|first=Erik|title=Documentary: a history of the non-fiction film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtZ91DNvgBMC&amp;pg=PA141|accessdate=17 November 2011|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507898-5|pages=141–142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film can be roughly divided into four thematic areas:
* Recordings from Polish ghettos
* Enumeration and evaluation of numerous political, cultural and social values in the international arena of Jewish origin
* Religious ceremonies, religious instruction, worship, ritual slaughter
* Adolf Hitler's Reichstag speech, parading SA troops

==Themes==
Richard Barsam writes the film's "essential contrast is between myths and stereotypes of Jews and the Nazi ideal of a 'master race,' between the alleged inferiority of the Jews and the superiority of the Germans."&lt;ref name="Barsam1992_204"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barsam|first=Richard Meran |title=Nonfiction film: a critical history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7p36FdLYdIC&amp;pg=PA204|accessdate=12 December 2011|year=1992|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20706-7|page=204}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stephen Fritz, Goebbels' intent was to create a film that would serve as "both a demonstration of the parasitical nature of the Jews and a justification for drastic measures against them."&lt;ref name="Fritz2011 p. 22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fritz|first=Stephen G. |title=Ostkrieg: Hitler's War of Extermination in the East|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kNsg8VBGs8AC&amp;pg=PA22|accessdate=21 November 2018|date=8 September 2011|publisher=University Press of Kentucky|isbn=978-0-8131-3416-1|page=22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Maria Tatar writes that the Nazis were able to use Hippler's film to "position the victims of their genocidal project as dangerous aggressors who had to be exterminated."&lt;ref name="Hantke2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hantke|first=Steffen|title=Horror Film: Creating and Marketing Fear|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oAX81WbAcfcC&amp;pg=PA23|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=9 September 2009|publisher=Univ. Press of Mississippi|isbn=978-1-60473-376-1|page=23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Barsam describes the film as arguing that "Jews are criminals;... they have no soul;... they are different in every way;... killing them is not a crime, but a necessity—just as killing rats is a necessity to preserve health and cleanliness."&lt;ref name="Barsam1992_205"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barsam|first=Richard Meran|title=Nonfiction film: a critical history|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z7p36FdLYdIC&amp;pg=PA205|accessdate=12 December 2011|year=1992|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-20706-7|page=205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Unser Wille und Weg'', a Nazi Party monthly publication aimed at propagandists, provides a rationale for why ''The Eternal Jew'' was made.  The author of the essay "The Film of a 2000-Year Rat Migration,"&lt;ref name=UnserWille&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/ewig.htm|title=A Nazi review of 'The Eternal Jew'}}&lt;/ref&gt; who remains anonymous, believes the film shows "a full picture of Jewry" and provides "the best treatment of this parasitic race."  The author connects the Jews' migration from the Middle East to Egypt and their following of German colonists to rats traveling as a group, who "even then displayed the same criminal traits that they still displayed".  The film is complimented for "its portrayal of the Jews' vulgar methods and the brutality and all-devouring hatred they exhibit when they reach their goal and control finance."&lt;ref name=UnserWille /&gt; The slaughtering method causes the author to question the "so-called Jewish religion", as butchers do their work with grins on their face.&lt;ref name=UnserWille /&gt; In closing, the author states the film will be a valuable tool in the struggle to break the Jews' "power over us.  We are the initiators of the fight against world Jewry, which now directs its hate, its brutal greed and destructive will toward us.  We must win this battle for ourselves, for Europe, for the world."&lt;ref name=UnserWille /&gt;

===Jews as an uncivilized and parasitic people===

Richard Taylor describes the basic tenet of the film as arguing that "the Jew is an oriental barbarian who has insinuated himself cleverly into European society, and now exploits it parasitically."&lt;ref name="Taylor1998_175"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taylor |first=Richard |title=Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SQ2ihtMCI5QC&amp;pg=PA175 |accessdate=12 November 2011 |year=1998 |publisher=I. B. Tauris |isbn=978-1-86064-167-1 |page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt; This point is emphasized throughout the film, starting from the very opening lines of the film's commentary:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The "civilized" Jews that we know in Germany give us only an incomplete picture of their racial character.  This film shows genuine shots of the Polish ghettos.  It shows the Jews as they really are, before they conceal themselves behind the mask of the civilized European.&lt;ref name="Taylor1998_175" /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following this commentary, the film provides a succession of scenes in which Jews are portrayed as an uncivilized, parasitic people with low social standing. The images were mostly shot on site in the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] and other Polish ghettos, showing subjects who were deliberately chosen to be poorly dressed, dirty and who had partially toothless grins. The locations shown are dirty and infested by vermin. Robert Reimer asserts that a central theme of the film is the assertion that "Jews have always lived in the ghettos and in fact they ''choose'' to live this way."  According to Reimer, the film asserts that ghettos are "ordinary [and] normal" aspects of Jewish life.  Reimer charges that what the film is actually showing is not the normal life of Polish Jewry but rather the "effect of the Nazi administration and the disruption of the lives of millions of Polish Jews."&lt;ref name="Reimer2002_135"/&gt; Erik Barnouw describes the [[Warsaw Ghetto]] after the Nazi conquest as a place where "hundreds of thousands of Jews were herded by the [[Nazi]] conquerors into pockets of indescribable misery."  He describes footage shot there as showing "half-starved, unshaven creatures caught in pathetic acts of barter - a pair of socks for a scrap of food." It is scenes such as these that the film presents as showing Jews "in their natural state."&lt;ref name="Barnouw1993"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnouw|first=Erik|title=Documentary: a history of the non-fiction film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtZ91DNvgBMC&amp;pg=PA141|accessdate=17 November 2011|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507898-5|page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film utilizes a [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] that juxtaposes these images of ghetto Jews with images of rats to draw an analogy between the migration of Jews from Eastern Europe with the migration of rats.  For example, one of the shots shows a pack of [[rat]]s emerging from a sewer, followed by a shot of a crowd of Jews in a bustling street of the [[Łódź Ghetto]]. Close-ups of those in the crowd reveal sickly, malformed facial features. The narrator states that, as rats are the vermin of the animal kingdom, Jews are the vermin of the human race and similarly spread disease and corruption. Unlike rats, however, the narrator continues, Jews have the uncanny ability to change their appearance and blend into their "human hosts." A scene depicts four bearded men in traditional religious Jewish clothing, then shows them shaved and in modern business suits, while the narrator explains that only a "trained eye" can distinguish their Jewish features.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Where rats appear, they bring ruin by destroying mankind's goods and foodstuffs.  In this way, they spread disease, plague, leprosy, typhoid fever, cholera, dysentery, and so on.  They are cunning, cowardly and cruel and are found mostly in large packs. Among the animals, they represent the rudiment of an insidious, underground destruction – just like the Jews among human beings."&lt;ref name="Smith2011_137"&gt;{{cite book |last=Smith |first=David Livingstone |title=Less than human: why we demean, enslave, and exterminate others |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rWAiRrm3LkcC&amp;pg=PA137 |accessdate=16 November 2011 |date=1 March 2011 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=978-0-312-53272-7 |page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film also claims that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Jewish people] need other people because they need the goods with which to carry on business. The things that are valued by the creative ''Aryan'' peoples have been reduced by the Jew to the level of a mere piece of merchandise, which he buys and sells but cannot produce himself. He leaves production to the labourers and peasants of the people upon whom he has imposed his presence. The Jews are a race without farmers and without manual labourers, a race of parasites.&lt;ref name="I. B. Trauris"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to ''Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany'':
&lt;blockquote&gt;By showing the way in which Jews allegedly insinuate themselves from small-scale to large-scale operations by preying on others, the film returns to its original image of the Jew concealing himself 'behind the mask of the civilised European'. [...] According to the film, the Jew presents an insidious, because concealed, threat, and one that is growing and must be brought under control. The message of this part of the commentary is that Jews will always be Jews, and that the 'civilised European' Jew is only a guise for a new and more dangerous forms of parasitic exploitation.&lt;ref name="I. B. Trauris"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Jews as manipulative===

====Changing outward appearances====
The film also claims that the Jewish people ... 
&lt;blockquote&gt;...change their outward appearances when they leave their Polish nests and go out into the rich world. [...] When he appears without them, then it is only the keen-eyed amongst us who recognise his racial origins. [...] It is true that their fathers and grandfathers still lived in ghettoes, but there is no trace left now in their external appearance. Here in the second and third generation, the Aryanisation has reached its [[zenith]]. [...] And people lacking in [[Intuition (mind)|intuition]] allow themselves to be deceived by this mimicry and regard them as being in truth their equals. Therein lies the dreadful danger, for even these 'civilised' Jews remain foreign bodies in the organism of their hosts, no matter how much their outward appearance may correspond to that of their hosts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taylor|first1=Richard|title=Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany|date=15 October 1998|publisher=I.

{{see also|Economic antisemitism}}

The film claims:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"At the beginning of the twentieth century, Jews sit at the junction of the world financial markets.  They are an international power.  Only one percent of the world's population, with the help of their capital they terrorize the world stock exchanges, world opinion, and world politics."&lt;ref name="Gilreath2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gilreath|first=Shannon |title=The End of Straight Supremacy: Realizing Gay Liberation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A0LaGybtIzwC&amp;pg=PA148|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=31 October 2011|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-18104-4|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The movie blamed Jews for inflation and unemployment in Germany. It charged that they had crept into all professions through [[usury]], racketeering and crimes against German assets.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Out of a thousand workers in Berlin, only two were Jews. For the start of 1933, out of one hundred prosecutors in Berlin 15 were Jews.  Out of a hundred judges were 23 Jews. Out of a hundred lawyers 49 Jews. 52 Jews out of a hundred doctors. And out of every hundred of businessmen 60 Jews. The average wealth of Germans was 810 marks each. The average wealth of each Jew amounted to 10,000 marks."
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The evidence for these assertions is unstated in the film. The occupational information is found in Germany's June 1933 census, which proves the claims made in the movie to be greatly exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Brenner|first1=Michael|title=JEWISH CULTURE IN CONTEMPORARY AMERICA AND WEIMAR GERMANY: PARALLELS AND DIFFERENCES|url=http://web.ceu.hu/jewishstudies/pdf/02_brenner.pdf|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ANTI-JEWISH LEGISLATION IN PREWAR GERMANY|url=http://www.ushmm.org/wlc/en/article.php?ModuleId=10005681|publisher=United States Holocaust Memorial Museum|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hubert Rübsaat 1938"&gt;Margarete Limberg and Hubert Rübsaat, eds., Germans No More: Accounts of Jewish Everyday Life, 1933-1938, trans. Alan Nothnagle (New York: Berghahn Books, 2006), 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1933, 5,600 Jewish doctors and 3,030 Jewish lawyers were practicing in Germany, corresponding to 11 percent of doctors and 16 percent of lawyers.&lt;ref name=academia.edu&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hunt|first1=Sarah|title=Changing Relations between Jews and non-Jews in Interwar Germany|url=https://www.academia.edu/2083415/Changing_Relations_between_Jews_and_non-Jews_in_Interwar_Germany|website=academia.edu|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, an exceptionally large number of successful lawsuits over equal citizenship and rights had been filed in the [[Weimar Republic]], most of them by Jewish lawyers.&lt;ref name="Hubert Rübsaat 1938"/&gt; The Nuremberg Laws specifically forbade German judges from citing any precedents by Jewish jurists and cut off Jewish doctors from reimbursement under public health care insurance.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;

In contrast, during the economic crisis between the end of World War I and the implementation of the Nuremberg Laws, Jews were disproportionately likely to be laid off from the labor market, to the point that 1 out of every 4 Jews had been laid off by 1935.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; The original set of layoffs also had the effect of concentrating Jewish employment during this period into the professional and self-employed sectors, while post-1933 delicensing and other Nuremberg legislation gradually pushed Jews completely out of professional occupations and into positions such as street peddlers.&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt;

The reference to average wealth probably used the wealth of the Jewish [[Rothschild family]] as the basis for its calculation. The Rothschild banking family is still believed to have had the largest private fortune in the world during the 19th century, as well as the largest fortune in [[modern world]] history.&lt;ref name="Rothschild 1999, page 481-85"&gt;''The House of Rothschild: Money's prophets, 1798–1848'', Volume 1, Niall Ferguson, 1999, page 481-85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article56239.ece |title=The Independent, UK: The Rothschild story: A golden era ends for a secretive dynasty |accessdate=2017-04-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060115031554/http://news.independent.co.uk/uk/this_britain/article56239.ece |archivedate=15 January 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jazz Baroness 2009"&gt;''The Secret Life of the Jazz Baroness'', from The Times 11 April 2009, Rosie Boycott&lt;/ref&gt; Although the [[Creditanstalt]] debts were assumed in part by the Austrian branch of the Rothschild family, its bankruptcy was later used by Hitler as an example of how the Jews were responsible for all the economic and social troubles of Germany and the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Trumbore|first1=Brian|title=The Collapse of Creditanstalt Bank in 1931|url=http://www.buyandhold.com/bh/en/education/history/2012/collapse.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318080458/http://www.buyandhold.com/bh/en/education/history/2012/collapse.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=18 March 2014|publisher=Freedom Investments, Inc|accessdate=21 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movie goes on to assert that: "The most common expressions in the jargon of international gangsters and criminals stem from [[Hebrew]] and [[Yiddish]] words." According to the movie, Jews are likewise disproportionately plentiful in organized crime, where they represent 82% of international crime organizations, and 98% of international prostitution. This Jewish influence is seen as well in the international language used by criminals (see also ''[[Rotwelsch]]''). The evidence for these blatant assertions is nowhere produced. Insofar as "organized crime" represents lawbreaking other than that forced by the Nuremberg Laws, it has not been corroborated by subsequent research.

The film also claims that the Jewish people have some kind of "genetic predisposition towards [[barter]] and [[haggling]]", saying that "[Jewish people] rush into trade" because it is fitting "with their character and inclination", and that "For the Jew, there is but one object of value – money. How he earns it is a matter of complete indifference to him." It also accuses Jews of passing corruption on to their children by religious means, saying that:

&lt;blockquote&gt;These children see no ideals before them like our own. The egoism of the individual is not used in the service of higher common goals. On the contrary, Jewish racial morality claims, in contrast to ''Aryan'' morality, that the unrestrained egoism of each Jew is a divine law. His religion makes a duty out of treachery and usury.&lt;ref name="I. B. Trauris"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Richard |first1=Taylor |title=Film Propaganda: Soviet Russia and Nazi Germany |date=15 October 1998 |publisher=I. B.

===Jews as abnormal and depraved===

In a long sequence of images, the film provides examples to illustrate its claims that Aryan/European culture had been corrupted by Jews.&lt;ref name="HaggithNewman2005_90"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haggith|first1=Toby|last2=Newman|first2=Joanna |title=Holocaust and the moving image: representations in film and television since 1933|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hetrpvcBuuEC&amp;pg=PA90|accessdate=16 November 2011|date=1 August 2005|publisher=Wallflower Press|isbn=978-1-904764-51-9|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This sequence includes footage of notable figures who had earned [[Adolf Hitler]]'s wrath, such as physicist and Nobel laureate [[Albert Einstein]] and [[Spartacist uprising]] leader [[Rosa Luxemburg]] (erroneously named as one and the same person as anarchist [[Emma Goldman]]) as representatives of so-called "[[international Jewry]]". Einstein's image was juxtaposed with a series of images about the supposed Jewish control of the pornography industry. Einstein was characterized as "the relativity Jew, who masks his hatred of Germany behind his obscure pseudo-sciences".
Other film clips presented Jewish (or supposedly Jewish) actors from the Weimar era such as [[Curt Bois]], [[Fritz Kortner]], [[Peter Lorre]], and [[Ernst Lubitsch]]. [[Charles Chaplin|Charlie Chaplin]] was also included in this sequence and inaccurately identified as Jewish, possibly as a consequence of his role as the Jewish barber in ''[[The Great Dictator]]''.&lt;ref name="DesserFriedman2004"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Desser|first1=David|last2=Friedman|first2=Lester D. |title=American Jewish Filmmakers|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W4Aqh7u9qCQC&amp;pg=PA9|accessdate=5 July 2012|year=2004|publisher=University of Illinois Press|isbn=978-0-252-07153-9|pages=9–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Jacoby2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacoby|first=Russell |title=Bloodlust: On the Roots of Violence from Cain and Abel to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EA7Va7XHiSEC&amp;pg=PA78|accessdate=5 July 2012|date=5 April 2011|publisher=Simon and Schuster|isbn=978-1-4391-0024-0|page=78}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film includes two scenes from the Hollywood film ''[[The House of Rothschild]]'' (1934). The first clip shows Mayer Rothschild, a rich man, hiding money and putting on old, shabby clothes in order to fool a corrupt tax collector.&lt;ref name="Barnouw1993" /&gt; And the second shows him speaking to his sons, encouraging them to start an international banking business to take advantage of nations' misfortunes in times of war. The clips were used without permission.

The film's narrator asserts that: "the Jew is instinctively interested in everything abnormal and depraved." To illustrate this point, Hippler included a scene from [[Fritz Lang]]'s film ''[[M (1931 film)|M]]'' in which the child murderer Beckert (played by Peter Lorre) makes an impassioned plea to the "jury" of criminals, begging for his life and disclaiming responsibility for his crimes on account of insanity.  Beckert shrieks, "... it burns within me. I must go the way I am driven. Who knows what is going on inside me? How I must - not want, must!"&lt;ref name="Barnouw1993_142"&gt;{{cite book|last=Barnouw|first=Erik |title=Documentary: a history of the non-fiction film|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qtZ91DNvgBMC&amp;pg=PA142|accessdate=15 November 2011|year=1993|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-507898-5|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Sharon Packer, Hitler used this scene to assert that "Jews transmit inheritable criminality and therefore deserve to die."&lt;ref name="Packer2007"&gt;{{cite book|last=Packer|first=Sharon |title=Movies and the modern psyche|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CX4goUP_yh0C&amp;pg=PA89|accessdate=15 November 2011|date=September 2007|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-275-99359-7|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Degenerate art===
The film proceeds to suggest that pictorial art and music have degenerated under Jewish influence, with many spurious examples given. [[Degenerate art]] included works of [[abstract art]] as well as those from specific individuals such as [[George Grosz]] and [[Emil Nolde]], while [[degenerate music]] included [[jazz]] and so-called ''[[Negermusik]]'', although here the connection to Jewry is absent.

===Jewish religious practice===
After showing how Jews have supposedly been responsible for the decline of Western music, science, art, and commerce, the film presents a scene of a cow being slaughtered for meat by a ''[[Shechita|shochet]]'' (Jewish ritual slaughterer). The scene is prefaced by a warning similar to the one in ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', warning the squeamish about what is coming next. This long sequence, lasting several minutes, shows cows and sheep in their death throes as they bleed to death. The producers apparently filmed this scene because of Hitler's opposition to [[cruelty to animals]]. He had banned [[Kosher foods|kosher]] slaughter of animals in Germany and felt that such footage would shock the German public.

This scene was cut from the version intended for young audiences.
&lt;blockquote&gt; "These images are a clear proof of the cruelty of ''Schächtmethode''. They also reveal the character of a race, their blunt brutality hidden under the guise of religious worship. "&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Hitler's Reichstag speech===
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-E11354, Berlin, Reichstagssitzung, Rede Adolf Hitler.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Hitler giving a speech to the Reichstag at the [[Kroll Opera House|''Krolloper'']]]]
The film concludes with footage of Hitler's speech in the [[Reichstag (Nazi Germany)|Reichstag]] in which he proclaims:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"If international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war,  the result will not be Bolshevization of the earth and thus the victory of Jewry, but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe!"
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.holocaust-history.org/der-ewige-jude/ |title=Papers on 'The Eternal Jew' by Stig Hornshoj-Moller |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060702072155/http://www.holocaust-history.org/der-ewige-jude/ |archivedate=2 July 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The film ends with images of SA troops on parade.

==Release and reception==
In and of itself, the movie did not have much impact on the German public.  The film suffered from being released after [[Jud Süß (1940 film)|''Jud Süß'']], which had been wildly popular, perhaps because the antisemitic message was secondary to an engaging period drama.  The actors in ''Jud Süß'' were leading German actors of the time.  In contrast, ''Der ewige Jude''{{'s}} only original footage was of Jews in the Polish ghetto and animated maps.  All the other footage consisted of stills and archive film clips.

Thus, unlike ''[[Jud Süß (1940 film)|Jud Süß]]'', which was a box-office smash success, ''Der ewige Jude'' was a commercial flop.  David Culbert asserts that it is unlikely that there were more than one million paid admissions compared to over 20 million paid admissions to ''Jud Süß''.&lt;ref name="Etlin2002_151"&gt;{{cite book|last=Etlin|first=Richard A. |title=Art, culture, and media under the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQXoZ3oZ3-cC&amp;pg=PA151|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=15 October 2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22087-1|page=151}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was more known by word-of-mouth descriptions than from people actually viewing it.  Some Germans were quoted as saying "We've already seen enough Jewish filth.  We don't need to see any more."&lt;ref name="JowettJowettODonnell2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jowett|first1=Garth S. |last2=Jowett|first2=Garth |last3=O'Donnell|first3=Victoria |title=Propaganda and persuasion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vIC92PdJ0l0C&amp;pg=PA234|accessdate=1 December 2011|year=2006|publisher=SAGE|isbn=978-1-4129-0898-6|page=234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film was chiefly screened by party supporters and Nazi organizations like the [[Hitler Youth]] and the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]. Its themes and content made it a topic of discussion by a wider audience that never saw it. Himmler invited to screen it SS troops headed for the Eastern Front to carry out the "[[Final Solution]]".

==Postwar legacy==
In 1946, Fritz Hippler was tried for directing ''Der ewige Jude'' but was not found guilty.&lt;ref name="Etlin2002_152"&gt;{{cite book|last=Etlin|first=Richard A. |title=Art, culture, and media under the Third Reich|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aQXoZ3oZ3-cC&amp;pg=PA152|accessdate=11 November 2011|date=15 October 2002|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-22087-1|page=152}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hippler contended Joseph Goebbels was the true creator of ''The Eternal Jew'' with Hitler's close supervision. He claimed that Goebbels gave Hippler credit as a reward "for his excellent work in the newsreel department".&lt;ref&gt;Winkel, Roel. Nazi German's Fritz Hippler, 1909- 2002. Historical Journal of Film, Radio and Television. Carfax Publishing. Vol 23, No 2, 2003. 91–99.&lt;/ref&gt;

Franz Hippler was interviewed in the [[Emmy Award]]-winning program "The Propaganda Battle" in the [[PBS]] series ''Walk Through the Twentieth Century'' (1983–1984). In this interview he stated that he regretted being listed as the director of ''The Eternal Jew'' because it resulted in being interrogated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] after the war. He thought this was unfair because, in his opinion, he had nothing to do with the killing of Jews. In an interview shown in the German documentary series ''Holocaust'' (2000), the 90-year-old Hippler described the film as "the most disgraceful example of antisemitism." The film's narrator, [[Harry Giese]], went on to narrate other films, but he was associated with this film and other films by the Third Reich and he found less work in the Postwar German cinema of the 1950s and 60s.

==Availability==

'''''The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack''''', often referred to as simply '''''The Heroin Diaries''''', is the debut [[studio album]] by [[Sixx:A.M.]], a side project of [[Mötley Crüe]] bassist [[Nikki Sixx]]. The band also features lead vocalist [[James Michael]] and guitarist [[DJ Ashba]]. The [[concept album]]&lt;ref name="concept"&gt;{{cite news |title=Nikki Sixx - ARTISTdirect NEWS |url=http://www.artistdirect.com/nad/news/article/0,,4400841,00.html |publisher=[[artistdirect.com]] |date=2007-08-28 |accessdate=2007-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; serves as the companion [[soundtrack]] to Sixx's autobiography, ''[[The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]]'', and is about Sixx's severe [[heroin]] addiction in 1987. The first single, "[[Life Is Beautiful (Sixx:A.M. song)|Life Is Beautiful]]," debuted at #26 on the [[Billboard charts]].&lt;ref name="billboard"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.billboard.com/bbcom/charts/chart_display.jsp?g=Singles&amp;f=Hot+Mainstream+Rock+Tracks|title=Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks|accessdate=2007-10-23 |format= |work=Billboard.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Concept==
Designed to be an accompaniment to ''[[The Heroin Diaries: A Year in the Life of a Shattered Rock Star]]'', the autobiography of [[Mötley Crüe]] bassist [[Nikki Sixx]] co-written by Sixx and Ian Gittens that details his severe heroin addiction in 1987, ''The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack'' is a [[concept album]] that captures Sixx's basic story of his life during that time, although the album can stand alone. The story begins with the reasons for Sixx starting his diary, followed by his first (albeit temporary) abstinence from heroin, his relapse and mental and physical decline, his near-fatal overdose and [[out-of-body experience]], and finally, his emotional recovery, which eventually led to long-term sobriety. The 13 tracks on the album each correspond to one month of his diary, which he kept from December 1986 to December 1987.

''The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack'', noted by many for showcasing a more emotional sound than, and a musical departure from Sixx's other band, [[Mötley Crüe]], has been received very positively. Jim Kaz of [[IGN]], praising the emotional lyrics of the album, called it "not really an album but rather a musical book. It is almost impossible to recommend any specific songs over others."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://music.ign.com/articles/817/817320p1.html |title=Sixx: A.M. - The Heroin Diaries Soundtrack Review |author=Jim Kaz |date=August 31, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110628224150/http://music.ign.com/articles/817/817320p1.html |archivedate=June 28, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:BuscotParkSaloonView.jpg|thumb|right|250px|View of the Saloon at Buscot Park showing two of the major panels – ''The Garden Court'' and ''The Rose Bower'' – in their context between the adjoining panels]]
'''''The Legend of Briar Rose''''' is the title of a series of paintings by the [[Pre-Raphaelite]] artist [[Edward Burne-Jones]] which were completed between 1885 and 1890. The four original paintings – '''''The Briar Wood''''', '''''The Council Chamber''''', '''''The Garden Court''''' and '''''The Rose Bower''''' – and an additional ten adjoining panels, are located at [[Buscot Park]] in [[Oxfordshire]], [[England]].

The four major panels were first exhibited at Agnew's Gallery in [[Bond Street]], [[London]] in 1890. They were acquired by [[Alexander Henderson, 1st Baron Faringdon|Alexander Henderson]], later to become the Lord Faringdon, for Buscot Park. When Burne-Jones visited the house and saw the paintings in their new setting he decided to extend the frames of each of the four paintings and fill in the gaps with joining panels which continued the rose motif from the main paintings.

==Major panels==
Each major panel measures 49 by 98¼ inches but the ten joining panels vary in width. The paintings do not tell a sequential story but record the same moment in each location.

===''The Briar Wood''===
[[Image:Briar Wood Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Briar Wood'',]]
The painting depicts the discovery of the sleeping soldiers by a Knight. In their slumber they have become completed entwined by the barbed thorns of the [[Rosa rubiginosa|Briar rose]].

Running beneath each of the major panels is an inscription of a poem by [[William Morris]], under ''The Briar Wood'' the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The fateful slumber floats and flows&lt;br&gt;
About the tangle of the rose;&lt;br&gt;
But lo! the fated hand and heart&lt;br&gt;
To rend the slumberous curse apart!" &lt;ref name="vic"&gt;[http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/gallery/buscot_park.htm Buscot Park, Faringdon, Oxfordshire. The Home of The Briar Rose. The Most Complete Cycle of Paintings by Edward Burne-Jones] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070504110126/http://www.victorianartinbritain.co.uk/gallery/buscot_park.htm |date=2007-05-04 }} at Victorian Art in Britain.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The Council Chamber''===
[[Image:The Council Chamber Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The Council Chamber'']]
The painting shows the scene in the Council chamber. The members of the council sleep, as does the King who is slumped on his throne. Under the draped curtains and through the window further soldiers can be seen sleeping.

Under ''The Council Chamber'', the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The threat of war, the hope of peace,&lt;br&gt;
The Kingdoms peril and increase&lt;br&gt;
Sleep on, and bide the latter day&lt;br&gt;
When Fate shall take her chain away." &lt;ref name="vic"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The Garden Court''===
[[Image:The Garden Court Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Garden Court'']]
The painting shows the weavers having fallen asleep at their [[loom]]. The walls of the castle form the backdrop to the painting as do arches of roses. 

Under ''The Garden Court'', the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"The maiden pleasance of the land&lt;br&gt;
Knoweth no stir of voice or hand,&lt;br&gt;
No cup the sleeping waters fill,&lt;br&gt;
The restless shuttle lieth still." &lt;ref name="vic"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===''The Rose Bower''===
[[Image:The Rose Bower Buscot Park.jpg|thumb|left|250px|''The Rose Bower'']]
The sleeping beauty lies on her bed surrounded by her slumbering attendants. The rose is seen encircling the drapery in the background

Under ''The Rose Bower'', the inscription reads:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Here lies the hoarded love, the key&lt;br&gt;
To all the treasure that shall be;&lt;br&gt;
Come fated hand the gift to take&lt;br&gt;
And smite this sleeping world awake." &lt;ref name="vic"/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Subject==
The paintings depict a moment in the story of "[[Sleeping Beauty]]", the title of the series coming from the version presented by the [[Brothers Grimm]] in their collection of 1812.&lt;ref&gt;Jacob and Wilheim Grimm, ''Grimms' Fairy Tales'', [http://www.surlalunefairytales.com/sleepingbeauty/stories/littlebriarose.html "Little Briar-Rose"]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related works==
Burne-Jones created two other series of paintings on the same subject.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.buscot-park.com/gallery/pic_035.html Paintings at Buscot page 3]&lt;/ref&gt; 
*The [[Small Briar Rose series|''Small Briar Rose'' series]] was completed before the Buscot Park series. All three paintings –  ''The Briar Wood, The Council Chamber, The Rose Bower'' – are now in the [[Ponce Museum of Art|Museo de Arte de Ponce]], Puerto Rico.
*The [[Third Briar Rose series]] was completed after the Buscot Park series. The three paintings have been split between three collections. ''The Garden Court'' is in [[Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery]], ''The Council Chamber'' is in the [[Delaware Art Museum]], Wilmington and ''The Rose Bower'' is in the [[Hugh Lane Municipal Gallery|Hugh Lane Gallery of Modern Art]], Dublin.

'''''The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul''''' is a 1988 humorous [[fantasy]] [[detective fiction|detective]] novel by [[Douglas Adams]]. It is the second book by Adams featuring [[detective|private detective]] [[Dirk Gently]], the first being ''[[Dirk Gently's Holistic Detective Agency]]''. The title is a phrase that appeared in Adams' novel ''[[Life, the Universe and Everything]]'' to describe the wretched boredom of immortal being [[Wowbagger|Wowbagger, the Infinitely Prolonged]], and is a play on the theological treatise ''[[Dark Night of the Soul]]'', by [[Saint John of the Cross]].

The novel is named for that time on a Sunday, after afternoon but before evening, as the week-end had finished but the week had not yet begun, that occurred to Adams as a listless limbo of the working man:
{{bquote|In the end, it was the Sunday afternoons he couldn't cope with, and that terrible listlessness which starts to set in at about 2:55, when you know that you've had all the baths you can usefully have that day, that however hard you stare at any given paragraph in the papers you will never actually read it, or use the revolutionary new pruning technique it describes, and that as you stare at the clock the hands will move relentlessly on to four o'clock, and you will enter the long dark teatime of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Douglas|last=Adams|title=The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul|date=1988-10-10|publisher=Heinemann|location=UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Plot summary==
Dirk Gently, who calls himself a "[[holism|holistic]] detective", has happened upon what he thinks is a rather comfortable situation. A wealthy man in the [[record industry]] has retained him, spinning a story about being stalked by a seven-foot-tall, green-eyed, [[scythe]]-wielding monster. Dirk pretends to understand the man's ravings involving potatoes and a contract signed in blood coming due; when in reality, Dirk is musing about what he might do if he actually receives payment for his "services" – such as getting rid of his [[refrigerator]], which is so filthy inside that it has become the centrepiece of a show-down between himself and his cleaning woman. The seriousness of his client's claims becomes clear when Dirk arrives several hours late for an appointment to find a swarm of police around his client's estate. The aforementioned client is found in a sealed and heavily barricaded room, his head neatly removed several feet from his body and rotating on a [[Phonograph|turn-table]]. While at his recently deceased client's house, he discovers that his client had a son. However, after Dirk disconnects the television set the boy had been watching, the boy promptly breaks Dirk's nose.

Nearly incapacitated by guilt, Dirk resolves to take his now-late client's wild claims seriously. During his investigation, Gently encounters exploding airport check-in counters, the gods of [[Norse mythology]], insulting [[horoscope]]s, a sinister [[nursing home]], a [[nose|rhino]]-[[Phagy|phagic]] [[eagle]], an [[I Ching]] [[calculator]] (to which everything calculated above the value of 4 is apparently 'a suffusion of yellow'), a god who gives his powers to a lawyer and an advertising executive in exchange for clean [[linen]], and an attractive American woman who gets angry when she can't get [[Pizza delivery|pizza delivered]] in London.

==Adaptations==
A [[BBC]] radio adaptation, [[The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul (radio serial)|''The Long Dark Tea-Time of the Soul'']], starring [[Harry Enfield]], [[Peter Davison]], [[John Fortune]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abovethetitle.com/06_hda/hda_series2.php |title=Above The Title – The Long Dark Tea Time of the Soul |accessdate=23 September 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009080223/http://www.abovethetitle.com/06_hda/hda_series2.php |archivedate=9 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Stephen Moore (actor)|Stephen Moore]] was broadcast on October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/wk40/thu.shtml#radio4|title=BBC – Press Office – Network Radio Programme Information Week 40 Thursday 2 October 2008|accessdate=16 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121112221637/http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/proginfo/radio/wk40/thu.shtml#radio4|archivedate=12 November 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Dirk Gently (TV series)|Dirk Gently]]'' (2010, 2012) starred [[Stephen Mangan]] in the title role in a pilot broadcast on BBC 4 in 2010 and a three episode series broadcast in 2012.

The painting was completed by Maclise in 1854. It was initially commissioned to stand in the chamber of the [[House of Lords]] in the [[Palace of Westminster]], along with other paintings celebrating the acquisition of colonies by the [[British Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.ie/books?id=zJtEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Marriage+of+Strongbow+and+Aoife&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3xsnej5nWAhVKCsAKHUxWAZsQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Marriage+of+Strongbow+and+Aoife&amp;f=false|title=Medieval Invasions in Modern Irish Literature|first=J.|last=Ulin|date=13 November 2013|publisher=Springer|via=Google Books|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170909231045/https://books.google.ie/books?id=zJtEAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9&amp;dq=Marriage+of+Strongbow+and+Aoife&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3xsnej5nWAhVKCsAKHUxWAZsQ6AEIKzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=Marriage+of+Strongbow+and+Aoife&amp;f=false|archivedate=9 September 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genre of '''travel literature''' encompasses [[outdoor literature]], [[guide book]]s, [[nature writing]], and travel [[memoir]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cuddon, J. A. |title=The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory |location=London |publisher=Penguin Books |date=1999 |page=937}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One early travel memoirist in [[Western literature]] was [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], a Greek geographer of the 2nd century AD. In the [[early modern period]], [[James Boswell]]'s ''Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides'' (1786) helped shape travel memoir as a genre.

==History==
[[File:ColombusNotesToMarcoPolo.jpg|thumb|Handwritten notes by [[Christopher Columbus]] on the Latin edition of [[Marco Polo]]'s ''Il Milione'']]
{{further|The Travels of Marco Polo}}
Early examples of travel literature include [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]]' ''Description of Greece'' in the 2nd century CE, the ''[[Itinerarium Cambriae|Journey Through Wales]]'' (1191) and ''[[Descriptio Cambriae|Description of Wales]]'' (1194) by [[Gerald of Wales]], and the travel journals of [[Ibn Jubayr]] (1145&amp;ndash;1214) and [[Ibn Battuta]] (1304&amp;ndash;1377), both of whom recorded their travels across the known world in detail. The travel genre was a fairly common genre in medieval [[Arabic literature]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Travel Genre in Arabic Literature: A Selective Literary and Historical Study|first=Fathi A.|last=El-Shihibi|publisher=Dissertation.com|location=Boca Raton, Fla|year=2006|isbn=1-58112-326-4|type=Originally presented as the author's thesis (Ph.D.--Boston University, 1998)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel literature became popular during the [[Song dynasty]] (960–1279) of medieval China.&lt;ref name="hargett 67"&gt;Hargett 1985, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was called 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue), and was often written in [[narrative]], [[prose]], [[essay]] and [[diary]] style.&lt;ref name="hargett 67 93"&gt;Hargett 1985, pp. 67–93.&lt;/ref&gt; Travel literature authors such as [[Fan Chengda]] (1126–1193) and [[Xu Xiake]] (1587–1641) incorporated a wealth of [[geographical]] and [[topographical]] information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' ''[[Su Shi#Travel record literature|Record of Stone Bell Mountain]]'' by the noted poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] (1037–1101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.&lt;ref name="hargett 74 76"&gt;Hargett 1985, pp. 74–76.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest known records of taking pleasure in travel, of travelling for the sake of travel and writing about it, is [[Francesco Petrarch|Petrarch]]'s (1304&amp;ndash;1374) ascent of [[Mount Ventoux]] in 1336. He states that he went to the mountaintop for the pleasure of seeing the top of the famous height. His companions who stayed at the bottom he called ''frigida incuriositas'' ("a cold lack of curiosity"). He then wrote about his climb, making [[Medieval allegory|allegorical]] comparisons between climbing the mountain and his own moral progress in life.

Michault Taillevent, a poet for the [[Duke of Burgundy]], travelled through the [[Jura Mountains]] in 1430 and recorded his personal reflections, his horrified reaction to the sheer rock faces, and the terrifying thunderous cascades of mountain streams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7yqsIYSNmLMC&amp;pg=PA32 | title=Un poète bourguignon du XVe siècle, Michault Taillevent: édition et étude | publisher=Librairie Droz |author1=Deschaux, Robert |author2=Taillevent, Michault | year=1975 | pages=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Antoine de la Sale]] (c. 1388&amp;ndash;c. 1462), author of ''Petit Jehan de Saintre'', climbed to the crater of a volcano in the [[Lipari Islands]] in 1407, leaving us with his impressions. "Councils of mad youth" were his stated reasons for going. In the mid-15th century, Gilles le Bouvier, in his ''Livre de la description des pays'', gave us his reason to travel and write:
:Because many people of diverse nations and countries delight and take pleasure, as I have done in times past, in seeing the world and things therein, and also because many wish to know without going there, and others wish to see, go, and travel, I have begun this little book.

In 1589, [[Richard Hakluyt]] (c. 1552&amp;ndash;1616) published ''Voyages'', a foundational text of the travel literature genre.

In the 18th Century, travel literature was commonly known as the book of travels, which mainly consisted of maritime [[diary|diaries]].&lt;ref name="stolley 26"&gt;Stolley 1992, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; In 18th century Britain, almost every famous writer worked in the travel literature form.&lt;ref name="fussell 54"&gt;Fussell 1963, p. 54.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Captain James Cook]]'s diaries (1784) were the equivalent of today's best sellers&lt;ref&gt;Glyndwr Williams, ''Captain Cook's Voyages: 1768–1779''. London: The Folio Society, 1997, p. xxxii.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander von Humboldt]]'s ''Personal narrative of travels to the equinoctial regions of America, during the years 1799–1804'', originally published in French, was translated to multiple languages and influenced later naturalists, including [[Charles Darwin]].

Other later examples of travel literature include accounts of the [[Grand Tour]]. Aristocrats, clergy, and others with money and leisure time travelled Europe to learn about the art and architecture of its past. One tourism literature pioneer was [[Robert Louis Stevenson]] (1850&amp;ndash;1894), with ''[[An Inland Voyage]]'' (1878), and  ''[[Travels with a Donkey in the Cévennes]]'' (1879) about his travels in the [[Cévennes]], (France), is among the first popular books to present hiking and camping as recreational activities, and tells of commissioning one of the first [[sleeping bag]]s.&lt;ref&gt;

==Travel books==
{{further|List of travel books}}

Travel books come in styles ranging from the [[documentary]], to the literary, as well as the journalistic, and from the humorous to the serious. They are often associated with [[tourism]] and include [[guide book]]s. Travel writing may be found on web sites, in periodicals, and in books. It has been produced by a variety of writers, including travelers, military officers, missionaries, explorers, scientists, pilgrims, social and physical scientists, educators, and migrants. Englishmen [[Eric Newby]],&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;[[Margalit Fox]], [https://www.nytimes.com/2006/10/24/obituaries/24newby.html "Eric Newby, 86, Acclaimed British Travel Writer, Dies"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 24 october 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;, [[H. V. Morton]], the Americans [[Bill Bryson]] and [[Paul Theroux]], and [[Wales|Welsh]] author [[Jan Morris]] are or were widely acclaimed as travel writers (though Morris has frequently claimed herself as a writer of 'place' rather than travel ''per se'').{{citation needed|date=July 2018}} Bill Bryson in 2011 won the Golden Eagle Award from the Outdoor Writers and Photographers Guild.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.owpg.org.uk/2011/08/bill-bryson-wins-prestigious-golden-eagle-award/&lt;/ref&gt; On 22 November 2012, Durham University officially renamed the [[Durham University Library|Main Library]] the Bill Bryson Library for his contributions as the university's 11th chancellor (2005–11).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Main Library is being renamed 'The Bill Bryson Library'!|date=2012-09-25|work=[[Durham University]]|url=https://www.dur.ac.uk/library/news/?itemno=15355|accessdate=2012-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Bill Bryson Library renaming event, Tuesday 27 November 2012|date=2012-11-22|work=[[Durham University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paul Theroux was awarded the 1981 [[James Tait Black Memorial Prize]] for his novel ''[[The Mosquito Coast]]'', which was adapted for the 1986 movie of the same name. He was also awarded in 1989 the [[Thomas Cook Travel Book Award]]  for ''Riding the Iron Rooster''. In 2005, Jan Morris was awarded the [[Golden PEN Award]] by [[English PEN]] for "a Lifetime's Distinguished Service to Literature".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.englishpen.org/prizes/golden-pen-award-for-a-lifetimes-distinguished-service-to-literature |title=Golden Pen Award, official website |publisher=[[English PEN]] |date= |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Traveling Genius: The Writing Life of Jan Morris |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=wHMEVRxWx6UC&amp;pg=PR20 |author=Gillian Fenwick |publisher=Univ of South Carolina Press |chapter=Chronology |page=XX |year=2008 |accessdate=3 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Travel literature often intersects with [[essay]] writing, as in [[V. S. Naipaul]]'s ''[[India: A Wounded Civilization]]'' (1976), whose trip became the occasion for extended observations on a nation and people. This is similarly the case in [[Rebecca West]]'s work on Yugoslavia, ''[[Black Lamb and Grey Falcon]]'' (1941).&lt;ref&gt;West, Rebecca, intr. Geoff Dyer, (2006). ''Black Lamb and Grey Falcon: A Journey Through Yugoslavia''. Edinburgh.&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes a writer will settle into a locality for an extended period, absorbing a sense of place while continuing to observe with a travel writer's sensibility. Examples of such writings include [[Lawrence Durrell]]'s ''[[Bitter Lemons]]'' (1957), [[Deborah Tall]]'s ''The Island of the White Cow: Memories of an Irish Island'' (1986),&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Gross, "'White Cow` Absorbing Account Of Irish Island The Island Of The White Cow: Memories Of An Irish Island. By Deborah Tall". March 2, 1986, ''News/Sun-Sentinel''.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Peter Mayle]]'s best-selling ''[[A Year in Provence]]'' (1989) and its sequels.

Travel and nature writing merge in many of the works by [[Sally Carrighar]], [[Gerald Durrell]] and [[Ivan T. Sanderson]]. Sally Carrighar's works include ''One Day at Teton Marsh'' (1965), ''Home to the Wilderness'' (1973), and ''Wild Heritage'' (1965). [[Gerald Durrell]]'s ''[[My Family and Other Animals]]'' (1956) is an autobiographical work by the British naturalist. It tells of the years that he lived as a child with his siblings and widowed mother on the Greek island of [[Corfu]] between 1935 and 1939. It describes the life of the Durrell family in a humorous manner, and explores the fauna of the island. It is the first and most well-known of Durrell's "Corfu trilogy", together with ''[[Birds, Beasts, and Relatives]]'' and ''[[The Garden of the Gods]]'' (1978). [[Ivan T. Sanderson]] published ''Animal Treasure'', a report of an expedition to the jungles of then-British West Africa; ''Caribbean Treasure'', an account of an expedition to [[Trinidad]], [[Haiti]], and [[Surinam]], begun in late 1936 and ending in late 1938; and ''Living Treasure'', an account of an expedition to [[Jamaica]], British Honduras (now [[Belize]]) and the [[Yucatán]]. These authors are [[natural history|naturalists]], who write in support of their fields of study. Another naturalist, [[Charles Darwin]], wrote his famous account of the journey of [[The Voyage of the Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']] at the intersection of science, natural history and travel.&lt;ref&gt;"Review of Narrative of the Surveying Voyages of H.M.S. Adventure and Beagle between the Years 1826 and 1836 ... &amp; Journal of Researches into the Geology and Natural History of the various Countries visited by H.M.S. Beagle ...". ''The Quarterly Review''. 65: 194–234. December 1839.&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of writers famous in other fields have written about their travel experiences. Examples are [[Samuel Johnson]]'s ''A Journey to the Western Islands of Scotland'' (1775); [[Charles Dickens]]' ''American Notes for General Circulation'' (1842); [[Mary Wollstonecraft]]'s ''Letters Written during a Short Residence in Sweden, Norway, and Denmark'' (1796); [[Hilaire Belloc]]'s ''The Path To Rome'' (1902); [[D. H. Lawrence]]'s ''Twilight in Italy and Other Essays'' (1916); ''Mornings in Mexico and Other Essays'' (1927); [[Rebecca West]]'s ''[[Black Lamb and Grey Falcon]]'' (1941); and [[John Steinbeck]]'s ''[[Travels with Charley: In Search of America]]'' (1962).&lt;ref&gt;[http://reason.com/archives/2011/04/04/sorry-charley "Sorry, Charley"], Bill Steigerwald, ''Reason'', April 2011 [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/04/04/books/steinbecks-travels-with-charley-gets-a-fact-checking.html "A Reality Check for Steinbeck and Charley"], Charles McGrath, ''New York Times'', April 3, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adventure literature==
In the world of sailing [[Joshua Slocum]]'s ''[[Sailing Alone Around the World]]'' (1900) is a classic of outdoor adventure literature.&lt;ref&gt;Joshua Slocum Society: [http://www.joshuaslocumsocietyintl.org].&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1895, [[Joshua Slocum]] set sail from [[Boston, Massachusetts]] and in  ''Sailing Alone Around the World'',&lt;ref name=SailingAlone&gt;Slocum (1899), ''Sailing Alone Around the World''&lt;/ref&gt; he described his departure in the following manner:

:I had resolved on a voyage around the world, and as the wind on the morning of April 24, 1895 was fair, at noon I weighed anchor, set sail, and filled away from Boston, where the ''Spray'' had been moored snugly all winter. ... A thrilling pulse beat high in me. My step was light on deck in the crisp air. I felt there could be no turning back, and that I was engaging in an adventure the meaning of which I thoroughly understood.

More than three years later, on June 27, 1898, Slocum returned to [[Newport, Rhode Island]], having [[circumnavigation|circumnavigated]] the world.

==Guide books==
{{main|Guide book}}
[[Image:Claife Station.jpg|right|thumb|Claife Station, built at one of [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]]'s 'viewing stations', to allow visiting tourists and artists to better appreciate the [[picturesque]] English [[Lake District]].]]
A '''guide book''' or '''travel guide''' is "a book of information about a place, designed for the use of visitors or tourists".&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; An early example is [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]]'s guide to the [[Lake District]], published in 1778.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas West, (1821) [1778]. ''A Guide to the Lakes in Cumberland, Westmorland, and Lancashire''. Kendal: W. Pennington.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas West (priest)|Thomas West]], an English [[priest]], popularized the idea of walking for pleasure in his guide to the [[Lake District]] of 1778. In the introduction he wrote that he aimed: &lt;blockquote&gt;to encourage the taste of visiting the lakes by furnishing the traveller with a Guide; and for that purpose, the writer has here collected and laid before him, all the select stations and points of view, noticed by those authors who have last made the tour of the lakes, verified by his own repeated observations.&lt;ref name=West2&gt;{{cite book |last=West |title=A Guide to the Lakes |page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt; To this end he included various 'stations' or viewpoints around the lakes, from which tourists would be encouraged to appreciate the views in terms of their aesthetic qualities.&lt;ref name=development&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |title=Development of tourism in the Lake District National Park |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Lake District UK |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011064752/http://www.lakedistrict.uk7.net/tourist_development.html |archivedate=October 11, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Published in 1778 the book was a major success.&lt;ref name=NPA&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |title=Understanding the National Park &amp;mdash; Viewing Stations |accessdate=2008-11-27 |publisher=Lake District National Park Authority |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104212541/http://www.lakedistrict.gov.uk/learning/lakedistrictfacts/archaeologyhistory/archaeologydiscoveryzone/archaeologyindepth/archaeologyviewing-stations-2 |archivedate=2014-01-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
It will usually include full details relating to accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities. Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are also often included. Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from [[adventure travel]] to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet. Travel guides can also take the form of [[travel website]]s.

==Travel journals==
[[File:Goethe's Italian Journey.png|thumb|upright|Goethe's Italian Journey between September 1786 and May 1788]]
A travel journal, also called road journal, is a record made by a traveller, sometimes in diary form, of the traveler's experiences, written during the course of the journey and later edited for publication. This is a long-established literary format; an early example is the writing of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] (2nd century AD) who produced his ''Description of Greece'' based on his own observations. [[James Boswell]] published his ''[[The Journal of a Tour to the Hebrides]]'' in 1786 and [[Goethe]] published his ''[[Italian Journey]]'', based on diaries, in 1816. [[Frances Erskine Inglis, 1st Marquise of Calderón de la Barca|Fannie Calderón de la Barca]], the Scottish-born wife of the Spanish ambassador to Mexico 1839–1842, wrote ''[[Life in Mexico]]'', an important travel narrative of her time there, with many observations of local life. A British traveller, [[Mrs Alec Tweedie]], published a number of travelogues, ranging from Denmark (1895) and Finland (1897), to the U.S. (1913), several on Mexico (1901, 1906, 1917), and one on Russia, Siberia, and China (1926). A more recent example is [[Che Guevara]]'s ''[[The Motorcycle Diaries (book)|The Motorcycle Diaries]]''. A travelogue is a [[Travelogue (films)|film]], book written up from a travel diary, or illustrated talk describing the experiences of and places visited by traveller.&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''.&lt;/ref&gt; American writer [[Paul Theroux]] has published many works of travel literature, the first success being ''[[The Great Railway Bazaar]]''.  Anglo-American [[Bill Bryson]] is known for ''[[A Walk in the Woods (book)|A Walk in the Woods]]'', made into a Hollywood [[A Walk in the Woods (film)|film of the same name]].&lt;ref name="variety.com"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNary|first1=Dave|title=‘99 Homes,’ ‘A Walk in the Woods’ Set for September Releases|url=https://variety.com/2015/film/news/99-homes-a-walk-in-the-woods-release-date-broad-green-1201468864/|accessdate=April 9, 2015|work=variety.com|date=April 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fiction==
Some fictional travel stories are related to travel literature. Although it may be desirable in some contexts to distinguish [[fiction]]al from [[non-fiction]]al works, such distinctions have proved notoriously difficult to make in practice, as in the famous instance of the travel writings of [[Marco Polo]] or [[John Mandeville]]. Examples of fictional works of travel literature based on actual journeys are: 
* [[Joseph Conrad]]'s ''[[Heart of Darkness]]'' (1899), which has its origin in an actual voyage Conrad made up the [[River Congo]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Conrad, Joseph &amp; Zdzisław Najder (Editor)|title=The Congo Diary and Other Uncollected Pieces| date= 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Jack Kerouac]]'s ''[[On the Road]]'' (1957) and ''[[The Dharma Bums]]'' (1958) are fictionalized accounts of his travels across the United States during the late 1940s and early 1950s
*Travel writer [[Kira Salak]]'s novel, ''[[The White Mary]]'' (2008), a contemporary example of a real life journey transformed into a work of fiction, which takes place in [[Papua New Guinea]] and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo|Congo]].&lt;ref name=NatGeoWhiteMary&gt;{{cite web|last=Finkel[[Michael Finkel|Finkel]]|first= Michael|title=Kira Salek: The White Mary|url=http://adventure.nationalgeographic.com/2008/08/kira-salak/michael-finkel-text|work=National Geographic Adventure|accessdate=12 November 2010|date=August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WallStreetWhiteMary&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB121702303930685891?mod=2_1167_1 |title=Imaginary Journey |work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Jeffrey A. | last=Trachtenberg | date=26 July 2008|accessdate=12 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=amazon_entryWhiteMary&gt;{{cite web |title=The White Mary: A Novel|work=Amazon.com|isbn=0805088474}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel blogs==
In the 21st century, travel literature became a genre of [[social media]] in the form of travel blogs, with travel bloggers using outlets like personal [[blog]]s, [[Pinterest]], [[Twitter]], [[Facebook]] and [[Instagram]] to convey information about their adventures, and provide advice for navigating particular countries, or for traveling generally.&lt;ref name="TJEPIC"&gt;F. Hanusch, E. Fürsich, ''Travel Journalism: Exploring Production, Impact and Culture'' (2014), p. 100-101.&lt;/ref&gt; Travel blogs were among the first instances of blogging, which began in the mid 1990s.&lt;ref name="TJEPIC"/&gt;. In 2018 the most popular self hosted blogging platform is [[WordPress]], due to its ease of use&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wpbeginner.com/beginners-guide/how-to-choose-the-best-blogging-platform/|title=How to Choose the Best Blogging Platform in 2018 (Compared)|date=2016-11-10|work=WPBeginner|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Scholarship==

&lt;!--this whole section smells of [[WP:OR]] and [[WP:POV]]; needs either rewrite or thorough citations--&gt;
The systematic study of travel literature emerged as a field of scholarly inquiry in the mid-1990s, with its own conferences, organizations, journals, monographs, anthologies, and encyclopedias.  Important, pre-1995 monographs are: ''Abroad'' (1980) by [[Paul Fussell]], an [[exploration]] of British interwar travel writing as escapism; ''Gone Primitive: Modern Intellects, Savage Minds'' (1990) by Marianna Torgovnick, an inquiry into the [[primitivism|primitivist]] presentations of foreign cultures; ''Haunted Journeys: Desire and Transgression in European Travel Writing'' (1991) by Dennis Porter, a close look at the psychological correlatives of travel; ''Discourses of Difference: An Analysis of Women's Travel Writing'' by Sara Mills, an inquiry into the intersection of gender and [[colonialism]] during the 19th century; ''Imperial Eyes: Travel Writing and Transculturation'' (1992), [[Mary Louise Pratt]]'s influential study of [[Victorian era|Victorian]] travel writing's dissemination of a colonial mind-set; and ''Belated Travelers'' (1994), an analysis of colonial anxiety by Ali Behdad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29468460|title=Belated travelers : orientalism in the age of colonial dissolution|last=Behdad|first=Ali|date=1994|publisher=Duke University Press|year=|isbn=0822314711|location=Durham, North Carolina|pages=|oclc=29468460}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

Disrupting the assumptions of traditional travel writing, Amitav Ghosh's ''In an Antique Land'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/29428387|title=In an antique land|last=Ghosh|first=Amitav|date=1994|publisher=|year=|isbn=0679727833|edition=|location=New York|pages=|oclc=29428387}}&lt;/ref&gt; may be regarded as an example of "counter travel narrative", reversing the "roles of traveller and local, viewing the present as contextualized by the colonial and precolonial past, and eschewing definitive authorial authority [in] a powerful rebuttal to the ideology of the traditional travel text."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McParland|first=Liam|date=2017|title=Egypt, India, ideology: In an antique land as a rebuttal to the traditional travel text|url=http://hdl.handle.net/10613/5430|journal=|language=en|volume=|pages=|via=VIUSpace}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Travel awards==

Prizes awarded annually for travel books have included the [[Thomas Cook Travel Book Award]], which ran from 1980 to 2004, the  [[Boardman Tasker Prize for Mountain Literature]], and the [[Dolman Best Travel Book Award]], which began in 2006. The [[North American Travel Journalists Association]] holds an annual awards competition honoring travel journalism in a multitude of categories, ranging across print and online media.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://natja.memberclicks.net/competition-guidelines|title=Competition Rules and Guidelines|last=Leon|first=Yanira|website=natja.memberclicks.net|language=en-us|access-date=2017-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
