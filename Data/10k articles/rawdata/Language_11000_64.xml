An '''agreed statement''', in [[US law]], is an agreement between two parties to a [[lawsuit]] or an [[appeal]] of a judgment. The agreements are limited to cases of the dispute being a question of legal interpretation rather than a dispute concerning the facts of a case.

'''Albertha Magdalena Bouwer''' (16 March 1920 – 5 October 2010) was a South African [[Afrikaans]]-writing journalist and author. She is best known for her series of children's stories about the experiences of a small girl called Alie growing up in the fictional location Rivierplaas in rural [[Free State (South African province)|Free State]].&lt;ref&gt;Elwyn Jenkins, "The Growth of a National Children's Literature in English", ''English Academy Review'' 18:1 (2001), p. 148.&lt;/ref&gt; Late in life she published a novel for adults, ''Die afdraand van die dag is kil'' (The close of the day is cold, 1992), about two women in old age.&lt;ref&gt;Reviewed by Fred J. Nichols in ''World Literature Today'' 68:1 (1994), p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==
Alba Bouwer was herself brought up on a farm in the Free State, and attended [[La Rochelle Girls' High School]] in [[Paarl]], and [[Huguenot University College]] in [[Wellington, Western Cape|Wellington]]. Most of her professional life was spent in literary and media circles in and around [[Cape Town]].

Immediately after graduation Bouwer began work as a school teacher, but she left teaching to become editor of ''Huishouding'', a newly established women's magazine. From 1948 to 1950 she was a radio producer and presenter in the children's service of the [[South African Broadcasting Corporation]], resigning in 1950 to take up an assistant editorship at the newly founded women's magazine ''[[Sarie]]'', where she remained for thirteen years.

Her first and best known work of fiction, ''Stories van Rivierplaas'', originally appeared in serialised form in ''Sarie''. Like many of her stories, these were semi-autobiographical. She continued to produce stories, translations and compilations into the late 1980s, but gave up her career in journalism upon marriage in 1963.

Bouwer's first husband was Hubert Coetzee (died 1969), a widower with two teenaged children from his previous marriage. Care for her stepchildren became Bouwer's first priority as wife and as widow. In 1975 she remarried with Jan Hendrik Hofmeyr, a widower with five children from his previous marriage, and moved from the [[Cape Winelands|Boland]] to [[Riversdale, Western Cape|Riversdale]].

Since 1994 she lived in a retirement resort in [[Somerset West]].&lt;ref&gt;Biographical details from ''Die blink uur van mooi dinge'', pp. 6–74.&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 October 2010 Alba Bouwer fell into a coma and died.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beeld.com/Suid-Afrika/Nuus/Skrywer-Bouwer-sterf-na-koma-20101007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards and honours==
Alba Bouwer was awarded the Scheepers Prize for Children's Literature in 1959 and again in 1965, and the C.P. Hoogenhout Award in 1961, 1971 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.childlit.org.za/outabouwer.html Details on awards to Alba Bouwer] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512183538/http://www.childlit.org.za/outabouwer.html |date=12 May 2008 }} at childlit.org.za (in Afrikaans). Accessed 26 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1989 the South African Academy of Science and Arts has presented a triennial [[Alba Bouwer Prize]] for children's literature, named in her honour. The prize has been awarded to the following recipients: Freda Linde (1989), Marietjie de Jongh and Barrie Hough (1992), Corlia Fourie (1995), Philip de Vos (1998), Martie Preller (2001), Leon de Villiers (2003), Jaco Jacobs (2006).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.storiewerf.co.za/lyste/albabouwerprys.htm List of recipients of the Alba Bouwer Prize] at storiewerf.co.za (in Afrikaans).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9340">In [[logic]], an '''atomic sentence''' is a type of declarative [[Sentence (mathematical logic)|sentence]] which is either true or false (may also be referred to as a [[proposition]], [[statement (logic)|statement]] or [[truthbearer]]) and which cannot be broken down into other simpler sentences. For example, "The dog ran" is an atomic sentence in natural language, whereas "The dog ran and the cat hid." is a '''molecular sentence''' in natural language.

From a logical analysis, the truth or falsity of sentences in general is determined by only two things: the [[logical form]] of the sentence and the truth or falsity of its simple sentences. This is to say, for example, that the truth of the sentence "John is Greek and John is happy" is a function of the meaning of "[[logical conjunction|and]]", and the [[truth value]]s of the atomic sentences "John is Greek" and "John is happy". However, the truth or falsity of an atomic sentence is not a matter that is within the scope of logic itself, but rather whatever art or science the content of the atomic sentence happens to be talking about.&lt;ref&gt;''Philosophy of Logic'', [[Willard Van Orman Quine]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Logic has developed artificial languages, for example [[Propositional calculus|sentential calculus]] and [[predicate calculus]] partly with the purpose of revealing the underlying logic of natural languages statements, the surface grammar of which may conceal the underlying logical structure; see [[Analytic Philosophy]]. In these artificial languages an Atomic Sentence is a string of symbols which can represent an elementary sentence in a natural language, and it can be defined as follows.

In a formal language, a [[well-formed formula]] (or wff) is a string of symbols constituted in accordance with the rules of syntax of the language. A [[term (logic)|term]] is a [[variable (mathematics)|variable]], an individual [[constant (mathematics)|constant]] or a n-place [[function letter]] followed by n terms. An [[atomic formula]] is a wff consisting of either a sentential letter or an n-place [[predicate (logic)|predicate]] letter followed by n terms. A sentence is a wff in which any variables are bound. An '''atomic sentence''' is an atomic formula containing no variables. It follows that an atomic sentence contains no [[logical connective]]s, variables or [[quantifier (logic)|quantifier]]s. A sentence consisting of one or more sentences and a logical connective is a compound (or molecular) sentence.  See ''vocabulary'' in [[First-order logic]]

== Examples ==
=== Assumptions ===
In the following examples:
 * let ''F'', ''G'', ''H'' be predicate letters; 
 * let ''a'', ''b'', ''c'' be individual constants; 
 * let ''x'', ''y'', ''z'' be variables.

=== Atomic sentences ===
These wffs are atomic sentences; they contain no variables or conjunctions:&lt;big&gt;
* ''F''(''a'')
* ''H''(''b'', ''a'', ''c'')
&lt;/big&gt;

=== Atomic formulae ===
These wffs are atomic formulae, but are not sentences (atomic or otherwise) because they include free variables:&lt;big&gt;
* ''F''(''x'')
* ''G''(''a'', ''z'')
* ''H''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')
&lt;/big&gt;

=== Compound sentences ===
These wffs are compound sentences.  They are sentences, but are not atomic sentences because they are not atomic formulae:&lt;big&gt;
* '''∀'''''x'' (''F''(''x''))
* '''∃'''''z'' (''G''(''a'', ''z''))
* '''∃'''''x'' '''∀'''''y'' '''∃'''''z'' (''H''(''x'', ''y'', ''x''))
* '''∀'''''x'' '''∃'''''z'' (''F''(''x'') ∧ ''G''(''a'', ''z''))
* '''∃'''''x'' '''∀'''''y''' ''∃'''''z'' (''G''(''a'', ''z'') ∨ ''H''(''x'', ''y'', ''z''))
&lt;/big&gt;

=== Compound formulae ===
These wffs are compound formulae.  They are not atomic formulae but are built up from atomic formulae using logical connectives. They are also not sentences because they contain free variables:&lt;big&gt;
* ''F''(''x'') ∧ ''G''(''a'', ''z'')
* ''G''(''a'', ''z'') ∨ ''H''(''x'', ''y'', ''z'')
&lt;/big&gt;

==Interpretations==
{{main|Interpretation (logic)}}

A sentence is either '''true''' or '''false''' under an '''interpretation''' which assigns values to the logical variables. We might for example make the following assignments:

'''Individual Constants'''
* a: Socrates
* b: Plato
* c: Aristotle
'''Predicates''':
* Fα:  α is sleeping
* Gαβ:  α hates β
* Hαβγ: α made β hit γ

'''Sentential variables:'''
* ''p'':  It is raining.

Under this interpretation the sentences discussed above would represent the following English statements:
* &lt;big&gt;''p''&lt;/big&gt;: "It is raining."
* &lt;big&gt;''F''(''a'')&lt;/big&gt;: "Socrates is sleeping."
* &lt;big&gt;''H''(''b'', ''a'', ''c'')&lt;/big&gt;:  "Plato made Socrates hit Aristotle."
* &lt;big&gt;'''∀'''''x'' (''F''(''x''))&lt;/big&gt;: "Everybody is sleeping."
* &lt;big&gt;'''∃'''''z'' (''G''(''a'', ''z''))&lt;/big&gt;:  "Socrates hates somebody."
* &lt;big&gt;'''∃'''''x'' '''∀'''''y'' '''∃'''''z'' (''H''(''x'', ''y'', ''z''))&lt;/big&gt;:  "Somebody made everybody hit somebody."  (They may not have all hit the same person z, but they all did so ''because'' of the same person x.)
* &lt;big&gt;'''∀'''''x'' '''∃'''''z'' (''F''(''x'') ∧ ''G''(''a'', ''z''))&lt;/big&gt;: "Everybody is sleeping and Socrates hates somebody."
* &lt;big&gt;'''∃'''''x'' '''∀'''''y'' '''∃'''''z'' (''G''(''a'', ''z'') ∨ ''H''(''x'', ''y'', ''z''))&lt;/big&gt;: "Either Socrates hates somebody or somebody made everybody hit somebody."

==Translating sentences from a natural language into an artificial language==
Sentences in natural languages can be ambiguous, whereas the languages of the sentential logic and [[predicate logic]]s are precise. Translation can reveal such ambiguities and express precisely the intended meaning.

For example, take the English sentence “Father Ted married Jack and Jill”. Does this mean Jack married Jill? In translating we might make the following assignments:
'''Individual Constants'''
* ''a'': Father Ted
* ''b'': Jack
* ''c'': Jill
'''Predicates''':
* ''M''αβγ: α officiated at the marriage of β to γ
Using these assignments the sentence above could be translated as follows:
* ''M''(''a'', ''b'', ''c''): Father Ted officiated at the marriage of Jack and Jill.
* '''∃'''''x'' '''∃'''''y'' (''M''(''a'', ''b'', ''x'') ∧ ''M''(''a'', ''c'', ''y'')): Father Ted officiated at the marriage of Jack to somebody and Father Ted officiated at the marriage of Jill to somebody.
* '''∃'''''x'' '''∃'''''y'' (''M''(''x'', ''a'', ''b'') ∧ ''M''(''y'', ''a'', ''c'')): Somebody officiated at the marriage of Father Ted to Jack and somebody officiated at the marriage of Father Ted to Jill.
To establish which is the correct translation of “Father Ted married Jack and Jill”, it would be necessary to ask the speaker exactly what was meant.

==Philosophical significance==
Atomic sentences are of particular interest in [[philosophical logic]] and the theory of [[truth]] and, it has been argued, there are corresponding '''atomic facts'''.  An Atomic sentence (or possibly the ''meaning'' of an atomic sentence) is called an '''elementary proposition''' by Wittgenstein and an '''atomic proposition''' by Russell:
* ''4.2 The sense of a proposition is its agreement and disagreement with possibilities of existence and non-existence of states of affairs. 4.21 The simplest kind of proposition, an elementary proposition, asserts the existence of a state of affairs.'': Wittgenstein, [[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]], [[s:Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]].
* ''A proposition (true or false) asserting an atomic fact is called an atomic proposition.'': Russell, Introduction to Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus, [[s:Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus/Introduction]]
* see also&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/logical-atomism/&lt;/ref&gt; and&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein-atomism/&lt;/ref&gt; especially regarding ''elementary proposition'' and ''atomic proposition'' as discussed by Russell and Wittgenstein

Note the distinction between an ''elementary/atomic proposition'' and ''an atomic fact''

No atomic sentence can be deduced from (is not entailed by) any other atomic sentence, no two atomic sentences are incompatible, and no sets of atomic sentences are self-contradictory. Wittgenstein made much of this in his Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus. If there are any atomic sentences then there must be "atomic facts" which correspond to those that are true, and the conjunction of all true atomic sentences would say all that was the case, i.e.  "the world" since, according to Wittegenstein,  "The world is all that is the case". (TLP:1).  Similarly the set of all sets of atomic sentences corresponds to the set of all possible worlds (all that could be the case).

The [[T-schema]], which embodies the theory of truth proposed by [[Alfred Tarski]], defines the truth of arbitrary sentences from the truth of atomic sentences.

'''Beauty Beggar''' (Chinese:美容丐幫, mei5 jung4 koi3 bong1) is a derogatory name for beauty bloggers or [[beauty YouTubers]] who capitalize their fame to promote cosmetics so as to obtain sponsorship, in forms of testers or money, from cosmetics companies. It is a Hong Kong [[internet slang]] that originated from the discussion on [[Instagram]] and [[Hong Kong Golden Forum|The Golden Forum]] (Chinese:香港高登討論區)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the case of beauty beggars: the transformation of advertisement, web celebrities and YouTube|url=http://www.vjmedia.com.hk/articles/2014/08/08/81117|website=VJMEDIA}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:News report on beauty beggars.jpg|thumb|news report on beauty beggars]]

==Definition==

Involved cybercitizens claim that beauty beggars have these following characteristics: some of the introductions are self-contradictory or of poor quality; the declaration of interest is lacking in the presentations; they overcharge sponsorship either from public relations agencies or cosmetics companies; etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cybercitizens reported beauty beggars|url=http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/NewsDetail/Index/448648|website=Hong Kong Daily News|access-date=2015-03-18|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095021/http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/NewsDetail/index/448648|archive-date=2015-04-02|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tsui Yuen (Chinese:徐緣), a Hong Kong columnist who specialises in marketing, pointed out that the nature of a beauty beggar is the abuse of the "[[Word of Mouth]]" marketing model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Money compromises bloggers' credibility|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/financeestate/art/20140807/18824192|website=AppleDaily.hk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Janice Wong, a Hong Kong fashion critic, holds the opinion that the prototype of beauty beggar is the advertorial on "personal media"(Chinese:自媒體) platform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Self-absorbed personal media|url=http://mpdeluxe.mingpao.com/cfm/experts3.cfm?nodeid=1407381044890|website=Ming Pao}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, after some cybercitizens reported beauty beggars to the [[Customs and Excise Department (Hong Kong)|Customs and Excise Department]] in Hong Kong, the spokesman of Hong Kong Customs announced that they would follow up the case, for the beauty beggars might have violated section 13E of the Trade Descriptions Ordinance, which covers "misleading omissions". The official indicated that different cases vary so more investigation and evidence is required to make fair judgements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty bloggers are reported on|url=http://www.e123.hk/ElderlyPro/details/342903/71/|website=eElderly Hong Kong}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin==
Beauty beggars originated from some local beauty bloggers in Hong Kong, who are keen on sharing their experiences of using some beauty products with other cybercitizens. With their followers accumulating, some beauty bloggers that are more popular may be invited by some public relations agencies or cosmetics companies to promote beauty products. Thus, even if the product is not effective, these beauty bloggers may still give positive reviews on it. Some beauty bloggers were found to disguise the products that they get from public relations agencies as self-purchased products so as to raise the credibility of the promoting products. Moreover, some famous bloggers might sell the samples that they obtained from public relations agencies to viewers so as to earn extra profits. Customers who bought those products then discovered that they did not work or might cause allergic problems. Also, some beauty bloggers price their blog, Facebook page, or YouTube video to ask for extra sponsorship from involved companies. Therefore, some cybercitizens criticize them as “beauty beggars”.[[#cite_note-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Development==

Due to the increasing trend of using social networking sites like [[YouTube]] and web blogs, people love to share their experience of using various products or collect useful information for daily life uses. In addition to the increasing popularity of social network, the continuous inflow of cosmetics and skin care products,especially from Korea and Taiwan, has raise the needs of beauty information for potential customers. Customers believe that they can rely on beauty bloggers' experience to choose the beauty products that suit them most. This in turn created a need for beauty bloggers. Beauty bloggers use either videos or texts to comment on different brands of beauty products after use. Thus, their audience can use their reviews or self-used reports as references before purchasing those beauty products.
Some public relation agencies invited them to recommend some products by giving them some testers, but the article they wrote are similar to advertisements, since they simply give positive comments on those products.[[#cite_note-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ming Pao: Beauty beggars are suspected to be sponsored|url=http://hk.on.cc/hk/bkn/cnt/news/20140705/bkn-20140705130535141-0705_00822_001.html|website=on.cc}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As YouTube becomes more popular, the sharing form transfers from writing articles to making videos, so many beauty bloggers became beauty YouTubers, who are likely to be paid according to the number of likes for their YouTube clips. It was reported that some of the popular beauty YouTubers even ask for 40,000 to 50,000 Hong Kong Dollar for each YouTube clip.[[#cite_note-6|&lt;sup&gt;[6]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

==Objections==

Some cybercitizens created Facebook pages and BBS website to show their objections to beauty beggars. In order to gather related information and propaganda, cybercitizens also established their fan club on YouTube platform and set up their database in Google Document and Instagram. In 2014, after some cybercitizens posted on the Golden Forum claiming that they obtained evidences of beauty beggars' behind-the-scenes deals, some beauty bloggers were caught up in some [[Human flesh search engine|human flesh search]] (Chinese: 人肉搜索; 起底) cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Beauty beggars faces human flesh searching|url=http://www.hkdailynews.com.hk/NewsDetail/index/448649|website=Hong Kong Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
===Criticisms===
Many Hong Kong cybercitizens showed their opposition to the beauty beggars, and some of them listed several reasons for opposing them. A famous blogger summarized these reasons why people are against beauty beggars according to their voices:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why people are against beauty beggars?|url=http://www.beautyexchange.com.hk/forum.php?mod=viewthread&amp;tid=580181|website=BeautyExchange}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Misusing the YouTube platform.  
* Posting advertisements instead of useful information.  
* Poor quality of posts.
* Concealing drawbacks of their products and exaggerating the effects of products.

The '''Caddoan languages''' are a [[language family|family]] of languages native to the [[Great Plains]]. They were spoken by tribal groups of the central [[United States]], from present-day [[North Dakota]] south to [[Oklahoma]]. In the 21st century, they are critically endangered, as the number of native speakers has declined markedly. 

==Family division==
Five languages belong to the Caddoan language family:

{{Clade

|label2=Northern Caddoan
|2={{clade

         |2=[[Arikara language|Arikara]]
            }}
         }}
      }}
   }}
}}

Kitsai and Wichita are both extinct. Kitsai went extinct in the 19th century as its members were absorbed into the [[Wichita tribe]]. Wichita went extinct in 2016 when the last native speaker of [[Wichita language|Wichita]], [[Doris McLemore]] (who left recordings and language materials), died.

All of the other Caddoan languages are nearly extinct; as of 2007, [[Caddo language|Caddo]] is spoken by only 25 people, [[Pawnee language|Pawnee]] by 10, and [[Arikara language|Arikara]] by 10. Caddo and Pawnee are spoken in Oklahoma by small numbers of tribal elders. Arikara is spoken on the [[Fort Berthold Reservation]] in [[North Dakota]].

Speakers of some of the languages were formerly more widespread; the [[Caddo]], for example, used to live in northeastern [[Texas]], southwestern [[Arkansas]], and northwestern [[Louisiana]], as well as southeastern Oklahoma.  The [[Pawnee people|Pawnee]] formerly lived along the [[Platte River]] in what is now [[Nebraska]].

==Prehistory==

[[Glottochronology]] is a controversial method of reconstructing, in broad detail, the history of a language and its relationships. In the case of Proto-Caddoan, it appeared to have divided into two branches, Northern and Southern, more than 3000 years ago. (The division of the language implies also a geographic and/or political separation.)

South Caddoan, or Caddo proper, evolved in north-eastern Texas and adjacent Oklahoma, Arkansas, and Louisiana. Other than Caddo, no daughter languages are known, but some unrecorded ones likely existed in the 16th and the 17th centuries.

Northern Caddoan evolved into several different languages.  The language that became Wichita, with several different dialects, branched off about 2000 years ago. Kitsai separated from the Northern Caddoan stem about 1200 years ago, and Pawnee and Arikara separated 300 to 500 years ago.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/tejas/fundamentals/images/caddoan_tree.html Caddoan Tree]", Texas Beyond History website, accessed 30 May 2011; Schleser, Karl H. ''Plains Indians, A.D. 500 to 1500: The Archaeological Past of Historic Groups''. Norman: U of OK Press, 1994, pp. 147-148&lt;/ref&gt;

==External relations==
[[Adai language|Adai]], a [[language isolate]] known only from a 275-word list collected in 1804, may be a Caddoan language.  The documentation is too scanty to determine with certainty. The Adai lived in Louisiana.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.native-languages.org/adai.htm Adai]." Native Languages, accessed 1 Jun 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The language of the [[Eyeish]] or Ais, who lived adjacent to the Caddo, was a distinct language, but was probably related to Caddoan.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.texasbeyondhistory.net/dolores/ais.html Who were the Ais]." Texas Beyond History, accessed 1 Jun 2011&lt;/ref&gt; (An unrelated people, also called the [[Ais people|Ais]], lived in Florida.)

Some linguists believe that the Caddoan, [[Iroquoian languages|Iroquoian]], and [[Siouan languages]] may be connected in a [[Macro-Siouan languages|Macro-Siouan]] language family, but their work is suggestive and the theory remains hypothetical.  Similar attempts to find a connection with the [[Algonquian languages]] have been inconclusive.  There is insufficient evidence for linguists to propose a hypothetical Macro-Algonquian/Iroquoian language family.&lt;ref&gt;Mithun, Marianne. ''The Languages of Native North America''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press, 1999, p. 305&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Caesius Bassus''' was a [[Roman Empire|Roman]] lyric poet who lived in the reign of [[Nero]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Epic and Empire in Vespasianic Rome: A New Reading of Valerius Flaccus' Argonautica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z4ltLjx_2woC&amp;pg=PA8|date=5 July 2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-964408-7|pages=8–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was the intimate friend of [[Aulus Persius Flaccus|Persius]], who dedicated his sixth satire to him, and whose works he edited (''Schol. on Persius'', vi. I). He is said to have lost his life in the eruption of [[Vesuvius]] in AD 79. He had a great reputation as a poet; [[Quintilian]] (''Instit.'' x. I. 96) goes so far as to say that with the exception of [[Horace]], he was the only lyric poet worth reading.

He is also identified with the author of a treatise ''De Metris'' of which considerable fragments, probably of an abbreviated edition, are extant (ed. Keil, 1885).&lt;ref name="HaaseTemporini1998"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Wolfgang Haase|author2=Hildegard Temporini|title=Aufstieg und Niedergang der romischen Welt: (ANRW) : Geschichte und Kultur Roms im Spiegel der neueren Forschung : Teil II : Principat|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yluAyffLBScC&amp;pg=PA3254|year=1998|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|isbn=978-3-11-015699-7|pages=3254–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was probably originally in verse, and afterwards recast or epitomized in [[prose]] form to be used as an instruction book. An account of some of the metres of Horace (in Keil, ''Grammatici Latini'', vi. 305), bearing the title ''Ars Caesii Bassi de Metris'' is not by him but chiefly borrowed by its unknown author, from the treatise mentioned above.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2656">'''Cape Flats English''' (abbreviated '''CFE''') or '''Coloured English''' is the variety of [[South African English]] spoken mostly in the [[Cape Flats]] area of [[Cape Town]].{{sfnp|Finn|2004|p=964}} Its speakers most often refer to it as "broken English", which probably reflects an incorrect perception that it is simply inadequately-learned English, but it is really a distinct, legitimate dialect of English.{{sfnp|Malan|1996|p=134}}

Cape Flats English is very close to the Broad (or "Extreme") variety of White South African English. {{Harvcoltxt|Wood|1987}} argues that the Respectable−Extreme (or "Cultivated−Broad") dichotomy can also be set up for CFE itself, with the former being used by the middle-class (whose L1 tends to be CFE) and the latter being used by the working-class (whose L1 tends to be the Cape Vernacular variety of [[Afrikaans]]).{{sfnp|Finn|2004|pp=967–968}}

* [[Double negative]]s occur in the context of a co-occurring indefinite, as in "I didn't catch '''nothing'''".{{sfnp|Malan|1996|pp=138–139}}

'''Caquinte''' (Caquinte Campa), also '''Poyenisati''', is an [[Arawakan language]] of [[Peru]]. It is spoken along the Poyeni, Mayapo, Picha, Yori, and Agueni rivers, with some speakers along parts of the Sensa and Vitiricaya rivers, within [[Junín, Peru]].&lt;ref&gt;Fabián Montoya Terrones (2002). Naciones amazónicas. Editorial San Marcos.&lt;/ref&gt; It is an endangered language.&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Campbell; Verónica Grondona (27 January 2012). The Indigenous Languages of South America: A Comprehensive Guide. Walter de Gruyter. pp. 214–. {{ISBN|978-3-11-025803-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Caquinte people are a division of the [[Asháninka|Campa]] Indians. They mostly live outside the "regional [[cash economy]]". They raise [[manioc]] as protein [[Staple foods|staple]], being a [[Subsistence agriculture|subsistence agricultural]] community. Their population approximates 1000 people, with "sporadic" outside contact.&lt;ref&gt;James Stuart Olson (1991). The Indians of Central and South America: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary. Greenwood Publishing Group. pp. 73–. {{ISBN|978-0-313-26387-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''closeout''' sale is the final [[discounts and allowances|sale]] of an item either by a retailer or sell off of a retailer [[inventory]] to a third-party company. It may be a given model of item that is not selling well, or in the case of the final closure of a [[retailer]] because of a relocation, a [[fire]] ([[fire sale]]), extra inventory, or especially because of a [[bankruptcy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.hjcloseouts.com/really-closeout-sale/|title=So What Really Is A Closeout Sale - H&amp;J Liquidators and Closeouts, Inc|date=2013-12-05|newspaper=H&amp;J Liquidators and Closeouts, Inc|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the latter case, it is usually known as a going-out-of-[[business]] sale, and is part of a [[liquidation]]. A "hail sale" is a closeout at a [[car dealership]] after [[hail]] damage. Often, when the store is shutting down, they let people know that this is their last chance to buy the merchandise. However, often it's companies that can't sell their inventory, inventors that had a bad idea or businesses that are looking for fast cash flow to pay their bills such as payroll, etc.
 
A '''closeout store''' is a retailer specializing in buying closeout items [[wholesale]] from other retailers and selling them at a [[discounts and allowances|discount]]. [[Big Lots]] is a well-known closeout [[retail chain|store chain]] in the U.S., but other stores such as [[TJ Maxx]], [[Ross Dress For Less]], [[Marshalls]], and [[Value City]] are also common, specializing more in [[clothing]] and [[houseware]]s.
==Limitations==
Some clearance [[merchandise]] is non-returnable at some stores, as the intent is of course to get rid of the items. This is especially the case with liquidation and store-closing sales. However, in many jusrisdictions such as the United Kingdom, consumers retain their usual rights during a sale, such as the right to return faulty goods (under the [[Sale of Goods Act 1979]]) and the right to return goods granted by the [[Distance Selling Regulations]].

Rather than storing merchandise until the following year, almost every U.S. store also has post-[[holiday]] clearance sales now, sometimes starting even before the holiday (especially [[Christmas]] and [[Halloween]]). Early discounts are often around 25%, but range from zero to as much as 50%, particularly if the "regular" prices were deliberately inflated as some stores do. 50% is common just after the holiday, often followed by 75%, and sometimes even 90%, at which point there is very little if anything left to choose from. Often during after-Christmas clearance sales, they let people know that this is their chance to buy everything they didn't get for Christmas, or as the phrase goes, "everything [[Santa Claus]] forgot." Particularly in Canada, “[[Boxing Day]] sales” draw large crowds of shoppers seeking after-Christmas closeout deals.

Some stores do pack-up holiday merchandise after going 50% off for a [[week]] or so, but often fail to remove the items from shelves before going back to regular price, especially if the items are non-perishable. A few merchants actually get [[Debits and credits|credit]] back from [[vendor]]s if they do not sell certain merchandise (this, in turn, is more common with perishable merchandise, such as fresh food), who in turn may sell it to a closeout store at reduced prices.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

Some [[customer]]s take note of when specific retailers normally mark down merchandise further, showing up at the store on the very first day for the best selection. More general seasonal merchandise (such as winter clothing or summer [[patio]] [[furniture]]) is also put on clearance, but at more irregular times, making way for new [[fashion]]s and [[fad]]s.

Even [[thrift store]]s have "rolling" closeouts. In this case, all merchandise put out in a given week is given a colored tag, or a letter to indicate what color if the item is directly marked with a [[grease pencil]]. During the last week before the color is used again, everything marked in that color is discounted, usually by 50%. At the end of the week, all remaining item with that tag color are removed from the shelves. There are typically four colors, so that all merchandise is rotated every [[month]] or so. Some independent stores may use other similar systems, such as using more colors, and possibly marking down a color by 25% the week before it goes 50% off.

Clearance sales typically occur on clearance racks in brick-and-mortar stores. Stores typically place merchandise on a clearance rack and mark the price down until someone purchases the item. This clearance sale can be further enhanced by using banners and signs, both on the interior and exterior of the store. This process has been replicated on the internet. The defunct drop.com was the first clearance website to mimic a retail store clearance rack by allowing sellers to automatically mark down their items to a pool of consumers.

[[File:Kyrgyz Manaschi, Karakol.jpg|thumb|right|A traditional Kyrgyz ''[[Epic of Manas|manaschi]]'' performing part of the epic poem (dastan) at a yurt camp in [[Karakol]]]]
'''Dastan''' ({{lang-fa|داستان}} ''dâstân'', meaning "story" or "tale")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steingass|first=Francis Joseph|authorlink=Francis Joseph Steingass|title=A Comprehensive Persian-English Dictionary, Including the Arabic Words and Phrases to Be Met with in Persian Literature|place=London|publisher=Routledge &amp; K.

A dastan is generally centered on one individual who protects his tribe or his people from an outside invader or enemy, although only occasionally can this figure be traced back to a historical person. This main character sets an example of how one should act, and the dastan becomes a teaching tool — for example the [[Sufi]] master and Turkic poet [[Khoja Akhmet Yassawi|Ahmet Yesevi]] said "Let the scholars hear my wisdom, treating my words like a dastan".{{Quote without source|date=November 2018}} Alongside the wisdom, each dastan is rich with cultural history of interest to scholars.

During the [[Russian conquest of Central Asia|Russian invasion and occupation of Central Asia]], many new dastans were created to protest the Russian occupation. It is possible that they came into contact and influenced each other. According to Turkish historian [[Hasan Bülent Paksoy]], the [[Bolsheviks]] tried to destroy these symbols of culture, e.g. by only publishing them in insufficiently large quantities and in a distorted form "in order to weaken the heroic impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paksoy|first=H.B.|authorlink=Hasan Bülent Paksoy|chapter-url=http://vlib.iue.it/carrie/texts/carrie_books/paksoy-6/cae05.html|chapter=Dastan Genre in Central Asia|title=Essays on Central Asia|year=1999|place=Lawrence|publisher=Carrie|pages=82|OCLC=45603165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A notable dastan is ''[[Book of Dede Korkut|Korkut Ata]]'' of the [[Oghuz Turks]] — which may have been created as early as the beginning of the 13th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meeker|first=Michael E.|title=The Dede Korkut Ethic|journal=International Journal of Middle East Studies|volume=24|issue=3|date=August 1992|pages=395–417|doi=10.1017/S0020743800021954|quote=The ''Book of Dede Korkut'' is an early record of oral [[Turkish folklore|Turkic folktales]] in [[Anatolia]], and as such, one of the mythic charters of Turkish nationalist ideology. The oldest versions of the ''Book of Dede Korkut'' consist of two manuscripts copied in the 16th century. The twelve stories that are recorded in these manuscripts are believed to be derived from a cycle of stories and songs circulating among [[Turkic peoples]] living in northeastern Anatolia and northwestern Azerbaijan. According to [[Geoffrey Lewis (scholar)|Lewis]] (1974), an older substratum of these oral traditions dates to conflicts between the ancient Oghuz and their Turkish rivals in Central Asia (the Pecheneks and the Kipchaks), but this substratum has been clothed in references to the 14th-century campaigns of the [[Aq Qoyunlu|Akkoyunlu Confederation]] of Turkic tribes against the Georgians, the Abkhaz, and the Greeks in Trebizond. Such stories and songs would have emerged no earlier than the beginning of the 13th century, and the written versions that have reached us would have been composed no later than the beginning of the 15th century. By this time, the Turkic peoples in question had been in touch with Islamic civilization for several centuries, had come to call themselves “Turcoman” rather than “Oghuz,” had close associations with sedentary and urbanized societies, and were participating in Islamized regimes that included nomads, farmers, and townsmen. Some had abandoned their nomadic way of life altogether.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Limitryu Tupaq Yupanki''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''Demetrio Túpac Yupanaki'') (22 December 1923 – 3 May 2018) was a [[Peru]]vian [[Quechua language]] professor (or more accurate [[Southern Quechua]]), a translator from Castilian to Quechua&lt;ref&gt;[https://larepublica.pe/sociedad/686208-demetrio-tupac-yupanqui-si-el-quechua-se-aprende-de-pequeno-queda-para-toda-la-vida Demetrio Túpac Yupanqui: “Si el quechua se aprende de pequeño queda para toda la vida”] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and journalist.

He went to [[Lima]], where he studied Philosophy at the [[Pontifical Catholic University of Peru]], and then Law at the [[National University of San Marcos]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://elcomercio.pe/lima/991477/noticia-demetrio-tupac-yupanqui-nunca-me-avergonce-llevar-mi-apellido Demetrio Túpac Yupanqui: “Nunca me avergoncé de llevar mi apellido”] {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; He worked in the newspaper ''La Prensa'', and began teaching Quechua.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10942">{{other uses|Drive reduction theory (learning theory)}}

In [[psychology]], a '''drive theory''' or '''drive doctrine'''&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt; is a theory that attempts to define, analyze, or classify the psychological drives. A drive is an "excitatory state produced by a [[Homeostasis|homeostatic]] disturbance",&lt;ref&gt;Seward, J. (1956). drive, incentive, and reinforcement. Psychological Review, 63, 19-203. [https://pallas2.tcl.sc.edu/login?url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=pdh&amp;AN=rev-63-3-195&amp;site=ehost-live]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; an instinctual need that has the power of driving the [[Behavior|behaviour]] of an individual.&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Szondi]] (1972), [https://books.google.com/books?id=_lMAAAAAMAAJ ''Lehrbuch der Experimentellen Triebdiagnostik''] p.25 quotation: {{quotation|Abschnitt I Trieblehre, Kapitel I Das Menschliche Triebsystem. &lt;br /&gt;
Triebe sind Radikale der menschlichen Handlungen und Verhaltungen. Sie sind die bedingenden und erhaltenden Wurzeln des menschlichen Daseins überhaupt.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drive theory is based on the principle that organisms are born with certain psychological needs and that a negative state of tension is created when these needs are not satisfied. When a need is satisfied, drive is reduced and the organism returns to a state of homeostasis and relaxation. According to the theory, drive tends to increase over time and operates on a feedback control system, much like a thermostat.

== Psychoanalysis ==
{{Psychoanalysis |Concepts}}

In [[psychoanalysis]], drive theory ({{lang-de|Triebtheorie}} or ''{{lang|de|Trieblehre}}'')&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt; refers to the theory of drives, motivations, or instincts, that have clear objects.{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} When an internal imbalance is detected by homeostatic mechanisms, a drive to restore balance is produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hockenbury |first=Don |date=2012|title=Psychology |location=United States |publisher=Worth Publishers |page=320 |access-date=June 28, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1927, [[Sigmund Freud]] said that a drive theory was what was lacking most in psychoanalysis. He was opposed to [[systematics]] in psychology, rejecting it as a form of paranoia, and instead classified drives with dichotomies like [[Eros_(concept)#Sigmund_Freud|Eros]]/[[Death drive|Thanatos]] drives, the drives toward life and death, respectively, and sexual/ego drives.&lt;ref name="Mélon96"&gt;Mélon, Jean (1996), [http://www.szondiforum.org/t419.htm ''Notes on the History of the Szondi Movement''] ([http://www.szondiforum.org/t429.htm French original]). Text for the Szondi Congress of Cracow, August 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

Freud's ''[[Civilization and Its Discontents]]'' was published in Germany in 1930, when the [[Adolf Hitler#Rise to power|rise of fascism]] in that country was well under way, and the warnings of a second European war were leading to opposing calls for rearmament and pacifism. Against this background, Freud wrote "In face of the destructive forces unleashed, now it may be expected that the other of the two 'heavenly forces,' eternal Eros, will put forth his strength so as to maintain himself alongside of his equally immortal adversary."&lt;ref&gt;Freud, S. (1961). ''Civilization and its discontents''. J. Strachey, transl. New York: W. W. Norton.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, Hungarian [[psychiatrist]] and psychologist [[Leopold Szondi]] aimed instead at a systematic drive theory.&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Leopold Szondi]] [1947] (1952), [https://books.google.com/books?id=kOsUAAAAIAAJ ''Experimental Diagnostics of Drives''], Introduction of the first edition, quotation: {{quotation|A drive system must give us a synthetic sight of the whole of the drive activities, comparable to the total impression which white light gives us, but it must also make it possible to display 'the spectrum' of the drives just like light can be divided in colours. It is an extremely difficult task and it is not at all astonishing that we have not yet arrived at this point.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Szondi test#Drive theory and drive diagram|Szondi Drive Diagram]] has been described as a revolutionary addition to psychology, and as paving the way for a theoretical psychiatry and a [[Psychological anthropology|psychoanalytical anthropology]].&lt;ref name="Mélon96"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qKgwAQAAIAAJ ''Livres de France''] (1989), Issues 106-109 quotation: {{quotation|Cherche à jeter les bases d'une authentique anthropologie psychanalytique d'après le schéma pulsionnel de Szondi.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early attachment theory ==

In early [[attachment theory]], behavioural drive reduction was proposed by Dollard and Miller (1950) as an explanation of the mechanisms behind early attachment in infants. Behavioural drive reduction theory suggests that infants are born with innate drives, such as hunger and thirst, which only the caregiver, usually the mother, can reduce. Through a process of [[classical conditioning]], the infant learns to associate the mother with the satisfaction of reduced drive and is thus able to form a key attachment bond. However, this theory is challenged by the work done by [[Harry Harlow]], particularly the experiments involving the [[Harry Harlow#Surrogate mother experiment|maternal separation of rhesus monkeys]], which indicate that comfort possesses greater motivational value than hunger.&lt;ref name="test"&gt;Harlow H F; Zimmermann R. R. (1959). [http://science.sciencemag.org/content/130/3373/421 Affectional responses in the infant monkey] Science, vol(130):421-432. [http://web.comhem.se/u52239948/08/harlow59.pdf PDF].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Social psychology==

In [[social psychology]], drive theory was used by [[Robert Zajonc]] in 1965 as an explanation of the phenomenon of [[social facilitation]].&lt;ref&gt;Zajonc, R. B. (1965). Social facilitation. ''Science'', ''149'', 269-274.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[audience effect]] notes that, in some cases, the presence of a passive audience will facilitate the better performance of a task, while in other cases the presence of an audience will inhibit the performance of a task. Zajonc's drive theory suggests that the variable determining direction of performance is whether the task is composed of a correct dominant response (that is, the task is perceived as being subjectively easy to the individual) or an incorrect dominant response (perceived as being subjectively difficult).

In the presence of a passive audience, an individual is in a heightened state of [[arousal]]. Increased arousal, or [[stress (biological)|stress]], causes the individual to enact behaviours that form dominant responses, since an individual's dominant response is the most likely response, given the skills which are available. If the dominant response is correct, then social presence enhances performance of the task. However, if the dominant response is incorrect, social presence produces an impaired performance.

=== Corroborative evidence ===

Such behaviour was first noticed by Triplett (1898) while observing the cyclists who were racing together versus cyclists who were racing alone.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} It was found that the mere presence of other cyclists produced greater performance. A similar effect was observed by Chen (1937) in [[ant]]s building colonies.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} However, it was not until Zajonc investigated this behaviour in the 1960s that any empirical explanation for the audience effect was pursued.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

Zajonc's drive theory is based on an experiment&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Zajonc | first1 = R. B. | last2 = Heingartner | first2 = A. | last3 = Herman | first3 = E. M. | doi = 10.1037/h0028063 | title = Social enhancement and impairment of performance in the cockroach | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | pages = 83 | year = 1969 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; involving the investigation of the effect of social facilitation in [[cockroach]]es. Zajonc devised a study in which individual cockroaches were released into a tube, at the end of which there was a light. In the presence of other cockroaches as spectators, cockroaches were observed to achieve a significantly faster time in reaching the light than those in the control, no-spectator group. However, when cockroaches in the same conditions were given a maze to negotiate, performance was impaired in the spectator condition, demonstrating that incorrect dominant responses in the presence of an audience impair performance.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

=== Evaluation apprehension ===

Cottrell's [[evaluation apprehension model]] later refined this theory to include yet another variable in the mechanisms of social facilitation. He suggested that the correctness of dominant responses only plays a role in social facilitation when there is an expectation of social reward or punishment based on performance. His study differs in design from Zajonc's as he introduced a separate condition in which participants were given tasks to perform in the presence of an audience that was blindfolded, and thus unable to evaluate the participant's performance. It was found that no social facilitation effect occurred, and hence the anticipation of performance evaluation must play a role in social facilitation.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}} Evaluation apprehension, however, is only key in human social facilitation and is not observed in other animals.{{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1419">The '''''empty chair''''' is a non-party to a [[civil lawsuit]] who might also be blamed for the [[damages]].  To the [[defendant]], the advantage of shifting blame to the empty chair, a strategy called the ''empty chair defense'', is that the empty chair is not there to defend itself, forcing the [[plaintiff]] to defend it.  This is why [[plaintiff]]s try to name all possible parties that might be blamed when filing a lawsuit.  In interrogatories, plaintiffs will typically follow up by asking defendants to confirm that everyone who might be blamed has been named as a defendant.  Sometimes, that is not possible, for example, if a party is immune to suit.&lt;ref&gt;

'''Fiji Hindi''' or '''Fijian Hindi''' (Fijian Hindi: फ़िजी हिंदी) also known locally as "Hindustani", is an [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language spoken by most [[Indians in Fiji|Fijian citizens of Indian descent]], though a small number speak other languages at home.&lt;ref name="e18" /&gt; It is an [[Eastern Hindi language|Eastern Hindi]] language, generally considered to be an older dialect of the [[Awadhi language|Awadhi]] language spoken in central and east [[Uttar Pradesh]] that has been subject to considerable influence by [[Bhojpuri language|Bhojpuri]], [[Magahi]] and other [[Bihari languages]]. It has also borrowed some words from the [[Fijian language|Fijian]] and English languages. A large number of words, unique to Fiji Hindi, have been created to cater for the new environment that Indo-Fijians now live in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indianexpress.com/article/research/hindi-diwas-2018-hindi-travelled-to-these-five-countries-from-india/|title=Hindi Diwas 2018: Hindi travelled to these five countries from India}}&lt;/ref&gt; First-generation Indians in Fiji, who used the language as a [[lingua franca]] in Fiji, referred to it as ''Fiji Baat'', "Fiji talk". It is closely related to [[Caribbean Hindustani]] and the [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] spoken in [[Mauritius]] and [[Indian South Africans |South Africa]].

== History ==
This is the speaking percentage of each language and dialect that indentured labourers who came to Fiji spoke.
{|class="wikitable"
|-
! Language/Dialect !! Number !! Percentage
|-
|''Bihari Dialects (Includes [[Bhojpuri]], [[Maithili language|Maithili]] and [[Magahi]])''   ||17,868  ||39.3%
|-
|''Eastern Hindi Dialects ([[Awadhi]])''   ||16,871  ||37.1%
|-
|''Western Hindi Dialects ([[Khariboli]], [[Bundeli]], etc...)''   ||6,903  ||15.2%
|-

|-
|''Dravidian Languages ([[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], etc...)''   ||2,186  ||4.8%
|}

Indian [[Girmityas|indentured labourer]]s, spoke mainly dialects from the [[Hindi Belt]]. Initially, the majority of labourers came to Fiji from districts of central and eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] and [[Bihar]], while a small percentage hailed from [[North-West Frontier (military history)|North-West Frontier]] and [[South India]] such as [[Andhra Pradesh]] and [[Tamil Nadu]] in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

Over time, a distinct [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] language with an [[Eastern Hindi]] [[Substratum (linguistics)|substratum]] developed in [[Fiji]], combining elements of the [[Hindi languages]] spoken in these areas with some native Fijian and [[English language|English]]. The development of Fiji Hindi was accelerated by the need for labourers speaking different languages to work together and by the practice of leaving young children in early versions of day-care centers during working hours. Percy Wright, who lived in Fiji during the indenture period, wrote:

{{quote|Indian children born in Fiji will have a mixed language; there are many different dialects amongst the Indian population, and of course much intercourse with the Fijians. The children pick up a little of each language, and do not know which is the one originally spoken by their parents.|&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Seventy-two years in Australia and the South Pacific|last = Wright|first = Percey|year = 1910|publisher = Mitchell Library|location = Sydney}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other writers, including Burton&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Fiji of Today|last= Burton|first= John W.|year= 1910|publisher= Charles H. Kelly|location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1914) and Lenwood&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Pastels from the Pacific |last= Lenwood|first= F.|year= 1917|publisher= Oxford University Press|location=London }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1917), made similar observations. By the late 1920s all Fiji Indian children born in Fiji learned Fiji Hindi, which became the common language in Fiji of North and South Indians alike.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Status==
Later, approximately 15,000 Indian indentured labourers, who were mainly speakers of [[Dravidian languages]] ([[Tamil language|Tamil]], [[Telugu language|Telugu]], [[Kannada]], [[Tulu language|Tulu]], and [[Malayalam]]), were brought from [[South India]]. By this time Fiji Hindi was well established as the lingua franca of Indo-Fijians and the Southern Indian labourers had to learn it to communicate with the more numerous Northern Indians and their European overseers. After the end of the indenture system, Indians who spoke [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] arrived in Fiji as free immigrants. A few Indo-Fijians speak Tamil, Telugu, and Gujarati at home, but all are fluently conversant and able to communicate using Fiji Hindi.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} The census reports of 1956 and 1966 shows the extent to which Fiji Hindi (referred to as 'Hindustani' in the census) was being spoken in Indo-Fijian households.

&lt;/div&gt;
Fiji Hindi is also understood and even spoken by Indigenous Fijians in areas of Fiji where there are large Indo-Fijian communities. Following the recent [[Politics of Fiji#Political conditions|political upheaval in Fiji]], a large number of Indo-Fijians have emigrated to Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States, where they have largely maintained their traditional Indo-Fijian culture, language, and religion.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

Some writers have begun to use Fiji Hindi, until very recently a spoken language only, as a literary language. The Bible has now been translated into Fiji Hindi, and the [[University of the South Pacific]] has recently begun offering courses in the language. Fiji Hindi is written using both the [[Latin script]] and the Devanāgarī script.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

A Fiji Hindi movie has also been produced depicting Indo-Fijian life and is based on a play by local playwright, [[Raymond Pillai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Fiji Hindi film set to be released soon |url=http://www.fijilive.com/news/show/news/2007/02/09/09Fijilive09.html |publisher=[[Fijilive]] |date=9 February 2007 |accessdate=10 July 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;



== Phonology ==
{{see also|Hindi–Urdu phonology}}
The [[phoneme]]s of Fiji Hindi are very similar to Standard Hindi, but there are some important distinctions. As in the [[Bhojpuri]] and [[Awadhi]] dialects of the [[Hindi Belt]] spoken in rural [[India]], mainly [[Bihar]] and Eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] — the [[consonant]] "sh" is replaced with "s" (for example, ''saadi'' instead of ''shaadi'') and "v" replaced with "b" (for example, ''bid-es'' instead of ''videsh''). There is also a tendency to ignore the differences between the consonants "ph" and "f" (In Fiji Hindi a fruit is ''fal'' instead of ''phal'') and between "j" and "z" (In Fiji Hindi land is ''jameen'' instead of ''zameen''). The consonant "n" is used in Fiji Hindi for the nasal sounds "ṅ", "ñ" and "ṇ" in Standard Hindi. These features are common in the [[Eastern Hindi]] dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Language transplanted: the development of overseas Hindi |last=Barz |first= Richard K.|author2=Jeff Siegel |year= 1988|publisher= OttoHarrassowitz|location= Wiesbaden|isbn=3-447-02872-6 |page = 127}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some other characteristics of Fiji Hindi which is similar to [[Bhojpuri]] and [[Awadhi]] are:
* Pronunciation of the vowels ''ai'' and ''au'' as diphthongs, rather than monophthongs (as in standard Hindi). For example, ''bhauji'' (sister-in-law) and ''gaiya'' (cow).
* Coda clusters are removed with the use of vowels. For example, ''dharm'' (religion) is pronounced as ''dharam''.
* Shortening of long vowels before a stressed symbol. For example, ''Raajen'' (a common name) is pronounced as ''Rajen''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aladinrc.wrlc.org/bitstream/1961/3455/23/gurt_1999_22.pdf South Asian bilingualism: Hindi and Bhojpuri]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Morphology ==

=== Verb ===

====Etymology====
In Fiji Hindi [[verb]] forms have been influenced by a number of Hindi dialects in India. First and [[Grammatical person|second person]] forms of verbs in Fiji Hindi are the same, there is no [[Grammatical gender|gender]] distinction and [[Grammatical number|number]] distinction is only in the [[grammatical person|third person]] past tense. Although, gender is used in third person past tense by the usage of "raha" for a male versus "rahi" for a female.

The use of the first and second person [[imperfective]] suffixes ''-taa'', ''-at'' are of [[Awadhi]] origin. 
Example: तुम मन्दिर जाता हैं / तुम मन्दिर जात हैं। "tum Mandir jaata hai/tum Mandir jaat hai." (You are going to the Temple).

While the third person imperfective suffix ''-e'' is of [[Bhojpuri]] origin. 
Example: ई बिल्ली मच्छरी खावे हैं। "Ee billi macchari KHAWE hai." (This cat is eating a fish).

The third person [[perfective]] suffixes (for [[transitive verb]]s) ''-is'' and ''-in'' are also derived from Awadhi. 
Example: किसान गन्ना काटीस रहा। "Kisaan ganna katees raha." (The farmer cut the sugarcane). 
पण्डित लोगन रामायण पढ़ीन रहा/पण्डित लोगन रामायण पढ़े रहीन। "Pandit logan Ramayan padheen raha/padhe raheen." (The priests read the Ramayana).

The third person definite future suffix ''-ii'' is found in both Awadhi and Bhojpuri. 
Example: प्रधानमंत्री हमलोग के पैसा दई। "Pradhanamantri humlog ke paisa daii" (The prime minister will give us money).

The influence of [[Hindustani language|Hindustani]] is evident in the first and second person perfective suffix ''-aa'' and the first and second person future siffix ''-ega''. 
Example: हम करा। तुम करेगा। "Hum karaa, tum karega." (I did, you will do).

The origin of the imperative suffix ''-o'' can be traced to the [[Magahi]] dialect. 
Example: तुम अपन मुह खोलो। "Tum apan muh khulo." (You open your mouth). Spoken in the [[Gaya district|Gaya]] and [[Patna]] districts, which provided a sizeable proportion of the first [[indenture]]d labourers from Northern India to Fiji.

Fiji Hindi has developed its own polite imperative suffix ''-naa''. 
Example: आप घर के सफा कर लेना। "Aap ghar ke sapha kar Lena." (You clean the house (polite)).

The suffix ''-be'', from Bhojpuri, is used in Fiji Hindi in emphatic sentences.

Another suffix originating from Awadhi is ''-it''. 
Example: ई लोगन पानी काहे नहीं पीत हैं। "Ee logan paani kahey nahi peet hai." (Why aren't these people drinking water."
but is at present going out of use.{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

==== Tenses ====

Fiji Hindi tenses are relatively similar to tenses in [[Standard Hindi]]. Bhojpuri and Awadhi influence the Fiji Hindi tenses.

|-

|{{Lang|hi|वे आये}} ({{IAST|ve āye}})
|}

== Grammatical features ==

* Fiji Hindi does not have plurals. For example, one house is ''ek gharr'' and two houses is ''dui gharr''. In this example, the number is used to denote plurality. Plurals can also be stated with the use of ''log''. For example, ''ee'' means "this person" (singular) and ''ee log'' means "these people" (plural). ''Sabb'' (all) and ''dHerr'' (many) are also used to denote plural. There are some exceptions, however. For example, a boy is ''larrka'' (single) but boys are ''larrkan'' (plural). Older generations still use a similar form of plural, for example, ''admian'', for more than one man (singular: ''admi'').{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}
* There is no definite article ("the") in Fiji Hindi, but definite nouns can be made by adding the suffix ''wa''; for example, ''larrka'' (a boy) and ''larrkwa'' (the boy). Definite nouns are also created using the suffix "kana"; for example, ''chhota'' (small) and ''chhotkana'' (the small one). Another way of indicating a definite article is by the use of pronouns: ''ii'' (this), ''uu'' (that) and ''wahii'' (the same one).{{Citation needed|date=April 2015}}

== Fijian loan words ==

Indo-Fijians now use native Fijian words for those things that were not found in their ancestral India but which existed in Fiji. These include most fish names and root crops. For example, ''kanade'' for [[mullet (fish)]] and ''kumaala'' for [[sweet potato]] or yam. Other examples are:

|-
| bilo ||{{Lang|hif|बिलो}}||bilo||cup made of [[coconut]], used to drink [[kava]]
|}

== Words derived from English ==

Many English words have also been borrowed into Fiji Hindi with sound changes to fit the Indo-Fijian pronunciation. For example, ''[[Wiktionary:houtel|hutel]]'' in Fiji Hindi is borrowed from hotel in English. Some words borrowed from English have a specialised meaning, for example, ''[[Wiktionary:garaund|garaund]]'' in Fiji Hindi means a playing field, ''[[Wiktionary:geng|geng]]'' in Fiji Hindi means a "work gang", particularly a cane-cutting gang in the sugar cane growing districts and ''[[Wiktionary:tichaa|tichaa]]'' in Fiji Hindi specifically means a female teacher. There are also unique Fijian Hindi words created from English words, for example, ''[[Wiktionary:kantaap|kantaap]]'' means cane-top.

== Semantic shifts ==

=== Indian languages ===
Many words of Hindustani origin have shifted meaning in Fiji Hindi. These are due to either innovations in Fiji or continued use of the old meaning in Fiji Hindi when the word is either not used in Standard Hindi anymore or has evolved a different meaning altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Barz |first=Richard |author2=Jeff Siegel |title=Language Transplanted: The Development of Overseas Hindi |year=1988 |publisher=Otto Harrassowitz |location=Wiesbaden |isbn=3-447-02872-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples are:

== Counting ==

Though broadly based on standard Hindi, counting in Fiji Hindi reflects a number of cross-language and dialectal influences acquired in the past 125 years.

The pronunciation for numbers between one and ten show slight inflections, seemingly inspired by Bihari dialects such as Bhojpuri. The number two, consequently, is {{Lang|hi|दो}} ({{IAST|do}}) in standard Hindi, while in Fiji Hindi it is ''dui'' ({{Lang|hif|दुइ}}), just as it is in Bhojpuri.

Words for numbers between 10 and 99 present a significant difference between standard and Fiji Hindi. While, as in other north Indian languages, words for [[b:Hindi:Numbers|numbers in standard Hindustani]] are formed by mentioning units first and then multiples of ten, Fiji Hindi reverses the order and mentions the tens multiple first and the units next, as is the practice in many European and South-Indian languages. That is to say, while "twenty-one" in Standard Hindi is {{Lang|hi|इक्कीस}} ({{IAST|ikkīs}}), an internal [[sandhi]] of ''ek aur biis'', or "one-and-twenty", in Fiji Hindi the order would be reversed, and simply be ''biis aur ek'' ({{Lang|hif|बिस और एक}}), without any additional morpho-phonological alteration. Similarly, while the number thirty-seven in standard Hindi is {{Lang|hi|सैंतीस}} ({{IAST|saintīs}}), for ''saat aur tiis'' or "seven-and-thirty", the number would be ''tiis aur saat'' ({{Lang|hif|तिस और सात}}), or 'thirty-and-seven' in Fiji Hindi.

Additionally, powers of ten beyond ten-thousand, ''[[lakh]]'' (100,000) and ''[[crore|karor]]'' (10 million) are not used in Fiji Hindi.{{Examples|date=May 2017}}

== Spread overseas ==
{{main|Fiji Indian diaspora}}
With political upheavals in Fiji beginning with the first [[1987 Fijian coups d'état|military coup in 1987]], large numbers of Indo-Fijians have since migrated overseas and at present there are significant communities of Indo-Fijian expatriates in Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United States. Smaller communities also reside on other [[Pacific Islands]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. The last census in each of the countries where Fiji Hindi is spoken (counting Indo-Fijians who were born in Fiji) provides the following figures:

==Writers==
* '''Rodney F. Moag''', who had lived in India before joining the University of the South Pacific as a lecturer. He analysed Fiji Hindi and concluded that it was a unique language with its own distinct grammar, rather than "broken Hindi", as it had been previously referred to. Moag documented his findings and wrote lessons using the Fijian Hindi dialect in the book, ''Fiji Hindi: a basic course and reference grammar'' (1977).
* '''Jeff Siegel''', in his thesis on ''Plantation languages in Fiji'' (1985), has written a detailed account of the development of Fiji Hindi and its different forms as used by Indo-Fijians and Indigenous Fijians. Earlier, Siegel had written a quick reference guide called ''Say it in Fiji Hindi'' (1976).
* '''Subramani''', professor in literature at the [[University of the South Pacific]], who wrote the first Fiji Hindi novel, ''Duaka Puraan'' (2001), which is the story of Fiji Lal (an old villager) as told by him to a visiting scholar to his village. The book is written in the style of the ''Puraans'' but in a humorous way (''Puraan'' being a sacred text also known as Purana; 18 Puraans have come out of India). He received a Government of India award for his contribution to Hindi language and literature for this novel. In June 2003, in Suriname at the Seventh World Hindi Conference, Professor Subramani was presented with a special award for this novel.
* '''Raymond C. Pillai''' wrote the story for the first Fiji Hindi movie, ''Adhura Sapna'' (Incomplete Dream), produced in 2007.
* '''Urmila Prasad''', who helped translate the Biblical Gospels of Mark, Luke, Matthew and John into Fiji Hindi, written using Roman script, known as ''Susamaachaar Aur Romiyo'' (2002)

A '''film treatment''' (or simply '''treatment''') is a piece of prose, typically the step between scene cards (index cards) and the first draft of a [[screenplay]] for a [[motion picture]], television program, or radio play. It is generally longer and more detailed than an [[Step outline|outline]] (or one-page synopsis), and it may include details of directorial style that an outline omits. Treatments read like a short story, but are told in the present tense and describe events as they happen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lightsfilmschool.com/articles/treatments/index.html |title=Film Treatments |publisher=Lights Film School |accessdate=August 10, 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100306031259/http://www.lightsfilmschool.com/articles/treatments/index.html |archivedate=March 6, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  A treatment may also be created in the process of [[Film adaptation|adapting]] a novel, play, or other pre-existing work into a screenplay.

==Original draft treatment==
The original draft treatment is created during the writing process, and is generally long and detailed. It consists of full-scene outlines put together. Usually there are between thirty and eighty standard [[Letter (paper size)|letter size]] or [[A4 paper#The A series|A4]] pages ([[Courier (typeface)|Courier]] New 12 point), with an average of about forty pages. For example, ''[[The Terminator]]'' is forty-eight pages.

More elaborate forms of the draft treatment are the step outline and the [[scriptment]].

==Presentation treatment==
The presentation treatment is created as presentation material. Generally the scene card descriptions are written out in order, and only have the essential and important story events that make up the scenes. It is the full story in its simplest form, moving from the [[concept]], to the [[Theme (literature)|theme]], to the [[fictional character|character]], to the detailed synopsis of about four to eight pages of [[scene (filming)#master scenes|master scenes]].

Presentation treatments are used to show how the production notes have been incorporated into the screenplay for the [[film director|director]] and [[film producer|production executives]] to look over, or to leave behind as a presentation note after a sales [[Pitch (filmmaking)|pitch]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.filmmakers.com/features/screenwriting/treatment.htm|title=Writing Treatments That Sell|publisher=FilmMakers.com|accessdate=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The presentation treatment is the appropriate treatment to submit if a script submission requires one. They are usually at least three, but under thirty, pages in length, with most being of seven to twelve pages.

==Usage==
Treatments are widely used within the motion picture industry as selling documents to outline story and character aspects of a planned screenplay, whereas outlines are generally produced as part of the [[Screenplay#The Development Process|development process]]. Screenwriters may use a treatment to initially pitch a screenplay, but may also use a treatment to sell a concept they are pitching without a completed screenplay.

The '''frequency format hypothesis''' is the idea that the [[brain]] understands and processes information better when presented in [[frequency]] formats rather than a numerical or [[probability]] format. Thus according to the hypothesis, presenting information as 1 in 5 people rather than 20% leads to better comprehension. The idea was proposed by German scientist [[Gerd Gigerenzer]], after compilation and comparison of data collected between 1976–1997.

== Origin ==

===Automatic encoding===
Certain information about one's experience is often stored in the memory using an implicit [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]] process. Where did you sit last time in class? Do you say the word hello or charisma more? People are very good at answering such questions without actively thinking about it or not knowing how they got that information in the first place. This was the observation that lead to Hasher and Zacks'  1979 study on frequency.

Through their research work, Hasher and Zacks found out that information about frequency is stored without the intention of the person.&lt;ref name="Hasher"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hasher | first1 = L. | last2 = Zacks | first2 = R. | year = 1984 | title = Automatic processing of fundamental information: the case of frequency of occurrence | url = | journal = The American Psychologist | volume = 39 | issue = 12| pages = 1372–1388 | doi=10.1037/0003-066x.39.12.1372 | pmid=6395744}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, training and feedback does not increase ability to encode frequency.&lt;ref name="Lynn Hasher 1979, Pages 356-388"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hasher | first1 = Lynn | last2 = Zacks | first2 = Rose T. | year = 1979 | title = Automatic and effortful processes in memory | url = | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: General | volume = 108 | issue = 3| pages = 356–388 | doi = 10.1037/0096-3445.108.3.356 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Frequency information was also found to be continually registered in the memory, regardless of age, ability or motivation.&lt;ref name="Hasher" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Hasher | first1 = L. | last2 = Chromiak | first2 = W. | year = 1977 | title = The processing of frequency information: An automatic mechanism? | url = | journal = Journal of Verbal Learning and Verbal Behavior | volume = 16 | issue = | pages = 173–184 | doi=10.1016/s0022-5371(77)80045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ability to encode frequency also does not decrease with old age, depression or multiple task requirements.&lt;ref&gt;Hasher&lt;/ref&gt; They called this characteristic of the frequency encoding as  automatic encoding.&lt;ref name="Lynn Hasher 1979, Pages 356-388"/&gt;

=== Infant study ===
Another important evidence for the hypothesis came through the study of infants. In one study, 40 newborn infants were tested for their ability to discriminate between 2 dots versus 3 dots and 4 dots versus 6 dots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Antell | first1 = S. E. | last2 = Keating | first2 = D. P. | year = 1983 | title = Perception of numerical invariance in neonates | url = | journal = Child Development | volume = 54 | issue = 3| pages = 695–701 | doi = 10.2307/1130057 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Even though infants were able to make the discrimination between 2 versus 3 dots, they were not able to distinguish between 4 versus 6 dots. The tested new born infants were only 21 hours to 144 hours old.

Similarly in another study, to test whether infants could recognize numerical correspondences, Starkey et al. designed a series of experiments in which 6 to 8 month old infants were shown pairs of either a display of two objects or a  display of three objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Starkey | first1 = P. | last2 = Spelke | first2 = E. | last3 = Gelman | first3 = R. | year = 1990 | title = Numerical abstraction by human infants | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 36 | issue = 2| pages = 97–127 | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(90)90001-z}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the displays were still visible, infants heard either two or three drumbeats. Measurement of looking time revealed that the infants looked significantly longer toward the display that matched the number of sounds.

=== The contigency rule ===
Later on, Barbara A. Spellmen from University of Texas describes the performance of humans in determining cause and effects as the contingency rule ΔP, defined as

 P = P(E|C) - P(E|~C)
where P(E|C) is the probability of the effect given the presence of the proposed cause and P(E|~C) is the probability of the effect given the absence of the proposed cause.&lt;ref name ="Spellman"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Spellman | first1 = B. A. | year = 1996 | title = Acting as intuitive scientists: Contingency judgments are made while controlling for alternative potential causes | url = | journal = Psychological Science | volume = 7 | issue = 6| pages = 337–342 | doi =  10.1111/j.1467-9280.1996.tb00385.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suppose we wish to evaluate the performance of a fertilizer. If the plants bloomed 15 out of 20 times when the fertilizer was used, and only 5 out of 20 plants bloomed in the absence of the fertilizer. In this case

     P(E|C) = 15/20 = 0.75
     P(E|~C)=  5/20 = 0.25
     ΔP = P(E|C) - P(E|~C)
     ΔP = 0.75 - 0.25
        = 0.50
The ΔP value as a result is always bound between -1 and 1. Even though the contingency rule is a good model of what humans do in predicting one event causation of another, when it comes to predicting outcomes of events with multiple causes, there exists a large deviation from the contingency rule called the cue-interaction-effect.

===Cue-interaction-effect===
In 1993 Baker Mercer and his team used video games to demonstrate this effect. Each test subject is given the task of helping a tank travel across a mine field using a button that sometimes worked correctly in camouflaging and sometimes did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Baker | first1 = A.G. | last2 = Mercier | first2 = Pierre | last3 = Vallée-Tourangeau | first3 = Frédéric | last4 = Frank | first4 = Robert | last5 = Pan | first5 = Maria | year = 1993 | title = Selective Associations and Causality Judgments: Presence of a Strong Causal Factor May Reduce Judgments of a Weaker One | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0278739302009540 | journal = Journal of Experimental Psychology: Learning, Memory, and Cognition | volume = 19 | issue = 2| pages = 414–432 | doi=10.1037/0278-7393.19.2.414}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a second cause a spotter plane, a friend or an enemy would sometimes fly over the tank. After 40 trials, the test subjects were asked to evaluate the effectiveness of the camouflage and the plane in helping the tank through the minefield. They were asked to give it a number between -100 to 100.
:
Mathematically, there are two contigency values possible for the plane: the plane was either irrelevant to tank's success, then ΔP=0(.5/0 condition) and the plane was relevant to the plane's success, ΔP=1 (.5/1 condition). Even though the ΔP for the camouflage in either condition is 0.5, the test subjects evaluated the ΔP of camouflage to be much higher in the .5/0 condition than in the .5/1 condition. The results are shown in table below.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! Condition !! ΔP&lt;sub&gt;plane&lt;/sub&gt;!!ΔP&lt;sub&gt;camouflage&lt;/sub&gt;!!Camouflage rating given
|-
| 0.5/0|| 0||.5||49
|-
| 0.5/1 || 1||.5||-6
|}
In each case, the test subjects are very good in noticing when two events occur together.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Baker, Robin A. Murphy, Associative and Normative Models of Causal Induction: Reacting to Versus Understanding Cause, In: David R. Shanks, Douglas L. Medin and Keith J. Holyoak, Editor(s), Psychology of Learning and Motivation, Academic Press, 1996, Volume 34, Pages 1-45, ISSN 0079-7421, {{ISBN|978-0-12-543334-1}}, {{doi|10.1016/S0079-7421(08)60557-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the plane is relevant to the camouflage success, they mark the camouflage success high and when the plane doesn't affect the camouflage's success, they mark the camouflage's success value low.

===Gigerenzer contributions===
Several experiments have been performed that shows that ordinary and sometimes skilled people make basic probabilistic [[fallacies]], especially in the case of [[Bayesian inference]] quizzes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Sloman | first1 = S.

(2002). Calculated risks, how to know when numbers deceive you. (p. 310). New York: Simon &amp; Schuster.&lt;/ref&gt;
Gigerenzer argues that the problem with these quizzes is the way the information is presented. During these quizzes the information is presented in percentages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Daston | first1 = L. | last2 = Gigerenzer | first2 = G. | year = 1989 | title = The Problem of Irrationality | url = | journal = Science | volume = 244 | issue = 4908| pages = 1094–1094 | doi=10.1126/science.244.4908.1094}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Reyna | first1 = V.

He argues that evolutionary the brain  physiologically evolved to understand frequency information better than probability information. Thus if the Bayesian quizzes were asked in frequency format, then test subjects would be better at it. Gigerenzer calls this idea the frequency format hypothesis in his published paper titled "The psychology of good judgment: frequency formats and simple algorithms".&lt;ref name ="G" /&gt;

==Supporting arguments==

===Evolutionary perspective===
Gigerenzer argued that from an evolutionary point of view, a frequency method was easier and more communicable compared to conveying information in probability format.&lt;ref name ="G" /&gt; He argues that probability and percentages are rather recent forms of representation as opposed to frequency. The first known existence of a representative form of percentages is in the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;Hacking, I. (1986). The emergence of probability, a philosophical study of early ideas about probability, induction and statistical inference. London: Cambridge Univ Pr.&lt;/ref&gt; He also argues that more information is given in the case of frequency representation. For instance, instead of conveying data as 50 out of 100, using the frequency form, as opposed to saying 50%, using the probability format, gives the users more information about the sample size. This can in turn make the data and results more reliable and more appealing.

===Elaborate encoding===
An explanation given as to why people choose encounter frequency is that in the case of frequencies, the subjects are given vivid descriptions, while with probabilities only a dry number is given to the subject.&lt;ref name ="O"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Obrecht | first1 = N. A. | last2 = Chapman | first2 = G. B. | last3 = Gelman | first3 = R. | year = 2009 | title = An encounter frequency account of how experience affects likelihood estimation | url = | journal = Memory &amp; Cognition | volume = 37 | issue = 5| pages = 632–643 | doi = 10.3758/mc.37.5.632 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, in the case of frequency, subjects are given more [[Recall (memory)|recall]] cues. This could in turn mean that the frequency encounters are remembered by the brain more often than in the case of probability numbers. Thus this might be a reason why people in  general intuitively choose frequency encountered choices rather than probability based choices.

===Sequential input===
Yet another explanation offered by the authors is the fact that in the case of frequency, people often come across them multiple times and have a sequential input, compared to a probability value, which is given in one time.&lt;ref name ="O" /&gt; From [[John Medina]]’s [[Brain Rules]], sequential input can lead to a stronger memory than a onetime input. This can be a primary reason why humans choose frequency encounters over probability.&lt;ref&gt;Medina, J. (2010). Brain rules, 12 principles for surviving and thriving at work, home, and school. Seattle, WA: Pear Pr.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Easier storage===
Another rationale provided in justifying the frequency format hypothesis is that using frequencies makes it easier to keep track and update a database of events. For example, if an event happened 3 out of 6 times, the probability format would store this as 50%, whereas in frequency format it is stored as 3 out of 6. Now imagine that the event does not happen this time. The frequency format can be updated to 3 out of 7. However, for the probability format updating is extremely harder.

===Classifying information===
Frequency representation can also be helpful in keeping track of classes and statistical information. Picture a scenario where every 500 out of 1000 people die due to [[lung cancer]]. However, 40 of those 1000 were smokers and 20 out of the 40 had a genetic condition predisposed to possible lung cancer. Such class division and information storage can only be done using frequency format, since a number .05% probability of having lung cancer does not give any information or allow to calculate such information.

==Refuting arguments==

===Ease of comparison===
Critics of the frequency format hypothesis argue that probability formats allow for much easier comparison than frequency format representation of data. In some cases, using frequency formats actually does allow for easy comparison. If team A wins 19 of its 29 games, and another team B wins 10 of its 29 games, one can clearly see that team A is much better than team B. However comparison in frequency format is not always this clear and easy.If team A won 19 out of its 29 games, comparing this team with team B that won 6 out of its 11 games becomes much harder in frequency format. But, in the probability format, one could say since  65.6%(19/29) is greater than 54.5%, one could much easily compare the two.

===Memory burden===
Tooby and Cosmides had argued that frequency representation helps update data easier each time one gets new data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Cosmides | first1 = L. | last2 = Tooby | first2 = J. | year = 1996 | title = Are humans good intuitive statisticians after all? Rethinking some conclusions from the literature on judgment under uncertainty | url = | journal = Cognition | volume = 58 | issue = | pages = 1–73 | doi=10.1016/0010-0277(95)00664-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this involves updating both numbers. Referring back to the example of teams, if team A won its 31st game, note that both the number of games won(20-&gt;21) and the number of games played(30-&gt;31) has to be updated. In the case of probability the only number to be updated is the single percentage number. Also, this number could be updated over the course of 10 games instead of updating each game, which cannot be done in the case of frequency format.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5074">The expression '''Geneva School''' refers to (1) a group of linguists based in Geneva who pioneered modern [[structuralism|structural linguistics]] and (2) a group of literary theorists and critics working from a [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenological]] perspective.

==Geneva School of Linguistics==
The most prominent figure of the Geneva School of Linguistics school was [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]. Other important colleagues and students of Saussure who comprise this school include [[Albert Sechehaye]], [[Albert Riedlinger]], [[Serge Karcevski]] and [[Charles Bally]].

The most significant linguistic book connected with this school is ''[[Course in General Linguistics|Cours de linguistique générale]]'', the main work of de Saussure, which was published by his students Charles Bally and Albert Sehechaye. The book was based on lectures with this title that de Saussure gave three times in Geneva from 1906 to 1912. Sehechaye and Bally did not themselves take part in these lecture classes, but they used notes from other students.  The most important of these students was Albert Riedlinger, who provided them with the most material. Furthermore, Bally and Sehechaye continued to develop de Saussure's theories, mainly focusing on the linguistic research of speech. Sehechaye also concentrated on syntactic problems.

===Charles Bally===
In addition to his edition of de Saussure's lectures, Charles Bally also played an important role in linguistics. He lived from 1865 to 1947 and was, like de Saussure, from Switzerland. His parent were Jean Gabriel, a teacher and Henriette, the owner of a cloth store. Bally was married three times: first with Valentine Leirens, followed by Irma Baptistine Doutre, who was sent into a mental institution in 1915 and Alice Bellicot.

From 1883 to 1885 he studied classic language and literature in Geneva. He continued his studies from 1886 to 1889 in Berlin where he was awarded a PhD. After his studies he worked as a private teacher for the royal family of Greece from 1889 to 1893. Bally returned to Geneva and taught at a business school from 1893 on and moved to the Progymnasium, a grammar school, from 1913 to 1939. At the same time, he worked as PD at the university from 1893 to 1913.  Finally from 1913 to 1939 he had a professorship for general linguistic and comparative Indo-German studies which he took over from Ferdinand de Saussure.

Besides his works about subjectivity in the [[French Language]] he also wrote about the crisis in French language and language classes.
Today Charles Bally is regarded as the founding-father of linguistic theories of style and much honored for his theories of [[phraseology]].

Works by Charles Bally:
*''Traité de stylistique française'', 1909
*''Le Langage et la Vie'', 1913
*''Linguistique générale et linguistique française'', 1932

==Geneva School of Literary Criticism==
The expression "Geneva School" ({{lang-fr|groupe de Genève}}) is also applied to a group of literary critics in the 1950s and 1960s, of which the most important were the Belgian critic [[Georges Poulet]], the French critic [[Jean-Pierre Richard]], and the Swiss critics [[Marcel Raymond]], [[Albert Béguin]], [[Jean Rousset]] and [[Jean Starobinski]].  The critics [[Emil Staiger]], [[Gaston Bachelard]], and [[J. Hillis Miller]] are also sometimes associated with this group.

Growing out of [[Russian Formalism]] and [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] (such as in the work of [[Edmund Husserl]]), the "Geneva School" used the phenomenological method to attempt to analyse works of literature as representations of deep structures of an author's consciousness and his or her relationship to the real world.  Biographical criticism was however avoided, as these critics focused primarily on the work of art itself &amp;ndash; treated as an organic whole and considered a subjective interpretation of reality (the German concept of ''[[Lebenswelt]]'') &amp;ndash; and sought out the recurrent themes and images, especially those concerning time and space and the interactions between the self and others.&lt;ref&gt;For this section, see Eagleton 1983, pp. 58–60.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gulf Arabic can be defined as a set of closely related and more or less mutually intelligible varieties that form a [[dialect continuum]], with the level of mutual intelligibility between any two varieties largely depending on the distance between them. Similarly to other [[Arabic#Dialects and descendants|Arabic varieties]], Gulf Arabic varieties are not completely mutually intelligible with other [[Arabic varieties]] spoken outside the Gulf.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarus|first=Hamdi A. Qafisheh ; in consultation with Ernest N.|title=A short reference grammar of Gulf Arabic|year=1977|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson, Ariz.|isbn=0-8165-0570-5|page=xvii|chapter=Introduction}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific dialects differ in [[vocabulary]], grammar and [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accent]].&lt;ref name=di&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bJLjAKH7-rIC|title=Dialect, Culture, and Society in Eastern Arabia: Glossary|work=Clive Holes|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are considerable differences between, for instance, [[Kuwaiti Arabic]] and the dialects of Qatar and the UAE—especially in accent, that may hinder mutual intelligibility.&lt;ref name=di /&gt;

Gulf varieties' closest related relatives are other dialects native to the [[Arabian Peninsula]], i.e. [[Najdi Arabic]] and [[Bahrani Arabic]].&lt;ref name=ksa /&gt;&lt;ref name=per /&gt; Although spoken over much of Saudi Arabia's area, Gulf Arabic is not the native tongue of most Saudis, as the majority of them do not live in [[Eastern Arabia]].&lt;ref name=di /&gt; There are some 200,000 Gulf Arabic speakers in the country, out of a population of over 30 million, mostly in the aforementioned Eastern Province.&lt;ref name=ksa&gt;{{cite web |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sl_dDVctycgC&amp;pg=RA3-PA38&amp;d&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=TOzdUePFGYzLtAaZmYGwBg&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |title=International Encyclopedia of Linguistics, Volume 1 |work= William Frawley |date=2003 |pages=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=per&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/country/sa/languages Languages of Saudi Arabia] ''[[Ethnologue]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ksa /&gt;&lt;ref name=per /&gt;

The dialect's full name ''{{transl|afb|el-lahja el-Khalijiyya}}'' ({{lang|afb|اللهجة الخليجية}} &lt;small&gt;local pronunciation:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-ar|elˈlɑhdʒɐ lχɐˈliːdʒɪj.jɐ|}}) can be translated as 'the dialect of the gulf'. However, it is most commonly referred to as Khaliji ({{lang|afb|خليجي}} ''{{transl|afb|Khalījī}}'' {{IPA-ar|χɐˈliːdʒi|}}), in which the noun {{lang|afb|خليج}} ({{IPA-ar|χɐˈliːdʒ|}}; ''{{transl|afb|Khalīj}}'') has been suffixed with the [[Arabic nouns and adjectives#Nisba|Nisba]], literally meaning 'of the bay' or 'of the gulf'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Arabic-English by N.

Phonetic notes:
* The non-native Arabic letter {{IPA|/p/}} {{angbr|{{lang|afb|پ}}}}, or its native counterpart {{IPA|/b/}} {{angbr|{{lang|afb|ب}}}}, is used to denote that sound which occurs only in loanwords, e.g.: piyāḷah ({{lang|afb|پيالة}} or {{lang|afb|بيالة}} {{IPA-ar|pijɑːɫɑh|}}, 'small glass'), from [[Hindi]].
* {{IPA|/dˤ/}} {{angbr|{{lang|afb|ض}}}} has merged to {{IPA|/ðˤ/}} {{angbr|{{lang|afb|ظ}}}}.
* The difference between {{IPA|/l/}} and {{IPA|/ɫ/}} is not orthographically shown.
* The classicized {{IPA|[q]}} is an allophone for {{IPA|/g/}} {{angbr|{{lang|afb|ق}}}} , used in [[Modern Standard Arabic|Literary Arabic]] loanwords, and also an allophone for {{IPA|/ɣ/}}  {{angbr|{{lang|afb|غ}}}}.
* The stops /b/, /d/, and /g/ are described as fully voiced despite their position within the word.

Qafisheh stipulates at least two qualities of {{IPA|/a/}}: {{Quote|text=''a''  has a low back quality in the environment of pharyngealized consonants and frequently before or after {{IPA|/q/}}. This sound is similar to the ''a'' sound in ''father'' but shorter and farther back. (...) Before or after the pharyngeals ''9'' [= ʿAyin] and ''H'' [= ḥ], or any other plain consonant, ''a'' is farther front than the ''a'' in ''father''; its quality ranges between the ''e'' in ''pen'' and the ''a'' in ''pan''.|sign=Hamdi A. Qafisheh|source=A Short Reference Grammar of Gulf Arabic, p. 16}} He further explains that these qualities also apply to {{IPA|/aː/}}, so that {{IPA|[ɑ(ː)]}}⁓{{IPA|[ä(ː)]}}⁓{{IPA|[æ(ː)]}} can therefore be assumed.

=== Pronouns ===
==== Personal pronouns ====
Gulf Arabic has 10 [[personal pronoun]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McCarus|first=Hamdi A. Qafisheh ; in consultation with Ernest N.|title=A short reference grammar of Gulf Arabic|year=1977|publisher=University of Arizona Press|location=Tucson, Ariz.|isbn=0-8165-0570-5|page=159|chapter=Pronouns}}&lt;/ref&gt; The conservative dialect has preserved the gender differentiation of the 2nd and 3rd person in the plural forms, whereas dual forms have not survived. The following table bears the generally most common pronouns:

{{refbegin}}
* {{note|1|1}} Many speakers do not distinguish between masculine and feminine forms in the second person plural, replacing ''intum'' and ''intin'' with '''''intu''''' ({{lang|afb|إنْتُ}}).
* {{note|2|2}} Speakers that do not distinguish between masculine and feminine forms in the third person plural will also use '''''hum''''' ({{lang|afb|هُمْ}}) for both genders in the third person plural, respectively.

Some pronouns, however, have other (less frequent, resp. local) forms:
* '''''ānā''''' ({{lang|afb|آنَا}}):

'''Heteronormativity''' is the belief that people fall into distinct and complementary [[gender]]s ([[male]] and [[female]]) with [[Essentialism#Essentialism and society and politics|natural roles in life]]. It assumes that [[heterosexuality]] is the [[Norm (social)|norm]] or default [[sexual orientation]],&lt;ref name="Harris"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors =Harris J, White V|title =A Dictionary of Social Work and Social Care|isbn = 0192516868|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2018|accessdate=August 19, 2018|page=335|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M3FGDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT335}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that sexual and marital relations are most (or only) fitting between people of opposite sex. A "heteronormative" view therefore involves alignment of biological [[sex]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[gender identity]] and [[gender role]]s. Heteronormativity is often linked to [[heterosexism]] and [[homophobia]].&lt;ref name="Harris"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gorski"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors =Goodman RD, Gorski PC|title =Decolonizing "Multicultural" Counseling through Social Justice|isbn = 1493912836|publisher=[[Springer Publishing|Springer]]|year=2014|accessdate=August 19, 2018|pages=28–30|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MeYlBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin of the term==
[[Michael Warner]] popularized the term in 1991,&lt;ref name="warner1991"&gt;Warner, Michael (1991), "Introduction: Fear of a Queer Planet". ''Social Text''; 9 (4 [29]): 3–17&lt;/ref&gt; in one of the first major works of [[queer theory]].  The concept's roots are in [[Gayle Rubin]]'s notion of the "sex/gender system" and [[Adrienne Rich]]'s notion of [[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence|compulsory heterosexuality]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Adrienne Rich]], 'Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence' ''Signs: Journal of Women in Culture and Society'', 5:631-60, 1980.&lt;/ref&gt; From the outset, theories of heteronormativity included a critical look at [[gender]]; Warner wrote that "every person who comes to a queer self-understanding knows in one way or another that her stigmatization is intricated with gender. [...] Being queer [...] means being able, more or less articulately, to challenge the common understanding of what gender difference means."&lt;ref name="warner1991"/&gt;

In a series of articles, Samuel A. Chambers calls for an understanding of heteronormativity as a concept that reveals the expectations, demands, and constraints produced when heterosexuality is taken as normative within a society.&lt;ref&gt;Samuel A. Chambers, "Telepistemology of the Closet; Or, the Queer Politics of ''Six Feet Under''". ''Journal of American Culture'' 26.1: 24–41, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Samuel A. Chambers, "Revisiting the Closet: Reading Sexuality in ''Six Feet Under'', in ''Reading Six Feet Under''. McCabe and Akass, eds. IB Taurus, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination==
Critics of heteronormative attitudes, such as [[Cathy J. Cohen]], [[Michael Warner]], and [[Lauren Berlant]], argue that they are oppressive, stigmatizing, marginalizing of perceived deviant forms of sexuality and gender, and make self-expression more challenging when that expression does not conform to the norm.&lt;ref name=lovaas&gt;Lovaas, Karen, and Mercilee M. Jenkins. [https://books.google.com/books?id=fTRcvkxWV-IC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage "Charting a Path through the 'Desert of Nothing.'"] Sexualities and Communication in Everyday Life: A Reader. 8 July 2006. Sage Publications Inc. 5 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=August 2018}}&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt; Heteronormativity describes how social institutions and policies reinforce the presumption that people are heterosexual and that gender and sex are natural binaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Gender in Communication|last = DeFrancisco|first = Victoria|publisher = SAGE Publication, Inc.|year = 2014|isbn = 978-1-4522-2009-3|location = U.S.A|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heteronormative culture privileges heterosexuality as normal and natural and fosters a climate where LGBT individuals are discriminated against in marriage, tax codes, and employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.rutgersuniversitypress.org/violence-against-queer-people/9780813573151|title=Violence against Queer People|last=Meyer|first=Doug|publisher=Rutgers University Press|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OutatWork&gt;{{cite book|last=Krupat|first=Kitty|title=Out at Work: Building a Gay-Labor Alliance|year=2001|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=0-8166-3741-5|pages=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Berlant and Warner, Laurie and Stark also argue that the domestic "intimate sphere" becomes "the unquestioned non-‐place that anchors heteronormative public discourses, especially those concerning marriage and adoption rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Reconsidering Kinship: Beyond the Nuclear Family With Deleuze and Guattari | first1= Timothy | last1= Laurie | first2= Hannah | last2= Stark | journal=Cultural Studies Review | volume= 18 | issue= 1 | pages= 19–39 | year= 2012 | url= https://www.academia.edu/2137674 | doi=10.5130/csr.v18i1.1612}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against gay, lesbian, bisexual, and transgender individuals===
According to cultural anthropologist [[Gayle Rubin]], heteronormativity in mainstream society creates a "sex hierarchy" that graduates sexual practices from morally "good sex" to "bad sex." The hierarchy places reproductive, monogamous sex between committed heterosexuals as "good" and places any sexual acts and individuals who fall short of this standard lower until they fall into "bad sex." Specifically, this places long-term committed gay couples and promiscuous gays in between the two poles.&lt;ref name="thinkingsex"&gt;Rubin, Gayle. ''Thinking Sex: Notes for a Radical Theory of the Politics of Sexuality'', in Vance, Carole. ''Pleasure and Danger: Exploring Female Sexuality'' (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; Patrick McCreery, lecturer at [[New York University]], views this hierarchy as partially explanatory for the stigmatization of gay people for socially "deviant" sexual practices that are often practiced by straight people as well, such as consumption of pornography or sex in public places.&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt; There are many studies of sexual orientation discrimination on college campuses.&lt;ref&gt;Byron, Reginald; Lowe, Maria; Billingsley, Brianna, Tuttle, Nathan (2017). "Performativity Double Standards and the Sexual Orientation Climate at a Southern Liberal Arts University."  Journal of Homosexuality 64(5): 671-696. https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/00918369.2016.1196994&lt;/ref&gt;

McCreery states that this heteronormative hierarchy carries over to the workplace, where gay, lesbian and bisexual individuals face discrimination such as anti-homosexual hiring policies or workplace discrimination that often leaves "lowest hierarchy" individuals such as transsexual people vulnerable to the most overt discrimination and unable to find work.&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt;

Applicants and current employees can be legally passed over or fired for being non-heterosexual or ''perceived'' as non-heterosexual in many countries, such as the case with chain restaurant [[Cracker Barrel]], which [[Cracker Barrel#Policy toward sexual orientation|garnered national attention in 1991]] after they fired an employee for being openly lesbian, citing their policy that employees with "sexual preferences that fail to demonstrate normal heterosexual values were inconsistent with traditional American values." Workers such as the fired employee and others, such as effeminate male waiters (allegedly described as the true targets),&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt; were legally fired by work policies "transgressing" against "normal" heteronormative culture.&lt;ref name="OutatWork"/&gt;

Analysing the interconnectivity of heteronormativity and sexual employment discrimination, Mustafa Bilgehan Ozturk traces the impact of patriarchal practices and institutions on the workplace experiences of lesbian, gay and bisexual employees in a variety of contexts in Turkey, demonstrating further the specific historicities and localised power/knowledge formations that give rise to physical, professional and psycho-emotive acts of prejudice against sexual minorities.&lt;ref name="SexualOrientationDiscrimination"&gt;Ozturk, Mustafa Bilgehan. "Sexual Orientation Discrimination: Exploring the Experiences of Lesbian, Gay and Bisexual Employees in Turkey, Human Relations, August 2011, 64(8), 1099-1118&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relation to marriage and the nuclear family==
Modern family structures in the past and present vary from what was typical of the 1950s [[nuclear family]].  The families of the second half of the 19th century and early 20th century in the United States were characterized by the death of one or both parents for many American children.&lt;ref name="Coontz"&gt;Coontz, S. (1992)&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the United States is estimated to have been home to approximately 2.5 million post-divorce, [[stepfamily]] households containing children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Coleman | first1 = M. | last2 = Ganong | first2 = L. H. | last3 = Goodwin | first3 = C. | year = 1994 | title = The presentation of stepfamilies in marriage and family textbooks:  A reexamination | url = | journal = [[Family Relations (journal)|Family Relations]] | volume = 45 | issue = | pages = 289–297 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the late 80s, almost 20% of families with children headed by a married couple were [[stepfamilies]].&lt;ref&gt;Coleman, Ganong, &amp; Goodwin, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the past three decades rates of divorce, single parenting, and [[cohabitation]] have risen precipitously.&lt;ref name="Benfer"&gt;Benfer, Amy. [http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2001/06/07/family_values/index.html The Nuclear Family Takes a Hit] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080522052539/http://archive.salon.com/mwt/feature/2001/06/07/family_values/index.html |date=2008-05-22 }}, Salon.com.  June 7, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; Nontraditional families (which diverge from "a middle-class family with a bread-winning father and a stay-at-home mother, married to each other and raising their biological children") constitute the majority of families in the [[United States]] today.&lt;ref name="Benfer"/&gt; [[Shared Earning/Shared Parenting Marriage]] (also known as Peer Marriage) where two heterosexual parents are both providers of resources and nurturers to children has become popular.  Modern families may also have single-parent headed families caused by divorce, separation or death, families who have two parents who are not married but have children, or families with same-sex parents. With [[artificial insemination]], [[surrogate mother]]s, and [[adoption]], families do not have to be formed by the heteronormative biological union of a male and a female.

The consequences of these changes for the adults and children involved are heavily debated. In a 2009 [[Massachusetts]] spousal benefits case, developmental psychologist [[Michael Lamb (psychologist)|Michael Lamb]] testified that parental sexual orientation does not negatively affect childhood development. "Since the end of the 1980s... it has been well established that children and adolescents can adjust just as well in nontraditional settings as in traditional settings," he argued.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Lamb, Ph.D.: [http://www.glad.org/uploads/docs/cases/2009-11-17-doma-aff-lamb.pdf Affidavit – United States District Court for the District of Massachusetts (2009)]{{dead link|date=April 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, columnist [[Maggie Gallagher]] argues that heteronormative social structures are beneficial to society because they are optimal for the raising of children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.marriagedebate.com/pdf/SenateSept42003.pdf |title=Why Marriage Matters: The Case for Normal Marriage. Testimony before the U.S. Senate Subcommittee on the Constitution, Civil Rights, and Property Rights Hearing: "What is needed to defend the Bipartisan Defense of Marriage Act of 1996?" |author=Maggie Gallagher |publisher=Institute for Marriage and Public Policy |date=2003-09-04 |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Australian-Canadian ethicist [[Margaret Somerville]] argues that "giving same-sex couples the right to found a family unlinks parenthood from biology".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unisa.edu.au/hawkecentre/events/2007events/MSomerville_InConversation.asp Margaret Somerville – In Conversation] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205100541/http://www.unisa.edu.au/hawkecentre/events/2007events/MSomerville_InConversation.asp |date=2008-12-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent criticisms of this argument have been made by Timothy Laurie, who argues that both [[intersex]] conditions and [[infertility]] rates have always complicated links between biology, marriage and child-rearing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title= Bigotry or Biology: The Hard Choice for an Opponent of Marriage Equality | first= Timothy | last= Laurie | newspaper= The Drum | year= 2015 | url= https://www.academia.edu/12765552}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A subset of heteronormativity is the concept of heteronormative temporality. This ideology states that the ultimate life goal for society is heterosexual marriage. Societal factors influence adults to search for a partner of the opposite sex to engage in heterosexual marriage with the goal of having children through the traditional nuclear family structure. Heteronormative temporality promotes [[abstinence]] only until marriage. Many American parents adhere to this heteronormative narrative, and teach their children accordingly. According to  Amy T. Schalet, it seems that the bulk of parent-child sex education revolves around [[Abstinence-only sex education|abstinence only]] practices in the United States, but this differs in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Schalet, Amy T. Not under My Roof: Parents, Teens, and the Culture of Sex. Chicago: U of Chicago, 2011. {{ISBN|9780226736181}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, George Washington University Professor Abby Wilkerson discusses the ways in which the healthcare and medicinal industries reinforce the views of heterosexual marriage in order to promote heteronormative temporality. The concept of heteronormative temporality extends beyond heterosexual marriage to include a pervasive system where heterosexuality is seen as a standard, and anything outside of that realm is not tolerated. Wilkerson explains that it dictates aspects of everyday life such as nutritional health, socio-economic status, personal beliefs, and traditional gender roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wilkerson | first1 = Abby | year = 2013| title = I want to hold your hand: abstinence curricula, bioethics, and the silencing of desire | url = | journal = [[Journal of Medical Humanities]] | volume =  34| issue = | pages =  101–8| pmid = 23468394 | doi=10.1007/s10912-013-9213-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some transgender people seek [[sex reassignment therapy]], and may not behave according to the gender role imposed by society. Some societies consider transgender behavior a crime worthy of capital punishment, including [[Saudi Arabia]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifge.org/news/1998/sept/nws9278.htm Saudis Arrest 5 Pakistani TGs]&lt;/ref&gt; and many other nations. In some cases, gay or lesbian people were forced to undergo sex change treatments to "fix" their sex or gender: in some [[Europe|European countries]] during the 20th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2660/ The Unkindest Cut | The science and ethics of castration]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/turing_a,2.html Turing, Alan (1912–1954)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090901020647/http://www.glbtq.com/social-sciences/turing_a%2C2.html |date=2009-09-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[South Africa]] in the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2000/jul/29/chrismcgreal Gays tell of mutilation by apartheid army]&lt;/ref&gt;

In medical communities with these restrictions, patients have the option of either suppressing transsexual behavior and conforming to the norms of their birth sex (which may be necessary to avoid social stigma or even violence) or by adhering strictly to the norms of their "new" sex in order to qualify for sex reassignment surgery and hormonal treatments.

Some governments and official agencies have also been criticized{{By whom|date=May 2010}} as having heteronormative systems that classify people into "male" and "female" genders in problematic ways.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}} Different jurisdictions use different definitions of gender, including by genitalia, DNA, hormone levels (including some official sports bodies), or birth sex (which means one's gender cannot ever be officially changed).--&gt;

According to Penny Griffin, Politics and International Relations lecturer at the [[University of New South Wales]], homonormativity upholds [[neoliberalism]] rather than critiquing [[monogamy]], procreation, and [[Gender binary|binary gender roles]] as inherently [[heterosexist]] and [[racist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Griffin | first1 = Penny | year = 2007 | title = Sexing the Economy in a Neo-liberal World Order: Neo-liberal Discourse and the (Re)Production of Heteronormative Heterosexuality | url = | journal = British Journal of Politics and International Relations | volume = 9 | issue = 2| pages = 220–238 | doi=10.1111/j.1467-856x.2007.00280.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this sense, homonormativity is deeply intertwined with the expansion and  maintenance of the internationally structured and structuring capitalistic worldwide system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stryker|first=Susan|year=2008|title=Transgender History, Homonormativity, and Disciplinarity|url=|journal=Radical Review History|volume=Issue 100|pages=145|via=Radical History Review}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duggan asserts that homonormativity fragments LGBT communities into hierarchies of worthiness, and that LGBT people that come the closest to mimicking heteronormative standards of gender identity are deemed most worthy of receiving rights. She also states that LGBT individuals at the bottom of this hierarchy (e.g. [[Bisexual community|bisexual people]], [[Transgender|trans people]], [[Genderqueer|non-binary people]], people of [[Gender systems#Non-European gender systems|non-Western genders]], [[intersex]] people, queers of color, queer sex workers) are seen as an impediment to this class of homonormative individuals receiving their rights.&lt;ref name="Duggan, Lisa 2003" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ferguson, Roderick A.

Print. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://read.dukeupress.edu/content/black-queer-studies&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; For example, one empirical study found that in the Netherlands, transgender people and other gender non-conforming LGBT people are often looked down upon within their communities for not acting "normal." Those who do assimilate often become invisible in society and experience constant fear and shame about the non-conformers within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Robinson | first1 = Brandon Andrew | year = 2012 | title = Is This What Equality Looks Like?: How Assimilation Marginalizes the Dutch LGBT Community | url = | journal = Sexuality Research &amp; Social Policy | volume = 9 | issue = 4| pages = 327–336 | doi = 10.1007/s13178-012-0084-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stryker referenced theorist [[Jürgen Habermas]] and his view of the public sphere allowing for individuals to come together, as a group, to discuss diverse ideologies and by excluding the non-conforming LGBTQ community, society as a whole were undoubtedly excluding the gender-variant individuals from civic participation.&lt;ref name="eds.a.ebscohost.com"/&gt;

== Media representation ==
Five different studies have shown that gay characters appearing on TV decreases the prejudice among viewers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/05/09/business/media/gay-on-tv-its-all-in-the-family.html|title=Gay on TV: It’s All in the Family|last=Stelter|first=Brian|date=2012-05-08|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable and streaming services are beginning to include more characters who are lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender than broadcast television.&lt;ref name="Egner"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/10/28/arts/television/more-gay-and-transgender-characters-are-on-tv-report-shows.html|title=More Gay and Transgender Characters Are on TV, Report Shows|last=Egner|first=Jeremy|date=2015-10-27|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cable and streaming services are lacking in diversity, according to a [[GLAAD]] report, with many of the LGBT characters being gay men (41% and 39% respectively).&lt;ref name="Egner"/&gt; The total number of LGBT characters counted on cable was reported to be 31% up from 2015, and bisexual representations saw an almost twofold increase.&lt;ref name="Egner" /&gt;

Intersex people are excluded almost completely from television, though about 1% of the population is intersex.&lt;ref name="Kerry, Stephen 2011"&gt;Kerry, Stephen (2011), ‘Representation of intersex in news media: the case of Kathleen Worrall’, ''Journal of Gender Studies,'' 20 (3), 263-77.&lt;/ref&gt; News medias outline what it means to be male or female, which causes a gap for anyone who doesn't fall into those two categories.&lt;ref name="Kerry, Stephen 2011"/&gt; Newspapers have covered the topic of intersex athletes with the case of [[Caster Semenya]], where news spread on sporting officials having to determine whether she was to be considered female or male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://edition.cnn.com/2009/HEALTH/08/20/gender.athlete.intersex/|title=Gender row athlete: What is intersexuality?  - CNN.com|last=CNN|first=By  Stephanie Busari|website=edition.cnn.com|access-date=2016-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In today's media, specifically television, heterosexual character are used more often than homosexual characters.  In 2018 only 8.8% of broadcast television has a LGBTQ person on the show&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=GLAAD|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.4135/9781483371283.n173|work=The SAGE Encyclopedia of LGBTQ Studies|publisher=SAGE Publications, Inc.|isbn=9781483371306|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

There are many stereotypes that come with this, as it can be seen in advertising, newspapers, radio, and television.  For example, mainstream media promote the idea that gay men are more likely to be attracted to advertisements that sell expensive, flamboyant, and possibly feminine products because of their assumed attitudes and way of life&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kates|first=Steven M.|date=March 1999|title=Making the Ad Perfectly Queer: Marketing “Normality” to the Gay Men's Community?|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1080/00913367.1999.10673574|journal=Journal of Advertising|volume=28|issue=1|pages=25–37|doi=10.1080/00913367.1999.10673574|issn=0091-3367}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Homosexuals and heterosexuals are also differentiated in the movies as well. Homosexual characters are predominantly seen in movies with issues regarding sexuality and the character is presented as homosexual&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2009-08-01|title=America on film: representing race, class, gender, and sexuality at the movies|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5860/choice.46-6690|journal=Choice Reviews Online|volume=46|issue=12|pages=46–6690-46-6690|doi=10.5860/choice.46-6690|issn=0009-4978}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Television shows are also another aspect of media where there are stereotypes and negatively represented homosexuals.  For example, the TV show Modern Family has two gay characters that are married and have a small adopted child together.  Some may see this relationship as degrading and stereotypical of how the mainstream media views homosexuals.  The show's sexual politics are considered fake because of how their relationship is portrayed as overly colorful and excessively put together&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=PUGH|first=TISON|title=Conservative Narratology, Queer Politics, and the Humor of Gay Stereotypes in Modern Family|date=2018|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/j.ctt1trkkgj.9|work=The Queer Fantasies of the American Family Sitcom|pages=161–189|publisher=Rutgers University Press|doi=10.2307/j.ctt1trkkgj.9|isbn=9780813591728|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Relations of abstract ideas align on one side (necessary, ''a priori'', analytic), whereas concrete truths align on the other (contingent, ''a posteriori'', synthetic).&lt;ref name=Flew/&gt;

The "necessary" is generally true in all [[possible world]]s—usually by mere logical [[Validity (logic)|validity]]—whereas the "contingent" hinges on the way the real world is.  The ''a priori'' is knowable before or without, whereas the ''a posteriori'' is knowable only after or through, experience in an area of interest. The "analytic" is a statement true by virtue of its terms' meanings, and therefore a [[tautology (logic)|tautology]]—necessarily true but uninformative—whereas the "synthetic" is true by its terms' [[semantics|meanings]] in relation to a state of facts. In other words, analytic propositions are true by virtue of their meaning, while synthetic propositions are true by how their meaning relates to the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rey|first=Georges|title=The Analytic/Synthetic Distinction|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Winter 2010 Edition)|accessdate=February 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philosophers have used the terms differently, and there is debate over whether there is a legitimate distinction. 

==History&lt;!--'Kant's pitchfork' redirects here--&gt;==
Hume's strong [[empiricism]], as in Hume's fork as well as Hume's [[problem of induction]], was taken as a threat to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s theory of motion.  [[Immanuel Kant]] responded with [[rationalism]] in his 1781 ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', where Kant attributed to the mind a causal role in sensory experience by the mind's aligning the environmental input by arranging those [[sense data]] into the experience of space and time.  Kant thus reasoned existence of the synthetic ''a priori''—combining meanings of terms with states of facts, yet known true without experience of the particular instance—replacing the two prongs of Hume's fork with a three-pronged-fork thesis ('''Kant's pitchfork'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;)&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant and the Foundations of Analytic Philosophy''. Clarendon Press, 2004. p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; and thus saving [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]].

[[Solar eclipse of May 29, 1919|In 1919]], Newton's theory fell to Einstein's [[general theory of relativity]]. In the late 1920s, the [[logical positivism|logical positivists]] rejected Kant's synthetic ''a priori'' and asserted Hume's fork, so called, while hinging it at language—the analytic/synthetic division—while presuming that by holding to analyticity, they could develop a [[logical syntax]] entailing, as a consequence of Hume's fork, both necessity and aprioricity, thus restricting science to claims [[verificationism|verifiable]] as either [[truth value|false or true]].  In the early 1950s, [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] undermined the analytic/synthetic division by explicating [[ontological relativity]], as every term in any statement has its meaning contingent on a vast network of knowledge and belief, the speaker's conception of the entire world.  By the early 1970s, [[Saul Kripke]] established the necessary ''a posteriori'', since if the [[Venus|Morning Star]] and the [[Venus|Evening Star]] are the same star, they are the same star by necessity, but this is known true by a human only through relevant experience.

Hume's fork remains basic in Anglo-American philosophy.  Many deceptions and confusions are foisted by surreptitious or unwitting conversion of a synthetic claim to an analytic claim, rendered true by necessity but merely a tautology, for instance the [[No true Scotsman|''No true Scotsman'' move]].  Simply put, Hume's fork has limitations. Related concerns are Hume's distinction of demonstrative versus probable reasoning&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin &amp; Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork".  ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''.  Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Garrett Thomson, ''Bacon to Kant: An Introduction to Modern Philosophy'', 2nd Edition, p 218.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Hume's law]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicholas Bunnin and Jiyuan Yu. "Hume's Fork". ''Blackwell's Dictionary of Western Philosophy''. Blackwell, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Hume makes other, important two-category distinctions, such as [[David Hume#Practical reason|beliefs versus desires]] and as impressions versus ideas.&lt;ref&gt;''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section II.)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relations of ideas and matters of fact==

The first distinction is between two different areas of human study:

:All the objects of human reason or enquiry may naturally be divided into two kinds, to wit, ''relations of ideas'', and ''matters of fact''. Of the first kind are the sciences of [[Geometry]], [[Algebra]], and [[Arithmetic]] ...'' [which are] ''discoverable by the mere operation of thought ... Matters of fact, which are the second object of human reason, are not ascertained in the same manner; nor is our evidence of their truth, however great, of a like nature with the foregoing.
::: — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''&lt;ref&gt; ''Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding'', Section IV, Part I.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume's fork is often stated in such a way that statements are divided up into two types:

* Statements about ideas. These are [[Analytic-synthetic distinction|analytic]], [[Modal logic|necessary]], and [[knowledge|knowable]] ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''.
* Statements about the world. These are synthetic, [[Contingency (philosophy)|contingent]], and knowable ''[[Empirical evidence|a posteriori]]''.

In modern terminology, members of the first group are known as [[analytic proposition]]s and members of the latter as [[synthetic proposition]]s. This terminology comes from [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] (Introduction to ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', Section IV).

Into the first class fall statements such as ''"all bodies are extended"'', ''"all bachelors are unmarried"'', and truths of mathematics and logic. Into the second class fall statements like ''"the sun rises in the morning"'', and ''"all bodies have mass"''.

Hume wants to prove that [[certainty]] does not exist in science.  First, Hume notes that statements of the second type can never be entirely certain, due to the fallibility of our senses, the possibility of deception (see e.g. the modern [[brain in a vat]] theory) and other arguments made by philosophical skeptics. It is always logically possible that any given statement about the world is false.

Second, Hume claims that our belief in cause-and-effect relationships between events is not grounded on reason, but rather arises merely by habit or custom. Suppose one states: "Whenever someone on earth lets go of a stone it falls." While we can grant that in every instance thus far when a rock was dropped on Earth it went down, this does not make it logically necessary that in the future rocks will fall when in the same circumstances. Things of this nature rely upon the future conforming to the same principles which governed the past. But that isn't something that we can know based on past experience—all past experience could tell us is that in the past, the future has resembled the past.

Third, Hume notes that relations of ideas can be used only to prove other relations of ideas, and mean nothing outside of the context of how they relate to each other, and therefore tell us nothing about the world. Take the statement "An equilateral triangle has three sides of equal length." While some earlier philosophers (most notably [[Plato]] and [[Descartes]]) held that logical statements such as these contained the most formal reality, since they are always true and unchanging, Hume held that, while true, they contain no formal reality, because the truth of the statements rests on the definitions of the words involved, and not on actual things in the world, since there is no such thing as a true triangle or exact equality of length in the world. So for this reason, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact.

The results claimed by Hume as consequences of his fork are drastic. According to him, relations of ideas can be proved with certainty (by using other relations of ideas), however, they don't really mean anything about the world. Since they don't mean anything about the world, relations of ideas cannot be used to prove matters of fact. Because of this, matters of fact have no certainty and therefore cannot be used to prove anything. Only certain things can be used to prove other things for certain, but only things about the world can be used to prove other things about the world. But since we can't cross the fork, nothing is both certain and about the world, only one or the other, and so it is impossible to prove something about the world with certainty.

If accepted, Hume's fork makes it pointless to try to prove the [[existence of God]] (for example) as a matter of fact. If God is not literally made up of physical matter, and does not have an observable effect on the world, making a statement about God is not a matter of fact. Therefore, a statement about God must be a relation of ideas. In this case if we prove the statement "God exists," it doesn't really tell us anything about the world; it is just playing with words. It is easy to see how Hume's fork voids the causal argument and the [[ontological argument]] for the existence of a non-observable God. However, this does not mean that the validity of Hume's fork would imply that God definitely does not exist, only that it would imply that the existence of God cannot be proven as a matter of fact without worldly evidence. 

Hume rejected the idea of any meaningful statement that did not fall into this schema, saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
If we take in our hand any volume; of [[divinity]] or school [[metaphysics]], for instance; let us ask, Does it contain any abstract reasoning concerning quantity or number? No. Does it contain any experimental reasoning concerning matter of fact and existence? No. Commit it then to the flames: for it can contain nothing but [[sophistry]] and illusion.{{sfn|Hume|1777|p=166|ps=, emphasis removed}} — ''[[An Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding]]''

'''Martin Schleyer''' ({{IPA-de|joˈhan ˈmartiːn ˈʃlaɪ̯ər|lang}}; 18 July 1831&amp;nbsp;– 16 August 1912) was a [[Germany|German]] [[Catholicism|Catholic]] [[Priesthood (Catholic Church)|priest]] who invented the [[constructed language]] [[Volapük]]. His official name was "Martin Schleyer"; he added the name "Johann" (in honor of his godfather) unofficially.

==Life and work==
Schleyer was born in [[Lauda-Königshofen|Oberlauda]] ([[Baden]]). According to his own report, the idea of an international [[language]] arose out of a conversation he had with one of his [[parish]]ioners, a semi-literate German [[peasant]] whose son had emigrated to [[United States|America]] and could no longer be reached by [[mail]] because the [[United States Postal Service]] could not read the father's [[handwriting]].

He was ordained in 1856. From 1867 to 1875 he was pastor at Krumbach near [[Meßkirch]]. At the end of this time he was jailed for four months for preaching against [[socialism]] during the [[Kulturkampf]].

From 1875 to 1885 he was pastor of Ss. Peter and Paul parish in [[Konstanz|Litzelstetten]]. He later wrote that the first seven years in Litzelstetten were among the happiest of his life.

At this time he was editor of the magazine ''Sionsharfe'', devoted mainly to Catholic poetry. In May 1879 he published an article on Volapük in this magazine. This sketch was followed by a full-length book in 1880. The language spread widely and new clubs sprung all over [[Europe]]. After 1885 Schleyer had to retire from his pastoral duties due to ill health, though he was still involved in the Volapük movement until it fell apart a few years later.

In 1894 Pope [[Leo XIII]] made him a papal prelate.

Schleyer died in [[Konstanz]] in 1912.

A campaign to [[Beatification|beatify]] him was started in June 2001, based in his home parish of Litzelstetten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ikue.org/cz/arkivo/a-46-2-02.htm#29|title=Dio Benu 46-2/2002|website=www.ikue.org|accessdate=30 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high school '''Martin-Schleyer-Gymnasium Lauda-Königshofen''' in Lauda is named for him.

'''Lallu Lal''' (1763–1835) was an academic, author and translator from [[British India]]. He was an instructor in [[Hindustani language]] at [[Fort William College]]. He is notable for ''Prem Sagar'', the first work in modern literary [[Hindi]].

== Biography ==

Lallu Lal was born in a [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] [[Brahmin]] family of [[Agra]]. He had knowledge of [[Persian language|Persian]] and Hindustani. He came to [[Murshidabad]] to earn a living, and served the [[Nawab of Murshidabad]] for 7 years. He was noticed by [[John Gilchrist (linguist)|John Gilchrist]], who brought him to the Fort William College in Calcutta. There, Lallu Lal translated and authored several literary works into modern vernacular Hindi. He retired from the Fort William College in 1823–24 CE, after serving there for 24 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Akbar Padamsee |author2=Shamlal |title=Western Influence in Bengali Literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bIlBAQAAIAAJ |year=1966 |publisher=Vakil |page=320  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Works ==

Lallu Lal's most notable translation is ''Prem Sagar'' (1804–1810), the earliest prose in [[Khari Boli]] dialect of Hindi. Along with Kazim Ali Javan, he translated ''[[Singhasan Battisi]]'' and ''[[Shakuntala]]'' into Hindustani. Along with Mazhar Ali Vila, he also translated ''[[Baital Pachisi]]'' and ''Madhunal'' (1805) into Hindustani.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Grahame Bailey |title=A history of Urdu literature |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jT8qAQAAIAAJ |year=2008 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-547518-0 |page=80 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lallu Lal's original work included ''The Grammar of Brij-bhasa'' (1811), in [[Urdu script]]. He also authored ''Lala Chandrika'', a commentary on [[Bihari Lal|Bihari]]'s ''[[Satasai]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=[[George Abraham Grierson]] |title=The Satsaiya of Bihari, with a Commentary Entitled the Lala-candrika, by Çri Lallu Lal Kavi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zeB_nQEACAAJ |year=1896 |publisher=Office of the Superintendent of Government Printing, Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, he compiled ''Lataif-i-Hindi'' or ''The New Cyclopedia Hindoostanica of Wit'' (1810) in Urdu and [[Devanagari]] scripts. It is a collection of around 100 witty stories and anecdotes.&lt;ref name="AJK_2006"&gt;{{cite book |author=Abdul Jamil Khan |title=Urdu/Hindi: An Artificial Divide |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jWpNBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA205 |year=2006 |publisher=Algora Publishing |isbn=978-0-87586-437-2 |page=205 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prem Sagar ===

''Prem Sagar'' or ''Prem Sagur'' ("Ocean of Love") was one of the first modern [[Hindi]] books, composed between 1804 and 1810. A translation of Chaturbhuja Misra's [[Braj Bhasa]] book, its story is based on the tenth book of the ''[[Bhagavata Purana]]'', the legend of [[Krishna]].&lt;ref name="WH_1848"&gt;{{cite book |translator=W. Hollings |title=The Prem Sagur of Lallu Lal |url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/psa/ |publisher=Ridsdale |isbn=978-1-4655-8069-6 |year=1848 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest Hindustani language literature made heavy use of Persian words, and resembled modern [[Urdu]]. Lallu Lal was among the first writers to use words of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] origin in Hindustani language literature. His ''Prem Sagar'' is the earliest work, whose language resembles modern [[Sanskrit]]ized [[Hindi]]. Linguist [[Jules Bloch]] describes the importance of Lallu Lal's work as follows:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.columbia.edu/itc/mealac/pritchett/00urduhindilinks/tarachand/03misconceptions.html |title=The Problem of Hindustani (1944) |author=Tara Chand |year=1994 |publisher=Indian Periodicals |chapter=Some Misconceptions About Hindustani }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation|Lallu Lal, under the inspiration of Dr. Gilchrist, changed all that by writing the famous ''Prem Sagar'', whose prose portions are on the whole Urdu, from which Persian words have been throughout replaced by Indo-Aryan words… The new dialect gave a lingua franca to the Hindus.|Jules Bloch}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14436">An [[endangered language]] is a [[language]] that it is at risk of falling out of use, generally because it has few surviving speakers. If it loses all of its native speakers, it becomes an [[extinct language]]. [[UNESCO]] defines [[Endangered language#UNESCO definitions|four levels of language endangerment]] between "safe" (not endangered) and "extinct":&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1021">'''Lúcás Ó Dalláin''' ([[floruit|fl.]] 14th century) was an [[Irish people|Irish]] [[historian]].

Lúcás Ó Dalláin is credited with compiling a 14th-century version of ''[[Senchus Fer n-Alban]]'', originally compiled in the 10th century. Now referred to as Ms. H.2.7 and held by [[Trinity College Dublin]], it is the most important of a number of manuscripts of the ''Senchus''. 
Ó Dalláin is believed to have written the text while working with [[Seán Mór Ó Dubhagáin]] (died 1372). It was preserved and used by [[Dubhaltach Mac Fhirbhisigh]], and subsequently [[Edward Lhuyd]].

Little else appears to be known of Ó Dalláin himself.

'''M. A. Wazed Miah''' (6 February 1942{{snd}}9 May 2009) was a Bangladeshi nuclear scientist, the writer of a number of texts in physics and some political history books, a former Chairman of the [[Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission]] and husband of Prime Minister [[Sheikh Hasina]].

==Early life==
Wazed Miah was born on 16 February 1942 in the village of Fatehpur (Miah Bari) at [[Pirganj Upazila, Rangpur|Pirganj]], [[Rangpur District]]. His father was Abdul Quader Miah and mother was Moyzunnessa.&lt;ref name="Star"&gt;{{cite web|title=Life sketch of Wazed Miah|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/newDesign/story.php?nid=87586|website=archive.thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the youngest among three sisters and four brothers. To get the best education, from Class Five he was sent to board at [[Rangpur Zilla School|Rangpur Zila School]], from where he ultimately passed Matriculation in First Division with Distinction.

After passing the HSC exam, in 1958, he followed in the footsteps of his eldest sister's son, physicist Abdul Qayyum Sarker and took admittance into the Department of [[Physics]], [[Dhaka University]]. In 1961 he graduated with a Bachelor of Science in physics and in 1962 he finished his Master of Science.&lt;ref name="Star" /&gt; He completed the Diploma of [[Imperial College London]] Course in 1963–64 from Imperial College London, London.&lt;ref name="Star" /&gt; In 1967 he received his Doctor of Philosophy degree in physics from [[Durham University]], England. His thesis was on bootstrap hypothesis in theoretical particle physics, and he worked under [[Prof. E.J. Squires]].

==Political career==
From 1961 to 1962 he was the Vice-President of the Chhatra League of the Fazlul Haque Hall Student Union in University of Dhaka. He was arrested for movement against education commission and was imprisoned in 1962. He never played any active official role in the Awami League after his marriage to Sheikh Hasina.

==Professional career==
Miah joined in the Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission on 1 April 1963.&lt;ref name="Star" /&gt; In 1969 Miah got the Associate-ship of Italy-based [[International Centre for Theoretical Physics]] of Pakistani Nobel Laureate [[Abdus Salam]]. In the same year, he returned home to [[Pakistan]] and continued with the Atomic Energy Research Centre.&lt;ref name="Star" /&gt; He was engaged in research work at the New Delhi-based laboratory of [[Atomic Energy Commission of India]] during 1975–1982, during the period of exile of the remainder of the Mujib family after the bloody coup of 15 August 1975. After his return to [[Bangladesh]], he joined the Bangladesh Atomic Energy Commission, and eventually retired as its chairman in 1999.

==Personal life==
Miah married [[Sheikh Hasina]], eldest daughter [[Bangabandhu]] [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]] on 17 November 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scientist Wazed Miah remembered|url=http://bdnews24.com/bangladesh/2014/05/09/scientist-wazed-miah-remembered|website=bdnews24.com|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have a son [[Sajeeb Wazed Joy]] and a daughter [[Saima Wazed Putul]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rangpur AL wants Joy to contest from Pirganj-6|url=http://archive.thedailystar.net/beta2/news/rangpur-al-wants-joy-to-contest-from-pirganj-6/|website=archive.thedailystar.net|publisher=The Daily Star|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Miah died on 9 May 2009. He had for long suffered from high blood pressure, heart disease, renal failure, diabetes and asthma. He had a bypass operation a few years earlier and angioplasty in Singapore only a few months before his death. He was buried at a family graveyard in his native village at [[Pirganj Upazila, Rangpur|Pirganj, Rangpur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wazed Miah Is Dead|url=http://www.independent-bangladesh.com/2009050910944/country/wazed-miah-is-dead.html|website=independent-bangladesh.com|publisher=Bangladesh News|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mahlzeit''' is a German [[salutation]]. It is the short form of a more formal salutation, "Gesegnete Mahlzeit" (archaic term, [[German language|de:]] ''Blessed mealtime'').&lt;ref name="Marian"&gt;{{cite web
| url = https://jakubmarian.com/how-to-use-mahlzeit-in-german/
| title = How to use "Mahlzeit!" in German
| author = Jakub Marian
| accessdate = 2016-11-01
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The salutation is commonly used without connection to food or eating in Northern Germany, and this usage, corresponding to something like "hello, everyone" or "I'm off, folks", is becoming more and more widespread in informal settings, such as between office co-workers. In [[Austria]] it is used as a salutation during meal times&lt;ref name="Austria National Tourist Office"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.austria.info/uk/service-facts/customs-and-expressions/guten-appetit-eating-with-austrians
| title = Guten Appetit! Eating with Austrians

| accessdate = 2016-11-01
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; and can also be used before drinking Sturm ([[Federweisser]]) as reference to the meal-like quality of the fermenting grape juice. Similarly, in most German regions it is only used in connection with meals. However, [[Bundeswehr|soldiers]] typically greet each other with ''Mahlzeit'' (and the reply ''Mahlzeit'', not ''danke'') from getting up in the morning until about 8 pm, including the entire normal work day, presumably as the next mealtime is always within short distance and is looked forward to.

'''Mahlzeit''' can also be used in a negative sense.&lt;ref name="German mission in the United States"&gt;{{cite web
| url = http://www.germany.info/Vertretung/usa/en/__pr/GIC/TWIG__WoW/2013/23-Mahlzeit.html
| title = Word of the Week: Mahlzeit
| author =  German Mission in the United States
| accessdate = 2016-11-01
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when two people see something that might well spoil their appetite, one may sarcastically say "Mahlzeit" (or the stronger, "Na, Mahlzeit!") to the other.

When greeted  with "Mahlzeit", one would ordinarily reply with "Mahlzeit" in return, or simply with "Danke", the German term for "thank you".

'''Manuel de Pedrolo i Molina''' ({{IPA-ca|mənuˈɛl də pəˈðɾɔlu}}; 1918 – 1990) was an author of novels, short stories, poetry and plays. He's mostly known for his [[sci-fi]] novel ''Mecanoscrit del segon origen'' (''[[Typescript of the Second Origin]]'').

==Mini-biography==
[[File:Casa natal Manuel de Pedrolo.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Manuel de Pedrolo's birthplace.]]
Manuel de Pedrolo was born in 1918 in L'Aranyó, in the [[Segarra]] [[Comarques of Catalonia|comarca]] (county), in [[Catalonia]]. After the [[Spanish civil war]] he settled down in [[Barcelona]], where he worked at a great number of jobs while writing as a background activity. From 1974, he was able to devote himself to literature, creating works, translating, and doing other minor editorial tasks. He died in Barcelona, in 1990, after suffering a long illness.

==Work==

Despite the fact that he is considered one of the most ambitious writers in [[catalan language|Catalan]], having cultivated virtually all literary genres, Manuel de Pedrolo is especially known for his vast production of prose, with more than 72 novels published between 1949 and 1985, many of which were [[detective novels]]. Most of them were thoroughly censored under the following terms: "[[catalanism]], political opinions, religion, sexual morality and indecorous language".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fundaciopedrolo.cat/?seccio=ped-Censura Pedrolo Foundation]&lt;/ref&gt; He also translated into Catalan works by [[John Dos Passos]], [[William Faulkner]] and [[Jean-Paul Sartre]]. Throughout his life, he had several run-ins with Spanish [[Francisco Franco|fascists]] around censorship issues. He also received many awards and was bestowed with the highest honors in Catalan literature.

===''Mecanoscrit del segon origen''===
{{Main|Typescript of the Second Origin}}
Pedrolo's name will remain forever attached to the title of his most popular work, his first attempt at the [[sci-fi]] genre, ''Mecanoscrit del segon origen'' ("Typescript of the Second Origin"). First published in 1974, it became the most broadly disseminated Catalan fiction book in the following decade, with 26 editions and more than 270,000 copies sold in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;Prologue by [[Francesc Vallverdú]] to a 1986 special edition for [[La Caixa]].&lt;/ref&gt;

The novel narrates the story of two children from a little country village named Benaura in Catalonia, Spain. Alba, a fourteen-year-old girl, and Dídac, a black nine-year-old boy, become the two only remaining humans on Earth after they accidentally survive an alien holocaust that eradicates all mammal life on the planet. As Alba and Dídac bravely recover from the catastrophe, they not only insist on living in a post-apocalyptic world, inhabited by myriads of corpses and deranged, psychotic survivors, but they also take up the mission of preserving human culture and repopulating the Earth.

Although the novel was not addressed to youngsters, the dramatic and yet romantically attractive position of the main characters made the ''Mecanoscrit'' very popular among teenagers, and even though it is compulsory reading in many Catalan highschools today, many young people will have already read it at an earlier age. From an adult perspective, Alba &amp; Dídac's will to survive makes this novel a wonderful chant to life and hope. The well-documented scientific data and the use of cultured-but-readable language are just two of the reasons for the success of this book, which has had a deep impact on Catalan culture{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}.

'''Micro-SFP''' ('''µSFP''') describes an ultra-short [[science-fiction]] story written for the specific purpose of capturing inventive ideas for product or service innovations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.creative-science.org/activities/microsfp/&lt;/ref&gt; It is a combination of three concepts, first [[Science fiction prototyping|''science-fiction prototyping'']] (a methodology based on writing fictional stories to instantiate and test ideas for new products, businesses or political systems),&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, Brian David (April 20, 2011). "''Science Fiction Prototyping: Designing the Future with Science Fiction''". Morgan &amp; Claypool. {{ISBN|978-1608456550}}.&lt;/ref&gt; second [[flash fiction]] (a genre that advocates writing stories as small as just 6 words) and finally, [[Twitter]] and [[texting]] (messaging and social networking in less than 140 / 160 characters).

== Roots ==
As a tool to influence the future, µSFP has similarities to [[fables]], [[parables]], [[anecdotes]], [[sayings]], [[proverbs]] and maxims in that it seeks to capture and communicate an inspirational vision. In literary terms, it is similar to what the English speaking world refer to as [[flash fiction]] (sometimes called micro-fiction, nano-fiction, sudden fiction or postcard-fiction), or in Latin-America microrrelato (or ficcione), in France; [[nouvelles]], China minute-long (or smoke-long) and in Japan [[Haibun]]. However, given that µSFP was initially devised to capture technological product [[innovations]]  it was more closely connected to technology platforms such as ''T(ext)-Fiction'' (160 characters ~30 words) or ''[[twitterature|Twitter Lit]]'' (140 characters or ~25 words). The initial motivation for developing a shorter variant of [[science fiction prototyping]] was to provide a type of shorthand for capturing [[ideas]] (and the context) quickly, such as in a [[brain-storming]] meeting. µSFP was first proposed by Anasol Peña Rios, a researcher at the [[University of Essex]], who used the methodology in support of a 2013 [[UK]] event for K12 students called {{'}}''The New Creatives''{{'}}.

== Examples ==
The most widely cited example of flash fiction is [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s classic six word story "[[For sale: baby shoes, never worn]]".  Within the science and engineering community, the [[Creative Science Foundation]] has run a number of events that have produced examples of µSFPs such as from the New Creatives 2014 in Colchester "''Jack fall asleep in the sun.

== Methodology ==
The core methodology of µSFP is the application of flash fiction as shorthand for describing [[Innovation|innovative ideas]] for science, engineering, business and socio-political systems.  Generally there are three components to a µSFP; the technology, a simple action and a person.  Most literature on µSFP advocates the following steps for writing a µSFP:
* Start by identifying the technology, process or service
* Identify a character (try use a very short person name)
* Then create at plot (events that make up the story – should include an inflection point and a benefit)

Because of its technical roots, [[Twitter]] sized µSFPs (140 characters / 25 words) are more common.  It is widely acknowledged that writing such ultra-short stories is difficult, so the general advice is to start big, then reduce it. As with larger science fiction prototyping, ideas can come from existing research, fiction or from people's imaginations.  Adding a protagonist and context that illustrates the technology in use is an important feature of a µSFP since such [[prototypes]] not just describe ideas, but test them by illustrating usage. µSFPs have numerous uses such as teaching [[English as a foreign language]],&lt;ref&gt;"''Using Science-fiction Prototyping as a Means to Motivate Learning of STEM Topics and Foreign Languages''", Intelligent Environments 2014, Shanghai Jiaotong University, China, 2–4 July 2014&lt;/ref&gt; motivating pre-university students to take up [[Science, technology, engineering, and mathematics|STEM]] studies&lt;ref&gt;"''Using Science Fiction Prototyping to Decrease the Decline of Interest in STEM Topics at the High School Level''", Transactions of Future Educational Environments ([[European Alliance for Innovation]] Endorsed Transactions), Fall 2015&lt;/ref&gt; and producing real-world technical innovations.&lt;ref&gt;"''Creative Science: Injecting Innovation into the IT Industry''", Oxford Journals, ITNOW (Summer 2015) 57 (2): p52-55&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Novotroick IMG 6406.jpg|thumb|[[Novotroitsk]], a monotown in [[Orenburg Oblast]], Russia]]
A '''monotown''' (a [[calque]] from Russian [[:ru:wikt:моногород|моногород]], ''monogorod''; ''gorod'' meaning "town") is a [[types of inhabited localities in Russia|city/town]] whose economy is dominated by a single industry or company. This means that most employments (except for service to residents like schools and shops) are by the main company.

==Russia==
The term ''monotown'' is especially often used in Russia, where the Soviet [[planned economy]] created hundreds of monotowns in supposedly rational locations, often in geographically inhospitable areas. The situation in many of Russia's monotowns is highly problematic: they are entirely dependent on the competitiveness of a single company or factory, very unflexible and based on Soviet-era economics and technologies.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRUSSIANFEDERATION/Resources/305499-1245838520910/rer_22_eng.pdf|title=Russian Economic Report, June 2010|publisher=World Bank|date=June 2010|access-date=2011-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101110112659/http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTRUSSIANFEDERATION/Resources/305499-1245838520910/rer_22_eng.pdf|archive-date=2010-11-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/opinion/17aron.html|title=Darkness on the Edge of Monotown|publisher=The New York Times|date=2009-10-16|access-date=2018-10-27|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20181010060917/https://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/17/opinion/17aron.html|archive-date=2018-10-10|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most monotowns were built essentially as residential extensions of particular enterprises (so called "city-forming enterprises"), their population being either engaged in the city-forming enterprise's manufacturing process, or providing various services to the former group. The core workforce in monotowns was largely formed by the centralized workforce distribution system (people being assigned to an enterprise for a certain number of years after completing the education - which essentially replaced tuition payment, or transferred from other enterprises) rather than by spontaneous migration processes, as it was the case in less specialized towns. Combined, these factors led to narrow and inflexible economies and an immobile workforce, by the standards of the market economy newly introduced into the country in late 1980s - early 1990s.

By the time the city-forming enterprises had been privatized and / or liquidated, the workforce management system already ceased to exist, so the leftover workforce could not be transferred to other regions retaining the living conditions, as it was done during the Soviet era following the liquidation of a no longer needed enterprise. Monotown residents proved to be hesitant to move away on their own and seek work elsewhere as well, mostly because the state housing distribution system lied almost dead at the time, and very low market value of their real estate didn't let them count on minimally comfortable apartments in any other developed town (agricultural sector was and is even more depressive in most regions of Russia, making countryside largely unattractive for the town-dwellers).{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===History===
According to a Russian government study conducted in 1999—2000, there were 467 cities and 332 smaller towns in Russia which could be classified as monotowns. The combined population of these towns was 25 million, or a sixth of the country's total population. The 900 monotown enterprises—most of them involved in heavy industries such as manufacturing, fuels, timber, pulp and metallurgy—accounted for more than 30% of industrial production.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt;

The monotowns suffered greatly in the [[late-2000s recession]], leading to mass unemployment in the cities.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt; Having no other hope, people have only one option - to protest.

In one high-profile incident, in 2009 some 300 residents of the north-western town of [[Pikalyovo, Leningrad Oblast|Pikalyovo]] blocked a major highway to protest against large delays in the payments of wages.&lt;ref name="pikalevo1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090602/155146932.html|title=Protesters in northwest Russia block road over plant closures|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2009-06-02|access-date=2011-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090614123347/http://en.rian.ru/russia/20090602/155146932.html|archive-date=2009-06-14|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prime Minister [[Vladimir Putin]] traveled to the city and ordered the owner of the city's dominant company [[BasEl Cement Pikalyovo]], [[Oleg Deripaska]] to pay over 41 million rubles ($1.3 million) of wage arrears to the city's residents. The sum was paid out and the situation in the city calmed down, but questions remained about the long-term viability of the Pikalyovo plants.&lt;ref name="pikalevo2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://en.rian.ru/business/20090604/155170638.html|title=Protesting workers in northwest Russia paid wage arrears|publisher=RIA Novosti|date=2009-06-04|access-date=2011-01-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127184023/http://en.rian.ru/business/20090604/155170638.html|archive-date=2011-11-27|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2018, the official list of Russian monotowns includes 319 populated places.&lt;ref name="tass17"&gt;{{cite news |title=Список моногородов в России "заморожен" до конца 2018 года |url=https://tass.ru/ekonomika/3944436 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=ТАСС |date=16 January 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329221354/http://tass.ru/ekonomika/3944436 |archive-date=2018-03-29 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towns can be removed from the list, if the local economies are deemed to have become sufficiently diversified.&lt;ref name="tass17"/&gt; In late 2017, 14 million Russians lived in officially designated monotowns.&lt;ref name="ft17a"&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia’s next revolution: how technology came to the mines |url=https://www.ft.com/content/addb7e2a-b90d-11e7-9bfb-4a9c83ffa852 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Financial Times |date=26 October 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207123313/https://www.ft.com/content/addb7e2a-b90d-11e7-9bfb-4a9c83ffa852 |archive-date=2018-02-07 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A Fund for the Development of Monotowns was established in 2014, to invest in infrastructure and promote economic diversification.&lt;ref name="ft16a"&gt;{{cite news |title=Russia’s ‘monotowns’ face imminent collapse |url=https://www.ft.com/content/e8001869-3ce0-3b8c-93b0-36421acc60ed |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=Financial Times |date=6 October 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161009055925/https://www.ft.com/content/e8001869-3ce0-3b8c-93b0-36421acc60ed |archive-date=2016-10-09 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The monotown list is divided into categories, depending on the socioeconomic situation.&lt;ref name="shastitko16"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Shastitko |first1=A. |last2=Fatikhova |first2=A. |title=Monotowns: A Quantitative Analysis |journal=Baltic Region |date=2016 |volume=8 |issue=2 |pages=4–19 |doi=10.5922/2079-8555-2016-2-1 |url=https://journals.kantiana.ru/upload/iblock/a79/Shastitko%20A.,%20Fatikhova_4-19.pdf |accessdate=27 October 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180602160109/https://journals.kantiana.ru/upload/iblock/a79/Shastitko%20A.,%20Fatikhova_4-19.pdf |archive-date=2018-06-02 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monotowns are not necessarily economically stagnant: [[Norilsk]] has an above average employment rate, as well as relatively high salaries.&lt;ref name="shastitko16"/&gt;

===Examples===
Russia's largest monotown is [[Tolyatti]], which has a population of 700,000. It is home to the large [[AvtoVAZ]] factory, which in late 2008 employed 106,000 people. AvtoVAZ is Russia's largest carmaker, accounting for 1% of the country's GDP.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt;{{dated info|date=October 2018}} As of 2014, the AvtoVAZ is owned by Nissan-Renault, which uses even harsher workforce policies than the previous owner.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} However, the situation is somewhat aided by widespread of small-scale car parts producers and other small car-oriented enterprises in the region, which are providing many additional workplaces.

[[Dalnegorsk]], located in the [[Russian Far East]], is a monotown with a population of nearly 40,000 people. The town's economy is completely dominated by two mining and metallurgy companies: JSC [[Bor (enterprise)|Bor]] and JSC [[Dalpolimetal]], both subsidiaries of OOO UK Russian mining company (RGRK). They produce zinc and lead concentrates as well as boric acid colemanite.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010" /&gt;

==Soviet Union and other post-Soviet states==
The [[Economy of the Soviet Union|Soviet planned economy]] aimed to establish industrial facilities in rational locations, based on military, political, bureaucratic and economic criteria. The goal was to maximise regional specialisation. The dominant enterprise was responsible not only for production, but for providing [[social services]] to the population, such as housing, child care, etc.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt;

After the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], most of the monotowns' dominant enterprises were privatised, and consequently many of them had gone bankrupt by the end of the 1990s, either deliberately (usually it was more profitable to sell the property of an enterprise than to keep it functioning) or due to uncompetitiveness, caused by the shrinkage of the home market outside the consumer goods sector, unrestricted import of low-cost industrial wares from China, Turkey or other countries and the lack of long-term investments by the private owners, who were for the most part interested in quick money rather than development or modernization.

Private owners also mostly refused to provide social services to the populations of monotowns, referring to such practice as being "economically inefficient" - however, the government's attempt to delegate the responsibility of providing social services from the companies to the newly created local municipalities was mostly a failure, as they lacked resources to complete the transformation.&lt;ref name="wb_june2010"/&gt; That led to a radical decrease in quality of life in monotowns, which enjoyed higher-than-average wealth for the most part of the Soviet period.

'''Old High German''' ('''OHG''', {{lang-de|Althochdeutsch}}, German abbr. {{lang|de|Ahd.}}) is the earliest stage of the [[German language]], conventionally covering the period from around 700 to 1050. Coherent written texts do not appear until the second half of the [[8th century]], and some treat the period before 750 as "prehistoric" (including the [[Proto-Germanic language]]) and date the start of Old High German proper to 750 for this reason. There are, however, a number of [[Elder Futhark]] inscriptions dating to the 6th century (notably the [[Pforzen buckle]]), as well as single words and many names found in [[Latin]] texts predating the 8th century.

==Territory==
{{Further|Francia|Carolingian Empire|Frankish language}}
[[File:OldHighGermanlanguagearea962.png|right|upright=1.2|thumb|The Old High German speaking area around 950.]]
During the [[Migration Period]], the [[High German languages|High German]]-speaking tribes settled in what became [[Alamannia]], the [[Duchy of Bavaria]] and the [[Kingdom of the Lombards]]. At the same time the [[Franconian languages|Franconian]]-speaking tribes settled the area between those two rivers{{clarify |date=September 2018 |reason=Unclear which two rivers; context has been removed. Elbe and Rhine?}} before crossing the Rhine to conquer Northern Gaul, where, under the [[Merovingian dynasty|Merovingians]], they created the Frankish kingdom, [[Francia]], which eventually stretched down to the [[Loire]].

Old High German comprises the dialects of these groups which underwent the Second Sound Shift during the 6th Century, namely all of Elbe Germanic and most of the Weser-Rhine Germanic dialects.

The Franks in the western part of [[Francia]] ([[Neustria]] and western [[Austrasia]]) gradually adopted [[Gallo-Romance languages|Gallo-Romance]] by the beginning of the OHG period, with the linguistic boundary later stabilised approximately along the course of the [[Meuse]] and [[Moselle]] in the east, and the northern boundary probably a little further south than the current boundary between [[French language|French]] and [[Flemish]].{{sfn|Wells|1987|p=49}} North of this line, the Franks retained their language, but it was not affected by the [[High German consonant shift|Second Sound Shift]], which thus separated their [[Low Franconian languages|Low Franconian variety]] (the ancestor of [[Dutch language|Dutch]]) from the more easterly Franconian dialects which formed part of Old High German.

The [[Saxons]] and the [[Frisians]] along the shores of [[North Sea]] were likewise not affected by the Second Sound Shift and a bundle of [[isogloss]]es in a similar location to the modern [[Benrath line]]{{sfn|Wells|1987|p=43| ps=. Fn. 26}} marked the Northern limit of the sound shift and separated the dialect of the Franks from [[Old Saxon]].

In the south, the [[Lombards]], who had settled in [[Northern Italy]], maintained their dialect until their conquest by [[Charlemagne]] in 774. After this the Germanic-speaking population, who were by then almost certainly bilingual, gradually switched to the [[Gallo-Italic languages|Romance language of the native population]], so that Langobardic had died out by the end of the OHG period.{{sfn|Hutterer|1999|page=338}}

At the beginning of the period, no Germanic language was spoken east of a line from [[Kieler Förde]] to the rivers [[Elbe]] and [[Saale]], earlier Germanic speakers in the Northern part of the area having been displaced by the [[Slavs]]. This area did not become German-speaking again until the [[Ostsiedlung|German eastward expansion]] ("Ostkolonisation") of the early 12th century, though there was some attempt at conquest and missionary work under the [[Ottonian dynasty|Ottonians]].{{sfn|Peters|1985|p=1211}}

The Alemannic polity was conquered by [[Clovis I]] in 496, and in the last twenty years of the 8th century Charlemagne subdued the Saxons, the Frisians, the Bavarians, and the Lombards, bringing all continental [[Germanic languages|Germanic-speaking peoples]] under Frankish rule. While this led to some degree of [[Frankish language|Frankish linguistic influence]], the language of both the administration and the Church was Latin, and this unification did not therefore lead to any development of a supra-regional variety of Frankish nor a standardized Old High German; the individual dialects retained their identity.

==Literacy==
{{Further|Oaths of Strasbourg|Germanic Christianity|Anglo-Saxon mission}}

Old High German literacy is a product of the monasteries, notably at [[St. Gallen]], [[Reichenau Island]] and [[Fulda]]. Its origins lie in the establishment of the German church by [[Saint Boniface]] in the mid 8th century, and it was further encouraged during the [[Carolingian Renaissance]] in the 9th. 
The dedication to the preservation of Old High German epic poetry among the scholars of the Carolingian Renaissance was significantly greater than could be suspected from the meagre survivals we have today (less than 200 lines in total between the ''[[Hildebrandslied]]'' and the ''[[Muspilli]]''). [[Einhard]] tells how Charlemagne himself ordered that the epic lays should be collected for posterity.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', 29: "He also had the old rude songs that celebrate the deeds and wars of the ancient kings written out for transmission to posterity."&lt;/ref&gt; It was the neglect or religious zeal of later generations that led to the loss of these records. Thus, it was Charlemagne's weak successor, [[Louis the Pious]], who destroyed his father's collection of epic poetry on account of its pagan content.{{sfn|Parra Membrives|2002|p=43}}

[[Rabanus Maurus]], a student of [[Alcuin]]'s and abbot at Fulda from 822, was an important advocate of the cultivation of German literacy. Among his students were [[Walafrid Strabo]] and [[Otfrid of Weissenburg]].

Towards the end of the Old High German period, [[Notker Labeo]] (d. 1022) was among the greatest stylists in the language, and developed a systematic orthography.{{sfn|von Raumer|1851|pp=194–272}}

==Characteristics==
{{Main|High German consonant shift}}
The main difference between Old High German and the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic dialects]] from which it developed is that it underwent the [[High German consonant shift]] (also called the ''second consonant shift'' in relation to the similar but much earlier [[Grimm's law]]). This is generally dated approximately to the late 5th and early 6th centuries—hence dating its start to around 500. The result of this sound change is that the [[consonantal system]] of [[German language|German]] remains different from all other West Germanic languages, including [[English language|English]] and [[Low German]]. Grammatically, however, Old High German remained very similar to [[Old English language|Old English]], [[Old Dutch]], and [[Old Saxon]].

By the mid 11th century the many different [[vowels]] found in unstressed syllables had all been reduced to {{IPAslink|ə}}. Since these vowels were part of the grammatical endings in the [[nouns]] and [[verbs]], their loss led to radical simplification of the [[inflection]]al grammar of German. For these reasons, 1050 is seen as the start of the [[Middle High German]] period, though in fact there are almost no texts in German for the next hundred years.

Examples of [[vowel reduction]] in unstressed syllables:

==Dialects==
{{further|Proto-Germanic language|Germanic languages}}
[[File:The Old High German monastery dialects and their main scriptoria.jpg|thumb|Map showing the main Old High German [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] and the areas of the Old High German "monastery dialects".]]
There was no standard or supra-regional variety of Old High German—every text is written in a particular dialect, or in some cases a mixture of dialects. Broadly speaking, the main dialect divisions of Old High German seem to have been similar to those of later periods—they are based on established territorial groupings and the effects of the Second Sound Shift, which have remained influential until the present day. But because the direct evidence for Old High German consists solely of [[manuscript]]s produced in a few major ecclesiastical centres, there is no [[isogloss]] information of the sort on which modern dialect maps are based. For this reason the dialects may be termed "monastery dialects" (German ''Klosterdialekte'').{{sfn | Wells |1987 |pp=44,50-53}}

The main dialects, with their [[Diocese|bishoprics]] and [[monasteries]]:{{sfn|Sonderegger|1980|p=571}}

* [[Central German]]
** [[East Franconian]]: [[Fulda]], [[Bamberg]], [[Würzburg]]
** [[Middle Franconian]]: [[Trier]], [[Echternach]], [[Cologne]]
** [[Rhine Franconian]]: [[Lorsch]], [[Speyer]], [[Worms, Germany|Worms]], [[Mainz]], [[Frankfurt]]
** [[South Rhine Franconian]]: [[Wissembourg]]
* [[Upper German]]
** [[Alemannic German|Alemannic]]: [[Murbach Abbey|Murbach]], [[Reichenau Island|Reichenau]], [[Abbey of St. Gall|Sankt Gallen]], [[Strasbourg]]
** [[Austro-Bavarian|Bavarian]]: [[Freising]], [[Passau]], [[Regensburg]], [[Augsburg]], [[Ebersberg]], [[Wessobrunn Abbey|Wessobrunn]], [[Benediktbeuern Abbey|Benediktbeuern]], [[Tegernsee Abbey|Tegernsee]], [[Salzburg]], [[Mondsee Abbey|Mondsee]]

In addition, there are two poorly attested dialects:
* [[Thuringian]] is attested only in four runic inscriptions and some possible glosses.{{sfn|Wells|1987|p=432}}
* [[Langobardic]] was the dialect of the [[Lombards]] who invaded [[Northern Italy]] in the 6th century, and little evidence of it remains apart from names and individual words in [[Latin]] texts, and a few runic inscriptions. It declined after the conquest of the [[Lombard Kingdom]] by the Franks in 774. It is classified as Upper German on the basis of evidence of the Second Sound Shift.{{sfn|Hutterer|1999|pp=336-341}}

The continued existence of a [[West Frankish]] dialect in the Western, Romanized part of Francia  is uncertain. Claims that this might have been the language of the Carolingian court or that it is attested in the [[Ludwigslied]], whose presence in a French manuscript suggests [[bilingualism]], are controversial.{{sfn|Sonderegger|1980|p=571}}{{sfn|Wells|1987|p=432}}

==Phonology==
The charts show the vowel and consonant systems of the East Franconian dialect in the 9th century. This is the dialect of the monastery of [[Fulda]], and specifically of the Old High German ''[[Tatian]]''. Dictionaries and grammars of OHG often use the spellings of the Tatian as a substitute for genuine standardised spellings, and these have the advantage of being recognizably close to the [[Middle High German]] forms of words, particularly with respect to the consonants.

===Vowels===
Old High German had five phonemic long vowels and six phonemic short vowels. Both occurred in stressed and unstressed syllables.

Notes:
# All back vowels likely had front-vowel [[allophones]] as a result of [[Germanic umlaut|Umlaut]]. The front-vowel allophones likely became full phonemes in Middle High German. In the Old High German period, there existed {{IPA|[e]}} (possibly a mid-close vowel) from the Umlaut of {{IPA|/a/}} and {{IPA|/e/}}{{clarify|date=December 2014}} but it probably wasn't phonemicized until the end of the period. Manuscripts occasionally distinguish two {{IPA|/e/}} sounds. Generally, modern grammars and dictionaries use {{angle bracket|ë}} for the mid vowel and {{angle bracket|e}} for the mid-close vowel.
# The short high and mid vowels may have been articulated lower than their long counterparts as in Modern German. This cannot be established from written sources.
# Short vowels followed later by long vowels tended to be reduced to {{angle bracket|e}} in unstressed syllables. The {{angle bracket|e}} may have represented {{IPA|[ɛ]}} or [[schwa]] {{IPA|[ə]}}.
# Vowel length was indicated in the manuscripts inconsistently (though modern handbooks are consistent). Vowel letter doubling, a [[circumflex]], or an [[acute accent]] was generally used to indicate a long vowel.{{sfn|Wright|1906|page=2}}

Old High German diphthongs are indicated by the [[digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] {{angle bracket|ei}}, {{angle bracket|ie}}, {{angle bracket|io}}, {{angle bracket|iu}}, {{angle bracket|ou}}, {{angle bracket|uo}}.

# There is wide variation in the consonant systems of the Old High German dialects arising mainly from the differing extent to which they are affected by the [[High German Sound Shift]]. Precise information about the articulation of consonants is impossible to establish.
#In the plosive and fricative series, where there are two consonants in a cell, the first is [[Fortis (phonetics)|fortis]] the second [[lenis]]. The voicing of lenis consonants varied between dialects.
#Old High German distinguished long and short consonants. Double-consonant spellings don't indicate a preceding short vowel as in Modern German but true consonant [[gemination]]. Double consonants found in Old High German include ''pp, bb, tt, dd, ck'' (for {{IPA|/kk/}}), ''gg, ff, ss, hh, zz, mm, nn, ll, rr.''
#{{IPA|/θ/}} changes to {{IPA|/d/}} in all dialects during the 9th century. The status in the Old High German ''Tatian'' (c. 830), reflected in modern Old High German dictionaries and glossaries, is that ''th'' is found in initial position, ''d'' in other positions.
# It is not clear whether Old High German {{IPA|/x/}} had already acquired a palatalized allophone {{IPA|[ç]}} following front vowels as in Modern German.
#A [[geschwänztes Z|curly-tailed ''z'']] (''[[ȥ]]'') is sometimes used in modern grammars and dictionaries to indicate the alveolar fricative which arose from [[Common Germanic]] ''t'' in the [[High German consonant shift]], to distinguish it from the alveolar affricate, represented as ''z''. This distinction has no counterpart in the original manuscripts, except in the OHG ''Isidor'', which uses ''tz'' for the affricate.
# The original Germanic fricative ''s'' was in writing usually clearly distinguished from the younger fricative ''z'' that evolved from the High German consonant shift - the sounds of these two graphs seem not to have merged before the 13th century. Now seeing that ''s'' later came to be pronounced {{IPA|/ʃ/}} before other consonants (as in ''Stein'' {{IPA|/ʃtaɪn/}}, ''Speer'' {{IPA|/ʃpeːɐ/}}, ''Schmerz'' {{IPA|/ʃmɛrts/}} (original ''smerz'') or the southwestern pronunciation of words like ''Ast'' {{IPA|/aʃt/}}), it seems safe to assume that the actual pronunciation of Germanic ''s'' was somewhere between {{IPA|[s]}} and {{IPA|[ʃ]}}, most likely about {{IPA|[s̠]}}, in all Old High German up to late Middle High German. A word like ''swaz'', "whatever", would thus never have been {{IPA|[swas]}} but rather {{IPA|[s̠was]}}, later (13th century) {{IPA|[ʃwas]}}, {{IPA|[ʃvas]}}.


===Phonological developments===
Here are enumerated the sound changes that transformed [[West Germanic languages|Common West Germanic]] into Old High German, not including the Late OHG changes which effected [[Middle High German]] 
* {{IPA|/ɣ/}}, {{IPA|/β/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, {{IPA|/b/}} in all positions ({{IPA|/ð/}} &gt; {{IPA|/d/}} already took place in West Germanic). Most but not all High German areas are subject to this change.
** PG *''sibi'' "sieve" &gt; OHG ''sib'' (cf. Old English ''sife''), PG *''gestra'' "yesterday"  &gt; OHG ''gestaron'' (cf. OE ''ġeostran'', ''ġ'' being a fricative {{IPA|/ʝ/}} )
* [[High German consonant shift]]: Inherited voiceless plosives are [[Lenition|lenited]] into fricatives and affricates, while voiced fricatives are hardened into plosives and in some cases devoiced.
** Ungeminated post-vocalic {{IPA|/p/}}, {{IPA|/t/}}, {{IPA|/k/}} spirantize intervocalically to {{IPA|/ff/}}, {{IPA|/ȥȥ/}}, {{IPA|/xx/}} and elsewhere to {{IPA|/f/}}, {{IPA|/ȥ/}}, {{IPA|/x/}}. Cluster {{IPA|/tr/}} is exempt from this. Compare Old English ''slǣpan'' to Old High German ''slāfan''.
** Word-initially, after a resonant and when geminated, the same consonants affricatized to {{IPA|/pf/}}, {{IPA|/tȥ/}} and {{IPA|/kx/}}, OE ''tam'' : OHG ''zam''.
*** Spread of {{IPA|/k/}} &gt; {{IPA|/kx/}} is geographically very limited and is not reflected in Modern Standard German.
** {{IPA|/b/}}, {{IPA|/d/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} are devoiced.
*** In Standard German, this applies to {{IPA|/d/}} in all positions, but to {{IPA|/b/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}} only when geminated. PG *brugjo &gt; *bruggo &gt; ''brucca'', but *leugan &gt; ''leggen''.
* {{IPA|/eː/}} (*''ē²'') and {{IPA|/oː/}} are diphthongized into {{IPA|/ie/}} and {{IPA|/uo/}} respectively.
* Proto-Germanic {{IPA|/ai/}} became {{IPA|/ei/}}, except before {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/h/}}, {{IPA|/w/}} and word finally, where it monophthongizes into ê ( which is also the reflex of unstressed {{IPA|/ai/}}) .
** Similarly {{IPA|/au/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ô/}} before {{IPA|/r/}}, {{IPA|/h/}} and all dentals, otherwise {{IPA|/au/}} &gt; {{IPA|/ou/}}. PG *''dauþaz'' "death" &gt; OHG ''tôd'', but *''haubudą'' "head" &gt; ''houbit''.
*** {{IPA|/h/}} refers here only to inherited {{IPA|/h/}} from PIE *k, and not to the result of the consonant shift {{IPA|/x/}}, which is sometimes written as h.
* {{IPA|/eu/}} merges with {{IPA|/iu/}} under ''i''-umlaut and ''u''-umlaut, but elsewhere is {{IPA|/io/}} (earlier {{IPA|/eo/}}). In [[Upper German]] varieties it also becomes {{IPA|/iu/}} before labials and velars.
* {{IPA|/θ/}} fortifies to {{IPA|/d/}} in all German dialects.
* Initial {{IPA|/w/}} and {{IPA|/h/}} before another consonant are dropped.

==Morphology==

===Nouns===
{{Main|Old High German declension}}

===Verbs===
====Tense====
Germanic had a simple two-tense system, with forms for a [[present tense|present]] and [[preterite]]. These were inherited by Old High German, but in addition OHG developed three [[periphrasis|periphrastic tenses]]: the [[perfect tense|perfect]], [[pluperfect]] and [[future tense|future]].

The periphrastic past tenses were formed by combining the present or preterite of an [[auxiliary verb]] (''wësan'', ''habēn'') with the past participle. Initially the past participle retained its original function as an adjective and showed case and gender endings - for intransitive verbs the nominative, for transitive verbs the accusative.{{sfn|Schrodt|2004|pp=9-18}} For example:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''After thie thö argangana warun ahtu taga'' ([[Tatian]], 7,1)&lt;br /&gt;
"When eight days had passed", literally "After that then passed (away) were eight days"&lt;br /&gt;
Latin: ''Et postquam consummati sunt dies octo'' (Luke 2:21){{sfn|Kuroda|1979|p=90}}&lt;br /&gt;

&lt;br /&gt;

''phīgboum habeta sum giflanzotan'' (Tatian 102,2)&lt;br /&gt;
"someone had planted a fig tree", literally "fig-tree had certain (''or'' someone) planted"&lt;br /&gt;
Latin: ''arborem fici habebat quidam plantatam'' (Luke 3:6){{sfn|Kuroda|1979|p=52}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wright|first1=Joseph|title=An Old High-German Primer|date=1888|publisher=Oxford at Clarendon Press|location=Google Books|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FJpiAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=11 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In time, however, these endings fell out of use and the participle came to be seen no longer as an adjective but as part of the verb, as in Modern German.

This development is generally taken to be the result of a need to translate Latin forms,{{sfn|Sonderegger|1979|p=269}} but parallels in other Germanic languages (particularly Gothic, where the Biblical texts were translated from Greek, not Latin) raise the possibility that it was an independent development.{{sfn|Moser, Wellmann, Wolf|1981|pp=82–84}}{{sfn|Morris|1991|pp=161–167}}

Germanic also had no future tense, but again OHG created periphrastic forms, using an auxiliary verb ''skulan'' (Modern German ''sollen'') and the infinitive, or ''werden'' and the present participle:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''Thu scalt beran einan alawaltenden'' (Otfrid's Evangelienbuch I,5,23)&lt;br /&gt;
"You will bear an almighty [one]"&lt;ref&gt;The word ''alawaltenden'' ("almighty"), in this example, is a substantivization, and would be capitalized in modern German as are all nouns.  The inflection of the adjective indicates a masculine object; where in English we would have to state "one", "boy", "man", etc., in German the equivalent word can be omitted.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
''Inti nu uuirdist thu suigenti''' (Tatian 2,9)&lt;br /&gt;
"And now you will start to fall silent"&lt;br /&gt;
Latin: ''Et ecce eris tacens'' (Luke 1:20)
{{sfn|Sonderegger|1979|p=271}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The present tense continued to be used alongside these new forms to indicate future time (as it still is in Modern German).

====Conjugation====
The following is a sample [[Grammatical conjugation|conjugation]] of a strong verb, ''nëman'' "to take".

==Texts==
{{Further|Medieval German literature}}
The early part of the period saw considerable missionary activity, and by 800 the whole of the [[Frankish Empire]] had, in principle, been Christianized. All the manuscripts which contain Old High German texts were written in ecclesiastical [[scriptorium|scriptoria]] by [[scribe]]s whose main task was writing in Latin rather than German. Consequently, the majority of Old High German texts are religious in nature and show strong influence of [[ecclesiastical Latin]] on the vocabulary. In fact, most surviving prose texts are translations of Latin originals. Even secular works such as the {{lang|de|[[Hildebrandslied]]}} are often preserved only because they were written on spare sheets in religious [[codex|codices]].

The earliest Old High German text is generally taken to be the [[Abrogans]], a Latin–Old High German glossary variously dated between 750 and 780, probably from [[Vulgar Latin#Vocabulary|Reichenau]]. The 8th century [[Merseburg Incantations]] are the only remnant of [[Germanic paganism|pre-Christian]] German literature. The earliest texts not dependent on Latin originals would seem to be the {{lang|de|Hildebrandslied}} and the [[Wessobrunn Prayer]], both recorded in manuscripts of the early 9th century, though the texts are assumed to derive from earlier copies.

The Bavarian ''[[Muspilli]]'' is the sole survivor of what must have been a vast oral tradition. Other important works are the {{lang|de|Evangelienbuch}} ([[Diatessaron|Gospel harmony]]) of [[Otfrid of Weissenburg|Otfrid von Weissenburg]], the short but splendid {{lang|de|[[Ludwigslied]]}} and the 9th century {{lang|de|[[Georgslied]]}}. The boundary to Early Middle High German (from {{circa|1050}}) is not clear-cut.

An example of Early Middle High German literature is the {{lang|de|[[Annolied]]}}.

==Example Texts==
The [[Lord's Prayer]] is given in four Old High German dialects below. Because these are translations of a liturgical text, they are best not regarded as examples of idiomatic language, but they do show dialect variation very clearly.

'''[[Old World]] [[wine]]''' refers primarily to wine made in [[Europe]] but can also include other regions of the [[Mediterranean basin]] with long [[history of wine|histories of winemaking]] such as [[North Africa]] and the [[Near East]]. The phrase is often used in contrast to "[[New World wine]]" which refers primarily to wines from [[New World]] wine regions such as the [[United States (wine)|United States]], [[Australia (wine)|Australia]], [[South America]] and [[South Africa (wine)|South Africa]]. The term "Old World wine" does not refer to a [[homogeneous]] style with "Old World wine regions" like [[Austria (wine)|Austria]], [[France (wine)|France]], [[Italy (wine)|Italy]], [[Portugal (wine)|Portugal]], and [[Spain (wine)|Spain]] each making vastly different styles of wine even within their own borders. Rather, the term is used to describe general differences in [[viticulture]] and [[winemaking]] philosophies between the Old World regions where tradition and the role of ''[[terroir]]'' lead versus the New World where science and the role of the winemaker are more often emphasized. In recent times, the [[globalization of wine]] and advent of [[flying winemaker]]s have lessened the distinction between the two terms with winemakers in one region being able to produce wines that can display the traits of the other region—i.e. an "Old World style" wine being produced in a New World wine region like [[California (wine)|California]] or [[Chile (wine)|Chile]] and vice versa.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 493"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 493 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Old World" can also mean a wine style made for centuries by small winemakers intended to be consumed as a daily beverage to accompany a meal. These food and wine "pairings," so famous today (e.g. Chianti and Italian food) developed over generations by trial and error.  The small village winemaker succeeded or failed on his wine's reputation as an acceptable "table" wine, be it highly expensive or budget priced. 

By comparison, "New World" wines, while also being food friendly, are created to meet the tastes of contemporary wine drinkers.  Contemporary wine drinkers, especially those in the large U.S. market, consume wine as a stand alone beverage as much as a beverage to accompany a meal. Thus, the immediate "taste" is the overwhelming criteria by which a new-world wine is judged by the contemporary wine consumer.

==Influences==
[[file:Montrachet vineyards.jpg|left|thumb|250px|In Old World winemaking, the ''terroir'' of a region is of paramount importance with wines from a region, such as [[Montrachet]] ''(pictured)'', being labeled with the region's name rather than the grape variety (such as Chardonnay).]]
{{See also|terroir}}
The two most guiding influences of Old World style winemaking are that of [[tradition]] and ''terroir''. The former refers to the long history of a wine region, while the latter refers to geography and the unique characteristics of a place. The centuries-old histories of many Old World wine regions have given the regions time to develop and adapt techniques that presumably best suit a particular vine growing area. These can include which [[grape varieties]] to plant, [[trellising methods]], maximum permitted [[yield (wine)|yield]]s, as well as winemaking techniques. Over time, these traditional practices became enshrined in local regulations such as the French ''[[Appellation d'origine contrôlée]]'' (AOC), Italian ''[[Denominazione di origine controllata]]'' (DOC), Spanish ''[[Denominación de Origen]]'' (DO) and Portuguese ''[[Denominação de Origem Controlada]]'' (DOC) laws.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 693-695 &amp; 706"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 693-695 &amp; 706 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Terroir'' is often used to describe the aspects of a wine region such as soil, climate and [[topography]] that are often out of the winemaker's control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Fraga|first1=Helder|last2=Malheiro|first2=Aureliano C.|last3=Moutinho-Pereira|first3=José|last4=Cardoso|first4=Rita M.|last5=Soares|first5=Pedro M. M.|last6=Cancela|first6=Javier J.|last7=Pinto|first7=Joaquim G.|last8=Santos|first8=João A.|last9=Álvarez|first9=Inés| displayauthors = 8|title=Integrated Analysis of Climate, Soil, Topography and Vegetative Growth in Iberian Viticultural Regions|journal=PLoS ONE|date=24 September 2014|volume=9|issue=9|pages=e108078|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0108078|pmid=25251495|pmc=4176712}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the unique attributes that, theoretically, make a [[Sangiovese]] based wine from [[Chianti]] taste different from a Sangiovese-based wine made anywhere else in the world even if exactly the same winemaking techniques are used. While wines in the New World are often labeled based on the [[varietal]] (such as [[Chardonnay]] or [[Tempranillo]]), wines in the Old World are generally labeled based on the region or place that they come from (such as [[Montrachet]] or [[Ribera del Duero]]). This is because Old World winemakers believe that the unique ''terroir''-driven characteristics of where a wine comes from plays a more distinct role in shaping the resulting wine than the grape variety itself.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 693-695 &amp; 706"/&gt;

==Viticulture==
Viticulture in most of the Old World wine regions dates back to several hundred or even thousands of years with the [[Phoenicians (wine)|Phoenicians]], [[Greeks (wine)|Greeks]], [[Thracians]] and [[Romans (wine)|Romans]] establishing some of the earliest vineyards. Over centuries, these Old World wine regions have developed viticultural techniques and practices adapted around their unique climates and landscapes. Many of these practices are enshrined in local [[wine law]]s and regulations such as the French ''Appellation d'origine contrôlée'' (AOC) regulations. One distinction between an Old World vineyard and a New World vineyard is generally the high [[vine density]] and close proximity of plantings in the Old World, which were often planted years before the use of [[mechanical agriculture]] became popular. In regions such as [[Bordeaux (wine)|Bordeaux]], vines were often planted {{convert|1|m|ft|0}} apart in rows that were also separated by {{convert|1|m|ft|0}} with spacing that was sufficient for [[pruning]] and [[harvesting (wine)|harvesting]] being done manually. In New World wine regions like Australia, which was quick to adopt mechanical techniques, vines were often planted apart {{convert|3.7|m|ft|0}} by {{convert|2.5|m|ft|0}}. While spacing between vine rows has shrunk in many Old World wine regions began adopting mechanical techniques in the late 20th century, some regions are still characterized by the high density of vines in their vineyards.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 476-477"&gt;J. Robinson (ed) ''"The Oxford Companion to Wine"'' Third Edition  pg 476-477 Oxford University Press 2006 {{ISBN|0-19-860990-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Winemaking==
[[File:Sylvestre Ein guter Tropfen.jpg|right|thumb|200px|In Old World wine making, the role of the winemaker is minimized compared to New World wine making.]]
Old World winemaking is often ''terroir'' driven with emphasis being placed on how well the wine communicates the sense of place where it originated. For example, a winemaker making a [[Riesling]] from the [[Mosel (wine)|Mosel]] will often try to highlight the unique traits of the Mosel wine region (such as its [[slate]] soils) with the wine expressing those traits in the form of [[minerality]]. In the New World, emphasis is often placed on the winemaker and the techniques used to bring out the fruit flavors of a wine (a style known as "[[fruit driven]]"). New World winemakers tend to be more open to experimenting with new scientific advances (such as the use of [[enzyme]]s as an additive) while the ''terroir'' influence of Old World winemakers will often attempt to downplay the role of the winemaker and avoid techniques that may mask or distort the expression of ''terroir''. Old World winemakers tend to be more open to use of wild, ambient [[yeast (wine)|yeast]] during the [[fermentation (wine)|fermentation]] process as a part of the ''terroir'' while New World winemakers tend to favor cultured yeast strains.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 476-477"/&gt;

Other techniques associated with Old World winemakers include higher fermentation temperatures and a period of extended [[maceration (wine)|maceration]] following fermentation where the wine can leech more [[phenolic compounds (wine)|phenolic compounds]] from the grape skins. This can create more [[tannin (wine)|tannic]] and austere wines with more layers of complexity that require longer periods of bottle aging in order to mature. In contrast, the technique of transferring the must into [[oak (wine)|oak barrel]]s during fermentation and inducing [[malolactic fermentation]] early is more commonly associated with New World wine regions and wines that are softer and mature earlier.&lt;ref name="Oxford pg 476-477"/&gt;

==Regions==
European and Middle Eastern wine regions with a long history of viticulture are typically classified as "Old World".&lt;ref&gt;Sip Sherwin Lao ''"[http://www.manilastandardtoday.com/?page=goodLife2_oct9_2007 Old World vs. New World wines]"'', Manila Standard Today, October 9th 2007&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

'''Packet telephony''' is the use of personal computers and a packet data network to produce a voice conversation. It consists of [[telephony]] and [[data]] tightly coupled on [[packet (information technology)|packet]]-based switched multimedia networks.

The goal of packet switched fabric in both [[Local area network|LAN]] and [[Wide area network|WAN]], the vision in to drive voice and data over a single [[multimedia]] (packet based N/W) allowing waves to engage in a media rich [[communication]] in a natural and straightforward manner.

The packet and based fabric is capable of supporting future applications such as [[Streaming media|video streaming]] and [[video conferencing]]. The transaction to a new [[paradigm]] will take years to complete. However [[technology]] matures and new application proliferate packet technology will appear in broader market. There is a major distinction between [[Intranet]] [[telephony]] and [[VoIP]].

[[Image:Poesia Garros.jpg|thumb|Title page of the ''Poesias Gasconas'']]

'''Pey de Garros''' ([[Gascon dialect|modern Gascon]]: ''Pèir de Garròs''; 1530-1585), was the most important [[Occitan]] poet of the [[Renaissance]]. He was instrumental in the evolution of the Gascon dialect into a [[literary language]].

Garros was born at [[Lectoure]], [[Gascony]]. He studied law, theology, and [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] at the [[University of Toulouse]] and served as the ''avocat-général'' of [[Pau, Pyrénées-Atlantiques|Pau]] for a time. He strove to restore the Gascon dialect to prominence, translating the [[Psalms]] into Gascon in 1565, as well as publishing a volume of poetry (''Poesias Gasconas'') in 1567. 

The translation was ordered by Queen [[Jeanne d'Albret]], who decreed Calvinism to be the official faith in the [[Kingdom of Navarre]], as well as commissioning [[Arnaud de Salette]] to produce a distinct [[Béarnese dialect|Béarnese]] translation of the Psalms.

Garros died in Pau.

'''Qwara''', or '''Qwareña''' (called "Falasha" (Hwarasa) in some older sources), was one of two [[Agaw languages|Agaw dialects]], spoken by a subgroup of the [[Beta Israel]] ([[Ethiopia]]n [[Jew]]s) of the [[Qwara Province|Qwara]] area. It is a dialect of [[Qimant language|Qimant]]. It is nearly extinct.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}} Several early Falashan manuscripts, using the [[Ge'ez alphabet]], exist; in more recent times, the language has been recorded by several linguists and travellers, starting with Flad in 1866.

The language was on the decline in the early 20th  century, as it was being replaced by [[Amharic language|Amharic]]. During [[Operation Solomon]], most of its remaining speakers were airlifted to [[Israel]], where it continues to lose ground to [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]].

The process of Persianization accelerated in the 13th century with the presence in Konya of two of the most distinguished refugees fleeing before the Mongols, Bahā' al-Dīn Walad and his son Mawlānā Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī, whose Mathnawī, composed in Konya, constitutes one of the crowning glories of classical Persian literature."&lt;/ref&gt; His works are widely read today in their original language across [[Greater Iran]] and the Persian-speaking world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/Interview_Many_Americans_Love_RumiBut_They_Prefer_He_Not_Be_Muslim/2122973.html|title=Interview: 'Many Americans Love Rumi...But They Prefer He Not Be Muslim'|date=2010-08-09|newspaper=RadioFreeEurope/RadioLiberty|language=English|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.atimes.com/atimes/Middle_East/LH14Ak01.html|title=Interview: A mystical journey with Rumi|last=|first=|date=|website=Asia Times|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Translations of his works are very popular, most notably in [[Turkey]], [[Azerbaijan]], the United States, and South Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omifacsimiles.com/brochures/divan.html|title=Dîvân-i Kebîr Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī|last=|first=|date=|website=OMI – Old Manuscripts &amp; Incunabula|publisher=|access-date=2016-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; His poetry has influenced not only [[Persian literature]], but also [[Turkish literature|Turkish]], [[Ottoman Turkish language|Ottoman Turkish]], [[Azerbaijani literature|Azerbaijani]], as well as the literature of some other [[Turkic languages|Turkic]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]], and [[Indo-Aryan languages]] including [[Chagatai language|Chagatai]], [[Urdu]] and [[Pashto language|Pashto]].

== Name ==
He is most commonly called ''Rumi'' in English. His full name is ''Jalāl ad-Dīn Muḥammad Balkhī'' ({{lang-fa|جلال‌الدین محمد بلخى}}) or ''Jalāl ad-Dīn Muḥammad Rūmī'' ({{lang|fa|جلال‌الدین محمد رومی}}). ''Jalal ad-Din'' is an [[Arabic]] name meaning "Glory of the Faith". ''Balkhī'' and ''Rūmī'' are his ''[[Nisba (onomastics)|nisbas]]'', meaning "from [[Balkh]]" and "from [[Rûm]]" ([[Roman Anatolia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rumi|title=Selected Poems |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rKbpCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT350 |year=2015 |publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=978-0-14-196911-4|page=350}}&lt;/ref&gt;), respectively. According to the authoritative Rumi biographer [[Franklin Lewis]] of the [[University of Chicago]], "[t]he Anatolian peninsula which had belonged to the Byzantine, or eastern Roman empire, had only relatively recently been conquered by Muslims and even when it came to be controlled by Turkish Muslim rulers, it was still known to Arabs, Persians and Turks as the geographical area of Rum. As such, there are a number of historical personages born in or associated with Anatolia known as Rumi, a word borrowed from Arabic literally meaning 'Roman,' in which context Roman refers to subjects of the [[Byzantine Empire]] or simply to people living in or things associated with [[Anatolia]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Franklin Lewis|title=Rumi: Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi|publisher= One World Publication Limited|year= 2008|page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is widely known by the sobriquet ''Mawlānā''/''Molānā''&lt;ref name="EI" /&gt;&lt;ref name="encyclopaedia1991"&gt;H. Ritter, 1991, ''DJALĀL al-DĪN RŪMĪ'', ''[[The Encyclopaedia of Islam]]'' (Volume II: C–G), 393.&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-fa|مولانا}} {{IPA-fa|moulɒːnɒ}}) in [[Iran]] and popularly known as {{lang|tr|Mevlânâ}} in Turkey. ''Mawlānā'' ({{lang|ar|مولانا|rtl=yes}}) is a term of [[Arabic]] origin, meaning "our master".

The term {{lang|fa|مولوی}} ''Mawlawī''/''Mowlavi'' (Persian) and {{lang|tr|Mevlevi}} (Turkish), also of Arabic origin, meaning "my master", is also frequently used for him.&lt;ref&gt;Jalāl al-Dīn Rūmī (Maulana), Ibrahim Gamard, "Rumi and Islam: Selections from His Stories, Poems, and Discourses, Annotated &amp; Explained", SkyLight Paths Publishing, February 1, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumi was born to native Persian-speaking parents,&lt;ref name="Annemarie Schimmel"&gt;Annemarie Schimmel, The Triumphal Sun: A Study of the Works of Jalaloddin Rumi, SUNY Press, 1993, p. 193: "Rumi's mother tongue was Persian, but he had learned during his stay in Konya, enough Turkish and Greek to use it, now and then, in his verse."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Franklin Lewis"&gt;Franklin Lewis: "On the question of Rumi's multilingualism (pages 315–17), we may still say that he spoke and wrote in Persian as a native language, wrote and conversed in Arabic as a learned "foreign" language and could at least get by at the market in Turkish and Greek (although some wildly extravagant claims have been made about his command of Attic Greek, or his native tongue being Turkish) (Lewis 2008:xxi). (Franklin Lewis, "Rumi: Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi," One World Publication Limited, 2008).
Franklin also points out that: "Living among Turks, Rumi also picked up some colloquial Turkish."(Franklin Lewis, "Rumi: Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi," One World Publication Limited, 2008, p. 315). He also mentions Rumi composed thirteen lines in Greek (Franklin Lewis, ''Rumi: Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi'', One World Publication Limited, 2008, p. 316). On Rumi's son, Sultan Walad, Franklin mentions: "[[Sultan Walad]] elsewhere admits that he has little knowledge of Turkish" (Sultan Walad): Franklin Lewis, ''Rumi, "Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi'', One World Publication Limited, 2008, p. 239) and
"Sultan Valad did not feel confident about his command of Turkish" (Franklin Lewis, ''Rumi: Past and Present, East and West'', Oneworld Publications, 2000, p. 240)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nasr2"&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''Islamic Art and Spirituality'', SUNY Press, 1987. p. 115: "Jalal al-Din was born in a major center of Persian culture, Balkh, from Persian speaking parents, and is the product of that Islamic Persian culture which in the 7th/13th century dominated the 'whole of the eastern lands of Islam and to which present day Persians as well as Turks, Afghans, Central Asian Muslims and the Muslims of the Indo-Pakistani and the Muslims of the Indo-Pakistani subcontinent are heir. It is precisely in this world that the sun of his spiritual legacy has shone most brilliantly during the past seven centuries. The father of Jalal al-Din, Muhammad ibn Husayn Khatibi, known as [[Baha al-Din Walad]] and entitled [[Sultan al-'ulama']], was an outstanding Sufi in Balkh connected to the spiritual lineage of [[Najm al-Din Kubra]]."&lt;/ref&gt; originally from the [[Balkh]], in present-day [[Afghanistan]]. He was born either in [[Vakhsh, Tajikistan|Wakhsh]],&lt;ref name="Balkh"&gt;[[Annemarie Schimmel]], "I Am Wind, You Are Fire," p. 11. She refers to a 1989 article by Fritz Meier:{{Quote|Tajiks and Persian admirers still prefer to call Jalaluddin 'Balkhi' because his family lived in Balkh, current day in [[Afghanistan]] before migrating westward. However, their home was not in the actual city of Balkh, since the mid-eighth century a center of Muslim culture in (Greater) Khorasan (Iran and Central Asia). Rather, as Meier has shown, it was in the small town of Wakhsh north of the Oxus that Baha'uddin Walad, Jalaluddin's father, lived and worked as a jurist and preacher with mystical inclinations. Franklin Lewis, ''Rumi&amp;nbsp;: Past and Present, East and West: The Life, Teachings, and Poetry of Jalâl al-Din Rumi'', 2000, pp. 47–49.}} Lewis has devoted two pages of his book to the topic of Wakhsh, which he states has been identified with the medieval town of Lêwkand (or Lâvakand) or Sangtude, which is about 65 kilometers southeast of Dushanbe, the capital of present-day Tajikistan. He says it is on the east bank of the Vakhshâb river, a major tributary that joins the Amu Daryâ river (also called Jayhun, and named the Oxus by the Greeks). He further states: "Bahâ al-Din may have been born in Balkh, but at least between June 1204 and 1210 (Shavvâl 600 and 607), during which time Rumi was born, Bahâ al-Din resided in a house in Vakhsh (Bah 2:143 [= Bahâ' uddîn Walad's] book, "Ma`ârif."). Vakhsh, rather than Balkh was the permanent base of Bahâ al-Din and his family until Rumi was around five years old (mei 16–35) [= from a book in German by the scholar Fritz Meier—note inserted here]. At that time, in about the year 1212 (A.H. 608–609), the Valads moved to Samarqand (Fih 333; Mei 29–30, 36) [= reference to Rumi's "Discourses" and to Fritz Meier's book—note inserted here], leaving behind Baâ al-Din's mother, who must have been at least seventy-five years old."&lt;/ref&gt; a village on the [[Vakhsh River]] in present-day [[Tajikistan]],&lt;ref name="Balkh" /&gt; or in the city of Balkh, in present-day Afghanistan.&lt;ref name="UNESCO" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UNESDOC" /&gt;

Greater Balkh was at that time a major centre of Persian culture&lt;ref name="C.E. Bosworth p. 391" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nasr2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Franklin D. Lewis, ''Rumi: Past and Present, East and West: The life, Teaching and poetry of Jalal Al-Din Rumi'', Oneworld Publication Limited, 2008 p. 9: "How is that a Persian boy born almost eight hundred years ago in Khorasan, the northeastern province of greater Iran, in a region that we identify today as Central Asia, but was considered in those days as part of the greater Persian cultural sphere, wound up in central Anatolia on the receding edge of the Byzantine cultural sphere"&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Sufism]] had developed there for several centuries. The most important influences upon Rumi, besides his father, were the Persian poets [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]] and [[Sanai]].&lt;ref&gt;Maqsood Jafrī, ''The gleam of wisdom'', Sigma Press, 2003. p. 238: "Rumi has influenced a large number of writers while on the other hand he himself was under the great influence of Sanai and Attar.&lt;/ref&gt; Rumi expresses his appreciation: "Attar was the spirit, Sanai his eyes twain, And in time thereafter, Came we in their train"&lt;ref&gt;A. J. Arberry, ''Sufism: An Account of the Mystics of Islam'', Courier Dover Publications, Nov 9, 2001. p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; and mentions in another poem: "Attar has traversed the seven cities of Love, We are still at the turn of one street".&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, ''The Garden of Truth: The Vision and Promise of Sufism, Islam's Mystical Tradition'' HarperCollins, Sep 2, 2008. page 130: "Attar has traversed the seven cities of Love, We are still at the turn of one street!"&lt;/ref&gt; His father was also connected to the spiritual lineage of Najm al-Din Kubra.&lt;ref name="Nasr1" /&gt;

Rumi lived most of his life under the [[Persianate society|Persianate]]&lt;ref&gt;Grousset, Rene, ''The Empire of the Steppes: A History of Central Asia'', (Rutgers University Press, 2002), 157; "...the Seljuk court at Konya adopted Persian as its official language".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aḥmad of Niǧde's "al-Walad al-Shafīq" and the Seljuk Past, A.

Peacock, Anatolian Studies, Vol. 54, (2004), 97; With the growth of Seljuk power in Rum, a more highly developed Muslim cultural life, based on the Persianate culture of the Great Seljuk court, was able to take root in Anatolia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Carter Vaughn Findley, ''The Turks in World History'', Oxford University Press, Nov 11, 2004. p. 72: Meanwhile, amid the migratory swarm that Turkified Anatolia, the dispersion of learned men from the Persian-speaking east paradoxically made the Seljuks court at Konya a new center for Persian court culture, as exemplified by the great mystical poet Jelaleddin Rumi (1207–73).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Seljuk dynasty|Seljuk]] [[Sultanate of Rum]], where he produced his works&lt;ref&gt;[[Coleman Barks|Barks, Coleman]], ''Rumi: The Book of Love: Poems of Ecstasy and Longing'', HarperCollins, 2005, p. xxv, {{ISBN|978-0-06-075050-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; and died in 1273{{nbsp}}AD. He was buried in [[Konya]], and his shrine became a place of pilgrimage.&lt;ref&gt;Note: Rumi's shrine is now known as the "Mevlâna Museum" in Turkey.&lt;/ref&gt; Upon his death, his followers and his son [[Sultan Walad]] founded the [[Mevlevi Order]], also known as the Order of the Whirling Dervishes, famous for the [[Sufi dance]] known as the [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]] ceremony. He was laid to rest beside his father, and over his remains a shrine was erected. A hagiographical account of him is described in Shams ud-Din Ahmad Aflāki's ''Manāqib ul-Ārifīn'' (written between 1318 and 1353). This biography needs to be treated with care as it contains both legends and facts about Rumi.&lt;ref name=howisit&gt;Franklin Lewis, ''Rumi: Past and Present, East and West'', Oneworld Publications, 2000.{{Quote|How is it that a Persian boy born almost eight hundred years ago in Khorasan, the northeastern province of greater Iran, in a region that we identify today as Central Asia, but was considered in those days as part of the Greater Persian cultural sphere, wound up in Central Anatolia on the receding edge of the Byzantine cultural sphere, in which is now Turkey}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, Professor [[Franklin Lewis]] of the University of Chicago, author of the most complete biography on Rumi, has separate sections for the hagiographical biography of Rumi and the actual biography about him.&lt;ref name="hagiographer1" /&gt;

Rumi's father was [[:ru:Баха ад-Дин Валад|Bahā ud-Dīn Walad]], a theologian, jurist and a [[mysticism|mystic]] from Balkh, who was also known by the followers of Rumi as Sultan al-Ulama or "Sultan of the Scholars". The popular hagiographical assertions that have claimed the family's descent from the Caliph [[Abu Bakr]] does not hold on closer examination and is rejected by modern scholars.&lt;ref name="hagiographer1"&gt;Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2008 (revised edition). pp. 90–92: "Baha al-Din’s disciples also traced his family lineage to the first caliph, Abu Bakr (Sep 9; Af 7; JNO 457; Dow 213). This probably stems from willful confusion over his paternal great grandmother, who was the daughter of Abu Bakr of Sarakhs, a noted jurist (d. 1090). The most complete genealogy offered for family stretches back only six or seven generations and cannot reach to Abu Bakr, the companion and first caliph of the Prophet, who died two years after the Prophet, in C.E. 634 (FB 5–6 n.3)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hagiographer2"&gt;H.

There is no reference to such descent in the works of Bahāʾ-e Walad and Mawlānā Jalāl-al-Dīn or in the inscriptions on their sarcophagi. The attribution may have arisen from confusion between the caliph and another Abū Bakr, Šams-al-Aʾemma Abū Bakr Saraḵsī (d. 483/1090), the well-known Hanafite jurist, whose daughter, Ferdows Ḵātūn, was the mother of Aḥmad Ḵaṭīb, Bahāʾ-e Walad’s grandfather (see Forūzānfar, Resāla, p. 6). Tradition also links Bahāʾ-e Walad’s lineage to the Ḵᵛārazmšāh dynasty. His mother is said to have been the daughter of ʿAlāʾ-al-Dīn Moḥammad Ḵārazmšāh (d. 596/1200), but this appears to be excluded for chronological reasons (Forūzānfar, Resāla, p. 7)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hagiographer3"&gt;(Ritter, H.; Bausani, A.

We do not learn the name of Baha al-Din's mother in the sources, only that he referred to her as "Māmi" (colloquial Persian for Māma),&lt;ref name="hagiographer4"&gt;Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2008 (revised edition). p. 44:“Baha al-Din’s father, Hosayn, had been a religious scholar with a bent for asceticism, occupied like his own father before him, Ahmad, with the family profession of preacher (khatib). Of the four canonical schools of Sunni Islam, the family adhered to the relatively liberal [[Hanafi]] [[fiqh]]. Hosayn-e Khatibi enjoyed such renown in his youth—so says Aflaki with characteristic exaggeration—that Razi al-Din Nayshapuri and other famous scholars came to study with him (Af 9; for the legend about Baha al-Din, see below, “The Mythical Baha al-Din”). Another report indicates that Baha al-Din’s grandfather, Ahmad al-Khatibi, was born to Ferdows Khatun, a daughter of the reputed Hanafite jurist and author Shams al-A’emma Abu Bakr of Sarakhs, who died circa 1088 (Af 75; FB 6 n.4; Mei 74 n. 17). This is far from implausible and, if true, would tend to suggest that Ahmad al-Khatabi had studied under Shams al-A’emma. Prior to that the family could supposedly trace its roots back to Isfahan. We do not learn the name of Baha al-Din’s mother in the sources, only that he referred to her as “Mama” (Mami), and that she lived to the 1200s.” (p. 44)&lt;/ref&gt; and that she was a simple woman who lived to the 1200s. The mother of Rumi was Mu'mina Khātūn. The profession of the family for several generations was that of Islamic preachers of the liberal [[Hanafi]] rite, and this family tradition was continued by Rumi (see his Fihi Ma Fih and Seven Sermons) and [[Sultan Walad]] (see Ma'rif Waladi for examples of his everyday sermons and lectures).

When the [[Mongol]]s invaded [[Central Asia]] sometime between 1215 and 1220, Baha ud-Din Walad, with his whole family and a group of disciples, set out westwards. According to hagiographical account which is not agreed upon by all Rumi scholars, Rumi encountered one of the most famous mystic Persian poets, [[Attar of Nishapur|Attar]], in the Iranian city of [[Nishapur]], located in the province of Khorāsān. Attar immediately recognized Rumi's spiritual eminence. He saw the father walking ahead of the son and said, "Here comes a sea followed by an ocean."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Suspended Somewhere Between: A Book of Verse|last=Ahmed|first=Akbar|publisher=PM Press|year=2011|isbn=978-1-60486-485-4|location=|pages=i}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mevlana Celaleddin Rumi|last=El-Fers|first=Mohamed|publisher=MokumTV|year=2009|isbn=978-1-4092-9291-3|location=|pages=45}}&lt;/ref&gt; He gave the boy his ''Asrārnāma'', a book about the entanglement of the soul in the material world. This meeting had a deep impact on the eighteen-year-old Rumi and later on became the inspiration for his works.

From Nishapur, Walad and his entourage set out for [[Baghdad]], meeting many of the scholars and Sufis of the city.&lt;ref&gt;Ahmed, Nazeer, ''Islam in Global History: From the Death of Prophet Muhammed to the First World War'', p.58, Xlibris Corporation (2000), {{ISBN|978-0-7388-5962-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=December 2017}} From Baghdad they went to [[Hejaz]] and performed the [[Hajj|pilgrimage]] at [[Mecca]]. The migrating caravan then passed through [[Damascus]], [[Malatya]], [[Erzincan]], [[Sivas]], [[Kayseri]] and [[Nigde]]. They finally settled in [[Karaman]] for seven years; Rumi's mother and brother both died there. In 1225, Rumi married Gowhar Khatun in Karaman. They had two sons: [[Sultan Walad]] and Ala-eddin Chalabi. When his wife died, Rumi married again and had a son, Amir Alim Chalabi, and a daughter, Malakeh Khatun.

On 1 May 1228, most likely as a result of the insistent invitation of [[Kayqubad I|'Alā' ud-Dīn Key-Qobād]], ruler of Anatolia, Baha' ud-Din came and finally settled in Konya in [[Anatolia]] within the westernmost territories of the [[Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm]].

Baha' ud-Din became the head of a [[madrassa]] (religious school) and when he died, Rumi, aged twenty-five, inherited his position as the Islamic molvi. One of Baha' ud-Din's students, Sayyed Burhan ud-Din Muhaqqiq Termazi, continued to train Rumi in the [[Shariah]] as well as the [[Tariqa]], especially that of Rumi's father. For nine years, Rumi practised Sufism as a disciple of Burhan ud-Din until the latter died in 1240 or 1241. Rumi's public life then began: he became an Islamic Jurist, issuing [[fatwas]] and giving sermons in the mosques of Konya. He also served as a Molvi (Islamic teacher) and taught his adherents in the madrassa.

During this period, Rumi also travelled to [[Damascus]] and is said to have spent four years there.

It was his meeting with the dervish [[Shams-e Tabrizi]] on 15 November 1244 that completely changed his life. From an accomplished teacher and jurist, Rumi was transformed into an ascetic.

Shams had travelled throughout the Middle East searching and praying for someone who could "endure my company". A voice said to him, "What will you give in return?" Shams replied, "My head!" The voice then said, "The one you seek is Jalal ud-Din of Konya." On the night of 5 December 1248, as Rumi and Shams were talking, Shams was called to the back door. He went out, never to be seen again. It is rumoured that Shams was murdered with the connivance of Rumi's son, 'Ala' ud-Din; if so, Shams indeed gave his head for the privilege of mystical friendship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.semazen.net/eng/show_text_main.php?id=166&amp;menuId=17|title=Hz. Mawlana and Shams|work=semazen.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumi's love for, and his bereavement at the death of, Shams found their expression in an outpouring of lyric poems, [[Diwan-e Shams-e Tabrizi|''Divan-e Shams-e Tabrizi'']]. He himself went out searching for Shams and journeyed again to Damascus. There, he realised:
{{quote|
Why should I seek? I am the same as&lt;br /&gt;
He. His essence speaks through me.&lt;br /&gt;
I have been looking for myself!&lt;ref&gt;''The Essential Rumi''. Translations by Coleman Barks, p. xx.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Mewlana had been spontaneously composing ''[[ghazal]]s'' (Persian poems), and these had been collected in the ''Divan-i Kabir'' or Diwan Shams Tabrizi. Rumi found another companion in Salaḥ ud-Din-e Zarkub, a goldsmith. After Salah ud-Din's death, Rumi's scribe and favourite student, Hussam-e Chalabi, assumed the role of Rumi's companion. One day, the two of them were wandering through the Meram vineyards outside Konya when Hussam described to Rumi an idea he had had: "If you were to write a book like the ''Ilāhīnāma'' of Sanai or the ''Mantiq ut-Tayr'' of 'Attar, it would become the companion of many troubadours. They would fill their hearts from your work and compose music to accompany it." Rumi smiled and took out a piece of paper on which were written the opening eighteen lines of his ''Masnavi'', beginning with:

{{quote|
Listen to the reed and the tale it tells,&lt;br /&gt;
How it sings of separation...&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Camille |last=Helminski| title=Introduction to Rumi: Daylight | url = http://www.sufism.org/books/dayex.html|accessdate=2007-05-06|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110716155558/http://www.sufism.org/books/dayex.html |archivedate = July 16, 2011|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

Hussam implored Rumi to write more. Rumi spent the next twelve years of his life in Anatolia dictating the six volumes of this masterwork, the ''Masnavi'', to Hussam.

In December 1273, Rumi fell ill; he predicted his own death and composed the well-known ''ghazal'', which begins with the verse:

{{quote|
How doest thou know what sort of king I have within me as companion?&lt;br /&gt;

}}

Rumi died on 17 December 1273 in [[Konya]]; his body was interred beside that of his father, and a splendid shrine, the ''Yeşil Türbe'' (Green Tomb, قبه الخضراء; today the [[Mevlana Museum|Mevlâna Museum]]), was erected over his place of burial. His epitaph reads:

Georgian Queen [[Gürcü Hatun]] was a close friend of Rumi. She was the one who sponsored the construction of [[Mevlana Museum|his tomb]] in [[Konya]].&lt;ref&gt;H.

Jalal al-Din who is also known as Rumi, was a philosopher and mystic of Islam.

The general theme of Rumi's thought, like that of other mystic and Sufi poets of Persian literature, is that of ''[[tawhid]]''&amp;nbsp;— union with the Beloved, from whom he sees himself as being cut off and aloof. His longing and desire to attain it is evident in the following poem from his book the [[Masnavi]]:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/n-III-3901.html|title=The Mathnawî-yé Ma`nawî – Rhymed Couplets of Deep Spiritual Meaning of Jalaluddin Rumi. |author=Ibrahim Gamard (with gratitude for R.

Rumi believed passionately in the use of music, poetry and dance as a path for reaching God. For Rumi, music helped devotees to focus their whole being on the divine and to do this so intensely that the soul was both destroyed and resurrected. It was from these ideas that the practice of [[Sufi whirling|whirling Dervishes]] developed into a ritual form. His teachings became the base for the order of the Mevlevi, which his son Sultan Walad organised. Rumi encouraged [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]], listening to music and turning or doing the sacred dance. In the Mevlevi tradition, ''samāʿ'' represents a mystical journey of spiritual ascent through mind and love to the Perfect One. In this journey, the seeker symbolically turns towards the truth, grows through love, abandons the ego, finds the truth and arrives at the Perfect. The seeker then returns from this spiritual journey, with greater maturity, to love and to be of service to the whole of creation without discrimination with regard to beliefs, races, classes and nations.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In other verses in the ''Masnavi'', Rumi describes in detail the universal message of love:

Rumi's poetry is often divided into various categories: the quatrains (''[[Ruba'i|rubayāt]]'') and odes (''[[ghazal]]'') of the ''Divan'', the six books of the ''Masnavi''. The prose works are divided into The Discourses, The Letters, and the ''Seven Sermons''.

Nicholson’s text has 25,577 lines though the average medieval and early modern manuscripts contained around 27,000 lines, meaning the scribes added two thousand lines or about eight percent more to the poem composed by Rumi. Some manuscripts give as many as 32,000!"&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prose works ===
* [[Fihi ma fihi|''Fihi Ma Fihi'']] (''In It What's in It'', Persian: فیه ما فیه) provides a record of seventy-one talks and lectures given by Rumi on various occasions to his disciples. It was compiled from the notes of his various disciples, so Rumi did not author the work directly.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Lewis, ''Rumi: Past and Present, East and West&amp;nbsp;— The Life, Teachings, and Poetry of Jalal al-Din Rumi'', Oneworld Publications, 2000, Chapter 7.&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation from the Persian was first published by [[A.J. Arberry]] as ''Discourses of Rumi'' (New York: Samuel Weiser, 1972), and a translation of the second book by Wheeler Thackston, ''Sign of the Unseen'' (Putney, VT: Threshold Books, 1994). The style of the ''Fihi ma fihi'' is colloquial and meant for middle-class men and women, and lack the sophisticated wordplay.&lt;ref&gt;“As Safa points out (Saf 2:1206) the Discourse reflect the stylistics of oral speech and lack the sophisticated word plays, Arabic vocabulary and sound patterning that we would except from a consciously literary text of this period. Once again, the style of Rumi as lecturer or orator in these discourses does not reflect an audience of great intellectual pretensions, but rather middle-class men and women, along with number of statesmen and rulers”” (Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2008 (revised edition). p. 292)&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Majāles-e Sab'a'' (''Seven Sessions'', Persian: {{lang|fa|مجالس سبعه}}) contains seven Persian sermons (as the name implies) or lectures given in seven different assemblies. The sermons themselves give a commentary on the deeper meaning of Qur'an and [[Hadith]]. The sermons also include quotations from poems of [[Sana'i]], [[Attar of Nishapur|'Attar]], and other poets, including Rumi himself. As Aflakī relates, after Shams-e Tabrīzī, Rumi gave sermons at the request of notables, especially Salāh al-Dīn Zarkūb. The style of Persian is rather simple, but quotation of Arabic and knowledge of history and the Hadith show Rumi's knowledge in the Islamic sciences. His style is typical of the genre of lectures given by Sufis and spiritual teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2008 (revised edition). p. 293&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Makatib'' (''The Letters'', Persian: مکاتیب) is the book containing Rumi's letters in Persian to his disciples, family members, and men of state and of influence. The letters testify that Rumi kept very busy helping family members and administering a community of disciples that had grown up around them. Unlike the Persian style of the previous two mentioned works (which are lectures and sermons), the letters are consciously sophisticated and epistolary in style, which is in conformity with the expectations of correspondence directed to nobles, statesmen and kings.&lt;ref&gt;Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2008 (revised edition). p. 295:“In contrast with the prose of his Discourses and sermons, the style of the letters is consciously sophisticated and epistolary, in conformity with the expectations of correspondence directed to nobles, statesmen and kings"&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious outlook ==

Rumi belongs to the class of Islamic philosophers which include [[Ibn Arabi]] and [[Mulla Sadra]]. These transcendental philosophers are often studied together in traditional schools of [[irfan]], philosophy and theosophy throughout the Muslim world.&lt;ref&gt;Nasr, Seyyed Hossein (2000) Transcendent Theosophy of Mulla Sadra {{ISBN|9644260341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rumi embeds his theosophy (transcendental philosophy) like a string through the beads of his poems and stories.  His main point and emphasis is the unity of being.

It is undeniable that Rumi was a Muslim scholar and took Islam seriously. Nonetheless, the depth of his spiritual vision extended beyond narrow understanding sectarian concerns. One rubaiyat reads:
{{Verse translation|italicsoff=y|rtl1=y|
{{lang|fa|rtl=yes|در راه طلب عاقل و دیوانه یکی است

|attr1=Quatrain 305|
On the seeker’s path, wise men and fools are one.
In His love, brothers and strangers are one.

According to the Quran, Prophet Muhammad is a mercy sent by God to the [[Aalameen]] (to all creation), including humanity overall.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://corpus.quran.com/translation.jsp?chapter=21&amp;verse=107|title=Verse (21:107) – English Translation}}&lt;/ref&gt; In regards to this, Rumi states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Light of Muhammad does not abandon a Zoroastrian or Jew in the world. May the shade of his good fortune shine upon everyone! He brings all of those who are led astray into the Way out of the desert."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-17EZOGivqMC|page=163|title=Rumi and Islam|author=Ibrahim Gamard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi, however, asserts the supremacy of [[Islam]] by stating:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Light of Muhammad has become a thousand branches (of knowledge), a thousand, so that both this world and the next have been seized from end to end. If Muhammad rips the veil open from a single such branch, thousands of monks and priests will tear the string of false belief from around their waists."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-17EZOGivqMC|author=Ibrahim Gamard|page=177|title=Rumi and Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many of Rumi's poems suggest the importance of outward religious observance and the primacy of the Qur'an.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2000|pp=407–408}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}

Rumi states:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;I am the servant of the Qur'an as long as I have life.
I am the dust on the path of Muhammad, the Chosen one.
If anyone quotes anything except this from my sayings,
I am quit of him and outraged by these words.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/self-discovery.html|title=Rumi and Self Discovery|publisher=Dar al Masnavi|author=Ibrahim Gamard}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi also states:

{{quote|"I "sewed" my two eyes shut from [desires for] this world and the next – this I learned from Muhammad."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-17EZOGivqMC|title=Rumi and Islam|author=Ibrahim Gamard|publisher=SkyLight Paths|year=2004|page=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

On the first page of the Masnavi, Rumi states:
&lt;blockquote&gt; "Hadha kitâbu 'l- mathnawîy wa huwa uSûlu uSûli uSûli 'd-dîn wa kashshâfu 'l-qur'ân."&lt;br /&gt;
"This is the book of the Masnavi, and it is the roots of the roots of the roots of the (Islamic) Religion and it is the Explainer of the Qur'ân."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.dar-al-masnavi.org/about_masnavi.html|title=About the Masnavi|publisher=Dar Al-Masnavi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Seyyed Hossein Nasr]] states:
&lt;blockquote&gt;One of the greatest living authorities on Rûmî in Persia today, Hâdî Hâ'irî, has shown in an unpublished work that some 6,000 verses of the Dîwân and the Mathnawî are practically direct translations of Qur'ânic verses into Persian poetry.&lt;ref&gt;Seyyed Hossein Nasr, "Rumi and the Sufi Tradition," in Chelkowski (ed.), ''The Scholar and the Saint'', p. 183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Rumi states in his [[Diwan (poetry)|Dīwān]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Sufi is hanging on to Muhammad, like [[Abu Bakr]].&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ibrahim Gamard, ''Rumi and Islam: Selections from His Stories, Poems, and Discourses&amp;nbsp;— Annotated and Explained'', p. 171.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His [[Masnavi]] contains anecdotes and stories derived largely from the Quran and the hadith, as well as everyday tales.

== Legacy ==
Rumi's poetry forms the basis of much classical [[Music of Iran|Iranian]] and [[Music of Afghanistan|Afghan]] music.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = The Overlook Press| isbn = 978-1-59020-378-1| last = Hiro| first = Dilip| title = Inside Central Asia: A Political and Cultural History of Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyz stan, Tajikistan, Turkey, and Iran| date = 2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.4407/jims.2014.02.002| issn = 1307-0401| volume = 6| issue = 2| pages = 137–150| last1 = Uyar| first1 = Yaprak Melike| last2 = ʂehvar Beʂiroglu| first2 = ʂ| title = Recent representations of the music of the Mevlevi Order of Sufism| journal = Journal of Interdisciplinary Music Studies| accessdate = 2017-05-22| date = 2012| url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=96300126&amp;site=ehost-live}}&lt;/ref&gt; Contemporary classical interpretations of his poetry are made by [[Muhammad Reza Shajarian]], [[Shahram Nazeri]], [[Davood Azad]] (the three from Iran) and [[Ustad Mohammad Hashem Cheshti]] (Afghanistan). To many modern Westerners, his teachings are one of the best introductions to the philosophy and practice of [[Sufism]]. In the West [[Shahram Shiva]] has been teaching, performing and sharing the translations of the poetry of Rumi for nearly twenty years and has been instrumental in spreading Rumi's legacy in the English-speaking parts of the world. Pakistan's [[National Poet]], [[Muhammad Iqbal]], was also inspired by Rumi's works and considered him to be his spiritual leader, addressing him as "Pir Rumi" in his poems (the honorific ''[[Pir (Sufism)|Pir]]'' literally means "old man", but in the Sufi/mystic context it means founder, master, or guide).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Said | first =Farida  | title =REVIEWS: The Rumi craze | url =http://www.dawn.com/weekly/books/archive/050508/books18.htm | accessdate =2007-05-19 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070927220804/http://www.dawn.com/weekly/books/archive/050508/books18.htm |archivedate = 2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Shahram Shiva]] asserts that "Rumi is able to verbalise the highly personal and often confusing world of personal growth and development in a very clear and direct fashion. He does not offend anyone, and he includes everyone.... Today Rumi's poems can be heard in churches, synagogues, Zen monasteries, as well as in the downtown New York art/performance/music scene."

According to Professor Majid M. Naini,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naini.net|title=index|work=naini.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Rumi's life and transformation provide true testimony and proof that people of all religions and backgrounds can live together in peace and harmony. Rumi’s visions, words, and life teach us how to reach inner peace and happiness so we can finally stop the continual stream of hostility and hatred and achieve true global peace and harmony.”

Rumi's work has been translated into many of the world's languages, including Russian, German, Urdu, Turkish, Arabic, Bengali, French, Italian, and Spanish, and is being presented in a growing number of formats, including concerts, workshops, readings, dance performances, and other artistic creations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rumi.net|title=Rumi Network by Shahram Shiva – The World's Most Popular Website on Rumi|work=rumi.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The English interpretations of Rumi's poetry by [[Coleman Barks]] have sold more than half a million copies worldwide,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ut.ac.ir/en/dr-braks/dr-barks.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507142950/http://www.ut.ac.ir/en/dr-braks/dr-barks.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2006-05-07|title=University of Tehran|work=ut.ac.ir}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Rumi is one of the most widely read poets in the [[United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Curiel, Jonathan, [[San Francisco Chronicle]] Staff Writer, ''Islamic verses: The influence of Muslim literature in the United States has grown stronger since the Sept. 11 attacks'' (February 6, 2005), [http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/02/06/INGH7B3FM31.DTL Available online] (Retrieved Aug 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Shahram Shiva]] book "Rending the Veil: Literal and Poetic Translations of Rumi" (1995, HOHM Press) is the recipient of the Benjamin Franklin Award.

Recordings of Rumi poems have made it to the USA's Billboard's Top 20 list. A selection of American author [[Deepak Chopra]]'s editing of the translations by Fereydoun Kia of Rumi's love poems has been performed by Hollywood personalities such as [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Goldie Hawn]], [[Philip Glass]] and [[Demi Moore]].

There is a famous landmark in Northern India, known as [[Rumi Gate]], situated in Lucknow (the capital of Uttar Pradesh) named for Rumi.

=== Iranian world ===
{{quote|پارسی گو گرچه تازی خوشتر است&amp;nbsp;— عشق را خود صد زبان دیگر است}}

{{quote|Say it in Persian although in Arabic sounds better—Love, however, has its own many other dialects}}

These cultural, historical and linguistic ties between Rumi and [[Iran]] have made Rumi an iconic Iranian poet, and some of the most important Rumi scholars including Foruzanfar, Naini, Sabzewari, etc., have come from modern Iran.&lt;ref name="Franklin Lewis 2000"&gt;Franklin Lewis, Rumi: Past and Present, East and West, Oneworld Publications, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Rumi's poetry is displayed on the walls of many cities across [[Iran]], sung in Persian music,&lt;ref name="Franklin Lewis 2000" /&gt; and read in school books.&lt;ref&gt;See for example 4th grade Iranian school book where the story of the Parrot and Merchant from the Mathnawi is taught to students&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mewlewī Sufi Order ===
{{Main|Mevlevi Order|Sama (Sufism)}}
The Mewlewī Sufi order was founded in 1273 by Rumi's followers after his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chnm.gmu.edu/worldhistorysources/r/172/whm.html%7ctitle=Sufism%7cwork=gmu.edu|title=Sufism|work=gmu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; His first successor in the rectorship of the order was "Husam Chalabi" himself, &lt;!-- who? --&gt;after whose death in 1284 Rumi's younger and only surviving son, [[Sultan Walad]] (died 1312), popularly known as author of the mystical ''Maṭnawī Rabābnāma'', or the ''Book of the [[Rabab]]'' was installed as grand master of the order.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/bin/site/wrappers/spirituality-mevlevi.html ISCA—The Islamic Supreme Council of America] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130827150758/http://www.islamicsupremecouncil.org/bin/site/wrappers/spirituality-mevlevi.html |date=August 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The leadership of the order has been kept within Rumi's family in Konya uninterruptedly since then.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Mevlâna Celâleddin Rumi | url = http://www.mevlana.net/celebi.htm | accessdate = 2007-05-19 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070506121512/http://www.mevlana.net/celebi.htm | archivedate = 2007-05-06 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Mewlewī Sufis, also known as Whirling Dervishes, believe in performing their ''[[dhikr]]'' in the form of [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]]. During the time of Rumi (as attested in the ''Manāqib ul-Ārefīn'' of Aflākī), his followers gathered for musical and "turning" practices.

According to tradition, Rumi was himself a notable musician who played the [[rebab|''robāb'']], although his favourite instrument was the ''[[ney]]'' or reed flute.&lt;ref name="order"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hayatidede.org/V1/about_moa.html|title=About the Mevlevi Order of America|work=hayatidede.org|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130112195131/http://www.hayatidede.org/V1/about_moa.html|archivedate=2013-01-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The music accompanying the ''samāʿ'' consists of settings of poems from the ''Maṭnawī'' and ''Dīwān-e Kabīr'', or of Sultan Walad's poems.&lt;ref name="order" /&gt; The Mawlawīyah was a well-established Sufi order in the [[Ottoman Empire]], and many of the members of the order served in various official positions of the Caliphate. The centre for the Mevlevi was in Konya. There is also a Mewlewī monastery ({{lang|fa|درگاه}}, ''dargāh'') in [[Istanbul]] near the [[Galata Tower]] in which the ''samāʿ'' is performed and accessible to the public. The Mewlewī order issues an invitation to people of all backgrounds:

{{rquote|right|&lt;poem&gt;''Come, come, whoever you are,''
''Wanderer, idolater, worshiper of fire,''
''Come even though you have broken your vows a thousand times,''
''Come, and come yet again.''
''Ours is not a caravan of despair.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hanut | first = Eryk | title = Rumi: The Card and Book Pack : Meditation, Inspiration, Self-discovery.

[[File:Turkey.Konya008.jpg|left|thumb|Rumi's tomb in [[Konya]], Turkey.]]
During Ottoman times, the Mevlevi produced a number of notable poets and musicians, including Sheikh Ghalib, Ismail Rusuhi Dede of Ankara, Esrar Dede, Halet Efendi, and Gavsi Dede, who are all buried at the Galata Mewlewī Khāna (Turkish: ''Mevlevi-Hane'') in Istanbul.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.istanbulportal.com/istanbulportal/Divan.aspx Web Page Under Construction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060325015105/http://www.istanbulportal.com/istanbulportal/Divan.aspx |date=2006-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Music, especially that of the ney, plays an important part in the Mevlevi.

With the foundation of the modern, secular [[Republic of Turkey]], [[Mustafa Kemal Atatürk]] removed religion from the sphere of public policy and restricted it exclusively to that of personal morals, behaviour and faith. On 13 December 1925, a law was passed closing all the ''[[Khanqah|tekke]]''s (dervish lodges) and ''zāwiyas'' (chief dervish lodges), and the centres of veneration to which visits (''ziyārat'') were made. Istanbul alone had more than 250 ''tekke''s as well as small centres for gatherings of various fraternities; this law dissolved the Sufi Orders, prohibited the use of mystical names, titles and costumes pertaining to their titles, impounded the Orders' assets, and banned their ceremonies and meetings. The law also provided penalties for those who tried to re-establish the Orders. Two years later, in 1927, the Mausoleum of Mevlâna in Konya was allowed to reopen as a Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Mango, Andrew, ''Atatürk: The Biography of the Founder of Modern Turkey'', (2002), {{ISBN|978-1-58567-011-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, the Turkish government began allowing the Whirling Dervishes to perform once a year in Konya. The Mewlānā festival is held over two weeks in December; its culmination is on 17 December, the Urs of Mewlānā (anniversary of Rumi's death), called ''Šabe Arūs'' (شب عروس) (Persian meaning "nuptial night"), the night of Rumi's union with God.&lt;ref name="urs"&gt;[http://www.kloosterman.be/rumi.php Kloosterman Genealogy, Jalal al-Din Muhammad Rumi] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060904005519/http://www.kloosterman.be/rumi.php |date=2006-09-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, the Whirling Dervishes were permitted to travel to the West for the first time. In 2005, [[UNESCO]] proclaimed "The [[Mevlevi Order|Mevlevi]] [[Sama (Sufism)|Sama]] Ceremony" of [[Turkey]] as one of the [[Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unesco.org/culture/intangible-heritage/39eur_uk.htm The Mevlevi Sema Ceremony] [[UNESCO]].&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Religious denomination ===
As [[Edward G. Browne]] noted, the three most prominent mystical Persian poets Rumi, [[Sanai]] and [[Farid al-Din Attar|Attar]] were all Sunni Muslims and their poetry abounds with praise for the first two caliphs [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Umar ibn al-Khattāb]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward G. Browne]], ''A Literary History of Persia from the Earliest Times Until Firdawsh'', 543 pp., Adamant Media Corporation, 2002, {{ISBN|978-1-4021-6045-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-4021-6045-5}} (see p.437)&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Annemarie Schimmel]], the tendency among [[Shia]] authors to anachronistically include leading mystical poets such as Rumi and Attar among their own ranks, became stronger after the introduction of [[Twelver Shia]] as the state religion in the [[Safavid Empire]] in 1501.&lt;ref&gt;[[Annemarie Schimmel]], ''Deciphering the Signs of God'', 302 pp., SUNY Press, 1994, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1982-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-7914-1982-3}} (see p.210)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Eight hundredth anniversary celebrations ===
In Afghanistan, Rumi is known as ''Mawlānā'', in Turkey as ''Mevlâna'', and in Iran as ''Molavī''.

At the proposal of the Permanent Delegations of Afghanistan, Iran, and Turkey, and as approved by its executive board and General Conference in conformity with its mission of “constructing in the minds of men the defences of peace”, [[UNESCO]] was associated with the celebration, in 2007, of the eight hundredth anniversary of Rumi's birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zaman.com/?bl=culture&amp;alt=&amp;hn=30647|title=Haber, Haberler, Güncel Haberler, Ekonomi, Dünya, Gündem Haberleri, Son Dakika, – Zaman Gazetesi|work=zaman.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060317005548/http://www.zaman.com/?bl=culture&amp;alt=&amp;hn=30647|archivedate=2006-03-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commemoration at UNESCO itself took place on 6 September 2007;&lt;ref name="UNESCO"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=34694&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090629034959/http://portal.unesco.org/culture/en/ev.php-URL_ID=34694&amp;URL_DO=DO_TOPIC&amp;URL_SECTION=201.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=29 June 2009 |title=UNESCO: 800th Anniversary of the Birth of Mawlana Jalal-ud-Din Balkhi-Rumi |date=6 September 2007 |publisher=UNESCO |quote=The prominent Persian language poet, thinker and spiritual master, Mevlana Celaleddin Belhi-Rumi was born in 1207 in Balkh, presently Afghanistan. |accessdate=25 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; UNESCO issued a medal in Rumi's name in the hope that it would prove an encouragement to those who are engaged in research on and dissemination of Rumi's ideas and ideals, which would, in turn, enhance the diffusion of the ideals of UNESCO.&lt;ref name="UNESDOC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0014/001473/147319e.pdf |title=UNESCO.

The Afghan Ministry of Culture and Youth established a national committee, which organised an international seminar to celebrate the birth and life of the great ethical philosopher and world-renowned poet. This grand gathering of the intellectuals, diplomats, and followers of Mewlana was held in [[Kabul]] and in [[Balkh]], the Mewlana's place of birth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.af/rumis.asp|title=Ministry of Foreign Affairs|work=mfa.gov.af}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also on 30 September 2007, Turkey celebrated Rumi’s eight-hundredth birthday with a giant Whirling Dervish ritual performance of the ''samāʿ'', which was televised using forty-eight cameras and broadcast live in eight countries. [[Ertugrul Gunay]], of the [[Ministry of Culture and Tourism (Turkey)|Ministry of Culture and Tourism]], stated, "Three hundred dervishes are scheduled to take part in this ritual, making it the largest performance of sema in history."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tehrantimes.com/index_View.asp?code=154044 tehrantimes.com, 300 dervishes whirl for Rumi in Turkey]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Secretary hand''' is a style of European [[hand (handwriting)|handwriting]] developed in the early sixteenth century that remained common in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries for writing [[English language|English]], [[German language|German]], [[Welsh language|Welsh]] and [[Goidelic languages|Gaelic]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scottishhandwriting.com/1hour.asp Scottish handwriting: Secretary hand: one hour basic tutorial].&lt;/ref&gt;

Predominating before the dominance of [[Italic script]], it arose out of the need for a hand more legible and universally recognizable than the [[book hand]] of the [[High Middle Ages]], in order to cope with the increase in long-distance business and personal correspondence, in cities, [[Court of Chancery|chanceries]] and [[Royal court|courts]]. The hand thus used by [[Secretary|secretaries]] was developed from cursive business hands and was in common use throughout the British Isles through the seventeenth century. In spite of its loops and flourishes it was widely used by [[scrivener]]s and others whose daily employment comprised hours of writing. By 1618 the writing-master [[Martin Billingsley]]&lt;ref&gt;Billingsley, ''The Pen's Excellency'', 1618. noted by Grace Ioppolo, "Early modern handwriting", in Michael Hattaway, ed., ''A New Companion to English Renaissance Literature and Culture'', vol. 1 (2010:177-83).&lt;/ref&gt; distinguished three forms of secretary hand, as well as "mixed" hands that employed some Roman letterforms, and the specialised hands, the "court hand" used only in the courts of the [[Court of King's Bench (England)|King's Bench]] and [[Court of Common Pleas (England)|Common Pleas]] and the  archaic hands used for engrossing [[pipe rolls]] and other documents.  
[[File:Shakespeare-Testament.jpg|thumb|left|[[William Shakespeare]]'s will, written in 1616 in secretary hand&lt;ref&gt;''Cardenio, Or, the Second Maiden's Tragedy'', pp. 131–3: By William Shakespeare, [[Charles Hamilton (handwriting expert)|Charles Hamilton]], John Fletcher (Glenbridge Publishing Ltd., 1994) {{ISBN|0-944435-24-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
At the time of [[Henry VII of England|Henry VII]], many writers began to use the "Italian" style instead, a cursive script developed from the [[humanist minuscule]] or "Roman" hand which was easier to read but also easier to forge. English ladies were often taught an "Italian hand", suitable for the occasional writing that they were expected to do.&lt;ref&gt;Ioppolo 2010:178f&lt;/ref&gt; Grace Ioppolo notes&lt;ref&gt;Ioppolo 2010:177&lt;/ref&gt;  that the convention in writing the texts of [[drama]]s was to write act and scene settings, characters' names and stage directions in italic, and the dialogue in secretary hand. The modern use of [[italic font]] stems from these distinctions.

Aside from [[palaeographer]]s themselves, [[genealogist]]s, social historians and scholars of [[Early Modern literature]] have become accustomed to reading secretary hand.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genealogy.about.com/od/paleography/ig/old_handwriting/Secretary-Hand.htm Genealogy: Secretary hand]; {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202091758/http://genealogy.about.com/od/paleography/ig/old_handwriting/Secretary-Hand.htm |date=2010-12-02 }} [http://penroom.co.uk/The_secretary_hand.aspx (University of Leicester) The Pen Room": Secretary hand] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110301112622/http://penroom.co.uk/The_secretary_hand.aspx |date=2011-03-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[William Henry Ireland]] used the secretary hand to forge many Shakespeare documents.

Two brief pamphlets provide introductory orientation: Lionel M. Munby, ''Secretary Hand: a beginner's introduction'' (British Association for Local History), 1984, and Alf Ison, ''A Secretary Hand ABC Book'', 1990.

'''Stone inscriptions in the Kathmandu Valley''' refer to ancient stone slabs, pillars and pedestals with text carved on them. They are the most important sources for the history of [[Nepal]]. A vast majority of the inscriptions found in Nepal are from the [[Kathmandu Valley]] where they are an ubiquitous element at heritage sites. They consist of royal edicts and dedicatory notes on [[Hindu]] and [[Buddhist]] temples, [[stupa]]s, statues, water spouts and other architectural structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Gutschow |first=Niels |year=1997 |title=The Nepalese Caitya: 1500 Years of Buddhist Votive Architecture in the Kathmandu Valley |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IQp_957RRtAC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Nepalese+Caitya:&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=yHExU4uJLI6WrAexiYHoDQ&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |publisher=Edition Axel Menges |page=25 |isbn=9783930698752 |accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The early inscriptions are from the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] period, and date from the fifth to the ninth centuries. They number more than 170, and are carved in [[Sanskrit]] language and [[Gupta script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Vajracarya |first=Gautamavajra|title=Recently discovered inscriptions of Licchavi Nepal |url=http://www.thlib.org/static/reprints/kailash/kailash_01_02_02.pdf |journal=Kailash |pages= 117–133|accessdate=9 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last="Arvind" |first=Krishan Dev Agrawal |year=2010 |title=Importance of Nepalese Sanskrit Inscriptions |url=http://www.sanskrit.nic.in/DigitalBook/N/NepalesseInscriptions.pdf |location= New Delhi |publisher=Rashtriya Sanskrit Sansthan |isbn=978-81-86111-37-6 |accessdate=19 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Inscriptions from the 14th century onwards, which are the most numerous, are in [[Nepal Bhasa|Nepal language]] (Nepal Bhasa) and [[Nepal script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Clark |first=TW |editor-first=Thomas |editor-last=Albert Sebeok |title=Current Trends in Linguistics |publisher=Walter de Gruyter |year=1976 |page=253 |chapter=Nepali and Pahari |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JqYMTdBws40C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bibliogroup:%22Current+trends+in+linguistics%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RisoU_SpJcWLrQfrq4G4CA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest dated inscription in Nepal Bhasa is dated [[Nepal Era]] 293 (1173 AD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kpmalla.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/11/Classical-Newari-Literature.pdf |title=Classical Newari Literature |last=Malla |first=KP|page=1 |accessdate=19 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Oldest inscription==
The oldest dated inscription in Kathmandu dates from the year 107 of the [[Shalivahana era|Saka era]] which corresponds to 184/185 AD. This date was accepted by all historians except Dinesh Chandra Regmi who assigned it to the Gupta era (started on A.D. 320). Paleographically he says it to be close to Samudra Gupta's Allahabad inscription (A.D. 360). The inscription is carved in Gupta characters, also known as Brahmi script, on the pedestal of a statue of King Jayavarman. It was unearthed at a building site in Maligaon in 1992. The language is Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asianart.com/articles/jaya/index01_12.html|title=A Kushan-period Sculpture from the reign of Jaya Varma, A.D. 184/185|last1=Tamot|first1=Kashinath|last2=Alsop|first2=Ian|website=Asian Arts|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this discovery, the distinction of the oldest dated stone inscription in the valley was held by an inscription carved on a pillar installed next to the [[Changu Narayan]] Temple in [[Bhaktapur]] which is dedicated to a Hindu deity [[Vishnu]]. It was inscribed in the year 383 which corresponds to 464 AD. It is written in the Sanskrit language and Gupta characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riccardi, Jr |first=Theodore |date=Oct–Dec 1989 |title=The Inscription of King Manadeva at Changu Narayan |url=https://www.jstor.org/discover/10.2307/604086?uid=3738752&amp;uid=2&amp;uid=4&amp;sid=21103736353903 |journal=Journal of the American Oriental Society |volume=109 |issue=4 |page=611 |accessdate=13 March 2014 |doi=10.2307/604086}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multilingual inscriptions==

Among the thousands of Nepal language inscriptions scattered across [[Nepal Mandala]], or the Kathmandu Valley and its neighborhood, there are a few inscribed in other languages too. King [[Pratap Malla]]'s polyglot inscription dated [[Nepal Era]] 774 (1654 AD) at [[Kathmandu Durbar Square]] is an example of his linguistic interest. The massive stone with spouts to dispense water to travelers is carved in 15 languages including [[English language|English]], [[French language|French]] and [[Persian language|Persian]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Account of the Kingdom of Nepal |first= Father |last= Giuseppe |publisher= Vernor and Hood |location= London|year= 1799|isbn=|pages= 313–314|accessdate=14 March 2014 |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=vSsoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA307&amp;cad=4#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three inscriptions written in [[Nepali language|Nepali]] (Khas Kura, Gorkhali) have been found in the Kathmandu Valley, all of them from the period in which Pratap Malla featured prominently in the politics of Kantipur. There is one at Makhan dated 1641 AD. Although it acknowledges Jaya Laxmi Malla, Pratap Malla's father, its date is very close to the formal commencement of Pratap Malla's ascension to the throne. Another at Guheswari bears the name Pratap Malla. Another famed stone inscription of Pratap Malla installed at [[Rani Pokhari]] pond contains writings in three languages: Sanskrit, Nepali and Nepal Bhasa.

[[File:Dialects Of Punjabi.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Punjabi dialects]]

'''Thaḷī''' is a [[Lahnda]] dialect spoken in parts of the [[Pakistan]]i provinces of [[Pakistani Punjab|Punjab]] and [[Khyber Pakhtunkhwa]]. It has a widespread area, starting from Tank to Muzzafargarh on eastern end of Indus River and from Bannu runs down to D I khan at western end of Indus River.{{citation needed|date = November 2016}} It is classified as a northern dialect of [[Saraiki language|Saraiki]],{{sfn|Wagha|1997|pp = 229–31}}{{sfn|Shackle|1976|p=8}} although it has also been described as transitional between [[Shahpuri]] and the central Saraiki [[Multani dialect]].{{sfn|Singh|1970|p=142}} Its name is derived from the [[Thal Desert]].{{sfn|Singh|1970|p=142}}

It is one of several Saraiki dialects that are commonly known as ''Jaṭkī''.&lt;ref&gt;Use of the term ''Jatki'': {{harvnb|Singh|1970}} (for Thali), {{harvnb|Masica|1991|p=430}} (for other Saraiki varieties).&lt;/ref&gt;
It is spoken in [[Khushab District]] and parts of the former [[Shahpur District]] where it is known as ''Thaḷī''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Grierson|1919|p=381}}. The description here mentions Jhelum, rather than Khushab, but the current Khushab District occupies the parts of the erstwhile Jhelum District that are under discussion.&lt;/ref&gt; Its local name in [[Jhang District]] is ''Thaḷochṛī''.{{sfn|Grierson|1919|p=381}} In [[Dera Ismail Khan District]] it goes by the name of ''Ḍerāwāl''{{sfn|Masica|1991|p=426}} or ''[[Derawali]]'',{{sfn|Singh|1970|p=142}} and in [[Mianwali District|Mianwali]] and [[Bannu District|Bannu]] districts it is known as ''Hindko'' or ''Mulkī''.{{sfn|Singh|1970|p=142}} Inhabitants of Dera Ismail Khan District, presumably speakers of this dialect, variously identify their language as Saraiki or [[Hindko]].{{sfn|Rensch|1992|pp=7–8, 57}} Likewise for those living in Mianwali District, who identify their language as either [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] or Saraiki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = South Asia Partnership-Pakistan| title = Profile of district Mianwali|url = http://www.sappk.org/sites/default/files/publications/profiles/Profile_Mianwali.pdf| archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20130522033817/http://www.sappk.org/sites/default/files/publications/profiles/Profile_Mianwali.pdf| archive-date = 22 May 2013|pp=12–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thali is spoken in the following districts of Punjab Province and districts of Kyber Pakhtunkha Province:{{citation needed|date = November 2016}}

The '''Tswana language''' or '''Setswana''' is spoken in [[Southern Africa]] by about five million people.&lt;ref name=e18/&gt; It is a [[Bantu languages|Bantu language]] belonging to the [[Niger–Congo languages|Niger–Congo language family]] within the [[Sotho-Tswana languages|Sotho-Tswana]] branch of [[Guthrie classification of Bantu languages#Zone S|Zone S (S.30)]], and is closely related to the [[Northern Sotho language|Northern]] and [[Sotho language|Southern Sotho]] languages, as well as the [[Kgalagadi language]] and the [[Lozi language]].

Tswana is an official language and [[lingua franca]] of [[Botswana]]. The majority of Tswana-speakers are found in the north of South Africa, where four million people speak the language and an urbanised variety which is part slang and not the formal Setswana, known as [[Pretoria Sotho|Pretoria Tswana]], is the principal language of that city. The three South African provinces with the most speakers are [[Gauteng]] (circa 11%) and [[Northern Cape]] 
and [[North West (South African province)|North West]] (over 70%). Until 1994, South African Tswana people were notionally citizens of [[Bophuthatswana]], one of the [[bantustan]]s of the [[apartheid]] regime. The Setswana language in the Northwest Province has variations in which it is spoken according to the tribes found in the Tswana culture [Bakgatla, Barolong, Bakwena, Batlhaping, Bahurutshe, Bafokeng to name a few] the written language remains the same. Although Tswana is spoken mostly in South Africa and Botswana, a small number of speakers are also found in [[Zimbabwe]] and [[Namibia]]; respectively, an unknown number of people and about 10,000 people speak the language there. &lt;ref name="e18"/&gt;

== History ==
The first European to  describe the Tswana language was the [[Germans|German traveller]] [[Hinrich Lichtenstein|H. Lichtenstein]], who lived among the [[Tswana people]] [[Batlhaping tribe|Batlhaping]] in 1806, although his work was not published until 1930. He mistakenly regarded Tswana as a [[dialect]] of the [[Xhosa language]], and the name he used for the language ''"Beetjuana"'' may also have covered the [[Northern Sotho language|Northern]] and [[Sotho language|Southern Sotho languages]].


The first major work on the Tswana language was carried out by the British [[missionary]] [[Robert Moffat (missionary)|Robert Moffat]], who had also lived among the [[Batlhaping tribe|Batlhaping]], and published ''Bechuana Spelling Book'' and ''A Bechuana Catechism'' in 1826. In the following years he published several other [[books of the Bible]] and in 1857 he was able to publish a complete translation of the Bible.&lt;ref name="janson_1991_36-37"&gt;{{Harvnb|Janson|Tsonope|1991|pp=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first grammar of the Tswana language was published in 1833 by the missionary [[James Archbell]], although it was modelled on a Xhosa grammar. The first grammar of Tswana which regarded it as a separate language from Xhosa (but still not as a separate language from the Northern- and Southern Sotho languages) was published by the French missionary [[E. Casalis]] in 1841. He changed his mind later, and in a publication from 1882 he noted that the Northern and Southern Sotho languages were distinct from Tswana.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Janson|Tsonope|1991|pp=38–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sol Plaatje|Solomon Plaatje]], a South African intellectual and [[linguist]], was one of the first writers to extensively write in and about the Tswana language.&lt;ref name="janson_1991_36-37" /&gt;

| '''{{angle bracket|w}}'''&lt;br /&gt;{{IPA|/w/}}
| 
| '''{{angle bracket|l}}'''&lt;br /&gt;{{IPA|/l/}}
| 
| '''{{angle bracket|y}}'''&lt;br /&gt;{{IPA|/j/}}
| 
| 
| 
|}

The [[consonant]] {{IPA|/d/}} is merely an [[allophone]] of {{IPA|/l/}}, when the latter is followed by the [[vowel]]s {{IPA|/i/}} or {{IPA|/u/}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|University of Botswana|2001|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two more sounds, '''v''' {{IPA|/v/}} and 
'''z''' {{IPA|/z/}}, exist only in loanwords.

Tswana also has three [[click consonant]]s, but these are only used in [[interjection]]s or [[ideophones]], and tend only to be used by the older generation, and are therefore falling out of use. The three click consonants are the [[dental click]] {{IPA|/ǀ/}}, orthographically {{angle bracket|c}}; the [[lateral click]] {{IPA|/ǁ/}}, orthographically {{angle bracket|x}}; and the [[palatal click]] {{IPA|/ǃ/}}, orthographically {{angle bracket|q}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|University of Botswana|2001|pp=11–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are some minor [[dialect|dialectal variations]] among the consonants between speakers of Tswana. For instance, {{IPA|/χ/}} is realised as either {{IPA|/x/}} or {{IPA|/h/}} by many speakers; {{IPA|/f/}} is realised as {{IPA|/h/}} in most dialects; and {{IPA|/tɬ/}} and {{IPA|/tɬʰ/}} are realised as {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/tʰ/}} in northern dialects.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|University of Botswana|2001|pp=14–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Stress ===
[[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] is fixed in Tswana and thus always falls on the [[ultima (linguistics)|penult]] of a word, although some [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] may receive a secondary stress in the first part of the word. The [[syllable]] on which the stress falls is lengthened. Thus, [[mosadi]] is realised as {{IPA|[mʊ̀ˈsáːdì]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|University of Botswana|2001|p=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tone ===
Tswana has two [[tone (linguistics)|tones]], high and low, although the latter has a much wider distribution in words than the former. Tones are not marked [[orthography|orthographically]] which may lead to ambiguity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|University of Botswana|2001|pp=31–32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''go bua''' {{IPA|/χʊ búa/}} ''"to speak"''
: '''go bua''' {{IPA|/χʊ bua/}} ''"to skin an animal"''

: '''o bua Setswana''' {{IPA|/ʊ́búa setswána/}} ''"He speaks Setswana"''
: '''o bua Setswana''' {{IPA|/ʊbúa setswána/}} ''"You speak Setswana"''

An important feature of the tones is the so-called spreading of the high tone. If a [[syllable]] bears a high tone, the following two syllables will also get high tones, unless they are at the end of the word.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|University of Botswana|2001|p=34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

: '''simolola''' {{IPA|/símʊlʊla/}} &gt; {{IPA|/símʊ́lʊ́la/}} ''"to begin"''
: '''simologêla''' {{IPA|/símʊlʊχɛla/}} &gt; {{IPA|/símʊ́lʊ́χɛla/}} ''"to begin for/at"''

== Grammar ==

=== Nouns ===
[[Noun]]s in Tswana are grouped into nine [[noun class]]es and one subclass, each having different [[prefix]]es.  The nine classes and their respective prefixes can be seen below, along with a short note regarding the common characteristics of most nouns within their respective classes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|1955|pp=68–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some nouns may be found in several classes.  For instance, many class 1 nouns are also found in class 1a, class 3, class 4, and class 5.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Cole|1955|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Marcia Imperator legs.jpg|thumb|upright|Upskirt photograph showing [[Márcia Imperator]]'s legs]]

'''Upskirting''' is the practice of making [[secret photography|unauthorized photographs]] under a woman's [[skirt]] or man's [[kilt]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-politics-44542051|title=Upskirting ban 'also protects men in kilts'|last=|first=|date=19 June 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=21 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; capturing an image of the [[Crotch|crotch area]], [[underwear]] and sometimes [[genitalia]].&lt;!-- Deviating from the Wikipedia:Manual of Style (WP:MoS), the following quotation marks demonstrate this term is used as a regular noun. --&gt; An '''upskirt''' is a photograph, video, or [[Drawing|illustration]] which incorporates an image made by upskirting.

The practice is regarded as a form of [[sexual fetishism]] or voyeurism and is similar in nature to [[downblouse]] photography. The ethical and legal issue relating to upskirt and downblouse photography is one of a reasonable [[expectation of privacy]], even in a [[public place]].

==Social attitudes==
[[File:Fragonard, The Swing-detail voyeur.jpg|thumb|Detail from [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard|Fragonard's]] ''[[The Swing (painting)|The Swing]]'' (1767)]]
[[File:Pin-up 1.jpg|thumb|upright|Pin up girl]]
The term "upskirt" is relatively recent, but the concept and interest therein are not. Looking up a woman's skirt was depicted in the 1767 painting ''[[The Swing (painting)|The Swing]]'' by [[Jean-Honoré Fragonard]]. In "polite society", looking up a lady's skirt was regarded as [[impolite]] or [[rude]]. In less polite society, looking up a lady's skirt or her lifting up the skirt or otherwise exposing her underwear was regarded as [[bawdy]], as in the case of cabaret dances such as the [[can-can]] or in the case of entertainment involving the raising of a dancer's dress by her spinning rapidly. By the polite society, such behaviour was widely judged as [[indecent exposure|indecent]].

The sudden popularity in the 1960s of the [[miniskirt]] brought the concept out onto the streets, and was viewed by many as mass [[exhibitionism]]. One commentator in the 1960s said, "In European countries ... they ban mini-skirts in the streets and say they're an invitation to rape...."&lt;ref name="Adburgham"&gt;{{cite newspaper|last=Adburgham|first=Alison|date=10 October 1967|title=Mary Quant talks to Alison Adburgham|newspaper=The Guardian|url=http://century.guardian.co.uk/1960-1969/Story/0,6051,106475,00.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, many women viewed the new style as rebellion against previous clothing styles and as [[women's liberation]] of their own bodies. For the first time, many women felt comfortable exposing their thighs, whether on the beach in a swimsuit or in street wear, and were even relaxed when in some situations their underwear would be visible.

Some upskirt and downblouse images originate as innocent fun images which are made with the knowledge and lack of objection of the females affected. However, some of these images can finish up being more widely distributed or being posted onto the Internet without the knowledge and consent of the subject, for example as [[revenge porn]] following a [[relationship breakup]].

Some upskirt and downblouse photos and videos are made specifically to upload onto the Internet, where many viewers seek such images taken surreptitiously (and presumably without the subject's consent). Such photographs are common on fetish and [[Internet pornography|pornographic websites]], as well as on video sharing sites such as [[YouTube]].

Attitudes hardened with the very widespread availability and use of digital photographic and video technology, most recently [[camera phone]]s.&lt;ref name=SeatUpskirt&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such technology was also being used to record upskirt and downblouse images for uploading onto the internet. Specialist websites came into existence where people could share such images, and terms such as "upskirt", "downblouse" and "nipple dress" (i.e., when an erect nipple is evident through the material of a woman's dress) came into use. Of particular concern were images of minors and of people who could be identified. Celebrities were popular victims of such efforts. Issues of privacy and reputation began to be raised.

The creation and viewing of this type of image came increasingly to be described as forms of [[voyeurism]] and pornography. This was not that most of such images were sexual in nature, with most of them being quite innocent by themselves, but because of their association with the nature of the website on which they were posted and because of the size of the collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ag.gov.au/agd/WWW/rwpattach.nsf/VAP/(CFD7369FCAE9B8F32F341DBE097801FF)%7E8%2BAugInternetPhotosFinalPaperAugust05.pdf/$file/8%2BAugInternetPhotosFinalPaperAugust05.pdf Australia Attorney General Discussion Paper August 2005 - Unauthorised Photographs on the Internet]&lt;/ref&gt;

Upskirt photos can be made in a variety of situations, such as when a woman is ascending stairs or getting out of a car or just sitting on a park bench; and downblouse photos can similarly be made in many innocent situations. Upskirt photos are usually taken by a concealed camera attached on the shoe or carried within a bag so it is very hard for a woman to notice that she is being photographed in this manner. There are many methods and types of making upskirt photos and it is very rare for a woman to notice it before actually seeing herself on some of the voyeur websites that display such photographs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.voy7.com/voyeurism/upskirt-voyeur/ Blog about upskirt voyeurism and site for sharing upskirt photos]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal position==
Many countries do not have laws which protect a person's right to personal privacy, especially in a [[public place]], but the legal position does vary considerably.

===Australia===
All jurisdictions within Australia have passed laws making it illegal to take upskirt photos in [[public places]] without the person's consent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Finland===
In 2010, an elderly man had his camera confiscated and was fined 12 [[day-fine]]s for the act of ''public obscenity'' (which was thought to be the closest match in the criminal code), having taken dozens of upskirt photos in a shopping centre in [[Turku]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Naisten takamuksia Turussa kuvannut mies sai sakot ja menetti kameransa |date=5 August 2010 |author=Marko Hämäläinen |journal=[[Helsingin Sanomat]] |url=http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Naisten+takamuksia+Turussa+kuvannut+mies+sai+sakot+ja+menetti+kameransa/1135259115993 |language=Finnish |access-date=14 May 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822020528/http://www.hs.fi/kotimaa/artikkeli/Naisten+takamuksia+Turussa+kuvannut+mies+sai+sakot+ja+menetti+kameransa/1135259115993 |archive-date=22 August 2010 |dead-url=yes  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
In India, under section 66E, of the [[Information Technology Act]], "Whoever, intentionally or knowingly captures, publishes or transmits the image of a private area of any person without his or her consent, under circumstances violating the privacy of that person, shall be punished with imprisonment which may extend to three years or with fine not exceeding two [[lakh]] (200,000) rupees, or with both". The words "private area" mean the naked or undergarment-clad genitals, pubic area, buttocks or female breast. "under circumstances violating privacy" means circumstances in which a person can have a reasonable expectation that any part of his or her private area would not be visible to the public, regardless of whether that person is in a public or private place.

===Japan===

In Japan, some [[Prefectures of Japan|prefecture]]s have laws against upskirt photography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2014/05/25/national/kyoto-law-puts-upskirt-photography-focus/|title=Kyoto law puts ‘upskirt’ photography in focus|newspaper=The Japan Times|date=25 May 2014|author=Eric Johnston}}&lt;/ref&gt; Camera phones sold in Japan generally make an audible noise when taking a picture, making the person more likely to notice if clandestine upskirt photos are being taken without consent. However, there are also apps that circumvent this by making the camera silent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-2081216/New-silent-camera-apps-cause-plague-voyeurism-Japan.html | location=London | work=Daily Mail | first=Rob | last=Waugh | title=New 'silent camera' apps cause plague of voyeurism in Japan - and some are on sale in West | date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand it is illegal to make a visual recording of a person's [[intimate part]]s in any setting in which the person has a "[[reasonable expectation of privacy]]". This includes public and private settings. It is also illegal to possess or distribute such images.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2006/0075/latest/whole.html#DLM398248 ''The Crimes (Intimate Covert Filming) Amendment Act'' 2006] created offences covering the making, possessing, publishing, importing, exporting or selling of voyeuristic recordings. The punishment can be up to three years' imprisonment.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== England and Wales ====

[[England]] and [[Wales]] have no specific ban against upskirting.&lt;ref name="inews_30082017"&gt;{{cite news | last = Secret barrister | title = Upskirting: Why a new law is needed to stop mobile phones being shoved up women’s skirts | url = https://inews.co.uk/opinion/new-criminal-laws-rarely-required-law-upskirting/ | work = [[i (newspaper)|i News]] | date = 30 August 2017 | access-date = 3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; When upskirting takes place in public, it is outside of the scope of the offence of [[voyeurism]] under the [[Sexual Offences Act 2003]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Conner | first = Paul | title = Blackstone's Police Manual 2017 Volume 1: Crime | publisher = Oxford University Press | location = Oxford, United Kingdom | year = 2016 | isbn = 9780198783053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, prosecutions for upskirting have been successful under the [[common law]] offence of [[outraging public decency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.croydonguardian.co.uk/news/8894074.Croydon_man_convicted_of_taking_pictures_up_women_s_skirts/|title=Croydon man convicted of taking pictures up women's skirts|last=Miller|first=Harry|date=7 March 2011|work=[[Croydon Guardian]]|accessdate=5 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2017, Gina Martin, who was upskirted at a music festival, began a campaign to reopen her case after the police closed it; Martin's case ignited a public debate over the legality of upskirting in England and Wales.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-40861875|title=Upskirting - how one victim is fighting back|last=Staff writer|date=9 August 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=3 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] backed her petition, which attracted over 58,000 signatures, to make the practice of upskirting illegal under the Sexual Offences Act.&lt;ref name="BBC_11082017"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-40897934|title=Make 'upskirt' photography a sexual offence - Labour|last=Staff writer|date=11 August 2017|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following a [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|freedom of information]] request created from Martin's campaign, it was revealed that between 2015 and 2017, there were 11 charges related to upskirting in England and Wales, but that only 15 out of 44 police forces held specific records for it.&lt;ref name="BBC_20022018"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-43112450|title='Upskirting' should be criminal offence, campaigners say|last=Staff writer|date=20 February 2018|work=[[BBC News]]|access-date=20 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign to make upskirting a specific crime in England and Wales has been supported by [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of the British House of Commons|MP]] [[Maria Miller]], Chair of the [[Women and Equalities Committee]], the [[End Violence Against Women Coalition]], [[Sadiq Khan]], the [[Mayor of London]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.london.gov.uk/press-releases/mayoral/mayors-strategy-to-tackle-violence-against-women|title=Mayor’s record £44m commitment to make London safe for women and girls|website=London City Hall|language=en|access-date=1 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the television presenter [[Laura Whitmore]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Laura Whitmore has tweeted her support for the criminalisation of 'upskirting'|url=http://www.dailyedge.ie/laura-whitmore-has-tweeted-her-support-for-the-criminalisation-of-upskirting-4039589-May2018/|date=28 May 2018|work=The Daily Edge|access-date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Clare McGlynn]], a professor at [[Durham University]] specialising in image-based sexual abuse.&lt;ref name="BBC_20022018" /&gt;

===== Voyeurism (Offences) Bill =====
On 6 March 2018, [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] MP [[Wera Hobhouse]] presented a [[Private Members' Bills in the Parliament of the United Kingdom|Private Members' Bill]] to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] in support of Martin's national campaign, which proposed amending the Sexual Offences Act 2003; the bill would outlaw acts of [[voyeurism]], including upskirting.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2017-2019/0174/18174.pdf|title=Voyeurism (Offences) Bill|last=|first=|date=6 March 2018|website=House of Commons|access-date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/upskirting-lib-dem-mp-new-law-international-womens-day-wera-hobhouse-sexual-harassment-a8246316.html|title=Liberal Democrat MP tables new law to make 'upskirting' a criminal offence|last=|first=|date=8 March 2018|work=The Independent|access-date=17 May 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The maximum sentence for the offence would be two years’ imprisonment and in the most serious cases those convicted would be added to the [[Violent and Sex Offender Register]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite newspaper|title=Upskirting to be made criminal offence with two-year prison sentence under proposed law|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/crime/upskirting-law-change-criminal-offence-photos-prison-gina-miller-campaign-a8399286.html|author=Lizzie Dearden |date=15 June 2018|newspaper=The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Secretary of State for Justice|Justice Secretary]] [[David Gauke]] signalled that the government would support Hobhouse's bill,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/04/24/new-law-could-made-against-upskirting-uk/|title=New law could be made against upskirting in the UK|last=|first=|date=24 April 2018|work=The Telegraph|access-date=17 May 2018|language=en-GB|issn=0307-1235}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was later supported by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[Theresa May]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.werahobhouse.co.uk/prime_minister_backs_wera_hobhouse|title=Prime Minister backs Wera Hobhouse MP's calls to make upskirting an offence|last=|first=|date=3 May 2018|work=Liberal Democrats - Wera Hobhouse MP|access-date=18 June 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill was not debated at its presentation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

At its second reading in the Commons on 15 June 2018, Conservative MP [[Christopher Chope]] objected to Hobhouse's bill, delaying its passage through the Commons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44496427|title=New upskirting law blocked by Tory MP|last=|first=|date=15 June 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=15 June 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chope said that his reason for blocking the bill's passage was in objection to parliamentary procedure rather than to the bill itself: he stated that he would "wholeheartedly" support a government bill that outlawed upskirting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/16296117.Christopher_Chope_exclusive__I_DO_support_upskirting_ban__I___ve_been_scapegoated_/|title=Christopher Chope exclusive: I DO support upskirting ban.

A similar bunting was also placed outside his constituency office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44518706|title='Pants protest' against Commons row MP|last=|first=|date=18 June 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=18 June 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protestors also confronted Chope at his constituency surgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bournemouthecho.co.uk/news/16307492.WATCH__Protestors_confront_Sir_Christopher_Chope_in_Christchurch_over__upskirting__bill/|title=WATCH: Protestors confront Sir Christopher Chope in Christchurch over 'upskirting' bill|last=Lewis|first=Jason|date=22 June 2018|website=Bournemouth Echo|language=en|access-date=24 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

McGlynn said that, by being returned to the House of Commons for debate, Hobhouse's bill could now be amended and "future-proofed" to include penalties for creators of [[deepfake]] pornographic images. McGlynn said that the bill as drafted had "placed too high a burden of proof on prosecutors because they had to show that a picture was taken for the purposes of sexual gratification or to cause distress" when "the unfortunate reality is that these things are often done 'for a laugh'. It's not clear to me that the current proposed legislation will cover these situations."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/21/call-for-upskirting-bill-to-include-deepfake-pornography-ban|title=Call for upskirting bill to include 'deepfake' pornography ban|last1=Sabbagh|first1=Dan|date=21 June 2018|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=21 June 2018|last2=Ankel|first2=Sophia|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following Chope's objection, the government reaffirmed its commitment to introduce legislation to outlaw upskirting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2018/jun/18/upskirting-government-confirms-plan-to-introduce-ban|title=Upskirting: government confirms plan to introduce ban|last=Crerar|first=Pippa|date=18 June 2018|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=19 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A government bill was introduced to the House of Commons on 21 June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.sky.com/story/weve-done-it-campaigners-celebrate-as-upskirting-criminalised-in-new-government-bill-11412284|title=Campaigners celebrate as government tables bill to tackle upskirting|last=Bradley|first=Sorcha|date=21 June 2018|work=Sky News|access-date=21 June 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/bills/cbill/2017-2019/0235/18235.pdf|title=Voyeurism (Offences) (No. 2) Bill|last=|first=|date=21 June 2018|website=publications.parliament.uk|access-date=13 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speaking on the government's behalf in the House of Lords, [[Charlotte Vere, Baroness Vere of Norbiton|Baroness Vere of Norbiton]] said that the legislation would also protect men wearing [[Kilt|kilts]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-44542051|title=Upskirting ban 'also protects men in kilts'|last=|first=|date=19 June 2018|work=BBC News|access-date=20 June 2018|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://hansard.parliament.uk/Lords/2018-06-19/debates/706FA876-2706-4326-9F3C-F1DF51D19259/Upskirting#contribution-6B888C88-124A-46E2-BD0D-8538CDD355D9|title=Upskirting - Hansard Online|last=|first=|date=19 June 2018|website=hansard.parliament.uk|language=en|access-date=20 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill passed its second reading on 3 July 2018.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Scotland ====
Upskirting is a specific offence in [[Scotland]] under the Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act. This Act, which was passed by the [[Scottish Parliament]], extended the definition of voyeurism to cover upskirting.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gov.scot/Topics/archive/law-order/criminal-justice-bill|title=Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=Scottish Government|language=en-gb|access-date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.legislation.gov.uk/asp/2010/13/section/43|title=Criminal Justice and Licensing (Scotland) Act 2010|last=|first=|date=|website=www.legislation.gov.uk|language=en|others=|access-date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
In the United States, laws vary by state. At the federal level the United States enacted the ''Video Voyeurism Prevention Act'' of 2004 to punish those who intentionally make an image of an individual's private areas without consent, when the person knew the subject had an [[expectation of privacy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s108-1301 |title=S. 1301 [108th&amp;#93;: Video Voyeurism Prevention Act of 2004 |publisher=GovTrack.us |accessdate=27 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, many state laws address the issue as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/AGP.Net/Components/documentViewer/Download.aspxnz?DocumentID=40459|title=Video Voyeurism Laws|publisher=National Centre of Victims of Crime|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120624122149/http://www.ncvc.org/ncvc/AGP.Net/Components/documentViewer/Download.aspxnz?DocumentID=40459 |archive-date=24 June 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 Illinois law made it a crime to videotape or transmit upskirt videos of other people without their consent. A 2014 Chicago ordinance made the crime punishable by a $500 fine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dardick|first1=Hal|title=Chicago to ban 'upskirt' video taking without consent|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2014-05-23/news/chi-chicago-to-ban-upskirt-video-taking-without-consent-20140523_1_chicago-city-council-ed-burke-latasha-thomas|work=Chicago Tribune|date=23 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2014, [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] overruled a lower court upskirt ruling because the women photographed were not nude or partially nude, saying that existing so-called Peeping Tom laws protect people from being photographed in dressing rooms and bathrooms when nude or partially nude, but it does not protect clothed people in public areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/massachusetts-upskirt-court-legal |title=Top Massachusetts court rules 'upskirt' photos to be legal |publisher=theguardian.com |date=5 March 2014 |accessdate=22 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A law was then passed in Massachusetts to ban the practice.&lt;ref name="blogs.findlaw.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.findlaw.com/law_and_life/2014/03/mass-upskirt-photo-ban-signed-into-law.html|title=Mass.

In September 2014 the [[Texas Court of Criminal Appeals]] voided the state's statute against "improper photography or visual recording" including "upskirt" photos, saying its wording was overly broad. The court's opinion stated: “Protecting someone who appears in public from being the object of sexual thoughts seems to be the sort of ‘paternalistic interest in regulating the defendant’s mind’ that the First Amendment was designed to guard against.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/sep/19/texas-court-upholds-right-to-take-upskirt-photos |title=Texas court upholds right to take 'upskirt' pictures|publisher=theguardian.com |date=14 September 2014 |accessdate=14 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.msn.com/en-us/news/crime/oregon-judge-taking-photos-up-girls-skirt-not-illegal/ar-AA95oKA?ocid=mailsignout|title=Oregon judge: taking photos up girl's skirt not illegal|work=msn.com|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, actress [[Natalie Morales (actress)|Natalie Morales]] criticized [[paparazzi]] for intentionally taking her upskirt photos and passing them off as her [[wardrobe malfunction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.womenshealthmag.com/life/a19938130/natalie-morales-upskirt-photos/|title=This Actress Just Slammed Paparazzi For Intentionally Taking Photos Up Her Skirt|last=Bahadur|first=Nina|date=27 September 2017|work=Women's Health|access-date=3 June 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;
