The '''Académie de Marseille''', officially the '''Académie des sciences, lettres et arts de Marseille''', is a French [[learned society]] based in [[Marseille]].  It was founded in 1726 and includes those in the city involved in [[the arts]], [[Literature|letter]]s, and [[science]]s.

==History==
The Académie de Marseille was created by [[letters patent]] of [[Louis XV]] in August 1726, which stated in particular that the number of members would be limited to twenty. The founding document furthermore stated that all twenty members must live in [[Marseille]]. However, the actual number of founding members was twenty-one, due to the insistence of {{ill|Jean-Pierre Rigord|fr}} that [[Henri François Xavier de Belsunce de Castelmoron|Henri de Belsunce]] also be offered membership. This was rectified in 1730 when {{ill|Joseph-Félix de Gravier|fr}} resigned from the Académie and was not replaced.

The '''Bachelor of Computer Science''' or '''Bachelor of Science in Computer Science''' (abbreviated '''BCompSc''' or '''BCS''' or '''BS CS''' or '''B.Sc. CS''') is a type of [[bachelor's degree]], usually awarded after three or four years of collegiate study in [[computer science]], but possibly awarded in fewer years depending on factors such as an institution's course requirements and academic calendar. In some cases it can be awarded in five years. In general, computer science degree programs emphasize the mathematical and theoretical foundations of computing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.uowdubai.ac.ae/computer-science-and-engineering-programs/bachelor-of-computer-science-bcompsc-degree |title=Bachelor of Computer Science (BCOMPSC) Degree |publisher=[[University of Wollongong in Dubai]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same core curriculum may, depending on the school, result in other degrees, including:
* [[Bachelor of Arts]] (BA) in Computer Science 
* Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) in Computer Science
* Bachelor of Technology in Computer Science and Engineering (B.Tech)
* Bachelor of Science in Information Technology 
* Bachelor of Mathematics in Computer Science  
* Bachelor of Engineering (BEng or BE) in Computer Science 
* Bachelor of Computing in Computer Science 
* [[Bachelor of Science]] in Engineering (Computer Science) - BSE (CS)
* Bachelor of Computer Security in Computer Science
* Bachelor of Science (BSc or BS) in Computer Science (BSc CS or BSCS or BSc (Comp)

In many post-secondary institutions, an '''Honors Bachelor of Computer Science''' degree has been introduced as an upgrade to the regular bachelor's program and usually requires at least one additional year of study.

==Typical requirements==
Because computer science is a wide field, courses required to earn a bachelor of computer science degree vary. A typical list of course requirements includes topics such as:&lt;ref 
name="monash_bcs_course_description"&gt;[http://www.monash.edu.au/study/coursefinder/course/2380/] Course description of the Bachelor of Computer Science at [[Monash University]], [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Computer programming]] 
* [[Programming paradigm]]s
* [[Algorithms]]
* [[Data structures]] 
* [[Logic]] &amp; [[Computation]]
* [[Computer architecture]]
 
Some schools may place more emphasis on [[mathematics]]  and require additional courses such as:&lt;ref name="purdue_bcs_requirements"&gt;[http://www.cs.purdue.edu/academic_programs/future_students/majors_minors.shtml#Major] Bachelor of Computer Science at [[Purdue University]], [[West Lafayette]], [[Indiana]], U.S.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Linear algebra]]
* [[Calculus]]
* [[Probability theory]] and [[statistics]]
* [[Combinatorics]] and [[discrete mathematics]]
* [[Differential calculus]] and [[mathematics]]

Beyond the basic set of computer science courses, students can typically choose additional courses from a variety of different fields, such as:&lt;ref name="purdue_cs_courselist"&gt;[https://esa-oas-prod-wl.itap.purdue.edu/prod/bzwsrch.p_search_catalog?subject=CS&amp;college=S] Classes available through Purdue University's Computer Science Department&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Theory of computation]]
* [[Operating systems]]
* [[Numerical computation]]
* [[Compilers]], [[compiler design]]
* [[Real-time computing]]
* [[Distributed system]]s
* [[Computer network]]ing
* [[Data communication]]
* [[Computer graphics]]
* [[Artificial intelligence]]
* [[Human-computer interaction]]
* [[Information theory]]
* [[Software testing]]
* [[Information assurance]]

Some schools allow students to specialize in a certain area of computer science.&lt;ref name="stevens_cs_concetrations"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stevens.edu/compsci/undergrad/bs_aaca.html|title=Computer Science concentrations offered by Stevens Institute|author=|date=|publisher=[[Stevens Institute of Technology]]|access-date=2011-12-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110810200703/http://www.stevens.edu/compsci/undergrad/bs_aaca.html|archive-date=2011-08-10|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="saint_leo_cs_description"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saintleo.edu/Academics/School-of-Business/Undergraduate-Degree-Programs/Bachelor-of-Computer-Science-Degree|title=Saint Leo University program description offering Information assurance specialization|author=|date=|publisher=[[Saint Leo University]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fairleigh_cs_concentration"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://view.fdu.edu/default.aspx?id=7262|title=B.S.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5222">'''Black Women in the Academy: Defending Our Name 1894-1994''' was a national conference focusing on black women academics held at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT) on January 13–15, 1994. This was the first national conference focusing on issues pertaining to black female scholars.&lt;ref name="Tech"&gt;{{cite news |last= Keightley |first=Sarah |date=January 12, 1994 |title=Conference for Black Women to Be Held at MIT |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V113/N65/women.65n.html |deadurl=no |newspaper=The Tech |location=Cambridge, MA |accessdate=January 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was held 100 years after the National Federation of Negro Women met in Boston to create a national organization focusing on Black women's issues and to protest the popular image of Black womanhood in the press. The outcome of that meeting was the creation of the [[First National Conference of the Colored Women of America|National Federation of Afro-American Women]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hartman|first=Saidiya|date=Spring 1994|title=The Territory Between Us: A Report on "Black Women in the Academy: Defending Our Name: 1894-1994"|jstor=2931742|journal=Callaloo|volume=17|pages=439–449}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1994 conference was organized by Robin W. Kilson, MIT professor of history and women's studies, and [[Evelynn M. Hammonds]], MIT professor of the history of science. The conference was inspired by Kilson's "personal frustration through the sense of isolation as a black woman" in higher education.&lt;ref name="Tech" /&gt;  The conference served as a large public forum of Black women academics to discuss issues of research, success and lack thereof in academia, and the repressive political climate of the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; About 1,500 black women scholars attended from across the U.S., ranging from undergraduates to professors to college presidents.&lt;ref name = "Globe"&gt;{{cite news |last= Dembner |first=Alice |date=January 15, 1994 |title=Black women scholars seize chance to share notes|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/403599204.html |deadurl=no |newspaper=The Boston Globe |location=Boston, MA |accessdate=January 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was sponsored by MIT, [[Wellesley College]] and [[Radcliffe College]], as well as other foundations.&lt;ref name="Tech" /&gt;

==Proceedings==
The conference featured three keynote speakers: [[Lani Guinier]] from the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]], Dr. [[Johnnetta B. Cole]], president of [[Spelman College]]; and Professor [[Angela Davis]] of the [[University of California Santa Cruz]].&lt;ref name="archive"&gt;[https://libraries.mit.edu/archives/research/collections/collections-ac/ac533.html Black Women in the Academy: Defending Our Name, 1894-1994], Conference Records, AC 533. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Institute Archives and Special Collections, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; Guinier, who had recently been withdrawn from nomination for assistant attorney general by President [[Bill Clinton]], gave an opening speech to three standing ovations, stating that "what was happening to me was a metaphor for the experiences of many women of color".&lt;ref name = "Globe Guinier"&gt;{{cite news |last= Dembner |first=Alice |date=January 14, 1994 |title=Guinier cites vacancy of key civil rights post|url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/403571251.html |deadurl=no |newspaper=The Boston Globe |location=Boston, MA |accessdate=January 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Davis gave the closing speech, arguing the importance of standing up for all black women in the public eye. "While courageous people fought to make the walls of academia less impenetrable, these very victories have spawned new problems and foreshadow new troubles", she said.&lt;ref name="Tech Davis"&gt;{{cite news |last= Shrivastava |first=Rishi |date=January 19, 1994 |title=Davis Discusses Issues Concerning Black Women |url=http://tech.mit.edu/V113/N65/women.65n.html |deadurl=no |newspaper=The Tech |location=Cambridge, MA |accessdate=January 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The conference also featured over 100 panels, talks, and posters on topics ranging from black women in film and literature, to race and gender politics in academic culture, to specialized research in various topics performed by black female scholars.&lt;ref name="archive" /&gt; [[Vinie Burrows]], [[Performance art|performance artist]], presented “Sister, Sister,” her one-woman show.

At the conference, attendants drafted an appeal to President Clinton, asking him to "commission a blue-ribbon panel on race relations; to promote black women's research and extend the Glass Ceiling Commission to address the women of color in academia; to extend funding for community-based social service organizations for the poor; to end covert actions against Haiti and restore [[Bertrand Aristide|President Aristide]] to power, and to continue to support democracy in South and Southern Africa."&lt;ref name="Tech Talk"&gt;{{cite news |date=January 26, 1994 |title=Black Women Send Appeal to Clinton |newspaper=MIT Tech Talk |location=Cambridge, MA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Carlyle Harris''' (September 1868 &amp;ndash; May 8, 1893) was a medical student who was convicted and sentenced to death for the murder of his wife.

A student at [[New York College of Physicians and Surgeons]], Harris murdered his wife, Mary Helen Potts, whom he had married on February 8, 1890, with an overdose of [[morphine]] in the form of sleeping pills. Although Potts' death was first attributed to a stroke, the murder was discovered by physicians only because she displayed severely contracted pupils, a characteristic symptom of morphine poisoning. 

Prosecuted by Assistant District Attorney Charles E. Simms, Jr., the witnesses against Harris included Dr. [[Rudolph Witthaus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wilkes|first=Roger|title=The Mammoth Book of Murder and Science|location=New York|publisher=Carroll &amp; Graf Publishers|year=2000|isbn=0-7867-0789-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Harris was represented by prominent defense attorney [[William F. Howe (lawyer)|William F. Howe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Trager|first=James|title=The New York Chronology: A Compendium of Events, People, and Anecdotes from the Dutch to the Present|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins Publishers|year=2003|isbn=0-06-074062-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was found guilty of first-degree murder, on February 8, 1892, the second anniversary of his marriage to Helen Potts and was executed in the [[electric chair]] at [[Sing Sing Prison]] on May 8, 1893.  

==Legacy==
The story "Max Hensig, Bacteriologist" was written by [[Algernon Blackwood]] who had been a police reporter for the [[The New York Times|New York Times]] during the murder trial.

Journalist and author Bernard Barshay wrote the story "The Case of the Six Capsules" based on the events of the trial. This story was later recorded on the record ''Four American Murder Mysteries''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.folkways.si.edu/albumdetails.aspx?itemid=1709, ''Four American Murder Mysteries'']{{Dead link|date=November 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Folkways Records FW09781&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Computer bridge''' is the playing of the game [[contract bridge]] using computer software. After years of limited progress, since around the end of the 20th century the field of computer bridge has made major advances. In 1996 the [[American Contract Bridge League]] (ACBL) established an official World Computer-Bridge Championship, to be held annually along with a major bridge event. The first championship took place in 1997 at the North American Bridge Championships in Albuquerque. Since 1999 the event has been conducted as a joint activity of the American Contract Bridge League and the [[World Bridge Federation]]. Alvin Levy, ACBL Board member, initiated this championship and has coordinated the event annually since its inception. The event history, articles and publications, analysis, and playing records can be found at the [http://www.allevybridge.com/allevy/computerbridge/ official website].

== World Computer-Bridge Championship==
The World Computer-Bridge Championship is typically played as a round robin followed by a knock-out between the top four contestants.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computerbridge.com ACBL/WBF World Computer-Bridge Championship Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jackbridge.com/ewkprt.htm World Computer Bridge Championship - List of contestants and their links]&lt;/ref&gt; Winners of the annual event are:

== Computers versus humans ==
In [[Zia Mahmood]]'s book, ''Bridge, My Way'' (1992), Zia offered a £1 million bet that no four-person team of his choosing would be beaten by a computer. A few years later the bridge program ''GIB'', brainchild of American computer scientist Matthew Ginsberg,&lt;ref name="Ginsberg"&gt;[http://www.cirl.uoregon.edu/~ginsberg/ Ginsberg profile]&lt;/ref&gt; proved capable of expert declarer plays like [[winkle squeeze]]s in play tests. In 1996, Zia withdrew his bet. Two years later, ''GIB'' became the world champion in computer bridge, and also had a 12th place score (11210) in declarer play compared to 34 of the top humans in the 1998 Par Contest (including Zia Mahmood).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.worldbridge.org/bulletin/98_2%20Lille/pdf/bul_02.pdf | title=Rosenberg Wins Par Contest}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such a par contest measures technical bridge analysis skills only{{clarifyme|date=September 2016}}, and in 1999 Zia beat various computer programs, including ''GIB'', in an individual round robin match.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.msoworld.com/mindzine/news/bridge/reviews/misc/man.html Foreword to ''Man vs Machine - The Bridge Match of the Millennium''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060514115301/http://msoworld.com/mindzine/news/bridge/reviews/misc/man.html |date=2006-05-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further progress in the field of computer bridge has resulted in stronger bridge playing programs, including ''Jack'' &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jackbridge.com/eindex.htm Jack homepage]&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Wbridge5''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wbridge5.com WBridge5 homepage (in French)]&lt;/ref&gt; These programs have been ranked highly in national bridge rankings. A series of articles published in 2005 and 2006 in the Dutch bridge magazine [[List of significant bridge books and magazines|''IMP'']] describes matches between five-time computer bridge world champion ''Jack'' and seven top Dutch pairs including a [[Bermuda Bowl]] winner and two reigning European champions. A total of 196 boards were played. ''Jack'' defeated three out of the seven pairs (including the European champions). Overall, the program lost by a small margin (359 versus 385 [[International Match Point|IMPs]]).{{volume needed|date=September 2018}}

==Cardplay algorithms==
Bridge poses challenges to its players that are different from board games such as [[chess]] and [[go (game)|go]]. Most notably, bridge is a [[stochastic]] game of incomplete information. At the start of a deal, the information available to each player is limited to just his/her own cards. During the bidding and the subsequent play, more information becomes available via the bidding of the other three players at the table, the cards of the partner of the declarer (the dummy) being put open on the table, and the cards played at each trick. However, it is only at the end of the play that full information is obtained.

Today's top-level bridge programs deal with this probabilistic nature by [[Monte Carlo method|generating many samples]] representing the unknown hands. Each sample is generated at random, but constrained to be compatible with all information available so far from the bidding and the play. Next, the result of different lines of play are tested against optimal defense for each sample. This testing is done using a so-called "double-dummy solver" that uses extensive search algorithms to determine the optimum line of play for both parties. The line of play that generates the best score averaged over all samples is selected as the optimal play.

Efficient double-dummy solvers are key to successful bridge-playing programs. Also, as the amount of computation increases with sample size, techniques such as [[importance sampling]] are used to generate sets of samples that are of minimum size but still representative.

==Comparison to other strategy games==
While bridge is a game of incomplete information, a double-dummy solver analyses a simplified version of the game where there is [[perfect information]]; the bidding is ignored, the contract (trump suit and declarer) is given, and all players are assumed to know all cards from the very start. The solver can therefore use many of the [[game tree]] search techniques typically used in solving two-player perfect-information win/lose/draw games such as [[chess]], [[go (game)|go]] and [[reversi]]. However, there are some significant differences.

* Although double-dummy bridge is in practice a competition between two generalised players, each "player" controls two hands and the cards must be played in a correct order that reflects four players. (It makes a difference which of the four hands wins a trick and must lead the next trick.)
* Double-dummy bridge is not simply win/lose/draw and not exactly [[zero-sum]], but constant-sum since two playing sides compete for 13 tricks. It is trivial to transform a constant-sum game into a zero-sum game. Moreover, the goal (and the risk management strategy) in general contract bridge depends not only on the contract but also on the form of tournament. However, since the double-dummy version is deterministic, the goal is simple: one can without loss of generality aim to maximize the number of tricks taken.
* Bridge is incrementally scored; each played trick contributes irreversibly to the final "score" in terms of tricks won or lost. This is in contrast to games where the final outcome is more or less open until the game ends. In bridge, the already determined tricks provide natural lower and upper bounds for [[alpha-beta pruning]], and the interval shrinks naturally as the search goes deeper. Other games typically need an artificial [[evaluation function]] to enable alpha-beta pruning at limited depth, or must search to a leaf node before pruning is possible.
* It is relatively inexpensive to compute "sure winners" in various positions in a double-dummy solver. This information improves the pruning. It can be regarded as a kind of [[evaluation function]], however while the latter in other games is an approximation of the value of the position, the former is a definitive lower bound on the value of the position.
* During the course of double-dummy game tree search, one can establish equivalence classes consisting of cards with apparently equal value in a particular position. Only one card from each equivalence class needs to be considered in the subtree search, and furthermore, when using a [[transposition table]], equivalence classes can be exploited to improve the hit rate. This has been described as ''partition search'' by Matthew Ginsberg.
{{unsolved|computer science|Is the problem of [[decision problem|deciding]] the winner in double-dummy bridge [[Computational complexity theory#Reduction|hard]] in any [[complexity class]]?}}
*Numerous strategy games have been proven hard in a [[complexity class]], meaning that any problem in that complexity class can be reduced in [[Polynomial-time reduction|polynomial time]] to that problem. For example, generalized {{math|x × x}} [[chess]] has been proven {{math|[[EXPSPACE]]}}-complete (both in {{math|EXPSPACE}} and {{math|EXPSPACE}}-hard), effectively meaning that it is among the hardest problems in {{math|EXPSPACE}}. However, since there is no natural structure to exploit in double-dummy bridge towards a hardness proof or disproof, unlike in a board game, the question of hardness remains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Hearn |first=Robert Aubrey |date=2006 |title=Games, puzzles, and computation |type=Doctoral}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The future==
In comparison to [[computer chess]], computer bridge has not reached world-class level, but the top robots have demonstrated a consistently high level of play. (See analysis of the last few years of play at [http://www.computerbridge.com www.computerbridge.com].) However see below the Philippe Pionchon's article (1984). Yet, whereas computer chess has taught programmers little about building machines that offer human-like intelligence, more [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuitive]] and probabilistic games such as [[Contract bridge|bridge]] might provide a better testing ground.

The question of whether bridge-playing programs will reach world-class level in the foreseeable future is not easy to answer. Computer bridge has not attracted an amount of interest anywhere near to that of computer chess. On the other hand, much progress has been made in the last decade by researchers working in the field.

Regardless of bridge robots' level of play, computer bridge already has changed the analysis of the game. Commercially available double-dummy programs can solve bridge problems in which all four hands are known, typically within a fraction of a second. These days, few editors of [[List of bridge books|books]] and [[List of bridge magazines|magazines]] will solely rely on humans to analyse bridge problems before publications. Also, more and more bridge players and coaches utilize computer analysis in the ''post-mortem'' of a match.

'''Daniel Trust Foundation''' is a [[non-profit organization]] founded by [[Daniel Trust]]. It was launched in 2009 and has provided mentorship and scholarship opportunities to high school seniors and student-selected recognition and funding for high school teachers. The primary aims of the foundation are to expand educational opportunities and financial resources for college-bound students and secondary school teachers. The foundation has offices in [[Bridgeport, Connecticut]] and [[New York City]], and aims to be a student run organization for students by students. &lt;ref&gt;Trust, Daniel. ''Meet the Leadership Team.''The Daniel Trust Foundation, &lt;http://www.danieltrustfoundation.org/LeadershipTeam.html &gt;[Accessed 2016 June 14]&lt;/ref&gt;

The foundation awards students who have demonstrated academic excellence, activism or community service and commitment to pursuing higher education. The Kathy Silver Award is the foundation's teacher recognition program. In the scholarship application, students nominate an impactful high school teacher who is then considered for the award. It is a [[501(c)3 organization]] with scholars and teacher honorees from [[Connecticut]], [[California]], [[New York (state)|New York]], and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]]. &lt;ref&gt;Mowry, Christina.

'''Dissernet''' ({{lang-ru|Диссернет}}) is a volunteer community network working to clean Russian science of [[plagiarism]]. The core activity of the community is conducting examinations of [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] and [[habilitation]] (higher doctorate) theses defended in Russian scientific and educational institutions since the end of the 1990s, and making the results of such examinations known to as many people as possible. The community is composed of professional scientists working in various fields of science both in Russia and abroad, and also journalists, civil activists and volunteers.

Launched in early 2013, the project had by 2016 identified around 5,600 suspected plagiarists — focusing on officials in government and academia, and other member the country's elite — and released reports on around 1,300 of them.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html|title=The Craziest Black Market in Russia|last=Neyfakh|first=Leon|date=2016-05-22|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-05-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230022705/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html|archivedate=2016-12-30|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russian media regularly report on Dissernet's findings, and the site has been credited with raising attention for the issue of [[academic fraud]] in the country.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a 2016 exposé, Dissernet showed that 1 in 9 members of the [[State Duma]] had obtained academic degrees with theses that were substantially plagiarized and likely ghostwritten.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Activities ==
The objective of Dissernet’s examinations is to detect gross and deliberate violations of the legally established rules for certification of scientific workers’, as well as violations of the regulations for awarding  [[academic degree]]s. Dissernet  deems theses containing such violations to be fraudulent, and diplomas certifying the doctoral and higher doctoral degrees conferred after defending such theses to be illegal and subject to cancellation.

The key elements of the dissertation fraud detected in the course of Dissernet’s analyses are as follows:

* Large-scale, bad faith and non-attributed  plagiarism   of other people's scientific works and other texts used by the authors of examined works in breach of the proper citation rules fixed in regulations of the  [[Higher Attestation Commission]] (VAK) of the [[Ministry of Education and Science (Russia)|Ministry of Education and Science of Russia]];
* Falsification of scientific research articles which, according to VAK regulations, are a mandatory prerequisite for awarding the respective academic degree to the applicant;
* Gross violations of the rules for thesis preparation (documenting performed research, interaction with the scientific research supervisor, advisor, opponents, co-authors, getting formal responses, etc.) as well as the procedure for defense of the thesis prescribed by VAK regulations.

Within the active phase of Dissernet’s activity, which started in January 2013, its members have published results of examinations of thesis defended by scores of well-known and powerful Russian politicians and public figures. As of the{{Clarify|date=August 2015}} middle of the year 2014, more than 2000 completed expertises of Doctoral and higher doctoral theses in various directions and branches of science were contained in Dissernet database.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dissernet.org/expertise The latest expertises] on the Dissernet site&lt;/ref&gt; Among the people attracting Dissernet’s attention were deputies of the [[State Duma]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alexandrova|first=Lyudmila|url=http://en.itar-tass.com/opinions/1451|title= Russia’s bloggers help authorities expose forged dissertations|publisher=[[Russian News Agency TASS]]|date=March 20, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; members of the [[Federation Council (Russia)|Federation Council]], [[governor (Russia)|governors]] of constituent entities of the Russian Federation, high-ranking officials of executive authorities,&lt;ref name="investigators"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.ria.ru/crime/20131125/184982011/Russias-Top-Investigator-Accused-of-Plagiarism.html|title=Russia’s Top Investigator Accused of Plagiarism|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=November 25, 2013|accessdate= February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; heads of security and military services, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rupaper.com/post/12076|title=The Moscow minister will ask to cancel his thesis|publisher=Rupaper.com |date= December 2, 2013|accessdate=February 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''European Culture and Economy''', shortened as '''ECUE''', is an interdisciplinary postgraduate program that is distinct from [[European studies|European Studies]]. Both focus on European politics and developments. After receiving the academic degree [[Master of Arts]], graduates of ECUE may engage in various business fields, however, especially [[European Union|EU]]-related professions are targeted.

==History==
The [[Ruhr University Bochum]] in Germany is currently the only university to offer European Culture and Economy as a path of study.&lt;ref&gt;http://studieren.de/hochschule.0.html?&amp;tx_assearchengine_pi2&lt;/ref&gt; It is a small branch, approximately 30 students are accepted each year. It was first introduced in the winter term of 1999/2000 and has since become an established [[Master's degree|Masters]]&lt;nowiki /&gt;programme. Initially, ECUE was a way of giving arts scholars a fundamental understanding of economics, politics and intercultural competences. In its early stages, the program was supported financially by the [[German Academic Exchange Service]] (DAAD) as well as [[German Rectors' Conference]] (HRK).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nordrheinwestfalendirekt.de/broschuerenservice/download/173/auslandserfahrung.pdf p.76&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, its level of quality was confirmed by ACQUIN,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.acquin.org/de/akkreditiert/akkreditiertstudiengang.php?id=12845&amp;titel_studiengang=europ%C3%A4ische+kultur+und+wirtschaft&amp;standort=&amp;hochschule=&amp;sonstiger_hochschulname=&amp;fachausschuesse=&lt;/ref&gt; a German Quality Assurance Institute. Students of ECUE are intended to qualify as ''specialized generalist'' and be prepared for careers in international companies and institutions. The expected duration of study is four terms.

==Curriculum==
The curriculum puts an emphasis on examining the European area from an economic, cultural, political and sociological perspective. During Colloquia and an obligatory excursion (to Brussels), the interrelations of the disciplines are linked and investigated. Additionally, the students' intercultural competences and research methods are trained.

Seminars of the following disciplines are included in the program:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ruhr-uni-bochum.de/ecue/en/&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Law]]
* [[Economics]]
* [[History]]
* [[Political science]]
* [[Sociology]]
* [[Cultural studies]]
* [[Philosophy]]

The interdisciplinary and intercultural approach teaches students to analyze European topics from a cultural, economical and political angle. Next to interdisciplinary, ECUE stresses international relations. Many of the available places are assigned to foreign students.&lt;ref&gt;Handbuch Europa in NRW (p. 59,60)&lt;/ref&gt; So far, students of 30 different nations (Africa, U.S.A., Asia, many European countries) were able to successfully complete the program.

==Admission==
To be granted admission to the program, a very good to excellent [[Bachelor's degree]] is required. Furthermore, students must possess a good proficiency in the teaching languages, English and German.
Further, a term abroad or an internship are possible ways to organize the program.

'''Game Dev Tycoon''' is a business [[simulation video game]] developed by Greenheart Games, which first released on December 10, 2012.&lt;ref name="GreenHchat"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenheartgames.com/game-dev-tycoon-changelog/ | title=Game Dev Tycoon Changelog | publisher=Greenheart Games | accessdate=2013-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the game, the player creates and develops video games. ''Game Dev Tycoon'' was inspired by the iOS and Android game, ''[[Game Dev Story]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenheartgames.com/about/ | title=About Greenheart Games | publisher=Greenheart Games | accessdate=2013-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; (by [[Kairosoft]]), and many critics find substantial similarities between the two games. ''Game Dev Tycoon'' was created by Greenheart Games, a company founded in July 2012 by brothers Patrick and Daniel Klug.

==Anti-piracy release==
The game's developers implemented a unique anti-piracy measure for ''Game Dev Tycoon''. Patrick Klug, founder of Greenheart Games, knowing that the game was likely to be torrented extensively, purposely released a cracked version of the game and uploaded it himself to torrent sites. Gameplay in this version is identical except for one variation, as players progress through the game they receive the following message:

{{quote
|Boss, it seems that while many players play our new game, they steal it by downloading a cracked version rather than buying it legally. If players don't buy the games they like, we will sooner or later go bankrupt.
|[[Greenheart Games]], ''Game Dev Tycoon''
}}

Eventually players of the cracked version will gradually lose money until they do go bankrupt, as a result of pirates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://aussie-gamer.com/news/australian-game-developer-trolls-internet-pirates/ |title=Australian Game Developer Trolls Internet Pirates |publisher=Aussie-gamer.com |date=2013-04-30 |accessdate=2013-12-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131214165241/http://aussie-gamer.com/news/australian-game-developer-trolls-internet-pirates/ |archivedate=2013-12-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; News site Ars Technica reported that some players complained on message forums about this piracy feature, unaware that it only appeared because they themselves pirated the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Orland|first1=Kyle|title=Game Dev Tycoon developers give pirates a taste of their own medicine|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2013/04/game-dev-tycoon-developers-give-pirates-a-taste-of-their-own-medicine/|accessdate=17 November 2016|work=Ars Technica|date=29 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Progression==
The player starts out in a garage in the early 1980s during the [[golden age of arcade video games]] with no employees, limited money, and limited choices for the first game. As new games are created, new options are unlocked. When the first game engine is built, the player's game development skills improve. New consoles will also be released, and the player will be able to buy licenses for certain consoles, such as the GS, PlaySystem, mBox, and grPad which parody real life consoles and devices with different names due to trademark regulations. As the player progresses through the game further they have the opportunity to move to new offices and hire staff. After that further expansion is available, with players given the opportunity to open an R&amp;D lab when reaching certain requirements that host major projects, allowing the player to unlock things they wouldn't be able to otherwise, such as MMOs and online game shops similar to [[Steam (software)|Steam]], [[Uplay]], [[App Store (iOS)|App Store]] etc. The player may also open up a Hardware Lab to create consoles and devices.

==Reception==

}}

''Game Dev Tycoon'' received varied reviews upon release. [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gave the game a score of 68 based on 21 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref name="MCPC" /&gt; Besides the mixed reviews on Metacritic, on the [[Steam (software)|Steam]] Community, the game received a 95%, based on over 20,000 reviews. The game was cited as "Overwhelmingly Positive" on its Steam page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://store.steampowered.com/app/239820/ | title=Game Dev Tycoon on Steam |work=Steam |accessdate=March 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mods ==
The game has native support for writing mods in [[JavaScript]] with the [[gdt-modAPI]]. Users have used this on the [[Steam Workshop]] with 663 mods listed as of May 26, 2018&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://steamcommunity.com/app/239820/workshop/|title=Steam Community :: Game Dev Tycoon|website=steamcommunity.com|access-date=2018-05-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;. They range from simple thing such as adding new consoles and "Topics" to making new libraries like [[UltimateLib]]. One of the most common ways people make these mods is with a [[Third-party software component]] called [[Ultimate Module Editor]].

== Gameplay ==
Gameplay involves fixing up properties in order to create a profit. Tasks that can be performed include painting, laying down tile, cleaning, installations, and demolition.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

== Reception ==
''House Flipper'' received "mixed or average reviews" according to [[review aggregator]] [[Metacritic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=House Flipper for PC Reviews |url=http://www.metacritic.com/game/pc/house-flipper |website=Metacritic |publisher=CBS Interactive |accessdate=28 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; with multiple reviewers commenting that fixing up the homes is satisfying while questioning its long-term playability. [[Kotaku]] reviewed the game, stating that they found it satisfying to fix up homes that are "often extremely gross or ugly" and that "Manifesting your vision of a decent, sellable house onto these garbage heaps feels amazing—especially because it happens on such a granular scale."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://kotaku.com/steam-top-seller-house-flipper-makes-it-fun-to-watch-pa-1826205207|title=Steam Top Seller House Flipper Makes It Fun To Watch Paint Dry|last=D'Anastasio|first=Cecilia|work=Kotaku|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Game Informer was more mixed, writing that "Flipping your first few houses is fun, but the game doesn’t have the scope or flexibility to stay interesting for long".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gameinformer.com/review/house-flipper/a-definite-fixer-upper|title=House Flipper Review – A Definite Fixer-Upper|work=Game Informer|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; PC Gamer was critical, stating that "There's a definite satisfaction in taking a gross room and making it look nice, and it's pretty cool that you can knock down (and rebuild) walls, but I just don't find the act of slowly and mechanically painting and cleaning much fun, especially with the knowledge that my actual house could do with a bit of that."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcgamer.com/house-flipper-is-like-viscera-cleanup-detail-only-for-super-gross-houses/|title=House Flipper is like Viscera Cleanup Detail only for super gross houses|last=|first=|date=|work=PC Gamer|access-date=2018-06-26|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jane Kelleher Fernandes''' (born August 21, 1956 in [[Worcester, Massachusetts]]) is a [[Hearing impairment|deaf]] educator and was the [[Provost (education)|Provost]] and Vice Chancellor for Academic Affairs at the [[University of North Carolina Asheville]].  She is the 9th President of [[Guilford College]] as of April 15, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.guilford.edu/who-we-are/president Office of the President] [[Guilford College]]&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Early life and education==
Fernandes was raised in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]] and is the daughter of Richard Paul and Mary Kathleen (nee Cosgrove) Kelleher. Her family chose to raise her in an [[Oralism|oral education program]], meaning her education focused on teaching her to speak.  Her mother was deaf and was raised orally, as well. When Fernandes grew older she made the decision to learn [[American Sign Language]] (ASL) and develop her involvement with the [[deaf community]].

Fernandes attended [[Trinity College (Connecticut)|Trinity College]], earning a B.A. degree in [[French language|French]] and [[comparative literature]], and the [[University of Iowa]], where she earned her M.A. and Ph. D., both in [[comparative literature]].

==Career==  
After graduating from Iowa, she worked for [[Northeastern University, Boston|Northeastern University]] before coming to Gallaudet as chair of Sign Communication. Her next move was to [[Hawaii]] where she established an Interpreter Training Program and served for five years as the director of the [[Hawaii School for the Deaf and the Blind]].  On April 15, 2014, Fernandes was named the 9th President of [[Guilford College]]. She succeeded [[Kent Chabotar]] on July 1, 2014, becoming the first woman to hold this position.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guilford.edu/news/item/index.aspx?LinkId=212&amp;ModuleId=51 Jane Fernandes named President of Guilford College]&lt;/ref&gt; On August 26, 2015, Fernandes was formally inaugurated as the first female and the ninth president of [[Guilford College]].&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.wfmynews2.com/story/news/local/2015/08/26/guilford-college-welcomes-new-president-jane-k-fernandes/32410435/ Guilford College Welcomes New President Jane K. Fernades]&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Involvement at Gallaudet University===
In 1995 she returned to Gallaudet to become the vice president for the Laurent Clerc National Deaf Education Center. In 2000, she was named [[provost (education)|provost]] of the university by President [[I. King Jordan]], who appointed her without consulting the faculty, a move which Jordan called "a terrible mistake".&lt;ref&gt;Myers, Bill. "Gallaudet chief says successor being punlished for old mistake," ''Washington Examiner,'' May 10, 2006, page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Thacker"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2006/10/18/jordan|title=Gallaudet's President Has His Say|last=Thacker|first=Paul|date=October 18, 2006|publisher=Inside Higher Ed|accessdate=4 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fernandes in her application for the university presidency wrote:{{quote|Gallaudet’s mission holds both personal and professional meaning for me.  I am a white deaf woman, the daughter of a deaf mother and a hearing father, with both deaf and hearing brothers, all of whom are white people. The generations of white deaf and hearing people in my family have never signed; they have always been oral people. Having grown up deaf, I came to learn Sign Language relatively late, at the age of 23, while I was a graduate student at the University of Iowa. From that time on, I have embraced signing and visual communication as the keystone of deaf education and now the uniting feature of Gallaudet’s diverse, deaf community. While we respect a variety of communication modes and languages among deaf people, we must also unite in affirming visucentric public discourse.&lt;ref&gt;Application of Fernandes {{cite web|url=http://pr.gallaudet.edu/presidentalsearch/?ID=8639 |title=Application |accessdate=2007-09-08 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060618170824/http://pr.gallaudet.edu/presidentalsearch/?ID=8639 |archivedate=June 18, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Immediately after the announcement of the appointment of Fernandes as [[Gallaudet University]] president, scores of students [[Unity_for_Gallaudet|protested against her appointment]]. According to ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "Students objected to the appointment of Jane Fernandes, who is deaf and is currently the university's provost, because she did not grow up using [[American Sign Language]]. Some students also criticized Fernandes for not having warm relations with students."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/03/AR2006050300920.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Gallaudet Names New President | first=Susan | last=Kinzie | date=May 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opponents of Fernandes claim that the ''Washington Post'' article (and, in general, much of the media coverage), were unable to figure out the real reasons for their opposition, although a frequently published reason was that she was "not Deaf enough." The protesters pointed to her past managerial actions that they felt were questionable and did not reflect qualities of a solid leader. Fernandes also attracted opposition due to a perception that she was insufficiently committed to addressing the problem of [[audism]] (discrimination against or persecution of anyone based on hearing status). The student paper took polls a few days before the selection. Of those faculty members who responded, 36% gave Fernandes an "acceptable" rating, compared to 53% and 64% for the two other finalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/05/02/AR2006050201694_2.html | work=The Washington Post | title=Ideas Exchanged as Protest Continues at Gallaudet | first=Susan | last=Kinzie | date=May 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 29, 2006, the Board of Trustees of Gallaudet University rescinded her contract to be the ninth President of Gallaudet and terminated her in her position as President-designate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.apnewsarchive.com/2006/Gallaudet-Rejects-Incoming-President/id-922c86f1db703f7d629db77ea7a8bc1b Gallaudet Rejects Incoming President - Associated Press, October 29, 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Landakot School''' ({{lang-is|'''Landakotsskóli'''}}) is one of the oldest running [[Education in Iceland|schools in Iceland]], established in 1896. The school offers a safe, caring and home-like environment for students of all nationalities. Students attending the school range in age from 5–16 years old; in Iceland this is K-10th grade.

Located in central [[Reykjavík]], Landakotsskóli is Iceland's oldest and longest-running private school. An independent, non-denominational day school, it offers modern facilities in a well-maintained traditional setting. The school has ample play and green spaces, as well as an adjacent park, and currently serves some 200 students.

==Academics==

Landakotskóli follows the [http://www.menntamalaraduneyti.is/utgefid-efni/namskrar/adalnamskra-grunnskola/ National Icelandic Curriculum] with an emphasis on mathematics, languages, arts and an innovative art curriculum. Its academic record is strong based on a longstanding tradition of outstanding results. The school's International Department follows the [[Cambridge Curriculum]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cie.org.uk/programmes-and-qualifications/cambridge-primary/cambridge-primary/curriculum/ Cambridge Curriculum]&lt;/ref&gt; developed by the University of Cambridge. The program covers the key core subject areas of English, mathematics and science. This curriculum provides continuous and flexible assessment to suit each learner's needs, as well as standardized assessment at each milestone in a student's educational career.

==International Department==

The school's new (established 2015–16) international department was inspired by the increasing diversity of the school's student body and the city's need for an international program to meet the needs of Iceland's expatriate business, diplomatic and academic community; families temporarily resident in Iceland; students returning from abroad who wish to continue their studies in English; and Icelandic families seeking global perspectives in education. The school has a strong academic record,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gestsson|first1=Sveinbjörn|last2=Skúlason|first2=Sigurgrímur|title=Samræmd könnunarpróf: Niðurstöður fyrir árið 2014|url=http://www.menntamalaraduneyti.is/frettir/forsidugreinar/nr/8262|website=The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture|publisher=Námsmatsstofnun|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on a longstanding tradition of outstanding results in national examinations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gestsson|first1=Sveinbjörn|last2=Skúlason|first2=Sigurgrímur|title=Samræmd könnunarpróf: Niðurstöður fyrir árið 2014|url=http://www.menntamalaraduneyti.is/frettir/forsidugreinar/nr/8262|website=The Ministry of Education, Science and Culture|publisher=Námsmatsstofnun|accessdate=8 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an emphasis on foreign languages and an innovative arts curriculum, provide a solid foundation on which to develop an international program.

While core subjects are taught in separate classrooms, students in the International Department are fully integrated into Landakotsskóli student life. They study alongside their peers in the Icelandic program in art, dance, drama, gym, swimming, technology and woodworking. This gives international students and their families a unique opportunity to integrate into the life of the local community and deepen their experience of living in the country, at the same time enabling them to seamlessly continue their education using a global, English-language curriculum.

In addition to core subjects, arts and sports, the Department offers many other activities such as [[STEM fields|STEM]], [[Lego]] [[Robotics]], computer programming, Chinese, drama, music and chess.

===MAP testing===

[https://test.mapnwea.org/ MAP] (Measures of Academic Progress) from the Northweast Evaluation Association is a powerful assessment tool engineered to adapt to each student´s learning level and provide a holistic picture of his/her academic progress and growth.

== United States involvement==
In 2006, the [http://www.usembassy.gov/ United States Embassy] presented 110 English language books to the school. These books covered a wide variety of topics. This donation was part of the Embassy's initiative to support the teaching of English.

'''McDaniel College Budapest''' is the European Campus of [[McDaniel College]], an accredited, private selective College of the [[Liberal Arts]] and Sciences, located in [[Westminster, Maryland]], United States.&lt;ref name="baltimore sun"&gt;[http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/education/bal-hl-mcdaniel-story.html Baltimore Sun School Profile: McDaniel]&lt;/ref&gt; It offers a standard American four-year undergraduate program in [[Hungary]], leading to an American Bachelor of Arts degree. Students have the option to complete the upper two years of study at the main campus of the college in the United States. In addition, students enrolled in Budapest earn credits that are fully transferable to any other American college or university.&lt;ref name="american degree"&gt;[http://mcdaniel.hu/the-college/american-degree/ McDaniel College Budapest/The College/American Degree]&lt;/ref&gt;

The European Campus of McDaniel College in [[Budapest]] is accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the [[Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools]], the accrediting agency for McDaniel College. McDaniel College Budapest is registered in Hungary as a foreign institution of higher education by the permission of the Hungarian Minister of Education.

== History ==
The Budapest campus of McDaniel College was established in 1993 and the first academic year started in September 1994. Originally it was placed in a modern educational centre on the Buda side and moved to its recent location in 2001, a restored late 19th century school building.&lt;ref name="history budapest"&gt;[http://www.mcdaniel.edu/information/about/partners/mcdaniel-europe McDaniel College/Information/About/History]&lt;/ref&gt;  Since its founding, more than 300 students who began their studies in Budapest have graduated from McDaniel College. In addition, several hundred students from McDaniel College in Westminster as well as other colleges have studied abroad there. 

In 2017 the campus was at the center of a political controversy in Hungary that could have led to its closure. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/higher-ed/bs-md-mcdaniel-hungary-20170629-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; The crisis was eventually resolved and the satellite campus was left open.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/education/higher-ed/bs-md-maryland-hungry-agreement-20170714-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:McDaniel Graduation.jpg|thumb|right|McDaniel Graduation]]

== Majors ==
McDaniel College Budapest offers a number of major programs, from art history, business, and communication, to political science and psychology. Students can enter the program as undecided, sample a number of different courses, and then choose their major. In addition, if students decide they would like to pursue a major different than the one they started, they are free to change majors—all of the credits earned remain on a student’s record, and no time is lost for graduation. Some of the majors can be pursued in combined dual major programs—art-communication, business-economics—that combine features of more than one major program in order to give students more options after graduation.&lt;ref name="majors"&gt;[http://mcdaniel.hu/majors/overview/ McDaniel College Budapest/Majors]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Study Abroad ==

The Budapest Campus also serves as a study abroad centre. Students from the home campus – usually accompanied by a professor teaching his/her courses – have been arriving for a semester abroad in Budapest since 1998. The study abroad semester includes a weekend study tour in Hungary and a 5-day tour to Vienna and Venice.The Study Abroad program is open for any undergraduate, especially ones studying at US or Canadian undergraduate programs.

== Students ==

Students from more than twenty countries study at the College.&lt;ref name="student body"&gt;[http://mcdaniel.hu/student-life/student-body-2/ McDaniel College Budapest/Student Life/Student Body]&lt;/ref&gt; Classes are conducted in English. Campus has a student newspaper, Messenger.&lt;ref&gt;https://mcdanielmessengeronline.wordpress.com/about/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alumni ==

'''Michael Joyce''' (born 1945) is a professor of English at [[Vassar College]], New York, US. He is also an important author and critic of [[electronic literature]].

Joyce's ''[[afternoon, a story]]'', 1987, was among the first literary works of [[hypertext fiction]] to present itself as undeniably serious literature, and experimented with the short-story form in novel ways. It was created with the then-new [[Storyspace]] software, deployed the ambiguity and dubious narrator characteristic of high [[modernism]], along with some suspense and romance elements, in a story whose meaning could change dramatically depending on the path taken through its [[Node (textual)|lexias]] on each reading. For instance, a hard-to-find series of lexias presented a new set of facts about the narrator's actions which affects the reader's judgment of the narrator. In ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Robert Coover]] called ''afternoon'' "the granddaddy of hypertext fictions",&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/09/27/specials/coover-end.html The End of Books].

Eastgate.com. Retrieved on 2013-07-28.&lt;/ref&gt; His ''Twilight, A Symphony'' (1996) was his second hypertext novel.

Joyce's published books include ''War outside Ireland: a novel'' (1982), ''Of two minds: hypertext pedagogy and poetics'' (1995), ''Othermindedness: the emergence of network culture'' (2000), ''Moral tales and meditations: technological parables and refractions'' (2001) and ''Foucault, in Winter, in the Linnaeus Garden'' (2015). He is a graduate of the [[Iowa Writers Workshop]]. He has been a Professor of English and Media Studies at [[Vassar College]] in [[Poughkeepsie]].

Joyce has collaborated with [[Los Angeles]]-based visual artist [[Alexandra Grant]]. The work Grant has made based on his texts ("The Ladder Quartet" and the "Six Portals") has been exhibited at the [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles]] and Honor Fraser Gallery in Los Angeles.

The '''National Council of Education''' (or '''NCE''') was an organisation founded by [[Indian nationalists]] in [[Bengal]] in 1906 to promote science and technology as part of a ''[[swadeshi]]'' industrialisation movement. It established the [[Bengal National College]] and [[Bengal Institute]] which would later merge to form [[Jadavpur University]]. Institutions functioning under the Council were considered to be hotbeds of swadeshi activities and the government banned nationalistic activities such as the singing of patriotic songs.&lt;ref name=palit&gt;{{cite book |last=Palit |first=Chittabrata |date=2011 |editor-last=Gupta |editor-first=Uma Das |title=Science and modern India : an institutional history, c. 1784-1947 | location=Delhi |publisher=Longman Pearson Education |pages=851–852 |isbn=9788131753750}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=National_Council_of_Education|title=National Council of Education - Banglapedia|website=en.banglapedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
University of Calcutta One of the three universities in modern India,&lt;ref&gt;Other two being Bombay (now Mumbai) and Madras University&lt;/ref&gt; set up by the British in Calcutta in 1861 as a means of spreading western philosophical thought among the elite in India. Towards the end of the 19th century, a strong nationalist movement and identity arose within the Indian subcontinent, which was particularly prominent in Bengal, which by the start of 1900 had seen the beginnings of the ''Swadeshi'' movement, which drew a substantial contribution from the youth of Bengal. Leading nationalists saw the Calcutta University as a predominantly a Western Institution. Its focus on Western Themed philosophy and humanities at the expense of Indian ones,  and the large number of ICS and administrative officers from amongst its graduates were seen to form the bulwark of British colonialism, and the Calcutta University came to be termed ''Goldighir Ghulamkhana'' (the slavehouse by the lake, with reference to a lake beside which the university was situated).

==Dawn society==
{{Main|Satish Chandra Mukherjee|Dawn (Bengali educational society)|Dawn (Bengali magazine)}}
[[Satish Chandra Mukherjee]], a Bengali Indianteacher who taught in the South Calcutta suburb of Bhowanipore, set up in 1895 the ''[[Bhagabat Chatushpati]]''. This institute promoted history and understandings of Indian religions and philosophy. In 1897 he founded the ''Dawn'' Magazine and in 1902, Mukherjee founded the ''Dawn society''. Through his society and magazine, Mukherjee promulgated Indian philosophies and teachings, and criticised the Calcutta University's syllabus for its lack of emphasis on what he believed to be necessary for nation building. Mukherjee's work, in the nascent nationalist sentiments, found support among leading luminaries of Bengal at the time. Soon, the ''Dawn society'' was calling for nationalist education with emphasis on sciences and focus towards Indian values.&lt;ref name=Chattopadhyaya1999p851&gt;{{cite book |last=Chattopadhyaya |first=Debi Prasad |date=1999 |title=History of Science, Philosophy and Culture in Indian Civilization: pt. 1.

==Universities act 1904==
{{Main|Indian Universities Commission 1902|Indian Universities Act, 1904}}
Lord Curzon had introduced the Universities act, 1904, much to the chargin of the native populace of Bengal who saw this as a means to limit access to English educational institutions from the native populations. The government also decided to disaffiliate many private Indian colleges, which had come up lately and were regarded by the Government as hot beds of nationalist agitation. The measures stirred the educated middle class to move for alternative systems of education.
The real impetus though was provided by the partition of Bengal by [[Lord Curzon]], the then [[Governor-General of India]], into East Bengal on the one hand (the area that was eventually to become [[Bangladesh]] in 1971) and West Bengal and [[Odisha]] on the other. The young men of Bengal were amongst the most active in the ''[[Swadeshi]]'' movement, and the participation of university students drew the ire of the Raj. [[R.W. Carlyle]] prohibited the participation of students in political meetings on the threat of withdrawal of funding and grants. The decade preceding these decrees had seen Bengali intellectuals increasingly calling for indigenous schools and colleges to replace British institutions.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==National Council for Education==
On 16 November 1905, the Landholders Society organized a meeting at Park Street, attended by around 1500 delegates, including [[Rabindranath Tagore]], [[Aurobindo Ghosh]], Raja [[Subodh Chandra Mullick]] and [[Brajendra Kishore Roychowdhury]]. The idea of the National Council of Education was mooted here. While in a meeting held on 9 November 1905 at the Field and Academic Club, Subodh Chandra Mullick pledged Rupees one lakh for the foundation of a National University in Bengal. The objective in setting up the institution that was to challenge the British rule over education by offering education to the masses 'on national lines and under national control'. Generous sums of money were also donated by Brojendra Kishore Roy Choudhury, Maharaja Suryya Kanto Acharya Choudhury and [[Rashbihari Ghosh]], who was appointed the first president of the university. Aurobindo served as the first Principal of the college. The organisation in its early days was intricately associated with the nascent revolutionary nationalism in Bengal at the time. It was during his time as Principal that Aurobindo started his nationalist publications ''[[Jugantar]]'', ''[[Karmayogin]]'' and ''[[Bande Mataram]]''.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} The Student's mess at the College was frequented by students of East Bengal who belonged to the Dhaka branch of the [[Anushilan Samiti]], and was known to be hotbed of revolutionary nationalism, which was uncontrolled or even encouraged by the college.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7282">The '''National Learning Network''' (NLN) was a UK national partnership programme designed to increase the uptake of Information Learning Technology (ILT) across the learning and skills sector in England. Supported by the [[Learning and Skills Council]] and other sector bodies, the NLN provided network infrastructure and a wide-ranging programme of support, information and training, as well as the NLN Materials − a substantial range of [[e-learning]] content. The initiative began in 1999 with the aim of helping to transform post-16 education. The Government's total investment in the NLN totalled £156 million over a five-year period.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archive.excellencegateway.org.uk/pdf/chips_nov_07_supp.pdf|title = Chips with Everything (NLN Special)|publisher = NIACE|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130721002115/http%3A//archive.excellencegateway.org.uk/pdf/chips_nov_07_supp.pdf|archivedate = 2013-07-21|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the network itself is no longer operational, the main output of the initiative − the '''NLN Materials''' − continue to represent one of the most substantial and wide-ranging collections of e-learning materials in the UK. Available free to the post-16 sector, they are still actively promoted and updated.

== History ==

The seeds for the UK's '''National Learning Network''' ('''NLN''') were sown in the spring of 1999 through the collaboration of the [[Further Education Funding Council for England]] (FEFC), the [[Higher Education Funding Council for England]] (HEFCE) and agencies like [[Becta]], [[NILTA]], [[Further Education Development Agency|FEDA]] and [[Jisc]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = E-learning in Tertiary Education Where Do We Stand?|last = |first = |publisher = OECD Publishing|year = 2005|isbn = 9789264009219|location = |pages = 269|url = https://books.google.com/?id=lb92rJ--LiQC&amp;lpg=PA269&amp;dq=nln.ac.uk&amp;pg=PA269#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; This government-funded project resulted in three main developments:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://xtlearn.net/downloads/Paving_the_way.pdf|title = Paving the Way|date = 2004|accessdate = |website = |publisher =Becta |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

* The Joint Information Services Committee (JISC) that had been managing the [[JANET|Joint Academic Network]] (JANET) on behalf of UK Universities and Research Councils would now be part-funded by the Further Education Funding Council. Consequently, all UK Colleges of Further Education would be connected to the JANET network and benefit from the data sets and learning resources available through it.
* Support for the newly connected colleges would be provided by the JISC [[Regional Support Centres]] (RSC), set up by university and college partnerships to cover all FEFC funding areas. The RSCs' initial brief was to manage the connection of FE colleges to the JANET network, train local IT staff and provide high level technical support.
* A massive programme of learning materials development would be set up under the name of ''National Learning Network'' (NLN) to enable Further Education and the [[Adult and Community Learning]] (ACL) sectors to make best use of JANET and the enhanced ICT resources that these sectors enjoyed. A substantial body of work was developed by colleges, universities and commercial organisations and were made available to all qualifying parties. NLN has played a significant role in the adoption of [[ILT|Information and Learning Technology]] (ILT) by the post-16 education sectors in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

== NLN Materials ==

Four rounds of interactive learning materials were commissioned and authored under the NLN banner, covering a wide range of academic and vocational topics. The last body of work − Round 4, adding to the 800 hours of materials already available, was aimed at the Adult and Community Learning sector, covering four main topics: ''Family Learning'', ''[[English language learning and teaching|English for Speakers of Other Languages]]'', ''Learning to Learn'', and ''Making Learning Work for You''. These materials were made available from winter 2005. Round 1 and 2 of the materials were substantially updated during April to July 2006.

The materials are designed to be used in a variety of formats and delivery platforms, including within a [[Virtual Learning Environment]] (VLE). To facilitate this, all NLN materials have been packaged as Scorm [[learning object|Learning Object]]s, with [[Learning object metadata|metadata]]. Most of the LOs can be disaggregated into multiple [[SCORM|Shareable Content Objects]], and to varying degrees modified and repurposed by practitioners. In total, the NLN Materials consist of 2251 Learning Objects,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nln.ac.uk|title = NLN Materials Website|date = |accessdate = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 800 hours of learning, and have been used in around a third of UK FE institutions, as well as commercial and offender learning contexts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Chips with Everything (Offender Special)|url = http://archive.excellencegateway.org.uk/pdf/ChipsOffenderSpecialAugust2006.pdf|website = archive.excellencegateway.org.uk|accessdate = 2015-04-22|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130716010817/http%3A//archive.excellencegateway.org.uk/pdf/ChipsOffenderSpecialAugust2006.pdf|archivedate = 2013-07-16|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[http://xtensis.co.uk Xtensis ltd.] originally took a consultancy role in the project, gradually increasing their role to hosting the materials to practitioners in the ACL sector, then to all sectors,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://archive.excellencegateway.org.uk/pdf/chips_sep_07_issue19.pdf|title = Chips with Everything|date = September 2007|accessdate = |website = |publisher = NIACE|last = |first = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130721002139/http%3A//archive.excellencegateway.org.uk/pdf/chips_sep_07_issue19.pdf|archivedate = 2013-07-21|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; also introducing a download format that includes a navigational wrapper allowing the materials to be distributed and used on CD/DVD/intranet, while still being valid Scorm Content Packages.

Although most of the institutions involved in their creation have since been disbanded, the materials are still well used. Since 2015, authority of the NLN Materials service has passed to the [http://www.et-foundation.co.uk/ Education and Training Foundation], with the materials hosted within Xtensis' s[[Social bookmarking|ocial bookmarking]] site [http://XtLearn.net/nln XtLearn.net] which still allows direct access and independent download, but also enables mixing with other content sources from around the web into content collections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://xtlearn.net/Help/NLN|title = XtLearn Help - Content Sources - NLN|date = |accessdate = |website = XtLearn.net|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Network''''' is a real-time, [[two player]] [[business simulation game]] developed by [[David Mullich]] for the [[Apple II]]  in [[1980 in video gaming|1980]].

==Gameplay==
Two players play competitively against the computer, each taking the role of the programming chief for a major [[television network]].  Each side bids on new television shows to add to the season’s line-up, schedules them, monitors the weekly ratings, and then drops shows with poor ratings or reschedules them to recover from mistakes at the end of the thirteen-week season.  The side with the highest ratings is the winner.

==Reception==
Bruce Webster reviewed ''Network'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 31.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Webster|first=Bruce |date=September 1980 |title=Capsule Reviews|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Steve Jackson Games]]|issue=31|pages=28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Webster commented that "Unfortunately, I just could not get interested in the game. It moves slowly and requires (for intelligent play) that the players keep track of a lot of information that is not always easily accessible. One friend I played against quit out of boredom at one point, and I found myself yawning. There is a lack of tension, which means that personal interest must be the overriding factor in playing the game - and I'm just not that interested in network planning. If you are, then this is the game for you; otherwise, I'm afraid you'll just be disappointed."&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;

A '''reference scenario''' is an imagined situation where a [[library]] patron brings a question to a [[librarian]] and there is then a conversation, called in the field a [[reference interview]], where the librarian works to help the patron find what he or she wants.  These scenarios are used in training future librarians how to help patrons.  Basically, a scenario is as short as a couple of sentences, including a question and a situation that underlies that question.

A great deal of reference teaching puts students to researching the answers to made-up questions.  This focuses the student on learning about the reference sources at hand by using them to answer those questions.  Scenarios are something different.  They focus the student on the interaction with patrons.  In class practice sessions, one student can be the patron and the other the librarian, as long as the one practicing as the librarian doesn't know the whole scenario in advance.

Scenarios are valued because often the question asked is not the end of the patron's information hunt, but the start.  Patrons often start by voicing a question that they think the library can answer, rather than the question they are really seeking to answer.  Or they pose a question that the librarian doesn't understand.  Reference librarian skills are very much about mediating a gap between what the patron wants and what the library can provide.  This can involve the librarian making him or herself a partner in the patron's search, teaching them what the library really has to offer, or even just clarifying a confusing word: Does the patron want information about soaps to clean with or soaps as in soap operas?

'''ResearchChannel''' was an [[educational television]] network based at the [[University of Washington]] in [[Seattle]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]], and operated by a [[consortium]] of leading [[research]] and [[academia|academic]] institutions which contributed science-related programming to viewers in the United States and in other countries via [[satellite television|satellite]] and [[cable television]].

The University of Washington subsidized the operation of ResearchChannel since its founding, without direct compensation from the ResearchChannel consortium. This included providing all staff time and efforts, satellite uplink, and commodity internet bandwidth.

In March 2010, citing budget issues, the University of Washington informed the ResearchChannel Board that UW would end this subsidy; and cease programming and uplinking the channel and maintaining the website. The Research Channel board was unable to find a new sponsor and service provider. At midnight on August 31, 2010, ResearchChannel was shut down on [[Galaxy 18]], along with its broadcast on [[Dish Network]], [[Comcast]], and other terrestrial broadcasting services.

A '''school library''' (or a school library media center) is a [[library]] within a [[school]] where students, staff, and often, parents of a [[Public school (government funded)|public]] or [[private school]] have access to a variety of resources. The goal of the school library media center is to ensure that all members of the school community have equitable access "to books and reading, to information, and to information technology."&lt;ref&gt;The goals of the  school library program should support the mission and continuous improvement plan of the school district.[http://www.ala.org/ala/mgrps/divs/aasl/aaslproftools/learningstandards/standards.cfm Standards for the 21st Century Learner]&lt;/ref&gt; A school library media center "uses all types of media... is automated, and utilizes the Internet [as well as books] for information gathering."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, B. (2013). ''Administering the school library media center''. Westport, CT: Libraries Unlimited. (p.32).&lt;/ref&gt; School libraries are distinct from public libraries because they serve as "learner-oriented laboratories which support, extend, and individualize the school's curriculum... A school library serves as the center and coordinating agency for all material used in the school."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2013, p.32&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have demonstrated that school libraries have a positive impact on student achievement through the more than 60 studies that have been conducted in 19 U.S. states and one Canadian province. The major finding of these studies was that students with access to a well-supported school library media program with a qualified school library media specialist, scored higher on reading assessments regardless of their socio-economic statuses. In addition, a study conducted in Ohio&lt;ref&gt;Todd, R., Kuhlthau, C., &amp; OELMA. (2014). ''Student Learning through Ohio School Libraries : The Ohio Research Study''. Available online at: {{cite web |url=http://www.oelma.org/studentlearning/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040829171616/http://www.oelma.org/studentlearning/ |archivedate=2004-08-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; revealed that 99.4% of students surveyed believed that their school librarians and school library media programs helped them succeed in school. A report that reported similar conclusions was compiled by Michele Lonsdale in Australia in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Lonsdale, M. (2013). ''Impact of school libraries on student achievement: A review of the research''. Camberwell, Victoria, Australia: Australian Council for Educational Research. Available online at http://www.asla.org.au/site/DefaultSite/filesystem/documents/research.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of school libraries==
Library services to schools have evolved since the late 1800s from public or state library book wagons to informal classroom collections to what we know today.&lt;ref&gt;http://dorrstreet.org/502-spring-2018/NCES%202005%20fifty%20years%20of%20supporting%20311.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. The later part of the 19th century marked the beginning of the modern American library movement with the creation of the American Library Association (ALA) in 1876 by a group of librarians led by [[Melvil Dewey]]. At these beginning stages of development, the school libraries were primarily made up of small collections with the school librarian playing primarily a clerical role.

Dewey wrote that "a broad conception at the end of the century of the work of the schools is simply this, to teach the children to think accurately, with strength and with speed. If it is in the school that they get their start, then where do they get their education?"&lt;ref&gt;Dewey, M. (1920). What a library should be and what it can do. In A. E. Bostwick (Ed.). The library and society: Classics of American librarianship (pp. 75-78). New York: H.W. Wilson.&lt;/ref&gt;

1920 marked the first effort by the library and education communities to evaluate school libraries with the publication of the ''Certain Report'',&lt;ref&gt;Charles C. Certain Committee. (1986). ''Standard library organization and equipment for secondary schools of different sizes''. In Melvil M. Bowie (Comp.), ''Historic Documents of school libraries'' (pp.34-51). Littleton, CO: Hi Willow Research and Publishing. (Original work published 1920, Chicago: American Library Association)&lt;/ref&gt; which provided the first yardstick for evaluating school libraries.

By the 1940s, 40% of schools indicated the presence of classroom collections. Around 18% reported having centralized libraries. City schools reported 48% and rural schools reported 12%&lt;ref&gt;http://dorrstreet.org/502-spring-2018/NCES%202005%20fifty%20years%20of%20supporting%20311.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;. School libraries experienced another major push following the launch of Sputnik in 1957, which forced the United States to re-evaluate its priorities for math and science education. NDEA was a response to Sputnik and Title III of NDEA provided financial assistance for strengthening science, mathematics, and modern foreign language &lt;ref&gt;Michie, Joan S., et al. "Fifty Years of Supporting Children's Learning: A History of Public School Libraries and Federal Legislation from 1953 to 2000. NCES 2005-311." (March 1, 2005): ERIC, EBSCOhost (accessed March 1, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;. As a result, the 1960s were one of the greatest periods of growth and development for school libraries due to an increased flow of money and support from the private sector and public funding for education. Most notable during this time was the ''Knapp School Libraries Project''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Boardman |first=Edna |date=September–October 1994 |title=The Knapp School Libraries Project: The Best $1,130,000 Ever Spent on School Libraries. |journal=Book Report |volume=13 |issue=2 |page= |pages=17–19 |issn=0731-4388 |id=ERIC # EJ489785 }}''&lt;/ref&gt; which established model school library media centers across the country. Hundreds of new school libraries were expanded and renovated during this time.

Most recently, school libraries have been defined by two major guidelines documents: ''Information Power'' (1988)&lt;ref&gt;American Association of School Librarians &amp; Association for Educational Communications and Technology. (1998). ''Information power: Guidelines for school library media programs''. Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Information Power II'' (1998).&lt;ref&gt;American Association of School Librarians &amp; Association for Educational Communications and Technology. (1998). ''Information power: Building partnerships for learning''. Chicago: American Library Association.&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally important mission statement is the '''Unesco School library Manifesto''' [http://www.unesco.org/webworld/libraries/manifestos/school_manifesto.html], which states:
"The school library provides information and ideas that are fundamental to functioning successfully in today’s information and knowledge-based society. The school library equips students with life-long learning skills and develops the imagination, enabling them to live as responsible citizens" (para. 1).

==The purpose of the school library==
[[File:Library5.JPG|thumb|Inside a school library.]]
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''School library media centers in the 21st century can, and should be, hubs for increased student achievement and positive focused school reform''--Kathleen D. Smith &lt;ref&gt;Smith, K. (2002). "Building Student Learning Through School Libraries." Statement delivered at the ''White House Conference on School Libraries'', available from: {{cite web |url=http://www.imls.gov/news/events/whitehouse_3.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916210713/http://imls.gov/news/events/whitehouse_3.shtm |archivedate=2008-09-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The school library exists to provide a range of learning opportunities for both large and small groups as well as individuals with a focus on intellectual content, information literacy, and the learner.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2004&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to classroom visits with collaborating teachers, the school library also serves as a [[learning space]] for students to do independent work, use computers, equipment and research materials; to host special events such as author visits and book clubs; and for tutoring and testing.

School libraries function as a central location for all of the information available, and a school librarian functions as the literary map to the resources and materials found within the library.&lt;ref&gt;Felmley, D. (2010). How far should courses in normal schools and teachers’ colleges seek to acquaint all teachers with the ways of organizing and using school libraries?. Journal of Proceedings and Addresses of the Forty-Sixth Annual Meeting Held at Cleveland, Ohio, 1087-1095. Doi:10.1037/e597422010-207&lt;/ref&gt;

A school library functions as an opportunity for educators to work with librarians in support of a resource center for the students to be able to safely access the internet for both school work and interacting with each other. In her article, "Tag! You're It!": Playing on the Digital Playground, De las Casas discusses how today's youth is much more comfortable with technology than ever before, and believes that “We need to advocate for regulations and laws that support education of young people rather than simply limiting their access to the Web.”&lt;ref&gt;De las Casas, D. (2010). “Tag! you're it!”: playing on the digital playground. Knowledge Quest, 39(1), 80-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

The school library media center program is a collaborative venture in which school library media specialists, teachers, and administrators work together to provide opportunities for the social, cultural, and educational growth of students. Activities that are part of the school library media program can take place in the school library media center, the laboratory classroom, through the school, and via the school library's online resources.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In Australia school libraries have played a major role in the success of Reading Challenge programs initiated and funded by various State Governments.

The Premier's Reading Challenge in South Australia, launched by Premier Mike Rann (2002 to 2011) has one of the highest participation rates in the world for reading challenges. It has been embraced by more than 95% of public, private and religious schools.&lt;ref&gt;Center for National Policy, Washington DC, What States Can Do, May 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==The school library collection==
School libraries are similar to [[public library|public libraries]] in that they contain [[book]]s, [[film]]s, [[recorded sound]], [[periodical]]s, realia, and digital media.  These items are not only for the education, enjoyment, and entertainment of all members of the school community, but also to enhance and expand the school's [[curriculum]].

==Staffing of the school library==
In many schools, school libraries are staffed by [[librarian]]s, [[teacher-librarian]]s, or school library media specialists or media coordinators who hold a specific library science degree. In some jurisdictions, school librarians are required to have specific certification and/or a teaching certificate.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2004; Thomas, M. J.  &amp; Perritt, P.H. (2003, December 1). A Higher standard: Many states have recently revised their certification requirements for school librarians. ''School Library Journal''. Available online at http://www.schoollibraryjournal.com/article/CA339562.html?industryid=47056&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pn-lib-1959-shelf-1.jpg|thumb|right|The school librarian supplies children with educational books (Russia, 1959)]]

The school librarian performs four leadership main roles: teacher, instructional partner, information specialist, and program administrator. In the teacher role, the school librarian develops and implements curricula relating to [[information literacy]] and inquiry.  School librarians may read to children, assist them in selecting books, and assist with schoolwork. Some school librarians see classes on a "flexible schedule". A flexible schedule means that rather than having students come to the library for instruction at a fixed time every week, the classroom teacher schedules library time when library skills or materials are needed as part of the classroom learning experience.

In the instructional partner role, school librarians collaborate with classroom teachers to create independent learners by fostering students' [[research]], [[information literacy]], technology, and critical thinking skills.

As information specialists, school librarians develop a resource base for the school by using the curriculum and student interests to identify and obtain library materials, organize and maintain the library collection in order to promote independent reading and lifelong learning. Materials in the library collection can be located using an Online Public Access Catalog ([[OPAC]]). Often these catalogs are web-based from which students can gain access both at school and from home.

This role also encompasses many activities relating to technology including the integration of resources in a variety of formats: periodical databases; Web sites; digital video segments; podcasts; blog and wiki content; digital images; virtual classrooms, etc.  School librarians are often responsible for audio-visual equipment and are sometimes in charge of school [[computer]]s and [[computer network]]s.

Many school librarians also perform clerical duties. They handle the circulating and cataloging of materials, facilitate [[interlibrary loan]]s, shelve materials, perform inventory, etc.

'''Science Commons''' (SC) was a [[Creative Commons]] project for designing strategies and tools for faster, more efficient web-enabled [[scientific research]]. The organization's goals were to identify unnecessary barriers to research, craft policy guidelines and legal agreements to lower those barriers, and develop technology to make research data and materials easier to find and use. Its overarching goal was to speed the translation of data into discovery and thereby the value of research.

Science Commons was located at the [[MIT Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory]] in the [[Stata Center|Ray and Maria Stata Center]] at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts|Cambridge]], [[Massachusetts]].

==History==
[[Image:Science Commons-Stata-20050715.jpg|thumb|left|Science Commons office in 2005, MIT [[Stata Center]]]]

Creative Commons launched the Science Commons project in early 2005. The project sought to achieve for science what Creative Commons had achieved for the world of culture, art and educational material: to ease unnecessary legal and technical barriers to sharing, to promote innovation, and to provide easy, high quality tools that let individuals and organizations specify the terms under which they wished to share their material.

In 2009, Creative Commons terminated the Science Commons project.

==Projects==

===Biological Materials Transfer Project===

The Biological Materials Transfer Project, a [[Material transfer agreement]] (MTA), developed and deployed standard, modular contracts to lower the costs of transferring biological materials&lt;!--intentional link to DAB page--&gt; such as [[DNA]], [[cell lines]], [[model animals]] and more. The MTA project covered transfer between non-profit institutions, as well as offering transaction solutions to transfers between non-profit entities and for-profit institutions. It integrated existing standard agreements and new Science Commons contracts into a Web-deployed suite, with the goal of developing a transaction system along the lines of [[Amazon.com|Amazon]] or [[eBay]] by using the licensing as a discovery mechanism for materials. 

This metadata driven approach is based on the success of the Creative Commons licensing integration into search engines, further allowing for and facilitating the integration of materials licensing into the research literature itself and databases. The hope being that scientists would eventually be only one click away from accessing and/or ordering the materials referenced in the scholarly literature as they perform their research. Unfortunately, the MTA project's tools were not adopted by more than a very small percentage of the scientific community while Science Commons was active and, for all practical purposes, died out when the Science Commons project folded.

===Neurocommons===

Science Commons’ Neurocommons project set out to create an Open Source knowledge management platform for biological research. The platform combined open access materials (making up the knowledgebase) and open source software (in the form of an analytic platform). The software was still under development when the project ended.

===Scholar's Copyright Project===

The Scholar’s Copyright was developed with [[Scholarly Publishing and Academic Resources Coalition]] designed to lower the barriers to [[Open Access]] (OA) by reducing transaction costs and eliminating contract proliferation by offering tools and resources catering to both methods of achieving Open Access. [http://www.arl.org/sparc/author/completeonline.shtml The Scholar's Copyright Addendum] is still in use by SPARC

====Open Access Data Protocol====
The Science Commons Open Access Data Protocol was a method for ensuring that scientific databases can be legally integrated with one another. The protocol was not a license or legal tool, but instead a methodology and best practices document for creating such legal tools in the future, and marking data in the public domain for machine-assisted discovery.

'''Sober companion''', '''sober coach''', or '''recovery coach''' are titles all representing the same job in the field of addiction, providing one-on-one assistance to newly recovering individuals. The goal is to help the client maintain total abstinence or harm reduction from any addiction, and to establish healthy routines at home or after checking out of a residential treatment facility. Regulations do not exist for sober companions. A sober companion may be a part of a whole medical and/or a clinical team of professional(s), may be formally licensed as a mental health professional, or have well-respected experiential experience in the field and may work independently on their own.

==Service==
Protocols for a sober companion when working with a client, their family, and/or friends are established immediately. These may include a psychotherapeutic approach, 12-step or non-12 step plan, other outside support groups, help establishing nutrition and fitness daily, medication therapy, or holistic practices. 
The primary duty of a sober coach is to ensure the recovering individual does not relapse. They may be hired to provide [[24/7|round the clock]] care, be on-call, or to accompany the recovering addict during certain activities.

A companion acts as an advocate for the newly recovering person and provides new ways for the client to act in their own living environment. A sober companion either completely removes the addict from his own environment of hidden stashes, or may search for hidden drugs in that environment, in an effort to prevent a relapse.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"&gt;Mireya Navarro, "[https://www.nytimes.com/2007/04/15/fashion/15sober.html?_r=1&amp;ex=1190260800&amp;en=9a1018e016edb1ad&amp;ei=5070&amp;oref=slogin A Companion to Protect Addicts From Themselves]", ''[[New York Times]]'', April 17, 2007.  Retrieved  October 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ChicagoTrib"&gt;Colleen Mastony, "[http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-mxa0918tempocoversobersep18,0,1352635,full.story What's a 'sober companion'?]", ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' September 18, 2007. Retrieved October 13, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; 

An engagement with a sober companion usually lasts 30 days or longer. The time required to effect a meaningful change varies depending upon the client, co-occurring disorders, and life at home. Ethically, a companion's presence in the client's life will titrate down as the client's ability to connect to newly defined healthy behaviors with family, work, and legal issues without relapse is proven. Some recovery coaches stay with their clients for many months, and some offer only transportation services (for instance, to and from treatment facilities or sober living homes). The sober companion's duties vary from case to case, from simply ensuring the client remains abstinent, to establishing and ushering a specific plan of recovered resources and relationships into their home and community.

Sober companions are sometimes hired in cases where an actor or musician will not attend treatment, but must remain abstinent to complete a film or recording project.&lt;ref name=ParkMiell/&gt;&lt;ref name=Protect/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brittany/&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen Wilson"/&gt; They are also depicted by some media outlets as "adult babysitters". Doctors may also refer to sober companions as "advocates" for actors, musicians, and other celebrities.&lt;ref name=Protect/&gt;

==Controversies==
There has been controversy among sober companions over the use of drug replacement therapy and prescription drugs to ease withdrawal, cravings or other side effects of long-term narcotic and alcohol use.  Sober companions are sometimes used as a replacement for residential addiction treatment or other forms of [[drug rehabilitation]]. [[Doug Caine]], founder of Sober Champion, and Dr. Ronald J. Hunsicker, FACATA, National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers' president and chief executive officer, introduced an alternative perspective in mental health and addiction treatment programs. It was recommend that a combined approach be taken, particularly for people at high risk of relapse. Hunsicker's speech on “The Challenges for Implementing Evidence-Based Practices in Addiction Treatment"&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.openminds.com/market-intelligence/intelligence-updates/peibhihunsicker.htm The Challenges for Implementing Evidence-Based Practices in Addiction Treatment]". Speech by Dr. Ronald J. Hunsicker, FACATA, National Association of Addiction Treatment Providers president and chief executive officer. Accessed Oct 3, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; suggested that companions can help a patient successfully transition from a heavily structured, secure environment into the world where he previously failed to stay sober.&lt;ref name="NYTimes"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Owen Wilson"/&gt; Other experts are skeptical of the companion approach and its dependence on a single individual.&lt;ref name="Owen Wilson"/&gt;

===Certification===
There is currently no formal sober companion oversight and accountability, and no required formal training or qualification.

==Pop culture==
The television series ''[[Elementary (TV series)|Elementary]]'' depicts [[Joan Watson|Watson]] as a female sober companion to a modern-day [[Sherlock Holmes]].

The American '''Species Survival Plan''' or '''SSP''' program was developed in 1981 by the (American) [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums]] to help ensure the survival of selected species in [[zoo]]s and [[aquarium]]s,&lt;ref name=AZA&gt;{{cite web | author = Association of Zoos and Aquariums | title = Species Survival Plan Program - SSP Fact Sheet | work = Association of Zoos and Aquariums website | publisher = Association of Zoos and Aquariums | year = 2007 | url = http://www.aza.org/ConScience/ConScienceSSPFact/ | accessdate = 2007-09-13 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070926222734/http://www.aza.org/ConScience/ConScienceSSPFact/ | archivedate = 2007-09-26 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; most of which are threatened or [[endangered species|endangered]] in the wild.

==SSP Program==
SSP programs focus on animals that are in danger of [[extinction]] in the wild, when zoo conservationists believe captive breeding programs may be their only chance to survive.&lt;ref name=CFZ&gt;[http://www.centralfloridazoo.org/speciessurvivalplan "Species Survival Plans help preserve wildlife"] on the Central Florida Zoo website.&lt;/ref&gt;  These programs also help maintain healthy and [[genetic diversity|genetically diverse]] animal populations within the [[zoo]] community.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/vets/ssp.html "Species Survival Plan"] on PBS NOVA Online.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]] accredited zoos and [[Association of Zoos and Aquariums|AZA]] conservation partners that are involved in SSP programs engage in cooperative population management and conservation efforts that include research, public education, [[reintroduction]], and ''in situ'' or field conservation projects.&lt;ref name=AZA/&gt; There are currently 172 species covered by 116 SSP programs in North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aza.org/zoo-aquarium-statistics/ AZA Conservation Program Statistics] on the AZA website.&lt;/ref&gt;

==SSP Master Plan==
An SSP Master Plan is a document produced by the SSP coordinator (generally a zoo professional under the guidance of an elected management committee)&lt;ref name=AZA/&gt; for a certain species.  This document sets breeding goals and other management recommendations to achieve the maximum [[genetic diversity]] and demographic stability for a species, given transfer and space constraints.&lt;ref name=CFZ/&gt;

The Dragonfly is designed for: [[aerial photography]], interactive [[Video game|gaming]], autonomous [[patrolling]] for security and surveillance, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techject.com "TechJect Inc."]&lt;/ref&gt; It was to be manufactured by TechJect, but as of November 2015 the company did not expect to do so.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.indiegogo.com/projects/robot-dragonfly-micro-aerial-vehicle#/updates&lt;/ref&gt;

Development of the [[hobbyist]] version was funded via an [[Indiegogo]] campaign which ended on December 31, 2012 and raised $1.14 million.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The initial deliveries were estimated to occur in July 2013 but prototypes were still being developed up until 2017. No actual units have been sent to backers.

== Design ==
The unit was envisioned  as a miniaturized four-winged ornithopter which uses a flight model based on that of a [[dragonfly]].&lt;ref&gt;https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/07/another-1-million-crowdfunded-gadget-company-collapses/&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first palm sized miniaturized ornithopter to be prototyped to exhibit powerful actuation at small sizes, though other larger versions have been developed. (e.g., the [[DelFly]] &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delfly.nl/?site=DIII&amp;menu=&amp;lang=nl "Delfly Ornithopter"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://spectrum.ieee.org/automaton/robotics/robotics-software/scoop_robot_dragonfly_is_smaller_than_real_insect_transmits_camera_images "Delfly Article"]&lt;/ref&gt;), the Dragonfly was the first to make use of multiple models, each customizable with multiple options, such as wifi connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gizmag.com/techject-dragonfly-microuav/24900/ "Gizmag Article"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.treehugger.com/gadgets/cia-once-considered-amazingly-realistic-looking-dragonfly-drone.html "CIA Dragonfly Drone"]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dragonfly UAV built off the research done at [[Georgia Institute of Technology]]'s Intelligent Control Systems Laboratory.  That research resulted in Patent 9,290,268,&lt;ref&gt;[http://patft.uspto.gov/netacgi/nph-Parser?Sect1=PTO1&amp;Sect2=HITOFF&amp;d=PALL&amp;p=1&amp;u=%2Fnetahtml%2FPTO%2Fsrchnum.htm&amp;r=1&amp;f=G&amp;l=50&amp;s1=9290268.PN.&amp;OS=PN/9290268&amp;RS=PN/9290268 "Dragonfly Patent"]&lt;/ref&gt; filed in 2011 and granted in March 2016.  The TectJect company, which spun off from the Georgia Tech Research Corporation, was to develop this technology into a reliable consumer product.  After several major design changes and deviations from the original patent, no reliable solution was found.

===Technical specifications===
The Dragonfly may be equipped with one of three different electronics packages.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}  These could include the Marc-Basic, Marc-2, and Marc-3.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} Each is more capable than the preceding model, culminating in the Marc-3, which is equipped with approximately twenty different sensors.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}  In addition, all models are planned to be built to have camera capability, including [[stereoscopic vision]] through dual cameras (available with the Marc-3).{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}  HD vision is optional.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}  Power is planned to be provided from a single-cell [[Lithium polymer battery|Li-Po battery]] rated at 250mAh.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}} The actuator system for the wings could be based on either magnetic solenoidal actuators (Alpha model - retired for now) or a [[Continuously Variable Transmission]] (CVT) for the Delta, Gamma, and Omega models.{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}  With a final goal weight of ~25g and a length of 6", the micro UAV is expected to hover for ~8–10 minutes, with a hybrid flight time (hovering and fixed-wing gliding) of ~25–30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2015}}[http://www.indiegogo.com/robotdragonfly?c=home "TechJect Dragonfly Indiegogo page"] {{dead link|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, these specifications were announced at the beginning of the [[crowdfunding]] campaign and do not reflect any actual hardware.

== Cameras and Sensors ==
The Dragonfly is reported to have the ability to be equipped with up to twenty environmental sensors (including GPS and cameras), dependent on electronics package.  At minimum, the unit is reported to come equipped with a 3-axis [[accelerometer]] and a 3-axis [[gyroscope]] as is required for controlled flight through [[Inertial navigation system|inertial guidance]].  At most, the unit is currently{{When|date=November 2015}} envisioned to equip approximately 20 sensors, including 3-axis accelerometers, 3-axis gyroscopes, 3-axis [[magnetometer]]s, an ambient light sensor, an ambient humidity sensor, and a differential/absolute pressure sensor.  Further sensor packages may become available in the future.{when}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techject.com/images/shared/TechJect-Electronics.pdf "Dragonfly Electronics Detail"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Production delays ==
On the third anniversary of the IndieGoGo campaign, TechJect released an update to backers stating that the company "in no position to complete the Dragonfly project in our current condition without a helping hand (partners, additional funding or community support)."&lt;ref name=alois&gt;Alois, J.D. "[http://www.crowdfundinsider.com/2015/11/77361-when-a-crowdfunded-project-runs-out-of-money/ When a Crowdfunded Project Runs Out of Money]", Crowdfund Insider, November 16, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; TechJect has claimed that the project's failure was the result of a delay in the release of funding by PayPal and IndieGoGo.&lt;ref name=burns&gt;Burns, Matt. "[https://techcrunch.com/2015/11/07/another-1-million-crowdfunded-gadget-company-collapses/ Another $1 Million Crowdfunded Gadget Company Collapses]", TechCrunch, November 7, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the design was much less mature than what was stated during the crowdfunding campaign, and significant time and money was spent finalizing the mechanical design and selecting appropriate materials. The team apologized to backers for what it termed "our dismal approach to the finish line".&lt;ref name=sadler&gt;Sadler, Denham. "[http://www.startupsmart.com.au/technology/buzz-kill-one-of-the-first-tech-crowdfunding-successes-is-in-big-trouble-with-no-robot-dragonfly/2015110915893.html Buzz kill: One of the first tech crowdfunding successes is in big trouble with no robot dragonfly]", Startup Smart, November 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

''Crowdfund Insider'' has described the state of the project as "road kill" and "dead in the water".&lt;ref name=alois /&gt; [[TechCrunch]] espoused the view that TechJect's pitch "always seemed a bit far-fetched", and cited it as "the latest example of how consumers need to be more careful with crowdfunding".&lt;ref name=burns /&gt; [[Veckans Affärer]] described the Dragonfly as "too good to be true", and described it and [[The Buccaneer (3D printer)|Pirate3D's Buccaneer 3D printer]] as part of a trend of crowdfunding projects that had not delivered on their promises.&lt;ref name=veckans_affarer&gt;"[http://www.va.se/nyheter/2015/11/09/prylen-var-for-bra-for-att-vara-sann---crowdfundade-bolaget-kollapsar/ Prylen var för bra för att vara sann - crowdfundade bolaget kollapsar]" (Swedish), Veckans Affärer, November 9, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Near Bibbsworth Hall Farm - geograph.org.uk - 160357.jpg|thumb|Farmland near [[Bibbsworth Hall]], [[Kimpton, Hertfordshire|Kimpton]], [[Hertfordshire]]]]
'''''The Treatise''''' (original title ''Le Tretiz'') is an [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]] poem written in the mid-13th century by [[Walter of Bibbesworth]], addressed to [[Dionisie de Munchensi]], with the aim of helping her to teach her children French, the language of the Norman aristocracy. It was a popular text in medieval England, and is a very early example of a book intended for reading to children.

How the author and the addressee knew one another is unknown, though their families both farmed land within reach of [[Hertford]] Fair, held annually from 1226.&lt;ref&gt;Samantha Letters, ''Gazetteer of Markets and Fairs in England and Wales to 1516'' (2005) "[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40419 Hertfordshire]"&lt;/ref&gt; In some manuscripts the text opens with a preface stating that the work is written for ''Madame Dyonise de Mountechensi''. In others the poem is preceded by a letter of dedication, addressed simply ''Chere suer'' ("Dear sister"), a phrase that expresses equality in their social relationship and some friendship between them. The letter continues: "You have asked me to put in writing for your children a phrase book to teach them French."&lt;ref&gt;Dalby (2012) pp. 9–11&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dionisie's name had been "de Anesty" until her marriage to [[Warin de Munchensi]] in 1234. From that date she had two young stepchildren, John and [[Joan de Munchensi]] (who were grandchildren of [[William Marshal]]) and she soon bore one child of her own, [[William de Munchensi|William]].&lt;ref&gt;Ridgeway (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; The book was perhaps written for Dionisie's marriage or soon after,&lt;ref&gt;As argued by Dalby (2012) p. 15; "not later than 1250" according to Baugh and Cable (1993) p. 134; "between 1240 and 1250" according to Tony Hunt, "Bibbesworth, Walter of" in ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' (2004); "prior to 1270 and most likely before 1254" according to Kennedy (2003) p. 131; "second half of the thirteenth century" in a "scholarly consensus" claimed by Rothwell (1990); "c. 1285" according to Hieatt (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; and "John, William and Joan probably learned their French" from this book.&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy (2003) p. 131&lt;/ref&gt; Dionisie "lacked the requisite fluency" to make her children confident French-speakers&lt;ref&gt;Glyn Burgess in ''[[The Times Literary Supplement]]'' (5 October 2012) pp. 26–27; Rothwell (1968) p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; but a knowledge of the language would be essential in the future careers of William, a turbulent politician, and especially Joan: she unexpectedly gained a "very rich inheritance" in 1247, and King [[Henry III of England|Henry III]] chose her in the same year to marry his half-brother [[William of Valence]].&lt;ref&gt; Joan became an heiress owing to the deaths of all five Marshal uncles and lastly (in early 1247) her brother John. Dalby (2012) pp. 12–13; Richard Vaughan, transl., ''The Illustrated Chronicles of Matthew Paris'' (Stroud: Sutton, 1993) p. 29; Baugh (1959) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;

The author's original intention was probably that the de Munchensi children would be looking at the text while Dionisie read it aloud.&lt;ref&gt;Michael T. Clanchy, ''From Memory to Written Record'' (London: Arnold, 1979) p. 225&lt;/ref&gt; The poem, written in rhyming lines of irregular length (usually 7 or 8 syllables), presents a series of topics beginning with birth and childhood, listing plants, animals and animal cries, continuing through household tasks and farm work, including fishing, baking, brewing, house-building, ploughing and carting,&lt;ref&gt;Jambeck (2005) pp. 161–163 and ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; and ending with a "great feast".&lt;ref&gt;The feast is the subject of Hieatt (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; An emphasis on learning to manage a household and an estate has been noted.&lt;ref&gt;Rothwell (1982) p. 282; Kennedy (2003) p. 133&lt;/ref&gt; The list of [[collective noun]]s for animals and the list of animal cries are the earliest sources for this special vocabulary in any European vernacular.&lt;ref&gt;Sayers (2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

In all manuscripts many significant words in the French text are accompanied by English translations, written between the lines or in the margins. These glosses help to show that the book is intended for children whose first language is English and whose second language is to be French.&lt;ref&gt;Owen (1929) p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; A particular aim, according to the text, was that they should "be better taught in speech and not made fun of by others".&lt;ref&gt;Lines 27–28; Jambeck (2005) pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Treatise'' marks a turning point in the linguistic history of medieval England, showing that by its date English "had already become the mother tongue of the children of the Anglo-Norman nobility, and that they learnt it before they were taught French."&lt;ref&gt;Wright (1857)&lt;/ref&gt; It is among the very earliest books in any language explicitly intended "for children to hear and read".&lt;ref&gt;Dalby (2012) [https://prospectbooks.co.uk/samples/WalterofBibbesworth.pdf p. 7]&lt;/ref&gt; It remained a popular text for two centuries, as shown both by the number of manuscripts in which it survives independently,&lt;ref&gt;Baugh and Cable (1993) p. 134&lt;/ref&gt; and by its re-use as part of the 14th-century collection ''[[Femina Nova]]'', compiled for older students at a period when few English children learned French in their early years.&lt;ref&gt;Kristol (1990); Rothwell (1968); W. Rothwell, "The Teaching and Learning of French in Later Medieval England" in ''Zeitschrift für französische Sprache und Literatur'' vol. 111 (2001) pp. 1–18&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''University of the Philippines Los Baños''' (also referred to as '''UPLB''', '''UP Los Baños''', or colloquially, '''Elbi''') is a [[State university and college (Philippines)|public]] [[research institute|research]] [[university]] located in the towns of [[Los Baños, Laguna|Los Baños]] and [[Bay, Laguna|Bay]] in the province of [[Laguna province|Laguna]], some 64 kilometers southeast of [[Manila]]. It traces its roots to the [[University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Agriculture|UP College of Agriculture]] (UPCA), which was founded in 1909 by the [[History of the Philippines#Insular Government (1901–1935)|American colonial government]] to promote agricultural education and research in the [[Philippines]]. American botanist [[Edwin Copeland]] served as its first dean. UPLB was formally established in 1972 following the union of UPCA with four other Los Baños and [[Diliman]]-based [[University of the Philippines]] (UP) units.

The university has played an influential role in Asian agriculture and biotechnology due to its pioneering efforts in plant breeding and [[bioengineering]], particularly in the development of high-yielding and pest-resistant crops. In recognition of its work, it was awarded the [[Ramon Magsaysay Award]] for International Understanding in 1977. Nine research centers are recognized as Centers of Excellence by presidential decree.&lt;ref name="chanrobles"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.chanrobles.com/executiveorders/1983/executiveorderno889-1983.html

UPLB was originally established as the [[University of the Philippines College of Agriculture]] (UPCA) on 6 March 1909, by the UP [[board of regents]]. Edwin Copeland, an [[United States|American]] botanist and [[Thomasite]] from the [[Philippine Normal College]] in Manila, served as its first dean.&lt;ref name='UPLB History'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.uplb.edu.ph/about/uplb-history |title=UPLB History |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños |accessdate=19 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090720100734/http://www.old.uplb.edu.ph/about/uplb-history |archivedate=20 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="100 Years 0"/&gt; Classes began in June 1909 with five professors, and 12 students initially enrolled in the program.&lt;ref name = "Ramon magsaysay award"/&gt; The [[University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Forestry and Natural Resources|Forestry School]] was established a year later.&lt;ref name="UPLB pride"/&gt;

During the [[Japanese occupation of the Philippines]], UPCA was closed and the campus converted into an [[internment camp]] for allied nationals and a headquarters of the Japanese army.&lt;ref name = "UPLB History"/&gt; For three years, the college was home to more than 2,000 civilians, mostly Americans, that were captured by the [[Japanese Imperial Army|Japanese]]. In 1945, as part of the liberation of the Philippines, the [[US Army]] sent 130 [[11th Airborne Division (United States)|11th Airborne Division paratroopers]] to Los Baños to rescue the internees.&lt;ref name='The Los Banos Prison Camp Raid – The Philippines 1945'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ospreypublishing.com/store/The-Los-Banos-Prison-Camp-Raid--–-The-Philippines-1945_9781849080750 | title = The Los Banos Prison Camp Raid – The Philippines 1945 | publisher = Osprey Publishing | accessdate = 20 March 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101105012333/http://www.ospreypublishing.com/store/The-Los-Banos-Prison-Camp-Raid--%E2%80%93-The-Philippines-1945_9781849080750/ | archive-date = 5 November 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Only four paratroopers and two [[Filipino people|Filipino]] guerrillas were killed in the raid. However, Japanese reinforcements arrived two days later, destroying UPCA facilities&lt;ref name = "UPLB History"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ramon magsaysay award"/&gt; and killing some 1,500 Filipino civilians in Los Baños soon afterwards.&lt;ref name = 'Remember Los Banos'&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.rememberlosbanos1945.com/ | title = Remember Los Baños 1945 | publisher = Los Baños Liberation Memorial Scholarship Foundation | accessdate = 20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= 'Liberating Los Banos'&gt;{{cite journal|author = Sam McGowan | date = 19 August 1999| url = http://www.historynet.com/world-war-ii-liberating-los-banos-internment-camp.htm | title = World War II: Liberating Los Baños | journal = World War II | accessdate = 20 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPCA became the first unit of the University of the Philippines to open after the war, with Leopoldo Uichangco as dean. However, only 125 (16 percent) of the original students enrolled. It was even worse for the School of Forestry, which only had nine students. Likewise, only 38 professors returned to teach. UPCA used its [[Philippine Peso|₱]]470,546 (US$10,800)&lt;ref name='conversion'&gt;Approximate conversion value as of May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; share in the Philippine-US War Damage Funds (released in 1947) for reconstruction.&lt;ref name = '100 Years'&gt;{{cite book | pages = 75–122 | chapter = Chs. 6–8 | year = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños Alumni Association | location = Los Baños, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A. Bernardo |title = Centennial Panorama: Pictorial History of UPLB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further financial endowments from the [[United States Agency for International Development]] (USAID) and the Mutual Security Agency (MSA) allowed the construction of new facilities, while scholarship grants, mainly from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] and the [[International Cooperation Administration]], helped fund training of UPCA faculty. From 1947 to 1958, a total of 146 faculty members had been granted MS and PhD scholarships in US universities.&lt;ref name = "100 Years"/&gt;

[[Dioscoro Umali]] became UPCA dean in 1959.

In 1972, UPCA requested [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]] to allow the college to secede from the University of the Philippines due to the alleged withholding of its budget and the disapproval of curricular proposals.&lt;ref name = "100 Years 3"/&gt; However, [[President of the University of the Philippines|UP President]] [[Salvador P. Lopez]] strongly opposed the idea. A survey found that there was very little support for complete independence at UPCA. As a compromise, Lopez proposed the transformation of UP into a system of autonomous constituent universities. Finally, on 20 November 1972, [[List of Philippine laws|Presidential Decree]] No. 58 was signed, establishing UPLB as UP's first autonomous campus, with UPCA, College of Forestry, Agricultural Credit and Cooperatives Institute, Dairy Training and Research Institute, and the Diliman-based Agrarian Reform Institute as its first academic units.&lt;ref name = "100 Years 3"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "UPLB History"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "Ramon magsaysay award"/&gt;&lt;ref name = 'PD 58'&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/presdecs/pd1972/pd_58_1972.html | title = Presidential Decree No. 58 | publisher = Arellano Law Foundation | author = Ferdinand E.

In 2010 Chancellor Luis Rey Velasco's administration oversaw the implementation of a policy allowing for larger lecture classes to improve the "absorptive capacity" of the university by more than 500 students and to give them better access to some of the more seasoned professors.&lt;ref name='A Statement on the Large Class Size Project'&gt;{{cite book | url = http://uplb.edu.ph/email_attachments/2010-02-25_LargeClassStatement.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723073420/http://uplb.edu.ph/email_attachments/2010-02-25_LargeClassStatement.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 23 July 2011 | title = A Statement on the Large Class Size Project | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños| accessdate = 19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It increased the class size of 25 to 40 students to a much larger 120 to 175 for general education and foundation courses.

As part of the University of the Philippines System, UPLB is governed by the 11-person UP Board of Regents, which is jointly chaired by the head of the [[Commission on Higher Education (Philippines)|Commission on Higher Education]] and the UP president.&lt;ref name='pascual'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/content.php?r=3&amp;c=3 |title=Alfredo Pascual: "The 20th UP President" |publisher=University of the Philippines |accessdate=11 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110521000656/http://up.edu.ph/content.php?r=3&amp;c=3 |archivedate=21 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RA 9500"/&gt;

The Board of Regents has the authority to approve the institution, merger, and abolition of degree programs as recommended by the UP president. It also has the power to confer degrees. The UP president, who is appointed by the Board of Regents, is the university's chief executive officer and the head of the faculty.&lt;ref name="RA 9500"/&gt;

UPLB is administered by a chancellor who is elected by the UP Board of Regents to a three-year term. The chancellor may only serve for up to two terms.&lt;ref name="100 Years 5"/&gt;&lt;ref name='RA 9500'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.up.edu.ph/pdf2/RA_9500.pdf |title=An Act to Strengthen the University of the Philippines as the National University |date=5 May 2008 |publisher=Office of the President of the Philippines |author=Congress of the Philippines |accessdate=28 March 2011 |location=Manila |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110518015755/http://www.up.edu.ph/pdf2/RA_9500.pdf |archivedate=18 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Under him are five vice-chancellors specializing in administration, community affairs, instruction, planning and development, and research and extension.&lt;ref name='About UPLB'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/about?start=1 |title=About UPLB – University Officials |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños |accessdate=28 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201130420/http://uplb.edu.ph/index.php/about?start=1 |archivedate=1 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current chancellor is Fernando C. Sanchez, the ninth to hold the office. He assumed the post on 28 October 2014.

UPLB, through the [[UP System]], is a member of the [[Association of Pacific Rim Universities]], a consortium of leading research universities in the Asia-Pacific region.&lt;ref name='APRU'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apru.org/members/uphilippines.htm |publisher=Association of Pacific Rim Universities |title=University of the Philippines |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110930222116/http://www.apru.org/members/uphilippines.htm |archivedate=30 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===

UPLB's endowment totaled some ₱4&amp;nbsp;billion (US$90&amp;nbsp;million) in 2010, broken down into cash reserves (₱1.7&amp;nbsp;billion/US$40&amp;nbsp;million), investments (₱745&amp;nbsp;million/US$17&amp;nbsp;million) and national government subsidy (₱1.19&amp;nbsp;billion/US$30&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name='COA'&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.coa.gov.ph/Audit/AAR.htm |title=Consolidated Annual Audit Report on the University of the Philippines |year=2010 |accessdate=25 May 2012 |author=Commission on Audit |publisher=Commission on Audit |location=Quezon City |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421130257/http://www.coa.gov.ph/Audit/AAR.htm |archivedate=21 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This amount includes research funding from other sources, which was valued at ₱233&amp;nbsp;million (US$5.37&amp;nbsp;million)&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; in 2010. The biggest source was Philippine government agencies, at ₱136&amp;nbsp;million (US$3.13&amp;nbsp;million),&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; with the PCASTRD-DOST as the largest contributor. This represents a 32 percent decrease from the previous year. Meanwhile, contributions from international and local private agencies increased 101 percent and 71 percent respectively. In all, outside sources contributed some ₱98&amp;nbsp;million (US$2.26&amp;nbsp;million).&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt;&lt;ref name='OVCRE 2010'&gt;{{cite book| url = http://ovcre.uplb.edu.ph/images/docs/ovcre_2010highlights.pdf | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños Office of the Vice-Chancellor for Research and Extension | title = 2010 Highlights of Accomplishments | date = March 2010 | accessdate = 29 March 2011}}{{Dead link|date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To prepare for its centennial year, UPLB launched several Centennial Fund campaigns, the largest being the Centennial Building Fund, which aims to raise ₱2&amp;nbsp;billion (US$46.1&amp;nbsp;million)&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; for the "construction, repair and maintenance of academic buildings and dormitories". Other Centennial Funds include the Centennial Celebration Fund and the Centennial Artists Endowment fund.&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt;&lt;ref name='Centennial'&gt;{{cite news|url=http://old.uplb.edu.ph/news/uplb-news/uplb-link/801 |author=JVG Baril |title= Centennial Fund Campaign updates |newspaper=University of the Philippines Los Baños Link |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños |date=June 2007 |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823155828/http://old.uplb.edu.ph/news/uplb-news/uplb-link/801 |archivedate=23 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Student government===

The University Student Council (USC) is the "highest governing body of all UPLB students." Together with college [[student council]]s (CSCs), it assembles as the Student Legislative Chamber and acts as the highest policy-making body of the USC. The USC is composed of a chairperson, vice-chairperson, 10 councilors, a representative for each college/school with less than 500 students, and an additional college representative for every 500 students in excess of the first 500. Members are given one-year terms. CSCs have a similar structure, but with a different number of councilors based on the student population.&lt;ref name='Basic Student Information'&gt;{{cite web|title=Basic Student Information |url=http://old.uplb.edu.ph/osa/253 |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños |accessdate=29 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823155913/http://old.uplb.edu.ph/osa/253 |archivedate=23 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='USC'&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.oocities.org/usc_uplb/constitution.html | author= University Student Council | title = USC Constitution | accessdate=29 March 2011 | date=12 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Student Disciplinary Tribunal (SDT) is responsible for sanctioning erring students. Common offenses include student misconduct and fraternity rumbles. The SDT is composed of a chairperson, two appointees of the chancellor, a student juror, and a parent juror.&lt;ref name="Basic Student Information"/&gt;

===Admission and graduation===
{{see also|University of the Philippines College Admission Test|Academic grading in the Philippines#Grade point scale (5.00 - 1.00)|l2=Academic grading in the Philippines}}

UPLB admits more than 2,500 students and produces about 1,800 graduates every year.&lt;ref name="A Statement on the Large Class Size Project"/&gt;&lt;ref name="UPLB students, teachers stage protests vs large class policy"/&gt; Undergraduate admission is determined by the [[University of the Philippines College Admission Test]] (UPCAT). Examinees that select UPLB as their preferred campus and garner a University Predicted Grade (UPG) within the ''standard'' cut-off are automatically eligible for admission. Those who do not automatically qualify may file an appeal for reconsideration if their UPG is within the ''actual'' cut-off, though the appeal process does not guarantee admission.&lt;ref name='Qualifying'&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.upcatreview.com/tale-of-two-applicants | title = HOW THE EEAS WORKS: A Tale of Two Applicants | year = 2010 | accessdate= 21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Waitlist'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/students-and-alumni/386-2011-2012-uplb-wait-list-criteria |title=UPLB Wait List Criteria 1st SEM AY 2011–2012 |date=22 February 2011 |accessdate=21 June 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110614094519/http://www.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/students-and-alumni/386-2011-2012-uplb-wait-list-criteria |archivedate=14 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The cut-off scores may be adjusted according to a variety of factors. In 2010, UPLB had a ''standard'' UPG cut-off of 2.42 while the ''actual'' cut-off was 2.8 (this ''actual'' cut-off was retained in 2011). But in 2014–2015 UPCAT, according to the Office of the University Registrar, UPLB had a standard cut off score of 2.3.&lt;ref name='Waitlist Procedure'&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.upcatreview.com/uplb-upmin-waitlist-procedure | title = UP Waitlist Procedure | date = 28 February 2011 | accessdate= 21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Review'&gt;{{cite web|url = http://academic-clinic.com/2010/06/u-p-upg-cut-off-scores-and-reconsideration/ | title = U.P.

High school freshman admission, on the other hand, is determined by the eight-hour-long UPRHS Entrance Examination. Only the top 125 examinees are admitted.&lt;ref name='UPRHS'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/newsletters/doc_download/81-general-information-2010 |title=What is the UPRHS Entrance Examination? |publisher=University of the Philippines Rural High School Office of Admissions and Registration |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101203055141/http://uplb.edu.ph/index.php/newsletters/doc_download/81-general-information-2010 |archivedate=3 December 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sophomore transferees take the two-day UPRHS Validation Examination, and are admitted depending on the available slots.&lt;ref name='Validation'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uprhs.com/uprhs%20website%20working%20folder/03_admissions/admission_validation.html |title=General Information of Validation Examination |publisher=University of the Philippines Rural High School |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110405141214/http://www.uprhs.com/uprhs%20website%20working%20folder/03_admissions/admission_validation.html |archivedate=5 April 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

UPLB has a substantial no-show rate, with 42 percent of qualifiers opting not to enroll. The figures are worse for BS Forestry and [[Doctor of Veterinary Medicine]] programs, with no-show rates of 65 percent and 62 percent, respectively. Other programs with poor enrollment numbers include [[Bachelor of Science in Agriculture|BS Agriculture]], BS [[Agricultural engineering]], and BS [[Agricultural chemistry]].&lt;ref name="ToFI"/&gt;

Normally, a student who completes the program may graduate with [[Latin honors|honors]] if his general weighted average (GWA) is 1.75 or above. The title ''summa cum laude'' is awarded to graduates who obtain a GWA of 1.20 or above, ''magna cum laude'' to graduates with a GWA of 1.45 to 1.20, and ''cum laude'' to graduates with a GWA of between 1.75 and 1.45.&lt;ref name='Graduation'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.uplb.edu.ph/webmaster/449 |title=Graduation with Honors |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110513083257/http://old.uplb.edu.ph/webmaster/449 |archivedate=13 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2011 there have been 30 ''summa cum laude''s who have graduated from UPLB.&lt;ref name='CEM newsletter summa'&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.uplb.edu.ph/attachments/415_Grad%20Issue-CEMNewsletter%20April%202011%20(pdf).pdf | title = Message to the Members of Class 2011 | author = Reynaldo L.

The base tuition fee per unit in UPLB is ₱1,000 (US$23).&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; As with all UP constituents, UPLB implements the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP). Under the program, students with annual family incomes between ₱1,000,000 (US$23,000) and ₱500,000 (US$11,500)&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; are charged the base tuition fee, while those with annual family incomes above ₱1,000,000 are charged ₱1,500 (US$35) per unit.&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; Students with annual family incomes between ₱500,000 and ₱135,000 (US$3,110) are charged ₱600 (US$14) per unit;&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; those who have between ₱135,000 and ₱80,000 (US$1,840) are charged ₱300 (US$7);&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; while those who have below ₱80,000 are not charged any fees.&lt;ref name='STFAP'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://admin.uplb.edu.ph/download_file.php?f=16 |title=Report of the Committee to Review the Socialized Tuition and Financial Assistance Program (STFAP) |publisher=University of the Philippines |date=7 December 2006 |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090908162625/http://admin.uplb.edu.ph/download_file.php?f=16 |archivedate=8 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additional financial assistance may be accessed through the Student Loan Board, which pays up to 80 percent of the tuition.&lt;ref name='ToFI'&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://fc01.deviantart.com/fs19/f/2007/270/e/d/UPLB_Perspective_Vol_34_Issue1_by_uplbperspective0708.pdf | title = ToFI Monitor: the real score behind the numbers | pages = 1, 4 | author = Aaron Joseph Aspi | volume = 34 | issue = 1 | journal = UPLB Perspective | date = 27 September 2007 | accessdate = 4 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarship and loan programs are also offered by some UPLB units, such as the College of Veterinary Medicine.&lt;ref name='Vetmed grants'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cvm.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/loan-grants |title=Loan Grants |date=3 December 2010 |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños College of Veterinary Medicine |accessdate=4 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110723073212/http://cvm.uplb.edu.ph/index.php/loan-grants |archivedate=23 July 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current rates were introduced in 2007. Previously, base tuition was only ₱300 per unit (since 1989).&lt;ref name="STFAP"/&gt; Library and miscellaneous fees were also increased in 2007, from ₱400 (US$9) per student to ₱1,100 (US$25) and ₱2,000 (US$46), respectively.&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; New fees, such as internet and energy fees, were introduced. The USC sees the over 300 percent increase in tuition as the reason for the low enrollment rate and high student loan levels, which totaled some ₱14&amp;nbsp;million (US$326,000)&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt; in 2007. Additionally, it criticizes the STFAP for allegedly being ineffective. Upon its introduction in 1989, only 16 percent of students received discounts. The number fell to 12 percent in 2007.&lt;ref name="ToFI"/&gt;

The Free Tuition Law mandates free tuition and fees for all state university students who are pursuing their degree for the first time. Students who avail of the subsidy will be required to provide return service, although it is possible to opt out and pay the full tuition instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=8 things you need to know about the free tuition law |url=https://www.rappler.com/nation/198314-things-to-know-free-tuition-law-irr |publisher=Rappler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the earliest innovations of UPLB was the production of CAC 87 sugar cane in 1919. This high-yielding variety is resistant to [[fiji disease virus|fiji]] and [[mosaic virus]]es, and produces more [[sucrose]] than other varieties. Its derivatives significantly increased sugar cane production in the [[Philippines]].&lt;ref name="100 Years 0"/&gt; Between 1921 and 1939, cattle, poultry, and swine breeding programs produced new breeds, namely the Philamin (a [[hybrid (biology)|hybrid]] of the [[Hereford (cattle)|Hereford]], [[Nellore]] and native cattle), Berkjala (a variety of the [[Berkshire (pig)|Berkshire]] and local [[Jala-Jala, Rizal|Jala-Jala]] pig, resistant to [[hog cholera]]) and the Los Baños Cantonese chicken, which produces more eggs.&lt;ref name = '100 Years 0.5'&gt;{{cite book| pages = 47–74 | chapter = Chs. 4–5 | year = 2007 | publisher = University of the Philippines Los Baños Alumni Association | location = Los Baños, Laguna | isbn = 978-971-547-252-4 | author = Fernando A.

===Biofuel research===

Pioneering efforts in [[biofuel]] research have been conducted at the university.

==Student life==

In 2008, 2,170 students&lt;ref name="A Statement on the Large Class Size Project"/&gt; were housed in the eight dormitories managed by UPLB. In the academic year 2011–2012, fees for all UPLB dormitories increased by at least 25 percent from the previous rate of ₱350 (US$8) a month.&lt;ref name="conversion"/&gt;&lt;ref name='dorm fee'&gt;{{cite book| url = http://www.uplb.edu.ph/attachments/401_announcement-dorm-rates-2011.pdf | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110723160357/http://www.uplb.edu.ph/attachments/401_announcement-dorm-rates-2011.pdf | dead-url = yes | archive-date = 23 July 2011 | title = New dorm fees | author = Margaret M.

===Student Organizations===

As of December 2012, there are 175 recognized student organizations in UPLB. Of these, 71 are academic, 15 are cultural, 2 are international, 2 are political, 10 are religious, 24 are socio-civic, 5 are sports and recreational, 21 are varsitarian, while 12 and 13 are [[fraternities and sororities]], respectively.&lt;ref name='UPLB org'&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.soadosa.org/orgs |title=SOAD-OSA: List of Organizations |accessdate=13 February 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502032952/https://www.soadosa.org/orgs |archive-date=2 May 2014 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Regional organizations were not recognized by UPLB prior to September 2008, when the [[University of the Philippines]] [[board of regents]] repealed Chapter 72 Article 444 of the 1984 University of the Philippines Code, which states that "organizations which are provincial, sectional or regional in nature shall not be allowed in the University System." Likewise, Section 3 of the code states that "the University of the Philippines System is a public, ''secular'', non-profit institution of higher learning." Due to this, religious organizations have had some difficulty in getting recognized.&lt;ref name='religion 1'&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://fc02.deviantart.net/fs38/f/2008/353/4/e/5th_Issue_by_uplbperspective0809.pdf |title = Recognition ng religious orgs, nakabinbin pa rin |author=Yves Christian Suiza |date=17 December 2008 |page=3 |volume=35 |issue=5 |journal=UPLB Perspective |accessdate=15 April 2011 |language=Tagalog}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='religion 2'&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/11644663/uplb-perspective-0809-2nd-ish |title=OSA holds recognition of religious, varsitarian orgs | author = Katrina Elauria | date = 4 September 2008 | volume = 35 | issue = 2 | accessdate = 15 April 2011 | journal = UPLB Perspective | pages = 2, 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='religion 3'&gt;{{cite journal | url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/11645011/uplb-perspective-0809-7th-ish | title = OSA withholds recognition of orgs | author = Faith Allyson Buenacosa| page = 7 | date = 29 January 2009 | issue = 7 | volume = 35 | journal = UPLB Perspective | accessdate = 15 April 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only recognized organizations are allowed to use UPLB facilities.&lt;ref name='Oble run'&gt;{{cite news | url = http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20101216-309245/UP-budget-slash-marks-APO-run-in-Los-Baos-campus | title = UP budget slash marks APO run in Los Baños campus | author = Maricar Cino | date = 16 December 2010 | newspaper = Philippine Daily Inquirer | accessdate = 10 April 2011 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20101219211033/http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/breakingnews/regions/view/20101216-309245/UP-budget-slash-marks-APO-run-in-Los-Baos-campus | archive-date = 19 December 2010 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The system of student organizations in UPLB is different from that of other UP constituents in that freshmen are not allowed to join any organization until they have earned at least 30 units.

===Loyalty Day===

Every October 10, UPLB celebrates Loyalty Day, which has also become UPLB's [[homecoming|alumni homecoming]]. The celebration commemorates events in 1918, when more than half of students and faculty (193 out of 300 students and 27 out of 32 faculty), including two women, enlisted in the [[Philippine National Guard]] for service in [[France]] during [[World War I]]. The volunteers never saw action, as the [[Allies of World War I|Allied Forces]] signed an [[armistice with Germany]] during the same year, essentially ending the war.&lt;ref name="100 Years 0"/&gt;&lt;ref name='alumni homecoming'&gt;{{cite web|url=http://old.uplb.edu.ph/centennial/1260 |title=89th UPLB Loyalty Day and Alumni Homecoming |publisher=University of the Philippines Los Baños |author=MM Catibog |accessdate=10 April 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110823155211/http://old.uplb.edu.ph/centennial/1260 |archivedate=23 August 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ='ARSECOM'&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.army.mil.ph/Army_Sites/INFANTRY%20DIVISIONS/arescom/4rcdg/403cdc/uplb/ar403_uplb_history.htm | title = UP ROTC Los Baños Unit | publisher = Armed Forces of the Philippines | accessdate = 10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Feb Fair===

The university holds a major campus fair, known as "Feb Fair", during [[Valentine’s Day|Valentine's]] week. The fair was initially held to express opposition to [[Martial Law in the Philippines|martial law]] under [[President of the Philippines|Philippine President]] [[Ferdinand Marcos]], who abolished student organizations and student councils.&lt;ref name='Feb fair'&gt;{{cite journal| url = https://www.scribd.com/doc/13215006/uplb-perspective-9th-ish | title = Students assess centennial feb fair | author = Nikko Caringal | pages= 3–4| journal= UPLB Perspective | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | date = 13 March 2009|accessdate= 10 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

}}The '''Venice in Peril Fund''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[registered charity]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EW charity|262146}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It raises funds to restore and conserve works of art and architecture in [[Venice]], and to investigate ways to protect them against future risks, particularly [[sea level rise|rising sea levels]]. The Fund is also committed to ensuring the [[sustainability]] of Venice, acting as a lobby and working to find answers to some of the critical [[Ecology|ecological]], [[Demographics|demographic]] and [[Socioeconomics|socio-economic]] issues that the city is facing. Its chairman is [[Jonathan Keates]], an author, and was a teacher at the [[City of London School]] before retiring in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jonathan Keates]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=per WP:CIRCULAR|date=May 2017}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veniceinperil.org/about-us/trustees-of-venice-in-peril|title=Trustees|author=|date=|website=Venice in Peril Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Venice in Peril Fund was created after the great floods in [[Florence]] and [[Venice]] in 1966. The disaster led to dozens of private citizens donating large sums of money and Sir [[Ashley Clarke]], former British Ambassador to Rome and chairman of the British Italian Society at that time, was asked to chair a committee to raise further funds to help rescue the two cities. This committee was constituted as the Art &amp; Archives Rescue Fund (IAARF) in 1967 and Sir Ashley was supported in his fundraising efforts by [[Carla Thorneycroft, Baroness Thorneycroft|Carla Thorneycroft]] (Italian-born wife of [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] [[Peter Thorneycroft]], later Lord Thorneycroft), and Nathalie Brooke, wife of [[Humphrey Brooke (art historian)|Humphrey Brooke]], the Secretary to the [[Royal Academy]].

By the end of July 1967 it was decided that fund-raising activity for Florence should be wound down gradually and that efforts would be redirected to Venice where the serious damage had been to the structure of the city. In 1971 a new statute was drawn up to replace the IAARF with the trust fund Venice in Peril. [[John Julius Norwich|John Julius]], [[Viscount Norwich]], joined as Chairman in 1971.

Anna Somers Cocks who was Chairman from 1999 to 2012 expanded the role of the charity to include research into the environmental and socio-economic threats facing the city.

The many successful fundraising efforts were helped enormously when, in 1977, [[Peter Boizot]], the founder of [[Pizza Express]], invented the Pizza Veneziana. A percentage of the sale price of every Pizza Veneziana sold is donated to Venice in Peril and by 2014 this initiative had raised £2m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.veniceinperil.org/pg/pizza-express-corporate-benefactors|title=Pizza Express|author=|date=|website=Venice in Peril Fund}}&lt;/ref&gt; Venice in Peril is extremely proud of this partnership.

By 2010, the Fund had completed 46 conservation and restoration projects in Venice, including the [[Gothic Architecture|Gothic]] [[Porta della Carta]] of the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]].  Three-quarters of its funds have been spent on religious buildings, including the late Gothic church of the [[Madonna dell'Orto]] in [[Cannaregio]], the ancient Veneto-[[Byzantine]] aisled church of [[San Nicolò dei Mendicoli]], and the 16th century [[Cappella Emiliani]] on the cemetery island of [[Isola di San Michele|San Michele]].  A new project is the restoration of a hydraulic crane inside the [[Arsenale]], built by [[Armstrong Mitchell]] in Newcastle in 1883, one of only two remaining in the world.

The water level in Venice has risen 23&amp;nbsp;cm since 1900 due to a combination of [[subsidence]] and the level of the Venice [[lagoon]] rising. Venice in Peril organised a [[symposium]] in [[London]] in 1998 to discuss the risk to low-lying cities, including Venice, as a result of rising sea levels; and funded the creation of a [[research fellowship]] at [[Churchill College, Cambridge]] from 2001 to 2004 to investigate ways to protect Venice from rising sea levels.  A conference was held in [[Cambridge]] in 2003, and a book ''The Science of Saving Venice'' was published in 2004.

In 2010, Venice in Peril initiated a campaign in which it solicited the support of the leading museum directors of the world against the vast advertisements on the [[Doge's Palace, Venice|Doge's Palace]] and down the [[Grand Canal (Venice)|Grand Canal]].{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
A photographic tribute was produced by international artists in 2011 to support the fund.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/gallery/2011/jun/13/venice-in-peril-in-pictures | title=Venice in Peril: tribute to a drowning city – in pictures | work=[[The Guardian]] | date=13 June 2011 | accessdate=August 26, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10310">'''White Student Unions''' are [[Students' union|student organizations]] that aim to represent the interests of white students on university and college campuses.  Historically, many of them were [[White Supremacy|white supremacist]] in nature and associated with the [[white separatism|white separatist movement]], though some modern ones disavow any connection to it.&lt;ref name="dobratz"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trolled"/&gt;

In 2015, a sudden eruption of Facebook pages that said they represented such organizations was sparked by a call from Andrew Anglin of the neo-Nazi blog ''[[The Daily Stormer]]'' and by posts on [[4chan]].  Few of the resulting organizations have official status on university and college campuses or an organized membership, with many only existing as unsubstantiated claims in [[social media]]; coverage has generally described them as hoaxes, often by people who did not even attend the schools they claimed to represent.&lt;ref name="facebookHoax"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dozens"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Dozens of White Student Unions appear on social media amid racism protests|url = https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/24/white-student-unions-campus-racism-protests-university-of-missouri|website = the Guardian|accessdate = 2016-01-01|first = Jamiles Lartey in New|last = York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYUfake"&gt;{{Cite web|title = NYU White Student Union Facebook page is a fake, school says|url = http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/manhattan/nyu-white-student-union-facebook-group-horrifies-school-article-1.2443708|website = NY Daily News|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryce"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jessica Bryce|url = http://www.wmfe.org/author/jbryce|website = 90.7 WMFE|accessdate = 2016-01-01|language = en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Western investigating 'White Student Union' page|url = http://london.ctvnews.ca/western-investigating-white-student-union-page-1.2669530#|website = London|accessdate = 2016-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===1960s and 1970s===
The first White Student Unions and similar organizations were initially born of the [[White separatism|white separatist movement]].&lt;ref name="dobratz"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dobratz|first1=Betty A.|last2=Shanks-Meile|first2=Stephanie L.|title=The White Separatist Movement in the United States: "White Power, White Pride!"|date=2000|publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press|page=69|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r59bGyH4lOAC&amp;pg=PA69}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, a White Student League was formed by white supremacist [[Tom Metzger (white supremacist)|Tom Metzger]] and his father, but it dissipated in the 1970s. In 1979, [[Greg Withrow]] incorporated Metzger's Aryan Youth Movement into the White Student Union as a "militant extension of the student struggle."&lt;ref name="dobratz"/&gt; [[Sacramento State University]] started the first one, and it extended to as many as 20 chapters across the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Willie|first1=Charles Vert|last2=Garibaldi|first2=Antoine M.|title=The Education of African-Americans|date=1991|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=0-86569-020-0|page=172|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qzbSXUb0rXcC&amp;pg=PA172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1980s and 1990s===

White Student Unions were organized at [[Temple University]] in 1988 and at [[Florida State University]] in 1989. Temple University "was forced to recognize it because it already recognized a host of all-minority institutions," [[Dinesh D'Souza]] wrote in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=D'Souza|first1=Dinesh|authorlink=Dinesh D'Souza|title=Illiberal Education: The Politics of Race and Sex on Campus|date=1991|publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|isbn=0-684-86384-7|page=269|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WUcWaePccnkC&amp;pg=PA269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, a White Student Union, with "avowedly White supremacist goals," was formed at the [[University of Minnesota]]. The university banned the group, but after debates about the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|First Amendment]], the ban was lifted and the group was allowed to register as a student organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Zanna|first1=Mark P.|last2=Olson|first2=James M.|title=The Psychology of Prejudice: The Ontario Symposium|date=2013|publisher=Psychology Press|page=51|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WzxHU1E4F_sC&amp;pg=PA51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2015–2016===

In November of 2015, a number of White Student Union pages emerged on [[social media]] platforms such as [[Facebook]], many apparently in response to a call to action by Neo-Nazi blogger Andrew Anglin of [[The Daily Stormer]], a white supremacist website, who called for his readers to create pages for many different schools, even for colleges they do not attend.  Many of the pages also seem to have been hoaxes coordinated on [[4chan]]; sources have described posts there instructing users to create the pages and take screenshots of the reaction, and compared it to similar hoaxes the website produced in the past.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dozens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nationalpost"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalpost.com/news/canada/white-student-union-facebook-group-stirs-controversy-on-western-university-campus|title=‘White Student Union’ Facebook group stirs controversy, skepticism on Western University campus - National Post|author=Kate Dubinski, Postmedia Network|date=24 November 2015|work=National Post|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYUfake"/&gt;  Most coverage has described these as hoaxes, and many universities have responded by contacting Facebook to have the groups removed or have asked that online groups remove any university insignia.&lt;ref name="SpreadNationwide"/&gt;&lt;ref name="facebookHoax"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/white-student-union-canadian-university-hoax-1.3332074|title=White student union Facebook groups on Canadian campuses appear to be a hoax|date=24 November 2015|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="abcnews"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/US/facebook-pages-purporting-represent-white-student-unions-spark/story?id=35392176|title=Facebook Pages Purporting To Represent 'White Student Unions' Spark Backlash On College Campuses|author=ABC News|work=ABC News|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The University of California, for instance, later sent a mass email to all then matriculated students over the controversy caused by the pages allegedly representing schools nationwide. The UC system, among other institutions, stated that the pages were not created by or on behalf of any members of the student body they claimed to represent.&lt;ref name="abcnews"/&gt;

Facebook received numerous complaints and reports regarding the pages, and some of them were eventually taken down for violating the site's community standards; many others remained, but remained mostly inactive since shortly after their creation.&lt;ref name="SpreadNationwide"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Baskin|first1=Morgan|title=White Student Union Facebook pages, believed to be fake, spread nationwide|url=http://college.usatoday.com/2015/11/25/white-student-union-facebook-pages-believed-to-be-fake-spread-nationwide/|website=USA Today|publisher=USA Today|accessdate=12 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The people behind these Facebook accounts said the organizations were real and that they were the product of students on campus who wanted [[safe space]]s for white students who feel stigmatized and silenced; but their pages and organizations were generally met with skepticism over their nature, purpose, and goals.&lt;ref name="ubc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://grsj.arts.ubc.ca/public-statement-on-campus-unsafety/|title=Public Statement on Campus (Un)Safety by some concerned graduate students at the Institute of Gender, Race, Sexuality, and Social Justice|publisher=|accessdate=15 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the creators of the initial string of pages have yet to be identified, some schools experienced "copycat" pages being created by actual members of the student body. One such individual, Matthew Heimbach, who says he is the founder of the White Student Union at [[Towson University]], for example, says that he is not racist; but critics point to his group's patrols against  supposed "black predators" as evidence of racism.  Defending the patrols, Heimbach writes that "White Southern men," he wrote, "have long been called to defend their communities when law enforcement and the State seem unwilling to protect our people."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Enzinna|first1=Wes|title=White Student Union|url=https://www.vice.com/video/white-student-union|accessdate=December 16, 2015|work=[[Vice (magazine)|VICE]]|date=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contacted anonymously, the people behind the Facebook pages have generally denied a connection to The Daily Stormer or to Andrew Anglin's call to action, though they generally declined to identify themselves or provide proof that they were members of the schools they named.&lt;ref name="dozens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trolled"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYUfake"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryce"/&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt; While they denied an association with racism or white supremacy, many of them said that they felt that whitehood was stigmatized or under attack; some said that their organizations contained non-white members.&lt;ref name="facebookHoax"/&gt;&lt;ref name="trolled"&gt;{{Cite web|title = ‘We trolled so hard we became real’: meet the founders of UBC’s White Student Union|url = http://www.scmp.com/comment/blogs/article/1893997/we-trolled-so-hard-we-became-real-meet-founders-ubcs-white-student|website = South China Morning Post|accessdate = 2015-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bryce"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dozens"/&gt;&lt;ref name="NYUfake"/&gt;
