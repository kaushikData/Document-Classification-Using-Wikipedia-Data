'''20th-century French philosophy''' is a strand of contemporary [[philosophy]] generally associated with post-[[World War II]] [[French philosophy|French thinkers]], although it is directly influenced by previous [[philosophical movement]]s.

==Bergson==

The work of [[Henri Bergson]] (1859–1941)&lt;ref&gt;http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bergson/&lt;/ref&gt; is often considered the division point between nineteenth- and twentieth-century French philosophy. Essentially, despite his respect for mathematics and science, he pioneered the French movement of scepticism towards the use of scientific methods to understand human nature and metaphysical reality. [[Positivism]], of which, for example, the [[France|French]] [[sociology|sociologist]] [[Durkheim]] was interested in at the time, was not appropriate, he argued. Unlike later philosophers, Bergson was highly influenced by biology, particularly [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[Origin of Species]]'', which was released the year of Bergson's birth. This led Bergson to discuss the 'Body' and 'Self' in detail, arguably prompting the fundamental ontological and epistemological questions to be raised later in the 20th century. Bergson's work was a major influence on [[Gilles Deleuze]], who wrote a monograph on him (''[[Bergsonism]]'') and whose philosophical analyses of cinema (''[[Cinema 1: The Movement Image]]'' and ''[[Cinema 2: The Time-Image]]'') develop his ideas.

== Philosophy of science ==

Following debates concerning the [[foundation of mathematics]] around the mathematician and philosopher [[Henri Poincaré]] (1854–1912), who opposed [[Bertrand Russell]] and [[Frege]], various French philosophers started working on [[philosophy of science]], among them [[Gaston Bachelard]], who developed a discontinuist view of science, [[Jean Cavaillès]] (1903–1944), [[Jules Vuillemin]] (1920-2001), or [[Georges Canguilhem]], who would be a strong influence of [[Michel Foucault]] ; in his introduction to Canguilhem's ''The Normal and the Pathological'', Foucault wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Take away Canguilhem and you will no longer understand much about [[Louis Althusser|Althusser]], Althusserism and a whole series of discussions which have taken place among French Marxists; you will no longer grasp what is specific to sociologists such as [[Pierre Bourdieu|Bourdieu]], [[Robert Castel]], [[Jean-Claude Passeron]] and what marks them so strongly within sociology; you will miss an entire aspect of the theoretical work done by psychoanalysts, particularly by the followers of [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]]. Further, in the entire discussion of ideas which preceded or followed the [[May 1968 in France|movement of '68]], it is easy to find the place of those who, from near or from afar, had been trained by Canguilhem.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Starting in the 1980s, [[Bruno Latour]] (b. 1947), teacher at the engineering school ''[[École nationale supérieure des mines de Paris]]'', would develop the [[actor-network theory]], a distinctive approach to social theory and research, best known for its controversial insistence on the agency of nonhumans.

== The Sorbonne ==

Many philosophers and historians of philosophy were teachers at the Sorbonne, the [[University of Paris]], including [[Léon Brunschvicg]] &lt;ref&gt;French philosophy in the twentieth century, Gary Gutting, Cambridge University Press, 2001,  p. 40&lt;/ref&gt; (1869–1944), co-founder of the ''[[Revue de Métaphysique et de Morale]]'' with [[Xavier Léon]] and [[Elie Halévy]], [[Martial Guéroult]] (1891–1976) and successor of [[Étienne Gilson]] at the [[Collège de France]] in 1951, [[Ferdinand Alquié]], [[Paul Ricœur]], etc. [[Jean Wahl]] taught between 1936 and 1967 and helped introduce the philosophy of [[Søren Kierkegaard]] to French thinkers.

==Personalism==
{{main|Personalism}}
[[Emmanuel Mounier]] (1905–1950) was a guiding spirit in the French [[personalism|personalist]] movement, and founder and director of ''[[Esprit (magazine)|Esprit]]'', the magazine which was the organ of the movement. Mounier, who was the child of peasants, was a brilliant scholar at the Sorbonne. In 1929, when he was only twenty-four, he came under the influence of the French writer, Charles Péguy, to whom he ascribed the inspiration of the personalist movement.

[[Gabriel Marcel|Gabriel Honoré Marcel]] (1889–1973) was a leading Catholic [[existentialism|existentialist]] and the author of about 30 plays. He shared a great deal in common with Mounier's ideas. They both show Bergson's influence in their assessment of 'being', specifically the [[Mystery of Being]]. Interest of Mounier and Marcel in the problems of technology moved French philosophy forward.

==Jean-Paul Sartre and Existentialism==

[[Sartre]] (1905–1980) was, if only by birth, the first truly 20th-century French philosopher. He was probably also the most famous, as a dramatist, screenwriter, novelist and critic. Sartre popularized (and named) [[existentialism]], making it better known to the lay-person than, for instance, [[deconstruction]]. [[phenomenology (philosophy)|Phenomenology]] and [[Marxism]] were two other key concerns of his. A leading figure of the [[French Left]], Sartre was opposed on his right by [[Raymond Aron]].

==Merleau-Ponty==

Maurice [[Merleau Ponty]] (1908–1961) was a French phenomenologist philosopher, strongly influenced by [[Edmund Husserl]]. Merleau-Ponty is classified as an existentialist thinker because of his close association with Jean-Paul Sartre and [[Simone de Beauvoir]], and his distinctly [[Heideggerian]] conception of Being.

==Marxist philosophers==

It is important to realise that, as well as holding many varying degrees and interpretations of [[Marxism]], many French Philosophers' views on it shifted substantially during their lifetime. [[Sartre]], for instance, became more influenced by Marx during the course of his life.

[[Alexandre Kojève]] (1902–1968) was a Marxist and Hegelian political philosopher, who had a substantial influence on intellectual life in France in the 1930s and on the reading of Hegel in France.

[[Louis Althusser]] (1918–1990) was a key Marxist philosopher, sometimes considered to be the [[Structuralism|structuralist]] equivalent to Marxism that [[Jacques Lacan|Lacan]] was to [[Psychoanalysis]] and [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]] to [[ethnology]] (although all of them rejected the identification).In 'Lenin and Philosophy', Althusser explained Lenin's differentiation between [Dialectical Materialism] and [Historical Materialism]. He said the former was the philosophy and the latter was the science, and claimed that in history science has always preceded Philosophy. One of his seminal works was ''[[Reading Capital]]'' (1965), co-written with [[Étienne Balibar]], [[Roger Establet]], [[Jacques Rancière]] and [[Pierre Macherey]]. He opposed [[Hegel]]'s [[teleology|teleological]] approach to history, drew on [[Bachelard]]'s concept of "[[epistemological break]]" and defined philosophy as "class struggle in theory."

Other Marxist authors include [[Henri Lefebvre]] (1901–1999), who partly influenced the [[Situationist International|Situationist]] and [[Guy Debord]], the group ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'' aforementioned, Althusser's students Etienne Balibar (author of [The Philosophy of Marx]), Jacques Rancierre, and perhaps most prominently, Alain Badiou. Badiou's most well-known work is undoubtedly [Being and Event], but his analysis of the May 68 revolts in [The Communist Hypothesis] is well known as well. Recently, Slavoj Zizek has gained prominence as a French Marxist of Slovene origin, primarily for his re-reading of Marx using Lacan and Hegel.

==Structuralism==

The [[Structuralism|structuralist]] movement in French philosophy was highly influenced by the Swiss thinker [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913). His ideas laid the foundation for many of the significant developments in [[linguistics]] in the 20th century. He is widely considered the 'father' of 20th-century linguistics.

This current was further explored by Claude-Levi Strauss in ethnology. His work influenced important figures like Jacques Derrida and Jacques Lacan significantly. From 1963, a magazine was run in Paris, called [[Tel Quel]], which also dabbled excessively in structuralist analysis of texts. Important figures in this endeavour were Phillip Sollers, the magazine's editor, Julia Kristeva and Roland Barthes.

[[Jacques Lacan]] (1901–1981) was specifically interested in the philosophy of [[psychoanalysis]]. He could be said to be relevant to the more modern foundations of [[discursive psychology]].

==Post-structuralism==
[[Post-structuralism]] is, like [[structuralism]], an ambiguous term in some respect. It is first important to understand the nature of the schools of thought - as often it seems they aren't truly separate 'schools' at all. Much like Sartre's interest in art, both of these movements are important to a wide range of academic disciplines. E.g., [[English literature]], [[cultural studies]], [[media studies]]/[[film studies]], [[anthropology]], etc. etc.

[[Michel Foucault]] (1926–1984), although sometimes considered close to structuralism, quickly drew apart from this movement, developing a specific approach to [[semiology]] and [[history]] which he dubbed "archeology." His influence is broad-ranging, and his work includes books such as ''[[Madness and Civilization]]'' (1961), ''[[The Order of Things]]'' (1966), ''[[Discipline and Punish|Discipline and Punish: The Birth of Prison]]'' (1975) or ''[[The History of Sexuality]]''.

[[Gilles Deleuze]], who wrote the ''[[Anti-Oedipus]]'' (1972) with [[Félix Guattari]], criticizing psychoanalysis, was, like Foucault, one of the key thinkers who introduced a thorough reading of [[Nietzsche]] in France, following [[Georges Bataille]]'s early attempts &amp;mdash; Bataille published the ''[[Acéphale]]'' review from 1936 to 1939, along with [[Pierre Klossowski]], another close reader of Nietzsche, [[Roger Caillois]] and [[Jean Wahl]]. Deleuze wrote books such as ''[[Difference and Repetition]]'', ''[[The Logic of Sense]]'', ''[[Spinoza: Practical Philosophy]]'' (1970), and also wrote on Bergson, [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], Nietzsche, etc., as well as other works on cinema (''[[Cinema 1: The Movement Image]]''). Both Deleuze and Foucault attempted to take distance from the strong influence of Marxism and psychoanalysis in their works, in part by means of a radical reinterpretation of [[Marx]] and [[Freud]].

[[Jacques Derrida]] (1930–2004) was an Algerian-born French philosopher, known as the founder of [[deconstruction]]. His voluminous work had a profound impact upon continental philosophy and literary theory.

[[Jean-François Lyotard]] (1924–1998) was a philosopher and literary theorist. He is well known for his articulation of [[Postmodernism]] after the late 1970s.

Other authors include [[Jean Baudrillard]], who started with a [[Situationist International|situationist]] criticism of [[Consumption Society]] in the 1970s to evolve towards a reflection on [[simulation]] and [[virtual reality]], [[Paul Virilio]], both a philosopher and an [[urbanism|urbanist]], [[Cornelius Castoriadis]], who was, along with [[Claude Lefort]], co-founder of ''[[Socialisme ou Barbarie]]'' and criticized orthodox Marxism, [[Alain Badiou]], [[François Laruelle]], who developed "[[Non-philosophy]]" starting in the 1980s, [[Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe]], [[Paul Ricoeur]] (administrator of the [[University of Nanterre]] during [[May '68]]), [[Emmanuel Levinas]], [[Vincent Descombes]], etc.

==20th-century French feminism==
{{main|French Feminism}}
The [[Feminist]] movement in contemporary France (or at least that which can be placed in the 'Philosophy' genre) is characterised more by [[deconstructionism]] and [[Marxism]] than much Anglo-American Feminism. Key thinkers include psychoanalytic and cultural theorist [[Luce Irigaray]] (born 1930), psychoanalyst and writer [[Julia Kristeva]] (born 1941), writer and philosopher [[Simone de Beauvoir]], writer and cultural theorist [[Helen Cixous]] and artist and psychoanalyst [[Bracha Ettinger]].

==Important influences==

One suggested way of understanding French philosophy of this period, it has been suggested, is to locate the major influential figures in their current. The major influences were primarily 6 Germans from preceding eras - Hegel, Marx, Freud, Nietzsche, Husserl, Heidegger. For example, Alexander Kojeve's [[Lectures on the Phenomenology of Spirit]] were quite a sensation in Paris in the 1930s. It was attended by George Batailles and a young Jacques Lacan among others. Jean Wahl and Jean Hippolyte were also responsible for spreading Hegel's lectures into Parisian circles.

Marx was introduced to philosophers both inside and outside the university. Many, like Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, grew up during the Resistance against Nazi occupation, during which time they were introduced to Marxist-Leninists.

Nietzsche's influence went through George Batailles and the [[Acephale]] group, down to Foucault and Deleuze. The [[Acephale]] group is partly responsible for reclaiming Nietzsche for Western Philosophy, after decades of Nazi appropriation.

Heidegger and Husserl's influence was felt, firstly, in the existential-phenomenology of Sartre and Merleau-Ponty. Even Simon de Beauvoir's feminism borrowed extensively from this current. She used phenomenological conceptualizations of consciousness, time and memory to conceptualize Woman. Later, most famously, Jacques Derrida deconstructed Husserl in [[Of Grammatology]].

Finally, Freud was most avidly championed by Jacques Lacan's "return to Freud". Lacan's lectures caused a stir in Parisian intellectual circles akin to Alexander Kojeve's a generation earlier. Attended only by clinical trainees at first, as time wore on Lacan opened up his seminars to philosophers and artists of various kinds. Lacan's writings impacted the whole generation - while Louis Althusser found the theoretical apparatus in Lacan to talk about interpellation and ideology, Jacques Alain Miller, Althusser's student at first, would go on to become Lacan's most devoted follower. The French Feminists  - Irigaray, Kristeva, Cixous, responded to Lacan in various ways, and perhaps most famously, Deleuze and Guattari's [[Anti-Oedipus]] presented a strong critique of the practise of psychoanalysis.

==The role of politics==

20th century French philosophers lived through several very important political upheavals during their time. On the one hand, there was the Resistance against the Nazi forces. For Sartre and Merleau-Ponty, this was the first introduction to communism. Later, they would both become members of the [[French Communist Party|PCF]]. The other important political event of that era was the Algerian War of Independence, to which the young Foucault, Derrida and [[Frantz Fanon]] went. While the [[French Communist Party|PCF]] had a problematic role to play, dissident Marxist-Leninists of that era went there to help rebelling Algerians. Undoubtedly, for the next generation, the great political upheaval was the student-worker protests of May 1968. Young radicals, from the Sorborne and [[Ecole Normale Supérieure]] organized, went to the factories and encouraged the worker's to go on strike. Many young radicals broke away from Marxism–Leninism towards Maoism at this point, while there were several Anarchists, Trotskyites, Situationists etc. at the protests as well.

Each of these events have shaped the content as well as the form of the writing of these French philosophers. Time and again, the movements have questioned the French state, the university, imperialism and capitalism as well. This has provided impetus, material and structural change to the current of French philosophy consistently.

'''Abhava''' means [[non-existence]], [[negation]], [[nothing]] or absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Concise Dictionary of Indian Philosophy|author=John A.Grimes|publisher=SUNY Press|page=3|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=eP5p0ev3nJEC&amp;pg=PA4&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CDsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the negative of Bhava which means being, becoming, existing or appearance.

==Overview==
Uddayana divides ''[[Padārtha]]'' (Categories) into ''[[Bhava]]'' ([[existence]]) which is real, and ''Abhava'' ([[non-existence]]) which is not real. ''[[Dravya]]'' ([[Matter|substance]]), ''[[Guṇa]]'' (quality), ''[[Karma]]'' ([[Social actions|action]]), ''Samanya'' (community or generality), ''Visesa'' (particularity or partimerity) and ''Samavaya'' ([[inherence]]) are the marks of existence. ''Abhava'' has not been categorically defined by the [[Vaisheshika]] School of [[Hindu philosophy]] but is of four kinds viz – 1) ''Pragabhava'' i.e. Prior non-existence, 2) ''Pradhvamsabhava'' i.e. Posterior non-existence, 3) ''Atyantabhava'' i.e.  Absolute non-existence, and 4) ''[[Anyonyabhava]]'' i.e. Mutual non-existence.

# ''Pragabhava'' i.e. Prior non-existence, is the non-existence of an effect in its material cause before production; it has a beginning it has an end because it is destroyed by the production of the effect. Without prior non-existence there cannot be an effect.
# ''Pradhvamsabhava'' i.e.Posterior non-existence, is the non-existence of an effect by its destruction; as such it has a beginning but no end i.e. it cannot be destroyed.
# ''Atyantabhava'' i.e. Absolute non-existence, or absolute negation is non-existence in all times i.e. denial of an absolutely non-existent entity in all times and in all places. It is the state of absolute abstraction.
# ''[[Anyonyabhava]]'' i.e. Mutual non-existence, is denial of identity between two things, which have specific nature. [[Negation]] other than mutual negation is negation of relation.

The process with which the sound value collapses into the point value of the gap existing between the first and the next syllable of the first letter of the [[Rigveda]], ''Agnim'', is ''Pradhvamsabhava'', the silent point of all possibilities within the gap is ''Atyantabhava'', the structuring dynamics of what happens within the gap ''[[Anyonyabhava]]'', and the mechanics by which the sound emerges from the point value of the gap i.e. emergence of the following syllable, is ''Pragabhava''; this mechanism is inherent in both syllables.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Plays about Famous Artists|author=Daniel Meyer Dinkgrafe|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Press|page=89|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=wR50GEyHk-QC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Vaisheshika]], the [[Nyaya]], the Bhatta [[Mimamsa]] and [[Dvaita]] schools hold ''Abhava'' as a distinct category. Recognised as a reality by the Nyaya school, ''Abhava'' is often stated to be the reality of the greatest moment in the pluralistic universe and is connected with [[Moksha|Mukti]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of the Hindu World Vol.1|author=Ganga Ram Garg|publisher=Concept Publishing Company|page=96|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=w9pmo51lRnYC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;lpg=PA96&amp;dq=abhava&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=O8c7pBYtaP&amp;sig=BfLw4cirP6wV_7Rpusu11hE2MNM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9kInUe_KDsj5rAfSlYGwBw&amp;sqi=2&amp;ved=0CD0Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a relative word, for there can be ''abhava'' only when previously there is ''bhava''; moreover it is an event occurring in time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=PrasannapadaE|author=Theodor Stcherbatsky|page=28|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=itTFXt6ZmVQC&amp;pg=PA28&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Nagarjunian Disputations|author=Thomas E. Wood|publisher=University of Hawai Press|page=180|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jHlvuNFxUlYC&amp;pg=PA180&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=4FknUaqCNc6mrAfF34CoAw&amp;ved=0CFwQ6AEwCDgK#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nyaya and the Siddhantin maintain that the cognition of ''abhava'' is due to perception involving special kind of contact or sense contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopaedia of Saivism|author=Swami Parmeshwaranand|publisher=Sarup &amp;Sons|page=40|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ro-8reHVgoC&amp;pg=PA40&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CEcQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Abhava'' is that unmanifest level from where the concrete ''Bhava'' arises or emerges. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Mirror of Consciousness|author=Anna J. Bonshek|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=194|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sT13ws7RKgYC&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YkonUazIJIf8rAeq44CYCQ&amp;ved=0CFcQ6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vasubandhu]] has referred to ''[[Sunyata]]'' having the characteristic of the own-being of ''abhava'', rather than a characteristic consisting of ''bhava'' which [[Sthiramati]] observes is in fact not redundant, which means ''abhava'' does not negate ''bhava''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Buddhist Philosophy of the Middle|author=David S.

The acceptance of abhava as an independent padartha having ontological reality of its own is a peculiar feature of Indian philosophical tradition. [[Dharmakirti]] considered ''abhava'' as an ''[[anumana]]''. He had brought in the idea of imaginary presence of that whose absence was apprehended in order to explain the specificity of the absence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Contrary Thinking|author=Daya Krishna|page=125|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a44AHKGef64C&amp;pg=PA125&amp;dq=abhava&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=K10nUY_cOsLlrAfV2oGwDA&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwADgU#v=onepage&amp;q=abhava&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
After [[Partition of India|Partition]], when Ahmed arrived at the Walton refugee camp with millions of other migrants, he used to make announcements of directions on a [[megaphone]] around the clock for the refugees. Later, he got a job in 'Radio Azad Kashmir', which was established on a truck that used to drive around in various parts of [[Kashmir]]. He then got lectureship at [[Dayal Singh College, Lahore]] for two years. Whereafter, he went to [[Rome]] to join 'Radio Rome' as an Urdu newscaster. He also used to teach Urdu at 'Rome University'. During his stay in Europe, he received diplomas in the Italian and French languages from the 'Sapienza University of Rome|University of Rome' and [[University of Grenoble]], France. He also earned a special training diploma in radio broadcasting from [[New York University]].&lt;ref name="Hamari Web" /&gt;

==Career==
He started writing stories in his childhood, which were published in ''Phool'' [Flower] magazine. After returning to Pakistan from Europe, he took out his own monthly literary magazine, Dastaango [Story Teller], and joined [[Radio Pakistan]] as a script writer. He was made editor of the popular Urdu weekly, Lail-o-Nahar [Day and Night], in place of famous poet Sufi [[Ghulam Mustafa Tabassum]] by the [[Government of Pakistan]].&lt;ref name=zaviia.com /&gt;

In 1962, Ahmed started his popular radio program, '''Talqeen Shah''' [The Preacher] which made him immensely popular among the people in towns and villages.&lt;ref name=DailyTimes&gt;http://archives.dailytimes.com.pk/national/23-Dec-2004/ashfaq-ahmed-paid-tribute, Retrieved 13 March 2016&lt;/ref&gt; He was appointed director of the Markazi Urdu Board in 1966, which was later renamed as Urdu Science Board, a post he held for 29 years.&lt;ref name="Hamari Web" /&gt;  He remained with the board until 1979.

==Later years and death==
[[File:Ashfaq Ahmed's Grave.jpg|thumb|Ashfaq Ahmed's Grave in Model Town, Lahore]]
Ahmed, in his later years of life, was greatly inclined towards [[Sufism]].&lt;ref name=Nation.com.pk&gt;{{cite web|title=Ashfaq Ahmed promoted sufism|url=http://www.nation.com.pk/pakistan-news-newspaper-daily-english-online/lahore/08-Sep-2009/Ashfaq-Ahmed-promoted-sufism|publisher=Nation.com.pk|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His close association with [[Qudrat Ullah Shahab]] and [[Mumtaz Mufti]] was also attributed to this tendency. He used to appear in a get together with his fans in [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]] program ''Baithak'' (The Guest Room) and ''Zaviya'' (The Dimension) where he gave swift but satisfying responses to each and every question posed by the youth audience.&lt;ref name=zaviia.com /&gt;

It is told that when the sage was in his mother's womb, his father '''Kagola''' made several mistakes while reciting the Vedas. Hearing these,  the unborn sage laughed. The father became enraged and cursed his son to be born as Astavakra. So it came to pass that he was born crooked in eight places. These crooks earned him the name Ashtavakra or Eight Crooks. Yet '''Kagola''' was later defeated in a philosophical debate with Vandin, the court scholar. While still a boy the sage, a natural scholar of great ability went to court and avenged his father's defeat by beating Vandin in argument and becoming the [[guru]] of [[Janaka]]. Accordingly, his father blessed him and his deformity vanished.&lt;ref name="Light on Yoga"&gt;{{cite book

[[File:Baba Dittu Ji.jpg|thumb|Baba Dittu Ji's typical manifestation]]
'''Baba Dittu Ji''' is the ultimate Guru of the '''Gadia''' clan, a section of the Shwetambar Sthanakvasi [[Jain]] sect.

==The Gadia Clan==
The Gadia story started about 900 years ago in a village called Chanderi, in the [[India]]n state of [[Rajasthan]]. In the year 1141 AD, '''Acharya Shri Jin Dutt Suri Ji''', who Jains respectfully call '''''Dada Guru Dev''''', segregated the Jain society into 499 sects or cults, called '''''Gotras'''''. These were like small families within the larger purview of the Jain society as such. The Gadia cult is one of those 499 cults and is in perennial existence for the past 900 years.

It is believed that the ruler of Chanderi, "King Khardar Singh Rathore" was extremely impressed by the thoughts and ideas of Shri Dada Guru Dev Ji and subsequently adopted the Jain religion. King Khardar Singh had a son called "Bhainsay Shah". King Bhainsay Shah’s fifth son was named "Gadhaiye Shah" and it is from him that the Gadia gotra got its name as "Gadia". Venerable Shri Baba Dittu Ji is believed to be the Guru of the Gadia clan and is therefore eternally associated with the Gadia society.

The Gadia family started expanding and reached out to different parts of India, primarily the north-western Indian state of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]]. A large section of the community got settled in the city of [[Sialkot]] in Punjab (present day [[Pakistan]]). It is from Sialkot, that the Gadia family grew exponentially in size, prestige and influence. Slowly, the cultural influence of Punjab overshadowed the Rajasthani roots of Gadia society and it became a predominantly "Punjabi" society. The language, customs, traditions, festivals - all gained a Punjabi touch and the Gadia community accepted it with open arms. However, the overarching Jain faiths continued to be in place, as strong as a Rock, and ensured that the Gadia community maintained its own identity of "Jains" within the "Punjabi" culture. The key Jain ethics and beliefs in vegetarianism, non-violence, non-indulgence continued to be unshaken and undeterred all this while.

As we approached the era which of modern history, the community expanded further and moved to other parts of India, but the hub continued to be Sialkot. Then came that tragic event in the history of India which divided us into two separate nations – India and Pakistan. Politics played its dirty game and the [[India-Pakistan partition]] happened in 1947. This drove almost all members of the Gadia community out of Sialkot and other parts of the present day Pakistan. Many members of the community left everything back in Pakistan and travelled to different parts of India as refugees. Among all parts of India, most of the Gadia families moved to the cities of [[Jammu]], [[Amritsar]], [[Ludhiana]], [[Meerut]] and [[Delhi]]. Although many families had to start from scratch, by the grace of Baba Dittu Ji, all recovered and re-established themselves in their new homes. As a result, today, the Gadia families are one of the most affluent and economically successful families in the Jain society and have their presence throughout India and many parts of the world.

'''''"Venerable Shri Baba Dittu Ji"''''' is the ultimate Guru of the Gadia clan. He is believed to be the protector, the preserver, the very guardian of the Gadia society. He continues to be the guiding light behind the Gadia gotra and this eternal association between Baba Dittu Ji and the Gadia clan is at the very crux of the Gadia faith. His image resides in the heart of every member of the Gadia family and their loyalty to Baba Dittu Ji is absolute and supreme in nature. Members of the Gadia clan say that their hands fold and their heads bow down in devotion to Baba Dittu Ji. This faith, this conviction, this belief in Baba Dittu Ji is unequivocal and ceaseless in every member of the Gadia clan.

To this date, whenever someone in Gadia families embarks on a journey, he/she makes it a point to remember Baba Dittu Ji in the heart for a safe and successful journey. Any festival, any auspicious event starts with remembering and meditating on Baba Dittu Ji. Remembering Baba Dittu Ji during birth ceremonies and wedding ceremonies is a tradition which has become a part of the Gadia way of life. In case of any trouble, any danger, Baba Dittu Ji is considered to be their ultimate savior. It is believed that when a person is under his divine blessing, nothing can go wrong.

Many times, we do come across such events which are beyond the scope of human explanation. We can either call them super-natural or simply inexplicable. But these are the moments when we realize that there really is some force which spans beyond our definition of the laws of nature. They take us to a new dimension of super-consciousness and convince us to believe in something that we don’t explicitly see. Shri Baba Dittu Ji has that power, that divine enigma to make people believe in those mystical connotations which would ordinarily be considered impossible. The Gadia community believes that Baba Dittu Ji has demonstrated his heavenly presence on many occasions, which break all shackles of disbelief. They believe that his image transcends all barriers of human imagination.

==Tomri Temples==
[[File:Sanctum Sanctorum at Delhi Tomri.jpg|thumb|Sanctum Sanctorum at Delhi Tomri]]
The temples dedicated to "Venerable Shri Baba Dittu Ji" are referred to as "Tomri Mandirs". These Tomris are considered to be the adobes of the divine grace of Baba Dittu Ji. The first Tomri mandir was established in Sialkot (in present-day Pakistan), and is obviously beyond the reach of present-day Gadia families (since most of them are in India now). However, there are three Tomri Mandirs in India which attract hundreds of Gadia families every day of the year. These tomris are located in Jammu, Ludhiana and Delhi.

'''Jammu Tomri'''&lt;br /&gt;
In the year 1920, some Gadia families brought certain components from the Sialkot Tomri and established a Tomri Mandir at Jammu. The Jammu Tomri, thus remains the first and the oldest Tomri in India. It is located in a beautiful campus in Talaab Tillon area of Jammu.

'''Ludhiana Tomri'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Ludhiana Tomri is located in a large, beautiful, green campus at village Kanech in [[Sahnewal]] district near Ludhiana (Punjab). The Ludhiana tomri is considered to be especially sacred since it is believed that Baba Dittu Ji appeared at this tomri in "Naag (snake) form". This tomri mandir has a large, full-wall photograph that was taken when Baba Ji appeared there in his divine manifestation of the snake.

'''Delhi Tomri'''&lt;br /&gt;
The Delhi Tomri was envisioned in the year 1998. Construction started in the year 2000 after much deliberations with the Delhi government over allotment of land. On 25 January 2004, members of the Delhi Gadia community went to Jammu and brought some soil from the Jammu Tomri, as Baba Ji’s blessing. On 2 May 2004, the Tomri Mandir was formally inaugurated and made available to the Gadia families. Regular monthly events take place at the Tomri which ensures that the Gadia community remains connected in its devotion to Shri baba Dittu Ji.

'''Bak Jiwon''' ({{Korean|hangul=박지원|hanja=朴趾源}}; 1737-1805), styled '''Yeonam''' ({{Korean|hangul=연암|hanja=燕巖}}, 'Rock of swallow'), was a philosopher and novelist in the late [[Joseon Dynasty]]. He has been regarded as one of the greatest thinkers of the so-called "[[Silhak|Practical Learning (silhak)]]" movement. Bak Jiwon belonged to the "School of Profitable Usage and Benefiting the People" ({{Korean|hangul=이용후생파|hanja=利用厚生派|rr=Iyong Husaeng-pa}}) to promote the industrialization of his country and the development of trade by positively introducing western technologies to Joseon Korea. Bak Jiwon proposed that Joseon import advanced technologies from the [[Qing Dynasty]], and promote [[mercantilism]].&lt;ref name="Seoul 03/11"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.naver.com/main/read.nhn?mode=LSD&amp;mid=sec&amp;sid1=102&amp;oid=081&amp;aid=0002168340|script-title=ko:고전 인물로 다시읽기: 글쓰기 ‘프리랜서’ 연암 박지원|trans-title=Discovering classics: the 'freelancerer' Yonam Bak Jiwon|date=7 March 2011|accessdate=8 June 2012|language=Korean|work=Seoul Shinmun|author=Koh Mi-suk (고미숙)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The scholars [[Bak Jega]], [[Yu Deukgong]] and [[Yi Deokmu]] were influenced by Bak Jiwon.

== Belief ==
Along with [[Hong Daeyong]], he argued that the ground is not flat but round. He saw that the earth could be a large circle, not a flat surface. It also claimed that the land consists of one dust and soil. He argued that the world is objectively real, from celestial bodies to all things, and that everything in the universe is created in the process of the particle of dust and movement and change. Park's claim that the earth is a round circle was accepted as absurd.

== personal criticism ==
Park Ji-won's appearance is described in &lt;Gwajeong-rok(過庭錄)&gt; written by his son, Park Jong-chae. He was tall and very big, had a long face, prominent cheekbones, and a double eyelid. The record is almost identical to the remaining portraits of Park Ji-won. Park also said that his voice was so loud that he could be heard far outside the fence even if he spoke. Although there was one portrait depicting Park Ji-won as a middle-aged man, Yeonam forced him to destroy the portrait, saying it was less than 70 percent of his original self, and he never accepted his son's plea to paint it again.

Park Ji-won was also not able to negotiate easily with others. Kim Ki-soon said," He lacked the power to hold down smoothly because he was so graceful, and he was always too strong to have a smooth side. " Park Ji-won also admitted, " It's all because of my personality that I've been through this sort of mess all my life. " In fact, Park entered the government office with a sound letter and served as a minister of internal affairs and internal affairs, but was not included in key posts in the government.

In 1981, Bowles purchased some 640 acres of high desert, located near [[Joshua Tree National Park]]. Since then, he has slowly added [[drought tolerance|desert-adapted plants]], as well as small ponds among the [[boulder|boulders]] and hills of his retreat.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.anaalic.com/blog/2018/2/17/desert-sanctuary&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2vrbzyR18A&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L2vrbzyR18A&lt;/ref&gt; He also was inspired to name the road leading to and through his property, "Gods Way Love".&lt;ref&gt;http://thelostexplorer.com/magazine/lost-in-the-high-desert&lt;/ref&gt;

Boulder Gardens has become a popular spot for campers, and includes a small visitor cabin as well.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.desertusa.com/desert-activity/california-yucca-valley.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.joshuadesertretreats.com/events/socal-psychout/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YO_3DCVeH1c&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Butter Project''' or simply  '''Butter''' is a suite of [[Open-source software|open-source]] desktop and mobile applications that allow [[Streaming media|video-streaming]] over the [[BitTorrent]] protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.yibada.com/articles/77626/20151025/popcorn-time-shutdown-was-the-result-of-outsiders-site-suffered-extensive-dns-attacks-and-tempering-developers-launch-project-butter.htm|title=Popcorn Time Shutdown Was The Result Of Outsiders, Site Suffered DNS Attacks And Tempering; Developers Launch Project Butter|date=2015-10-25|website=Yibada|access-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project was first made public on 23 October 2015.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.inquisitr.com/2524990/video-streaming-service-popcorn-time-has-shut-down-in-lieu-of-project-butter/|title=Video Streaming Service Popcorn Time Has Shut Down In Lieu Of Project Butter|website=The Inquisitr News|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aim is to create a completely legal base which other applications can use to provide streaming functionality.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Butter Project was created as a split from [[Popcorn Time]] when the latter met legal difficulties — with Butter Project aiming to retain development of only expressly legal and permissible portions of the code-base, relating to video-streaming. The developers have asserted Butter Project will not use any of the popcorntime.io infrastructure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mic.com/articles/127354/butter-project-streaming-service-and-the-latest-on-popcorn-time-shutdown#.CPCh1d0yE|title=Butter Project Streaming Service and the Latest On Popcorn Time Shutdown|last=Mic|website=Mic|access-date=2018-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Butter Project is not aimed at allowing copyright infringement, but aims to build the groundworks for streaming video over BitTorrent.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://thenextweb.com/apps/2015/10/23/popcorn-time-creators-back-away-from-copyrighted-content-with-project-butter/|title=Popcorn Time creators back away from copyrighted content with 'Project Butter'|last=Williams|first=Owen|website=The Next Web|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; By having a legal portion which remains on [[GitHub]] the creators hope they can get more developers involved.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''Carl Barus''' (February 19, 1856 – September 20, 1935) was an American physicist and the maternal great-uncle of the American novelist Kurt Vonnegut. 

Barus was born in [[Cincinnati]], [[United States]]. The son of German immigrants (the musician Carl Barus, Sr. and Sophia, ''nee'' Möllmann) graduated from [[Woodward High School (Cincinnati, Ohio)|Woodward High School]], together with [[William Howard Taft]], in 1874.

After studying [[mining engineering]] for two years, he moved to [[Würzburg]], [[Germany]], where he studied physics under [[Friedrich Kohlrausch (physicist)|Friedrich Kohlrausch]], and graduated ''summa cum laude'' in 1879.

Barus married Annie Gertrude Howes on January 20, 1887. They had two children, Maxwell and Deborah. In the [[United States]] in 1892, he was a member of the [[American Philosophical Society]], and the youngest of all members to [[National Academy of Sciences]].

In 1903 he was appointed as a dean of the [[Brown University]] Graduate Department, which he was controlling from his office in [[Wilson Hall (Brown University)|Wilson Hall]]. He remained the dean of the graduate school until his retirement in 1926. By that time, the department had grown large enough to become a school within the university which has been attributed to his many contributions. In 1905 he was a corresponding member of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]{{clarify|date=April 2012}} and the same year became a member of the [[First International Congress of Radiology and Electricity]] at [[Brussels]]. The same year, he became a member of the [[Physikalisch-Medizinische Sozietät]] at [[Erlangen]]. Also, the same year he became the fourth president of [[American Physical Society]], and in 1906, became a member on the advisory board of physics, at the [[Carnegie Institution]] of [[Washington (state)|Washington]] state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.brown.edu/Administration/News_Bureau/Databases/Encyclopedia/search.php?serial=B0070 Biography]&lt;/ref&gt;

Barus died in [[Providence, Rhode Island|Providence]], [[Rhode Island]], [[United States]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18700">'''Coherentism''' is the name given to a few philosophical theories in modern [[epistemology]].

There are two distinct types of coherentism. One is the [[coherence theory of truth]];&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-coherence/ The Coherence Theory of Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; the other, the '''coherence [[theory of justification]]'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref name=SEP-CTJ&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justep-coherence/ Coherentist Theories of Epistemic Justification (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; (also known as '''epistemic coherentism''').&lt;ref&gt;Paul K. Moser (1986), "Epistemic Coherentism and the Isolation Objection", ''Grazer Philosophische Studien'' 27:83–99.&lt;/ref&gt; Coherent [[truth]] is divided between an anthropological approach, which applies only to localized networks ('true within a given sample of a population, given our understanding of the population'), and an approach that is judged on the basis of universals, such as categorical sets.  The anthropological approach belongs more properly to the [[correspondence theory of truth]], while the universal theories are a small development within [[analytic philosophy]]. The coherentist theory of justification, which may be interpreted as relating to either theory of coherent truth, characterizes [[epistemic justification]] as a property of a belief only if that belief is a member of a coherent set. What distinguishes coherentism from other theories of justification is that the set is the primary bearer of justification.&lt;ref&gt;Klein, P. D. (2007). Human Knowledge and the Infinite Progress of Reasoning. Philosophical Studies, 134 (1), 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  As an [[epistemological]] [[theory]], coherentism opposes dogmatic [[foundationalism]] and also [[infinitism]] through its insistence on definitions. It also attempts to offer a solution to the [[regress argument]] that plagues correspondence theory. In an epistemological sense, it is a theory about how [[belief]] can be proof-theoretically [[theory of justification|justified]].

Coherentism is a view about the structure and system of knowledge, or else justified belief. The coherentist's thesis is normally formulated in terms of a denial of its contrary, such as dogmatic foundationalism, which lacks a proof-theoretical framework, or correspondence theory, which lacks universalism. [[Counterfactualism]], through a vocabulary developed by [[David K. Lewis]] and his [[many worlds theory]]&lt;ref&gt;Lewis, David K. Counterfactuals. Wiley-Blackwell, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; although popular with philosophers, has had the effect of creating wide disbelief of universals amongst academics. Many difficulties lie in between hypothetical coherence and its effective actualization. Coherentism claims, at a minimum, that not all knowledge ''and'' justified belief rest ultimately on a foundation of noninferential knowledge ''or'' justified belief. To defend this view, they may argue that conjunctions (''and'') are more specific, and thus in some way more defensible, than disjunctions (''or'').

After responding to foundationalism, coherentists normally characterize their view positively by replacing the foundationalism metaphor of a building as a model for the structure of knowledge with different metaphors, such as the metaphor that models our knowledge on a ship at sea whose seaworthiness must be ensured by repairs to any part in need of it. This metaphor fulfills the purpose of explaining the problem of incoherence, which was first raised in mathematics. Coherentists typically hold that justification is solely a function of some relationship between beliefs, none of which are privileged beliefs in the way maintained by dogmatic foundationalists. In this way universal truths are in closer reach. Different varieties of coherentism are individuated by the specific relationship between a system of knowledge and justified belief, which can be interpreted in terms of [[predicate logic]], or ideally, [[proof theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Ángel Garrido, Urszula Wybraniec-Skardowska (eds.), ''The Lvov-Warsaw School. Past and Present'', Birkhäuser, 2018, p. 510.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definition==
As a theory of truth, coherentism restricts ''true'' sentences to those that cohere with some specified set of sentences. Someone's belief is true if and only if it is ''coherent'' with all or most of his or her other (true) beliefs. The terminology of coherence is then said to correlate with truth via some concept of what qualifies all truth, such as absoluteness or universalism. These further terms become the qualifiers of what is meant by a truth statement, and the truth-statements then decide what is meant by a true belief. Usually, coherence is taken to imply something stronger than mere consistency. Statements that are comprehensive and meet the requirements of [[Occam's razor]] are usually to be preferred.

As an illustration of the principle, if people lived in a [[virtual reality]] universe, they could see birds in the trees that aren't really there. Not only are the birds not really there, but the trees aren't really there either. The people may or may not ''know'' that the bird and the tree are there, but in either case there is a coherence between the virtual world and the real one, expressed in terms of true beliefs within available experience. ''Coherence'' is a way of explicating truth values while circumventing beliefs that might be false in any way. More traditional critics from the [[correspondence theory of truth]] have said that it cannot have contents and proofs at the same time, unless the contents are infinite, or unless the contents somehow exist in the form of proof. Such a form of 'existing proof' might seem ridiculous, but coherentists tend to think it is non-problematic. It therefore falls into a group of theories that are sometimes deemed excessively generalistic, what Gabor Forrai calls 'blob realism'.&lt;ref&gt;Forrai, G. Reference, Truth, and Conceptual Schemes. Synthese Library.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Perhaps the best-known objection to a coherence theory of truth is [[Bertrand Russell]]'s argument concerning contradiction. Russell maintained that a belief and its [[negation]] will each separately cohere with one complete set of all beliefs, thus making it internally inconsistent. For example, if someone holds a belief that is false, how might we determine whether the belief refers to something real although it is false, or whether instead the right belief is true although it is not believed? Coherence must thus rely on a theory that is either non-contradictory or accepts some limited degree of incoherence, such as [[relativism]] or [[paradox]]. Additional necessary criteria for coherence may include universalism or absoluteness, suggesting that the theory remains anthropological or incoherent when it does not use the concept of infinity. A coherentist might argue that this scenario applies regardless of the theories being considered, and so, that coherentism must be the preferred truth-theoretical framework in avoiding relativism.

==History==
In [[modern philosophy]], the coherence theory of truth was defended by [[Baruch Spinoza]],&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT/&gt; [[Immanuel Kant]],&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT/&gt; [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]],&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT/&gt; [[Karl Wilhelm Friedrich Schlegel]],&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Millan, ''Friedrich Schlegel and the Emergence of Romantic Philosophy'', SUNY Press, 2012, p. 49.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT/&gt; and [[Harold Joachim|Harold Henry Joachim]] (who is credited with the definitive formulation of the theory).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/joachim/ Harold Henry Joachim (1868—1938) (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; (However, Spinoza and Kant have also been interpreted as defenders of the correspondence theory of truth.)&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/truth-correspondence/ The Correspondence Theory of Truth (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], several epistemologists have significantly contributed to and defended the theory, primarily [[Brand Blanshard]] (who gave the earliest characterization of the theory in contemporary times) and [[Nicholas Rescher]].&lt;ref name=SEP-CTT/&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], epistemic coherentist views were held by Schlegel&lt;ref&gt;Asko Nivala, ''The Romantic Idea of the Golden Age in Friedrich Schlegel's Philosophy of History'', Routledge, 2017, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt; and Hegel,&lt;ref&gt;James Kreines, ''Reason in the World: Hegel's Metaphysics and Its Philosophical Appeal'', Oxford University Press, 2015, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; but the definitive formulation of the coherence theory of justification was provided by [[F. H. Bradley]] in his book ''The Principles of Logic'' (1883).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/coherent/ Coherentism in Epistemology (Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt; In contemporary philosophy, several epistemologists have significantly contributed to epistemic coherentism, primarily [[A. C. Ewing]] (who gave the earliest characterization of the theory in contemporary times), [[Brand Blanshard]], [[C. I. Lewis]], [[Nicholas Rescher]], [[Laurence BonJour]], [[Keith Lehrer]], and [[Paul Thagard]].&lt;ref name=SEP-CTJ/&gt; [[Otto Neurath]] is also sometimes thought to be an epistemic coherentist.&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/neurath/ Otto Neurath (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==The regress argument==
Both coherence and foundationalist theories of ''justification'' attempt to answer the [[regress argument]], a fundamental problem in epistemology that goes as follows. Given some statement P, it appears reasonable to ask for a justification for P. If that justification takes the form of another statement, P', one can again reasonably ask for a justification for P', and so forth. There are three possible outcomes to this questioning process:
# the series is infinitely long, with every statement justified by some other statement.
# the series forms a loop, so that each statement is ultimately involved in its own justification.
# the series terminates with certain statements having to be self-justifying.

An infinite series appears to offer little help, unless a way is found to model infinite sets. This might entail additional assumptions. Otherwise, it is impossible to check that each justification is satisfactory without making broad generalizations.

Coherentism is sometimes characterized as accepting that the series forms a loop, but although this would produce a form of coherentism, this is not what is generally meant by the term. Those who do accept the loop theory sometimes argue that the body of assumptions used to prove the theory is not what is at question in considering a loop of premises. This would serve the typical purpose of circumventing the reliance on a regression, but might be considered a form of logical foundationalism. But otherwise, it must be assumed that a loop [[begging the question|begs the question]], meaning that it does not provide sufficient logic to constitute proof.

===Foundationalism's response===
One might conclude that there must be some statements that, for some reason, do not need justification. This view is called [[foundationalism]]. For instance, [[rationalist]]s such as [[René Descartes|Descartes]] and [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] developed [[axiomatic system]]s that relied on statements that were taken to be self-evident: "[[I think therefore I am]]" is the most famous example. Similarly, [[empiricist]]s take observations as providing the foundation for the series.

Foundationalism relies on the claim that it is not necessary to ask for justification of certain propositions, or that they are self-justifying. Coherentists argue that this position is overly dogmatic. In other words, it does not provide real criteria for determining what is true and what is not. The Coherentist analytic project then involves a process of justifying what is meant by adequate criteria for non-dogmatic truth. As an offshoot of this, the theory insists that it is ''always'' reasonable to ask for a justification for ''any'' statement. For example, if someone makes an observational statement, such as "it is raining", the coherentist contends that it is reasonable to ask for example whether this mere statement refers to anything real. What is real about the statement, it turns out, is the extended pattern of relations that we call justifications. But, unlike the relativist, the coherentist argues that these associations may be objectively real. Coherentism contends that dogmatic foundationalism does not provide the whole set of pure relations that might result in actually understanding the objective context of phenomena, because dogmatic assumptions are not proof-theoretic, and therefore remain incoherent or relativistic. Coherentists therefore argue that the only way to reach proof-theoretic truth that is not relativistic is through coherency.

===Coherentism's response===
Coherentism denies the soundness of the regression argument. The regression argument makes the assumption that the justification for a proposition takes the form of another proposition: P" justifies P', which in turn justifies P. For coherentism, justification is a [[holistic]] process. Inferential justification for the belief that P is nonlinear. This means that P" and P' are not epistemically prior to P. Rather, the beliefs that P", P', and P work together to achieve epistemic justification. [[Catherine Elgin]] has expressed the same point differently, arguing that beliefs must be "mutually consistent, cotenable, and supportive. That is, the components must be reasonable in light of one another. Since both cotenability and supportiveness are matters of degree, coherence is too."&lt;ref&gt;Elgin, Catherine Z. (2005.) "Non-foundationalist Epistemology: Holism, Coherence, and Tenability." In Matthias Steup and Ernest Sosa. (Eds.) Contemporary Debates in Epistemology. Malden: Blackwell Publishing, 156 – 167.&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the system of belief is taken to be the complete set of beliefs of the individual or group, that is, their theory of the world.

It is necessary for coherentism to explain in some detail what it means for a system to be coherent. At the least, coherence must include logical consistency. It also usually requires some degree of integration of the various components of the system. A system that contains more than one unrelated explanation of the same phenomenon is not as coherent as one that uses only one explanation, all other things being equal. Conversely, a theory that explains divergent phenomena using unrelated explanations is not as coherent as one that uses only one explanation for those divergent phenomena. These requirements are variations on [[Occam's razor]]. The same points can be made more formally using [[Bayesian statistics]]. Finally, the greater the number of phenomena explained by the system, the greater its coherence.

===Problems for coherentism===
A problem coherentism has to face is the ''plurality objection''. There is nothing within the definition of coherence that makes it impossible for two entirely different sets of beliefs to be internally coherent. Thus there might be several such sets. But if one supposes—in line with the [[principle of non-contradiction]]—that there can only be ''one'' complete set of truths, coherentism must therefore resolve internally that these systems are not contradictory, by establishing what is meant by truth. At this point, Coherence could be faulted for adopting its own variation of dogmatic foundationalism by arbitrarily selecting truth values. Coherentists must argue that their truth-values are not arbitrary for provable reasons.

A second objection also emerges, the ''finite problem'': that arbitrary, ad hoc relativism could reduce statements of relatively insignificant value to non-entities during the process of establishing universalism or absoluteness. This might result in a totally flat truth-theoretic framework, or even arbitrary truth values. Coherentists generally solve this by adopting a metaphysical condition of universalism, sometimes leading to [[materialism]], or by arguing that [[relativism]] is trivial.

However, [[metaphysics]] poses another problem, the problem of the stowaway argument that might carry epistemological implications. However, a coherentist might say that if the truth conditions of the logic hold, then there will be no problem regardless of any additional conditions that happen to be true. Thus, the stress is on making the theory valid within the set, and also verifiable.

A number of philosophers have raised concerns over the link between intuitive notions of coherence that form the foundation of epistemic forms of coherentism and some formal results in [[Bayesian probability]]. This is an issue raised by Luc Bovens and Stephen Hartmann in the form of 'impossibility' results,&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|publisher = Clarendon|isbn = 0-19-926975-0|publication-place = Oxford|title = Bayesian epistemology|url = http://openlibrary.org/books/OL15554525M/Bayesian_epistemology|author = Luc Bovens|publication-date = 2003|oclc = 53393352|id = 0199269750}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by Erik J.

'''''Contra errores Graecorum''', ad Urbanum IV Pontificem Maximum'' (''Against the Errors of the Greeks, to [[Pope Urban IV]]'') is a short treatise (an "opusculum") written in 1263 by [[Roman Catholic]] theologian Saint [[Thomas Aquinas]] as a contribution to Pope Urban's efforts at reunion with the [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BWtarhaGxPUC&amp;pg=PA167&amp;dq=Aquinas+%22errores+graecorum%22&amp;lr= Aidan Nichols, Discovering Aquinas: An Introduction to His Life, Work, and Influence] (Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003 {{ISBN|0-8028-0514-0}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8028-0514-0}}), p. 167&lt;/ref&gt;  Aquinas wrote the treatise in 1263 while he was papal theologian and conventual lector in the Dominican ''studium'' at [[Orvieto]] after his first regency as professor of theology at the [[University of Paris]] which ended in 1259 and before he took up his duties in 1265 reforming the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] ''studium'' at [[Santa Sabina]], the forerunner of the [[Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas|Pontifical University of Saint Thomas Aquinas, ''Angelicum'']], in Rome.

==Text==

The title of the treatise was not given by Aquinas himself, and it contains nothing that is directed against the doctrine of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]], but only, in the view of theologian [[Yves Congar]], a defence of Catholic doctrine against Eastern misunderstandings.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=CxucHPqvy5cC&amp;pg=PA88&amp;dq=Aquinas+%22errores+graecorum%22&amp;lr=#PPA88,M1 Gabriel Flynn, Yves Congar: theologian of the church] (Peeters Publishers, 2005 {{ISBN|90-429-1668-0}}, {{ISBN|978-90-429-1668-5}}), p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

The 72 chapters of the work are each of the length of a paragraph in a modern book. In it Aquinas presents the teaching of the Greek Church Fathers as in harmony with that of the [[Latin Church]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=81vCJkNCb8kC&amp;pg=PP1&amp;dq=Davies+Aquinas#PPA5,M1 Brian Davies, Aquinas: an introduction] (Continuum International Publishing Group, 2004 {{ISBN|0-8264-7095-5}}, {{ISBN|978-0-8264-7095-9}}), p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; The book is arranged in two parts, the first of 32 chapters and the second of 40, each part preceded by a prologue, and the work as a whole concluded with an epilogue. All the first part and 31 of the 40 chapters of the second concern [[Pneumatology (Christianity)|pneumatology]] (doctrine on the [[Holy Spirit]]). Of the final 9 chapters, 7 deal with the position of the [[Pope|Roman Pontiff]], and the last two with the use of leavened bread in the [[Eucharist]] and with [[purgatory]]. In all of these Aquinas quoted expressions by Fathers of the Greek Church in support of the teaching propounded by the Latin Church.

Aquinas died on his way to participate in the 1274 [[Second Council of Lyons]], to which he had been invited, but this treatise, which he had written eleven years before and not for the use of this Council,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=_6PYWPWWhrUC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=Aquinas+%22errores+graecorum%22&amp;lr= Deno John Geanakoplos, Constantinople and the West: essays on the late Byzantine (Palaeologan) and Italian Renaissances and the Byzantine and Roman churches](Univ of Wisconsin Press, 1989 {{ISBN|0-299-11884-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-299-11884-6}}), p. 196]&lt;/ref&gt; was influential at the Council.

==Contents==

The titles of the first ten chapters given in the latter translation indicate something of the contents of the short work:
# How it should be understood when it is said that the Son comes from the Father as an effect from a cause (Quomodo intelligitur hoc quod dicitur quod filius habet a patre sicut causatum a causa).
# How it should be understood when it is said that the Son is second, after the Father, and the Holy Spirit is third (Quomodo intelligitur cum dicitur, quod filius sit secundus a patre, et spiritus sanctus sit tertius).
# How it should be understood when it is said that the Holy Spirit is the third light (Quomodo intelligitur hoc quod spiritus sanctus sit tertium lumen).
# How it should be understood when it is said that essence is begotten in the Son, and spirated in the Holy Spirit (Quomodo intelligitur, quod essentia sit genita in filio, et spirata in spiritu sancto).
# How it should be understood when it is said that Jesus is the Son of the Father's essence (Quomodo intelligitur quod Iesus dicitur filius paternae essentiae).
# How it should be understood when it is said that what naturally belongs to the Father, naturally belongs to the Son (Quomodo intelligitur, quod quae sunt propria naturaliter patris, sunt propria filii).
# How it should be understood when it is said that the perfection of the Father does not lack anything from either the Son or the Holy Spirit (Quomodo intelligitur quod pater neque filio neque spiritu sancto indiget ad sui perfectionem).
# How it should be understood when the Holy Spirit is called unbegotten (Quomodo intelligitur quod spiritus sanctus dicatur ingenitus).
# How it should be understood when the Holy Spirit is said to be the middle between the Father and the Son (Quomodo intelligitur quod spiritus sanctus dicitur medius patris et filii).
# How it should be understood when it is said that the Holy Spirit is the image of the Son (Quomodo intelligitur hoc quod dicitur, quod spiritus sanctus sit imago filii).

In his treatise, Aquinas "demonstrated that there was a theological harmony between the Greek Church Fathers and the Latin Church".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=f_jLbHTM_zgC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;vq=contra+errores+graecorum&amp;source=gbs_search_r&amp;cad=1_1 Jana K. Schulman, The rise of the medieval world, 500-1300: a biographical dictionary] (Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002 {{ISBN|0-313-30817-9}}, {{ISBN|978-0-313-30817-8}})&lt;/ref&gt; He pointed out that one source of misunderstandings between Greeks and Latins was the difficulty of finding appropriate words in each language` with which to translate technical theological terms used in the other:
:''Many things which sound well enough in [[Greek language|Greek]] do not perhaps, sound well in [[Latin]]. Hence, Latins and Greeks professing the same faith do so using different words. For among the Greeks it is said, correctly, and in a Catholic way, that the Father, Son and Holy Spirit are three ''hypostases''. But with the Latins it does not sound right to say that there are three ''substantiae'', even though on a purely verbal basis the term ''hypostasis'' in Greek means the same as the term ''substantia'' in Latin. The fact is, ''substantia'' in Latin is more frequently used to signify essence. And both we and the Greeks hold that in God there is but one essence. So where the Greeks speak of three ''hypostases'', we Latins speak of three ''personae'', as Augustine in the seventh book on the Trinity also teaches. And, doubtless, there are many similar instances.''
:''It is, therefore, the task of the good translator, when translating material dealing with the Catholic faith, to preserve the meaning, but to adapt the mode of expression so that it is in harmony with the idiom of the language into which he is translating. For obviously, when anything spoken in a literary fashion in Latin is explained in common parlance, the explanation will be inept if it is simply word for word. All the more so, when anything expressed in one language is translated merely word for word into another, it will be no surprise if perplexity concerning the meaning of the original sometimes occurs.''&lt;ref&gt;Prologue to ''Contra Errores Graecorum''&lt;/ref&gt;

==The problem of the sources==

The apologetic impact of the work is limited, due to the fact that Thomas uses a collection of texts compilled by [[Nicholas of Crotone]] which contains doubtful attributions and personal glosses of the compiller that bent the text in direction of the Latin theology. According to Jean-Pierre Torell, "on four specific questions concerning the procession ''a filio'', the primacy of the pope, the Eucharistic celebration with unleavened bread, and purgatory, Thomas is clearly forced to rely more on the texts that are closer to Latin theology, when these are in fact glosses foreign to the Fathers."&lt;ref&gt;Saint Thomas Aquinas: the person and his work, Volume 1, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt;

'''d3web''' is a free, open-source platform for [[knowledge-based systems]] ([[expert systems]]).
Its core is written in [[Java (software platform)|Java]] using [[XML]] and/or Office-based formats for the knowledge storage.
All of its components are distributed under the terms of the Lesser General Public Licence ([[LGPL]]).

The d3web diagnostic core implements reasoning and persistence components for  problem-solving knowledge including [[decision trees]], [[Production system (computer science)|(heuristic) rules]], set-covering models and diagnostic flowcharts. The software can be integrated into foreign applications (embedded or OEM), but a number of off-the-shelf components already exist.

==Components==
d3web is a component-based software platform providing applications for authoring and using/executing problem-solving knowledge.
The following applications are primarily using d3web:

* KnowWE (Knowledge Wiki Environment): A semantic wiki building on JSPWiki. Problem-solving knowledge can be authored and executed through the wiki interface. Developed knowledge bases can be exported to be used in OEM or embedded reasoners. Additionally, knowledge exchange via [[Web Ontology Language|OWL]] ontologies is provided.
* KnowME (Knowledge Modelling Environment): A rich-client application for the development of d3web knowledge bases. Problem-solving knowledge can be authored and executed within the desktop application. Developed knowledge bases can be used in OEM or embedded reasoners. The software KnowME is no longer under active development. It is replaced by the KnowWE component (see above).
* Dialog2: A web-based application for demonstrating the capabilities of the d3web core reasoner. The web servlet is based on [[Java Server Faces]]. It can be used out of box or as a starting point for own developments for building knowledge-based interview systems.

==Application Domains==
A number of industrial and academic projects already used or are currently using the d3web platform.

The main application domains are:
* medical diagnosis, documentation, and therapy:
* technical fault diagnosis
* monitoring of technical devices.

Some applications (both, commercial and free) created using the d3web diagnostic engine:
* [http://www.draeger.com/GC/en/campaigns/ventilation_xl/smartcare/index.jsp SmartCare™]: a medical closed-loop system for weaning ventilated patients, created by Dräger&lt;ref name="mein09"&gt;{{cite web |author=Gritje Meinke|title=Analyse von Anomalien in der graphischen Modellierung von diagnostischem Wissen|date=2011-06-22|url=http://www.wi.hs-wismar.de/~cleve/vorl/projects/da/Master-Meinke.pdf|format=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [http://www.medicoconsult.de/wiki/SonoConsult SonoConsult]: a medical support system for evaluating sonographic examinations (German only)
* [http://www.krank-gesund.de/infos/eDOC eDOC]: a web-based system for self-diagnosing various medical issues (German only)

==History==
The development of d3web originates from the research work of Prof. Dr. Frank Puppe (University Würzburg, Germany) going back to the 1980s, starting with the medical expert systems MED1&lt;ref name="pupp83"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frank Puppe|author2=Bernhard Puppe|title=Overview on MED1: A Heuristic Diagnostics System with an Efficient Control-Structure|journal=Gwai 1983|year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MED2&lt;ref name="pupp85"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frank Puppe|author2=Bernhard Puppe|title=How Domain Characteristics Induce Expert System Features|journal=Gwai 1985|year=1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.
Whereas the original systems were focussed on medical diagnosis the applicability of the approach was generalized by the successor D3&lt;ref name="pupp96"&gt;{{cite book |author=Frank Puppe|title=Wissensbasierte Diagnose- und Informationssysteme|publisher=Springer |location=Berlin, Germany |year=1996|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;
.&lt;ref name="pupp98"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frank Puppe|title=Knowledge reuse among diagnostic problem-solving methods in the Shell-Kit D3|publisher=Elsevier|journal=Int. J. Hum.-Comput. Stud.|volume=49|issue=4|year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the predecessors were implemented in the LISP programming language, d3web&lt;ref name="baum04"&gt;{{cite book |author=Joachim Baumeister|title=Agile Development of Diagnostic Knowledge Systems|publisher=IOS Press |location=Berlin|year=2004 |isbn=1-58603-463-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a full Java re-implementation.

'''Education in Japan''' is compulsory at the elementary and lower secondary levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://fpcj.jp/modules/news22/index.php?page=article&amp;storyid=18&amp;topicid=1 |title=Foreign Press Club of Japan Fact Book |publisher=Fpcj.jp |date= |accessdate=2013-01-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616132127/http://fpcj.jp/modules/news22/index.php?page=article&amp;storyid=18&amp;topicid=1 |archivedate=2013-06-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most students attend public schools through the lower secondary level, but [[private education]] is popular at the upper secondary and university levels.

Education prior to elementary school is provided at [[kindergarten]]s and [[Day care|day-care]] centers. Public and private day-care centers take children from under age 1 on up to 5 years old. The programmes for those children aged 3–5 resemble those at kindergartens. The educational approach at kindergartens varies greatly from unstructured environments that emphasize play to highly structured environments that are focused on having the child pass the entrance exam at a private elementary school. The academic year starts from April and ends in March, having summer vacation in August and winter vacation in the end of December to the beginning of January. Also, there are few days of holidays between academic years. The period of academic year is the same all through elementary level to higher educations nationwide.

Japanese students consistently rank highly among OECD students in terms of quality and performance in reading literacy, math, and sciences. The average student scored 540 in reading literacy, maths and science in the OECD’s Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) and the country has one of the world's highest-educated labour forces among OECD countries.&lt;ref name="Education OECD Better Life"/&gt; Its populace is well educated and its society highly values education as a platform for social mobility and for gaining employment in the country's high-tech economy. The country's large pool of highly educated and skilled individuals is largely responsible for ushering Japan’s post-war [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|economic growth]]. Tertiary-educated adults in Japan, particularly graduates in sciences and engineering, benefit economically and socially from their education and skills in the country's high tech economy.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.oecd.org/edu/Japan-EAG2014-Country-Note.pdf | title=Japan | publisher=OECD | accessdate=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spending on education as a proportion of GDP is below the OECD average. Although expenditure per student is comparatively high in Japan, total expenditure relative to GDP remains small.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; In 2015, Japan’s public spending on education amounted to just 3.5 percent of its GDP, below the [[OECD]] average of 4.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/25/national/public-education-spending-japan-lowest-oecd-sixth-straight-year/#.WBQMCxM5p88 | title=Public education spending in Japan lowest in OECD for sixth straight year | publisher=The Japan Times | accessdate=28 October 2016 | author=Tomoko Otake}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the country ranked fourth for the percentage of 25- to 64-year-olds that have attained tertiary education with 48 percent. In addition, bachelor's degrees are held by 59 percent of Japanese aged 25–34, the second most in the OECD after South Korea.&lt;ref name="OECD"/&gt; As the Japanese economy is largely scientific and technological based, the labor market demands people who have achieved some form of higher education, particularly related to science and engineering in order to gain a competitive edge when searching for employment opportunities. About 75.9 percent of high school graduates attended a university, junior college, trade school, or other [[Higher education in Japan|higher education]] institution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/05101901/005.pdf |title=School Education |publisher=[[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology (Japan)|MEXT]] |accessdate=March 2, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102112620/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/05101901/005.pdf |archivedate=January 2, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japan's education system played a central part in Japan's recovery and [[Japanese post-war economic miracle|rapid economic growth]] in the decades following the end of [[World War II]]. After World War II, the [[Fundamental Law of Education]] and the School Education Law were enacted. The latter law defined the school system that would be in effect for many decades: six years of [[Primary education|elementary school]], three years of [[Middle school|junior high school]], three years of high school, and two or four years of university.
Although Japan ranks highly on the [[Programme for International Student Assessment|PISA]] tests, its educational system has been criticized for its focus on standardized testing and conformity;&lt;ref name="CNN"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/the-limits-of-japanese-education-and-its-focus-on-cramming/?_r=0 |title=Bad Education |last=Harney |first=Alexandra |publisher=''The New York Times'' |date=January 24, 2013 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; bullying problems;&lt;ref name="CNN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/09/01/asia/japan-teen-suicides/ |title=Japan's worst day for teen suicides |last=Wright |first=Rebecca |publisher=CNN |date=September 1, 2015 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2013/11/japans-cutthroat-school-system-a-cautionary-tale-for-the-us/281612/ |title=Japan's Cutthroat School System: A Cautionary Tale for the U.S. |last=Berlatsky |first=Noah |publisher=''The Atlantic |date=November 22, 2013 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2016/05/06/interview-bullying-lgbt-kids-japans-schools |title=Interview: The Bullying of LGBT Kids in Japan's Schools |last=Braunschweiger |first=Army |publisher=Human Rights Watch |date=May 6, 2016 |accessdate=August 30, 2016}} "School bullying is notorious in Japan and has been for decades.

==History==
{{main|History of education in Japan}}
[[File:Terakoya for girls.jpg|thumb|right|[[Terakoya]] for girls in the [[Edo period]]]]

Formal education in Japan began with the adoption of [[Chinese culture]], in the 6th century. [[Buddhism in Japan|Buddhist]] and [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings as well as [[science]]s, [[Japanese calligraphy|calligraphy]], [[divination]] and [[Japanese literature|literature]] were taught at the courts of [[Asuka, Yamato|Asuka]], [[Nara, Nara|Nara]] and [[Kyoto|Heian]]. Scholar officials were chosen through an [[Imperial examination]] system. But contrary to China, the system never fully took hold and titles and posts at the court remained hereditary family possessions. The rise of the ''[[Samurai|bushi]]'', the military class, during the [[Kamakura period]] ended the influence of scholar officials, but Buddhist monasteries remained influential centers of learning.

In the [[Edo period]], the  [[Yushima Seidō]] in Edo was the chief educational institution of the state; and at its head was the ''Daigaku-no-kami'', a title which identified the leader of the Tokugawa training school for shogunate bureaucrats.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, Boyd. (1999). [https://books.google.com/books?id=JBqWbDmFsfEC&amp;pg=PA522&amp;dq= ''Encyclopedia of Historians and Historical Writing,'' Vol. 1, p. 522;] De Bary, William ''et al.'' (2005). [https://books.google.com/books?id=6wS_ijD6DSgC&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=  ''Sources of Japanese Tradition,'' Vol. 2, p. 69.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the [[Tokugawa shogunate]], the [[daimyō]] vied for power in the largely pacified country. Since their influence could not be raised through war, they competed on the economic field. Their warrior-turned-bureaucrat Samurai elite had to be educated not only in military strategy and the martial arts, but also agriculture and accounting. Likewise, the wealthy merchant class needed education for their daily business, and their wealth allowed them to be patrons of arts and science. But temple schools ([[terakoya]]) educated peasants too, and it is estimated that at the end of the Edo period 50% of the male and 20% of the female population possessed some degree of literacy. Even though contact with foreign countries was restricted, books from China and Europe were eagerly imported and [[Rangaku]] ("Dutch studies") became a popular area of scholarly interest.

There were facilities that were created to specifically educate samurai and their children to perpetuate morality and mindfulness of their class. These schools, hanko schools, were where scholars would bring together samurai to listen to lectures on Confucianism, military arts, and other subjects. Samurai would then attempt to teach villagers what they had learned, “proper guidance to the common people’s spirit and manners,” by posting flyers and creating handbooks &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Toyosawa|first=Noboru|date=1961|title=Adult Eduction in Japan in the Edo Period|doi=10.1177/074171366101200102|journal=Adult Education|volume=12|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Some Shogun and Daimyo were also interested in spreading education throughout their protected land with the target audience as adult commoners and children. Elementary education was imparted as well as writing and morality lessons. The Shirakawa Village School’s town bulletin explains the point of education for the commoners, “If not only the important people of the village but also the lesser people have continuous teaching from the appointed village schools, they will gain understanding” &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;. ‘Commoners’ would also form many communal gatherings to attempt and Englishmen themselves with the help of a scholar. To name one, [[Baigan Ishida]], who was a great orator and writer that reached the outcropping of the merchant class. There were [[Wakashu-gumi|wakashu]]-gumi, or youth groups, that consisted of young men ages fourteen to seventeen, who at these groups learned about ceremonies, cooperative living, language, manners, marriage, straw weaving, and world information, not to mention talking and singing. Japan was thriving with the want for enlightenment. One may say the need for more education is one of the reasons why the Tokugawa Shogunate failed in 1868. 

===Meiji Restoration===
After the [[Meiji Restoration]] of 1868, the methods and structures of Western learning were adopted as a means to make Japan a strong, modern nation. Students and even high-ranking government officials were sent abroad to study, such as the [[Iwakura mission]]. Foreign scholars, the so-called ''[[Foreign government advisors in Meiji Japan|o-yatoi gaikokujin]]'', were invited to teach at newly founded universities and military academies. Compulsory education was introduced, mainly after the [[Prussian education system|Prussian model]]. In order to aid in the modernization the country, the Meiji government built a public library in 1872 modeled after Western architecture. The Japan Library Association (or the JLA) was founded in 1892 to promote the library. However, public education became the main focus of the Meiji government before they could strengthen the library’s presence in 1899. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.kc.tsukuba.ac.jp/div-comm/pdf/Library_in_Japan.pdf|title=Public Libraries in Japan|last=Nagata|first=Haruki|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;By 1890, only 20 years after the resumption of full international relations, Japan discontinued employment of the foreign consultants.

A modern concept of childhood emerged in Japan after 1850 as part of its engagement with the West. Meiji period leaders decided the nation-state had the primary role in mobilizing individuals - and children - in service of the state. The Western-style school was introduced as the agent to reach that goal. By the 1890s, schools were generating new sensibilities regarding childhood.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Platt, "Japanese Childhood, Modern Childhood: The Nation-State, the School, and 19th-Century Globalization," '' Journal of Social History,'' Summer 2005, Vol. 38 Issue 4, pp 965-985&lt;/ref&gt;  After 1890 Japan had numerous reformers, child experts, magazine editors, and well-educated mothers who bought into the new sensibility. They taught the upper middle class a model of childhood that included children having their own space where they read children's books, played with educational toys and, especially, devoted enormous time to school homework. These ideas rapidly disseminated through all social classes.&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen S. Uno, ''Passages to Modernity: Motherhood, Childhood, and Social Reform in Early Twentieth Century Japan'' (1999)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mark Jones, ''Children as Treasures: Childhood and the Middle Class in Early Twentieth Century Japan'' (2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-WWII===
After the defeat in World War II, the [[Occupation of Japan|Allied occupation]] government set [[Educational reform in occupied Japan|education reform]] as one of its primary goals, to eradicate militarist teachings and convert Japan into a pacifist democracy. Nine years of education was made mandatory, with six years in elementary education and three in junior high as an emulation of the American educational system. A number of reforms were carried out in the post-war period that aimed at easing the burden of entrance examinations, promoting internationalization and information technologies, diversifying education and supporting lifelong learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Lessons from PISA for the United States |chapter=Japan: A Story of Sustained Excellence |chapter-url=https://www.oecd-ilibrary.org/education/lessons-from-pisa-for-the-united-states/japan-a-story-of-sustained-excellence_9789264096660-7-en  |date=2011-05-17|publisher=Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD)|pages=137–157|language=en|doi=10.1787/9789264096660-7-en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shimizutani|first=Satoshi|date=2011-11-01|title=Education Reform in Japan: A Course for Lifelong Learning|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/13439006.2011.630853|journal=Asia-Pacific Review|volume=18|issue=2|pages=105–114|doi=10.1080/13439006.2011.630853|issn=1343-9006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to ease Japanese postwar sentiments, any nationalistic, militaristic, authoritarian, or anti-American content was blackened from learning materials. This practice was known as ''suminuru'', and was used as the primary method of educational reform until newly fashioned texts, Kuni no ayumi (Footsteps of the Nation), Nihon rekishi (Japanese History), and Minshushugi (Democracy) were written by the Ministry of Education and Civil Information and Education Section.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.binghamton.edu/history/resources/journal-of-history/stephen-buono.html|title=Binghamton University - History Department: Resources: Journal of History|website=www.binghamton.edu|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Education is now known as the [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology]] (MEXT) and is responsible for educational administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/en/about/museumofmext/index.htm|title=MEXT : Museum of MEXT|website=www.mext.go.jp|language=en|access-date=2017-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In successive international assessment tests, Japan's fourth- and eighth-grade students have consistently ranked in the top five globally in both mathematics and science (see [[TIMSS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss03tables.asp?Quest=1&amp;Figure=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/TIMSS03Tables.asp?Quest=1&amp;Figure=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss03tables.asp?figure=5&amp;Quest=5|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2003: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/timss03tables.asp?figure=5&amp;Quest=6|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2007: Math|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table07_1.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2007: Science|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table07_3.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_2.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 4th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_4.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_3.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TIMSS 2011: 8th grade|url=http://nces.ed.gov/timss/table11_5.asp|website=TIMSS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite concerns that academic skills for Japanese students may have declined since the mid-1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Matsutani, Minoru, "[http://www.japantimes.co.jp/text/nn20120110i1.html Student count, knowledge sliding]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 10 January 2012, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's students showed a significant improvement in math and science scores in the 2011 TIMSS survey, compared to the 2007 scores.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Japanese students improve test scores in math, science|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2012/12/12/national/japanese-students-improve-test-scores-in-math-science/|website=Japan Times|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==School grades==
The school year in Japan begins in April and classes are held from Monday to either Friday or Saturday, depending on the school. The school year consists of two or three terms, which are separated by short holidays in spring and winter, and a six-week-long summer break.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2150.html |title=Japanese education system |publisher=Japan-guide.com |date=2002-06-09 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lower secondary school===
{{main|Secondary education in Japan}}
{{refimprove section|date=January 2014}}
{{TIMSSScores2007}}
[[File:Classroom2.jpg|thumb|A typical classroom in a Japanese junior high school]]

Lower secondary school covers grades seven through nine, with children typically aged twelve through fifteen. There are 3.5 million primary school students in Japan as of 2012, down from over 5.3 million in 1990.&lt;ref name=Statistics&gt;{{cite web|title=Education Statistics|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|website=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132525/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the number of junior high schools has remained relatively static, falling from 11,275 in 1990 to 10,699 in 2012. The number of junior high school teachers has also changed little, with 257,605 junior high school teachers in 1990, and 253,753 in 2012). Approximately 8% of junior high students attend a private junior high school (accounting for 7% of all junior high schools). Private schools are considerably more expensive: as of 2012, the average annual cost of private primary school attendance was ¥1,295,156 per student, roughly thrice the ¥450,340 cost for a public school.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.e-stat.go.jp/SG1/estat/List.do?bid=000001051862&amp;cycode=0|title=統計表一覧　政府統計の総合窓口　GL08020103|last=|first=|date=|publisher=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Japan's compulsory education ends at grade nine, but less than 2% drop out; 60% of students advanced to senior education as of 1960, increasing rapidly to over 90% by 1980, rising further each year until reaching 98.3% as of 2012.&lt;ref name="Education Statistics"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|title=MEXT : Statistics|date=|publisher=Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|access-date=|ref=Statistics|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402132525/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statistics/index.htm|archivedate=2015-04-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Teachers often major in their respective subjects, and more than 80% graduate from a four-year college. Classes are large, with an average of thirty-eight students per class, and each class is assigned a homeroom teacher, doubling as a counselor. Unlike kindergarten students, primary school students have different teachers for different subjects. However, the teacher changes rooms for each period, rather than the students.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

Instruction in primary schools is often in the form of lectures. Teachers also use other media, such as television and radio, and there is some laboratory work. By 1989 about 45% of all public primary schools had computers, including schools that used them only for administrative purposes. All course contents are specified in the Course of Study for Lower-Secondary Schools.  Some subjects, such as Japanese language and mathematics, are coordinated with the elementary curriculum. Others, such as foreign-language study, begin at this level, though from April 2011, English became a compulsory part of the elementary school curriculum.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} The junior school curriculum covers Japanese language, social studies, mathematics, science, music, fine arts, health, and physical education. All students are also exposed to industrial arts and homemaking. Moral education and special activities continue to receive attention. Most students also participate in one of a range of school clubs that occupy them until around 6 p.m. most weekdays (including weekends and often before school as well), as part of an effort to address juvenile delinquency.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

A growing number of primary school students also attend ''[[juku]]'', private extracurricular study schools, in the evenings and on weekends. A focus by students upon these other studies and the increasingly structured demands upon students' time have been criticized by teachers and in the media for contributing to a decline in classroom standards and student performance in recent years.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}

The ministry recognizes a need to improve the teaching of all foreign languages, especially English. To improve instruction in spoken English, the government invites many young native speakers of English to Japan to serve as assistants to school boards and prefectures under its [[JET Programme|Japan Exchange and Teaching Program]] (JET). Beginning with 848 participants in 1987, the program grew to a high of 6,273 participants in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/jet/participants.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070226053847/http://www.mofa.go.jp/j_info/visit/jet/participants.pdf |date=February 26, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The program was in a decline in recent years due to several factors, including shrinking local school budgets funding the program, as well as an increasing number of school boards hiring their foreign native speakers directly or through lower-paying, private agencies.  Today, the program is again growing due to English becoming a compulsory part of the elementary school curriculum in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/fl20060328zg.html |title=Times get tough for teachers |work=[[The Japan Times|The Japan Times Online]] |date=2006-03-28 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Upper secondary school===
[[File:Japanese high school classroom.jpg|thumb|A typical Japanese high school classroom]]
{{main|Secondary education in Japan}}
Though [[upper secondary school|upper-secondary school]] is not compulsory in Japan, 94% of all junior high school graduates enrolled as of 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/index.htm |title=STATISTICAL ABSTRACT 2006 edition |accessdate=2008-06-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617061845/http://www.mext.go.jp/english/statist/index.htm |archivedate=2008-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Private upper-secondary schools account for about 55% of all upper-secondary schools, and neither public nor private schools are free. The [[Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology|Ministry of Education]] estimated that annual family expenses for the education of a child in a public upper-secondary school were about ¥300,000 in the 1980s and that private upper-secondary schools were about twice as expensive.

The most common type of upper-secondary school has a full-time, general program that offered academic courses for students preparing for higher education as well as technical and vocational courses for students expecting to find employment after graduation. More than 70% of upper-secondary school students were enrolled in the general academic program in the late 1980s. A small number of schools offer part-time programs, evening courses, or correspondence education.

The first-year programs for students in both academic and commercial courses are similar. They include basic academic courses, such as [[Japanese language]], [[English language|English]], [[mathematics]], and [[science]]. In upper-secondary school, differences in ability are first publicly acknowledged, and course content and course selection are far more individualized in the second year. However, there is a core of academic material throughout all programs.

Vocational-technical programs includes several hundred specialized courses, such as information processing, navigation, fish farming, business, English, and ceramics. Business and industrial courses are the most popular, accounting for 72% of all students in full-time vocational programs in 1989.

Most upper-secondary teachers are university graduates. Upper-secondary schools are organized into departments, and teachers specialize in their major fields although they teach a variety of courses within their disciplines. Teaching depends largely on the lecture system, with the main goal of covering the very demanding curriculum in the time allotted. Approach and subject coverage tends to be uniform, at least in the public schools.

Training of disabled students, particularly at the upper-secondary level, emphasizes vocational education to enable students to be as independent as possible within society. Vocational training varies considerably depending on the student's disability, but the options are limited for some. It is clear that the government is aware of the necessity of broadening the range of possibilities for these students. Advancement to higher education is also a goal of the government, and it struggles to have institutions of higher learning accept more students with disabilities.

===Universities and colleges===
{{main|Higher education in Japan}}
Higher education in Japan is provided at universities (daigaku), junior colleges (tanki daigaku), colleges of technology (koto senmon gakko) and special training schools and community colleges (senshu gakko). Of these four types of institutions, only universities and junior colleges are strictly considered postsecondary education providers.&lt;ref name="Clark, Nick"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://wenr.wes.org/2005/05/wenr-mayjune-2005-education-in-japan | title=Education in Japan | date=1 May 2005 | accessdate=28 October 2016 | author=Clark, Nick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2010, more than 2.8 million students were enrolled in 778 universities. At the top of the higher education structure, these institutions provide a four-year training leading to a [[bachelor's degree]], and some offer six-year programs leading to a professional degree. There are two types of public four-year colleges: the 86 [[List of national universities in Japan|national universities]] (including the [[Open University of Japan]]) and the 95 local [[public university|public universities]], founded by [[prefecture]]s and [[municipality|municipalities]]. The 597 remaining four-year colleges in 2010 were private. With a wealth of opportunities for students wishing to pursue tertiary education, the nation’s prestigious schools are the most appealing for students seeking to gain top employment prospects.&lt;ref name="Clark, Nick"/&gt;

The overwhelming majority of college students attend full-time day programs. In 1990 the most popular courses, enrolling almost 40 percent of all undergraduate students, were in the [[social sciences]], including [[business]], [[law]], and [[accounting]]. Other popular subjects were [[engineering]] (19 percent), the [[humanities]] (15 percent), and [[education]] (7 percent).

The average costs (tuition, fees, and living expenses) for a year of higher education in 1986 were ¥1.4 million. To help defray expenses, students frequently work part-time or borrow money through the government-supported Japan Scholarship Association. Assistance is also offered by local governments, nonprofit corporations, and other institutions.

According to the ''[[Times Higher Education Supplement]]'' and [[École des Mines de Paris]], the top-ranking universities in Japan are the [[University of Tokyo]] and [[Kyoto University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.alnaja7.org/success/Education/times_world_ranking_2005.pdf |title=The Times Higher Education Supplement World University Rankings |date=2005-10-28 |publisher=TSL Education Ltd. |format=PDF |accessdate=2007-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060723181357/http://www.alnaja7.org/success/Education/times_world_ranking_2005.pdf |archivedate=2006-07-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mines-paristech.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.html  World University Rankings] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5qEQh0ndo?url=http://www.mines-paristech.fr/Actualites/PR/EMP-ranking.html |date=2010-06-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[QS World University Rankings|QS Asia University Rankings]] Top 40 included the [[University of Tokyo]] at 13th position,[[Tokyo Institute of Technology]] at 14th, [[Osaka University]] at 15th, [[Kyoto University]] at 17th, [[Tohoku University]] at 20th, [[Nagoya University]] at 27th, [[Kyushu University]] at 29th, [[Keio University]] at 36th, [[Waseda University]] at 39th, and the [[University of Tsukuba]] at 40th.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.topuniversities.com/university-rankings/asian-university-rankings/2018|title=Asian University Rankings 2018|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Topuniversities.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Based on the 2011 [[Times Higher Education–QS World University Rankings]], there are 33 Japanese universities in the top 100 Asian university rankings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantoday.com/category/national/view/japanese-universities-dominate-top-10-spots-in-asian-univ-rankings |title=China universities dominate top 10 spots in Asian univ rankings |publisher=Japantoday.com |date=2009-05-11 |accessdate=2013-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Extracurricular activities ==
The Japanese educational system is supplemented by a heavy emphasis on extracurricular activities, also known as [[Tutor|shadow education]], which are any educational activities that don't take place during formal schooling.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Yamamoto|first=Yoko|last2=Brinton|first2=Mary C.|date=2010-02-19|title=Cultural Capital in East Asian Educational Systems|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0038040709356567|journal=Sociology of Education|language=en|volume=83|issue=1|pages=67–83|doi=10.1177/0038040709356567}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is largely motivated by the extreme weight that is placed upon [[Higher education in Japan#Entrance|formal examinations]] as a prerequisite to attend university, something that is seen as integral to their future career and social status. In order to gain a competitive edge, Japanese families are willing to expend money and have their child put in time and effort into a supplementary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=ENTRICH|first=Steve R.|date=2015-07-01|title=The Decision for Shadow Education in Japan: Students’ Choice or Parents’ Pressure?|url=https://academic.oup.com/ssjj/article/18/2/193/1623097|journal=Social Science Japan Journal|language=en|volume=18|issue=2|pages=193–216|doi=10.1093/ssjj/jyv012|issn=1369-1465}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forms of shadow education include ''mogi shiken'', which are practice exams given by private companies that determine the child's chances of getting into a university. ''[[Juku]]'' are private after school classes that aim to develop abilities for students to excel in formal school curriculum or to prepare for university examinations. ''Ronin'' are students that undergo full-time preparation for university exams following high school due to their inability to get into their school of choice.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stevenson|first=David Lee|last2=Baker|first2=David P.|date=1992|title=Shadow Education and Allocation in Formal Schooling: Transition to University in Japan|jstor=2781551|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=97|issue=6|pages=1639–1657}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over 86% of students with college plans participate in at least one form of shadow education, with 60% participating in two or more.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Criticisms==
Japanese students are faced with immense pressure to succeed academically from their parents, teachers, peers and society. This is largely a result of a society that has long placed a great amount of importance on education, and a system that places all of its weight upon a single examination that has significant life-long consequences. This pressure has led to behaviors such as school violence, cheating, suicide, and significant psychological harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Japanese Education: Selective Bibliography of Psychosocial Aspects|last=Pike|first=Roberta|publisher=Jain Publishing Company|year=2007|isbn=9780895818690|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, students have experienced nervous breakdowns that have required hospitalization as young as twelve. In 1991, it was reported that 1,333 people in the age group of 15-24 had committed suicide, much of which was due to academic pressure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bossy|first=Steve|date=1996|title=Academic pressure and impact on Japanese students|url=http://digitool.Library.McGill.CA:80/R/-?func=dbin-jump-full&amp;object_id=35314&amp;silo_library=GEN01|journal=McGill Journal of Education|volume=35|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A survey by the Education Ministry showed that students at public schools were involved in a record number of [[school violence|violent incidents]] in 2007: 52,756 cases, an increase of some 8,000 on the previous year. In almost 7,000 of these incidents, teachers were the target of assault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/mail/ed20081202a1.html Getting children to get along.] (2008, December 2). ''The Japan Times'', Tokyo.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Japanese educational system has also been criticized for failure to foster independent thinkers with cultural and artistic sensibility. Japanese students that attend schools overseas often face difficulty adapting and competing in that environment due to lack of international viewpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bracey|first=Gerald|date=December 1997|title=The Japanese Education System is a Failure, Say Some Japanese|url=|journal=Phi Delta Kappan|volume=79|pages=328–330|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International education==
As of 2016, Japan has 30-40 international schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jcis.jp/member-schools/|title=» Member Schools Japan Council of International Schools|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many Kindergarten type schools that use the word "international" in their names but this is not an indicator that they are Japanese schools in the traditional sense. These types of kindergartens are usually immersion programs for Japanese students and the schools hire mostly foreigners to act as the main class "teacher" or as an assistant to the Japanese teacher.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}} [[United Nations University]] is located in Japan and [[Temple University]] has a branch campus in Japan. [[International University of Japan]] is an internationally top-ranked, fully English-taught University in Japan. [[Akita International University]] is also an English-taught University. [[Sophia University]]'s Faculty of Liberal Arts is fully taught in English. [[Tokyo University of Foreign Studies]] is a highly selective, specialist institution for [[International Studies]] and offers some languages that are rarely taught elsewhere in the world.

'''Edward Grant''' (born April 6, 1926) is an [[United States|American]] historian of [[Science in the Middle Ages|medieval science]]. He was named a Distinguished Professor in 1983. Other honors include the 1992 [[George Sarton Medal]], for "a lifetime scholarly achievement" as an historian of [[science]].&lt;ref name="grant"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20131104201029/http://www.indiana.edu/~alldrp/members/grant.html Academic page in Indiana University] (archived 4 November 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=medal&gt;{{Cite web|title=The Society: The George Sarton Medal |url=http://www.hssonline.org/about/society_sarton.html |accessdate=January 29, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100922075905/http://www.hssonline.org/about/society_sarton.html |archivedate=September 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Grant is [[Distinguished Professor]] [[Emeritus]], Department of [[History and Philosophy of Science]], [[Indiana University]], [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]]. Before arriving at Indiana University in the fall of 1959, Professor Grant taught at the [[University of Maine]] and in the [[history of science]] program at [[Harvard University]]. Professor Grant was twice chair of his department (1973–1979; 1987–1990) where he taught courses on [[medieval science]], [[natural philosophy]] and [[science and religion]].&lt;ref name=grant/&gt; He served as president of the [[History of Science Society]] from 1985-86.&lt;ref&gt;The History of Science Society [http://hssonline.org/about/governance/officers-and-committees/past-presidents "The Society: Past Presidents of the History of Science Society"], accessed 15 December 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

He has received many honors and awards, including the [[George Sarton Medal]] in 1992, the most prestigious award given by the [[History of Science Society]] that "recognizes those whose entire careers have been devoted to the field and whose scholarship is exceptional."&lt;ref name=grant/&gt;

==Work==
In his book ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages: Their Religious, Institutional and Intellectual Contexts'', Grant discusses the developments and discoveries that culminated in the [[Scientific Revolution]] of the 17th century. He emphasize how the roots of modern science were planted in the ancient and medieval worlds long before the modern period, and that the Christian Latin civilization of Western Europe began the last stage of its intellectual development. One basic factor is how [[Christianity]] developed in the West with the establishment of the [[Medieval university|medieval universities]] around 1200.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Foundations-Modern-Science-Middle-Ages/dp/0521567629&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''God and Reason in the Middle Ages'' he argues that the [[Middle Ages]] acquired an undeserved reputation as an age of superstition, barbarism, and unreason.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0521003377/bedeslibrary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Selected publications==
Edward Grant has published more than ninety articles and twelve books, including:
* ''Physical Science in the Middle Ages'' (1971)
* ''Much Ado About Nothing: Theories of Space and Vacuum from the Middle Ages to the Scientific Revolution'' (1981)
* ''Planets, Stars, &amp; Orbs: The Medieval Cosmos, 1200–1687'' (1994)
* ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages'' (1996)
* ''God and Reason in the Middle Ages'' (2001)

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="35668">'''Emotivism''' is a [[meta-ethics|meta-ethical]] view that claims that ethical [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentence]]s do not express [[proposition]]s but emotional attitudes.&lt;ref&gt;Garner and Rosen, ''Moral Philosophy'', chapter 13 ("Noncognitivist Theories") and Brandt, ''Ethical Theory'', chapter 9 ("Noncognitivism") regard the ethical theories of Ayer, Stevenson and Hare as noncognitivist ones.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ogden and Richards, ''Meaning'', 125: "'Good' is alleged to stand for a unique, unanalyzable concept … [which] is the subject matter of ethics. This peculiar ethical use of 'good' is, we suggest, a purely emotive use. … Thus, when we so use it in the sentence, &lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;''This'' is good,' we merely refer to ''this'', and the addition of "is good" makes no difference whatever to our reference … it serves only as an emotive sign expressing our attitude to ''this'', and perhaps evoking similar attitudes in other persons, or inciting them to actions of one kind or another." This quote appears in an extended form just before the preface of Stevenson's ''Ethics and Language''.&lt;/ref&gt; Hence, it is colloquially known as the '''hurrah/boo theory'''. Influenced by the growth of [[analytic philosophy]] and [[logical positivism]] in the 20th century, the theory was stated vividly by [[A. J. Ayer]] in his 1936 book ''[[Language, Truth and Logic]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Pepper, ''Ethics'', 277: "[Emotivism] was stated in its simplest and most striking form by A. J. Ayer."&lt;/ref&gt; but its development owes more to [[C. L. Stevenson]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, ''Ethical Theory'', 239, calls Stevenson's ''Ethics and Language'' "the most important statement of the emotive theory", and Pepper, ''Ethics'', 288, says it "was the first really systematic development of the [[value judgment]] theory and will probably go down in the history of ethics as the most representative for this school."&lt;/ref&gt;

Emotivism can be considered a form of [[non-cognitivism]] or [[expressivism]]. It stands in opposition to other forms of non-cognitivism (such as [[quasi-realism]] and [[universal prescriptivism]]), as well as to all forms of [[Cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivism]] (including both [[moral realism]] and [[ethical subjectivism]]).

In the 1950s, emotivism appeared in a modified form in the [[universal prescriptivism]] of [[R. M. Hare]].&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, ''Ethical Theory'', 221: "A recent book [''The Language of Morals''] by R. M. Hare has proposed a view, otherwise very similar to the emotive theory, with modifications …"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, ''Emotion'', 79: "… while Hare was, no doubt, a critic of the [emotive theory], he was, in the eyes of his own critics, a kind of emotivist himself. His theory, as a consequence, has sometimes been depicted as a reaction against emotivism and at other times as an extension of it."&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:David Hume.jpg|thumb|right|200px|[[David Hume]]'s statements on ethics foreshadowed those of 20th century emotivists.]]
Emotivism reached prominence in the early 20th century, but it was born centuries earlier. In 1710, [[George Berkeley]] wrote that language in general often serves to inspire feelings as well as communicate ideas.&lt;ref&gt;Berkeley, ''Treatise'', paragraph 20: "The communicating of Ideas marked by Words is not the chief and only end of Language, as is commonly supposed. There are other Ends, as the raising of some Passion, the exciting to, or deterring from an Action, the putting the Mind in some particular Disposition …"&lt;/ref&gt; Decades later, [[David Hume]] espoused ideas similar to Stevenson's later ones.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Ethics'', 273: "Of all traditional philosophers, Hume has most clearly asked the questions that here concern us, and has most nearly reached a conclusion that the present writer can accept."&lt;/ref&gt; In his 1751 book ''[[An Enquiry Concerning the Principles of Morals]]'', Hume considered morality to be related to fact but "determined by sentiment":

{{quote|In moral deliberations we must be acquainted beforehand with all the objects, and all their relations to each other; and from a comparison of the whole, fix our choice or approbation. … While we are ignorant whether a man were aggressor or not, how can we determine whether the person who killed him be criminal or innocent? But after every circumstance, every relation is known, the understanding has no further room to operate, nor any object on which it could employ itself. The approbation or blame which then ensues, cannot be the work of the judgement, but of the heart; and is not a speculative proposition or affirmation, but an active feeling or sentiment.&lt;ref&gt;Hume, ''Enquiry'', "Appendix I. Concerning moral sentiment"&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[G. E. Moore]] published his ''[[Principia Ethica]]'' in 1903 and argued that the attempts of [[ethical naturalism|ethical naturalists]] to translate ethical terms (like ''good'' and ''bad'') into non-ethical ones (like ''pleasing'' and ''displeasing'') committed the "[[naturalistic fallacy]]". Moore was a [[cognitivism (ethics)|cognitivist]], but his case against ethical naturalism steered other philosophers toward noncognitivism, particularly emotivism.&lt;ref&gt;Moore, ''Ethics'', x: "Although this critique [of ethical naturalism] had a powerful impact, the appeal of Moore's nonnaturalistic cognitivism was, by contrast, relatively weak. In the decades following ''Principia'', many philosophers who were persuaded by the former ended up abandoning cognitivism altogether in favor of the position that distinctively ethical discourse is not cognitive at all, but rather an expression of attitude or emotion."&lt;/ref&gt;

The emergence of [[logical positivism]] and its [[Verificationist|verifiability criterion of meaning]] early in the 20th century led some philosophers to conclude that ethical statements, being incapable of empirical verification, were cognitively meaningless. This criterion was fundamental to [[A.J. Ayer]]'s defense of positivism in ''Language, Truth and Logic'', which contains his statement of emotivism. However, positivism is not essential to emotivism itself, perhaps not even in Ayer's form,&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, ''Emotion'', 1: "… I do not take Ayer's ethical theory to hinge in any necessarily dependent sense upon his verificationist thesis … I take his ethical theory to hinge upon his verificationist thesis only to the extent that it assumes logic and empirical verification (and combinations thereof) to be the only means of firmly establishing the truth or falsity of any claim to knowledge."&lt;/ref&gt; and some positivists in the [[Vienna Circle]], which had great influence on Ayer, held non-emotivist views.&lt;ref&gt;Satris, ''Ethical Emotivism'', 23: "Utilitarian, rationalist and cognitivist positions are in fact maintained by the members of the Vienna Circle who wrote in the fields of ethics, [[social theory]] and [[value theory]], namely, [[Moritz Schlick]], [[Otto Neurath]], Viktor Kraft and [[Karl Menger]]."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[R. M. Hare]] unfolded his ethical theory of [[universal prescriptivism]] in 1952's ''The Language of Morals'', intending to defend the importance of rational moral argumentation against the "propaganda" he saw encouraged by Stevenson, who thought moral argumentation was sometimes psychological and not rational.&lt;ref&gt;Hare, ''Language'', 14–15: "The suggestion, that the function of moral judgments was to persuade, led to a difficulty in distinguishing their functions from that of propaganda. … It does not matter whether the means used to persuade are fair or foul, so long as they do persuade. And therefore the natural reaction to the realization that someone is trying to persuade us is 'He's trying to get at me; I must be on my guard …' Such a reaction to moral judgments should not be encouraged by philosophers." After Pepper, ''Ethics'', 297.&lt;/ref&gt; But Hare's disagreement was not universal, and the similarities between his noncognitive theory and the emotive one — especially his claim, and Stevenson's, that moral judgments contain commands and are thus not purely descriptive — caused some to regard him as an emotivist, a classification he denied:

{{quote|I did, and do, follow the emotivists in their rejection of descriptivism. But I was never an emotivist, though I have often been called one. But unlike most of their opponents I saw that it was their irrationalism, not their non-descriptivism, which was mistaken. So my main task was to find a rationalist kind of non-descriptivism, and this led me to establish that imperatives, the simplest kinds of prescriptions, could be subject to logical constraints while not [being] descriptive.&lt;ref&gt;Seanor et al., ''Hare and Critics'', 210. After Wilks, ''Emotion'', 79.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Proponents==
Influential statements of emotivism were made by [[C. K. Ogden]] and [[I. A. Richards]] in their 1923 book on language, ''[[The Meaning of Meaning]]'', and by [[W. H. F. Barnes]] and [[A. Duncan-Jones]] in independent works on ethics in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Urmson, ''Emotive Theory'', 15: "The earliest statement of the emotive [[value theory|theory of value]] terms in the modern ''British-American'' tradition (as opposed to statements in such continental writers as Haegerstroem, which became known to [[English language|English-speaking]] philosophers only comparatively late and had no early influence) was, so far as I know, that given by I. A. Richards in a general linguistic and [[epistemological]] work, ''The Meaning of Meaning'' …"; Urmson, ''Emotive Theory'', 16–17; Brandt, ''Ethical Theory'', 206: "The earliest suggestions of the theory in the [20th] century have been made by W. H. F. Barnes and A. Duncan-Jones."&lt;/ref&gt; However, it is the later works of Ayer and especially Stevenson that are the most developed and discussed defenses of the theory.

===A. J. Ayer===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:LanguageTruthAndLogic.jpg|thumb|200px|right|The cover of a 1952 version of ''Language, Truth and Logic'']] --&gt;
[[A. J. Ayer]]'s version of emotivism is given in chapter six, "Critique of Ethics and Theology", of ''Language, Truth and Logic''. In that chapter, Ayer divides "the ordinary system of ethics" into four classes:
#"Propositions that express definitions of ethical terms, or judgements about the legitimacy or possibility of certain definitions"
#"Propositions describing the phenomena of moral experience, and their causes"
#"Exhortations to moral virtue"
#"Actual ethical judgments"&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 103&lt;/ref&gt;
He focuses on propositions of the first class—moral judgments—saying that those of the second class belong to science, those of the third are mere commands, and those of the fourth (which are considered in [[normative ethics]] as opposed to [[meta-ethics]]) are too concrete for ethical philosophy. While class three statements were irrelevant to Ayer's brand of emotivism, they would later play a significant role in Stevenson's.

Ayer argues that moral judgments cannot be translated into non-ethical, empirical terms and thus cannot be verified; in this he agrees with [[ethical intuitionism|ethical intuitionists]]. But he differs from intuitionists by discarding appeals to intuition as "worthless" for determining moral truths,&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 106&lt;/ref&gt; since the intuition of one person often contradicts that of another. Instead, Ayer concludes that ethical concepts are "mere pseudo-concepts":

{{quote|The presence of an ethical symbol in a proposition adds nothing to its factual content. Thus if I say to someone, "You acted wrongly in stealing that money," I am not stating anything more than if I had simply said, "You stole that money." In adding that this action is wrong I am not making any further statement about it. I am simply evincing my moral disapproval of it. It is as if I had said, "You stole that money," in a peculiar tone of horror, or written it with the addition of some special exclamation marks. … If now I generalise my previous statement and say, "Stealing money is wrong," I produce a sentence that has no factual meaning—that is, expresses no proposition that can be either true or false. … I am merely expressing certain moral sentiments.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 107&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Ayer agrees with [[Ethical subjectivism|subjectivists]] in saying that ethical statements are necessarily ''related'' to individual attitudes, but he says they lack [[truth value]] because they cannot be properly understood as ''propositions'' about those attitudes; Ayer thinks ethical sentences are ''expressions'', not ''assertions'', of approval. While an assertion of approval may always be accompanied by an expression of approval, expressions can be made without making assertions; Ayer's example is boredom, which can be expressed through the stated assertion "I am bored" or through non-assertions including [[Nonverbal communication|tone of voice]], [[body language]], and various other verbal statements. He sees ethical statements as expressions of the latter sort, so the phrase "Theft is wrong" is a non-propositional sentence that is an expression of disapproval but is not equivalent to the proposition "I disapprove of theft".

Having argued that his theory of ethics is noncognitive and not subjective, he accepts that his position and subjectivism are equally confronted by [[G. E. Moore]]'s argument that ethical disputes are clearly genuine disputes and not just expressions of contrary feelings. Ayer's defense is that all ethical disputes are about ''facts'' regarding the proper application of a [[value system]] to a specific case, not about the value systems themselves, because any dispute about values can only be resolved by judging that one value system is superior to another, and this judgment itself presupposes a shared value system. If Moore is wrong in saying that there are actual disagreements of ''value'', we are left with the claim that there are actual disagreements of ''fact'', and Ayer accepts this without hesitation:

{{quote|If our opponent concurs with us in expressing moral disapproval of a given type ''t'', then we may get him to condemn a particular action A, by bringing forward arguments to show that A is of type ''t''. For the question whether A does or does not belong to that type is a plain question of fact.&lt;ref&gt;Ayer, ''Language'', 111&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===C. L. Stevenson===
[[Charles Stevenson|Stevenson's]] work has been seen both as an elaboration upon Ayer's views and as a representation of one of "two broad types of ethical emotivism."&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, ''Emotion'', 1: "Stevenson's version, which was intended to qualify the earlier views of Ayer (and others) … will then be treated as an elaboration of Ayer's."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Satris, ''Ethical Emotivism'', 25: "It might be suggested that there are two broad types of ethical emotivism. The first, represented by Stevenson, is well grounded in philosophical and psychological theory relating to ethics … The second, represented by Ayer, is an unorthodox spin-off of logical positivism."&lt;/ref&gt; An [[analytic philosopher]], Stevenson suggested in his 1937 essay "The Emotive Meaning of Ethical Terms" that any ethical theory should explain three things: that intelligent disagreement can occur over moral questions, that moral terms like ''good'' are "magnetic" in encouraging action, and that [[Scientific method|the scientific method]] is insufficient for verifying moral claims.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Facts'', 15; Hudson, ''Modern Moral Philosophy'', 114–15&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson's own theory was fully developed in his 1944 book ''[[Ethics and Language]]''. In it, he agrees with Ayer that ethical sentences express the speaker's feelings, but he adds that they also have an ''imperative'' component intended to change the listener's feelings and that this component is of greater importance.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Facts'', 21: "Both imperative and ethical sentences are used more for encouraging, altering, or redirecting people's aims and conduct than for simply describing them."&lt;/ref&gt; Where Ayer spoke of ''values'', or fundamental psychological inclinations, Stevenson speaks of ''attitudes'', and where Ayer spoke of disagreement of ''fact'', or rational disputes over the application of certain values to a particular case, Stevenson speaks of differences in ''belief''; the concepts are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, ''Emotion'', 20&lt;/ref&gt; Terminology aside, Stevenson interprets ethical statements according to two patterns of analysis.

====First pattern analysis====
Under his first pattern of analysis, an ethical statement has two parts: a declaration of the speaker's attitude and an imperative to mirror it, so "'This is good' means ''I approve of this; do so as well.''"&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Ethics'', 21&lt;/ref&gt; The first half of the sentence is a proposition, but the imperative half is not, so Stevenson's translation of an ethical sentence remains a noncognitive one.

Imperatives cannot be ''proved'', but they can still be ''supported'' so that the listener understands that they are not wholly arbitrary:

{{quote|If told to close the door, one may ask "Why?" and receive some such reason as "It is too drafty," or "The noise is distracting." … These reasons cannot be called "proofs" in any but a dangerously extended sense, nor are they demonstratively or inductively related to an imperative; but they manifestly do ''support'' an imperative. They "back it up," or "establish it," or "base it on concrete references to fact."&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Ethics'', 27&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The purpose of these supports is to make the listener understand the consequences of the action they are being commanded to do. Once they understand the command's consequences, they can determine whether or not obedience to the command will have desirable results.

{{quote|The imperative is used to alter the hearer's attitudes or actions. … The supporting reason then describes the situation the imperative seeks to alter, or the new situation the imperative seeks to bring about; and if these facts disclose that the new situation will satisfy a preponderance of the hearer's desires, he will hesitate to obey no longer. More generally, reasons support imperatives by altering such beliefs as may in turn alter an unwillingness to obey.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Ethics'', 27–28&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Second pattern analysis====
Stevenson's second pattern of analysis is used for statements about ''types'' of actions, not specific actions. Under this pattern,

{{quote|'This is good' has the meaning of 'This has qualities or relations X, Y, Z … ,' except that 'good' has as well a laudatory meaning, which permits it to express the speaker's approval, and tends to evoke the approval of the hearer.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Ethics'', 207&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In second-pattern analysis, rather than judge an action directly, the speaker is evaluating it according to a general principle. For instance, someone who says "Murder is wrong" might mean "Murder decreases happiness overall"; this is a second-pattern statement that leads to a first-pattern one: "I disapprove of anything that decreases happiness overall. Do so as well."&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, ''Emotion'', 15, gives a similar example&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methods of argumentation====
For Stevenson, moral disagreements may arise from different fundamental attitudes, different moral beliefs about specific cases, or both. The methods of moral argumentation he proposed have been divided into three groups, known as ''logical'', ''rational psychological'' and ''nonrational psychological'' forms of argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;Hudson, ''Modern Moral Philosophy'', 130–31; Wilks, ''Emotion'', 25–26&lt;/ref&gt;

Logical methods involve efforts to show inconsistencies between a person's fundamental attitudes and their particular moral beliefs. For example, someone who says "Edward is a good person" who has previously said "Edward is a thief" and "No thieves are good people" is guilty of inconsistency until he retracts one of his statements. Similarly, a person who says "Lying is always wrong" might consider lies in some situations to be morally permissible, and if examples of these situations can be given, his view can be shown to be logically inconsistent.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Ethics'', 115–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Rational psychological methods examine facts that relate fundamental attitudes to particular moral beliefs;&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, ''Emotion'', 25: "These are methods in which we scrutinise the factual beliefs that mediate between our fundamental and our derivative moral attitudes; where we argue about the truth of the morally relevant facts that are called upon in support of our or other people's derivative moral attitudes, eg. as when we argue about whether or not there is a causal connection between pornography and sexual violence." The moral "beliefs" Stevenson spoke of are referred to as "derivative moral attitudes" by Wilks in an attempt to avoid confusion between moral beliefs and "factual beliefs".&lt;/ref&gt; the goal is not to show that someone has been inconsistent, as with logical methods, but only that they are wrong about the facts that connect their attitudes to their beliefs. To modify the former example, consider the person who holds that all thieves are bad people. If she sees Edward pocket a wallet found in a [[Public space|public place]], she may conclude that he is a thief, and there would be no inconsistency between her attitude (that thieves are bad people) and her belief (that Edward is a bad person because he is a thief). However, it may be that Edward recognized the wallet as belonging to a friend, to whom he promptly returned it. Such a revelation would likely change the observer's belief about Edward, and even if it did not, the attempt to reveal such facts would count as a rational psychological form of moral argumentation.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Ethics'', 118–29&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-rational psychological methods revolve around language with psychological influence but no necessarily logical connection to the listener's attitudes. Stevenson called the primary such method "'persuasive,' in a somewhat broadened sense", and wrote:

{{quote|[Persuasion] depends on the sheer, direct emotional impact of words—on emotive meaning, rhetorical cadence, apt metaphor, stentorian, stimulating, or pleading tones of voice, dramatic gestures, care in establishing ''rapport'' with the hearer or audience, and so on. … A redirection of the hearer's attitudes is sought not by the mediating step of altering his beliefs, but by ''exhortation'', whether obvious or subtle, crude or refined.&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Ethics'', 139–40&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Persuasion may involve the use of particular emotion-laden words, like "democracy" or "dictator",&lt;ref&gt;Stevenson, ''Ethics'', 141&lt;/ref&gt; or hypothetical questions like "What if everyone thought the way you do?" or "How would you feel if you were in their shoes?"&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, ''Emotion'', 26&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
[[Utilitarian]] philosopher [[Richard Brandt]] offered several criticisms of emotivism in his 1959 book ''Ethical Theory''. His first is that "ethical utterances are not obviously the kind of thing the emotive theory says they are, and [[prima facie]], at least, should be viewed as statements."&lt;ref&gt;Brandt, ''Ethical Theory'', 225&lt;/ref&gt; He thinks that emotivism cannot explain why most people, historically speaking, have considered ethical sentences to be "fact-stating" and not just emotive. Furthermore, he argues that people who change their moral views see their prior views as mistaken, not just different, and that this does not make sense if their attitudes were all that changed:

{{quote|Suppose, for instance, as a child a person disliked eating peas. When he recalls this as an adult he is amused and notes how preferences change with age. He does not say, however, that his former attitude was ''mistaken''. If, on the other hand, he remembers regarding irreligion or divorce as wicked, and now does not, he regards his former view as erroneous and unfounded. … Ethical statements do not look like the kind of thing the emotive theory says they are.&lt;ref name="Brandt, Ethical Theory, 226"&gt;Brandt, ''Ethical Theory'', 226&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[James Urmson]]'s 1968 book ''The Emotive Theory of Ethics'' also disagreed with many of Stevenson's points in ''Ethics and Language'', "a work of great value" with "a few serious mistakes [that] led Stevenson consistently to distort his otherwise valuable insights".&lt;ref&gt;Urmson, ''Emotive Theory'', 38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Magnetic influence===
Brandt criticized what he termed "the 'magnetic influence' thesis",&lt;ref name="Brandt, Ethical Theory, 226" /&gt; the idea of Stevenson that ethical statements are meant to influence the listener's attitudes. Brandt contends that most ethical statements, including judgments of people who are not within listening range, are ''not'' made with the intention to alter the attitudes of others. Twenty years earlier, Sir [[William David Ross]] offered much the same criticism in his book ''Foundations of Ethics''. Ross suggests that the emotivist theory seems to be coherent only when dealing with simple linguistic acts, such as recommending, commanding, or passing judgement on something happening at the same point of time as the utterance.

{{quote|… There is no doubt that such words as 'you ought to do so-and-so' may be used as one's means of so inducing a person to behave a certain way. But if we are to do justice to the meaning of 'right' or 'ought', we must take account also of such modes of speech as 'he ought to do so-and-so', 'you ought to have done so-and-so', 'if this and that were the case, you ought to have done so-and-so', 'if this and that were the case, you ought to do so-and-so', 'I ought to do so-and-so.' Where the judgement of obligation has referenced either a third person, not the person addressed, or to the past, or to an unfulfilled past condition, or to a future treated as merely possible, or to the speaker himself, there is no plausibility in describing the judgement as command.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, ''Foundations'', 33–34&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to this view, it would make little sense to translate a statement such as "[[Galileo]] should not have been forced to recant on [[heliocentricism]]" into a command, imperative, or recommendation - to do so might require a radical change in the meaning of these ethical statements. Under this criticism, it would appear as if emotivist and prescriptivist theories are only capable of converting a relatively small subset of all ethical claims into imperatives.

Like Ross and Brandt, [[James Urmson|Urmson]] disagrees with Stevenson's "causal theory" of emotive meaning—the theory that moral statements only have ''emotive'' meaning when they are made to change in a listener's attitude—saying that is incorrect in explaining "evaluative force in purely causal terms". This is Urmson's fundamental criticism, and he suggests that Stevenson would have made a stronger case by explaining emotive meaning in terms of "commending and recommending attitudes", not in terms of "the power to evoke attitudes".&lt;ref&gt;Urmson, ''Emotive Theory'', 38–40, 64&lt;/ref&gt;

Stevenson's ''Ethics and Language'', written after Ross's book but before Brandt's and Urmson's, states that emotive terms are "not always used for purposes of exhortation."&lt;ref name="Stevenson, Ethics, 83"&gt;Stevenson, ''Ethics'', 83&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in the sentence "Slavery was good in Ancient Rome", Stevenson thinks one is speaking of past attitudes in an "almost purely descriptive" sense.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, Ethics, 83" /&gt; And in some discussions of ''current'' attitudes, "agreement in attitude can be taken for granted," so a judgment like "He was wrong to kill them" might describe one's attitudes yet be "emotively inactive", with no real emotive (or imperative) meaning.&lt;ref name="Stevenson, Ethics, 84"&gt;Stevenson, ''Ethics'', 84&lt;/ref&gt; Stevenson is doubtful that sentences in such contexts qualify as ''normative'' ethical sentences, maintaining that "for the contexts that are most typical of normative ethics, the ethical terms have a function that is ''both'' emotive and descriptive."&lt;ref name="Stevenson, Ethics, 84" /&gt;

=== Philippa Foot's moral realism ===
[[Philippa Foot]] adopts a [[Moral realism|moral realist]] position, criticizing the idea that when evaluation is superposed on fact there has been a "committal in a new dimension."&lt;ref&gt;Philippa Foot, "Moral Beliefs," ''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'', vol. 59 (1958), pp. 83-104.&lt;/ref&gt;  She introduces, by analogy, the practical implications of using the word ''injury''. Not just anything counts as an injury. There must be some impairment. When we suppose a man wants the things the injury prevents him from obtaining, haven’t we fallen into the old naturalist fallacy?
{{quote|It may seem that the only way to make a necessary connexion between 'injury' and the things that are to be avoided, is to say that it is only used in an 'action-guiding sense' when applied to something the speaker intends to avoid. But we should look carefully at the crucial move in that argument, and query the suggestion that someone might happen not to want anything for which he would need the use of hands or eyes. Hands and eyes, like ears and legs, play a part in so many operations that a man could only be said not to need them if he had no wants at all.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''., p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Foot argues that the virtues, like hands and eyes in the analogy, play so large a part in so many operations that it is implausible to suppose that a committal in a non-naturalist dimension is necessary to demonstrate their goodness.
{{quote|Philosophers who have supposed that actual action was required if 'good' were to be used in a sincere evaluation have got into difficulties over weakness of will, and they should surely agree that enough has been done if we can show that any man has reason to aim at virtue and avoid vice. But is this impossibly difficult if we consider the kinds of things that count as virtue and vice? Consider, for instance, the cardinal virtues, prudence, temperance, courage and justice. Obviously any man needs prudence, but does he not also need to resist the temptation of pleasure when there is harm involved? And how could it be argued that he would never need to face what was fearful for the sake of some good? It is not obvious what someone would mean if he said that temperance or courage were not good qualities, and this not because of the 'praising' sense of these words, but because of the things that courage and temperance are.&lt;ref&gt;''ibid''., p. 97�.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Standard using and standard setting===
As an offshoot of his fundamental criticism of Stevenson's magnetic influence thesis, Urmson wrote that ethical statements had two functions — "standard using", the application of accepted values to a particular case, and "standard setting", the act of proposing certain values as those that ''should'' be accepted — and that Stevenson confused them. According to Urmson, Stevenson's "I approve of this; do so as well" is a standard-setting statement, yet most moral statements are actually standard-''using'' ones, so Stevenson's explanation of ethical sentences is unsatisfactory.&lt;ref&gt;Urmson, ''Emotive Theory'', 64–71&lt;/ref&gt; Colin Wilks has responded that Stevenson's distinction between first-order and second-order statements resolves this problem: a person who says "Sharing is good" may be making a second-order statement like "Sharing is approved of by the community", the sort of standard-using statement Urmson says is most typical of moral discourse. At the same time, their statement can be reduced to a first-order, standard-setting sentence: "I approve of whatever is approved of by the community; do so as well."&lt;ref&gt;Wilks, ''Emotion'', 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''ethical dilemma''' or '''ethical paradox''' is a decision-making problem between two possible [[moral imperative]]s, neither of which is unambiguously acceptable or preferable. The complexity arises out of the situational conflict in which obeying one would result in transgressing another. 
Sometimes called ethical paradoxes in [[moral philosophy]], ethical dilemmas may be invoked to refute an [[ethical]] system or [[moral code]], or to improve it so as to resolve the [[paradox]].

{{unreferenced section|date=June 2017}}
Ethical dilemmas can be solved in various ways, for example by showing that the claimed situation is only apparent and does not really exist (thus is not a [[paradox]] logically), or that the solution to the ethical dilemma involves choosing the greater good and lesser evil (as discussed in [[value theory]]), or that the whole [[Framing (social sciences)|framing]] of the problem omits creative alternatives (such as [[peacemaking]]), or (more recently) that [[situational ethics]] or [[situated ethics]] must apply because the case cannot be removed from context and still be understood. ''See also [[case-based reasoning]] on this process.'' An alternative to situational ethics is [[graded absolutism]].

A popular ethical conflict is that between an [[Moral imperative|imperative]] or [[injunction]] not to steal and one to care for a family that you cannot afford to feed without stolen money. Debates on this often revolve around the availability of alternate means of income or support such as a [[social safety net]], [[charitable organization|charity]], etc.  The debate is in its starkest form when framed as stealing food. Under an ethical system in which stealing is always wrong and letting one's family die from starvation is always wrong, a person in such a situation would be forced to commit one wrong to avoid committing another, and be in constant conflict with those whose view of the acts varied.

However, there are no legitimate ethical systems in which stealing is more wrong than letting one's family die.  Ethical systems do in fact allow for, and sometimes outline, tradeoffs or priorities in decisions. Resolving ethical dilemmas is rarely simple or clearcut and very often involves revisiting similar dilemmas that recur within societies.

According to some philosophers and sociologists, e.g. [[Karl Marx]] and [[marxist ethics]], it is the different life experience of people and the different exposure of them and their families in these roles (the rich constantly robbing the poor, the poor in a position of constant begging and subordination) that creates [[social class]] differences. In other words, ethical dilemmas can become political and economic factions that engage in long-term recurring struggles.

'''Genetic epistemology''' or 'developmental theory of knowledge' is a study of the origins (genesis) of knowledge ([[epistemology]]) established by [[Jean Piaget]].

==Aims==
The goal of genetic epistemology is to link the validity of knowledge to the model of its construction. It shows that how the knowledge was gained affects how valid it is. For example, our experience of gravity makes our knowledge of it more valid than our theory about [[black hole]]s. Genetic epistemology also explains the process of how people develop cognitively from birth throughout their lives in four primary stages: sensorimotor (birth to age 2), pre-operational (2-7), concrete operational (7-11), and formal operational (11 years onward).  The main focus is on the younger years of development.  ''[[wikt:Assimilation|Assimilation]]'' occurs when the perception of a new event or object occurs to the learner in an existing schema and is usually used in the context of self-motivation. In ''[[Accommodation (psychology)|Accommodation]]'', one accommodates the experiences according to the outcome of the tasks. The highest form of development is ''equilibration''.  Equilibration encompasses both assimilation and accommodation as the learner changes how they think to get a better answer. This is the upper level of development.

Piaget believed that knowledge is a biological function that results from the actions of an individual through change.  He also stated that knowledge consists of structures, and comes about by the adaptation of these structures with the environment.

Piaget's genetic epistemology is halfway between formal logic and dialectical logic. Piaget's epistemology is midway between [[objective idealism]] and [[materialism]].

==Piaget's schema theory==
#Thought passes through a series of [[Theory of cognitive development|stages of development]]; at each stage there applies formal logic at a specific stage of differentiation which may be characterized by an algebra in which exactly such-and-such a mathematical structure applies, corresponding to the axioms of logic at that stage; this logic is manifested first in actions, then at a relatively early stage in sensorimotor operations (in the specific mathematical sense of the word, as opposed to "actions" which are equivalent to relations but not yet mathematical operations), and finally in operations which express thoughts, conscious purposive activity.
#The material basis for transition from [[Theory of cognitive development#Sensorimotor stage|sensorimotor]] intelligence to representation and from representation to conceptual thought is the interiorisation of practical activity.
#The successive stages of concepts manifested in [[child development]] imply relations of deduction in mathematical logic and in the development of thinking in other planes of development, such as in the history of science and the history of knowledge in the [[anthropological]] domain.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.marxists.org/reference/subject/philosophy/works/fr/piaget.htm "Genetic Epistemology"] by Jean Piaget (1968)&lt;/ref&gt;

Piaget draws on the full range of contemporary mathematical knowledge, a vast empirical base of observation of the learning of very young children built up at his institute and reports of observations of older children and a general knowledge of the development of knowledge in history.

(1) From the standpoint of dialectical logic, we must agree that at each stage of development, at each "definition of the Absolute" in Hegel's terminology, formal logic is applicable. Piaget's proof of this is striking, and his demonstration of how the stages of development in child thought pass through a specific series which is deductive in a specific sense from the standpoint of mathematics is original and profound.

However, from the standpoint of understanding development (and this is Piaget's standpoint), what is important is not the definition of each stage but the transition from one to the next; and for this it is necessary to demonstrate the internal contradiction within the logic of that plane.

Since Piaget draws on mathematical logic more developed than what was known to [[Hegel]], it will be necessary to investigate these structures to see if this speculative proposition proves to be valid.

(2) The concept of interiorisation is indeed the basis of the materialist view of the development of thought. However, Piaget, as a professional child-psychologist falls prey to the objective idealism of any professional, of elevating the subject matter of his particular profession from being an aspect of the material world to being its master. [The charge of objective [[idealism]] is qualified, for Piaget is quite unambiguous that relations conceived of in thought exist objectively in the material world].

Thus, since his body of authoritative empirical work is in relation to early childhood development, he imposes the [[Schema (psychology)|schema]] appropriate to this semi-human subject on to adolescent development, speculates on its possible reflection in anthropological development and confounds it with the history of development of science and [[philosophy]]. I say "confounds" because Piaget is aware that his schemas do not seem to apply in this domain. In this sense, the charge of objective idealism would seem unfair, but from confounding he does not go further and seek the implication of this lack of correspondence, but seeks to minimize it.

By focusing on early childhood (as indeed he must; that is his profession, and his institute has contributed a vast body of empirical material), Piaget sees what is biologically (zoologically?) human but not what is socially (historically) human, and humanity is essentially social, after all.

(3) On the plus side, it has to be said that Piaget deals once and for all with any idea of innate intelligence, and makes fully convincing the prospect of a fully genetic (i.e. developmental) elaboration of intelligence, assuming only animal instincts such as grasping and sucking and sensorimotor "equipment" capable of reflecting highly developed relations.
A weakness in Piaget's theory could be that there isn't proof in how one transitions from one stage to the next.  Can someone progress from one stage forward, but revert backwards, and then move forward again?

== Types of knowledge ==
Piaget proposes three types of knowledge: physical, logical mathematical, and social knowledge.

Physical knowledge: It refers to knowledge related to objects in the world, which can be acquired through perceptual properties. The acquisition of physical knowledge has been equated with learning in Piaget's theory (Gruber and Voneche, 1995). In other words, thought is fit directly to experience.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Piaget also called his view constructivism, because he firmly believed that knowledge acquisition is a process of continuous self-construction.  That is, Knowledge is not out there, external to the child and waiting to be discovered.  But neither is it wholly performed within the child, ready to emerge as the child develops with the world surrounding her&amp;nbsp;... Piaget believed that children actively approach their environments and acquire knowledge through their actions."&lt;ref name="Driscoll 2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Driscoll|first=Marcy P.|title=Psychology of learning for instruction|year=2005|publisher=Pearson Allyn and Bacon|location=Boston, MA|isbn=0-205-37519-7|page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Piaget distinguished among three types of knowledge that children acquire:  Physical, logical-mathematical, and social knowledge.  '''Physical knowledge,''' also called empirical knowledge, has to do with knowledge about objects in the world, which can be gained through their perceptual properties... '''Logical-Mathematical knowledge''' is abstract and must be invented, but through actions on objects that are fundamentally different from those actions enabling physical knowledge.... '''Social Knowledge''' is culture-specific and can be learned only from other people within one's cultural group." {{Citation needed|date=December 2014}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1503">'''Gisan Zenkai''' (儀山 善来; 1802–1878) was a [[Zen]] Master in 19th century [[Japan]].  He taught at Sōgen-ji 曹源寺 in Okayama.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zendounagota.wordpress.com/english/the-teachings/essays-and-talks/sogens-one-drop-of-water/ Sogen's One Drop of Water]&lt;/ref&gt;  The most famous story about him concerns his conversation in 1837 with the disciple cooling his bath: this is given in an abbreviated version in ''[[Zen Flesh, Zen Bones]]'', and in more expanded version in other sources (such as [http://sweepingzen.com/2009/12/23/tekisui-giboku-bio/ this]).  The ''Zen Flesh, Zen Bones'' version is: 

:"A Zen master name Gisan asked  a young student to bring him a pail of water to cool his bath.
:"The student brought the water and, after cooling the bath, threw on to the ground the little that was left over.
:"'You dunce!' the master scolded him. 'Why didn't you give the rest of the water to the plants? What right have you to waste even a drop of water in this temple?'
:The young student attained Zen in that instant. He changed his name to [[Tekisui Giboku]] (1822—1899), which means a drop of water."&lt;ref&gt;Reps, Paul.  ''Zen Flesh, Zen Bones''.  New York: Anchor Books, 1989. p. 79&lt;/ref&gt;

Gisan was also the teacher of masters [[Imakita Kōsen]], Ekkei Shuken, Daisetsu Joen, and Ogino Dokuen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zendounagota.wordpress.com/english/the-teachings/essays-and-talks/sogens-one-drop-of-water/ Sogen's One Drop of Water]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Glenn Albrecht''' (born 1953) was Professor of [[Sustainability]] at [[Murdoch University]] in [[Western Australia]]. He retired in 2014. He is an honorary fellow in the School Of Geosciences, Sydney University, N.S.W.
In 2008 Albrecht finished as the Associate Professor in [[Environmental Studies]] in [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] in [[New South Wales]]. He has become known for coining the neologism ''[[solastalgia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;G. Albrecht, Solastalgia, a new concept in human health and identity, Philosophy Activism Nature 3:41-44 (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

He is an environmental philosopher with both theoretical and applied interests in the relationship between ecosystem and human health. He has pioneered the research domain of 'psychoterratic' or earth related mental health conditions with the concept of 'solastalgia' or the lived experience of negative environmental change. He also has publications in the field of animal ethics including the ethics of relocating endangered species in the face of climate change pressures.

He publishes in peer reviewed journals and has recently completed and published book chapters on his research interests. With colleagues, Nick Higginbotham (University of Newcastle) and Linda Connor (Sydney University) under Australian Research Council Discovery Project grants, he has researched the impact of mining in the Upper Hunter Region of NSW, Australia, and now, the impact of climate change on communities, again in the Hunter Region. Glenn has also been involved as a Chief Investigator in ARC Discovery Project research on the social and ethical aspects of the thoroughbred horse industry worldwide.
 
Glenn Albrecht is a pioneer of transdisciplinary thinking and, with Higginbotham and Connor produced a major book on this topic, ''Health Social Science: A Transdisciplinary and Complexity Perspective'' with Oxford University Press in 2001. His current major research interest, the positive and negative psychological, emotional and cultural relationships people have to place and its transformation is one that sees him having an international research profile. &lt;ref&gt;Smith, Daniel B.

'''Jean-Yves Girard''' ({{IPA-fr|ʒiʁaʁ|lang}}; born 1947) is a French [[logician]] working in [[proof theory]]. He is the research director ([[emeritus]]) at the mathematical institute of [[Faculte des Sciences de Luminy|Luminy]].

== Biography ==

Jean-Yves Girard is an alumnus of the [[École normale supérieure de Saint-Cloud]].

He made a name for himself in the 1970s with his proof of [[strong normalization]] in a system of [[second-order logic]] called [[System F]]. This result gave a new proof of [[Takeuti's conjecture]], which was proven a few years earlier by [[William W. Tait]], Moto-o Takahashi and [[Dag Prawitz]]. For this purpose, he introduced the notion of "reducibility candidate" ("candidat de réducibilité"). He is also credited with the discovery of [[Girard's paradox]], [[linear logic]]; the [[geometry of interaction]]; [[ludics]]; and the mustard watch.&lt;ref name=MW&gt;{{cite web

'''Kenneth George "Ken" Binmore''', {{post-nominals|country=GBR|CBE}} (born 27 September 1940) is a British [[mathematician]], economist, and [[game theory|game theorist]]. He is a Professor Emeritus of Economics at [[University College London]] (UCL)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.econ.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/binmore/cv.pdf |title=CV |publisher=[[ELSE]] |accessdate=12 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210004926/http://www.econ.ucl.ac.uk/downloads/binmore/cv.pdf |archivedate=10 February 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a Visiting Emeritus Professor of Economics at the [[University of Bristol]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bristol.ac.uk/economics/staff/binmore.html&lt;/ref&gt;

He is one of the founders of the modern economic theory of [[Nash bargaining solution|bargaining]] (along with [[John Forbes Nash|Nash]] and [[Ariel Rubinstein|Rubinstein]]), and has made important contributions to the foundations of [[game theory]], [[experimental economics]], and [[evolutionary game theory]], as well as to [[analytical philosophy]]. Binmore took up economics after a career in mathematics, during which he held the Chair of Mathematics at the [[London School of Economics]]. Since his switch to economics he has been at the forefront of developments in game theory. His other research interests include political and [[moral philosophy]], [[decision theory]], and statistics. He is the author of more than 100 scholarly papers and 14 books.

==Education==
He studied mathematics at [[Imperial College London]] where he was awarded 1st class honours BSc with Governor's Prize, and subsequently PhD (in [[mathematical analysis]]).

==Research==
Binmore's major research contributions are to the theory of bargaining and its testing in the laboratory. He is a pioneer of [[experimental economics]]. He began his experimental work in the 1980s when most economists thought that game theory would not work in the laboratory. Binmore and his collaborators established that game theory can often predict the behaviour of experienced players very well in laboratory settings, even in the case of human bargaining behaviour, a particularly challenging case for game theory. This has brought him into conflict with some proponents of [[behavioural economics]] who emphasise the importance of other-regarding or social preferences, and argue that their findings threaten traditional game theory.

Binmore's work in political and moral philosophy began in the 1980s when he first applied bargaining theory to [[John Rawls]]' original position. His search for the philosophical foundations of the [[original position]] took him first to [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]'s works, and then to [[David Hume|Hume]]. Hume inspired Binmore to contribute to a naturalistic science of morals that seeks foundations for Rawlsian ideas about fairness norms in biological and social evolution. The result was his two-volume ''Game Theory and the Social Contract'', an ambitious attempt to lay the foundations for a genuine science of morals using the theory of games. In ''Game Theory and the Social Contract'' Binmore proposes a naturalistic reinterpretation of [[John Rawls]]' original position that reconciles his egalitarian theory of justice with [[John Harsanyi]]'s  utilitarian theory. His recent ''Natural Justice'' provides a nontechnical synthesis of this work.

==Affiliations==
In 1995 Binmore became one of the founding directors of the Centre for Economic Learning and Social Evolution (ELSE), an interdisciplinary research centre involving economists, [[psychologists]], [[anthropologists]] and [[mathematicians]] based at [[University College London]]. Funded by the Economic and Social Research Council, ELSE pursues fundamental research on evolutionary and learning approaches to games and society, and it applies its theoretical findings to practical problems in government and business.

While the Director of ELSE, Binmore became widely known as the ‘poker-playing economic theorist’ who netted the British government £22 billion when he led the team that designed the third generation (3G) telecommunications [[auction]] in 2000. He went on to design and implement 3G [[spectrum auctions]] in Belgium, Denmark, Greece, Israel and Hong Kong.

Binmore is Emeritus Professor of Economics at [[University College London]], Visiting Emeritus Professor of Economics at the [[University of Bristol]] and Visiting Professor in the Department of Philosophy, Logic and Scientific Method at the [[London School of Economics]].  He has held corresponding positions at the [[London School of Economics]], [[Caltech]], the University of [[university of Pennsylvania|Pennsylvania]] and the University of [[university of Michigan|Michigan]]. He is a Fellow of the [[Econometric Society]] and the [[British Academy]]. He was appointed a [[Commander of the Order of the British Empire|CBE]] in the New Year's Honours List 2001 for contributions to game theory and for his role in designing the UK's 3G telecommunications auctions. He was elected a Foreign Honorary Member of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 2002.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780–2010: Chapter B|url=http://www.amacad.org/publications/BookofMembers/ChapterB.pdf|publisher=American Academy of Arts and Sciences|accessdate=20 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 he was appointed an Honorary Research Fellow in the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Bristol]] and an Honorary Fellow of the Centre for Philosophy at the [[London School of Economics]].

[[File:Liber Physiognomiae Michael Scot.jpg|thumb|right|The first page of a 1505 copy of the ''Liber Physiognomiae'', written by the Scottish mathematician, philosopher, and scholar [[Michael Scot]] sometime in the early 13th century.]]
'''''Liber physiognomiae''''' ({{IPA-la|lī.ber fi.si.oː.noː.mi.ae̯|lang}}; '''''The Book of Physiognomy'''''){{#tag:ref|This work is also known as ''De physiognomia et de hominis procreatione'' ({{IPA-la|deː fi.si.oː.noː.mi.a ɛt deː ˈhoː.mɪ.nɪs proː.kreː.aː.ti.oː.nɛ|lang}}; ''Concerning Physiognomy and Human Procreation'') and the ''Physionomia''. During the [[Renaissance]] it was often referred to as ''De secretis nature''&lt;!-- In Medieval Latin, "ae" was often simplified to "e"; as such, "nature" and NOT "naturae" is the correct spelling --&gt; ({{IPA-la|deː seːˈkreː.tīs naː.tu.rɛ|lang}}; ''Concerning the Secrets of Nature'').&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} is a work by the Scottish mathematician, philosopher, and scholar [[Michael Scot]] concerning [[physiognomy]]; the work is also the final book of a trilogy known as the ''[[Liber introductorius]]''. The ''Liber physiognomiae'' itself is divided into three sections, which deal with various concepts like procreation, generation, dream interpretation, and physiognomy proper.

The information found in the ''Liber physiognomiae'' seems to have been derived largely from Arabic copies of Aristotelian and [[Pseudo-Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotelian]] works. The work was written in the early 13th century for [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]], the [[Holy Roman Emperor]], but was first officially printed in 1477. ''Liber physiognomiae'' would go on to be very popular, and would be reprinted many times. Scot's work had a major influence on physiognomy itself, and heavily affected how it would be approached and applied in the future.

''Liber physiognomiae'' was written by the Scottish mathematician [[Michael Scot]] (AD 1175 – c. 1232) and is the final entry in a divination-centered trilogy, collectively titled the ''[[Liber introductorius]]'' (''The Great Introductory Book'').{{#tag:ref|Some sources refer to the first book in the trilogy as the ''Liber introductorius'',&lt;ref&gt;Examples includes: [[#Edwards|Edwards (1985)]]; [[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; whereas other sources specify that the first book is the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' and that ''Liber introductorius'' is the name of the trilogy as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Examples include: [[#Meyer|Meyer (2010)]]; [[#Pick|Pick (1998)]], p. 96; [[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 15, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt;|group="nb"}} This trilogy also includes the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' (''The Book of the Four Distinctions'') and the ''Liber particularis'' (''The Singular Book'').&lt;ref name=resnicknote&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 15, note 10.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kay5&gt;[[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Kay|Kay (1985)]], p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Scott|Scott &amp; Marketos (2014)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

''Liber physiognomiae'', as the title suggests, concerns [[physiognomy]], or a technique by which a person's character or personality is deduced based on their outer appearance. Scot refers to this as a "doctrine of salvation" (''Phisionomia est doctrina salutis''), as it easily allows one to determine if a person is virtuous or evil.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], p. 16, note 11.&lt;/ref&gt; The book is relatively short, comprising about sixty [[octavo]] pages.&lt;ref name=kay5 /&gt; The work is usually divided into around one hundred chapters, with the number of chapters and their divisions differing greatly depending on what manuscript is being consulted.&lt;ref name=thorn87&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;

While the chapter headings vary across manuscripts, scholars are in agreement that the work is made up of three distinct sections. The first of these deals with the concepts of procreation and generation, largely according to the doctrines of [[Aristotle]] and [[Galen]].&lt;ref name=encyclopedia&gt;[[#Baynes|Baynes &amp; Smith (1891)]], p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=contents&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt; This section opens by stressing the important influence of the stars before it deals with topics concerning human [[sexual intercourse]]. The book then moves onto the topics of conception and birth, and the author then explores the physical signs of pregnancy. The final two chapters of this section deal with animals; the penultimate chapter focuses on "animals ''in genere et in specie''" (i.e. in regards to genus and species),{{#tag:ref|In [[Aristotle's biology|his biology]], Aristotle used the term γένος (génos) to mean a general 'kind' and εἶδος (eidos) to mean a specific [[Hylomorphism|form]] within a kind. For instance, "bird" would be a ''génos'', whereas an eagle would be an ''eidos''. ''Génos''and ''eidos'' were later translated into Latin as "genus" and "species", though they do not correspond to the [[Linnean taxonomy|Linnean terms]] thus named.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Leroi|Leroi (2014)]], pp. 88{{en dash}}90.&lt;/ref&gt; Given that Scot was writing before the Linnean terms were developed, his use of the words "genus" and "species" retain their Aristotelian meanings.|group="nb"}} while the final details an idiosyncratic system for differentiating the various types of animals.&lt;ref name=thorn8788&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], pp. 87{{en dash}}88.&lt;/ref&gt;

The second section begins to focus specifically on physiognomy, considering different organs and body regions that index the "character and faculties" of individuals.&lt;ref name=encyclopedia /&gt;&lt;ref name=contents /&gt;&lt;ref name=thorn88&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt; Early chapters in this portion of the book are written in a medical style, and they detail signs in regards to "temperate and healthy bod[ies] ... repletion of bad [[Humorism|humours]] and excess of blood, cholera, phlegm, and melancholy", before turning to particular sections of the body.&lt;ref name=thorn88 /&gt; Several following chapters discuss [[Dream interpretation|dreams and their meanings]]. Scot argues that dreams are: true or false; represent past, present, or future events; or are entirely meaningless.&lt;ref name=thorn89&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt; The second section comes to an end with chapters concerning [[augury|auguries]] and sneezes, respectively.&lt;ref name=thorn90&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

The third and final section covers body parts, and explicates what the characteristics of these portions may reveal about the nature of the person in question.&lt;ref name=contents /&gt; The final chapter in this section warns the would-be physiognomist to withhold judgement based solely on one part of their body, but rather to "tend always to a general judgement based on the majority of all [the person's] members."&lt;ref name=thorn91&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This is because another part which has not been consulted may readily counter a conclusion suggested by a part that has. Scot also argues that a physiognomist should take into account a person's "age, long residence in one place, long social usage, excessive prevalence of the humours of his complexion beyond what is customary, accidental sickness, violence, accidents contrary to nature, and a defect of one of the five natural senses."&lt;ref name=thorn91 /&gt;

=== Sources ===

According to the physiognomy scholar Martin Porter, the ''Liber physiognomiae'' is a "distinctly Aristotelian" compendium of "the more Arabic influenced 'medical' aspects of natural philosophy."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 122.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, it seems likely that Scot made use of several Aristotelian and [[Pseudo-Aristotle|Pseudo-Aristotelian]] works in the writing of the ''Liber physiognomiae'', many of which were derived from Arabic copies. The first of these is an Arabic translation of the ''[[History of Animals|Historia Animalium]]''.&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt; The second is the ''[[Secretum Secretorum|Kitāb Sirr al-Asrār]]'' ({{lang-ar|كتاب سر الأسرار}}; known in Latin as the ''Secreta Secretorum''), an Arabic text that purports to be a letter from Aristotle to his student [[Alexander the Great]] on a range of topics, including physiognomy.&lt;ref name=brown3237&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], pp. 32{{en dash}}37.&lt;/ref&gt;{{#tag:ref|James Wood Brown argues it is "beyond question" that Scot used the Latin-translation of this text, the ''Secretum Secretorum'', in writing the ''Liber physiognomiae''; Haskins, on the other hand, argues that Scot's work is related to the Latin version only "through a common Arabic source".&lt;ref name=haskins262 /&gt;&lt;ref name=brown3237 /&gt; Lynn Thorndike seems to favor Haskins hypothesis, aruging "Michael, himself a translator of long standing from the Arabic, could have made direct use of the Arabic text ... Other evidence makes it more likely that Philip knew of Michael's ''Physiognomy'' and that his translation of ''Secreta secretorum'' was subsequent to it."&lt;ref name="thorn91" /&gt;|group="nb"}} The third of these works is ''[[Physiognomonics]]'', also [[Pseudepigrapha|attributed]] to Aristotle and, as the title suggests, also about physiognomy; the influence of this Pseudo-Aristotelian work, according to Haskins, is "limited to the preface" of the ''Liber physiognomiae''.&lt;ref name=haskins262 /&gt;&lt;ref name=brown38&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; Scot probably used the original Greek version of ''Physiognomonics'' to write his book.{{#tag:ref|Because it is believed that the first Latin version of the ''Physiognomonics'' was translated directly from the original Greek by Bartholomew of Messina several years after Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' was written,&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Knuuttila|Knuuttila &amp; Sihvola (2013)]], p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; and because no Arabic translation of the work is known to exist, the fact that several passages in Scot's book correspond to passages from Bartholomew of Messina's Latin version of the ''Physiognomonics'' suggests that the two were working from the same (Greek) source. This is evidence that Scot had a working knowledge of Greek.&lt;ref name=brown38 /&gt;|group="nb"}} The historian [[Charles Homer Haskins]] argues that the ''Liber physiognomiae'' also "makes free use" of [[Muhammad ibn Zakariya al-Razi]] (also known as Rhazes) and shows "some affinities" with [[Trotula]] texts and writers of the [[Schola Medica Salernitana]] (a [[medical school]] located in the Italian town of [[Salerno]]).&lt;ref name=haskins262&gt;[[#Haskins|Haskins (1921)]], p. 262.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication history and popularity ==

[[File:Frederick II and eagle.jpg|thumb|upright|The work was dedicated to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor]].]]

The work was written sometime in the early 13th century, and is explicitly dedicated to [[Frederick II, Holy Roman Emperor|Frederick II]]. The scholar James Wood Brown argues that the book was likely written for the soon-to-be [[Holy Roman Emperor]] Frederick II in AD 1209 on the occasion of his wedding to [[Constance of Aragon]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; Brown also adds, "No date suits this publication so well as 1209, and nothing but the urgent desire of Court and people that the marriage should prove fruitful can explain, one might add excuse, some passages of almost [[Fescennine Verses|fescennine]] license which it contains."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Brown|Brown (1897)]], pp. 30{{en dash}}31.&lt;/ref&gt; The philosophy and religion scholar Irven Resnick argues that the work was given to Frederick so that "the emperor [might be able] to distinguish, from outward appearances, trustworthy and wise counselors from their opposite numbers."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Resnick|Resnick (2012)]], pp. 15{{en dash}}16.&lt;/ref&gt;

While manuscripts of the ''Liber quatuor distinctionum'' and the ''Liber particularis'' exist, the ''Liber physiognomiae'' was the only book from the ''Liber introductorius'' trilogy to be professionally printed, with a first print of the book being released in 1477.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Thorndike|Thorndike (1965)]], p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=turner/&gt; Between the date of its official printing and 1660, the work was reprinted eighteen times in many languages; this popularity of the text led Rudolf Hirsch (a book scholar) in 1950 to call the book one of the Middle Ages' "best sellers".&lt;ref name=turner&gt;[[#Turner|Turner (1911)]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hirsch|Hirsch (1950)]], p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The number of reprints and its wide circulation is attributed in large part to the advent of the [[printing press]] in 1440.&lt;ref name=contents /&gt; Among the many reprints, there is little evidence of textual changes, which is unique for manuscripts published and then transmitted in the fifteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Hellinga|Hellinga (1998)]], p. 409.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Liber physiognomiae'' was often bundled with other, topically-similar texts. For instance, some copies of Scot's book were combined with a work by [[Pseudepigrapha|pseudo-]][[Albertus Magnus]] entitled ''De secretis mulierum'' (''Concerning the Secrets of Women''), which, according to the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', suggests the opinion of the time was that Scot "dealt with forbidden subjects, or at least subjects better left to medical science."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Stephen|Stephen (1897)]], p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; Extracts from the ''Liber physiognomiae'' also appear in many early printed versions of Johannes de Ketham's medical treatise ''[[Fasciculus Medicinae]]'' (although this is not the case for all early copies).&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1515 a compendium titled ''Phisionomia Aristotellis, cum commanto Micaelis Scoti'' was published, which featured the ''Liber physiognomiae'' of Scot, alongside physiognomical works by Aristotle and [[Bartolomeo della Rocca]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact==

According to Porter, Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' was influential for three main reasons: First, Scot developed a number of physiognomical [[aphorism]]s.&lt;ref name=point1&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], pp. 69{{en dash}}70.&lt;/ref&gt; Given the popularity of the ''Liber physiognomiae'', Scot's new formulations and ideas, according to Porter, "introduce[d] some fundamental changes into the structure and nature of the physiognomical aphorism."&lt;ref name=point2/&gt; (Effectively, what Scot did was add new meanings to various physical features, making the physiognomical signs discussed in the ''Liber physiognomiae'' more complex and, as Porter writes, "[[wiktionary:polyvalent|polyvalent]].")&lt;ref name=point1/&gt; Second, Scot developed a "stronger conceptual link between physiognomy, issues of hereditary, embryology, and generation, which he articulated through astrological ideas of conception."&lt;ref name=point2/&gt; Porter argues that this was done because the book was written by Scot to help Frederick II pick a suitable wife (and thus, by extension, produce a suitable heir).&lt;ref name=point2&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; Third and finally, Scot's ''Liber physiognomiae'' seems to be the first physiognomical work that takes smell into account. According to Porter, this "totalization" of physiognomy{{em dash}}that is, connecting it to a variety of subjects like reproduction and sense perception{{em dash}}was the most dramatic change that occurred in the way that physiognomy was practiced "as it developed in the period between [[classical Athens]] and late fifteenth-century Europe".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Porter|Porter (2005)]], pp. 70{{en dash}}71.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Caudillo''' (Spanish pronunciation: [kawˈdiʎo];Portuguese: caudilho[kɐwˈðiʎu]; Old Spanish: cabdillo, from Latin ''capitellum'', diminutive of ''caput'' "head". Caudillo means “little head” or “little chief”) is part of the larger Iberian tradition of authoritarian leaders, with roots in the Iberian past.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh M. Hamill, "Caudillismo, Caudillo". ''Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 2, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; A number of military leaders who were part of the Spanish American struggle for independence took on political roles in during the establishment of new sovereign nation-states. The establishment of military strong men as the head of new national governments did not generally come via elections, but many did have strong popular support. Caudillos often have a personalist connection with their popular followers, combining charisma and [[machismo]] ("manliness"), access to political and economic power.  They often desire to legitimize their rule.&lt;ref&gt;Hamill, "Caudillismo, Caudillo", p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;  Many caudillos brought order to their areas of control, but also resorted to violence with their armed supporters to achieve it.  The early nineteenth century has been considered the "Age of Caudillos," but [[authoritarian]] regimes existed in the twentieth century as well, with ''caudillismo'' casting a long shadow.&lt;ref&gt;John Lynch, ''Caudillos in Spanish America, 1800-1850''. Oxford: Clarendon Press 1992, p.437.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Atheism and Irreligion Sidebar}}
'''Metaphysical naturalism''' (also called '''ontological naturalism''', '''philosophical naturalism''', '''scientific materialism''' and '''antisupernaturalism''') is a philosophical worldview, which holds that there is nothing but [[natural]] elements, principles, and relations of the kind studied by the [[natural sciences]].  [[Methodological naturalism]] is a philosophical basis for science, for which metaphysical naturalism provides only one possible [[ontology|ontological]] foundation. Broadly, the corresponding theological perspective is [[religious naturalism]] or [[spiritual naturalism]]. More specifically, metaphysical naturalism rejects the [[supernatural]] concepts and explanations that are part of many [[religions]].

==Definition==

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], geologist and president of [[Texas Citizens for Science]], metaphysical naturalism is a philosophy that maintains that: 1. Nature encompasses all that [[existence|exists]] throughout [[spacetime|space and time]]; 2. Nature (the [[universe]] or [[cosmos]]) consists only of natural elements, that is, of spatiotemporal [[physical property|physical]] substance—[[mass]]–[[energy]]. Non-physical or quasi-physical [[substance (philosophy)|substance]], such as [[information]], [[idea]]s, [[values]], [[logic]], [[mathematics]], [[intellect]], and other [[emergentism|emergent phenomena]], either [[supervenience|supervene]] upon the physical or can be [[eliminative materialism|reduced]] to a physical account; 3. Nature operates by the laws of [[physics]] and in principle, can be explained and understood by science and philosophy; and 4. the [[supernatural]] does not exist, i.e., only nature is [[reality|real]].  [[Naturalism (philosophy)|Naturalism]] is therefore a [[metaphysical]] philosophy opposed primarily by Biblical creationism.{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

[[Carl Sagan]] put it succinctly: "The Cosmos is all that is or ever was or ever will be."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sagan|first=Carl|authorlink=Carl Sagan|title=Cosmos|publisher=[[Random House]]|year=2002|isbn=9780375508325|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Arthur C. Danto]], naturalism, in recent usage, is a species of philosophical monism according to which whatever exists or happens is ''natural'' in the sense of being susceptible to explanation through methods which, although paradigmatically exemplified in the natural sciences, are continuous from domain to domain of objects and events. Hence, naturalism is polemically defined as repudiating the view that there exists or could exist any entities which lie, in principle, beyond the scope of scientific explanation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Arthur C. |last=Danto|title=The Encyclopedia of Philosophy|chapter=Naturalism}} Editor {{harvnb|Stone|2008|p=2}} "Personally, I place great emphasis on the phrase "in principle", since there are many things that science does not now explain. And perhaps we need some natural piety concerning the ontological limit question as to why there is anything at all. But the idea that naturalism is a polemical notion is important".&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the vagueness of the general term "naturalism", [[David Papineau]] traces the current usage to philosophers in early 20th century America such as [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]], and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]: "So understood, 'naturalism' is not a particularly informative term as applied to contemporary philosophers. The great majority of contemporary philosophers would happily accept naturalism as just characterized—that is, they would both reject 'supernatural' entities, and allow that science is a possible route (if not necessarily the only one) to important truths about the 'human spirit'".{{sfn|Papineau|2007}} Papineau remarks that philosophers widely regard naturalism as a "positive" term, and "few active philosophers nowadays are happy to announce themselves as 'non-naturalists'", while noting that "philosophers concerned with religion tend to be less enthusiastic about 'naturalism'" and that despite an "inevitable" divergence due to its popularity, if more narrowly construed, (to the chagrin of [[John McDowell]], [[David Chalmers]] and [[Jennifer Hornsby]], for example), those not so disqualified remain nonetheless content "to set the bar for 'naturalism' higher".{{sfn|Papineau|2007}}

Philosopher and theologian [[Alvin Plantinga]], a [[evolutionary argument against naturalism|well-known critic of naturalism]] in general, comments: "Naturalism is presumably not a religion. In one very important respect, however, it resembles religion: it can be said to perform the cognitive function of a religion. There is that range of deep human questions to which a religion typically provides an answer ... Like a typical religion, naturalism gives a set of answers to these and similar questions".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Plantinga|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Methodological naturalism===

Metaphysical naturalism is an approach to [[metaphysics]] or [[ontology]], which deals with existence ''per se''. It should not be confused with [[methodological naturalism]], which sees [[empiricism]] as the basis for the scientific method.{{cn|date=March 2018}}

Regarding science and evolution, [[Eugenie C. Scott]], a notable opponent of teaching [[creationism]] or [[intelligent design]] in US public schools, stresses the importance of separating metaphysical from methodological naturalism:
{{quote|If it is important for Americans to learn about science and evolution, decoupling the two forms of naturalism is essential strategy. ... I suggest that scientists can defuse some of the opposition to evolution by first recognizing that the vast majority of Americans are believers, and that most Americans want to retain their faith. It is demonstrable that individuals can retain religious beliefs and still accept evolution as science. Scientists should avoid confusing the methodological naturalism of science with metaphysical naturalism.&lt;ref name="Scott1996"/&gt;|Eugenie C. Scott|"Creationism, Ideology, and Science"}}

===Lack of necessity for worship===

The historian [[Richard Carrier]], in his book ''Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism,'' describes metaphysical naturalism thus: as a philosophy "wherein worship is replaced with curiosity, devotion with diligence, holiness with sincerity, ritual with study, and scripture with the whole world and the whole of human learning". Carrier wrote that it is the naturalist’s duty "to question all things and have a well-grounded faith in what is well-investigated and well-proved, rather than what is merely well-asserted or well-liked".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|p=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Science and naturalism==
{{main article|Uniformitarianism}}
Metaphysical naturalism is the philosophical basis of science as described by Kate and Vitaly (2000) "There are certain philosophical assumptions made at the base of the scientific method — namely, 1) that reality is objective and consistent, 2) that humans have the capacity to perceive reality accurately, and that 3) rational explanations exist for elements of the real world. These assumptions are the basis of naturalism, the philosophy on which science is grounded. Philosophy is at least implicitly at the core of every decision we make or position we take, it is obvious that correct philosophy is a necessity for scientific inquiry to take place."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|A.Sergei|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Steven Schafersman]], agrees that methodological naturalism is "the adoption or assumption of philosophical naturalism within [[scientific method]] with or without fully accepting or believing it ... science is not metaphysical and does not depend on the ultimate truth of any metaphysics for its success, but methodological naturalism must be adopted as a strategy or working hypothesis for science to succeed. We may therefore be agnostic about the ultimate truth of naturalism, but must nevertheless adopt it and investigate nature as if nature is all that there is."{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}}

Contrary to other notable opponents of teaching [[Creationism]] or [[Intelligent Design]] in US public schools such as [[Eugenie Scott]], Schafersman asserts that "while science as a process only requires methodological naturalism, I think that the assumption of methodological naturalism by scientists and others logically and morally entails ontological naturalism".{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}} as well as the similarly controversial assertion: "I maintain that the practice or adoption of methodological naturalism entails a logical and moral belief in ontological naturalism, so they are not logically decoupled."{{sfn|Schafersman|1996}} On the other hand, Scott argues:
{{quote|that a clear distinction must be drawn between science as a way of knowing about the natural world and science as a foundation for philosophical views. One should be taught to our children in school, and the other can optionally be taught to our children at home. Once this view is explained, I have found far more support than disagreement among my university colleagues. Even someone who may disagree with my logic or understanding of philosophy of science often understands the strategic reasons for separating methodological from philosophical [[materialism]]—if we want more Americans to understand evolution.&lt;ref name="Scott1996"&gt;{{cite book |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |year=1996 |chapter="Creationism, Ideology, and Science" |title=The Flight From Science and Reason |publisher=The New York Academy of Sciences, |pages=519–520 |editors=Gross, Levitt, and Lewis}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Scott2008"&gt;{{cite web |last=Scott |first=Eugenie C. |authorlink=Eugenie Scott |year=2008 |url=http://ncse.com/religion/science-religion-methodology-humanism |title=Science and Religion, Methodology and Humanism |publisher=NCSE |accessdate=20 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Eugenie C. Scott|Science and Religion, Methodology and Humanism}} However, there are other controversies, [[Arthur Newell Strahler]] embeds peculiar [[anthropic principle|anthropic]] distinctions in the name of naturalism: "The naturalistic view is that the particular universe we observe came into existence and has operated through all time and in all its parts without the impetus or guidance of any supernatural agency. The naturalistic view is espoused by science as its fundamental assumption."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Strahler|1992|p=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Variously known as [[background independence]], the [[cosmological principle]], the principle of universality, the principle of uniformity, or [[uniformitarianism]], there ''are'' important philosophical assumptions that cannot be derived from nature. As noted by [[Stephen Jay Gould]]: "You cannot go to a rocky outcrop and observe either the constancy of nature's laws or the working of unknown processes.  It works the other way around. You first assume these propositions and "then you go to the out crop of rock."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1987|p=120}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1987|p=119}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The assumption of spatial and temporal invariance of natural laws is by no means unique to geology since it amounts to a warrant for inductive inference which, as Bacon showed nearly four hundred years ago, is the basic mode of reasoning in empirical science. Without assuming this spatial and temporal invariance, we have no basis for extrapolating from the known to the unknown and, therefore, no way of reaching general conclusions from a finite number of observations. (Since the assumption is itself vindicated by induction, it can in no way "prove" the validity of induction—an endeavor virtually abandoned after Hume demonstrated its futility two centuries ago)."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1965|pp=223–228}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gould also notes that natural processes such as Lyell's "uniformity of process" are an assumption: "As such, it is another ''a priori'' assumption shared by all scientists and not a statement about the empirical world."&lt;ref&gt;{{harv|Gould|1984|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such assumptions across time and space are needed for scientists to extrapolate into the unobservable past, according to G.G. Simpson: "Uniformity is an unprovable postulate justified, or indeed required, on two grounds. First, nothing in our incomplete but extensive knowledge of history disagrees with it. Second, only with this postulate is a rational interpretation of history possible, and we are justified in seeking—as scientists we must seek—such a rational interpretation."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1963|pp=24–48}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to R. Hooykaas: "The principle of uniformity is not a law, not a rule established after comparison of facts, but a principle, preceding the observation of facts ... It is the logical principle of parsimony of causes and of economy of scientific notions. By explaining past changes by analogy with present phenomena, a limit is set to conjecture, for there is only one way in which two things are equal, but there are an infinity of ways in which they could be supposed different."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hooykaas|1963|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Various associated beliefs==
Contemporary naturalists possess a wide diversity of beliefs within metaphysical naturalism.  Most metaphysical naturalists have adopted some form of [[materialism]] or [[physicalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Certainly most philosophical naturalists today are materialists[...]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Undesigned universe===
Metaphysical naturalists argue that the scientific facts and theories that we have to explain the origins of the universe provide no evidence for supernatural beings or deities.&lt;ref name=sag&gt;{{cite book |first= Richard |last= Carrier |title= Sense and Goodness without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism |date= 2010-08-09 |publisher= AuthorHouse |location= Bloomington, Indiana |section= Free Preview |accessdate= 2013-12-25 |url=http://bookstore.authorhouse.com/Products/SKU-000406158/Sense-and-Goodness-Without-God.aspx }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Richard Carrier explains:
&lt;blockquote&gt;...no other worldview is directly and substantially supported by any scientific evidence, whereas all scientific evidence so far does support Metaphysical Naturalism, often directly, sometimes substantially. Though naturalism has not yet been proved, it is the best bet going.&lt;ref name=sag/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

One might say that either it has always existed or it had a purely natural origin, being neither created nor designed.

===Abiogenesis and evolution===
Since nature is all there is, and there was once no life, abiogenesis is implied: that life arose spontaneously from natural causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=166–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Carrier, [The Argument from Biogenesis: Probabilities Against a Natural Origin of Life],  ''Biology and Philosophy'' 19.5 (November 2004), pp. 739-64.&lt;/ref&gt; Naturalists reason about ''how'', not ''if'' evolution happened.  They maintain that humanity's existence is not by [[intelligent design]] but rather a natural process of [[emergence]].

===Ethics and meta-ethics===

Some embrace [[virtue ethics]] and many see no compelling argument against [[ethical naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=168–176, 326–327}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=March 2012}}  Some may advocate for a [[Science of morality]].  One example of an attempt to ground a naturalist meta-ethical system is [[Richard Carrier]]'s chapter "Moral Facts Naturally Exist (and Science Could Find Them)" which was peer reviewed by four philosophers.  It sets out to prove a [[Moral realism]] centered around human satisfaction.  [[Alexander Rosenberg]] has expressed a contrary position that naturalists, in general, have to accept [[moral nihilism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rosenberg |first=Alexander |title=The Disenchanted Naturalist’s Guide to Reality |url=http://onthehuman.org/2009/11/the-disenchanted-naturalists-guide-to-reality/ |work=On the Human Forum |publisher=National Humanities Center (United States) |authorlink=Alexander Rosenberg |year=2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226150034/http://onthehuman.org/2009/11/the-disenchanted-naturalists-guide-to-reality/ |archivedate=26 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The mind is a natural phenomenon===

If any variety of metaphysical naturalism is true, any [[mental properties]] that exist are [[causality|caused]] by and [[ontology|ontologically]] dependent upon nature.

Metaphysical naturalists do not believe in a [[soul]] or [[spirit]], nor in [[ghost]]s, and when explaining what constitutes the [[mind]] they rarely appeal to [[substance dualism]]. If one's mind, or rather one's [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and existence as a [[person]], is entirely the product of natural processes, three conclusions follow according to W.T. Stace. First, all mental contents (such as [[idea]]s, [[theories]], [[emotions]], moral and personal [[values]], or [[aesthetic]] response) exist solely as computational constructions of one's brain and genetics, not as things that exist independently of these. Second, damage to the brain (regardless of how) should be of great concern. Third, death or destruction of one's brain cannot be survived, which is to say, all humans are mortal. Stace, however, believes that ecstatic mysticism calls into question the assumption that awareness is impossible without data processing.&lt;ref name="stace3"&gt;Stace, W.T, Mysticism and Philosophy. N.Y.: Macmillan, 1960; reprinted, Los Angeles: Jeremy P. Tarcher, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Utility of reason===
Metaphysical naturalists hold that [[reason]] is the refinement and improvement of naturally evolved faculties. The certitude of deductive logic remains unexplained by this essentially probabilistic view. Nevertheless, naturalists believe anyone who wishes to have more beliefs that are true than are false should seek to perfect and consistently employ their reason in testing and forming beliefs. Empirical methods (especially those of proven use in the sciences) are unsurpassed for discovering the facts of reality, while methods of [[pure reason]] alone can securely discover logical errors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=53–54}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Value of society===
Humans are [[social animals]], which is why humanity developed [[culture]] and [[civilization]]. In terms of evolution, this means that differential reproductive success somehow depended on traits that permit the development and maintenance of a healthy and productive culture and civilization.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

===Ancient and medieval philosophy===
Naturalism was the foundation of two ([[Vaisheshika]], [[Nyaya]]) of the six orthodox schools and one ([[Carvaka]]) heterodox school of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;A Chatterjee (2012), [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/naturalism-india/ Naturalism in Classical Indian Philosophy], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dale Riepe (1996), ''Naturalistic Tradition in Indian Thought, Motilal Banarsidass'', {{ISBN|978-8120812932}}, pp. 227–246&lt;/ref&gt; The Carvaka, Nyaya, Vaisheshika schools originated in the 7th, 6th, and 2nd century BCE, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Oliver Leaman (1999), ''Key Concepts in Eastern Philosophy.'' Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0415173629}}, page 269&lt;/ref&gt;

Western metaphysical naturalism has originated in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. The earliest [[pre-Socratic philosopher]]s, especially the [[Milesian school|Milesians]] ([[Thales]], [[Anaximander]], and [[Anaximenes of Miletus|Anaximenes]]) and the [[atomists]] ([[Leucippus]] and [[Democritus]]), were labeled by their peers and successors "the ''physikoi''" (from the [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] φυσικός or ''physikos'', meaning "natural philosopher," borrowing on the word φύσις or ''[[physis]]'', meaning "nature") because they investigated natural causes, often excluding any role for gods in the creation or operation of the world. This eventually led to fully developed systems such as [[Epicureanism]], which sought to explain everything that exists as the product of atoms falling and swerving in a [[Void (philosophy)|void]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Epicureanism|last=O'Keefe|first=Tim|publisher=University of California Press|year=2010|isbn=|location=|pages=11–13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Aristotle]] surveyed the thought of his predecessors and conceived of nature in a way that charted a middle course between their excesses.&lt;ref&gt;See especially ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'', books I and II.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote |Plato's world of eternal and unchanging [[Theory of Forms|Forms]], imperfectly represented in matter by a divine [[Demiurge|Artisan]], contrasts sharply with the various mechanistic ''[[Weltanschauungen]]'', of which [[atomism]] was, by the fourth century at least, the most prominent… This debate was to persist throughout the ancient world. Atomistic mechanism got a shot in the arm from [[Epicurus]]… while the [[Stoics]] adopted a [[Teleological argument|divine teleology]]…  The choice seems simple: either show how a structured, regular world could arise out of undirected processes, or inject intelligence into the system. This was how Aristotle… when still a young acolyte of Plato, saw matters. [[Cicero]]… preserves Aristotle's own [[Allegory of the cave|cave-image]]: if [[Troglodytae|troglodytes]] were brought on a sudden into the upper world, they would immediately suppose it to have been intelligently arranged. But Aristotle grew to abandon this view; although he believes in a divine being, the [[Unmoved mover|Prime Mover]] is not the [[efficient cause]] of action in the Universe, and plays no part in constructing or arranging it... But, although he rejects the divine Artificer, Aristotle does not resort to a pure mechanism of random forces. Instead he seeks to find a middle way between the two positions, one which relies heavily on the notion of Nature, or ''[[phusis]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cause and Explanation in Ancient Greek Thought |last=Hankinson |first=R. J. |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1997 |isbn=978-0-19-924656-4 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iwfy-n5IWL8C |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

With the rise and dominance of [[Christianity]] in the West and the later spread of [[Islam]], metaphysical naturalism was generally abandoned by intellectuals. Thus, there is little evidence for it in [[medieval philosophy]]. The reintroduction of Aristotle's empirical epistemology as well as previously lost treatises by Greco-Roman natural philosophers which was begun by the medieval [[Scholasticism|Scholastics]] without resulting in any noticeable increase in commitment to naturalism.

===Modern philosophy===
It was not until the [[Early modern philosophy|early modern era of philosophy]] and the [[Age of Enlightenment]] that naturalists like [[Benedict Spinoza]] (who put forward a theory of [[psychophysical parallelism]]), [[David Hume]],&lt;ref&gt;William Edward Morris, [https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/hume/ "David Hume"], [[The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] (May 21, 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt; and the proponents of [[French materialism]] (notably [[Denis Diderot]], [[Julien La Mettrie]], and [[Baron d'Holbach]]) started to emerge again in the 17th and 18th centuries. In this period, some metaphysical naturalists adhered to a distinct doctrine, [[materialism]], which became the dominant category of metaphysical naturalism widely defended until the end of the 19th century.

[[Immanuel Kant]] rejected ([[reductionist]]) materialist positions in metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Immanuel Kant|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/kant/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he was not hostile to naturalism. His [[transcendental philosophy]] is considered to be a form of [[liberal naturalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant, Science, and Human Nature''. Clarendon Press, 2006, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[late modern philosophy]], ''[[Naturphilosophie]]'', a form of [[natural philosophy]], was developed by [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]]&lt;ref name=Beiser&gt;[[Frederick C. Beiser]](2002), ''German Idealism: The Struggle Against Subjectivism 1781-1801'', Harvard university Press, p. 506.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]&lt;ref name=Beiser/&gt; as an attempt to comprehend nature in its totality and to outline its general theoretical structure.

A politicized version of naturalism that has arisen after Hegel was [[Ludwig Feuerbach]],&lt;ref name="NC57"&gt;Nicholas Churchich, ''Marxism and Alienation'', Fairleigh Dickinson University Press, 1990, p. 57: "Although Marx has rejected Feuerbach's abstract materialism," Lenin says that Feuerbach's views "are consistently materialist," implying that Feuerbach's conception of causality is entirely in line with dialectical materialism."&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] and [[Friedrich Engels]]'s [[dialectical materialism]], especially Engels's dialectical philosophy of nature (''[[Dialectics of Nature]]'').

Another notable school of late modern philosophy advocating naturalism was [[German materialism]]: members included [[Ludwig Büchner]], [[Jacob Moleschott]], and [[Karl Vogt]].&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Owen Chadwick, ''The Secularization of the European Mind in the Nineteenth Century'', Cambridge University Press, 1990, p. 165: "During the 1850s German ... scientists conducted a controversy known ... as the materialistic controversy. It was specially associated with the names of Vogt, Moleschott and Büchner" and p. 173: "Frenchmen were surprised to see Büchner and Vogt. ... [T]he French were surprised at German materialism".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Nineteenth Century and After]]'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=8-VXAAAAIAAJ&amp;q= Vol. 151], 1952, p. 227: "the Continental materialism of Moleschott and Buchner&lt;!--[sic]--&gt;".&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary philosophy===
In the early 20th century, [[matter]] was found to be a form of [[energy]] and therefore not fundamental as materialists had assumed. (See [[History of physics]].) In [[contemporary philosophy]], renewed attention to the [[problem of universals]], [[philosophy of mathematics]], the development of [[mathematical logic]], and the post-[[logical positivism|positivist]] revival of [[metaphysics]] and the [[philosophy of religion]], initially by way of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein|Wittgensteinian]] [[linguistic philosophy]], further called the naturalistic paradigm into question. Developments such as these, along with those within science and the [[philosophy of science]] brought new advancements and revisions of naturalistic doctrines by naturalistic philosophers into metaphysics, [[ethics]], the [[philosophy of language]], the [[philosophy of mind]], [[epistemology]], etc., the products of which include [[physicalism]] and [[eliminative materialism]], [[supervenience]], [[causal theory of reference|causal theories of reference]], [[anomalous monism]], [[naturalized epistemology]] (e.g. [[reliabilism]]), [[internalism and externalism]], [[ethical naturalism]], and [[property dualism]], for example.

A politicized version of naturalism that has arisen in contemporary philosophy is [[Ayn Rand]]'s [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivism]]. Objectivism is an expression of [[Capitalism|capitalist]] [[ethical idealism]] within a naturalistic framework.

The current usage of the term naturalism "derives from debates in America in the first half of the last century. The self-proclaimed 'naturalists' from that period included [[John Dewey]], [[Ernest Nagel]], [[Sidney Hook]] and [[Roy Wood Sellars]]."&lt;ref&gt;Papineau, David [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/naturalism/ "Naturalism"], in "The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy"&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, metaphysical naturalism is more widely embraced than in previous centuries, especially but not exclusively in the [[natural science]]s and the Anglo-American, [[analytic philosophy|analytic philosophical]] communities. While the vast majority of the population of the world remains firmly committed to non-naturalistic worldviews, prominent contemporary defenders of naturalism and/or naturalistic theses and doctrines today include [[J. J. C. Smart]], [[David Malet Armstrong]], [[David Papineau]], [[Paul Kurtz]], [[Brian Leiter]], [[Daniel Dennett]], [[Michael Devitt]], [[Fred Dretske]], [[Paul Churchland|Paul]] and [[Patricia Churchland]], [[Mario Bunge]], [[Jonathan Schaffer]], [[Hilary Kornblith]], [[Quentin Smith]], [[Paul Draper (philosopher)|Paul Draper]] and [[Michael Martin (philosopher)|Michael Martin]], among many other academic philosophers.{{cn|date=September 2018}}

According to [[David Papineau]], contemporary naturalism is a consequence of the build-up of scientific evidence during the twentieth century for the "[[causal closure]] of the physical", the doctrine that all physical effects can be accounted for by physical causes.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Papineau]], "The Rise of Physicalism" in ''Physicalism and its Discontents'', Cambridge (2011).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|By the middle of the twentieth century, the acceptance of the causal closure of the physical realm led to even stronger naturalist views. The [[causal closure]] thesis implies that any mental and biological causes must themselves be physically constituted, if they are to produce physical effects. It thus gives rise to a particularly strong form of ontological naturalism, namely the physicalist doctrine that any state that has physical effects must itself be physical.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;From the 1950s onwards, philosophers began to formulate arguments for ontological physicalism. Some of these arguments appealed explicitly to the causal closure of the physical realm (Feigl 1958, Oppenheim and Putnam 1958). In other cases, the reliance on causal closure lay below the surface. However, it is not hard to see that even in these latter cases the causal closure thesis played a crucial role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Papineau |first=David |authorlink=David Papineau |year=2007 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2007/entries/naturalism/#NatPhy |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor=Edward N. Zalta |title=Naturalism |quote= It thus gives rise to a particularly strong form of ontological naturalism, namely the physicalist doctrine that any state that has physical effects must itself be physical.}}&lt;/ref&gt;|David Papineau|"Naturalism" in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''}}

According to [[Steven Schafersman]], president of [[Texas Citizens for Science]], an advocacy group opposing [[creationism]] in public schools,&lt;ref name="Williams 2"&gt;{{cite news |title=The God curriculum  |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2007/04/07/smcreate07.xml&amp;page=2 |publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]] |date=July 4, 2007 |accessdate=2008-12-26 |location=London |first=Sally |last=Williams}}&lt;/ref&gt; the progressive adoption of methodological naturalism—and later of metaphysical naturalism—followed the advances of science and the increase of its [[explanatory power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Naturalism did not exist as a philosophy before the nineteenth century, but only as an occasionally adopted and non-rigorous method among natural philosophers. It is a unique philosophy in that it is not ancient or prior to science, and that it developed largely due to the influence of science.}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advances also caused the diffusion of positions associated with metaphysical naturalism, such as [[existentialism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.stephenjaygould.org/ctrl/schafersman_nat.html| title = Naturalism is Today An Essential Part of Science| first = Steven D.| last = Schafersman|authorlink=Steven Schafersman| year=1996| at= Section "The Origin of Naturalism and Its Relation to Science"| quote= Naturalism is almost unique in that it would not exist as a philosophy without the prior existence of science. It shares this status, in my view, with the philosophy of existentialism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arguments for metaphysical naturalism==

In the context of creation and evolution debates, [[Internet Infidels]] co-founder Jeffery Jay Lowder argues against what he calls "the argument from bias", that ''a priori,'' the supernatural is merely ruled out due to an unexamined stipulation. Lowder believes "there are good empirical reasons for believing that metaphysical naturalism is true, and therefore a denial of the supernatural need not be based upon an ''a priori'' assumption".&lt;ref name="Lowder1999"/&gt;

Richard Carrier argues in ''Sense and Goodness Without God: A Defense of Metaphysical Naturalism'' that Metaphysical Naturalism is true. Topics covered include [[metaphilosophy]],  [[semantics]], [[epistemology]], the nature and [[origin of the universe]] (including a proposal that [[spacetime]] may be the [[ground of all being]] and [[brute fact|a rejection of the logical possibility for any ultimate answer]]),  free will [[compatibilism]], the nature of [[mind]], [[abstract objects]], [[Reductionism#Ontological reductionism|ontological reductionism]], the nature of [[emotions]], the [[meaning of life]], the nature of [[reason]], [[atheism]], [[aesthetics]], [[morality]] (including [[ethical naturalism]] and a recommendation for a [[science of morality]]), and [[politics]].

===Argument from physical minds===

Several Metaphysical Naturalists have used the trends in scientific discoveries about minds to argue that no supernatural minds exist.  For instance, Lowder says, "Since all known mental activity has a physical basis, there are probably no disembodied minds. But God is conceived of as a disembodied mind. Therefore, God probably does not exist."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/library/modern/nontheism/atheism/minds.html |title=Argument from Physical Minds}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lowder argues the correlation between mind and brain implies that supernatural souls do not exist because the theist position, according to Lowder, is that the mind depends upon this soul instead of the brain.&lt;ref name="Lowder1999"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.infidels.org/infidels/newsletter/1999/march.html#Naturalism |date=March 1999 |work=Internet Infidels Newsletter |title=The Empirical Case for Metaphysical Naturalism |first=Jeffery Jay |last=Lowder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cosmological argument for naturalism===

{{quote|[Elegance] goes directly to the question of how the laws of nature are constructed. Nobody knows the answer to that. Nobody! It's a perfectly legitimate hypothesis, in my view, to say that some extremely elegant creator made those laws. But I think if you go down that road, you must have the courage to ask the next question, which is: Where did that creator come from? And where did his, her, or its elegance come from? And if you say it was always there, then why not say that the laws of nature were always there and save a step?&lt;ref name="Sagan2006"&gt;{{cite book |first=C. |last=Sagan |first2=T. |last2=Head |year=2006 |title=Conversations with Carl Sagan |series=Literary Conversations Series |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |isbn=9781578067367 |lccn=2005048747 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gJ1rDj2nR3EC&amp;pg=PR14 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;|[[Carl Sagan]]|''Conversations with Carl Sagan''}}

==Arguments against==

Arguments against metaphysical naturalism include the following examples.

===Evolutionary argument against naturalism===
{{Main article|Evolutionary argument against naturalism}}
[[Alvin Plantinga]] is the John A. O'Brien Professor of Philosophy Emeritus at the University of Notre Dame, and the inaugural holder of the Jellema Chair in Philosophy at Calvin College. He is a [[Christian]], and a well-known critic of naturalism.  He argues, in his [[evolutionary argument against naturalism]], that the probability that evolution has produced humans with [[Reliabilism|reliable true beliefs]], is low or inscrutable, unless their evolution was guided, for example, by God.  According to David Kahan of the [[University of Glasgow]], in order to understand how beliefs are warranted, a justification must be found in the context of [[supernatural]] theism, as in Plantinga's epistemology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |title=Gifford Lecture Series - Warrant and Proper Function 1987-1988 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120104024641/http://www.giffordlectures.org/Browse.asp?PubID=TPWAPF&amp;Cover=TRUE |archivedate=4 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Alvin |last=Plantinga |url=http://chronicle.com/article/Evolution-Shibboleths-and/64990/ |title=Evolution, Shibboleths, and Philosophers — Letters to the Editor |publisher=The Chronicle of Higher Education |date=11 April 2010 |quote=...I do indeed think that evolution functions as a contemporary shibboleth by which to distinguish the ignorant fundamentalist goats from the informed and scientifically literate sheep.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;According to Richard Dawkins, 'It is absolutely safe to say that, if you meet somebody who claims not to believe in evolution, that person is ignorant, stupid, or insane (or wicked, but I'd rather not consider that).' Daniel Dennett goes Dawkins one (or two) further: 'Anyone today who doubts that the variety of life on this planet was produced by a process of evolution is simply ignorant—inexcusably ignorant.' You wake up in the middle of the night; you think, can that whole Darwinian story really be true? Wham! You are inexcusably ignorant.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;I do think that evolution has become a modern idol of the tribe. But of course it doesn't even begin to follow that I think the scientific theory of evolution is false. And I don't.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Alvin |last=Plantinga |title=Warrant and Proper Function |location=Oxford |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=1993 |isbn=0-19-507863-2 |at=Chap. 11}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''(See also [[supernormal stimuli]]).''

Plantinga argues that together, naturalism and evolution provide an insurmountable "''defeater'' for the belief that our cognitive faculties are reliable", i.e., a [[skeptical argument]] along the lines of Descartes' [[evil demon]] or [[brain in a vat]].&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"&gt;{{cite book |first=J.K. |last=Beilby |year=2002 |chapter=Introduction by Alvin Plantinga |title=Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism |series=Reference, Information and Interdisciplinary Subjects Series |location=Ithaca |publisher=Cornell University Press |isbn=978-0-8014-8763-7 |lccn=2001006111 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=p40tc_T7-rMC&amp;pg=PA1 |pages=1–2, 10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Take ''philosophical naturalism'' to be the belief that there aren't any supernatural entities—no such person as God, for example, but also no other supernatural entities, and nothing at all like God. My claim was that naturalism and contemporary evolutionary theory are at serious odds with one another—and this despite the fact that the latter is ordinarily thought to be one of the main pillars supporting the edifice of the former. (Of course I am ''not'' attacking the theory of evolution, or anything in that neighborhood; I am instead attacking the conjunction of ''naturalism'' with the view that human beings have evolved in that way. I see no similar problems with the conjunction of ''theism'' and the idea that human beings have evolved in the way contemporary evolutionary science suggests.) More particularly, I argued that the conjunction of naturalism with the belief that we human beings have evolved in conformity with current evolutionary doctrine... is in a certain interesting way self-defeating or self-referentially incoherent.&lt;ref name="Beilby2002"/&gt;|Alvin Plantinga|"Introduction" in ''Naturalism Defeated?: Essays on Plantinga's Evolutionary Argument Against Naturalism''}}

Branden Fitelson of the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and [[Elliott Sober]] of the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] argue that Plantinga must show that the combination of evolution and naturalism also defeats the more modest claim that "at least a non-negligible minority of our beliefs are true", and that defects such as [[cognitive bias]] are nonetheless consistent with being made in the image of a rational God. Whereas evolutionary science already acknowledges that cognitive processes are unreliable, including the fallibility of the scientific enterprise itself, Plantinga's [[hyperbolic doubt]] is no more a defeater for naturalism than it is for theistic metaphysics founded upon a non-deceiving God who designed the human mind: "[neither] can construct a non-question-begging argument that refutes global skepticism."&lt;ref name = Fitelson&gt;{{cite journal | last = Fitelson | first = Branden | authorlink = Branden Fitelson |author2=[[Elliott Sober]]  |year=1998 | title = Plantinga's Probability Arguments Against Evolutionary Naturalism | journal = Pacific Philosophical Quarterly | volume = 79 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–129 | url = http://fitelson.org/plant.pdf | accessdate = 2007-03-06 | doi = 10.1111/1468-0114.00053 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Plantinga's argument has also been criticized by [[philosophy of mind|philosopher]] [[Daniel Dennett]] and historian [[Richard Carrier]] who argue that a cognitive apparatus for truth-finding can result from natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Carrier|2005|pp=181–188}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antinominalist argument against naturalism===
{{Main article|Theory of Forms|Hylomorphism|Scholasticism}}
[[Edward Feser]], in his 2008 book ''The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism'', lays a plenary case against naturalism by re-examining pre-Modern philosophy. Beginning in the second chapter, Feser cites the [[Plato]]nic&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism, Ch 2, pp. 31-49&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]]&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 2, pp. 53-72&lt;/ref&gt; answers to the [[problem of universals]]—that is, [[Philosophical realism|realism]]. Feser also offers arguments against [[nominalism]].&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition: A Refutation of the New Atheism, Ch 2, pp. 44-46&lt;/ref&gt; And by defending realism and rejecting nominalism, he rejects [[eliminative materialism]]—and thus naturalism.

In the third chapter, Feser summarizes three of [[Thomas Aquinas|Thomas Aquinas's]] arguments for the existence of God.&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 90-119&lt;/ref&gt; These include arguments for an unmoved mover,&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 91-102&lt;/ref&gt; first, uncaused cause &lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 102-110&lt;/ref&gt; and (supernatural) supreme intelligence,&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 110-118&lt;/ref&gt; concluding that these must exist not as a matter of probability—as in the [[intelligent design]] view, particularly of [[irreducible complexity]]&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 110-114&lt;/ref&gt;—but as a necessary consequence of "obvious, though empirical, starting points".&lt;ref&gt;The Last Superstition, Ch 3, pp. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''New Afrikan Black Panther Party''' ('''NABPP''') is a [[Revolutionary socialism|revolutionary socialist]] organization in the [[United States]]. The group is largely based in prison&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Interview with John ‘Mac’ Gaskins, New Afrikan Black Panther Party|url=http://basicsnews.ca/interview-with-john-mac-gaskins-new-afrikan-black-panther-party/|work=Steve da Silva|publisher=BASICS Community News Service|accessdate=November 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and commonly referred to as the '''New Afrikan Black Panther Party – Prison Chapter''' ('''NABPP-PC'''). The party is built as a modern-day continuation of the [[Black Panther Party]] prison chapter developed by [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]] and W. L. Nolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=New Afrikan Black Panther Party-Prison Chapter's 10th Anniversary|url=http://sfbayview.com/2015/12/new-afrikan-black-panther-party-prison-chapters-10th-anniversary/|work=Kelvin Khaysi Canada|publisher=San Francisco Bay View|accessdate=December 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The party largely developed out of a correspondence program with prisoners that supported [[Amerindian]] spirituality. Over time, Tom Watts, the program's leader, developed it into a revolutionary group that branched out to create another group focused on [[African Americans|African American]] culture. Eventually, many factions developed in the group and one came out to be the [[Marxist]] splinter group the New Afrikan Black Panther Party. The party helped organize the other splinter groups and create two subgroups in itself to organize prisoners of all races, the White Panther Organization and the Brown Panther Organization. The party ran a newsletter and often corresponded to prisoners, all run by a single party member. The party still distributes literature in prisons, although it may be censored at times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The New Afrikan Black Panther Party – Prison Chapter : Our Origin, Where We’ve Been, Where We Aim to Go|url=http://rashidmod.com/?p=1069|work=Kevin Rashid Johnson|publisher=rashidmod.com|accessdate=August 11, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founder of the party [[Kevin Rashid Johnson]] has filed several lawsuits achieving prison reforms while in the party and published several political novels and artworks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kevin "Rashid" Johnson &amp; the New Afrikan Black Panther Party-Prison Chapter|url=http://www.kersplebedeb.com/mystuff/profiles/rashid.html|publisher=kersplebedeb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=KEVIN 'RASHID' JOHNSON|url=http://cargocollective.com/storyandpicture/KEVIN-RASHID-JOHNSON|publisher=cargocollective.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rashid has been the victim of violence by prison guards while in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=From bad to worse|url=http://sfbayview.com/2012/01/from-bad-to-worse/|publisher=San Francisco Bay View|accessdate=January 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Order of Parental Glory''' ({{lang-ru|Орден «Родительская Слава»}}) is a state award of the [[Russian Federation]].  It was established on May 13, 2008 by [[Decree of the President of Russia|presidential decree]] 775&lt;ref name="decree775"&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of May 13, 2008 No 775 | publisher = Commission under the President of the Russian Federation on state awards | date = 2008-05-13 | url = http://award.adm.gov.ru/doc/u775.htm | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; to reward deserving parents of exceptionally large families.  It can trace its origins to the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[Mother Heroine|Order "Mother Heroine"]].  The Order's statute was amended on September 7, 2010 by presidential decree 1099,&lt;ref name="decree1099"&gt;{{cite web  | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of September 7, 2010 No 1099 | publisher = Russian Gazette | date = 2010-09-07 | url = http://www.rg.ru/2010/09/15/nagrady-dok.html | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; the same document that established the Medal of the Order of Parental Glory.

== Award statute ==
The Order of Parental Glory is awarded to parents or adoptive parents who are married, in a civil union, or in the case of single-parent families, to one of the parents or adoptive parents who are/is raising, or have raised seven or more children as citizens of the Russian Federation. For leading a healthy family life, being socially responsible, providing an adequate level of health care, education, physical, spiritual and moral development of the children, full and harmonious development of their personality, and setting an example to strengthen the institution of the family and child rearing.&lt;ref name="statuteorder"&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Statute of the Order of Parental Glory | publisher = Commission under the President of the Russian Federation on state awards | date = 2010-09-07 | url = http://award.gov.ru/parents_order.html | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award is made when the seventh child reaches the age of three, and in the presence of the other living children, except in the cases of older children who were killed or missing in action in defence of the Fatherland or its interests, in the performance of military, official or civic duties, who died as a result of injury, concussion or disease received in these circumstances, either because of occupational injury or illness.&lt;ref name="statuteorder"/&gt;

The Russian Federation Order of Precedence dictates that the Order of Parental Glory is to be worn on the left breast with other orders and medals immediately after the [[Order of Friendship]].&lt;ref name="decree1631"&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Decree of the President of the Russian Federation of December 16, 2011 No 1631 | publisher = Russian Gazette | date = 2011-12-16 | url = http://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx?1593594 | language = Russian | accessdate = 2012-02-15 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130331004345/http://graph.document.kremlin.ru/page.aspx?1593594 | archivedate = March 31, 2013 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Award description ==
The badge of the Order is a 70&amp;nbsp;mm wide gilt silver [[cross pattée]], with arms that are flared towards the concave outer ends.  The cross [[obverse]] is enamelled in blue. At its center is a circular red enamelled medallion edged in gold and bearing the gilded [[Coat of arms of Russia|coat of arms of the Russian Federation]].  A green enamelled laurel wreath passes under and near the outer ends of the cross.  Golden rays extend between the cross's arms to the laurel wreath.  The reverse is plain (golden) and bears the award serial number.&lt;ref name="statuteorder"/&gt;

A smaller 40&amp;nbsp;mm wide badge of the Order is also given for wear in special circumstances. The gentlemen's badge is suspended by a ring through the badge suspension loop from a standard Russian pentagonal mount covered by a 24&amp;nbsp;mm wide overlapping white silk [[moiré]] ribbon with two 1,5&amp;nbsp;mm wide light blue stripes situated 8&amp;nbsp;mm from the ribbon outer edge.  The ladies' badge hangs from a bow made of the same ribbon. Both are worn on the left breast.&lt;ref name="statuteorder"/&gt;

==Medal of the Order==
[[File:Medal of the Order of Parental Glory with doc.jpg|thumb|left|Medal of the Order of Parental Glory (woman's variant) with documents]]
The '''Medal of the Order of Parental Glory''' was established on September 7, 2010 by presidential decree 1099.&lt;ref name="decree1099"/&gt;  Its award criteria differ from those of the main Order only in the number of children required.  The Medal of the Order of Parental Glory is awarded for raising four children, as opposed to seven for the Order, and the remainder of the statute is the same.&lt;ref name="statutemedal"&gt;{{cite web | authorlink = Russian Government | title = Statute of the Medal of Parental Glory | publisher = Commission under the President of the Russian Federation on state awards | date = 2010-09-07 | url = http://award.gov.ru/parents_medal.html | language = Russian | accessdate =2012-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Medal of the Order of Parental Glory is made of gilt silver and is 32mm in diameter.  The obverse has a reproduction (without enamels) of the badge of the Order of Parental Glory.  The reverse is plain with the central inscription "FOR RAISING CHILDREN" (Russian: "ЗА ВОСПИТАНИЕ ДЕТЕЙ").  The medal hangs from the same mount and ribbon as the Order's smaller badge destined for wear.&lt;ref name="statutemedal"/&gt;

The Russian Federation Order of Precedence dictates that the Medal of Parental Glory is to be worn on the left breast with other medals immediately after the [[Medal For Merit in Space Exploration|Medal "For Merit in Space Exploration"]].&lt;ref name="decree1631"/&gt;

{{italic title}}
'''''Pacte de Famine''''' ({{IPA-fr|pakt də famin}}, ''Famine Pact'') was a [[conspiracy theory]] adopted by many living in [[France]] during the 18th century. The theory held that foods, especially grain, were purposely withheld from them, for the benefit of privileged interest groups.&lt;ref&gt;Andress 16–18&lt;/ref&gt; During this period French citizens obtained much of their nourishment from grain.&lt;ref name="Kaplan"&gt;Kaplan 1–2, 52&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Courbe du prix du setier de froment à Paris 1700-1788.png|thumb|400px|Price in [[French livre|livres]] of a [[Minot (unit)|''setier'']] (about 117 kg) of [[Common wheat|wheat]] in Paris, 1700–88. ]]
The famine plot has roots in pre-revolutionary France, while some of its strongest manifestations were evident during the 1760s and 1770s. The collective mentality surrounding this conspiracy served as a tool for French citizens to make sense of the political environment at the time.&lt;ref name="Kaplan" /&gt;

Between 1715 and 1789 the population of France increased by 6 million, from 22 million. Population growth and demographic changes during the 18th century help to explain the high demand for food, and lack of food supply at the time. Many faced hunger due to scarcity of food, and found it difficult to fend off illness. At times "bad grain" was blamed for making citizens sick.&lt;ref&gt;Price 25, 27&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anne Robert Jacques Turgot===
From 1715–1774 [[Louis XV]] was the ruling King of [[France]]. During his reign many people faced famine and other struggles, living in a society in need of reform. Louis the XV was criticized for his lack of leadership, which hindered necessary reforms from being made. In 1774 when his successor [[Louis XVI]] took the throne, he worked early on to restore order within the kingdom. One of the first things he did was appoint [[Jacques Turgot]] as the Minister of Finances.&lt;ref&gt;Andress 16&lt;/ref&gt;

Turgot followed members of an early version of free market economics emerging in France at the time, inspired by [[Confucianism|Confucian]] teachings, known as [[Physiocracy]]. The physiocrats, or ''économistes'' as they called themselves, wanted to move away from [[Mercantilism]], and felt it was possible to produce more value from the land. Dr. [[Francois Quesnay]], Dupont de Nemours, and Vincent de Gournay were important pioneers of this movement and had a great impact on Turgot. [[Vincent de Gournay]] was the [[free market]] Intendant for Commerce and he and Turgot spent extensive time together. De Gournay’s opinion on what government economic policy should be was summarized in the term he laid claim to: "laissez faire, laissez passer", meaning leave it alone and let it pass, also known as the "[[invisible hand]]" notion. This economic principle did not favor government regulation and involvement in commerce. Turgot passionately defended Gournay’s belief in "[[laissez-faire]]" economic principles in his writing "Éloge de Gournay".&lt;ref&gt;Hart&lt;/ref&gt;

Before his appointment Turgot acted as Intendant of Limognes from 1761–1774. He had worked to implement free market reforms on a local scale. While acting as the Minister of Finances he worked to implement these reforms on a larger national scale. During his short time in office, Turgot established free trade in grain, worked to rectify the financial situation in France (focusing on industry and agriculture), and reform the system so that feudal privileges no longer existed.&lt;ref&gt;Hart&lt;/ref&gt;

===Guild and grain regulation===
In his efforts to revive the agricultural system, Turgot altered the urban production process. In 1775 he did away with guilds and moved the grain trade to a free trade system, removing police regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Andress 16&lt;/ref&gt;

In 18th century France, the role of police was far more involved than simply upholding the law. Police held responsibility over many systems in society, even street sweeping. The notion at the time was that all systems needed administrative managing, and that only the police could be trusted with keeping them in order. Once the [[guild system]] was transformed, to gain back a sense of control, police made it difficult for business owners to obtain licenses, by making applicants prove themselves "moral and solvent". These were businesses that Turgot had ordered be opened.&lt;ref&gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[guild]] dissolution prompted workers to riot, and social unruliness became a normal state of affairs. Guild members argued that this shift would lead to a more corporate system that would cause people to lose their sense of social identity, and that chaos and instability would result.&lt;ref&gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Changes to grain and bread supply had serious implications, and was met with even more disorder than was seen over the change in the guild system. This conflict was known as the [[Flour War of 1775]]. Reports from those that controlled the flow of grain stated there were problems with the grain harvest which caused shortages and less grain availability. The price of grain also increased, and became hard for some to afford. News of a grain shortage was met with skepticism and frustration rose from higher prices.&lt;ref&gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt;

All tiers of society, including the poor, police, and members of government felt that the disruption of the grain and flour was done not for their sake, but to satisfy the agendas of interest groups, looking to make more money. They felt taken advantage of at the expense of their hunger. Those in opposition of the reform rioted, and seized grain that came in on shipments. They offered what they felt was the “[[just price]]” for it. This demonstrated a way in which the people took some power back into their own hands. This practice was known as “taxation populaire”, or popular taxation.&lt;ref &gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt;

While there were documented efforts to deal with the grain shortage problems, such as increasing shipments from external sources, belief in the famine plot conspiracy remained. Conspiracy propaganda was rampant and quickly spread through the public. It eventually even reached Jacques Turgot, who came to have his own doubts about the situation. He suspected “agitation and bribery by his political rivals”.&lt;ref&gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt;

===A return to order===
The disorder of the period proved to be so great that this economic experiment was stopped, and Turgot ended his career as the Minister of Finances in 1776. From 1775–1776 police returned to regulate the grain trade. Guilds were re-instated as well, but took a new form due to social changes taking place.&lt;ref&gt;Andress 17&lt;/ref&gt;

France would survive these food shortages, and a new era of industrialization would eventually emerge. Agricultural techniques would become more modernized and productivity would increase over the next century, improving the life of many in France.&lt;ref&gt;Price 27&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Pasquale Galluppi''' (2 April 1770 – 13 December 1846) was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[philosopher]].

==Biography and philosophy==
Born at [[Tropea]], [[Calabria]], Galluppi from 1831 he was a professor at the [[University of Naples]], where he died in 1846.

His philosophy is a mixture of assent to and dissent from [[Descartes]], the French and English [[sensist]]s, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]], and the Scottish school of [[Thomas Reid]]. [[Cartesianism]] tempered by the modifications introduced into it by [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Wolff]], and [[Genovesi]], was the system in which Galluppi's mind was trained. The problem of human knowledge was his chief preoccupation. He maintained the [[objective reality]] of our knowledge, which he based on the testimony of [[consciousness]], making us aware not only of our internal experience, but also of the external causes to which it is due. This theory was aimed at Kant, though Galluppi agreed with him that space and time are ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]'' forms in the mind. Against the sensists, he denied that the mind was merely passive or receptive, and held that like a builder it arranged and ordered the materials supplied it, deducing therefrom new truths which sensation alone could never reach. He threw no light, however, on the difference between [[Empirical evidence|sensory]] and intellectual knowledge. This was the great weakness of his argument against the Scottish school, that the soul perceives not only its own affections or the qualities of bodies, but also its own substance and that of things outside itself. It was also natural that Galluppi should be foremost in attacking the theories of [[Antonio Rosmini-Serbati|Rosmini]] concerning the idea of [[God]] as the first object of our knowledge: and it was this [[polemic]] (quiet enough in itself) which drew public attention to the Roveretan philosopher.

The morality of our actions, according to Galluppi, depends on the notion of duty which springs from the very nature of man. He never made use of the phrase "categoric imperative", but everything goes to show that on that point he did not completely escape Kant's influence: and although he asserted as the two great moral commandments "Be just" and "Be beneficent", he nonetheless approved of Kant's moral principle. Hence we do not find in him any hint as to the connection between the moral law and God, beyond the statement that God must reward [[virtue]] and punish [[vice]]. Against the Scottish school, on the other hand, he denied that morality depends on the feelings. His [[theodicy]] is well within the limits of that of Leibniz, and therefore admits not only the possibility of revelation, but also the divinity of [[Christianity]]. The care and clearness of his style made his works very popular; but when the [[Hegel]]ianism of the Neapolitan school became the fashion in non-Catholic circles of thought, and [[Scholasticism]] regained its hold among [[Catholics]], Galluppi's philosophy quickly lost ground. He always kept aloof from political questions; and his works were planned and written in his own home, amidst the noise and bustle of a large and happy family.

==Biography==
Qiji was born Hu Desheng ({{zh|s=胡德生|p=|labels=no}}) in 863, in Zuta Village, [[Weishan Township, Ningxiang County|Weishan Township]], [[Ningxiang]], [[Hunan]], to a family of tenant farmers. At the age of 6, he learned writing while grazed cattle for the Tongdu Temple ({{zh|s=同度寺|p=|labels=no}}) on the mountain. He took refuge in the Three Jewels under the [[Yangshan Huiji]] (807-883). As Adults, he went out to study and travelled to [[Yueyang]], [[Changan]], [[Zhongnan Mountains]], [[Mount Hua]]shan, and [[Jiangxi]]. When he returned to [[Changsha]], Xu Dongye ({{zh|s=徐东野|p=|labels=no}}), a poet in the office of Hunan military governor, said: "The poems we write are not good enough. We can't compare the poems you write." ({{zh|s=我辈所作，皆拘于一途，非所谓通方之士。若齐己，才高思远，无所不通，殆难及矣。|p=|labels=no}})

In 921, Qiji went to [[Sichuan]] via [[Jingzhou]], [[Gao Jixing]] (858-929), formally Prince Wuxin of Chu, urged Qiji to stay at Longxing Temple ({{zh|s=龙兴寺|p=|labels=no}}) and appointed him as abbot. He died at the age of 76 in [[Jiangling County]], [[Jingzhou]], [[Hubei]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author= |url=http://fo.sina.com.cn/culture/tea/2017-06-12/doc-ifyfzhac1418830.shtml |script-title=zh:晚唐诗僧们的诗禅世界 |newspaper=sina |date=2017-06-12 |language=zh}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Quqites''' were a group of people who followed a [[Samaritan]], [[Iranian religions|Iranian]] type of [[Gnosticism]] in 2nd century AD [[Arbil|Erbil]] and vicinity in what is today northern [[Iraq]]. The sect was named after their founder Quq, known as "the potter".

The Quqite heresy arose in Edessa, [[Syria]], in the 2nd century, and it is named for the founder Quq, which means "pitcher", or "jug". The Quqites stressed the [[Hebrew Bible]], made changes in the New Testament, associated twelve prophets with twelve apostles, and held that the latter corresponded to the same number of [[gospels]].

The Jewish Christian group called the Ebionites used a [[Gospel]] of the Twelve, which is considered Quqite, and Marcion may have had some dealing with the Quqites. As late as 410, the Armenian bishop Marutha of Maipherkat included the Quqites in his catalogue of heresies, a document he used as ammunition at the [[Council of Seleucia-Ctesiphon|Synod]] of [[Ctesiphon|Seleukia-Ktesiphon]] in that year. Marutha names several characteristics of the Quqites, none of them reflecting particularly [[Mandaean]] ideas.
A 6th-century presbyter of [[Nisibis]] (Syria), Barhad Besabba, also testifies to the Quqites, who, he says, mixed Chaldean wisdom with the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Great Stem of Souls: Reconstructing Mandaean History |last=Jacobsen Buckley |first= Jorunn|authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2006|publisher= Gorgias Press LLC|location= |isbn= 9781593333386|page= |pages= 337–338|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=b-9yiE-dXhYC&amp;pg=PA338&amp;dq=Quqites&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ie5HTef_O4rFswa128z4Ag&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Quqites&amp;f=false|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quqites: Sect named after their founder Quq, known as "the potter" because his name derives from the Syrian quqa, "pitcher". The Quqites were based around Edessa in Syria in the 2nd and 3rd centuries. Their beliefs seem to have been eclectic, with elements of Judaism, Christianity, paganism, astrology and Gnosticism, and they were listed by Epharaim of Syria along with Valentinians, followers of [[Bardaisan]], and Manichaeans as local heresies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Dictionary of Gnosticism |last= Smith|first= Andrew Phillip |authorlink= |coauthors= |year= 2009|publisher= Quest Books |location= |isbn= 9780835608695|page= 208 |pages= |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Kigg-3Aehp8C&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=Quqites&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=BfNHTfG1FYfAswbGhfGYAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwCA#v=onepage&amp;q=Quqites&amp;f=false|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Shugibukuro-example-japan-feb9-2018.jpg|thumb|An example of a shūgi-bukuro.]]

A {{Nihongo|'''''shūgi-bukuro'''''|祝儀袋}} is a special envelope in which [[money]] is given as a gift at [[Marriage in Japan|weddings in Japan]].&lt;ref&gt;Gordenker, Alice, "[http://search.japantimes.co.jp/cgi-bin/ek20110621wh.html Kinpū]", ''[[Japan Times]]'', 21 June 2011, p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

It is very common in Japan to give a gift of money at weddings. The giver inserts the money into a ''shūgi-bukuro'' on which they have written their name. The ''shūgi-bukuro'' is handed to the receptionist of the [[Wedding reception|reception party]]. ''Shūgi-bukuro'' are sold at supermarkets and stationery stores.

==Amount given==
The amount given in ''shūgi-bukuro'' differs according to the givers relationship to the couple, their social status and the style of venue. In the case of friends or company colleagues, it is usually between [[Yen|¥30,000]] and ¥50,000. In the case of close friends or those in a senior position at the bride or bridegroom’s company, ¥30,000 to ¥50,000 is common, and in the case of relatives, ¥50,000 to ¥100,000 is not unusual.

For married couples that attend the wedding ¥50,000 would be common, as opposed to unmarried couples where each person would give a separate amount say ¥30,000 each.{{citation needed|date=January 2009}}

It is common to give amounts in which the leading digit(s) form an [[Parity (mathematics)|odd]] number, such as ¥30,000 or ¥50,000, in order to symbolize the fact that the newly married couple cannot be divided. When the leading digit forms an even number, as in ¥20,000, the amount is usually given in an odd number of bills (e.g. 1 x ¥10,000 and 2 x ¥5,000).  Amounts in which the leading digit forms a multiple of 4, such as ¥40,000, are not recommended since the number 4 in Japanese can be [[Pronunciation|pronounced]] as ''[[Shi (kana)|shi]]'' which is the same as the pronunciation of the [[Japanese language|Japanese]] word for [[Japanese_superstitions#Numbers|death]]. Likewise, multiples of 9 are avoided because the pronunciation of this number can mean suffering.

This [[Holy Face of Jesus]] devotion dates back to Sister [[Marie of St Peter]], a Carmelite nun in [[Tours]] France who in 1843 reported [[visions of Jesus and Mary]] in which she was urged to spread the devotion to the [[Holy Face of Jesus]], in reparation for the many insults Jesus suffered in his [[Passion (Christianity)|Passion]]. The devotion was further spread from Tours by the efforts of the [[Venerable]] [[Leo Dupont]] (also known as the [[Apostle of the Holy Face]]) who prayed for the establishment of the devotion for 30 years, burning a lamp before a painted image of Jesus. [[Pope Leo XIII]] approved of the devotion in 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Dorthy Scallan. ''The Holy Man of Tours.'' (1990) {{ISBN|0-89555-390-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the first Friday in Lent 1936, Sister [[Maria Pierina]] de Micheli, a nun born near [[Milan]] in Italy, reported a vision in which Jesus told her: 

{{cquote|I will that My Face, which reflects the intimate pains of My Spirit, the suffering and the love of My Heart, be more honored. He who meditates upon Me, consoles Me.}}

In his letter of  27 September 2000 to Cardinal [[Fiorenzo Angelini]], on the occasion of the 50th anniversary of the formation of the order, [[Pope John Paul II]] described the goal of the Benedictine Sisters of the Reparation of the Holy Face as: "The unceasing effort to stand beside the endless crosses on which the Son of God continues to be crucified."&lt;ref name=fiftyyears&gt;[[Pope John Paul II]], [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/letters/2000/documents/hf_jp-ii_let_20001021_riparatrici_en.html Letter to Cardinal Fiorenzo Angelini, for the 50th anniversary of the Benedictine Sisters of Reparation of the Holy Face], 27 September 2000 (Vatican archives)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 Cardinal [[Fiorenzo Angelini]] formed the [[International Institute for Research on the Face of Christ]] in Rome in association with the Sisters of the Reparation of the Holy Face.&lt;ref name=fiftyyears/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1999/october/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_14101999_riparatrici_en.html Vatican website: ''Address of John Paul II to the Benedictine Sisters of the Holy Face'', 14 October 1999]&lt;/ref&gt;

The congregation has houses on several continents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32909">In [[linguistics]], '''sloppy identity''' is an [[Interpretive discussion|interpretive]] property that is found with [[verb phrase]] [[Verb phrase ellipsis|ellipsis]] where the identity of the [[pronoun]] in an [[Elision|elided VP]] (verb phrase) is not identical to the [[Antecedent (grammar)|antecedent]] VP.

For example, English allows VPs to be elided, as in example (1). The elided VP can be interpreted in at least two ways, as follows:
* '''The "strict" reading''': sentence  (1) is  interpreted as (1a), where the pronoun ''his'' denotes the same referent in both the antecedent VP and the elided VP. In (1a), the pronoun ''his'' refers to John in both the first and the second [[clause]]. This is done by assigning the same [[Indexicality|index]] to John and to both the “his”  pronouns.  This is called the “strict identity” reading because the elided VP is interpreted as being identical to the antecedent VP.

* '''The "sloppy" reading''': sentence (1) is interpreted as (1b) where the pronoun ''his'' refers to John in the first clause, but the pronoun ''his'' in the second clause refers to Bob. This is done by assigning a different index to the pronoun ''his'' in the two clauses. In the first clause, the pronoun ''his'' is co-indexed with John, in the second clause, pronoun ''his'' is co-indexed with Bob. This is called the “sloppy identity” reading because the elided VP is not interpreted as identical to the antecedent VP.

 1) ''John scratched his arm and Bob did too.''
 a. '''Strict reading''': ''John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; scratched his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; arm and Bob&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; [scratched his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; arm] too.''
 b. '''Sloppy reading''': ''John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; scratched his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; arm and Bob&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; [scratched his&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; arm] too.''

== History of the concept of "sloppy identity" ==

The discussion of “sloppy identity” amongst linguists dates back to a paper by [[John Robert Ross]] in 1967,&lt;ref name=Sag&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sag|first=I. A.|title=Deletion and Logical Form|journal=PhD Thesis, Massachusetts Institute of Technology|year=1976|publisher=Garland Publishing|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; in which Ross identified the interpretational [[ambiguity]] in the elided Verb Phrase of the previously stated sentence 1) found in the intro. Ross tried, without success, to account for “sloppy” identity using strictly syntactic structural relations, and concluded that his theories predicted too many ambiguities.

A linguist named Lawrence Bouton (1970) was the first to develop a syntactic explanation of VP-Deletion,&lt;ref name=Bouton&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bouton|first=L|title=Antecedent-contained Pro Forms|journal=Papers From the Sixth Regional Meeting of the Chicago Linguistic Society|year=1970|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; commonly referred to by contemporary linguists as [[Verb phrase ellipsis|VP – ellipsis]]. Bouton's theory of VP-Deletion and Ross’ observation of sloppy identity served as an important foundation for linguists to build on.

Many advances followed within the next decade, providing much of the theoretical scaffolding necessary for linguists to address issues of “sloppy identity” up to present day. Most notable of these advances are Lawrence Bouton's VP-Deletion rule (1970),&lt;ref name=Bouton /&gt; [[Barbara Partee]]’s “Derived-VP rule” (1975),&lt;ref name=Partee&gt;{{cite journal|last=Partee|first=B|title=Montague grammar and transformational grammar|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=1975|volume=6|issue=2|pages=203–300}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ivan Sag]]’s “Deletion Approach” (1976), based on the Derived-VP rule. It should be noted that theories beyond Ross's initial discovery have all extended beyond analyses based on observations of structural relations, often using [[logical form (linguistics)|logical form]] and [[phonetic form]] to account of instances of sloppy and strict identity. The deletion (derived VP) approach, in combination with the use of logical form (LF) and phonetic form (PF) components to [[syntax]], is one of the most widely used syntactic analysis of sloppy identity to date.

== Analyses of "sloppy identity" ==

=== Y model ===

[[File:LF PF Y model.tiff|framed|right|Y Model]]

This model represents the interface level of the [[Phonology|phonological]] system and interpretive system that give us judgements of form and meaning of [[Deep structure|D-structure]]. Early theorists seemed to suggest that phonetic form and logical form are two distinct approaches for explaining the derivation of VP ellipsis.

=== The deletion-at-PF (phonetic form) analysis ===
Scholars like [[Noam Chomsky]] (1955),&lt;ref&gt;Chomsky, N. (1955) The logical structure of linguistic theory. Manuscript, Harvard University.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Robert Ross|Ross]] (1969)&lt;ref name=Williams&gt;{{cite journal|last=Williams|first=E. S.|title=Discourse and Logical Form|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=1977|volume=8|issue=1|pages=101–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Ivan Sag|Sag]] (1976)&lt;ref name=Sag /&gt; have suggested the process responsible for VP ellipsis is a syntactic deletion rule applied at the level of PF, this process is named as VP Deletion.

The PF-deletion hypothesis assumes the elided VP is fully syntactically represented but deleted in the phonological component between SPELLOUT and PF. It suggests that VP deletion is the process that generates sloppy identities because [[Binding (linguistics)|co-indexation]] needs to occur with respect to [[Binding (linguistics)|binding conditions]].

Example

  2.i) John will eat his apple, and Sam will [VPØ] too.
  2.ii) [John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; will eat his&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; apple] and [Sam&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; will eat his&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; apple].

Looking at example 2.i), VP deletion is why a null VP is derived. Before deletion, as seen in example 2.ii), the sentence would in fact be read as “John will eat his apple, and Sam will eat his apple too.” The clauses [John will eat his apple] and [Sam will eat his apple] share an identical VP in the sense they have the same [[Constituent (linguistics)|constituent structure]], so the second clause can be deleted because it is identical to its antecedent VP.

Now turning to coindexation, this sentence contains two constituents combined by the [[Conjunction (grammar)|conjunction]] “and”. The clauses are each independent complete sentence structures, so presumably each pronoun would co-index to its referent in its constituent to comply with binding theories. With this co-indexation, illustrated in example 2. ii), a sloppy reading is produced.

However, when considering cases sensitive to binding theories, the expected strict reading of sentence 3) would violate the Binding Principle A. According to this principle, an anaphor must be bound in its binding domain, meaning it must be bound within the same clause as its referent.

 3) John blamed himself and Bill blamed himself

Expected strict reading: 
 3.i) John &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [VP blamed himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;], and Bill&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; [VP blamed himself &lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;]

Expected sloppy reading:
 3.ii) John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [VP blamed himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;], and Bill&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; [VP blamed himself&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;]

[[File:Syntax tree.tiff|framed|center|Syntax Tree for sentence 3.ii)]]

Taking this into consideration, it is observed that strict readings are difficult to be obtained in sentences like this, because if the [[Anaphora (linguistics)|anaphor]] ''himself'' in the elided VP is co-indexed with ‘John’ it would violate Binding Theory A because they are in separate clauses. [[C-command]] relationships are represented by colour coding in the sytnax tree. As depicted in the tree diagram and illustrated in green, ‘John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;’ c-commands 'himself&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;' in the first VP. 'Bill&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;' on the other hand c-commands 'himself&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;' in the second VP, colour coded in orange. Due to binding domains, the [[Determiner phrase|DP]]s closest to the anaphors have to be the ones they bind to and co-index with. Therefore, 'John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;' cannot not c-command the 'himself&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;' in the second VP, as shown through the difference in colour coding. Consequently, Binding Theory A would be violated if the co-indexation of example 2.i) generates a strict reading. Hence, PF-deletion hypothesis generates sloppy readings because it treats the elided VP as identical structures to the antecedent VP and co-indexation is constrained by locality.

=== The copying-at-LF (logical form) analysis ===
According to Carnie,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carnie|first=Andrew|title=Syntax: A generative introduction|year=2013|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons Ltd.|location=Chichester, West Sussex}}&lt;/ref&gt; the sloppy identity problem can be explained using an LF-copying hypothesis. This hypothesis claims that before SPELLOUT, the elided VP has no structure and exists as an empty or null VP (as opposed to the PF-deletion hypothesis, which asserts that the elided VP has structure throughout the derivation). Only by copying structure from the VP antecedent does it have structure at LF. These copying processes occur covertly from SPELLOUT to LF.

According to LF-copying, the ambiguity found in sloppy identity is due to different orderings of the copying rules for pronouns and verbs. Consider the following derivations of the sloppy reading and the strict reading for sentence (4), using the Covert VP-Copying Rule and the Anaphor-Copying Rule:

 4) Calvin will strike himself and Otto will [vp Ø] too.

'''Sloppy reading'''

In the sloppy reading, the VP-copying rule applies first, as can be seen in sentence 5).  The VP-copying rule copies the VP in the antecedent into the empty VP:

Covert VP-copying rule

 5) Calvin will [strike himself] and Otto will [strike himself] too.

Following the VP-copying rule, the anaphor-copying rule applies, as can be seen in sentence 6). The anaphor-copying rule, which is clause-bound, copies [[Noun phrase|NP]]s into anaphors within the same clause:

Covert anaphor-copying rule

 6) Calvin will [strike Calvin] and Otto will [strike Otto] too.

'''Strict reading'''

In the strict reading, the application of these rules occur in the opposite order. Therefore, the anaphor-copying rule is applied first. Due to the fact that the empty VP does not contain an anaphor, the NP “Otto” cannot be copied into it. This process can be seen in sentence 7):

Covert anaphor-copying rule

 7) Calvin will [strike Calvin] and Otto will [vp Ø] too.

Following the anaphor-copying rule, the VP-copying rule applies and produces the sentence in 8):

Covert VP-copying rule

 8) Calvin will [strike Calvin] and Otto will [strike Calvin] too.

The derivation used in this LF copying hypothesis can be found [[Sloppy identity#Interpretative Derived VP Approach|here]].

=== Combination of PF and LF ===

Building on the work of Bouton (1970) and Ross (1969),  Barbara Partee (1975)&lt;ref name=Partee /&gt; developed what has come to be one of the most important and influential approaches to explain VP to date, the ''Derived VP-Rule'', which introduces a null operator at the VP level. Shortly thereafter, Ivan A. Sag (1976)&lt;ref name=Sag /&gt; developed the ''Deletion Derived VP approach'', and Edwin S. Williams (1977)&lt;ref name="Williams"/&gt;  developed the ''Interpretive Derived VP Approach''. These rules are still used by many today.

'''Derived VP-rule:'''&lt;ref name=Partee /&gt;

According to Williams &lt;ref name=Williams /&gt;(1977), the Derived VP Rule converts VPs in surface structure into properties written in lambda notation. This is a very important rule that has been built on over the years to make sense of sloppy identity. This VP-rule is used by many linguists as a foundation for their ellipsis rules.

==== Deletion-derived VP approach:&lt;ref name=Sag /&gt; ====

Ivan Sag proposed two logical forms, one of which the [[coreferential]] pronoun is replaced by a [[bound variable]].&lt;ref name=Sag /&gt; This leads to the rule of semantic interpretation that takes pronouns and changes them into bound variables.&lt;ref name=Sag /&gt; This rule is abbreviated as  Pro→BV, where “Pro” stands for pronoun, and “BV” stands for bound variable.

'''Simple sentence example'''

 9) [Betsy&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; loves her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; dog]

The strict reading of sentence 9) is that “Betsy loves her own dog”. Application of Pro→BV then derives the sentence in 9.i):

 9.i) [Betsy&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; loves her&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;(or x's) dog]

Where her&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; is someone else or x's is anyone else's dog

'''Complex example'''

 10) Betsy&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; loves her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; dog and Sandy&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;  does ∅ too
	
where ∅ = loves her dog

'''Strict reading'''

The strict reading of 10) is "Betsy loves Betsy’s dog and Sandy loves Betsy’s dog as well", which implies that ∅ is a VP that has been deleted. This is represented in the following sentence:

 10.i) Betsy&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; λx (x loves her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; dog) and Sandy λy (y loves her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; dog)

The VPs that are being represented by λx and λy are syntactically identical. For this reason the one that is being c-commanded (λy) can be deleted.

This then forms:

 10.ii) Betsy&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; loves her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; dog and Sandy&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;  does ∅ too

'''Sloppy reading'''

The sloppy reading of this sentence is "Betsy loves Betsy’s dog and Sandy loves Sandy’s dog". That is, both women love their own dog. This is represented in the following sentence:

 10.iii) Betsy&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; λx (x loves her&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; dog) and Sandy&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; λy (y loves her&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; dog)

Since the embedded clauses are identical, the logic of this form is that the variable x must be bound to the same noun phrase in both cases. Therefore, “Betsy” is in the commanding position that determines the interpretation of the second clause.

The Pro → BV rule that converts pronouns into bound variables can be applied to all the pronouns.

This then allows for the sentence in 10.iii) to be:

 10.iv) Betsy&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; λx (x loves x's dog) &amp; Sandy&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; λy (y loves y's dog)

Another way the VP can be syntactically identical is, if λx(A) and λy(B) where every instance of x in A has a corresponding instance of y in B. So, like in the example above, for all instances of x there is a corresponding instance of y and therefore they are identical and the VP that is being c-commanded can be deleted.

===== Step-by-step derivation =====

In Sag's approach, VP Ellipsis is analyzed as a deletion that takes place in between S-structure (Shallow Structure) and PF (Surface Structure). It is claimed that the deleted VP is recoverable at the level of LF due to alphabetic variance holding between two λ-expressions.&lt;ref name=Kitagawa&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kitagawa|first=Yoshihisa|title=Copying Identity|journal=Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory|date=August 1991|volume=9|issue=3|pages=497–536|doi=10.1007/bf00135356}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this deletion approach, the sloppy identity is made possible, first, by the indexing of anaphors, and then by the application of a variable rewriting rule.

The following is a step by step derivation, taking into consideration both phonetic and logical forms, accounting for a sloppy reading of the sentence “John blamed himself, and Bill did too.”

'''LF mapping'''

Deep structure to surface structure:

 11) John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; blamed himself], and Bill&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; blamed himself],too.&lt;ref name= Kitagawa /&gt;

In this sentence, the VP's [blamed himself] are present, but are not yet referencing any subject. In sentence 12), the Derived VP Rule is applied,  rewriting these VP's using lambda notation.

Derived VP Rule

 12) John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; '''λx'''('''x''' blame himself)], Bill&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; '''λy'''('''y''' blame himself)], too.&lt;ref name= Kitagawa /&gt;

The Derived VP Rule has derived two VPs containing separate λ-operators with referential variables bound in each antecedent clause. The next rule, Indexing, co-indexes Anaphors and Pronouns to their subjects.

Indexing

 13) John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; λx(x blame '''him'''&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;)], Bill&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; λy( y blame '''him'''&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;)], too.&lt;ref name= Kitagawa /&gt;

As we see, the anaphors have been co-indexed to their respective NPs. Lastly, The Variable Rewriting Rule replaces pronouns and anaphors with variables in logical form.

Pro--&gt;BV

Logical form:

 14) John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;[&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; λx(x blame x)], Bill&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; λy (y blame y)], too.&lt;ref name= Kitagawa /&gt;

'''PF Mapping'''

Deep Structure to Surface Structure:

 15) John [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; blamed himself], and Bill [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; blame himself], too.&lt;ref name= Kitagawa /&gt;

Here we see that both John and Bill precede the same VP, [blame himself]. It is important to note that any meaning, in this case what Subject the Anaphor “himself” references, is determined at LF, and thus left out of phonetic form.

VP-deletion

 16) John [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; blamed himself], and Bill  ____, too.&lt;ref name= Kitagawa /&gt;

VP Deletion occurs, which in effect deletes the VP [blame himself] from the second clause Bill [blame himeself]. Again, it is important to keep in mind that this deletion occurs strictly at the phonetic level, and thus [blame himself] still exists in the LF component, despite it being deleted in PF.

Do-support

Phonetic form:

 17) John [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt; blamed himself], and Bill '''did'''____, too.&lt;ref name= Kitagawa /&gt;

Lastly, Do-Support is implemented, filling the empty space created by VP Deletion with ''did''. This is the last step that occurs in PF, leaving the sentence to be phonetically realized as “John blamed himself, and Bill did too.” Due to the rules enacted in the LF component of the derivation, although did has phonetically replaced the VP [blame himself], its meaning is the same as what was established at LF. Thus, “Bill did too” can be sloppily interpreted as “Bill blamed himself”, as in “Bill blamed Bill”.

==== Interpretative-derived VP approach ====

In his approach to the sloppy identity problem, Williams (1977) adopts the Derived VP Rule as well.&lt;ref name=Lobeck&gt;{{cite book|last=Lobeck|first=A|title=Ellipsis: Functional heads, licensing, and identification|year=1995|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also suggests that anaphors and pronouns are rewritten as variables at LF by a Variable Rewriting Rule. Afterwards, by using the VP Rule, these variables are then copied into the elided VP. Following this approach, both the sloppy and strict readings are possible. The following examples will go through the derivation of sentence 18.i) as a sloppy reading:

'''Sloppy reading'''

 18.i) John visits his children on Sunday and Bill does [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;∅] too.&lt;ref name= Lobeck /&gt;

As can be seen in this sentence, the VP contains no structure. In sentence 19.i), the Derived VP Rule, which re-writes the VP using lambda notation, is applied:

Derived VP Rule
 19.i) John [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;λx (x visits his children)] and Bill does [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;∅] too.&lt;ref name= Lobeck /&gt;

Next, the Variable Rewriting Rule transforms pronouns and anaphors into variables at LF:

Variable Rewriting Rule
 20.i) John [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;λx (x visits x's children)] and Bill does [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;∅] too.&lt;ref name= Lobeck /&gt;

The VP Rule then copies the VP structure into the elided VP:

VP Rule
 21.i) John [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;λx (x visits x's children)] and Bill does [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;λx (x visits x's children)] too.&lt;ref name= Lobeck /&gt;

The main difference between the sloppy and the strict reading lies in the Variable Rewriting Rule. The presence of this rule allows for a sloppy reading because variables are bound by the lambda operator within the same VP. By converting the pronoun ''his'' in 20.i) into a variable, and once the VP is copied into the elided VP in sentence 21.i), the variable in the elided VP is then able to be bound by Bill. Therefore, in order to derive the strict reading, this step is simply omitted.

'''Strict Reading'''

 18.ii) John visits his children on Sunday and Bill does [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;∅] too.

The VP is rewritten using lambda notation:

Derived VP Rule
 19.ii) John [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;λx (x visits his children)] and Bill does [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;∅] too.

The VP structure is copied into the elided VP:

VP Rule
 21.ii) John [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;λx (x visits his children)] and Bill does [&lt;sub&gt;VP&lt;/sub&gt;λx (x visits his children)] too.

Due to the fact the pronoun ''his'' is already co-indexed with John, and it was not rewritten as a variable before being copied into the elided VP, there is no way for it to be bound by Bill. Therefore, the strict reading is thus derived by omitting the Variable Rewriting Rule.

=== Centering shift theory ===

The idea of ‘centering’, also known as ‘focusing’, has been discussed by numerous linguists, such as A. Joshi, S. Weinstein, and B. Grosz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Grosz|first1=Barbara|last2=Joshi|first2=A.|last3=Weinstein|first3=S.|title=Centering: A framework for modeling the Local Coherence of Discourse|journal=Computational Linguistics|year=1995|volume=21|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This theory is based on the assumption that in conversation both participants share a psychological focus towards an entity that is central to their discourse. Hardt (2003),&lt;ref name=Hardt /&gt; using this centering theoretical approach, suggests that in discourse, a shift of the focus from one entity to another makes it possible for sloppy readings to occur.

In the following two examples, the [[superscript]] * represents the current focus of discourse, while the [[subscript]] * signifies an entity which is in reference to the focus of discourse. Consider the following two examples:

'''Strict reading''' [[File:Strict centering tree.tiff|thumbnail|Tree for Centering Theory's strict reading]]

 22) John* scratched his&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; arm and Bob scratched his&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; arm

In the example above, there is no shift from the initial focus, thus the strict meaning arises, where both John and Bob scratched John's arm as John is where the focus is established and remains throughout discourse. Conversely, a shift in focus away from the initial discourse focus, like in the example below, gives rise to a sloppy reading.

'''Sloppy Reading''' [[File:Sloppy centering tree.tiff|thumbnail|Tree for Centering Theory's sloppy reading]]

 23) John* scratched his&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; arm and Bob* scratched his&lt;sub&gt;*&lt;/sub&gt; arm

 
Now the sloppy reading of the sentence arises, where John scratched his arm (John's arm) and Bob scratched his arm (Bob's arm). The shift in focus has included Bob as the primary noun and this allows the pronoun ''his'' to refer to its closest superscript *, in this case, Bob.

It must be noted that this is a simplified explanation of Centering Theory. This approach can be further explored in Hardt's 2003&lt;ref name=Hardt&gt;{{cite web|last=Hardt|first=D.|title=Sloppy Identity, Binding, and Centering|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/85633705?accountid=14656|work=Proceedings from Semantics and Linguistics Theory|pages=109–126|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; paper. Although beyond the scope of this discussion, Hardt's use of Centering Theory may also explain the two pronoun ellipsis puzzle and two pronoun attitude puzzle, two puzzles which prior to Centering Theory could not be properly accounted for.

== Cross-linguistic implications of sloppy identity ==

Instances of sloppy identity have been observed across multiple languages, however, the majority of research has centered on instances of sloppy identity occurring in English. Cross linguistically, sloppy identity is analyzed as a universal problem, found in the basic underlying syntactic structure that all languages share.  For non-English examples and analyses of sloppy identity, such as [[Japanese language|Japanese]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hoji|first=H|title=Null object and Sloppy Identity in Japanese|journal=Linguistic Inquiry|year=1998|volume=29|issue=1|pages=127–152|doi=10.1162/002438998553680}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Korean language|Korean]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kim|first=S|title=Sloppy/Strict identity, empty objects, and NP ellipsis|journal=journal of East Asian Linguistics|year=1999|volume=8|issue=4|pages=255–284}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Chinese language|Chinese]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lust|first=B |author2=F. Guo |author3=C. Foley |author4=Y. Chien |author5=C. Chiang|title=Operator-variable binding in the initial state: A cross-linguistic study of VP ellipsis structures in Chinese and English|journal=Cahiers de Linguistique Asie Orientale|year=1996|volume=25|issue=1|pages=3–34}}&lt;/ref&gt; see the following articles in the references section below. An in-depth explanation of sloppy identity in Mandarin also follows.
== Sloppy identity in Mandarin ==
=== Shì-support (是) ===
In the generative framework, it has been argued that the overt counterpart of ''do''-support in English is the ''shì''-support in Modern Mandarin. 
Similar to the ''do''-support, ''shì''-support can allow constructions that are not fully developed. 

Example 

  1. Zhangsan  xihuan    ta-de didi.           Lisi ye    shi.
     Zhangsan  like      his   younger-brother Lisi also  be 
    'Zhangsan likes his younger brother; Lisi does, too'

Expected strict reading:
   1. i) Zhangsan likes his younger brother, and Lisi also likes Zhangsan's younger brother. 

Expected sloppy reading:
   1. ii) Zhangsan likes his younger brother, and Lisi likes his own younger brother. 

As (1) indicates, both the strict and sloppy readings are equally available, similar to the case in English. 


Though ''shì''-support can substitute state verbs in Modern Mandarin, such as "xihuan" (like), it is not compatible with all verb types. 
For example, activity verbs standing alone are not always compatible with ''shì''-support. 

Example 
    2.  Zhangsan piping-le      ta-de didi.               ?/?? Lisi ye   shi.
        Zhangsan criticize-Asp. his   younger-brother          Lisi also be 
       ‘Zhangsan criticized his younger brother; Lisi did, too.’

Expected strict reading: 
    2.i) Zhangsan criticized his own younger brother. ?Lisi also criticized Zhangsan's younger brother. 

Expected sloppy reading: 
    2.ii) Zhangsan criticized his own younger brother. ?? Lisi criticized his own younger brother. 

As (2) indicates, both the strict and sloppy readings are equally available, however, the judgement of the sentences above can vary between native speakers of Modern Mandarin.

To improve the overall acceptability of the strict and sloppy reading of (2), Ai (2014) added adverbials to the antecedent clause. 

Example: 
    3. Zhangsan henhen-de      piping-le      ta-de didi.           Lisi ye   shi. 
       Zhangsan vigorously-DE  criticize-Asp. his   younger-brother Lisi also be 
      ‘Zhangsan criticized his younger brother vigorously; Lisi did, too.’

Expected strict reading: 
    3.i)  Zhangshan criticized his younger brother vigorously.
          ??Lisi also criticized Zhangshan's brother vigorously. 

Expected sloppy reading: 
    3.ii) Zhangsan criticized his younger brother vigorously.
          ? Lisi criticized his own younger brother vigorously. 

As (3) indicates, both the strict and sloppy readings are equally available, however according to the aforementioned survey, native speakers of Modern Mandarin still prefer the sloppy reading over the strict one. It is questionable to analyze (3)  based on addition of adverbials according to the diagnostic of equal distribution in both the strict and sloppy reading.

==== Negation in shi-support==== 
Negation in shi-support and negation in English do-support do not function identically.
When preceded by the negative ''bu'' (not), shi-support is not grammatical, regardless if the linguistic antecedent is affirmative or negative.

Example&lt;ref&gt;Soh, Hooi Ling (2007). "Ellipsis, Last Resort, and the Dummy Auxiliary shi 'Be' in Mandarin Chinese". Linguistic Inquiry. 180-181&lt;/ref&gt;: 
    4.*Ta xihuan  Zhangsan.  Wo  bu-shi 
      he  like 	 Zhangsan   I   not-be
     "He likes Zhangsan. I don't." 

    5. *Ta bu-xihuan Zhangsan.   Wo ye   bu-shi
       he  not-like  Zhangsan 	I  also not-be
      "He doesn't like Zhangsan. I also don't." 

However, if the linguistic antecedent is negative, a negative reading can be provided by the shi-support, even though the shi-support is not preceded by the negative ''bu'' (not). 

Example: 
    6. Ta bu-xihuan Zhangsan. Wo ye     shi.
       he not-like  Zhangsan  I  also 	be 
      "He does not like Zhangsan. I don't either."

====Questions in shi-support====
Additionally, questions in shi-support and in English do-support do not function identically.
''Shi'' may not license ellipsis when the linguistic antecedent occurs in a question.

Example:
    7. A: Shei xihuan   Zhangsan? 
          who like      Zhangsan 
          "Who likes Zhangsan?"
       B: *Wo shi 
          I  be
          "I do."


===Mandarin Sluicing=== 

The three essential properties of sloppy identity in Mandarin sluicing include:  
(1) c-commanding (2) lexical identity between wh-words and (3) na ‘that’ effect. 

====C-commanding==== 
Ross (1967) proposed that for an elided expression to have a sloppy identity, a pronoun relating to the reading must be c-commanded by its antecedent, as demonstrated in (8a). Otherwise, the sloppy identity is not available, as in (8b). Mandarin sluicing follows this constraint in (9). 

Example&lt;ref&gt;Wei, Ting-Chi (2009). "Some Notes on Sloppy Identity in Mandarin Sluicing". Concentric: Studies in Linguistics. 272&lt;/ref&gt; 
    8a. John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; knows why he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was scolded, and Mary knows why, too. 

Expected strict reading: 
    8a. i) John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; knows why he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was scolded, and Mary&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; knows why he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was scolded. 

Expected sloppy reading: 
    8a. ii) John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; knows why he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was scolded, and Mary&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; knows why she&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; was scolded.   


Example 
    8b. John's mother knows why he was scolded, and Mary's mother knows why, too. 

Expected strict reading: 
    8b. i) ‘John&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;’s mother knows why he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was scolded, and Mary’s mother knows why he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was scolded.’

Expected sloppy reading: 
    8b. ii) * ‘John’s mother knows why he was scolded, and Mary’s mother knows why she was scolded.’

Example 
    9a. Zhangsan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; bu  zhidao [ ta&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; weishenme bei     ma],  dan Lisi&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; zhidao (shi) weishenme
        Zhangsan  not know     he  why       PASS   scold  but Lisi  know   be    why 
        "Zhangsan didn’t know why he was scolded but Lisi knows why."

Expected strict reading: 
    9a. i) Zhangsan didn’t know why he was scolded but Lisi knows why Zhangsan was scolded. 

Expected sloppy reading: 
    9a. ii) Zhangsan&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; didn’t know why he&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; was scolded but Lisi&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; knows why he&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt; was scolded.  

Example 
    9b. [Zhangsan-de   muqin] zhidao ta weishenme bei  ma,   dan [ Lisi-de   muqin] bu zhidao ( shi ) weishenme.  
        Zhangsan-POSS mother know   he why       PASS scold but   Lisi-POSS mother not know    be      why 
        "Zhangsan’s mother knows why he was scolded, but Lisi’s mother does not know why”

Expected strict reading: 
    9b. i) Zhangsan's mother knows why he was scolded but Lisi's mother does not know why Zhangsan was scolded. 

Expected sloppy reading: 
    9b. ii) *Zhangsan's mother knows why he was scolded, but Lisi's mother does not know why Lisi was scolded.

====Lexical entry between wh-words====

To derive sloppy identity, “lexical” identity is required between the overt wh-correlate and the wh-remnant, independent of argument-adjunct distinction. This is also the case for Mandarin sluicing, for wh-adjunct identity in (9a) and wh-argument identity in (10). 

Example&lt;ref&gt;Wei, Ting-Chi (2009). "Some Notes on Sloppy Identity in Mandarin Sluicing". Concentric: Studies in Linguistics. 272&lt;/ref&gt;
    10.  Zhangsan zhidao [ shei zai       piping    tai], dan Lisi  bu  zhidao shi shei. 
         Zhangsan know     who  PROG      criticize him   but Lisi  not know   be  who 
         ‘Zhangsan knows who is criticizing him, but Lisi doesn’t know who.’

Expected strict reading: 
    10. i) Zhangsan knows who is criticizing him, but Lisi doesn’t know who is criticizing Zhangsan. 

Expected sloppy reading:  
    10. ii) Zhangsan knows who is criticizing him, but Lisi doesn’t know who is criticizing himself. 

Given these lexical identity restrictions, the derivation of the sloppy identity reading predicts that wh-antecedent is required to be overtly present, otherwise only the strict reading allowed.

'''María Teresa Giménez Barbat''' (born 4 June 1955 in Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain) is a Spanish [[anthropologist]], writer and politician. She advocates [[secular humanism]], rationalist universalism and [[scepticism]]. She writes in two languages, [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Catalan language|Catalan]]. She is member of the Spanish political party [[Union, Progress and Democracy]] (UPyD) and has participated in anti-nationalist movements before in [[Catalonia]].

== Biography ==
[[File:Teresa gimenez barbat.jpg|thumb|Teresa Giménez Barbat]]
She studied at the [[University of Barcelona]], where she received a degree in anthropology. In 2008 she promoted the  "Third Culture" association, and in 2009 "Secular Humanism Forum" dedicated to promote an ethic independent of religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humanismosecular.com/?p=1220 Presentación del Foro Humanismo Secular]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 she was a member of the directorate of the political party [[Citizens of Catalonia]], a new non-nationalist party. When UPyD was created with similar ideology, she joined the new formation, and since 2012, was a member of the directorate of the party in Catalonia. She was fifth in the UPyD list of candidates in the [[European Parliament election, 2009 (Spain)|2009 European Parliament Election]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2009/06/02/barcelona/1243927227.html Entrevista en ''El Mundo'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The book is a collection of papers "prepared on different occasions as lectures for non-specialist audiences" (p. x).  

The author formulates a premise for the book as:  ''I may be wrong and you may be right, and by an effort, we may get nearer to the truth'' (p. [https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=qTBpAwAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false xii]).

{{Immanuel Kant}}
'''Transcendental idealism''' is a doctrine founded by German [[philosophy|philosopher]] [[Immanuel Kant]] in the 18th century. Kant's doctrine maintains that human experience of things is similar to the way they [[phenomenon|appear to us]]—implying a fundamentally subject-based component, rather than being an activity that directly (and therefore without any obvious causal link) comprehends the things as they are [[thing-in-itself|in themselves]]. The doctrine is most commonly presented as the idea that time and space are just human perceptions; they are not necessarily real concepts, just a medium through which humans internalize the universe.
==Background==
Although it influenced the course of subsequent [[German philosophy]] dramatically, exactly how to interpret this concept was a subject of some debate among 20th century philosophers. Kant first describes it in his ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'', and distinguished his view from contemporary views of [[Philosophical realism|realism]] and [[idealism]], but philosophers do not agree how sharply Kant differs from each of these positions.

Transcendental idealism is associated with ''formalistic idealism'' on the basis of passages from Kant's ''[[Prolegomena to any Future Metaphysics]]'', although recent research has tended to dispute this identification. Transcendental idealism was also adopted as a label by the subsequent German philosophers [[Johann Gottlieb Fichte]] and [[Friedrich Wilhelm Joseph von Schelling]], [[Arthur Schopenhauer]], and in the early 20th century by [[Edmund Husserl]] in the novel form of transcendental-phenomenological idealism.

==Kant==
Kant presents an account of how we intuit ({{lang-de|anschauen}}) objects and accounts of space and of time. Before Kant, some thinkers, such as Leibniz, had come to the conclusion that space and time were not things, but only the relations among things. Other thinkers, including Newton, maintained that space and time were real things or substances. Leibniz had arrived at a radically different understanding of the universe and the things found in it. According to his ''[[Monadology]]'', all things that humans ordinarily understand as interactions between and relations among individuals (such as their relative positions in space and time) have their being in the mind of God but not in the Universe where we perceive them to be. In the view of realists, individual things interact by physical connection and the relations among things are mediated by physical processes that connect them to human brains and give humans a determinate chain of action to them and correct knowledge of them. Kant was aware of problems with both of these positions. He had been influenced by the physics of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and understood that there is a physical chain of interactions between things perceived and the one who perceives them.  However, an important function of mind is to structure incoming data and to process it in ways that make it other than a simple mapping of outside data.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Martin, ''Kant's Metaphysics and Theory of Science'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1955), p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Quotation|If we try to keep within the framework of what can be proved by the Kantian argument, we can say that it is possible to demonstrate the empirical reality of space and time, that is to say, the objective validity of all spatial and temporal properties in mathematics and physics. But this empirical reality involves transcendental ideality; space and time are forms of human intuition, and they can only be proved valid for things as they appear to us and not for things as they are in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Gottfried Martin, ''Kant's Metaphysics and Theory of Science'' (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1955), p. 41.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The salient element here is that space and time, rather than being real ''things-in-themselves'' or empirically mediated appearances ({{lang-de|Erscheinungen}}), are the very forms of intuition ({{lang-de|Anschauung}}) by which we must perceive objects. They are hence neither to be considered properties that we may attribute to objects in perceiving them, nor substantial entities of themselves. They are in that sense subjective, yet necessary, preconditions of any given object insofar as this object is an appearance and not a ''thing-in-itself''. Humans necessarily perceive objects as located in space and in time.  This condition of experience is part of what it means for a human to cognize an object, to perceive and understand it as something both spatial and temporal:  "By ''transcendental idealism'' I mean the doctrine that appearances are to be regarded as being, one and all, representations only, not things in themselves, and that time and space are therefore only sensible forms of our intuition&amp;hellip;"&lt;ref&gt;''Immanuel Kant's Critique of Pure Reason'', trans. Norman Kemp Smith (London: Macmillan, 1933), p. 345 (A 369).&lt;/ref&gt; Kant argues for these several claims in the section of the ''Critique of Pure Reason'' entitled the "Transcendental Aesthetic".  That section is devoted to inquiry into the [[A priori and a posteriori|''a priori'']] conditions of human sensibility, i.e. the faculty by which humans intuit objects.  The following section, the "Transcendental Logic", concerns itself with the manner in which objects are thought.

==Historical parallels==
[[Xenophanes]] of Colophon in 530 BC anticipated Kant's epistemology in his reflections on certainty. "And as for certain truth, no man has seen it, nor will there ever be a man who knows about the gods and about all the things I mention. For if he succeeds to the full in saying what is completely true, he himself is nevertheless unaware of it; and Opinion (seeming) is fixed by fate upon all things."&lt;ref&gt;Kathleen Freeman, ''Ancilla to the Presocratic Philosophers'', Xenophanes fragment 34.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Certain interpretations of some of the medieval Buddhists of India, such as [[Dharmakirti]], may reveal them to be transcendental idealists, since they seemed to hold the position of [[mereological nihilism]] but transcendental idealists who held that their minds were distinct from the [[atoms]].  Some Buddhists often attempt to maintain that the minds are equal to the atoms of mereological nihilist reality, but Buddhists seem to have no explanation of how this is the case, and much of the literature on the aforementioned Buddhists involves straightforward discussion of atoms and minds as if they are separate.  This makes their position very similar to transcendental idealism, resembling Kant's philosophy where there are only things-in-themselves (which are very much like [[atomism|philosophical atoms]]), and phenomenal properties.

==Schopenhauer==
Briefly, Schopenhauer described transcendental idealism as a "distinction between the phenomenon and the thing in itself", and a recognition that only the phenomenon is accessible to us because "we know neither ourselves nor things as they are in themselves, but merely as they appear."&lt;ref&gt;''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Vol. 2, "Sketch of a History of the Doctrine of the Ideal and the Real."&lt;/ref&gt; Some of [[Schopenhauer]]'s comments on the definition of the word "transcendental" are as follows: {{Quotation|''Transcendental'' is the philosophy that makes us aware of the fact that the first and essential laws of this world that are presented to us are rooted in our brain and are therefore known ''[[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]]''. It is called ''transcendental'' because it ''goes beyond'' the whole given phantasmagoria to the origin thereof. Therefore, as I have said, only the ''[[Critique of Pure Reason]]'' and generally the critical (that is to say, [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]]ian) philosophy are transcendental. |''Parerga and Paralipomena'', Volume I, "Fragments for the History of Philosophy," § 13}}

Schopenhauer contrasted Kant's transcendental critical philosophy with Leibniz's dogmatic philosophy. {{Quotation|With Kant the ''critical philosophy'' appeared as the opponent of this entire method [of dogmatic philosophy]. It makes its problem just those eternal truths (principle of contradiction, principle of sufficient reason) that serve as the foundation of every such dogmatic structure, investigates their origin, and then finds this to be in man's head. Here they spring from the forms properly belonging to it, which it carries in itself for the purpose of perceiving and apprehending the objective world. Thus here in the brain is the quarry furnishing the material for that proud, dogmatic structure. Now because the critical philosophy, in order to reach this result, had to go ''beyond'' the eternal truths, on which all the previous dogmatism was based, so as to make these truths themselves the subject of investigation, it became ''transcendental'' philosophy. From this it follows also that the objective world as we know it does not belong to the true being of things-in-themselves, but is its mere ''phenomenon'', conditioned by those very forms that lie ''a priori'' in the human intellect (i.e., the brain); hence the world cannot contain anything but phenomena.| ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. I, Appendix: "[[Criticism of the Kantian Philosophy]]"}}

==P. F. Strawson==
In ''[[The Bounds of Sense]]'', [[P. F. Strawson]] suggests a reading of Kant's first ''Critique'' that, once accepted, forces rejection of most of the original arguments, including transcendental idealism. Strawson contends that, if Kant had followed out the implications of all that he said, he would have seen that there were many self-contradictions implicit in the whole.

Strawson views the analytic argument of the ''transcendental deduction'' as the most valuable idea in the text, and regards transcendental idealism as an unavoidable error in Kant's greatly productive system. In Strawson's traditional reading (also favored in the work of [[Paul Guyer]] and [[Rae Langton]]), the Kantian term [[phenomena]] (literally something that can be seen from the [[Greek language|Greek]] word ''phainomenon'', "observable") refers to the world of appearances, or the world of "things" sensed. They are tagged as "phenomena" to remind the reader that humans confuse these derivative appearances with whatever may be the forever unavailable "things in themselves" behind our perceptions. The necessary preconditions of experience, the components that humans bring to their apprehending of the world, the forms of perception such as [[space and time]], are what make ''a priori'' judgments possible, but all of this process of comprehending what lies fundamental to human experience fails to bring anyone beyond the inherent limits of human sensibility. Kant's system requires the existence of [[noumenon|noumena]] to prevent a rejection of external reality altogether, and it is this concept (senseless objects of which we can have no real understanding) to which Strawson objects in his book.

==Henry E. Allison==
In ''Kant's Transcendental Idealism'', [[Henry E. Allison]] proposes a reading that opposes Strawson's interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Allison, H. E., ''Kant's Transcendental Idealism'' ([[New Haven]]: [[Yale University Press]], 1983); [http://www.morelightinmasonry.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Kant/Allison-Kants-Transcendental-Idealism.pdf Revised and Enlarged Edition, 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; Allison argues that Strawson and others misrepresent Kant by emphasising what has become known as the two-worlds reading (a view developed by [[Paul Guyer]]). This—according to Allison, false—reading of Kant's phenomena/noumena distinction suggests that phenomena and noumena are ontologically distinct from each other. It concludes on that basis that we somehow fall short of knowing the noumena due to the nature of the very means by which we comprehend them. On such a reading, Kant would himself commit the very fallacies he attributes to the [[Transcendental realism (Schopenhauer)|transcendental realists]]. On Allison's reading, Kant's view is better characterized as a two-aspect theory, where noumena and phenomena refer to complementary ways of considering an object. It is the dialectic character of knowing, rather than [[epistemology|epistemological]] insufficiency, that Kant wanted most to assert.

==Opposing views: Realism==
Opposing Kantian transcendental idealism is the doctrine of [[philosophical realism]], that is, the proposition that the world is knowable as it really is, without any consideration of the knower's manner of knowing. This has been propounded by philosophers such as [[Bertrand Russell]], [[George Edward Moore|G. E. Moore]], [[Ralph Barton Perry]], and [[Henry Babcock Veatch]]. Realism claims, contrary to idealism, that perceived objects exist in the way that they appear, in and of themselves, independent of a knowing spectator's mind.

{{Italic title|reason=[[:Category:Japanese words and phrases]]}}
{{Nihongo|'''''Tō-on'''''|唐音||"[[Tang dynasty|Tang]] sound"}}, also pronounced "'''tō-in'''", are [[Japanese language|Japanese]] [[kanji]] readings imported from [[China]] by [[Zen]] monks and merchants during and after the [[Song dynasty]]. This period roughly corresponds with the mid-[[Heian period|Heian]] to [[Edo period]]s of Japan.  During the [[Muromachi period]], they were referred to as {{Nihongo|"'''sō-on'''"|宋音||"Song sound"}}.  Together, they are collectively known as {{Nihongo|"'''tōsō-on'''"|唐宋音}}.  

Scholars divide tō-on into two groups: those that are based on Zen of the Middle Ages, and those based on the [[Ōbaku]] school of Buddhism of the Middle Ages.  The latter are the readings sometimes referred to as "sō-on".

Tō-on readings are not systematic, as they were introduced piecemeal from China, often along with very specialized terminology.

Examples of words and characters using tō-on readings include: {{Nihongo|chair|椅子|isu}}, {{Nihongo|[[futon]]|蒲団}}, {{Nihongo|paper lantern|行灯|andon}}, {{Nihongo|[[Ming dynasty|Ming]]|明|min}} and {{Nihongo|[[Qing dynasty|Qing]]|清|shin}}.

{{IndicText}}

'''Viparita Karani''' ({{lang-sa|विपरीतकरणी }}; {{IAST-hi1|viparītakaraṇī}}) literally '''Upside-Down''' is considered alternately as an [[asana]] or a [[mudra]] in haṭha yoga.

==Etymology==
The name comes from the Sanskrit words ''viparita'' meaning "inverted" or "reversed", and ''karani'' meaning "doing" or "making".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web | url = http://www.yogaartandscience.com/poses/inver/vipkar/vipkar.html | title = Witold Fitz-Simon - Viparita Karani | accessdate = 2011-07-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
Viparita Karani refers to any practice where one is upside down. This can include the asanas of shoulder stand ([[sarvangasana]]), headstand ([[sirsasana]]), or handstand ([[adho mukha vrksasana]]). In the [[hatha yoga pradipika]], as in most classical texts on haṭha yoga
, viparita karani is listed as a mudra (HYP III.7), meaning its purpose is for the directing of energy or kundalini upwards within the body (HYP III.5) as opposed to asanas which are used in the Hatha Yoga Pradipika to create steadiness (HYP I.19).

In one popular expression of viparita karani as an asana in modern postural yoga, it resembles [[Salamba Sarvāngāsana]] (supported shoulder stand) but with [[flexion]] in the [[thoracic spine]] (rather than the [[cervical spine]], elbows on the floor and hands supporting hips or lower back.&lt;ref name="Yoga Art"&gt;{{cite web|title=Viparita Karani Mudra (Upside Down Seal)|url=http://www.yogaartandscience.com/poses/inver/vkm/vkm.html|publisher=Yoga Art and Science|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Variations include bringing the soles of the feet together such as in [[Baddha Konasana]] or letting the legs fall outward into a straddle.

The '''''Voskresenie''''' (''Resurrection'' or ''Sunday'') was a [[Political left|left-leaning]], quasi-[[Masonic]] [[sect]], which existed in [[Petrograd]] between 1918 and 1928. The group, which consisted of philosophers, professionals, and members of the [[Religious Philosophical Society]], sought to support the [[Bolshevik]]s' economic policy but oppose their [[atheist]]ic culture, and in so doing to 'renew humanity and the construction of [[communism]]' (as seen in Brandist 2002, p.&amp;nbsp;28).

==First gathering==
In December 1917, several employees of the [[Imperial Public Library]] gathered at the flat of philosopher [[Georgy Fedotov]] to discuss the recent [[October Revolution]] and the manner with which the [[intelligentsia]] should respond to the social revolution. Continuing in traditions of the masonic Religious-Philosophic Society, which had been run by their mentors - [[Dmitry Merezhkovsky]] and his wife [[Zinaida Gippius]] - the group critically accepted the revolution, but urged that people be free to express their spiritual beliefs.

==Leadership and themes==
By March 1918, the circle included at least 18 formally recognised members. The leaders were Fedorov and [[Alexander Meyer (religious philosopher)|Alexander Meyer]], who argued for the union (''[[smychka]]'') of [[Christianity]] and social revolution ([[ibid.]]). The majority of participants of the circle were skeptical about the official position of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], believing that free development of Christian ideas within the Church was impossible. Meetings were held in the apartments of the Free Philosophical Association, though after they were closed in 1923, the meetings were held in the flats of K.A. Polovtsova (7 Maly Avenue of Petrogradskaya Side) and P.F. Smotritsky (18 Geslerovsky Lane); in 1917-28, no fewer than 150 people attended these meetings. 

The main discussion themes included revolution and power, religion, and society. The painter [[Kuzma Petrov-Vodkin]] occasionally visited the circle's meetings, as did [[philologist]]s [[Bakhtin|M.M Bakhtin]] and [[Lev Pumpyansky]], although Bakhtin and Pumpyansky appeared not to have any formal connection to the group (Hirschkop 1999: p.&amp;nbsp;168). In 1918, members of the circle issued a periodical, ''Free Voices'', although it proved to be short lived, it was published only twice, having been discontinued after opposition from Merezhkovsky.

==The name Voskresenie==
By the end of 1919, the group officially assumed the name of ''Voskresenie'', which is the Russian word both for "Sunday" and for "Resurrection". The name reflected their hopes to see the social revolution ''resurrect'' spiritual freedoms. By this time eleven people formed the core of Voskresenie, and they organized the fraternity "Christ and Freedom", which secretly convened on Tuesdays and discussed the possibility of facilitating the merger of social revolution and Christianity. The fraternity was disbanded in 1923, on account of disagreements between its members.

==Disbanded==
After Fedorov emigrated two years later, the society came to be dominated by Meyer, who used his charismatic aura and rhetorical skill to turn the circle into a sort of religious sect or masonic lodge. On 8 December 1928, when the society was about to mark its 10th anniversary, Meyer, Bakhtin, and (about 100) other individuals associated with Voskresenie were apprehended by the [[OGPU]] (Hirschkop 1999: p.&amp;nbsp;168). The subsequent trial resulted in the Voskresenie leaders being sentenced up to ten years in [[labour camp]]s. Bakhtin was found guilty for his association with the circle and on 1929-07-22 he was sentenced to five years in [[Siberia]]. Approximately 70 people were sentenced by Decree of the Collegium of the Joint State Political Administration Board on 22 July 1929.

The '''Western Shugden Society''' (or WSS) was a [[western world|western]] campaigning group that advocates [[Dorje Shugden]]. 

==Aims==
According to their website,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.westernshugdensociety.org {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080819193746/http://www.westernshugdensociety.org/ |date=2008-08-19 }} WSS's official website&lt;/ref&gt; the aims of the WSS are
* To free practitioners who rely upon the enlightened deity Dorje Shugden and their families from suffering;
* To restore peace and harmony between Shugden and non-Shugden practitioners;
* To re-establish the common spiritual activities of Shugden and non-Shugden practitioners in Tibetan monasteries;
* To free Buddhism from pollution by politics 

==Academic views==
Robert Barnett of [[Columbia University]] is critical of the WSS:
{{quote|I also made it clear that the Western Shugden group's allegations are problematic: they are akin to attacking the Pope because some lay Catholics somewhere abuse non-believers or heretics. The Western Shugden Group is severely lacking in credibility, since its form of spirit-worship is heterodox, provocative and highly sectarian in Buddhist terms and so more than likely to be banned from mainstream monasteries – while its claimed concerns about cases of discrimination in India should be addressed by working within the Tibetan community instead of opportunistically attacking the Dalai Lama in order to provoke misinformed publicity for their sect.&lt;ref name=Barnett&gt;[http://www.tibet.ca/en/library/wtn/3239 Tibet scholar denies making Time magazine Shugden comment], ''Tibetan Review'', 2008-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Dissolution==
A 2015 [[Reuters]] investigation determined "that the religious sect behind the protests has the backing of the Communist Party" and that the "group has emerged as an instrument in Beijing’s long campaign to undermine support for the Dalai Lama".&lt;ref&gt;Lague, David. Mooney, Paul. and Lim, Benjamin Kang. (21 December 2015). [https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/china-dalailama/ ''"China co-opts a Buddhist sect in global effort to smear Dalai Lama"''.] Reuters. Retrieved 21 December 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; After the Reuters investigation revealed that China backs it, the International Shugden Community halted operations and disbanded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=David Lague|author2=Stephanie Nebehay|title=Buddhist group leading global anti-Dalai Lama protests disbands|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-china-dalai-lama-idUSKCN0WD203|website=Reuters|publisher=Reuters|accessdate=12 March 2016|location=Geneva, Switzerland|date=March 11, 2016|quote="The Buddhist group leading a global campaign of harassment against the Dalai Lama has called off its demonstrations and disbanded, according to a statement on its website. The announcement comes after a Reuters investigation revealed in December that China’s ruling Communist Party backs the Buddhist religious sect behind the protests that have confronted the Dalai Lama in almost every country he visits. Reuters found that the sect had become a key instrument in China’s campaign to discredit the Tibetan spiritual leader."}}&lt;/ref&gt;
