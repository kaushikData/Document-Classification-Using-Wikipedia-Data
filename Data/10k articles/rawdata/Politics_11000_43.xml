[[File:Sambo Dasuki, National Security Adviser to President Goodluck Jonathan, Nigeria (16160741168).jpg|thumb|[[Sambo Dasuki]], the [[National Security Advisor (Nigeria)|National Security Adviser]] who allegedly masterminded the $2 billions arms deal]]

The '''$2 billion arms deal''' is an arms procurement deal in [[Nigeria]] that resulted in the embezzlement of $2 billion through the office of the [[National Security Advisor (Nigeria)|National Security Adviser]] under the leadership of Colonel [[Sambo Dasuki]], the former [[National Security Adviser]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/194185-breaking-efcc-arrests-former-minister-others-over-alleged-2billion-arms-deal-2.html|title=EFCC arrests former Minister, others over alleged $2billion arms deal|work=Premium Times|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The illegal deal was revealed following an interim report of the presidential investigations committee on arms procurement under the [[Cabinet of President Goodluck Jonathan|Goodluck Jonathan administration]]. The committee report showed an extra-budgetary spending to the tune of N643.8 billion and an additional spending of about $2.2 billion in the foreign currency component under the Goodluck Jonathan administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/194213-exclusive-why-efcc-arrested-yuguda-bafarawa-ex-pdp-chairmans-sons-others-over-2billion-arms-deal-2.html|title=EXCLUSIVE: Why EFCC arrested Yuguda, Bafarawa, ex-PDP|work=Premium Times|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Preliminary investigation suggested that about $2 billion may have been disbursed for the procurement of arms to fight against [[Boko haram|Islamic insurgency]] in Nigeria.  The investigative report indicated that a total sum of $2.2 billion was inexplicably disbursed into the office of the National Security Adviser in procurement of arms to fight against insurgency, but was not spent for that purpose.  Several reports suggested that part of the disbursed fund was diverted for the sponsoring of the re-election of Goodluck Jonathan, the former [[President of Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naij.com/658633-arms-deal-scandal-efcc-arrest-goodluck-jonathan.html|title=EFCC May Invite Jonathan For Questioning Over Arms Deal|work=Naij.com|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigations on this illegal deal led to the arrest of Shaibu Salisu, a former Director of Finance in the&amp;nbsp;office of the National Security Adviser. He was arrested by the Department of State Security Services and following interrogations he claimed to have acted on Colonel Dasuki's order.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://expressng.com/2015/12/2-1bn-scandal-dansuki-names-implicates-governors-pdp-chiefs/|title=$2.1bn Scandal: Dasuki Implicates Ex-Governors, Bode George and|work=Express Nigeria|accessdate=13 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151212102205/http://expressng.com/2015/12/2-1bn-scandal-dansuki-names-implicates-governors-pdp-chiefs/|archive-date=12 December 2015|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Colonel Dasuki was arrested on 1 December 2015 by the [[State Security Service (Nigeria)|Department of State Security Services]] and transferred to the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] for further interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/armsgate-efcc-arrests-ex-minister-dasukis-ex-finance-chief-others/|title=Armsgate: EFCC arrests ex-minister, Dasuki's ex-finance chief |work=The Nation Newspaper|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a written statement, he mentioned several notable Nigerians who were involved in the arms procurement deal. [[Tribal chief|Chief]] [[Raymond Dokpesi]], the chair emeritus of [[DAAR Communications Plc]], was mentioned in connection with the deal alongside [[Attahiru Bafarawa]], the former Governor of [[Sokoto State]], and [[Bashir Yuguda]], the former Minister of State for Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naij.com/654832-confession-dasuki-implicates-ex-governors-pdp-chiefs-2billion-arms-deal-scandal.html|title=Dasuki Lists Ex-Govs, PDP Chiefs In Arms Scandal|work= Naij.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigative committee==


The arms procurement investigative committee was inaugurated on 31 August 2015 by President Muhammadu Buhari to investigate the procurement of ammunition to fight against [[insurgency]] during the administration of Goodluck Ebele Jonathan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/11/2-9b-arms-procurement-buhari-orders-arrest-of-dasuki-others/|title=$2.9b arms procurement: Buhari orders arrest of Dasuki, others |work=Vanguard News|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interim report of the committee revealed several illicit and fraudulent financial transactions. The report revealed an extra-budgetary spending to the tune of N643.8 billion and inexplicable spending of about $2.2 billion in the foreign currency component under the Goodluck Jonathan administration. This amount excluded grants received by the [[States of Nigeria|state governments]] and funds received by the Directorate of State Services and the [[Nigerian Police Force]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/arms-procurement-scam-buhari-orders-arrest-of-dasuki-others/225938/|title=Arms Procurement Deal: Buhari Orders Arrest of Dasuki, Others|work=Thisday News|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125101037/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/arms-procurement-scam-buhari-orders-arrest-of-dasuki-others/225938/|archivedate=25 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The committee analyzed how funds were transferred to the office of the National Security Adviser and the [[Nigerian Armed Forces]] in local and foreign currencies.
The committee observed that about $2.2 billion was disbursed for the procurement of ammunition to tackle insurgency but regretted that despite this enormous financial transactions, little or nothing was spent for the procurement of the arms for which the fund was disbursed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dailypost.ng/2015/11/17/breaking-buhari-orders-arrest-of-dasuki-others-over-arms-procurement-fraud/|title=Buhari orders arrest of Dasuki, others over arms procurement fraud|work=Daily Post|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The committee discovered that out of the 513 contracts awarded at $8,356,525,184.32, ₦2,189,265,724,404.55 and £54,000.00, about 53 were failed contracts amounting to about  $2,378,939,066.27 and ₦13,729,342,329.87 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/arms-deals-buhari-orders-arrest-of-dasuki-others/|title=Arms deals: Buhari orders arrest of Dasuki, others |work=The Nation Newspaper|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The committee also noted that the amount of foreign currencies spent on failed contracts was more than twice the $1 billion loan approved by the [[National Assembly (Nigeria)|National Assembly]] for borrowing from the [[World bank]] to fight insurgency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201512090195.html|title=Nigeria: U.S.$2 Billion Arms Deal - FG Slams Six-Count Money|work=allAfrica.com|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The investigative committee also discovered a total transfer of ₦3.850 billion to a single company by Colonel Dansuki, the former National Security Adviser. These transactions were made with neither agreements nor fulfilment of tax obligations to the [[Politics of Nigeria|Federal Government of Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsunited.com/nigerian-ex-president-goodluck-news/19787543/|title=Nigerian ex-President Goodluck Jonathan stole $2 billion via fake |work=News United|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further investigation by the committee provided evidence that phantom and fictitious contracts to the tune of ₦2,219,188,609.50, $1,671,742,613.58 and  £9,905,477.00 was awarded between March 2012 and March 2015 by Colonel Dasuki.
In addition, the funds disbursed for the purchase of 12 [[helicopters]], 4 Alpha Jets, bombs and other ammunition were not utilized for those purposes.  The committee also noted that Dansuki directed the [[Central Bank of Nigeria]] (CBN) to transfer a total sum of $132,050,486.97 dollars and £9,905,473.5 to the accounts of the Societe D'equipmente Internationaux in West Africa, the UK, and the US with no documentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.japantimes.co.jp/news/2015/11/18/world/nigerian-ex-president-goodluck-jonathan-stole-2-billion-via-fake-arms-deals-current-president-says/|title=Nigerian ex-President Goodluck Jonathan stole |work=Japan Times|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent to this investigative committee's interim report, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the arrest of Colonel Dasuki on alleged siphoning of billions of dollars allocated for the procurement of arms. He also ordered the arrest of all those indicted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/news/2015/11/nigeria-orders-arrest-adviser-2bn-arms-deal-151118043340314.html|title=Nigeria orders arrest of ex-adviser over $2bn arms deal|work= Al Jazeera|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Probing and prosecutions==

Several notable Nigerians were involved in the arms procurement deals, including Chief Raymond Dopesi, the chair emeritus of DAAR Communications PLC, alongside Attahiru Bafarawa, the former Governor of Sokoto State and Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance.
Sambo Dasuki masterminded the arms procurement deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/alleged-2bn-arms-deal-fraud-efcc-uncovers-another-n600m-scam/|title=ALLEGED $2bn arms deal fraud: EFCC uncovers another N600m|work=Vanguard news|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 November 2015, President Muhammadu Buhari ordered the arrest of Colonel Dasuki, the former National Security Adviser, on alleged siphoning of the arms procurement funds. Dasuki claimed that ordering his arrest by the President is illegal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigeriannewspapers.today/buhari-orders-arrest-of-indicted-persons-in-n2-trillion-arms-procurement-probe/|title=Buhari Orders Arrest Of Indicted Persons In N2 Trillion Arms|work=Nigerian Newspaper|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222134837/http://www.nigeriannewspapers.today/buhari-orders-arrest-of-indicted-persons-in-n2-trillion-arms-procurement-probe/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He denied that he was invited by the investigation committee on issues related to arms procurement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://africanspotlight.com/2015/11/20/dasuki-lied-shunned-arms-probe-panels-invitation-presidency/|title=Dasuki lied, shunned arms probe panel's invitation –Presidency|work=African spotlight|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222092952/http://africanspotlight.com/2015/11/20/dasuki-lied-shunned-arms-probe-panels-invitation-presidency/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to ''Premium Times'', Dansuki said "I have never been invited formally or informally to appear before the panel. I am therefore not only surprised but embarrassed by the seeming indictment by the panel purportedly operating from the office of the National Security Adviser that never contacted me".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/193400-dasuki-kicks-as-buhari-orders-arrest-says-i-was-never-invited-to-defend-myself-over-arms-deal.html|title=Dasuki kicks as Buhari orders arrest, says, "I was never invited to defend myself"|work=premium Times|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to ordering his arrest by the president for siphoning the arms procurement fund, on 19 July 2015, the operative of the Department of State Security Service stormed his residence at Abuja and confiscated his international passport. He was charged with unlawful possession of firearms and foreign currencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/186941-sss-wrong-in-seizing-dasukis-passport-right-in-searching-his-homes-falana.html|title=SSS wrong in seizing Dasuki's passport, right in searching his|work=Premium Times|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 November 2015, Justice Adeniyi Ademola, the presiding Judge of the Federal High Court sitting in Abuja, ordered the DSS to release his passport to enable in travel for medical attention. Despite this ruling, the DSS prevented him from traveling abroad by putting him under a house arrest insisting that Dasuki have some questions to answer on the $2 billion arms procurement deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thenationonlineng.net/dss-seizes-dasukis-passport-placed-under-house-arrest/|title=DSS seizes Dasuki's passport, placed under house arrest |work=The Nation|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 18 November 2015, a US-based newspaper, ''[[The Washington Times]]'', in a report entitled "Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari Dupes the US", criticized President Muhammadu Buhari for putting Dasuki house under siege and for declining the order of the court permitting Dasuki to travel for medical attention.  The newspaper described Buhari's action as an attempt to destroy his political opponents like Dasuki with tyrannical methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.washingtontimes.com/news/2015/nov/18/bruce-fein-nigerian-president-buhari-dupes-us/|title=Nigerian President Muhammadu Buhari dupes the US|work= The Washington Times|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the same vein, Alhaji [[Tanko Yakasai]], a former Liaison Officer to President [[Shehu Shagari]] and a founding member of the  [[Arewa Consultative Forum]], and [[Frederick Fasehun]], a leader of the [[Oodua Peoples Congress]], berated President Muhammadu Buhari for putting Dasuki's house under siege and for disobeying the court order.  Both leaders described Buhari's action as "deliberate neglect of the rule of law or re-introduction of subtle autocracy in the leadership of the country". They described [[Buhari's anti-corruption war]] as "selective"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationaldailyng.com/2015/yakassai-fasehun-blast-buhari-over-dasuki/|title=Yakassai, Fasehun blast Buhari over Dasuki|work=National Daily|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Yakassai said, "Since President Buhari and the Attorney General have decided to disobey the court order which says that Col. Sambo Dasuki be allowed to travel abroad for medical attention, it means that Buhari is all out on a revenge mission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribuneonlineng.com/fasehun-accuses-fg-of-muzzling-press-hounding-opposition|title=Fasehun accuses FG of muzzling press, hounding opposition|work=Nigerian Tribune|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222134357/http://tribuneonlineng.com/fasehun-accuses-fg-of-muzzling-press-hounding-opposition|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fredrick Fasheun said, "Where a court order has been given and the President flouts the court order, how can you claim change in the democracy, except change from democracy to autocracy, as we are seeing now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnewsonline.com/new/fasehun-accuses-fg-of-intimidating-opposition/|title=Fasehun accuses FG of intimidating opposition|work=The Sun|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222125535/http://sunnewsonline.com/new/fasehun-accuses-fg-of-intimidating-opposition/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2015, Colonel Dasuki was arrested by the [[State Security Service (Nigeria)|Department of State Security Services]] and transferred to the [[Economic and Financial Crimes Commission]] for further interrogation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2015/11/30/former-nsa-dasuki’s-top-staff-20-others-arrested-efcc-over-arms-contract-scandal|title=Former NSA Dasuki's Top Staff, 20 Others Arrested By EFCC Over |work=Sahara reporters|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Prior to Dasuki's arrest, Shaibu Salisu, a former Director of Finance in the&amp;nbsp;office of the National Security Adviser, was arrested by the Department of the State Security Services and following interrogations he claimed to have acted on Colonel Dasuki's order which led to Dasuki's arrest. After Dasuki was transferred to the EFCC, he initially decided not to comment on the issue or write any statement, claiming that he had been subjected to media trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/12/dss-re-arrests-dasuki-efcc-seizes-dokpesi-in-arms-deal-probe/|title=DSS re-arrests Dasuki, EFCC seizes Dokpesi in arms deal probe|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The EFCC operatives then issued Dasuki a copy of the statement made by Shaibu Salisu, a statement that seemed rather implicating. Dasuki was shocked by Salisu's confessional statement. According to ''[[The Nation (Nigeria)|The Nation]]'', Colonel Dasuki said, "You mean Salisu wrote all these! You mean he said these! Give me a pen and paper." Dasuki gave a long list of people involved in the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://safarinewsng.com/former-national-security-adviser-nsa-sambo-dasuki-makes-stunning-confessions-about-accomplices-in-arms-deal-scandal/|title=Former national security adviser (NSA), Sambo Dasuki makes|work=Safari News Nigeria|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222102525/http://safarinewsng.com/former-national-security-adviser-nsa-sambo-dasuki-makes-stunning-confessions-about-accomplices-in-arms-deal-scandal/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He mentioned Chief Raymond Dopesi, the chair emeritus of [[DAAR Communications Plc]], alongside Attahiru Bafarawa, the former Governor of Sokoto State, and Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://therenaissanceng.com/ex-nsa-dasuki-confesses-names-ex-governors-others-in-alleged-2bn-fraud|title=Ex-NSA – Dasuki confesses, names ex-governors, others in alleged|work=therenaissanceng.com|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2015, Chief Raymond Dopesi, the Chair Emeritus of Daar Communication PLC, was arrested at his residence in [[Abuja]] by the EFCC in connections with the arms procurement deal having been mentioned by Colonel Dasuki.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2015/12/01/arms-purchase-scandal-raymond-dokpesi-arrested|title=Arms Purchase Scandal: Raymond Dokpesi Arrested|work=Sahara reporters|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Preliminary evidence showed that Chief Dopesi received ₦2.1 billion between October 2014 and March 2015 from the office of the National Security Adviser with no coherent reasons for the financial transaction. Chief Dopesi, said the ₦2.1 billion received from the Office of the National Security Adviser was payment for media and political campaign for the re-election of President Goodluck Jonathan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/alleged-arms-deal-scandal-efcc-arrests-dokpesi/|title=Alleged arms deal scandal: EFCC arrests Dokpesi|work= Vanguard News|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On Tuesday, 8 December 2015, Chief Dokpesi was arraigned by the [[Nigeria|Federal Government of Nigeria]] before a federal high court&amp;nbsp;sitting in Abuja on six count charges of [[money laundering]] and other [[financial crimes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/2bn-arms-deal-fg-slams-6-count-money-laundering-charge-against-dokpesi/|title=$2bn arms deal: FG slams 6-count money laundering charge|work=Vanguard news|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The prosecutor maintained that the transfer of a total sum of ₦2.1 billion between October 2014 and March 2015 from the office of the National Security Adviser breaches section 58 (4) (b) of the Public Procurement Act 2007 and punishable under Section 58 (6) and (7) of the same Act, as well as under Section 17 (b) of the EFCC Act, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2015/12/08/dokpesi-slammed-six-counts-money-laundering-and-financial-crime|title=Dokpesi Slammed With Six Counts Of Money |work= Sahara Reporters|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dokpesi plead not guilty of the charges and requested the court to grant him bail on liberal terms. The case was adjourned till 10 December 2015 to consider his bail request. The presiding judge, Justice Gabriel Kolawole, ordered the EFCC to detain him pending the determination of his bail application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citypeopleng.com/arms-deal-dasuki-dokpesi-others-bag-43-count-money-laundering-charge/|title=Arms Deal: Dasuki, Dokpesi, Others Bag 43-Count Money|work=City People Magazine|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222143730/http://citypeopleng.com/arms-deal-dasuki-dokpesi-others-bag-43-count-money-laundering-charge/|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 10 December 2015, Rotimi Jacob, counsel to the EFCC, argued that granting Dokpesi bail would truncate the trial application for bail. Having heard from the prosecutor and defence counsel, Justice Kolawole adjourned the hearing for the bail application till 14 December 2015. He slated 17 February, 18 February and 2 March, 3 March 2016 to commence the hearing on the six count charges slammed against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ngrguardiannews.com/2015/12/court-refuses-dokpesi-bail/|title=Court Refuses Dokpesi Bail|work=The Guardian|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 2015, Justice Gabriel Kolawole ruled that Chief Dokpesi should be granted a bail in the sum of ₦400 million with two surety in like sum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/195159-court-grants-raymond-dokpesi-bail.html|title=Court grants Raymond Dokpesi bail|work=Premium Times Nigeria|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He said the first surety must be a retired or serving director in the civil service and the second surety must be a private investor with a track record of tax payment in the last 3 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naij.com/666360-breaking-dokpesi-granted-bail-strict-conditions.html|title=JUST IN: Dokpesi Granted Bail On Strict Conditions|work=Naij.com|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He maintain that Dokpesi should remain in Kuje Prison until the bail conditions are met. He also ordered the EFCC not to re-arrest him after the bail for interrogation for more than 8 hours and 30 minutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leadership.ng/news/483237/n2-1bn-alleged-fraud-court-grants-dokpesi-bail|title=N2.1bn Alleged Fraud: Court Grants Dokpesi Bail|work=Leadership Newspaper|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the arms procurement saga, Chief Dokpesi and [[Africa Independent Television]] was accused of partisan for airing some controversial documentaries such as ''[[The Lion of Bourdillon]]'', which Chief [[Bola Tinubu]] considered defamatory. This documentary generated several controversies, leading to a ₦150 billion libel suit against AIT by Chief Bola Tinubu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnewsonline.com/new/lion-of-bourdillon-ait-fights-back/ |title=Lion of Bourdillon: AIT fights back |work=The Sun |accessdate=13 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150811063641/http://sunnewsonline.com/new/lion-of-bourdillon-ait-fights-back/ |archivedate=11 August 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2015, [[Attahiru Bafarawa]], the former Governor of Sokoto State, was arrested and detained by the EFCC in connection with the arms procurement deal having been mentioned by Colonel Dasuki.  He was arrested alongside Dokpesi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/ex-finance-minister-yuguda-bafarawa-s-son-others-arrested-over-2bn-arms-deals/226819/|title=Ex-Finance Minister, Yuguda, Bafarawa's Son, Others Arrested over|work=Thisday|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151205173928/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/ex-finance-minister-yuguda-bafarawa-s-son-others-arrested-over-2bn-arms-deals/226819|archivedate=5 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Preliminary evidence showed that Attahiru Bafarawa received ₦4.6 billion from the office of the National Security Adviser with no clear basis for the financial transaction. In response to the allegation, Bafarawa said he received the money from the Office of the National Security Adviser for spiritual purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelstv.com/2015/12/01/efcc-arrests-former-sokoto-governor-attahiru-bafarawa/|title=EFCC Arrests Former Sokoto Governor, Attahiru Bafarawa |work=Channels TV|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 8 December 2015, the family of Bafawara in a statement signed by the  Media Aide to the former governor, Alhaji Yusuf Dingyadi advised the EFCC to charge Bafawara and his son to court if there are evidence against them rather than keeping them in their custody.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2015/12/01/arms-purchase-scandal-efcc-grabs-attahiru-bafarawa|title=Arms Purchase Scandal: EFCC Grabs Attahiru Bafarawa |work=Sahara reporters|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
According to ''[[Thisday]]'', the family of Bafawara said &lt;blockquote&gt;Today is one week since Bafarawa was detained by the EFCC. And today marks two weeks that his son Sagir Bafarawa has been in detention. Why are they being detained without charges? If the EFCC has any evidence that they have committed any crime it should charge them to court. We thought that the era of detaining people while searching for evidence was over. We call on the EFCC to release them forthwith if they have nothing against them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/charge-bafarawa-to-court-now-family-tells-efcc/227453/|title=Charge Bafarawa to Court Now, Family Tells EFCC|work=Thisday|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151213004806/http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/charge-bafarawa-to-court-now-family-tells-efcc/227453/|archivedate=13 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On 30 November 2015, Ambassador Bashir Yuguda, a former Minister of State for Finance, was arrested and detained by the EFCC in connections with the arms procurement deal having been mentioned by Colonel Dasuki. He was arrested alongside Chief Raymond Dokpesi, Alhaji Attahiru Bafarawa and his son.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.channelstv.com/2015/11/30/efcc-arrests-former-minister-of-state-for-finance-yuguda/|title=EFCC Arrests Former Minister Of State For Finance Yuguda|work=Channels TV|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Preliminary evidence showed that Ambassador Yuguda received ₦1.5 billion from the office of the National Security Adviser with no coherent basis for the financial transaction. The money was transferred into his account through an unknown company for inexplicable purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naij.com/652422-breaking-news-former-minister-bashir-yuguda-arrested-dasuki-related-2bn-arms-deal.html|title=Ex-Minister Bashir Yuguda arrested over Dasuki-related fraud|work=Naij.com|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Premium Times, "The funds were directly transferred to him from the NSA office and he has been unable to explain the rationale for the transfer.&amp;nbsp;The transfers were made to his account between December 2014 and May 2015".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newtelegraphonline.com/2015/12/efcc-arrests-yuguda-ex-directors-others/ |title=EFCC arrests Yuguda, ex-directors, others |work=New Telegraph |accessdate=13 December 2015 }}{{dead link|date=September 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Additional ₦1.275 billion was also transferred to his account during the campaign for the [[Nigerian general election, 2015]]

On 30 November 2015, Shaibu Salisu, a former Director of Finance in the&amp;nbsp;office of the National Security Adviser, was arrested in connection with the arms procurement deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2015/12/11/how-former-nsa-dasuki-shared-n30b-‘loot’-anenih-ayu-pdp-reps-delegates-and-prayer|title=How Former NSA Dasuki Shared N30b 'Loot' To Anenih, Ayu, PDP|work=Sahara Reporters|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Investigation reveal that Salisu operates a joint account with Sambo Dasuki. According to ''Thisday'', EFCC operatives said "We just discovered a huge sum of money in foreign currencies in a joint account &amp;ndash; being operated by the former National Security Adviser, Col. Sambo Dasuki and a director in his office, one Shauibu Salisu. He is also being interrogated by EFCC operatives." Salisu's confessional statements led to Dasuki's arrest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/the-arms-deal-probe-anti-graft-war-or-score-settling-/227281/ |title=THE ARMS DEAL PROBE: Anti-graft War or Score Settling |work=Thisday News |accessdate=13 December 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151208035702/https://www.thisdaylive.com/articles/the-arms-deal-probe-anti-graft-war-or-score-settling-/227281/ |archivedate=8 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Investigation also revealed a payment of ₦650 million into the account Nduka Obaigbena, owner of Arise TV and Thisday publisher. He denied receiving any money from the Office of the National Security Adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2015/12/07/arms-purchase-scam-investigators-trace-n650m-thisday-publisher-nduka-obaigbena|title=Investigators Trace N650m To Thisday Publisher Nduka Obaigbena|work=Sahara reporters|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On 12 December 2015, the management of ''Thisday'' denied receiving money related to arms procurement from the former National Security Adviser. The management in its response to an invitation letter from the EFCC dated 8 November 2015, received in its Abuja office on 8 December 2015, said all funds received from the Office of the National Security Adviser , "are payments for compensation to mitigate the dastardly Boko Haram twin bombings of the ThisDay Newspapers offices in Abuja and Kaduna on Thursday April 26, 2012".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/why-i-received-n670m-from-dasuki-by-nduka-obaigbena-thisday-publisher/|title=Why I received N670m from Dasuki, by Nduka Obaigbena, ThisDay Publisher|work=Vanguard News|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Thursday 3 December 2015, [[Saliu Atawodi]], an Air vice-marshal (rtd) and Chairman of the Presidential Implementation Committee on Marine Safety, was arrested by EFCC on alleged involvement in the arms procurement deal. He was accused of illegal diversion of ₦600 million meant for the procurement of military boats for use in fighting against insurgency. However, the Court of Appeal sitting in Abuja on Tuesday 6 June 2017, discharged and acquitted Atawodi. In a judgement delivered by Justice Tani Hassan-Yusuf, the Court dismissed the judgment of an Abuja High Court which earlier asked Atawodi to open his defense. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2015/12/03/efcc-arrests-avm-atawodi-ex-chairman-presidential-implementation-committee-marine-safety|title=EFCC Arrests AVM Atawodi, Ex-Chairman Presidential |work=Sahara reporters|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signalng.com/flash-n600-million-arms-scam-court-discharges-acquits-avm-atawodi/|title=Arms Deal Saga: EFCC Arrests Saliu Atawodi for|work=Bella Naija|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 December 2015, the EFCC arraigned Colonel Dasuki, Bafarawa, Saliu Atawodi, Dokpesi, Yuguda, Salisu, Sagir Attahiru, Dahaltu Investment Limited, Aminu Baba-Kusa, former Executive Director of the [[Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation]], and his company Acacia Holding Limited and Reliance Referral Hospital Limited before Justice Hussein Baba Yusuf of Abuja High Court sitting at Maitama on alleged unlawful diversion of public funds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/efcc-docks-dasuki-yuguda-others-on-fresh-charges-today/|title=EFCC docks Dasuki, Yuguda, others on fresh charges today|work=Vanguard News|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidences==
Several pieces of evidence established the fact that about $2 billions was transferred into the Office of the National Security Adviser.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201512100132.html|title=Nigeria: How Jonathan, Okonjo-Iweala Illegally Diverted N61.4 |work=All Africa|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
''[[Premium Times]]'' published a letter sent to Goodluck Jonathan by [[Ngozi Okonjo-Iweala]] requesting the former President's approval of a transfer of about $300 million (£5.5 million) from money recovered from  the late General [[Sani Abacha]] to the office of the National Security Adviser, Sambo Dasuki, a few days before the presidential election held in April 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/how-okonjo-iweala-diverted-n61-4bn-abacha-loot-to-nsa-report/|title=How Okonjo-Iweala diverted N61.4bn Abacha loot to NSA —Report|work=Vanguard News|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The letter, dated 20 January 2015, was addressed to the former president following the 12 January 2015 request for funds by the office of the National Security Adviser under the leadership of Dasuki for the procurement of arms and intelligence equipment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.informationng.com/2015/12/shocking-details-of-how-jonathan-okonjo-iweala-illegally-diverted-n61-4bn-abacha-loot-to-ex-nsa-dasuki.html|title=Shocking Details Of How Jonathan, Okonjo-Iweala Illegally Diverted|work=information Nigeria|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The letter reads &lt;blockquote&gt;Please find a request by the National Security Adviser (NSA) for the transfer of $300 million and £5.5 million of the recovered Abacha funds to an ONSA (Office of the National Security Adviser) operations account. The NSA has explained that this is to enable the purchase of ammunition, security, and other intelligence equipment for the security agencies in order to enable them fully confront the ongoing Boko Haram threat. His request is sequel to the meeting you chaired with the committee on the use of recovered funds where the decision was made that recovered Abacha funds would be split 50-50 between urgent security needs to confront Boko Haram and development need (including a portion for the Future Generations window of the Sovereign Wealth Fund). This letter is to seek your approval to borrow these funds, for now, to disburse to the NSA. These funds form part of the projected Federal Government Independent Revenue, to be appropriated, in the light and for accountability, given the peculiar nature of security and intelligence transactions, we would expect the NSA to account to Your Excellency for the utilisation of the funds.&lt;/blockquote&gt; The transfer was approved by Goodluck Jonathan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/headlines/194870-how-jonathan-okonjo-iweala-illegally-diverted-n61-4-billion-abacha-loot-to-nsa-sambo-dasuki.html|title=How Jonathan, Okonjo-Iweala illegally diverted |work=Premium Times|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/194925-okonjo-iweala-confirms-premium-times-story-on-illegal-disbursement-of-n61-4-billion-abacha-loot.html|title=Okonjo-Iweala confirms PREMIUM TIMES story on illegal |work=Premium Times|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a counter-claim, while speaking in [[Washington DC]] on "Presidential elections and democratic consolidation in Africa: Case studies on Nigeria and Tanzania," a forum co-hosted by the [[National Democratic Institute for International Affairs]] and the [[Center for Strategic and International Studies]], Goodluck Jonathan refuted the allegations by the EFCC and its operative that he awarded a contract potentially worth $2 billion for arms procurement during his administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sunnewsonline.com/i-didnt-award-2b-contract-jonathan/ |title=I didn't award $2b contract – Jonathan |work=[[The Sun (Nigeria)|The Sun]] |date=21 November 2015}}{{dead link|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He said "Where did the money come from? I did not award any $2 billion contract for procurement of weapons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.premiumtimesng.com/news/top-news/193493-jonathan-washes-hand-off-arms-procurement-scandal.html|title=Jonathan washes hand off arms procurement scandal|work= Premium Times|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Confessional statements==
Several confessional statements help in the investigation of the arms procurement deal. Salisu, who operated a joint bank account with Dasuki, claimed to have withdrawn $47 million from the Central Bank of Nigeria; the money was delivered in 11 [[briefcase]]s to Dasuki at his residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naij.com/663746-revelations-47m-delivered-cbn-dasuki-11-suitcases.html|title=How $47m Was Delivered From CBN To Dasuki In 11 Suitcases|work=Naij.com|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Salisu's statement reads &lt;blockquote&gt; “I could remember on the 20/11/2014, I was directed by the NSA, M.S. Dasuki to go to the CBN and collect the sum of $47m in cash and the balance in Euro and the directive was obeyed and the monies were delivered to the NSA in about 11 suit cases. I acknowledged the receipt of the money from the CBN which was handed over to M.S. Dasuki. I did not benefit even one cent. The request for the funds was tag(sic) Special Services signed by the NSA, M.S. Dasuki, addressed to the Governor of CBN.
I did not know the source of the money into our CBN Account. The foreign currencies that I collected from the CBN were delivered to the NSA in his house, No. 13, John Kadiya Street, Asokoro."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2015/12/12/i-delivered-47m-in-11-suitcases-to-dasuki-ex-director/|title=I delivered $47m in 11 suitcases to Dasuki - Ex-director|work=PM News Nigeria|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naijanewsmetro.com/i-delivered-47m-in-11-different-suitcases-to-dasuki-ex-finance-director-says|title=I delivered $47m in 11 different suitcases to Dasuki – Ex-Finance|work=Naija News metro|accessdate=13 December 2015}}{{dead link|date=July 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Ambassador Yuguda claimed to have delivered a sum of N600 million to six chairmen of the National Working Committee, the Contact and Mobilisation Committee of the [[People's Democratic Party (Nigeria)|People's Democratic Party]] for the 2015 general election. According to him, the beneficiaries includes  Yerima Abdullahi, Chief [[Bode George]], [[Peter Odili]], [[Jim Nwobodo]],  Attahiru Bafarawa and Ahmadu Ali.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanreporters.com/2015/12/2b-arms-efcc-probes-bode-george-odili.html?m=1|title=$2B ARMS: EFCC PROBES BODE GEORGE, ODILI, BELLO|work=urban reporters|accessdate=13 December 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151222122512/http://www.urbanreporters.com/2015/12/2b-arms-efcc-probes-bode-george-odili.html?m=1|archivedate=22 December 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He transferred  N300 million to BAM Properties, whose account details were sent to him by Bello Haliru, a former National Chairman of the People's Democratic Party. He also claimed to have sent N200 million to Bello Sarkin Yaki, the Governorship aspirant in [[Kebbi State]]. According to him, [[Mahmud Shinkafi]], the former Governor of [[Zamfara State]], received  ₦100 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naij.com/655364-breaking-dasuki-lists-former-rivers-gov-bode-george-arms-deal-scandal.html|title=Dasuki Lists Bode George, Odili As Accomplices In Arms Deal Scandal|work=Naij.com|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bashir's confessional statement reads &lt;blockquote&gt;For the cash disbursement of  ₦600million, it was meant for the six zonal chairmen for Contact and Mobilisation Committees for Election of 2015. The chairmen are Bode George, Amb. Yerima Abdullahi; Peter Odili; Attahiru Bafarawa; Jim Nwobodo; Ahmadu  Ali. The sum of  ₦100million was given to each chairman. I gave the money in company of Prof. Alkali, who was Political Adviser to former president. The zonal chairmen are for the Peoples Democratic Party(PDP). I also instructed Jabbama Limited to transfer the sum of N100m to Dalhatu Limited on the request of Attahiru Bafarawa. I also remember that Bello Sarkin Yaki was among the people that the then NSA instructed that I send the sum of N200million to. He was the PDP gubernatorial candidate in Kebbi State. I knew the chairman of Stallion Limited whose second name I cannot remember. Between December 2014 to June 2015, on the instruction of the then NSA, I introduced Jabbama Limited to a staff of the company on the instruction of the chairman. When the account was in credit, disbursement was made from time to time on the instruction of the then NSA. Part in foreign exchange or transfers. I wish to add that sometime in February 2015, I instructed Jabbama to transfer the sum of N300m to BAM Properties. The account was given to me by Bello Haliru as one of the people the former NSA requested me to give money. I also remember that Mahmud Aliyu Shinkafi was sent the sum of N100million on the instruction of the then NSA. Further to my statement of 30th November, 2015, I have brought the sum of $829,800(equivalent to N200m) and N600m was given to me to distribute to the six PDP Zonal Committee chairmen. I don’t know who are the directors of Dalhatu Investment Limited but funds were transferred to the company’s account on the instruction of Dalhatu Bafarawa for the total amount of N1.5billion received from the then NSA by Jabbama Limited. I shall endeavour to recover the sum of N600million given to the six zonal PDP committee chairmen, while I appeal to the commission to use their machineries to trace the remaining balance of the money transferred to various accounts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saharareporters.com/2015/12/12/i-gave-n600million-bode-george-peter-odili-attahiru-bafarawa-jim-nwobodo-and-others|title=I Gave N600million To Bode George, Peter Odili, Attahiru Bafarawa |work=Sahara Reporters|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.naij.com/656016-2b-arms-scandal-efcc-set-probe-bode-george-odili-following-dasukis-confession.html|title=EFCC Set To Probe Bode George, Odili Following |work=Naij.com|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In a counter-claim, Chief Bode George denied the allegations of receiving a total sum of ₦100 million from Yuguda for the 2015 general election. He described the claim by Yuguda as "mischievous and deliberately fraudulent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nigerianbulletin.com/threads/i-didn’t-collect-n100m-from-yuguda-—-bode-george.153799/|title=I didn't collect N100 from Yugudu - Bode George|work=Nigerian Bulletin|accessdate=13 December 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113051/http://www.nigerianbulletin.com/threads/i-didn%E2%80%99t-collect-n100m-from-yuguda-%E2%80%94-bode-george.153799/|archive-date=4 March 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Bode's statement reads &lt;blockquote&gt;“My attention has been drawn to another mischievous and deliberately fraudulent claim that I collected N100 million from Bashir Yuguda, the former Minister of State for Finance. This is another blatant falsehood, stripped of any iota of truth. This is yet again a depraved continuation of lynch mob journalism orchestrated by an online newspaper. The salient fact is that very early this year, long before the election period, the party set up Contact and Mobilization Committee for each zone to reconcile various factions and ensure a firm unity of purpose within the zones before the election. I was elected as the Chairman for the South-West zone. The committee which was made up of 18 senior members of the party with distinguished history of honour and exemplary leadership, met at least 10 times in my office in Lagos. These people travelled all the way from every corner of the South-West, with three members representing each state. All of them are very much alive to testify to my assertions. Sometime in the middle of these deliberations, Yuguda came to me and said the party was reimbursing the 18 elders of the committee for their transportation, accommodation and feeding allowance for the work that was done. The committee later submitted the report of its deliberations to the party and then wound up. For all these efforts Yuguda gave the committee only $30,000. That was less than N6 million at that time. Yuguda can never claim that he gave the Committee N100 million. That is the figment of the imagination of rascally scribblers purporting to be journalists. Again, facts are sacred.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vanguardngr.com/2015/12/i-didnt-collect-n100m-from-yuguda-bode-george/#top|title=I didn't collect N100 from Yugudu - Bode George|work=Vanguard News|accessdate=13 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The '''27th G8 summit''' was held in [[Genoa]], [[Italy]], on July 21–22, 2001 and is remembered as the peak of the worldwide [[antiglobalization]] movement as well as for human rights crimes against demonstrators.

==Overview==
The [[G8#History|Group of Seven]] ([[G8#History|G7]]) was an unofficial forum which brought together the heads of the richest industrialized countries: [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[United Kingdom]], the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] starting in 1976.  The [[G8]], meeting for the first time in 1997, was formed with the addition of [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="saunders1"&gt;Saunders, Doug. [https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080704.wG8-analysis05/BNStory/International/columnists  "Weight of the world too heavy for G8 shoulders,"] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/5gP5XYiqk?url=http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20080704.wG8-analysis05/BNStory/International/columnists |date=2009-04-29 }} ''Globe and Mail'' (Toronto). July 5, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the [[President of the European Commission]] has been formally included in summits since 1981.&lt;ref name="reuters_what"&gt;Reuters: [http://uk.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUKB26280520080703?sp=true  "Factbox: The Group of Eight: what is it?"], July 3, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;  The summits were not meant to be linked formally with wider international institutions; and in fact, a mild rebellion against the stiff formality of other international meetings was a part of the genesis of cooperation between France's President [[Giscard d'Estaing]] and West Germany's Chancellor [[Helmut Schmidt]] as they conceived the [[1st G6 summit|initial summit]] of the [[G8#History|Group of Six]] ([[G8#History|G6]]) in 1975.&lt;ref name="reinalda205"&gt;Reinalda, Bob and Bertjan Verbeek.

The G8 summits during the 21st-century have inspired widespread debates, protests and demonstrations; and the two- or three-day event becomes more than the sum of its parts, elevating the participants, the issues and the venue as focal points for activist pressure.&lt;ref name="bond1"&gt;[http://www.bond.org.uk/pages/g8.html "Influencing Policy on International Development: G8,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513215909/http://www.bond.org.uk/pages/g8.html |date=2012-05-13 }} BOND (British Overseas NGOs for Development). 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Leaders at the summit==
The G8 is an unofficial annual forum for the leaders of Canada, the European Commission, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Russia, the United Kingdom and the United States.&lt;ref name="reuters_what"/&gt;

The 27th G8 summit was the first summit for [[Prime Minister of Japan|Japanese Prime Minister]] [[Junichirō Koizumi]] and [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]].

==Priorities==
Traditionally, the host country of the G8 summit sets the agenda for negotiations, which take place primarily amongst multi-national [[civil servants]] in the weeks before the summit itself, leading to a joint declaration which all countries can agree to sign.

==Issues==
The summit was intended as a venue for resolving differences among its members. As a practical matter, the summit was also conceived as an opportunity for its members to give each other mutual encouragement in the face of difficult economic decisions.&lt;ref name="reinalda205"/&gt;

The overall theme of the summit was ways to reduce poverty. Topics discussed at the meeting included an evaluation of the [[Enhanced HIPC Initiative]] which involved [[Debt relief|debt forgiveness]] to [[Heavily Indebted Poor Countries]], the [[Global Health Fund]], the [[global digital divide]], the [[Environmentalism|environment]] and [[food security]]. Although the main summit was from July 20 to the 22nd, the summit was preceded by a meeting of the G8 [[foreign minister]]s on the 18th and 19th.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.g8italia.it/_en/docs/KJIHGZ31.htm] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070414225454/http://www.g8italia.it/_en/docs/KJIHGZ31.htm |date=April 14, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summit was overshadowed by riots in the city after a crackdown by police targeting [[anti-globalisation]] groups and the death of a 23-year-old [[Carlo Giuliani]], leading some to talk of a deliberately followed [[strategy of tension]].

Before the summit, significant controversies and ridicule among local people and media focused on the security plans (such as fences going through streets and inside houses) and image provisions (such as the prohibition to dry up the [[laundry]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Genoese Laundry Deemed Unsuitable For G8 Leaders|url=http://www.shortnews.com/start.cfm?id=8326|date=2001-07-17|publisher=[[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

==Citizens' responses and authorities' counter-responses==

=== Protests ===
[[File:Genova-G8 2001-Incidenti a Corso Torino.jpg|thumbnail|right|Protesters burn a Carabinieri vehicle.]] 
The Genoa [[Group of Eight]] Summit protest, from July 18 to July 22, 2001, was a dramatic [[protest]], drawing an estimated 200,000 demonstrators. Dozens were hospitalized following clashes with police and night raids by security forces on two schools housing activists and independent journalists. People taken into custody after the raids have alleged severe abuse at the hands of police.

Demonstrators accused the police of brutality and denying them their right to non-violent protest. They believe that G8 summits are non-legitimate attempts by eight of the world's most powerful governments to set the rules for the planet at large. Police and many politicians argued that attempting to blockade a meeting is in itself a violent event and an attempt to impede the workings of democratically elected governments. {{citation needed|reason=The Italian government led by Premier [[Silvio Berlusconi]] insisted that police used the minimum amount of force necessary to achieve their goals. It claimed that the protesters' claims were exaggerated|date=October 2015}}.

The G8 meeting was held inside a "Red Zone" in the center of town that had been declared off-limits for non-residents and surrounded by a barricade, leaving protesters no chance to communicate with summit delegates. Fears of a terrorist attack at the time had also led to an [[air exclusion zone]] around the city, as well as the stationing of [[Surface-to-air missile|anti-aircraft missile]]s.  Only one activist, Valérie Vie, secretary of a French branch of [[ATTAC]], managed to publicly breach the Red Zone barrier, but was immediately arrested by police agents.  There were also several border [[riot]]s ahead of the summit, as police attempted to prevent suspected activists from entering Italy.  The Italian government suspended [[freedom of movement]] entitled by the [[Schengen treaty]] for the duration of the G8 summit, in order to monitor the movement of the many protesters arriving from across the [[European Union]].

===Injuries and deaths===

Many demonstrators were injured and dozens more arrested over the course of the event. Most of those 329 arrested were charged with [[criminal conspiracy]] to commit destruction; but they were in most part released shortly thereafter because judges declared the charges invalid. Police continued to raid social centers, media centers, union buildings and legal offices across Italy after the summit as part of ongoing investigations. Over 400 protesters and about 100 among security forces were injured during the clashes.

On July 20, a 23-year-old activist [[Carlo Giuliani]] of Genoa, was shot dead by Mario Placanica, a [[Carabiniere]], during clashes with police. Images show Giuliani throwing a fire extinguisher at the carabiniere's vehicle before he was shot and then run over twice by the Land Rover. Placanica was acquitted from any wrongdoing, as judges determined he fired in self-defence and to the sky but a flying stone deflected the bullet and killed Giuliani.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/11/30/g8-festa-in-caserma-dopo-il-morto.html "G8, festa in caserma dopo il morto,"] ''Repubblica.'' November 30, 2006. {{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Activist Susanne Bendotti was struck by a vehicle and killed while attempting to cross the French-Italian border at Ventimiglia to get to the Genoa demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;"Susanne Bendotti, 43 anni, francese, voleva raggiungere Genova," [[RAI News]]. June 21, 2001.{{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Charges===
In December 2007, 25 demonstrators were condemned for property damage and looting.
 
Numerous police officers and local and national officials have been ordered to stand trial in connection with the event. In one trial, 28 police officials are standing trial on charges related to the two night raids, charged with conspiracy to pervert the course of justice, use of excessive force and planting evidence. In other proceedings, 45 state officials, including prison guards, police and medics, are being tried for abusing detainees in their custody at [[Bolzaneto]] who were arrested during the raid. Detainees reported being spat at, verbally and physically humiliated, and threatened with rape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Trial forces Italy to relive shocking police brutality | url = http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article318852.ece | publisher = The Independent | date = 2005-10-12 | accessdate = 2007-08-05 | location = London | first = Peter | last = Popham | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071001082111/http://news.independent.co.uk/europe/article318852.ece | archive-date = 2007-10-01 | dead-url = yes | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Police conducted nighttime raids upon centers housing protesters and campsites, most notably the [[2001 raid on the Diaz school|attacks on the Diaz-Pascoli and Diaz-Pertini schools]] shortly after midnight on July 21. These were being used as sleeping quarters, and had also been set up as centers for those providing media, medical, and legal support work. Police baton attacks left three activists, including British journalist Mark Covell, in comas. At least one person has suffered brain damage, while another had both jaws and fourteen teeth broken. In total, over 60 were severely injured and a [[parliamentary inquiry]] was launched.&lt;ref&gt;Carroll, Rory. [https://www.theguardian.com/international/story/0,3604,526484,00.html  "Genoa raid was police 'revenge',"] ''The Guardian'' (London). July 24, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; It concluded no wrongdoing on the part of police.

Ninety-three people were arrested during the raids. In May, 2003, Judge Anna Ivaldi concluded that they had put up no resistance whatsoever to the police and all charges were dropped against them. During the inquiry, Pietro Troiani, the deputy police chief in Genoa, admitted to being involved in the planting of Molotov cocktails in order to justify the Diaz School raids, as well as faking the stabbing of a police officer to frame activists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/2636647.stm "Genoa police 'admit fabrication',"] BBC. January 7, 2003;  [http://www.fair.org/index.php?page=100 FAIR (Fairness and Accuracy in Reporting):] [http://www.fair.org/activism/genoa-update.html "Media Missing New Evidence About Genoa Violence."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314122126/http://www.fair.org/activism/genoa-update.html |date=2012-03-14 }} January 10, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, twenty-nine police officers were indicted for grievous bodily harm, planting evidence and wrongful arrest during a night-time raid on the Diaz School. The [[Molotov cocktail]]s were reported in January 2007, during the trial of the policemen, to have disappeared.&lt;ref&gt;[[Statewatch]], "[http://www.statewatch.org/news/2007/jan/07genoa-trial.htm Italy: G8-Genoa policemen's trial suspended as planted molotov cocktails disappear]." Cites ''[[La Repubblica]]'', 18.1.2007, and ''[[Il manifesto]]'', 19.1.2007&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Romano Prodi]]'s left-wing ''[[L'Unione]]'' coalition voted to create a Parliamentary Commission on the Genoa events&lt;ref&gt;[[Parliament of Italy]]: [http://www.camera.it/_dati/leg15/lavori/bollet/200707/0712/html/01/comunic.htm ''"Commissione parlamentare di inchiesta sui fatti accaduti a Genova in occasione del vertice G8."''] July 12, 2007; [http://bellaciao.org/it/article.php3?id_article=17154  ''"OK Commissione a testo base per inchiesta camera,"''] ''Bellacio.'' August 2, 2007.{{it icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this commission was refused by Senate's vote.

On July 14, 13 Italian Carabineri, GOMPI Mobile and prison police were convicted for abuse of authority, abuse of office and uniform. Other charges include abuse and negligence. Two medical staff were also convicted. None will go to jail due to statute of limitations.

On November 13, an Italian court cleared 16 of the most senior police officers of any wrongdoing in the incidents of the 2001 G8 summit.&lt;ref&gt;Squires, Nick. [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/3457851/Italian-court-sparks-outrage-by-clearing-16-senior-policemen-in-G8-Genoa-Case.html "Italian court sparks outrage by clearing 16 senior policemen in G8 Genoa Case,"] ''The Telegraph'' (London). November 14, 2008. Retrieved on November 16, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Thirteen police officers were convicted of their various crimes during the Diaz raid including Vincenzo Canterini (four years), the commander of the 7th Mobile unit. None will go to jail due to statute of limitations.

However, on appeal in 2010, many of the findings were overturned, and several more senior police officers received prison sentences and disqualifications from public office. Twenty-five of the 27 original defendants were finally convicted. In statements during the trial, the prosecution cited "the terrible injuries inflicted on defenceless people, the premeditation, the covered faces, the falsification of statements by the 93 anti-globalisation protesters, the lies about their alleged resistance [to arrest]."&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, John. [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/may/19/g8-italian-police-sentenced "Top Italian policemen get up to five years for violent attack on G8 protesters."] ''The Guardian''. May 19, 2010. Retrieved May 26, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Italian government was later brought to trial in the [[European Court of Human Rights]]. In April 2017 the case for Bolzaneto station was dismissed as Italy and victims made an off-court refunding deal with the Italian government paying €45,000 per victim and acknowledging the extreme use of violence. On October 2017, the European Court issued two sentences against Italy, the first time declaring that torture was clearly used against the contestants on the Diaz school case, and the second time inflicting a penal fee to Italy for lacking a Torture Law in its penal code, meaning that the Genoa events could not be properly sentenced at the time as unmotivated violence leading to torture.&lt;ref&gt;https://global.ilmanifesto.it/genoa-predictable-torture-italy-condemned-again/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ansa.it/english/news/general_news/2017/10/26/echr-condemns-italy-for-bolzaneto-3_80868aa7-7a87-4a6a-8ba8-fcc1a9435842.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adnkronos.com/aki-en/security/2017/06/22/police-committed-torture-genoa-summit-rules-european-court_hWJREw2u0yStZGiSPOYhrN.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Anarchism]]''' has had a special interest on the issue of '''[[education]]''' from the works of [[William Godwin]]&lt;ref name="infed.org"&gt;[http://www.infed.org/thinkers/et-good.htm "william godwin and informal education" by infed]&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Max Stirner]]&lt;ref name="tmh.floonet.net"&gt;[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html Introduction to ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]' by [[Max Stirner]] by James J. Martin] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515103317/http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |date=May 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; onwards.

A wide diversity of issues related to education have gained the attention of anarchist theorists and activists. They have included the role of education in [[social control]] and [[socialization]], the rights and liberties of youth and children within educational contexts, the inequalities encouraged by current educational systems, the influence of state and religious [[ideologies]] in the education of people, the division between social and manual work and its relationship with education, [[sex education]] and [[art education]].

Various alternatives to contemporary mainstream educational systems and their problems have been proposed by anarchists which have gone from [[alternative education]] systems and environments, [[self-education]], advocacy of [[Youth rights|youth]] and [[children rights]], and [[freethought]] activism.

==Early anarchist views on education==

===William Godwin===
[[File:WilliamGodwin.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[William Godwin]]]]For English [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] anarchist [[William Godwin]] education was "the main means by which change would be achieved."&lt;ref name="infed.org"/&gt; Godwin saw that the main goal of education should be the promotion of happiness.&lt;ref name="infed.org"/&gt; For Godwin, education had to have "A respect for the child’s autonomy which precluded any form of coercion", "A pedagogy that respected this and sought to build on the child’s own motivation and initiatives" and "A concern about the child’s capacity to resist an ideology transmitted through the school."&lt;ref name="infed.org"/&gt;

In his ''[[Political Justice]]'' he criticizes state sponsored schooling "on account of its obvious alliance with national government".&lt;ref name="web.bilkent.edu.tr"&gt;[http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pj68.html [[Political Justice]] by [[William Godwin]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902020059/http://web.bilkent.edu.tr/Online/www.english.upenn.edu/jlynch/Frank/Godwin/pj68.html |date=September 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For him the State "will not fail to employ it to strengthen its hands, and perpetuate its institutions.".&lt;ref name="web.bilkent.edu.tr"/&gt; He thought "It is not true that our youth ought to be instructed to venerate the constitution, however excellent; they should be instructed to venerate truth; and the constitution only so far as it corresponded with their independent deductions of truth.".&lt;ref name="web.bilkent.edu.tr"/&gt; A long work on the subject of education to consider is ''The Enquirer.  Reflections On Education, Manners, And Literature.  In A Series Of Essays.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/godwin/enquirer.html ''The Enquirer.  Reflections On Education, Manners, And Literature.  In A Series Of Essays.'' by [[William Godwin]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120302000916/http://dwardmac.pitzer.edu/anarchist_archives/godwin/enquirer.html |date=March 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Max Stirner===
[[File:Stirner-kar1900.jpg|180px|right|thumb|[[Max Stirner]]]][[Max Stirner]] was a German philosopher linked mainly with the anarchist school of thought known as [[individualist anarchism]] who worked as a schoolteacher in a [[gym]]nasium for young girls.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', volume 8, The Macmillan Company and The Free Press, New York 1967&lt;/ref&gt; He examines the subject of education directly in his long essay ''[[The False Principle of our Education]]''. In it "we discern his persistent pursuit of the goal of individual self-awareness and his insistence on the centering of everything around the individual personality".&lt;ref name="tmh.floonet.net"/&gt; As such Stirner "in education, all of the given material has value only in so far as children learn to do something with it, to use it".&lt;ref name="tmh.floonet.net"/&gt; In that essay he deals with the debates between realist and humanistic educational  commentators and sees that both "are concerned with the learner as an object, someone to be acted upon rather than one encouraged to move toward subjective self-realization and liberation" and sees that "a knowledge which only burdens me as a belonging and a possession, instead of having gone along with me completely so that the free-moving ego, not encumbered by any dragging possessions, passes through the world with a fresh spirit, such a knowledge then, which has not become personal, furnishes a poor preparation for life".&lt;ref name="tmh.floonet.net"/&gt;

He concludes this essay by saying that "the necessary decline of non-voluntary learning and rise of the self-assured will which perfects itself in the glorious sunlight of the free person may be expressed somewhat as follows: knowledge must die and rise again as will and create itself anew each day as a free person.".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html [[The False Principle of our Education]]' by [[Max Stirner]]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515103317/http://tmh.floonet.net/articles/falseprinciple.html |date=May 15, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stirner thus saw education "is to be life and there, as outside of it, the self-revelation of the individual is to be the task."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; For him "pedagogy should not proceed any further towards civilizing, but toward the development of free men, sovereign characters".&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=== Josiah Warren ===
[[File:Josiah Warren.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[Josiah Warren]]]][[Josiah Warren]] is widely regarded as the first American [[anarchist]].&lt;ref name=Slate&gt;Palmer, Brian (2010-12-29) [http://www.slate.com/id/2279457/ What do anarchists want from us?], ''[[Slate.com]]''&lt;/ref&gt; "Where utopian projectors starting with [[Plato]] entertained the idea of creating an ideal species through eugenics and education and a set of universally valid institutions inculcating shared identities, Warren wanted to dissolve such identities in a solution of individual self-sovereignty. His educational experiments, for example, possibly under the influence of the...Swiss educational theorist [[Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi]] (via [[Robert Owen]]), emphasized—as we would expect—the nurturing of the independence and the conscience of individual children, not the inculcation of pre-conceived values."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.crispinsartwell.com/warrenintrocurrent.htm |title="Introduction of The Practical Anarchist: Writings of Josiah Warren" by Crispin Sartwell |access-date=2012-02-20 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110430010738/http://www.crispinsartwell.com/warrenintrocurrent.htm |archive-date=2011-04-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The classics and the late 19th century==

===Mikhail Bakunin===
On "Equal Opportunity in Education"&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Michail_Bakunin__Equal_Opportunity_in_Education.html "Equal Opportunity in Education" by [[Mikhail Bakunin]]]&lt;/ref&gt; Russian anarchist [[Mikhail Bakunin]] denounced what he saw as the social inequalities caused by the current educational systems. He put this issue in this way "will it be feasible for the working masses to know complete emancipation as long as the education available to those masses continues to be inferior to that bestowed upon the bourgeois, or, in more general terms, as long as there exists any class, be it numerous or otherwise, which, by virtue of birth, is entitled to a superior education and a more complete instruction? Does not the question answer itself?..."&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;

He also denounced that "Consequently while some study others must labour so that they can produce what we need to live — not just producing for their own needs, but also for those men who devote themselves exclusively to intellectual pursuits.&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt; As a solution to this Bakunin proposed that "Our answer to that is a simple one: everyone must work and everyone must receive education...for work's sake as much as for the sake of science, there must no longer be this division into workers and scholars and henceforth there must be only men. "&lt;ref name="theanarchistlibrary.org"/&gt;
[[File:Bakunin2.jpg|180px|right|thumb|180px|[[Mikhail Bakunin]]]]

===Peter Kropotkin===
[[File:Young Kropotkin.png|180px|left|thumb|180px|[[Peter Kropotkin]]]]Russian [[anarcho-communist]] theorist [[Peter Kropotkin]] suggested in "Brain Work and Manual Work" that "The masses of the workmen do not receive more scientific education than their grandfathers did; but they have been deprived of the education of even the small workshop, while their boys and girls are driven into a mine, or a factory, from the age of thirteen, and there they soon forget the little they may have learned at school. As to the scientists, they despise manual labour."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Brain_Work_and_Manual_Work.html "Brain Work and Manual Work" by [[Peter Kropotkin]]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Petr_Kropotkin__Fields__Factories_and_Workshops__or_Industry_Combined_with_Agriculture_and_Brain_Work_with_Manual_Work.html ''[[Fields, Factories and Workshops|Fields, Factories and Workshops: or Industry Combined with Agriculture and Brain Work with Manual Work]]'' by [[Peter Kropotkin]]]&lt;/ref&gt; So for Kropotkin "We fully recognise the necessity of specialisation of knowledge, but we maintain that specialisation must follow general education, and that general education must be given in science and handicraft alike. To the division of society into brainworkers and manual workers we oppose the combination of both kinds of activities; and instead of `technical education,' which means the maintenance of the present division between brain work and manual work, we advocate the éducation intégrale, or complete education, which means the disappearance of that pernicious distinction."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==The Early 20th century==

===Leo Tolstoy===
[[File:L.N.Tolstoy Prokudin-Gorsky.jpg|right|thumb|180px|[[Leo Tolstoy]], influential [[christian anarchist]] and [[Anarcho-pacifism|anarcho pacifist]] theorist]]The Russian [[christian anarchist]] and famous novelist [[Leo Tolstoy]] established a school for peasant children on his estate.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Matt_Hern__The_Emergence_of_Compulsory_Schooling_and_Anarchist_Resistance.html "The Emergence of Compulsory Schooling and Anarchist Resistance" by Matt Hern]&lt;/ref&gt; Tolstoy returned to Yasnaya Polyana and founded thirteen schools for his serfs' children, based on the principles Tolstoy described in his 1862 essay "The School at Yasnaya Polyana".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Tolstoy | first = Lev N. |author2=Leo Wiener |author3=translator and editor  | title = The School at Yasnaya Polyana - The Complete Works of Count Tolstoy: Pedagogical Articles.

Tolstoy differentiated between education and culture.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; He wrote that "Education is the tendency of one man to make another just like himself... Education is culture under restraint, culture is free. [Education is] when the teaching is forced upon the pupil, and when then instruction is exclusive, that is when only those subjects are taught which the educator regards as necessary".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; For him "without compulsion, education was transformed into culture".&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

===Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia and the Modern schools===
{{main|Escuela Moderna}}
[[File:Francisco Ferrer Guardia.jpg|150px|left|thumb|[[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], [[Catalan people|Catalan]] anarchist pedagogue]]In 1901, [[Catalan people|Catalan]] anarchist and [[Freethought|free-thinker]] [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]] established "modern" or [[Progressive education|progressive schools]] in [[Barcelona]] in defiance of an educational system controlled by the Catholic Church.&lt;ref name="Fidler"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Geoffrey C. Fidler |date=Spring–Summer 1985 |title=The Escuela Moderna Movement of Francisco Ferrer: "Por la Verdad y la Justicia" |journal=History of Education Quarterly |volume=25 |issue=1/2 |pages=103–132 |id= |jstor=368893 |doi=10.2307/368893}}&lt;/ref&gt; The schools' stated goal was to "[[educate the working class]] in a rational, secular and non-coercive setting". Fiercely anti-clerical, Ferrer believed in "freedom in education", education free from the authority of church and state.&lt;ref&gt;[http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html Francisco Ferrer's Modern School] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100807032003/http://flag.blackened.net/revolt/spain/ferrer.html |date=2010-08-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Murray Bookchin]] wrote: "This period [1890s] was the heyday of libertarian schools and pedagogical projects in all areas of the country where Anarchists exercised some degree of influence. Perhaps the best-known effort in this field was Francisco Ferrer's Modern School (Escuela Moderna), a project which exercised a considerable influence on Catalan education and on experimental techniques of teaching generally."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 7, ''[[anarcho-syndicalism|Anarchosyndicalism]], The New Ferment''. In Murray Bookchin, ''[[The Spanish Anarchists: The Heroic Years, 1868–1936]]''. AK Press, 1998, p.115. {{ISBN|1-873176-04-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; La Escuela Moderna, and Ferrer's ideas generally, formed the inspiration for a series of ''[[Modern School (United States)|Modern Schools]]'' in the [[United States]],&lt;ref name="Fidler"/&gt; [[Cuba]], [[South America]] and [[London]]. The first of these was started in [[New York City]] in 1911. It also inspired the Italian newspaper ''[[Università popolare (Italian newspaper)|Università popolare]]'', founded in 1901.

Ferrer wrote an extensive work on education and on his educational experiments called ''The Origin and Ideals of the Modern School''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Francisco_Ferrer__The_Origin_and_Ideals_of_the_Modern_School.html#toc8 [[Francisco Ferrer]]. ''The Origin and Ideals of the Modern School'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==== The Modern School movement in the United States ====
{{main|Modern School (United States)}}
[[Image:The Modern School in New York City, circa 1911-12.jpg|thumb|190px|right|The NYC Modern School, ca. 1911–1912, Principal Will Durant and pupils. This photograph was the cover of the first issue of ''The Modern School'' magazine.]]The Modern Schools, also called Ferrer Schools, were [[United States]] [[school]]s, established in the early twentieth century, that were modeled after the [[Escuela Moderna]] of [[Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia]], the Catalan educator and [[anarchism|anarchist]]. They were an important part of the anarchist, [[Anarchistic free school|free schooling]], [[socialism|socialist]], and [[labor movement]]s in the U.S., intended to educate the working-classes from a [[secular]], [[class-conscious]] perspective. The Modern Schools imparted day-time academic classes for children, and night-time continuing-education lectures for adults.

The first, and most notable, of the Modern Schools was founded in New York City, in 1911, two years after Francesc Ferrer i Guàrdia's execution for [[sedition]] in monarchist Spain on 18 October 1909. Commonly called the Ferrer Center, it was founded by notable anarchists — including [[Leonard Dalton Abbott|Leonard Abbott]], [[Alexander Berkman]], [[Voltairine de Cleyre]], and [[Emma Goldman]] — first meeting on [[St. Mark's Place]], in Manhattan's [[Lower East Side, Manhattan|Lower East Side]], but twice moved elsewhere, first within lower Manhattan, then to [[Harlem]]. The Ferrer Center opened with only nine students, one being the son of [[Margaret Sanger]], the [[contraceptives]]-rights activist. Starting in 1912, the school's principal was the philosopher [[Will Durant]], who also taught there. Besides Berkman and Goldman, the Ferrer Center faculty included the [[Ashcan School]] painters [[Robert Henri]] and [[George Bellows]], and its guest lecturers included writers and political activists such as Margaret Sanger, [[Jack London]], and [[Upton Sinclair]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Paul Avrich|Avrich, Paul]], ''[[The Modern School Movement]]'', AK Press (2005), p.212: At the Ferrer Center, Berkman was called “The Pope”, Goldman was called “The Red Queen”.&lt;/ref&gt; Student Magda Schoenwetter, recalled that the school used [[Montessori]] methods and equipment, and emphasised academic freedom rather than fixed subjects, such as spelling and arithmetic.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''[[Anarchist Voices: An Oral History of Anarchism in America]]'', “Interview with Magda Schoenwetter”, AK Press (2005), {{ISBN|1-904859-27-5}}, {{ISBN|978-1-904859-27-7}}, p.230: “What everybody is yowling about now — freedom in education — we had then, though I still can’t spell or do multiplication.”&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Modern School'' magazine originally began as a newsletter for parents, when the school was in New York City, printed with the manual [[printing press]] used in teaching printing as a profession. After moving to the Stelton Colony, New Jersey, the magazine's content expanded to poetry, prose, art, and libertarian education articles; the cover emblem and interior graphics were designed by [[Rockwell Kent]]. Artists and writers, among them [[Hart Crane]] and [[Wallace Stevens]], praised ''The Modern School'' as “the most beautifully printed magazine in existence.”

After the 4 July 1914 [[Lexington Avenue bombing]], the police investigated and several times raided the Ferrer Center and other labor and anarchist organisations in New York City.&lt;ref name=Avrich&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''The Modern School Movement''. Princeton: Princeton University Press (1980); Avrich, Paul, ''[[Anarchist Portraits]]'', Princeton: Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-00609-1}} (1988)&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging the urban danger to their school, the organizers bought 68 acres (275,000 m²) in [[Piscataway Township, New Jersey]], and moved there in 1914, becoming the center of the Stelton Colony. Moreover, beyond New York City, the [[Ferrer Colony and Modern School]] was founded (ca. 1910–1915) as a Modern School-based community, that endured some forty years. In 1933, James and Nellie Dick, who earlier had been principals of the Stelton Modern School, founded the Modern School in [[Lakewood, New Jersey]],&lt;ref name=Avrich/&gt; which survived the original Modern School, the Ferrer Center, becoming the final surviving such school, lasting until 1958.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.educationrevolution.org/aerogramme11.html AERO-GRAMME #11: The Alternative Education Resource Organization Newsletter] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929213939/http://www.educationrevolution.org/aerogramme11.html |date=2011-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emma Goldman ===
[[File:Emma Goldman 2.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[Emma Goldman]]]]In an essay entitled "The child and its enemies" [[Lithuanian American|Lithuanian-American]] [[anarcha-feminist]] [[Emma Goldman]] manifested that "The child shows its individual tendencies in its plays, in its questions, in its association with people and things. But it has to struggle with everlasting external interference in its world of thought and emotion. It must not express itself in harmony with its nature, with its growing personality. It must become a thing, an object. Its questions are met with narrow, conventional, ridiculous replies, mostly based on falsehoods; and, when, with large, wondering, innocent eyes, it wishes to behold the wonders of the world, those about it quickly lock the windows and doors, and keep the delicate human plant in a hothouse atmosphere, where it can neither breathe nor grow freely."&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emma_Goldman__The_Child_and_its_enemies.html [[Emma Goldman]]. "The Child and its enemies."]&lt;/ref&gt; Goldman in the essay entitled "The Social Importance of the Modern School" saw that "the school of today, no matter whether public, private, or parochial...is for the child what the prison is for the convict and the barracks for the soldier — a place where everything is being used to break the will of the child, and then to pound, knead, and shape it into a being utterly foreign to itself."&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"&gt;[http://www.theanarchistlibrary.org/HTML/Emma_Goldman__The_Social_Importance_of_the_Modern_School.html [[Emma Goldman]]. "The Social Importance of the Modern School"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In this way "it will be necessary to realize that education of children is not synonymous with herdlike drilling and training. If education should really mean anything at all, it must insist upon the free growth and development of the innate forces and tendencies of the child. In this way alone can we hope for the free individual and eventually also for a free community, which shall make interference and coercion of human growth impossible."&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"/&gt;

Goldman in her essay on the Modern School also dealt with the issue of [[Sex education]]. She denounced that "educators also know the evil and sinister results of ignorance in sex matters. Yet, they have neither understanding nor humanity enough to break down the wall which puritanism has built around sex...If in childhood both man and woman were taught a beautiful comradeship, it would neutralize the oversexed condition of both and would help woman's emancipation much more than all the laws upon the statute books and her right to vote."&lt;ref name="ReferenceE"/&gt;

==Later 20th century and contemporary times==
{{main|Anarchistic free school|Deschooling Society|Unschooling}}
Experiments in Germany led to [[A. S. Neill]] founding what became [[Summerhill School]] in 1921.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Purkis | first = Jon | title = Changing Anarchism | publisher = Manchester University Press | location = Manchester | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-7190-6694-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Summerhill is often cited as an example of anarchism in practice.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Vincent (2010) ''Modern Political Ideologies'', 3rd edition, Oxford, Wiley-Blackwell p.129&lt;/ref&gt; British anarchists [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]] manifested that "A.S. Neill is the modern pioneer of libertarian education and of “hearts not heads in the school”. Although he has denied being an anarchist, it would be hard to know how else to describe his philosophy, though he is correct in recognising the difference between revolution in philosophy and pedagogy, and the revolutionary change of society. They are associated but not the same thing."&lt;ref&gt;[http://theanarchistlibrary.org/library/stuart-christie-albert-meltzer-the-floodgates-of-anarchy [[Stuart Christie]] and [[Albert Meltzer]]. ''The Floodgates of Anarchy'']&lt;/ref&gt; However, although Summerhill and other [[Democratic education|free schools]] are radically libertarian, they differ in principle from those of Ferrer by not advocating an overtly political [[class struggle]]-approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Judith |last=Suissa |url=http://newhumanist.org.uk/1288/anarchy-in-the-classroom|title= Anarchy in the classroom |journal=[[The New Humanist]] |volume=120 |issue=5 |date=September–October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Herbert Read ===
The English anarchist philosopher, art critic and poet, [[Herbert Read]] developed a strong interest in the subject of education and particularly in [[art education]]. Read's anarchism was influenced by [[William Godwin]], [[Peter Kropotkin]] and [[Max Stirner]]. Read "became deeply interested in children’s drawings and paintings after having been invited to collect works for an exhibition of British art that would tour allied and neutral countries during the Second World War. As it was considered too risky to transport across the Atlantic works of established importance to the national heritage, it was proposed that children’s drawings and paintings should be sent instead. Read, in making his collection, was unexpectedly moved by the expressive power and emotional content of some of the younger artist’s works. The experience prompted his special attention to their cultural value, and his engagement of the theory of children’s creativity with seriousness matching his devotion to the avant-garde. This work both changed fundamentally his own life’s work throughout his remaining twenty-five years and provided art education with a rationale of unprecedented lucidity and persuasiveness. Key books and pamphlets resulted: ''Education through Art'' (Read, 1943); ''The Education of Free Men'' (Read, 1944); ''Culture and Education in a World Order'' (Read, 1948); ''The Grass Read'', (1955); and ''Redemption of the Robot'' (1970)".&lt;ref name="ibe.unesco.org"&gt;[http://www.ibe.unesco.org/fileadmin/user_upload/archive/publications/ThinkersPdf/reade.pdf David Thistlewood. "HERBERT READ (1893–1968)"  in ''PROSPECTS: the quarterly review of comparative education''. Paris, UNESCO: International Bureau of Education, vol. 24, no.1/2, 1994, p. 375–90]&lt;/ref&gt;

Read "elaborated a socio-cultural dimension of creative education, offering the notion of greater international understanding and cohesiveness rooted in principles of developing the fully balanced personality through art education. Read argued in Education through Art that "every child, is said to be a potential neurotic capable of being saved from this prospect, if early, largely inborn, creative abilities were not repressed by conventional Education. Everyone is an artist of some kind whose special abilities, even if almost insignificant, must be encouraged as contributing to an infinite richness of collective life. Read’s newly expressed view of an essential ‘continuity’ of
child and adult creativity in everyone represented a  synthesis' the two opposed models of twentieth-century art education that had predominated until this point...Read did not offer a curriculum but a theoretical defence of the genuine and true. His claims for genuineness and truth were based on the overwhelming evidence of characteristics revealed in his study of child art...From 1946 until his death in 1968 he was president of the Society for Education in Art (SEA), the renamed ATG, in which capacity he had a platform for addressing [[UNESCO]]...On the basis of such representation Read, with others, succeeded in establishing the International Society for Education through Art (INSEA)
as an executive arm of UNESCO in 1954."&lt;ref name="ibe.unesco.org"/&gt;"

===Paul Goodman===
[[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]] was an important anarchist critic of contemporary educational systems as can be seen in his books  ''[[Growing Up Absurd]]'' and ''[[Compulsory Mis-education]]''. Goodman believed that in contemporary societies "It is in the schools and from the mass media, rather than at home or from their friends, that the mass of our citizens in all classes learn that life is inevitably routine, depersonalized, venally graded; that it is best to toe the mark and shut up; that there is no place for spontaneity, open sexuality and free spirit. Trained in the schools they go on to the same quality of jobs, culture and politics. This is education, miseducation socializing to the national norms and regimenting to the nation's "needs" "&lt;ref name="mises.org"&gt;[http://mises.org/journals/jls/2_4/2_4_7.pdf ROBERT H. CHAPPELL. ANARCHY REVISITED: AN INQUIRY INTO THE PUBLIC EDUCATION DILEMMA. Journal of Libertarian Studies Vol. 2, No.4, pp 357-372 Pergamon Press. 1978.]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Commented out: [[File:Paul Goodman.jpg|180px|left|thumb|[[Paul Goodman (writer)|Paul Goodman]], american anarchist writer of ''[[Growing Up Absurd|Growing Up Absurd: Problems of Youth in the Organized Society]]'']] --&gt;
Goodman thought that a person's most valuable educational experiences "occur outside the school. Participation in the activities of society should be the chief means of learning. Instead of requiring students to succumb to the theoretical drudgery of textbook learning, Goodman recommends that education be transferred into  factories, museums, parks, department stores, etc, where the students can actively participate in their education...The ideal schools would take the form of small discussion groups of no more than twenty individuals. As has been indicated, these groups would utilize any effective environment that would be relevant to the interest of the group. Such education would be necessarily non-compulsory, for any compulsion to attend places authority in an external body disassociated from the needs and aspirations of the students. Moreover, compulsion retards and impedes the students' ability to learn."&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt; As far as the current educational system Goodman thought that "The basic intention behind the compulsory attendance laws is not only to insure the socialization process but also to control the labour supply quantitatively within an industrialized economy characterized by unemployment and inflation. The public schools and universities have become large holding tanks of potential workers."&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

===Ivan Illich===
The term [[deschooling]] was popularized by [[Ivan Illich]], who argued that the school as an institution is dysfunctional for self-determined learning and serves the creation of a consumer society instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Illich| first=Ivan |title=Deschooling Society |place= New York|publisher= Harper and Row| year= 1971| isbn= 0-06-012139-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Illich thought that "the dismantling of the public education system would coincide with a pervasive abolition of all the suppressive institutions of society".&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt; Illich "charges public schooling with institutionalizing acceptable moral and behavioral standards and with constitutionally violating the [[Youth rights|rights of young adults]]...IIlich subscribes to Goodman's belief that most
of the useful education that people acquire is a by-product of work or leisure and not of the school. Illich refers to this process as "informal education". Only through this unrestricted and unregulated form of learning can the individual
gain a sense of self-awareness and develop his creative capacity to its fullest extent.".&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt; Illich thought that the main goals of an alternative education systems should be "to provide access to available resources to all who want to learn: to empower
all who want to share what they know; to find those who want to learn it from them; to furnish all who want to present an issue to the public with the opportunity to make their challenges known. The system of learning webs is aimed at individual freedom and expression in education by using society as the classroom. There would be reference services to index items available for study in laboratories, theatres, airports, libraries, etc.; skill exchanges which would permit people to list their skills so that potential students could contact them; peer-matching, which would communicate an individual's interest so that he or she could find educational associates; reference services to educators at large, which would be a central directory of professionals, para professionals and freelancers.".&lt;ref name="mises.org"/&gt;

=== Colin Ward ===
&lt;!-- [[WP:NFCC]] violation: [[Image:Colin Ward.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Colin Ward in his workroom, October 2003]] --&gt;[[Anarchism in England|English anarchist]] [[Colin Ward]] in his main theoretical publication ''[[Anarchy in Action]]'' (1973) in a chapter called "Schools No Longer" "discusses the genealogy of education and schooling, in particular examining the writings of [[Everett Reimer]] and Ivan Illich, and the beliefs of anarchist educator Paul Goodman.  Many of Colin’s writings in the 1970s, in particular ''Streetwork: The Exploding School'' (1973, with Anthony Fyson), focused on learning practices and spaces outside of the school building. In introducing ''Streetwork'', Ward writes, “[this] is a book about ideas: ideas of the environment as the educational resource, ideas of the enquiring school, the school without walls…”.  In the same year, Ward contributed to ''Education Without Schools'' (edited by Peter Buckman) discussing ‘the role of the state’.  He argued that “one significant role of the state in the national education systems of the world is to perpetuate social and economic injustice”".&lt;ref name="Mills, S. 2010"&gt;[http://www.infed.org/thinkers/colin_ward.htm Mills, S. (2010) 'Colin Ward: The ‘Gentle’ Anarchist and Informal Education’ at ''the encyclopaedia of informal education.'']&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Child in the City'' (1978), and later ''The Child in the Country'' (1988), Ward "examined the everyday spaces of young people’s lives and how they can negotiate and re-articulate the various environments they inhabit. In his earlier text, the more famous of the two, Colin Ward explores the creativity and uniqueness of children and how they cultivate ‘the art of making the city work’. He argued that through play, appropriation and imagination, children can counter adult-based intentions and interpretations of the built environment.  His later text, The Child in the Country, inspired a number of social scientists, notably geographer Chris Philo (1992), to call for more attention to be paid to young people as a ‘hidden’ and marginalised group in society."&lt;ref name="Mills, S. 2010"/&gt;

==History==
The Australian Christian Coalition (ACC) was founded in 1995 by [[John Gagliardi (Australian)|John Gagliardi]],&lt;ref name = RR&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20161120165043/http://newsstore.fairfax.com.au/apps/viewDocument.ac?docID=news951102_0032_5322 Jodie Brough, (2 November 1995), 'Family values' group to target MPs, ''Sydney Morning Herald'', p. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;  a lay leader of a large [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal]] church in [[Brisbane]]. Gagliardi had held journalistic positions as editor of the ''[[Townsville Bulletin]]'' and as a presenter for [[Network Ten|Channel 10]] news.&lt;ref name=Sharpe&gt;{{Cite news|title=Business of God|publisher=Gold Coast Bulletin|date=25 January 2001|first=Brad|last=Sharpe|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:QRPB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0FE1544238F27405&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FB3382EE6AD1E46|location=Australia|accessdate=4 November 2012|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-founders include John McNicoll, a retired [[Baptist]] minister turned lobbyist in Canberra, and John Miller, a Baptist who held lay leadership positions within his Canberra church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www120.secure.griffith.edu.au/rch/file/f517e61a-893c-a73d-df94-9cec0dc8df4f/1/Ranganui_2009_02Thesis.pdf  |title=Religiously inspired political activism: A historical and comparative study |author=Ranganul, Amber|date=January 2009|work=School of Humanities, [[Griffith University]]|accessdate=20 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation changed its name to the Australian Christian Lobby (ACL) in March 2001.&lt;ref name="ACCACL"&gt;{{Citation|title=Historical details for ABN: 40 075 120 517|publisher=Australian Business Register (historical details)|url=http://www.abr.business.gov.au/SearchByAbnHistory.aspx?abn=40075120517|accessdate=14 November 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012 Prime Minister [[Julia Gillard]] cancelled a speech to the ACL's annual conference after the organisation's managing director Jim Wallace argued that the health effects of homosexuality on individuals were worse than smoking.&lt;ref name="Gillard pulls out of Christian Lobby speech"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cullen|first1=Simon|title=Gillard pulls out of Christian Lobby speech in gay marriage row|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-09-06/gillard-pulls-out-of-christian-lobby-speech/4246382|accessdate=30 September 2017|work=ABC News|date=6 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian Christian Lobby has threatened to take the unprecedented step of campaigning against a Coalition government, warning Liberal MPs that it could direct members to support minor right-wing parties if they don't follow their policy of a People's Vote.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.theaustralian.com.au/national-affairs/australian-christian-lobby-threat-to-campaign-against-coalition/news-story/410e8a93d31f3311872003163f9c60b8 {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks===
In October 2014, ACL held a conference at the [[Hyatt Hotel Canberra]] which was followed by complaints to the hotel and a social media campaign directed against it. In response the hotel issued a statement saying they, "don't discriminate against guests who want to conduct lawful business at Hyatt hotels".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/act-news/hyatt-hotel-defends-booking-for-australian-christian-lobbys-antigay-marriage-conference-20141021-1196rn.html|title=Hyatt Hotel defends booking for Australian Christian Lobby's anti-gay marriage conference |date=21 October 2014|work=Canberra Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subsequently, "attracted considerable community support for the commercial rights of the Hyatt and threatened the free-speech credentials of the marriage-equality lobby".&lt;ref name ="Warhurst2"/&gt;  In September 2016, a meeting at a Sydney hotel, planned by ACL to discuss [[same-sex marriage]] issues, had to be cancelled due to "threats of violence" to staff and guests.  The 100 participants subsequently met at another venue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.skynews.com.au/news/national/national/2016/09/17/christian--no--campaign-event-forced-to-fold.html  |title=Christian 'no' campaign event forced to fold |date=17 September 2016|publisher=[[Sky News]]|accessdate=29 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/samesex-marriage-event-off-threats-to-hotel-staff/news-story/d45bd0f9e9a774fc3e3d0741f176da13  |title=Same-sex marriage event off: threats to hotel staff |author=Crowe, David|date=17 September 2016|work=[[The Australian]]|accessdate=29 March 2017|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the campaigning associated with the [[Australian Marriage Law Postal Survey]], the ACL received threats and suspicious packages were sent to their office which necessitated the evacuation of 30 staff at the Canberra mail-centre. The Lobby's offices were also [[Egging|egged]], and received letters containing glitter.&lt;ref name="mail1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://newmatilda.com/2017/08/23/if-you-mail-lyle-shelton-an-envelope-full-of-glitter-hell-pay-for-the-stamp/  |title=If You Mail The Australian Christian Lobby An Envelope Full Of Glitter, They’ll Pay For the Stamp! |author=Graham, Chris|date=25 August 2017|work=[[New Matilda]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mail2"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-08-25/suspicious-packages-addressed-to-acl-causes-evacuation/8844052  |title=Suspicious packages addressed to Australian Christian Lobby cause mail centre evacuation |author=|date=25 August 2017|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|accessdate=25 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/nsw/packages-containing-white-powder-were-on-way-to-australian-christian-lobby/news-story/b1f89eb39960632e7d641b0d26144d62  |title=Packages containing white powder were on way to Australian Christian Lobby |author=McDonough, Keely|date=25 August 2017|work=Daily Telegraph|accessdate=26 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constituency and influence==
One of the main criticisms of the ACL is that it overstates the constituency it represents.&lt;ref name="bfi"/&gt; [[Jim Wallace (Australia)|Jim Wallace]], one time managing director of the ACL, confirmed that the organisation represents its supporters only but stated that they also contact a group of representative theologians representing a number of denominations.&lt;ref name="rn"/&gt;{{who|date=November 2016}}

While its claimed constituency is unproven, [[John Warhurst (academic)|John Warhurst]], emeritus professor of political science at the [[Australian National University]] said that ACL has been successful in establishing itself "in the top echelon of lobbying groups",&lt;ref name ="Warhurst2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-opinion/pressure-groups-and-the-lessons-political-leaders-should-learn-20141029-11dfwi.html|title=Pressure groups and the lessons political leaders should learn|first=John|last=Warhurst|date=29 October 2014|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; has the "professional knowledge to run modern election campaigns"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.theage.com.au/comment/religion-will-play-a-role-in-2016-federal-election-20160510-gos5da.html |title=Religion will play a role in 2016 federal election |author=Warhurst, John|date=11 May 2016|work=The Age|accessdate=12 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "will not go away"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurekastreet.com.au/article.aspx?aeid=42235 |title=The Australian Christian Lobby will not go away |author=|date=3 November 2014|work=[[Eureka Street (magazine)|Eureka Street]]|accessdate=13 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Warhurst notes that ACL as an evangelical lobby group is more politically influential than the [[Family First Party|Family First]] party.&lt;ref name="Warhurst"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Warhurst|first=John|year=2006|title=Religion in 21 st Century Australian National Politics|journal=Papers on Parliament|publisher=Commonwealth of Australia.

Academic assessments of the ACL's influence differ. Professor [[Marion Maddox]], of [[Macquarie University]] said in 2016 that ACL has achieved, "remarkable influence with political leaders on both sides."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/who-are-the-australian-christian-lobby-20160218-gmy67y.html |title=Who are the Australian Christian Lobby? |author=Ireland, Judith|date=19 February 2016|work=[[Sydney Morning Herald]]|accessdate=24 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Geoffrey Robinson, a senior lecturer at [[Deakin University]], stated in 2015 that the ACL's influence had been decreasing since 2013 and the organisation had become only influential on the conservative side of politics.&lt;ref name="Robinson ACL rise and fall"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Robinson|first1=Geoffrey|title=Australian Christian Lobby: the rise and fall of the religious right|url=https://theconversation.com/australian-christian-lobby-the-rise-and-fall-of-the-religious-right-60624|website=The Conversation|accessdate=1 October 2017|date=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former Attorney-General [[Robert McClelland (Australian politician)|Robert McClelland]] said in a speech to the ACL's 2012 conference that those protesting against the organisation would not have recognised that it had supported amendments to 84 pieces of Commonwealth legislation that removed discrimination against same-sex couples.&lt;ref name="brisbanetimes0"&gt;{{Citation|title=Nasty debate 'un-Australian': McClelland|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/breaking-news/nasty-debate-un-australian-mcclelland/news-story/c768d700917c9c9fa0c5094ef9fd05c7|date=6 October 2012|publisher=Brisbane Times|accessdate=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, in 2012 the leader of the Australian Greens [[Christine Milne]] stated that the ACL's "whole focus is to attack the gay community" and as it is a private company with no affiliated churches, it was not suitable for the prime minister to attend its events.&lt;ref name="Gillard pulls out of Christian Lobby speech" /&gt;

Some Christian leaders have stated the ACL's campaigning against gay rights does not represent the stance of all Christians, and several Christian Churches have stated they are frustrated and concerned about the ACL's actions on the issue.&lt;ref name=study&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/queensland/christian-lobby-analysis-reveals-strong-gay-focus-20120608-2017g.html|title=Christian Lobby analysis reveals strong gay focus|date=9 June 2012|work=[[Brisbane Times]]|accessdate=7 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/breaking-news-national/pm-shrugs-off-obamas-gay-marriage-support-20120510-1ye1m.html|title=PM shrugs off Obama's gay marriage support|date=10 May 2012|work=[[WAtoday]]|accessdate=6 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013 Professor Rodney Smith from [[Sydney University]] stated that while the ACL was supported by senior members of the Anglican, Orthodox and Catholic churches, many other members of the churches do not agree with the Lobby's positions.&lt;ref name="PM How powerful is the ACL"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lloyd|first1=Peter|title=How powerful is the Australian Christian Lobby?|url=http://www.abc.net.au/pm/content/2013/s3765154.htm|accessdate=1 October 2017|work=PM|agency=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016 the [[Australian Sex Party]] called for the ACL to be de-registered as a charity on the grounds that its main focus is political campaigning against same-sex marriage.&lt;ref name="Lobby registers Eternity House" /&gt;

The ACL has been described as extremist, influenced by Christian [[Dominion Theology|dominionism]] and [[Christian Reconstructionism|reconstructionism]].&lt;ref name="bfi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dominionist"/&gt; This is denied by the ACL.&lt;ref name="Conspiracy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Blind Faith"/&gt;

==Ancillary organisations==
ACL has established the 'Lachlan Macquarie Institute',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.lmi.org.au |title= Lachlan Macquarie Institute}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a training organisation for public policy influencers.&lt;ref name= "Lachlan Macquarie Institute"/&gt;

[[File:War flag of the Italian Social Republic.svg|thumbnail|right|200px|War flag of the [[Italian Social Republic]], used from 1943-1945, by the Black Brigades, of [[Benito Mussolini]]]] 

The '''''Corpo Ausiliario delle Squadre d'azione di Camicie Nere''''' (Italian: Auxiliary Corps of the Black Shirts' Action Squads), most widely known as the '''Black Brigades''' ({{lang-it|Brigate Nere}}) was one of the [[Italian Fascism|Fascist]] [[paramilitary]] groups, organized and run by the [[Republican Fascist Party]] (''Partito Fascista Repubblicano'', PFR) operating in the [[Italian Social Republic]] (in [[northern Italy]]), during the final years of [[World War II]], and after the signing of the [[Italian Armistice]] in 1943. They were officially led by [[Alessandro Pavolini]], former Minister of Culture (MINCULPOP) of the fascist era during the last years of the [[Kingdom of Italy]].

==History==

===Background===
On 26 July 1943 Italian dictator, [[Benito Mussolini]], was arrested after the Italian [[Grand Council of Fascism]] (''Gran Consiglio del Fascismo''), with the support of King [[Victor Emmanuel III|Vittorio Emanuele III]], overthrew him and began negotiations with the Allies for Italy's withdrawal from the war. The Italian government was taken over by Marshal [[Pietro Badoglio]], who outlawed the [[National Fascist Party]] (''Partito Nazionale Fascista'', PNF) and confiscated all of its assets.

On 12 September Mussolini was rescued in the [[Gran Sasso raid]] by German [[Luftwaffe#Luftwaffe_ground_forces|Luftwaffe]] [[Fallschirmjäger]] (paratroopers) led by General [[Kurt Student]] and the [[Waffen-SS]] ''[[Obersturmbannführer]]'' (Lieutenant Colonel), [[Otto Skorzeny]]. He was then installed by the Germans as the President of the [[Italian Social Republic]] (RSI). The RSI was to be an Italian regime which was to nominally administer the German-occupied northern Italy.

As the ''Milizia Volontaria per la Sicurezza Nazionale'' (MVSN, also known as "[[Blackshirts]]", ''Camicie Nere'') had been disbanded in August by the terms of the armistice, the ''[[Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana]]'' was formed on 24 November 1943, and was to constitute the new fascist police force. The ''Guardia Nazionale Repubblicana'' was formed out of local police, ex-army, ex-Blackshirts and others still loyal to the [[Italian Fascism|fascist]] cause.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pansa, Il Gladio e l'Alloro - l'esercito di Salò, ed. Le Scie- Milano 1991&lt;/ref&gt; 
Anti-fascist political forces in northern Italy, on their side, decided to oppose in arms against the RSI and the German occupants, and began to recruit armed clandestine formations for guerrilla and urban warfare, with support from the Allies. Soon, a bloody civil war started in northern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;I. Montanelli - R. Gervaso, Storia d'Italia 1943-46, ed. Mondadori, Milano 1967&lt;/ref&gt;

===Constitution===
However, as soon as the fascist party in the RSI was reopened and reorganized as [[Republican Fascist Party]] (''Partito Fascista Repubblicano'' - PFR), its members began to organize "private" armed units, to protect themselves and party officials from attacks by Italian resistance fighters, who actually started very soon to target RSI authorities and supporters. RSI manpower proved to be insufficient, and Italian authorities decided to organize all fascist party volunteer units in a dedicated structure, and to raise new forces.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pansa, Il Gladio e l'Alloro - l'esercito di Salò, ed. Le Scie- Milano 1991&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;I. Montanelli - R. Gervaso, Storia d'Italia 1943-46, ed. Mondadori, Milano 1967&lt;/ref&gt; 
The Black Brigades were formed from members of the Republican Fascist Party. Formation of the Black Brigades was sanctioned by a Fascist Republican Party decree issued personally by Benito Mussolini, head of PFR and of the RSI government, dated 30 June 1944, stating that all existing fascist armed units were to be enlisted into a military organization called ''Corpo Ausiliario delle Squadre d'Azione di Camicie Nere'', and that every local Federation of the PFR (there was one in every Italian province) had to raise a military unit drafting personnel from its members. Units so formed were to be called "Black Brigades", and were to be commanded by the local Federal Secretary of the PFR, with the rank of Major or Colonel.&lt;ref&gt;Giampaolo Pansa, ''Il gladio e l'alloro - l'esercito di Salò, 1943-45&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Brigata Nera alpina 1945.jpg|thumb|Mussolini reviews 5th Alpine Mobile Black Brigade "''E. Quagliata''", [[Brescia]], 1945. Note the ''[[Alpini]]'' hat and the green flashes on the soldiers' black collar tabs, both distinctive insignias of Italian mountain troops.]]
Their duties were:
* to provide security for the members and assets of the PFR;
* to cooperate with German and Italian law enforcement authorities;
* to help military authorities in counter-insurgency operations.&lt;ref&gt;Giampaolo Pansa, ''Il gladio e l'alloro - l'esercito di Salò, 1943-45&lt;/ref&gt;

This measure was to be both a response to resistance attacks against fascist members, and to turn the PFR into a fighting force to cope with shortage of manpower for internal security.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pisanò, gli ultimi in grigioverde, vol. I-II-II&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Mussolini and other fascist leaders felt that the Fascist Party was more true to its ideology if brought back to its original spirit, when it was manned mainly by soldiers and veterans and was above all a fighting organization. In this optic, they decided to mobilize it for war duties, under the concept that every fascist was to be first of all a combatant, and had to take arms for the defense of Italy and fascism.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pisanò, gli ultimi in grigioverde, vol. I-II-II&lt;/ref&gt;
Black Brigades membership was compulsory for all members of the PFR deemed fit for such duties. Members were officially called ''Squadristi'' (Squad-men) (like the very first fascist Black Shirts of 1920s), and were divided into three categories: ''Squadristi Permanenti'' (Full-time squad-men), ''Ausiliari di pronto impiego'' (Ready Response Auxiliaries), ''Ausiliari'' (Auxiliaries). Only full-time personnel were required to be on duty daily, while other two categories were to be mobilized only in case of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pisanò, gli ultimi in grigioverde, vol. I-II-II&lt;/ref&gt;
Black Brigade members were entitled to police powers, to carry firearms and to circulate freely even during curfew. Full-time personnel received a monthly wage of ITL 200.00&lt;ref&gt;G. Rosignoli, RSI - uniformi, equipaggiamenti ed armi&lt;/ref&gt;

===Operational service===
Police effectiveness of Black Brigades was, in best terms, feeble. Aside from particularly strong and well equipped Brigades (such as VIIIth "Aldo Resega" of Milan, 2000 strong) that were exceptions, the average Black Brigades were at most 2-300 men strong, poorly equipped and armed, with little if any military training, and were hardly in conditions to defend themselves from partisan attacks, not to mention provide support to military authorities.&lt;ref&gt;G. Rosignoli, RSI - uniformi, equipaggiamenti ed armi&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Brigata nera mantova.jpg|thumbnail|The Black Brigade "''Marcello Turchetti''" of Mantova, before one of its last actions in the closing days of war, April 1945]]
Many of their members were obscure figures evicted from police or army, and conspicuous were also the hardline fascists who were pushed by resentment and revenge towards that part of Italian population who, in their eyes, betrayed the Fascist regime. Many were also old "Squadristi" fascists who had served in the '20s, and who were eager to retake a first-place role in the ranks of the Fascist Party. In general terms, poor average discipline made all these individuals difficult to control, and prone to abuses. 
As the military situation worsened, German mistrust towards the [[Repubblica Sociale Italiana|RSI]] military grew, and even Social Republic authorities looked at the Black Brigades with contempt. All these factors contributed to push the Black Brigades into political radicalization and an increasingly hostile behaviour towards the population itself, among which they gained a fearsome reputation of fanatical brutality and summary procedures. 
Apart from a few Black Brigades who had been found reliable enough to be committed in regular combat against Partisans and Allies, most of these formations had poor military or even police capabilities and were mainly employed in static guard duties, patrols, and were often unleashed in brutal reprisals and retaliations against Partisans' attacks and ambushes to RSI military personnel.&lt;ref&gt;I. Montanelli - R. Gervaso, Storia d'Italia 1943-46, ed. Mondadori, Milano 1967&lt;/ref&gt; There, they usually performed well enough, displaying undeniable bravery but also brutality (which the Partisans promptly reciprocated), in the merciless guerrilla warfare that ravaged northern Italy in 1944-45. Therefore, they were an important law enforcement instrument for German and Italian authorities.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pansa, Il gladio e l'alloro - l'esercito di Salò&lt;/ref&gt;

The Brigade members not only fought the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] and the Italian [[Italian resistance movement|partisans]], but they also fought against political opponents and other Black Brigade members whose support of "the cause" was deemed less than exuberant. Many Black Brigade members were killed in this type of in-fighting.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}

After the armistice (April 25th, 1945) and the end of the war in Italy, many members of the Black Brigades suffered harsh reprisals from Partisan forces. To this day, the number of Black Brigades soldiers who fell victim of summary executions remains unknown.&lt;ref&gt;G. Pansa, ''Il sangue dei vinti''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Pisanò, ''Gli ultimi in grigioverde''&lt;/ref&gt;

===War crimes===
The Black Brigades were frequently involved in support of German units during anti-partisan operations which resulted in massacres of the Italian civilian population, like at the [[Vinca massacre]] where 162 civilians were executed where the 40. Brigata nera “Vittorio Ricciarelli” di Livorno was invovled.&lt;ref name= "Vinca" &gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straginazifasciste.it/?page_id=38&amp;id_strage=4857&amp;lang=en |title=VINCA FIVIZZANO 24-27.08.1944 |publisher=Atlas of Nazi and Fascist Massacres in Italy |date= |website= |access-date=25 August 2018 |language=Italian |trans-title=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uniforms==
Members of Black Brigades were issued standard Italian army uniforms, and they tended to wear them with a black [[turtleneck]] sweater, or (in summer) the famous black shirt, as the symbol of loyalty to Mussolini and membership of the Republican Fascist Party. They sometimes wore this uniform with a windproof jacket in solid or camouflage colors. Members of Black Brigades tended to wear the grey-green uniform pants, but a wide array of uniforms were issued and, especially in closing stages of the war, Black Brigades members used just anything they could obtain: army camouflaged one-piece suits, smocks and pants, paratroopers' collarless jump jackets (very popular), tropical Italian army uniforms, German pants and ''feldjacken'', and frequently local produced uniforms and gear.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Rosignoli, ''RSI - Uniformi, equipaggiamento e armi'' - Ed. Albertelli, Parma 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, armed with a British [[Sten]] MkII, submachine gun, likely from an intercepted British, small arms, airdrop or took in battle.]]

[[File:Black Brigades Helmet.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Black Brigades [[Italian Army]]-issued, black, "Marcello", [[M33 helmet|M33]], steel, helmet, with white skull markings]]

The badge or insignia of the Black Brigades was the jawless [[Totenkopf|death's head]], with a dagger in its teeth, or one of assorted Italian versions. Collar tabs were issued, unique to the Black Brigades, consisting in square-shaped tabs with pointed tip, of solid black cloth, on which was pinned a bright red republican fascio, in the lower part. In the upper part, every Brigade chose its own insignia: either one of the many variants of skulls (with or without crossbones) or coloured facing. Regulations prescribed for all members of the Black Brigades to wear a metal enamelled breast badge, of roundel shape, showing a golden fascio amidst Italian national colours in vertical stripes, and surrounded by a black enamel rim with the inscription: "Corpo Ausiliario delle Squadre d'Azione di Camicie Nere", in capital letters, and in the lower part the identification number of the Brigade. Contemporary pictures show that this badge however, although certainly issued on large scale, was not so often worn.

Many Black Brigades adopted sleeve badges, following Italian military tradition, both cloth and metal. These were usually of very fine workmanship, often minted and enamelled, and are today high-priced collectors items. Rank insignias were the same of those prescribed for the Italian army; however, were rarely worn. Towards the end of the war a specific rank system was introduced for the Black Brigades, unique to them, but it does not seem to have ever been implemented.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Rosignoli, ''RSI - Uniformi, equipaggiamento e armi'' - Ed. Albertelli, Parma 1991&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The majority of Black Brigade members wore Italian army ski caps or berets dyed black. Some photos show members also wearing black German-style caps. Some were Italian made, some were supplied by Germany. Combat headgear was the ubiquitous M33 olive-green helmet, sometimes adorned with Black Brigades' skull insignia. German M35 helmets were also used, ando so were M33 black MVSN helmets. Helmets were often sprayed with various camouflage pattern, as was very common in that period. Combat gear and carrying equipment was the same of army soldiers. ''Samurai'' magazine vest, originally intended for elite army units, was widely used and so were a vast sorting of pouches, magazine-holders, holsters, both official issue (Italian or German) and privately made, carried on Italian M1908 olive-green leather carrying equipment.&lt;ref&gt;Guido Rosignoli, ''RSI - Uniformi, equipaggiamento e armi'' - Ed. Albertelli, Parma 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
The Black Brigades were not actually [[brigade]]-sized units. The Italian word ''brigata'' has a looser meaning as a synonym of "group" or "assembly". The Black Brigades were typically weak [[battalions]] or strong [[Company (military unit)|companies]], each comprising 200 to 300 men. There were 41 territorial brigades. The territorial brigades were numbered 1 through 41. There were also seven "independent" and eight "mobile" brigades. The mobile brigades were numbered 1 through 7, plus the Second [[Arditi]] Brigade.

'''Chindian''' ({{zh|c=中印人|p=Zhōngyìnrén|cy=Jūngyanyàn}}; Hindi: चीनी भारतीय; ISAT: Chini Bhartiya) is an informal term used to refer to a person of mixed [[Indian people|Indian]] and [[Chinese people|Chinese]] ancestry; i.e. from any of the host of ethnic groups native to modern [[Ethnic groups in China|China]] and [[Ethnic groups in India|India]]. There are a considerable number of Chindians in [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], where people of Chinese and Indian origin immigrated in large numbers during the 19th and 20th centuries.&lt;ref name=Narayanan/&gt; There are also a sizeable number living in [[Hong Kong]] and smaller numbers in other countries with large [[overseas Chinese]] and [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]], such as [[Jamaica]], [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Suriname]] and [[Guyana]] in the [[Caribbean]], as well as in [[Indonesia]], the [[Philippines]], the [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[United Kingdom]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].

==Countries==

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the majority of interracial marriages occur between Chinese and Indians. The [[government of Singapore]] classifies them as their father's ethnicity. According to government statistics, 2.4% of Singapore's population are [[multiracial]], mostly Chindians. The highest number of interethnic marriages was in 2007, when 16.4% of the 20,000 marriages in Singapore were interethnic, again mostly between Chinese and Indians.&lt;ref name=Narayanan&gt;{{cite web |author=Sheela Narayanan |date=17 October 2008 |title=Go ahead, call me Chindian |publisher=[[AsiaOne]] |url=http://www.asiaone.com/Just%2BWoman/News/High%2BLife/Story/A1Story20081017-94498.html |accessdate=8 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090821122928/http://www.asiaone.com/Just%2BWoman/News/High%2BLife/Story/A1Story20081017-94498.html |archivedate=21 August 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singapore only began to allow mixed-race persons to register two racial classification on their [[identity cards]] in 2010. Parents may choose which of the two is listed first.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=ChannelNewsAsia|url=http://www.channelnewsasia.com/stories/singaporelocalnews/view/1030142/1/.html|title=Singaporeans of mixed race allowed to "double barrel" race in IC|last=Hoe|first=Yeen Nie|date=12 January 2010|accessdate=10 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than two races may not be listed even if the person has several different ethnicities in their ancestry. Like in Malaysia, most Chindians in Singapore are offspring of interracial relationships between Indian males and Chinese females.&lt;ref name="daniels"/&gt;

===Malaysia===
In Malaysia, the majority of [[interracial marriage]]s occur between Chinese and Indians. The offspring of such marriages are informally known as "Chindian". The [[Malaysian government]], however, considers them to be an unclassified ethnicity, using the father's ethnicity as the informal term.  As the majority of these intermarriages usually involve an Indian male and Chinese female, the majority of Chindian offspring in Malaysia are usually classified as "[[Malaysian Indian]]" by the Malaysian government.&lt;ref name="daniels"&gt;{{citation |last=Daniels |first=Timothy P. |year=2005 |title=Building Cultural Nationalism in Malaysia |publisher=[[Routledge]] |isbn=0-415-94971-8 |page=189}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hong Kong===
[[South Asians in Hong Kong|Indians have been living in Hong Kong]] long before the [[partition of India]] into the nations of [[India]] and [[Pakistan]]. They migrated to [[Hong Kong]] as traders, police officers and army officers during colonial rule.

25,000 of the [[Islam in Hong Kong|Muslims in Hong Kong]] trace their roots back to what is now Pakistan. Around half of them belong to 'local boy' families, Muslims of mixed Chinese ([[Tanka people|Tanka]]) and Indian/Pakistani ancestry, descended from early Indian/Pakistani male immigrants who took local Chinese wives and brought their children up as Muslims.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|doi=10.1017/S0026749X00013895|last=Weiss|first=Anita M.|title=South Asian Muslims in Hong Kong: Creation of a 'Local Boy' Identity|journal=Modern Asian Studies|volume=25|issue=3|date=July 1991|pages=417–53|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Diaspora Entrepreneurial Networks: Four Centuries of History|last=Ina Baghdiantz McCabe|first=Gelina Harlaftis, Iōanna Pepelasē Minoglou|publisher=[[Berg Publishers]]|year=2005|isbn=1-85973-880-X|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; These "local Indians" were not completely accepted by either the Chinese or Indian communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Encyclopedia of Diasporas: Immigrant and Refugee Cultures Around the World|last=Carol R.

===British India===
Some Chinese convicts deported from the [[Straits Settlements]] were sent to be jailed in [[Madras]] in India. The "Madras district gazetteers, Volume 1" reported an incident where the Chinese convicts escaped and killed the police sent to apprehend them: "Much of the building work was done by Chinese convicts sent to the Madras jails from the Straits Settlements (where there was no sufficient prison accommodation) and more than once these people escaped from the temporary buildings' in which they were confined at Lovedale. In 186^ seven of them got away and it was several days before they were apprehended by the Tahsildar, aided by Badagas sent out in all directions to search.

In 1884 the benefits of the Lawrence Asylum were extended by the admission to it of the orphan children of Volunteers who had served in the Presidency for seven years and upwards, it being however expressly provided that children of British soldiers were not to be superseded or excluded by this concession. In 1899 the standard of instruction in the Asylum was raised to the upper secondary grade. In 1901 the rules of the institution, which had been twice altered since 1864 to meet the changes which had occurred, were again revised and considerably modified. They are printed in full in the annual reports. In 1903 owing to the South Indian Railway requiring for its new terminus at Egmore the buildings then occupied by the Civil Orphan Asylums of Madras, Government suggested that these should be moved to the premises on the Poonamallee Road in which the Military Female Orphan Asylum was established and that the girls in the latter, who numbered about 100, should be transferred to the Lawrsnce Asylum.

The mother was a typical Tamil Pariah of dusky hue. The colour of the children was more closely allied to the yellowish tint of the father than to the dark tint of the mother; and the semimongol parentage was betrayed in the slant eyes, flat nose, and (in one case) conspicuously prominent cheek-bones. To have recorded the entire series of measurements of the children would have been useless for the purpose of comparison with those of the parents, and I selected from my repertoire the length and breadth of the head and nose, which plainly indicate the paternal influence on the external anatomy of the offspring. The figures given in the table bring out very clearly the great breadth, as compared with the length of the heads of all the children, and the resultant high cephalic index. In other words, in one case a mesaticephalic (79), and, in the remaining three cases, a sub-brachycephalic head (80"1; 801 ; 82-4) has resulted from the union of a mesaticephalic Chinaman (78-5) with a sub-dolichocephalic Tamil Pariah (76"8). How great is the breadth of the head in the children may be emphasised by noting that the average head-breadth of the adult Tamil Pariah man is only 13"7 cm., whereas that of the three boys, aged ten, nine, and five only, was 14 3, 14, and 13"7 cm. respectively. Quite as strongly marked is the effect of paternal influence on the character of the nose; the nasal index, in the case of each child (68"1 ; 717; 727; 68'3), bearing a much closer relation to that of the long nosed father (71'7) than to the typical Pariah nasal index of the broadnosed mother (78-7). It will be interesting to note, hereafter, what is the future of the younger members of this quaint little colony, and to observe the physical characters, temperament, improvement or deterioration, fecundity, and other points relating to the cross-breed resulting from the union of Chinese and Tamil.|location=MADRAS|title=Bulletin ..., Volumes 2-3|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DvgSAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=32|edition=|pages=|year=2004|accessdate=2 March 2012|publisher=Asian Educational Services|volume=Volume 2, Issue 1 of Bulletin (Government Museum (Madras, India))|author=Edgar Thurston|quote=|location=|title=Badagas and Irulas of Nilgiris, Paniyans of Malabar: A Cheruman Skull, Kuruba Or Kurumba - Summary of Results|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ca6wmDzhMDoC&amp;pg=PA32#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|isbn=81-206-1857-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=99|edition=illustrated|pages=|year=1987|accessdate=2 March 2012|publisher=Asian Educational Services|volume=|author1=Edgar Thurston |author2=K.

According to Alabaster there were lard manufacturers and shoemakers in addition to carpenters. Running tanneries and working with [[leather]] was traditionally not considered a respectable profession among [[caste system|upper-caste]] [[Hindus]], and work was relegated to lower caste ''muchis'' and ''[[chamar]]s''. There was a high demand, however, for high quality leather goods in [[British Raj|colonial India]], one that the Chinese were able to fulfill. Alabaster also mentions licensed [[opium den]]s run by native Chinese and a ''Cheena Bazaar'' where contraband was readily available. Opium, however, was not illegal until after India's Independence from Great Britain in 1947. Immigration continued unabated through the turn of the century and during [[World War I]] partly due to political upheavals in China such as the [[First Opium War|First]] and [[Second Opium War]]s, [[First Sino-Japanese War]] and the [[Boxer Rebellion]]. Around the time of the First World War, the first Chinese-owned tanneries sprang up.&lt;ref name="Banglapedia"&gt;{{cite book |last=Haraprasad |first=Ray |year=2012 |chapter=Chinese, The |chapter-url=http://en.banglapedia.org/index.php?title=Chinese,_The |editor1-last=Islam |editor1-first=Sirajul |editor1-link=Sirajul Islam |editor2-last=Jamal |editor2-first=Ahmed A. |title=Banglapedia: National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh |edition=Second |publisher=[[Asiatic Society of Bangladesh]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trinidad===
In [[Trinidad]], some [[Chinese Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Chinese men]] had relationships with [[Indo-Trinidadian and Tobagonian|Indian coolie women]] of [[Madras|Madrasee origin]], siring children with them, and it was reported that "A few children are to be met with born of Madras and Creole parents and some also of Madras and Chinese parents - the Madrasee being the mother", by the missionary John Morton in 1876, Morton noted that it seemed strange since there were more Indian coolie men than Indian coolie women that Indian coolie women would marry Chinese men, but claimed it was most likely because the Chinese could provide amenities to the women since the Chinese owned shops and they were enticed by these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=14|pages=|year=2014|accessdate=1 June 2015|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|volume=|issn=|edition=|author=|editors=Julitta Rydlewska, Barbara Braid|others=|quote=|location=|title=Unity in Diversity, Volume 1: Cultural Paradigm and Personal Identity, Volume 1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WBVQBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14&amp;dq=some+also+of+madras+and+chinese+parents+the+madrasee+being+the+mother&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Y1KTVYG2MYr2yQT0ypKQBw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=some%20also%20of%20madras%20and%20chinese%20parents%20the%20madrasee%20being%20the%20mother&amp;f=false|archiveurl=http://www.cambridgescholars.com/download/sample/61376|archivedate=2014|isbn=1443867292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=238|pages=|year=1995|accessdate=1 June 2015|publisher=Nycan|volume=|issn=|edition=|author=Dennison Moore|editors=|others=|quote=|location=|title=Origins and Development of Racial Ideology in Trinidad |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=pRKTVZGPJoG--AGOr6Zo&amp;id=kTV7AAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=some+also+of+madras+and+chinese+parents+the+madrasee+being+the+mother&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=being+mother|isbn=0968006000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=263|pages=|year=1999|accessdate=1 June 2015|publisher=Sir Arthur Lewis Institute of Social and Economic Studies, The University of the West Indies|volume=|issn=|edition=|author=Selwyn D.

In a [[parliamentary system|parliamentary democracy]] based on the [[Westminster system]], '''confidence and supply''' are required for a [[minority government]] to retain power in the [[lower house]].

A '''confidence-and-supply agreement''' is one whereby a party or independent members of parliament will support the government in [[motion of no confidence|motions of confidence]] and [[appropriation bill|appropriation or budget (supply) votes]], by either voting in favour or abstaining. However, parties and independent members normally retain the right to otherwise vote in favour of their own policies or on [[Conscience vote|conscience]] on [[bill (law)|legislative bills]].&lt;ref&gt;James Cook, [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/scotland/8668008.stm Governments, coalitions and border politics], ''[[BBC News]]'', 7 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/why-the-pm-is-safe-in-no-10-for-the-moment-1968190.html Why the PM is safe in No 10 for the moment], ''[[The Independent]]'', 8 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/sites/default/files/publications/IfG%20Insight%20Confidence%20and%20Supply%20final.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[coalition government]] is a more formal arrangement than a confidence-and-supply agreement, in that members from junior parties (i.e. parties other than the largest) gain positions in the [[Cabinet (government)|cabinet]], [[Minister (government)|ministerial roles]] and may be expected to hold the government [[Whip (politics)|whip]] on passing legislation.

==Confidence==
{{Main article|Motion of no confidence}}

In most parliamentary democracies, members of a parliament can propose a motion of confidence&lt;ref&gt;Otherwise, when it is proposed by the Government itself upon a piece of legislation, "the Chambers are enslaved in the exercise of their principal function just because it was thought that their being master of the fiduciary relationship were to be reaffirmed on each bill": {{cite journal|last1=Argondizzo|first1=Domenico|last2=Buonomo|first2=Giampiero |title=Spigolature intorno all’attuale bicameralismo e proposte per quello futuro |journal=Mondoperaio.net|date=April 2014| url= https://www.questia.com/projects#!/project/89210301}} {{Subscription required |via=[[Questia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or of no confidence in the government or executive. The results of such motions show how much support the government currently has in parliament. Should a motion of confidence fail, or a motion of no confidence pass, the government will usually either resign and allow other politicians to form a new government, or call an election.

==Supply==
{{Main article|Appropriation bill|Loss of supply}}

Most parliamentary democracies require an annual state budget, an [[appropriation bill]], or occasional financial measures to be passed by parliament in order for a government to pay its way and enact its policies. The failure of a supply bill is in effect the same as the failure of a confidence motion. In early modern England, the withholding of funds was one of [[Parliament of England|Parliament]]'s few ways of controlling the [[list of English monarchs|monarch]].

==Examples of confidence-and-supply deals==

===Australia===
{{Main article|Gillard Government#Minority government}}
The [[Australian Labor Party]] [[Gillard Government]] formed a [[minority government]] in the [[hung parliament]] elected at the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 federal election]] resulting from a confidence-and-supply agreement with three [[Independent politicians in Australia|independent]] MPs and one [[Australian Greens|Green]] MP.&lt;ref name="Rodgers"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/09/07/3005028.htm |title=Labor clings to power |first=Emma |last=Rodgers |date=7 September 2010 |publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation |work=ABC News Online }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
====British Columbia====
After the [[British Columbia general election, 2017|2017 British Columbia provincial election]], the [[Green Party of British Columbia]] agreed to a confidence-and-supply agreement with the [[British Columbia New Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timescolonist.com/news/local/lieutenant-governor-invites-horgan-to-take-over-rejects-another-election-1.20839483|title=Lieutenant-governor invites Horgan to take over, rejects another election |last=Kines|first=Lindsay|date=29 June 2017|work=[[Times Colonist]]|accessdate=1 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The incumbent [[British Columbia Liberal Party]] briefly tried to form a government, but was immediately defeated in a confidence vote by the NDP and Greens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Keller |first1=James |last2=Hunter |first2=Justine |last3=Hager |first3=Mike |title=B.C.

====New Brunswick====
On November 2, the [[Legislative Assembly of New Brunswick|legislative assembly]] voted 25-23 for a motion, introduced by the [[Progressive Conservative Party of New Brunswick|Progressive Conservatives]], to amended the throne speech to declare no confidence in the government. Subsequently, [[Brian Gallant|Gallant]] indicated his intention to resign the premiership and recommend to the lieutenant governor that [[Blaine Higgs|Higgs]] be given the mandate to form government: “I will go see the lieutenant governor at her earliest convenience to inform her that I will be resigning as premier, and I will humbly suggest to her honour to allow the leader of the Conservative Party to attempt to form a government and attempt to gain the confidence of the house.” [[People's Alliance of New Brunswick|People’s Alliance]] leader [[Kris Austin]] said he would work with the new government “in the areas we agree on,” and reiterated his promise to support the Progressive Conservatives on confidence votes for a period of 18 months. [[Green Party of New Brunswick|Green Party]] leader [[David Coon]] said he would start working with the Tories in an attempt to ensure his party’s issues were on the government’s agenda.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/new-brunswick/new-brunswick-confidence-vote-liberals-gallant-1.4888347 Brian Gallant's minority government defeated after losing confidence vote]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ontario====
Twenty-two days after the [[Ontario general election, 1985|1985 Ontario provincial election]], the [[Progressive Conservative Party of Ontario]] government resigned after a [[vote of no confidence]], and the [[Ontario Liberal Party]] formed a government with the support of the [[Ontario New Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://link.galegroup.com/apps/doc/A165614744/ITBC |title=NDP, Liberals move non-confidence |last=Stephens |first=Robert |date=8 June 1985 |work=The Globe and Mail |issn=03190714}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agreement between the two parties was referred to as "The Accord".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/435524082 |title=Minority is working |last=Peterson |first=David |date=20 December 1986 |work=The Toronto Star |issn=03190781}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
[[Third Front (India)|Third Front]] national governments were formed in [[Indian general election, 1989|1989]] and [[Indian general election, 1996|1996]] with outside support of one of the two major parties, [[Bharatiya Janata Party|BJP]] or [[Indian National Congress|Congress]].

The [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPI-M]] gave outside support to the Congress Party from 2004-2008, but later withdrew support after the [[India–United States Civil Nuclear Agreement]].
===Ireland===
After the [[Irish general election, 2016|2016 general election]], [[Government of the 32nd Dáil|a minority government]] was formed by [[Fine Gael]] and some independents, with confidence-and-supply ({{lang-ga|muinín agus soláthar}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://comhar.ie/iris/77/8/muinin-agus-solathar/|title=Muinín agus soláthar?|author=|date=|website=comhar.ie}}&lt;/ref&gt;) support from [[Fianna Fáil]] in return for a published set of policy commitments from the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fiannafail.ie/confidence-and-supply-arrangement/|title=Confidence and Supply Arrangement|year=2016|publisher=Fianna Fáil|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fianna Fáil abstains on confidence and supply votes, but reserves the right to vote for or against any bill proposed in the [[Dáil]] or Seanad. The deal was to last until the end of 2018, with the possibility of renewal before then to extend it to the five-year maximum term of a Dáil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newstalk.com/election2016/Fine-Gael-Fianna-Fail-deal-parliamentary-parties-Independents|title=Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil parliamentary parties unanimously adopt Government deal |last=Gallagher|first=Páraic|date=3 May 2016|work=[[Newstalk]]|accessdate=3 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, confidence and supply arrangements are common due to the [[mixed-member proportional|MMP]] system used in the country. The parties providing confidence and supply have a more prominent role than in other countries, with MPs from the support parties often being appointed to [[Ministers of the New Zealand Government|ministerial portfolios]] outside of Cabinet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.newshub.co.nz/home/election/2017/10/what-is-confidence-and-supply-and-how-does-it-differ-from-a-coalition.html|title=What is confidence and supply… and how does it differ from a coalition?|date=2017-04-10|work=Newshub|access-date=2017-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; New Zealand codified the procedures it used to form these Governments in its Cabinet Manual.&lt;ref name="dpmc nz"&gt;{{cite web |title=CO (17) 10: Labour-New Zealand First Coalition, with Confidence and Supply from the Green Party: Consultation and Operating Arrangements |url=https://dpmc.govt.nz/publications/co-17-10-labour-new-zealand-first-coalition-confidence-and-supply-green-party |publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet |accessdate=25 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Key]]'s [[New Zealand National Party|National Party]] administration formed a minority government in [[New Zealand general election, 2008|2008]] thanks to a confidence-and-supply agreement with the [[ACT New Zealand|ACT]], [[United Future]] and the [[Māori Party]].&lt;ref name=bryant&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bryant |first1=Nick |title=Lessons from New Zealand in art of coalition building |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/election_2010/8665835.stm |work=[[BBC News]] |date=7 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A similar arrangement in [[New Zealand general election, 2005|2005]] had led to [[Helen Clark]]'s [[New Zealand Labour Party|Labour Party]] forming a coalition government with the [[Jim Anderton's Progressive Party|Progressive Party]], with support on confidence and supply from [[New Zealand First]] and [[United Future]]. After the [[New Zealand general election, 2014|2014]] election, National re-entered confidence-and-supply agreements with United Future, the ACT Party, and the Māori Party. In 2017, despite National winning more votes than Labour in the election, New Zealand First chose to enter coalition with Labour to help them change the government, with support on confidence and supply from the left-wing [[Green Party of Aotearoa New Zealand|Green Party]].&lt;ref name="dpmc nz"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Between 1977 and 1978, [[Jim Callaghan|Jim Callaghan's]] [[British Labour Party|Labour Party]] stayed in power thanks to a confidence-and-supply agreement with the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]], in a deal which became known as the [[Lib-Lab Pact]]. In return, the Labour Party agreed to modest policy concessions for the Liberal Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/mar/16/politics-what-is-confidence-and-supply |title=Politics: what is confidence and supply? |first=Matthew |last=Weaver |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=16 March 2015 |accessdate=22 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Election 2017: DUP agrees 'confidence' deal with Tories|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/election-2017-40236152|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[United Kingdom general election, 2017|2017 general election]] which left [[Theresa May]]'s [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] without a majority, a [[Conservative–DUP agreement|confidence-and-supply agreement]] has been agreed with the [[Democratic Unionist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peck|first1=Tom|title=Theresa May to enter into 'confidence and supply' arrangement with the Democratic Unionists|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/theresa-may-conservative-dup-confidence-and-supply-coalition-formal-cabinet-positions-northern-irish-a7783741.html|accessdate=10 June 2017|work=The Independent|date=10 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
====Devolved government====
Confidence and supply deals are more frequent in the devolved legislatures of Scotland and Wales due to the use of [[proportional representation]].

[[Scottish Parliament]]: The [[Scottish National Party]] and [[Scottish Green Party]] have a confidence and supply deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-scotland-scotland-politics-38828873|title=Scots budget vote passed after Green deal|author=|date=2 February 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Welsh Assembly]]:
The [[Welsh Labour Party]] and [[Plaid Cymru]] had a similar co-operation deal until October 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-wales-politics-41526435|title=Plaid to end Labour co-operation deal|author=|date=6 October 2017|publisher=|via=www.bbc.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name "Cornelius" is a French-language [[pun]], as the French word for "horn" is ''corne''.

==Political candidature==
Cornelius was the nominal leader of the [[List of federal political parties in Canada|federal political party]], the [[Rhinoceros Party of Canada (1963–1993)|Rhinoceros Party of Canada]] from 1965 to 1993. The party attracted a considerable number of votes in Canadian elections [[Canadian federal election, 1979|1979]], [[Canadian federal election, 1980|1980]] and [[Canadian federal election, 1984|1984]], sometimes even coming in second place in some [[electoral district (Canada)|riding]]s, but never elected a candidate to the [[House of Commons of Canada]].

The Party was inspired by [[Non-human electoral candidates|Cacareco]], a rhinoceros at the [[São Paulo]] zoo in Brazil, which was a candidate for the 1958 city council elections with the intention of protesting against political corruption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memoriaviva.com.br/ocruzeiro/24101959/241059_8.htm Cacareco]&lt;/ref&gt; Electoral officials did not accept Cacareco's candidacy, but he eventually won 100,000 votes, more than any other party in that same election (which was also marked by rampant [[absenteeism]]). Today, the term "Voto Cacareco" (Cacareco vote) is commonly used to describe protest votes in Brazil.

During the [[Canadian federal election, 1984|Canadian federal election of 1984]], the party made a major part of their platform declaring war on [[Belgium]] because a Belgian cartoon character, ''[[The Adventures of Tintin|Tintin]]'', killed a rhinoceros in one of the early works of the comics series.&lt;ref name="FORCES"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.forces.org/canada/news-archive/092003.htm |title=Dateline-Montreal Grand Prix update |publisher=[[Forces Canada]] |date=September 5, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625142517/http://www.forces.org/canada/news-archive/092003.htm |archivedate=2007-06-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The party offered to call off the threatened Belgium-Canada war if Belgium delivered a case of [[mussels]] and a case of Belgian beer to Rhinoceros "Hindquarters" in Montreal (the Belgian Embassy in Ottawa ''did'', in fact, do this).&lt;ref name = "FORCES" /&gt;

==United States==
The Granby Zoo eventually traded Cornelius to the [[San Diego Zoo]] in exchange for a [[giraffe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/after-years-of-near-extinction-the-whacky-rhino-party-is-back/article18142763/|title = After years of near-extinction, the whacky Rhino party is back|author = Ingrid Peritz|publisher = The Globe and Mail|date = August 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The San Diego Zoo loaned him to the [[Caldwell Zoo]], where he fathered an offspring on January 6, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.aza.org/Publications/2003/04/April2003SigEffortsCons.pdf|title = Black Rhino Born at Caldwell Zoo|journal = Significant Efforts in Conservation|date = April 2003|publisher = Association of Zoos and Aquariums|format = PDF|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070221141808/http://www.aza.org/Publications/2003/04/April2003SigEffortsCons.pdf|archivedate = 2007-02-21|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
Cornelius died on April 3, 2013, at the Caldwell Zoo.  A news report indicated he "was suffering from pneumonia and [[mycobacterium tuberculosis complex]] was present in his lungs".&lt;ref name = "KLTV" /&gt;

A '''corner office''' is an [[office]] that is located in the corner of a building. Corner offices are considered desirable because they have windows on two exterior walls, as opposed to a typical office with only one window or none at all (windowless offices occupying a corner of a building are therefore not typically considered “corner offices”). 

As corner offices are often given to the most senior executives, the term primarily refers to [[Corporate_title#Senior_management|top management positions or the "C-Suite"]], such as the [[chief executive officer]] (CEO),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Office setup and construction|url=http://www.officefitoutquote.com.au/about-office-fitout-quotes/|publisher=Office Quotes|accessdate=10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[chief operating officer]] (COO), or [[chief financial officer]] (CFO). In organizations which do not use this corporate hierarchy, such as law firms and political parties, the corner office generally refers to the most senior partners or officials who are involved with [[corporate governance]].

==Uses==

'''Clarence Edward Crowther''' (known as Edward; born 4 March 1929) was the sixth [[Anglican]] [[Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman]] who on appointment was its youngest bishop.&lt;ref name="ref1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,835007,00.html|title=Anglicans: Angry Young Bishop|accessdate=2013-09-16 | work=Time|date=14 January 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Bradford]] on 4 March 1929 he was educated at the [[University of Leeds]], where he obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in 1950, [[Bachelor of Laws|LLB]] in 1952, and [[Master of Laws|LLM]] in 1953 and at [[Ripon College Cuddesdon|Cuddesdon College]] for one year (1955/56).&lt;ref&gt;''Crockford's Clerical Directory'' (97th edn. London: Church House Publishing, 2001), p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://andromeda.rutgers.edu/~lcrew/bishops/0063.html This website states that his LLB and LLM were awarded by the University of Oxford. This contradicts the information in ''Crockford's Clerical Directory'' and would be impossible anyway as Oxford does not award the degrees of Bachelor or Master of Laws.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Crowther taught criminal and constitutional law at Exeter College, Oxford, in 1952-55. He was ordained [[deacon]] in 1956 and [[priest]] the following year, serving as curate at St. Philip and St. James' Church, Oxford, in 1956-58. After a preaching tour in the [[United States of America|United States]] and a period (1959-64) as a [[University|college]] [[chaplain]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]], he became [[Dean (religion)|Dean]] of [[St Cyprian's Cathedral, Kimberley|St Cyprian’s Cathedral]], Kimberley in  [[South Africa]] in September 1964,&lt;ref&gt;"Our Companion Diocese", ''The Bishop's Newsletter'', Vol. XXV, No. 6 (November 21, 1965), p. 4. This newsletter was published by the [[Episcopal Diocese of Western Michigan]], which at the time was a companion diocese of the Diocese of Kimberley and Kuruman. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://stcyprians.itgo.com/ Cathedral History web site]&lt;/ref&gt; and then its [[Bishop of Kimberley and Kuruman|Diocesan Bishop]] in 1965. Crowther was consecrated bishop in [[Cape Town]] on November 14, and he was formally enthroned in St. Cyprian's Cathedral on November 29, 1965. Two years later he was expelled from the country for his opposition to [[apartheid]]. In 1970 he returned to [[California]] as Assistant Bishop and obtained a doctorate.

({{IPA-es|el ˈpweβlo uˈniðo xaˈmas seˈɾa βenˈsiðo|am}}; &lt;small&gt;[[English language|English]]&lt;/small&gt;: "The people united will never be defeated") is one of the most internationally renowned songs of the ''[[Nueva canción|Nueva cancion chilena]]'' (New Chilean Song) movement. The music of the song was composed by [[Sergio Ortega]] and the text written by [[Quilapayún]]. The song was composed and recorded in June 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newalbion.com/NA063/ |title=Frederic Rzewski: The People United Will Never Be Defeated! |accessdate=2007-04-13 |publisher=New Albion Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trovadores.net/lmveure.php?NM=4&amp;PC=9 |title=LA NUEVA CANCIÓN CHILENA by José Manuel García |accessdate=2009-05-12 |publisher=Cancioneros.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070205031644/http://www.trovadores.net/lmveure.php?NM=4 |archivedate=2007-02-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The song was initially composed as an anthem for the [[Popular Unity (Chile)|popular unity]] government, reflecting the spirit behind the mass mobilization of working-class people who in 1970 [[Chilean presidential election, 1970|had elected]] [[Salvador Allende]] for the [[socialist]] transformation of Chile. During Allende's campaign ''El pueblo unido jamás será vencido'' was a frequent slogan.&lt;ref&gt;Corvalán, Luis (2003) [https://books.google.com/books?id=3IschSI-zG8C&amp;pg=PA111 El gobierno de Salvador Allende], pp.111-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wessel, Günther (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=bJ2-wUrZn8IC&amp;pg=PA102 ''Los Allende: con ardiente paciencia por un mundo mejor''], pp.102-3&lt;/ref&gt; The song was interpreted and recorded by a number of music groups shortly after it was composed and performed publicly by [[Sergio Ortega]] and [[Quilapayún]]. ''New Chilean Song'' music ensembles such as Vientos del Pueblo, [[Inti-illimani]] among others, made successful recordings of the song that filled the airways and the backgrounds of political rallies. After the U.S.-backed&lt;ref name="PINOCHET: A Declassified Documentary Obit"&gt;{{cite web|title= PINOCHET: A Declassified Documentary Obit |author=Kornbluh, Peter |publisher=gwu.edu |date=2006-12-12 |url=http://www.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB212/index.htm|accessdate=2007-01-06 |authorlink= Peter Kornbluh}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[1973 coup in Chile|September 11, 1973 Chilean coup]] the song became the anthem of the Chilean resistance against the [[Pinochet]] regime, both within Chile and among the community of Chilean [[exile]]s and their political allies abroad.

However, it was especially after [[1973 Chilean coup d'état|Pinochet's September 1973 coup]] that the group [[Inti-Illimani]] (also from Chile) made it famous around the world, after they published the song in the album [[La Nueva Canción Chilena (Inti-Illimani 2)|La Nueva Canción Chilena]].

During the course of time the song has been used in various protests around the world, most of which have no direct connection to the Chilean coup or [[Latin America]].  The lyrics have been adapted or translated into many languages.

== Versions ==
*In a more militant version, the phrase ''El pueblo unido jamás será vencido'' is changed in the last verse to ''El pueblo armado jamás será aplastado'' — "The people armed will never be crushed".&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|MBm2debqePc|Los Miserables - El Pueblo Unido}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Portugal]], especially from 1974 to 1977, pro-democracy, populist, centrist and left-wing groups (especially communists) sang a song called ''Portugal Ressuscitado'' (Resurrected Portugal), written by [[Ary dos Santos]] and sung by [[Fernando Tordo]] and an accompanying chorus. The song was recorded immediately after the [[Carnation Revolution]]&lt;ref&gt;[[:pt:Fernando Tordo|Fernando Tordo - Wikipédia, a enciclopédia livre]]&lt;/ref&gt; with the famous encore ''Agora o Povo Unido nunca mais será vencido'' (Now the People United will never more be defeated).&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|QVKD_cxGlCE|Portugal Ressuscitado - 1977 - 25 Canções de Abril}}&lt;/ref&gt; The song, though, had only very small similarities with the tune of the Chilean song during most of its structure except during the similar encore, and no lyrical similarity besides the spirit of popular struggle and the similar catchphrase/slogan. The song and the slogan are still quite popular and part of Portuguese collective memory.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogportugalxxi.blogspot.com/2005/08/o-povo-est-desunido-por-isso.html O Povo está desunido, por isso é facilmente vencido...]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://tu-barao.blogs.sapo.pt/49976.html Segunda-feira, 16 de Julho de 2007, Está completamente apanhado!, Tubarão blog]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://recantodasletras.uol.com.br/poesias/1429415 Recanto das Letras, Cenas de Um Sonho], 09/02/2009 06h54 comment&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Iran]], the melody was used for a revolutionary song with [[Persian language|Persian]] lyrics, entitled "''Barpakhiz''" (in [[English language|English]] "Arise"),&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Q-OC1NQpcHc|Barpakhiz_Shabahang.wmv}}&lt;/ref&gt; with encore ''بر پا خیز، از جا کن، بنای کاخ دشمن!'' (Pronounced as ''Barpakhiz, az ja kan, banaye kakh-e doshman'', Meaning: ''Arise, Demolish the Foundations of the Enemy's Palace!'') by the Iranian leftist revolutionaries during [[Islamic Revolution|the Revolution against the monarchy in 1979]]. The song has experienced a revival in popularity with the [[Green Revolution (Iran)|Iranian Green revolution]] as a rally and protest song.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|W9uHxTWt5OY|Bar Pa Khiz بر پا خيز}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the [[Philippines]], the song was loosely translated by the progressive band [[Patatag]] for their song "''Awit ng Tagumpay''" (which translates to "Song of Victory") with its Tagalog encore "''Tibayin ang hanay, Gapiin ang Kaaway!''" (Strengthen the ranks, destroy the oppressors).  It is sung during demonstrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|FJX4yQr8XmQ|Awit ng Tagumpay (Victory Song)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Bagong Alyansang Makabayan]] also used its loosely Tagalog translation of the title as its motto: "''Ang tao, ang bayan, ngayon ay lumalaban!''"
*In 1975 [[Frederic Rzewski]] composed [[The People United Will Never Be Defeated!|36 piano variations]] on this song.
*In 1977, the German folk singer [[Hannes Wader]] released the song "El pueblo unido" on the live album "Hannes Wader singt Arbeiterlieder" recorded at a folk festival organized by the [[German Communist Party|DKP]] newspaper [[Unsere Zeit]].
*In 1979, "[[The People United Will Never Be Defeated!]]" was chanted at the [[White Night riots]] after the sentencing of former [[San Francisco]] supervisor [[Dan White]] in the murders of [[George Moscone]] and [[Harvey Milk]]. White only served 5 years of a 7-year sentence.
* In 1982, the American bassist [[Charlie Haden]] recorded a version with [[Carla Bley]] and the [[Liberation Music Orchestra]] on the album ''Ballad of the Fallen'' which was voted top jazz album of the year in Downbeat's 1984 critics' poll.
* In 1983, during the "Resistance March" (Marcha de la resistencia) in Argentina, the song was revived with the lyrics "Resulta indispensable, aparición con vida y castigo a los culpables" ("It's essential that they return the disappeared, and that the guilty be punished"). The song was still being sung in the 2000s in Argentina with the disappearance of Julio Lopez. 
*In 1995 the Hungarian [[Ska]] group Szabad Idők (Free Times) released the song "El Pueblo Unido" on their album Vivan Los Zapatistas!.  El Pueblo Unido included lyrics inspired by the Chilean song.

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-P047199, Berlin, Schöneberger Sängerknaben.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Schoolchildren pose beneath the Freedom Bell, 1958]]

The '''Freedom Bell''' (in German, ''Freiheitsglocke'') in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]], is a [[bell (instrument)|bell]] that was given as a gift from [[United States|Americans]] to the city of Berlin in 1950 as a symbol of [[anti-communism]], and was inspired by the American [[Liberty Bell]].  Since 1950, the bell has been located in the [[Rathaus Schöneberg]], the former city hall of [[West Berlin]].

==Origins and installation==
The initiative to give Berlin such a bell was taken by the ''Crusade for Freedom'', a propaganda campaign sponsored by the [[National Committee for a Free Europe]], the organization which operated [[Radio Free Europe]]. The campaign was launched by U.S. general [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] on Labor Day, 1950, with General [[Lucius D. Clay]], later known as the "father of the [[Berlin airlift]]", as its chairman. The stated purpose of the Campaign was to offer all Americans an opportunity to play a personal part in a demonstration of the "free world's determination to resist Communist aggression." The bell was conceived by Abbott Washburn and Nate Crabtree and designed by [[Walter Dorwin Teague]].&lt;ref name="Cummings 2010 - Freedom Bell"&gt;{{cite news|last=Cummings|first=Richard H.|title=The Freedom Bell in Berlin (Updated March 2011)|url=http://coldwarradios.blogspot.com/2010/11/freedom-bell-in-berlin-updated-march.html|accessdate=20 September 2012|newspaper=Cold War Radios|date=29 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Medhurst 1997"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Medhurst|first=Martin J.|title=Eisenhower and the Crusade for Freedom: The Rhetorical Origins of a Cold War Campaign|journal=Presidential Studies Quarterly|date=Fall 1997|volume=27|issue=4|pages=646–661|jstor=27551792 .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 10-ton bell arrived from the British [[Bellfounding|bell foundry]] of [[Gillett &amp; Johnston]] to a ticker tape parade in [[New York City]]. It carries the inscription ''That this world under God shall have a new birth of freedom''. The bell subsequently visited 26 American cities, and people in every state were encouraged to sign a "Declaration of Freedom".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sujet.de/sign/doku/freiheitsglocke/s5_e.html 50th Anniversary of the Freedom Bell in Berlin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; 16 million signatures from American citizens were collected and are enshrined in Berlin along with the bell.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.martinmdb.com/peacebells.html The Martins, World Bells of Peace and Freedom&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The bell then traveled to Berlin, and was permanently installed in the [[West Berlin]] city hall on [[United Nations Day]], October 24, 1950.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dradio.de/dlf/sendungen/kalenderblatt/430825/ (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; More than 400,000 Berliners filled the square before the city hall (now [[John-F.-Kennedy-Platz]]) to witness the dedication ceremonies. General Clay gave a speech and pushed the button that started the bell ringing. Its tones were heard throughout East Berlin and into East Germany. The East German [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany]] (SED) launched a demonstration several miles from the dedication site, and party members denounced the ball as a "war bell", a "hunger bell" and a "death bell". SED central committee member [[Hans Jendretzky]] warned: "The rope of the death bell will become the gallows rope for those who ring it."&lt;ref name="Puddington"&gt;Arch Puddington, ''Broadcasting Freedom: The Cold War Triumph of Radio Free Europe and Radio Liberty'', 2003, p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

The Governing Mayor of West Berlin, [[Ernst Reuter]] ([[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]]), declared that Germany "will never rest or relax until freedom will shine over the countries of Eastern Europe that are at present forced to live in slavery".&lt;ref name="Puddington" /&gt;

==Occasions for ringing==
The bell is rung daily at noon, and at midnight on [[Christmas Eve]] and on [[New Year's Eve]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlin.de/ba-tempelhof-schoeneberg/derbezirk/wissenswertes/freiheitsglocke.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080414175707/http://www.berlin.de/ba-tempelhof-schoeneberg/derbezirk/wissenswertes/freiheitsglocke.html |archivedate=2008-04-14 |df= }} (in German)&lt;/ref&gt; A recording of the ringing was broadcast by [[Rundfunk im amerikanischen Sektor|RIAS]], the American radio in West Berlin, every Sunday just before noon. These broadcasts have been continued by the successor of RIAS, [[Deutschlandradio Kultur]]. In the radio broadcasts, the ringing of the bell is followed by an excerpt from the text of the "Declaration of Freedom" in [[German language|German]], read by prominent theatre actors.

The bell has also been rung on several special occasions: the 1953 [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany|Uprising of June 17]], the 1956 [[Hungarian Uprising of 1956|Hungarian Uprising]], the construction of the [[Berlin Wall]] in 1961 and the [[Reunification of Germany]] of 1990. In 2001, the bell was rung on occasion of the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]], and thousands of Berlin citizens paid their respect at [[John-F.-Kennedy-Platz]] in front of the former city hall of West Berlin.

==Leadership==
'''Jonathan Rapping''', president and founder of Gideon's Promise, is a nationally renowned criminal justice innovator and 2014 MacArthur Foundation "Genius" Fellow, who moved from Washington, D.C. to Atlanta, because he found the injustice within our criminal justice system – particularly in the South – to be unacceptable.

In 2007, Rapping founded Gideon's Promise and began an initiative to change the public defense landscape across America by grooming a generation of public defenders – many of whom are often so overwhelmed by crushing caseloads that they are unable to provide their clients the representation the Constitution demands – to rise up and fight against the injustice within our justice system.

In his quest to train and equip public defenders with the resources necessary to ensure all citizens receive their Constitutional right of "equal justice for all," Rapping and his organization have become symbols of a new civil rights movement.

Professor Rapping received a J.D. from the George Washington University School of Law, a M.P.A. from the Woodrow Wilson School at Princeton University, and a B.A. from the University of Chicago. He is currently a Professor at Atlanta's John Marshall Law School.

Jonathan Rapping was honored in 2014 as a MacArthur Fellow for his work with Gideon's Promise.

In the fall of 2014, president and founder [[Jonathan Rapping]] partnered with the state of Maryland in an attempt to improve statewide public defense. [[Jonathan Rapping]] was honored in 2014 as a [[MacArthur Fellows Program|MacArthur Fellow]] for his work with Gideon's Promise.

'''Ilham Askia''' is the co-founder of Gideon's Promise, and  serves as the organization's executive director.

Askia was 5 years old when her father, although he had long since ended a life of crime to become a devout Muslim, was arrested on an armed robbery warrant. He was convicted and served 10 years in prison. Her father was served by a public defender. Whether it was due to lack of training or overwhelming case load, the public defender did not provide the court details of Askia's father's character change – important information that could have possibly led to an outcome other than prison. This is why Askia helped found Gideon's Promise.

Askia received a Masters in Teaching from Trinity University in Washington, D.C. and a B.S. from Cornell University.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7855">The '''impeachment of Václav Klaus''' refers to a failed attempt by members of the [[Senate of the Czech Republic|Czech Senate]] to impeach the [[President of the Czech Republic]], [[Václav Klaus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Czech President Vaclav Klaus faces treason charge |date=March 4, 2013 |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21660234 |publisher=[[BBC News]] |accessdate=October 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case was eventually dismissed by the court on the grounds that his mandate had already expired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Constitutional Court throws out treason charges against ex-president Klaus |author=Rob Cameron |date=March 28, 2013 |url=http://www.radio.cz/en/section/curraffrs/constitutional-court-throws-out-treason-charges-against-ex-president-klaus |publisher=[[Radio Praha]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impeachment process==
The [[President of the Czech Republic]] can only be [[impeach]]ed in the case of an act of [[treason]] (which is not defined in the [[Constitution of the Czech Republic|constitution]] itself). The process must be initiated in the Senate, which has the exclusive power to impeach the president, and then passes to the [[Constitutional Court of the Czech Republic|Constitutional Court]], which determines whether the President is guilty or not. If the president is found guilty then they are stripped of their office and may not be elected president again.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.psp.cz/docs/laws/constitution.html Ústava České republiky]. Psp.cz. Retrieved 2013-07-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Václav Klaus]] was [[Czech presidential election, 2003|elected in 2003]] and [[Czech presidential election, 2008|won his second term in 2008]]. His term ended in March 2013 as he was ineligible to run for another term. Before his term ended, he announced an amnesty to mark the 20th anniversary of the Czech Republic's independence. The amnesty took effect on 2 January and released all prisoners sentenced to one year or less whose sentences had not been served, and all prisoners over 75 years of age sentenced to ten years or less whose sentences had not been served, as well as cancelling all court proceedings which had been ongoing for longer than eight years. The amnesty was widely criticised by the public.&lt;ref name="Vaclav Klaus's controversial amnesty"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vaclav Klaus's controversial amnesty|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/01/czech-politics|website=The Economist|accessdate=11 February 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The amnesty sparked a public petition to persuade the Czech Senate to charge President Klaus with [[treason]] before the [[Constitutional court]],&lt;ref name="treason"&gt;{{cite news|date=4 March 2013|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-21660234|title=Czech President Vaclav Klaus faces treason charge|website=BBC News|accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; effectively impeaching him.&lt;ref name=NFPK&gt;{{cite web|title=Appeal for Impeachment against President Vaclav Klaus according to Article 65 of the Constitution|url=http://www.klausovavelezrada.cz/en/|work=NFPK|publisher=NFPK|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within 24 hours of its launch, it had collected 24,500 signatures, and by the beginning of February 2013, the petition had been signed by more than 64,000 people.&lt;ref name=Aktualne.cz&gt;{{cite web|title=Chtěji žalobu na Klause, mohou být v knize rekordů|url=http://aktualne.centrum.cz/domaci/politika/clanek.phtml?id=769788|work=Aktualne.cz|publisher=Aktualne.cz|accessdate=8 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impeachment==

{{Egyptian crisis (2011–14)}}

In July 2013, at the same time as [[Post-coup unrest in Egypt (2013–present)|mass protests]] began against the [[2013 Egyptian coup d'état|3 July coup d'état]] which deposed [[Mohamed Morsi]], and in parallel with the escalation of the already ongoing [[Sinai Insurgency|jihadist insurgency in the Sinai Peninsula]], pro-[[Muslim Brotherhood]] militants started violent attacks against policemen and soldiers in Central and Western Egypt. In the following months, new Islamist armed groups were created to reinstate Islamist rule in Egypt, like [[Soldiers of Egypt]] and the [[Popular Resistance Movement]]. Since 2013, violence in mainland Egypt has escalated and developed into a low-level Islamist insurgency against the Egyptian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's Escalating Islamist Insurgency|url=http://carnegie-mec.org/2015/10/21/egypt-s-escalating-islamist-insurgency/ijgn|publisher=Carnegie Middle East Center|date=21 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Egypt's Rising Security Threat|url=http://timep.org/esw/articles-analysis/egypts-rising-security-threat/|publisher=Tahrir Institute for Middle East Policy|date=15 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the 17 November 1971 coup by military dictators [[Thanom Kittikachorn]] and [[Praphas Charusathien]], Praphas appointed himself interior minister, chief of police, and head of CSOC.

The CSOC was implicated in several atrocities in its 1970s war against leftist groups. This included the [[Red Drum Massacre]], the mass murder of southern Thai activists by burning them alive in gasoline drums.{{CN|date=June 2016}}

ISOC conducted operations in cities and the Thai countryside to subvert leftist groups through propaganda and violence.&lt;ref name="Handley-2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Handley|first1=Paul M|title=The King Never Smiles: A Biography of Thailand's Bhumibol Adulyadej|date=2006|publisher=Yale University Press, 2006|location=New Haven|isbn=0300106823|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=x6VDmAEACAAJ&amp;dq=0300106823&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjtof2TyMHXAhUQSo8KHYMrAqMQ6AEIJzAA|page=222|accessdate=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1973, the ISOC commenced a bombing campaign against hill tribe villages in northern Thailand.{{CN|date=June 2016}}

ISOC's role declined starting in the early-1980s after the downfall of the CPT. However, it still had great influence. On 1 April 1987, after Prime Minister [[Kukrit Pramoj]] claimed that ISOC had been brainwashed by communists, over 200 Thai Army Rangers attacked the prime minister's residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.asiatour.com/thailand/e-01land/et-lan73.htm |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120721224621/http://www.asiatour.com/thailand/e-01land/et-lan73.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=21 July 2012 |title=THAILAND - |publisher= |accessdate=12 March 2017 }}{{failed verification|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post-2006-coup ISOC==
Thaksin planned a major restructuring of the ISOC prior to the coup which overthrew him in September 2006. Soon after the coup, the junta released three army suspects in the car bomb plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Car-bomb suspects get bail|url=http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/30/headlines/headlines_30015051.php|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303180101/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2006/09/30/headlines/headlines_30015051.php|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-03|accessdate=15 November 2017|work=The Nation|date=2006-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[CDRM|Junta]] leader and Army Commander-in-Chief General [[Sonthi Boonyaratglin]] appointed himself head of ISOC (its previous head had been the prime minister) and transformed ISOC into a "government within a government". The new ISOC was criticized as being a shadowy puppet master pulling the strings of existing agencies, answerable to no one but its leader.&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', [http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=5&amp;id=30021304 Thailand's Dept of Homeland Security] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929105501/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/search/page.news.php?clid=5&amp;id=30021304 |date=2007-09-29 }}, 12 December 2006{{failed verification|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To protect people in south Thailand from [[South Thailand insurgency|insurgency-related violence]], ISOC produced [[Jatukham Rammathep]] amulets for distribution to the Buddhist minority. The renowned animist amulets were believed to have magical powers to protect their wearers from violence and large sums are paid for them. The plan was developed by Colonel Manas Khongpan, deputy director of ISOC in [[Yala Province]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Nation'', [http://nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/14/national/national_30029259.php Amulets to 'help protect' Buddhists in South] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303175605/http://www.nationmultimedia.com/2007/03/14/national/national_30029259.php |date=2016-03-03 }}, 14 March 2007{{failed verification|date=November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The cabinet of General [[Surayud Chulanont]] gave 732 ISOC staff members an 84.3 million baht "reward" in mid-2007. ISOC explained that police and soldiers were temporarily transferred to support ISOC's operation. ISOC wanted to reward them for their hard work and sacrifice. ISOC had originally requested the reward in 2003, but was turned down by the Thaksin government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Cabinet backs B84.3m in Isoc 'rewards'|url=http://pages.citebite.com/v1l9r8e4s9evv|accessdate=15 November 2017|work=Bangkok Post|date=2007-07-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[Lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]], and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people in the [[Northern Mariana Islands]]''' may face legal challenges and discrimination not faced by non-LGBT people. [[Same-sex marriage]] and [[LGBT adoption|adoption]] became legal with the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court's]] ruling in the case of ''[[Obergefell v. Hodges]]'' in June 2015. However, the [[United States|U.S.]] territory does not ban discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity.

==History==
The [[Chamorro people]] have traditionally accepted homosexuality and transgender people. The [[Chamorro language|Chamorro]] word for a gay man is ''mamflorita'' (literally ''little flowers'').&lt;ref&gt;[https://guides.library.manoa.hawaii.edu/Pacificsexualidentity Gender identity and Sexual Identity in the Pacific and Hawai'i: Introduction]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legality of same-sex sexual activity==
Same-sex sexual activity has been legal in the Northern Marianas since 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay rights map: Notes on the data|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-26016267|accessdate=November 3, 2014|work=BBC News|date=February 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Recognition of same-sex relationships==
{{main article|Same-sex marriage in the Northern Mariana Islands}}

Same-sex marriage became legal in the Commonwealth on June 26, 2015, when the United States Supreme Court ruled that it is unconstitutional to ban same-sex marriages. Prior to this, there was no prohibition on same-sex marriage in the law of the territory, nor do the statutes specify the sex of the parties to a marriage between citizens of the Northern Mariana Islands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commonwealth Code|url=http://www.cnmilaw.org/frames/Commonwealth%20Code.html|publisher=Northern Mariana Islands Law Revision Commission|accessdate=April 21, 2015|at=Title 8 Section 1205|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520110659/http://www.cnmilaw.org/frames/Commonwealth%20Code.html|archivedate=May 20, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other provisions assume the parties to a marriage are not of the same sex. With respect to a marriage involving one or more non-citizens, the statutes say: "The male at the time of contracting the marriage be at least 18 years of age and the female at least 16 years of age..."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commonwealth Code|url=http://www.cnmilaw.org/frames/Commonwealth%20Code.html|publisher=Northern Mariana Islands Law Revision Commission|accessdate=April 21, 2015|at=Title 8 Section 1201|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160520110659/http://www.cnmilaw.org/frames/Commonwealth%20Code.html|archivedate=May 20, 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statutes concerning divorce assume that the partners to a marriage are man and wife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commonwealth Code|url=http://www.cnmilaw.org/frames/Commonwealth%20Code.html|publisher=Northern Mariana Islands Law Revision Commission|accessdate=April 21, 2015|quote=A divorce from marriage may be granted ... for the following causes ...

The first marriage between a same-sex couple occurred on the island of [[Saipan]] on July 22, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mvariety.com/cnmi/cnmi-news/local/78637-apatang-officiates-first-same-sex-marriage-on-saipan Apatang officiates first same-sex marriage on Saipan]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discrimination protections and hate crime law==
The Northern Mariana Islands does not protect people from discrimination on the basis of their [[sexual orientation]] and/or [[gender identity]]. Additionally, the territory does not ban hate crimes based on sexual orientation and gender identity. However, such [[hate crime]]s are banned federally under the ''[[Matthew Shepard and James Byrd Jr. Hate Crimes Prevention Act]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/10/28/obama-signs-hate-crimes-bill/|title=Obama Signs Hate Crimes Bill|publisher=nytimes.com|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender persons are allowed to serve openly in the American Armed Forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/id/43859711/ns/us_news-life/ Obama certifies end of military's gay ban]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender identity and expression==
Transgender persons in the Northern Mariana Islands may change their legal gender following [[sex reassignment surgery]] and a name change. The ''Vital Statistics Act of 2006'', which took effect in March 2007, states that: "Upon receipt of a certified copy of an order of the CNMI Superior Court indicating the sex of an individual born in the CNMI has been changed by surgical procedure and whether such individual’s name has been changed, the certificate of birth of such individual shall be amended as prescribed by regulation." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite act |title= Vital Statistics Act of 2006 |type= Public Law |number= 15-50|language= English |date= 2006 | url=http://www.cnmilaw.org/pdf/public_laws/15/pl15-50.pdf |accessdate= 12 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Living conditions==
The first pride parade in the Northern Mariana Islands was held in July 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/lgbt-celebrates-gay-pride-at-gig/ |title=LGBT celebrates Gay Pride at GIG|website=Saipan Tribune|date=August 1, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since legalization in June 2015, the territory has become a popular marriage destination for same-sex couples, especially among [[China|Chinese]] tourists. In the first half of 2018, 77% of all marriages were same-sex marriages.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.saipantribune.com/index.php/same-sex-tourism-still-all-the-rage-in-cnmi/ Same-sex tourism still all the rage in CNMI]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="30003">'''Lettrism''' is a French [[avant-garde]] movement, established in Paris in the mid-1940s by [[Romania]]n immigrant [[Isidore Isou]].&lt;ref&gt;Walker, John. (1992) [http://www.artdesigncafe.com/lettrism-1992 "Lettrism"]. ''Glossary of Art, Architecture &amp; Design since 1945'', 3rd. ed.&lt;/ref&gt; In a body of work totaling hundreds of volumes, Isou and the Lettrists have applied their theories to all areas of art and culture, most notably in poetry, film, painting and political theory. The movement has its theoretical roots in [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]]. Isou viewed his fellow countryman [[Tristan Tzara]] as the greatest creator and rightful leader of the Dada movement, and dismissed most of the others as plagiarists and falsifiers.&lt;ref&gt;See Isou, ''Les véritables créateurs et les falsificateurs de dada, du surréalisme et du lettrisme'' (1973), and Maurice Lemaître, ''Le lettrisme devant dada et les nécrophages de dada'' (1967).&lt;/ref&gt; Among the Surrealists, [[André Breton]] was a significant influence, but Isou was dissatisfied by what he saw as the stagnation and theoretical bankruptcy of the movement as it stood in the 1940s.&lt;ref&gt;See Isou, ''Réflexions sur André Breton'' (1948).&lt;/ref&gt;

In French, the movement is called '''''Lettrisme''''', from the French word for ''letter'', arising from the fact that many of their early works centred on letters and other visual or spoken symbols. The ''Lettristes'' themselves prefer the spelling ''''Letterism'''' for the Anglicised term, and this is the form that is used on those rare occasions when they produce or supervise English translations of their writings: however, 'Lettrism' is at least as common in English usage. The term, having been the original name that was first given to the group, has lingered as a blanket term to cover all of their activities, even as many of these have moved away from any connection to letters. But other names have also been introduced, either for the group as a whole or for its activities in specific domains, such as 'the Isouian movement', 'youth uprising', '[[hypergraphics]]', 'creatics', 'infinitesimal art' and 'excoördism'.

== History ==
'''1925.'''&lt;ref&gt;For fuller chronological details, see Curtay, ''La poésie lettriste''; Foster, ''Lettrisme: Into the Present'';  Sabatier, ''Le lettrisme''.&lt;/ref&gt; Isidore Goldstein is born at [[Botoşani]], [[Romania]], on January 31, to an [[Ashkenazi]] Jewish family. During the early 1950s, Goldstein would be signing himself 'Jean-Isidore Isou'; otherwise, it has always been '[[Isidore Isou]]'. 'Isou' is standardly taken to be a pseudonym, but Isou/Goldstein himself resists this interpretation.

&lt;blockquote&gt;My name is Isou. My mother called me Isou, only it's written differently in Romanian. And Goldstein: I'm not ashamed of my name. At Gallimard, I was known as Isidore Isou Goldstein. Isou, it's my name! Only in Romanian it's written Izu, but in French it's Isou.&lt;ref&gt;Interview with Roland Sabatier, 15 November 1999, in ''La Termitière'', no. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== 1940s ===
*'''1942–1944.''' Isou develops the principles of Lettrism, and begins writing the books that he would subsequently publish after his relocation to [[Paris]].
*'''1945.''' Aged twenty, Isou arrives in Paris on August 23 after six weeks of clandestine travel. In November, he founds the Letterist movement with [[Gabriel Pomerand]].
*'''1946.''' Isou and Pomerand disrupt a performance of Tzara's ''La Fuite'' at the Vieux-Colombier. Publication of ''La Dictature Lettriste: cahiers d'un nouveau régime artistique'' (''The Letterist Dictatorship: notebooks of a new artistic regime''). Although announced as the first in a series, only one such notebook would appear. A subtitle proudly boasts of Letterism that it is 'the only contemporary movement of the artistic avant-garde'.
*'''1947.''' Isou's first two books are published by [[Gallimard]]: ''Introduction à une nouvelle poésie et à une nouvelle musique'' (''Introduction to a New Poetry and a New Music'') and ''L'Agrégation d'un nom et d'un messie'' (''Aggregation of a Name and a Messiah''). The former sets out Isou's theory of the 'amplic' and 'chiselling' phases, and, within this framework, presents his views on both the past history and the future direction of '''poetry''' and '''music'''. The latter is more biographical, discussing the genesis of Isou's ideas, as well as exploring [[Judaism]]. Isou and Pomerand are joined by François Dufrêne.
*'''1949.''' Isou publishes ''Isou, ou la mécanique des femmes'' (''Isou, or the mechanics of women''), the first of several works of '''[[erotology]]''',  wherein he claims to have bedded 375 women in the preceding four years, and offers to explain how (p.&amp;nbsp;9). The book is banned and Isou is briefly imprisoned. Also published, the first of several works on '''political theory''', Isou's ''Traité d'économie nucléaire: Le soulèvement de la jeunesse'' (''Treatise of Nuclear Economics: Youth Uprising'').

=== 1950s ===
*'''1950.''' [[Maurice Lemaître]], [[Jean-Louis Brau]], [[Gil J. Wolman]] and [[Serge Berna]] join the group. Isou publishes first [[metagraphy|metagraphic]] '''novel''', ''Les journaux des dieux'' (''The Gods' Diaries''), followed soon afterwards by Pomerand's ''Saint Ghetto des Prêts'' (''Saint Ghetto of the Loans'') and Lemaître's ''Canailles'' (''Scoundrels''). Also, the first manifestos of Letterist '''painting'''. Some of the younger Letterists [[Notre-Dame Affair|invade Nôtre Dame cathedral at Easter mass]], aired live on national TV, to announce to the congregation that God is dead. In a Letterist [[FAQ]] published in the first issue of Lemaître's journal, ''Ur'', CP-Matricon explains: 'The letterists do not create scandals: they break the [[Conspiracy of silence (expression)|conspiracy of silence]] set up by pusillanimous show-offs (journalists) and smash the faces of those who don't please them.' (p.&amp;nbsp;8).
*'''1951.''' Isou completes his first '''film''', ''[[Traité de bave et d'éternité]]'' (''Treatise on Slime and Eternity''), which will soon be followed by Lemaître's ''Le film est déjà commencé?'' (''Has the film already started?''), [[Gil J. Wolman|Wolman]]'s ''L'Anticoncept'' (''The Anticoncept''), [[François Dufrêne|Dufrêne]]'s ''Tambours du jugement premier'' (''Drums of the First Judgment'') and [[Guy Debord]]'s ''[[Hurlements en faveur de Sade]]'' (''Howls for de Sade''). Debord joins the group in April when they travel down to [[Cannes]] (where he was then living) to show ''Traité de bave et d'éternité'' at the [[Cannes Film Festival]]. Under the auspices of [[Jean Cocteau]], a prize for 'best avant-garde' is specially created and awarded to Isou's film.
*'''1952.''' Publication of the first (and only) issue of ''Ion'', devoted to Letterist film. This is significant for including Debord's first appearance in print, alongside work from Wolman and Berna who, following an intervention at a [[Charlie Chaplin]] press conference at the Hotel Ritz in October, would join him in splitting from Isou's group to form the '''Letterist International'''.
{{Main|Letterist International}}
*'''1953.''' Isou moves into '''photography''' with ''Amos, ou Introduction à la métagraphologie'' (''Amos, or Introduction to Metagraphology''), '''theatre''' with ''Fondements pour la transformation intégrale du théâtre'' (''The Foundations of the Integrated Transformation of the Theatre''), '''painting''' with ''Les nombres'' (''The Numbers''), and '''dance''' with ''Manifeste pour une danse ciselante'' (''Manifesto for Chiselling Dance'').
*'''1955.''' Dufrêne develops his first ''Crirhythmes''.
*'''1956.''' Isou introduces the concept of infinitesimal art in ''Introduction à une esthétique imaginaire'' (''Introduction to Imaginary Aesthetics'').
*'''1958.''' [[Columbia Records]] release the first audio recordings of Letterist poetry, ''Maurice Lemaître presente le lettrisme''.

=== 1960s ===
*'''1960.''' Isou introduces the concept of supertemporal art in ''L'Art supertemporel''. [[Asger Jorn]] publishes a critique of Letterism, ''[http://www.cddc.vt.edu/sionline/si/originality.html Originality and Magnitude (on the system of Isou)]'' in issue 4 of ''Internationale Situationniste''. Isou replies at length in ''L'Internationale Situationniste, un degré plus bas que le jarrivisme et l'englobant''. This is only the first of many works that Isou will write against Debord (his former protégé) and the [[Situationist International]], which Isou regards as a neo-Nazi organisation. However, as Andrew Hussey reports, his attitude does eventually mellow: 'Now Isou forgave them and he saw (it was crucial, Isou said, that I should understand this!) that they were all on the same side after all.'&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Hussey, ''The Game of War'' (London: Jonathan Cape, 2001), p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In the sixties, several new members join group, including [[Jacques Spacagna]] (1961), [[Aude Jessemin]] (1962), [[Roberto Altmann]] (1962), [[Roland Sabatier]] (1963), [[Alain Satié]] (1964), [[Micheline Hachette]] (1964), [[Francois Poyet]] (1966), [[Jean-Paul Curtay]] (1967),  [[Anton Perich]] (1967), [[Gérard-Philippe Broutin]] (1968).
*'''1964.''' Definitive split with Dufrêne and the [[ultra-lettrist|Ultraletterists]], as well as with Wolman who, despite his participation from 1952 to 1957 with the Letterist International (who were forbidden by internal statute from any involvement in Isouian activities), had retained links with Isou's group. Dufrêne and Wolman with Brau form the Second Letterist International (''Deuxième internationale lettriste'').
*'''1967.''' Lemaître stands for election to the local Parisian legislature, representing the 'Union of Youth and Externity'. He loses.
*'''1968.''' First work on '''architecture''', Isou's ''Manifeste pour le bouleversement de l'architecture'' (''Manifesto for the Overhaul of Architecture'').

=== 1970s and 1980s ===
General continuation of existing currents, together with new research into psychiatry, mathematics, physics, and chemistry.
*'''1972''' [[Mike Rose (painter)]], a German painter, set designer, and writer made acquaintance with the Lettrists and became part of them. He participated in their exhibitions until the 1980s.
Other members to join the lettrism during the seventies : [[Woody Roehmer]], [[Anne-Catherine Caron]], and during the eighties : Frédérique Devaux, Michel Amarger ...

=== 1990s ===
Development of excoordism. Uncomfortable with the direction the group is going in, Lemaître—Isou's right-hand man for nearly half a century—begins to distance himself from it.&lt;ref&gt;See Satié, ''Le lettrisme, la creation ininterrompue'' (Paris: Jean-Paul Rocher, 2003), 56n34.&lt;/ref&gt; He still continues to pursue traditional Letterist techniques, but now in relative isolation from the main group.

=== 2000s ===
* '''2007''' Isou dies  and [http://antisystemic.org/DAMTP/TheEndOfTheAgeOfDivinity-Enkutatach409.pdf The End of the Age of Divinity] is published.

== Key concepts ==

=== The Amplic (''amplique'') and the Chiselling (''ciselante'') phases ===
Isou first invented these phases through an examination of the history of poetry, but the conceptual apparatus he developed could very easily be applied to most other branches of art and culture. In poetry, he felt that the first amplic phase had been initiated by [[Homer]]. In effect, Homer set out a blueprint for what a poem ought to be like. Subsequent poets then developed this blueprint, investigating by means of their work all of the different things that could be done within the Homeric parameters. Eventually, however, everything that ''could be'' done within that approach ''had been'' done. In poetry, Isou felt that this point was reached with [[Victor Hugo]] (and in painting with [[Eugène Delacroix]], in music with [[Richard Wagner]].). When amplic poetry had been completed, there was simply nothing to be gained by continuing to produce works constructed according to the old model. There would no longer be any genuine creativity or innovation involved, and hence no aesthetic value. This then inaugurated a chiselling phase in the art. Whereas the form had formerly been used as a tool to express things outside its own domain—events, feelings, etc.--it would then turn in on itself and become, perhaps only implicitly, its own subject matter. From [[Charles Baudelaire]] to [[Tristan Tzara]] (as, in painting, from [[Édouard Manet|Manet]] to [[Wassily Kandinsky|Kandinsky]]; or, in music, from [[Debussy]] to [[Luigi Russolo]]), subsequent poets would deconstruct the grand edifice of poetry that had been developed over the centuries according to the Homeric model. Finally, when this process of deconstruction had been completed, it would then be time for a new amplic phase to commence. Isou saw himself as the man to show the way. He would take the rubble that remained after the old forms had been shattered, and lay out a new blueprint for reutilising these most basic elements in a radically new way, utterly unlike the poetry of the preceding amplic phase. Isou identified the most basic elements of poetic creation as ''letters''—i.e. uninterpreted visual symbols and acoustic sounds—and he set out the parameters for new ways of recombining these ingredients in the name of new aesthetic goals.

=== The ''Lettrie'' ===
Isou's idea for the poem of the future was that it should be purely formal, devoid of all semantic content. The Letterist poem, or ''lettrie'', in many ways resembles what certain [[Futurism (art)|Italian Futurists]] (such as [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti]]), [[Russian Futurism|Russian Futurists]] (such as [[Velimir Khlebnikov|Velemir Chlebnikov]], [[Iliazd]], or [[Aleksei Kruchenykh|Alexej Kručenych]]—cf. [[Zaum]]), and [[Dada]] poets (such as [[Raoul Hausmann]] or [[Kurt Schwitters]]) had already been doing, and what subsequent [[sound poetry|sound poets]] and [[concrete poetry|concrete poets]] (such as [[Bob Cobbing]], [[Eduard Ovčáček]] or [[Henri Chopin]]) would later be doing. However, the Letterists were always keen to insist on their own radical originality and to distinguish their work from other ostensibly similar currents.

=== Metagraphics/Hypergraphics ===
On the visual side, the Letterists first gave the name '[[metagraphy|metagraphics]]' (''metagraphie'') and then '[[hypergraphics]]' (''hypergraphie'') to their new synthesis of writing and visual art. Some precedents may be seen in [[Cubist]], [[Dada]] and Futurist (both [[Futurism (art)|Italian]] and [[Russian Futurism|Russian]]) [[painting]] and [[typography|typographical]] works, such as [[Filippo Tommaso Marinetti|Marinetti's]] [[Zang Tumb Tumb|Zang Tumb Tuum]], or in poems such as [[Guillaume Apollinaire|Apollinaire's]] ''Calligrammes'' but none of them were a full system like hypergraphy.

=== Letterist film ===
Notwithstanding the considerably more recent origins of film-making, compared to poetry, painting or music, Isou felt in 1950 that its own first amplic phase had already been completed. He therefore set about inaugurating a chiselling phase for the cinema. As he explained in the voiceover to his first film, ''Treatise of Slime and Eternity'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;I believe firstly that the cinema is too rich. It is obese. It has reached its limits, its maximum. With the first movement of widening which it will outline, the cinema will burst! Under the blow of a congestion, this ''greased pig'' will tear into a thousand pieces. I announce the ''destruction of the cinema'', the first apocalyptic sign of disjunction, of rupture, of this corpulent and bloated organization which calls itself film.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The two central innovations of Letterist film were: (i) the carving of the image (''la ciselure d'image''), where the film-maker would deliberately scratch or paint onto the actual film stock itself. Similar techniques are also employed in Letterist still photography. (ii) Discrepant cinema (''le cinéma discrépant''), where the soundtrack and the image-track would be separated, each one telling a different story or pursuing its own more abstract path. The most radical of the Letterist films, Wolman's ''The Anticoncept'' and Debord's ''Howls for Sade'', went even further, and abandoned images altogether. From a visual point of view, the former consisted simply of a fluctuating ball of light, projected onto a large balloon, while the latter alternated a blank white screen (when there was speech in the soundtrack) and a totally black screen (accompanying ever-increasing periods of total silence). In addition, the Letterists utilised material appropriated from other films, a technique which would subsequently be developed (under the title of '[[détournement]]') in Situationist film. They would also often supplement the film with live performance, or, through the 'film-debate', directly involve the audience itself in the total experience.

=== Supertemporal art (''L'art supertemporel'') ===
The supertemporal frame was a device for inviting and enabling an audience to participate in the creation of a work of art. In its simplest form, this might involve nothing more than the inclusion of several blank pages in a book, for the reader to add his or her own contributions.

=== Infinitesimal art (''Art infinitesimal'') ===
Recalling the [[infinitesimals]] of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], quantities which could not actually exist except conceptually, the Letterists developed the notion of a work of art which, by its very nature, could never be created in reality, but which could nevertheless provide aesthetic rewards by being contemplated intellectually. Also called ''Art esthapériste'' ('infinite-aesthetics'). Cf. [[Conceptual Art]]. Related to this, and arising out of it, is excoördism, the current incarnation of the Isouian movement, defined as the art of the infinitely large and the infinitely small.

=== Youth uprising (''Le soulèvement de la jeunesse'') ===
Isou identified the amplic phase of political theory and economics as that of [[Adam Smith]] and [[free trade]]; its chiselling phase was that of [[Karl Marx]] and [[socialism]]. Isou termed these 'atomic economics' and 'molecular economics' respectively: he launched 'nuclear economics' as a corrective to both of them. Both currents, he felt, had simply failed to take into account a large part of the population, namely those young people and other 'externs' who neither produced nor exchanged goods or capital in any significant way. He felt that the creative urge was an integral part of human nature, but that, unless it was properly guided, it could be diverted into crime and anti-social behaviour. The Letterists sought to restructure every aspect of society in such a way as to enable these externs to channel their creativity in more positive ways.

== Major developments of Lettrism ==
* The [[Letterist International]] was formed in 1952 by Lettrists [[Guy Debord]], [[Gil J. Wolman]], [[Jean-Louis Brau]] and [[Serge Berna]]. In 1957, it fused with the [[International Movement for an Imaginist Bauhaus]] and the [[London Psychogeographical Association]] to create the [[Situationist International]]. During its five years, the Letterist International continued to practice the Lettrist technique of [[metagraphy|metagraphics]], although they were quite against [[hypergraphics]], instead developing metagraphics into [[détournement]].&lt;ref&gt;See Patrick Straram, ''La veuve blanche et noire un peu détournée'' (Paris [[Sens &amp; Tonka]], 2006), 21–22, 81–82; ''Figures de la négation'' (Saint-Etienne Métropole: Musée d'Art Moderne, 2004), 78–80.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Ultra-Lettrist|Ultra-Lettrism]] arose in 1958, its manifesto appearing in the second issue of ''Grammes'' in that year, signed by the Lettrists François Dufrêne, Robert Estivals, and Jacques Villeglé. Its members practiced [[hypergraphics]] and, with Dufrêne's crirhythmes and a greater interest in tape-recording, they sought to push Letterist sound-poetry further than Isou's group had done.&lt;ref&gt;''Figures de la négation'', 118; [[Henri Chopin]], ''Poésie sonore'' (Paris: Jean-Michel Place, 1979), 88-93.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The Second Letterist International was an ephemeral group formed in 1964 by Wolman, Dufrêne and Brau.&lt;ref&gt;''Figures de la négation'', 76; [[Gil J. Wolman]], ''Défense de mourir'' (Paris: Editions Allia, 2001), 144–45.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[New Lettrist International]], unknown form the original lettrists themselves, was formed in the late 1990s. Although it has no direct connection with the original Letterist group, it has drawn influences both from them and from the [[Letterist International]], as well as from [[Hurufi]]sm (Arabic for 'Letterism').

== Key members ==
* [[Isidore Isou]] (Jan 29, 1925–July 28, 2007).
* [[Gabriel Pomerand]] (1926–1972), member from 1945.
* [[François Dufrêne]] (1930–1982), member from 1947 to 1964. Split to form [[Ultra-Lettrist|Ultra-letterism]] and the Second Letterist International.
* [[Jan Kubíček]] (1927–2013), significantly contributing member during the early 1960s.
* [[Maurice Lemaître]] (1926–), member since 1950, and still actively pursuing his own approach to Letterism.
* [[Gil J Wolman]] (1929–1995), member from 1950 to 1952. Split to form [[Lettrist International|Letterist International]] 1952-1957], but then returned to occasional participation with Isouian group from 1961 to 1964, before splitting again to form the Second Letterist International.
* [[Jean-Louis Brau]] (1930–1985), member from 1950 to 1952. Split to form [[Lettrist International|Letterist International]] 1952-1957], but then returned to occasional participation with Isouian group from 1961 to 1964, before splitting again to form the Second Letterist International.*
* [[Guy Debord]] (1931–1994), member from 1951 to 1952. Split to form [[Lettrist International|Letterist International]].
* [[Anton Perich]] (1945-), member from 1967 to 1970.

== Influences ==
* [[Fluxus]] artist [[Ben Vautier]] has openly avowed his indebtedness to Isou: "Isou, I don't deny it, was very important for me around 1958 when I first theorized about art. It was thanks to Isou that I realized that what was important in art was not the beautiful, but the new, the creation. In 1962, while reading ''L'agrégation d'un nom et d'un messie'', I was fascinated by his ego, his megalomania, his pretences. I said to myself then: there is no art without ego, and this is where my work on the ego is rooted."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in ''Art Tribes'', ed. Achille Bonito Oliva (Milan: Skira, 2002), 274n2.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The German painter, set designer, and writer, [[Mike Rose (painter)|Mike Rose]], developed techniques close to Letterism during the 1970s and 1980s, and had some contact with the Parisian group.
* The film ''Irma Vep'' (1996) contains a sequence that evokes the Lettrist aesthetic.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arkepix.com/kinok/DVD/ASSAYAS_Olivier/dvd_noise.html (French site)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Michael Jacobson's novella ''The Giant's Fence'' [http://www.ubu.com/vp/Jacobson.html] (2006) is a hypergraphic work, apparently inspired by the Letterists.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10092">[[Bulgaria]] is divided into 31 multi-member constituencies.

==Background==
In general the 31 [[constituency|constituencies]] are arrange as to coincide with the [[administrative division]] of [[Bulgaria]], with the exception of Sofia City and Plovdiv provinces, where there are 3 additional constituencies (Sofia City is divided into 3 constituencies and Plovdiv is divided into 2). They are numbered according to their order in [[Cyrillic script|Cyrillic]].

Experimentally on [[Bulgarian parliamentary election, 2009]], 31 out of the 240 Members of Parliament were elected through [[majority vote]], while the rest 209 are elected through [[party-list proportional representation|proportional vote]]. This mixed electoral system was rejected later.

A '''local option''' is the ability of local political jurisdictions, typically [[U.S. county|counties]] or [[municipalities]], to allow decisions on certain controversial issues based on popular vote within their borders. In practice, it usually relates to the issue of [[alcoholic beverage]] and [[marijuana]] sales.

As described by an encyclopedia in 1907, local option is the "license granted to the inhabitants of a district to extinguish or reduce the sale of intoxicants in their midst." A 1911 Encyclopædia describes it as "specifically used in politics of the power given to the electorate of a particular district to choose whether licences for the sale of intoxicating liquor should be granted or not." This form of "local option" has also been termed "local veto."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite EB1911 |wstitle=Option |volume=20 |page=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local option regarding alcohol was first used in the [[temperance movement]] as a means to bring about [[prohibition]] gradually. In the 1830s, temperance activists mobilized to restrict licenses in towns and counties in New England. By the 1840s, temperance reformers demanded state laws to allow local voters to decide whether any liquor licenses would be issued in their localities. Some 12 states and territories had some form of these early local option laws by the late 1840s. Controversy over the measures gave rise to the first major confrontation in the United States over the propriety and constitutionality of ballot-box legislation, or referendums. Opponents of local option, which included drinkers and liquor dealers (many of whom were immigrants) argued that local option authorized the "tyranny of the majority" and infringed upon the rights of the liquor-dealing and liquor-consuming minority.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kyle G. Volk |title=Moral Minorities and the Making of American Democracy |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2014 |isbn=978-0199371914 |oclc=870986742 |url={{google books|NTGTAwAAQBAJ|plainurl=y}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Local option, as a method of alcohol control,  made a resurgence after the Civil War. The [[Anti-Saloon League]] initially decided to use local option as the mechanism to bring about nationwide prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/mdp.39015071423217 |title=The Illinois Local Option Law |year=1907 |website=HathiTrust Digital Library |publisher=Anti-Saloon League of Illinois}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its intent was to work across the country at the local level.  In many instances, however, it was not the agenda.  For instance, several wards in [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], passed local option but were vehemently against province-wide prohibition, preferring to isolate alcohol sales rather than ban them altogether. That is particularly evident in Toronto's [[The Junction|Junction]] neighbourhood, part of which remained notoriously dry as late as 2000, the last area of [[Ontario]] to repeal prohibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/hvd.32044010013027 |title=The Campaign Manual |first=Francis Stephens |last=Spence |year=1912 |website=HathiTrust Digital Library |location=Toronto, Canada |publisher=The Pioneer Office}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the [[repeal]] of [[Prohibition in the United States|national Prohibition]] in the [[United States]] in 1933, some states chose to maintain prohibition within their own borders. Others chose to permit local option on the controversial issue. In the remainder of states, there was no prohibition. Overlying the patchwork of prohibition, many states (known as [[alcoholic beverage control state]]s) decided to establish their own [[monopolies]] over the wholesaling and/or retailing of alcoholic beverages. [[Montgomery County, Maryland]], for example, has used local option to establish its alcohol control monopoly within its borders.

The '''machinery of government''' (sometimes '''MoG''') means the interconnected structures and processes of [[government]], such as the functions and accountability of [[Government department|departments]] in the [[Executive (government)|executive]] branch of government. The term is used particularly in the context of changes to established systems of [[public administration]] where different elements of machinery&lt;ref&gt;For example, a Number 10 Press Notice on 5 May 2006 was entitled ''Machinery of Government changes'' in announcing the creation of a new department of the British Government, accessed at {{cite web |url=http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page2517.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-06-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030402022357/http://www.number10.gov.uk/output/Page2517.asp |archivedate=2 April 2003 |df=dmy-all }} 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; are created.

The phrase "machinery of government" is thought to have originated with [[John Stuart Mill]] in ''Considerations on Representative Government''&lt;ref&gt;Mill, J.S. (1861) Considerations on Representative Government, Chapter V; editions include Kessinger, {{ISBN|0-7661-8898-1}}; text accessed at University of Texas at Austin [http://www.la.utexas.edu/research/poltheory/mill/repgov/repgov.c05.s01.html] 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; (1861). It was notably used to a public audience by President FD Roosevelt in a radio broadcast&lt;ref&gt;Roosevelt, F.D. ''Fireside Chat'' broadcast 30 September 1934 accessed at Mid-Hudson Regional Information Center [http://www.mhric.org/fdr/chat6.html] 12 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; in 1934, commenting on the role of the [[National Recovery Administration]] (NRA) in delivering the [[New Deal]]. A number of national governments including those of [[Australia]], [[Canada]], [[South Africa]] and the [[United Kingdom]] have adopted the term in official usage.

==Australia==
In Australia, the terms ‘machinery of government changes’ and ‘administrative re-arrangements’ are interchangeable and are used to refer to the changes to the structure of government and the allocation of government functions between departments and ministers.&lt;ref name="APSCGuideCh1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Implementing machinery of government changes|date=September 2013|chapter=Chapter 1: Machinery of Government Process|publisher=Australian Public Service Commission|accessdate=24 September 2013|chapterurl=http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/current-publications/machinery-of-government/process}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Machinery of government changes may occur at any time, however the most significant changes generally occur immediately following an election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/archive/publications-archive/implementing-machinery-of-government-changes|title=ARCHIVE: Implementing Machinery of Government Changes|accessdate=25 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928023234/http://www.apsc.gov.au/publications-and-media/archive/publications-archive/implementing-machinery-of-government-changes|deadurl=no|archivedate=28 September 2013|publisher=Australian Public Service Commission}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is usually very little consultation or discussion prior to machinery of government changes in Australia, especially those following elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/binaries/library/pubs/rp/1998-99/99rp24.pdf|title=Departmental Machinery of Government Since 1987: Research paper No. 24 1998-99|publisher=Department of the Parliamentary Library|date=29 June 1999|first=John |last=Nethercote}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Government of Australia|Commonwealth Government]] and some state and territory governments use Administrative Arrangements Orders (also called AAOs) as legal instruments as a primary method to make machinery of government changes.

===Australian Government Administrative Arrangement Orders===
{{main article|List of Australian government entities}}
At the Commonwealth Government level, Administrative Arrangements Orders (AAOs) are made by the [[Governor-General of Australia|Governor-General]] on the advice of the [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]] formally allocating executive responsibility among ministers. AAOs establish [[Departments of State]] under the [[Constitution of Australia|Constitution]], including the principal matters and legislation dealt with by each Department and its Minister(s).&lt;ref name="ComLawdefinition"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Details/C2013G00742|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130117144647/http://www.comlaw.gov.au/content/whatisit|archivedate=17 January 2013|title=Explore the law: an A-Z of key jargon and sources|publisher=ComLaw|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The AAO is generally only updated when functions move between departments, ordering machinery of government changes.&lt;ref name="ComLawdefinition" /&gt; Since 1901 there have been over 170 AAOs ordered by the Governor-General.&lt;ref name="NAA AAOs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/publications/aao/index.aspx|title=Administrative Arrangements Orders|publisher=National Archives of Australia|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409090010/http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/publications/aao/index.aspx|archivedate=9 April 2013|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only one AAO remains active at any one time; when a new AAO is made, all previous AAOs are revoked.&lt;ref name="ComLawMay2013"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comlaw.gov.au/content/whatisit|title=Administrative Arrangements Order - 16 May 2013|publisher=ComLaw|date=17 May 2013|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Administrative Arrangement Orders are generally published in the ''Commonwealth Gazette''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/records-management/publications/glossary.aspx#gloss-administrativearrangementsorder|title=Glossary|publisher=National Archives of Australia|accessdate=24 September 2013|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130814034703/http://naa.gov.au/records-management/publications/glossary.aspx|archivedate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Administrative Arrangements Orders are seen by some academics as a central platform of good government management as the orders set the basic structure of cabinet, ministerial responsibilities, portfolios and departments.&lt;ref name="PodgerJuly2013"&gt;{{cite news|first=Andrew|last= Podger|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/national/public-service/a-wishlist-for-a-better-government-20130701-2p6g0.html|title=A wish-list for better government|newspaper=The Canberra Times|publisher=Fairfax Media|date=2 July 2013|accessdate=24 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Implementation costs====
When an Administrative Arrangements Order orders departments to be split, cut or combined, the costs involved in public service machinery of government may include:
*renaming departments, redesigning websites and changing signs;&lt;ref name="Churn18Sep"&gt;{{cite news|first=Markus |last=Mannheim|title=High price of churn|date=18 September 2013|accessdate=23 September 2013|newspaper=The Sydney Morning Herald|publisher=Fairfax Media|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/public-service/high-price-of-churn-20130917-2txlz.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105005111/http://www.smh.com.au/national/public-service/high-price-of-churn-20130917-2txlz.html|archivedate=5 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*transferring staff, furniture, equipment, leases and files between departments;&lt;ref name="Churn18Sep" /&gt;
*transferring or merging IT services;&lt;ref name="Churn18Sep" /&gt; and
*cutting staff, particularly in senior ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-18/tony-abbott-sworn-in-as-australian-prime-minister/4965104|title=Tony Abbott sworn in as Australia's 28th Prime Minister|first=Emma |last=Griffiths|date=19 September 2013|accessdate=24 September 2013|publisher=ABC News|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327052250/http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-18/tony-abbott-sworn-in-as-australian-prime-minister/4965104|archivedate=27 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Total costs associated with issuing new Administrative Arrangements Orders are unknown, as the costs involved with machinery of government changes are not collated or reported,&lt;ref name="Churn18Sep" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.naa.gov.au/about-us/media/media-releases/2013/34.aspx|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140704230020/http://naa.gov.au/about-us/media/media-releases/2013/34.aspx|archivedate=4 July 2014|title=How to navigate Machinery of Government changes|date=9 August 2013|accessdate=25 September 2013|publisher=National Archives of Australia}}&lt;/ref&gt; but in November 2013 the Secretary of the [[Department of Immigration and Border Protection]] told a Senate estimates hearing that the cost of the Department's name change was cheap at 'only' an estimated $195,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.canberratimes.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/departments-new-name-to-cost-200000-20131119-2xtnw.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140307201252/http://www.canberratimes.com.au/federal-politics/political-news/departments-new-name-to-cost-200000-20131119-2xtnw.html|archivedate=7 March 2014|title=Department's new name to cost $200,000|first=Heath|last=Aston|date=20 November 2013|newspaper=The Canberra Times|publisher=Fairfax Media}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Ministry of the Treasury of the Argentine Nation''' is a ministry and the [[treasury]] of the Argentine [[Government of Argentina|federal government]]. 

The current Minister of the Treasury is [[Nicolás Dujovne]].

==Headquarters==
[[File:Palacio de Hacienda (1940).JPG|thumb|210px|The Economy Ministry in 1940]]
The Argentine Ministry of the Treasury has, since the building's 1939 inaugural, been based in a 14-story [[Rationalism (architecture)|Rationalist]] office building designed by local architect Carlos Pibernat. The Economy Ministry building was built on a 0.57 ha (1.4 ac) [[Montserrat, Buenos Aires|Montserrat]] neighborhood lot facing the [[Casa Rosada]] presidential office building to the north, and the Defense Ministry ([[Libertador Building]]) to the east{{spaced ndash}}a government building also designed by Pibernat.

The building's lobby was decorated with murals painted by the architect's brother, Antonio Pibernat, a [[post-impressionist]] painter influenced by the naturalist [[Barbizon School]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mecon.gov.ar/patrimonio_cultural/pibernat/nochemus.htm Ministry of Economy: Cultural patrimony] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091219204142/http://www.mecon.gov.ar/patrimonio_cultural/pibernat/nochemus.htm |date=2009-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The post has existed on a formal basis since the 1826 inaugural of [[Bernardino Rivadavia]], who named lawmaker [[Salvador María del Carril]] as the nation's first official ''Ministro de Hacienda''.&lt;ref&gt;Levene, Ricardo.''A History of Argentina''. University of North Carolina Press, 1937.&lt;/ref&gt; The office became among the most powerful in [[Argentine Government]] during the [[Generation of '80|generation after 1880]], when [[English Argentine]] investment, [[Foreign trade of Argentina|foreign trade]], and [[Immigration in Argentina|immigration]] spurred development. [[Customs]] collections (source of over half of public revenues at the time) and the [[Central Bank of Argentina|Central Bank]] were among the responsibilities placed under the Economy Ministry's aegis, and successive ministers' policies were often enacted through [[presidential decree]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rock, David. ''Argentina: 1516&amp;ndash;1982''. University of California Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its influence grew further when it absorbed the cabinet post of Minister of Public Works in 1991, to help facilitate Economy Minister [[Domingo Cavallo]]'s [[privatization]]s initiative, and, in turn, divested oversight over the nation's goods-producing sectors with the 2008 designation of the Production Ministry by President [[Cristina Kirchner]], in a bid to improve strained relations with the country's [[Agriculture in Argentina|agrarian sector]] following the [[2008 Argentine government conflict with the agricultural sector]] over export tariffs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ellitoral.com/index.php/diarios/2008/11/26/politica/POLI-03.html ''El Litoral'': Ministerio de la Producción {{es icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of the Treasury was appropriated a US$1.7 billion operational budget in 2009, and employed over 4,000 staffers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mecon.gov.ar/onp/html/presutexto/proy2009/jurent/pdf/P09J50.pdf Oficina Nacional de Presupuesto, Ministerio de Economía y Finanzas Públicas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5081">The '''National Democratic Rally''' or '''National Democratic Gathering''' ([[Arabic language|Arabic]] التجمع الوطني الديمقراطي, ''at-tajammuʻ al-waţanī ad-dīmūqrāţī'') is a banned [[Syrian opposition|opposition]] alliance in [[Syria]], comprising five [[List of political parties in Syria|political parties]] of a [[Secularism|secularist]], [[Pan-Arabism|pan-Arabist]], [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] and [[Socialism|socialist]] bent.

Hassan Ismail Abdelazim, leader of the [[Democratic Arab Socialist Union]], is the official spokesman of the Rally.

==Member parties==
The founding member parties were:&lt;ref&gt;As given in Alan George, ''Syria: Neither Bread nor Freedom'', London, Zed Books, 2003, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Democratic Arab Socialist Union]] - a splinter of the [[Arab Socialist Union (Syria)|Arab Socialist Union Party of Syria]], formerly the main [[Nasserism|Nasserist]] party in Syria.
*The [[Syrian Democratic People's Party]] - [[Riad al-Turk]]'s group, formerly called the ''Syrian Communist Party - Political Bureau'', and an offshoot of the [[Syrian Communist Party]].
*The [[Arab Revolutionary Workers Party]] - a leftist-[[Marxism|Marxist]] offshoot of the [[Ba'ath Party]] from the 1960s, which for some time had active branches in [[Lebanon]] and [[Iraq]] as well.
*The [[Arab Socialist Movement]] - an [[Arab socialism|Arab socialist]] group with roots in [[Akram al-Hawrani]]'s pre-Ba'ath [[peasant movement]].
*The [[Democratic Socialist Arab Ba'ath Party]] - a remnant of [[Salah Jadid]]'s left-wing faction of the [[Ba'ath Party]], led by his former Foreign Minister [[Brahim Makhous]].

In 2006, a sixth party joined the coalition: 
*The [[Communist Labour Party (Syria)|Communist Labour Party]] - the recreation of a hardline communist group repressed in the 1980s, which originally had its roots in 1970s Syrian student radicalism, with pro-[[Sandinista National Liberation Front|Sandinista]], [[Guevarism|Guevarist]] and [[Maoism|Maoist]] tendencies.

==History==
The National Democratic Rally was formed in January 1980 by the five member parties listed above, and its membership has not changed since. In several cases these parties were originally opposition wings of parties that had joined the governing [[National Progressive Front (Syria)|National Progressive Front]], which is a [[Left-wing nationalism|leftist nationalist]] [[Political alliance|party coalition]] established under the leadership of the [[Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party – Syria Region|Syrian Ba'ath Party]]. A few parties also had sister parties or factions in other [[Arab states]], such as [[History of Egypt under Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasserist Egypt]] or [[Ba'athist Iraq]]. Its first spokesman was [[Democratic Arab Socialist Union]] chairman [[Jamal al-Atassi]]. At his death in the year 2000, his role was inherited by his successor at the helm of DASU, Hassan Ismail Abdelazim.

The Rally took part in the opposition movement of 1980 - a period of civil protest by leftist, [[Islamism|Islamist]], [[Liberalism|liberal]] and nationalist groups which coincided with an [[Islamist uprising in Syria|armed uprising by Islamists]] in the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] and more radical factions. This led to severe repression of the Rally by the Syrian government; several of its main leaders were given long prison sentences (e.g. [[Riad al-Turk]], jailed 1980-98). The Rally was later active in the [[Damascus Spring]] of 2000, holding seminars and advocating political freedom. However, its member parties are now relatively marginal on the Syrian political scene, even if they remain an important segment of the organized opposition, due to decades of severe repression and denial of [[freedom of assembly|freedom to organize]]. Most leaders and many members are today old men, after joining or founding their respective parties in the early 1960s to late 1970s, and have had relatively poor success in appealing to younger generations of Syrians.

The '''National Vanguard''' ({{lang-it|Avanguardia Nazionale}}) is a name that has been used for at least two neo-fascist groups in [[Italy]].

==Original group==
The original National Vanguard was an extra-parliamentary movement formed as a breakaway group from the [[Italian Social Movement]] (MSI) by [[Stefano Delle Chiaie]] in 1960, initially based around a group of youths recruited by the government to break up leftist meetings.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Harris, ''The Dark Side of Europe'', Edinburgh University Press, 1994, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; The Vanguard rejected the parliamentary route of the Social Movement, preferring instead to work outside the political system to subvert [[democracy]] and bring about a return to [[fascism]]. A leaflet produced by the group described them as in favour of "man-to-man engagements" in which their members were to be encouraged to be as ruthless as possible.&lt;ref&gt;Magnus Linklater, Isabel Hilton &amp; Neal Ascherson, ''The Fourth Reich: Klaus Barbie and the Neo-Fascist Connection'', Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 1984, p. 205&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of the movement were frequently denounced as terrorists and it was claimed that Della Chiaie had links to bomb making concerns in [[Spain]]. The group also had close links with [[Ordine Nuovo]] and other extremist groups. [[Vincenzo Vinciguerra]] was a notorious member of the group. The group was adjudged responsible for a series of bomb attacks in Italy in 1969, the most notorious of which was the [[Piazza Fontana bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;Linklater, Hilton &amp; Ascherson, ''Fourth Reich'', pp. 206-207&lt;/ref&gt; The group also took a leading role in the abortive coup attempt by [[Junio Valerio Borghese]] the following year.&lt;ref&gt;Linklater, Hilton &amp; Ascherson, ''Fourth Reich'', p. 209&lt;/ref&gt;

Avanguardia Nazionale organized the assassination of Italian magistrate [[Vittorio Occorsio]], employing arms supplied by the [[CIA]] via its contacts in Francoist Spain. For the killing [[Pierluigi Concutelli]] is currently serving a life sentence in Italy. Avanguardia Nazionale member [[Mario Ricci]] participated to the 1978 assassination of [[José Miguel Beñaran Ordeñana|Argala]], the ''[[ETA (separatist group)|etarra]]'' who had taken part, five years before, in the assassination of [[Francisco Franco]]'s prime minister, [[Luis Carrero Blanco]].&lt;ref name="Mundo"&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/cronica/2003/427/1072098707.html «Yo maté al asesino de Carrero Blanco»], ''[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]'', December 21, 2003 {{es icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second group==
A second group bearing this name was set up in 1970 by [[Adriano Tilgher (politician)|Adriano Tilgher]], but this movement was outlawed by the [[Politics of Italy|Italian government]], who saw it as an attempt to refound the [[National Fascist Party]].&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;[http://www.adrianotilgher.it/biografia.html Biography from Tilgher's website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725040300/http://adrianotilgher.it/biografia.html |date=2013-07-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magazine==
A neofascist magazine entitled ''Avanguardia'' continues to be published monthly. It may claim to be the official organ of the National Vanguard, although the movement remains illegal in Italy - the official movement to which ''Avanguardia'' is connected is the ''[[Comunità Politica di Avanguardia]]'' (Political Vanguard Community).

A '''next-generation firewall''' ('''NGFW''') is a part of the third generation of firewall technology, combining a traditional [[firewall (computing)|firewall]] with other network device filtering functionalities, such as an [[application firewall]] using in-line [[deep packet inspection]] (DPI), an [[intrusion prevention system]] (IPS). Other techniques might also be employed, such as [[TLS/SSL]] encrypted traffic inspection, website filtering, QoS/[[bandwidth management]], [[antivirus software|antivirus inspection]] and third-party [[identity management]] integration (i.e. [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]], [[RADIUS]], [[Active Directory]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.esecurityplanet.com/security-buying-guides/intro-to-next-generation-firewalls.html Intro to Next Generation Firewalls] - By Eric Geier, 06 September, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

== Next-generation firewall vs. traditional firewall ==
NGFWs include the typical functions of traditional firewalls such as packet filtering,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnmeonline.com/features/next-gen-security/ Next gen security] - by Ben Rossi - 07 August, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; network- and port-address translation (NAT), stateful inspection, and [[virtual private network]] (VPN) support.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.niiconsulting.com/solutions/next-generation-firewalls.html Next Generation Firewall (NGFW)] - Network Intelligence&lt;/ref&gt; The goal of next-generation firewalls is to include more layers of the [[OSI model]], improving filtering of network traffic that is dependent on the packet contents.

NGFWs perform deeper inspection compared to [[stateful inspection]] performed by the [[firewall (computing)|first- and second-generation firewalls]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techrepublic.com/blog/it-security/next-generation-firewalls-security-without-compromising-performance/8545/ Next-generation firewalls: Security without compromising performance] - By Patrick Sweeney, 17 October 2012&lt;/ref&gt; NGFWs use a more thorough inspection style, checking packet payloads and matching signatures for harmful activities such as exploitable attacks and malware.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.networkcomputing.com/security/next-generation-firewalls-101/240149730 Next-Generation Firewalls 101] - By Frank J. Ohlhorst, 1 March 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution of next-generation firewalls ==

Improved detection of encrypted applications and intrusion prevention service. Modern threats like web-based malware attacks, targeted attacks, application-layer attacks, and more have had a significantly negative effect on the threat landscape. In fact, more than 80% of all new malware and intrusion attempts are exploiting weaknesses in applications, as opposed to weaknesses in networking components and services.

Stateful firewalls with simple packet filtering capabilities were efficient blocking unwanted applications as most applications met the port-protocol expectations. Administrators could promptly prevent an unsafe application from being accessed by users by blocking the associated ports and protocols. But today, blocking a [[web application]] like [[Farmville]] that uses port 80 by closing the port would also mean complications with the entire [[HTTP]] protocol.

Protection based on ports, protocols, IP addresses is no more reliable and viable. This has led to the development of [[identity-based security]] approach, which takes organizations a step ahead of conventional security appliances which bind security to IP-addresses.

NGFWs offer administrators a deeper awareness of and control over individual applications, along with deeper inspection capabilities by the firewall. Administrators can create very granular "allow/deny" rules for controlling use of websites and applications in the network.

The '''Olof Palme International Center''' is a Swedish non-governmental organization and the Swedish labour movement's cooperative body for international issues. The center's areas of interest include democracy, human rights and peace.

The center is named after the late Swedish [[Prime Minister of Sweden|Prime Minister]] [[Olof Palme]]. It was established in 1992 by the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]], the [[Swedish Trade Union Confederation]] and the [[Swedish Cooperative Union]]. {{As of|2018}}, the Palme Center has 27 member organizations within the Swedish labour movement.

The Palme Center works with international development co-operation in the [[Balkans]], [[Eastern Europe]], [[MENA]], [[Southeast Asia]] and southern [[Africa]]. Most projects are carried out directly by the member organisations, and are partly financed by the [[Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency]] (SIDA) through a framework agreement. The Palme Center also work with advocacy and provides information trough seminairs and reports and organize campaigns concerning international development and international relations.

The board of the Palme Center is chaired by [[Member of European Parliament]] [[Marita Ulvskog]]. The Secretary General is [[Anna Sundström]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8942">[[File:Yahoo! miserable failure.png|thumb|right|300px|Screenshot of [[Yahoo!]] search results for "Miserable Failure" in December 2008]]
During the [[2004 U.S. presidential election]], [[Google bomb]]s were used to further various political agendas. Two of the first were the "miserable failure" Google bomb linked to [[George W. Bush]]'s White House biography and the "waffles" Google bomb linked to [[John Kerry]]'s website. Supporters and detractors of the candidates were able to manipulate [[search engine]] rankings so that searches for "miserable failure" and "waffles" returned links to the targets' sites.&lt;ref name=SD&gt;[http://www.signonsandiego.com/uniontrib/20040614/news_mz1b14google.html Dropping Google Bombs], Sidener, Jonathan June 14, 2004 accessed August 9, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, [[Google]] altered its searching algorithm to make massive [[link farm]]s less effective, making search results less politically slanted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/01/quick-word-about-googlebombs.html Google Webmaster Central Blog: A quick word about Googlebombs]&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2009, President [[Barack Obama]]'s official White House web site also appeared on the first few results for "miserable failure" on Live Search and Yahoo, and on the first page of results for the word "failure" on Google. The cause of this is disputed, with some claiming it to be the result of a similar campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,485632,00.html | work=Fox News | title=Unlike Bush's 'Google Bomb,' Google Quickly Defuses Obama's | date=2009-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Others believe it to be a result of [[URL redirection]] from the old White House site (under President Bush) to the site for President Barack Obama. Because the [[HTTP 301|HTTP301 redirect]] indicates that the old page is permanently replaced by the new one, it also inherits all links to it and therefore the ranking for the same keywords.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchengineland.com/bush-fix-your-miserable-failure-legacy-16036 Bush: Fix Your "Miserable Failure" Googlebomb Legacy Before Obama Takes Office]. Searchengineland.com (2009-01-07). Retrieved on 2014-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bombing of George W. Bush==
[[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[George W. Bush]] was the subject of a variety of [[Google bomb]]s. "Miserable failure" was the first. In October 2003, an effort was launched to create links of "miserable failure" to the official White House biography of President Bush. In about six weeks, the link to George W. Bush's biography became the first result for "miserable failure" on a [[Google]] search. 

A blogger from Washington has since taken credit for starting this tactic, though the phrase had been in heavy use following its adoption as a catchphrase by the [[Dick Gephardt]] campaign.&lt;ref&gt;[http://searchenginewatch.com/showPage.html?page=3296101 Google's (and Inktomi's) Miserable Failure - Search Engine Watch&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, Bush's official biography had also become the top result for both "miserable" and "failure".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3298443.stm | work=BBC News | title='Miserable failure' links to Bush | date=2003-12-07 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bombing of John Kerry==
[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[John Kerry]] was also the target of Google bombs.  The first of these is the "waffles" Google bomb.  In April 2004, Ken Jacobson, then a [[law school]] [[student]] at [[Duquesne University]] in [[Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania|Pittsburgh]] launched the "waffles" Google bombing of Kerry, in part to retaliate for Democrats' Google bombing of George W. Bush.&lt;ref name=SD/&gt;  He encouraged linking of "waffles" to John Kerry's official site.

The term "[[waffle (disambiguation)|waffling]]" is used to describe the back and forth motion of the wings of water fowl prior to landing and is often used to describe a person who cannot decide on a particular course of action. Throughout the campaign, Kerry detractors accused him of changing his position on various issues.

==Impacts==
By creating [[Hyperlink|links]] to the official presidential biography page&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html| title=Biography of President George W. Bush| publisher=Whitehouse.gov| accessdate=2006-07-13| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060712062404/http://www.whitehouse.gov/president/gwbbio.html| archivedate=2006-07-12| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; with text reading "miserable failure", a relatively small number (possibly as few as 32) of website owners and [[blog]]gers were able to make the site appear as the first result when searching for "miserable failure".&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite news| author = [[BBC News]] |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/americas/3298443.stm| title = 'Miserable failure' links to Bush |accessdate= 2006-05-13 |date= 2003-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political blogger George Johnston of [[Old Fashioned Patriot]] claimed to be the coordinator of this particular Google bomb, which began a month after the [[Dick Gephardt]] campaign began using the catchphrase "miserable failure" to attack the administration.&lt;ref name="snopes"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, he began to encourage his visitors to participate in the "bombing". Democratic partisan e-mailing lists and blogging groups began passing the word to do similar things in the same time period.

The bomb has proliferated beyond the Google web search: "miserable failure" returns images of Bush on [[Google Images]] and Local and Maps return the "US Executive Mansion" and the White House as the first two results for "miserable failure" in [[Washington, D.C.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://local.google.com/local?q=miserable+failure&amp;near=washington+dc| title=miserable failure loc: washington dc| publisher=Google Maps| accessdate=2006-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Google's response ==
Google originally took the position that it would not alter the result (or any other Google bombed results) because it wished to preserve the integrity of its search engine.&lt;ref name="Googleblog failure"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/googlebombing-failure.html| title=Googlebombing 'failure'| publisher=Googleblog| date=2005-09-16| first=Marissa| last=Mayer| accessdate=2006-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 28, 2005, [http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/googlebombing-failure.html a Google blog] written by [[Marissa Mayer]] (Google Director of Consumer Web Products) began to appear alongside the search results; the blog explains the situation and the company's reason for not manually editing the search results.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"We don't condone the practice of googlebombing, or any other action that seeks to affect the integrity of our search results, but we're also reluctant to alter our results by hand in order to prevent such items from showing up. Pranks like this may be distracting to some, but they don't affect the overall quality of our search service, whose objectivity, as always, remains the core of our mission."&lt;ref&gt;[http://googleblog.blogspot.com/2005/09/googlebombing-failure.html Official Google Blog: Googlebombing 'failure'&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In January 2007, Google changed their indexing structure so that Google bombs such as "miserable failure" would "typically return commentary, discussions, and articles" about the tactic itself. Google announced the changes on its official blog. In response to criticism for allowing the Google bombs, [[Matt Cutts]], the head of the Google’s web spam team, said that Google bombs had "not been a very high priority for us."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/politics/bush/google.asp Urban Legends Reference Pages: Miserable Failure&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/01/29/technology/29google.html | work=The New York Times | title=Google Halts ‘Miserable Failure' Link to President Bush | first=Noam | last=Cohen | date=2007-01-29 | accessdate=2010-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"Over time, we've seen more people assume that they are Google's opinion, or that Google has hand coded the results for these Google bombed queries. That's not true, and it seemed like it was worth trying to correct that misperception."&lt;ref&gt;[http://googlewebmastercentral.blogspot.com/2007/01/quick-word-about-googlebombs.html Official Google Webmaster Central Blog: A quick word about Googlebombs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''political prisoner''' is someone [[imprisoned]] because they have opposed or criticized the government responsible for their imprisonment.

The term is used by persons or groups challenging the legitimacy of the [[internment|detention]] of a prisoner. Supporters of the term define a political prisoner as someone who is imprisoned for his or her participation in [[politics|political activity]]. If a [[political offense]] was not the official reason for the prisoner's detention, the term would imply that the detention was motivated by the prisoner's politics.

==Various definitions==
Some understand the term political prisoner narrowly, equating it with the term [[prisoner of conscience]] (POC).

===Amnesty International===
[[Amnesty International]] campaigns for the release of prisoners of conscience, which include both political prisoners as well as those imprisoned for their religious or philosophical beliefs.  To reduce controversy, and as a matter of principle, the organization's policy applies only to prisoners who have not committed or advocated violence. Thus, there are political prisoners who do not fit the narrower criteria for POCs. The organisation defines the differences as follows:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnesty-volunteer.org/aihandbook/ch3.html#Politicalprisoners "AI's FOCUS"]. Amnesty International. Retrieved April 5, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
AI uses the term "political prisoner" broadly. It does not use it, as some others do, to imply that all such prisoners have a special status or should be released. It uses the term only to define a category of prisoners for whom AI demands a fair and prompt trial.

In AI's usage, the term includes any prisoner whose case has a significant political element: whether the motivation of the prisoner's acts, the acts in themselves, or the motivation of the authorities.

"Political" is used by AI to refer to aspects of human relations related to "politics": the mechanisms of society and civil order, the principles, organization, or conduct of government or public affairs, and the relation of all these to questions of language, ethnic origin, sex or religion, status or influence (among other factors).

The category of political prisoners embraces the category of [[prisoners of conscience]], the only prisoners who AI demands should be immediately and unconditionally released, as well as people who resort to criminal violence for a political motive.

In AI's use of the term, here are some examples of political prisoners:
* a person accused or convicted of an ordinary crime carried out for political motives, such as murder or robbery carried out to support the objectives of an opposition group;
* a person accused or convicted of an ordinary crime committed in a political context, such as at a demonstration by a trade union or a peasants' organization;
* a member or suspected member of an armed opposition group who has been charged with treason or "subversion".

Governments often say they have no political prisoners, only prisoners held under the normal criminal law. AI however describes cases like the examples given above as "political" and uses the terms "political trial" and "political imprisonment" when referring to them. But by doing so AI does not oppose the imprisonment, except where it further maintains that the prisoner is a prisoner of conscience, or condemn the trial, except where it concludes that it was unfair.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe===
The [[Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe]] has a much tighter definition:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
A person deprived of his or her personal liberty is to be regarded as a 'political prisoner':
{{ordered list|type=lower-alpha
|if the detention has been imposed in violation of one of the fundamental guarantees set out in the [[European Convention on Human Rights]] and its Protocols, in particular freedom of thought, conscience and religion, freedom of expression and information, freedom of assembly and association;
|if the detention has been imposed for purely political reasons without connection to any offence;
|if, for political motives, the length of the detention or its conditions are clearly out of proportion to the offence the person has been found guilty of or is suspected of;
|if, for political motives, he or she is detained in a discriminatory manner as compared to other persons; or,
|if the detention is the result of proceedings which were clearly unfair and this appears to be connected with political motives of the authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The definition of political prisoner|url = http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-DocDetails-EN.asp?fileid=19150&amp;lang=EN|accessdate = 2015-11-23|date = 3 October 2012|publisher = Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Other definitions===
In the parlance of many political movements that utilize [[armed resistance]], [[guerrilla warfare]], and other forms of political violence, a political prisoner includes people who are imprisoned because they are awaiting trial for, or have been convicted of, actions which states they oppose describe as (accurately or otherwise) [[terrorism]]. These movements may consider the actions of political prisoners morally justified against some system of governance, may claim innocence, or have varying understandings of what types of violence are morally and ethically justified. For instance, French [[Anarchism|anarchist]] groups typically call the former members of [[Action Directe (gang)|Action Directe]] held in [[France]] political prisoners. While the French government deemed Action Directe illegal, the group fashioned itself as an [[urban guerilla]] movement, claiming a legitimate [[armed struggle]]. In this sense, "political prisoner" can be used to describe any politically active prisoner who is held in custody for a [[Freedom Fighter|violent action which supporters deem ethically justified]].

Some libertarians (such as those who agree with the arguments of Lysander Spooner&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lysanderspooner.org/works/] Lysander Spooner, "The Constitution of No Authority," Vols 1,2, and 6. 1867–1870&lt;/ref&gt;) also include all convicted for [[treason]] and some convicted of [[espionage]] in the category of political prisoners. Currently, there is still much controversy and debate around how to define this term and which cases to include or exclude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Prof. Tatiana Burudjieva |url=http://www.europost.bg/article?id=4878 |title=Who can be defined as political prisoner |publisher=Europost.bg |date= |accessdate=2013-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political prisoners can also be imprisoned with no legal veneer by [[Extrajudicial punishment|extrajudicial processes]]. Some political prisoners need not be imprisoned at all. Supporters of [[Gedhun Choekyi Nyima]] in the [[11th Panchen Lama controversy]] have called him a "political prisoner", despite the fact that he is not accused of a political offense. He is held under secluded [[house arrest]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/4551425.stm | work=BBC News | title=Tibet's missing spiritual guide | date=May 16, 2005 | accessdate=May 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Political prisoners are also arrested and tried with a veneer of [[legal process|legality]] where false [[Criminal law|criminal]] [[indictment|charges]], [[Falsified evidence|manufactured evidence]], and unfair trials ([[kangaroo court]]s, [[show trial]]s) are used to disguise the fact that an individual is a political prisoner. This is common in situations which may otherwise be decried nationally and internationally as a [[human rights]] violation or suppression of a [[political dissident]].  A political prisoner can also be someone that has been denied [[bail]] unfairly, denied [[parole]] when it would reasonably have been given to a prisoner charged with a comparable crime, or special powers may be invoked by the judiciary. Particularly in this latter situation, whether an individual is regarded as a political prisoner may depend upon subjective political perspective or interpretation of the evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxfordburmaalliance.org/uploads/9/1/8/4/9184764/the_recognition_of_political_prisoners_essential_to_democratic_and_national_reconciliation_process.pdf| work=Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (Burma) | title=The recognition of political prisoners: essential to democratic and national reconciliation process|date=November 9, 2011| accessdate=August 20, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- This entire section lacks cites.

==History==

===Background: 1923–68===
Prior to the inception of the Research and Analysis Wing, overseas intelligence collection was primarily the responsibility of the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]] (IB), which was created by the British. In 1933, sensing the political turmoil in the world which eventually led to the [[Second World War]], the Intelligence Bureau's responsibilities were increased to include the collection of [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] along India's borders.

In 1947, after [[History of India#The Indian independence movement|independence]], Sanjeevi Pillai took over as the first Indian Director of the IB. Having been depleted of trained manpower by the exit of the British, Pillai tried to run the bureau on [[MI5]] lines. In 1949, Pillai organised a small foreign intelligence operation, but the Indian debacle in the [[Sino-Indian war]] of 1962 showed it to be ineffective. Foreign intelligence failure during the 1962 [[Sino-Indian War]] led then Prime Minister [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] to order a dedicated foreign intelligence agency to be established.&lt;ref name="FAsummary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity"/&gt; After the [[Indo-Pakistani war of 1965]], Indian [[Chief of Army Staff of the Indian Army|Chief of Army Staff]] General [[Joyanto Nath Chaudhuri]] also called for more intelligence-gathering.&lt;ref name="FAsummary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists"/&gt; Around the end of 1966 the concept of a separate foreign intelligence agency began to take concrete shape.

===RAW: 1968–present===
The [[Indira Gandhi]] administration decided that a full-fledged second security service was needed. [[R. N. Kao]], then a deputy director of the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]], submitted a blueprint for the new agency.&lt;ref name="SunilSaini_RNKao"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/MONITOR/ISSUE4-5/sainis.html |title=Obituary:Rameshwar Nath Kao (1918–2002) |last=Sainis |first=Sunil |date=March–April 2002 |work=Volume 4(5) |publisher=Bharat Rakshak Monitor |accessdate=28 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090520170101/http://www.bharat-rakshak.com/MONITOR/ISSUE4-5/sainis.html |archivedate=20 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kao was appointed as the chief of India's first foreign intelligence agency, the Research and Analysis Wing.&lt;ref name="ijic"&gt;{{Cite journal |url= http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/08850607.2015.992754 |title= Unraveling India's Foreign Intelligence: The Origins and Evolution of the Research and Analysis Wing |last= Shaffer |first= Ryan |year= 2015 |volume= 28 |issue= 2 |work= International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence |accessdate= 28 September 2015 |doi= 10.1080/08850607.2015.992754 |pages= 252–289 |deadurl= no |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140814175215/http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/Foreign-baddies-muscle-into-Tamil-cinema/2013/09/01/article1757724.ece |archivedate= 14 August 2014 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|259}} The R&amp;AW was given the responsibility for strategic external intelligence, human as well as technical, plus concurrent responsibility with the Directorate-General of Military Intelligence for tactical trans-border military intelligence up to a certain depth across the [[Line of control]] (LOC) and the international border.&lt;ref name="FAsummary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity"/&gt;

[[File:Indian intelligence setup.gif|thumb|299x299px|The framework of Indian intelligence]]
R&amp;AW started as a wing of the main Intelligence Bureau with 250 employees and an annual budget of {{INRConvert|20|m|1}}. In the early seventies, its annual budget had risen to {{INRConvert|300|m|1}} while its personnel numbered several thousand. In 1971, Kao had persuaded the Government to set up the [[Aviation Research Centre]] (ARC). The ARC's job was [[reconnaissance|aerial reconnaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/Intelligence-agencies-run-into-babu-bind/2013/04/28/article1564632.ece1|title=Intelligence agencies run into babu bind|last=Yadav|first=Yatish|date=28 April 2013|work=The Sunday Standard|accessdate=21 May 2013|location=New Delhi|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130704132333/http://newindianexpress.com/thesundaystandard/Intelligence-agencies-run-into-babu-bind/2013/04/28/article1564632.ece1|archivedate=4 July 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vayu-sena.tripod.com/other-cia-tibet-conboy.html |title=The CIA's Secret War in Tibet |publisher=Vayu-sena.tripod.com |accessdate=28 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100314015254/http://vayu-sena.tripod.com/other-cia-tibet-conboy.html |archivedate=14 March 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It replaced the Indian Air Force's old reconnaissance aircraft and by the mid-1970s, R&amp;AW, through the ARC, had high quality aerial pictures of the installations along the Chinese and Pakistani borders.

Slowly other child agencies such as [[The Radio Research Center]] and [[The Electronics and Technical Services|Electronics &amp; Tech. Services]] were added to R&amp;AW in the 1970s and 1990s. In the 1970s the [[Special Frontier Force]] moved to R&amp;AW's control, working to train Bengali rebels.&lt;ref name="ijic"/&gt;{{rp|262}} In 1977, R&amp;AW's operations and staff were dramatically cut under the [[Premiership of Morarji Desai]], which hurt the organization's capabilities&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =  | first1 = | title = Significant Distrust and Drastic Cuts: The Indian Government’s Uneasy Relationship with Intelligence | doi = 10.1080/08850607.2017.1263529 | journal = International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence | volume = 30 | issue = 3 | pages = 522–531  | year = 2017 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; with the shutting of entire sections of R&amp;AW, like its Information Division.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 =  | first1 = | title = Indian intelligence revealed: an examination of operations, failures and transformations | doi = 10.1080/02684527.2017.1327135 | journal = Intelligence and National Security | volume = 32 | issue = | pages =  | year = 2017 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; These cuts were reduced following Gandhi's return.

In 2004 Government of India added yet another signal intelligence agency called the [[National Technical Facilities Organisation]] (NTFO), which was later renamed as National Technical Research Organisation (NTRO). While the exact nature of the operations conducted by NTRO is classified, it is believed that it deals with research on imagery and communications using various platforms.&lt;ref name="FAsummary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists"/&gt;

The [[Joint Intelligence Committee (India)|Joint Intelligence Committee]] (JIC), under the [[Cabinet Secretariat of India|Cabinet Secretariat]], is responsible for coordinating and analysing intelligence activities between R&amp;AW, the Intelligence Bureau and the [[Defence Intelligence Agency (India)|Defence Intelligence Agency]] (DIA). In practice, however, the effectiveness of the JIC has been varied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Dixit | first1 = J. N.

* Monitoring the political, military, economic and scientific developments in countries which have a direct bearing on India's national security and the formulation of its foreign policy.
* Moulding international public opinion and influence foreign governments with the help of the strong and vibrant [[Non-resident Indian and person of Indian origin|Indian diaspora]].
* Covert Operations to safe guard India's National interests.
* Anti – Terror Operations and neutralising terror elements posing a threat to India.

In the past, following the [[Sino-Indian war]] of 1962 and due to India's volatile relations with Pakistan, R&amp;AW's objectives had also consisted the following:
* To watch the development of international communism and the schism between the two big communist nations, the [[Soviet Union]] and China. As with other countries, both these powers had direct access to the communist parties in India.
* To control and limit the supply of military hardware to Pakistan, from mostly European countries, America and more importantly from China.&lt;ref name="FAsummary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists"/&gt;

The internal structure of the R&amp;AW is a matter of speculation, but brief overviews of the same are present in the public domain. Attached to the Headquarters of R&amp;AW at [[Lodhi Road]], New Delhi are different regional headquarters, which have direct links to overseas stations and are headed by a controlling officer who keeps records of different projects assigned to field officers who are posted abroad. Intelligence is usually collected from a variety of sources by field officers and deputy field officers; it is either preprocessed by a senior field officer or by a desk officer. The desk officer then passes the information to the [[Joint Secretary to Government of India|Joint Secretary]] and then on to the [[Additional Secretary to Government of India|Additional Secretary]] and from there it is disseminated to the concerned end user. R&amp;AW personnel are called "Research Officers" instead of the traditional "agents". There is a sizeable number of female officers in R&amp;AW even at the operational level. In recent years, R&amp;AW has shifted its primary focus from [[Pakistan]] to China and have started operating a separate desk for this purpose.&lt;ref name="fas"/&gt;

==Recruitment==
Initially, R&amp;AW relied primarily on trained [[intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] officers who were recruited directly. These belonged to the external wing of the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau]]. In times of great expansion, many candidates were taken from the [[Indian Armed Forces]], [[Indian Police Service|Police]]([[Indian Police Service|IPS]]) and the Officers of [[Indian Revenue Service]] ([[Indian Revenue Service|IRS]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/raw-chief-briefs-pm-warns-of-action-against-woman-who-complained/351975/|title=RAW chief briefs PM, warns of action against woman who complained|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=25 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160413174217/http://archive.indianexpress.com/news/raw-chief-briefs-pm-warns-of-action-against-woman-who-complained/351975/|archivedate=13 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080703/jsp/careergraph/story_9494253.jsp|title=The Telegraph – Calcutta (Kolkata) – Careergraph – RAW IS RIPE|work=The Telegraph|location=Kolkota|accessdate=25 March 2016|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304071009/http://www.telegraphindia.com/1080703/jsp/careergraph/story_9494253.jsp|archivedate=4 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;Later, R&amp;AW began directly recruiting graduates from universities. However owing to allegations of nepotism in appointments,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=IDSA|first=|title=A case for intelligence reforms in India|url=http://www.idsa.in/system/files/book_IntellegenceReform.pdf|year=2012|publisher=IDSA|isbn=978-93-82169-03-1|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131013204746/http://idsa.in/system/files/book_IntellegenceReform.pdf|archivedate=13 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1983 R&amp;AW created its own service cadre, the Research and Analysis Service (RAS) to absorb talent from other Group A Civil Services, under the Central Staffing Scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.idsa.in/askanexpert/HowaboutawebsiteforRAWandcanwerecruitmorepeoplefromoutsideUPSCroute |title=Bharath asked: How about a website for RAW and can we recruit more people from outside UPSC route? we got to change &amp;#124; Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses |publisher=Idsa.in |accessdate=28 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120418162522/http://www.idsa.in/askanexpert/HowaboutawebsiteforRAWandcanwerecruitmorepeoplefromoutsideUPSCroute |archivedate=18 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Direct recruitment at Class I executive level is from Civil services officers undergoing Foundation course at [[Lal Bahadur Shastri National Academy of Administration]]. At the end of the course, R&amp;AW conducts a campus interview. Based on a selection of psychological tests and the interview, candidates are inducted into R&amp;AW for a lien period of one year. During this period, they have an option of rejoining their parent service (if they wish to) after which they can be permanently absorbed into the Research and Analysis Service. Delhi-based security think tank Institute for Defence Studies and Analyses noted in one of its reports that R&amp;AW suffered from the 'tail-end syndrome' where the 'bottom of the entrance lists' of those qualifying the [[Union Public Service Commission|UPSC examinations]] were offered jobs.&lt;ref name="outlookindia.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://outlookindia.com/article.aspx?270538 |title=Ghosts Who Walk &amp;#124; Saikat Datta |publisher=Outlookindia.com |accessdate=28 May 2012 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407172251/http://www.outlookindia.com/article.aspx?270538 |archivedate=7 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, recruitment is also by lateral deputation from the Officer corps of Armed Forces or Group A Civil Service Officers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davp.nic.in/WriteReadData/ADS/eng_58101_6_1213b.pdf Advertisement for position in Cabinet Secretariat by [[Directorate of Advertising and Visual Publicity]] dated 19 August 2013] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140325190918/http://www.davp.nic.in/WriteReadData/ADS/eng_58101_6_1213b.pdf |date=25 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Civil and Defence Service Officers permanently resign their cadre and join the RAS.&lt;ref name="Memorandum for lateral induction into RAS"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dop.rajasthan.gov.in/Uploadfiles/1932012_13248_Nomination%20of%20IFS%20for%20lateral%20Induction%20to%20the%20RAS.pdf |title=Memorandum for lateral induction into RAS |date=24 February 2012 |accessdate=11 September 2013 |author=Cabinet Secretariat |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120609223638/http://www.dop.rajasthan.gov.in/Uploadfiles/1932012_13248_Nomination%20of%20IFS%20for%20lateral%20Induction%20to%20the%20RAS.pdf |archivedate=9 June 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to recent reports, officers can return to their parent cadre after serving a specific period in the agency if they wish to.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/aug/27raw.htm |title=Soon, a beefier, meaner, deadlier RAW |publisher=Rediff.com |accessdate=28 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091008101430/http://www.rediff.com/news/2006/aug/27raw.htm |archivedate=8 October 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the [[Secretary to Government of India|secretaries]] have been officers from the [[Indian Police Service|IPS]] and other posts are held by [[Indian Revenue Service|IRS]] and [[Indian Foreign Service|IFS]] officers.

===Training===
;Basic training
Basic training commences with 'pep talks' to boost the morale of the new recruit. This is a ten-day phase in which the inductee is familiarised with the real world of intelligence and espionage, as opposed to the spies of fiction. Common usages, tradecraft techniques and classification of information are taught. Financial and economic analysis, Space Technology, Information Security, Energy Security and Scientific knowledge is imbibed to the trainees. The recruit is made to specialise in a foreign language and introduced to Geo strategic analysis. Case studies of other agencies like [[CIA]], [[KGB]], [[Inter-Services Intelligence|ISI]], [[Mossad]] and [[Secret Intelligence Service|MI6]] are presented for study. The inductee is also taught that intelligence organisations do not identify who is friend and who is foe, the country's foreign policy does. Basic classroom training in tactics and language are imparted to R&amp;AW officers at the residential Training and Language Institute in [[Gurgaon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.headlinesindia.com/defence-news/army/raw-officer-attempts-suicide-outside-pmo-531.html |title=RAW officer attempts suicide at PMO |publisher=Headlinesindia.com |accessdate=28 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090113073046/http://www.headlinesindia.com/defence-news/army/raw-officer-attempts-suicide-outside-pmo-531.html |archivedate=13 January 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.defencejournal.com/feb-mar99/raw-at-war.htm |title=Raw at War-Genesis of Secret Agencies in Ancient India |publisher=Defencejournal.com |accessdate=28 September 2009 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090502180923/http://www.defencejournal.com/feb-mar99/raw-at-war.htm |archivedate=2 May 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/to-bridge-language-gap-raw-ropes-in-native-linguists-as-gurus/|title=To bridge language gap, R&amp;AW ropes in native linguists as 'gurus'|last=Sarin|first=Ritu|date=4 February 2014|work=The Indian Express|accessdate=23 February 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140301085823/http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-others/to-bridge-language-gap-raw-ropes-in-native-linguists-as-gurus/|archivedate=1 March 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A multi-disciplinary school of economic intelligence is also being set up in Mumbai to train intelligence officers in investigating economic crimes like money laundering for terror purposes etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Soon-training-school-for-secret-agents-in-Mumbai/articleshow/9253591.cms | work=The Times of India | title=Soon, training school for secret agents in Mumbai | date=17 July 2011 | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110717231320/http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Soon-training-school-for-secret-agents-in-Mumbai/articleshow/9253591.cms | archivedate=17 July 2011 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Advanced training
After completing 'Basic Training' the recruit is now attached to a Field Intelligence Bureau (FIB). His/her training here lasts for 1–2 years. He/she is given firsthand experience of what it was to be out in the figurative cold, conducting clandestine operations. During night exercises under realistic conditions, he/she is taught [[infiltration tactics|infiltration]] and [[exfil]]tration. He/she is instructed to avoid capture and if caught, how to face [[interrogation]]. He/she learns the art of reconnoitre, making contacts, and, the numerous skills of operating an intelligence mission. At the end of the field training, the new recruit is brought back to the school for final polishing. Before his deployment in the field, he/she is given exhaustive training in the art of [[self-defence]] mainly [[Krav Maga]], and the use of technical espionage devices. He/she is also drilled in various administrative disciplines so that he could take his place in the foreign missions without arousing suspicion. He/she is now ready to operate under the cover of an Embassy to gather information, set up his own network of informers, [[mole (espionage)|moles]] or operatives as the task may require. Field training is provided in the [[Indian Military Academy]] Headquarters at [[Dehradun]].&lt;ref name="Globalsecurity"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Open Secrets: India's Intelligence Unveiled"- Maloy Krishna Dhar. He was the joint director of IB.&lt;/ref&gt; The training model has been criticised as being 'archaic and too police-centric' and not  incorporating 'modern technological advances in methods of communication' etc.

Activities and functions of R&amp;AW are highly confidential and declassification of past operations are uncommon unlike agencies like CIA, MI6 and Mossad who have many of their activities declassified. The [[Secretary to Government of India|Secretary]] (R) reported to the [[Vohra Report|Vohra Committee]] that R&amp;AW offices abroad have limited strength and are largely geared to the collection of [[military intelligence|military]], [[Business intelligence|economic]], [[Industrial espionage|scientific]], and [[Machiavellian intelligence|political intelligence]]. R&amp;AW monitors the activities of certain organisations abroad only insofar as they relate to their involvement with [[Narcoterrorism|narco terrorist]] elements and [[smuggling]] arms, ammunition, explosives, etc. into India.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mahendra-agarwalonline.20m.com/PR_VohraCommitteeReport.htm Vohra Committee Report] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080106221625/http://mahendra-agarwalonline.20m.com/PR_VohraCommitteeReport.htm |date=6 January 2008 }}. Retrieved 14 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt; It does not monitor the activities of criminal elements abroad, which are mainly confined to normal smuggling without any links to terrorist elements. However, if there is evidence to suggest that certain organisations have links with Intelligence agencies of other countries, and that they are being used or are likely to be used by such countries for destabilising India's economy, it would become R&amp;AW's responsibility to monitor their activities.&lt;ref name="FAsummary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists"/&gt;

The primary mission of R&amp;AW includes aggressive intelligence collection via espionage, [[psychological warfare]], [[subversion (politics)|subversion]], [[sabotage]], and [[assassinations]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1868769/report-why-does-india-dither-on-bringing-dawood-to-justice|title=Why does India dither on bringing Dawood to justice?|last=Balakrishnan|first=S|date=2 August 2013|work=DNA|accessdate=19 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130824045926/http://www.dnaindia.com/india/1868769/report-why-does-india-dither-on-bringing-dawood-to-justice|archivedate=24 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; R&amp;AW maintains active collaboration with other secret services in various countries. Its contacts with [[FSB (Russia)|FSB]] of Russia, [[National Directorate of Security|NDS]], the Afghan agency, [[Israel]]'s [[Mossad]], the [[CIA]] and [[MI6]] have been well-known, a common interest being Pakistan's [[Pakistan and weapons of mass destruction|nuclear programme]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/disproportionate-case-mossad-r-k--yadav-anand-kumar-verma/1/258012.html|title=A House for Mossad|last=Unnithan|first=Sandeep|date=25 March 2013|work=India Today|accessdate=19 August 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130817025432/http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/disproportionate-case-mossad-r-k--yadav-anand-kumar-verma/1/258012.html|archivedate=17 August 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; R&amp;AW has been active in obtaining information and operating through third countries like [[Afghanistan]], the United Kingdom, Hong Kong, [[Myanmar]] and Singapore.&lt;ref name="FAsummary"/&gt;

R&amp;AW obtains information critical to Indian strategic interests both by overt and covert means. The data is then classified and filed with the assistance of the computer networks. International business houses, information technology sector and media centres can easily absorb R&amp;AW operatives and provide freedom of movement.&lt;ref name="FAsummary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists"/&gt; A task force report prepared by a New Delhi-based security think tank highlighted that R&amp;AW operatives have inadequate non-official cover for overseas operations which 'limits access to spot real targets' and causes issues on handling 'high-value assets'.&lt;ref name="outlookindia.com"/&gt;

So, the [[CIA]] in the late 1960s decided to launch an [[ELINT]] operation along with RAW and [[Aviation Research Centre|ARC]] to track China's nuclear tests and monitor its missile launches. The operation, in the garb of a mountaineering expedition to [[Nanda Devi]] involved celebrated Indian climber [[M S Kohli]] who along with operatives of [[Special Frontier Force]] and the [[CIA]] – most notably Jim Rhyne, a veteran [[STOL]] pilot – was to place a permanent [[ELINT]] device, a transceiver powered by a plutonium battery, that could detect and report data on future nuclear tests carried out by China.&lt;ref&gt;Spies in the Himalayas, by Kenneth Conboy and M.S.

RAW also targeted an ISI safe house in the capital city Dhaka, bringing down the entire building. The operation helped the Indian security establishment to put a lid on the radical organisation’s infiltration into India for the time being.

* '''[[Operation Leech]]:''' Surrounded by [[Rakhine people|Arakanese]] and dense forest, [[Myanmar]] had always been a worrisome point for Indian intelligence. India has sought to promote democracy and install friendly governments in the region. To these ends, RAW cultivated Burmese rebel groups and pro-democracy coalitions, especially the [[Kachin Independence Army]] (KIA). India allowed the KIA to carry a limited trade in [[jade]] and precious stones using Indian territory and even supplied them weapons. It is further alleged that KIA chief [[Maran Brang Seng]] met the RAW chief in Delhi twice. However, when the KIA became the main source of training and weapons for all northeastern rebel groups, R&amp;AW initiated an operation, code named ''Operation Leech'', to assassinate the leaders of the Burmese rebels as an example to other groups. in 1998, six top rebel leaders, including military wing chief of National Unity Party of Arakans (NUPA), Khaing Raza, were shot dead and 34 Arakanese guerrillas were arrested and charged with gunrunning.&lt;ref name="Federation of American Scientists"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.india-seminar.com/2005/550/550%20subir%20bhaumik.htm Guns, drugs and rebels] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090923193152/http://www.india-seminar.com/2005/550/550%20subir%20bhaumik.htm |date=23 September 2009 }}.

Maps and photographs of terrorist training camps in Afghanistan and Pakistan along with other evidence implicating Osama bin Laden in terrorist attacks were given to US intelligence officials. RAW's role in the War on Terror may increase as US intelligence has indicated that it sees RAW as a more reliable ally than Pakistani intelligence.

There had been growing concern in the Indian government, on the increasing influence of economic and military rival China in Sri Lankan affairs.

Fears arose that it could turn into the [[KGB]] of India. Such fears were kept at bay by the R&amp;AW's able leadership (although detractors of R&amp;AW and especially the [[Janata Party]] have accused the agency of letting itself be used for terrorising and intimidating opposition during [[The Emergency (India)|the 1975–1977 Emergency]]). The main controversy which has plagued R&amp;AW in recent years is over bureaucratisation of the system with allegations about favouritism in promotions, corruption, ego clashes, no financial accountability,&lt;ref name="outlookindia.com"/&gt; inter-departmental rivalry, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Watch |first=Naxal |url=http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2009/02/special-report-new-era-new-hope-at.html |title=IntelliBriefs: Special report: New Era, New Hope at India's Intelligence Agency |publisher=Intellibriefs.blogspot.com |date=15 February 2009 |accessdate=4 March 2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100205090738/http://intellibriefs.blogspot.com/2009/02/special-report-new-era-new-hope-at.html |archivedate=5 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;C K Kutty.

* In the edition of 8 February 2010 ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook Magazine]]'' reported on former R&amp;AW Chief, [[Ashok Chaturvedi]], using [[Government of India]] funds to take his wife along on international trips. After retirement, Chaturvedi had a diplomatic passport issued for himself and his wife. Per ''[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook Magazine]]'': "Only grade 'A' ambassadors—usually IFS officers posted in key countries like the UK and US—are allowed to hold diplomatic passports after retirement. The majority, who do not fit that bill, hold passports issued to ordinary citizens. In fact, all former R&amp;AW chiefs Outlook spoke to confirmed they had surrendered their diplomatic passports the day they retired.

India's External Intelligence: Secrets of Research and Analysis Wing (RAW). New Delhi: Manas Publications.

==In popular culture==
Unlike in the Western cultural sphere, which has portrayed its foreign intelligence agencies (such as the [[CIA]] and [[MI6]]) in different media forms, Indian authors and actors have been shy to explore the area of espionage, especially R&amp;AW, until the 1990s. Unlike [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]], the federal investigative agency of [[India]], whose existence is known to the majority of people, R&amp;AW receives little to no attention from the populace, which seems to be unaware of the existence of such an organisation or even India's internal intelligence agency, the [[Intelligence Bureau (India)|Intelligence Bureau (IB)]]. Excessive secrecy surrounding activities and rare declassification of the information are considered to be the major reasons behind this.

The [[Television in India|thriving entertainment]] channels in India have started to tap into the theme of Intelligence agencies. ''2612'' which used to air on [[Life OK]], featured Cabir Maira as a R&amp;AW agent Anand Swami who helps a STF officer Randeep Rathore to save the country from a terrorist attack. ''Time Bomb 9/11'', a series aired on [[Zee TV]], featured [[Rajeev Khandelwal]] in the role of a R&amp;AW field officer who attempts to defuse a nuclear bomb set in India, as well as saving the life of the Indian prime minister. [[Zee Bangla]] featured a serial named ''Mohona'' where the chief protagonist is a R&amp;AW officer. ''Sajda Tere Pyar Mein'' a series on [[Star Plus]], features [[Shaleen Bhanot]] in the role of a R&amp;AW officer who asks a young woman named Aliya for help in catching a spy named Mahendra Pratap. The Indian version of ''[[24 (Indian TV series)|24]]'' has a host of characters affiliated to R&amp;AW. The 2018 webseries ''[[Sacred Games (TV series)|Sacred Games]]'' has a RAW agent played by [[Radhika Apte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.firstpost.com/entertainment/sacred-games-radhika-apte-on-playing-a-raw-agent-the-freedom-that-comes-with-a-netflix-series-4716311.html|title=Sacred Games: Radhika Apte on playing a RAW agent, the freedom that comes with a Netflix series- Entertainment News, Firstpost|work=Firstpost|access-date=2018-11-09|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some academic commentators have linked the increasing surfeit of Indian films and TV series on espionage thriller genre, where an Indian hero staves off impending global catastrophe, as a marker of an aspirational ''[[Indian Century|Pax Indica]]'' not based on 'older paradigms of [[Internationalism (politics)|internationalism]] based on universal brotherhood and non-violent pacifism associated with [[Gandhi]] and [[Nehru]]' but on the motif of an increasingly assertive [[India as a rising superpower|potential superpower]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Maderya|first1=Kumuthan|title=The Myth of the Global Brown Messiah in Kollywood Cinema|url=http://www.popmatters.com/column/183252-the-myth-of-the-global-brown-messiah-in-kollywood-cinema/P2/|website=PopMatters|accessdate=7 August 2014|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924080107/http://www.popmatters.com/column/183252-the-myth-of-the-global-brown-messiah-in-kollywood-cinema/P2/|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sampath|first1=Jananai|title=Foreign baddies muscle into Tamil cinema|url=http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/Foreign-baddies-muscle-into-Tamil-cinema/2013/09/01/article1757724.ece|accessdate=7 August 2014|work=The New Indian Express|date=1 September 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140814175215/http://www.newindianexpress.com/entertainment/tamil/Foreign-baddies-muscle-into-Tamil-cinema/2013/09/01/article1757724.ece|archivedate=14 August 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Socialism sidebar|expanded=}} 
{{Social democracy sidebar|expanded=Organizations}}
With its foundation in October 1888, the Social Democratic Party was considered to be the main opposition to the Radicals in government and parliament. After the unsuccessful [[general strike]] in 1918, proportional representation was introduced which helped the SP gain 41 seats in parliament.&lt;ref name="swissinfo1"&gt;[http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Social_Democratic_Party.html?cid=371956 Social Democratic Party]. swissinfo.ch (2007-11-30). Retrieved on 2013-09-07.&lt;/ref&gt; The party was a member of the [[Labour and Socialist International]] between 1927 and 1940.&lt;ref&gt;Kowalski, Werner. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=83QdPwAACAAJ Geschichte der sozialistischen arbeiter-internationale: 1923 - 19]''. Berlin: Dt. Verl. d. Wissenschaften, 1985. p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; After the strike the party took a softer line and in 1943 it became the strongest party in parliament, finally gaining a seat in the Federal Council. It picked up a second seat in 1959.&lt;ref name="swissinfo1"/&gt; The party's historical archives is today hosted by the [[Swiss Social Archives]].

[[File:Swiss party politics 2007 en.png|thumb|300px|The SP's positions in the Swiss political spectrum (2007)]]
The SP supports classical [[Social democracy|social democratic]] policies. To that rule, the SP stands for a  government offering strong [[public services]]. The SP is against far-reaching [[economic liberalism]], in favor of [[social progressivism]], [[environmental policy]] with [[climate change mitigation]], for an open foreign policy, and a national security policy based on [[pacifism]].

In economic, financial, and social [[welfare]] policy, the SP rejects policies of [[economic liberalization]] such as [[deregulation]], lowering taxes for high-income citizens, and decreases in [[government spending]] on [[social insurance]]. The SP also opposes raising the retirement age. In addition, the SP is a proponent of increasing welfare spending in some areas such as for a publicly financed [[Parental leave|maternity leave]], [[universal health care]] and a flexible retirement age. In tax policy the SP opposes the notion of lowering taxes for high-income citizens. By campaigning for the harmonisation of all tax rates in Switzerland, the SP seeks more [[redistribution (economics)|redistribution]]. The SP is skeptical toward the [[privatization]] of [[State ownership|state enterprises]]. Nonetheless, the SP also promotes more [[competition (economics)|competition]] in the areas of agriculture and [[parallel imports]].

In social policy, the SP is committed to social equity and an [[open society]]. Thus, the SP aims at making working conditions for women in families easier by promoting more external childcare centers and more opportunities for [[part-time]] jobs. It also aims at reinforcing sexual equality in terms of eliminating wage differences based on gender, supports [[civil union]] for [[homosexuality|homosexuals]] and takes an easier stance toward abortions. The SP also rejects strengthening restrictions on asylum seekers and immigrants. Thus, it supports the integration of immigrants by which the immigrants are assigned to immigration procedures immediately after entering the country. The SP has a liberal stance toward drugs and is in favor of publicly regulated heroin consumption and the legalization of [[cannabis (drug)|cannabis]]. Nevertheless, the SP supports the [[smoking ban]] in restaurants and bars.

In foreign policy the SP promotes further participation by Switzerland in international organizations. It supports immediate entry of Switzerland into the [[European Union]]. The SP also stands for a less strict neutrality of Switzerland, and supports increased international efforts on the part of Switzerland in the areas of peace and human rights. However, the SP supports keeping the military neutrality and opposes entry into [[NATO]]. Its pacifist stance is also reflected in its military policy: The SP supports reducing the number of Swiss militia while making the military apparatus more professional and scrapping [[conscription in Switzerland|conscription]]. Another demand of the SP is to end the tradition of [[Gun politics in Switzerland|gun ownership]], using severe and recent examples of abuse in terms of murder as proof.

Together with the [[Green Party of Switzerland]], the Social Democrats have common [[environmentalism|environmentalist]] policies, which are reflected in the expansion of [[ecotax]] reforms and increased state support for energy saving measures and [[renewable energy|renewable energies]]. The SP is against the construction of new roads where possible and instead proposes to shift the transportation of goods from the roads to the railways and the introduction of a cap and trade and traffic management system when it comes to transportation across the Swiss [[Alps]]. Furthermore, the SP stands for an expansion of the public transportation system network and opposes [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]].

==Popular support==
[[File:CHbezirke 110211 SP.png|thumb|300px|Percentages of the SP at district level in 2011]]
[[File:Switzerland largest parties in cantonal parliaments.svg|thumb|300px|Strongest in urban areas, the Social Democrats' support is spread across the country as they hold a quarter of seats in cantonal parliaments, but are the largest party in only one, [[Basel-Stadt]] (coloured red above)]]
In 2003, it held 52 mandates (out of 200) in the [[Swiss National Council]] (first chamber of the Swiss parliament); 9 (out of 46) in the second chamber and 2 out of 7 mandates in the [[Swiss Federal Council]] (executive body). By 2005, it held 23.8% of the seats in the Swiss [[Cantonal governments]] and 23.2% in the Swiss [[Cantonal parliaments]] (index "BADAC", weighted with the population and number of seats). At the [[Swiss federal election, 2015|latest legislative elections]] on 18 October 2015, the party won 18.8% of the popular vote and 43 out of 200 seats.&lt;ref name=NR2015/&gt;

The '''Social Liberal Party''' ({{lang-pt|Partido Social Liberal|links=https://pt.wikipedia.org/wiki/Partido_Social_Liberal}}, '''PSL''') is a [[right-wing]] [[conservative]] [[List of political parties in Brazil|political party in Brazil]]. Founded in 1994 as a [[social liberal]] [[Political party|party]], the PSL was registered on the [[Superior Electoral Court]] in 1998.

In January 2018, former [[Social Christian Party (Brazil)|Social Christian]] politician [[Jair Bolsonaro]] joined the party and later converted it into an [[economic liberal]] and [[social conservative]] party. The original name is intact for the time being after [[Livres (movement)|Livres]] (the party's original main wing) left the party and formed their own [[political movement]] to continue the party's original goals. Bolsonaro became the party's nominee for the [[Brazilian general election, 2018|2018 presidential election]] and won in both rounds.

== History ==
PSL was originally founded on 30 October 1994 by businessman [[Luciano Bivar]] as a [[social liberal]] party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.psl.org.br/|title=PSL - Partido Social Liberal 17|publisher=Social Liberal Party|language=Portuguese|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was registered on the [[Superior Electoral Court]] on 2 June 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psl.org.br/pagina/partido-social-liberal|title=Partido Social Liberal - Nossa História|last=|first=|website=psl.org.br|language=pt-br|access-date=2018-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Brazilian general election, 2002|2002 legislative elections]], PSL won 1 out of 513 seats in the [[Chamber of Deputies (Brazil)|Chamber of Deputies]] and no seats in the [[Federal Senate]]. In the [[Brazilian general election, 2006|2006 legislative elections]], the party won no seats in the Chamber of Deputies or the Federal Senate. In the [[Brazilian general election, 2010|2010 legislative elections]], PSL won 1 seat in the Chamber of Deputies and no seats in the Federal Senate, maintaining the same results in the [[Brazilian general election, 2014|2014 legislative elections]].

In 2015, PSL underwent a reform led by the internal social liberal wing [[Livres (movement)|Livres]], with names such as political scientist {{ILL|Fábio Ostermann|pt|Fábio Ostermann}} and journalist [[Leandro Narloch]] reinforcing the party's affiliation with social liberal policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pslnacional.org.br/|title=Partido Social Liberal|website=Pslnacional.org.br|publisher=Social Liberal Party|language=Portuguese|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rodrigoconstantino.com/artigos/psl-se-renova-e-foca-mais-no-liberal-da-sigla-ou-its-happening/|title=PSL se renova e foca mais no "liberal" da sigla. Ou: It's happening!|last=Constantino|first=Rodrigo|language=Portuguese|date=28 January 2016|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; PSL also supported the [[Impeachment of Dilma Rousseff|impeachment]] of ex-president [[Dilma Rousseff]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agenciabrasil.ebc.com.br/politica/noticia/2016-04/impeachment-de-dilma-saiba-como-votou-cada-um-dos-partidos-na-camara|title=Impeachment de Dilma: saiba como votou cada um dos partidos na Câmara|agency=Agência Brasil|language=Portuguese|date=18 April 2016|accessdate=29 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 January 2018, [[conservative]] and former Social Christian politician [[Jair Bolsonaro]] became a member of the party, which prompted the Livres wing to leave the party in protest of Bolsonaro's [[social conservative]] views. After the exit of Livres, the party followed a [[national conservative]] path, changed its colors from purple to the more [[Brazilian nationalism|nationalist]] blue, yellow and green (the colors of [[flag of Brazil|Brazil’s flag]]) and since then has discussed a name change either to Republicans (''Republicanos'') or Mobilize (''Mobiliza'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/politica/eleicoes/2018/noticia/deputado-jair-bolsonaro-anuncia-filiacao-ao-psl.ghtml|title=Deputado Jair Bolsonaro anuncia filiação ao PSL|publisher=G1|language=Portuguese|date=5 January 2018|accessdate=16 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 March 2018, Bivar stepped down from party’s presidency and [[Gustavo Bebianno]] was appointed as acting president.

Bolsonaro eventually became PSL’s nominee for the [[Brazilian general election, 2018|2018 presidential election]], [[Opinion polling for the Brazilian general election, 2018|exceeding polling forecasts]] to receive 46% of the popular vote in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-latin-america-45780176|title=Jair Bolsonaro: Far-right candidate wins first round of Brazil election|publisher=BBC News|date=8 October 2018|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bolsonaro's coattails helped elect 52 deputies and 4 senators from PSL, which will make it the second largest political party in the next Chamber of Deputies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-10-08/bolsonaro-election-effect-turns-brazil-s-congress-on-its-head|title=Bolsonaro Election Effect Turns Brazil's Congress on Its Head|last1=Gamarski|first1=Rachel|last2=Adghirni|first2=Samy|publisher=Bloomberg|date=8 October 2018|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also became the largest single party in the legislative assemblies of both [[Rio de Janeiro (state)|Rio de Janeiro]] and [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://g1.globo.com/rj/rio-de-janeiro/eleicoes/2018/noticia/2018/10/08/deputados-estaduais-sao-eleitos-no-rj-veja-lista.ghtml|title=Deputados estaduais eleitos no RJ; veja lista|publisher=G1|language=Portuguese|date=8 October 2018|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www1.folha.uol.com.br/poder/2018/10/psdb-cai-pela-metade-na-assembleia-de-sp-e-psl-se-torna-principal-bancada.shtml|title=PSDB cai pela metade na Assembleia de SP e PSL se torna principal bancada|last1=Pessoa|first1=Gabriela Sá|last2=Saldaña|first2=Paulo|newspaper=Folha de S.Paulo|language=Portuguese|date=8 October 2018|accessdate=13 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 October 2018, Bolsonaro was elected President with 55,13% of the votes, defeating [[Workers' Party (Brazil)|Workers' Party]]'s [[Fernando Haddad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/amphtml/world/the_americas/brazilians-vote-in-presidential-election-with-a-trump-fan-as-front-runner/2018/10/07/7d82d512-c65d-11e8-9c0f-2ffaf6d422aa_story.html|title=Brazil's far-right candidate takes big lead in presidential election|last1=Faiolo|first1=Anthony|last2=Lopes|first2=Marina|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=7 October 2018|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He will take office on 1 January 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/10/28/world/americas/jair-bolsonaro-brazil-election.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes|title=Jair Bolsonaro, Far-Right Populist, Elected President of Brazil|last1=Londoño|first1=Ernesto|last2=Darlington|first2=Shasta|newspaper=The New York Times|date=28 October 2018|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 October 2018, Bivar was re-appointed as party’s president.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://oglobo.globo.com/brasil/um-dia-apos-vitoria-de-bolsonaro-psl-troca-presidencia-do-partido-23196896|title=Um dia após vitória de Bolsonaro, PSL troca presidência do partido|last=Grillo|first=Marco|newspaper=O Globo|date=29 October 2018|language=Portuguese|accessdate=6 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organization ==
=== Ideology and policies ===
Since Bolsonaro's entrance in the party, PSL has changed much of its ideologies, abandoning its former [[Cultural liberalism|socially liberal]] policies and keeping its [[economic liberal]] policies, supporting [[privatisation]] and [[decentralisation]] while at the same time adopting [[Cultural conservatism|socially conservative]] policies regarding [[abortion]], [[legalization of marijuana]] and teaching of [[gender identity]] in schools.&lt;ref name="Em que acreditamos"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9361">'''Social justice art''', and [[art]]s for social justice, encompasses a wide range of visual and [[Performing arts|performing art]] that aim to raise [[critical consciousness]], build community, and motivate individuals to promote [[social change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=Lee|author2=Desai Dipti |title=Imagining Otherwise: Connecting the Arts and Social Justice to Envision an Act for Change: Special Issue Introduction|journal=Equity and Excellence in Education|date=August 10, 2011|volume=44|issue=3|pages=287–295|doi=10.1080/10665684.2011.591672}}&lt;/ref&gt; Art has been used as a means to record history, shape culture, cultivate imagination, and harness individual and [[social transformation]]. It can not only be a means to generate awareness, but it can also be a catalyst to engage community members to take action around a social issue.  '''Social justice art''' consequently allows people to develop [[Agency (philosophy)|agency]] to interrupt and alter [[Oppression|oppressive]] systemic patterns or individual behaviors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hanley|first=Mary|title=You Better Recognize!: The Arts as Social Justice for African American Students|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|date=August 10, 2011|volume=44|issue=3|pages=420–444|doi=10.1080/10665684.2011.589763}}&lt;/ref&gt; The processes by which people create and engage with art equips them with analytic tools to understand and challenge [[Social justice|social injustices]] through [[Teaching for social justice|social justice education]] (teaching for social justice), [[community building]], and social [[activism]]/[[social movements]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Roberts|first=Rosemarie|title=Facing and Transforming Hauntings of Race Through the Arts|journal=Equity and Excellence in education|date=August 10, 2011|volume=44|issue=3|pages=330–347|doi=10.1080/10665684.2011.591260}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of visual and performing social justice art includes: [[drawing]], [[painting]], [[sculpture]], [[murals]], [[graffiti]], [[film]], [[theater]], [[music]], [[dance]], [[spoken word]], etc. [[File:Filipino Community Mural.jpg|thumb|Filipino Community Mural]]

==Background==
Art has played a role in social justice education, community building, and social [[activism]]/[[social movement]]s.  It provides a universal language that gives voice to individuals and communities and is accessible across social boundaries.  These examples can overlap and are not strictly confined to one specific category.

==History==
Two well-known [[art movements]] that have utilized art as a means to work towards social justice are the [[Black Arts Movement]] and [[Chicano art movement]].  Both movements began to enter into public consciousness during the 1960s.  The [[Civil Rights Movement]] in combination with the [[Black Power Movement]] helped to propel the Black Arts Movement.  One of the main goals of this movement was to support [[Black Nationalism]] and [[Community mobilization|mobilize the community]] towards [[Social Action|social action]].  This period produced an increase in Black poetry, [[African-American literature|literature]], and [[African-American music|music]].  A few key figures of the movement were; author [[Marcus Garvey]], author and artist [[Charles S. Johnson]], revolutionary artist [[Emory Douglas]], and social dancer and choreographer Katrina Hazzard-Gordon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martin|first=Tony|title=Literary Garveyism: Garvey, Black Arts, and the Harlem Renaissance|year=1983|publisher=The Majority Press|location=Dover, Massachusetts|isbn=0-912469-00-5|pages=1–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The efforts to incorporate post-[[Mexican Revolution]] notions with current [[Mexican American]] social, political, and cultural issues drove the Chicana/Chicano Arts Movement. [[Murals]] are a form of [[visual art]] that experienced a rise in popularity during this movement.  Chicana/Chicano mural art became a means of working towards political goals, challenging [[stereotype]]s, as well as a way for community members to play an active role in creating community [[memoir]]s.  [[Diego Rivera]] was one prominent figure who helped to establish [[Mexican muralism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chicanoart.org The Road to Mictlan|url=http://www.chicanoart.org/dia05.html|work=Webpage|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[File:Diego Rivera - Detroit Industry Murals.jpg|thumb|Diego Rivera - Detroit Industry Murals]]

===Social justice education===
An educational approach that focuses on fostering awareness of social injustices and how [[Social inequality|inequalities]] impact youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Frank|first=Curkovic|title=Art and Social Justice Education Part 1|url=http://frankcurkovic.edublogs.org/2012/07/19/art-social-justice-education-part-1/|work=blog|accessdate=February 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social justice education saw its roots in the ideas of [[Paulo Freire]], author of [[Pedagogy of the Oppressed]]. In his work, Freire highlights the theoretical ideas of [[critical pedagogy]], which is an approach that combines education and [[critical theory]]. This approach is relevant to social justice art education because it combines the critique of social injustices and the use of art as a mechanism to engage with social issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Garber|first=Elizabeth|title=Social Justice and Art Education|journal=Visual Arts Research|year=2004|volume=30|series=59|issue=2|pages=4–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Culturally relevant arts education ====
Culturally relevant arts education (CRAE) is an education model that emerged from Tubman Theater Project.  The theater project is a culturally relevant [[drama]] program in which African American middle and high school students examine their [[internalized oppression]] and work to create positive racial [[Racial identity|identities]].  The program gives them the opportunity to learn from rehearsing and performing plays based on their lived experiences. This framework incorporates six different [[pedagogies]].  Three of these are art related; arts production, [[aesthetics]], and [[arts integration]] as well as three non-art related; [[multicultural education]], [[critical pedagogy]], and contextual teaching and learning.  CRAE engages both students and educators in a process in which they reflect on their social position in societal liberation and [[Subjugate|subjugation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hanley|first=Mary|title=You Better Recognize!: The Arts as Social Justice for African American Students|journal=Equity &amp; Excellence in Education|date=August 10, 2011 |volume=44 |issue=3 |pages=420–444|doi=10.1080/10665684.2011.589763}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social justice art in higher education===
Universities have employed social justice art education models within the art department.

:[[University of Michigan]] - The Prison Creative Arts Project&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lsa.umich.edu/pcap/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community building===
Sense of community is built through bridging geographic or interest-driven relationships.  Building community helps individuals come together to challenge inner oppressive dynamics that have been imposed by [[institution]]s, structures and bodies.  These inner oppressive dynamics have been termed “social ghosts” have been referenced in dance literature and function as a key theme within many community building art projects.  Art for community building is a collective effort in which the art making process strengthens community ties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lawton |first=Pamela |title=Hand-in Hand, Building Community on Common Ground|journal=Art Education|date=November 2010|volume=63|issue=6|pages=6–12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2386">The '''Spaak method''' of [[negotiation]] is named after [[Paul-Henri Spaak]], a [[Belgian]] politician, who applied this method at the [[Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom]] in 1956 at [[Castle of the Valley of the Duchess|Val Duchesse]] castle in preparing for the [[Treaties of Rome]] in 1957.

During the negotiations leading to the conference at Val Duchesse, most of the real negotiations took place prior to the actual [[Intergovernmental Conference]] (IGC) within the [[Spaak Committee]] that was charged with setting the agenda for the Val Duchesse conference. The final report of the committee then formed the basis for the final treaty which was then approved in [[Rome]]. Within this negotiating method, the preparatory committee has a strong initiating and brokerage role in the phase preceding the conference, while the actual Intergovernmental Conference only deals with negotiating small changes in the original agenda prepared by the preparatory committee.

This method was also applied to the preparation of the [[Economic and Monetary Union of the European Union|Economic and Monetary Union]] (EMU) by the [[Jacques Delors|Delors]] Committee.

[[File:Antonio Moro - Willem I van Nassau.jpg|thumb|[[William the Silent|William I of Orange]] was a stadtholder during the [[Dutch Revolt]] against the [[Spanish Empire]].]]
In the [[Low Countries]], '''''stadtholder''''' ({{lang-nl|stadhouder}}, {{IPA-nl|ˈstɑtˌɦʌudər}}) was an [[Steward (office)|office of steward]], designated a medieval official and then a national leader. The stadtholder was the replacement of the duke or earl of a province during the Burgundian and Habsburg period (1384 - 1581/1795).

The title was used for the official tasked with maintaining peace and provincial order in the early [[Dutch Republic]] and, at times, became ''de facto'' [[head of state]] of the Dutch Republic during the 16th to 18th centuries, which was an effectively hereditary role. For the last half century of its existence, it became an officially hereditary role and thus a monarchy (though maintaining republican pretence) under Prince [[William IV, Prince of Orange|William IV]]. His son, Prince [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]], was the last ''stadtholder'' of the republic, whose own son, King [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]], became the first king of the Netherlands. The [[Dutch monarchy]] is only distantly related to the first ''stadtholder'' of the young Republic, [[William the Silent|William of Orange]], the leader of the successful [[Dutch Revolt]] against the [[Spanish Empire]], his line having died out with [[William_III_of_England|William III]].

The title ''stadtholder'' is roughly comparable to England's historic title [[Lord Lieutenant]].

==Etymology==
''Stadtholder'' means "steward". Its component parts literally translate as "place holder," or as a direct cognate, "stead holder" (in modern Dutch "stad" means "city", but the older meaning of "stad" - also "stede" - was "place", and it is a cognate of English "stead", as "in stead of"), it was a term for a "[[steward (office)|steward]]" or "[[Lord Lieutenant|lieutenant]]".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.etymologiebank.nl/trefwoord/stadhouder Entry ''Stadhouder''] in M. Philippa ''et al.'' (2003-2009) ''Etymologisch Woordenboek van het Nederlands''. Etymologiebank.nl. {{nl icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Note, however, that is not the word for the military rank of lieutenant, which is ''luitenant'' in Dutch.

==History==

===Seventeen Provinces===
''Stadtholder''s in the [[Middle Ages]] were appointed by [[feudal]] lords to represent them in their absence. If a lord had several dominions (or, being a [[vassal]], [[fief]]s), some of these could be ruled by a permanent ''stadtholder'', to whom was delegated the full authority of the lord. A ''stadtholder'' was thus more powerful than a governor, who had only limited authority, but the stadtholder was not a vassal himself, having no title to the land. The local rulers of the independent [[Seventeen Provinces|province]]s of the [[Low Countries]] (which included the present-day [[Netherlands]], [[Belgium]] and [[Luxembourg]]) made extensive use of ''stadtholder''s, e.g. the [[Duke of Guelders]] appointed a ''stadtholder'' to represent him in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]].

In the 15th century the [[Duke of Burgundy|Dukes of Burgundy]] acquired most of the Low Countries, and these [[Burgundian Netherlands]] mostly each had their own ''stadtholder''.

In the 16th century, the [[Habsburg]] [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], also King of Spain, who had inherited the Burgundian Netherlands, completed this process by becoming the sole feudal overlord: Lord of the Netherlands. Only the [[Prince-Bishopric of Liège]] and two smaller territories (the [[Principality of Stavelot-Malmedy|Imperial Abbey of Stavelot-Malmedy]] and the [[Duke of Bouillon|Duchy of Bouillon]]) remained outside his domains. ''Stadtholder''s continued to be appointed to represent Charles and King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]], his son and successor in [[Spain]] and the Low Countries (the electoral Imperial title would be held by heirs of Charles in the separate Austrian branch of Habsburgs). Due to the centralist and [[absolutism (European history)|absolutist]] policies of Philip, the actual power of the ''stadtholder''s strongly diminished.

===Dutch Republic===
When, in 1581, during the [[Dutch Revolt]], most of the Dutch provinces declared their independence with the [[Act of Abjuration]], the representative function of the ''stadtholder'' became obsolete in the rebellious northern Netherlands – the feudal lord himself having been abolished – but the office nevertheless continued in these provinces who now united themselves into the [[Republic of the Seven United Netherlands]]. The United Provinces were struggling to adapt existing feudal concepts and institutions to the new situation and tended to be conservative in this matter, as they had after all rebelled against the king to defend their ancient rights.  The ''stadtholder'' no longer represented the lord but became the highest executive official, appointed by the states of each province.  Although each province could assign its own ''stadtholder'', most ''stadtholder''s held appointments from several provinces at the same time.  The highest executive power was normally exerted by the sovereign states of each province, but the stadtholder had some prerogatives, like appointing lower officials and sometimes having the ancient right to affirm the appointment (by [[co-option]]) of the members of regent councils or choose ''[[burgomaster]]s'' from a shortlist of candidates. As these councils themselves appointed most members of the states, the ''stadtholder'' could very indirectly influence the general policy. In [[Zeeland]] the [[Prince of Orange|Princes of Orange]], who after the Dutch Revolt most often held the office of ''stadtholder'' there, held the dignity of ''First Noble'', and were as such a member of the states of that province, because they held the title of [[Marquis of Veere and Flushing]] as one of their patrimonial titles.

On the Republic's central 'confederal' level, the ''stadtholder'' of the provinces of Holland and Zealand was normally also appointed [[Captain-General]] of the confederate army and [[Admiral-General]] of the confederate fleet, though no ''stadtholder'' ever actually commanded a fleet in battle. In the army, he could appoint officers by himself; in the navy only affirm appointments of the five admiralty councils. Legal powers of the stadtholder were thus rather limited, and by law he was a mere official. His real powers, however, were sometimes greater, especially given the martial law atmosphere of the 'permanent' [[Eighty Years War]].  [[Maurice of Orange]] after 1618 ruled as a military dictator, and [[William II of Orange]] attempted the same.

The leader of the Dutch Revolt was [[William the Silent]] (William I of Orange); he had been appointed ''stadtholder'' in 1572 by the first province to rebel, Holland. His personal influence and reputation was subsequently associated with the office and transferred to  members of his house. Maurice in 1618 and [[William III of England|William III of Orange]] from 1672 replaced entire city councils with their partisans to increase their power: the so-called "Changings of the Legislative" (''Wetsverzettingen''). By intimidation, the ''stadtholder''s tried to extend their right of affirmation. In reaction, the regents in Holland, Zeeland, Utrecht, Guelders, and Overijssel, after the death of William II in 1650, appointed no ''stadtholder''. They subsequently were forced to appoint one by the catastrophic events of 1672, the Dutch Year of Disaster (''[[Rampjaar]]''). After the death of William III in 1702 they again abstained from appointing one. These periods are known as the [[First Stadtholderless Period]] and the [[Second Stadtholderless Period]].

After the French invasion of 1747, the regents  were forced by a popular movement to accept [[William IV, Prince of Orange]], stadtholder of [[Friesland]] and [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]], as stadtholder in the other provinces. On 22 November 1747, the office of ''stadtholder'' was made hereditary (''erfstadhouder''). As William (for the first time in the history of the Republic) was ''stadtholder'' in all provinces, his function accordingly was restyled ''Stadhouder-Generaal''.

After William IV's death in 1751, his infant son was duly appointed ''stadtholder'' under the regency of his mother. The misgovernment of this regency caused much resentment, which issued  in 1780 in the [[Patriots (Dutch Republic)|Patriot movement]]. The Patriots first took over many city councils, then the [[States of Holland and West Friesland|States of the province of Holland]], and ultimately raised civil militias to defend their position against Orangist partisans, bringing the country to the brink of civil war. Through [[Prussian invasion of Holland|Prussian military intervention in 1787]], Prince [[William V of Orange]] was able to suppress this opposition, and many leaders of the Patriot movement went into exile in France. The stadtholderate was strengthened with the [[Act of Guarantee]] (1788).

===Abolition and transition to kingdom===
The exiles returned with French armies in the winter of 1795 and overcame the frozen [[Dutch Water Line]]. William V of Orange-Nassau fled to England, and the office of stadtholder was abolished in 1795 when the [[France|French]] revolutionary forces installed the [[Batavian Republic]]. From 1572 in the [[Southern Netherlands]] the Habsburg lords continued to appoint provincial stadtholders for the region, until it was annexed by France in 1794. However, [[William I of the Netherlands|William I]], the son of the last stadtholder [[William V, Prince of Orange|William V]], was crowned king after the French army retreated in 1815.

==Definition and description==
The Subsistence Homesteads Division Director, [[M. L. Wilson|Milburn L. Wilson]], defined a "subsistence homestead" as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;A subsistence homestead denotes a house and out buildings located upon a plot of land on which can be grown a large portion of foodstuffs required by the homestead family. It signifies production for home consumption and not for commercial sale. In that it provides for subsistence alone, it carries with it the corollary that cash income must be drawn from some outside source. The central motive of the subsistence homestead program, therefore, is to demonstrate the economic value of a livelihood which combines part-time wage work and part-time gardening or farming.&lt;ref name = "carriker"&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

DSH projects "would be initiated at the state level and administered through a nonprofit corporation. Successful applicants would offer a combination of part-time employment opportunities, fertile soil for part-time farming, and locations connected to the services of established cities."&lt;ref name = "carriker" /&gt;

==Philosophy==
The Subsistence Homesteading Program was based on an [[agrarianism|agrarian]], [[Back-to-the-land movement|"back-to-the-land"]] philosophy which meant a partial return to the simpler, [[Agrarian society|farming life]] of the past. Eleanor and [[Franklin D. Roosevelt|Franklin Roosevelt]] both endorsed the idea that for [[Poverty|poor people]], [[Rural area|rural life]] could be healthier than [[Urban culture|city life]].

[[Cooperation]], community [[socialization]], and [[community|community work]] were also emphasized.&lt;ref name = "straw"/&gt; However, going "back-to-the-land" did not always sit well with people stuck in outlying "stranded communities" without jobs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

There was strong opposition to the idea of subsistence homesteads, as undercutting agricultural prices, unions, and the labor supply for manufacturing. Nonetheless, as of 2011, some communities, such as [[Arthurdale, West Virginia]], in which Eleanor Roosevelt was personally involved, maintain an active memory of the program.&lt;ref name="amex"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/amex/eleanor/filmmore/transcript/transcript1.html WGBH/''American Experience''.

'''''The [[Liberalism in Europe|Liberal]] Politics Of Adolf Hitler''''' is a novel by the author [[John King (author)|John King]], published in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pmpress.org/content/article.php/JohnKing|title=John King|website=PM Press|publisher=PM Press|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Three essays led into its release – ''The left wing case for leaving the EU'' and ''Flying The Flag'' (''both in New Statesman''), and ''The People Versus The Elite'' (Penguin). A supporter of [[Brexit|British withdrawal]] from the [[European Union]], King appeared on BBC Radio 4's ''Any Questions'' at this time, along with the author [[Frederick Forsyth]].

==Plot==
''The Liberal Politics Of Adolf Hitler'' is set approximately 50 years into the future, when a [[European superstate]] has been formed and the individual countries of Europe officially dissolved. Power is centralised in the hands of a corporate-driven elite based in Brussels and Berlin. Controllers describe this masked dictatorship as New Democracy. Elections are a thing of the past and the cultures of the old nation states are recycled in distorted ways. Across Europe, people fight back, with the two main British resistance groups being GB45 and Conflict.

The novel looks at [[globalization]], the nature of democracy, the manipulation of language and the future uses of technology. There is also an animal-rights thread to the story which, in an interview with ''3am Magazine'', the author linked to his next novel, ''Slaughterhouse Prayer''.

==Reception==
{{Cleanup-PR|section|date=June 2018}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2018}}
Trade Unionists Against The EU called the book: "Brave, imaginative fiction. An important political novel that is supremely relevant to our turbulent times." 3AM Magazine: "A timely and provocative satire." Marc Glendening of The Democracy Movement: "One of the most bizarre and wonderful things I have read. It has the dreamlike quality of a [[David Lynch]] movie. A cross between ''[[Brave New World]]'', ''[[A Clockwork Orange (novel)|A Clockwork Orange]]'' and ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]''." Garry Bushell: "A great read set in a dystopian future." ''Streets Sounds'': "''[[Blade Runner]]'' meets [[The Clash]]. Punk fiction at its very best." ''The Morning Star'': "King steadily constructs, layer by layer, an increasingly believable world where a combination of intrusive technology, ruthlessness and effectively bland public relations has ensured the domination of the majority’s thoughts and actions."

[[File:Carter Reagan Debate 10-28-80.png|thumb|Then-president [[Jimmy Carter]] ''(left)'' and Republican candidate [[Ronald Reagan]] ''(right)'' at the presidential debate October 28, 1980. Reagan most memorably deployed the phrase "there you go again."]]
"'''There you go again'''" was a phrase spoken during the 1980 [[United States presidential election debate]] by [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] presidential candidate Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] to his [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] opponent, incumbent President [[Jimmy Carter]]. Reagan would use the line in a few debates over the years, always in a way intended to disarm his opponent.&lt;ref name="usa today"/&gt;

"There you go again" emerged as a defining phrase of the [[United States presidential election, 1980|1980 presidential election]].&lt;ref name="gannett"/&gt; The phrase has endured in the political [[lexicon]] in news headlines, as a way to quickly imply that an opponent is engaged in hyperbole or even hysterical comments.&lt;ref name="wash post"/&gt;

==Context==
The one debate between Reagan and Carter of the 1980 presidential election year was held a week before Election Day by the [[League of Women Voters]]. At one point, Carter went on the offensive against Reagan's record regarding [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]].

:'''President Carter:''' These constant suggestions that the basic Social Security System should be changed does call for concern and consternation among the aged of our country. It is obvious that we should have a commitment to them, that Social Security benefits should not be taxed and that there would be no peremptory change in the standards by which Social Security payments are made to retired people. . . .  Governor Reagan, as a matter of fact, began his political career campaigning around this nation against Medicare. Now, we have an opportunity to move toward national health insurance, with an emphasis on the prevention of disease, an emphasis on out-patient care, not in-patient care; an emphasis on hospital cost containment to hold down the cost of hospital care far those who are ill, an emphasis on catastrophic health insurance, so that if a family is threatened with being wiped out economically because of a very high medical bill, then the insurance would help pay for it. These are the kinds of elements of a national health insurance, important to the American people. Governor Reagan, again, typically is against such a proposal.

:(Moderator) '''Howard K. Smith:''' Governor?

:'''Governor Reagan:'''  There you go again.&lt;ref name="seattle times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cnn"/&gt;  When I opposed Medicare, there was another piece of legislation meeting the same problem before the Congress. I happened to favor the other piece of legislation and thought that it would be better for the senior citizens and provide better care than the one that was finally passed. I was not opposing the principle of providing care for them. I was opposing one piece of legislation versus another.

An [[Associated Press]] article from 2008 stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Reagan was a master at capturing a debate moment that everyone will remember. His 'there you go again' line defused his opponent's attack.&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Later use==
Reagan sometimes used the phrase during his presidential press conferences.&lt;ref name="american chronicle"/&gt;

During the 2006 [[Connecticut]] Democratic senate primary debate, Incumbent Senator [[Joe Lieberman]] used the line a number of times against his primary challenger [[Ned Lamont]]. During the 2008 vice-presidential debate, Republican vice-presidential nominee, [[Alaska]] Governor [[Sarah Palin]], used the line on Democratic opponent [[Joe Biden]].&lt;ref name="ap"/&gt;  Both Lieberman and Palin lost those races; however, Lieberman went on to defeat Lamont in the general election running as an independent.

During the [[United States Presidential Election, 2012|2012 presidential election]], former President [[Bill Clinton]] paraphrased the line after criticizing the policies of the Republican platform by saying 'There they go again'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Espo|first=David|title=Journalist|url=http://minnesota.publicradio.org/display/web/2012/09/05/politics/clinton-gop-winner-take-all-society/|publisher=MPR News|accessdate=September 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United States presidential election debates, 2016|2016 vice presidential debates]], Republican Vice Presidential nominee [[Mike Pence]] used the line "There they go again" in responding to Democratic Vice Presidential nominee [[Tim Kaine]]'s statement that Pence was a "chief cheerleader for the privatization of social security."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2016/oct/04/tim-kaine-mike-pence-vice-presidential-debate-elections-live&lt;/ref&gt;

{{2005 French riots}}
[[Image:Strasbourg torched car.jpg|thumb|A car burns in [[Strasbourg]], France on the night of November 5 as riots spread from the Paris banlieues to other parts of the country.]]

The following is a '''timeline of the [[2005 French riots]]''' that began Thursday, October 27, 2005. Where the source lists events as occurring in a night and following morning, this article lists them on the date of the night, not the following morning. The extent table in the main article does the opposite.

&lt;!-- Discuss in Discussion first to justify putting this back. * Wednesday October 21 - French Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]][http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/L19243562.htm] announced a crackdown on urban violence and black marketeers on Wednesday, ordering specially trained police to tackle 25 tough neighbourhoods across the country. Sarkozy, who has clearly stated his ambition to run for president in 2007, also announced plans to combat violence in football stadiums, including greater use of video surveillance and bans on hooligans caught on film. "This ... is a totally new strategy to push back urban violence and make life possible in a certain number of neighbourhoods where trafficking and the underground economy have infected daily life," Sarkozy said at the launch of his new initiative. "We absolutely have to re-establish a foothold in these neighbourhoods and obtain results," he said. --&gt;

==First week==

[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/4437206.stm]
***Many residents in poor neighborhoods hit by crime, high unemployment and a lack of prospects do not expect the government's plans to bear much fruit. "Nothing will change", Henri-Anne Dzerahovic, 61, said in the bleak Clichy-Sous-Bois suburb in the northeast of Paris. "I'm moving out of here. I've had enough. Anywhere you go, you're afraid of being attacked. Any time. Not just in the past two weeks. It's an awful climate", said Dzerahovic.[https://web.archive.org/web/20050620200549/http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews]
**Night - 19th night of rioting
***215 vehicles (60 of which in the Île-de-France) were set on fire and 71 people were detained overnight.[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-706693,36-710208@51-707207,0.html]
* '''Tuesday November 15'''
**Day
***The lower house of France's parliament has approved plans to extend special powers until February 21, 2006 to try to bring a wave of urban rioting under control. The emergency laws also need the approval of the Senate, which votes on the issue on Wednesday. Interior Minister [[Nicolas Sarkozy]] had told deputies France was facing one of its "sharpest and most complex urban crises", which required "firmness". He said most of those arrested in the riots were already known delinquents.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4437800.stm]
**Night - 20th night of rioting
***Violence subsided further, with 163 torched vehicles (27 of which in the Île-de-France) and 50 arrests. Only five communes had more than five cases of arson, among them Arras, Brest and Vitry-le-François with 11 each. In [[Romans-sur-Isère]], a church was burnt in an arson attack. One policeman was injured in Pont-Evêque (Isère) as he was hit by a bottle filled with acid. Since 27 October, a total of 126 policemen were injured.[http://www.lemonde.fr/web/article/0,1-0@2-3226,36-710597@51-704172,0.html]
* '''Wednesday November 16'''
**Day
***The French parliament has approved a three-month extension of emergency laws aimed at curbing riots by urban youths. The Senate on Wednesday passed the extension - a day after a similar vote in the lower house. The laws allow local authorities to impose curfews, conduct house-to-house searches and ban public gatherings. The lower house passed them by a 346-148 majority, and the Senate by 202-125.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4441246.stm]
***Senior officials from President Jacques Chirac's centre-right party have suggested that [[polygamy]] is one factor in the riots, arguing children of polygamous families have less of a father figure and are more likely to live in overcrowded conditions. "Polygamy... prevents people being educated as they should be in an organised society. Tens of people cannot live in a single flat", Bernard Accoyer, leader of the Union for a Popular Majority (UMP) in the [[National Assembly of France|National Assembly]] lower house of parliament, told French radio. Polygamy is illegal in France but until 1993, it was possible for immigrants to bring more than one wife from their home country to join them.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4441246.stm] (Note: [[Islam]] allows a man to have up to four wives at a time.)

==Fourth week==

* '''Thursday November 17'''
**Day
***French police say levels of violence in France have returned to "normal", following three weeks of unrest by urban youths across the country. Police said 98 vehicles were torched on Wednesday night, marking a "return to a normal situation everywhere in France". The police service said the figure of 98 cars burnt was in line with the nightly average before the trouble began on 27 October. Authorities in the Rhone region, which covers Lyon and nearby south-eastern towns, lifted a curfew on minors after just eight cars were destroyed overnight.[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4445428.stm]
***French Muslim leaders denounced on Thursday efforts to blame Muslims and Islam for recent riots in the country's rundown suburbs and said they saw worrying signs of growing prejudice against their faith here. Many young rioters may have been from Muslim backgrounds, but their violent outburst was a protest against unemployment, poor housing and other bias they faced because of their foreign origins, they told journalists. "They didn't act like that because they're Muslims, but because of the misery they're living in", said Kamel Kabtane, rector of the Grand Mosque of Lyon in eastern France. "There weren't just Mohammads and Alis in those groups (of rioters) -- there were Tonys and Daniels too", said Dalil Boubakeur, the Paris Grand Mosque rector who is also head of France's official Muslim Council (CFCM).[https://web.archive.org/web/20050620200549/http://today.reuters.com/news/newsArticle.aspx?type=worldNews]
* '''Friday November 18'''
**Day
***French Equal Opportunities Minister [[Azouz Begag]] has urged the government to overturn a ban on collecting data based on ethnicity or religion. Government bodies and private companies are barred from gathering such data - which is deemed potentially divisive. But M. Begag told [[Le Figaro]] newspaper it was important to assess the presence of minorities in various professions. Job discrimination was a key complaint voiced by many youths who rioted in immigrant suburbs in recent weeks. "We need to see France's true colours", M. Begag said. "To do that, we need to measure the proportion of immigrant children among the police, magistrates, in the civil service as well as in the private sector."[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4451038.stm]

'''Together''' ({{lang-hu|Együtt}}), officially '''Together – Party for a New Era''' ({{lang-hu|Együtt – A Korszakváltók Pártja}}), formerly also known as '''Together 2014''' ({{lang-hu|Együtt 2014}}), was a [[Social liberalism|socially liberal]]&lt;ref name="Nordsieck"/&gt; [[List of political parties in Hungary|political party]] in [[Hungary]], formed on 26 October 2012 for the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2014|2014 Hungarian parliamentary election]] by [[Gordon Bajnai]], the former [[Prime Minister of Hungary]], to contrast [[Viktor Orbán]]'s government. Together was founded as a coalition of left-wing and liberal political movements and civil organizations, which transformed itself into a party in March 2013.

The party had formed an electoral alliance with the [[Dialogue for Hungary]] (PM) and they won together four seats in the [[Hungarian Parliament|national assembly]] and one seat in the [[European Parliament]] in 2014. The Together dissolved after its poor performance in the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2018|2018 parliamentary election]].

==Members==
During its foundation, the coalition consisted of three civil society organizations:
* '''Patriotism and Progress Association''' led by [[Gordon Bajnai]]. The ''Patriotism and Progress Public Policy Foundation'' formed after the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2010|2010 elections]], which prepared several professional programs and proposal for the government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hazaeshaladas.hu/en/about_us-1.html | language =  | work = hazaeshaladas.hu | date =  | title = ''About us'' | accessdate = 28 October 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20120927230853/http://www.hazaeshaladas.hu/en/about_us-1.html | archivedate = 27 September 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization transformed to association in October 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hazaeshaladas.org/ | language = Hungarian | work = hazaeshaladas.org | date =  | title = ''Patriotism and Progress Association'' | accessdate = 28 October 2012 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121112015008/http://www.hazaeshaladas.org/ | archivedate = 12 November 2012 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''One Million for Press Freedom (Milla)''' led by [[Péter Juhász (politician)|Péter Juhász]], originally a [[Facebook]] group, which formed against the Viktor Orbán's cabinet Media Act on 20 December 2010.

* '''[[Hungarian Solidarity Movement]]''' led by [[Péter Kónya]], a social and trade union movement, based on the Polish [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]], formed on 4 October 2011. Solidarity left the Together party in February 2015, because disagreed with the party's internal integration and abolition of the Together's coalition platform system which led to the formation of an unified image party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=24 September 2015|url=http://hvg.hu/itthon/20150216_Szakit_a_Szolidaritas_es_az_Egyutt_Konya|title=Szakít a Szolidaritás és az Együtt, Kónya kilép Szigetváriéktól|date=16 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Gordon Bajnai announced his return to politics on 23 October 2012, during the anti-government demonstration of the One Million for Press Freedom (Milla).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.hu/20121009/bajnai-said-to-announce-return-to-politics-on-october-23/ Bajnai said to announce return to politics on October 23] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924100137/http://www.politics.hu/20121009/bajnai-said-to-announce-return-to-politics-on-october-23/ |date=2015-09-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the protest, he called for an anti-Orbán coalition so as to form a supermajority in Parliament with the help of which the changes done by Orbán's ruling party, [[Fidesz]] could be undone.

[[File:Műegyetem rakpart október 23 148.JPG|thumb|left|Ex-prime minister [[Gordon Bajnai]], who announced the establishment of the Together alliance on 23 October 2012]]

In his speech, Bajnai repeatedly used a variant of the term ("We may fail on our own, but together, we shall prove victorious!"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hazaeshaladas.hu/ftp/speech_of_mr_gordon_bajnai_-_23_october_2012.pdf Gordon Bajnai's speech as published on the home page of his organization] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116131232/http://www.hazaeshaladas.hu/ftp/speech_of_mr_gordon_bajnai_-_23_october_2012.pdf |date=2014-01-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he proclaimed his support for such a "cooperation between hopeful left-wingers, disappointed rightwingers, politically abandoned free-thinkers and  committed  Greens" that his organization along with two other civilian body named Together 2014 as a reference to the date of the next general elections in Hungary.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-20052322 BBC News - Mass rallies mark 1956 Hungary uprising]&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2012, Bajnai announced that he intends to be a parliamentarian candidate in the 2014 general election.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politics.hu/20121217/bajnai-says-plans-to-run-for-parliament-in-car-accident-in-budapest/ Bajnai says plans to run for Parliament; in car accident in Budapest] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150214231711/http://www.politics.hu/20121217/bajnai-says-plans-to-run-for-parliament-in-car-accident-in-budapest/ |date=2015-02-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to plans, Together 2014 would have been an umbrella organization of centre-left parties, similar to [[The Olive Tree (political coalition)|the Olive Tree]] in [[Italy]] which established against [[Silvio Berlusconi]]'s right-wing coalition in 1995. However [[Politics Can Be Different]] (LMP) had rejected the cooperation in November 2012&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.hu/belfold/2012/11/18/az_lmp_nemet_mondott_bajnaiek_ajanlatara/ Az LMP nemet mondott Bajnaiéknak] – Index, 2012-11-18&lt;/ref&gt; and January 2013,&lt;ref&gt;[http://index.hu/belfold/2013/01/27/szakad_az_lmp/ Szétszakadt az LMP] – Index, 2013-01-27&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Hungarian Socialist Party]] led by [[Attila Mesterházy]] gradually took over the initiative.

The Together movement transformed itself into party on 8 March 2013, as only parties could take part in the election according to the rules. Three co-presidents were elected: [[Viktor Szigetvári]] (Patriotism and Progress Association), Péter Kónya (Solidarity) and Péter Juhász (Milla).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hirado.hu/Hirek/2013/03/08/11/Partta_alakult_az_Egyutt_2014__kozismert_arcok.aspx Párttá alakult az Együtt 2014 - közismert arcok a vezetőségben] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141021193827/http://www.hirado.hu/Hirek/2013/03/08/11/Partta_alakult_az_Egyutt_2014__kozismert_arcok.aspx |date=2014-10-21 }} – Híradó.hu, 2013-03-08&lt;/ref&gt; The party was registered as "Together – Party for a New Era" because several other organizations overtaken the name "Together 2014" at the National Election Office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.delmagyar.hu/belfold_hirek/egyutt_8211_a_korszakvaltok_partja_bejegyeztek_bajnai_gordon_partjat/2339537/ Együtt – a Korszakváltók Pártja: bejegyezték Bajnai Gordon pártját] – Délmagyar.hu, 2013-06-28&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 January 2014, five opposition parties, including Together, entered into a coalition and formed [[Unity (Hungary)|Unity]] alliance. Contrary to his earlier plans, Bajnai could not reach to become joint Prime Minister candidate of the left-wing opposition since [[Attila Mesterházy]] (MSZP) was appointed to that position.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=2014-01-14|url=http://www.politics.hu/20140114/quotable-antal-rogan-on-the-opposition-coalition/|title=Quotable: Antal Rogan on the opposition coalition|date=2014-01-14|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140116071822/http://www.politics.hu/20140114/quotable-antal-rogan-on-the-opposition-coalition/|archivedate=2014-01-16|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Unity suffered a heavy defeat and Together won only three mandates within the alliance and was unable to form a parliamentary group. The Together–Dialogue for Hungary alliance received 7.25% of the votes in the [[European Parliament election, 2014 (Hungary)|2014 European Parliament election]] and gained one seat ([[Benedek Jávor]], co-leader of the Dialogue for Hungary).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=27 May 2014|url=http://index.hu/kulfold/ep/2014/05/26/kezdodik_az_mszp_vegjateka/|title=Kezdődik az MSZP végjátéka|date=26 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the retirement of Gordon Bajnai in September 2014, [[Viktor Szigetvári]] became the only key leader of the party. He was elected sole president in February 2015, against [[Levente Pápa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=24 September 2015|url=http://444.hu/2015/02/14/szigetvari-viktort-valasztottak-az-egyutt-elnokenek/|title=Szigetvári Viktort választották az Együtt elnökének|date=14 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 September 2016, the delegate assembly decided to participate in the [[Next Hungarian parliamentary election|next parliamentary election]] with a separate national list. Together also announced its intention of selection of joint opposition individual candidates through primaries in each constituencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=24 September 2016|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2016/09/24/az_egyutt_dontott_kulon_indul_2018-ban/|title=Az Együtt döntött: külön indul 2018-ban|date=24 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Együtt 2018 logo.svg|thumb|right|The party's campaign banner for the [[Hungarian parliamentary election, 2018|2018 parliamentary election]]]]

On 4 February 2017, Péter Juhász was elected as the party's new leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://mno.hu/belfold/juhasz-petert-valasztottak-az-egyutt-elnokeve-1384410|title=Juhász Pétert választották az Együtt elnökévé|last=MTI|newspaper=mno.hu|language=hu|access-date=2017-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the same day, Balázs Berkecz and Nóra Hajdú were elected as vice-presidents, and [[Viktor Szigetvári]] as the leader of the party's National Political Council (the board of the party). Since March, Juhász urged the election cooperation of those "democratic opposition parties", which refuse both the Orbán regime and the former governing left-wing parties, who represent the "world before 2010". Juhász called his concept as "New Pole" (''Új Pólus''), with the possible participation of the Politics Can Be Different (LMP), the Dialogue for Hungary (PM), the [[Hungarian Two-tailed Dog Party]] (MKKP) and the [[Momentum Movement]], in addition to his party. With that statement, Juhász refused the cooperation with the Hungarian Socialist Party (MSZP), the [[Democratic Coalition (Hungary)|Democratic Coalition]] (DK) and the [[Hungarian Liberal Party]] (MLP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2017/03/28/uj_baloldali_polust_akar_juhasz_peter_interju_az_egyutt_elnokevel/|title=Rohadt paradicsomot is lehetne dobálni Orbánra|author=Dull, Szabolcs|date=2017-03-28|publisher=[[Index.hu]]|accessdate=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a Medián opinion poll published in July 2017, this hypothetical alliance would receive 16 percent of the vote in the next election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2017/07/07/meglepo_adat_16_szazalek_szavazna_az_lmp-momentum-egyutt-parbeszedre/|title=Meglepő adat: 16 százalék szavazna az LMP-Momentum-Együtt-Párbeszédre|author=Dull, Szabolcs|date=2017-07-07|publisher=[[Index.hu]]|accessdate=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Together and the PM renewed their alliance in accordance with Juhász's "New Pole" concept on 4 October 2017, both LMP and Momentum Movement had rejected the election cooperation with other parties.&lt;ref name="egyutt-pm2.0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2017/10/04/ujra_van_egyutt-pm_szovetseg/|title=Újra van Együtt–PM szövetség|author=Dull, Szabolcs|date=2017-10-04|publisher=[[Index.hu]]|accessdate=2017-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 23 June 2017, MP [[Zsuzsanna Szelényi]] announced that she resigned from her position in the party leadership and quit Together, after losing the election for the party leadership in February against Péter Juhász. She also disagreed with the new direction and method of politics, installed by Juhász and criticized the new president's guerrilla campaign methods and media PR campaigns and "ostentatious performances". She also said that she would retain her parliamentary mandate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://index.hu/belfold/2017/06/23/szelenyi_zsuzsa_lemondott_es_kilepett_az_egyuttbol/|title=Szelényi Zsuzsa lemondott és kilépett az Együttből|author=Dull, Szabolcs|date=2017-06-23|publisher=[[Index.hu]]|accessdate=2017-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2018, leaders of the party announced that Together will participate in the 2018 national election separately. Former president Viktor Szigetvári was nominated the party's candidate for the position of prime minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.napi.hu/magyar_gazdasag/szigetvari_az_egyutt_miniszterelnok-jeloltje.654798.html|title=Szigetvári az Együtt miniszterelnök-jelöltje|accessdate=2018-01-13|work=Napi.hu}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party failed to reach 5% electoral threshold, receiving 0.66 percent of the vote, albeit an individual candidate [[Szabolcs Szabó]] obtained a mandate, becoming his party's only MP. Subsequently, Szabó joined the [[Politics Can Be Different|LMP]] parliamentary group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://444.hu/2018/04/27/szabo-szabolcs-az-lmp-frakciojaba-ul-be|title=Szabó Szabolcs az LMP frakciójába ül be

For most of the 20th century, the '''United States Bureau of Mines''' ('''USBM''') was the primary [[Federal government of the United States|United States government]] agency conducting scientific research and disseminating information on the extraction, processing, use, and conservation of [[mineral]] [[natural resource|resources]]. The Bureau was abolished in 1996.

== Summary ==
USBM was established in the [[Department of the Interior]] on May 16, 1910, pursuant to the Organic Act (Public Law 179), to deal with a wave of catastrophic [[Mining|mine]] disasters. The Bureau's mission was gradually expanded to include:
* The conduct of research to enhance the safety, health, and environmental impact of mining and processing of minerals and materials.
* The collection, analysis, and dissemination of information about mining and processing of more than 100 mineral commodities across the Nation and in more than 185 countries around the world.
* Analysis of the impact of proposed mineral-related laws and regulations upon the national interest.
* Production, conservation, sale, and distribution of [[helium]] for essential government activities

The first director of the USBM was [[Joseph Austin Holmes]], a pioneer in occupational safety and health. He served from 1910 until his death in 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/niosh/mining/works/coversheet1609.html|title=A History of the Bureau of Mines Pittsburgh Research Center|last=Tuchman|first=R.|last2=Brinkley|date=January 1990|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From its creation, the USBM was viewed, both nationally and internationally, as the focal point for new and emerging science and technology in the minerals field. Since entering competition in 1978, the Bureau of Mines won 35 R&amp;D 100 Awards, given annually by ''[[R&amp;D Magazine]]'' for the 100 most important research innovations of the year. This achievement is especially impressive considering the small size of the Bureau's research budget, compared to those of competing organizations, such as [[DuPont|E.I. du Pont de Nemours and Company]], [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric Corporation]], [[General Electric|General Electric Company]], [[Hitachi, Ltd.]], the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], and the [[NASA|National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] (NASA).

== Evolution of USBM ==
USBM originally provided safety and health inspection for mines on a nationwide basis, replacing some, but not all state inspection operations. This division comprised the majority of personnel in USBM. In 1973 the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] created a separate agency within the department, the [[Mining Enforcement and Safety Administration]] (MESA), and the safety and health enforcement responsibilities were transferred to the new agency.&lt;ref name="MSHA history"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arlweb.msha.gov/MSHAINFO/MSHAINF2.htm |title=History of Mine Safety and Health Legislation |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |publisher=U.S. Mine Safety and Health Administration |location=Arlington, VA |access-date=2017-08-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 [[United States Congress|Congress]] passed the [[Federal Mine Safety and Health Act]], which expanded the federal authority for health and safety regulation, and created a new agency, the [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] (MSHA).&lt;ref&gt;United States. Mine Safety and Health Act of 1977, {{uspl|95|164}}, approved November 9, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; MSHA is located in the [[United States Department of Labor|Department of Labor]], and replaced MESA.&lt;ref name="MSHA history"/&gt;

Congress created the [[Office of Surface Mining]] with the passage of the [[Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977]], and this agency inherited USBM's surface mining activities.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Surface Mining Control and Reclamation Act of 1977, {{uspl|95|87}}, approved August 3, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]] (DOE), also established in 1977, took over the USBM Coal Productivity Research division.&lt;ref&gt;United States. Department of Energy Organization Act of 1977, {{uspl|95|91}}, approved August 4, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the work was left unfunded by the newly created DOE as other priorities too the budget. These reorganizations led to a reduction in USBM staff, from approximately 6,000 in 1968 to 2,600 in the late 1970s. At its peak, USBM had 14 centers throughout the nation, but that was eventually reduced to four "mining research centers" in Denver, Pittsburgh, Minneapolis, and Spokane.{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

== Closure of USBM ==
:"We leave knowing that the proud accomplishments of this agency did make a difference in the quality of life we now enjoy, and they will continue to do so well into the 21st century." &amp;mdash; USBM Director [[Rhea Graham]]

In September 1995, [[United States Congress|Congress]] voted to close the Bureau of Mines and to transfer certain functions to other federal agencies. With USBM's closure, almost $100 million, or 66%, of its 1995 programs ceased, and approximately 1,000 of its employees were dismissed. Certain specific health, safety, and materials programs were transferred to the [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], and certain minerals information activities moved to the [[United States Geological Survey|U.S. Geological Survey]] and the [[Bureau of Land Management]]. The Bureau's archive of mining maps was transferred to the [[National Mine Map Repository]] (NMMR), a part of the [[Office of Surface Mining]] (OSM). Closure of the Bureau of Mines, and the accompanying transfers of functions and employee layoffs were essentially complete in March 1996.

The Bureau's Minerals Information functions were transferred to the U.S. Geological Survey (USGS) in early 1996. The "Mineral Industry Surveys," "Mineral Commodity Summaries," and the "Minerals Yearbook" continued to be published.  The Bureau's technical reports are archived by [[Technical Report Archive &amp; Image Library]]

The Health and Safety Research Program at the [[Pittsburgh]] and [[Spokane]] Research Centers was assigned on an interim basis to DOE (Public Law 104-99). In fiscal year 1997, it was permanently transferred to the [[National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health]] (NIOSH) (Public Law 104-134). NIOSH is part of the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]] within the [[Department of Health and Human Services]]. A total of 413 full-time equivalent employees were transferred to NIOSH on October 11, 1996—336 in Pittsburgh and 77 in Spokane. A position of Associate Director for Mining in the NIOSH headquarters office was created. Under NIOSH, the Pittsburgh and Spokane Research "Centers" were renamed the [[Experimental Mine, U.S. Bureau of Mines|Pittsburgh Research Laboratory]] and Spokane Research Laboratory. Both labs currently reside under NIOSH's [[Office of Mine Safety and Health Research]].

== Proposed re-establishment ==
On May 28, 2010, [[U.S. Senator|Senator]] [[Jay Rockefeller]] (D-WV) released a list of proposed changes to mine safety laws including re-establishing the Bureau of Mines.&lt;ref name="Rivard"&gt;{{cite news|last=Rivard|first=Ry|title=Massey CEO urges caution|url=http://dailymail.com/Business/201005300623|accessdate=May 31, 2010|newspaper=[[Charleston Daily Mail]]|date=May 31, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Greek War of Independence}}

The '''uprising of 1821''' was a social and political rebellion in [[Wallachia]], which was at the time a [[Vassal and tributary states of the Ottoman Empire|tributary state]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. It originated as a movement against the [[Phanariotes|Phanariote]] administration, with backing from the more conservative [[Boyars of Wallachia and Moldavia|boyars]], but mutated into an attempted removal of the boyar class. Though not directed against Ottoman rule, the revolt espoused an early version of [[Romanian nationalism]], and is described by historians as the first major event of a [[National awakening of Romania|national awakening]]. The revolutionary force was centered on a group of [[Pandur]] irregulars, whose leader was [[Tudor Vladimirescu]]. Its nucleus was the Wallachian subregion of [[Oltenia]], where Vladimirescu established his "Assembly of the People" in February.

From the beginning, Pandurs were joined by groups of [[Arnaut]]s and by veterans of the [[Serbian Revolution]]. Although infused with [[Anti-Greek sentiment|anti-Hellenism]], they collaborated with, and were infiltrated by, agents of the [[Filiki Eteria]]. Vladimirescu also cooperated with the [[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]] of [[Alexander Ypsilantis]], thereby contributing to the larger [[Greek War of Independence|war of Greek independence]]. In conjunction with Ypsilantis' troops coming in from [[Moldavia]], Vladimirescu managed to occupy [[Bucharest]] in March. Vladimirescu agreed to split the country with Ypsilantis, preserving control over Oltenia, Bucharest, and the southern half of [[Muntenia]]. The Pandurs' relationship with the Sacred Band degenerated rapidly, upon revelations that the [[Russian Empire]] had not validated Ypsilantis' expedition, and also over Vladimirescu's attempts to quell Eterist violence. Many of the Arnauts openly or covertly supported Ypsilantis, while others endorsed an independent warlord, [[Sava Fochianos]].

Vladimirescu secretly negotiated an entente with the Ottomans, who ultimately invaded Wallachia in late April. The Pandurs withdrew toward Oltenia, which put them at odds with the Sacred Band. Vladimirescu's brutality alienated his own troops; in turn, this rift allowed the Greek revolutionaries to arrest and execute Vladimirescu, unopposed. The Oltenians scattered, though some Pandurs formed pockets of resistance, led by captains such as [[Dimitrie Macedonski]] and [[Ioan Solomon]]. They suffered clear defeat in their confrontation with the [[Ottoman Army]]. In June, Ypsilantis' force and its remaining Pandur allies were routed [[Battle of Dragashani|at Drăgășani]]. The uprising sparked a cycle of repressive terror, with a final episode in August, when Fochianos and his Arnauts were massacred in Bucharest.

The uprising of 1821 is widely seen as a failed or incomplete social revolution, with more far-reaching political and cultural implications. The Ottoman government registered its anti-Phanariote message, appointing an assimilated boyar, [[Grigore IV Ghica]], as [[Prince of Wallachia]]. The ascent of nationalist boyars was enhanced during the [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russian occupation of 1828]], and cemented by a new constitutional arrangement, ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]''. During this interval, survivors of the uprising split between those who supported this conservative establishment and those who favored [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal causes]]. The latter also helped preserve a heroic image of Vladimirescu, which was later also borrowed by agrarianists and left-wing activists.

==Origins==
===Phanariote crisis===
From the beginning of the 18th-century, Wallachia and [[Moldavia]] (the [[Danubian Principalities]]) had been placed by the [[Sublime Porte]] under a regime of indirect rule through [[Phanariotes]]. This cluster of Greek and [[Hellenization|Hellenized]] families, and the associated [[Greeks in Romania|Greek diaspora]], were conspicuously present at all levels of government. At a more generalized level, the Phanariote era emphasized tensions between the boyars, Phanariote or not, and the peasant class. Though released from serfdom, Romanian peasants were still required to provide for the boyars in [[corvée]]s and [[tithe]]s. Over the early 19th century, the rural economy was often paralyzed by peasant strikes, tax resistance, sabotage, or litigation.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 261–262&lt;/ref&gt; Additional pressures were created by Ottoman demands for the ''[[haraç]]'' and other fiscal duties, which the Phanariotes fulfilled through [[tax farming]]. "Excessive fiscal policies, dictated by both the Ottoman demands and the short span of reigns" meant that Phanariotes treated the principalities as "an actual tenancy."&lt;ref&gt;Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt; The national budget for 1819 was 5.9 million [[thaler]], of which at least 2 million were taken by the [[Sublime Porte]], 1.3 million went to the ruling family, and 2.4 supplied the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt; Although not at their highest historical level, Ottoman pressures had been steadily increasing since ca. 1800.&lt;ref&gt;[[Bogdan Murgescu]], ''România și Europa. Acumularea decalajelor economice (1500–2010)'', pp. 32–37. Iași: [[Polirom]], 2010.  {{ISBN|978-973-46-1665-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tax payers were additionally constrained by those boyars who obtained tax privileges or exemptions for themselves and their families. In 1819, from 194,000 families subject to taxation, 76,000 had been wholly or partly exempted.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 70. See also Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; Tax farmers, in particular the ''[[Ispravnic]]i'', acted in an increasingly predatory manner, and, in various cases, tortured peasants into paying more than their share.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 73–74; Iorga (1921), pp. 326–327 and (1932), pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1800s, a reformist Prince [[Constantine Ypsilantis]] sided with the peasants, cracking down on abuse and even threatening [[Capital punishment in Romania|capital punishment]]; this episode failed to address the causes, and abuses continued to be recorded into the 1810s.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; Under constant fiscal pressure, many villagers resorted to selling their labor to boyars or to peasant entrepreneurs. According to a report by the ''Ispravnic'' of [[Gorj County]], in 1819 migrant farmhands could barely cover their tax debt.&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, pp. 935–936&lt;/ref&gt;

The Phanariotes' hold on the country was nonetheless put into question by various episodes of the previous half-century, and especially by local troubles coinciding with the [[Napoleonic era]]; under the Phanariote regime, Wallachia had dissolved [[Wallachian military forces|her levy army]]. In 1802, the threat of an invasion by Ottoman secessionist [[Osman Pazvantoğlu]] pushed [[Bucharest]] into a panic. At its height, the mercenary [[Sava Fochianos]] and his [[Arnaut]]s denounced their contract and left the city defenseless.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 281–283. See also Maciu, p. 934&lt;/ref&gt; This embarrassment prompted Ypsilantis to form a small national contingent, comprising armed burghers and [[Pandur]]s who were trained by Western standards.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 283, 356; Vârtosu (1962), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt; Especially visible in [[Oltenia]], the Pandurs traced their origins to the late 17th century, and had also functioned as a militia in 1718–1739, when Oltenia was a [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] territory. At times, they had been self-sustaining, with a lifestyle that bordered on ''[[hajduk]]'' brigandage.&lt;ref&gt;Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, pp. 143–144&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Oltenian potecași, ca. 1805 (Vioreștii Slătioarei, Gorunești).png|thumb|300px|Oltenian peasant cavalry, ca. 1805. From a church mural in [[Slătioara, Vâlcea|Slătioara]]]]
Although approved by the Ottomans, this new militia was secretly also a component of Ypsilantis' plan to shake off Ottoman suzerainty with help from the [[Russian Empire]]. By August 1806, his alliance with Russia had been exposed, and he was forced to leave into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 283–284, 295&lt;/ref&gt; The incident also sparked a six-year-long [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russo–Turkish War]]. During this period, the Romanian Pandurs, including a young [[Tudor Vladimirescu]], acted as a unit of the [[Imperial Russian Army]].&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 41; Cernatoni, pp. 40–41; Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, pp. 143–146; Dieaconu, pp. 45, 47; Djuvara, pp. 284–286, 297, 299, 356; Finlay, p. 123; Georgescu, p. 100; Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 12–13; Iorga (1921), pp. XI, 3–4, 189, 232 and (1932), p. 54; Iscru, pp. 678, 680; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 37; Maciu, pp. 936, 939; Nistor, p. 889; Rizos-Nerulos, p. 284; Vârtosu (1945), p. 345 and (1962), pp. 530, 545; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 75–77&lt;/ref&gt; Under Russian occupation, the Greek–Romanian rebel Nicolae Pangal issued several manifestos which, as noted by historian [[Emil Vârtosu]], resembled later appeals by Vladimirescu.&lt;ref&gt;Vârtosu (1962), pp. 533–535, 545&lt;/ref&gt;

Hostilities were eventually suspended by the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1812)|Treaty of Bucharest]], hurried by Russia's need to [[French invasion of Russia|defend herself against the French]];&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 288–289&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman rule in Wallachia and Moldavia was again consolidated with Russia focused on winning a [[War of the Sixth Coalition|war in Central Europe]]. The new Phanariote Prince was [[John Caradja]], whose reign saw an upsurge in tax resistance and ''hajduk'' gang activity. In Bucharest, the epidemic known as [[Caragea's plague]] was an opportunity for marauding gangs of outlaws, who confused the authorities by dressing up as undertakers.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 293–295&lt;/ref&gt; Rebellious activity peaked in Oltenia, where ''hajduks'' were organized by [[Iancu Jianu]], a boyar's son, who frustrated all of Caradja's attempts at restoring order.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 291&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Pandurs were divided. In 1814, some joined a raid by pirates from [[Ada Kaleh]], storming through [[Mehedinți County]] and Gorj, though they later sought forgiveness from Vladimirescu.&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, pp. 936, 940. See also Iscru, pp. 679–680&lt;/ref&gt; The latter had sided with the Caradja regime, but still intervened on their behalf.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 42; Maciu, p. 936&lt;/ref&gt;

===Preparation===
As a result of 1814 riots, tax privileges for the Pandurs were suspended, and they were demoted to the position of a militia assisting the ''Ispravnici''.&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, p. 936&lt;/ref&gt; In 1818, Caradja abandoned his throne and fled Wallachia, leaving [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Sultan]] [[Mahmud II]] to appoint an elderly loyalist, [[Alexandros Soutzos]]. His decision also specified that only four Phanariote families would be eligible for the crowns of either Wallachia and Moldavia: [[Callimachi family|Callimachi]], [[Mourouzis family|Mourouzis]], and two lines of the [[Soutzos family|Soutzos]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 295–296&lt;/ref&gt; Upon entering Bucharest, the new Prince inaugurated a regime of institutional abuse. In April 1819, the attempt to put pressure on the peasantry sparked a riot at [[Islaz]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 42. See also Popp, p. XII&lt;/ref&gt; In one especially controversial writ of 1820, Soutzos ruled that the city of [[Târgoviște]] was not ''[[mortmain]]'', and proclaimed it his family's property. This edict resulted sparked a burgher revolt, during which [[cadastre]] officials were attacked and chased out of Târgoviște.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; Though he still favored the Arnauts,&lt;ref&gt;Nistor, p. 887&lt;/ref&gt; Soutzos revised anti-Pandur persecution, restoring their role in the army and placing them under the command of a Romanian, [[Ioan Solomon]].&lt;ref&gt;Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; His tensions with the Arnauts resulted in a standoff with the mercenaries, who barricaded themselves inside [[Sinaia Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;Dieaconu, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; However, Pandur Mihai Cioranu contends, Wallachia "swarmed with Greeks as never before", with every military commission set aside to serve "the Prince and his Greeks".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 228–229&lt;/ref&gt;

Soutzos' other conflict was with the lesser Phanariotes, who were now won over by [[Greek nationalism]]. In 1820, [[Alexander Ypsilantis]], son of Prince Constantine, united the various branches of the [[Filiki Eteria]], a Greek revolutionary organization, and began preparing a [[Greek War of Independence|massive anti-Ottoman revolt]] from the Russian port city of [[Odessa]]. This society had already managed to enlist in its ranks some preeminent Romanian boyars: allegedly, its first recruits included [[Alecu Filipescu-Vulpea]], joined later by [[Grigore Brâncoveanu]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 74–75. See also Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt; According to one account, the Eterists also invited Soutzos to join the conspiracy, but he refused.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 296; Iorga (1921), pp. 353–354&lt;/ref&gt; He died suddenly on January 19, 1821, prompting speculation that he had been poisoned by Ypsilantis' partisans.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 296; Finlay, p. 118; Georgescu, p. 97; Iorga (1921), pp. 231, 353–354 and (1932), pp. 24, 25; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 37, 227; Papacostea, p. 10; Potra (1963), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

In Wallachia, Ypsilantis' cause had significant allies: the country's three main regents (or ''[[Caimacam]]i'')—Brâncoveanu, [[Grigore IV Ghica|Grigore Ghica]], [[Barbu Văcărescu]]—were all secretly members of the Eteria.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 297&lt;/ref&gt; They contacted Vladimirescu with a mission to revive the national army and align it with Ypsilantis' movement.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 43; Djuvara, p. 297; Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; However, other records suggest that Vladimirescu acted independently of the regents. He was located in Bucharest in November 1820, and was in direct contact with the Eterist leadership through various channels. Within two months, he had reportedly sealed a pact with two of Ypsilantis' agents, [[Giorgakis Olympios]] and [[Yiannis Pharmakis]], who were also officers in Soutzos' Arnaut guard, and had borrowed 20,000 thaler from another Eterist, [[Pavel Macedonski]], "to provide for the coming revolt."&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, pp. 42–43. See also Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 12–14; Rizos-Nerulos, p. 284; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 74, 82–84&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, according to historian Vasile Maciu, the convention between Vladimirescu and his Eterist colleagues survives only in an unreliable translation, which may be entirely fabricated.&lt;ref name="Maciu, p. 946"&gt;Maciu, p. 946&lt;/ref&gt; The Russian Consul in Wallachia, Alexander Pini, is viewed as a neutral player by scholar [[Barbara Jelavich]],&lt;ref&gt;Jelavich, pp. 22, 24, 302&lt;/ref&gt; but he too may have been involved on the Eterist side. This was attested by Pini's Moldavian secretary, Ștefan Scarlat Dăscălescu, who attributes the revolt initiative to "the leaders of the Greek revolution and Mr. Pini",&lt;ref&gt;Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 40–41&lt;/ref&gt; and dismisses Vladimirescu as a "Russian creature".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1932), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; However, a letter from Tudor to Pini refutes any conscious cooperation between the two men.&lt;ref&gt;Iscru, pp. 684–686&lt;/ref&gt;

According to information gathered by the Russian spy [[Ivan Liprandi]], Vladimirescu was also promised full adherence by the leading 77 boyars of the country, their pledge eventually issued as a formal writ and presented on their behalf by [[Dinicu Golescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 77–79, 81&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimirescu may have used this binding document as a collateral, allowing him to borrow 40,000 more thaler from [[Matija Nenadović]].&lt;ref name="Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 79"&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; Liprandi also notes that the Pandur leader was already in contact with [[Ilarion Gheorghiadis]], the [[Archdiocese of Argeș and Muscel|Bishop of Argeș]], who helped him define his international diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 74, 77&lt;/ref&gt; In the days before Soutzos' death, Vladimirescu had been spotted at [[Pitești]], moving into Oltenia with some 40 Arnauts.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 43; Gârleanu, pp. 57–58; Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 14, 40; Iorga (1921), pp. 4–5, 233, 356 and (1932), pp. 27, 53; Popa &amp; Dicu, pp. 98–99; Potra (1963), p. 64; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 78. See also Georgescu, pp. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt; He traveled under an innocuous pretext, claiming to be heading for his Gugiu estate in [[Gorj County]], to settle a land dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Gârleanu, pp. 57–58; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Revolutionary ideology==
===National and social ideas===
[[File:Justiția (Petru Maior, Istoria pentru începuturi a Românilor în Dachia).svg|thumb|370px|Personification of Justice, illustration to [[Petru Maior]]'s ''Istoria pentru începuturi a Românilor în Dachia'', [[Buda]], 1812]]
While various researchers agree that Vladimirescu and his Pandurs were motivated by a nationalist ideology, its outline and implications remain debated among scholars. Social historians [[Ioan C. Filitti]] and [[Vlad Georgescu]] both argue that as a nationalist, Vladimirescu had short-term and long-term agendas: demands of recognition from the Porte, and for the restoration of ancient liberties, were only instrumental to a larger goal, which was national liberation with Russian assistance.&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, pp. 102–103; Maciu, p. 933&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicolae Iorga]] views the Pandur leader as taking "one step forward" in the development of nationalist discourse, by introducing references to the [[general will]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. XII–XIV&lt;/ref&gt; Nicolae Liu also notes that the "pragmatic" rebel "made no reference to [[natural rights]], but tacitly included them as the basis of his revolutionary program"; this notion was an import from [[French Revolution|Revolutionary France]], along with the Pandurs' concept of the [[Levée en masse|people-in-arms]].&lt;ref&gt;Liu, pp. 298–300&lt;/ref&gt; Sociolinguist Klaus Bochmann identifies the 1821 documents, including those issued "in the entourage of Tudor Vladimirescu" and those of his adversaries, as the first Romanian-language references to "patriotism"—and possibly as the first-ever records of a "political debate being carried out (mainly) in Romanian."&lt;ref&gt;Bochmann, p. 107&lt;/ref&gt; He underscores the ideological influence of [[Josephinism]], noting that it came to Vladimirescu through his contacts with educator [[Gheorghe Lazăr]];&lt;ref&gt;Bochmann, pp. 107–108&lt;/ref&gt; other reports suggest that Vladimirescu was informed about the ideology of the [[Transylvanian School]], having read [[Petru Maior]].&lt;ref&gt;Iscru, pp. 682–683&lt;/ref&gt;

During the actual events of the uprising, Western sources began drawing parallels between Vladimirescu and historical peasant rebels, in particular [[Wat Tyler]] and [[Vasile Ursu Nicola|Horea]].&lt;ref&gt;Șerban, pp. 282–283&lt;/ref&gt; Various authors propose that Vladimirescu and his men were not only nationalists, but also had a core interest in social revolution, seeing it as their mission to supplant or control boyardom. Thus, historian Gheorghe Potra describes Tudor's rising as primarily "anti-feudal", with a "national character" in that it also aimed to shake off "the Turkish yoke".&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; As summarized by historian [[Neagu Djuvara]], the Pandur revolt was originally "set out against all the nation's plunderers", but then "became a peasants' revolt which did not separate 'good' and 'bad' boyars, locals from foreigners. Nevertheless, in order to reach his goal, Tudor had no choice but to reach an agreement with the 'nationalist' boyars [...] as well as with Turkish power, [and] he resorted, at a later stage, to making his revolution into a fundamentally anti-Phanariote one."&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; Another ideological difference was that between Vladimirescu's [[Russophilia]], a minority opinion, and the mounting [[Anti-Russian sentiment|Russophobia]] of both upper- and middle-class nationalists.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 285–286, 289, 297&lt;/ref&gt;

Iorga proposes that Vladimirescu tried his best to establish a "democratic companionship" of Romanians, hoping to draw a wedge between Romanian and Greek boyars.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. VIII&lt;/ref&gt; Among the left-wing scholars, [[Andrei Oțetea]] argues that Vladimirescu slowly abandoned the peasant cause and fell into a "complete and humiliating subordination to the boyars."&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, p. 933&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels' anti-boyar discourse was mitigated by other factors. One was the issue of their leader's own social standing: though originating from a clan of Oltenian peasants, Vladimirescu had been accepted into the third-class boyardom, with the rank of ''[[Sluger]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 136, 228, 297, 299–300; Maciu, pp. 941, 944; Theodorescu, p. 221. See also Cernatoni, pp. 40–41, 46&lt;/ref&gt; Cultural historian [[Răzvan Theodorescu]] argues that he, the rebel leader, actually belonged to a "rural bourgeoisie" which kept genealogies and had an "unexpected" taste for heraldry.&lt;ref&gt;Theodorescu, pp. 208–209&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars also make note of Vladimirescu's elitist tastes and habits, his refusal to sanction retribution against the boyars, and his crushing of peasant radicalism during his seizure in power.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 300; Georgescu, pp. 100, 103; Iorga (1932), pp. 27, 51; Iscru, pp. 676–680; Maciu, p. 941&lt;/ref&gt; It is also probable that Vladimirescu intended to have himself recognized as Prince, as evidenced by his wearing a white ''[[kalpak]]'', traditionally reserved for royalty.&lt;ref&gt;Dima ''et al.'', p. 132; Djuvara, p. 300; Georgescu, p. 103; Iorga (1932), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; His subordinates often referred to him as ''Domnul Tudor'', which also indicated monarchic ambitions ''(see [[Domnitor]])''.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 300; Iorga (1921), pp. IX–X, 61; Maciu, p. 945&lt;/ref&gt; The Italian press of his day viewed him as Wallachia's ''[[Duce]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Șerban, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pro- and anti-Greek===
Another fluctuating trait of Vladimirescu's revolt was his attitude toward [[Greek nationalism]]. According to Iorga, Phanariote rule meant a "system of indissoluble elements", centered on [[Hellenism (neoclassicism)|Hellenism]] and [[Hellenization]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. VII–VIII&lt;/ref&gt; Maciu further notes that Phanariote rulers had stunted Romanian nationalism and [[National awakening of Romania|national awakening]] by popularizing an [[Eastern Orthodox church|Eastern Orthodox]] identity, common to Romanians and Greeks; this established a pattern of cooperation, pushing nationalists of various ethnicities into contact with each other.&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, pp. 934, 937–939, 945, 947–948&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, Vârtosu argues, the rebellion was not xenophobic, but protectionist: Vladimirescu favored the "uplift of the native people", but also addressed his to proclamation to a larger "human kin". His white-and-blue banner had both familiar symbols of Christian tradition, which "drenched [the message] in the theological coloring of religious faith", and verse which described the "Romanian Nation".&lt;ref&gt;Vârtosu (1945), pp. 345–346&lt;/ref&gt; In a [[Balkans]] context, Vladimirescu felt most sympathy toward the [[Serbian Revolution]], having had direct contacts with [[Karađorđe]],&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 298; Iorga (1921), pp. X–XII&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The Public Ledger]]'' even speculated that he was himself a Serb.&lt;ref&gt;Șerban, pp. 279–280&lt;/ref&gt; Affiliates of the Pandur revolt also included [[Naum Veqilharxhi]], who published what may be the first manifesto of [[Albanian nationalism]].&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Chiachir, Gelcu Maksutovici, "Orașul București, centru de sprijin al mișcării de eliberare din Balcani (1848—1912)", in ''București. Materiale de Istorie și Muzeografie'', Vol. 5, 1967, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;

In this setting, however, Vladimirescu "had no particular reason to hold the Phanariote [Ypsilantis] dear",&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p. 298"&gt;Djuvara, p. 298&lt;/ref&gt; and the ideals of Orthodox universalism, "subordinating [Romanian] aspirations", were viewed with generalized suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;Palade, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt; As historians note, Vladimirescu "would have liked to rid the country of both the Greeks and the Turks",&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 299&lt;/ref&gt; viewing the former with "strong aversion", as the "agents of Turkish oppression in his country."&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; Ottomanist [[Kemal Karpat]] suggests that: "[In] Turkish sources [...] Vladimirescu's revolt is interpreted as a local uprising aimed chiefly at the protection of the local population against Greek exploitation"; a "long accepted version was that Vladimirescu rebelled against the Greeks without even being aware that [Ypsilantis], the Greek revolutionary, had risen against the Sultan in Russia."&lt;ref&gt;Karpat, pp. 406–407&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, Dăscălescu proposes that the rebellion was originally anti-Turkish and pro-Greek, but that Vladimirescu had no way of winning over Oltenians with that message.&lt;ref&gt;Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 40–43; Iorga (1932), pp. 53–54&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Oțetea writes that the Pandur movement cannot be separated from the Eteria, who gave it "a chief, a program, a structure, the original impulse, tactics for propaganda and combat, [and] the first means of achieving its goals".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; Oțetea also claims that Vladimirescu was indirectly influenced by the political vision of [[Rigas Feraios]], though this verdict remains disputed.&lt;ref&gt;Nestor Camariano, "Rhigas Velestinlis. Complètements et corrections concernant sa vie et son activité", in ''Revue des Études Sud-est Européennes'', Vol. XVIII, Issue 4, October–December 1980, pp. 704–705&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Eterist perspective, sending Vladimirescu to Oltenia was a cover-up for the Greek insurrection—a ruse that had been conceived by Olympios and merely approved by "Tudor Vladimirescu, his friend".&lt;ref&gt;Rizos-Nerulos, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; Seen by some commentators, and probably by Ypsilantis himself, as an actual member of the Eteria,&lt;ref&gt;Dieaconu, pp. 47–48; Djuvara, pp. 297, 298; Finlay, pp. 122, 123; Maciu, p. 936; Palade, p. 36; Rizos-Nerulos, p. 284; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimirescu endorsed the conspiracy in the belief that it had Russian support. However, in early 1821 the [[Congress of Laibach]] condemned the Greek revolution, imposing on [[Emperor of All Russia|Emperor]] [[Alexander I of Russia|Alexander I]] that he withdraw all endorsement for Ypsilantis' movement.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 296–297; Finlay, pp. 126–128; Georgescu, pp. 102–103; Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 11, 16–17, 40–41; Iorga (1921), pp. 191–192, 266, 269–272 and (1932), pp. 26, 58; Jelavich, pp. 23–24; Liu,  pp. 300–301; Maciu, p. 944; Palade, pp. 39–40; Rizos-Nerulos, p. 310; Șerban, p. 285. See also van Meurs, pp. 48–49; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; Ypsilantis prolonged his other alliance, with Vladimirescu, only by playing upon words, not revealing to him that Russia's support remained uncertain.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 298; Finlay, pp. 126–128; Iorga (1921), pp. 190, 266–268, 336–337, 362; Maciu, p. 944&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladimirescu made his first Oltenian stop at [[Ocnele Mari]], then moved in on the Gorj capital, [[Târgu Jiu]], where he stayed at the house of a tax farmer, Vasile Moangă (or Mongescu).&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 4–5, 233&lt;/ref&gt; His first action as a rebel was to arrest or take hostage the local ''Ispavnic'', Dinicu Otetelișanu, on January 21.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 43; Gârleanu, p. 58; Iorga (1921), pp. 5–6, 10, 13, 233–234, 245, 356; Potra (1963), p. 64&lt;/ref&gt; On January 22, he and his Arnaut guard captured [[Tismana Monastery]], turning it into a rallying point and prison.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 43; Gârleanu, pp. 58, 60; Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 14, 15; Iorga (1921), pp. 6–7, 10, 189, 216–217, 233–234, 241, 245&lt;/ref&gt; A day later, at [[Padeș]], Vladimirescu issued a proclamation mixing social and patriotic slogans. It marked his ideological dissidence, proclaiming the right of peasants to "meet evil with evil".&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 43; Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, p. 147; Gârleanu, p. 59; Iorga (1921), pp. 6–7; Jelavich, p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Written in a "vigorously biblical style",&lt;ref&gt;Theodorescu, p. 221&lt;/ref&gt; it called into existence an "Assembly of the People", which was to "hit the snake on the head with a cane", ensuring that "good things come about".&lt;ref&gt;Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, p. 147; Gârleanu, p. 59; Iorga (1921), pp. 6–7, 234–235. See also Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; In a parallel letter to the Sultan, Vladimirescu also insisted that his was an anti-boyar, rather than anti-Ottoman, uprising.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 43; Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 15; Iorga (1921), pp. 7–10, 189–190, 238–241, 329–330; Jelavich, p. 23; Maciu, pp. 942–943, 945, 947; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; The response was positive on the Ottoman side.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of preparing his submission to Ypsilantis, he then began his march on [[Mehedinți County]], passing through [[Broșteni, Mehedinți|Broșteni]], [[Șimian, Mehedinți|Cerneți]], and [[Strehaia]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, pp. 43–44; Iorga (1921), pp. 10–24&lt;/ref&gt; By January 29, boyars and merchants evacuated Mehedinți; this movement was mirrored by a similar exodus from [[Craiova]], the Oltenian capital.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 12–13, 24–28, 40–42, 330–331; Potra (1963), p. 64. See also Iorga, (1932), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Boyars who stayed behind surrendered to Vladimirescu and took an oath of allegiance, becoming known to the Pandurs as ''făgăduiți'' ("pledged ones"). Members of this category, though they enjoyed Vladimirescu's personal protection,&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, p. 942; Vârtosu (1945), p. 347&lt;/ref&gt; signed secret letters of protest to the Sultan, calling for his intervention against the "brigands".&lt;ref name="Cernatoni, p. 44"&gt;Cernatoni, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; In February, after Vladimirescu had conquered the town of [[Motru]], boyars still present in Craiova petitioned the Ottomans and Russians for help. Consul Pini approved their request to use force against Vladimirescu, but refused to commit Russian troops for that purpose.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 24–30; Potra (1963), pp. 64–65&lt;/ref&gt;

Reassured by Pini, the regents began amassing an Arnaut resistance to the rebellion, with individual units led by Dumitrachi Bibescu, ''[[Sardar|Serdar]]'' [[Diamandi Djuvara]], ''Deli-bașa'' Mihali, Pharmakis, [[Hadži-Prodan]], and [[Ioan Solomon]]. Though there were violent clashes between the two sides at Motru, many of the loyalist troops voluntarily surrendered to the Pandurs, after parleying with Pandur agent [[Dimitrie Macedonski]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 13–18, 24, 34–41, 236–238, 241–246, 330–332, 357–358. See also Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, pp. 148, 152; Dieaconu, p. 48; Iorga  (1932), p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with such insuburdionation, ''Caimacam'' Brâncoveanu reportedly maintained his calm and demanded to know Vladimirescu's grievances. Through his Macedonski associates, the rebel leader asked for a unification of boyar parties around his revolutionary goal, which included solving the peasant issue, and ordered them to disband the Arnaut corps.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 34–37; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 79–80&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the peasantry responded to the proclamation of Padeș by organizing into a string a small uprisings. Some happened in Pandur strongholds, as during Dumitru Gârbea's raid on [[Baia de Aramă]], while others took root in more distant villages, such as [[Bârca]] and [[Radovanu]].&lt;ref name="Gârleanu, p. 60"&gt;Gârleanu, p. 60&lt;/ref&gt; A Captain Ivanciu took control of Pitești and raided the surrounding villages.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; In other areas, there were highway robberies organized by Romanian peasants or [[Slavery in Romania|slaves]] of [[Roma minority in Romania|Romani]] origin. Such incidents happened in [[Slănic]], [[Urziceni]], or at [[Nucet Monastery]].&lt;ref&gt;Dieaconu, pp. 47, 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 4, the Pandurs were again camped in Gorj, at [[Țânțăreni, Gorj|Țânțăreni]]. Here, his army grew massively, to about 4,000 infantrymen and 500 horsemen.&lt;ref&gt;Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, pp. 148–150&lt;/ref&gt; The Macedonskis recount that Vladimirescu was awaiting for the boyars to follow his orders and unite under his command, but that this demand was in fact unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 80–81"&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; While waiting in Țânțăreni, Vladimirescu provided his response to the [[Sfatul boieresc|Boyar Divan]], whose leadership had asked not to engage in activity "harmful for the country". Vladimirescu presented himself as a "caretaker" of the state—one elected by the people to review the "awful tyranny" of boyars, but without toppling the regime.&lt;ref name="Cernatoni, p. 44"/&gt; A boyars' delegation, led by ''[[Vornic]]'' Nicolae Văcărescu, traveled to Vladimirescu's camp on February 11. It asked of the Pandurs that they refrain from marching on Bucharest, and appealed to their patriotic sentiments. To this, Vladimirescu replied that his conception of the motherland was fundamentally different: "the people, and not the Coterie of plunderers" (or "robber class").&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 44; Djuvara, pp. 297–298; Georgescu, p. 118; Iorga (1921), pp. 46–47; Liu, p. 299. See also Bochmann, pp. 108–111; Maciu, p. 943; Popp, p. XIII&lt;/ref&gt; Though he thus restated his generic dislike for the boyars, Vladimirescu also reassured Văcărescu that he did not "wish any harm to this Coterie", and "even more so I want to complete and strengthen its privileges."&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 297; Iorga (1921), pp. 47–48&lt;/ref&gt;

===Army creation===
Văcărescu was immediately replaced with Constantin Samurcaș, who was an Eterist agent, and favored bribing the Pandurs into submission. He offered Vladimirescu a pardon and a large tribute collected from the citizens of Craiova,&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 45–52, 54, 247, 331–332&lt;/ref&gt; allegedly sending Hadži-Prodan to Țânțăreni, with 90,000 thaler as a gift.&lt;ref name="Cernatoni, p. 44"/&gt; According to at least one account, Samurcaș also prepared Arnaut troops, under Solomon and Djuvara, for a surprise attack on Vladimirescu's quarters.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 48–51, 244–247, 331&lt;/ref&gt; Prodan himself recounted that had secret orders to kill Vladimirescu, but disobeyed and defected to the Pandur side.&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, p. 943&lt;/ref&gt; Contrarily, anti-Greek authors view Prodan as a double agent of the Eteria, infiltrated alongside Dimitrie Macedonski.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 240–241, 257, 269, 289–290, 331&lt;/ref&gt; In recounting this episode, Liprandi claims that Vladimirescu turned tables and unexpectedly handed Samurcaș a list of boyars and notabilities that he wanted executed. Names reportedly included [[Dionisie Lupu]], [[Metropolis of Muntenia and Dobrudja|Metropolitan of Wallachia]].&lt;ref name="Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 80"&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, ''Caimacam'' Văcărescu wrote to promise Vladimirescu 250,000 thaler as additional aid, but, according to Liprandi, also demanded that the Pandurs arrest and kill Samurcaș, the "enemy of [our] cause".&lt;ref name="Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 80"/&gt;

The Pandurs had been joined by packs of Oltenian ''hajduks'', including the already famous [[Iancu Jianu]], and by a small selection of young boyars, including Ioan Urdăreanu&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 291, 299&lt;/ref&gt; and a group of scribes: [[Petrache Poenaru]], Ioniță Dârzeanu, and Dumitrache Protopopescu.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), pp. V, 4–5, 63–69&lt;/ref&gt; It remains uncertain whether [[Gheorghe Magheru]], a scion of the boyar clan in [[Albeni]], was also a volunteer Pandur in 1821.&lt;ref name="idsmagh"&gt;I. D. Suciu, "Recenzii. Apostol Stan, Constantin Vlăduț, ''Gheorghe Magheru''", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. 23, Issue 6, 1970, p. 1248&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimirescu still persecuted exponents of the old regime, having tax farmer Pau Nicolicescu put to death at Strehaia.&lt;ref&gt;Gârleanu, p. 60; Iorga (1921), pp. 10–13&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, he allowed other known exploiters, including Ghiță Cuțui, to join his rebel army.&lt;ref name="Gârleanu, p. 60"/&gt; It is statistically probable that more than half of his army captaincies were held by third-class boyars.&lt;ref name="Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, p. 150"&gt;Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt;

The native Oltenian core was supplemented by Romanian peasants migrating from the [[Principality of Transylvania (1711–1867)|Principality of Transylvania]], which was part of the [[Austrian Empire]];&lt;ref name="Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, p. 150"/&gt; and from the [[Silistra Eyalet]] (Ottoman [[Dobruja]]).&lt;ref&gt;Radu Ștefan Ciobanu, "Evoluția ideii de independență la românii dobrogeni între revoluția condusă de Tudor Vladimirescu și războiul pentru neatîrnarea neamului (1821—1877)", in ''Muzeul Național'', Vol. VI, 1982, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; There were also massive arrivals of other Balkan ethnicities. The cavalry in particular was staffed by foreign volunteers, mainly Arnauts and [[Serbs in Romania|Serbs]].&lt;ref&gt;Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, pp. 149–150; Djuvara, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt; The command core had Greek, Serb, [[Aromanians|Aromanian]] and [[Bulgarians in Romania|Bulgarian]] officers, whose primary loyalty was to the Eteria. They included Olympios, Pharmakis, Prodan, ''Serdar'' Djuvara, and Macedonski.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 300. See also Dieaconu, pp. 47–50; Maciu, pp. 947–948&lt;/ref&gt; The anonymous chronicle ''Istoria jăfuitorilor'' additionally notes that Vladimirescu's core units were staffed with veterans of Karađorđe's armies, including Pharmakis, Mihali, and [[Tudor Ghencea]]; others who had served with [[Ali Pasha of Ioannina]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 328–329&lt;/ref&gt; European journals also recorded the recruitment of Greeks from [[German Confederation|Germany]], and the presence of former officers from the ''[[Grande Armée]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Șerban, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vladimirescu's uprising, 1821.svg|thumb|400px|Map of Vladimirescu and Ypsilantis' marches on Bucharest]]
Tensions between these figures and their Oltenian commander were visible in February, when Vladimirescu put a stop to Prodan and Macedonski's sacking of the Otetelișanu manor in [[Bălcești|Benești]].&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), p. 65. See also Maciu, p. 941&lt;/ref&gt; According to Liprandi, Olympios was always a liability in Vladimirescu's camp, manipulating both him and Ypsilantis for material gain.&lt;ref&gt;Gârleanu, p. 57; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 82–84&lt;/ref&gt; Olympios also tested Vladimirescu by rescuing and protecting a renegade Pandur, Grigore Cârjaliul, and by murdering some of the prisoners held at Tismana.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 58, 216–217. See also Dieaconu, pp. 48, 49&lt;/ref&gt; Pharmakis, who commanded over his own cohort of "400 [[Albanians in Romania|Albanians]]", also acted independently, shielding from persecutions the boyars Lăcusteanu.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 37–38&lt;/ref&gt; For his part, Vladimirescu protected the [[Dinicu Golescu]] and his family, ordering his troops to release [[Iordache Golescu|Iordache]]. The latter was then given a Pandur guard which escorted him to Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Popp, p. V&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 23, Bucharest went through another regime change. Brâncoveanu secretly left Bucharest and crossed into Transylvania, settling in the border city of [[Brașov|Corona (Brașov)]]. His departure created another panic, stoked by the Arnauts. Olympios and Pharmakis returned to the capital and took control of its garrison, also raiding Târgoviște, [[Găești]], and [[Băicoi]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 53–55, 333–334&lt;/ref&gt; The Sultan selected a new Prince, [[Scarlat Callimachi (hospodar)|Scarlat Callimachi]], who refused to abandon Ottoman safety for his throne. Instead, Callimachi appointed a new triumvirate of ''Caimacami'', presided upon by [[Stefan Bogoridi]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 45; Iorga (1921), pp. 246–249, 256–257, 333–334, 338–339 and (1932), p. 28; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt; This interval also marked the return to Bucharest of [[Sava Fochianos]], whom Callimachi had created a ''[[Binbashi]]'' of his own Arnaut garrison.&lt;ref&gt;Finlay, pp. 122–123; Iorga (1921), pp. 256–257, 334, 335&lt;/ref&gt;

In parallel, the Eterist uprising began with a revolt of the [[Moldavian military forces]] in [[Galați]] and a pogrom of the [[Turks in Romania|local Turks]], both staged by [[Vasileios Karavias]].&lt;ref&gt;Ardeleanu, pp. 144–149; Dieaconu, pp. 46–47; Finlay, pp. 117–122; Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 16, 21–24; Iorga (1921), p. 332; Rizos-Nerulos, pp. 288–289. See also Cochran, p. 312; Jelavich, p. 25; Șerban, p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; Organized militarily as a "[[Sacred Band (1821)|Sacred Band]]", the Eterists occupied Moldavia in the last week of February, and issued manifestos calling on all [[Christianity in the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman Christians]] to join them.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 296&lt;/ref&gt; A military government was created in [[Iași]], under a General Pendidekas.&lt;ref&gt;Ardeleanu, pp. 154, 159; Iorga (1921), p. 266&lt;/ref&gt; This was the starting point of an exodus of locals from the country, with some pockets of anti-Eterist resistance. Overall, Moldavian boyars were shocked by Karavias' violence;&lt;ref&gt;Ardeleanu, pp. 148–149&lt;/ref&gt; the native population at large was anti-Greek by virtue of being anti-Phanariote, and only a few thousand Moldavians ever joined the Sacred Band.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 297; Finlay, p. 122&lt;/ref&gt;

===Taking Bucharest===
In Wallachia, the combined Pandur–Arnaut force also began moving on Bucharest, taking [[Slătioara, Olt|Slătioara]] on March 4. Callimachi's regency also sought to coax Vladimirescu into submission, but he ignored the offer, and, instigated by the Macedonskis, prepared a Pandur conquest of Wallachia.&lt;ref name="Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 80–81"/&gt; He then addressed the ''Caimacami'' a five-point ultimatum, which called for the removal of Phanariotes, the reestablishment of a levy army, tax relief, as well as 500,000 thaler for Vladimirescu's expenses.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 246–247&lt;/ref&gt; A document formulated as ''Cererile norodului românesc'' ("Demands of the Romanian People") also specified a [[racial quota]] in assigning [[Historical Romanian ranks and titles|boyar offices and titles]], and more generically a [[meritocracy]]. The main tax was kept, but reduced and divided into quarterly installments.&lt;ref&gt;Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 16. See also Liu, p. 300; Vârtosu (1945), pp. 344–345&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerical estimates of Vladimirescu's force vary significantly. Some authors count 8,000 soldiers (6,000 Oltenian infantrymen, 2,000 Balkan cavalry),&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 45; Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, p. 153. See also Djuvara, p. 297; Jelavich, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt; while others advance the number to 10,000,&lt;ref name="Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 79"/&gt; 14,000,&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1932), p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; or 24,000.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. 363&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cioranu, in all Vladimirescu's army comprised 20,000 men: of his 12,000 Pandurs, 6,000 had been left at forts in Oltenia, including troops under ''Serdar'' Djuvara, Solomon, and Moangă; 8,000 Arnauts "of various races", mostly Serbs from Karađorđe's army, of whom only 2,500 were available for combat.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 254–255, 257–259, 290&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimirescu himself claimed to have at least 12,000 men under arms, while conservative estimates lower that number to 4,000 or 5,000.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 189–190, 260–261, 334, 363&lt;/ref&gt; These troops were also backed by a cell of artillery personnel. According to various counts, they had five to eight cannons, of which two were smaller in size.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 203, 255, 257, 268, 290, 337, 363, 364&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pandurs' march came with a recruitment drive. For instance, Solomon's auxiliary force held Craiova, where they began signing up burghers.&lt;ref name="Cernatoni, p. 45"&gt;Cernatoni, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Pitești, which had strategic importance, was secured on March 7, and placed under Captain Simion Mehedințeanu. Pandur recruitment largely failed here, but the townsfolk pledged their material support.&lt;ref&gt;Popa &amp; Dicu, pp. 98–100&lt;/ref&gt; The hostile narrator of ''Istoria jăfuitorilor'' also claims that Vladimirescu was expected in Bucharest by a [[fifth column]], comprising "vagabonds, foreigners, Serbian, Arnaut or Bulgarian thieves, and all those Bucharest panhandlers that we mockingly call ''crai'' [kings]".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; The breakdown of Phanariote power accelerated crossovers by the Arnauts, who were no longer receiving salaries from the treasury.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 57, 331&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimirescu himself separated between loyal and disloyal Arnauts. At [[Slatina, Romania|Slatina]], he had established a 40-men Serb "killing guard", possibly led led by Chiriac Popescu. Its first mission was to assassinate Arnaut leaders who had engaged in looting.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 257–259, 358–359. See also Iscru, p. 676&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 10, the rebels crossed the [[Olt River]], marched through [[Șerbănești]] and [[Ciolănești]], then settled camp at [[Bucșani, Giurgiu|Vadu-Lat]].&lt;ref name="Cernatoni, p. 45"/&gt; Ostensibly to "unite with Vladimirescu",&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, p. 313&lt;/ref&gt; the Sacred Band crossed the [[Milcov River (Siret)|Milcov]] into Wallachia, with Ypsilantis reassuring locals that he would maintain good governance in the places he occupied and would not tolerate any violence against them.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, pp. 45, 46; Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 24–25; Iorga (1921), pp. 52, 55–57, 59, 250–252, 266&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Vladimirescu sent him letters asking him to withdraw, but these reached Ypsilantis when he was already in [[Ploiești]].&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 84. See also Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 23–24, 25&lt;/ref&gt; While camped there, the Sacred Band organized a military government, comprising Greeks and Romanian Eterists. Going against Ypsilantis' earlier promises, it staged raids on civilians and multiple confiscations of property.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 59–61&lt;/ref&gt; As Cioranu notes, "Romanians never even wanted to hear [Ypsilantis' proclamations], let alone fight under his banner."&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

The unexpected double invasion alarmed the Divan. Most boyars refused to trust in Vladimirescu's assurances, and fled Bucharest for safety in Transylvania or the countryside, although Olympios and Pharmakis tried to intercept them at [[Cotroceni]] and [[Ciorogârla]].&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, pp. 45, 50; Iorga (1921), pp. 53–54, 55, 57–60, 65–66, 255–257, 266, 332–333, 361, 363. See also Dieaconu, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; A new regency took over, with Metropolitan Dionisie at its helm; ministers included [[Alecu Filipescu-Vulpea]], Fotachi Știrbei, and Grigore Băleanu.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 57–58, 74, 255–257&lt;/ref&gt; The main Pandur force took possession of [[Bolintin-Vale|Bolintin]] on March 16, sending out patrols to take Cotroceni and [[Colentina, Bucharest|Colentina]]. At Bolintin, Vladimirescu issued his appeal to Bucharesters, informing them that they had nothing to fear once they took up his cause, the cause "of Christendom".&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, pp. 45–46; Iorga (1921), pp. 260–261, 386–387&lt;/ref&gt; He disavowed the exiled boyars, accusing them of having made common cause with the Phanariotes.&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, pp. 943–944&lt;/ref&gt; A second proclamation on March 20 was a call to national unity, "for we are all parts of the same people".&lt;ref name="Cernatoni, p. 46"&gt;Cernatoni, p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; It showed his belief in [[class collaboration]], but also, again, his ambition to stand as a national leader, governing for the benefit of the dispossessed.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 263–265; Maciu, p. 942&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bucharest under Vladimirescu.svg|thumb|380px|Map of Bucharest and its wards ("colors") under Tudor Vladimirescu; showing quarters of Vladimirescu and Ypsilantis' respective armies, Orthodox monasteries, and Belvedere manor]]
The Pandurs slowly approached Bucharest from the west. According to one oral tradition, Vladimirescu set up another camp in Cotroceni, his tent planted in the exact spot where physician [[Carol Davila]] was later buried.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Cernovodeanu, Nicolae Vătămanu, "Considerații asupra 'calicilor' bucureșteni în veacurile al XVII-lea și al XVIII-lea. Cîteva identificări topografice legate de așezările lor", in ''București. Materiale de Istorie și Muzeografie'', Vol. III, 1965, p. 38&lt;/ref&gt; On March 21, the rebel army finally marched into the Romanian capital. The rebel column, followed by a mass of city-dwellers, walked through the borough later known as [[Rahova]]. The procession was led on by an ensign with Vladimirescu's banner of white and blue; Vladimirescu himself held a loaf of bread, to signal prosperity.&lt;ref&gt;Ciobotea &amp; Osiac, p. 153&lt;/ref&gt; Upon reaching [[Dealul Mitropoliei]], he requisitioned the home of [[Zoe Brâncoveanu]], turning it into his temporary residence.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 46; Iorga (1921), pp. 58, 261–262, 335, 359–360&lt;/ref&gt; He and his army were welcomed by Metropolitan Dionisie, who now expressed his "great joy".&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Those boyars still present in the city proclaimed Vladimirescu's movement to be "useful and redeeming for the people", recognizing him as governor and taking an oath to support him.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 46; Maciu, pp. 944–945&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, the Arnaut garrison, supporting Fochianos, occupied the [[Romanian Patriarchal Cathedral|Metropolitan Church]] and [[Radu Vodă Monastery]], defying the Pandurs and shooting at them as they approached.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 58, 262–263, 335–336 and (1932), p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The standoff was ended after friendly negotiations between Fochianos and Vladimirescu, resulting in a ceasefire; Fochianos recognized Vladimirescu's executive and judicial authority over Wallachia.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 335–336&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conflict with Ypsilantis===
Meanwhile, the Sacred Band, under Ypsilantis, had also reached the area, and remained camped outside the city. The two armies "observed each other, without merging into one another; the fundamental contradiction of [their] alliance was becoming more and more apparent".&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p. 298"/&gt; The Eterists pressed on to be allowed entry into Bucharest, but Vladimirescu only offered them a deserted [[Ghica family]] manor in Colentina, outside city limits.&lt;ref name="Cernatoni, p. 46"/&gt; Ypsilantis and his staff were allowed to visit the city, but found themselves ridiculed by anti-Greek locals, who called theirs an army of "pie-makers".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. 266; Papacostea, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; On March 25, Ypsilantis and Vladimirescu had their first meeting. Though they immediately disliked each other, they agreed to a partition of Wallachia: Vladimirescu held on to Oltenia, Bucharest, and southern [[Muntenia]] (comprising the [[Wallachian Plain]]), while the Sacred Band moved into the Muntenian stretch of the [[Southern Carpathians]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 298; Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 17; Iorga (1921), p. 338. See also Georgescu, p. 103&lt;/ref&gt; The meeting also gave the Pandurs a chance to observe Ypsilantis' army, which they found to be alarmingly small and under-prepared.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, pp. 46–47; Iorga (1921), pp. 266–269, 362&lt;/ref&gt;

While the partition was ongoing, news came of Russia having denounced Ypsilantis, singled out as an enemy of the [[Holy Alliance]]. As Liprandi reports, Vladimirescu privately asked Ypsilantis to complete his transit of Wallachia or withdraw to Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. 84; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 84–85, 343&lt;/ref&gt; Ypsilantis hid this detail from his Romanian contacts as he began taking pledges of support from the various Pandur captains.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 267–268; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 84–85&lt;/ref&gt; He also hid from them that the Sacred Band had been [[Anathema|anathemized]] by the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Orthodox Patriarch]], [[Gregory V of Constantinople|Gregory V]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 275–282&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 15, Pharmakis and his troops, quartered in [[Lipscani]], central Bucharest, broke with the Pandurs. A ceremony organized by actor [[Costache Aristia]] consecrated their own army symbols, which echoed [[Byzantine flags and insignia]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 272–274, 362&lt;/ref&gt; As noted by Cioranu, "just about most foreigners who were under Tudor's banners" abandoned their posts in Oltenia and joined the Sacred Band. In the process, they "looted churches, houses, villages, boyars, merchants and everything they could lay hands on, leaving Christians naked [...] and raping wives and girls in front of their husbands and fathers."&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt; The same Cioranu notes that the Sacred Band, though only numbering 7,000 men officially, could count then on support from at least 20,000 Greeks and allies.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 261–262, 268–269&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimirescu was nevertheless able to prevent an alliance between Fochianos and Ypsilantis, reminding the former, who was effectively his hostage,&lt;ref name="iz&amp;cetei"&gt;Ionel Zănescu, Camelia Ene, "Palatul 'de la Colentina-Tei'", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', May 2002, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; of his pledge to the Divan. Together, they began policing the city to prevent Eterist looting.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 273–274, 283, 288–289, 360–361. See also Dieaconu, pp. 48–49; Finlay, pp. 126–127&lt;/ref&gt; In the ''[[mahala]]le'', the Pandurs formed a citizens' self-defense force which may have grouped thousands of Romanians and Romanies.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 360–361&lt;/ref&gt; Fochianos commanded the allegiances of 800 loyalist Arnauts and 1,000 armed [[Tanning (leather)|tanners]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. 284&lt;/ref&gt; According to various reports, the anti-looting policy alienated some of the troops, with as many as 400 men leaving Vladimirescu's camp as a result.&lt;ref&gt;Șerban, p. 284&lt;/ref&gt;

The two armies remained "arrested on the spot",&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p. 298"/&gt; and Vladimirescu began searching for an honorable retreat. On March 27, the boyars, instigated by him, produced a letter which informed foreign powers that the revolution only intended to restore "old privileges" and limit abuse.&lt;ref name="Cernatoni, p. 47"&gt;Cernatoni, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimirescu also drafted and sent letters of [[fealty]] to Mahmud II, limiting his demands to the restoration of [[elective monarchy]] in Wallachia; the Ottomans responded that there would be such negotiation lest he surrender his weapons.&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p. 298"/&gt; At the time, the Eterist rear in Moldavia was being attacked by a pro-Ottoman, and Austrian-backed, guerrilla. Led by [[Gavril Istrati]] and flying [[Red flag (politics)|red flags]], it managed to chase the Greeks out of [[Botoșani]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1919), pp. 172–175&lt;/ref&gt; As argued by Iorga, this force stood for the "''other'' revolution" (Iorga's emphasis), "opposed, like Tudor's was, to the Greek revolution."&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1919), p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; On April 5, Vladimirescu acknowledged Moldavian interests, writing to his own Divan, on April 5, about the possibility of a common movement for justice.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 47; Dima ''et al.'', p. 233; Maciu, p. 945&lt;/ref&gt;

During the final days of March, amid rumors of an Ottoman retaliation, Vladimirescu barricaded his Pandurs in [[Cotroceni Palace|Cotroceni Monastery]]. The new fortifications were designed by the nationalist schoolteacher [[Gheorghe Lazăr]]&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 57; Dima ''et al.'', pp. 160, 163, 262; Popp, pp. XII–XIII&lt;/ref&gt; and built using convict labor.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 61–62, 337–338&lt;/ref&gt; The Pandurs also set up lookout points in the Metropolitan Church and at Radu Vodă.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 47; Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; On April 14, Vladimirescu inspired his boyars to draft an anti-Eterist proclamation, accusing Ypsilanti of being a dishonored guest in a "country that had received [him] with open arms."&lt;ref name="Cernatoni, p. 47"/&gt; The Metropolitan and the Divan also obtained special protection from Tudor, and were moved to a safer location in Belvedere Manor, [[Regie, Bucharest|Ciurel]]. According to Liprandi, this was a move engineered by Filipescu-Vulpea, who planned the boyars' escape into Transylvania. Liprandi also reports that Vulpea exploited conflicts between Vladimirescu and Fochianos, presenting the latter as a mortal danger for the boyars as well.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 81–82&lt;/ref&gt; In fact, the boyars were able to survive Fochianos' attempted raid on Belvedere.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 67–68, 284–285&lt;/ref&gt;

From his barracks in Târgoviște, Ypsilantis responded to Vladimirescu's allegations with a proclamation in which he declared his disappointment, and stated his intention of leaving Wallachia to engage the Ottomans in the Balkans. However, he also began organizing northern Muntenia as an Eterist domain, sacking Vladimirescu's supporters.&lt;ref name="Maciu, p. 946"/&gt; One report suggests that he also depleted Romanian ammunition stores, taking away some 6,000 [[Pound (mass)|pounds]] (almost 3 [[ton]]s) of gunpowder.&lt;ref name="Finlay, p. 129"&gt;Finlay, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Vladimirescu had become more persistent in pursuing peace with the Ottomans. With the help of an Ottoman subject, Nuri Ağa, he circulated allegations that Ypsilantis and Callimachi were both conspirators, hinting that the Sultan could only ensure Wallachia's loyalty by removing the Phanariotes altogether.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 65–67. See also Finlay, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; On April 18, Jianu and Constantin Borănescu were sent to [[Silistra]] to parley with the Ottomans. The negotiations were inconclusive, as Romanians refused to either surrender or take up arms against the Sacred Band.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 47; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 85–86. See also Dieaconu, p. 50; Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 17; Iorga (1921), p. 363 and (1932), pp. 28, 58&lt;/ref&gt; Jianu was arrested there by order of [[Mehmed Selim Pasha]].&lt;ref&gt;Dieaconu, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt;

===Downfall===
[[File:Ottoman invasion of Wallachia, 1821.svg|thumb|400px|Map of the Ottoman invasion of Wallachia and Pandur withdrawal to Oltenia]]
Overall, Vladimirescu appeared hesitant. Nuri later revealed that he had prepared bribes for Vladimirescu to use on Ypsilantis' captains. This offer was shoved aside by Vladimirescu, who explained that he feared bribing treasonous men.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 85–86&lt;/ref&gt; In parallel, with a new proclamation from Cotroceni, Vladimirescu asserted that the Pandurs, Serbs and Bulgarians would stand together against Ottoman encroachment: "we must fire our rifles into Turkish flesh, should they invade."&lt;ref&gt;Gârleanu, p. 57; Popp, p. XII&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimirescu also reacted to the encroachment by sending his own ''Ispravnici'' to [[Roșiorii de Vede|Rușii]], where Callimachi's ''[[Postelnic]]'', Constantin Negri, had attempted to set his base. On [[Easter Sunday]], 600 Ottoman soldiers stormed into Rușii, executing 30 Pandurs along with 170 civilians.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1821), pp. 338–339. See also Popa &amp; Dicu, p. 100&lt;/ref&gt; A Serbian outlaw, known as Ghiță Haidicul, punished such an incursion on March 21, capturing and maiming some 40 Turks.&lt;ref&gt;Dieaconu, pp. 50–51&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimirescu no longer intervened when the [[Bashi-bazouk]]s took [[Călărași]], which they began fortifying in preparation for a larger invasion.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1821), p. 340&lt;/ref&gt; His revolt was nevertheless influential south of the [[Danube]], in the [[Sanjak of Nicopolis]]. The Bulgarians here rose up in arms, but were put down by the [[Ottoman Army]]. Violent persecution against them was curbed, but later mutated into specific actions against [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nicopolis|Nicopolitan Catholics]].&lt;ref&gt;Papacostea, pp. 11–13&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last days of April, the Ottoman Army made its coordinated push into Wallachia, with 20,000 to 32,000 soldiers—half of whom headed straight for Moldavia.&lt;ref&gt;Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 18; Iorga (1921), p. 193&lt;/ref&gt; The other 10,000 or 14,000 were split into two columns: one, placed under [[Burdurlu Dervish Mehmed Pasha|Dervish Mehmed Pasha]] and Ioan Rogobete, entered Oltenia at [[Calafat]]; the other, led by [[Mehmed Selim Pasha]] and Kara Feiz Ali, set out of Călărași into Muntenia.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 284–286, 288–289, 304–306. See also Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Of the easternmost force, a regiment under Yusuf Berkofcali entered [[Brăila]] en route to Moldavia, where they set fire to Galați and massacred its population.&lt;ref&gt;Ardeleanu, pp. 154–156; Iorga (1921), p. 286; Rizos-Nerulos, pp. 312–316&lt;/ref&gt; This invasion force consisted of 5,500 infantry and 500 cavalry, assisted by 1,000 [[Zaporozhian Cossacks]] of the [[Danubian Sich]]; [[Hilmi Ibrahim Pasha]] also sailed to the region with some 40 [[Ottoman Navy|Ottoman river vessels]].&lt;ref&gt;Ardeleanu, pp. 154–156&lt;/ref&gt; During their subsequent invasion of [[Putna County]], Berkofcali reportedly isolated some other remnants of Vladimirescu's army.&lt;ref&gt;Iliescu &amp; Miron, pp. 26–27&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 14–15, the Ottomans held [[Copăceni, Ilfov|Copăceni]] and [[Glina, Ilfov|Cățelu]], in sight of Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 289, 290, 341–342&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[firman]]'' of the Porte announced that its armies would seek to administer justice, separating "the exploited from exploiters"; it commended Fochianos and Negri for their loyalism, assigning them to govern over Bucharest "until the peoples are as pacified as they have been in the old day."&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 286–288&lt;/ref&gt; This document described Vladimirescu as a loyalist who demanded "pity and justice", whereas Ypsilantis was dismissed as an "outcast".&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; Both Nuri and an Ottoman general, ''[[Kethüda]]'' Kara Ahmed, presented new offers for cooperation with the Pandurs, including promises that they would introduce a "settlement that is more favorable to the peasants".&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Although praised by the ''firman'', Fochianos made a belated show of his conversion of the Eterist cause, parading through Bucharest under a "freedom banner", probably the same one flown by Aristia.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 75, 341–343, 362&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, Fochainos boasted his ability to "incite all of [[Ottoman Bulgaria|Bulgaria]] through his agents and his influence on that bellicose nation."&lt;ref&gt;Rizos-Nerulos, p. 280&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one interpretation, Vladimirescu still considered resisting militarily, but was suspicious of Fochianos, and abandoned this plan in favor of a full retreat.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt; He sent his acolytes Mihali and Ghencea to meet Ypsilantis and Pharmakis at [[Mărgineni Monastery]], reportedly in order to synchronize resistance. Cioranu argues that this was merely a pretext to spy on the Sacred Band.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 289–290&lt;/ref&gt; Over those days, the two rival armies, Greek and Romanian, had already begun moving across Wallachia and toward their respective Carpathian strongholds: Vladimirescu's set course for Oltenia, while Ypsilantis moved into northern Muntenia.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, pp. 47–48; Djuvara, p. 298; Finlay, pp. 126–130; Georgescu, p. 103; Iorga (1921), pp. 73–77, 193–195, 282–284, 289–290, 341–344, 370 and (1932), p. 28; Potra (1990), pp. 444, 469; Rizos-Nerulos, pp. 310–311, 321–322; Șerban, pp. 281–282, 284; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 85, 86–87&lt;/ref&gt; The retreat also saw military exercises which tested the troops' resilience and readiness for combat. In one reported incident, Vladimirescu staged an Ottoman attack, ordering some of his soldiers to dress up in Turkish uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 195–199, 370&lt;/ref&gt; Order and morale waned among the Pandurs, prompting Vladimirescu to met out punishments that were marked by "cruelty."&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 298; Finlay, p. 130; Iorga (1921), p. 269 and (1932), pp. 27, 58&lt;/ref&gt; He may have killed as many as 30 of his own soldiers, some of them by his own hand.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 199–200, 290–291. See also Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 18; Jelavich, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The retreat also infuriated the Sacred Band. According to one account, Ypsilantis sent Fochianos in pursuit of the Romanian column.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 343–344&lt;/ref&gt; Other versions suggest that Fochianos, still in contact with the Porte, expected to "play the two sides against each other and then side with the winner",&lt;ref&gt;Rizos-Nerulos, pp. 321–322&lt;/ref&gt; or "an opportunity of making the prince [Ypsilantis] prisoner".&lt;ref name="Finlay, p. 129"/&gt; Olympios also followed the Pandurs and, upon reaching them, demanded that Vladimirescu return to fight for Bucharest. During a subsequent standoff on the banks of [[Cârcinov]], Vladimirescu agreed to hold deescalation talks.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 48; Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 18; Iorga (1921), pp. 199–200, 290–293, 371–373; Popa &amp; Dicu, pp. 100–101&lt;/ref&gt; Terror against his own troops had peaked during the Pandurs' passage through [[Argeș County]]. At [[Ștefănești, Argeș|Golești]], Vladimirescu ordered the hanging of Ioan Urdăreanu, as punishment for the desertion of four Pandur captains. This incident reportedly caused distress, greatly diminishing Pandur support for their leader.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 299; Iorga (1921), pp. 293–297, 371–372&lt;/ref&gt; According to the scribe Dârzeanu, Olympios and Pharmakis used the negotiations at Golești, which resulted in a renewed pact with the Sacred Band, to approach Pandur malcontents and probe their commitments.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), p. 84; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladimirescu also fell out with the Macedonskis, who claimed to have stumbled upon proof that he had embezzled 1 million thaler, and announced that they would surrender him to the Divan for trial.&lt;ref&gt;Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; On May 21, Ypsilantis' agents marched into the camp and seized Vladimirescu, confident that none of his soldiers would resist them.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 48; Djuvara, p. 299; Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 18; Iorga (1921), pp. 84, 201–203, 269, 293–297 and (1932), p. 58; Maciu, pp. 946, 948; Popa &amp; Dicu, p. 101; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 89–90&lt;/ref&gt; Cioranu recalls that the Eterists displayed Vladimirescu's correspondence with the Porte, prompting the Pandurs to rally behind Prodan and Macedonski, identified as their new commanders.&lt;ref&gt;Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 18; Iorga (1921), pp. 296–297. See also Finlay, pp. 129–130; Rizos-Nerulos, pp. 322–323&lt;/ref&gt; They allegedly told them that Olympios would personally handle Vladimirescu's surrender to the Divan.&lt;ref&gt;Dieaconu, p. 52; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 89&lt;/ref&gt; The prisoner was instead taken to the Sacred Band headquarters at Târgoviște, where he was tortured, shot, cut into pieces, and disposed of.&lt;ref&gt;Dieaconu, pp. 52–53; Djuvara, p. 299; Finlay, pp. 130–131; Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 18; Iorga (1921), pp. III, XVI, 84–85, 297–299, 343–344, 373; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 37; Popa &amp; Dicu, p. 103; Șerban, p. 286; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, p. 90&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
[[File:Eteria Bucharest 1821.jpg|thumb|400px|German print of 1821, depicting Fochianis and his Arnauts being massacred by Ottomans in Bucharest]]
In the immediate aftermath, the Pandurs scattered, with most reentering civilian life; of those who refused to do so, some joined Ypsilantis' force, while others rallied with [[Anastasie Mihaloglu]] to form an independent revolutionary force.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, pp. 48–49; Dieaconu, pp. 49–53; Djuvara, p. 301; Iorga (1921), pp. 203–222, 299–306 and (1932), pp. 28–30. See also Finlay, pp. 131–135; Georgescu, p. 103; Jelavich, p. 25&lt;/ref&gt; D. Macedonski, who traveled to Oltenia but remained in contact with the Eterists, was allegedly misinformed by his allies that Vladimirescu was still alive, but exiled.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 215–216, 221–222; Vianu &amp; Iancovici, pp. 90–91&lt;/ref&gt; Pandur forces also included some 800 defectors from Golești, under [[Ioan Oarcă]], and Solomon's troops, which had by then withdrawn to [[Țânțăreni, Gorj|Țânțăreni]].&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 299, 304–305&lt;/ref&gt; News of Vladimirescu's capture interrupted Poenaru and [[Ilarion Gheorghiadis]] from their diplomatic mission to the Holy Alliance, which pleaded for direct protection from Eterist "cruelty". Having just crossed the border into Transylvania, they opted not to return.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), pp. 26, 68–69; Dima ''et al.'', p. 296&lt;/ref&gt;

Other Pandur sympathizers followed suit. They include poet [[Iancu Văcărescu]], who took with him a sabre that he claimed had been Vladimirescu's.&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 29; Dima ''et al.'', p. 192&lt;/ref&gt; This influx alarmed Transylvanian authorities, who feared that Pandurs would incite revolution among the [[Grenz infantry]] and the serfs of [[Hunyad County]]. At [[Șoimuș|Szúliget]], several peasants, including the elderly Adam Bedia, were imprisoned for having prepared and armed themselves in expectation of "Tudor's men".&lt;ref&gt;Andrițoiu &amp; Cerghedean, pp. 99–102&lt;/ref&gt; Chancellor [[Sámuel Teleki (Chancellor)|Sámuel Teleki]] ordered the [[Transylvanian Military Frontier|Military Border]] reinforced, and began sending back refugees; the boyars of Corona were deported further inland.&lt;ref&gt;Andrițoiu &amp; Cerghedean, pp. 95–99&lt;/ref&gt; However, both Macedonski and Prodan were able to break through the cordon, disguised as merchants.&lt;ref&gt;Andrițoiu &amp; Cerghedean, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, all of Bucharest had surrendered to Kara Ahmed. Known in Romanian as ''Chehaia'', he was much feared and disliked by the Romanians, having tolerated massacres and rapes.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 85–86, 299–300, 342, 345–348, 365–369; Potra (1990), p. 146; Șerban, pp. 285–286&lt;/ref&gt; In cultural terms, his arrival meant a return to sartorial traditionalism: [[1795–1820 in Western fashion|Western fashion]], which had been popular with the young boyars, became politically suspect; society in both Wallachia and Moldavia returned to the standards of [[Ottoman clothing]].&lt;ref&gt;Constanța Vintilă-Ghițulescu, "Constructing a New Identity: Romanian Aristocrats between Oriental Heritage and Western Prestige (1780–1866)", in Constanța Vintilă-Ghițulescu (ed.), ''From Traditional Attire to Modern Dress: Modes of Identification, Modes of Recognition in the Balkans (XVIth–XXth Centuries)'', pp. 114–115. Newcastle upon Tyne: Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2011.  {{ISBN|1-4438-3186-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danubian Sich also participated in Bucharest's occupation, with ''[[Kosh otaman|Kosh]]'' Nikifor Beluha organizing the plunder.

Revista Călătorului'', Issues 24–27, May–August 2012, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; Once evacuated, Târgoviște also surrendered to the Zaporozhian Cossacks, but was not spared large-scale destruction.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 348–349&lt;/ref&gt; A legion of some 3,000 soldiers, under Kara Feiz, went in pursuit of the Pandurs, taking Craiova and setting fire to Slatina.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 203–212&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 26, at [[Prundeni|Zăvideni]], Mihaloglu, ''Serdar'' Djuvara and Solomon were surprised by Kara Feiz. The troops scattered, with most surrendering to the Austrians in Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 305–306, 320&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon himself would spend six years in Austrian jails.&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; During that interval, the nationalist boyars and bishops, including Dionisie, also escaped into Transylvania.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. 74, 86; Potra (1963), p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; Remaining in the country, Fochianos had turned against Ypsilantis, again pledging himself to Callimachi. He then assisted the invasion force, helping to identify and capture revolutionary sympathizers—including Djuvara, who surrendered at [[Cozia Monastery]] and was then executed.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 301; Iorga (1921), pp. 102–103, 217, 302–304, 313–314, 348, 349, 373, 376–378&lt;/ref&gt;

Both rival revolutionary armies were crushed in June–August 1821: Ypsilantis' was routed [[Battle of Dragashani|at Drăgășani]]; the independent Pandurs were massacred while resisting in northern Oltenia.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 49; Dieaconu, pp. 49–55; Djuvara, p. 301; Finlay, pp. 131–137; Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 19; Iorga (1921), pp. 85–103, 203–224, 306–316, 320, 349–350, 374–377 and (1932), pp. 27, 28–30; Jelavich, p. 25; Popa &amp; Dicu, p. 103; Rizos-Nerulos, pp. 324–327&lt;/ref&gt; Repression came with extreme violence: Ioan Dobrescu, the last Romanian chronicler, reports that "even the mountains stank" from dead bodies.&lt;ref&gt;Dima ''et al.'', p. 142&lt;/ref&gt; "A large number of dead bodies" were recovered by locals from Colentina manor, while others had been discarded in the marshes of [[Tei, Bucharest|Tei]].&lt;ref name="iz&amp;cetei"/&gt; A regrouped Eterist contingent, led by Pharmakis and Olympios, held out at [[Secu Monastery]] in Moldavia; Olympios reportedly detonated himself during the siege, while Pharmakis was taken prisoner and decapitated.&lt;ref&gt;Dieaconu, p. 54; Djuvara, p. 301; Finlay, pp. 136–137; Iorga (1921), pp. 215, 313, 377–378 and (1932), pp. 28–29, 30; Rizos-Nerulos, pp. 327–329.

On August 6, the Ottomans liquidated their nominal ally Fochianos, and all his Arnauts, having first lured them back to Bucharest.&lt;ref&gt;Dieaconu, pp. 54–55; Djuvara, p. 301; Finlay, p. 135; Iorga (1921), pp. 102–105, 110–111, 316–320, 378–381 and (1932), pp. 29–30; Potra (1990), pp. 146, 444–446; Rizos-Nerulos, pp. 326–327; Șerban, p. 285&lt;/ref&gt; Ottoman terror was finally curbed by the Austrian Empire, who threatened with invasion upon being informed that victims of repression included Austrian subjects.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 301–302&lt;/ref&gt; On March 14, 1822, the Holy Alliance issued a final warning, which prompted the Sultan to recall his troops.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 307&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical consequences==
===Phanariote demise===
Despite being met with violent repression, the Eterist ideal remained planted in the Balkans, and, after a decade of fighting, Greek nationalists managed to establish the [[Kingdom of Greece]]. The Romanian revolt had generally more delayed and less conspicuous results. Sociologist [[Dimitrie Drăghicescu]] was particularly dismissive of the 1821 movement, viewing it as a sample of Romanian "passivity": "[it] was so unlike a real, courageous, revolution; it can be reduced to a rally of no consequence."&lt;ref&gt;[[Dimitrie Drăghicescu]], ''Din psihologia poporului român. Introducere'', 450. Bucharest: [[Editura Librăriei Leon Alcaly|Libraria Leon Alcaly]], 1907&lt;/ref&gt; According to Djuvara, Vladimirescu failed because "the time had not yet come for what he intended to accomplish": "he never managed to entice the peasant mass of the villages, where his message never penetrated the way it should have. [...] The class he could have relied on—and to which he did not himself belong—, that of traders and artisans, the barely nascent bourgeoisie, was not at that junction structured enough to represent a political force."&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p. 300"&gt;Djuvara, p. 300&lt;/ref&gt;

Vârtosu also describes the Pandurs were a "first generation of democracy", but a "sacrificial generation"—"there was little ideological preparation in the Country".&lt;ref&gt;Vârtosu (1945), pp. 347–348&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Potra notes that the "revolutionary movement of 1821" was actually hailed by Bucharesters as an opportunity for "national liberation", "but could not have achieved this." Instead, "this first revolution, which opened the way for a line of struggles [...] for the independence and freedom of the Romanian nation, has violently shaken up the feudal order, contributing to the demise of the Phanariote regime."&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1990), p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Maciu contrarily believes that Vladimirescu's movement could have in fact brought about "bourgeois rule" and the [[Capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], but that it never took off as an actual revolution.&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, pp. 940–941, 947–948&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Marx]] once categorized the 1821 events as a "national insurrection" rather than "peasants' revolt". As Maciu concludes, this acknowledges that the revolt was carefully planned, but fell short of stating a bourgeois objective.&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, pp. 947–948&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladimirescu endured in the symbolic realm, a hero of [[Romanian folklore|folklore]] and [[Romanian literature|literature]], "a legend [...] which will serve to nurture the builders of modern Romania."&lt;ref name="Djuvara, p. 300"/&gt; As poet [[Ion Heliade Rădulescu]] argued, the Pandurs had managed to take Wallachia out of her "somnolence" and "degeneracy".&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, pp. 50, 52&lt;/ref&gt; In its immediate aftermath, however, the revolt sparked mainly negative commentary. A cluster of chroniclers, boyar and conservative, still dominated the literary scene. They include Dobrescu, [[Alecu Beldiman]], [[Naum Râmniceanu]], and [[Zilot Românul]], all of whom disliked Vladimirescu.&lt;ref&gt;Dima ''et al.'', pp. 123, 127, 132, 138, 142&lt;/ref&gt; A noted exception to this rule was the Aromanian patriot [[Toma Gheorghe Peșacov]].&lt;ref&gt;Dima ''et al.'', pp. 123, 139–141&lt;/ref&gt; Though he probably never approved of Vladimirescu's social discourse, [[Dinicu Golescu]] subdued his criticism, and expressed his own concerns about the [[corvée]] system.&lt;ref&gt;Popp, pp. V–VI, XIII–XIV&lt;/ref&gt; Through its parallel depiction in folklore, the Pandur rising was transposed into foreign literature: some of the first ballads about Vladimirescu or Fochianos were collected in the [[Bessarabia Governorate]] by [[Alexander Pushkin]] (who was enthusiastic about the revolt, as early as February 1821),&lt;ref&gt;Cochran, pp. 311–313&lt;/ref&gt; and reused as literary sources by [[Alexander Veltman]].&lt;ref&gt;S. Iancovici, "Recenzii. E. M. Dvoicenko-Markova, ''Русско-румынские литературные связи в первой половине XIX века''", in ''Studii. Revistă de Istorie'', Vol. 20, Issue 5, 1967, pp. 1027–1028. See also Dieaconu, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; Semiotician [[Yuri Lotman]] argues that Pushkin wanted to weave the Romanian revolt into a planned sequel to ''[[Eugene Onegin]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Yuri Lotman]], "L'histoire du capitaine Kopeïkine", in Yuri Lotman, [[Boris Uspensky]], ''Sémiotique de la culture russe: études sur l'histoire'', p. 232. Lausanne: [[L'Âge d'Homme]], 1990.  {{ISBN|9782825100172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revolt had sent out signals to the Ottoman government, and produced relevant policy changes. One of the early signs of change came just months after its suppression, when the Divan restored Târgoviște to its citizens, and the "cartel of the four [princely] families" was formally annulled.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 191, 296&lt;/ref&gt; In July 1822, after having heard a new set of boyar complaints which had Russian and Austrian backing, the Sultan put an end to the Phanariote regime, appointing [[Grigore IV Ghica]] (the former ''Caimacam'' of 1821) and [[Ioan Sturdza]] as "native" Princes of Wallachia and Moldavia, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Cernatoni, p. 49; Djuvara, p. 307; Georgescu, pp. 103–105; Iliescu &amp; Miron, p. 19; Iorga (1921), p. 321 and (1932), pp. 8, 16, 26, 30–32, 54–55; Jelavich, pp. 26–27; Karpat, pp. 406, 407; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 231, 259; Maciu, p. 948; Nistor, ''passim''; Zane, p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; Trying to appease Russia, in 1826 the Ottoman Empire also signed the [[Akkerman Convention]], which set commercial freedoms for Romanians and the Moldavians, and allowed the Divans to elect their Princes for seven-year terms.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 320, 323; Jelavich, pp. 27–28. See also Georgescu, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The new regimes set a standard of [[Westernization]] and cultural [[Francophilia]], giving impetus to the [[National Party (Romania)|National Party]] and the [[Freemasonry in Romania|local Freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 307–319. See also Georgescu, pp. 104–105&lt;/ref&gt; Prince Ghica, having recovered his Colentina manor, rebuilt it as a [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] palace, in line with the Westernized preferences of his subjects.&lt;ref name="iz&amp;cetei"/&gt;

===Pandur revival===
[[File:Bouquet - Costumes de la Valachie.jpg|thumb|400px|Pandurs in Bucharest, with peasant women and [[wayside cross]]. Drawing by Michel Bouquet, 1841]]
According to Jelavich, repressive measures against the Romanian peasantry remained subdued: "although villages were disarmed and attempts were made to collect the taxes and labor obligations that were due from the period of the rebellion, the entire matter was handled with relative moderation."&lt;ref&gt;Jelavich, p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, however, the Vladimirescu revolt and the Sacred Band contributed to the "tangible degradation" of Wallachia's economy, which was only enhanced by the "terrible plundering" of Ottoman occupation.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 223–224&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Le Moniteur Universel]]'' reported that "everything in the countryside has been destroyed; what Greek revolutionaries could not accomplish, the Ottoman vanguard did."&lt;ref&gt;Șerban, pp. 285–286&lt;/ref&gt; A [[monetary crisis]], sparked by the events of 1821 and cemented by the recovery of boyar privilege, affected both principalities for an entire decade.&lt;ref&gt;Zane, pp. 202–209, 221–222&lt;/ref&gt;

Troubles continued under Ghica, including raids by Arnauts hiding in Transylvania and a number of riots. In 1826 Simion Mehedințeanu attempted a new uprising at [[Padeș]]; he was defeated and hanged.&lt;ref&gt;Dieaconu, pp. 55–57&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Ottoman concessions, Wallachia and Moldavia fell to a new [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|Russian occupation in 1828–1829]]. During this phase, the Pandurs were revived by Governor [[Pavel Kiselyov]] and Costache Ghica, who created new units throughout Muntenia. The Divan, fearful of rebellion, reduced the number of Oltenian recruits, while Muntenians simply kept away.&lt;ref&gt;Nistor, pp. 889–891, 895–896&lt;/ref&gt; Liprandi commanded his own Russian unit in the campaign, giving employment to many Arnauts who had lived the previous seven years as marauding outlaws.&lt;ref&gt;Dieaconu, pp. 49, 57&lt;/ref&gt; This time saw the rise of a new Pandur commandant, [[Gheorghe Magheru]]. After policing Oltenia, he saw action against at [[Șișești, Mehedinți|Șișești]], repelling 3,000 Ottomans with a force of 450 Pandurs.&lt;ref name="idsmagh"/&gt;

The Russian regime was extended by a new constitutional arrangement, ''[[Regulamentul Organic]]'', which made the two countries Russian-controlled territories under Ottoman suzerainty. The corresponding [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]] enhanced commercial freedoms, and is credited as the birth certificate of Romanian capitalism, with its modern middle class and a new standard of living.&lt;ref&gt;Dima ''et al.'', pp. 7–8, 13, 229–230, 434; Djuvara, pp. 324, 327–329; Georgescu, pp. 122, 127–133; Karpat, pp. 407–408; Popa &amp; Dicu, pp. 103–104; Popp, pp. XI–XII; Potra (1990), p. 348&lt;/ref&gt; The full reestablishment of Wallachia's professional military under Russian command was, according to Potra, also a means to perpetuate a "strong revolutionary tradition" that included the Pandur unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; The new system continued to be perceived as oppressive by the peasants, giving rise to various attempted revolts, particularly in Oltenia. In the 1830s, Gorj and [[Dolj County|Dolj]] witnessed peasant rioters shouting slogans such as "Tudor has come back to life!"&lt;ref&gt;Barbu, pp. 153–154&lt;/ref&gt; A veteran of 1821, Nicolae Groază, reverted to a life of crime. This "last Romanian ''hajduk''", captured and tried in 1838, defended himself by noting that he followed in the footsteps of Vladimirescu, Pharmakis, and Solomon.&lt;ref&gt;[[Alecu Russo]], ''Scrieri postume. Traduse de V. Alecsandri, Al. Odobescu, Mihail Sadoveanu'', pp. 154–164. Craiova: [[Scrisul Românesc]], [n. y.].  {{OCLC|491480181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this interval, Vladimirescu associate Poenaru became organizer of Wallachian education. Although he had abandoned his youthful radicalism, Poenaru encouraged research into the revolt, as well as artistic homages to Vladimirescu.&lt;ref&gt;Potra (1963), pp. V–VII, 4–5, 69, 216&lt;/ref&gt; The Pandurs' colors may also have inspired political symbolism adopted the "native" rulers. Vladimirescu's banner, though blue-and-white, had blue-yellow-red [[tassel]]s; a memory of this color scheme may have inspired the adoption of [[Flag and coat of arms of Wallachia|Wallachian ensigns]] and [[Flag of Romania|Romanian tricolors]].&lt;ref&gt;Pălănceanu, pp. 136–139&lt;/ref&gt; In Moldavia, as early as 1843, historian [[Mihail Kogălniceanu]] praised Vladimirescu for having "raised the national flag" to demand "a national government, founded on a liberal charter."&lt;ref&gt;Maciu, p. 931&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later echoes===
[[File:Coat of arms of Gorj County in the Socialist Rep. of Romania.svg|thumb|200px|Coat of arms of [[Gorj County]] during the [[Communist Romania|communist period]]. Featuring [[Attributed arms|attributed flag]] (with inscription) and sabre, both of which stood for Vladimirescu and his revolt]]
Tensions between nationalists and the Russian protectors, first evidenced with the 1842 ouster of Wallachian Prince [[Alexandru II Ghica]],&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, p. 325; Iorga (1932), pp. 35, 54–55; Jelavich, pp. 36–38; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 128–137, 235–236&lt;/ref&gt; were enhanced by anti-Russian conspiracies. Before the full-scale [[Wallachian Revolution of 1848]], one such revolutionary fraternity united Dimitrie Macedonski with the young [[Liberalism and radicalism in Romania|liberal]] boyars [[Mitică Filipescu]] and [[Nicolae Bălcescu]].&lt;ref&gt;Dima ''et al.'', p. 508; Djuvara, p. 330. See also Liu, p. 304&lt;/ref&gt; The period also saw the uprising glorified in poetry by [[Cezar Bolliac]] and [[Alexandru Pelimon]], then explored in adventure novels by [[Constantin Boerescu]], [[Dimitrie Bolintineanu]], and [[Nicolae Filimon]].&lt;ref&gt;Dima ''et al.'', pp. 336, 421, 558–559, 589–590, 603, 658–663&lt;/ref&gt; The uprising and its impact on the [[Transylvanian Reformed Church District|Reformed Church]] missionaries are also retold in a short story by [[Mór Jókai]], from first-hand reports by [[Károly Sükei]].&lt;ref&gt;Hilda Hencz, ''Bucureștiul maghiar. Scurtă istorie a maghiarilor din București de la începuturi până în prezent'', p. 58. Bucharest: Editura Biblioteca Bucureștilor, 2011.  {{ISBN|978-973-8369-97-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; This revival of interest was contrasted by conservative views. Poet and essayist [[Grigore Alexandrescu]] viewed Vladimirescu as "nearsighted and cruel",&lt;ref&gt;Bogdan-Duică, p. 263&lt;/ref&gt; while [[Grigore Lăcusteanu]] defined the uprising as a "first attempt to murder Romanian aristocracy, so that the nobodies and the churls may take its place".&lt;ref&gt;Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 28–29&lt;/ref&gt; Solomon, though he had served Vladimirescu and remained a Pandur commander, also turned conservative during the 1840s.&lt;ref&gt;Barbu, pp. 134, 153; Dima ''et al.'', p. 605; Lăcusteanu &amp; Crutzescu, pp. 147–164, 169–175, 232&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, the ''Regulamentul'' regime was ended by the [[Crimean War]], which also opened the way for the creation of a Romanian state from the [[United Principalities|union of Moldavia and Wallachia]]. According to Djuvara, during this process "nationalist" boyars imposed on historiography a narrative that obscured Vladimirescu's views on class conflict, preserving a memory of the revolution as only an anti-Phanariote and nativist phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;Djuvara, pp. 89, 325–326&lt;/ref&gt; The social dimension of 1821 was again revisited in the 1860s by egalitarian liberals such as [[Bogdan Petriceicu Hasdeu]], who directed [[Constantin D. Aricescu]] to write a new history of the revolt.&lt;ref&gt;Iorga (1921), pp. V–VI&lt;/ref&gt; 

This populist trend was continued following the proclamation of a [[Kingdom of Romania]]. The original rebel flag, preserved by the Cacalațeanu family, was recovered in 1882 and assigned to the [[Romanian Land Forces]] by Hasdeu.&lt;ref&gt;Pălănceanu, pp. 135–136&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1890s, [[Constantin Dobrescu-Argeș]], the agrarian leader and Pandur descendant, made reference to the Vladimirescu revolt as a precursor to his own movement.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolae Gh. Teodorescu, "Muzeul din Mușătești, județul Argeș, mărturie a contribuției satului la istoria patriei", in ''Muzeul Național (Sesiunea Științifică de Comunicări, 17–18 Decembrie 1973)'', Vol. II, 1975, p. 110; Octavian Ungureanu, "Tudor Vladimirescu în conștiința argeșenilor.

Studii și Comunicări, Seria Istorie'', Vol. VIII, 1999, p. 171&lt;/ref&gt; In 1913, [[Gheorghe Munteanu-Murgoci]] founded a youth organization called Pandurs, later merged into [[Cercetașii României|Romania's Scouts]].&lt;ref&gt;Dumitru-Valentin Pătrașcu, "100 de ani de cercetășie în România.

Studii și Cercetări'', Vol. VII, 1997, pp. 172–173&lt;/ref&gt; Vladimirescu was also recovered by the pantheon of [[Greater Romania]], one of the "warrior heroes" depicted in the [[Romanian Atheneum]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 192–193, 203, 212&lt;/ref&gt; 

Several authors revisited the events during the interwar, with topical plays being written by Iorga and [[Ion Peretz]].&lt;ref&gt;V. V. Haneș, "Teatrul contemporan românesc", in ''Preocupări Literare'', Vol. IV, Issue 10, December 1939, p. 457; Paul I. Prodan, ''Teatrul românesc contemporan. 1920—1927'', pp. 119–124. Bucharest: [[Fundațiile Regale|Prince Carol Cultural Foundation]], 1927.  {{OCLC|731452973}}&lt;/ref&gt; As nationalists, the 1821 Pandurs also had cult status in fascist propaganda put out by the [[Iron Guard]] during the 1930s and '40s,&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 213; Roland Clark, ''Sfîntă tinerețe legionară.

[[Romanian prisoners of war in the Soviet Union|Prisoners of war]] held by the [[Soviet Union]] were then coaxed into forming a [[Tudor Vladimirescu Division]], which also helped communize the Land Forces.&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, pp. 128, 134–135, 171, 265–266; Pierre du Bois, "La politique étrangère roumaine de 1944 à 1947", in ''[[Revue d'Histoire Moderne et Contemporaine]]'', Vol. 29, Issue 3, July–September 1982, pp. 436–437; Florin Georgescu, "Epurările politice din armata română între anii 1944–1948", in ''Acta Moldaviae Meridionalis'', Vols.

With the imposition of a [[Communist Romania|communist state]], the Pandurs came to be seen as revolutionary precursors, and also as figures of anti-Western sentiment. Communist Romanian and [[Soviet historiography]] glossed over differences between Ypsilantis and Vladimirescu, depicting both as Russian-inspired liberators of the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;Hariuc, pp. 197–198; Karpat, pp. 4, 406–407; van Meurs, pp. 52, 275–282&lt;/ref&gt; In his pseudohistorical articles of 1952–1954, Solomon Știrbu alleged that Vladimirescu's revolution had been sparked by the [[Union of Salvation|Decembrist movement]],&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [[Z. Ornea]], in [http://www.romlit.ro/o_carte_despre_anii_1955-1960 "O carte despre anii 1955–1960"], in ''[[România Literară]]'', Nr. 3/2001&lt;/ref&gt; and had been ultimately defeated by "agents of the English bourgeoisie".&lt;ref&gt;Cioroianu, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt; During [[De-Stalinization in Romania|De-Stalinization]], Oțetea received political approval to curb this trend, though his own conclusions were soon challenged by other exponents of [[Marxist historiography]], including [[David Prodan]].&lt;ref&gt;Hariuc, pp. 197–201&lt;/ref&gt;

Vladimirescu was still perceived as mainly a social revolutionary, but maintained a hero's status throughout the regime's latter [[National communism in Romania|nationalist phase]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, pp. 215, 219–220, 222–223&lt;/ref&gt; In 1966, [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] established an [[Order of Tudor Vladimirescu]], as Communist Romania's third most important distinction.&lt;ref&gt;Charles H. Pankey, "The Socialist Romanian Order, Medal, and Badges of Tudor Vladimirescu", in ''The Journal of the Orders and Medals Society of America'', Vol. 51, Issue 5, September–October 2000, pp. 25–28&lt;/ref&gt; During this interval, the revolt was reconstructed in film, with ''[[Tudor (1963 film)|Tudor]]''. Viewed at the time as a significant achievement in Romanian historical cinema,&lt;ref&gt;[[D. I. Suchianu]], "De la istorie la filmul istoric", in ''[[Magazin Istoric]]'', June 1969, p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; it was also the lifetime role for the lead, [[Emanoil Petruț]].&lt;ref&gt;Călin Căliman, "Actori care nu mai sunt", in ''[[Contemporanul]]'', Issue 9/2010, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; Despite Oțetea's stated objections, screenwriter [[Mihnea Gheorghiu]] downplayed all connections between Vladimirescu and the Eteria, and elevated his historical stature.&lt;ref&gt;Hariuc, pp. 200–201&lt;/ref&gt; The film provided a venue for criticism of Russia, but also depicted Vladimirescu as an early champion of [[Nationalization in Romania|nationalization]].&lt;ref&gt;Raluca Durbacă, "Titus Popovici. Stima noastră și mândria", in ''Film Menu'', Issue 20, November 2013, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, following a revival of historical fiction, the revolt was a subject matter for Paul A. Georgescu, with a critically acclaimed novel, also named ''Tudor''.&lt;ref&gt;Valentin Tașcu, "Arheologia spiritului sau proza istorică", in ''Steaua'', Vol. XXVIII, Issue 1, January 1977, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Later film productions dealing with the events include the 1981 [[Ostern]] ''[[Iancu Jianu, haiducul]]'', which also modifies the historical narrative to endorse the regime's theses.&lt;ref&gt;Mihaela Gancea, "Mitologizarea haiducului în filmul românesc, particularitate a discursului cultural din perioada regimului comunist", in Constantin Bărbulescu, Ioana Bonda, Cecilia Cârja (eds.), ''Identitate și alteritate, 5.

Cluj-Napoca: Presa Universitară Clujeană, 2011.  {{ISBN|978-973-595-326-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

By the 1980s, the scholarly bibliography on the revolt of 1821 had become "enormous".&lt;ref&gt;Georgescu, p. 333&lt;/ref&gt; Following the [[Romanian Revolution of 1989|anti-communist revolution of 1989]], Vladimirescu was preserved as a political symbol by some of the nationalist groups, including the [[Greater Romania Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Boia, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Others perceived his revolt as the symbol of an Oltenian specificity. On March 21, 2017, marking the 196th anniversary of Bucharest's taking by the Pandurs, the [[Chamber of Deputies of Romania]] passed a law to mark the occasion annually, as "Oltenia Day".&lt;ref&gt;{{ro icon}} [https://web.archive.org/web/20170604100358/http://www.mediafax.ro/politic/21-martie-ziua-olteniei-cum-vor-sarbatori-romanii-aceasta-zi-16202816 ''21 martie – Ziua Olteniei.

'''Watchmen''' were organized groups of men, usually authorized by a state, government, city, or society, to deter criminal activity and provide law enforcement as well as traditionally perform the services of [[public security|public safety]], [[fire lookout|fire watch]], [[crime prevention]], [[detective|crime detection]], [[possession of stolen goods|recovery of stolen goods]]. Watchmen have existed since earliest recorded times in various guises throughout the world and were generally succeeded by the emergence of formally organized professional [[police|policing]].

==Early origins==
An early reference to a watch can be found in the [[Bible]] where the Prophet [[Ezekiel]] states that it was the duty of the watch to blow the horn and sound the alarm. (Ezekiel 33:1-6)

The existence of watchmen has also been found{{Specify|date=November 2008}} in the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]], [[Ancient Greece|Greek]] and [[Egyptian Empire|Egyptian]] Empires.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The [[Roman Empire]] turned the role of a watchman into a profession by creating two organizations:
* the [[Praetorian Guard]] thus establishing a rank and file system with a Captain of the Guard.
* [[Vigiles]], literally the watch.

==Watchmen in England==

=== The Problem of the Night ===
The streets in London were dark and had a shortage of and poor quality artificial light.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It had been recognized for centuries that the coming of darkness to the unlit streets of a town brought a heightened threat of danger, and that the night provided cover to the disorderly and immoral, and to those bent on [[robbery]] or [[burglary]] or who in other ways threatened physical harm to people in the streets and in their houses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing and Punishment in London in 1660–1750|last=Beattie|first=J.M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-820867-7|location=Great Britain|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The anxieties that darkness gave rise to had been met by the formation of a night watch in the 13th century, and by the rules about who could use the streets after dark. These rules had for long been underpinned in London and other towns by the [[curfew]], the time (announced by the ringing of a bell) at which the gates closed and the streets were cleared. Only people with good reason to be abroad could then travel through the City.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing and Punishment in London 1660–1750|last=Beattie|first=J. M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-820867-7|location=|pages=169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anyone outside at night without reason or permission was suspicious and potentially criminal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lost Londons Change, Crime, and Control in the Capital City, 1550–1660 |last=Griffiths|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-17411-4|location=|pages=333}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Allowances were usually made for people who had some social status on their side. Lord Fielding clearly expected to pass through London's streets untroubled at 1 am one night in 1641, and he quickly became piqued when his coach was stopped by the watch, shouting huffily that it was a 'disgrace' to stop someone of such high standing as he, and telling the [[constable]] in charge of the watch that he would box him on the ears if he did not let his coach carry on back to his house. 'It is impossible' to 'distinguish a lord from another man by the outside of a coach', the [[constable]] said later in his defence, 'especially at unreasonable times'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lost Londons Change, Crime and Control in the Capital City, 1550–1660|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010 |isbn=978-0-521-17411-4|location=|pages=335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Formation of Watchmen ===
The [[Ordinance of 1233]] required the appointment of watchmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of English Law Before the Time of Edward I. |last1=Pollock |first1=Frederick |last2=Maitland |first2=Frederic William |year=1898 |page=565 |authorlink1=Sir Frederick Pollock, 3rd Baronet |authorlink2=Frederic William Maitland |volume=1 |edition=2 |isbn=978-1-58477-718-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JdisvDaHiIMC&amp;pg=PA565 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Essays on the Theory and Practice of Criminal Justice |last=Rich |first=Robert M. |year=1977 |page=50 |isbn=978-0-8191-0235-5 |quote=The origin of the exception goes back in English history to the Ordinance of 1233 which instituted night-watchmen, and directed them 'to arrest those who enter vills at night and go about armed.' Later the Ordinance of 1252 mentions 'disturbers of our peace.' |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Assize of Arms of 1252]], which required the appointment of [[constables]] to summon men to arms, quell [[breach of the peace|breaches of the peace]], and to deliver offenders to the [[sheriff]], is cited as one of the earliest creations of an English police force, as was the [[Statute of Winchester]] of 1285.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Police! |last1=Clarkson |first1=Charles Tempest |last2=Richardson |first2=J.

&lt;blockquote&gt;By order of the King of England the Winchester Act Mandating The Watch. Part Four and the King commandth that from henceforth all Watches be made as it hath been used in past times that was to wit from the day of Ascension unto the day of St. Michael&lt;ref&gt;That is, from  the Thursday 39 days after Easter Sunday to the 29th of September.&lt;/ref&gt; in every city by six men at every gate in every borough by twelve men in every town by six or four according to the number of inhabitants of the town. They shall keep the Watch all night from sun setting unto sun rising. And if any stranger do pass them by them he shall be arrested until morning and if no suspicion be found he shall go quit.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Later in 1279 [[Edward I of England|King Edward I]] formed a special guard of 20 [[sergeant at arms|sergeants at arms]] who carried decorated battle maces as a badge of official office. By 1415 a watch was appointed to the [[Parliament of England]] and in 1485 [[Henry VII of England|King Henry VII]] established a household watch that became known as the [[Beefeaters]].

After 1660 it seems that large numbers of men had avoided night-time service by paying for a substitute well before 1660{{Clarification needed|date=July 2018}}. Substitution had become so common by the late 17th century that the night watch was virtually by then a fully paid force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing and Punishment in London 1660'1750|last=Beattie |first=J.M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-820867-7|location=Great Britain|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1663 was promulgated  an act of Common Council, known as  'Robinson's Act' from the name of the sitting lord mayor, that confirmed the duty of all householders in the City to take their turn at watching in order 'to keep the peace and apprehend night-walkers, malefactors and suspected persons'. For the most part the Common Council Act of 1663 reiterated the rules and obligations that had long existed. The number of watchmen required for each ward, it declared, was to be the number 'established by custom' – in fact, by an act of 1621. Even though it had been true before the civil war that the watch had already become a body of paid men, supported by what were in effect the fines collected from those with an obligation to serve, the Common Council did not acknowledge this in the confirming Act of
1663.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing and Punishment in London in 1660–1750|last=Beattie|first=J.M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-820867-7|location=Great Britain|pages=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The act of 1663 confirmed that watch on its old foundations, and left its effective management to the ward authorities. The important matter to be arranged in the wards was who was going to serve and on what basis. How the money was to be collected to support a force of paid constables, and by whom, were crucial issues. The 1663 act left it to the ward beadle or a constable and it seems to have been increasingly the case that rather than individuals paying directly for a substitute, when their turn came to serve, the eligible householders were asked to contribute to a watch fund that supported hired man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing and Punishment in London in 1660–1750|last=Beattie|first=J.M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-820867-7|location=Great Britain|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the mid-1690s the City authorities made several attempts to replace Robinson's Act and establish the watch on a new footing. Though they did not say it directly, the overwhelming requirement was to get quotas adjusted to reflect the reality that the watch consisted of hired men rather than citizens doing their civic duty—the assumption upon which the 1663 act, and all previous acts, had been based.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing and Punishment in London in 1660–1750|last=Beattie |first=J.M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-820867-7|location=Great Brirain|pages=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The implications and consequences of changes in the watch were worked out in practice and in legislation in two stages between the Restoration and the middle decades of the 18th century. The first involved the gradual recognition that a paid (and full-time) watch needed to be differently constituted from one made up of unpaid citizens, a point accepted in practice in legislation passed by the Common Council in 1705, though it was not articulated in as direct a way.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing and Punishment in London in 1660–1750|last=Beattie|first=J.M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-820867-7|location=Great Britain|pages=173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fact that the 1705 act called for watchmen to be strong and able-bodied men seems further confirmation that the watch was now expected to be made up of hired hands rather than every male house holder serving in turn. The act of 1705 laid out the new quotas of watchmen and the disposition of watch-stands agreed to each ward. To discourage the corruption that had been blamed for earlier under-manning, it forbade constables to collect  and disturbs the money paid in for hired watchmen: that was now supposed to be the responsibility of the deputy and common councilmen of the ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing and Punishment in London in 1660–1750|last=Beattie|first=J.M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-820867-7|location=Great Britain|pages=186}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second stage was the recognition that watchmen could not be sustained without a major shift in the way local services were financed. This led to the City's acquisition of taxing power by means of an act of parliament in 1737 which changed the obligation to serve in person into an obligation to pay to support a force of salaried man.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Under the new act, the ward authorities also continued to hire their own watchmen and to make whatever local rules seemed appropriate—establishing, for example, the places in their wards where the watchmen would stand and the beats they would patrol. But the implementation of the new Watch Act did have the effect of imposing some uniformity on the watch over the whole City, making in the process some modest incursions into the local autonomy of the wards. One of the leading elements in the regime that emerged from the implementation of the new act was an agreement that every watchman would be paid the same amount and that the wages should be raised to thirteen pounds a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing and Punishment in London in 1660–1750|last=Beattie|first=J.M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001 |isbn=0-19-820867-7|location=Great Britain|pages=196}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1485 to the 1820s, in the absence of a police force, it was the parish-based watchmen who were responsible for keeping order in London's streets.{{Ref|Ward}}

=== Duties ===
Night watchmen patrolled the streets between 9 or 10 pm until sunrise, and were expected to examine all suspicious characters.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oldbaileyonline.org/static/Policing.jsp|title=Constables and the Night Watch|date=|accessdate=|publisher=oldbaileyonline.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such controls continued to be exercised in the late 17th century. Guarding the streets to prevent crime, to watch out for fires, and – despite the absence of a formal [[curfew]] – to ensure that suspicious and unauthorized people did not prowl around under cover of darkness was still the duty of night watch and the [[constable]]s who were supposed to command them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Polocing and Punishment in London 1660-1750|last=Beattie|first=J.M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0198208677|location=Great Britain|pages=170}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal task of the watch in 1660 and for long after continued to be the control of the streets at night  imposing a form of moral or social [[curfew]] that aimed to prevent those without legitimate reason to be abroad from wandering the streets at night. That task was becoming increasingly difficult in the 17th century because of the growth of the population and variety of ways in which the social and cultural life was being transformed. The shape of the urban day was being altered after the Restoration by  the development of [[Retail shop|shop]]s, [[tavern]]s and [[Coffeehouse|coffee-houses]], [[theatre]]s, the  [[opera]] and other places of entertainment. All these placed remained open in the evening and extended their hours of business and pleasure into the night.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing and Punishment in London in 1660-1750|last=Beattie|first=J.M.|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0198208677|location=Great Britain|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The watch was affected by this changing urban world since policing the night streets become more complicated when larger number of people were moving around. And what was frequently thought to be poor quality of the watchman—and in time, the lack of effective lighting—came commonly to be blamed when street crimes and night-time disorders seemed to be growing out of control.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Traditionally, householders served in the office of constable by appointment or rotation. During their year of office they performed their duties part-time alongside their normal employment. Similarly, householders were expected to serve by rotation on the nightly watch. From the late seventeenth century, however, many householders avoided these obligations by hiring deputies to serve in their place. As this practice increased, some men were able to make a living out of acting as deputy constables or as paid night watchmen. In the case of the watch, this procedure was formalized in many parts of London by the passage of "Watch Acts", which replaced householders' duty of service by a tax levied specifically for the purpose of hiring full-time watchmen. Some voluntary prosecution societies also hired men to patrol their areas.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Reputation ===
While the societies for the reformation of manners showed there was a good deal of support for the effective policing of morality, they also suggested that the existing mechanisms of crime control were regarded by some as ineffective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing A Short History|last=Rawlings|first=Philip|publisher=Willan Publishing|year=2002|isbn=1-903240-26-3|location=USA|pages=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Constable Dogberry's men from ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'' by Shakespeare would 'rather sleep than talk' may be dismissed as merely a dramatic device or a caricature, but successful dramatists nevertheless work with characters who strike a chord with their audience. A hundred years later such complaints were still commonplace. Daniel Defoe wrote four pamphlets and a broadsheet on the issue of street crime in which, among other things, he roundly attacked the efficacy of the watch and called for measures to ensure it 'be compos'd of stout, able-body'd Men, and of those a sufficient Number'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing  A Short History |last=Rawlings|first=Philip|publisher=Willan Publishing|year=2002|isbn=1-903240-26-3|location=USA|pages=65}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Watchmen on roads leading to London had a reputation for clumsiness in the late 1580s. It was a temptation on cold winter nights  to slip away early from watching stations to catch some sleep. [[Constable]]s in charge sometimes let watches go home early. 'The late placing and early dischargering' of night-watches concerned [[Common Council of the City of London|Common Council]] in 1609 and again 3 decades later when someone sent out to spy on watches reported that they 'break up longe before they ought'. 'The greatest parte of constables' broke up watches 'earlie in the morninge' at exactly the time 'when most danger' was 'feared' in the long night, leaving the dark streets to [[Theft|thieves]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lost Londons Change, Crime, and Control in the Capital City, 1550–1660|last=Griffiths |first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-17411-4|location=New York|pages=354–355}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We can imagine watchmen on chilly nights counting off the hours until sunrise. Alehouses offered some warmth, even after [[curfew]] bells told people to drink up. A group of watchmen sneaked into a 'vitlers' house one night in 1617 and stayed 'drinking and taking tobacco all night longe'.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lost Londons Change, Crime, and Control in the Capital City, 1550–1660|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-17411-4 |location=New York|pages=355}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other officers, watchmen could become the focus for trouble themselves, adding to the hullabaloo at night instead of ordering others to keep the noise down and go to bed. And as by day, there were more than a few crooked officers policing the streets at night, quite happy to turn a blind eye to trouble for a bribe. Watchman Edward Gardener was taken before the recorder with 'a common nightwalker' – Mary Taylor – in 1641 after he 'tooke 2s to lett' her 'escape' when he was escorting her to Bridewell late at night. Another watchman from over the river in Southwark took advantage of the tricky situation people suddenly found themselves in if they stumbled into the watch, 'demanding money [from them] for passing the watch'.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Common complaint in the 1690s was that watchmen were inadequately armed. This was another aspect of the watch in the process of being transformed. The Common Council acts required watchmen to carry [[halberd|halberds]], with some still doing so through the late seventeenth century. But it seems clear that few did, because the halberd was no longer suitable for the work they were being called upon to do. It was more often observed that watchmen failed to carry them, and it is surely the case that the halberd was no longer a useful weapon for a watch that was supposed to be mobile. By the second quarter of the 18th century, watchmen were equipped with a staff, along with their lantern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Policing and Punishment in London in 1660–1750|last=Beattie|first=J.M. |publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2001|isbn=0-19-820867-7|location=Great Britain|pages=181}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Watch houses ===
[[File:Georgian Watchman's Box c1810, Norfolk Crescent, Bath.jpg|thumb|A rare and unusually fine Georgian Watchman's Box of about 1810. [[Bath (Somerset)|Bath]], UK]]
Another step in the right direction was building 'watch howses' as the country lurched towards revolution after 1640. A City committee was asked to look into the question 'what watchhouses are necessary' and where 'for the safety of this cittye' in 1642. Workmen began building  watch houses in strategic spots soon after. They provided assembly-points for watchmen to gather to hear orders for the night ahead, somewhere to shelter from 'extremitye of wind and weather', and holding-places for suspects until morning when justices examined the night's catch. There were watch houses next to Temple Bar (1648), 'neere the Granaryes' by Bridewell (1648), 'neere Moregate' (1648), and next to St Paul's south door (1649). They were not big; the one on St. Paul's side was 'a small house or shed'. This was a time of experimentation, and people (including those in authority) were learning how to make best use of these new structures in their midst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lost Londons Change, Crime, and Control in the Capital City, 1550–1660|last=Griffiths|first=Paul|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2010|isbn=978-0-521-17411-4|location=New York|pages=359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Policing the Night Streets ===
The watchmen patrolled the streets at night, calling out the hour, keeping a lookout for fires, checking that doors were locked and ensuring that drunks and other vagrants were delivered to the watch [[constable]].&lt;ref&gt;A. Roger Ekirch, ''At Day’s Close: A History of Nighttime'', London: Weidenfeld and Nicolson, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; However, their low wages and the uncongenial nature of the job attracted a fairly low standard of person, and they acquired a possibly-exaggerated reputation for being old, ineffectual, feeble, drunk or asleep on the job.&lt;ref&gt;Philip McCouat, "Watchmen, goldfinders and the plague bearers of the night", ''Journal of Art in Society'', http://www.artinsociety.com/watchmen-goldfinders-and-the-plague-bearers-of-the-night.html&lt;/ref&gt;

London had a system of night policing in place
before 1660, although it was improved over the next century through better lighting,
administrations, finances, and better and more regular salaries. But the
essential elements of the night-watch were performing completely by the middle
of the seventeenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Lost Londons Change, Crime, and Control in the Capital City, 1550-1660|last = Griffiths|first = Paul|publisher = Cambridge University Press|year = 2010|isbn = 9780521174114|location = New York|pages = 359}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1820s, mounting crime levels and increasing political and industrial disorder prompted calls for reform, led by [[Sir Robert Peel]], which culminated in the demise of the watchmen and their replacement by a uniformed [[Metropolitan Police Service|metropolitan police force]].&lt;ref&gt;Philip Rawlings, ''Policing: A Short History'', Willan Publishing, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;McCouat, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Watchmen in the United States of America==

The first form of societal protection in the [[United States]] was based on practices developed in England. The City of [[Boston]] was the first settlement in the 13 colonies to establish a night watch in 1631.[http://www.nleomf.com/TheMemorial/Facts/impdates.htm] [[New York City|New York]] (then [[New Amsterdam]]) and [[Jamestown, Virginia|Jamestown]] followed in 1658.

==Watchmen and modern police==
With the unification of laws and centralization of state power (''e.g.'' the [[Municipal Police Act]] of 1844 in [[New York City]], [[United States]]), such formations became increasingly incorporated into state-run police force (see [[metropolitan police]] and [[municipal police]]).

Watchmen still exist under Florida statutes and are recognised / given special dispensation in law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=watchman&amp;URL=0800-0899/0843/Sections/0843.06.html |title=Statutes &amp; Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine |publisher=Leg.state.fl.us |date= |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/statutes/index.cfm?mode=View%20Statutes&amp;SubMenu=1&amp;App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;Search_String=watchman&amp;URL=0800-0899/0843/Sections/0843.08.html |title=Statutes &amp; Constitution :View Statutes : Online Sunshine |publisher=Leg.state.fl.us |date= |accessdate=2015-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
