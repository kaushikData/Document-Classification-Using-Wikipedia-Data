The '''Agricultural Party''' was a minor [[political party]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  It was founded in 1931 as the '''Norfolk Farmers' Party''' but changed its name one week after its formation.&lt;ref name="craig"&gt;[[F. W. S. Craig]], ''Minor Parties at British Parliamentary Elections''&lt;/ref&gt;  It initially had the support of the [[National Farmers Union (England and Wales)|National Farmers Union]], [[Lord Rothermere]] and [[Lord Beaverbrook]].&lt;ref name="barberis"&gt;Peter Barberis, John McHugh and Mike Tyldesley, ''Encyclopedia of British and Irish Political Organizations''&lt;/ref&gt;

The party called for [[Empire free trade]], agricultural protection, and the introduction of duties on food imports.&lt;ref name="craig" /&gt;  It stood candidates in the [[United Kingdom general election, 1931|1931 general election]] and again in the [[East Fife by-election, 1933|East Fife by-election]] in 1933, but without success, and it lost its high-profile supporters.  It appears to have been disbanded in the late 1940s.&lt;ref name="barberis" /&gt;

'''Akhil Bharatiya Jan Sangh''' (अखिल भारतीय जनसंघ, All India Popular Union) is a [[Hindu nationalism|Hindu nationalist]] [[political party]] in [[India]]. 

The party claims to be the authentic [[Bharatiya Jan Sangh]], which was the precursor of the [[Bharatiya Janata Party]]. The ABJS was founded by [[Balraj Madhok]], a founding secretary and 9th National President of BJS, who had been expelled from that party in 1973 after he left the [[Janata Party]] in 1979. Madhok remains a leading figure in the ABJS.

This time the National President is  (Dr.) Acharya Bharat Bhushan Pandey and Secretary General of the ABJS is Sri Samir Singh Chandel.

The ABJS presses for the rehabilitation of [[Kashmiri Pandits]] and the scrapping of [[Article 370]] of the [[Indian Constitution]].

In the [[2014 Indian General Election]], the ABJS did not win a single seat in the [[Lok Sabha|National Parliament]].&lt;ref name=DNA&gt;{{cite news|title=Akhil Bharatiya Jana Sangh|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/lok-sabha-elections-2014/results/parties/akhil-bharatiya-jan-sangh|accessdate=9 August 2014|publisher=DNA|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allan Octavian Hume''', [[Order of the Bath|CB]] [[Indian Civil Service|ICS]] (6 June 1829 – 31 July 1912) was a member of the [[Imperial Civil Service]] (later the Indian Civil Service), a political reformer, [[ornithologist]] and [[botanist]] who worked in [[British India]]. He was one of the founders of the [[Indian National Congress]], a political party that was later to lead in the [[Indian independence movement]]. A notable ornithologist, Hume has been called "the Father of Indian Ornithology" and, by those who found him dogmatic, "the Pope of Indian ornithology".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Ali, S.|authorlink=Salim Ali|year=1979| title= Bird study in India: Its history and its importance. Azad Memorial lecture for 1978|publisher=[[Indian Council for Cultural Relations]]. New Delhi|url=https://archive.org/details/AzadMemorialBirds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As an administrator of [[Etawah]], he saw the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] as a result of misgovernance and made great efforts to improve the lives of the common people. The district of Etawah was among the first to be returned to normality and over the next few years Hume's reforms led to the district being considered a model of development. Hume rose in the ranks of the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Service]] but like his father [[Joseph Hume]], the [[Political radicalism|radical]] MP, he was bold and outspoken in questioning British policies in India. He rose in 1871 to the position of secretary to the Department of Revenue, Agriculture, and Commerce under [[Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo|Lord Mayo]]. His criticism of [[Lord Lytton]] however led to his removal from the Secretariat in 1879.

He founded the journal ''Stray Feathers'' in which he and his subscribers recorded notes on birds from across India. He built up a vast collection of bird specimens at his home in [[Shimla]] by making collection expeditions and obtaining specimens through his network of correspondents.

Following the loss of manuscripts that he had long been maintaining in the hope of producing a [[masterpiece|magnum opus]] on the birds of India, he abandoned [[ornithology]] and gave his collection to the [[Natural History Museum, London|Natural History Museum]] in [[London]], where it continues to be the single largest [[bird collections|collection]] of Indian bird skins. He was briefly a follower of the theosophical movement founded by [[Helena Petrovna Blavatsky|Madame Blavatsky]]. He left India in 1894 to live in London from where he continued to take an interest in the Indian National Congress, apart from taking an interest in botany and founding the [[South London Botanical Institute]] towards the end of his life.

==Life and career==
=== Early life ===
Hume was born at [[St Mary Cray]], [[Kent]],&lt;ref&gt;Moulton (2004); ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' and some older sources give his birthplace as [[Montrose, Angus|Montrose]], [[Forfarshire]].&lt;/ref&gt; a younger son (and the eighth child in a family of nine)&lt;ref name=yorkshireobit&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer|date=1 August 1912|title=Obituary|page=8|accessdate=4 July 2014|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000687/19120801/123/0008| publisher = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Joseph Hume]], the Radical member of parliament, by his marriage to Maria Burnley.&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt; He was educated at [[University College Hospital]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=University of London |work=Morning Post|date=16 July 1845 |accessdate=4 July 2014|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18450716/007/0004| publisher = [[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; where he studied [[medicine]] and [[surgery]] and was then nominated to the [[Indian Civil Service (British India)|Indian Civil Services]] which led him to study at the [[East India Company College|East India Company College, Haileybury]]. Early influences included his friend [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Herbert Spencer]].&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;

=== Etawah (1849&amp;ndash;1867) ===
Hume sailed to [[British India|India]] in 1849 and the following year, joined the Bengal Civil Service at [[Etawah]] in the [[North-Western Provinces]], in what is now [[Uttar Pradesh]]. His career in India included service as a district officer from 1849 to 1867, head of a central department from 1867 to 1870, and secretary to the Government from 1870 to 1879.&lt;ref name="Wedderburn 1913:3"&gt;Wedderburn (1913):3&lt;/ref&gt; He married Mary Anne Grindall (26 May 1824, Meerut - March 1890, Simla) in 1853.&lt;ref name="moulton"&gt;{{cite book|author=Moulton, Edward |year=2003|chapter=The Contributions of Allan O. Hume to the Scientific Advancement of Indian Ornithology| title=Petronia: Fifty Years of Post-Independence Ornithology in India|editors=J. C. Daniel and G. W. Ugra|publisher=BNHS, Bombay &amp; Oxford University Press|location=New Delhi, India|pages=295–317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was only nine years after his entry to India that Hume faced the [[Indian Rebellion of 1857]] during which time he was involved in several military actions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1883|title=Indian Districtions during the Revolt|url=https://archive.org/stream/armyandnavymaga00rngoog#page/n112/mode/2up|journal=The Army and Navy Magazine|volume=6|pages=97–109|author=Keene, H.G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/fiftysevensomeac00keenrich#page/52/mode/2up|title=Fifty-Seven.

Initially it appeared that he was safe in [[Etawah]], not far from [[Meerut]] where the rebellion began but this changed and Hume had to take refuge in [[Agra]] fort for six months.&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913):11–12&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, all but one Indian official remained loyal and Hume resumed his position in Etawah in January 1858. He built up an irregular force of 650 loyal Indian troops and took part in engagements with them. Hume blamed British ineptitude for the uprising and pursued a policy of "mercy and forbearance".&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{cite book|author=Moulton, Edward C. |chapter=Hume, Allan Octavian (1829–1912)|title=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2004|url= http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/34049}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only seven persons were executed at the gallows on his orders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Trevelyan, George|title=The Competition Wallah|year=1895| publisher=Macmillan and Co.|place=London|page=246|url= https://archive.org/details/competitionwalla00trevuoft/page/246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The district of Etawah was restored to peace and order in a year, something that was not possible in most other parts.&lt;ref name="Wedderburn 1913:19"&gt;Wedderburn (1913):19&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after 1857, he set about in a range of reforms. As a District Officer in the Indian Civil Service, he began introducing free primary education and held public meetings for their support. He made changes in the functioning of the police department and the separation of the judicial role. Noting that there was very little reading material with educational content, he started, along with Koour Lutchman Singh, a Hindi language periodical, ''Lokmitra'' (''The People's Friend'') in 1859. Originally meant only for Etawah, its fame spread.&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913):21&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The system of departmental examinations introduced soon after (''Hume joined the civil services'') enabled Hume so to outdistance his seniors that when the rebellion broke out he was officiating Collector of [[Etawah]], which lies between [[Agra]] and [[Kanpur|Cawnpur]]. Rebel troops were constantly passing through the district, and for a time it was necessary to abandon headquarters ; but both before and after the removal of the women and children to Agra, Hume acted with vigour and judgment. The steadfast loyalty of many native officials and landowners, and the people generally, was largely due to his influence, and enabled him to raise a local brigade of horse. In a daring attack on a body of rebels at [[Jaswantnagar]] he carried away the wounded joint magistrate, Mr. Clearmont Daniel,&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913) spells Daniell.&lt;/ref&gt; under a heavy fire, and many months later he engaged in a desperate action against Firoz Shah and his Oudh freebooters at Hurchandpur. Company rule had come to an end before the ravines of the Jumna and the Chambul in the district had been cleared of fugitive rebels. Hume richly merited the C.B. (Civil division) awarded him in 1860. He remained in charge of the district for ten years or so and did good work.|Obituary ''The Times'' of August 1st, 1912}}

He took up the cause of education and founded scholarships for higher education. He wrote, in 1859, that education played a key role in avoiding revolts like the one in 1857: &lt;blockquote&gt;''... assert its supremacy as it may at the bayonet's point, a free and civilized government must look for its stability and permanence to the enlightenment of the people and their moral and intellectual capacity to appreciate its blessings.''&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1863 he moved for separate schools for juvenile delinquents rather than flogging and imprisonment which he saw as producing hardened criminals. His efforts led to a juvenile reformatory not far from Etawah. He also started free schools in Etawah and by 1857 he established 181 schools with 5186 students including two girls.&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913):16&lt;/ref&gt; The high school that he helped build with his own money is still in operation, now as a junior college, and it was said to have a floor plan resembling the letter "H". This, according to some was an indication of Hume's imperial ego.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Wallach, Bret |year=1996| title= Losing Asia: Modernization and the Culture of Development|publisher=The Johns Hopkins Press|url=http://ags.ou.edu/~bwallach/documents/Losing%20Asia%20-%20Ch%205.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume found the idea of earning revenue earned through liquor traffic repulsive and described it as "The wages of sin". With his progressive ideas on social reform, he advocated women's education, was against infanticide and enforced widowhood. Hume laid out in Etawah, a neatly gridded commercial district that is now known as Humeganj but often pronounced ''Homeganj''.&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt;

=== Commissioner of Customs (1867-1870) ===
In 1867 Hume became Commissioner of Customs for the North West Province, and in 1870 he became attached to the central government as Director-General of Agriculture. In 1879 he returned to provincial government at [[Allahabad]].&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Wedderburn 1913:19"/&gt;


{{quote|Hume's appointment, in 1867, to be Commissioner of Customs in Upper India gave him charge of the [[Great Hedge of India|huge physical barrier]]&lt;ref&gt;Footnote in Lydekker, 1913: This was a thorn-hedge supplemented by walls and ditches, and strongly patrolled for preventing the introduction into British territory of untaxed salt from native states (see Sir [[John Strachey (civil servant)|John Strachey]]'s "India," London, 1888).&lt;/ref&gt; which stretched across the country for 2,500 miles from Attock, on the Indus, to the confines of the Madras Presidency. He carried out the first negotiations with Rajputana Chiefs, leading to the abolition of this barrier, and [[Richard Bourke, 6th Earl of Mayo|Lord Mayo]] rewarded him with the Secretaryship to Government in the Home, and afterwards, from 1871, in the Revenue and Agricultural Departments.&lt;ref name=biggame&gt;{{cite book|author=Lydekker, R. |year=1913| title= Catalogue of the Heads and Horns of Indian Big Game bequeathed by A. O. Hume, C. B., to the British Museum|url=https://archive.org/details/catalogueofheads00britrich |publisher=British Museum of Natural History}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Secretary to the Department of Revenue, Agriculture and Commerce (1871-1879) ===
Hume was very interested in the development of agriculture. He believed that there was too much focus on obtaining revenue and no effort had been spent on improving the efficiency of agriculture. He found an ally in Lord Mayo who supported the idea of developing a complete department of agriculture. Hume noted in his ''Agricultural reform in India'' that Lord Mayo had been the only Viceroy who had any experience of working in the fields.

Hume made a number of suggestions for the improvement of agriculture placing carefully gathered evidence for his ideas. He noted the poor yields of wheat, comparing the yields that he had estimated with the records of Emperor Akbar and the yield of farms in Norfolk. Lord Mayo supported his ideas but was unable to establish a dedicated agricultural bureau as the scheme did not find support in the Secretary of State for India, but they negotiated the setting up of a ''Department of Revenue, Agriculture and Commerce'' despite Hume's insistence that ''Agriculture'' be the first and foremost aim. Hume was made a secretary of this department in July 1871 leading to his move to [[Shimla]].

With the murder of Lord Mayo in the Andamans in 1872, Hume lost patronage and support for his work. He however went about reforming the department of agriculture, streamlining the collection of meteorological data (the [[Indian Meteorological Department|meteorological department]] was set up by order number 56 on 27 September 1875 signed by Hume&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Markham|first=Clements R.|title=A memoir on the Indian Surveys|edition=2|year=1878|page=307|url=https://archive.org/stream/memoirontheindia025502mbp#page/n338/mode/1up|publisher=W.H. Allen and Co.|place=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and statistics on cultivation and yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=172–186|url=https://archive.org/stream/HistoryAgricultureIndia3/AgriHistory3#page/n195/mode/2up/|title=A history of agriculture in India. Volume III. 1757-1947|author=Randhawa, M.S.|publisher=Indian Council of Agricultural Research|location=New Delhi, India| year=1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume proposed the idea of having experimental farms to demonstrate best practices to be set up in every district. He proposed to develop fuelwood plantations "in every village in the drier portions of the country" and thereby provide a substitute heating and cooking fuel so that manure (dried cattle dung was used as fuel by the poor) could be returned to the land. Such plantations, he wrote, were "''a thing that is entirely in accord with the traditions of the country  –  a thing that the people would understand, appreciate, and, with a little judicious pressure, cooperate in.''" He wanted model farms to be established in every district. He noted that rural indebtedness was caused mainly by the use of land as security, a practice that had been introduced by the British. Hume denounced it as another of "''the cruel blunders into which our narrow-minded, though wholly benevolent, desire to reproduce England in India has led us.''" Hume also wanted government-run banks, at least until cooperative banks could be established.&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/companycrown00thurrich#page/88/mode/2up| page=89| title=The Company and the Crown| author=Hovell-Thurlow, T.J. | publisher=William Blackwood and Sons| place=Edinburgh| year=1866}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The department also supported the publication of several manuals on aspects of cultivation, a list of which Hume included as an appendix to his ''Agricultural Reform in India''. Hume supported the introduction of cinchona and the project managed by [[George King (botanist)|George King]] to produce quinine locally at low cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Peruvian Bark. A popular account of the introduction of Chinchona cultivation into British India|author=Markham, Clements R.|year=1880|publisher=John Murray|location=London, UK|url=https://archive.org/stream/cu31924000273429#page/n461/mode/2up|pages=427–434}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume was very outspoken and never feared to criticise when he thought the Government was in the wrong. Even in 1861, he objected to the concentration of police and judicial functions in the hands of police superintendents. In March 1861, he took a medical leave due to a breakdown from overwork and departed for Britain. Before leaving, he condemned the flogging and punitive measures initiated by the provincial government as 'barbarous … torture'. He was allowed to return to Etawah only after apologising for the tone of his criticism.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; He criticised the administration of [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]] before 1879 which according to him, had cared little for the welfare and aspiration of the people of India.

Lord Lytton's foreign policy according to Hume had led to the waste of "millions and millions of Indian money".&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt; Hume was critical of the land revenue policy and suggested that it was the cause of [[poverty in India]]. His superiors were irritated and attempted to restrict his powers and this led him to publish a book on ''Agricultural Reform in India'' in 1879.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hume, A. O. |year=1879| url=https://archive.org/details/agriculturalrefo00hume |title=Agricultural Reform in India|publisher=W H Allen and Co. |location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume noted that the free and honest expression was not only permitted but encouraged under Lord Mayo and that this freedom was curtailed under Lord Northbrook who succeeded Lord Mayo. When Lord Lytton succeeded Lord Northbrook, the situation worsened for Hume.&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913):37&lt;/ref&gt; In 1879 Hume went against the authorities.&lt;ref name="Wedderburn 1913:3"/&gt; The Government of Lord Lytton dismissed him from his position in the Secretariat. No clear reason was given except that it "''was based entirely on the consideration of what was most desirable in the interests of the public service''".

The press declared that his main wrongdoing was that he was too honest and too independent. The ''Pioneer'' wrote that it was "''the grossest jobbery ever perpetrated''" ; the ''Indian Daily News'' wrote that it was a "great wrong" while ''The Statesman'' said that "undoubtedly he has been treated shamefully and cruelly." ''The Englishman'' in an article dated 27 June 1879, commenting on the event stated, "There is no security or safety now for officers in Government employment."&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913):35–38&lt;/ref&gt; Demoted, he left Simla and returned to the North-West Provinces in October, 1879, as a member of the Board of Revenue.&lt;ref name=jsas/&gt; It has pointed out that he was victimised as he was out of step with the policies of the Government, often intruding into aspects of administration with critical opinions.&lt;ref name=jsas/&gt;

=== Demotion and resignation (1879-1882) ===
In spite of the humiliation of demotion, he did not resign immediately from service and it has been suggested that this was because he needed his salary to support the publication of ''The Game Birds of India'' that he was working on.&lt;ref name=jsas/&gt; Hume retired from the civil service only in 1882. In 1883 he wrote an open letter to the graduates of [[Calcutta University]], calling upon them to form their own national political movement. This led in 1885 to the first session of the Indian National Congress held in [[Bombay]].&lt;ref name=inc&gt;{{cite book|pages=12–13 | title= The history of the Indian National Congress (1885–1935)|author=Sitaramayya, B.

Volume 3|year=1968|publisher=Blavatsky Writings Publication Fund|page=xxvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume's grandson Allan Hume Scott served with the Royal Engineers in India.

Hume left India in 1894 and settled at The Chalet, 4 Kingswood Road, [[Upper Norwood]] in south [[London]]. He died at the age of eighty-three on 31 July 1912. His ashes were buried in [[Brookwood Cemetery]].&lt;ref name=yorkshireobit /&gt; The bazaar in Etawah was closed on hearing of his death and the Collector, H. R. Neville, presided over a memorial meeting.&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913):134&lt;/ref&gt;

The Indian postal department issued a commemorative stamp with his portrait in 1973 and a [[philatelic cover|special cover]] depicting Rothney Castle, his home in Shimla, was released in 2013.

==Contribution to ornithology and natural history==
From early days, Hume had a special interest in science. Science, he wrote:
{{quotation|...teaches men to take an interest in things outside and beyond… The gratification of the animal instinct and the sordid and selfish cares of worldly advancement; it teaches a love of truth for its own sake and leads to a purely disinterested exercise of intellectual faculties}}
and of natural history he wrote in 1867:&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt;
{{quotation|... alike to young and old, the study of Natural History in all its branches offers, next to religion, the most powerful safeguard against those worldly temptations to which all ages are exposed. There is no department of natural science the faithful study of which does not leave us with juster and loftier views of the greatness, goodness, and wisdom of the Creator, that does not leave us less selfish and less worldly, less spiritually choked up with those devil's thorns, the love of dissipation, wealth, power, and place, that does not, in a word, leave us wiser, better and more useful to our fellow-men.}}
[[File:Rothney Castle Shimla.jpg|thumb|Map of the Crags and Rothney Castle, Shimla (1872)]]
During his career in Etawah, he built a personal collection of bird specimens, however it was destroyed during the 1857 rebellion. Subsequently, he started afresh with a systematic plan to survey and document the birds of the Indian Subcontinent and in the process he accumulated the largest collection of Asiatic birds in the world, which he housed in a museum and library at his home in Rothney Castle on Jakko Hill, [[Shimla|Simla]]. Rothney Castle, originally Rothney House was built by Colonel Octavius Edward Rothney and later belonged to P. Mitchell, C.I.E from whom Hume bought it and converted it into a palatial house with some hope that it might be bought by the Government as a Viceregal residence since the Governor-General then occupied ''Peterhoff'', a building too small for large parties. Hume spent over two hundred thousand pounds on the grounds and buildings. He added enormous reception rooms suitable for large dinner parties and balls, as well as a magnificent conservatory and spacious hall with walls displaying his superb collection of Indian horns. He used a large room for his bird museum. He hired a European gardener, and made the grounds and conservatory a perpetual horticultural exhibition, to which he courteously admitted all visitors. Rothney Castle could only be reached by a steep road, and was never purchased by the British Government.&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt;&lt;ref name=buck&gt;{{cite book|author= Buck, Edward J.| title= Simla.

Hume made several expeditions to collect birds both on health leave and where work took him. He was Collector and Magistrate of Etawah from 1856 to 1867 during which time he studied the birds of that area. He later became Commissioner of Inland Customs which made him responsible for the control of {{convert|2500|mi|km}} of coast from near Peshawar in the northwest to Cuttack on the Bay of Bengal. He travelled on horseback and camel in areas of Rajasthan to negotiate treaties with various local maharajas to control the export of salt and during these travels he took note of the birdlife:

{{quotation|
The nests are placed indifferently on all kinds of trees (I have notes of finding them on mango, plum, orange, tamarind, toon, etc.), never at any great elevation from the ground, and usually in small trees, be the kind chosen what it may. Sometimes a high hedgerow, such as our great [[Great Hedge of India|Customs hedge]], is chosen, and occasionally a solitary caper or stunted acacia-bush.|On the nesting of the [[Bay-backed Shrike]] (''Lanius vittatus'') in ''The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds''.}}

Hume appears to have planned a comprehensive work on the birds of India around 1870 and this "forthcoming comprehensive work" finds mention in the second edition of ''The Cyclopaedia of India'' (1871) by his cousin [[Edward Balfour]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url =https://archive.org/stream/cyclopdiaindiaa00unkngoog#page/n452/mode/1up|title=The Cyclopaedia of India and of Eastern and Southern Asia, Commercial, Industrial and Scientific.

In March 1873, he visited the Andaman and Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal along with geologists Dr. [[Ferdinand Stoliczka]] and Dr. Dougall of the Geological Survey of India and [[James Wood-Mason]] of the Indian Museum in Calcutta. In 1875, he made an expedition to the [[Lakshadweep|Laccadive Islands]] aboard the marine survey vessel IGS ''Clyde'' under the command of Staff-Commander Ellis. The official purpose of the visit being to examine proposed sites for lighthouses. During this expedition Hume collected many bird specimens, apart from conducting a bathymetric survey to determine whether the island chain was separated from India by a deep canyon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|volume=4|year=1876|url= https://archive.org/stream/strayfeathersjou41876hume#page/412/mode/2up |pages=413–483 |title=The Laccadives and the west coast|author=Hume, A.O.|journal=Stray Feathers}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/generalreporton04survgoog#page/n25/mode/1up/|pages=7, 16–17|chapter=Southern India and Laccadive Islands (I.G.S.

===Collection===
[[File:Rothney_Castle2.jpg|thumb|Rothney Castle, conservatory and facade (2016).]]
Hume used his vast bird collection to good use as editor of his journal ''Stray Feathers''. He also intended to produce a comprehensive publication on the birds of India. Hume employed [[William Ruxton Davison]], who was brought to notice by [[George King (botanist)|Dr. George King]], as a curator for his personal bird collection. Hume trained Davison and sent him out annually on collection trips to various parts of India as he himself was held up with official responsibilities.&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt; In 1883 Hume returned from a trip to find that many pages of the manuscripts that he had maintained over the years had been stolen and sold off as waste paper by a servant. Hume was completely devastated and he began to lose interest in ornithology due to this theft and a landslip, caused by heavy rains in Simla, which had damaged his museum and many of the specimens. He wrote to the [[British Museum]] wishing to donate his collection on certain conditions. One of the conditions was that the collection was to be examined by Dr. [[Richard Bowdler Sharpe|R. Bowdler Sharpe]] and personally packed by him, apart from raising Dr. Sharpe's rank and salary due to the additional burden on his work caused by his collection. The British Museum was unable to heed his many conditions. It was only in 1885 after the destruction of nearly 20000 specimens, that alarm bells were raised by Dr. Sharpe and the museum authorities let him visit India to supervise the transfer of the specimens to the British Museum.&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt;

Sharpe wrote of Hume's impressive private ornithological museum:&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rothney/&gt;
{{quotation|I arrived at Rothney Castle about 10 am on the 19th of May, and was warmly welcomed by Mr Hume, who lives in a most picturesque situation high up on Jakko…From my bedroom window, I had a fine view of the snowy range. Although somewhat tired by my jolt in the Tonga from [[Solan|Solun]], I gladly accompanied Mr. Hume at once into the museum…I had heard so much from my friends, who knew the collection intimately,…that I was not so much surprised when at last I stood in the celebrated museum and gazed at the dozens upon dozens of tin cases which filled the room. Before the landslip occurred, which carried away one end of the museum, It must have been an admirably arranged building, quite three times as large as our meeting-room at the Zoological Society, and…much more lofty. Throughout this large room went three rows of table cases with glass tops, in which were arranged a series of the birds of India sufficient for the identification of each species, while underneath these table- cases where enormous cabinets made of tin, with trays inside, containing species of birds in the table cases above. All of the rooms were racks reaching up to the ceiling, and containing immense cases full of birds… On the western side of the museum was the library, reached by a descent of three steps, a cheerful room, furnished with large tables, and containing besides the egg-cabinets, a well-chosen set of working-volumes. One ceases to wonder at the amount of work its owner got through when the excellent plan of his museum is considered. In a few minutes an immense series of specimens could be spread out on the tables, while all the books were at hand for immediate reference…After explaining to me the contents of the museum, we went below into the basement, which consisted of eight great rooms, six of them full, from floor to ceiling, of cases of birds, while at the back of the house two large verandahs were piled high with cases full of large birds, such as Pelicans, Cranes, Vultures, &amp;c. An inspection of a great cabinet containing a further series of about 5000 eggs completed our survey. Mr. Hume gave me the keys of the museum, and I was free to commence my task at once.}}

Sharpe also noted:&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt;&lt;ref name=rothney /&gt;
{{quotation|Mr. Hume was a naturalist of no ordinary calibre, and this great collection will remain a monument of his genius and energy of its founder long after he who formed it has passed away...Such a private collection as Mr. Hume's is not likely to be formed again; for it is doubtful if such a combination of genius for organisation with energy for the completion of so great a scheme, and the scientific knowledge requisite for its proper development will again be combined in a single individual.}}

The Hume collection of birds was packed into 47 cases made of [[Cedrus deodara|deodar wood]] constructed on site without nails that could potentially damage specimens and each case weighing about half a ton was transported down the hill to a bullock cart to Kalka and finally the port in Bombay. The material that went to the British Museum in 1885 consisted of 82,000 specimens of which 75,577 were finally placed in the museum. A breakup of that collection is as follows (old names retained).&lt;ref name="moulton"/&gt; Hume had destroyed 20,000 specimens prior to this as they had been damaged by [[Dermestidae|dermestid]] beetles.&lt;ref name=rothney&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/page/8615524|journal=Ibis|title=The Hume Collection of Indian Birds|author=Anon.|pages=456–462|year=1885|volume=3|doi=10.1111/j.1474-919X.1885.tb06259.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hume Collection contained 258 [[Biological type|type specimens]].

The egg collection was made up of carefully authenticated contributions from knowledgeable contacts and on the authenticity and importance of the collection, E. W. Oates wrote in the 1901 ''Catalogue of the Collection of Birds' Eggs in the British Museum'' (Volume 1):
{{quotation|The Hume Collection consists almost entirely of the eggs of Indian birds. Mr. Hume seldom or never purchased a specimen, and the large collection brought together by him in the course of many years was the result of the willing co-operation of numerous friends resident in India and Burma. Every specimen in the collection may be said to have been properly authenticated by a competent naturalist; and the history of most of the clutches has been carefully recorded in Mr. Hume's 'Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds', of which two editions have been published.}}

Hume and his collector Davison took an interest in plants as well. Specimens were collected even on the first expedition to the Lakshadweep in 1875 were studied by George King and later by David Prain. Hume's herbarium specimens were donated to the collection of the Botanical Survey of India at Calcutta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|year=1890 |title=A List of Laccadive plants |journal=Scientific memoirs by medical officers of the Army of India |url=https://archive.org/stream/b24758383_0005#page/46/mode/2up |author=Prain, David |pages=47–69}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''My Scrap Book: Or Rough Notes on Indian Oology and Ornithology'' (1869)===
[[File:HumeScrapbook.jpg|thumb|Dedication of "My Scrap Book" to Blyth and Jerdon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hume, A. O. |year=1896|url=https://archive.org/details/myscrapbookorrou00hume |title=My scrap book: or rough notes on Indian zoology and ornithology|publisher=Baptist Mission Press, Calcutta}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
This was Hume's first major work on birds. It had 422 pages and accounts of 81 species. It was dedicated to [[Edward Blyth]] and Dr. [[Thomas C. Jerdon]] who, he wrote ''[had] done more for Indian Ornithology than all other modern observers put together'' and he described himself as ''their friend and pupil''. He hoped that his book would form a ''nucleus round which future observation may crystallize'' and that others around the country could help him ''fill in many of the woeful blanks remaining in record''. In the preface he notes:
{{quote|...if these notes chance to be of the slightest use to you, use them; if not burn them, if it so please you, but do not waste your time in abusing me or them, since no one ''can'' think more poorly of them than I do myself.}}

===''Stray Feathers''===
Hume started the quarterly journal ''[[Stray Feathers]]'' in 1872. At that time the only journal for the Indian region that published on ornithology was the "Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal". He had wondered if there was merit to start a new journal and in that idea was supported by Stoliczka, who was an editor for the Journal of the Asiatic Society:
{{quote|To return; the notion that ''Stray Feathers'' might possibly interfere in any way with our scientific palladium, the ''[[Journal of the Asiatic Society of Bengal]]'', is much like that entertained in England, when I was a boy, as to the probable effects of Railways on road and canal traffic.|Hume, 1874&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=[Editorial]|author=Hume, A. O.|url=https://archive.org/stream/strayfeathersjou21874hume#page/n13/mode/1up |page=2|volume=2|year=1874|journal=Stray Feathers}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
[[File:StrayFeathers.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Cover of ''Stray Feathers'']]
He used the journal to publish descriptions of his new discoveries, such as Hume's owl, Hume's wheatear and Hume's whitethroat. He wrote extensively on his own observation as well as critical reviews of all the ornithological works of the time and earned himself the nickname of ''Pope of Indian ornithology''. He critiqued a monograph on parrots, ''Die Papageien'' by [[Otto Finsch|Friedrich Hermann Otto Finsch]] suggesting that name changes (by "cabinet naturalists") were aimed at claiming authority to species without the trouble of actually discovering them. He wrote:
{{quote|Let us treat our author as he treats other people's species. “Finsch!” contrary to all rules of orthography! What is that “s” doing there? “Finch!” Dr. ''Fringilla'', MIHI! Classich gebildetes wort!!|Hume, 1874&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hume, A.

Hume in turn was attacked, for instance by Viscount Walden, but Finsch became a friend and Hume named a species, ''[[Psittacula finschii]]'', after him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hume, A. O. |year=1874|title= Viscount Walden, president of the Zoological Society, on the editor of "Stray Feathers"|journal=Stray Feathers|volume=2|pages=533–535|url=https://archive.org/stream/strayfeathersjou21874hume#page/533/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce, Murray |year=2003|chapter=Foreword: A brief history of classifying birds|title=The Handbook of the Birds of the World.

[[File:Rainfall map Hume 1878.jpg|thumb|Hume was among the first to recognize an association between the avifaunal composition and rainfall distribution. This rainfall map was published in volume 8 of ''Stray Feathers'' (1878).]]
In his younger days Hume had studied some geology from the likes of [[Gideon Mantell]]&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913):116.&lt;/ref&gt; and he appreciated the synthesis of ideas from other fields in ornithology. Hume included in 1872, a detailed article on the osteology of birds in relation to their classification written by [[Richard Lydekker]] who was then in the Geological Survey of India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Elementary sketch of the osteology of birds|author=Lydekker, R.|pages=1–36|journal=Stray Feathers|volume=8|issue=1|year=1879|url=https://archive.org/stream/strayfeathersjou81879hume#page/n13/mode/2up}}&lt;/ref&gt; The early meteorological work in India was done within the department headed by Hume and he saw the value of meteorology in the study of bird distributions. In a work comparing the rainfall zones, he notes how the high rainfall zones indicated affinities to the Malayan fauna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Influence of rainfall on distribution of species|pages=501–502|year=1878|journal=Stray Feathers|volume=7|url=https://archive.org/stream/strayfeathersjou71878hume#page/501/mode/1up}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=On the zoo-geographical areas of the world, illustrating the distribution of birds|pages=100–108| author=Sharpe, Bowdler |year=1893|url= https://archive.org/stream/naturalscience03lond#page/106/mode/2up|journal=Natural Science|volume=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hume sometimes mixed personal beliefs in notes that he published in ''Stray Feathers''. For instance he believed that vultures soared by altering the physics ("altered polarity") of their body and repelling the force of gravity. He further noted that this ability was normal in birds and could be acquired by humans by maintaining spiritual purity claiming that he knew of at least three Indian Yogis and numerous saints in the past with this ability of ''aethrobacy''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hume, A.

===Network of correspondents===
[[File:HumeCorrespondents.png|thumb|Distribution and density of Hume's correspondents across India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Shyamal, L. |year=2007|title=Opinion: Taking Indian ornithology into the Information Age|journal=Indian Birds |volume=3|issue=4|pages=122–137|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228679235_Opinion_Taking_Indian_ornithology_into_the_Information_Age}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Hume corresponded with a large number of ornithologists and sportsmen who helped him by reporting from various parts of India. More than 200 correspondents are listed in his ''Game Birds'' alone and they probably represent only a fraction of the subscribers of ''Stray Feathers''. This large network made it possible for Hume to cover a much larger geographic region in his ornithological work.

During the lifetime of Hume, Blyth was considered the father of Indian ornithology. Hume's achievement which made use of a large network of correspondents was recognised even during his time:
{{quote|Mr. Blyth, who is rightly called the Father of Indian Ornithology, "was by far the most important contributor to our knowledge of the Birds of India." Seated, as the head of the Asiatic Society's Museum, he, by intercourse and through correspondents, not only formed a large collection for the Society, but also enriched the pages of the Society's Journal with the results of his study, and thus did more for the extension of the study of the Avifauna of India than all previous writers. There can be no work on Indian Ornithology without reference to his voluminous contributions. The most recent authority, however, is Mr. Allen O. Hume, C.B., who, like Blyth and Jerdon, got around him numerous workers, and did so much for Ornithology, that without his Journal ''Stray Feathers'', no accurate knowledge could be gained of the distribution of Indian birds. His large museum, so liberally made over to the nation, is ample evidence of his zeal and the purpose to which he worked. Ever saddled with his official work, he yet found time for carrying out a most noble object. His ''Nests and Eggs'', ''Scrap Book'' and numerous articles on birds of various parts of India, the Andamans and the Malay Peninsula, are standing monuments of his fame throughout the length and breadth of the civilised world. His writings and the field notes of his curator, contributors and collectors are the pith of every book on Indian Birds, and his vast collection is the ground upon which all Indian Naturalists must work. Though differing from him on some points, yet the palm is his as an authority above the rest in regard to the Ornis of India. Amongst the hundred and one contributors to the Science in the pages of ''Stray Feathers'', there are some who may be ranked as specialists in this department, and their labors need a record. These are Mr. [[William Thomas Blanford|W. T. Blanford]], late of the Geological Survey, an ever watchful and zealous Naturalist of some eminence. Mr. Theobald, also of the Geological Survey, Mr. Ball of the same Department, and Mr. W. E. Brooks. All these worked in Northern India, while for work in the Western portion must stand the names of Major Butler, of the 66th Regiment, Mr. W. F. Sinclair, Collector of Colaba, Mr. G. Vidal, the Collector of Bombay, Mr. J. Davidson, Collector of Khandeish, and Mr. Fairbank, each one having respectively worked the Avifauna of Sind, the Concan, the Deccan and Khandeish.|James Murray&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Murray, James A.|year=1888| title= The avifauna of British India and its dependencies.

Hume exchanged skins with other collectors. A collection made principally by Hume that belonged to the [[Thomas Baring, 1st Earl of Northbrook|Earl of Northbrook]] was gifted to Oxford University in 1877.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=University and City Intelligence|newspaper=Oxford Journal|date=10 February 1877|page=5|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000073/18770210/007/0005|via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of his correspondents, [[Louis Mandelli]] from Darjeeling, stands out by claiming that he was swindled in these skin exchanges. He claimed that Hume took skins of rarer species in exchange for the skins of common birds but the credibility of the complaint has been doubted. Hume named ''Arborophila mandelli'' after Mandelli in 1874.&lt;ref name=birdingasia2012 /&gt; The only other naturalist to question Hume's veracity was [[Arthur Lennox Butler|A.L. Butler]] who met a Nicobar islander whom Hume had described as diving nearly stark naked and capturing fish with his bare hands. Butler found the man in denial of such fishing techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Butler, AL|year=1899|title=The birds of the Andaman and Nicobar Islands.

===Collector's ''Vade Mecum'' (1874) ===
[[File:Hume Ornithologists Vade Mecum.jpg|thumb|''The Indian Ornithological Collector's Vade Mecum: containing brief practical instructions for collecting, preserving, packing and keeping specimens of birds, eggs, nests, feathers, and skeleton'' (1874)]]
Hume's vast collection from across India was possible because he began to correspond with coadjutors across India. He ensured that these contributors made  accurate notes, and obtained and processed specimens carefully. The ''Vade Mecum'' was published to save him the trouble of sending notes to potential collaborators who sought advice. Materials for preservation are carefully tailored for India with the provision of the local names for ingredients and methods to prepare glues and preservatives with easy to find equipment. Apart from skinning and preservation, the book also covers matters of observation, keeping records, the use of natives to capture birds, obtain eggs and the care needed in obtaining other information apart from care in labelling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hume, A.|year=1874|title=The Indian Ornithological Collector's Vade Mecum: containing brief practical instructions for collecting, preserving, packing and keeping specimens of birds, eggs, nests, feathers, and skeleton.|publisher= Calcutta Central Press, Calcutta and Bernard Quaritch, London|url=https://archive.org/details/OrnithologicalCollectorsVadeMecum1874}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Game Birds of India, Burmah and Ceylon'' (1879–1881)===
This work was co-authored by [[Charles Henry Tilson Marshall|C. H. T. Marshall]]. The three volume work on the game birds was made using contributions and notes from a network of 200 or more correspondents. Hume delegated the task of getting the plates made to Marshall. The chromolithographs of the birds were drawn by W. Foster, E. Neale, (Miss) M. Herbert, Stanley Wilson and others and the plates were produced by F. Waller in London. Hume had sent specific notes on colours of soft parts and instructions to the artists. He was unsatisfied with many of the plates and included additional notes on the plates in the book. This book was started at the point when the government demoted Hume and only the need to finance the publication of this book prevented him from retiring from service. He had estimated that it would cost ₤ 4000 to publish it and he retired from service on 1 January 1882 after the publication.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;&lt;ref name=jsas/&gt;

In the preface Hume wrote:
{{quotation|In the second place, we have had great disappointment in artists. Some have proved careless, some have subordinated accuracy of delineation to pictorial effect, and though we have, at some loss, rejected many, we have yet been compelled to retain some plates which are far from satisfactory to us.}}

while his co-author Marshall, wrote:
{{quotation|I have performed my portion of the work to the very best of my abilities, and yet personally felt almost as if I were sailing under false colors in appearing before the world as one of the authors of this book; but I allow my name to appear as such, partly because Mr. Hume strongly wishes it, partly because I do believe that as Mr. Hume says this work, which has been for years called for, would never have appeared had I not proceeded to England, and arranged for the preparation of the plates, and partly because with the explanation thus afforded no one can justly misconstrue my action.}}

[[File:Pterocles senegallus hm.jpg|thumb|Hume's comment on the illustration ''The plate is a cruel caricature of the species, just sufficiently like to permit of identification, but miscolored to a degree only explicable on the hypothesis of somebody's colour-blindness… Fortunately for our supporters, this is the very worst plate in the three volumes.'']]

===''Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds'' (1883)===
This was another major work by Hume and in it he covered descriptions of the nests, eggs and the  breeding seasons of most Indian bird species. It makes use of notes from contributors to his journals as well as other correspondents and works of the time. Hume also makes insightful notes such as observations on caged females separated from males that would continue to lay fertile eggs through the possibility of [[Female sperm storage|sperm storage]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Hume, A.O.|url=https://archive.org/stream/nestseggsofindia01humerich#page/198/mode/2up|year=1889|title=The Nests and Eggs of Indian Birds.

A second edition of this book was made in 1889 which was edited by [[Eugene William Oates]]. This was published when he had himself given up all interest in ornithology. An event precipitated by the loss of his manuscripts through the actions of a servant. He wrote in the preface:
{{quote|I have long regretted my inability to issue a revised edition of 'Nests and Eggs'. For many years after the first Rough Draft appeared, I went on laboriously accumulating materials for a re-issue, but subsequently circumstances prevented my undertaking the work. Now, fortunately, my friend Mr. Eugene Oates has taken the matter up, and much as I may personally regret having to hand over to another a task, the performance of which I should so much have enjoyed, it is some consolation to feel that the readers, at any rate, of this work will have no cause for regret, but rather of rejoicing that the work has passed into younger and stronger hands.

One thing seems necessary to explain. The present Edition does not include quite all the materials I had accumulated for this work. Many years ago, during my absence from Simla, a servant broke into my museum and stole thence several [[Hundredweight|cwts.]] of manuscript, which he sold as waste paper. This manuscript included more or less complete life-histories of some 700 species of birds, and also a certain number of detailed accounts of nidification. All small notes on slips of paper were left, but almost every article written on full-sized foolscap sheets was abstracted. It was not for many months that the theft was discovered, and then very little of the MSS. could be recovered.|Rothney Castle, Simla, October 19th, 1889}}

Eugene Oates wrote his own editorial note:
{{quote|Mr. Hume has sufficiently explained the circumstances under which this edition of his popular work has been brought about. I have merely to add that, as I was engaged on a work on the Birds of India, I thought it would be easier for me than for anyone else to assist Mr. Hume. I was also in England, and knew that my labour would be very much lightened by passing the work through the press in this country. Another reason, perhaps the most important, was the fear that, as Mr. Hume had given up entirely and absolutely the study of birds, the valuable material he had taken such pains to accumulate for this edition might be irretrievably lost or further injured by lapse of time unless early steps were taken to utilize it.}}

This nearly marked the end of Hume's interest in ornithology. Hume's last piece of ornithological writing was part of an [https://archive.org/details/scientificresult00blan ''Introduction to the Scientific Results of the Second Yarkand Mission''] in 1891, an official publication on the contributions of Dr. Ferdinand Stoliczka, who died during the return journey on this mission. Stoliczka in a dying request had asked that Hume edit the volume on ornithology.&lt;ref name=moulton /&gt;

==Theosophy==
[[File:Vegetarian Society.jpg|thumb|left|upright|A vice-president of the Vegetarian Society]]
Hume's interest in theosophy took root around 1879. An 1880 newspaper reports the initiation of his daughter and wife into the movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Morning Post|date=8 April 1880|page=3|title= India [From the Bombay Gazette of March 20]| url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000174/18800408/013/0003| via=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume did not have great regard for institutional Christianity, but believed in the immortality of the soul and in the idea of a supreme ultimate.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Hume wanted to become a ''chela'' (student) of the Tibetan spiritual gurus. During the few years of his connection with the [[Theosophical Society]] Hume wrote  three articles on ''Fragments of Occult Truth'' under the pseudonym "H. X." published in ''The Theosophist''. These were written in response to questions from Mr. Terry, an Australian Theosophist.

He also privately printed several Theosophical pamphlets titled ''Hints on Esoteric Theosophy''. The later numbers of the Fragments, in answer to the same enquirer, were written by [[A.P. Sinnett]] and signed by him, as authorized by Mahatma K. H., ''A Lay-Chela.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Mahatma Letters|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin|location=London, UK|year=1923|url=https://archive.org/details/mahatmalettersto00sinnuoft|editor=Barker, A.T.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also wrote under the pseudonym of "Aletheia".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=140 |title=Religious Conversion Movements in South Asia: Continuities and Change, 1800-1990| author=Oddie, Geoffrey| publisher=Routledge| year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Madame Blavatsky was a regular visitor at Hume's Rothney castle at [[Shimla|Simla]] and an account of her visit may be found in ''Simla, Past and Present'' by Edward John Buck (who succeeded Mr. Hume in charge of the Agricultural Department).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/simlapastpresent00buckrich#page/116/mode/1up/| author=Buck, E. J.|title=Simla, past and present|pages=116–118|year=1904|publisher=Thacker and Spink|location=Calcutta, India}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A long story about Hume and his wife appears in A.P. Sinnett's book ''[[The Occult World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/theoccultworld00sinn#page/n73/mode/2up|pages=54–61|title=The occult world|author=Sinnett, A.P.|year=1883|publisher=Trubner &amp; co.|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the synopsis was published in a local paper of India.  The story relates how at a dinner party, Madame Blavatsky asked Mrs Hume if there was anything she wanted.  She replied that there was a brooch, her mother had given her, that had gone out of her possession some time ago. Blavatsky said she would try to recover it through occult means. After some interlude, later that evening, the brooch was found in a garden, where the party was directed by Blavatsky. According to John Murdoch (1894), the brooch had been given by Mrs. Hume to her daughter who had given it to a man she admired. Blavatsky had happened to meet the man in Bombay and obtained the brooch in return for money. Blavatsky allegedly planted it in the garden before directing people to the location through what she claimed as occult techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/theosophiccraze00murdgoog#page/n26/mode/2up|page=17|title=The theosophic craze: its history; the great Mahatma hoax; how Mrs. Besant was befooled and deposed; its attempted revival of exploded superstitions of the middle ages|edition=1st|year=1894|publisher=The Christian Literature Society|location=Madras, India|author=Murdoch, John}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the incident, Hume too had privately expressed grave doubts on the powers attributed to Madame Blavatsky. He subsequently held a meeting with some of the Indian members of the Theosophical Society and suggested that they join hands with him to force the resignation of Blavatsky and sixteen other members for their role as accomplices in fraud. Those present could however not agree to the idea of seeking the resignation of their founder.&lt;ref name=mahatma&gt;{{cite book|url=https://archive.org/stream/mahatmalettersto00sinnuoft#page/468/mode/2up|author=Blavatsky, H.P.|chapter=Letter No CXXXVIII|title=The Mahatma Letters|publisher=T. Fisher Unwin|place=London|year=1923|editor=Barker, A. T.|pages=304, 469}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume also tried to write a book on the philosophical basis of Theosophy. His drafts were strongly disapproved by many of the key Theosophists. One ("K.H"=[[Koot Hoomi|Koot Humi]]) wrote:
{{quote|I dread the appearance in print of our philosophy as expounded by Mr. H. I read his three essays or chapters on God (?)cosmogony and glimpses of the origin of tings in general, and had to cross out nearly all. He makes of us ''Agnostics''!! ''We'' do not believe in God because so far, ''we have no proof'', etc. This is preposterously ridiculous: if he publishes what I read, I will have H.P.B. or Djual Khool deny the whole thing; as I cannot permit our sacred philosophy to be so disfigured....|"K.H." (p.304)&lt;ref name=mahatma /&gt;}} 
Hume soon fell out of favour with the Theosophists and lost all interest in the theosophical movement in 1883.&lt;ref name=jsas&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moulton, Edward C.|year=1985| title=Allan O.

Hume's interest in spirituality brought him into contact with many independent Indian thinkers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bevir, Mark |year=2003| title= Theosophy and the Origins of the Indian National Congress|journal= [[International Journal of Hindu Studies]] |volume=7|issue=1–3|pages=99–115|doi=10.1007/s11407-003-0005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also had nationalist ideas and this led to the idea of creating  the Indian National Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hanes, W.

==Indian National Congress==
{{Main|Indian National Congress}}
[[File:1st INC1885.jpg|thumb|Hume at the first session, Bombay, 28–31 December 1885]]
After retiring from the civil services and towards the end of [[Robert Bulwer-Lytton, 1st Earl of Lytton|Lord Lytton]]'s rule, Hume observed that the people of India had a sense of hopelessness and wanted to do something, noting "a sudden violent outbreak of sporadic crime, murders of obnoxious persons, robbery of bankers and looting of bazaars, acts really of lawlessness which by a due coalescence of forces might any day develop into a National Revolt." Concerning the British government, he stated that ''a studied and invariable disregard, if not actually contempt for the opinions and feelings of our subjects, is at the present day the leading characteristic of our government in every branch of the administration.''&lt;ref&gt;Hume to Northbrook, 1 August 1872, Northbrook Papers, cited in Mehrotra 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

There were agrarian riots in the [[Deccan Plateau|Deccan]] and [[Mumbai|Bombay]], and Hume suggested that an Indian Union would be a good safety valve and outlet to avoid further unrest. On 1 March 1883 he wrote a letter to the graduates of the [[University of Calcutta]]:&lt;ref name=inc/&gt;
{{quotation|If only fifty men, good and true, can be found to join as founders, the thing can be established and the further development will be comparatively easy. ...&lt;br/&gt;
And if even the leaders of thought are all either such poor creatures, or so selfishly wedded to personal concerns that they dare not strike a blow for their country's sake, then justly and rightly are they kept down and trampled on, for they deserve nothing better. Every nation secures precisely as good a Government as it merits. If you the picked men, the most highly educated of the nation, cannot, scorning personal ease and selfish objects, make a resolute struggle to secure greater freedom for yourselves and your country, a more impartial administration, a larger share in the management of your own affairs, then we, your friends, are wrong and our adversaries right, then are Lord Ripon's noble aspirations for your good fruitless and visionary, then, at present at any rate all hopes of progress are at an end and India truly neither desires nor deserves any better Government than she enjoys. Only, if this be so, let us hear no more factious, peevish complaints that you are kept in leading strings and treated like children, for you will have proved yourself such. ''Men'' know how to act. Let there be no more complaining of Englishmen being preferred to you in all important offices, for if you lack that public spirit, that highest form of altruistic devotion that leads men to subordinate private ease to the [[Common good|public weal]] – that patriotism that has made Englishmen what they are – then rightly are these preferred to you, rightly and inevitably have they become your rulers. And rulers and task-masters they must continue, let the yoke gall your shoulders never so sorely, until you realise and stand prepared to act upon the eternal truth that self-sacrifice and unselfishness are the only unfailing guides to freedom and happiness.}}
[[File:HumeWedderburnNaoroji.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Hume (left) with [[William Wedderburn|Wedderburn]] (right) and [[Dadabhai Naoroji]]]]
His poem ''The [[Old Man's Hope]]'' published in Calcutta in 1886 also captures the sentiment:&lt;ref&gt;Cited in Mehrotra 2005:75&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Sons of Ind, why sit ye idle,
Wait ye for some Deva's aid?
Buckle to, be up and doing!
Nations by themselves are made!

Are ye Serfs or are ye Freemen,
Ye that grovel in the shade?
In your own hands rest the issues!
By themselves are nations made! ...
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The idea of the Indian Union took shape and Hume initially had some support from [[Frederick Hamilton-Temple-Blackwood, 1st Marquess of Dufferin and Ava|Lord Dufferin]] for this, although the latter wished to have no official link to it. Dufferin's support was short-lived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Martin, Briton Jr.|year=1967| title= Lord Dufferin and the Indian National Congress, 1885–1888|journal=The Journal of British Studies|volume=7|issue=1|pages=68–96|doi=10.1086/385545}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that the idea was originally conceived in a private meeting of seventeen men after a Theosophical Convention held at [[Madras]] in December 1884. Hume took the initiative, and it was in March 1885, when the first notice was issued convening the first Indian National Union to meet at Poona the following December.&lt;ref name=inc/&gt;

He attempted to increase the Congress base by bringing in more farmers, townspeople and Muslims between 1886 and 1887 and this created a backlash from the British, leading to backtracking by the Congress. Hume was disappointed when Congress opposed moves to raise the age of marriage for Indian girls and failed to focus on issues of poverty. Some Indian princes did not like the idea of democracy and some organizations like the United Indian Patriotic Association went about trying to undermine the Congress by showing it as an organization with a seditious character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Beck, Theodore|year= 1888| title= Pamphlets issued by the United Indian Patriotic Association.

Disappointed by the continued lack of Indian leaders willing to work for the cause of national emancipation, Hume left for Britain in 1894.&lt;ref name=DNB /&gt;

Many [[Anglo-Indians]] were against the idea of the Indian National Congress. The press in India tended to look upon it negatively, so much so that Hume is said to have held a very low opinion of journalists even later in life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Yorkshire Post and Leeds Intelligencer |date=1 August 1912 |title=Obituary.

The organizers of the 27th session of the Indian National Congress at Bankipur (26–28 December 1912) recorded their "profound sorrow at the death of Allan Octavian Hume, C.B., father and founder of the Congress, to whose lifelong services, rendered at rare self-sacrifice, India feels deep and lasting gratitude, and in whose death the cause of Indian progress and reform sustained irreparable loss."&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913):176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=How India wrought for freedom.

==South London Botanical Institute==
{{Main|South London Botanical Institute}}
[[File:Hume bookplate.jpg|thumb|Bookplate of Hume with the motto ''Industria et Perseverantia'']]
After the loss of his manuscript containing his lifetime of ornithological notes. Hume took up a great interest in horticulture while at Shimla. &lt;blockquote&gt;... He erected large conservatories in the grounds of Rothney Castle, filled them with the choicest flowers, and engaged English gardeners to help him in the work. From this, on returning to England, he went on to scientific botany. But this, as Kipling says, is another story, and must be left to another pen.&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913):43, quoting CHT Marshall&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[File:SLBI Herbaria1.jpg|thumb|upright|left|Herbarium cabinets at the SLBI]]
Hume took an interest in wild plants and especially on invasive species although his botanical publishing was sparse with only a few short notes in 1901 on a variety of ''[[Bolboschoenus maritimus|Scirpus maritimus]]'' and another on the flowering of ''Impatiens roylei''. Hume contacted W.H. Griffin in 1901 to help develop a herbarium of botanical specimens. Hume would arrange his plants on herbarium sheets in artistic positions before pressing them. The two made many botanical trips including one to Down in Kent to seek some of the rare orchids that had been collected by Darwin.&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913):113-115&lt;/ref&gt; In 1910, Hume bought the premises of 323 Norwood Road, and modified it to have a herbarium and library. He called this establishment the [[South London Botanical Institute]] with the aim of "promoting, encouraging, and facilitating, amongst the residents of South London, the study of the science of botany."

One of the aims of the institute was to help promote botany as a means for mental culture and relaxation, an idea that was not shared by [[Henry Groves]], a trustee for the Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Journal of Botany, British and Foreign|url=https://archive.org/stream/journalofbotanyb51londuoft#page/n89/mode/2up|title=Henry Groves (1855–1912)|author=[J.G.]|pages=73–79|volume=51|year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hume objected to advertisement and refused to have any public ceremony to open the institute. The first curator was W.H. Griffin and Hume endowed the Institute with £10,000. Frederick Townsend, F.L.S., an eminent botanist, who died in 1905, had left instructions that his herbarium and collection was to be given to the institute, which was then only being contemplated.&lt;ref&gt;Wedderburn (1913):118–121&lt;/ref&gt; Hume left £15,000 in his will for the maintenance of the botanical institute.&lt;ref name=jbot&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://archive.org/stream/proceedingsoflin191215linn#page/n71/mode/1up/|pages=60–61|title=Obituary notices|author=BDJ| journal=Proceedings of the Linnean Society of London|year=1913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pages=347–348|title=Allan Octavian Hume, C.B.

[[File:SLBI Herbaria2.jpg|thumb|upright|Herbarium sheets showing Hume's artistic arrangements]]
In the years leading up to the establishment of the Institute, Hume built up links with many of the leading botanists of his day. He worked with [[Frederick Hamilton Davey|F. H. Davey]] and in the ''Flora of Cornwall'' (1909), Davey thanks Hume as his companion on excursions in Cornwall and Devon, and for help in the compilation of the 'Flora', publication of which was financed by Hume.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |year=1922|author1=Thurston, E |author2=Vigurs, C.

The collection was later augmented by the addition of other herbaria over the years, and has significant collections of ''[[Rubus]]'' (bramble) species and of the Shetland flora.

'''Australians Against Further Immigration''' (AAFI) was an Australian political party which described itself as "eco-nationalist" and was against positive net [[immigration]]. The party was founded in 1989 and registered in 1990. It ceased to exist in 2008. 

AAFI regularly stood candidates at both state and federal level, but never won a seat. The party said it was a mainstream organisation, and to distance itself from extremist organisations such as the [[Australian League of Rights]] and from the [[Citizens Electoral Council]].&lt;ref&gt;Lyle Allan (1994), 'Immigration and the Werriwa By-Election,' in ''People and Place'', Vol.2, No.1, p.55&lt;/ref&gt;  The far-left ''[[Green Left Weekly ]]'' called it racist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Multicultural Australia|url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/7229|accessdate=2014-08-10|work=Green Left Weekly|date=1994-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, [[Franca Arena]], a member of the [[New South Wales Legislative Council]],  denounced them in the [[New South Wales]] parliament.

The party was deregistered by the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] in December 2005, as lacking the minimum required members in order to be registered as a political party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aec.gov.au/About_AEC/Media_releases/2006/deregistration_aafi.htm|title=Media Release 2006: Deregistration of Australians Against Further Immigration|publisher=Australian Electoral Commission|accessdate=26 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It contested the [[New South Wales state election, 2007|2007 New South Wales state election]], but was deregistered at the state level not long after.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fightdemback.org/2006/01/11/deregistered-homes/ fightdemback.org] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090409083224/http://www.fightdemback.org/2006/01/11/deregistered-homes/ |date=April 9, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Monaco}}
The '''Communal Council''' is the body responsible for the civil administration of the four ''quartiers'' of the [[Principality]] of [[Monaco]]. Because Monaco is both a nation and a city, the council chooses the mayor of Monaco and his/her officers. It consists of fifteen members, elected by direct universal suffrage to four-year terms, and a [[Mayor of Monaco|mayor]], selected by the members.&lt;ref name=conseilcommunal&gt;{{cite web|title=La Mairie: Le Conseil Communal|url=http://www.mairie.mc/mairie-monaco/le-conseil-communal/|website=Ville de Monaco|accessdate=December 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It meets every three months.&lt;ref name=conseilcommunal/&gt; The main responsibilities of the City Council and the Mayor concern the social and cultural spheres. These responsibilities include support for daycares, home care for seniors, and the Academy of music, as well as organization of elections, granting of marriage licenses, and encouraging engagement in the life of the city.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7246">The '''Deutsche Hochschule für Politik''' (DHfP), or ''German Academy for Politics'', was a private academy in [[Berlin]], founded in October 1920. It was integrated into the Faculty for Foreign Studies (''Auslandswissenschaftliche Fakultät'') of the [[Humboldt University of Berlin|Friedrich-Wilhelms-Universität]] in 1940, was re-founded in 1948 and turned into the [[Otto-Suhr-Institut]] of the [[Freie Universität Berlin]] in 1959.

==Purpose==

The DHfP was to establish the elementary principles of a democratic community in Germany in a liberal spirit and thus help to strengthen the young [[Weimar Republic]] against anti-democratic tendencies. Political science was at this time still understood as the study of democracy. The predecessor institution of the Deutsche Hochschule für Politik was the "Staatsbürgerschule" (Citizens' Academy) in Berlin, founded in 1918.

Sponsors or members of the founding board of trustees were amongst others [[Walter Simons]], [[Ernst Jaeckh]], [[Friedrich Naumann]], [[Friedrich Meinecke]], [[Max Weber]], [[Hugo Preuß]], [[Gertrud Bäumer]] and [[Otto Heinrich von der Gablentz]]. The Prussian education reformer (and scholar of Islamic studies) [[Carl Heinrich Becker]] played an important role in the successful founding of the new academy.

==Weimar Republic==

Lectures and seminars for the first 120 students at first took place only in the evening, mostly with volunteer lecturers. The core areas of teaching were at first: 
# General Politics, Political History and Political Sociology 
# Foreign Policy and Foreign Studies 
# Domestic Politics, including cultural policy and the media
# Legal Foundations of Politics 
# Economic Foundations of Politics

With rising numbers of students, in the following years the proportion of paid teaching staff rose, as did the number of professorships. A degree could not be awarded by the Hochschule für Politik until the mid-1920s, due to the difficulties in making the education sufficiently academic.

The teaching staff included, amongst others, the women's rights activist [[Gertrud Bäumer]], [[Carl Heinrich Becker]], [[Rudolf Breitscheid]], the constitutional lawyer [[Hermann Heller (legal scholar)|Hermann Heller]], the later [[President of Germany|Bundespräsident]] [[Theodor Heuss]], [[Rudolf Hilferding]], [[Wilhelm Heile]], [[Hermann Luther]], the politician and sociology professor [[Ernst Niekisch]], the German-Jewish sociologist [[Albert Salomon]], the historian [[Hans Delbrück]], [[Hajo Holborn]], [[Eckart Kehr]], [[Veit Valentin]], [[Ernst Jaeckh]], the jurists [[Hermann Pünder]], and [[Arnold Brecht]], the economist [[Hans Staudinger]] and the government ministers [[Walther Rathenau]], [[Bill Drews]] and [[Walter Simons]]. The latter's son [[Hans Simons]] was the head of the academy and also had teaching duties.

==Third Reich==

Many of the teaching staff of the academy emigrated in 1933, in order to escape the Nazi repression of political opponents and those of Jewish descent. The political writer Peter Kleist then became the director.

Under the Nazi regime, the academy at first became directly subordinated to the government in 1937. The lecturers closest to National Socialism were the "nationalist-revisionist" and the "völkisch-conservative" ones, who came from the ''Politische Kolleg''. The latter had formed a working group with the academy in 1927. From this point on the teaching staff were divided, and no unified concept was agreed upon. Political science was then restricted to foreign policy and "foreign studies", and thus became part of the Nazi ideological apparatus and foreign policy.

In 1940 the Deutsche Hochschule für Politik was merged with the Institute for Oriental Languages, which had become the foreign studies school of the [[Universität Berlin]] in 1935. They were now integrated into the university as the Faculty of Foreign Studies ("Auslandswissenschaftliche Fakultät"). The dean was [[Franz Six|Franz Alfred Six]], 30 years old. Six was an SS intellectual, who belonged to the elite of the NSDAP; he worked simultaneously on the extermination of the Jews as [[Adolf Eichmann]]'s superior in the [[Reichssicherheitshauptamt]]. Another leading National Socialist at the Hochschule für Politik was the sociologist and geopolitics scholar Karl Heinz Pfeffer, who succeeded Six as dean. Anti-colonialist students (mostly Indian and Arab) also studied there until 1945.

Some teachers in the Faculty of Foreign Studies were [[Albrecht Haushofer]], [[Harro Schulze-Boysen]] and [[Mildred Harnack]]. Some of the students were: [[Eva-Maria Buch]], [[Ursula Goetze]], [[Horst Heilmann]] und [[Rainer Hildebrandt]].

The number of Nazi Party members as a proportion of this Faculty was 65%, twice as much as other Berlin higher education institutions ([[Humboldt University of Berlin]]: 38%, Philosophy Faculty: 31%). It cooperated extensively with the government-run ''Deutsches Auslandswissenschaftliches Institut'' (DAWI; German Institute for Foreign Studies) of the Reich Ministry of Public Enlightenment. This institute was also run by Six, who also had a third function as head of the "Kulturpolitische Abteilung" of the German Foreign Office.

==Post-war period==

In 1948 the Deutsche Hochschule für Politik was re-founded by the Social Democrat [[Otto Suhr]]. It was integrated into the [[Freie Universität Berlin]] and moved to Berlin-Dahlem, as the newly founded [[Otto-Suhr-Institut]] in 1959. Its previous representative building in Schöneberg was used by the Fachhochschule für Wirtschaft Berlin from 1971.

== Legacy ==

An exhibition, by Siegfried Mielke and his colleagues, about the staff and students of the Deutsche Hochschule für Politik who were active in resistance groups during the time of the Nazi dictatorship, was opened on 14 June 2008 in the foyer of the Otto-Suhr-Institut by [[Wolfgang Thierse]], the [[President of the Bundestag|Vice President of the Bundestag]]. Since then, the exhibition has also been shown at other venues. The exhibition and accompanying materials give an overview of the development of the Hochschule. It is centred on several dozen biographies of students and members of staff, who fought against National Socialism in different groups either in the resistance or in exile. The biographies show a connection between the democratic orientation of the Hochschule and the political work of many of its teachers and students against the Nazi state. Although already at the start of 1933 staff and students at the German universities were starting to support the Nazis in droves, at the DHfP the majority of faculty and students stayed true to the democratic ideals it was founded on. According to the authors of these biographies, this was "unique" in the academic landscape. Just as unequalled was the large number of staff and students who joined resistance groups or fought the Nazi system in exile.

'''E2D International''' (E2D) is the [[political international]] of the [[Electronic Direct Democracy]] (E2D) Party movement. The [[E2D Manifesto]] describes the basic political principles of E2D International member parties.

==Project==

To help create and promote parties with only one element in their program: [[Direct Democracy]] ("a form of democracy in which sovereignty is lodged in the assembly of all citizens who choose to participate").

E2D parties are to be politically [[non-partisan]] and their agenda entirely based on people’s decision, determined by means of referendums and initiatives organized by party members and citizens. These organized systems will thus allow citizens to vote on propositions of laws submitted by elected members of parliament, but also to propose new laws.

==Mission==

The mission for Electronic Direct Democracy (E2D) International is:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
''to help establish, to support and promote, and to maintain communication and co-operation between {{Sic|hide=y|politically|-}}neutral electronic direct democracy parties around the world.''&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The E2D Manifesto==

The [[E2D Manifesto]], collaboratively drafted in February 2011 by representatives from [[Citizens for Direct Democracy]], [[Online Party of Canada]], [[Partido de Internet]], [[Aktiv Demokrati]], [[Demoex]], [[Senator Online]] and [[Partidul Romania Online]] using Participedia.net, is a document which describes the basic political principles of E2D International. The E2D Manifesto was inspired by the ideas of [[Aki Orr]], amongst others.


== Parties ==

E2D are active in several countries.

The '''economy of Ecuador''' is based mostly on exports of [[petroleum|oil]], [[bananas]], shrimp, gold, other primary agricultural products and money transfers from nearly a million Ecuadorian emigrants employed abroad. In 2002, oil accounted for about one-third of public-sector revenue and 40% of export earnings. Ecuador is the world's largest exporter of bananas ($936.5 million in 2002) and a major exporter of shrimp ($251 million in 2002). Exports of non-traditional products such as [[flower industry|flowers]] ($291 million in 2002) and canned fish ($333 million in 2002) have grown in recent years. Industry is largely oriented to servicing the domestic market.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

==Economy 1998–2006==
Deteriorating economic performance in 1997–98 culminated in a [[1998–99 Ecuador banking crisis|severe financial crisis in 1999]]. The crisis was precipitated by a number of external shocks, including the [[El Niño]] weather phenomenon in 1997, a sharp drop in global [[oil price]]s in 1997–98, and international emerging market instability in 1997–98. These factors highlighted the Government of Ecuador's unsustainable economic policy mix of large fiscal deficits and expansionary money policy and resulted in a 7.3% contraction of GDP, annual year-on-year inflation of 52.2%, and a 65% [[devaluation]] of the national currency in 1999.

On January 9, 2000, the administration of President [[Jamil Mahuad]] announced its intention to [[dollarization|adopt the U.S. dollar as the official currency]] of Ecuador to address the ongoing economic crisis. Subsequent protest led to the [[2000 Ecuadorean coup d'état]] which saw Mahuad's removal from office and the elevation of Vice President [[Gustavo Noboa]] to the presidency.

The Noboa government confirmed its commitment to convert to the dollar as the centerpiece of its economic recovery strategy, successfully completing the transition from [[Ecuadorian sucre|sucre]]s to dollars in 2001. Following the completion of a one-year stand-by program with the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) in December 2001, Ecuador successfully negotiated a new $205 million stand-by agreement with the IMF in March 2003.

Buoyed by higher oil prices, the Ecuadorian economy experienced a modest recovery in 2000–01, with GDP rising 2.3% in 2000 and 5.4% in 2001. GDP growth leveled off to 3.3% in 2002. Although final figures are not yet available, it is expected to fall further, to about 1.7%, for 2003. GDP growth is estimated to recover to over 4% in 2004, due largely to expanded oil exports. Inflation fell from an annual rate of 96.1% in 2000 to an annual rate of 37.7% in 2001; 12.6% for 2002. Despite recent gains, 40% of the population lives below the poverty line, more than double the rate five years ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indexmundi.com/ecuador/inflation_rate_(consumer_prices).html|title=Ecuador Inflation rate (consumer prices)|publisher=Index Mundi|date=30 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The completion of the second [[Transandean Oil Pipeline]] (OCP in Spanish) in 2003 enabled Ecuador to expand oil exports. The OCP will double Ecuador's oil transport capacity.

'''English''' is a [[West Germanic language]] that was first spoken in [[Anglo-Saxon England|early medieval England]] and eventually became a global ''[[lingua franca]]''.{{sfn|Crystal|2003a|p=6}}{{sfn|Wardhaugh|2010|p=55}} Named after the [[Angles]], one of the [[Germanic tribes]] that migrated to the area of Britain that would later take their name, [[England]], both names ultimately deriving from the [[Anglia (peninsula)|Anglia]] peninsula in the [[Baltic Sea]]. It is closely related to the [[Frisian languages]], but its vocabulary has been significantly influenced by other [[Germanic languages]], particularly [[Old Norse|Norse]] (a [[North Germanic languages|North Germanic language]]), as well as by [[Latin language|Latin]] and [[French language|French]].&lt;ref name="Wolff"&gt;{{cite book |last=Finkenstaedt |first=Thomas |author2=Dieter Wolff |title=Ordered profusion; studies in dictionaries and the English lexicon |publisher=C. Winter |year=1973 |isbn=3-533-02253-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English has developed over the course of more than 1,400 years. The earliest forms of English, a set of [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian dialects]] brought to [[Great Britain]] by [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon settlers]] in the 5th century, are called [[Old English]]. [[Middle English]] began in the late 11th century with the [[Norman conquest of England]] and was a period in which the language was influenced by French.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=30}} [[Early Modern English]] began in the late 15th century with the introduction of the [[printing press]] to London, the printing of the [[King James Bible]] and the start of the [[Great Vowel Shift]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''How English evolved into a global language''|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-12017753|date=20 December 2010|publisher=BBC|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through the worldwide influence of the [[British Empire]], [[Modern English]] spread around the world from the 17th to mid-20th centuries. Through all types of printed and electronic media, and spurred by the emergence of the United States as a global [[superpower]], English has become the [[World language|leading language]] of international discourse and [[English as a lingua franca|the ''lingua franca'']] in many regions and professional contexts such as science, navigation and law.{{sfn|The Routes of English}}

English is the [[List of languages by number of native speakers|third most-spoken native language]] in the world, after [[Standard Chinese]] and Spanish.{{sfn|Ethnologue|2010}} It is the most widely learned second language and is either the [[official language]] or one of the official languages in [[list of territorial entities where English is an official language|almost 60 sovereign states]]. There are more people who have learned it as a second language than there are native speakers. English is the most commonly spoken language in the United Kingdom, the United States, Canada, Australia, Ireland and New Zealand, and it is widely spoken in some areas of the [[Caribbean]], Africa and [[South Asia]].{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=108–109}} It is a [[Official languages of the United Nations|co-official language of the United Nations]], [[Languages of the European Union|the European Union]] and many other world and regional international organisations. It is the most widely spoken Germanic language, accounting for at least 70% of speakers of this Indo-European branch. English has a vast vocabulary, though counting how many words any language has is impossible.{{sfn|HowManyWords|2015}}{{sfn|Algeo|1999}} English speakers are called "Anglophones".

Modern English grammar is the result of a gradual change from a typical Indo-European dependent marking pattern with a rich [[inflection]]al [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphology]] and relatively free word order to a mostly [[Analytic language|analytic]] pattern with little [[inflection]], a fairly fixed [[SVO word order]] and a complex [[syntax]].{{sfn|König|1994|page=539}} [[Modern English]] relies more on [[auxiliary verb]]s and [[word order]] for the expression of complex [[grammatical tense|tenses]], [[grammatical aspect|aspect]] and [[grammatical mood|mood]], as well as [[passive voice|passive constructions]], [[interrogative]]s and some [[negation]]. Despite noticeable variation among the accents and [[English dialects|dialects of English]] used in different countries and regions—in terms of [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]], and sometimes also vocabulary, grammar and spelling—English-speakers from around the world are able to communicate with one another with relative ease.

English is an [[Indo-European language]] and belongs to the [[West Germanic languages|West Germanic]] group of the [[Germanic languages]].{{sfn|Bammesberger|1992|pp=29–30}} [[Old English]] [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|originated]] from a Germanic tribal and [[Dialect continuum|linguistic continuum]] along the coast of the [[North Sea]], whose languages are now known as the [[Anglo-Frisian languages|Anglo-Frisian]] subgroup within West Germanic. As such, the modern [[Frisian languages]] are the closest living relatives of Modern English.&lt;!-- Sentence on Low German has been moved up. Was the Anglo-Frisian sentence referenced from Bammesberger? --&gt; [[Low German|Low German/Low Saxon]] is also closely related, and sometimes English, the Frisian languages, and Low German are grouped together as the [[Ingvaeonic languages|Ingvaeonic (North Sea Germanic) languages]], though this grouping remains debated.{{sfn|Bammesberger|1992|p=30}} Old English evolved into [[Middle English]], which in turn evolved into Modern English.{{sfn|Robinson|1992}} Particular dialects of Old and Middle English also developed into a number of other [[Anglic languages]], including [[Scots language|Scots]]{{sfn|Romaine|1982|pp=56–65}} and the extinct [[Fingallian]] and [[Forth and Bargy dialect|Forth and Bargy (Yola)]] dialects of Ireland.{{sfn|Barry|1982|pp=86–87}}

Like [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] and [[Faroese language|Faroese]], the development of English on the [[British Isles]] isolated it from the continental Germanic languages and influences, and has since undergone substantial evolution. English is thus not [[Mutual intelligibility|mutually intelligible]] with any continental Germanic language, differing in [[lexis (linguistics)|vocabulary]], [[syntax]], and [[phonology]], although some, such as Dutch or Frisian, do show strong affinities with English, especially with its earlier stages.{{sfn|Harbert|2007}}

Unlike Icelandic or Faroese, the long history of invasions of the British Isles by other peoples and languages, particularly [[Old Norse]] and [[Norman language|Norman French]], left a profound mark of their own on the language, such that English shares substantial vocabulary and grammar similarities with many languages outside its linguistic [[clades]], while also being unintelligible with any of those languages. Some scholars have even argued that English can be considered a [[mixed language]] or a [[Creole language|creole]]—a theory called the [[Middle English creole hypothesis]]. Although the high degree of influence from these languages on the vocabulary and grammar of Modern English is widely acknowledged, most specialists in language contact do not consider English to be a true mixed language.{{sfn|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=264–265}}{{sfn|Watts|2011|loc=Chapter 4}}

English is classified as a Germanic language because it shares [[language change|innovations]] with other Germanic languages such as [[Dutch language|Dutch]], [[German language|German]], and [[Swedish language|Swedish]].{{sfn|Durrell|2006}} These shared innovations show that the languages have descended from a single common ancestor called [[Proto-Germanic]]. Some shared features of Germanic languages include the use of [[modal verb]]s, the division of verbs into [[Germanic strong verb|strong]] and [[Germanic weak verb|weak]] classes, and the sound changes affecting [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] consonants, known as [[Grimm's law|Grimm's]] and [[Verner's law]]s. English is classified as an Anglo-Frisian language because Frisian and English share other features, such as the [[palatalization (sound change)|palatalisation]] of consonants that were velar consonants in Proto-Germanic (see {{section link|Phonological history of Old English|Palatalization}}).{{sfn|König|van der Auwera|1994}}

We of the Spear-Danes from days of yore have heard of the glory of the folk-kings..."]]

The earliest form of English is called Old English or Anglo-Saxon (c. 550–1066 CE). Old English developed from a set of [[Ingvaeonic languages|North Sea Germanic dialects]] originally spoken along the coasts of [[Frisia]], [[Lower Saxony]], [[Jutland]], and Southern [[Sweden]] by Germanic tribes known as the [[Angles]], [[Saxons]], and [[Jutes]]. In the fifth century, the Anglo-Saxons [[Anglo-Saxon settlement of Britain|settled Britain]] as [[End of Roman rule in Britain|the Roman economy and administration collapsed]]. By the seventh century, the Germanic language of the Anglo-Saxons [[Celtic language-death in England|became dominant in Britain]], replacing the languages of [[Roman Britain]] (43–409 CE): [[Common Brittonic]], a [[Celtic languages|Celtic language]], and [[Latin]], brought to Britain by the [[Caesar's invasions of Britain|Roman occupation]].{{sfn|Collingwood|Myres|1936}}{{sfn|Graddol|Leith|Swann et al.|2007}}{{sfn|Blench|Spriggs|1999}} ''England'' and ''English'' (originally {{lang|ang|Ænglaland}} and {{lang|ang|Ænglisc}}) are named after the Angles.{{sfn|Bosworth|Toller|1921}}

Old English was divided into four dialects: the Anglian dialects, [[Mercian dialect|Mercian]] and [[Northumbrian dialect|Northumbrian]], and the Saxon dialects, [[Kentish dialect (Old English)|Kentish]] and [[West Saxon dialect|West Saxon]].{{sfn|Campbell|1959|p=4}} Through the educational reforms of [[Alfred the Great|King Alfred]] in the ninth century and the influence of the kingdom of [[Wessex]], the West Saxon dialect became the [[standard language|standard written variety]].{{sfn|Toon|1992|loc=Chapter: Old English Dialects}} The [[epic poetry|epic poem]] ''[[Beowulf]]'' is written in West Saxon, and the earliest English poem, ''[[Cædmon's Hymn]]'', is written in Northumbrian.{{sfn|Donoghue|2008}} Modern English developed mainly from Mercian, but the [[Scots language]] developed from Northumbrian. A few short inscriptions from the early period of Old English were written using a [[Anglo-Saxon runes|runic script]].{{sfn|Gneuss |2013|p=23}} By the sixth century, a [[Old English Latin alphabet|Latin alphabet]] was adopted, written with [[half-uncial]] [[letterform]]s. It included the runic letters ''[[wynn]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|ƿ}}}} and ''[[Thorn (letter)|thorn]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|þ}}}}, and the modified Latin letters ''[[eth]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|ð}}}}, and ''[[Æ|ash]]'' {{angbr|{{lang|ang|æ}}}}.{{sfn|Gneuss |2013|p=23}}{{sfn|Denison|Hogg|2006|pp=30–31}}

Old English is very different from Modern English and difficult for 21st-century English speakers to understand. Its grammar was similar to that of modern [[German language|German]], and its closest relative is [[Old Frisian]]. [[Old English grammar|Nouns, adjectives, pronouns, and verbs]] had many more [[Inflectional morphology|inflectional endings and forms]], and word order was [[Pragmatic word order|much freer]] than in Modern English. Modern English has [[grammatical case|case forms]] in pronouns (''he'', ''him'', ''his'') and a few verb endings (''I have'', ''he has''), but Old English had case endings in nouns as well, and verbs had more [[grammatical person|person]] and [[grammatical number|number]] endings.{{sfn|Hogg|1992|loc=Chapter 3. Phonology and Morphology}}{{sfn|Smith|2009}}{{sfn|Trask|Trask|2010}}

The translation of Matthew 8:20 from 1000 CE shows examples of case endings ([[nominative case|nominative]] plural, [[accusative case|accusative]] plural, [[genitive case|genitive]] singular) and a verb ending ([[present tense|present]] plural):

}}

In the period from the 8th to the 12th century, Old English gradually transformed through [[language contact]] into [[Middle English]]. Middle English is often arbitrarily defined as beginning with the [[Norman conquest of England|conquest of England]] by [[William the Conqueror]] in 1066, but it developed further in the period from 1200–1450.

First, the waves of Norse colonisation of northern parts of the British Isles in the 8th and 9th centuries put Old English into intense contact with [[Old Norse]], a [[North Germanic]] language. Norse influence was strongest in the Northeastern varieties of Old English spoken in the [[Danelaw]] area around York, which was the centre of Norse colonisation; today these features are still particularly present in [[Scots language|Scots]] and [[Northern England English|Northern English]]. However the centre of norsified English seems to have been in [[the Midlands]] around [[Kingdom of Lindsey|Lindsey]], and after 920 CE when Lindsey was reincorporated into the Anglo-Saxon polity, Norse features spread from there into English varieties that had not been in intense contact with Norse speakers. Some elements of Norse influence that persist in all English varieties today are the pronouns beginning with ''th-'' (''they, them, their'') which replaced the Anglo-Saxon pronouns with {{lang|ang|h-}} ({{lang|ang|hie, him, hera}}).{{sfn|Thomason|Kaufman|1988|pp=284–290}}

With the [[Norman conquest of England]] in 1066, the now norsified Old English language was subject to contact with the [[Old Norman]] language, a [[Romance language]] closely related to Modern [[French language|French]]. The Norman language in England eventually developed into [[Anglo-Norman language|Anglo-Norman]]. Because Norman was spoken primarily by the elites and nobles, while the lower classes continued speaking Anglo-Saxon, the influence of Norman consisted of introducing a wide range of [[loanwords]] related to politics, legislation and prestigious social domains.{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=39}} Middle English also greatly simplified the inflectional system, probably in order to reconcile Old Norse and Old English, which were inflectionally different but morphologically similar. The distinction between nominative and accusative case was lost except in personal pronouns, the instrumental case was dropped, and the use of the genitive case was limited to describing [[Possession (linguistics)|possession]]. The inflectional system regularised many irregular inflectional forms,{{sfn|Lass|1992}} and gradually simplified the system of agreement, making word order less flexible.{{sfn|Fischer|van der Wurff|2006|pages=111–13}} By the [[Wycliffe Bible]] of the 1380s, the passage Matthew 8:20 was written

: {{lang|enm|Foxis han dennes, and briddis of heuene han nestis}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| last = Wycliffe | first = John | url=http://wesley.nnu.edu/fileadmin/imported_site/wycliffe/wycbible-all.pdf | publisher = Wesley NNU | title = Bible}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here the plural suffix {{lang|enm|-n}} on the verb ''have'' is still retained, but none of the case endings on the nouns are present.

By the 12th century Middle English was fully developed, integrating both Norse and Norman features; it continued to be spoken until the transition to early Modern English around 1500. Middle English literature includes [[Geoffrey Chaucer]]'s ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]'', and [[Thomas Malory|Malory's]] ''[[Le Morte d'Arthur]]''. In the Middle English period, the use of regional dialects in writing proliferated, and dialect traits were even used for effect by authors such as Chaucer.

=== Early Modern English ===
{{Main|Early Modern English}}

[[File:Great Vowel Shift2a.svg|right|upright=1.36|thumb|Graphic representation of the [[Great Vowel Shift]], showing how the pronunciation of the long vowels gradually shifted, with the high vowels i: and u: breaking into diphthongs and the lower vowels each shifting their pronunciation up one level]]

The next period in the history of English was Early Modern English (1500–1700). Early Modern English was characterised by the [[Great Vowel Shift]] (1350–1700), inflectional simplification, and linguistic standardisation.

The Great Vowel Shift affected the stressed long vowels of Middle English. It was a [[chain shift]], meaning that each shift triggered a subsequent shift in the vowel system. [[Mid vowel|Mid]] and [[open vowel]]s were [[raising (phonology)|raised]], and [[close vowel]]s were [[vowel breaking|broken]] into [[diphthong]]s. For example, the word ''bite'' was originally pronounced as the word ''beet'' is today, and the second vowel in the word ''about'' was pronounced as the word ''boot'' is today. The Great Vowel Shift explains many irregularities in spelling since English retains many spellings from Middle English, and it also explains why English vowel letters have very different pronunciations from the same letters in other languages.{{sfn|Lass|2000}}{{sfn|Görlach|1991|pp=66–70}}

English began to rise in prestige, relative to Norman French, during the reign of [[Henry V of England|Henry V]]. Around 1430, the [[Court of Chancery]] in [[Westminster]] began using English in its [[writ|official documents]], and a new standard form of Middle English, known as [[Chancery Standard]], developed from the dialects of London and the [[East Midlands English|East Midlands]]. In 1476, [[William Caxton]] introduced the [[printing press]] to England and began publishing the first printed books in London, expanding the influence of this form of English.{{sfn|Nevalainen|Tieken-Boon van Ostade|2006|pages=274–79}} Literature from the Early Modern period includes the works of [[William Shakespeare]] and the [[King James Version|translation of the Bible]] commissioned by [[James VI and I|King James I]]. Even after the vowel shift the language still sounded different from Modern English: for example, the [[consonant cluster]]s {{IPA|/kn ɡn sw/}} in ''knight'', ''gnat'', and ''sword'' were still pronounced. Many of the grammatical features that a modern reader of Shakespeare might find quaint or archaic represent the distinct characteristics of Early Modern English.{{sfn|Cercignani|1981}}

In the 1611 King James Version of the Bible, written in Early Modern English, Matthew 8:20 says:
: ''The Foxes haue holes and the birds of the ayre haue nests''{{sfn|Lass|2006|pp=46–47}}

This exemplifies the loss of case and its effects on sentence structure (replacement with Subject-Verb-Object word order, and the use of ''of'' instead of the non-possessive genitive), and the introduction of loanwords from French (''ayre'') and word replacements (''bird'' originally meaning "nestling" had replaced OE ''fugol'').

=== Spread of Modern English ===

By the late 18th century, the [[British Empire]] had facilitated the spread of English through its colonies and geopolitical dominance. Commerce, science and technology, diplomacy, art, and formal education all contributed to English becoming the first truly global language. English also facilitated worldwide international communication.{{sfn|How English evolved into a global language|2010}}{{sfn|The Routes of English}} As England continued to form new colonies, these, in turn, became independent and developed their own norms for how to speak and write the language. English was adopted in North America, India, parts of Africa, Australasia, and many other regions. In the post-colonial period, some of the newly created nations that had multiple [[indigenous language]]s opted to continue using English as the official language to avoid the political difficulties inherent in promoting any one indigenous language above the others.{{sfn|Romaine|2006|p=586}}{{sfn|Mufwene|2006|p=614}}{{sfn|Northrup|2013|pp=81–86}} In the 20th century the growing economic and cultural influence of the United States and its status as a [[superpower]] following the Second World War has, along with worldwide broadcasting in English by the [[BBC]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Colin|title=''Encyclopedia of Bilingualism and Bilingual Education'', page CCCXI|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YgtSqB9oqDIC|date=August 1998|publisher=Multilingual Matters Ltd|accessdate=9 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other broadcasters, significantly accelerated the spread of the language across the planet.{{sfn|Graddol|2006}}{{sfn|Crystal|2003a}} By the 21st century, English was more widely spoken and written than any language has ever been.{{sfn|McCrum|MacNeil|Cran|2003|pp=9–10}}

A major feature in the early development of Modern English was the codification of explicit norms for standard usage, and their dissemination through official media such as public education and state-sponsored publications. In 1755 [[Samuel Johnson]] published his ''[[A Dictionary of the English Language]]'' which introduced a standard set of spelling conventions and usage norms. In 1828, [[Noah Webster]] published the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|American Dictionary of the English language]]'' in an effort to establish a norm for speaking and writing American English that was independent from the British standard. Within Britain, non-standard or lower class dialect features were increasingly stigmatised, leading to the quick spread of the prestige varieties among the middle classes.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|pp=1–56}}

In terms of grammatical evolution, Modern English has now reached a stage where the loss of case is almost complete (case is now only found in pronouns, such as ''he'' and ''him'', ''she'' and ''her'', ''who'' and ''whom''), and where SVO word-order is mostly fixed.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|pp=1–56}} Some changes, such as the use of [[do-support]] have become universalised. (Earlier English did not use the word "do" as a general auxiliary as Modern English does; at first it was only used in question constructions where it was not obligatory.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|p=2|quote=Other changes such as the spread and regularisation of do support began in the thirteenth century and were more or less complete in the nineteenth. Although do coexisted with the simple verb forms in negative statements from the early ninth century, obligatoriness was not complete until the nineteenth. The increasing use of do periphrasis coincides with the fixing of SVO word order. Not surprisingly, do is first widely used in interrogatives, where the word order is disrupted, and then later spread to negatives.}} Now, do-support with the verb ''have'' is becoming increasingly standardised.) The use of progressive forms in ''-ing'', appears to be spreading to new constructions, and forms such as ''had been being built'' are becoming more common. Regularisation of irregular forms also slowly continues (e.g. ''dreamed'' instead of ''dreamt''), and analytical alternatives to inflectional forms are becoming more common (e.g. ''more polite'' instead of ''politer''). British English is also undergoing change under the influence of American English, fuelled by the strong presence of American English in the media and the prestige associated with the US as a world power. {{sfn|Leech|Hundt|Mair|Smith|2009|pp=18–19}}{{sfn|Mair|Leech|2006}}{{sfn|Mair|2006}}

The countries in which English is spoken can be grouped into different categories by how English is used in each country. The "inner circle"{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=2}} countries with many native speakers of English share an international standard of written English and jointly influence speech norms of English around the world. English does not belong to just one country, and it does not belong solely to descendants of English settlers. English is an official language of countries populated by few descendants of native speakers of English. It has also become by far the most important language of international communication when [[lingua franca|people who share no native language meet anywhere in the world]].

=== Three circles of English-speaking countries ===
[[Braj Kachru]] distinguishes countries where English is spoken with a [[Three Circles of English|three circles model]].{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=2}} In his model, the "inner circle" countries are countries with large communities of native speakers of English, "outer circle" countries have small communities of native speakers of English but widespread use of English as a second language in education or broadcasting or for local official purposes, and "expanding circle" countries are countries where many learners learn English as a foreign language. Kachru bases his model on the history of how English spread in different countries, how users acquire English, and the range of uses English has in each country. The three circles change membership over time.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=196}}

[[File:Kachru's three circles of English.svg|thumb|alt=Braj Kachru's Three Circles of English|Braj Kachru's ''Three Circles of English''.]]
Countries with large communities of native speakers of English (the inner circle) include Britain, the United States, Australia, Canada, Ireland, and New Zealand, where the majority speaks English, and South Africa, where a significant minority speaks English. The countries with the most native English speakers are, in descending order, the [[United States]] (at least 231 million),{{sfn|Ryan|2013|loc=Table 1}} the [[United Kingdom]] (60 million),{{sfn|Office for National Statistics|2013|loc=Key Points}}{{sfn|National Records of Scotland|2013}}{{sfn|Northern Ireland Statistics and Research Agency|2012|loc=Table KS207NI: Main Language}} Canada (19 million),{{sfn|Statistics Canada|2014}} [[Australia]] (at least 17 million),{{sfn|Australian Bureau of Statistics|2013}} South Africa (4.8 million),{{sfn|Statistics South Africa|2012|loc=Table 2.5 Population by first language spoken and province (number)}} [[Republic of Ireland|Ireland]] (4.2 million), and New Zealand (3.7 million).{{sfn|Statistics New Zealand|2014}} In these countries, children of native speakers learn English from their parents, and local people who speak other languages or new immigrants learn English to communicate in their neighbourhoods and workplaces.{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}} The inner-circle countries provide the base from which English spreads to other countries in the world.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=196}}

Estimates of the number of English speakers who are [[second language]] and foreign-language speakers vary greatly from 470 million to more than 1,000 million depending on how proficiency is defined.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=108–109}} Linguist [[David Crystal]] estimates that non-native speakers now outnumber native speakers by a ratio of 3 to 1.{{sfn|Crystal|2003a|p=69}} In Kachru's three-circles model, the "outer circle" countries are countries such as the [[Philippines]],{{sfn|Rubino|2006}} [[Jamaica]],{{sfn|Patrick|2006a}} India, Pakistan, Singapore,{{sfn|Lim|Ansaldo|2006}} and [[Nigeria]]{{sfn|Connell|2006}}{{sfn|Schneider|2007}} with a much smaller proportion of native speakers of English but much use of English as a second language for education, government, or domestic business,
and where English is routinely used for school instruction and official interactions with the government.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=5}}

Those countries have millions of native speakers of [[dialect continuum|dialect continua]] ranging from an [[English-based creole languages|English-based creole]] to a more standard version of English. They have many more speakers of English who acquire English in the process of growing up through day by day use and listening to broadcasting, especially if they attend schools where English is the medium of instruction. Varieties of English learned by speakers who are not native speakers born to English-speaking parents may be influenced, especially in their grammar, by the other languages spoken by those learners.{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}} Most of those varieties of English include words little used by native speakers of English in the inner-circle countries,{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}} and they may have grammatical and phonological differences from inner-circle varieties as well. The standard English of the inner-circle countries is often taken as a norm for use of English in the outer-circle countries.{{sfn|Bao|2006|p=377}}

In the three-circles model, countries such as Poland, China, Brazil, Germany, Japan, Indonesia, Egypt, and other countries where English is taught as a foreign language make up the "expanding circle".{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=4}} The distinctions between English as a first language, as a second language, and as a foreign language are often debatable and may change in particular countries over time.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=5}} For example, in the [[Netherlands]] and some other countries of Europe, knowledge of English as a second language is nearly universal, with over 80 percent of the population able to use it,{{sfn|European Commission|2012}} and thus English is routinely used to communicate with foreigners and often in higher education. In these countries, although English is not used for government business, its widespread use puts them at the boundary between the "outer circle" and "expanding circle". English is unusual among world languages in how many of its users are not native speakers but speakers of English as a second or foreign language.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=197}}

Many users of English in the expanding circle use it to communicate with other people from the expanding circle, so that interaction with native speakers of English plays no part in their decision to use English.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=198}} Non-native varieties of English are widely used for international communication, and speakers of one such variety often encounter features of other varieties.{{sfn|Bao|2006}} Very often today a conversation in English anywhere in the world may include no native speakers of English at all, even while including speakers from several different countries.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=7}}

=== Pluricentric English ===

English is a [[pluricentric language]], which means that no one national authority sets the standard for use of the language.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=2}}{{sfn|Romaine|1999}}{{sfn|Baugh|Cable|2002}}{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|pp=8–9}} But English is not a divided language,{{sfn|Ammon|2008|p=1539}} despite a long-standing joke originally attributed to [[George Bernard Shaw]] that the United Kingdom and the United States are "two countries separated by a common language".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Marsh|first=David|title=Lickety splits: two nations divided by a common language |work=[[The Guardian]] (UK)|date=26 November 2010 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/mind-your-language/2010/nov/26/americanisms-english-mind-your-language |accessdate=26 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spoken English, for example English used in broadcasting, generally follows national pronunciation standards that are also established by custom rather than by regulation. International broadcasters are usually identifiable as coming from one country rather than another through their [[Accent (sociolinguistics)|accents]],{{sfn|Trudgill|2006}} but newsreader scripts are also composed largely in international [[standard written English]]. The norms of standard written English are maintained purely by the consensus of educated English-speakers around the world, without any oversight by any government or international organisation.{{sfn|Ammon|2008|pp=1537–1539}}

American listeners generally readily understand most British broadcasting, and British listeners readily understand most American broadcasting. Most English speakers around the world can understand radio programmes, television programmes, and films from many parts of the English-speaking world.{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=122}} Both standard and non-standard varieties of English can include both formal or informal styles, distinguished by word choice and syntax and use both technical and non-technical registers.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|pp=5–6}}

The settlement history of the English-speaking inner circle countries outside Britain helped level dialect distinctions and produce [[Koiné language|koineised]] forms of English in South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand.{{sfn|Deumert|2006|p=130}} The majority of immigrants to the United States without British ancestry rapidly adopted English after arrival. Now the majority of the United States population are monolingual English speakers,{{sfn|Deumert|2006|p=131}}{{sfn|Ryan|2013|loc=Table 1}} although English has been given official status by only 30 of the 50 state governments of the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.languagepolicy.net/archives/langleg.htm |title=Language Legislation in the U.S.A. |publisher=languagepolicy.net |date=1 February 2012 |author=Crawford, James |accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.us-english.org/view/13 |title=States with Official English Laws |publisher=us-english.org |accessdate=29 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515100118/http://www.us-english.org/view/13 |archivedate=15 May 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== English as a global language ===
{{See also|Foreign language influences in English|Study of global communication}}
English has ceased to be an "English language" in the sense of belonging only to people who are ethnically [[English people|English]].{{sfn|Romaine|1999|p=5}}{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|p=1}} Use of English is growing country-by-country internally and for international communication. Most people learn English for practical rather than ideological reasons.{{sfn|Kachru|2006|p=195}} Many speakers of English in Africa have become part of an "Afro-Saxon" language community that unites Africans from different countries.{{sfn|Mazrui|Mazrui|1998}}

As decolonisation proceeded throughout the British Empire in the 1950s and 1960s, former colonies often did not reject English but rather continued to use it as independent countries setting their own language policies.{{sfn|Mufwene|2006|p=614}}{{sfn|Northrup|2013|pp=81–86}}{{sfn|Mesthrie|2010|p=594}} For example, the view of the [[Indian English|English language]] among many Indians has gone from associating it with colonialism to associating it with economic progress, and English continues to be an official language of India.{{sfn|Annamalai|2006}} English is also widely used in media and literature, and the number of English language books published annually in India is the third largest in the world after the US and UK.{{sfn|Sailaja|2009|pages=2–9}} However English is rarely spoken as a first language, numbering only around a couple hundred-thousand people, and less than 5% of the population speak fluent English in India.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Indiaspeak: English is our 2nd language – The Times of India|url = http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Indiaspeak-English-is-our-2nd-language/articleshow/5680962.cms?referral=PM|website = The Times of India|accessdate = 5 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://ihds.umd.edu/IHDS_files/HumanDevelopmentinIndia.pdf |title=Human Development in India: Challenges for a Society in Transition |date=2005 |journal=Oxford University Press |doi= |pmid= |access-date=5 January 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151211124532/http://www.ihds.umd.edu/IHDS_files/HumanDevelopmentinIndia.pdf |archivedate=11 December 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Crystal claimed in 2004 that, combining native and non-native speakers, India now has more people who speak or understand English than any other country in the world,{{sfn|Crystal|2004}} but the number of English speakers in India is very uncertain, with most scholars concluding that the United States still has more speakers of English than India.{{sfn|Graddol|2010}}

Modern English, sometimes described as the first global [[lingua franca]],{{sfn|Graddol|2006}}{{sfn|Meierkord|2006|p=165}} is also regarded as the first [[world language]].{{sfn|Brutt-Griffler|2006|p=690–91}}{{sfn|Northrup|2013}} English is the world's most widely used language in newspaper publishing, book publishing, international telecommunications, scientific publishing, international trade, mass entertainment, and diplomacy.{{sfn|Northrup|2013}} English is, by international treaty, the basis for the required [[controlled natural language]]s{{sfn|Wojcik|2006|p=139}} [[Seaspeak]] and Airspeak, used as [[international auxiliary language|international languages]] of seafaring{{sfn|International Maritime Organization|2011}} and aviation.{{sfn|International Civil Aviation Organization|2011}} English used to have parity with French and German in scientific research, but now it dominates that field.{{sfn|Gordin|2015}} It achieved parity with [[French language|French]] as a language of diplomacy at the [[Treaty of Versailles]] negotiations in 1919.{{sfn|Phillipson|2004|p=47}} By the time of the foundation of the [[United Nations]] at the end of [[World War II]], English had become pre-eminent {{sfn|ConradRubal-Lopez|1996|p=261}} and is now the main worldwide language of diplomacy and international relations.{{sfn|Richter|2012|p=29}} It is one of six official languages of the United Nations.{{sfn|United Nations|2008}} Many other worldwide international organisations, including the [[International Olympic Committee]], specify English as a working language or official language of the organisation.

Many regional international organisations such as the [[European Free Trade Association]], [[Association of Southeast Asian Nations]] (ASEAN),{{sfn|Crystal|2003a}} and [[Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation]] (APEC) set English as their organisation's sole working language even though most members are not countries with a majority of native English speakers. While the European Union (EU) allows member states to designate any of the national languages as an official language of the Union, in practice English is the main working language of EU organisations.{{sfn|Ammon|2006|p=321}}

Although in most countries English is not an official language, it is currently the language most often taught as a [[foreign language]].{{sfn|Graddol|2006}}{{sfn|Crystal|2003a}} In the countries of the EU, English is the most widely spoken foreign language in nineteen of the twenty-five member states where it is not an official language (that is, the countries other than the UK, Ireland and [[Malta]]). In a 2012 official Eurobarometer poll, 38 percent of the EU respondents outside the countries where English is an official language said they could speak English well enough to have a conversation in that language. The next most commonly mentioned foreign language, French (which is the most widely known foreign language in the UK and Ireland), could be used in conversation by 12 percent of respondents.{{sfn|European Commission|2012|pp=21, 19}}

A working knowledge of English has become a requirement in a number of occupations and professions such as medicine{{sfn|Alcaraz Ariza|Navarro|2006}} and computing. English has become so important in scientific publishing that more than 80 percent of all scientific journal articles indexed by ''Chemical Abstracts'' in 1998 were written in English, as were 90 percent of all articles in natural science publications by 1996 and 82 percent of articles in humanities publications by 1995.{{sfn|Brutt-Griffler|2006|p=694–95}}

Specialised subsets of English arise spontaneously in international communities, for example, among international business people, as an [[International auxiliary language|auxiliary language]]. This has led some scholars to develop the study of English as an auxiliary language. [[Globish (Nerriere)|Globish]] uses a relatively small subset of English vocabulary (about 1500 words with highest use in international business English) in combination with the standard English grammar. Other examples include [[Simple English Wikipedia|Simple English]].

The increased use of the English language globally has had an effect on other languages, leading to some English words being assimilated into the vocabularies of other languages. This influence of English has led to concerns about [[language death]],{{sfn|Crystal|2002}} and to claims of [[linguistic imperialism]],{{sfn|Jambor|2007}} and has provoked resistance to the spread of English; however the number of speakers continues to increase because many people around the world think that English provides them with opportunities for better employment and improved lives.{{sfn|Svartvik|Leech|2006|loc=Chapter 12: English into the Future}}

Although some scholars mention a possibility of future divergence of English dialects into mutually unintelligible languages, most think a more likely outcome is that English will continue to function as a [[Koiné language|koineised]] language in which the standard form unifies speakers from around the world.{{sfn|Crystal|2006}} English is used as the language for wider communication in countries around the world.{{sfn|Brutt-Griffler|2006}} Thus English has grown in worldwide use much more than any [[constructed language]] proposed as an [[international auxiliary language]], including [[Esperanto]].{{sfn|Li|2003}}{{sfn|Meierkord|2006|p=163}}

== Phonology ==
{{Main|English phonology}}
The [[phonetics]] and [[phonology]] of the English language differ from one dialect to another, usually without interfering with mutual communication. Phonological variation affects the inventory of [[phoneme]]s (i.e. speech sounds that distinguish meaning), and phonetic variation consists in differences in pronunciation of the phonemes. {{sfn|Wolfram|2006|pp=334–335}} This overview mainly describes the [[standard language|standard pronunciations]] of the [[United Kingdom]] and the [[United States]]: [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP) and [[General American]] (GA). (See {{slink||Dialects, accents, and varieties}}, below.)

In the table, when [[obstruent]]s (stops, affricates, and fricatives) appear in pairs, such as {{IPA|/p b/}}, {{IPA|/tʃ dʒ/}}, and {{IPA|/s z/}}, the first is [[fortis and lenis|fortis]] (strong) and the second is lenis (weak). Fortis obstruents, such as {{IPA|/p tʃ s/}} are pronounced with more muscular tension and breath force than lenis consonants, such as {{IPA|/b dʒ z/}}, and are always [[voicelessness|voiceless]]. Lenis consonants are partly [[voice (phonetics)|voiced]] at the beginning and end of utterances, and fully voiced between vowels. Fortis stops such as {{IPA|/p/}} have additional articulatory or acoustic features in most dialects: they are [[aspirated consonant|aspirated]] {{IPA|[pʰ]}} when they occur alone at the beginning of a stressed syllable, often unaspirated in other cases, and often [[unreleased stop|unreleased]] {{IPA|[p̚]}} or pre-glottalised {{IPA|[ʔp]}} at the end of a syllable. In a single-syllable word, a vowel before a fortis stop is shortened: thus ''nip'' has a noticeably shorter vowel (phonetically, but not phonemically) than ''nib'' {{IPA|[nɪˑb̥]}} ([[#Vowels|see below]]).{{sfn|Collins|Mees|2003|pages=47–53}}
* lenis stops: ''bin'' {{IPA|[b̥ɪˑn]}}, ''about'' {{IPA|[əˈbaʊt]}}, ''nib'' {{IPA|[nɪˑb̥]}}
* fortis stops: ''pin'' {{IPA|[pʰɪn]}}; ''spin'' {{IPA|[spɪn]}}; ''happy'' {{IPA|[ˈhæpi]}}; ''nip'' {{IPA|[nɪp̚]}} or {{IPA|[nɪʔp]}}

In RP, the lateral approximant {{IPA|/l/}}, has two main [[allophone]]s (pronunciation variants): the clear or plain {{IPA|[l]}}, as in ''light'', and the dark or [[velarized alveolar lateral approximant|velarised]] {{IPA|[ɫ]}}, as in ''full''.{{Sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=13}} GA has dark ''l'' in most cases.{{Sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2008|p=41}}
* clear ''l'': RP ''light'' {{IPA|[laɪt]}}
* dark ''l'': RP and GA ''full'' {{IPA|[fʊɫ]}}, GA ''light'' {{IPA|[ɫaɪt]}}

All [[sonorant]]s (liquids {{IPA|/l, r/}} and nasals {{IPA|/m, n, ŋ/}}) devoice when following a voiceless obstruent, and they are syllabic when following a consonant at the end of a word.{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|pages=56–59}}
* voiceless sonorants: ''clay'' {{IPA|[kl̥eɪ̯]}}; ''snow'' RP {{IPA|[sn̥əʊ̯]}}, GA {{IPA|[sn̥oʊ̯]}}
* syllabic sonorants: ''paddle'' {{IPA|[ˈpad.l̩]}}, ''button'' {{IPA|[ˈbʌt.n̩]}}

=== Vowels ===
{{Main|English phonology#Vowels}}

The pronunciation of vowels varies a great deal between dialects and is one of the most detectable aspects of a speaker's accent. The table below lists the vowel [[phoneme]]s in Received Pronunciation (RP) and General American (GA), with examples of words in which they occur from [[lexical set]]s compiled by linguists. The vowels are represented with symbols from the International Phonetic Alphabet; those given for RP are standard in British dictionaries and other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wells|first=John C.|date=8 February 2001|url=https://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/wells/ipa-english-uni.htm|title=IPA transcription systems for English|publisher=University College London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In RP, vowel length is phonemic; [[vowel length|long vowels]] are marked with a [[triangular colon]] {{angbr|{{IPA|ː}}}} in the table above, such as the vowel of ''need'' {{IPA|[niːd]}} as opposed to ''bid'' {{IPA|[bɪd]}}. In GA, vowel length is non-distinctive.

In both RP and GA, vowels are phonetically [[clipping (phonetics)|shortened before fortis consonants]] in the same [[syllable]], like {{IPA|/t tʃ f/}}, but not before lenis consonants like {{IPA|/d dʒ v/}} or in open syllables: thus, the vowels of ''rich'' {{IPA|[rɪtʃ]}}, ''neat'' {{IPA|[nit]}}, and ''safe'' {{IPA|[seɪ̯f]}} are noticeably shorter than the vowels of ''ridge'' {{IPA|[rɪˑdʒ]}}, ''need'' {{IPA|[niˑd]}}, and ''save'' {{IPA|[seˑɪ̯v]}}, and the vowel of ''light'' {{IPA|[laɪ̯t]}} is shorter than that of ''lie'' {{IPA|[laˑɪ̯]}}. Because lenis consonants are frequently voiceless at the end of a syllable, vowel length is an important cue as to whether the following consonant is lenis or fortis.{{sfn|Collins|Mees|2003|pp=46–50}}

The vowel {{IPA|/ə/}} only occurs in unstressed syllables and is more open in quality in stem-final positions.{{sfn|Cruttenden|2014|p=138}}{{sfn|Flemming|Johnson|2007}} Some dialects do not contrast {{IPA|/ɪ/}} and {{IPA|/ə/}} in unstressed positions, so that ''rabbit'' and ''abbot'' rhyme and ''Lenin'' and ''Lennon'' are homophonous, a dialect feature called [[weak vowel merger]].{{sfn|Wells|1982|p=167}} GA {{IPA|/ɜr/}} and {{IPA|/ər/}} are realised as an [[r-colored vowel|''r''-coloured vowel]] {{IPA|[ɚ]}}, as in ''further'' {{IPA|[ˈfɚðɚ]}} (phonemically {{IPA|/ˈfɜrðər/}}), which in RP is realised as {{IPA|[ˈfəːðə]}} (phonemically {{IPA|/ˈfɜːðə/}}).{{sfn|Wells|1982|p=121}}

=== Phonotactics ===
An English syllable includes a syllable nucleus consisting of a vowel sound. Syllable onset and coda (start and end) are optional. A syllable can start with up to three consonant sounds, as in ''sprint'' {{IPA|/sprɪnt/}}, and end with up to four, as in ''texts'' {{IPA|/teksts/}}. This gives an English syllable the following structure, (CCC)V(CCCC) where C represents a consonant and V a vowel; the word ''strengths'' {{IPA|/strɛŋkθs/}} is thus an example of the most complex syllable possible in English. The consonants that may appear together in onsets or codas are restricted, as is the order in which they may appear. Onsets can only have four types of consonant clusters: a stop and approximant, as in ''play''; a voiceless fricative and approximant, as in ''fly'' or ''sly''; ''s'' and a voiceless stop, as in ''stay''; and ''s'', a voiceless stop, and an approximant, as in ''string''.{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|page=60}} Clusters of nasal and stop are only allowed in codas. Clusters of obstruents always agree invoicing, and clusters of sibilants and of plosives with the same point of articulation are prohibited. Furthermore, several consonants have limited distributions: {{IPA|/h/}} can only occur in syllable-initial position, and {{IPA|/ŋ/}} only in syllable-final position.{{sfn|König|1994|pages=537–538}}

=== Stress, rhythm and intonation ===
{{See also|Stress and vowel reduction in English|Intonation in English}}

[[stress (linguistics)|Stress]] plays an important role in English. Certain [[syllable]]s are stressed, while others are unstressed. Stress is a combination of duration, intensity, vowel quality, and sometimes changes in pitch. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer and louder than unstressed syllables, and vowels in unstressed syllables are frequently [[vowel reduction|reduced]] while vowels in stressed syllables are not.{{sfn|International Phonetic Association|1999|page=42}} Some words, primarily short function words but also some modal verbs such as ''can'', have [[weak and strong forms in English|weak and strong forms]] depending on whether they occur in stressed or non-stressed position within a sentence.

Stress in English is [[phoneme|phonemic]], and some pairs of words are distinguished by stress. For instance, the word ''contract'' is stressed on the first syllable ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|ɒ|n|t|r|æ|k|t}} {{respell|KON|trakt}}) when used as a noun, but on the last syllable ({{IPAc-en|k|ə|n|ˈ|t|r|æ|k|t}} {{respell|kən|TRAKT|'}}) for most meanings (for example, "reduce in size") when used as a verb.{{sfn|Oxford Learner's Dictionary|2015|loc=Entry "contract"}}{{sfn|Merriam Webster|2015|loc=Entry "contract"}}{{sfn|Macquarie Dictionary|2015|loc=Entry "contract"}} Here stress is connected to [[vowel reduction]]: in the noun "contract" the first syllable is stressed and has the unreduced vowel {{IPA|/ɒ/}}, but in the verb "contract" the first syllable is unstressed and its vowel is reduced to {{IPA|/ə/}}. Stress is also used to distinguish between words and phrases, so that a compound word receives a single stress unit, but the corresponding phrase has two: e.g. ''a burnout'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜːr|n|aʊ|t}}) versus ''to burn out'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|ɜːr|n|_|ˈ|aʊ|t}}), and ''a hotdog'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|t|d|ɒ|g}}) versus ''a hot dog'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|h|ɒ|t|_|ˈ|d|ɒ|g}}).{{sfn|Brinton|Brinton|2010|page=66}}

In terms of [[rhythm]], English is generally described as a [[stress-timed]] language, meaning that the amount of time between stressed syllables tends to be equal. Stressed syllables are pronounced longer, but unstressed syllables (syllables between stresses) are shortened. Vowels in unstressed syllables are shortened as well, and vowel shortening causes changes in [[vowel quality]]: [[vowel reduction]].

Varieties of English vary the most in pronunciation of vowels. The best known national varieties used as standards for education in non English-speaking countries are British (BrE) and American (AmE). Countries such as [[Canadian English|Canada]], [[Australian English|Australia]], [[Hiberno English|Ireland]], [[New Zealand English|New Zealand]] and [[South African English|South Africa]] have their own standard varieties which are less often used as standards for education internationally. Some differences between the various dialects are shown in the table "Varieties of Standard English and their features".{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pp=4–6}}

English has undergone many [[Phonological history of English|historical sound changes]], some of them affecting all varieties, and others affecting only a few. Most standard varieties are affected by the [[Great Vowel Shift]], which changed the pronunciation of long vowels, but a few dialects have slightly different results. In North America, a number of chain shifts such as the [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]] and [[Canadian Shift]] have produced very different vowel landscapes in some regional accents.

Some dialects have fewer or more consonant phonemes and [[phone (phonetics)|phones]] than the standard varieties. Some conservative varieties like Scottish English have a [[voicelessness|voiceless]] {{IPAblink|ʍ}} sound in ''whine'' that contrasts with the voiced {{IPA|[w]}} in ''wine'', but most other dialects pronounce both words with voiced {{IPA|[w]}}, a dialect feature called [[wine–whine merger|''wine''–''whine'' merger]]. The unvoiced velar fricative sound {{IPA|/x/}} is found in Scottish English, which distinguishes ''loch'' {{IPA|/lɔx/}} from ''lock'' {{IPA|/lɔk/}}. Accents like [[Cockney]] with "''h''-dropping" lack the glottal fricative {{IPA|/h/}}, and dialects with [[th-stopping|''th''-stopping]] and [[th-fronting|''th''-fronting]] like [[African American Vernacular English|African American Vernacular]] and [[Estuary English]] do not have the dental fricatives {{IPA|/θ, ð/}}, but replace them with dental or alveolar stops {{IPA|/t, d/}} or labiodental fricatives {{IPA|/f, v/}}.{{sfn|Roach|2009|p=53}}{{sfn|Giegerich|1992|page=36}} Other changes affecting the phonology of local varieties are processes such as [[Yod-dropping|''yod''-dropping]], [[yod-coalescence|''yod''-coalescence]], and reduction of consonant clusters.

[[General American]] and [[Received Pronunciation]] vary in their pronunciation of historical {{IPA|/r/}} after a vowel at the end of a syllable (in the [[syllable coda]]). GA is a [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic dialect]], meaning that it pronounces {{IPA|/r/}} at the end of a syllable, but RP is non-rhotic, meaning that it loses {{IPA|/r/}} in that position. English dialects are classified as rhotic or non-rhotic depending on whether they elide {{IPA|/r/}} like RP or keep it like GA.{{sfn|Lass|2000|p=114}}

There is complex dialectal variation in words with the [[Phonological history of English short A|open front]] and [[Phonological history of English low back vowels|open back vowels]] {{IPA|/æ ɑː ɒ ɔː/}}. These four vowels are only distinguished in RP, Australia, New Zealand and South Africa. In GA, these vowels merge to three {{IPA|/æ ɑ ɔ/}},{{sfn|Wells|1982|pages=xviii-xix}} and in Canadian English, they merge to two {{IPA|/æ ɑ/}}.{{sfn|Wells|1982|page=493}} In addition, the words that have each vowel vary by dialect. The table "Dialects and open vowels" shows this variation with [[lexical set]]s in which these sounds occur.

== Grammar ==
{{Main|English grammar}}
As is typical of an Indo-European language, English follows [[Nominative–accusative language|accusative]] [[morphosyntactic alignment]]. Unlike other Indo-European languages though, English has largely abandoned the inflectional [[case system]] in favor of [[analytic language|analytic]] constructions. Only the [[personal pronouns]] retain morphological case more strongly than any other [[word class]]. English distinguishes at least seven major word classes: verbs, nouns, adjectives, adverbs, determiners (including articles), prepositions, and conjunctions. Some analyses add pronouns as a class separate from nouns, and subdivide conjunctions into subordinators and coordinators, and add the class of interjections.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=22}} English also has a rich set of auxiliary verbs, such as ''have'' and ''do'', expressing the categories of mood and aspect. Questions are marked by [[do-support]], [[wh-movement]] (fronting of question words beginning with ''wh''-) and word order [[Subject–auxiliary inversion|inversion]] with some verbs.

Some traits typical of Germanic languages persist in English, such as the distinction between irregularly inflected [[strong inflection|strong]] stems inflected through [[ablaut]] (i.e. changing the vowel of the stem, as in the pairs ''speak/spoke'' and ''foot/feet'') and weak stems inflected through affixation (such as ''love/loved'', ''hand/hands''). Vestiges of the case and gender system are found in the pronoun system (''he/him, who/whom'') and in the inflection of the copula verb ''to be''.

The seven word classes are exemplified in this sample sentence:{{sfb|Aarts|Haegeman|2006|page=118}}
{| style="text-align: center;"
|-
| ''The'' || ''chairman'' || ''of'' || ''the'' || ''committee'' || ''and'' || ''the'' || ''loquacious'' || ''politician'' || ''clashed'' || ''violently'' || ''when'' || ''the'' || ''meeting'' || ''started''.
|-
| Det. || Noun || Prep. || Det. || Noun || Conj. || Det. || Adj. || Noun || Verb || Advb. || Conj. || Det. || Noun || Verb
|}

=== Nouns and noun phrases ===

English nouns are only inflected for number and possession. New nouns can be formed through derivation or compounding. They are semantically divided into [[proper nouns]] (names) and common nouns. Common nouns are in turn divided into concrete and abstract nouns, and grammatically into [[count noun]]s and [[mass nouns]].{{sfn|Payne|Huddleston|2002}}

Most count nouns are inflected for plural number through the use of the plural [[suffix]] -''s'', but a few nouns have irregular plural forms. Mass nouns can only be pluralised through the use of a count noun classifier, e.g. ''one loaf of bread'', ''two loaves of bread''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=56–57}}

Regular plural formation:
: Singular: ''cat, dog''
: Plural: ''cats, dogs''

Irregular plural formation:
: Singular: ''man, woman, foot, fish, ox, knife, mouse''
: Plural: ''men, women, feet, fish, oxen, knives, mice''

Possession can be expressed either by the possessive [[enclitic]] -''s'' (also traditionally called a genitive suffix), or by the preposition ''of''. Historically the -s possessive has been used for animate nouns, whereas the ''of'' possessive has been reserved for inanimate nouns. Today this distinction is less clear, and many speakers use -''s'' also with inanimates. Orthographically the possessive -s is separated from the noun root with an apostrophe.

Possessive constructions:
: With -s: ''The woman's husband's child''
: With of: ''The child of the husband of the woman''

Nouns can form [[noun phrase]]s (NPs) where they are the syntactic head of the words that depend on them such as determiners, quantifiers, conjunctions or adjectives.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=55}} Noun phrases can be short, such as ''the man'', composed only of a determiner and a noun. They can also include modifiers such as adjectives (e.g. ''red'', ''tall'', ''all'') and specifiers such as determiners (e.g. ''the'', ''that''). But they can also tie together several nouns into a single long NP, using conjunctions such as ''and'', or prepositions such as ''with'', e.g. ''the tall man with the long red trousers and his skinny wife with the spectacles'' (this NP uses conjunctions, prepositions, specifiers, and modifiers). Regardless of length, an NP functions as a syntactic unit. For example, the possessive enclitic can, in cases which do not lead to ambiguity, follow the entire noun phrase, as in ''The President of India's wife'', where the enclitic follows ''India'' and not ''President''.

The class of determiners is used to specify the noun they precede in terms of [[definiteness]], where ''the'' marks a definite noun and ''a'' or ''an'' an indefinite one. A definite noun is assumed by the speaker to be already known by the interlocutor, whereas an indefinite noun is not specified as being previously known. Quantifiers, which include ''one'', ''many'', ''some'' and ''all'', are used to specify the noun in terms of quantity or number. The noun must agree with the number of the determiner, e.g. ''one man'' (sg.) but ''all men'' (pl.). Determiners are the first constituents in a noun phrase.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=54–5}}

==== Adjectives ====

Adjectives modify a noun by providing additional information about their referents. In English, adjectives come before the nouns they modify and after determiners.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=57}} In Modern English, adjectives are not inflected, and they do not [[agreement (linguistics)|agree]] in form with the noun they modify, as adjectives in most other Indo-European languages do. For example, in the phrases ''the slender boy'', and ''many slender girls'', the adjective ''slender'' does not change form to agree with either the number or gender of the noun.

Some adjectives are inflected for [[comparison (grammar)|degree of comparison]], with the positive degree unmarked, the suffix ''-er'' marking the comparative, and ''-est'' marking the superlative: ''a small boy'', ''the boy is smaller than the girl'', ''that boy is the smallest''. Some adjectives have irregular comparative and superlative forms, such as ''good'', ''better'', and ''best''. Other adjectives have comparatives formed by [[periphrasis|periphrastic constructions]], with the adverb ''more'' marking the comparative, and ''most'' marking the superlative: ''happier'' or ''more happy'', ''the happiest'' or ''most happy''.{{sfn|König|1994|page=540}} There is some variation among speakers regarding which adjectives use inflected or periphrastic comparison, and some studies have shown a tendency for the periphrastic forms to become more common at the expense of the inflected form.{{sfn|Mair|2006|pages=148–49}}

==== Pronouns, case, and person ====

English pronouns conserve many traits of case and gender inflection. The personal pronouns retain a difference between subjective and objective case in most persons (''I/me, he/him, she/her, we/us, they/them'') as well as a gender and animateness distinction in the third person singular (distinguishing ''he/she/it''). The [[subjective case]] corresponds to the Old English [[nominative case]], and the [[objective case]] is used both in the sense of the previous [[accusative case]] (in the role of patient, or direct object of a transitive verb), and in the sense of the Old English dative case (in the role of a recipient or [[indirect object]] of a transitive verb).{{sfn|Leech|2006|page=69|quote="Nominative is a traditional name for the subjective case"}}{{sfn|O'Dwyer|2006|quote="English has subjective, objective and possessive cases."}} Subjective case is used when the pronoun is the subject of a finite clause, and otherwise, the objective case is used.{{sfn|Greenbaum|Nelson|2002}} While grammarians such as [[Henry Sweet]]{{sfn|Sweet|2014|page=52|quote=But in that special class of nouns called personal pronouns we find a totally different system of case-inflection, namely, a '''nominative''' case (he) and an '''objective''' case (him)}} and [[Otto Jespersen]]{{sfn|Jespersen|2007|pp=173-185}} noted that the English cases did not correspond to the traditional Latin based system, some contemporary grammars, for example {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002}}, retain traditional labels for the cases, calling them nominative and accusative cases respectively.

Possessive pronouns exist in dependent and independent forms; the dependent form functions as a determiner specifying a noun (as in ''my chair''), while the independent form can stand alone as if it were a noun (e.g. ''the chair is mine'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=425–26}} The English system of grammatical person no longer has a distinction between formal and informal pronouns of address (the old 2nd person singular familiar pronoun ''[[thou]]'' acquired a pejorative or inferior tinge of meaning and was abandoned), and the forms for 2nd person plural and singular are identical except in the reflexive form. Some dialects have introduced innovative 2nd person plural pronouns such as ''y'all'' found in [[Southern American English]] and [[African American Vernacular English|African American (Vernacular) English]] or ''youse'' and ''ye'' found in Irish English.

Pronouns are used to refer to entities [[Deixis|deictically]] or [[Anaphoric reference|anaphorically]]. A deictic pronoun points to some person or object by identifying it relative to the speech situation—for example, the pronoun ''I'' identifies the speaker, and the pronoun ''you'', the addressee. Anaphorical pronouns such as ''that'' refer back to an entity already mentioned or assumed by the speaker to be known by the audience, for example in the sentence ''I already told you that''. The reflexive pronouns are used when the oblique argument is identical to the subject of a phrase (e.g. "he sent it to himself" or "she braced herself for impact").{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=426}}

==== Prepositions ====

Prepositional phrases (PP) are phrases composed of a preposition and one or more nouns, e.g. ''with the dog'', ''for my friend'', ''to school'', ''in England''. Prepositions have a wide range of uses in English. They are used to describe movement, place, and other relations between different entities, but they also have many syntactic uses such as introducing complement clauses and oblique arguments of verbs. For example, in the phrase ''I gave it to him'', the preposition ''to'' marks the recipient, or Indirect Object of the verb ''to give''. Traditionally words were only considered prepositions if they governed the case of the noun they preceded, for example causing the pronouns to use the objective rather than subjective form, "with her", "to me", "for us". But some contemporary grammars such as that of {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=598–600}} no longer consider government of case to be the defining feature of the class of prepositions, rather defining prepositions as words that can function as the heads of prepositional phrases.

=== Verbs and verb phrases ===

English verbs are inflected for tense and aspect and marked for agreement with present-tense third-person singular subject. Only the copula verb ''to be'' is still inflected for agreement with the plural and first and second person subjects.{{sfn|König|1994|page=540}} Auxiliary verbs such as ''have'' and ''be'' are paired with verbs in the infinitive, past, or progressive forms. They form [[periphrasis|complex]] tenses, aspects, and moods. Auxiliary verbs differ from other verbs in that they can be followed by the negation, and in that they can occur as the first constituent in a question sentence.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51}}{{sfn|König|1994|page=541}}

Most verbs have six inflectional forms. The primary forms are a plain present, a third-person singular present, and a preterite (past) form. The secondary forms are a plain form used for the infinitive, a gerund-participle and a past participle.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=50}} The copula verb ''to be'' is the only verb to retain some of its original conjugation, and takes different inflectional forms depending on the subject. The first-person present-tense form is ''am'', the third person singular form ''is'' and the form ''are'' is used second-person singular and all three plurals. The only verb past participle is ''been'' and its gerund-participle is ''being''.

==== Tense, aspect and mood ====

English has two primary tenses, past (preterit) and non-past. The preterit is inflected by using the preterit form of the verb, which for the regular verbs includes the suffix ''-ed'', and for the strong verbs either the suffix ''-t'' or a change in the stem vowel. The non-past form is unmarked except in the third person singular, which takes the suffix ''-s''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51}}

English does not have a morphologised future tense.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=208–210}} Futurity of action is expressed periphrastically with one of the auxiliary verbs ''will'' or ''shall''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51–52}} Many varieties also use a near future constructed with the phrasal verb ''be going to''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=210–11}}

Further aspectual distinctions are encoded by the use of auxiliary verbs, primarily ''have'' and ''be'', which encode the contrast between a perfect and non-perfect past tense (''I have run'' vs. ''I was running''), and compound tenses such as preterite perfect (''I had been running'') and present perfect (''I have been running'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=50–51}}

For the expression of mood, English uses a number of modal auxiliaries, such as ''can'', ''may'', ''will'', ''shall'' and the past tense forms ''could'', ''might'', ''would'', ''should''. There is also a subjunctive and an imperative mood, both based on the plain form of the verb (i.e. without the third person singular ''-s''), and which is used in subordinate clauses (e.g. subjunctive: ''It is important that he run every day''; imperative ''Run!'').{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=51–52}}

An infinitive form, that uses the plain form of the verb and the preposition ''to'', is used for verbal clauses that are syntactically subordinate to a finite verbal clause. Finite verbal clauses are those that are formed around a verb in the present or preterit form. In clauses with auxiliary verbs, they are the finite verbs and the main verb is treated as a subordinate clause. For example, ''he has to go'' where only the auxiliary verb ''have'' is inflected for time and the main verb ''to go'' is in the infinitive, or in a complement clause such as ''I saw him leave'', where the main verb is ''to see'' which is in a preterite form, and ''leave'' is in the infinitive.

==== Phrasal verbs ====

English also makes frequent use of constructions traditionally called [[phrasal verb]]s, verb phrases that are made up of a verb root and a preposition or particle which follows the verb. The phrase then functions as a single predicate. In terms of intonation the preposition is fused to the verb, but in writing it is written as a separate word. Examples of phrasal verbs are ''to get up'', ''to ask out'', ''to back up'', ''to give up'', ''to get together'', ''to hang out'', ''to put up with'', etc. The phrasal verb frequently has a highly [[English-language idioms|idiomatic]] meaning that is more specialised and restricted than what can be simply extrapolated from the combination of verb and preposition complement (e.g. ''lay off'' meaning ''terminate someone's employment'').{{sfn|Dixon|1982}} In spite of the idiomatic meaning, some grammarians, including {{harvcoltxt|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=274}}, do not consider this type of construction to form a syntactic constituent and hence refrain from using the term "phrasal verb". Instead, they consider the construction simply to be a verb with a prepositional phrase as its syntactic complement, i.e. ''he woke up in the morning'' and ''he ran up in the mountains'' are syntactically equivalent.

==== Adverbs ====

The function of adverbs is to modify the action or event described by the verb by providing additional information about the manner in which it occurs. Many adverbs are derived from adjectives with the suffix ''-ly'', but not all, and many speakers tend to omit the suffix in the most commonly used adverbs. For example, in the phrase ''the woman walked quickly'' the adverb ''quickly'' derived from the adjective ''quick'' describes the woman's way of walking. Some commonly used adjectives have irregular adverbial forms, such as ''good'' which has the adverbial form ''well''.

=== Syntax ===

[[File:Constituent structure analysis English sentence.svg|right|thumb|In the English sentence ''The cat sat on the mat'', the subject is ''the cat'' (a NP), the verb is ''sat'', and ''on the mat'' is a prepositional phrase (composed of an NP ''the mat'', and headed by the preposition ''on''). The tree describes the structure of the sentence.]]

Modern English syntax language is moderately [[Isolating language|analytic]].{{sfn|McArthur|1992|pp=64, 610–611}} It has developed features such as [[English modal verb|modal verbs]] and [[word order]] as resources for conveying meaning. [[Auxiliary verb]]s mark constructions such as questions, negative polarity, the [[Grammatical voice|passive voice]] and progressive [[grammatical aspect|aspect]].

==== Basic constituent order ====

English word order has moved from the Germanic [[V2 word order|verb-second (V2) word order]] to being almost exclusively [[subject–verb–object]] (SVO).{{sfn|König|1994|page=553}} The combination of SVO order and use of auxiliary verbs often creates clusters of two or more verbs at the centre of the sentence, such as ''he had hoped to try to open it''.

In most sentences, English only marks grammatical relations through word order.{{sfn|König|1994|page=550}} The subject constituent precedes the verb and the object constituent follows it. The example below demonstrates how the grammatical roles of each constituent is marked only by the position relative to the verb:

{| style="text-align: center;"
|-
| ''The dog'' || ''bites'' || ''the man''
|-
| S || V || O
|-
| ''The man'' || ''bites'' || ''the dog''
|-
| S || V || O
|}

An exception is found in sentences where one of the constituents is a pronoun, in which case it is doubly marked, both by word order and by case inflection, where the subject pronoun precedes the verb and takes the subjective case form, and the object pronoun follows the verb and takes the objective case form. The example below demonstrates this double marking in a sentence where both object and subject is represented with a third person singular masculine pronoun:

{| style="text-align: center;"
|-
| ''He'' || ''hit'' || ''him''
|-
| S || V || O
|}

[[Indirect object]]s (IO) of ditransitive verbs can be placed either as the first object in a double object construction (S V IO O), such as ''I gave &lt;u&gt;Jane&lt;/u&gt; the book'' or in a prepositional phrase, such as ''I gave the book &lt;u&gt;to Jane&lt;/u&gt;'' {{sfn|König|1994|page=551}}

==== Clause syntax ====
{{Main|English clause syntax}}

In English a sentence may be composed of one or more clauses, that may, in turn, be composed of one or more phrases (e.g. Noun Phrases, Verb Phrases, and Prepositional Phrases). A clause is built around a verb and includes its constituents, such as any NPs and PPs. Within a sentence, one clause is always the main clause (or matrix clause) whereas other clauses are subordinate to it. Subordinate clauses may function as arguments of the verb in the main clause. For example, in the phrase ''I think (that) you are lying'', the main clause is headed by the verb ''think'', the subject is ''I'', but the object of the phrase is the subordinate clause ''(that) you are lying''. The subordinating conjunction ''that'' shows that the clause that follows is a subordinate clause, but it is often omitted.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pages=60–69}} [[Relative clause]]s are clauses that function as a modifier or specifier to some constituent in the main clause: For example, in the sentence ''I saw the letter that you received today'', the relative clause ''that you received today'' specifies the meaning of the word ''letter'', the object of the main clause. Relative clauses can be introduced by the pronouns ''who'', ''whose'', ''whom'' and ''which'' as well as by ''that'' (which can also be omitted.){{sfn|König|1994|page=545}} In contrast to many other Germanic languages there is no major differences between word order in main and subordinate clauses.{{sfn|König|1994|page=557}}

==== Auxiliary verb constructions ====
{{Main|Do-support|Subject–auxiliary inversion}}

English syntax relies on auxiliary verbs for many functions including the expression of tense, aspect, and mood. Auxiliary verbs form main clauses, and the main verbs function as heads of a subordinate clause of the auxiliary verb. For example, in the sentence ''the dog did not find its bone'', the clause ''find its bone'' is the complement of the negated verb ''did not''. [[Subject–auxiliary inversion]] is used in many constructions, including focus, negation, and interrogative constructions.

The verb ''do'' can be used as an auxiliary even in simple declarative sentences, where it usually serves to add emphasis, as in "I ''did'' shut the fridge." However, in the negated and inverted clauses referred to above, it is used because the rules of English [[syntax]] permit these constructions only when an auxiliary is present. [[Modern English]] does not allow the addition of the negating adverb ''not'' to an ordinary [[finite verb|finite]] lexical verb, as in ''*I know not''—it can only be added to an auxiliary (or [[copular verb|copular]]) verb, hence if there is no other auxiliary present when negation is required, the auxiliary ''do'' is used, to produce a form like ''I do not (don't) know.'' The same applies in clauses requiring inversion, including most questions—inversion must involve the subject and an auxiliary verb, so it is not possible to say ''*Know you him?''; grammatical rules require ''Do you know him?''{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=114}}

Negation is done with the adverb ''not'', which precedes the main verb and follows an auxiliary verb. A contracted form of not ''-n't'' can be used as an enclitic attaching to auxiliary verbs and to the copula verb ''to be''. Just as with questions, many negative constructions require the negation to occur with do-support, thus in Modern English ''I don't know him'' is the correct answer to the question ''Do you know him?'', but not ''*I know him not'', although this construction may be found in older English.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=786–790}}

Passive constructions also use auxiliary verbs. A passive construction rephrases an active construction in such a way that the object of the active phrase becomes the subject of the passive phrase, and the subject of the active phrase is either omitted or demoted to a role as an oblique argument introduced in a prepositional phrase. They are formed by using the past participle either with the auxiliary verb ''to be'' or ''to get'', although not all varieties of English allow the use of passives with ''get''. For example, putting the sentence ''she sees him'' into the passive becomes ''he is seen (by her)'', or ''he gets seen (by her)''.{{sfn|Miller|2002|pages=26–27}}

==== Questions ====

Both [[yes–no question]]s and [[wh-question|''wh''-questions]] in English are mostly formed using [[subject–auxiliary inversion]] (''Am I going tomorrow?'', ''Where can we eat?''), which may require [[do-support|''do''-support]] (''Do you like her?'', ''Where did he go?''). In most cases, [[interrogative word]]s (''wh''-words; e.g. ''what'', ''who'', ''where'', ''when'', ''why'', ''how'') appear in a [[Wh-movement|fronted position]]. For example, in the question ''What did you see?'', the word ''what'' appears as the first constituent despite being the [[grammatical object]] of the sentence. (When the ''wh''-word is the subject or forms part of the subject, no inversion occurs: ''Who saw the cat?''.) [[Prepositional phrases]] can also be fronted when they are the question's theme, e.g. ''To whose house did you go last night?''. The personal interrogative pronoun ''[[who (pronoun)|who]]'' is the only interrogative pronoun to still show inflection for case, with the variant ''whom'' serving as the objective case form, although this form may be going out of use in many contexts.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pp=7-8}}

==== Discourse level syntax ====
While English is a subject-prominent language, at the discourse level it tends to use a [[Topic and comment|topic-comment]] structure, where the known information (topic) precedes the new information (comment). Because of the strict SVO syntax, the topic of a sentence generally has to be the grammatical subject of the sentence. In cases where the topic is not the grammatical subject of the sentence, frequently the topic is promoted to subject position through syntactic means. One way of doing this is through a passive construction, ''the girl was stung by the bee''. Another way is through a [[cleft sentence]] where the main clause is demoted to be a complement clause of a copula sentence with a [[dummy subject]] such as ''it'' or ''there'', e.g. ''it was the girl that the bee stung'', ''there was a girl who was stung by a bee''.{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|pages=1365–70}} Dummy subjects are also used in constructions where there is no grammatical subject such as with impersonal verbs (e.g., ''it is raining'') or in existential clauses (''there are many cars on the street''). Through the use of these complex sentence constructions with informationally vacuous subjects, English is able to maintain both a topic-comment sentence structure and a SVO syntax.

[[Focus (linguistics)|Focus constructions]] emphasise a particular piece of new or salient information within a sentence, generally through allocating the main sentence level stress on the focal constituent. For example, ''the girl was stung by &lt;u&gt;a bee&lt;/u&gt;'' (emphasising it was a bee and not, for example, a wasp that stung her), or ''&lt;u&gt;The girl&lt;/u&gt; was stung by a bee'' (contrasting with another possibility, for example that it was the boy).{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=1370}} Topic and focus can also be established through syntactic dislocation, either preposing or postposing the item to be focused on relative to the main clause. For example, ''That girl over there, she was stung by a bee'', emphasises the girl by preposition, but a similar effect could be achieved by postposition, ''she was stung by a bee, that girl over there'', where reference to the girl is established as an "afterthought".{{sfn|Huddleston|Pullum|2002|page=1366}}

[[Cohesion (linguistics)|Cohesion]] between sentences is achieved through the use of deictic pronouns as [[anaphora (linguistics)|anaphora]] (e.g. ''that is exactly what I mean'' where ''that'' refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or ''then'' used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event).{{sfn|Halliday|Hasan|1976}} [[Discourse marker]]s such as ''oh'', ''so'' or ''well'', also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for [[Stance (linguistics)|stance taking]] in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, ''no way is that true!'' (the idiomatic marker ''no way!'' expressing disbelief), or ''boy! I'm hungry'' (the marker ''boy'' expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used in written and formal registers.{{sfn|Schiffrin|1988}}

== Vocabulary ==
{{See also|Foreign language influences in English}}
English is a rich language in terms of vocabulary, containing more [[synonyms]] than any other language.{{sfn|Jambor|2007}} There are words which appear on the surface to mean exactly the same thing but which, in fact, have slightly different shades of meaning and must be chosen appropriately if a speaker wants to convey precisely the message intended. It is generally stated that English has around 170,000 words, or 220,000 if [[obsolete word]]s are counted; this estimate is based on the last full edition of the ''Oxford English Dictionary'' from 1989.&lt;ref&gt;[https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/explore/how-many-words-are-there-in-the-english-language "How many words are there in the English language?"], Oxford Dictionaries&lt;/ref&gt; Over half of these words are nouns, a quarter adjectives, and a seventh verbs. There is one count that puts the English vocabulary at about 1 million words—but that count presumably includes words such as Latin [[species name]]s, [[scientific terminology]], [[botanical terms]], [[prefix]]ed and [[suffix]]ed words, [[jargon]], foreign words of extremely limited English use, and technical [[acronym]]s.{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}

Due to its status as an international language, English adopts foreign words quickly, and borrows vocabulary from many other sources. Early studies of English vocabulary by [[Lexicography|lexicographers]], the scholars who formally study vocabulary, compile dictionaries, or both, were impeded by a lack of comprehensive data on actual vocabulary in use from good-quality [[Corpus linguistics|linguistic corpora]],{{sfn|Leech|Hundt|Mair|Smith|2009|pp=24–50}} collections of actual written texts and spoken passages. Many statements published before the end of the 20th century about the growth of English vocabulary over time, the dates of first use of various words in English, and the sources of English vocabulary will have to be corrected as new computerised analysis of linguistic corpus data becomes available.{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}}

=== Word formation processes ===
English forms new words from existing words or roots in its vocabulary through a variety of processes. One of the most productive processes in English is conversion,{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=129}} using a word with a different grammatical role, for example using a noun as a verb or a verb as a noun. Another productive word-formation process is nominal compounding,{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}} producing compound words such as ''babysitter'' or ''ice cream'' or ''homesick''.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=129}} A process more common in Old English than in Modern English, but still productive in Modern English, is the use of derivational suffixes (''-hood'', ''-ness'', ''-ing'', ''-ility'') to derive new words from existing words (especially those of Germanic origin) or stems (especially for words of [[List of Latin words with English derivatives|Latin]] or [[English words of Greek origin|Greek origin]]).

Formation of new words, called [[neologisms]], based on Greek and/or Latin roots (for example ''television'' or ''optometry'') is a highly productive process in English and in most modern European languages, so much so that it is often difficult to determine in which language a neologism originated. For this reason, lexicographer Philip Gove attributed many such words to the "[[international scientific vocabulary]]" (ISV) when compiling ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' (1961). Another active word-formation process in English is acronyms,{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=120–121}} words formed by pronouncing as a single word abbreviations of longer phrases (e.g. ''NATO'', ''laser'').

=== Word origins ===
{{Main|Lists of English loanwords by country or language of origin}}
[[File:Origins of English PieChart.svg|thumb|right|Source languages of English vocabulary&lt;ref name="Wolff"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/0029344700 |title=Joseph M. Willams, Origins of the English Language at |publisher=Amazon.com |accessdate=2010-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

English, besides forming new words from existing words and their roots, also borrows words from other languages. This adoption of words from other languages is commonplace in many world languages, but English has been especially open to borrowing of foreign words throughout the last 1,000 years.{{sfn|Denning|Kessler|Leben|2007|p=7}} The most commonly used words in English are West Germanic.{{sfn|Nation|2001|p=265}} The words in English learned first by children as they learn to speak, particularly the grammatical words that dominate the word count of both spoken and written texts, are mainly the Germanic words inherited from the earliest periods of the development of Old English.{{sfn|Algeo|1999}}

But one of the consequences of long language contact between French and English in all stages of their development is that the vocabulary of English has a very high percentage of "Latinate" words (derived from French, especially, and also from Latin and other Romance languages). French words from various periods of the development of French now make up one-third of the vocabulary of English.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=196}} Words of Old Norse origin have entered the English language primarily from the contact between Old Norse and Old English during colonisation of eastern and [[northern England]]. Many of these words are part of English core vocabulary, such as ''egg'' and ''knife''.{{sfn|Denning|Kessler|Leben|2007}}

English has also borrowed many words directly from Latin, the ancestor of the Romance languages, during all stages of its development.{{sfn|Kastovsky|2006}}{{sfn|Algeo|1999}} Many of these words had earlier been borrowed into Latin from Greek. Latin or Greek are still highly productive sources of stems used to form vocabulary of subjects learned in higher education such as the sciences, philosophy, and mathematics.{{sfn|Romaine|1999|p=4}} English continues to gain new loanwords and [[calques]] ("loan translations") from languages all over the world, and words from languages other than the ancestral Anglo-Saxon language make up about 60% of the vocabulary of English.{{sfn|Fasold|Connor-Linton|2014|p=302}}

English has formal and informal [[Register (sociolinguistics)|speech registers]]; informal registers, including child-directed speech, tend to be made up predominantly of words of Anglo-Saxon origin, while the percentage of vocabulary that is of Latinate origin is higher in legal, scientific, and academic texts.{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|pp=124–127}}{{sfn|Algeo|1999|pp=80–81}}

=== English loanwords and calques in other languages ===
English has a strong influence on the vocabulary of other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=196}}{{sfn|Brutt-Griffler|2006|p=692}} The influence of English comes from such factors as opinion leaders in other countries knowing the English language, the role of English as a world lingua franca, and the large number of books and films that are translated from English into other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=197}} That pervasive use of English leads to a conclusion in many places that English is an especially suitable language for expressing new ideas or describing new technologies. Among varieties of English, it is especially American English that influences other languages.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=198}} Some languages, such as Chinese, write words borrowed from English mostly as [[calque]]s, while others, such as Japanese, readily take in English loanwords written in sound-indicating script.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=202}} Dubbed films and television programmes are an especially fruitful source of English influence on languages in Europe.{{sfn|Gottlieb|2006|p=202}}

== Writing system ==
{{See also|English alphabet|English braille|English orthography}}

Since the ninth century, English has been written in a [[Latin alphabet]] (also called Roman alphabet). Earlier Old English texts in [[Anglo-Saxon runes]] are only short inscriptions. The great majority of literary works in Old English that survive to today are written in the Roman alphabet.{{sfn|Gneuss|2013|p=23}} The modern English alphabet contains 26 letters of the [[Latin script]]: [[a]], [[b]], [[c]], [[d]], [[e]], [[f]], [[g]], [[h]], [[i]], [[j]], [[k]], [[l]], [[m]], [[n]], [[o]], [[p]], [[q]], [[r]], [[s]], [[t]], [[u]], [[v]], [[w]], [[x]], [[y]], [[z]] (which also have [[Letter case|capital]] forms: A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I, J, K, L, M, N, O, P, Q, R, S, T, U, V, W, X, Y, Z).

The spelling system, or [[orthography]], of English is multi-layered, with elements of French, Latin, and Greek spelling on top of the native Germanic system.{{sfn|Swan|2006|p=149}} Further complications have arisen through [[sound change]]s with which the orthography has not kept pace.{{sfn|Lass|2000}} Compared to European languages for which official organisations have promoted spelling reforms, English has spelling that is a less consistent indicator of pronunciation, and standard spellings of words that are more difficult to guess from knowing how a word is pronounced.{{sfn|Mountford|2006}} There are also systematic [[American and British English spelling differences|spelling differences between British and American English]]. These situations have prompted proposals for spelling reform in English.{{sfn|Neijt|2006}}

Although letters and speech sounds do not have a one-to-one correspondence in standard English spelling, spelling rules that take into account syllable structure, phonetic changes in derived words, and word accent are reliable for most English words.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} Moreover, standard English spelling shows etymological relationships between related words that would be obscured by a closer correspondence between pronunciation and spelling, for example the words ''photograph'', ''photography'', and ''photographic'',{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} or the words ''electricity'' and ''electrical''. While few scholars agree with Chomsky and Halle (1968) that conventional English orthography is "near-optimal",{{sfn|Swan|2006|p=149}} there is a rationale for current English spelling patterns.{{sfn|Abercrombie|Daniels|2006}} The standard orthography of English is the most widely used writing system in the world.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|p=156}} Standard English spelling is based on a graphomorphemic segmentation of words into written clues of what meaningful units make up each word.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|pp=157–158}}

Readers of English can generally rely on the correspondence between spelling and pronunciation to be fairly regular for letters or [[Digraph (orthography)|digraphs]] used to spell consonant sounds. The letters ''b'', ''d'', ''f'', ''h'', ''j'', ''k'', ''l'', ''m'', ''n'', ''p'', ''r'', ''s'', ''t'', ''v'', ''w'', ''y'', ''z'' represent, respectively, the phonemes {{IPA|/b, d, f, h, dʒ, k, l, m, n, p, r, s, t, v, w, j, z/}}. The letters ''c'' and ''g'' normally represent {{IPA|/k/}} and {{IPA|/ɡ/}}, but there is also a [[soft c|soft ''c'']] pronounced {{IPA|/s/}}, and a [[Hard and soft G|soft ''g'']] pronounced {{IPA|/dʒ/}}. The differences in the pronunciations of the letters ''c'' and ''g'' are often signalled by the following letters in standard English spelling. Digraphs used to represent phonemes and phoneme sequences include ''ch'' for {{IPA|/tʃ/}}, ''sh'' for {{IPA|/ʃ/}}, ''th'' for {{IPA|/θ/}} or {{IPA|/ð/}}, ''ng'' for {{IPA|/ŋ/}}, ''qu'' for {{IPA|/kw/}}, and ''ph'' for {{IPA|/f/}} in Greek-derived words. The single letter ''x'' is generally pronounced as {{IPA|/z/}} in word-initial position and as {{IPA|/ks/}} otherwise. There are exceptions to these generalisations, often the result of loanwords being spelled according to the spelling patterns of their languages of origin{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} or proposals by pedantic scholars in the early period of Modern English to mistakenly follow the spelling patterns of Latin for English words of Germanic origin.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=654}}

For the vowel sounds of the English language, however, correspondences between spelling and pronunciation are more irregular. There are many more vowel phonemes in English than there are single vowel letters (''a'', ''e'', ''i'', ''o'', ''u'', ''w'', ''y''). As a result, some "[[Vowel length#Short and long vowels in English|long vowels]]" are often indicated by combinations of letters (like the ''oa'' in ''boat'', the ''ow'' in ''how'', and the ''ay'' in ''stay''), or the historically based [[silent e|silent ''e'']] (as in ''note'' and ''cake'').{{sfn|Abercrombie|Daniels|2006}}

The consequence of this complex orthographic history is that learning to read can be challenging in English. It can take longer for school pupils to become independently fluent readers of English than of many other languages, including Italian, Spanish, and German.{{sfn|Dehaene|2009}} Nonetheless, there is an advantage for learners of English reading in learning the specific sound-symbol regularities that occur in the standard English spellings of commonly used words.{{sfn|Daniels|Bright|1996|p=653}} Such instruction greatly reduces the risk of children experiencing reading difficulties in English.{{sfn|McGuinness|1997}}{{sfn|Shaywitz|2003}} Making primary school teachers more aware of the primacy of morpheme representation in English may help learners learn more efficiently to read and write English.{{sfn|Mountford|2006|pp=159}}

English writing also includes a system of [[punctuation]] marks that is similar to those used in most alphabetic languages around the world. The purpose of punctuation is to mark meaningful grammatical relationships in sentences to aid readers in understanding a text and to indicate features important for reading a text aloud.{{sfn|Lawler|2006|p=290}}

== Dialects, accents, and varieties ==
{{Main|List of dialects of the English language|World Englishes|regional accents of English}}

Dialectologists identify many [[List of dialects of the English language|English dialects]], which usually refer to regional varieties that differ from each other in terms of patterns of grammar, vocabulary, and pronunciation. The pronunciation of particular areas distinguishes dialects as separate [[Regional accents of English|regional accents]]. The major native dialects of English are often divided by linguists into the two extremely general categories of [[British English]] (BrE) and [[North American English]] (NAE).{{sfn|Crystal|2003b|p=107}} There also exists a third common major grouping of English varieties: Southern Hemisphere English, the most prominent being [[Australian English|Australian]] and [[New Zealand English]].

[[File:Dialects of English in UK and Ireland.svg|thumb|left|Map showing the main dialect regions in the UK and Ireland]]

As the place where English first evolved, the British Isles, and particularly England, are home to the most diverse dialects. Within the United Kingdom, the [[Received Pronunciation]] (RP), an educated dialect of [[South East England]], is traditionally used as the broadcast standard and is considered the most prestigious of the British dialects. The spread of RP (also known as BBC English) through the media has caused many traditional dialects of rural England to recede, as youths adopt the traits of the prestige variety instead of traits from local dialects. At the time of the [[Survey of English Dialects]], grammar and vocabulary differed across the country, but a process of lexical attrition has led most of this variation to disappear.{{sfn|Trudgill|1999|p=125}}

Nonetheless this attrition has mostly affected dialectal variation in grammar and vocabulary, and in fact, only 3 percent of the English population actually speak RP, the remainder speaking regional accents and dialects with varying degrees of RP influence.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=3}} There is also variability within RP, particularly along class lines between Upper and Middle-class RP speakers and between native RP speakers and speakers who adopt RP later in life.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=37}} Within Britain, there is also considerable variation along lines of social class, and some traits though exceedingly common are considered "non-standard" and are associated with lower class speakers and identities. An example of this is [[H-dropping]], which was historically a feature of lower-class London English, particularly Cockney, and can now be heard in the local accents of most parts of England—yet it remains largely absent in broadcasting and among the upper crust of British society.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|page=40}}

[[English language in England|English in England]] can be divided into four major dialect regions, [[West Country dialects|Southwest English]], South East English, Midlands English, and [[Northern England English|Northern English]]. Within each of these regions several local subdialects exist: Within the Northern region, there is a division between the Yorkshire dialects, and the [[Geordie]] dialect spoken in Northumbria around Newcastle, and the Lancashire dialects with local urban dialects in [[Liverpool]] ([[Scouse]]) and [[Manchester]] ([[Manchester dialect|Mancunian]]). Having been the centre of Danish occupation during the Viking Invasions, Northern English dialects, particularly the Yorkshire dialect, retain Norse features not found in other English varieties.{{sfn|Hughes|Trudgill|1996|p=31}}

Since the 15th century, southeastern England varieties centred around London, which has been the centre from which dialectal innovations have spread to other dialects. In London, the [[Cockney]] dialect was traditionally used by the lower classes, and it was long a socially stigmatised variety. The spread of Cockney features across the south-east led the media to talk of Estuary English as a new dialect, but the notion was criticised by many linguists on the grounds that London had influencing neighbouring regions throughout history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phon.ucl.ac.uk/home/estuary/ee-faqs-jcw.htm |title=Estuary English Q and A - JCW |publisher=Phon.ucl.ac.uk |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Roach|2009|p=4}}{{sfn|Trudgill|1999|p=80}} Traits that have spread from London in recent decades include the use of [[Linking and intrusive R|intrusive R]] (''drawing'' is pronounced ''drawring'' {{IPA|/ˈdrɔːrɪŋ/}}), [[t-glottalization|''t''-glottalisation]] (''Potter'' is pronounced with a glottal stop as ''Po'er'' {{IPA|/poʔʌ/}}), and the pronunciation of ''th-'' as {{IPA|/f/}} (''thanks'' pronounced ''fanks'') or {{IPA|/v/}} (''bother'' pronounced ''bover''). {{sfn|Trudgill|1999|pages=80–81}}

[[Scots language|Scots]] is today considered a separate language from English, but it has [[History of the Scots language|its origins]] in early Northern Middle English{{sfn|Aitken|McArthur|1979|page=81}} and developed and changed during its history with influence from other sources, particularly [[Scottish Gaelic|Scots Gaelic]] and Old Norse. Scots itself has a number of regional dialects. And in addition to Scots, [[Scottish English]] are the varieties of Standard English spoken in Scotland, most varieties are Northern English accents, with some influence from Scots.{{sfn|Romaine|1982}}

In [[Ireland]], various forms of English have been spoken since the [[Norman invasion of Ireland|Norman invasions]] of the 11th century. In [[County Wexford]], in the area surrounding [[Dublin]], two extinct dialects known as [[Forth and Bargy dialect|Forth and Bargy]] and [[Fingallian]] developed as offshoots from Early Middle English, and were spoken until the 19th century. Modern [[Hiberno-English|Irish English]], however, has its roots in English colonisation in the 17th century. Today Irish English is divided into [[Ulster English]], the Northern Ireland dialect with strong influence from Scots, as well as various dialects of the Republic of Ireland. Like Scottish and most North American accents, almost all Irish accents preserve the [[Rhoticity in English|rhoticity]] which has been lost in the dialects influenced by RP.{{sfn|Barry|1982|pp=86–87}}{{sfn|Hickey|2007}}

Non-rhotic [[African American Vernacular English]] pronunciations may be found among [[African Americans]] regardless of location.]]

North American English is fairly homogeneous compared to British English. Today, American accent variation is often increasing at the regional level and decreasing at the very local level,{{sfn|Labov|2012}} though most Americans still speak within a phonological continuum of similar accents,{{sfn|Wells|1982|page=34}} known collectively as [[General American]] (GA), with differences hardly noticed even among Americans themselves (such as [[Midland American English|Midland]] and [[Western American English]]).{{sfn|Rowicka|2006}}{{sfn|Toon|1982}}{{sfn|Cassidy|1982}} In most American and Canadian English dialects, [[rhoticity in English|rhoticity]] (or ''r''-fulness) is dominant, with non-rhoticity (''r''-dropping) becoming associated with lower prestige and social class especially after World War II; this contrasts with the situation in England, where non-rhoticity has become the standard.{{sfn|Labov|1972}}

Separate from GA are American dialects with clearly distinct sound systems, historically including [[Southern American English]], English of the coastal Northeast (famously including [[Eastern New England English]] and [[New York City English]]), and [[African American Vernacular English]], all of which are historically non-rhotic. [[Canadian English]], except for the [[Atlantic provinces]] and perhaps [[Quebec]], may be classified under GA as well, but it often shows the [[Canadian raising|raising of the vowels]] {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} and {{IPAc-en|aʊ}} before [[voiceless consonants]], as well as distinct norms for written and pronunciation standards.{{sfn|Boberg|2010}}

In [[Southern American English]], the most populous American "accent group" outside of GA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/speak/ahead/|title=Do You Speak American: What Lies Ahead|accessdate=15 August 2007|publisher=[[PBS]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; rhoticity now strongly prevails, replacing the region's [[older Southern American English|historical non-rhotic prestige]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Rural White Southern Accents|first=Erik R.|last=Thomas|publisher=[[Mouton de Gruyter]]|work=Atlas of North American English (online)|year=2003|postscript=.

Today spoken primarily by working- and middle-class [[African Americans]], [[African-American Vernacular English]] (AAVE) is also largely non-rhotic and likely originated among enslaved Africans and African Americans influenced primarily by the non-rhotic, non-standard [[older Southern American English|older Southern dialects]]. A minority of linguists,&lt;ref name="Word on the Street"&gt;{{cite book|title=Word on the Street: Debunking the Myth of a "Pure" Standard English|last=McWhorter|first=John H.|authorlink=John McWhorter|publisher=Basic Books|year=2001|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Edt7yUD6PkMC|page=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; contrarily, propose that AAVE mostly traces back to African languages spoken by the slaves who had to develop a [[pidgin]] or [[Creole English]] to communicate with slaves of other ethnic and linguistic origins.{{sfn|Bailey|2001}} AAVE's important commonalities with Southern accents suggests it developed into a highly coherent and homogeneous variety in the 19th or early 20th century. AAVE is commonly stigmatised in North America as a form of "broken" or "uneducated" English, as are white Southern accents, but linguists today recognise both as fully developed varieties of English with their own norms shared by a large speech community.{{sfn|Green|2002}}{{sfn|Patrick|2006b}}

Since 1788, English has been spoken in [[Oceania]], and [[Australian English]] has developed as a first language of the vast majority of the inhabitants of the Australian continent, its standard accent being [[General Australian]]. The [[New Zealand English|English of neighbouring New Zealand]] has to a lesser degree become an influential standard variety of the language.{{sfn|Eagleson|1982}} Australian and New Zealand English are each other's closest relatives with few differentiating characteristics, followed by [[South African English]] and the English of southeastern England, all of which have similarly non-rhotic accents, aside from some accents in the [[South Island]] of New Zealand. Australian and New Zealand English stand out for their innovative vowels: many short vowels are fronted or raised, whereas many long vowels have diphthongised. Australian English also has a contrast between long and short vowels, not found in most other varieties. Australian English grammar aligns closely to British and American English; like American English, collective plural subjects take on a singular verb (as in ''the government is'' rather than ''are'').{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=16–21}}{{sfn|Burridge|2010}} New Zealand English uses front vowels that are often even higher than in Australian English.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=24–26}}{{sfn|Maclagan|2010}}{{sfn|Gordon|Campbell|Hay et al.|2004}}

English is spoken widely in South Africa and is an official or co-official language in several countries. In [[South Africa]], English has been spoken since 1820, co-existing with [[Afrikaans language|Afrikaans]] and various African languages such as the [[Khoe languages|Khoe]] and [[Bantu languages]]. Today about 9 percent of the South African population speak [[South African English]] (SAE) as a first language. SAE is a non-rhotic variety, which tends to follow RP as a norm. It is alone among non-rhotic varieties in lacking intrusive r. There are different L2 varieties that differ based on the native language of the speakers.{{sfn|Lanham|1982}} Most phonological differences from RP are in the vowels.{{sfn|Lass|2002}} Consonant differences include the tendency to pronounce /p, t, t͡ʃ, k/ without aspiration (e.g. ''pin'' pronounced {{IPA|[pɪn]}} rather than as {{IPA|[pʰɪn]}} as in most other varieties), while r is often pronounced as a flap {{IPA|[ɾ]}} instead of as the more common fricative.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=30–31}}

Nigerian English is a [[List of dialects of the English language|dialect of English]] spoken in [[Nigeria]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861683342/Nigerian_English.html|title=Nigerian English|work=Encarta|publisher=Microsoft|accessdate=17 July 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100909162439/http://encarta.msn.com/dictionary_1861683342/Nigerian_English.html|archivedate=9 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is based on British English, but in recent years, because of influence from the United States, some words of American English origin have made it into Nigerian English. Additionally, some new words and collocations have emerged from the language, which come from the need to express concepts specific to the culture of the nation (e.g. ''senior wife''). Over 150 million population of Nigerians speak English.&lt;ref&gt;Adegbija, Efurosebina. (1989) "Lexico-semantic variation in Nigerian English", ''World Englishes'', 8(2), 165–177.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several varieties of English are also spoken in the Caribbean Islands that were colonial possessions of Britain, including Jamaica, and the [[Leeward Islands|Leeward]] and [[Windward Islands]] and [[Trinidad and Tobago]], [[Barbados]], the [[Cayman Islands]], and [[Belize]]. Each of these areas are home both to a local variety of English and a local English based creole, combining English and African languages. The most prominent varieties are [[Jamaican English]] and [[Jamaican English Creole|Jamaican Creole]]. In Central America, English based creoles are spoken in on the Caribbean coasts of Nicaragua and Panama.{{sfn|Lawton|1982}} Locals are often fluent both in the local English variety and the local creole languages and [[code-switching]] between them is frequent, indeed another way to conceptualise the relationship between Creole and Standard varieties is to see a spectrum of social registers with the Creole forms serving as "basilect" and the more RP-like forms serving as the "acrolect", the most formal register.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|page=115}}

Most Caribbean varieties are based on British English and consequently, most are non-rhotic, except for formal styles of Jamaican English which are often rhotic. Jamaican English differs from RP in its vowel inventory, which has a distinction between long and short vowels rather than tense and lax vowels as in Standard English. The diphthongs {{IPA|/ei/}} and {{IPA|/ou/}} are monophthongs {{IPA|[eː]}} and {{IPA|[oː]}} or even the reverse diphthongs {{IPA|[ie]}} and {{IPA|[uo]}} (e.g. ''bay'' and ''boat'' pronounced {{IPA|[bʲeː]}} and {{IPA|[bʷoːt]}}). Often word-final consonant clusters are simplified so that "child" is pronounced {{IPA|[t͡ʃail]}} and "wind" {{IPA|[win]}}.{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=117–18}}{{sfn|Lawton|1982|page=256–60}}{{sfn|Trudgill|Hannah|2002|pages=115–16}}

As a historical legacy, [[Indian English]] tends to take RP as its ideal, and how well this ideal is realised in an individual's speech reflects class distinctions among Indian English speakers. Indian English accents are marked by the pronunciation of phonemes such as {{IPA|/t/}} and {{IPA|/d/}} (often pronounced with retroflex articulation as {{IPA|[ʈ]}} and {{IPA|[ɖ]}}) and the replacement of {{IPA|/θ/}} and {{IPA|/ð/}} with dentals {{IPA|[t̪]}} and {{IPA|[d̪]}}. Sometimes Indian English speakers may also use spelling based pronunciations where the silent {{angbr|h}} found in words such as ''ghost'' is pronounced as an Indian [[Breathy voice|voiced aspirated]] stop {{IPA|[ɡʱ]}}.{{sfn|Sailaja|2009|pages=19–24}}

'''FAST – Fighting Antisemitism Together''', is a [[Canada|Canadian]] [[human rights]] [[activist]] group which opposes [[antisemitism]] and all intolerance. It was founded in 2005 and describes itself as "a coalition of non-Jewish Canadian community and business leaders dedicated to speaking out against humanity's oldest hatred."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.unb.ca/donations/unbfutures/documents/ComperFinal-L.pdf University of New Brunswick website]; [http://www.newswire.ca/en/releases/archive/May2006/24/c7494.html CNW Group web site]&lt;/ref&gt;

FAST was founded by Elizabeth and [[F. Anthony Comper|Tony Comper]], former CEO and President of BMO Financial. The organization is unique in that its leadership is largely non-Jewish.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/canada/story/2005/08/15/fighting-antisemitism-050815.html CBC news story] ''Non-Jewish executives band together to fight anti-Semitism'', August 15, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; FAST is a national non-profit organization with Nicole Miller as Executive Director in Toronto and regional directors in Quebec, British Columbia, Saskatchewan/Manitoba region and Alberta.

FAST sponsors two human rights educational programs, online at no cost to educators and the public: 
1. '''''Choose Your Voice''''', a series of lesson plans and documentation for students in Grades 6, 7 and 8

2. "'''''Voices into Action'''''" - a teaching resource, curriculum-based for grades 9 to 12 and also used for adult education

Both programs were developed by curriculum experts at OISE-UT and teach people to speak out and take action against racism, antisemitism, homophobia, islamophobia and all intolerance. FAST won the Award of Excellence from the Canadian Race Relations Foundation in 2010 for Choose Your Voice and in 2016 for Voices into Action. Since 2005, Choose Your Voice has been delivered to more than 2.4 million Canadian students and Voices into Action has reached at least 630,000 Canadian students (high school and continuing education) since 2014.

'''Financial incentives for photovoltaics''' are incentives offered to electricity consumers to install and operate solar-electric generating systems, also known as [[photovoltaics]] (PV). A government may offer incentives in order to encourage the PV industry to achieve the [[economies of scale]] needed to compete where the cost of PV-generated electricity is above [[Photovoltaics#Grid parity|the cost from the existing grid]]. Such policies are implemented to promote national or territorial [[Energy development|energy independence]], [[high tech]] job creation and reduction of [[carbon emissions|carbon dioxide emissions]] which cause climate change.

When, in a given country or territory, the cost of solar electricity falls to meet the rising cost of grid electricity, then 'grid parity' is reached, and in principle incentives are no longer needed. In some places, the price of electricity varies as a function of time and day (due to demand variations). In places where high demand (and high electricity prices) coincide with high sunshine (usually hot places with air conditioning) then grid parity is reached before the cost solar electricity meets the average price of grid electricity.

==Mechanisms==
Four incentive mechanisms are used (often in combination):  
* Investment [[subsidy|subsidies]]: the authorities refund part of the cost of installation of the system.
* [[Feed-in Tariff]]s/[[net metering]]: the electricity utility buys PV electricity from the producer under a multiyear contract at a guaranteed rate.
* [[Solar Renewable Energy Certificates]] ("SRECs")

'''Investment subsidies'''

With investment subsidies, the financial burden falls upon the taxpayer, while with feed-in tariffs the extra cost is distributed across the utilities' customer bases. While the investment subsidy may be simpler to administer, the main argument in favour of feed-in tariffs is the encouragement of quality. Investment subsidies are paid out as a function of the nameplate capacity of the installed system and are independent of its actual power yield over time, so reward overstatement of power, and tolerate poor durability and maintenance.

'''Feed-in Tariffs (FiT)'''

With feed-in tariffs, the initial financial burden falls upon the consumer. Feed-in tariffs reward the number of kilowatt-hours produced over a long period of time, but because the rate is set by the authorities may result in  overpayment of the owner of the PV installation. The price paid per kWh under a feed-in tariff exceeds the price of grid electricity.

'''Net metering'''

"Net metering" refers to the case where the price paid by the utility is the same as the price charged, often achieved by having the electricity meter spin backwards as electricity produced by the PV installation in excess of the amount being used by the owner of the installation is fed back into the grid.

'''Solar Renewable Energy Credits (SRECs)'''

Alternatively, SRECs allow for a market mechanism to set the price of the solar generated electricity subsidy. In this mechanism, a renewable energy production or consumption target is set, and the utility (more technically the Load Serving Entity) is obliged to purchase renewable energy or face a fine (Alternative Compliance Payment or ACP). The producer is credited for an SREC for every 1,000&amp;nbsp;kWh of electricity produced. If the utility buys this SREC and retires it, they avoid paying the ACP. In principle this system delivers the cheapest renewable energy, since the all solar facilities are eligible and can be installed in the most economic locations. Uncertainties about the future value of SRECs has led to SREC contract markets&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.srectrade.com/srec_forwards.php |accessdate=May 13, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100517052023/http://www.srectrade.com/srec_forwards.php |archivedate=May 17, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; long-term to give clarity to their prices and allow solar developers to pre-sell/hedge their SRECs.

''Quick overview''

[[Smart meter]]s allow the retail price to vary as a function of time ("time of use pricing").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.firstenergycorp.com/Residential_and_Business/Customer_Choice/New_York/Small_Business_-_Time-Of-Use_Pricing_Options.html |title=Customer Choice |publisher=Firstenergycorp.com |date=2012-03-30 |accessdate=2014-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; When demand is high the retail price is high and vice versa. With time-of-use pricing, when peak demand coincides with hot sunny days, the cost of solar electricity is closer to the price of grid electricity, and grid parity will be reached earlier than if one single price were used for grid electricity.

The Japanese government through its Ministry of International Trade and Industry ran a successful programme of subsidies from 1994 to 2003. By the end of 2004, Japan led the world in installed PV capacity with over 1.1 GW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oja-services.nl/iea-pvps/isr/22.htm |accessdate=June 5, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070208104905/http://www.oja-services.nl/iea-pvps/isr/22.htm |archivedate=February 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the German government introduced the first large-scale feed-in tariff system, under a law known as the 'EEG' (see below) which resulted in explosive growth of PV installations in Germany. At the outset the Feed-in Tariff (FIT) was over 3x the retail price or 8x the industrial price. The principle behind the German system is a 20-year flat rate contract. The value of new contracts is programmed to decrease each year, in order to encourage the industry to pass on lower costs to the end users.

In October 2008, Spain, Italy, Greece and France introduced feed-in tariffs. None{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}&lt;!-- date needed when this was the case, because since 2007 Italy appears to have a 2% reduction each year for new contracts after 2009 Jan 1 --&gt; have replicated the programmed decrease of FIT in new contracts though, making the German incentive less attractive compared to other countries. The French FIT offers a uniquely high premium{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}&lt;!-- up to 55 Euro cents per kWh is high, but is it uniquely high? Germany had 57.4 per kWh plus extra 5&amp;nbsp;cents for facade systems (Bundestag law in 2004 Teil I Nr. 40) although now reducing, and Italy has up to 49 euro cents for example. Is there a complete comparison list? Need to compare like with like. Again date range needed when this was the case. --&gt; for building integrated systems.

In 2006 California approved the '[[California Solar Initiative]]', offering a choice of investment subsidies or [[Feed-in Tariff|FIT]] for small and medium systems and a FIT for large systems. The small-system FIT of $0.39 per kWh (far less than EU countries) expires in just 5&amp;nbsp;years, and the residential investment incentive is overwhelmed by a newly required time-of-use tariff, with a net cost increase to new systems. All California incentives are scheduled to decrease in the future depending as a function of the amount of PV capacity installed.{{Clarify|date=October 2008}}&lt;!-- comparisons may be better handled in a table, as "less than EU countries" needs to state exactly which countries (UK has no FIT for example). Also cite needed. --&gt;

At the end of 2006, the Ontario Power Authority (Canada) began its Standard Offer Program,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/sop/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20070629173255/http://www.powerauthority.on.ca/sop/ |archivedate=2007-06-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first in North America for small renewable projects (10MW or less). This guarantees a fixed price of $0.42 CDN per kWh for PV and $0.11 CDN per kWh for other sources (i.e., wind, biomass, hydro) over a period of twenty years. Unlike net metering, all the electricity produced is sold to the OPA at the SOP rate. The generator then purchases any needed electricity at the current prevailing rate (e.g., $0.055 per kWh). The difference should cover all the costs of installation and operation over the life of the contract.

The price per [[Kilowatt hour]] (kWh) or kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; of the FIT or investment subsidies is only one of three factors that stimulate the installation of PV. The other two factors are insolation (the more sunshine, the less capital is needed for a given power output) and administrative ease of obtaining permits and contracts (Southern European countries are reputedly complex). For example, Greece, at the end of 2008, had 3GWp of permit requests unprocessed and halted new applications.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.helapco.gr/library/25_11_08/New-FIT-Greece_26Nov08.pdf{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==National incentives==
The most significant incentives programs are listed here.

===Australia===
{{Main|Feed-in tariffs in Australia}}
Australia is a federation of states and territories. Each state has different laws regarding feed-in tariffs. The states have a range of policies from no feed-in tariffs to feed-in tariffs at more than double the normal consumer price of electricity. Some states are considering feed-in tariffs but have not yet enacted relevant legislation, or the legislation has not yet come into effect. Only a small proportion are Gross Feed-in tariffs (proposed NSW and ACT), most are on a net basis. In the Northern Territory at present only the Alice Springs Solar City is eligible for feed-in tariffs for solar PV.

====Ontario====

In 2006 the Ontario Power Authority introduced the Renewable Energy Standard Offer Program. This program was replaced with the 2009 Feed-In Tariff program for renewable energy (FIT). The FIT program is further divided into the MicroFIT program for projects less than 10&amp;nbsp;kW, designed to encourage individuals and households to generate renewable energy.

The program was launched in September 2009 and the tariffs were fixed then. The solar projects ≤10&amp;nbsp;kW received $0.802, however, as of 13 August 2010 ground mounted systems will receive a lower tariff than rooftop mounted systems.

Feed-In tariff rates for the Ontario Power Authority (OPA) FIT and MicroFIT Programs, for renewable generation capacity of 10MW or less, connected at 50 kV:

* Solar Photovoltaic:
Rooftop ≤10&amp;nbsp;kW $0.802/kWh CDN
Ground Mounted ≤10&amp;nbsp;kW $0.642/kWh CDN
Rooftop &gt; 10 ≤ 250&amp;nbsp;kW $0.713/kWh CDN
Rooftop &gt; 250 ≤ 500&amp;nbsp;kW $0.635/kWh CDN
Rooftop &gt; 500&amp;nbsp;kW $0.539/kWh CDN
Ground Mounted2 &gt; 10&amp;nbsp;kW $0.443/kWh CDN

* Wind, Hydro, Biomass: from $0.111 up to $0.195/kWh CDN

Tariffs vary based on fuel type and size of installation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fit.powerauthority.on.ca/Storage/102/11122_FIT_Price_Schedule_August_13_2010.pdf ]{{dead link|date=April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract duration with the OPA is 20&amp;nbsp;years, with a constant remuneration for solar, though biomass, biogas, hydro, and wind receive a 20% of Consumer Price Index price adder. Additionally, biomass, biogas, hydro receive a 35% peak demand adder during peak demand periods of the day and -10% off peak. Finally, all but solar may also qualify for a community and aboriginal price adder. All power produced is sold to the OPA. Generator then purchases back what is needed at prevailing rate (e.g., $0.055/kWh CDN). The intent of the Feed-In Tariff program is to provide an 11% return on investment.

In June 2013, Ontario Canceled Feed-in Tariffs for Large Projects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/rea/news/article/2013/06/two-steps-forward-one-back-ontario-cancels-feed-in-tariffs-for-large-projects]&lt;/ref&gt;

New contract prices are changed for 5% yearly, due to unexpected rise of number of installations in 2009 new bill is proposed allowing 25% change.

===China===
As of August 2011 a national feed-in tariff for solar projects was issued,
and is about US$0.15 per kWh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2011/09/14/14climatewire-china-uses-feed-in-tariff-to-build-domestic-25559.html |title= China Uses Feed-In Tariff to Build Domestic Solar Market (by Coco Liu)| publisher= nytimes.com |date=14 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Situation as of 2009====

Backed by the Chinese government’s total stimulus package of RMB 4&amp;nbsp;trillion ($585bn), Chinese businesses are now among the top producers of electric vehicles, wind turbines, solar panels and energy efficient appliances, according to a report released last month by London-based The Climate Group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.icis.com/Articles/2009/09/18/9248776/Renewable-energy-momentum-in-China-accelerates.html |title= Renewable energy momentum in China accelerates | publisher= ICIS.com |date=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, the China government introduced the "Solar Roofs Plan" for promoting the application of solar PV building. The Ministry of Finance in July re-introduced the "Golden Sun Project" with more specific details of the related policy. The policy provides that the grid-connected photovoltaic power generation project, the state will in principle by photovoltaic power generation system and its supporting transmission and distribution projects to give 50% of the total investment subsidies. The subsidy will rise to 70% for solar power systems in remote areas that are not currently connected to the grid. Projects with a minimum capacity of 500MW would be eligible for the related incentive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.businessgreen.com/business-green/news/2246509/china-unveils-subsidies-per%20 |title= China unveils subsidies of 50 per cent on large solar power projects | publisher= BusinessGreen.com |date=22 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; All such financial incentive schemes boosts most of the new development in China solar market, such as the new thin film solar plant of Anwell Technologies and Tianwei, as well as the contract signed by LDK solar to install up to 500&amp;nbsp;MW of capacity of PV stations over the next five years in Jiangsu Province of China.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pv-tech.org/news/_a/anwell_produces_its_first_a-si_thin-film_module_using_in-house_technology/ |title= Anwell produces its first a-Si thin-film module using in-house technology | publisher= PV Tech.org |date=9 Sep 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.pv-tech.org/news/_a/tianwei_solarfilms_ramps_production_as_70mw_supply_deal_signed/ |title= Tianwei SolarFilms ramps production as 70MW supply deal signed |publisher= PV Tech.org |date= 21 Sep 2009 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100413083529/http://www.pv-tech.org/news/_a/tianwei_solarfilms_ramps_production_as_70mw_supply_deal_signed/ |archivedate= 2010-04-13 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.china-briefing.com/news/2009/09/10/china-industry-sept-10.html |title= China Industry brief | publisher= China Briefing |date=10 Sep 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|German Renewable Energy Sources Act}}

The [[German Renewable Energy Sources Act|Renewable Energy Sources Act]] ({{lang-de|Erneuerbare-Energien-Gesetz}} or EEG) came into effect in 2000 and has been adapted by many countries around the world.  It was amended several times and triggered an unprecedented boom in solar electricity production.  This success is largely due to the creation of favourable political framework conditions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://en.solarwirtschaft.de/home/photovoltaic-market/policy-framework.html Policy framework: The Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719084231/http://en.solarwirtschaft.de/home/photovoltaic-market/policy-framework.html |date=2011-07-19 }} Bundesverband Solarwirtschaft. 2 Feb 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Grid operators are legally obliged to pay producers of solar electricity a fixed remuneration ([[feed-in tariff]] or FIT) for solar generated electricity fed into the grid, depending on the size and type of the system, as well as the year of installation.  The tariffs vary to account for the different costs of rooftop or ground-mounted systems in accordance with the size of the system and  system cost reductions over time.  Since the EEG guarantees the FIT payments for a duration of 20 years, it provides sustained planning security for investors in PV systems.  [[Grid parity]] for large installation and small roof-top systems was already reached in 2011 and 2012, respectively.

As of July 2014, feed-in tariffs for photovoltaic systems range from 12.88{{nbsp}}¢/kWh for small [[Rooftop photovoltaic power station|roof-top]] system to 8.92{{nbsp}}¢/kWh for large utility scaled [[Photovoltaic power station|solar parks]].  Feed-in tariffs are restricted to a maximum system capacity of 10{{nbsp}}MW.  The feed-in tariff for solar PV is declining at a faster rate than for any other renewable technology.&lt;ref name="fraunhofer-2014"&gt;[http://www.ise.fraunhofer.de/de/veroeffentlichungen/veroeffentlichungen-pdf-dateien/studien-und-konzeptpapiere/aktuelle-fakten-zur-photovoltaik-in-deutschland.pdf Facts about solar PV (in German)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 August 2014, a revised Renewable Energy Sources Act entered into force.  Specific deployment corridors now stipulate the extent to which renewable energy is to be expanded in the future and the funding rates (feed-in tariffs) will no longer be fixed by the government, but will be determined by auction.&lt;ref name="bmwi-2015"&gt;{{cite book

===Taiwan===
Situation as of 2009

The Bureau of Energy under Taiwan's Ministry of Economic Affairs (MOEA) has announced the proposed feed-in tariff rates for photovoltaic (PV) and other types of renewable energy in September. A tentative rates of NT$8.1243-9.3279 (US$0.250-0.287) per kilowatt-hour (kwh) has been set for PV generated power, however, the proposed rates have fallen considerably short of local solar players' expectations. Public hearing will be held on 24 Sept to collect opinions from all parties concerned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.digitimes.com/news/a20090921PD209.html |title= Taiwan government sets tentative PV feed-in tariffs | publisher= Digitimes |date=21 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
"Amending the Law on Utilization of Renewable Energy Resources in Electricity Generation" (Law No: 6094) (enacted 29 December 2010, published in the Official Gazette dated 8 January 2011 and numbered 27809) (''Amendment Law'')

The Amendment Law introduces significant amendments to improve the incentive mechanism under the Renewable Energy Law and encourage renewable energy investment opportunities in Turkey – the following are the main amendments and incentives:

According to the Amendment Law, the applicable sale tariffs within the scope of the RES Support Mechanism are as follows (for solar):
Solar power based production facility	13,3 dollar cent/kWh

===United Kingdom===
As of November 2010, the UK Government has introduced a feed-in tariff for small scale (up to 5MW) renewables from 1 April 2010, with a review in 2012 for changes on 1 April 2013.  Though limits on max MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; installations will be announced in December to steer away from large solar utilities.&lt;ref&gt;decc.gov.uk&lt;/ref&gt;

* From April 2010, the FIT will offer a fixed payment per kilowatt hour generated (see table) and a guaranteed minimum payment of 3p per kWh exported to the market (assumed 50% only) or you are entitled to opt out with your own Power Purchase Agreement (PPA). Tariffs will not be index-linked to the RPI.
* Projects up to 5 MW will be eligible, including off-grid installations.
* Technologies that will be eligible for the FIT from April 2010 are: wind, solar PV, hydro, anaerobic digestion, biomass, biomass CHP and non-renewable microchip (see table for tariffs).
* The FIT will be offered for a 20-year period, with the exception of solar PV projects for which the period will be 25&amp;nbsp;years.
* The FIT designed with the aim of delivering 2% of the UK’s energy from small scale projects by 2020.
* Where appropriate, support will decrease in line with expected technology cost reductions.
* Support levels will be reviewed periodically and in response to sudden changes in technology costs. However, tariff levels will be grandfathered, so that projects continue to receive the levels of support offered at their registration.
* Projects below 50&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; must be installed by MCS accredited installers. 50&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; to 5 MW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; projects will be subject to accreditation similar to the current RO process.
* Projects installed in the interim period between the announcement of the FIT (15 July 2009) and the start of the scheme (April 2010) will be eligible to receive the tariff with some conditions on the support period. However, any non-domestic projects that receive grant funding from central government will have to return the grant before they can receive FIT payments.
* Regardless of technology, projects installed prior to 15 July 2009 will be eligible to receive generation payments currently being auctioned of 9p/kWh and export payments of 5p/kWh, provided they were previously receiving support under the RO scheme.
* Projects up to 50&amp;nbsp;kW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; in size will no longer be able to claim the RO; existing installations will be automatically transferred to the FIT. New and interim period projects between 50&amp;nbsp;kW and 5 MW will be given a one-off choice between claiming support under the FIT or the RO. Existing projects between 50&amp;nbsp;kW and 5 MW in size will remain under the RO, with no opportunity to transfer to the FIT.
* No further capital/financial support for the up-front capital costs of projects. (though Green Deal for dwellings is under consultation as a no up front cost incentive for energy efficiency and renewables)
* Feed - in - tariff rates for PV grid connected
43.3 p/kWh  &lt;  4&amp;nbsp;kW  &gt;  37.9 p/kWh  &lt;  10&amp;nbsp;kW  &gt;  32.8 p/kWh  &lt;  100&amp;nbsp;kW  &gt;  30.7 p/kWh

i.e. 43.3 pence/kWh fed in from a less than (or equals?) 4&amp;nbsp;kW peak power installation

37.9 p/kWh for &gt;(or=?)   4&amp;nbsp;kW  &lt;(or=?)  10&amp;nbsp;kW

32.8 p/kWh for &gt;(or=?)  10&amp;nbsp;kW  &lt;(or=?) 100&amp;nbsp;kW

30.7 p/kWh for &gt;(or=?) 100&amp;nbsp;kW

Stand alone installation: 30.7 p/kWh

From 1 August 2011, the tariff rate for &gt; 50 KW&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt; will be 19.0 p/kwh.

Typical domestic (&lt; 4&amp;nbsp;kW peak?) installations registered (on or?) after December 12, 2011 will attract only (~)21 p/kWh.

'''Government off-the-shelf''' ('''GOTS''') is a term for [[software]] and hardware government products that are ready to use and which were created and are owned by a government agency.

Typically GOTS are developed by the technical staff of the government agency for which it is created. It is sometimes developed by an external entity, but with funding and specification from the agency. Because agencies can directly control all aspects of GOTS products, these are sometimes preferred for government purposes.

GOTS software solutions can normally be shared among government agencies without additional cost. GOTS hardware solutions are typically provided at cost (i.e.,&amp;nbsp;R&amp;D costs not recouped).

==List of GOTS software==

* [[Naval Simulation System]] (NSS)
* [[Personal Computer Debriefing System]] (PCDS)
* [[SIMDIS]]
* [[TractorFax]] (TFT)

==Details==
===Modus of scam===
Raxil, manufactured by [[Bayer]], is used to treat the [[Seed saving|seeds]] for [[Karnal bunt]].&lt;ref name=chor13/&gt; Hooda government had purchased Raxil worth INR 100 crore for the treatment of seeds to be distributed to the farmers.&lt;ref name=chor13/&gt; Raxil, which is not registered with the Pesticide Management Bord and costs INR1350 per kg, was preferred over the generic brands which cost only INR300 per kg. In spite of this, Raxil was the sole drug recommended by the Hooda administration.&lt;ref name=chor13/&gt; As a result, there is a High Court case underway for causing the loss to government for preferring only one drug, that too an unregistered and expensive drug, over other drugs.&lt;ref name=chor13/&gt; Use of Raxil was discontinued by the new BJP govenrmnet, case was referred to [[Standing committee (India)|Parliamentary Standing committee]], CVC and High Court,&lt;ref name=chor13/&gt; as well as to CBI.&lt;ref name=chor1&gt;[http://www.tribuneindia.com/news/haryana/cbi-to-probe-two-more-hooda-govt-land-deals/557679.html CBI to probe two more Hooda govt land deals], [[The Tribune (Chandigarh)|The Tribune]], 14 March 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=chor11/&gt;

{{primary sources|date=January 2008}}

The '''Helsinki Committees for Human Rights''' exist in many [[Europe]]an countries (the [[Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe|OSCE]] region) as volunteer, [[non-profit organization]]s devoted to [[human rights]] and presumably named after the [[Helsinki Accords]]. Formerly organized into the '''[[International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights]]''' (IHF) based in [[Vienna]].

The Helsinki Committees began as [[Helsinki Watch]] groups. The first one was founded in the [[Soviet Union]] in 1976, the second in 1977 in [[Czechoslovakia]], the third in 1979 in [[Poland]], etc.

In 1982, representatives of several of these committees held an International Citizens Helsinki Watch Conference and founded the IHF.

In 1992, a [[British Helsinki Human Rights Group]] was established in the [[UK]], but this group has always been completely independent of the International Helsinki Federation for Human Rights. The UK's official representative in the IHF is the British Helsinki Subcommittee of the Parliamentary Human Rights Group, established in 1976.

'''Heterosexism''' is a system of [[Attitude (psychology)|attitudes]], [[bias]], and [[discrimination]] in favor of opposite-sex [[Human sexuality|sexuality]] and relationships.&lt;ref name="JungSmith"&gt;{{cite book|last=Jung|first=Patricia Beattie|author2=Smith, Ralph F.|title=Heterosexism: An Ethical Challenge|publisher=State University of New York Press|year=1993|isbn=0-7914-1696-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It can include the presumption that other people are [[Heterosexuality|heterosexual]] or that opposite-sex attractions and relationships are the only [[Norm (social)|norm]]&lt;ref name="Cramer2014"&gt;{{cite book|author=Elizabeth Cramer|title=Addressing Homophobia and Heterosexism on College Campuses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dqAAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1|date=5 March 2014|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-317-82328-5|page=2|quote=The definition for heterosexism that I used for authors in the collection is: The expectation that all persons should be or are heterosexual. The belief that heterosexual relations are normal and the norm. These expectations and beliefs occur on individual, institutional, and cultural levels. ...}}&lt;/ref&gt; and therefore superior. Although heterosexism is defined in the online editions of the ''[[American Heritage Dictionary of the English Language]]'' and the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary]]'' as anti-gay [[discrimination]] or prejudice "by heterosexual people"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/heterosexism|title=Yahoo|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "by heterosexuals",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/heterosexism|title=Definition of HETEROSEXISM|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; respectively, people of any [[sexual orientation]] can hold such attitudes and bias, and can form a part of [[internalized homophobia|internalised hatred]] of one's sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ego.thechicagoschool.edu/s/843/images/editor_documents/heterosexism.doc |title=Heterosexism and Internalized Heterosexism |author=Kira Weidner |accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterosexism as discrimination ranks [[gay]] men, [[lesbian]]s, [[bisexual]]s and other sexual minorities as [[second-class citizen]]s with regard to various legal and [[civil rights]], economic opportunities, and [[social equality]] in many of the world's jurisdictions and societies. Heterosexism is often related to [[homophobia]].

== Background ==
While the ''[[Webster's Dictionary|Merriam-Webster Collegiate Dictionary]]'' notes first use of the term heterosexism as having occurred in 1972, the term was first published in 1971 by [[gay rights activist]], [[Craig Rodwell]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodwell, Craig. ' 'The Tarnished Golden Rule' ' pg. 5, QQ Magazine, Queen's Quarterly Publishing, New York. (January/February 1971 issue, Vol. 3, No. 1) Retrieved July 21, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology and usage===
Similar terms include "heterocentrism" and "heterosexualism".&lt;ref&gt;Corsini, Raymond J. (1992). ''The Dictionary of Psychology''. {{ISBN|1-58391-328-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the well-established term ''heterosexism'' is often explained as a [[Neologism|coinage]] modeled on ''[[sexism]]'', the derivation of its meaning points more to (1.) ''heterosex(ual)'' + ''-ism'' than (2.) ''hetero-'' + ''sexism''. In fact, the word ''heterosexualism'' has been used as an equivalent to sexism and racism.&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt;

Given this lack of [[Transparency (linguistic)#Descriptive|semantic transparency]], researchers, outreach workers, [[critical theorists]] and [[LGBT]] activists have proposed and use terms such as ''institutionalized homophobia'', ''state(-sponsored) homophobia'',&lt;ref&gt;International Lesbian and Gay Association. [http://www.ilga.org/news_results.asp?LanguageID=1&amp;FileID=1058&amp;FileCategory=10&amp;ZoneID=7 "State-sponsored Homophobia"]&lt;/ref&gt; ''sexual prejudice'', ''anti-gay [[bigotry]]'', ''[[straight privilege]]'', ''[[La pensée straight|The Straight Mind]]'' (a collection of essays by French writer [[Monique Wittig]]), ''heterosexual bias'', ''[[compulsory heterosexuality]]''&lt;ref&gt;LGBTQ on-line encyclopedia of gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender, and queer culture&lt;/ref&gt; or the much lesser known terms ''heterocentrism'', ''[[homonegativity]]'', and from [[gender theory]] and [[queer theory]], ''[[heteronormativity]]''. However, not all of these descriptors are synonymous to ''heterosexism''.

===Contrast to homophobia===

''[[Homophobia]]'', a form of heterosexism, refers both to "unreasoning fear of or [[antipathy]] towards homosexuals and homosexuality"&lt;ref name=dictionary.com&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/homophobia|title=Dictionary.com|accessdate=2008-01-29|year=2008|publisher=Dictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and to "behavior based on such a feeling".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia |title=homophobia - Dictionary definition and pronunciation - Yahoo! Education |publisher=Education.yahoo.com |accessdate=2014-01-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131204061410/http://education.yahoo.com/reference/dictionary/entry/homophobia |archivedate=2013-12-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Heterosexism'', however, more broadly denotes the "system of ideological thought that makes heterosexuality the sole norm to follow for sexual practices".&lt;ref name="granddictionnaire.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.granddictionnaire.com/ficheOqlf.aspx?Id_Fiche=8373795#eng |title=Accueil |publisher=Granddictionnaire.com |date=2013-05-13 |accessdate=2014-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a bias favoring heterosexuals and heterosexuality, heterosexism has been described as being "encoded into and characteristic of the major social, cultural, and economic institutions of our society"&lt;ref&gt;Dines, Gail (2002). ''Gender, Race, and Class in Media: A Text-Reader''. {{ISBN|0-7619-2261-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; and stems from the [[essentialist]] cultural notion that [[maleness]]-[[masculinity]] and femaleness-[[femininity]] are complementary.

Researcher, author, and psychology professor Gregory M. Herek states that "[Heterosexism] operates through a dual process of invisibility and attack. Homosexuality usually remains culturally invisible; when people who engage in homosexual behavior or who are identified as homosexual become visible, they are subject to attack by society."&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://psychology.ucdavis.edu/rainbow/HTML/prej_defn.html |author= Gregory M.

"Inside the Minds of People Who Hate Gays" Retrieved May 29, 2008: https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html&lt;/ref&gt; She continues by saying that "assaults on homosexuals and other individuals who deviate from [[Gender role|sex role]] norms are viewed as a learned form of [[social control]] of deviance rather than a defensive response to personal threat."&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;

===Parallels and intersections===
{{Rquote|right|Using the term heterosexism highlights the parallels between antigay sentiment and other forms of prejudice, such as [[racism]], [[antisemitism]], and [[sexism]].  |[[Gregory M. Herek]], researcher, author, and professor of psychology at [[University of California at Davis|UC Davis]].|&lt;ref name="psychology.ucdavis.edu"/&gt;}}

It has been argued that the concept of heterosexism is similar to the concept of [[racism]] in that both ideas promote privilege for dominant groups within a given society. For example, borrowing from the racial concept of [[white privilege]], the concept of [[heterosexual privilege]]&lt;ref name="genderknot149"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Allan J.|title=The Gender Knot|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|year=1997|page=149|isbn=1-56639-519-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; has been applied to benefits of (presumed) heterosexuality within society that heterosexuals take for granted. The analogy is that just as racism against non-white people places white people as superior to [[Person of color|people of color]], heterosexism places heterosexual people or relationships as superior to [[non-heterosexual]] ones. In trying to rebut this premise, some commentators point to differences&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.bet.com/news/youthvote/4-reasons-why-gay-is-not-the-new-black/4|title=Celebrities|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; between the categories of race and sexual orientation, claiming they are too complex to support any generalizations.  For example, "[[Diversity training|trainer on diversity]]" and consultant Jamie Washington has commented, although heterosexism and racism are "woven from the same fabric" they are "not the same thing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://susquehanna.edu/crusader/article.cfm?IssueID=59&amp;SectionID=1&amp;ArticleID=2573 Issues of race and sexuality discussed, Susquehanna Crusader Online, accessed Aug 29, 2009 ]&lt;/ref&gt;  Some American Conservative leaders such as [http://www.laprogressive.com/author/rev.-irene-monroe/ Rev. Irene Monroe] comment that those who suggest or state "gay is the new black", as in a cover story of ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'' magazine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advocate.com/exclusive_detail_ektid65744.asp Gay is the New Black, accessed Aug 30, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; exploit [[black people]]'s suffering and experiences to legitimize their own.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.irenemonroe.com/2008/12/16/gay-is-not-the-new-black/ Gay is NOT the new Black, accessed Aug 29, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, a study presented at the [[British Psychological Society]]'s Division of Occupational Psychology 2009 Conference shows that heterosexist prejudice is more pervasive than racism.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bps.org.uk/media-centre/press-releases/releases$/division-of-occupational-psychology/prejudice-study-finds-gay-is-the-new-black.cfm Prejudice study finds gay is the new black, accessed Sept 3, 2009]&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexism can also [[Intersectionality|intersect]] with racism by further emphasizing differences among arbitrary groups of people.&lt;ref name="tatum22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Tatum|first=Beverly|title=Why are all the Black kids sitting together in the cafeteria?|publisher=Basic Books|year=1997|pages=21–22}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, heterosexism can compound the effects of racism by:
* promoting injustices towards a person already facing injustices because of their race
* establishing [[social hierarchies]] that allow one group more privilege than other groups.

Likewise, racism can allow LGBT people to be subjected to additional discrimination or violence if they belong to or are considered a part of a socially devalued racial category.&lt;ref&gt;(2008) Heterosexism and Homophobia. Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, 2, 1–4. Retrieved March 31, 2008 from Gale Virtual Reference Library: http://find.galegroup.com/ips/start.do?prodId=IPS.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the privileges afforded to people falling into the categories of white people and (perceived) heterosexuals include, but are not limited to, social acceptance, prestige, freedom from negative [[stereotypes]], and the comfort of being within the [[Norm (sociology)|norm]] and thereby not being [[marginalized]] or viewed as different.&lt;ref&gt;Simoni, J. M. &amp; Walters, K. L. (2001). Heterosexual Identity and Heterosexism: Recognizing Privilege to Reduce Prejudice. Journal of Homosexuality, 1(1), 157–173.

== As a set of beliefs and attitudes ==
{{See also|Religion and homosexuality|Homosexuality and psychology|Sexual orientation and medicine (disambiguation)|Social attitudes toward homosexuality}}

=== Individual and group level ===
Heterosexism as a set of beliefs and attitudes relies on a core [[wikt:tenet|tenet]] according to which [[heteronormativity|homosexuality and bisexuality do not normally exist]] and, as such, constitute [[mental disorder|mental illnesses]] or [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behaviors]].&lt;ref name="genderknot17"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Allan J.|title=The Gender Knot|publisher=Temple University Press|location=Philadelphia|year=1997|page=17|isbn=1-56639-519-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within a heterosexist ideology or [[mindset]], the concept of [[sexual orientation]] is rejected or deemed irrelevant. A set of more nuanced heterosexist views, which some may consider faith, [[dogma]], [[Moral absolutism|universal truths]], natural law, [[Appeal to authority|appeals to authority]], or popular beliefs, but others consider to be [[conventional wisdom]] or [[sociobiology|sociobiological]] knowledge can include, among others, the following:

[[File:Save Our Children From Homosexuality Brochure.jpg|thumb|upright|Brochure used by [[Save Our Children]] in 1977]]
* Non-heterosexual persons should keep their sexual orientations private (i.e., they should remain "[[closeted]]").&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;15&lt;/sup&gt;
* The attitude that gay men aren't [[machismo|"real" men]] or lesbians aren't "real" women because of the socially pervasive view that heterosexual attractions or activities are the "norm" and therefore superior.&lt;ref name="genderknot149" /&gt;
* "God created [[Adam and Eve]], not [[Adam and Steve]] (or Madame and Eve)" and similar essentialist cultural notions that maleness-masculinity and femaleness-femininity are complementary;
* Homosexuality being wrong, ungodly, and against nature, it is therefore a [[sin]], [[evil]] or subhuman.&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;18&lt;/sup&gt;
* Views identical or akin to [[Anita Bryant]]'s statement during her [[Save Our Children]] campaign in the U.S. (''See campaign brochure image at right''):
:"As a mother, I know that homosexuals cannot biologically reproduce children; therefore, they must [[Homosexual recruitment|recruit]] our children."
* Because of their lifestyle, homosexuals do not have families with children, so they undermine the survival of the human race ([[natalism]]).
* Homosexuality is an affectional or [[mental disorder]] or simply a social ill, therefore, it can be cured or stamped out. If it is not eradicated, it will lead to [[Social solidarity|social disintegration]] and [[societal collapse]].
* Homosexuals can be converted to heterosexuality.&lt;ref name="JungSmith" /&gt;&lt;sup&gt; p.&amp;nbsp;109&lt;/sup&gt;

In an attempt to bring awareness to people who exhibit heterosexist views but are possibly not aware of it, Mark Rochlin constructed a set of questions in 1977 which are questions that non-heterosexual people are often exposed to, but not heterosexuals, such as "''What do you think caused your sexuality?''" This heterosexuality questionnaire is often distributed around college campuses to bring awareness of heterosexist sexual prejudice against LGBT persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinkpractice.co.uk/quaire.htm|title=The Pink Practice - Heterosexuality Questionnaire|publisher=|accessdate=4 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Institutional level===
As well as comprising attitudes held by an individual or a social group, heterosexism can also exist as the expression of attitudes within an institution. As a result, schools, hospitals, and correctional facilities can act as a showcase for heterosexist attitudes in various ways. First, schools may implement these attitudes and ideas through unequal and inconsistent disciplinary actions. One such example is meting out harsher punishment to a same-sex couple violating the school ground rules while allowing a heterosexual couple to pass with an easier and more subtle disciplinary action for an equal or identical violation. Also, hospitals may limit patient visiting only to immediate family, i.e., relatives, and exclude same sex partners.&lt;ref&gt;Heterosexism and Homophobia. Encyclopedia of Race and Racism, 2, 1–4. Retrieved March 31, 2008 from Gale Virtual Reference Library: http://find.galegroup.com/ips/start.do?prodId=IPS.&lt;/ref&gt;

Heterosexism affects the family in several ways. For example, in many countries around the world, same-sex marriage is not allowed, so non-heterosexual persons must remain unmarried or enter into heterosexual marriage.&lt;ref name="TFDASJ" /&gt; Many countries also deny rights and benefits to same-sex couples, including custodial and adoption rights for children, Social Security benefits, and automatic durable power of attorney and hospital spousal rights.&lt;ref name="TFDASJ"&gt;{{cite book|last=Adams|first=Maurianne |author2=Bell, Lee Anne |author3=Griffin, Pat|title=Teaching for Diversity and Social Justice|publisher=Routledge|year=2007|edition=2|chapter=Appendix 9H|isbn=0-415-95200-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Research and measurements ==

===Measurements===

Psychologists have aimed to measure heterosexism using various methods. One particular method involves the use of a [[Likert scale]].  However, since heterosexism is perceived as something that is unseen it is difficult to determine if someone is heterosexist based on a [[Self-report study|self-report method.]] Researchers, thus, have constructed implicit measurements of heterosexism. An example of this would be an [[Implicit Association Test]]. A popular implicit association test measuring heterosexism that is open to the public is a virtual laboratory called [https://implicit.harvard.edu/implicit/ Project Implicit].

One limitation present in research on heterosexism is that there often isn’t a distinction between homophobia and heterosexism. Individuals are more likely to be aware of homophobic tendencies rather than heterosexist views, thus, researchers often measure homophobia instead of heterosexism.&lt;ref&gt;Herek, G. M. (2000). The psychology of sexual prejudice. Current Directions in Psychological Science, 9(1): 19-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Research===

Research on heterosexism has focused on variables that may affect views of heterosexism. For instance, in a study by psychologist, [[Gregory M. Herek]], it was found that there was a gender difference between heterosexual attitudes toward lesbians and gay men.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"&gt;Herek, G. M. (1988). Heterosexual's attitudes toward lesbians and gay men: Correlates and gender differences. Journal of Sex Research. 25(4): 451-477.&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, the study reveals that heterosexual individuals all seem to have some heterosexist tendency, however, heterosexual males have a greater tendency than heterosexual females to exhibit negative attitudes towards non-heterosexual individuals (this includes gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals). Another notable finding of Herek's study was that heterosexual males showed a greater tendency to demonstrate hostility towards gay men rather than lesbians.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"/&gt; Other factors that Herek acknowledges to contribute to heterosexism include individual differences, religiosity, conforming to social norms, [[right-wing authoritarianism]], customs and beliefs regarding cultural tradition, and personal experience with non-heterosexual individuals.&lt;ref name="Herek, G. M. 1988"/&gt; Research has also recognized the effects of level of education on views of heterosexism.&lt;ref name="Wright L. W. 1999"&gt;Wright L. W., Jr., Adams, H. E., &amp; Bernat, J. (1999). Development and validation of the Homophobia scale. Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment, 21(4): 337-347.&lt;/ref&gt; Wright et al. revealed that higher levels of education, or having more years of education, is related to less homophobic tendencies.&lt;ref name="Wright L. W. 1999"/&gt;

===Implicit or hidden===
This form of heterosexism operates through invisibility, under-representation, and [[wikt:erasure|erasure]]. It includes:
* Lack or under-representation of homosexual or bisexual people in advertising to the general public;
* Censorship of homosexual or bisexual characters, themes, and issues in works of art, literature, entertainment; ''see also [[Postcards from Buster#Controversial episodes|"Sugar Time" episode of Postcards from Buster]]''
* Exclusion of historical and political figures’ and celebrities’ homosexuality or bisexuality; their portrayal as heterosexuals;
* Complete avoidance of mentioning these people and their positive contributions particularly in news media;
* In the context of sex education or professional advice, referring only to opposite-sex partners when discussing female or male [[sexual attraction]] and activity;
* Silence on issues affecting homosexual and bisexual people at school or work or absence of their discussion in a positive light;
* Implementation and use of [[content-control software]] (censorware) to filter out information and websites that focus on homosexuality or bisexuality;
* [[Postal censorship]] and border control or customs seizure of publications deemed obscene solely on the basis of them containing material related to homosexuality even when they contain no erotic or pornographic material; ''see also [[Little Sister's Book and Art Emporium]]''
* Work environments that tacitly require gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals not to reveal their sexual orientation via discussion of their relationship status while heterosexuals can discuss their relationships and [[marital status]] freely;
* At public libraries or bookstores: rejection, removal or destruction of [[Homosexuality in children's literature|books]] (e.g. ''[[Jenny lives with Eric and Martin]]''), films, and posters with homosexual themes;
* Refusal to include families headed by [[Same-sex parenting|same-sex parents]] at school events or to represent such family diversity in school curricula; ''see also [[anti-bias curriculum]]'';
* Coercive or forced [[sex reassignment surgery]] on gay men, lesbian women, and bisexuals – an issue addressed in [[Tanaz Eshaghian]]'s 2008 documentary, ''[[Be Like Others]]''. ''See also: [[LGBT rights in Iran]]''

== Effects ==

Heterosexism causes a range of effects on people of any sexual orientation. However, the main effects of heterosexism are marginalization, and anti-LGBT violence and abuse.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

=== Marginalization ===
{{unreferenced section|date=April 2017}}

The main effect of heterosexism is the [[marginalization]] of gay men, lesbians, and bisexuals within society. Heterosexism has led to [[Social stigma|stigmatization]] and persecution of not only these people but also those of other [[sexual diversity]] such as transgender, and transsexual people. Along with [[homophobia]], [[lesbophobia]], and [[internalized homophobia]], heterosexism continues to be a significant social reality that compels people to conceal their homosexual or bisexual orientation, or metaphorically, to remain in [[Closeted|the closet]] in an effort to [[Passing (sexual orientation)|pass]] for heterosexual.

Marginalization also occurs when marriage rights are heterosexist. More specifically, when marriage rights are exclusive to opposite-sex couples, all same-sex couples, be they gay, lesbian, straight or mixed, are prevented from enjoying marriage’s corresponding legal privileges, especially those regarding property rights, health benefits, and child custody. Moreover, such limitation prevents same-sex couples from receiving the inherent social respect of marriage and its cultural symbolism.

=== Anti-LGBT violence and abuse ===

Yolanda Dreyer, professor of practical theology at [[University of Pretoria]], has claimed that "Heterosexism leads to prejudice, discrimination, harassment, and [[Violence against LGBT people|violence]].  It is driven by fear and hatred (Dreyer 5)."&lt;ref&gt;Dreyer, Yolanda. "Hegemony and the Internalisation of Homophobia Caused by Heteronormativity." Department of Practical Theology. 2007. University of Pretoria.5 May 2008 [www.up.ac.za/dspace/bitstream/2263/2741/1/Dreyer_Hegemony(2007).pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Along the same lines, forensic psychologist Karen Franklin explains violence caused by heterosexism toward both men and women, regardless of their sexual orientations:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]hrough heterosexism, any male who refuses to accept the dominant culture's assignment of appropriate masculine behavior is labeled early on as a "[[Sissy#Pejorative|sissy]]" or "[[Fag (slang)|fag]]" and then subjected to [[bullying]]. Similarly, any woman who opposes male dominance and control can be labeled a lesbian and attacked. The potential of being ostracized as homosexual, regardless of actual sexual attractions and behaviors, puts pressure on all people to conform to a narrow standard of appropriate gender behavior, thereby maintaining and reinforcing our society's hierarchical gender structure.&lt;ref name="Franklin"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another form of heterosexist violence as [[social control]] that most often targets lesbian women is [[corrective rape]]: a [[gang rape]] of a lesbian to "cure" her of her same-sex attractions. A notorious example from South Africa is the corrective rape and murder of [[Eudy Simelane]], [[LGBT social movements|LGBT-rights]] activist and member of the [[South Africa women's national football team|women's national football team]].&lt;ref name="guardian120309"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/mar/12/eudy-simelane-corrective-rape-south-africa|title=Raped and killed for being a lesbian: South Africa ignores 'corrective' attacks|last=Kelly|first=Annie|date=12 March 2009|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=2009-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a Frontline article titled Inside the Mind of People Who Hate Gays, bias-related violence against homosexuals is believed to be widespread in the United States, with perpetrators typically described by victims as young men in groups who assault targets of convenience. Victims accounts suggest that assailants possess tremendous rage and hatred; indeed, documentation of horrific levels of brutality has led gay activists to characterize the violence as political terrorism aimed at all gay men and lesbians. Other motives for antigay violence suggested in the literature include male bonding, proving heterosexuality, and purging secret homosexual desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Roots Of Homophobia - Inside The Mind Of People Who Hate Gays {{!}} Assault On Gay America {{!}} FRONTLINE {{!}} PBS|url = https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/shows/assault/roots/franklin.html|website = www.pbs.org|accessdate = 2015-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On singing duo [[Romanovsky and Phillips]]' album ''Be Political, Not Polite'', the song "When Heterosexism Strikes" discusses possible actions in response to example cases of heterosexism. ([http://www.romanovskyandphillips.com/politicallyrics.htm#hetero lyrics])

According to an article in the Howard Journal of Communications, some LGBT individuals have responded to heterosexism through direct confrontation and communication, or through the removal of self from the hostile environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last = Camara|first = Sakile K.|date = December 2012|title = Heterosexism in Context: Qualitative Interaction Effects of Co-Cultural Responses|url =|journal = Howard Journal of Communications|doi =|pmid =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Policy Debate}}
In [[policy debate]], '''impact calculus''' is a type of argumentation which seeks to compare the impacts presented by both teams.

==Basic impact calculus==
There are three basic types of impact calculus that compare the impacts of the plan to the impacts of a disadvantage:
;Probability (one impact is more likely)
:e.g. Economic collapse is more probable than an outbreak of [[grey goo]], therefore the ''risk'' of economic collapse outweighs the risk of a grey goo disaster.
;Timeframe (one impact will happen faster)
:e.g. An [[asteroid]] impact will cause extinction before [[Global warming]] will, therefore an asteroid impact outweighs Global Warming.
;Magnitude (one impact is bigger)
:e.g. Nuclear war kills more people than car accidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docslide.us/documents/impact-calculus-position.html|title=Impact Calculus Position}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other types of impact calculus==
Some other more sophisticated arguments are also considered impact calculus:
;Impact inclusivity (one impact is inclusive of the other)
:e.g. Global war is inclusive of a Taiwan war, therefore global war outweighs Taiwan war.
;X creates Y (one impact causes the other impact to happen)
:e.g. War causes genocide, therefore war outweighs genocide
;Internal link shortcircuiting (one impact prevents a (positive) impact from happening)
:e.g. Nuclear war halts space colonization, therefore nuclear war outweighs space colonization
;Reversibility
:e.g. Civil liberties lost in the name of security during a time of crisis can be restored later, but deaths caused by a lack of security are irreversible.

Framework arguments can also be considered impact calculus. Arguments as to why the [[judge (policy debate)|judge]] should adopt a [[utilitarianism|utilitarian]] or [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] perspective or conversely a [[deontology|deontological]] perspective may change the way they compare impacts.

==Impact calculus and "new" arguments==
Basic impact calculus arguments may be made at any time and are generally not considered "new" arguments, even if brought up for the first time in the [[Structure of policy debate|2NR or 2AR]]. More sophisticated forms of impact calculus should generally be brought up earlier in the debate and evidenced if possible.{{cn|date=November 2016}}

'''International Publishers''' is a book publishing company based in New York City specializing in [[Marxism|Marxist]] works of [[economics]], [[political science]], and [[history]].

==Company history==

===Establishment===
[[File:Trachtenberg-Alexander-22.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Alexander Trachtenberg in a picture taken in Moscow in the Fall of 1922.]]
International Publishers Company, Inc., was founded in 1924 with funds given the project by [[A. A. Heller]].  Heller was the radical son of a wealthy jeweler doing business in [[Paris]].&lt;ref name="Tracht4882"&gt;Trachtenberg, Testimony to the House Special Committee, September 13, 1939, pg. 4882.&lt;/ref&gt; He expanded his fortune as head of the International Oxygen Company, a [[welding]] supply company that operated a trade concession in Soviet Russia during the time of the [[New Economic Policy]] in the early 1920s.&lt;ref&gt;Trachtenberg, Testimony to the House Special Committee, September 13, 1939, pg. 4882-4883.&lt;/ref&gt; A lifelong socialist, Heller had previously been a heavy financial donor to the ''[[New York Call]],'' the Socialist Party's New York daily newspaper.  He had been instrumental in funding the purchase of the headquarters building for the [[Rand School of Social Science]].&lt;ref&gt;Trachtenberg, Testimony to the House Special Committee, September 13, 1939, pg. 4883-4884.&lt;/ref&gt;

The company began with a capital stock of $50,000, paid in by Heller, with the stock subsequently split with Trachtenberg as compensation.&lt;ref name="DiesAp9"&gt;Special Committee on Un-American Activities, US House of Representatives, ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activities in the United States: Appendix — Part IX, Second Section.'' Washington: US Government Printing Office, 1944; pg. 847.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Trachtenberg]], a left wing member of the [[Socialist Party of America]] associated with the [[Rand School of Social Science]] and its publishing house, who joined the Communist movement at the end of 1921, served as manager of International Publishers from its inception through the 1940s.&lt;ref name="DiesAp9" /&gt;

According to testimony before the [[United States Congress|U.S. Congress]] by Trachtenberg, in addition to his initial $50,000 investment, Heller continually made up losses incurred by International Publishers during its first 15 years. Over that period, his investment climbed to a total of some $115,000.&lt;ref name="Tracht4882" /&gt;

The idea of forming International Publishers seems to have come from Heller and Trachtenberg.  Initial assistance came from the Communist Party (then the [[Workers Party of America]]), limited to supplying advice and addresses of radical bookstores around America.&lt;ref name="Dozenberg"&gt;Nicholas Dozenberg, [https://archive.org/details/EstablishingInternationalPublishers "Establishing International Publishers,"] letter to Alexander Trachtenberg, June 19, 1924. Corvallis, OR: 1000 Flowers Publishers, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter dated June 1924 from the party's head Literature Department, [[Nicholas Dozenberg]], cautioned Trachtenberg that [[Charles H. Kerr &amp; Co.]] of Chicago had already published many standard titles by [[Karl Marx]], thus limiting the prospects of successful new editions of the same works.&lt;ref name="Dozenberg" /&gt; Instead, Dozenberg encouraged Trachtenberg to concentrate on "books not yet published in English written by popular Russian writers like [[V.I. Lenin|Lenin]], [[Grigory Zinoviev|Zinoviev]], [[Karl Radek|Radek]], and others."&lt;ref name="Dozenberg" /&gt;

===Development===
[[File:InternationalCatalog-1935.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cover of the 1935 International Publishers annual book catalog.]]
In the fall of 1935, International Publishers launched a new program called the "[[Book Union]]." This was a radical book-buying circle, modeled on the [[Book of the Month Club]].&lt;ref name="AppIX"&gt;Special Committee on Un-American Activities, ''Investigation of Un-American Propaganda Activity in the United States: Appendix — Part IX, First Section.'' Washington: US Government Printing Office, 1944; pp. 588-591.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Book Union first offered an anthology entitled ''Proletarian Literature in the United States'', nearly 400 pages long and edited by current or future editors of ''[[The New Masses]]'':  [[Mike Gold|Michael Gold]], [[Granville Hicks]], Joseph North,&lt;ref&gt;

The Book Union obliged members to buy 2 of 12 selections during the year.&lt;ref name="AppIX" /&gt;  Purchase of four books in a year entitled members to a bonus premium.&lt;ref name="AppIX" /&gt;  Despite its aggressively low pricing, the Book Union proved less successful than the [[Left Book Club]] operated by [[Victor Gollancz Ltd]] in England and seems to have been terminated after just a few years.

===1939 Dies Committee===
On September 13, 1939, International Publishers Secretary and Treasurer Alexander Trachtenberg was called before the so-called [[Dies Committee]] of the US House of Representatives, the Special Committee to Investigate Un-American Activities.  Committee members grilled Tractenberg on his own history, the sources of funding behind International Publishers, and the company's relationship to the Communist Party.  Trachtenberg characterized the relationship of International Publishers to the Communist Party as merely one of "buyer and seller."&lt;ref&gt;Trachtenberg, Testimony to the House Special Committee, September 13, 1939, pg. 4875.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trachtenberg indicated that International Publishers did not own presses but used the services of a company called Van Rees Press on a contract basis.&lt;ref&gt;Trachtenberg, Testimony to the House Special Committee, September 13, 1939, pg. 4870.&lt;/ref&gt;  The firm also exchanged printed sheets for publication with its British sister organization, [[Lawrence &amp; Wishart]], and bought sheets for binding from the forerunner of the official [[Foreign Languages Publishing House (Soviet Union)|Foreign Languages Publishing House]] in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;Trachtenberg, Testimony to the House Special Committee, September 13, 1939, pp. 4871-4872.&lt;/ref&gt;  He estimated that some 10% of International Publishers' books had made use of such sources but that a lowering of [[import duty|duty]] rates on bound books had largely eliminated the economy of importing unbound sheets.&lt;ref&gt;Trachtenberg, Testimony to the House Special Committee, September 13, 1939, pp. 4872-4873.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trachtenberg estimated annual sales by International Publishers at $75,000 to $80,000.  He noted that the company had a staff of four.&lt;ref&gt;Trachtenberg, Testimony to the House Special Committee, September 13, 1939, pg. 4908.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Recent years===
During the 1960s and 1970s, International expanded its publication of inexpensive [[Paperback#Trade paperback|trade paperback]] books under the title "New World Paperbacks." A number of titles bore this as an alternative company logo.

==Important publications==
International Publishers has been party to the publication of a number of titles of lasting scholarly importance.

During the 1920s, International Publishers produced the first English-language editions of important works on Marxist theory by [[Karl Kautsky]] (''Foundations of Christianity,'' 1925; ''Are the Jews a Race?'' 1926; ''Thomas More and His Utopia,'' 1927), [[Leon Trotsky]] (''Literature and Revolution,'' 1925; ''Wither England?'' 1925; ''Wither Russia?'' 1926), [[Nikolai Bukharin]] (''Historical Materialism,'' 1925, ''The Economic Theory of the Leisure Class,'' 1927; ''Imperialism and World Economy,'' 1929); and [[Joseph Stalin]] (''Leninism,'' 1928).

International Publishers worked in conjunction with the [[Marx-Engels-Lenin Institute]] in [[Moscow]] on three separate publishing initiatives involving the works of [[V.I. Lenin]]: an aborted ''Collected Works'' project begun in 1927;&lt;ref&gt;About a dozen volumes were produced as part of this series, including V.I. Lenin, [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no%3A408929&amp;qt=advanced&amp;dblist=638 ''Materialism and Empirio-criticism.''] New York: International Publishers, 1927.&lt;/ref&gt; a 12-volume ''Selected Works'' project issued 1934-1938 in green bindings;&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Lenin, [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no%3A261178342&amp;qt=advanced&amp;dblist=638 ''Selected Works.''] In 12 volumes. New York: International Publishers, 1934-1938.&lt;/ref&gt; and a revised, 12-volume ''Selected Works'' edition published in blue bindings in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;V.I. Lenin, [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no%3A261179442&amp;qt=advanced&amp;dblist=638 ''Selected Works.''] In 12 volumes. New York: International Publishers, 1943.&lt;/ref&gt;  International also joined with the [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party of Great Britain's]] publishing house, [[Lawrence and Wishart]] and [[Progress Publishers]] (Moscow) to publish the massive, 50-volume [[Marx/Engels Collected Works|''Collected Works'']] of Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, a project launched in 1975 and completed only in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Marx and Frederick Engels, [http://www.worldcat.org/search?q=no%3A1007861&amp;qt=advanced&amp;dblist=638 ''Collected Works.''] In 50 volumes. New York: International Publishers, 1975-2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

International Publishers was an early reissuer of [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed's]] legendary chronicle of the Russian Revolution, ''[[Ten Days That Shook the World]].'' Originally published by [[Boni &amp; Liveright]] in 1919, an International Publishers edition came out in 1926 and — except for a time during the reign of [[Joseph Stalin]], when the book fell out of official favor — it has been a mainstay of the publishing house's catalog ever since.

International Publishers has also published a considerable number of memoir accounts by leading Communist Party participants, including those of [[Bill Haywood|William "Big Bill" Haywood]] (1929), [[Nadezhda Krupskaya]] (1930), [[William Z. Foster]] (two volumes, 1937 and 1930), [[Ella Reeve Bloor]] (1940), [[Joseph North (writer)|Joseph North]] (1958), [[W.E.B. Du Bois]] (1968), [[Benjamin J. Davis]] (1969), [[John Williamson (Communist)|John Williamson]] (1969), [[William L. Patterson]] (1971), [[Hosea Hudson]] (1972), [[Elizabeth Gurley Flynn]] (reissue, 1973), [[Art Shields]] (two volumes, 1983 and 1986), [[Gil Green (politician)|Gil Green]] (1984) and [[Angela Davis]] (paperback reissue, 1988).

International Publishers was also a frequent publisher of prolific labor historian [[Philip S. Foner]] and published his landmark, 10-volume ''History of the Labor Movement in the United States'' (1947&amp;ndash;1994) as well as his massive five-volume collection  ''The Life and Writings of Frederick Douglass'' (1950&amp;ndash;1975).  The company also published the work of [[Herbert Aptheker]], a historian specializing in [[African-American]] history.

==Key ideas==

===Bystander approach===
Katz advocates the bystander approach to gender violence and bullying prevention.&lt;ref name="Cornblatt"&gt;{{Cite web |first = Johannah |last = Cornblatt | title = Bystanders No More: Teaching Kids to Respond to Violent Crime |url= http://www.thedailybeast.com/newsweek/blogs/the-human-condition/2009/10/30/bystanders-no-more-teaching-kids-to-respond-to-violent-crime.html |work = Newsweek Online |date = October 30, 2009 |accessdate= April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead of focusing on women as victims and men as perpetrators of harassment, abuse or violence, the bystander approach concentrates on the role of peers in schools, groups, teams, workplaces and other social units.{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=116}}{{sfn|Katz|1995|p=165}}

In 2009, after an alleged gang rape in Richmond, California where two dozen teenagers watched and did nothing, Newsweek online reported that, "a small but growing group of educators is trying to bring what's called 'bystander education' to American schools. While sexual violence prevention programs have typically focused on the victim (discouraging women from walking alone at night, for example) or the perpetrator (reiterating the fact that no means no), the bystander approach emphasizes the role witnesses can play in either supporting or challenging violence."&lt;ref name="Cornblatt"/&gt;

Katz and his colleagues developed one of the first bystander initiatives, the mixed-gender Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) program, in 1993 at Northeastern University’s Center for the Study of Sport in Society.  “Most people think they only have two choices for intervention,” says Katz. “One is to intervene physically right at the point of attack, and the other is to do nothing. And that’s a false set of choices.” As part of the MVP program, students sit in a classroom and talk about the menu of options—from getting a group of friends together to calling 911—available to them. At the heart of the program is a set of scenarios that allow students to imagine what they might do in a variety of situations. Each scenario comes with a list of viable interventions for bystanders.&lt;ref name="Cornblatt"/&gt;

According to Newsweek, research is still needed to determine the effectiveness of bystander-awareness programs in schools, but the initial results are promising. One study found that after the Sioux City School District in Iowa implemented the MVP program, the number of freshman boys who said they could help prevent violence against women and girls increased by 50 percent.&lt;ref name="Cornblatt"/&gt;

The bystander programs that have proliferated in recent years on college and high school campuses and in the U.S. military involve both sexes and draw from various violence prevention theories and educational practices.  The MVP model was influenced by basic tenets of social justice education.   This approach is partly based on the premise that men’s silence in the face of other men’s abusive or violent behavior gives "implicit consent" to such behavior.{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=116}}{{sfn|Katz|1995|p=168}}

The MVP bystander approach frames men’s abuse of women as a societal problem whose roots lie in the institutional structures and cultural practices of a male-dominated society. [24]  Thus, the MVP approach emphasizes changing social norms as the key to prevention.{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=116}}{{sfn|Katz|1995|p=168}} By challenging men to speak up and “[change] group dynamics in male peer culture,”{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=117}}this bystander model empowers men to step outside of the victim/perpetrator binary{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=115}} and gives men an opportunity to talk about some of the “dynamics of their interpersonal and group interaction in a safe space.”{{sfn|Katz|2006|p=125}}

==Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) Model==
Jackson Katz presented the Mentors in Violence Prevention (MVP) model hoping to put the focus on men to discontinue trends of violent masculinity through creating a model that would invite men into the critical dialogue, instead of painting them as perpetrators or potential perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jackson, H. Alan Heisterkamp, and Wm. Michael Fleming. "The Social Justice Roots of the Mentors in Violence Prevention Model and Its Application in a High School Setting." Violence Against Women 17.6 (2011): 684-686.&lt;/ref&gt; Katz realized that there was a frustrating lack of inclusion of men and boys in the gender violence discussion, prompting him to create an education model that was inclusive to men and boys.

The original MVP model was created as workshops for all-male student athletes; Katz hoped that by working with male student athletes, they could help to stop the spread of ‘rape-supportive’ and ‘battering-supportive’ attitudes by speaking out against the masculine binary that supports gender violence. (Recon, 166) Katz says his initial focus on working with student-athletes stems from the “apathy, defensiveness—and sometimes outright hostility—of male athletic directors, coaches, and student-athletes...men and young men in the…athletic subculture…typically occupy a privileged position in school culture, and particularly in male peer culture.” &lt;ref name="Katz, Jackson 2013"&gt;Katz, Jackson. "MVP Strategies." MVP Strategies. N.p., n.d. Web. 21 Nov. 2013. &lt;http://www.jacksonkatz.com/aboutmvp.html&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; This is a step towards the bystander approach. By working with boys who typically represented the popular part of school culture, Katz was hoping that these boys would then influence the people around them and in their schools in similar manners. It was important for Katz to ensure that MVP considers male student-athletes as potential mentors for younger kids, able of providing male leadership necessary to stop gender abuse.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jackson. "Reconstructing Masculinity in the Locker Room: the Mentors in Violence Prevention Project." Harvard Educational Review 65.2 (1995): 166.&lt;/ref&gt;

Katz’s model generally revolves around simulation and role-playing, as well as large discussion-based group meetings both consisting same-sex and different-sex students.  As a part of his college initiative, his MVP model involves “holding three 90-minute sessions each year with each participating college team. A fourth session is scheduled for those student-athletes who wish to be trained further for work with younger students in middle and high school.” &lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jackson. "Reconstructing Masculinity in the Locker Room: the Mentors in Violence Prevention Project." Harvard Educational Review 65.2 (1995): 167.&lt;/ref&gt; These workshops are designed to provide spaces for boys to discuss with each other the concept of masculinity and its definition, as well as its relation to  gender abuse and violence. Additionally, Katz recognizes the role of those in positions of authority in schools and athletic teams. As his program has grown and evolved, he has included training of selected male and professional staff working in all sectors of schools and colleges.&lt;ref&gt;Katz, Jackson. "Reconstructing Masculinity in the Locker Room: the Mentors in Violence Prevention Project." Harvard Educational Review 65.2 (1995): 170.&lt;/ref&gt;) In this, he is hoping that the top-down approach will provide role models for young and impressionable students and athletes who are looking for good representation. If these school leaders are able to use their positions of authority as positions of good influence, it will perhaps encourage a change in paradigm that will affect all of those in the school or community.

The MVP model originally focused on just male student-athletes. Since, the MVP model has expanded its target audience and educational group to “boys and girls, men and women, working together and in single-sex formats…by the mid-1990’s MVP had moved from a near-exclusive focus on the athletic world to general populations of high school and college students, and other institutional settings.” &lt;ref name="Katz, Jackson 2013"/&gt; This expansion means that the dialogue around gender abuse and gender binaries is spreading throughout schools across the nation. More frank and honest talk about gender abuse will not only remove many of the stigmas from those who are abused, but will also encourage students to act out and speak out in defense of themselves and each other.

===Media literacy and masculinities===
In his writings, public lectures, and films, Katz argues that gendered understandings and behavior in every arena from interpersonal relationships to the workplace and even politics are influenced by media and popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last1 = Katz |first1= Jackson |last2= Jhally |first2= Sut |title= Manhood on the Mat: The problem is not that pro wrestling makes boys violent.

Katz further maintains that in spite of variability due to such categories as class, race and ethnicity, "violence in America is overwhelmingly a gendered phenomenon," shaped by "cultural codes and ideals of masculinity and manhood."&lt;ref name=wcw/&gt; He argues that "masculinity" and "femininity" are socially constructed categories, and thus the "disturbing equation of masculinity with pathological control and violence" that currently exists in America is not genetically predetermined and can be changed.&lt;ref name="Earp 1999 5"&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.mediaed.org/assets/products/211/studyguide_211.pdf |first1= Jeremy |last1= Earp |last2= Katz |first2= Jackson |title = Violence, Media &amp; The Crisis In Masculinity Study Guide |publisher = Media Education Foundation |year = 1999|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the "Tough Guise" study guide, co-written with the video producer Jeremy Earp of the Media Education Foundation, Katz underscores his motivation for promoting media literacy: "By looking critically at how institutions – from media outlets to political institutions to our schools – often play a role in reinforcing constricted, regressive notions of manhood that maintain an unacceptably violent status quo, we might begin to clear some space for individuals, male and female, to live freer lives."&lt;ref name="Earp 1999 5"/&gt;

===Presidential masculinities===
Katz's work on images of masculinity in media extends to his examination of "a crucial but barely explored topic of cultural studies analysis: the role of media culture in the construction of presidential masculinity."&lt;ref name="Earp 1999 5"/&gt;  Katz posits that "media have become the single most important source of political information and persuasion," and that "education for democracy in this era requires citizens to be media literate."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=539}}

According to Katz, part of being politically media literate means understanding how gender functions as a sub-textual force in presidential politics. He asks questions such as "how does the perceived 'manliness' or 'toughness' of political candidates affect their electoral success? To what degree is the gender gap in presidential politics affected by men's gendered identities and sense of themselves as men, which itself is reinforced by media discourses and portrayals? How does paid political advertising on television – by far the biggest expenditure of funds in presidential campaigns – shape voters' perceptions of the relative 'manliness' of candidates? What are the similarities and differences between how women and men ascertain whether male political figures measure up to the 'masculine ideal' that is circulating in media culture at a given historical moment? Which mediated (white) masculine styles or archetypes have been politically successful over the past fifty years, and why?"{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=554}}

In an article about the [[Barack Obama]]-[[Hillary Clinton]] race for the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|Democratic presidential nomination in 2008]], Katz responded to [[pundit]]s and other political observers who decried the media focus on race and gender when other crucial issues loomed. "Presidential elections are always about race and gender. The reason people are talking about them now is that a black man and a (white) woman are serious contenders for a major party nomination. Their success is making visible what historically has been hidden in plain sight."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=554}}

"Campaigns for the U.S. presidency in the era of mass media," he wrote, "always turn on the personality and style of candidates, their skills at televisual performance, their race and gender, and how all of these interact with questions of national identity at a given historical moment. The biggest difference this time is that the Democratic nominee will not embody and hence reinforce the dominant position of white masculinity in the race/gender system."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=539, 543}}

Katz further maintained that, "Presidential contests until now have been contests between men. Men were the gender that mattered. No matter how qualified by intelligence, leadership ability or experience, women were not seriously considered for the top job in government, and everyone knew it. Their gender prevented people from seeing them as 'presidential.' If there is one thing that truly represents 'change' in this historic election season it is the change in what it means to appear 'presidential.'   In the past, whether a candidate was a Republican or Democrat, conservative, centrist or liberal, their race and gender were predetermined. They were inevitably – and invariably – white and a man.”{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=539, 543}}

For Katz, violence also plays an important role in shaping political discourse and in the voters' choice of whom to support for president. "How much of the white male vote is determined by impressions about the relative 'manliness' or 'toughness' of candidates or political parties hasn’t been quantified," Katz writes. "But there is no doubt that for several decades violence—both our individual and collective vulnerability to it, and questions about when and how to use the violent power of the state to protect the 'national interest' — has been an ominous and omnipresent factor in numerous foreign policy and domestic political issues (e.g. the Cold War, Vietnam, the 'War on Terror,' and the invasion of Iraq, as well as gun control, and executive, legislative and judicial responses to violent crime)."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=539, 543}}

In several articles, Katz analyzes and comments on "the pervasive use of sports metaphors in presidential discourse and how the language of sport functions to construct a masculine ideal for leadership at the heights of political power."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.huffingtonpost.com/jackson-katz/the-hidden-race-and-gende_b_88580.html |first = Jackson |last = Katz |title = The Hidden Race and Gender Factor in Presidential Campaigns |work = Huffington Post |date = February 26, 2008 |accessdate= March 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He points out that "the two most 'metaphorically influential' sports in presidential campaign rhetoric are boxing and football... not coincidentally, both are violent sports that attract a disproportionate percentage of male participants and fans."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=540}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://voicemalemagazine.org/pdfs/voice_male_winter_09.pdf |first = Jackson | last = Katz | title = Sports Metaphors in Politics: Time to Punt? |publisher = VoiceMale Magazine |date = Winter 2009 |page = 15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The frequent use of boxing and football metaphors in political discourse did not cause violence to become an important force in our politics, but this usage is one measure of how presidential campaigns in the mass media era are less about policy differences and complex political agendas than they are about the selling of a certain kind of executive masculinity, embodied until the historic 2008 election in a particular white man whom the public comes to know largely through television and other technologies of mass communication."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=547}}

Katz also comments on implications for female candidates. He writes, "One of 2008 Republican vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin's most-quoted lines on the campaign trail in the fall of 2008 was 'The heels are on, the gloves are off,' which she typically delivered to wild cheers of approval. In coming years, when this historic campaign and those yet to come are analyzed, it will be particularly interesting to see how female and male voters respond to language where a woman throws the 'knockout punch.' Does this masculinize and thus help to make them more credible as potential commanders-in-chief? Or do women who are seen as 'too-aggressive' – even if only in a metaphorical sense – turn voters off? What are the differences between how the sexes view a woman 'throwing punches' if she's a conservative (like Palin) or a liberal feminist (like Hillary Clinton?)."{{sfn|Katz|2009|p=548}}

== Career ==

=== 1979 Student Protest Arrest at India Gate ===
Jay Mala as the President of Indian Student Congress in 1979 led thousands of university students in protest against the [[Janata Party]] government at [[India Gate]], New Delhi. Then minister of external affairs and future prime minister [[Atal Bihari Vajpayee]] attempted to address the angry crowd but was pelted with stones. While bleeding from the head he was protected by Jay Mala, who led him to escape into the neighbouring Parliament building. In the aftermath of the protests Vajpayee personally secured the release of Jay Mala from [[Parliament Street, New Delhi|Parliament Street]] Police Station.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Jay Mala vs. Home Secretary, Government of Jammu and Kashmir ===
In 1982 she won a case against the Government of Jammu and Kashmir in the Supreme Court. Jay Mala, acting as a legal aid advocate, secured the release of Riaz Ahmed, proving he was still a minor when he was falsely imprisoned in Jammu and Kashmir.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/203168/|title=Jaya Mala vs Home Secretary, Government Of ... on 29 July, 1982|last=Bhagwati|first=P|date=29 July 1982|website=Indian Kanoon|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chief justice [[P. N. Bhagwati]] quashed the detention stating the prisoner was a school boy protesting for student rights and not as the police had falsely accused him of being an adult threatening grievous bodily harm armed with a knife.

The case set precedent in India for determining the age of a minor detainee. The judges established that a two years margin of error be applied in judicial proceedings to radiological and orthopaedic test results used to determine age in favor of the accused.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://irgu.unigoa.ac.in/drs/bitstream/handle/unigoa/4631/ferrao_r_b_2013.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y|title=Enforcing Child Laws and Juvenile Justice in Goa|last=Ferrao|first=Ranjana Beverly|date=May 2013|website=|publisher=Goa University|page=232|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The case has been continuously quoted for three decades to secure the release of minors across India,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/313664/|title=Parvez Quadar Khan vs Union Of India (Uoi) And Anr|last=|first=|date=17 January 1990|website=Indian Kannon|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-20|quote="Learned counsel for the petitioner then contended that since in the case of Jaya Mala v.

=== 1983 Jammu and Kashmir General Elections ===
She co-founded the Panthers Party in 1982, that contested all seats in the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 1983|1983 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly elections]]. Jay Mala stood in the [[Udhampur]] constituency as the only female candidate against sixteen other men. She came third with 3,768 votes (13.75%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/SE_1983/StatisticalReport_JK_1983.pdf|title=Statistical Report on General Election, 1983 to the Legislative Assembly of Jammu &amp; Kashmir|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Election Commission of India|page=93|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She polled the second most votes out of all women candidates in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/SR_KeyHighLights/SE_1983/StatisticalReport_JK_1983.pdf|title=Key Highlights of General Election to the Legislative Assembly of Jammu &amp; Kashmir|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Election Commission of India|page=8|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only seven females had contested out of a total 512 candidates.

=== Bhim Singh, MLA vs State of J&amp;K ===
In 1984 her husband Bhim Singh, an elected opposition member, was illegally arrested and hidden by the police while en route from [[Jammu]] for a debate at the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly]] in [[Srinagar]] scheduled for 11 September, where his vote may have been crucial.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Jay Mala filed a case against the Government of Jammu and Kashmir, including then Chief Minister [[Ghulam Mohammad Shah]] as a respondent in order to find her husband and set him free.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://indiankanoon.org/doc/61710/|title=Bhim Singh vs State Of J&amp;K on 31 August, 1984|last=|first=|date=31 August 1984|website=Indian Kanoon|publisher=|access-date=2016-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Bhim Singh's release she was his advocate in suing the government for compensation. In a 1985 landmark judgement [[O. Chinnappa Reddy]] awarded her husband 50,000 rupees.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The order of the judgment as the first case for monetary compensation for false detainment, along with its high profile nature made it a quoted case in future litigations across India impacting law of tort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2sMwFTOrixwC&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=bhim+singh+compensation+case+kashmir&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Tqx6SAO7-q&amp;sig=wgCQWiSOTKSEK1v4JEsoKAlonI4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjs7ZDJqYLRAhVHWBQKHaE6B0UQ6AEILjAD#v=onepage&amp;q=bhim%20singh%20compensation%20case%20kashmir&amp;f=false|title=Human Rights from a Comparative and International Law Perspective|last=Church|first=Joan|last2=Schulze|first2=Christian|last3=Strydom|first3=Hennie|date=2007-01-01|publisher=Unisa Press|year=|isbn=9781868883615|location=|page=|pages=124–125|language=en|quote=As part of its remedial power, the Supreme Court directs the state to pay compensation. For further illustration the following cases can be mentioned.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the case judge Reddy also ruled on the politicized nature of her husband's false imprisonment, stating that the two police officers who acted with "mischievous or malicious intent" were mere subordinates and that he did "not have the slightest doubt that the responsibility lies elsewhere and with the higher echelons of the Government of Jammu and Kashmir."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://www.hrln.org/hrln/images/stories/pdf/prisoners%20rights%20volume%20ii.pdf|title=Prisoners' Rights Volume II|last=Sakhrani|first=Monica|publisher=[[Human Rights Law Network]]|year=December 2011|isbn=81-89479-77-6|location=New Delhi|pages=16-23, 327, 371-355|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1987 Jammu and Kashmir General Elections ===
In the [[Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly election, 1987|1987 Jammu and Kashmir Legislative Assembly elections]] she was a candidate from the [[Jammu]] East constituency. She came fourth out of 19 candidates with 634 votes (2.25%).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eci.nic.in/eci_main/StatisticalReports/SE_1987/StatisticalReport_jk_87.pdf|title=Statistical Report on General Election 1987 to Legislative Assembly of Jammu and Kashmir|last=|first=|date=|website=Election Commission of India|publisher=|access-date=1 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There were just 13 females out of a total 528 candidates in the general election.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8127">The [[Senate of Pakistan]] has a number of committees each of which handles a specific legislative area. The committee members usually have specialized knowledge or interest in the matters under their jurisdiction. The committees monitor government activities, identify issues suitable for legislative review, gather and evaluate information, and recommend courses of action to the Senate. The number of committees has gradually increased from six during [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]]'s government (1973–77) to fifty-two, as of 2017. There are several types of committee, with the majority (thirty) called the "standing committees" and others called "functional committee".

[[File:Graduation Hall MQ1.JPG|thumb|right|380px|The E7B Building Courtyard, now known as the ''Frederick Chong'' Courtyard, where the Macquarie science reform movement began. This building used to be the home of the school of Mathematics and Physics.]]

'''Macquarie science reform movement''' refers to the successful
transformation of the degree system at [[Macquarie University]] in 1979
which followed an academic and political campaign initiated in 1977.&lt;ref name=UNews&gt;F. J. Duarte, M. Golding, and B. Bulliman, Science degree, ''University News'' '''1''' (100) 16 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NDT&gt;Uni revolt simmers, ''Northern District Times'', 9 November 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH&gt;2000 seek introduction of science degree at Macquarie, 
''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 9 November 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

Macquarie University, founded in 1964, adopted a degree structure
modeled after the [[Oxbridge]] tradition where all graduating students
were awarded a BA regardless of their field of study, with the
exception of law students.

Many science students saw this as a disadvantage
and began to mobilize for reform of the degree structure.&lt;ref name=UNews /&gt;&lt;ref name=NDT /&gt; Thus, in
1977 a student organization, known as ''Students for a Science Degree''
(SSD), was formed with physicist [[F. J. Duarte|Frank Duarte]] as chairman. SSD enlisted the
support of science students,&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt; student politicians, science
academics, and professional science institutions.  

Among the senior science professors that openly supported the SSD led reform movement were
[[Ronald Ernest Aitchison|Ronald E. Aitchison]] (Electronics),  [[Frederick Chong]] (Mathematics), [[Brian F. Gray]] (Chemistry), [[John G. Hawke]] (Chemistry),
[[Richard Makinson|Richard E. B. Makinson]] (Physics), [[Ronald H. Vernon]] (Geophysics), and [[John Clive Ward|John C. Ward]] (Physics).  Support was particularly strong at the former school of Mathematics and Physics.

The BSc campaign lasted almost two years, and most of it is documented in the &lt;i&gt;Arena&lt;/i&gt; student newspaper.&lt;ref name=A77&gt;F. Duarte and B. Bulliman, A what from where?, ''Arena'' '''10'''(7), 1 (1977).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A78a&gt;F. Duarte and M. Brandt, BSc at Macquarie?, ''Arena'' '''11'''(9), 3 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A78b&gt;F. Duarte, What's been happening with the BSc, ''Arena'' '''11'''(11), 9 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A78c&gt;F. Duarte, The Macquarie outlook, ''Arena'' '''11'''(13), 5 (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=A79&gt;F. Duarte, AUS the redundant singularity, ''Arena'' '''12'''(1), 12 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt; In 1977 a front page newspaper article read: "A student revolt is underway at Macquarie University against an ''outmoded'' degree system."&lt;ref name=NDT /&gt; The campaign winded down only when the Academic Senate of Macquarie University approved, almost unanimously, a science degree (BSc) on 11 September 1979.&lt;ref name=SMH79&gt;C. Parfitt, Macquarie University approves BSc degree, 
''The Sydney Morning Herald'', 13 September 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;  
  
A perspective on the science reform movement is given in the book ''Liberality of Opportunity''&lt;ref name=M92&gt;B. Mansfield and M. Hutchinson, ''Liberality of Opportunity: A History of Macquarie University'' (Macquarie University, Sydney, 1992).&lt;/ref&gt; which was co-authored by Bruce Mansfield, a former professor of history and Deputy Vice-Chancellor of the University.  In this account it is subtly implied that the reform movement might have been under the tutelage of J. C. Ward:  "Ward was vocal in his denunciation of the trivia that filled up Senate agendas… suitably then, it was a close student associate of Ward’s, physics PhD student Frank Duarte, who began to mobilize student opinion in favor of a change."&lt;ref name=M92 /&gt; This suggestion of influence is not corroborated in any of the numerous contemporaneous articles on the subject.&lt;ref name=UNews /&gt;&lt;ref name=NDT /&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH /&gt;&lt;ref name=A77 /&gt;&lt;ref name=A78a /&gt;&lt;ref name=A78b /&gt;&lt;ref name=A78c /&gt;&lt;ref name=A79 /&gt;&lt;ref name=SMH79 /&gt;  Besides,  Ward’s own description of events states that:  "there arose quite spontaneously from the students themselves a demand that they be allowed to graduate as Bachelor of Science."&lt;ref name=W2004&gt;J. C. Ward, ''Memoirs of a Theoretical Physicist'' (Optics Journal, Rochester, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;  His account gives no hints of tutelage, or influence, on the student leadership, when "the sciences revolted."&lt;ref name=W2004 /&gt;   

In 1980, [[Greg Sheridan]] described the duel between the sciences and the Macquarie establishment as a "nasty, bitter bureaucratic struggle" won by the reformers and their allies.&lt;ref&gt;G. Sheridan, Australian physicist wins Guthrie Medal, ''The Bulletin'' '''101'''(5239), 49-50 (1980).&lt;/ref&gt; 

Back to the present: Macquarie University offers about ninety (90) named undergraduate degrees in addition to the original BSc introduced in 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[http://handbook.mq.edu.au/2018/DegreesDiplomas/UGDegrees Macquarie University Undergraduate Degrees and Diplomas]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Maltol''' is a naturally occurring [[organic compound]] that is used primarily as a [[flavor enhancer]].  It is found in the bark of [[larch]] tree, in [[pine]] needles, and in roasted [[malt]] (from which it gets its name).  It is a white crystalline powder that is soluble in hot water, chloroform, and other polar solvents.  Because it has the odor of cotton candy and caramel, maltol is used to impart a sweet aroma to fragrances.  Maltol's sweetness adds to the odor of freshly baked bread, and is used as a flavor enhancer (INS Number 636) in breads and cakes. It is not registered as a food additive in the EU and thus has no E-number.&lt;ref&gt;Official Journal of the European Union, Volume 54, November 12, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, maltol is registered as a flavor component in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;Official Journal of the European Union, Volume 55, October 2, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Maltol, like related 3-hydroxy-4-[[Pyrylium salt|pyrone]]s such as [[kojic acid]], binds to [[HSAB theory|hard]] metal centers such as Fe&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Ga&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, Al&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt;, and VO&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10162">A '''Maritime power''' is a nation with a very strong [[navy]], which often is also a [[great power]], or at least a [[regional power]]. A Maritime power is able to easily control their coast, and exert influence upon both nearby and far countries. A nation that dominates the world navally is known as a maritime [[superpower]].

==Maritime power==
===Emerging===
Many countries that become maritime powers, become strong in order to defend themselves from an extant threat, such as the [[USSR]] did during the [[Cold War]], in order to defend themselves from the [[United States Navy]]. In this scenario, it is common for the emerging maritime power to focus largely upon area denial tactics, rather than power projection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stephen Biddle on Strategy in the Western Pacific|url=http://www.maritime-executive.com/article/stephen-biddle-on-strategy-in-the-western-pacific|accessdate=5 April 2017|work=The Maritime Executive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Possible===

===Actual===
Maritime powers are often much more involved in global politics and trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Can Israel become a maritime power?|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/can-israel-become-a-maritime-power/|website=The Times of Israel|accessdate=4 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

==Historic Maritime powers==
*[[Republic of Venice]] dominated trade on the [[Mediterranean Sea]], including commerce between Europe and North Africa, as well as Asia.
*[[The British Empire]] was at one point both a [[Superpower]], or, as some political historians say, a [[Hyperpower]], alongside being a Maritime power.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
*[[Soviet Union]]. Although the USSR traditionally had a strong focus on land, a period of rapid naval expansion allowed them to dominate their area.&lt;ref name="WRTW"/&gt;

{{Nazism sidebar}}

The '''master race''' ({{lang-de|'''Herrenrasse'''}}, also referred to as {{Audio|De-herrenvolk.ogg|'''''Herrenvolk'''''}} "master people") is a concept in [[Nazism|Nazi]] ideology in which the putative [[Nordic race|Nordic]] or [[Aryan race]]s, predominant among [[Germans]] and other northern European peoples, are deemed the highest in racial hierarchy. Members of this alleged master race were referred to as '''''Herrenmenschen''''' ("master humans").

The Nazi official [[Alfred Rosenberg]] believed that the Nordic race was descended from [[Proto-Indo-Europeans|Proto-Aryans]], who he believed had [[Prehistory|prehistorically]] dwelt on the [[North German Plain]] and who had ultimately originated from the lost continent of [[Atlantis]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg, Alfred]], ''[[The Myth of the 20th Century]]''. The term ''Atlantis'' is mentioned two times in the whole book, the term ''Atlantis-hypothesis'' is mentioned just once. Rosenberg (page 24): "It seems to be not completely impossible, that at parts where today the waves of the Atlantic ocean murmur and icebergs move along, once a blossoming land towered in the water, on which a creative race founded a great culture and sent its children as seafarers and warriors into the world; but if this Atlantis-hypothesis proves untenable, we still have to presume a prehistoric Nordic cultural center." Rosenberg (page 26): "The ridiculed hypothesis about a Nordic creative center, which we can call Atlantis – without meaning a sunken island – from where once waves of warriors migrated to all directions as first witnesses of Nordic longing for distant lands to conquer and create, today becomes probable." Original: "''Es erscheint als nicht ganz ausgeschlossen, dass an Stellen, über die heute die Wellen des Atlantischen Ozeans rauschen und riesige Eisgebirge herziehen, einst ein blühendes Festland aus den Fluten ragte, auf dem eine schöpferische Rasse große, weitausgreifende Kultur erzeugte und ihre Kinder als Seefahrer und Krieger hinaussandte in die Welt; aber selbst wenn sich diese Atlantishypothese als nicht haltbar erweisen sollte, wird ein nordisches vorgeschichtliches Kulturzentrum angenommen werden müssen. ... Und deshalb wird die alte verlachte Hypothese heute Wahrscheinlichkeit, dass von einem nordischen Mittelpunkt der Schöpfung, nennen wir ihn, ohne uns auf die Annahme eines versunkenen atlantischen Erdteils festzulegen, die Atlantis, einst Kriegerschwärme strahlenförmig ausgewandert sind als erste Zeugen des immer wieder sich erneut verkörpernden nordischen Fernwehs, um zu erobern, zu gestalten.''"&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Nazis]] declared that the Nordics (now referred to as the [[Germanic peoples]]), or [[Aryan]]s as they sometimes called them, were superior to all other races. The Nazis believed they were entitled to expand territorially.&lt;ref name="hitler1925"&gt;[[Adolf Hitler|Hitler, Adolf]] ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' 1925&lt;/ref&gt; This concept is known as [[Nordicism]]. The actual policy that was implemented by the Nazis resulted in the [[Aryan certificate]], the one form of the official document that was required by the law for all citizens of the Reich was the "Lesser Aryan certificate" (''Kleiner Ariernachweis''), which could be obtained through an ''[[Ahnenpass]]'', which required the owner to trace her or his lineage through baptism, birth certificates or certified proof thereof that all grandparents were of "Aryan descent".

The [[Slavs]] (along with [[Romani people|Gypsies]] and [[Jews]]) were defined as being racially inferior and non-Aryan ''[[Untermenschen]]'', and were thus considered to be a danger to the "Aryan" or Germanic master race.{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=241}} According to the Nazi secret [[Hunger Plan]] and ''[[Generalplan Ost]]'', the Slavic population was to be removed from [[Central Europe]] through expulsion, enslavement, starvation, and extermination,{{sfn|Snyder|2010|pp=162–163, 416}} except for a small percentage who were deemed to be non-Slavic descendants of Germanic settlers, and thus suitable for [[Germanisation]].&lt;ref name = THE&gt;

==Historical background==
The ''[[Übermensch]]'' ([[German language|German]]) ("Overman" or "Superman") is a [[concept]] in the [[Philosophy of Friedrich Nietzsche|philosophy of]] [[Germans|German]] [[Philosophy|philosopher]] [[Friedrich Nietzsche]]—he posited the ''Übermensch'' as a goal for humanity to set for itself in his 1883 book ''[[Thus Spoke Zarathustra]]'' ({{lang-de|Also Sprach Zarathustra}}). However, Nietzsche never developed the concept on racial grounds. Instead, the ''Übermensch'' "seems to be the ideal aim of spiritual development more than a biological goal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solomon|first=Robert C.| authorlink = Robert C. Solomon|author2=Higgins, Kathleen M.| author2link = Kathleen Higgins|title=What Nietzsche Really Said|publisher=Schocken Books, a division of Random House, Inc.|year=2000|page=47|isbn=0-8052-4157-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazism distorted the real meaning behind the concept to fit its 'master race' view.

By the late 19th and early 20th centuries, it was posited that the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]]s (then generally also referred to as [[Aryan]]s) made up the highest branch of humanity because their civilization was the most technologically advanced. This reasoning simultaneously intertwined with [[Nordicism]] which proclaimed the "[[Nordic race]]" as the "purest" form of said [[Aryan race]].  Today, this view is regarded as [[scientific racism]] because it contradicts [[racial equality]] by positing that one [[Race (classification of human beings)|race]] is superior to all other races.

===Eugenics===
[[Eugenics]] came to play a prominent role in this racial thought as a way to improve and maintain the [[Racial purity|purity]] of the Aryan master race. Eugenics was a concept adhered to by many thinkers in the 1910s, 1920s, and 1930s, such as [[Margaret Sanger]],&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Sanger, quoted in {{cite book|last=Katz|first=Esther|author2=Engelman, Peter|title=The Selected Papers of Margaret Sanger|publisher=University of Illinois Press|location=Champaign, IL|year=2002|page=319|isbn=978-0-252-02737-6|quote=Our ... campaign for Birth Control is not merely of eugenic value, but is practically identical in ideal with the final aims of Eugenics}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Franks|first=Angela|title=Margaret Sanger's eugenic legacy|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, NC|year=2005|page=30|isbn=978-0-7864-2011-7|quote=...&amp;nbsp;her commitment to eugenics was constant ... until her death}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Marie Stopes]], [[H.

===Hierarchy===
The modern concept of the ''master race'' in general derives from 19th-century [[racial theory]], which posited a [[hierarchy]] of races based on darkness of [[Human skin color|skin color]]. This 19th-century concept was largely initially developed by Count [[Arthur de Gobineau|Joseph Arthur De Gobineau]]. Gobineau's basic concept, as further refined and developed in [[Nazism]], places the black [[Indigenous Australians]] and [[Black people|Equatorial Africans]] at the bottom of the hierarchy, while the white Northern and Western Europeans (consisting of Germans, Swedes, Icelanders, Norwegians, Danes, British, Irish, Dutch, Belgian and Northern French) were at the top; [[olive skin]]ned white Southern Europeans (consisting of the Southern French, Portuguese, Spaniards, Italians, Romanians, and Greeks, i.e., those of what is called the [[Mediterranean race]], which was regarded as another sub-race of the Caucasian race) in the upper middle ranks; and those of the [[Semitic race]] and [[Hamitic race]] (supposed sub-races of the Caucasian race) in the middle ranks (it was because the [[Jews]], being [[Semitic people|Semites]], were clever that they were so dangerous—they had their own plan for [[Jewish world domination]], a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] that had to be opposed by all thoughtful Aryans, declared the Nazis).&lt;ref name="hitler1925"/&gt; Slavs such as Poles and Russians were not considered Aryans;{{sfn|Longerich|2010|p=241}} and those of the [[Mongoloid race]] (including its offshoots the [[Malayan race]], the [[American Indian race]]) and [[Multiracial|mixed-race]] people such as [[Eurasian (mixed ancestry)|Eurasians]], the [[Bronze race|bronze]] [[Mestizos]], [[Mulatto]]s, [[Afro-Asian]]s, and [[Zambo]]s in the lower middle ranks. However, the Japanese were considered [[honorary Aryan]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Snyder (1976). ''Encyclopedia of the Third Reich'', p. 170.&lt;/ref&gt;

In attempting to scientifically prove the racial inferiority of [[Slavs]], German (and Austrian) racial scientists were forced to gloss over their findings which consistently found that Early Slavs were [[Cephalic index|dolicocephalic]] and fair haired, i.e., "Nordic", while the South Slavic "Dinaric" sub-race was often viewed favourable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wingfield|first=Nancy Meriwether |title=Creating the Other: Ethnic Conflict and Nationalism in Habsburg Central Europe|year=2003|publisher=Berghahn Books|location=New York|isbn=978-1-57181-385-5|page=203}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazis used the term "Slavic race", and considered Slavs to be non-Aryan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author = Mark Mazower|title = Hitler's Empire: Nazi Rule in Occupied Europe|date = 7 March 2013|publisher = Penguin Books Limited|isbn = 978-0-14-191750-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischel|first=Jack R.|title=Historical Dictionary of the Holocaust|year=2010|publisher=Scarecrow Press|location=Lanham, Maryland|isbn=978-0-8108-7485-5|page=175|quote=The policy of Lebensraum was also the product of Nazi racial ideology, which held that the Slavic peoples of the east were inferior to the Aryan race.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Stephenson|first=Jill|title=Hitler's Home Front: Wurttemberg Under the Nazis|year=2006|publisher=Hambledon Continuum|location=London; New York|isbn=978-1-85285-442-3|page=135|quote=Other non-'Aryans' included Slavs, Blacks and Roma.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Levine|first=Alan J.|title=Race Relations Within Western Expansion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DN5w7wPHi6kC|date=1 January 1996|publisher=Greenwood|location=Westport, CT|isbn=978-0-275-95037-8|page=98|quote=Preposterously, Central European Aryan theorists, and later the Nazis, would insist that the Slavic-speaking peoples were not really Aryans}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Timm|first=Annette F.|title=The Politics of Fertility in Twentieth-Century Berlin|year=2010|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge; New York|isbn=978-0-521-19539-3|page=118|quote=The Nazis' singleminded desire to "purify" the German race through the elimination of non-Aryans (particularly Jews, Gypsies, and Slavs)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of a Slavic "Untermensch" went alongside the political goals, and was particularly aimed at [[Poles]] and [[Russians]]. Germany's ultimate goal was to realize their ''[[Drang nach Osten]]'' to conquer in Europe, Ukraine's "[[chernozem]]" (black earth) soil being a particularly desirable zone for colonization by the "''Herrenvolk''" (master race).

In relation to the Nazis racial purity, author and historian [[Lucy Dawidowicz]] wrote:

{{quote|In the hierarchy of Nazi racism, the "Aryans" were the superior race, destined to rule the world after the destruction of their racial arch-foe, the Jews. The lesser races over whom the Germans would rule included the Slavs — Poles, Russians, Ukrainians.&amp;nbsp;... Hitler's racial policy with regard to the Slavs, to the extent that it was formulated, was "depopulation." The Slavs were to be prevented from procreating, except to provide the necessary continuing supply of slave laborers."&lt;ref&gt;[[Lucy Dawidowicz]], ''The Holocaust and the Historians'', p.10 :&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=='Master race' in the United States==
In the [[United States of America|United States]], the concept of 'master race' arose within the context of master-slave race relations in the slavery-based society of historical America – particularly in the [[Southern United States|South]] in the mid-19th century. It was based upon both the experience of [[Slavery in the United States|slavery]] and the [[Scientific racist#USA: slavery justified|pseudo-scientific justifications for racial slavery]], but also on the relations between whites in the South and [[Northern United States|North]], particularly during the [[American Civil War]].

[[Benjamin W. Leigh]], representing [[Virginia]] in the [[United States Senate]], said in a speech of January 19, 1836:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There has been in Virginia as earnest a desire to abolish slavery as exists any where at this day. It commenced with the Revolution, and many of our ablest and most influential men were active in recommending it, and in devising plans for the accomplishment of it. The Legislature encouraged and facilitated emancipation by the owners, and many slaves were so emancipated. The leaning of the courts of justice was always ''in favorem libertatis''. This disposition continued until the impracticability of effecting a general emancipation, without incalculable mischief to the master race, and danger of utter destruction to the other, and the evils consequent on partial emancipations, became too obvious to the Legislature, and to the great majority of the people, to be longer disregarded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ll/llrd/022/0100/01000191.tif Gales &amp;amp; Seaton's Register, 1836, p191]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Oxford English Dictionary]] records that [[William J. Grayson]] used the phrase "master race" in his poem ''The Hireling and the Slave'' (1855):
&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
For these great ends hath Heaven’s supreme command
Brought the black savage from his native land,
Trains for each purpose his barbarian mind,
By slavery tamed, enlightened, and refined;
Instructs him, from a master-race, to draw
Wise modes of polity and forms of law,
Imbues his soul with faith, his heart with love,
Shapes all his life by dictates from above
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

where the phrase denotes the relation between the white masters and negro slaves.
By 1860 Virginian author [[George Fitzhugh]] was using the "challenging phrase "master race", which soon came to mean considerably more than the ordinary master-slave relationship".&lt;ref&gt;Wish, Harvey ''George Fitzhugh: propagandist of the Old South'' Louisiana State University Press (1943) p270&lt;/ref&gt; Fitzhugh, along with a number of southern writers, used the term to differentiate Southerners from Northerners, based on the [[dichotomy]] that Southerners were supposedly descendents of [[Normans]] / [[Cavaliers]] whereas Northerners were descendents of [[Anglo-Saxons]] / [[Puritans]].&lt;ref&gt;see Watson jr, Ritchie Devon ''Normans and Saxons: Southern Race Mythology and the Intellectual History of the American Civil War'' Louisiana State University Press (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1861, the Southern press bragged that Northern soldiers would "encounter a master race" and knowledge of this fact would cause Northern soldiers' "knees to tremble".&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Grant and Lee: victorious American and vanquished Virginian Praeger (2008) p15&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Richmond Whig'' in 1862 proclaimed that "the master race of this continent is found in the southern states",&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Conkling, Henry ''An Inside View of the Rebellion: An American Citizen's Textbook'' (1864) p7&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1863 the ''Richmond Examiner'' stated that "there are slave races born to serve, master races born to govern"&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Senate documents, otherwise publ. as Public documents and Executive documents: 14th Congress, 1st session-48th congress, 2nd session and special session  (1869) p670&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the works of [[John H. Van Evrie]], a Northern supporter of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]], the term was interchangeable with [[white supremacy]], notably in ''White Supremacy and Negro Subordination, Or, Negroes a Subordinate Race and (so-called) slavery its normal condition'' (1861). In ''Subgeneation: the theory of the normal relations of the races; an answer to miscegenation'' (1864) Van Evrie created the words "subgen"  to describe what he considered to be the "inferior races" and "subgeneation" to describe the ‘normal’ relation of such inferior races to whites, something which he considered to be the "very [[Cornerstone Speech|corner-stone]] of  democracy";&lt;ref&gt;''Subgeneation'' p42&lt;/ref&gt; but these words never entered the dictionary.

The racial term ''[[Untermensch]]'' originates from the title of [[Klansman]] [[Lothrop Stoddard]]'s 1922 book ''The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under-man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = Stoddard, Lothrop| authorlink = Lothrop Stoddard| year = 1922| title = The Revolt Against Civilization: The Menace of the Under Man| publisher = [[Charles Scribner's Sons]]| location = New York| isbn =| url = https://archive.org/details/revoltagainstciv00stoduoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was later adopted by the Nazis from that book's German version ''Der Kulturumsturz: Die Drohung des Untermenschen'' (1925).&lt;ref&gt;

[[Alfred Rosenberg]] was the leading Nazi who attributed the concept of the East-European "under man" to Stoddard. As the Nazi Party's chief racial theorist, Rosenberg oversaw the construction of a human racial "ladder" that justified Hitler's racial and ethnic policies. Referring to Russian communists, Rosenbeg wrote in his ''[[Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts]]'' (1930) that "this is the kind of human being that Lothrop Stoddard has called the 'under man.'" ["...den Lothrop Stoddard als 'Untermenschen' bezeichnete."]&lt;ref&gt;

==Nordicism==
{{Main|Nordic race}}
The origins of the Nazi version of the theory of the master race were in the 19th-century racial theories of Count [[Arthur de Gobineau|Joseph Arthur De Gobineau]], who argued that cultures degenerated when distinct races mixed. It was believed at this time that the peoples of [[Southern Europe]] were racially mixed with non-European [[Moors]] from across the [[Mediterranean Sea]], while the peoples of [[Northern Europe]] and [[Western Europe]] remained pure. Proponents of the Nordic theory further argued that Nordic peoples had developed an innate toughness and determination due to the harsh, challenging climate in which they evolved.

The philosopher [[Arthur Schopenhauer]] was one of the earliest proponents of a theory presenting a hierarchical racial model of history, attributing civilisational primacy to the "white races" who gained their sensitivity and intelligence by refinement in the rigorous [[north]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;The highest civilisation and culture, apart from the Ancient Indians and Egyptians, are found exclusively among the white races; and even with many dark peoples, the ruling caste or race is fairer in colour than the rest and has, therefore, evidently immigrated, for example, the Brahmins, the Incas, and the rulers of the South Sea Islands. All this is because necessity is the mother of invention because those tribes that emigrated early to the north and there gradually became white, had to develop all their intellectual powers and invent and perfect all the arts in their struggle with need, want and misery, which in their many forms were brought about by the climate. This they had to do in order to make up for the parsimony of nature and out of it all came their high civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Arthur Schopenhauer, ''[[Parerga and Paralipomena]]'', Volume II, Section 92&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite this, he was adamantly against differing treatment of races, was fervently anti-slavery, and supported the [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionist]] movement in the United States. He describes the treatment of "[our] innocent black brothers whom force and injustice have delivered into [the slave-master's] devilish clutches" as "belonging to the blackest pages of mankind's criminal record".&lt;ref&gt;''Parerga and Paralipomena'', "On Ethics," Sec. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hans Frank]], Hitler's personal lawyer, stated that Hitler carried a copy of Schopenhauer's book ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' with him wherever he went throughout [[World War I]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nobeliefs.com/hitler-myths.htm|title=Hitler Myths|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:WernerGoldberg.jpg|thumb|175px|[[Werner Goldberg]], who was part Jewish but blond and blue-eyed, was used in Nazi recruitment posters as "The Ideal German Soldier."]]
The postulated [[Supremacism|superiority]] of these people was said to make them born leaders, or a "master race".{{sfn|Yenne|2010|p=88}} Other authors included [[Guido von List]], his associate [[Lanz von Liebenfels]], and the British-born German racial theorist [[Houston Stewart Chamberlain]], all of whom felt that the white race in general and [[Germanic peoples]] in particular were superior to others, and that given the [[Racial purity|purification]] of both the white race and the German people from the other races which were "polluting" them, a new [[Millenarianism|millenarian]] age of Aryan god-men would arrive.{{sfn|Yenne|2010|pp=22–25, 88}}

Nazi policy stressed the superiority of the Germanic ''Ubermenschen'' (superhuman) [[Nordic race]], a sub-race of the [[White people#19th and 20th century: the .22Caucasian race.22|white Caucasian race]] European population defined by [[anthropometric]] models of racial difference. The Nordic race was said to comprise only the [[Germanic people]]s: Scandinavians and the rest of the Nordic countries (Norwegians, Swedes, Danes, Icelanders, and Faroese), [[ethnic Germans]] (including [[Austrians]], [[Banat Swabians]], as well as [[Sudeten Germans|Sudeten]], [[Baltic Germans|Baltic]] and [[Volga Germans]]), Alemannic Swiss, Liechtensteiners, Luxembourgers, the Dutch, Flemings, Afrikaners, Frisians and the English.

The Nazi racial theorist [[Hans F. K. Günther]] first defined "Nordic thought" in his programmatic book ''Der Nordische Gedanke unter den Deutschen''. The fact that Germans were not purely Nordic was acknowledged by Günther in his book ''[[Rassenkunde des deutschen Volkes]]'' (1922) ("Racial Science of the German People"), in which he described the German people as being made up of all five of his European racial categories: Nordic, Mediterranean, [[Dinaric race|Dinaric]], [[Alpine race|Alpine]], and [[East Baltic race|East Baltic]].&lt;ref name=Maxwell150 &gt;Anne Maxwell. Picture Imperfect: Photography and Eugenics, 1870–1940. Eastbourne, England: UK; Portland, Oregon, USA: SUSSEX ACADEMIC PRESS, 2008, 2010. P. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Most official Nazi comments on the Nordic race were based on Günther's works, and Alfred Rosenberg presented Günther with a medal for his work in anthropology.

Although the physical ideal of these racial theorists was typically the tall, [[blond|fair-haired]] and [[Eye color|light-eyed]] Nordic individual, such theorists accepted the fact that a considerable variety of hair and eye colour existed within the racial categories they recognised. For example, [[Adolf Hitler]] and many Nazi officials had dark hair and were still considered members of the [[Aryan race]] under Nazi racial doctrine, because the determination of an individual's racial type depended on a preponderance of many characteristics in an individual rather than on just one defining feature.&lt;ref&gt;"The range of blond hair color in pure Nordic peoples runs from flaxen and red to shades of chestnut and brown... It must be clearly understood that blondness of hair and of eye is not a final test of Nordic race. The Nordics include all the blonds, and also those of darker hair or eye when possessed of a preponderance of other Nordic characters. In this sense the word "blond" means those lighter shades of hair or eye color in contrast to the very dark or black shades which are termed brunet. The meaning of "blond" as now used is therefore not limited to the lighter or flaxen shades as in colloquial speech. In England among Nordic populations there are large numbers of individuals with hazel brown eyes joined with the light brown or chestnut hair which is the typical hair shade of the English and Americans. This combination is also common in Holland and Westphalia and is frequently associated with a very fair skin. These men are all of "blond" aspect and constitution and consequently are to be classed as members of the Nordic race." Quoted in Grant, 1922, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- please do not add information about the (disputed) colour of Hitler's eyes. It is irrelevant to the issue, and has led to repeated pointless changes and reversions --&gt;

Hitler and [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] planned to use the [[SS]] as the basis for the racial "regeneration" of Europe following the final victory of Nazism. The SS was to be a racial elite chosen on the basis of "pure" Nordic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last = Hale| first = Christopher| title = Himmler's Crusade | publisher = [[Bantam Press]]| year = 2003| pages = 74–87 | isbn = 0-593-04952-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Russell| first = Stuart| authorlink = | title = Heinrich Himmler's Camelot| publisher = Kressman-Backmayer| year = 1999| pages =| isbn =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey G.

[[Giuseppe Sergi]] (1841–1936) was an Italian anthropologist of the early twentieth century, best known for his opposition to Nordicism in his books on the racial identity of ancient Mediterranean peoples. His concept of the Mediterranean race became important to the modelling of racial difference in the early twentieth century.

==Aryanism and Nazism==
{{Main|Aryan race|Nazism and race|Racial policy of Nazi Germany}}
{{see also|Aryanization (Nazism)|The Myth of the Twentieth Century}}
The term [[Aryan]] derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word (ā́rya), which derived from ''arya'', the original [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] [[endonym|autonym]]. Also, [[Name of Iran|the word ''Iran'']] is the [[Farsi language|Persian]] word for land/place of the ''Aryan''&lt;ref name="autogenerated1996"&gt;Wiesehofer, Joseph ''Ancient Persia'' New York:1996 I.B. Tauris&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Iranian peoples]]).

Following the ideas of Gobineau and others, the Nazi theorist [[Alfred Rosenberg]] determined that these people, who, he claimed, were originally from [[Atlantis]], were a dynamic [[warrior people]] who dwelt in northern climates on the [[North German Plain]] in [[Prehistory|prehistoric times]], from which they migrated southeast by riding their [[chariots]], eventually reaching [[Ukraine]], [[Iran]], and then [[India]]. They were supposed to be the ancestors of the ancient [[Germanic tribes]], who shared their warrior values. Rosenberg claimed that [[Christianity]] was an alien [[Semitic people|Semitic]] [[master-slave morality|slave-morality]] which was inappropriate for the warrior Aryan master race and he thus supported a melange of aspects of [[Hindu]] [[Historical Vedic religion|Vedic]] and [[Zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] teachings (both of these religions having been organised by Aryans), along with pre-Christian European [[Odinism|Odinistic paganism]], which he also considered distinctively Aryan in character.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Alfred Rosenberg|Rosenberg, Alfred]] ''[[The Myth of the Twentieth Century|Der Mythus des 20. Jahrhunderts]]'', 1930 ("The Myth of the 20th Century")&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Nazi Germany]], the [[Nuremberg Laws|Nuremberg Race Laws]] of 1935 forbade [[Anti-miscegenation laws#Nazi Germany|sexual relations and marriage]] between an "Aryan" and a "non-Aryan" in order to maintain the purity of the Aryan race. Such relations became a punishable crime known as ''[[Rassenschande]]'' or "racial shame".&lt;ref name="Burleigh1991"&gt;{{cite book | author = Michael Burleigh | title = The Racial State: Germany 1933–1945 | date = 7 November 1991 | publisher = Cambridge University Press | ISBN = 978-0-521-39802-2 | page = 49}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[League of German Girls]] was particularly regarded as instructing girls to avoid ''Rassenschande'', which was treated with particular importance for young females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/fink.htm|title=The Jewish Question in Education|first=Randall|last=Bytwerk|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aryans found guilty of this crime could face incarceration in a concentration camp, while non-Aryans could face the death penalty.&lt;ref name="rupp125"&gt;[[Leila J. Rupp]], ''Mobilizing Women for War'', p 125, {{ISBN|0-691-04649-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Nazis recognized the Germanic people as the master race, and several policies were implemented in order to improve and maintain the Germanic-Nordic ubermenschen Aryan "master race", including the practice of [[eugenics]]. In order to eliminate "defective" citizens, the [[T-4 Euthanasia Program]] was administered by [[Karl Brandt (Nazi physician)|Karl Brandt]] in order to rid the country of the [[intellectual disability|intellectually disabled]] or those born with [[genetic deficiencies]], as well as those deemed racially inferior. Additionally, a programme of [[compulsory sterilisation]] was undertaken which resulted in forced operations being performed on hundreds of thousands of individuals. Many of these [[Racial policy of Nazi Germany|policies]] are generally seen as being related to what eventually became known as [[the Holocaust]].&lt;ref name="THE "/&gt;

The Nazis also undertook measures to increase the number of Nordics in Germany. The [[Lebensborn]] program was only open to German women who fit the Nordic profile. During the Nazi [[Occupation of Poland (1939–1945)|occupation of Poland]], the Nazis took young Nordic-looking Polish children who were classified as being descended from ethnic German settlers in order to determine whether or not they were "racially valuable". If that were the case, the young children were taken back to these Lebensborn houses so they could be raised as Germans.&lt;ref name="Bendersky2013"&gt;{{cite book | author = Joseph W. Bendersky|title = A Concise History of Nazi Germany | date = 11 July 2013 | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishers | ISBN = 978-1-4422-2270-0 | page = 180}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Nazi Germany, there existed an official document which certified that its owner was Aryan, the so-called [[Aryan certificate]] that could also be obtained by citizens of other countries. It states in the section ''Racial Tenet'' (''Rassegrundsatz''):
{{quote|In line with national socialist thinking which does full justice to all other peoples, there is never the expression of superior or inferior, but alien racial admixtures.&lt;ref&gt;German: "Dem Denken des Nationalsozialismus entsprechend, jedem anderen Volke volle Gerechtigkeit widerfahren zu lassen, ist dabei niemals von höher- oder minderwertigen, sondern stets nur von fremden Rasseneinschlägen die Rede."&lt;/ref&gt;}}
For the ''Greater Aryan certificate'' people had to prove that reaching back to January 1, 1800 "''none of their paternal nor their maternal ancestors had Jewish or colored blood''"&lt;ref&gt;Quotation in German: "''wer unter seinen Vorfahren väterlicherseits oder mütterlicherseits kein jüdisches oder farbiges Blut hat"''; in: Isabel Heinemann. "Rasse Siedlung, deutsches Blut", Wallstein Verlag, 1999, {{ISBN|3-89244-623-7}}, p. 54&lt;/ref&gt; ([[Schutzstaffel|SS]] officers had to prove this reaching back to 1750).

==Mediterranean race==

[[File:Mediterranean_race_Fischer_Lexikon.png|thumb|200px|[[Italian people|Italian]] man of Mediterranean type, from the ''Fischer Lexikon'' (1959)]]
{{Main|Mediterranean race}}
{{See also|Culture of Italy|Culture of Greece|Culture of Portugal|Culture of Spain|Mediterraneanism}}
The fact that the [[Mediterranean race]] was responsible for the most important of ancient western civilisations was a problem for the promoters of Nordic superiority. According to [[Giuseppe Sergi]], the Mediterranean race was the "greatest race of the world" and was singularly responsible for the most accomplished civilisations of ancient times, including those of [[Mesopotamia]], [[Ancient Persia|Persia]], [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Phoenicia]], [[Carthage]], and [[Ancient Rome|Rome]]. The Mediterranean race was also a major influence to the outside world in the modern era:  during the 16th century, [[Spain]] and [[Portugal]] established the first [[Colonial empires|global empire]]s in Western history, setting both nations in the highest level of political and economic powers in Europe.

[[C. G. Seligman]] also stated that "it must, I think, be recognised that the Mediterranean race has actually more achievements to its credit than any other race, since it is responsible for by far the greater part of Mediterranean civilisation, certainly before 1000 BC (and probably much later), and so shaped not only the Aegean cultures, but those of Western as well as the greater part of Eastern Mediterranean lands, while the culture of their near relatives, the Hamitic pre-dynastic [[Egyptians]], formed the basis of that of Egypt."&lt;ref&gt;''The Journal of the Royal Anthropological Institute of Great Britain and Ireland'', Vol. 54. (January  – June, 1924), p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazis explained this by pointing out that the original [[Latins (Italic tribe)|Latins]] and [[Greeks]] were [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] Nordic tribes that had migrated into Italy and Greece, respectively. The Nazis also claimed that the Spanish and Portuguese empires were examples of Nordic power since, at the time, their governments were run by the descendants of the Germanic [[Visigoths]] that had invaded earlier.
However, they did admit that the masses during these four civilizations were Mediterranean. And Germans of all European races were classified as Aryan.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Master race in fiction==
Aryan master race ideology was common throughout the educated and literate strata of the [[Western world]] until after [[World War II]]. Such theories were commonplace in early-20th century [[fantasy literature]].

In the 1920s and 1930s, the original ''[[Buck Rogers]]'' stories and [[Comic strip|newspaper cartoons]], Buck Rogers, in his adventures in the 25th century that take place on [[Earth]], fights for ''[[European Americans|Aryan-Americans]]'' from the liberated zone around [[Niagara, New York]], against the ''Red Mongol Empire,'' a Chinese empire of the future which rules most of [[North America]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Collected Works of Buck Rogers in the 25th Century'' 1969 Chelsea House—Introduction by [[Ray Bradbury]]—Reprints of the original [[Buck Rogers]] comic strips&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, both educational and storybooks for children in Germany taught their readers about the master race. In the ''Sun Koh'' science fiction series, the protagonist Koh says things like "My forefathers were Aryan", and in a story about [[Atlantis]], he says, "If our Atlantis once again rises out of the sea, then we will get from there the blond, steel-hard [[Man (word)|men]] with the pure blood and will create with them the master race, which will finally rule the earth."&lt;ref name="voss"&gt;Julia Voss, [http://www.faz.net/s/Rub71E8665493FD4CB29D4E0759DF21C32C/Doc~E63B66F19501A41828F6A22377304DC05~ATpl~Ecommon~Scontent.html "Jim Knopf rettet die Evolutionstheorie"] ''Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung'' (December 16, 2008).

''[[Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung]]'' writer [[Julia Voss]] wrote a book&lt;ref group=note&gt;Voss' book was written as a doctoral [[dissertation]].&lt;/ref&gt; on Jim Button, uncovering Ende's many references to Nazi symbols in that book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kultiversum.de/Literatur-Literaturen/Evolutionstheorie-Julia-Voss-Darwins-Jim-Knopf-Im-Zickzack-durch-Lummerland.html Book review of ''Darwins Jim Knopf'' by Julia Voss] Kultiversum.de "Im Zickzack durch Lummerland" (2009).

In the 1948 film [[Rope (film)|''Rope'']] by [[Alfred Hitchcock]], one of the central characters, Brandon Shaw, is a firm believer in the master race ideology.{{Citation needed|date=October 2018}}

In ''[[Doctor Who]],'' the Doctor's frequent enemies, the [[Daleks]], consider themselves a master race who must purge the universe of all others; Terry Nation explicitly modeled them on the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;http://nzdwfc.tetrap.com/archive/tsv51/terrynation.html | Terry Nation – Writing For The Screen, By Paul Scoones&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2009 special ''[[The End of Time (Doctor Who)|The End of Time]]'', when [[Master (Doctor Who)|the Master]] transforms the entire human race into copies of himself, he claims that there is no human race, but only "the Master race".

In the [[Harry Potter]] series, while the parallels were not originally intentional, there is much similarity between Voldemort's pureblood ideology and the master race ideology of the Nazis, with wizards being "pure" and anyone with Muggle (non-wizard) blood being considered "half-blood" or "mudblood", a word treated the same way a racial slur would be treated in the real world ([[Neo-Nazism|Neo-Nazis]] call non-white people ''mud people'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Johnston|first=Ian|title=Author ‘chilled’ to learn Harry’s half-blood status has Nazi parallels|url=http://www.religionnewsblog.com/8042/author-chilled-to-learn-harrys-half-blood-status-has-nazi-parallels|accessdate=June 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15314">The '''Mediterranean Interregional Commission''' is one of the twelve Committees of the [[United Cities and Local Governments]]. 

Within United Cities and Local Governments, the Interregional Mediterranean Commission is at the junction of three regional sections: Europe, Africa, and the Middle East/West Asia. The Mediterranean occupies a special place in UCLG due to the large amount of direct members in the three regions North, South, and East of the Mediterranean and because of the many cooperation initiatives that connect local authorities and the common policies for regional development. Following the Med Urbs program, a “network culture” of trans-Mediterranean local authorities was created in the Mediterranean, reinforced by the Euro-Mediterranean partnership: [[Medcities]], the network of Euromed cities (previously the Euromed group of [[Eurocities]]), the Standing Committee for the [[Euro Mediterranean Partnership of Local and Regional Authorities]] (COPPEM), the [http://www.euromedina.org/nous_reseau_en.htm  Europe-MENA Urban Network], [[Latin Arch]], the Inter-Mediterranean Commission of the Conference of Peripheral Maritime Regions [http://www.crpm.org/index.php  (CPMR)], and the European network of local authorities for peace in the Middle East [https://web.archive.org/web/20120328094448/http://www.paxurbs.com/Anglais/indexen2.htm  (COEPPO)] are some of the networks that intersect with a variety of networks of civil society, universities and initiatives of the private sector. It appeared that the three regional sections of UCLG together could reinforce exchanges and encourage taking into consideration the specific interests of local Mediterranean authorities, whether on matters related to Euro-Mediterranean relations or on strategic issues like [[decentralization]], urban development, or the environment, particularly access to and [[water management]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commed-cglu.org/spip.php?rubrique25 Presentation of the Mediterranean Commission]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the “Mediterranean” context, the Mediterranean Commission brings added value as vital support to a dynamic process that will make possible:

- Providing visibility and legibility to the numerous initiatives of local authorities in the Mediterranean.
  
- Creating the necessary conditions for the actors of these initiatives to meet in order to share know-how and experiences, to avoid scattered and compartmentalized actions, and by doing so, to optimize their impact in the field; encouraging particularly North-South and South-South dialogue and knowledge exchanges.
  
- Gaining recognition of the importance of the local institutional sphere as designers, managers, and leaders of development policies that are the closest to the citizens, in a region where governance indicators show it is urgent to bring centers of power closer to the population.
  
- Bridging the gap between elected representatives and local decision-makers in the Mediterranean who due to longstanding conflicts, economic difficulties and cultural stereotypes stifle the feeling of sharing a common Mediterranean or Euro-Mediterranean destiny.
  
- Promoting adequate consideration of political Mediterranean issues from the perspective of local authorities: peace in the Middle East, conflict prevention (“Peace Keeping”), intercultural dialogue (North-North, North-South, and South-South) regional integration processes (Union of the Arab Maghreb), etc.

==History==

The creation of a Mediterranean Commission within UCLG is not a new idea.

It was suggested in 2001 during the joint meeting in Tunis of the World Federation of United Cities and the International Union of Local Authorities (FMCU/IULA), before the unification congress of Paris in May 2004. During the congress in Paris, the President of the French [[Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur]] (PACA) region, the mayors of [[Marseille]], [[Rome]], and [[Tunis]] and the founding and honorary presidents of UCLG relaunched the idea of a Commission suggesting it could have its headquarters in Marseille. The principle of a Mediterranean Commission was adopted by the Executive Council in São Paulo and the creation of the Commission was ratified during the World Council of Beijing in June 2005.
On May 18, 2005 a meeting was held in Marseille. Major local authorities of the Mediterranean and their national or international networks were invited to participate or to contribute in writing to the meeting during which a first definition of a “Mediterranean Commission” of UCLG was prepared, including its members, objectives, and a tentative agenda.

Milestones of the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG:

''May 2006'': A technical secretariat is set up in Marseille, financed by the City of Marseille and the Provence-Alpes-Côte d’Azur Region, with the support of Cités Unies France and the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
  
''November 2006'': Constitution of the political organs representing the three shores of the Mediterranean with a three-year mandate. Omar EL JAZOULI, Mayor of [[Marrakech]], becomes the first President of the Mediterranean Commission
  
''October 2007'': The mandate of the Mediterranean Commission is renewed during the Second World Congress of UCLG in Jeju.

''February 2008'': [[Mercedes Bresso]], President of the [[Piedmont]] Region, becomes the second President of the Mediterranean Commission.
 
''22 &amp; 23 June 2008'': Forum of Local and Regional Authorities of the Mediterranean.
  
''June 2009'': Abdel Moumen ARISS, Mayor of [[Beirut]], becomes the third President of the Mediterranean Commission.

''17 to 20 November 2010'': The third UCLG Congress, held in Mexico, sees the renewal of the mandate of the Mediterranean Commission for three years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commed-cglu.org/spip.php?article564 The Mandate of the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG renewed in Mexico] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009003022/http://www.commed-cglu.org/spip.php?article564 |date=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Objectives==

The political scope of the Mediterranean Commission establishes UCLG as the largest framework for direct political exchanges between local elected representatives in the Mediterranean respecting a North-South balance that undertakes to:
  
- Promote local and regional autonomy and the institutional reinforcement of local authorities South and East of the Mediterranean, as well as their national networks or associations. To this end, the Commission favors structuring local authorities through its support to national associations of elected officials and local authorities of the South or by fostering their creation.
  
- Assure direct exchanges between the many different actors on common issues at Mediterranean scale, for example, the organization of the Permanent Forum of Local and Regional Authorities of the Mediterranean, an opportunity for dialogue and a special occasion to amplify the voice of Mediterranean local authorities and to allow exchanges between Mediterranean and non-Mediterranean politicians and actors.
  
- Develop decentralized cooperation and initiatives advocating common values that respect Mediterranean specificities.
  
- Engage in dialogue with donors of State and multilateral funds (French Development Agency, Bretton Woods Institutions, United Nations agencies, investment bank funds), and to promote closer relations with the institutions of the [[European Union]] ([[EU Parliament]], [[EU Commission]], [[Committee of the Regions]]) based on the expertise and the results obtained by the networks or by encouraging new types of collaboration.

- Defend the role and participation of local authorities in the Barcelona Process-[[Union for the Mediterranean]], the new Neighborhood Policy and overall within the Mediterranean partnership.

- Seek to identify and promote concrete initiatives in favor of peace in the Middle East, conflict prevention (“[[Peace Keeping]]”), intercultural dialogue, regional integration processes and development throughout the entire region, leading to long-term exchanges and partnerships between territories (North-South, South-South).

- Engage in dialogue and take into consideration the work and proposals of civil society, in particular, economic actors, academics, and community associations.

- Construct a more stable and prosperous Mediterranean space.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cities-localgovernments.org/news.asp?IdNews=ca7b88653db59a7ced7e1d161d77abec6a22dfd242be27ac955c5e21dae5344a&amp;Page=7&amp;Src= Local Authorities want to contribute to the construction of a more stable and prosperous Mediterranean space]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisation==

''Technical Committee'': The technical committee consists of the heads of the principal European networks working in the Mediterranean, trans-Mediterranean networks, national associations of local authorities South and East of the Mediterranean, and representatives of national, European, or international institutions working in the Mediterranean.

''Mediterranean Council'': It is made up of elected local officials in positions of responsibility in European networks active in the Mediterranean, in trans-Mediterranean networks or national associations of local authorities South and East of the Mediterranean. It includes representatives of local authorities from countries where there are no structured networks and may be open to actors of the civil society during its meetings.

''Bureau'': The first bureau of the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG was established in the Commission’s meeting during the World Council of UCLG held in Marrakech on Monday October 30, 2006. On the basis of a rotating tripartite presidency it was composed of elected members representing the three shores of the Mediterranean: for Europe: Mercedes Bresso, President of the Piedmont Region (Italy), for the Maghreb: Omar El Jazouli, Mayor of Marrakech (Morocco) and for the Middle East: Abdel Mounim Ariss, Mayor of Beirut (Lebanon). Mr [[Jean-Claude Gaudin]], Mayor of Marseille and Mr [[Michel Vauzelle]], President of the Provence Alpes Côte d’Azur Region, were the vice-presidents.
Following the renewal of the mandate of the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG at the World Congress of Mexico in November 2010, a new bureau will be constituted soon.

The Commission’s Headquarters and the Technical Secretariat are located in Marseilles.

===Members===

The Mediterranean Commission is open to members of UCLG and to thematic or general networks of Mediterranean local and regional authorities. Territorial authorities that are not members of UCLG and that wish to join the Commission may do so by sending a written request to the president of the Commission.

==Activities==

In its technical dimension, the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG does not seek to be an additional network nor an additional operator. By becoming a center of resources, on a Mediterranean scale, for projects, procedures, and mechanisms concerning territorial authorities, the Mediterranean Commission offers an overview of strategies and opportunities in the region. It brings closer the supply and the needs in the cooperation process by:
 
- Capitalizing on and disseminating knowledge and expertise in local and territorial management, urban development and decentralized cooperation—in a multilateral framework—by relaying calls for proposals, projects, or ideas for the implementation of innovative forms of cooperation.

- Providing technical assistance to Mediterranean project leaders (local authorities and their networks and associations): assistance with legal, administrative, and financial aspects of the implementation of projects of local authorities and their networks.

- Carrying on the technical assistance over the long term through the implementation of tools that will contribute to the visibility and evaluation of activities of local authorities: website, database, technical data, newsletter.
  
- Carrying out action research on Mediterranean issues and publication of work aimed at practical applications, particularly the creation of groups of experts who may work on specific problems and/or geographical areas.
  
- Organizing technical workshops and training on topics chosen by local authorities and their networks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.commed-cglu.org/IMG/pdf/Objectives_for_internet-2.pdf Presentation of the objectives and the plan of action of the Mediterranean Commission of UCLG] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111009003126/http://www.commed-cglu.org/IMG/pdf/Objectives_for_internet-2.pdf |date=2011-10-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Motorcycle Emptiness'''" ({{Audio|Manic Street Preachers Motorcycle Emptiness.ogg|sample}}) is a single by [[Wales|Welsh]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Manic Street Preachers]]. It was released on 1 June 1992, through [[Columbia Records]]. It was the fifth single to be released from their debut album, ''[[Generation Terrorists]]''.

== Content ==

The track is slower paced than most others on the album. Its lyrics are inspired by [[S.E. Hinton]]'s book ''[[Rumble Fish (novel)|Rumble Fish]]'', about biker gang culture. The lyrics have been interpreted by the band as an attack on the hollowness of the consumer lifestyle offered by [[capitalism]], describing how society expects young people to conform.

The song was derived from the early Manic Street Preachers songs "Go, Buzz Baby, Go" (with which it shares the chord structure and the phrase "Motorcycle Emptiness" late in the song over the verse chords) and "Behave Yourself Baby", a rough demo with a similar structure, that has the lines "All we want from you is the skin you live within", similar to "All we want from you are the kicks you've given us" in this song.

Some of the lyrics are taken from the poem "Neon Loneliness" (the first line of the chorus, "Under neon loneliness", is a direct lift) by Welsh poet [[Patrick Jones]], the brother of Manics bass guitarist and lyricist [[Nicky Wire]]. "Motorcycle Emptiness" was also included on ''[[Forever Delayed]]'', the Manics' greatest hits album, in October 2002, and released as a reissued single from the compilation in February 2003.

== Release ==

"Motorcycle Emptiness" was released on 1 June 1992 by record label [[Columbia Records|Columbia]]. The song reached number 17 in the [[UK Singles Chart]] on 13 June 1992. It remained there for another week and spent a total of eight weeks in the top 75, two weeks longer than any other ''Generation Terrorists'' single, and a record not surpassed by the Manics until 1996's "[[A Design for Life]]".&lt;ref name="UK charts"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/_/manic%20street%20preachers |title=Manic Street Preachers &lt;nowiki&gt;| Artist |&lt;/nowiki&gt; Official Charts |website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] |accessdate=18 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, a re-issue CD containing the title track, "4 Ever Delayed" and "Little Baby Nothing (Acoustic)" was released in Europe as promotion for the band's ''[[Forever Delayed]]'' greatest hits compilation.

== Music video ==

The video was filmed during a promotional visit to [[Japan]]&lt;ref&gt;https://tokyofox.wordpress.com/2013/04/24/music-videos-filmed-in-japan-4-manic-street-preachers-motorcycle-emptiness-1992/&lt;/ref&gt; in various locations, including the [[Shibuya#Shibuya Crossing|Shibuya Crossing]] and [[Cosmo Clock 21]]. It features the whole band, but with Bradfield appearing most, standing stationary and performing the song as crowds surge around him. The band appear in non-sequential shots, exploring the sites of Japan. At one point, Edwards appears trying to gain the attention of a tortoise.

== Remix ==

The song was remixed by [[Apollo-440]] under their alternative name Stealth Sonic Orchestra as a piece of classical-style music. This remix was available as a track on the single "[[Australia (Manic Street Preachers song)|Australia]]" (taken from their seminal 1996 album ''[[Everything Must Go (Manic Street Preachers album)|Everything Must Go]]''), and was also used by [[T-Mobile]] for an advertising campaign in 2003.

== Legacy ==

In 2006, ''[[Q (magazine)|Q]]'' magazine readers voted the song as the 88th best song ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=October 2006 |title=&lt;nowiki&gt;[&lt;/nowiki&gt;''Q'' article&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; |magazine=[[Q (magazine)|Q]] |issue=243 |page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- regarding vvvvv this: yes, Neturei Karta really is ARAMAIC and not HEBREW. editors already thrice changed Aramaic to Hebrew; this is correct. --&gt;

'''Neturei Karta''' ([[Jewish Babylonian Aramaic]]: {{lang|tmr|נָטוֹרֵי קַרְתָּא}} ''{{transl|tmr|nāṭōrē qarṯā}}'', literally  "Guardians of the City") is a religious group of [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi Jews]], formally created in [[Jerusalem]], [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate of Palestine]], in 1938, splitting off from [[Agudat Yisrael|Agudas Yisrael]].  Neturei Karta opposes secular [[Zionism]] and calls for a dismantling of the [[State of Israel]], in the belief that Jews are forbidden to have their own state until the coming of the [[Messiah in Judaism|Jewish Messiah]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/Judaism/nk.html Neturei Karta] at [[Jewish Virtual Library]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkusa.org/AboutUs/Zionism/judaism_isnot_zionism.cfm www.nkusa.org, Judaism is not Zionism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070415203350/http://www.nkusa.org/AboutUs/Zionism/judaism_isnot_zionism.cfm |date=2007-04-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the Neturei Karta consider themselves true Jews, the US-based Jewish [[Anti-Defamation League]] has described them as "the farthest fringes of Judaism".&lt;ref name="WhatIs"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.adl.org/extremism/karta/ |title=Neturei Karta: What is it? |publisher=Anti-Defamation League |date=December 14, 2006 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121029025033/http://www.adl.org/extremism/karta/ |archivedate=2012-10-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Israel some members also pray at affiliated ''[[beit midrash]]'', in [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Meah Shearim]] neighborhood and in Ramat Beit Shemesh Bet. Neturei Karta states that no official count of the number of members exists.&lt;ref name="odenheimer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Odenheimer|first=Micha|date=Spring 2006|title=We Will Not Obey.

According to the US branch Neturei Karta:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The name Neturei Karta is a name usually given to those people who regularly pray in the Neturei Karta synagogues (Torah Ve'Yirah Jerusalem, Torah U'Tefillah London, Torah U'Tefillah NY, Beis Yehudi Upstate NY, etc.), study in or send their children to educational institutions run by Neturei Karta, or actively participate in activities, assemblies or demonstrations called by the Neturei Karta".&lt;ref name="whatnk"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Origin of the name==

Originally the organization was called Chevrat HaChayim (Society of Life); however this name was quickly supplanted in favor of the name Neturei Karta.

The name ''Neturei Karta'' literally means "Guardians of the City" in [[Aramaic]] and is derived from a narrative on page 76c of [[Hagigah|Tractate Hagigah]] in the [[Jerusalem Talmud]]. There it is related that Rabbi [[Judah haNasi]] sent two rabbis on a tour of inspection:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In one town they asked to see the "guardians of the city" and the city guard was paraded before them. They said that these were not the guardians of the city but its destroyers, which prompted the citizens to ask who, then, could be considered the guardians. The rabbis answered, "The scribes and the scholars," referring them to ''Tehillim'' ([[Psalms]]) Chapter 127.&lt;ref name="whatnk"&gt;[http://www.nkusa.org/aboutus/index.cfm What is the Neturei Karta?] (NKUSA) Accessed: December 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

It is this role that Neturei Karta see themselves as fulfilling by defending what they believe is "the position of the [[Torah]] and authentic unadulterated Judaism."&lt;ref name="whatnk" /&gt;

==History==
{{further information|Haredim and Zionism}}

Generally, members of Neturei Karta are descendants of [[Hungary|Hungarian]] Jews who settled in [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Jerusalem's Old City]] in the early nineteenth century, and from [[Lithuanian Jews]] who were students of the [[Vilna Gaon|Gaon of Vilna]] (known as ''[[Perushim]]''), who had settled earlier. In the late nineteenth century, their ancestors participated in the creation of new neighborhoods outside the city walls to alleviate overcrowding in the Old City, and most are now concentrated in the neighborhood of [[Batei Ungarin]] and the larger [[Meah Shearim]] neighborhood.

At the time, they were vocal opponents to the new political ideology of [[Zionism]] that was attempting to assert Jewish sovereignty in [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-controlled [[History of Palestine#Ottoman era|Palestine]]. They resented the new arrivals, who were predominantly non-religious, while they asserted that Jewish redemption could be brought about only by the Jewish messiah.
[[File:Al-Quds 2014 Berlin 20140725 173841.jpg|thumb|Members of Neturei Karta at the [[Quds Day]] protests in Berlin 2014]]

Neturei Karta was founded by Rabbi [[Amram Blau]] and Rabbi Aharon Katzenelbogen. Rabbi Blau was a native of [[Meah Shearim]] in Jerusalem and was active in the [[Agudat Israel]] during the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate]] era.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nkusa.org/Books/Publications/guardians.cfm |title=The Guardians of the City |last=Zimmer |first=Uriel |accessdate=2007-01-22 |publisher=Neturei Karta International}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, by the 1930s, the Aguda began to adopt a more compromising and accommodationist approach to the Zionist movement. This caused Rabbi Blau to split with the Aguda in 1937 and alongside of Rabbi Katzenelbogen found Chevrat HaChayim, which was soon to be known thereafter as Neturei Karta.&lt;ref&gt;Rabbi Amram Blau Founder of the Neturei Karta Movement: An Abridged Biography. Motti Inbari, Hebrew Union College Annual,Vol. 81 (2010), pp. 11-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other [[Orthodox Jewish]] movements, including some who oppose Zionism, have denounced the activities of the radical branch of Neturei Karta. According to ''[[The Guardian]]'', "[e]ven among [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]], or ultra-Orthodox circles, the Neturei Karta are regarded as a wild fringe".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/religion/Story/0,2763,846993,00.html In a state over Israel] by Simon Rocker (''[[The Guardian]]'') November 25, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Neturei Karta is sometimes confused with [[Satmar (Hasidic dynasty)|Satmar]], due to both being [[anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]]. They are separate groups and have had disagreements.&lt;ref name="Levenson2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alan T. Levenson|title=The Wiley-Blackwell History of Jews and Judaism|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KgJtcvs7ObAC&amp;pg=PT455|accessdate=7 January 2013|date=12 March 2012|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-1-118-23293-4|page=455}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neturei Karta asserts that the mass media deliberately downplays their viewpoint and makes them out to be few in number. Their protests in America are usually attended by, at most, a few dozen people. In Israel, the group's protests typically attract several hundred participants, depending on the nature of the protest and its location.&lt;ref&gt;Connections Magazine "In 'Honor' of Yom Haatzmaut: A Few RBS Haredim Wore Sackcloth and Hung Palestinian Flags" Temura, 1 May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013, the [[Shin Bet]] arrested a 46-year-old member of Neturei Karta for allegedly attempting to [[espionage|spy]] on Israel for [[Iran]]. As part of a [[plea deal]], the man was sentenced to 4{{fraction|1|2}} years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.jta.org/2014/01/28/news-opinion/israel-middle-east/israeli-neturei-karta-member-sentenced-for-spying-for-iran|title=Israeli Neturei Karta member sentenced for spying for Iran|date=28 January 2014|publisher=Jewish Telegraphic Agency|accessdate=29 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Neturei Karta has denied that he had ever been a member of their group.&lt;ref&gt;http://nkusa.org/articles/slander.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

Neturei Karta's website states that its members "frequently participate[s] in public burning of the Israeli flag." On the Jewish holiday of [[Purim]], Neturei Karta members have routinely burned Israeli flags in celebrations in cities such as [[London]], [[Brooklyn]] and [[Jerusalem]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkusa.org/activities/demonstrations/israeliflag.cfm Public burning of the Israeli flag] at NKI International website.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediagallery.usatoday.com/Neturei+Karta neturei karta photos] by Sebastian Scheiner, [[Associated Press]], November 20, 2007, available at [[USA Today]] Photos.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3856290,00.html Neturei Karta burn Israeli flags in Jerusalem] by Kobi Nahshoni, Ynet news, March 2, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesofisrael.com/conference-of-presidents-time-to-cut-off-neturei-karta/ Conference of Presidents: Time to cut off Neturei Karta] by Ron Friedman, ''[[Times of Israel]], April 4, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishpress.com/news/httpwww-jewishpress-comwp-adminmedia-new-php/2014/01/28/ Neturei Karta Spy for Iran Sentenced to Four Years in Jail] by Tzvi Ben-Gedalyahu, ''[[Jewish Press]]'', January 28, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

While many in Neturei Karta chose to simply ignore the [[State of Israel]], this became more difficult. Some took steps to condemn Israel and bring about its eventual dismantling until the coming of the [[Jewish Messiah|Messiah]]. Chief among these was [[Moshe Hirsch]], leader of an activist branch of Neturei Karta, who served in [[Yasser Arafat]]'s cabinet as Minister for Jewish Affairs.&lt;ref name="MeltonBaumann2010"&gt;{{cite book|author1=J. Gordon Melton|author2=Martin Baumann|title=Religions of the World, Second Edition: A Comprehensive Encyclopedia of Beliefs and Practices|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=v2yiyLLOj88C&amp;pg=PA2066|accessdate=7 January 2013|date=21 September 2010|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-204-3|page=2066}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beliefs==
[[File:Neturei Karta in Boston 2.jpg|thumb|Neturei Karta members at an event in [[Boston, Massachusetts]].]]
Neturei Karta stress what is said in the [[mussaf]] [[Shemona Esrei]] of [[Jewish holidays|Yom Tov]], that because of their sins, the Jewish people went into exile from the [[Land of Israel]] ("''umipnei chatoeinu golinu meiartzeinu''{{-"}}). Additionally, they maintain the view&amp;nbsp;– based on the Babylonian [[Talmud]]&lt;ref name="ketuvot"&gt;''[[Talmud]]'', ''Tractate Kesubos'', 111a&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;– that any form of forceful recapture of the Land of Israel is a violation of divine will. They believe that the restoration of the Land of Israel to the Jews should happen only with the coming of the Messiah, not by [[self-determination]].

Neturei Karta believe that the exile of the Jews can end only with the arrival of the Messiah, and that human attempts to establish Jewish sovereignty over the Land of Israel are sinful. In Neturei Karta's view, Zionism is a presumptuous affront against [[Names of God in Judaism|God]]. Chief among their arguments against Zionism is the [[Talmud]]ic concept of the so-called [[Three Oaths]], extracted from the discussion of certain portions of the Bible. It states that a pact consisting of three oaths was made between God, the Jewish people, and the nations of the world, when the Jews were sent into exile. One provision of the pact was that the Jews would not rebel against the non-Jewish world that gave them sanctuary; a second was that they would not immigrate en masse to the [[Land of Israel]]. In return the gentile nations promised not to persecute the Jews. By rebelling against this pact, they argued, the Jewish people were engaging in rebellion against God.

The Neturei Karta synagogues follow the customs of the [[Gaon of Vilna]], due to Neturei Karta's origin within the [[Lithuanian Jews|Lithuanian]] rather than [[Hasidic Judaism|Hasidic]] branch of ultra-[[Orthodox Judaism]]. Neturei Karta is not a Hasidic but a [[Litvish]] group; they are often mistaken for Hasidim because their style of dress (including a [[shtreimel]] on [[Shabbat|Shabbos]]) is very similar to that of Hasidim. This style of dress is not unique to Neturei Karta, but is also the style of other Jerusalem Litvaks, such as Rabbi [[Yosef Sholom Eliashiv]] and his followers. Furthermore, [[Shomer Emunim]], a Hasidic group with a similar anti-Zionist ideology, is often bundled together with Neturei Karta. Typically, the Jerusalem Neturei Karta will keep the customs of the "Old ''Yishuv''{{-"}} of the city of Jerusalem even when living outside of Jerusalem or even when living abroad, as a demonstration of their love for and connection to the Holy Land.

==Factionalism==
[[File:Nkcherem.jpg|thumb|Condemnation poster, or [[pashkvil]]]]
In the [[United States]], the Neturei Karta are led by [[Moshe Ber Beck]] of [[Monsey, New York]]. They affiliate with the radical branch led by Moshe Hirsch.  Beck has courted controversy by meeting with [[Nation of Islam]] leader Minister [[Louis Farrakhan]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.finalcall.com/national/noi_rabbis1-11-2000.htm  Third meeting held between Nation of Islam and rabbis] by Saeed Shabazz ([[The Final Call|Final Call]]) January 11, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; who has been accused of inciting [[antisemitism]] and of describing [[Judaism]] as a "gutter religion" (although Farrakhan insists his words were misinterpreted &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noi.org/statements/rift/Wanniski12-22-1997.htm|title=Minister Farrakhan rebuts fraudulent "Judaism is a Gutter Religion" canard|date=December 22, 1997|publisher=The Nation of Islam}}&lt;/ref&gt;). In addition, after meeting with the representatives from Neturei Karta, Farrakhan indicated he would be more cautious in his choice of words in the future.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkusa.org/Books/Publications/exileandredemption.cfm Exile and Redemption: The Torah Approach] by a Friend of Neturei Karta (NKUSA) February, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with the Palestinians===
After two men associated with the radical branch of Neturei Karta participated in a 2004 prayer vigil for [[Yasser Arafat]] outside the [[Hôpital d'instruction des armées Percy|Percy Military Hospital]] in [[Paris]], [[France]], where he lay on his death bed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/11/11/international/europe/11vigil.html?_r=0|publisher=New York Times|title=Arafat's Followers Kept Solemn Vigil Outside Hospital in France|author=Elaine Sciolino|date=November 11, 2004|accessdate=January 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the radical branch of Neturei Karta was widely condemned by other Orthodox Jewish organizations, including many other anti-Zionist Haredi organizations both in New York and Jerusalem. [[Moshe Hirsch]], and what Hirsch's faction described as an "impressive contingent" of other members, attended Arafat's funeral in Ramallah.

Almost a year after the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|Gaza War]] a group of Neturei Karta members crossed into [[Gaza Strip|Gaza]] as part of the [[Gaza Freedom March]] to celebrate Jewish ''[[Shabbos]]'' to show support for Palestinians in the Hamas ruled enclave.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.haaretz.com/news/anti-zionist-ultra-orthodox-jews-celebrate-sabbath-in-gaza-1.265558 |date=January 1, 2010 |title= Anti-Zionist ultra-Orthodox Jews celebrate Sabbath in Gaza|work=Haaretz}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3828351,00.html "Ultra-Orthodox Jews make rare visit to Gaza,"] Associated Press, Published: 01.01.10, www.ynetnews.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relations with Iran and President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad===


In October 2005, Neturei Karta leader Rabbi [[Yisroel Dovid Weiss]] issued a statement criticising Jewish attacks on [[Iran]]ian President [[Mahmoud Ahmadinejad]]. Weiss wrote that Ahmadinejad's statements were not "indicative of anti-Jewish sentiments", but rather, "a yearning for a better, more peaceful world", and "re-stating the beliefs and statements of [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], who always emphasized and practiced the respect and protection of Jews and Judaism."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nkusa.org/activities/Statements/2005Oct28Iran.cfm The Orthodox Jewish response to the criticism of the Iranian President (statement for Al Q'uds Day)] (NKUSA) October 28, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, several members of a Neturei Karta's faction visited [[Iran]] where they met with Iranian leaders, including the Vice-President, and praised Ahmadinejad for calling for the Zionist regime occupying Jerusalem to vanish from the pages of time. The spokesmen commented that they shared Ahmadinejad's aspiration for "a disintegration of the Israeli government". In an interview with Iranian television reporters, Rabbi Weiss remarked, "The Zionists use the Holocaust issue to their benefit. We, Jews who perished in the Holocaust, do not use it to advance our interests.  We stress that there are hundreds of thousands Jews around the world who identify with our opposition to the Zionist ideology and who feel that Zionism is not Jewish, but a political agenda. ... What we want is not a withdrawal to the '67 borders, but to everything included in it, so the country can go back to the Palestinians and we could live with them ..."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/Ext/Comp/ArticleLayout/CdaArticlePrintPreview/1,2506,L-3226600,00.html  Neturei Karta in Iran: Zionists use Holocaust] by Roee Nahmias ([[YNetNews]]) March 12, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://fr.jpost.com/servlet/Satellite?cid=1139395563055&amp;pagename=JPost/JPArticle/ShowFull Neturei Karta sect pays visit to Iran]{{dead link|date=February 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} by Michael Freund (''[[Jerusalem Post]]'') March 8, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tehran Holocaust Conference===

In December 2006, members of Neturei Karta, including Yisroel Dovid Weiss, attended the [[International Conference to Review the Global Vision of the Holocaust]], a controversial conference being held in [[Tehran]], [[Iran]] that attracted a number of high-profile Holocaust-deniers.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/6171503.stm  Why are Jews at the 'Holocaust denial' conference?] December 12, [[BBC]] 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

In his speech Weiss explained that the occurrence of the Nazi Holocaust was irrefutable and spoke about the murder of his own grandparents at Auschwitz, but claimed that Zionists had "collaborated with the Nazis" and "thwarted...efforts to save...Jews" and expressed solidarity with the Iranian position of [[anti-Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nkusa.org/activities/speeches/2006iran-weissspeech.cfm|title=Speech by Rabbi Y.

===2008 Mumbai attack on Nariman House===
One of the targets of the [[2008 Mumbai attacks]] was the [[Nariman House]], which was operated by the Jewish [[Chabad]] movement. Neturei Karta subsequently issued a leaflet criticising the [[Chabad]] movement for its relations with "the filthy, deplorable traitors – the cursed [[Zionists]] that are your friends." It added that the Chabad movement has been imbued with "false national sentiment" and criticised the organisation for allowing all Jews to stay in its centres, without differentiating "between good and evil, right and wrong, pure and impure, a Jew and a person who joins another religion, a believer and a heretic." The leaflet also criticised the invitation of Israeli state officials to the funerals of the victims, claiming that they "uttered words of heresy and blasphemy." The leaflet concluded that "the road [Chabad] have taken is the road of death and it leads to doom, assimilation and the uprooting of the Torah."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ynetnews.com/articles/0,7340,L-3638621,00.html Neturei Karta: Chabad punished for alliance with Zionists] by Kobi Nahshoni, Ynet News, December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jta.org/news/article/2008/12/15/1001549/leaflet-mumbai-chabad-attack-gods-punishment Leaflet: Mumbai Chabad attack ‘God’s punishment’], Jewish Telegraphic Agency (JTA), December 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Number Cruncher Politics''' is a political analysis and polling consultancy and blog site launched in 2014. The site is non-partisan and focusses on UK [[opinion polling]], [[psephology]], and [[Statistics|statistical]] analysis. It is perhaps best known&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/comment/columns/dominiclawson/article1554040.ece "If they can’t get the hang of shy Tories, polls should be axed"],"''Sunday Times'', 10th May 2015"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2015/may/08/election-2015-how-shy-tories-confounded-polls-cameron-victory "How 'shy Tories' confounded the polls and gave David Cameron victory"],"''The Guardian'', 8th May 2015"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.economist.com/news/britain/21650716-return-shy-tories "The return of the shy Tories?"],"''The Economist'', 7th May 2015"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2015-07-31/the-blogger-who-beat-the-british-political-pollsters "The Blogger Who Beat the British Political Pollsters"],"''Bloomberg Business'', 31st July 2015"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://understandinguncertainty.org/was-anyone-right-about-pre-election-polls "Was anyone right about the pre-election polls?"],"''Understanding Uncertainty'' (University of Cambridge Statistical Laboratory), 15th May 2015"&lt;/ref&gt; for correctly predicting the polling failure at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]].

==History==

On the eve the 2015 UK election, the site published a lengthy analysis&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncpolitics.uk/2015/05/shy-tory-factor-2015.html/ "Is there a shy Tory factor in 2015?"],"''Number Cruncher Politics'', 6th May 2015"&lt;/ref&gt; of opinion polling accuracy by its founder [[Matt Singh]], based on decades of polling and election data. The report suggested that, contrary to the close race suggested by opinion polls and forecasts, the [[Conservative Party UK|Conservative Party]] would win by more than six percentage points and could win an overall majority. In the event, the Conservative lead in the popular vote was 6.6 points, giving the party an overall majority of 12 seats. After the publication of the broadcasters' exit poll, the post containing the analysis attracted sufficient traffic to crash the website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e97b7716-a026-11e5-8613-08e211ea5317.html#axzz3uE9dUEWK,"Voter samples flawed in UK opinion polls, says ex-Barclays trader"] ''Financial Times'', 14 December 2015"&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Operation Anarchist''' was a joint operation between the American [[National Security Agency]] and British [[Government Communications Headquarters]] to monitor advanced weapons systems in the [[Middle East]], with a particular focus on [[Israel]]. Begun in 1998, it was publicly exposed in January 2016 as a result of documents released by [[Edward Snowden]]. It has been called the worst intelligence breach in Israel's history.

==The Operation==
The operation was run out of GCHQ headquarters in [[Cheltenham]], with most of the surveillance taken from [[RAF Troodos]], a [[Royal Air Force]] highly advanced and sophisticated communications and intelligence installation in the [[Troodos Mountains]] of [[Cyprus]], with [[RAF Menwith Hill]], a joint US-British satellite surveillance base in Britain, also participating. The Israeli Air Force's [[Unmanned aerial vehicle|UAV]] fleet was its primary target. Encrypted video transmissions between drones and their bases were intercepted from Troodos and analyzed using powerful advanced computing systems, as well as the open-source software tools [[ImageMagick]] and AntiSky, which allow users to patiently sort through the pixels in order to decrypt them. This was the preferred method over using the massive computing power it would have taken to unscramble the encrypted signals in near real time. Some images were clearer than others, as the success of the decryption varied. The intercepted images were largely low-resolution analog feeds used to check the condition of the drones, allowing the NSA and GCHQ to see the payloads the drones were carrying, but not the actual surveillance data. Surveillance feeds were, however, sometimes captured from small Israeli drones. GCHQ and NSA also successfully breached the security of Israeli military and communication satellites which were encrypted. 

Capturing these videos became very difficult as Israel shifted to using digital video feeds mixed with other data, with a 2010 GCHQ report noting that it lacked the systems to properly monitor the new Israeli technological capabilities. In addition to footage from drone cameras, the operation also tracked the movements of Israeli drones, using the transmissions drones sent off to update their bases on their location. Satellite surveillance systems at Menwith Hill were used to intercept transmissions between Israeli drones and satellites, capturing 20 separate videos in all. Training missions, as well as operations over the [[Golan Heights]] were monitored, with Israeli preparations for a possible strike on [[Iran]] watched extremely closely. One leaked report noted that Israeli drones were also being monitored due to Israeli UAV exports to many other countries, and ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' noted that this, along with the great interest shown in precisely what radar was mounted on the drones, indicated a commercial interest in the drones in addition to a security interest.

While drones were the primary target, on January 3, 2008, computer technicians from Menwith Hill managed to capture 14 seconds of cockpit footage from an Israeli F-16 fighter jet on a bombing mission over Gaza, showing a target on the ground being closely tracked.  A sub-operation of Operation Anarchist, code-named Operation Runway, tracked the Israeli [[Sparrow missile|Black Sparrow]] air-launched missiles, which were used as targeting missiles during tests of the [[Arrow (Israeli missile)|Arrow missile]].

In addition to Israel, advanced weapons systems used by [[Egypt]], [[Turkey]], [[Iran]], [[Syria]], and [[Hezbollah]] were also hacked into. In particular, the operation managed to obtain footage of Iranian-made drones operated by Hezbollah and Syrian Armed Forces.

==Exposure==
On January 28, 2016, ''[[The Intercept]]'', ''[[Der Spiegel]]'', and ''[[Yedioth Ahronoth]]'' jointly broke the story, based on documents provided by NSA leaker [[Edward Snowden]].

Israel announced that it was disappointed, but not surprised by the reports. An Israeli security official referred to Operation Anarchist as "an earthquake… the worst leak in the history of Israeli intelligence."

'''Pauline Frannzisca Dempers''' (born 28 April 1962 in [[Aranos]], [[Hardap Region]]) is a Namibian human rights activist and politician. In 1996, Dempers became national coordinator for [[Breaking the Wall of Silence]] (BWS), a group which advocates for the rights of those detained by [[SWAPO]] during the [[Namibian War of Independence]]. Dempers was active with the [[Congress of Democrats]].&lt;ref name=Expel/&gt;

==Career==
Dempers was a prominent anti-apartheid activist in southern [[Namibia]] prior to fleeing into exile in 1983 to join SWAPO. She and hundreds of other Namibian exiles were arrested by SWAPO in 1986 while living near [[Lubango]], Angola. She was tortured and held in the 'dungeons' of Lubango prior to being released and repatriated to Namibia following the moves towards independence which culminated in March 1990. Dempers became national coordinator for BWS in 1999, three years after its formation.&lt;ref name=NID&gt;[http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=29 Pauline Dempers] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611171611/http://www.nid.org.na/view_book_entry.php?book_id=29 |date=11 June 2011 }} Namibia Institute for Democracy, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Dempers was part of a controversy as a member of the Central Committee of the then-party of opposition [[Congress of Democrats]]. She and other committee members were expelled by a faction of the party led by [[Ben Ulenga]]. She joined up with the faction led by [[Ignatius Shixwameni]] and formed an 'interim national committee'.&lt;ref name=Expel&gt;[http://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=28&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=32127&amp;no_cache=1 Rival CoD groups expel each other] ''[[The Namibian]]'', 13 August 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Albert Einstein]] was widely known during his lifetime for his work with the [[theory of relativity]] and physics in general. He was also an important peace activist, a [[world federalist]] and a [[socialist]]. His political opinions were of public interest through the middle of the 20th century due to his fame and involvement in political, humanitarian and academic projects around the world. He was often called upon to give judgments and opinions on matters often unrelated to theoretical physics or mathematics. Einstein's visible position in society allowed him to speak and write frankly, even provocatively, at a time when many people were silenced due to the rise of the [[Nazism|Nazi]] movement.

==Humanitarianism==

Einstein participated in the 1927 congress of the [[League against Imperialism]] in [[Brussels]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://san.beck.org/15-4-ChinaCivilWar1927-37.html|title=''Nationalist-Communist Civil War 1927–1937''|accessdate=2007-10-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071011161337/http://www.san.beck.org/15-4-ChinaCivilWar1927-37.html| archivedate= 11 October 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Einstein also met with many humanists and humanitarian luminaries including [[Rabindranath Tagore]] with whom he had extensive conversations in 1930 prior to leaving Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sawf.org/newedit/edit03192001/musicarts.asp Sawf.org&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Born in [[Ulm]], Einstein was a German citizen from birth. As he grew older, Einstein's [[pacifism]] often clashed with the German Empire's militant views at the time. At the age of 17, Einstein renounced his German citizenship and moved to [[Switzerland]] to attend college. The loss of Einstein's citizenship allowed him to avoid service in the military, which suited his pacifist views. In response to a [[Manifesto of the Ninety-Three]] signed by 93 leading German intellectuals including [[Max Planck]] in support of the German war effort, Einstein and three others wrote a counter-manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=American Institute of Physics|work=American Institute of Physics |title=Albert Einstein: Public Concerns |url=http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/public1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Einstein accepted a position at the University of Berlin in 1914, returning to Germany where he spent his time during the rest of World War I.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=American Museum of Natural History|work=Einstein |title=Europe at War|url=http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/einstein/peace-and-war/europe-at-war}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein also reacquired his German citizenship. In the years after the war, Einstein was very vocal in his support for Germany. In 1918, Einstein was one of the founding members of the [[German Democratic Party]].&lt;ref name="Einstein2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rowe|first1=David E.|title=Einstein on Politics: His Private Thoughts and Public Stands on Nationalism, Zionism, War, Peace, and the Bomb|last2=Schulmann|first2=Robert|date=2007-04-16|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=978-0-691-12094-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|83}} In 1921, Einstein refused to attend the third [[Solvay Congress]] in [[Belgium]], as his German compatriots were excluded. In 1922, Einstein joined a committee sponsored by the [[League of Nations]], but quickly left when the League refused to act on [[France]]'s [[occupation of the Ruhr|occupation of the]] [[Ruhr]] in 1923. As a member of the [[German League of Human Rights]], Einstein worked hard to repair relations between Germany and France.

Einstein moved to the United States in December 1932, where he worked at the [[California Institute of Technology]] in [[Pasadena, California]],&lt;ref&gt;Clark, R. "Einstein: The Life and Times" Harper-Collins, 1984. 880 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; and lectured at [[Abraham Flexner]]'s newly founded [[Institute for Advanced Study]] in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

During the 1930s and into World War II, Einstein wrote [[affidavit]]s recommending United States [[visa (document)|visas]] for European Jews who were trying to flee persecution and lobbied for looser immigration rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Onion|first=Rebecca|title=Einstein's 1941 Letter to Eleanor Roosevelt, Begging Asylum for Jewish Refugees|url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_vault/2013/12/13/albert_einstein_eleanor_roosevelt_1941_letter_asking_the_first_lady_to_help.html|newspaper=[[Slate Magazine]]|publisher=|accessdate=13 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He raised money for Zionist organizations and was, in part, responsible for the 1933 formation of the [[International Rescue Committee]].&lt;ref name = "zqhsnv"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;which gives support and shelter to refugees from social and political persecution.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Germany, ''[[Deutsche Physik]]'' activists published pamphlets and even textbooks denigrating Einstein. Nobel laureates [[Philipp Lenard]] and [[Johannes Stark]] led a campaign to eliminate Einstein's work from the German lexicon as unacceptable "[[Jewish physics]]" (''Jüdische Physik''). Instructors who taught his theories were [[blacklist]]ed, including Nobel laureate [[Werner Heisenberg]], who had debated quantum probability with Bohr and Einstein. Philipp Lenard claimed that the [[mass–energy equivalence]] formula needed to be credited to [[Friedrich Hasenöhrl]] to make it an [[Aryan race#Nazism|Aryan]] creation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mathpages.com/rr/s8-08/8-08.htm|title=MathPages&amp;nbsp;— Reflections on Relativity: Who Invented Relativity?|accessdate=2007-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ame.epfl.ch/biblio/schlatter1.pdf|title=Philipp Lenard et la physique aryenne|author=Christian Schlatter|publisher=École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne|date=April 2002|accessdate=2007-06-25|format=PDF |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070626191134/http://ame.epfl.ch/biblio/schlatter1.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-06-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A man convicted of inciting others to kill Einstein was fined a mere six dollars.&lt;ref name="organ"&gt;{{Citation|last=Hawking|first=S.

After World War II ended, and the Nazis were removed from power, Einstein refused to associate with Germany. Einstein refused several honors bestowed upon him by Germany, as he could not forgive the Germans for the [[Holocaust]], where six million of his fellow Jews were killed.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author=American Institute of Physics|work=American Institute of Physics |title=Albert Einstein: Nuclear Age II |url=http://www.aip.org/history/einstein/nuclear2.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein, however, re-visited Germany on a trip to Europe in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.faz.net/aktuell/wissen/physik-mehr/raetselhafter-brief-von-physiker-albert-einstein-13928338.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein publicly stated reservations about the proposal to partition the British mandate of Palestine into independent Arab and Jewish countries. In a 1938 speech, "Our Debt to Zionism", he said: "I should much rather see reasonable agreement with the Arabs on the basis of living together in peace than the creation of a Jewish state. My awareness of the essential nature of Judaism resists the idea of a Jewish state with borders, an army, and a measure of temporal power, no matter how modest. I am afraid of the inner damage Judaism will sustain—especially from the development of a narrow nationalism within our own ranks, against which we have already had to fight strongly, even without a Jewish state. ... If external necessity should after all compel us to assume this burden, let us bear it with tact and patience.".&lt;ref name="Rowe 2007, p 33"&gt;[[David E.

The United Nations ultimately recommended division the mandate and the establishment of a [[State of Israel|Jewish State]], and the [[1948 Arab-Israeli war]] broke out as the mandate ended. Einstein was one of the authors of an open letter to the ''[[New York Times]]'' in 1948&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/New_Palestine_Party;_Visit_of_Menachen_Begin_and_Aims_of_Political_Movement_Discussed|title=New Palestine Party; Visit of Menachen Begin and Aims of Political Movement Discussed|last=Abramowitz|first=Isidore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/AlbertEinsteinLetterToTheNewYorkTimes.December41948|title=Albert Einstein Letter to The New York Times.

Einstein served on the Board of Governors of [[The Hebrew University|The Hebrew University of Jerusalem]]. In his Will of 1950, Einstein bequeathed literary rights to his writings to The Hebrew University, where many of his original documents are held in the [[Albert Einstein Archives]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Albert Einstein Archives |chapter =History of the Estate of Albert Einstein |title =Albert Einstein Archives |publisher =The Hebrew University of Jerusalem |year =2007 |chapter-url =http://albert-einstein.org/history5.html |url =http://albert-einstein.org/ |accessdate =2007-03-25 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070329121541/http://www.albert-einstein.org/| archivedate= 29 March 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil rights==

Einstein was a proponent of [[civil rights]]. When he arrived in America, he objected to the mistreatment of [[African American]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/einstein/global-citizen/civil-rights-movement &lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein, who had experienced heavy anti-Semitic discrimination in pre-World War II Germany, worked with a number of leading civil rights activists&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/exhibitions/past-exhibitions/einstein/global-citizen/civil-rights-movement Civil Rights Movement&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and civil rights organizations (such as the Princeton chapter of the [[NAACP]]) to demand equality and denounce racism and segregation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monthlyreview.org/2005/05/01/albert-einstein-radical-a-political-profile Albert Einstein, Radical: A Political Profile :: Monthly Review&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Wherever he saw injustice, Einstein spoke out. When African-American singer and civil rights supporter [[Marian Anderson]] was denied rooms at hotels and forbidden to eat at public restaurants, Einstein invited her to his home. After a bloody racial riot in 1946 in which 500 state troopers with submachine guns attacked and destroyed virtually every black-owned business in a four-square-block area in Tennessee and arrested 25 black men for attempted murder, Einstein joined [[Eleanor Roosevelt]], [[Langston Hughes]], and [[Thurgood Marshall]] to fight for justice for the men. Later, 24 of the 25 defendants were acquitted.

In 1946, the Nobel Prize-winning physicist traveled to [[Lincoln University (Pennsylvania)|Lincoln University]] in Pennsylvania, the alma mater of Langston Hughes and Thurgood Marshall and the first school in America to grant college degrees to blacks. At Lincoln, Einstein received an honorary degree and gave a lecture on relativity to Lincoln students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2007/04/albert-einstein-civil-rights-activist/ Albert Einstein, Civil Rights activist | Harvard Gazette&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, when two black couples were murdered in [[Monroe, Georgia]], and justice was not served, Einstein was so outraged, he lent his prominence to actor and activist [[Paul Robeson]]’s [[American Crusade to End Lynching]] and wrote a letter to President [[Harry S. Truman|Truman]] calling for prosecution of lynchers and passage of a federal anti-lynching law. He became good friends with Robeson and when Robeson was blacklisted because of his activism against racism, again it was Einstein who opened his home to his long-time friend of 20 years.

From the [[Scottsboro Boys]] case to the numerous attempts to stop the execution of [[Willie McGee (convict)|Willie McGee]], a black Mississippi sharecropper accused of raping a white woman, and efforts to prevent New Jersey from extraditing Sam Buckhannon, a black Georgian who had escaped a chain gang after serving 18 years for stealing a pack of cigarettes, Einstein used his fame to condemn [[American racism]].
==Eastern Asians==
Written between October 1922 and March 1923, the diaries of Einstein released in 2018 contains what has been called racist remarks. He notes how the “Chinese don’t sit on benches while eating but squat like Europeans do when they relieve themselves out in the leafy woods. All this occurs quietly and demurely. Even the children are spiritless and look obtuse.” After earlier writing of the “abundance of offspring” and the “fecundity” of the Chinese, he goes on to say: “It would be a pity if these Chinese supplant all other races. For the likes of us the mere thought is unspeakably dreary.” 

Einstein’s perceptions of the Japanese he meets are, in contrast, more positive: “Japanese unostentatious, decent, altogether very appealing,” he writes. “Pure souls as nowhere else among people. One has to love and admire this country.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/jun/12/einsteins-travel-diaries-reveal-shocking-xenophobia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scmp.com/culture/books/article/2150515/einsteins-travel-diaries-reveal-racist-views-chinese-industrious&lt;/ref&gt;

== Gay rights ==
Einstein was one of the thousands of signatories of [[Magnus Hirschfeld]]'s petition against [[Paragraph 175]] of the German penal code, which condemned homosexuality. The petition ran for more than thirty years in the intellectual circles thanks to the activity of Hirschfeld's ''Wissenschaftlich-humanitäres Komitee'' (Scientific-Humanitarian Committee), which collected many signatures from the Jewish intellectual elite.&lt;ref&gt;[Carol Dunn, "The Jewish Connection to Homosexuality in the Third Reich", University of Sydney], citing p. 24,[3], John Lauritsen and David Thorstad, ''The Early Homosexual Rights Movement (1864-1935)'', New York Times Change Press, 1974, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

== Animal rights ==
Einstein was opposed to violence against animals, so he thought that one should "embrace all living creatures". Also he sympathized with the idea of [[Vegetarianism]]. The latest indications, a letter written to Hans Mühsam, dated March 30, 1954, suggest that Einstein was a vegetarian for the last year of his life, though he appears to have supported the idea for many years before practicing it himself. In this letter Einstein states that he was feeling quite well without non-vegetarian food and that "man was not born to be a carnivore". But already a year before he wrote in another letter: "I have always eaten animal flesh with a somewhat guilty conscience".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ivu.org/history/northam20a/einstein.html|title=History of Vegetarianism&amp;nbsp;– Albert Einstein|accessdate=2010-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Alice Calaprice (Hrsg.): ''The Ultimate Quotable Einstein.''

==Atomic bomb==
{{Main article|Manhattan Project}}

Concerned scientists, many of them refugees in the U.S. from German anti-Semitism, recognized the danger of German scientists' developing an [[atomic bomb]] based on the newly discovered phenomena of [[nuclear fission]]. In 1939, the Hungarian émigré [[Leó Szilárd]], having failed to arouse U.S. government interest on his own, worked with Einstein to write a letter to U.S. President [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt]], which Einstein signed, urging U.S. development of such a weapon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Discover Magazine March 2008|title = Chain Reaction: From Einstein to the Atomic Bomb|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2008/mar/18-chain-reaction-from-einstein-to-the-atomic-bomb }}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 11 October 1939 [[Alexander Sachs]], an adviser to Roosevelt on economic affairs, delivered the [[Einstein–Szilárd letter]] and persuaded the president of its importance.&lt;ref name="rhodes"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rhodes|first=Richard|authorlink=Richard Rhodes|title=[[The Making of the Atomic Bomb]]|publisher=Simon and Schuster|location=New York|year=1986|pages=307–314|isbn=0-671-44133-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; "This requires action", Roosevelt told an aide, and authorized secret research into the harnessing of nuclear fission for military purposes.&lt;ref name="rhodes" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = The Atomic Heritage Foundation| title = Einstein's Letter to Franklin D.

By 1942 this effort had become the [[Manhattan Project]], the largest secret scientific endeavor undertaken up to that time. By late 1945, the U.S.,  with support from the United Kingdom and Canada, had developed operational nuclear weapons, and used them on the Japanese cities of [[Hiroshima]] and [[Nagasaki, Nagasaki|Nagasaki]]. Einstein himself did not play a role in the development of the atomic bomb other than signing the letter although he did help the United States Navy with some unrelated theoretical questions it was working on during [[World War II|the war]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Schwarz |first=Frederic |date=April 1998 |publisher =AmericanHeritage.com |title = Einstein's Ordnance|url=http://www.americanheritage.com/articles/magazine/it/1998/4/1998_4_8.shtml |accessdate = 2008-03-23}}{{Unreliable source?|date=June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Linus Pauling]], Einstein later expressed regret about his letter to Roosevelt, adding that Einstein had originally justified his decision because of the greater danger that Nazi Germany would develop the bomb first.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://web.archive.org/web/20061108075927/http://virtor.bar.admin.ch/pdf/ausstellung_einstein_fr/der_pazifist/A-Bomb_Regrets.pdf Scientist Tells of Einstein's A-bomb Regrets]''.

When he was a visible figure working against the rise of Nazism, Einstein had sought help and developed working relationships in both the West and what was to become the [[Soviet bloc]]. After World War II, enmity between the former allies became a very serious issue for people with international résumés. To make things worse, during the first days of [[McCarthyism]], Einstein was writing about a single [[world government]]; it was at this time that he wrote, "I do not know how the third World War will be fought, but I can tell you what they will use in the Fourth&amp;nbsp;— sticks and stones."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |first = Alice |last = Calaprice |title = The new quotable Einstein  |url = http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7921.html |publisher = [[Princeton University Press]] |year = 2005 |isbn = 0-691-12075-7 |page = 173 }} Other versions of the quote exist.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 1949 ''[[Monthly Review]]'' article entitled "Why Socialism?"&lt;ref name=WhySoc&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://monthlyreview.org/598einstein.php |title=Why Socialism? |author=Albert Einstein |publisher=''[[Monthly Review]]'' |date=May 1949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Albert Einstein described a chaotic capitalist society, a source of evil to be overcome, as the "predatory phase of human development" {{Harv|Einstein|1949}}. With [[Albert Schweitzer]] and [[Bertrand Russell]], Einstein lobbied to stop nuclear testing and future bombs. Days before his death, Einstein signed the [[Russell-Einstein Manifesto]], which led to the [[Pugwash Conferences on Science and World Affairs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

Einstein was a member of several [[American Civil Rights Movement (1896–1954)|civil rights]] groups, including the Princeton chapter of the [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]]. When the aged [[W. E. B. Du Bois]] was accused of being a Communist spy, Einstein volunteered as a character witness, and the case was dismissed shortly afterward. Einstein's friendship with activist [[Paul Robeson]], with whom he served as co-chair of the [[American Crusade Against Lynching|American Crusade to End Lynching]], lasted twenty years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/04.12/01-einstein.html|title=Albert Einstein, Civil Rights activist|date=2007-04-12|accessdate=2007-06-11|publisher=Harvard University Gazette|author=Ken Gewertz |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070529080415/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/04.12/01-einstein.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Einstein collaborated with Rabbi Israel Goldstein, [[Middlesex University (Massachusetts)|Middlesex University]] heir C. Ruggles Smith, and activist attorney George Alpert on the Albert Einstein Foundation for Higher Learning, which was formed to create a Jewish-sponsored secular university, open to all students, on the grounds of the former Middlesex University in [[Waltham, Massachusetts]]. Middlesex was chosen in part because it was accessible from both Boston and New York City, Jewish cultural centers of the U.S. Their vision was a university "deeply conscious both of the Hebraic tradition of Torah looking upon culture as a birthright, and of the American ideal of an educated democracy."&lt;ref name="Reis"&gt;{{Citation |last =Reis |first =Arthur H., Jr |year =1998 |title =The Albert Einstein Involvement |journal =Brandeis Review, 50th Anniversary Edition |url =http://www.brandeis.edu/publications/review/50threview/einstein.pdf |accessdate =2007-03-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The collaboration was stormy, however. Finally, when Einstein wanted to appoint British economist [[Harold Laski]] as the university's president, George Alpert wrote that Laski was "a man utterly alien to American principles of democracy, tarred with the Communist brush."&lt;ref name="Reis"/&gt; Einstein withdrew his support and barred the use of his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =New York Times |title =Dr. Einstein Quits University Plan |newspaper =The New York Times |date =22 June 1947 |url =https://www.nytimes.com/1947/06/22/archives/dr-einstein-quits-university-plan-withdraws-support-of-brandeis-and.html |accessdate =2007-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The university opened in 1948 as [[Brandeis University]]. In 1953, Brandeis offered Einstein an honorary degree, but he declined.&lt;ref name="Reis"/&gt;{{Dead link|date=May 2010}}

==Socialism==

Einstein was in favour of [[socialism]] and in opposition to [[capitalism]], as illustrated by the following quote:
{{Quote box|"I am convinced there is only one way to eliminate these grave evils, namely through the establishment of a socialist economy, accompanied by an educational system which would be oriented toward social goals. In such an economy, the means of production are owned by society itself and are utilized in a planned fashion. A planned economy, which adjusts production to the needs of the community, would distribute the work to be done among all those able to work and would guarantee a livelihood to every man, woman, and child. The education of the individual, in addition to promoting his own innate abilities, would attempt to develop in him a sense of responsibility for his fellow-men in place of the glorification of power and success in our present society." | [[Albert Einstein]], ''[[Why Socialism?]]'', 1949 &lt;ref name="WhySoc"/&gt;}}
&lt;br&gt;
Einstein thought highly of [[Vladimir Lenin]], saying: "I honor Lenin as a man who completely sacrificed himself and devoted all his energy to the realization of social justice. I do not consider his methods practical, but one thing is certain: men of his type are the guardians and restorers of humanity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Feuer|first=Lewis S.|date=1989|title=Einstein and the Generations of Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7S_jiIbNq6cC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;pg=PA25#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|location= |publisher=[[Routledge]]|page=25|isbn=978-0878558995}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einstein: An Intimate Study of a Great Man. Dimitri Marianoff, Palma Wayne. p.96&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Ich verehre in Lenin einen Mann, der seine ganze Kraft unter völliger Aufopferung seiner Person für die Realisierung sozialer Gerechtigkeit eingesetzt hat. Seine Methode halte ich nicht für zweckmäßig. Aber eines ist sicher: Männer wie er sind die Hüter und Erneuerer des Gewissens der Menschheit." - [http://alberteinstein.info/vufind1/Record/EAR000014817/TOC#tabnav Einstein Archives: 34-439]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:112mercer.JPG|left|thumb|Einstein's house in Princeton, NJ]]

Einstein held [[Georgism]] (named after the political economist [[Henry George]]) in high regard, writing: "One cannot imagine a more beautiful combination of intellectual keenness, artistic form and fervent love of justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/einstein-albert_letters-to-anna-george-demille-1934.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-12-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110412105846/http://www.cooperativeindividualism.org/einstein-albert_letters-to-anna-george-demille-1934.html |archivedate=2011-04-12 |df= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

Given Einstein's links to Germany and Zionism, his socialist ideals, and his links to Communist figures, the U.S. [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] kept a file on Einstein&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2002/sep2002/eins-s03.shtml |title=The FBI and Albert Einstein}}&lt;/ref&gt; that grew to 1,427 pages.

Einstein considered [[Joseph McCarthy]], a U.S. senator involved in the anti-communist [[Red Scare]], a danger to intellectual freedom. [[William Frauenglass]], a New York city school teacher who, having been called to testify, refused, and  facing dismissal from his position, wrote to Einstein for support. In his reply, Einstein stated: "The reactionary politicians have managed to instill suspicion of all intellectual efforts into the public by dangling before their eyes a danger from without. Having succeeded so far they are now proceeding to suppress the freedom of teaching and to deprive of their positions all those who do not prove submissive, i.e. to starve them."
His advice: "Every intellectual who is called before one of the committees ought to refuse to testify, i.e. he must be prepared for jail and economic ruin, in short, for the sacrifice of his personal welfare in the interest of the cultural welfare of his country."

Concluding, Einstein said, "If enough people are ready to take this grave step they will be successful. If not, then the intellectuals of this country deserve nothing better than the slavery which is intended for them."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to William Frauenglass, published in the New York Times June 12, 1953&lt;/ref&gt;

==War==
[[File:Einstein-cartoon1.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Cartoon of Einstein, depicting him shedding his "Pacifism" wings and raising a sword labeled "Preparedness"  in response to an increasingly hostile Germany (circa 1933).]]

Einstein was a lifelong pacifist and believed that wars stood in the way of human progress.&lt;ref name=Einstein&gt;{{cite book |title= The Fight Against War. Edited by Alfred Lief. |last= Einstein|first=Albert |year= 1933|publisher= [[John Day Company|John Day]]|location= New York |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=UQ85AQAAIAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that wars were the result  of natural aggressive tendencies found within all organisms and that the aims and causes of war were simply justification for these tendencies. He advocated the creation of a supranational organization would make war as impossible in Europe as it was impossible between the former kingdoms that comprised the [[German Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. [http://www.onbeing.org/program/einstein039s-god-einstein039s-ethics/extra/einstein-my-opinion-war-1915/1988 "My Opinion on the War"] (1915)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. To A. Morrisett (March 21, 1952).  Einstein Archive 60-595, quoted in Calaprice, Alice (ed.) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 2005. p.160 {{ISBN|0-691-12075-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Einstein was horrified by the destruction caused by [[World War I]] and promoted what he referred to as the "two percent plan". According to the plan, nations would be unable to wage war if one in 50 men refused to serve in the military.&lt;ref name="johnhorgan.org"&gt;http://www.johnhorgan.org/toward_a_unified_theory_of_einstein_s_life_61298.htm  Author: John Horgan&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite these views, following the rise to power of [[Adolf Hitler]], Einstein became a vocal advocate for preparedness, recognizing the dangers of Nazi Germany gaining an advantage over the [[Allies of World War II|Western Allies]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dannen.com/ae-fdr.html  Einstein to Roosevelt, August 2, 1939&lt;/ref&gt; Alarmed at Hitler’s territorial ambitions, Einstein actively encouraged Belgians to join the military to protect European civilization.&lt;ref name="johnhorgan.org"/&gt; He explained the change in his outlook in 1941:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In the twenties, when no dictatorships existed, I advocated that refusing to go to war would make war improper. But as soon as coercive conditions appeared in certain nations, I felt that it would weaken the less aggressive nations vis-à-vis  the more aggressive ones.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. Interview in ''[[The New York Times]]'' (December 30, 1941.  Einstein Archive 29-096, quoted in Calaprice, Alice (ed.) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 2005. p.159 {{ISBN|0-691-12075-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Einstein justified his letter to President Roosevelt recommending that an atomic bomb be produced by writing:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...it seemed probable that the Germans might be working on the same problem with every prospect of success.  I had no alternative but to act as I did, ''although I have always been a convinced pacifist.'' (emphasis in original)&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert.  Letter to the editor of the Japanese magazine ''Kaizo'' (September 22, 1952), quoted in Calaprice, Alice (ed.) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 2005. p.160  {{ISBN|0-691-12075-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

When questioned about this position, Einstein wrote:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I did not say that I was an ''absolute'' pacifist, but rather that I has always been a ''convinced'' pacifist. While I am a convinced pacifist, there are circumstances in which I believe the use of force is appropriate &amp;ndash; namely, in the face of an enemy unconditionally bent on destroying me and my people. ...  I am a ''dedicated'' but not an ''absolute'' pacifist; this means that I am opposed to the use of force under any circumstances except when confronted by an enemy who pursues the destruction of life as an ''end in itself''. (emphasis in original)&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. Letter to Japanese pacifist Seiei Shinohara (February 22, 1953), quoted in Calaprice, Alice (ed.) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 2005. p.161  {{ISBN|0-691-12075-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He further explained:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have always been a pacifist, i.e. I have declined to recognize brute force as a means for the solution of international conflicts. Nevertheless, it is, in my opinion, not reasonable to cling to that principle unconditionally.  An exception has necessarily to be made if a hostile power threatens wholesale destruction of one's own group.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Albert. To Herbert H. Fox (May 18, 1954), from the Einstein Archive 59-727,  quoted in Calaprice, Alice (ed.) ''The New Quotable Einstein'' Princeton, New Jersey: Princeton University Press, 2005. p.162  {{ISBN|0-691-12075-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Following the conclusion of World War II, Einstein once again became a constant and vocal activist for world peace.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wnet/americanmasters/episodes/albert-einstein/how-i-see-the-world/585/ ''Albert Einstein: How I See the World''] ''[[American Masters]]'' (TV series), [[PBS]] (August 16, 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Republican Left of the Valencian Country''' ({{lang-ca|Esquerra Republicana del País Valencià}}, ERPV) is a Valencian left [[Catalan independentism|nationalist]] and republican party.

The original ERPV was founded in 1933, then disbanded in 1935. In 2000 the vacant ERPV name was taken by the party resulting from the merge of [[Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya]]'s (ERC) Valencian section and the Front pel País Valencià (Front for the Valencian Country).

ERPV is currently the main explicit sponsor of the ''[[Països Catalans]]'' idea in the [[Valencian Country]], where poor electoral results so far limit its participation to a marginal role.&lt;ref name="elpais"&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/espana/dificil/salto/Esquerra/Republicana/elpepuesp/20090530elpepunac_11/Tes]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

===Foundation and disbandment===
The party was founded during the [[Spanish Second Republic]] and became established under the leadership of [[Gaietà Huguet]], in [[Castellón de la Plana|Castellón]]. In 1935, he impelled a merging with the party [[Esquerra Valenciana]] (''Valencian Left'', EV), founded in 1934 and led by Vicent Marco Miranda (ex-Mayor of [[Valencia]]), [[Josep Benedito]], [[Miquel Duran de València]] and [[Manuel Sanchís-Guarner]]. After Vicent Marco obtained in 1936 the act of deputy in Valencia within the candidatures of the [[Popular Front (Spain)|Popular Front]] both parties joint in a common parliamentary group in the Spanish Congress with the name of Catalan Left.

In 1935, ERPV disbanded and merged as a fraction in EV. The [[Spanish Civil War]] truncated many political projects in which Esquerra Valenciana participated, the most important of which was a project of a Valencian statute of autonomy with the official name of ''País Valencià'' (rendered in English by some as "Valencian Country", see [[names of the Valencian Community]]), which would have granted similar autonomous powers as with the other so-called historical nationalities in [[Spain]] (namely, Andalusia, Basque country, Catalonia and Galicia). In spite of it, Esquerra Valenciana, the main party in which ERPV had diluted, reached their maximum growth in that period, arriving to exceed 10,000 affiliated.

Under the regime of [[Francisco Franco]], Esquerra Valenciana (the party which ERPV had merged with in 1935) was suppressed. Then, after Franco's death, the [[Spanish Transition]] and the advent of democracy in Spain, ERPV was not revived.

===Refoundation===

In 2000, a group of members of Esquerra Republicana de Catalunya (ERC) in Valencia, decided to revive the ERPV vacant acronym and, led by [[Agustí Cerdà]], claimed to have [[Republican Left of the Valencian Country (2000)|refounded the party]] as the Valencian branch of ERC.

==Electoral results==
Then, 2003 saw ERPV's comeback to democratic elections in the Valencian Community, after more than 60 years of its last electoral contest. The party participated in elections to a number of Valencian city councils. It did not achieve representation elsewhere other than in [[Sueca (city)|Sueca]].

ERPV run in the 2007 election to the [[Corts Valencianes]] under the "Esquerra" plain name, achieving 0.49% of the total votes&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cortsvalencianes.es/contenido.jsp?id_nodo=4267&amp;&amp;&amp;keyword=&amp;auditoria=F Corts Valencianes&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080312110654/http://www.cortsvalencianes.es/contenido.jsp?id_nodo=4267&amp;&amp;&amp;keyword=&amp;auditoria=F |date=2008-03-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which was far from the 5% threshold needed to achieve representation. Out of a total of 5,622 local councilors elected in the 542 Valencian municipalities, ERPV is currently represented by four local councilors in three municipalities, which limits its participation in Valencian politics to a marginal role.&lt;ref name="elpais"/&gt;

Despite its status in Valencia, at the [[Spanish general election, 2004]] ERPV's leader Agustí Cerdà was elected as an MP himself at the [[Spanish Parliament]]. This was made possible by including him in the ERC [[Barcelona (Spanish Congress Electoral District)|electoral ticket in Catalonia]] instead of running for any given Valencian electoral constituency, where ERPV does not achieve any representation other than the few councilors aforementioned.

Then, at the following [[Spanish general election, 2008]], which saw ERC's results halved in Catalonia, [[Agustí Cerdà]] was one of the incumbents who lost his seat.

The '''Respect Party'''&lt;!-- Official name, the [https://pefonline.electoralcommission.org.uk/search/searchintro.aspx Electoral Commission website] resists linking to relevant pages directly. --&gt; was a [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] to [[Far-left politics|far-left]] [[political party]] active in the [[United Kingdom]] between 2004 and 2016. At the height of its success in 2007, the party had one Member of Parliament (MP) in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] and nineteen councillors in [[Local government in the United Kingdom|local government]].

The Respect Party was established in London by [[Salma Yaqoob]] and [[George Monbiot]] in 2004. It grew out of the [[Stop the War Coalition]], and from the start revolved largely around opposition to the United Kingdom's role in the [[Iraq War]]. Uniting a range of leftist and anti-war groups, it was unofficially allied to the far-left [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP) and [[Muslim Association of Britain]] (MAB). In [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005]], Respect's candidate [[George Galloway]] was elected MP for [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]], while the party came second in three other constituencies. The party made further gains in the 2006 and 2007 local elections, at which point its support peaked. In 2007, a schism emerged in the party between SWP-supporters and the [[Respect Renewal]] group led by Galloway and Yaqoob; the former group left the party to form the [[Left List]]. Over the coming years, Respect gradually lost its council seats and it deregistered with the [[Electoral Commission (United Kingdom)|Electoral Commission]] in 2016.

Avowedly [[socialism|socialist]] and opposed to [[capitalism]], it called for the nationalisation of much of the UK economy, increased funding to public services, and further measures to tackle poverty and discrimination. It was [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] and promoted an [[anti-imperialism|anti-imperialist]] worldview. It was also [[Anti-Zionism|Anti-Zionist]], opposing the existence of Israel and endorsing the Palestinian solidarity movement. Several commentators claimed that [[Islamism]] was a component of its ideology and regarded it as part of a wider alliance between socialists and Islamists within Western Europe. Respect's voting base was primarily among the British Muslim communities in [[East London]], [[Birmingham]] and [[Bradford]], where it built upon opposition to the Iraq War and disenchantment among leftist voters with the governing [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]].

==Ideology==
The political scientists [[Matthew Goodwin]] and Robert Ford characterised Respect as a "broad coalition of left-wing interests" which had arisen in opposition to the [[New Labour]] government and the UK's involvement in the invasion of Iraq.{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=238}} Other political scientists characterised the party as [[far-left]].{{sfnm|1a1=Benedek|1y=2007|1p=154|2a1=Clark|2y=2012|2p=112}} The socialist activist [[Tariq Ali]] characterised the party's programme as being [[social democracy|social democratic]] in orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ali|first=Tariq|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2012/mar/31/george-galloway-respect-tariq-ali|title=George Galloway's Respect could help Britain to break the political impasse|work=The Guardian|date=31 March 2012|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Eran Benedek described the party as "an amalgamation of radical international socialism and Islamism",{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=153}} adding that its radical socialist position was informed by [[Marxism-Leninism]] and [[Trotskyism]].{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} Benedek characterised it as a manifestation of what [[Amir Taheri]] called the "Marxist-Islamist coalition" which united around opposition to the United States, a desire to destroy the state of Israel, and a wish to overthrow international capitalism.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} Similarly, Emmanuel Karagiannis characterised the party as "the epitome" of the "convergence" between radical left and Islamist groups in Western Europe.{{sfn|Karagiannis|2012|p=209}}

===Socialism and anti-capitalism===
The party's policies have been described as "traditionally leftist and anti-capitalist".{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=158}}
Respect encouraged the nationalisation of many sectors of the economy, including the railways, water, gas, electricity, and the [[North Sea]] oil industry.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} It urged a substantial increase in [[corporation tax]] in order to increase funding to public services.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} It sought to overturn what it described as "anti-trade union" legislation,{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=158}} and to introduce policies to deal with issues of poverty and discrimination.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} Respect promoted [[revolutionary socialism]] and [[international socialism]].{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=154}}
The party was largely hostile to Western [[capitalism]] and [[neoliberalism]] and interpreted many world events through the prism of [[anti-imperialism]],{{sfn|Benedek|2007|pp=154, 155}} calling for an end to what it characterised as imperialist wars like that in Iraq.{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=158}} Respect was [[anti-globalization]], believing that it resulted in the exploitation of the working class.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}} It also expressed a [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]] approach to the [[European Union]], deeming the Union to be lacking in democracy and exploitative toward the working class.{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=112}}

===Anti-Zionism===
Respect was [[Anti-Zionism|anti-Zionist]] and rejected the state of Israel's right to exist.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|pp=153, 154}} It rhetorically presented this position through the terminology of [[social justice]] and [[human rights]].{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=156}} One of its core principles was stated support for the [[Palestinian people]] and opposition to what Respect described as "the apartheid system that oppresses them".{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} It was constitutionally committed to supporting the [[Palestine Solidarity Campaign]] and the boycotting of Israel.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} It calls for Israel to withdraw from any land conquered in 1967, and for the right of return to be granted to all Palestinians forced to move on the formation of the state of Israel in 1948.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=156}} On its website and published fliers, it included maps of the Levant in which the entirety of Israel was labelled "Occupied Palestine".{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=157}} In 2017, the party's website asserts: "Respect supports the idea of a democratic bi-national solution of one state from the Jordan River to the Mediterranean Sea in which all people, Jews, Muslims and Christians live equally; one man, one woman, one vote" and says British foreign policy should recognise Britain's "partial responsibility for the problem by their participation in the creation of the state of Israel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.respectparty.org/international/arab-world/|title=Arab World|publisher=Respect Party|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the party's national council member [[Yvonne Ridley]], speaking at London's [[Imperial College London|Imperial College]] in February 2006, Respect "is a Zionist-free party... if there was any Zionism in the Respect Party they would be hunted down and kicked out."{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=156}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Das|first=Shamik|url=https://leftfootforward.org/2012/11/yvonne-ridley-respect-rotherham-hamas/|title=Yvonne Ridley: Says Zionists should be “hunted down”; 'loathes' Israel; supports Hamas…|work=Left Foot Forward|date=15 November 2012|accessdate=3 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This rejection of Israel's right to exist and characterisation of it as a garrison of [[American imperialism]] in the Middle East had a longer presence in Trotskyist thought, having been espoused by the SWP prior to the establishment of Respect.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=156}}

In February 2013, Galloway walked out of a debate organised by [[Christ Church, Oxford]] because his opponent was an Israeli citizen.&lt;ref&gt;Rob Williams [https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/i-dont-debate-with-israelis-george-galloway-accused-of-racism-after-walking-out-of-middle-east-debate-at-oxford-8505232.html "'I don't debate with Israelis': George Galloway accused of racism after walking out of Middle East debate at Oxford"], ''The Independent'', 21 February 2013&lt;/ref&gt; He explained his actions thus:  "The reason is simple: no recognition, no normalisation. Just boycott, divestment and sanctions, until the apartheid state is defeated. I never debate with Israelis nor speak to their media. If they want to speak about Palestine – the address is the PLO."&lt;ref name="MurrayJones"&gt;Warren Murray and Sam Jones [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/feb/21/george-galloway-debate-israeli-oxford "George Galloway refuses to debate with Israeli student at Oxford",] ''The Guardian'', 21 February 2013; retrieved 21 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Zionist Federation of Great Britain and Ireland|Zionist Federation]] called it a "racist" walkout displaying "xenophobic" tendencies.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2013/02/21/news-opinion/world/british-lawmaker-galloway-called-racist-for-quitting-debate-with-israeli "British lawmaker Galloway called 'racist' for quitting debate with Israeli"], jta.org, 21 February 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect were supportive of anti-Zionist Islamist militant groups like [[Hezbollah]] and [[Hamas]].{{sfn|Karagiannis|2012|p=209}} In July 2006, Respect official [[Lindsey German]] stated that "whatever disagreements I have with Hamas and Hezbollah, I would rather be in their camp... they want democracy. Democracy in the Middle East ''is'' Hamas, ''is'' Hezbollah".{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=157}} In September 2006 Galloway met with Hamas leader [[Khaled Mashal]] and in November 2006 the party's national-secretary [[John Rees (activist)|John Rees]] attended the [[Beirut International Conference]] that was organised by Hezbollah.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=157}}

==History==

===Formation: 2004===

[[File:George Galloway.jpg|right|thumb|upright|Galloway in September 2005]]

Respect emerged from the British anti-war movement which had developed from late 2001 onward.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=406}} The [[Stop the War Coalition]] (StWC) had been established in September 2001, with a central role being played by the [[Socialist Workers Party (UK)|Socialist Workers Party]] (SWP), which was then the largest radical left group in the UK.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=406}} The StWC's President was [[Tony Benn]], a [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] Member of Parliament (MP) until 2001, while it also gained the support of several rebel Labour MPs, among them [[Katy Clark]], [[Jeremy Corbyn]], [[Tam Dalyell]], [[Alice Mahon]], and [[George Galloway]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=406}} The StWC had also attracted significant support from within Britain's Muslim community, and the [[Muslim Association of Britain]] (MAB) officially affiliated itself with the coalition.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=406}} The movement politicised a large number of young British Muslims, among them [[Salma Yaqoob]], who became the head of the StWC branch in [[Birmingham]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=406}}

Galloway later revealed that, about a year before the UK and US launched the Iraq War, he had broached the subject of leaving Labour and establishing a new party with his friends [[Seumas Milne]] and [[Andrew Murray (trade unionist)|Andrew Murray]].{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=154}} At the time—he later stated—he was of the view that UK Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] and US President [[George W. Bush]] had already committed to invading Iraq.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=154}} Galloway was vocal in his opposition to Blair's calls for an invasion, and in May 2003 he was suspended from the Labour Party and then expelled in October, having been found to have brought it into disrepute.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=407}} He then announced that he would stand against Labour in the [[2004 European Parliament elections]], and that he would "seek to unify the red, green, anti-war, Muslim and other social constituencies radicalised by the war, in a referendum on Tony Blair".{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=407}} 

The two main instigators of the party were Yaqoob and ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist [[George Monbiot]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=407}} They had been part of a discussion surrounding the unification of a broad range of anti-war forces that were to the left of Labour, a successor to the [[Socialist Alliance (England)|Socialist Alliance]] electoral list that had contested the [[United Kingdom general election, 2001|2001 general election]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=407}} They wanted to reach out beyond the far left's traditional support base and gain support from peace activists and religious groups, particularly the Muslim community.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=407}} In November 2003, a number of public meetings were held under the title of "British Politics at the Crossroads", at which it was agreed that a new political party should be established.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=407}}  At a convention on 24 January 2004, the party, titled "Respect – the Unity Coalition", was officially declared.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=407}} The name "RESPECT" was a [[contrived acronym]] for [[respect]], [[Social equality|equality]], [[socialism]], [[peace]], [[environmentalism]], [[community]], and [[trade unionism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Benedek|1y=2007|1p=160|2a1=Driver|2y=2011|2p=158|3a1=Peace|3y=2013a|3p=407}}&lt;ref name="Spoon" /&gt; Galloway said in April 2004: "Respect. It's a young word. It's a black word. It's the first postmodern name for an electoral political movement; most are one or other arrangement of the words The, Something, and Party. With respect, we're different."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Tim|title='I've committed many sins'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/apr/25/interviews.iraq|accessdate=4 April 2015|work=The Observer|date=25 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Opposition to the Iraq War was the party's primary issue, around which it galvanised much of its support.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=154}}

{{double image|left|Salma yaqoob smiling.jpg|135|George Monbiot (cropped).jpg|170|The founders of Respect: Yaqoob (left) and Monbiot (right)}}

At its foundation, the party also called for a halt to [[privatisation]] and the renationalisation of the British railways.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=407}} Although it did not secure the full backing of any major trade unions, some local branches of the [[National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers]] (RMT)—which had disaffiliated from Labour in February 2004—voted to support Respect.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=407}} Although containing members from both the SWP and MAB,{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=154}} Respect was not a formal coalition between the two groups.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=154}} There remained tension between SWP members and Muslim leaders within the party from the beginnings of Respect.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=159}} This alliance was also criticised by some observers; in June 2004, the political commentator [[Nick Cohen]] wrote that "for the first time since the Enlightenment, a section of the left is allied with religious fanaticism and, for the first time since the Hitler-Stalin pact, a section of the left has gone soft on fascism."&lt;ref&gt;Nick Cohen [http://www.newstatesman.com/node/148131 "Saddam's very own party"], ''New Statesman'', 7 June 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect initially tried to form an electoral pact with the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] but this proved unsuccessful.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=407–408}}&lt;ref&gt;Matthew Tempest [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/feb/17/iraq.iraq1 "Monbiot quits Respect over threat to Greens"], ''The Guardian'', 17 February 2004&lt;/ref&gt; The Greens stated that they had selected their candidates for the 2004 European Parliamentary elections by postal ballot months previously and that they were also sceptical of the SWP's influence over Respect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/1008/l=7|title=Greens regret attack by Galloway/SWP "Respect" party|accessdate=23 April 2007|year=2004 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070413142818/http://www.greenparty.org.uk/news/1008/l=7 |archivedate = 13 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Respect decided to stand candidates against the Greens, in February 2004 Monbiot stepped down from the party, claiming that to compete against the Greens might threaten the positions of "two of the best elected representatives in Britain", the Green [[Members of the European Parliament]] (MEPs) [[Caroline Lucas]] and [[Jean Lambert]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=408}}

===Early electoral campaigns: 2004–05===
[[File:Respect ESF Fringe meeting.jpg|thumb|right|Respect fringe meeting at the 2004 [[European Social Forum]]]]
Respect fielded candidates for both the 2004 elections for the European Parliament (EP) and for the [[London Assembly]], attempting to present these elections as a referendum on Blair's Labour government.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=408}} The party claims that this support was achieved primarily as a result of the [[Protests against the 2003 Iraq war|anti-war protests]] and by attracting votes from "disillusioned" Labour voters.&lt;ref name="BBC080604"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk_politics/3788125.stm|title=Respect hope for election success|work=BBC News|date=8 June 2004|accessdate=23 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was widely derided in the British media, which viewed Respect as a single-issue party that would soon disappear from British politics.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=408}}

Respect polled a quarter of a million votes in the EP election.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=408}} Its proportion of the national vote was 1.7%, which grew to 5% in London, although it failed to win any seats.{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=158}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=German|first=Lindsey|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jun/18/greenpolitics.uk|title=Respect where it's due|work=The Guardian|date=18 June 2004|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The strong showing of the Greens and the [[UK Independence Party]] had been part of the reason for this failure to secure a seat. In the London Assembly election, Respect secured 4.5% of the vote, meaning that they did not secure a seat on the Assembly.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=408–409}} However, within both the [[London Borough of Newham]] and the [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets]]—both areas with large Muslim populations—Respect secured the largest number of votes, with over 20% in both.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=409}} Respect mocked [[Ken Livingstone]]'s Labour candidacy as the "Blair Mayor Project".&lt;ref name="White2004"&gt;{{cite news|last=White|first=Michael|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/may/21/uk.otherparties|title=Galloway's team demands respect|work=The Guardian|date=21 May 2004|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect's first election victory was in the council by-election for the [[Stepney|St Dunstan's and Stepney Green]] ward of Tower Hamlets, where its candidate, Oliur Rahman, secured 31% of the vote.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=409}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Watt|first=Nicholas|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2004/jul/31/uk.byelections|title=Respect wins seat in London borough|work=The Guardian|date=31 July 2004|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The results at the [[Birmingham Hodge Hill by-election, 2004|Birmingham Hodge Hill]] and [[Leicester South by-election, 2004|Leicester South by-elections]], both held on 15 July 2004, were 6.3% and 12.7% of the vote respectively.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=409}} At the time, Respect had a council seat in Nuneaton and Preston after defections from other parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulholland|first=Hélène|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2004/jul/30/localgovernment.byelections|title=Anti-war coalition wins council seat|work=The Guardian|date=30 July 2004|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RESPECT Bus manchester.jpg|thumb|left|Respect campaigners decorating a bus in [[Manchester]] for the 2005 elections]]
The coalition put up candidates in 26 constituencies across England and Wales,{{sfnm|1a1=Driver|1y=2011|1p=158|2a1=Peace|2y=2013a|2pp=409–410}} just under half of them from the SWP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Aronovitch|first=David|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/columnists/davidaaronovitch/article2051855.ece|title=How did the far Left manage to slip into bed with the Jew-hating Right?|work=The Times|location=London|date=25 June 2005|accessdate=27 February 2016}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Britain's [[first past the post]] electoral system made it difficult for small parties to make gains unless they geographically concentrated their vote.{{sfnm|1a1=Benedek|1y=2007|1p=159|2a1=Peace|2y=2013a|2p=415}} Respect recognised that East London, an area with large numbers of Muslim [[British Bangladeshis]], would be electorally lucrative, particularly as three of the area's four sitting Labour MPs had voted in favour of British participation in the invasion of Iraq.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=409}} In the [[United Kingdom general election, 2005|2005 general election]], Respect fielded candidates in this area: Lindsey German in [[West Ham]], [[Abdul Khaliq Mian]] in [[East Ham]], Rahman in [[Poplar and Canning Town]], and Galloway in [[Bethnal Green and Bow (UK Parliament constituency)|Bethnal Green and Bow]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=409}}

Galloway sought to unseat the sitting Labour MP, [[Oona King]], and the ensuing campaign for the seat has been cited as "one of the most acrimonious in recent history". King accused Galloway of sexual impropriety, although was later forced to retract those allegations. She alleged that she had been the victim of [[Anti-Semitism]] from Respect supporters after having been pelted with eggs at a Jewish memorial service.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=409}}{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} She also claimed that Respect canvassers had urged Muslims not to vote for her because she is Jewish. Respect threatened legal action if King repeated the claim.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Barkham [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2005/apr/12/uk.otherparties "MP accuses Galloway backers of anti-semitism"], ''The Guardian'', 12 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect won 0.3% of the national vote, with an average of 6.8% of the vote in the constituencies it had contested; 17 of its candidates failed to have their deposits returned.{{sfnm|1a1=Driver|1y=2011|1p=158|2a1=Peace|2y=2013a|2p=410}} However, Galloway won the seat of Bethnal Green and Bow by a narrow margin of 823 votes.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=409}} Galloway's surprise victory provided much momentum for his party.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} His victory represented the first time that a party to the left of Labour had won a seat in the Houses of Parliament since 1951.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=405}} Respect also did well in several other constituencies, coming second to Labour in both West Ham and East Ham and also securing second place in [[Birmingham Sparkbrook and Small Heath (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Sparkbrook and Small Heath]], where Yaqoob had been its candidate, securing 27.5% of the vote.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=410}}

Respect made "rapid progress", aided by growing finances and the existing campaign experience of the far left.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} By the end of 2005, in the London Borough of Newham, two Labour and one [[Liberal Democrats (UK)|Liberal Democrat]] councillor had defected to Respect.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=410}} By December 2005, it had an official membership of 5,674.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} Galloway, however, told [[Decca Aitkenhead]] in April 2012 for a ''Guardian'' profile that Respect, at its peak, only had about 3-4,000 members.&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"&gt;{{cite news|last=Aitkenhead|first=Decca|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/29/george-galloway-interview-bradford-west|title=George Galloway: 'I believe that on judgment day, people have to answer for what they did'|work=The Guardian|date=29 April 2016|accessdate=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2007 its university wing, Student Respect, claimed to have branches in over fifty campuses across England and Wales.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} Benedek suggested that this probably made it the fastest growing student political group in the UK.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} The SWP's student group, the Socialist Worker Student Society (SWSS), encouraged its members to join Respect and became largely dormant.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}}

===Local electoral victories: 2006–07===
[[File:GhaziandBlair.jpg|thumb|180px|Respect candidate Ghazi Khan, with someone dressed as Blair, at the 18 March 2006 Anti-War Protest in London]]

In 2006, Galloway appeared on [[Channel 4]]'s reality television show ''[[Celebrity Big Brother (UK TV series)|Celebrity Big Brother]]''.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=410}} His hope was to use it as a public relations exercise in which he could promote his views to a wider audience, however this backfired as Channel 4 producers censored most of his political discussions.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=410}} Media attention instead focused on the fact that he had seemingly abandoned his constituents to appear in the show and on an episode in which he had impersonated a cat.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=410}} This did little to damage Respect's electoral appeal.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=410}}

Respect stood about 150 candidates in the 2006 local elections,{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=410}} at which it secured 16 seats.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=155}} At Respect's campaign launch, Galloway anticipated a "referendum on new Labour", and said the election "will be the last blow that will knock out Tony Blair".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mulholland|first=Hélène|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/apr/10/otherparties.uk|title=Galloway: 'Roasting' Iraqis keeps British pensioners cold|work=The Guardian|date=10 April 2006|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tower Hamlets, Respect took eleven new council seats, giving it a total of twelve and making it the borough's official opposition to Labour.{{sfnm|1a1=Clark|1y=2012|1p=112|2a1=Peace|2y=2013a|2p=410}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Galloway|first=George|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/09/rescuingsomethinglabourfrom|title=Rescuing something labour from the wreckage|work=The Guardian|date=9 May 2006|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/shared/bsp/hi/vote2006/locals/html/bg.stm|title=Local elections: Tower Hamlets|publisher=BBC News|date=5 May 2006|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Manning|first=Luke|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2006/may/05/localelections2006.localgovernment|title=The battle for Tower Hamlets|work=The Guardian|date=5 May 2006|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Newham, Respect gained 26% of the vote and returned its three councillors, although was disappointed not to gain further ones.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=410}} In Birmingham, Respect gained 55% of the vote in the Sparkbrook ward and Yaqoob was elected as the city's first female Muslim councillor.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=410}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Harris|first1=John|title=Respect's Salma Yaqoob: 'Labour has gone a bit mad since Bradford West'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/24/respects-salma-yaqoob-labour-has-gone-mad|accessdate=4 April 2015|work=The Guardian|date=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; None of the new Respect councillors were connected with the SWP. Galloway explained at the time that many Respect supporters "are small business people and wouldn't describe themselves as socialists and are not bound to accept it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Tate|first=David|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2006/may/06/whatisthepointofrespect|title=What is the point of Respect?|work=The Guardian|date=6 May 2006|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect stood 48 candidates in the 2007 local election, of which three were elected.{{sfnm|1a1=Benedek|1y=2007|1p=155|2a1=Peace|2y=2013a|2p=410}} The party had peaked, and following this would witness a decline.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=410}} In July 2007, Galloway was suspended from the House of Commons for 18 days after the standards and privileges commit accused him of a lack of transparency in the financing of is charity, the [[Mariam Appeal]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=410–411}} In August, a Respect councillor in Tower Hamlets resigned, triggering a by-election which Harun Miah narrowly secured for Respect.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=411}}

===Schism: 2007===

The SWP had been members of Respect's "Unity Coalition" since its early years, although relations between them and Galloway had been strained.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=411}} In August 2007 he wrote a letter to the party's national council stating that Respect had various internal weaknesses, with many deeming this a veiled criticism of the SWP.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=411}}&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.themuslimweekly.com/fullstoryview.aspx?NewsID=215082B330A483E173B045F1&amp;MENUID=HOMENEWS&amp;DESCRIPTION=UK%20News Galloway slams own Respect party] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071105232630/http://www.themuslimweekly.com/fullstoryview.aspx?NewsID=215082B330A483E173B045F1&amp;MENUID=HOMENEWS&amp;DESCRIPTION=UK%20News |date=5 November 2007 }}, ''[[The Muslim Weekly]]'', 14 September 2007&lt;/ref&gt; This generated rifts within the SWP itself as two of its members were expelled for refusing to step down as Galloway's parliamentary assistants. By October, SWP publications were claiming that there was a "witch hunt" against socialists within Respect, despite the presence of socialist groups other than the SWP.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=411}} That month, disagreements between Rahman and [[Abjol Miah]], leader of the Respect group in Tower Hamlets, resulted in four of the borough's councillors resigning the Respect Party whip.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=411}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ryan|first=Rosalind|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2007/oct/29/otherparties.localgovernment|title=Respect councillors resign the whip|work=The Guardian|date=29 October 2007|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By November 2007, Respect had split into two rival factions. The first consisted largely of members affiliated with the SWP and included the rebel councillors from Tower Hamlets.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=411}} The second, which named itself [[Respect Renewal]], was led by Galloway and Yaqoob and had the support of virtually all of the party's elected representatives and national council.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=411, 412}} According to political scientist Timothy Peace, these events were "characteristic of the faction fighting that has always plagued the radical left."{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=411–412}} The SWP-allied faction controlled the party's website and claimed that Galloway had simply left the party, of which they were the rightful representatives. The Respect Renewal group changed the locks of the party's national office and barred access to SWP supporters.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=412}} On 17 November, both groups held conferences at which they claimed to be the legitimate manifestation of Respect.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=412}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.isj.org.uk/index.php4?id=396&amp;issue=117|title=The Crisis in Respect|accessdate=15 January 2008|work=[[International Socialism (magazine)|International Socialism]]|year=2008|author=Chris Harman}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Electoral Commission]] subsequently ruled that control of the party's name rested with [[Fire Brigades Union]] activist Linda Smith, the nominating officer; she had sided with Galloway, meaning that the Respect Renewal group were able to continue using the name. The SWP faction split and began using the name [[Left List]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=412}}

This opinion was shared by [[Hilary Wainwright]], who saw a common pattern of "leaderism" in this and other leftist debacles, although she thought Galloway possessed positive qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Wainwright|first=Hilary|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2007/nov/16/anyrespectleft|title=Any Respect left?|quote=And to be honest, although I was impressed by Galloway's oratorical skills, my feminism, my instinctive dislike of leaderism and my aghast observations of the Scargill and then the Sheridan debacles made me wary of an organisation that depended so much on a hero.|work=The Guardian|date=16 November 2007|accessdate=4 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SWP attributed the split to a shift to the right by Galloway and his allies, motivated by electoralism (seeking to gain Muslim votes) and attacks on the left.&lt;ref name="Nunns"&gt;Alex Nunns [http://www.redpepper.org.uk/Car-crash-on-the-left/ "Car crash on the left"], ''Red Pepper'', December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; SWP dominated branches of Respect were reportedly less active than those with far fewer members of that group. A narrow failure of John Rees in 2006 to gain election in the Tower Hamlets local elections, while the 12 candidates from the Bangladeshi community were all elected, was also alleged to have alienated the SWP from the project.&lt;ref name="Nunns"/&gt;

In December 2009, the party de-registered (removed) itself from the Register of Political Parties for Northern Ireland,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/63167/Renamed-or-Deregistered-Parties.pdf|title=Electoral Commission|format=PDF|accessdate=23 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081206030211/http://www.electoralcommission.org.uk/__data/assets/pdf_file/0005/63167/Renamed-or-Deregistered-Parties.pdf|archivedate=6 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but remains registered for England, Scotland and Wales.

===Decline: 2008–2010===

Respect went into gradual decline after 2008.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=406}} By this point its primary unifying issue, anger at Labour over the Iraq War, had become less salient,{{sfn|Clark|2012|p=113}} with the political scientist Stephen Driver suggesting that for this reason Respect "struggled to be anything more than a one-trick pony".{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=160}} The party was in disarray following the schism and only forwarded one candidate for the 2008 London Assembly elections.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=412}} This candidate, [[Hanif Abdulmuhit]], stood for the [[City and East]] constituency and secured 15% of the vote but trailed behind their Labour and [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservative Party]] rivals.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=412}} Overall Respect attained 2.4% of the London Assembly vote, below the 5% threshold needed to secure a seat.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=412}} Galloway had headed the Respect (London-wide) top-up list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ukpollingreport.co.uk/guide/london-list-members/|title=Greater London Authority:Assembly list candidates|publisher=UK polling report|date=2008|accessdate=9 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Respect had not fielded a candidate for London Mayor, instead endorsing Labour's [[Ken Livingstone]], while Left List had fielded German, who secured significantly fewer votes than she had gained as a Respect candidate for Mayor in 2004.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=412}} The outbreak of the [[Gaza War (2008–09)|2008 Gaza War]] provided renewed impetus for Respect's campaigning.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=412}} Throughout much of 2009, the party devoted much of its resources to raising funds for the [[Viva Palestina]] aid convoy to alleviate the humanitarian crisis in the [[Gaza Strip]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=412}} The first convoy, which set off from [[Glasgow]] in February 2009, was led by Respect member [[Kevin Ovenden]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=412}}

[[File:Salma Yaqoob.jpg|thumb|left|At the time of the 2010 general election, Yaqoob was Respect's leader]]

Respect Renewal stood 10 candidates in the local council elections also taking place on 1 May across England and Wales. They returned one new councillor, Nahim Khan, in Birmingham Sparkbrook, who received 42.64% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.respectrenewal.org/content/view/280/1|title=Respect – First thoughts on the elections|publisher=Respectrenewal.org|accessdate=23 April 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120511043831/http://www.respectrenewal.org/content/view/280/1|archivedate=11 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The party did not field any candidates for the 2009 European Parliament elections, instead urging supporters to vote for either the Green Party or the left-wing Eurosceptic alliance, [[No2EU]].{{sfnm|1a1=Driver|1y=2011|1p=160|2a1=Peace|2y=2013a|2p=412}} Instead, [[Arthur Scargill]]'s [[Socialist Labour Party (UK)|Socialist Labour Party]] proved to be the most successful radical left party in the election, securing 1.1% of the national vote.{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=160}}

Respect fielded ten candidates in the 2010 general election,{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=413}} with a particular focus on three that they considered winnable.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=412–413}} The party's manifesto highlighted that a [[hung parliament]] would be likely, and that if there were three Respect MPs in the House of Commons then they would have a chance of forming a coalition with a minority government.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=413}} Their three targeted seats were [[Birmingham Hall Green]], which was being contested by Yaqoob—who was then party leader—[[Poplar and Limehouse]], which was contested by Galloway, and Galloway's existing seat of Bethnal Green and Bow, which was being defended by Miah.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=413}} The election however proved disastrous for Respect.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=414}} Labour secured all three of the seats that Respect had targeted, with Galloway and Miah being pushed into third place with 17% of the vote.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=414}} Nationwide it had secured 33,251 voted, less than half of that which it had attained in the 2005 general election.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=414}} Local elections were held on the same day which also resulted in significant losses for Respect; in Tower Hamlets it went from having eight councillors to one, and in Newham is lost all its councillors.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=414}}

However the party had better results elsewhere. In [[Birmingham Hall Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Birmingham Hall Green]] constituency Respect candidate [[Salma Yaqoob]] performed better, receiving 12,240 votes, 25.1%, placing second after Labour candidate [[Roger Godsiff]], who received 16,039 votes, 32.9%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/election2010/results/constituency/a33.stm|title=Election results Birmingham Hall Green|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Respect fielded eight more candidates in other constituencies, who together polled 4,319 votes. [[Arshad Ali (politician)|Arshad Ali]] received 1,245 votes, 3.1%, in [[Bradford West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford West]], and Kay Phillips received 996 votes, 2.9%, in [[Blackley and Broughton (UK Parliament constituency)|Blackley and Broughton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=the RESPECT party |url=http://www.voterespect.org/ |title=the RESPECT party |publisher=Voterespect.org |date= |accessdate=18 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, Respect candidates received 33,269 votes, which amounted to 6.8% of the total vote in the constituencies where they stood and 0.1% of the total UK vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Searle|first=Clive|title=VOTE RESPECT: After the election – some thoughts and some thanks:|url=http://www.voterespect.org/2010/05/after-election-some-thoughts-and-some.html#more|publisher=Respect|accessdate=14 May 2010}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite news|title=National Results|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/shared/election2010/results/|work=BBC News|accessdate=16 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|2010 General Election]] the Green Party stood down in favour of Respect candidates in Birmingham Sparkbrook and Manchester, Blackley and Broughton indicating the beginning of a tentative co-operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/news/general_election/blackley_and_broughton/s/1202913_kay_phillips_respect|title=Greens back Kay Phillips, Respect|work=Manchester Evening News |date=28 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Galloway told Decca Aitkenhead in April 2012: "When we lost the three parliamentary seats in 2010 that we'd hoped to win, we became almost minuscule"; Respect he said then had about 8-900 members.&lt;ref name="Aitkenhead"/&gt;

Abjol Miah was elected as the National Chair of Respect in January 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eastlondonnews.co.uk/abjol-miah-elected-national-chair-of-respect "Abjol Miah Elected National Chair of Respect"], ''East London News'', 21 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; After the introduction of [[Directly elected mayor of Tower Hamlets|directly elected mayors in Tower Hamlet]]—something that Respect had campaigned for locally—the party backed the successful independent candidate [[Lutfur Rahman (politician)|Luftur Rahman]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=420}}

===2012: Galloway wins Bradford West by-election===
In 2011, Galloway tried to become a [[Member of the Scottish Parliament]] (MSP). On 5 May 2011, in the [[Scottish Parliament general election, 2011]], the Respect Party, on whose list Galloway stood in the [[Glasgow (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Glasgow electoral region]], received 6,972 votes (3.3%).&lt;ref name="BBC Scotland 1"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-13305522|title=Scottish election: Salmond victorious after party's win|date=6 May 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Scotland 2"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/special/election2011/region/html/36139.stm|title=Election 2011 – Scotland – Glasgow|date=8 May 2011|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=3 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He campaigned under the banner of Coalition Against the Cuts, but the vote was insufficient to gain a seat in the Scottish proportional voting system.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=420}} In the Birmingham City Council elections of 2011, Respect lost one of its three councillors to Labour.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=420}} In July, Yaqoob then resigned due to health reasons, leaving the party with only one councillor in the city.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=421}}

Galloway successfully contested [[Bradford West (UK Parliament constituency)|Bradford West]] in a [[Bradford West by-election, 2012|by-election]] held on 29 March, following the resignation of Labour MP [[Marsha Singh]] due to ill health.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-south-yorkshire-17268770 Former MP George Galloway to stand in Bradford West] BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/9561895.Bradford_MP_Marsha_Singh_to_quit/ |title=Bradford MP Marsha Singh to quit|author=Dolores Cowburn |work=Bradford Telegraph &amp; Argus |date= 1 March 2012 |accessdate=1 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amid a fiercely fought campaign, there were claims and complaints of violence and harassment by the Respect Party and its opponents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-17957678|work=BBC News|title=Respect party harassment claim by Bradford East MP David Ward|date=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party came second in [[Oldham]]'s Werneth ward and [[London Borough of Tower Hamlets|Tower Hamlets]]' Weavers ward.

After several months of inconclusive reports in the media,&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Dysch [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/108609/galloway-bid-boris’s-job "Galloway in bid for Boris’s job?"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 13 June 2013&lt;/ref&gt; on 10 August 2013, the Bradford ''[[Telegraph &amp; Argus]]'' reported that Galloway might not be a candidate in Bradford at the [[United Kingdom general election, 2015|2015 general election]] and instead stand in the [[London mayoral election, 2016|2016 London Mayoral election]].&lt;ref name="thetelegraphandargus.co.uk"&gt;Dolores Cowburn [http://www.thetelegraphandargus.co.uk/news/10604560.George_Galloway___I_could_stand_for_Mayor_of_London_/ "George Galloway: 'I could stand for Mayor of London'"], ''Telegraph &amp; Argus'', 10 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt; The five Respect councillors in Bradford elected the previous year resigned from the party whip on 15 August 2013&lt;ref name="BBC1508"&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-23716076 "Bradford councillors resign from Respect party"], BBC News, 15 August 2013&lt;/ref&gt;  after coming into conflict with Galloway over his comments that he might run in the London mayoral election.&lt;ref name="thetelegraphandargus.co.uk"/&gt; They argued that the MP was needed in Bradford.&lt;ref name="BBC1508"/&gt; Two of the councillors had said the MP should resign if he intended to stand in London; Galloway and his associates had immediately suspended them, although their three fellow council members were in agreement.&lt;ref name="Pidd130813"&gt;Helen Pidd [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/aug/13/george-galloway-bradford-west-mayor-london "George Galloway urged to resign as MP if he wants to be London mayor"], ''The Guardian'', 13 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the other three councillors, Alyas Karmani, then leader of the Respect group on Bradford City Council, said the party had not, in fact, been consulted about Galloway's plans.&lt;ref name="Pidd130813"/&gt;

Galloway had also claimed that the councillors were working against him and the party with Aisha Ali Khan, his former aide, and her husband.&lt;ref name="BBC1508"/&gt; (Both Ali Khan and her husband later received criminal convictions related to her former employment by Galloway.)&lt;ref&gt;PA [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/jul/31/george-galloway-ex-secretary-conditional-discharge-data-breaches "George Galloway's ex-secretary gets conditional discharge for data breaches"], theguardian.com, 31 July 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; After no retraction of the assertions made against them had been forthcoming,&lt;ref name="Robinson"&gt;Andrew Robinson [http://www.yorkshirepost.co.uk/news/main-topics/local-stories/no-respect-as-bradford-councillors-quit-galloway-s-party-1-6185353 "No respect as Bradford councillors quit Galloway’s party"], ''Yorkshire Post'', 25 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; the five councillors entirely severed their connections with Respect towards the end of October and then intended to sit as independents for the remainder of their term of office.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-leeds-24667386 "Bradford Respect councillors resign in George Galloway row"], BBC News, 25 October 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Claims that they had been "conniving" with Galloway's former aide were false, they said.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Pidd [https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/oct/25/bradford-respect-party-councillors-resign-george-galloway "Respect councillors in Bradford resign en masse"], theguardian.com, 25 October 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; A spokesman from Respect accused them of attempting to gain control of the party in Bradford.&lt;ref name="Robinson"/&gt;

In the [[United Kingdom local elections, 2014|2014 local elections]], Respect stood eight candidates in Bradford, but none of them won in their council wards.&lt;ref&gt;Helen Pidd [https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/the-northerner/2014/may/23/labour-gains-control-of-bradford-george-galloway-respect-fails "Labour gains control of Bradford as Respect fails"], theguardian.com (blog), 23 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; Two other Respect councillors lost their seats, leaving Respect without any representation on local authorities.&lt;ref name="BBCVote14"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/events/vote2014/england-council-election-results |title=Vote 2014 |date=22 May 2014 |accessdate=5 February 2015 |work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, the party had only 630 members and assets of £1,947.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=137}} By that point, the party was largely a vehicle for Galloway's personality.{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=137}}

===2015–16: general election and de-registration===
At the 2015 general election, Respect had four candidates, in [[Halifax (UK Parliament constituency)|Halifax]] and two Birmingham seats ([[Birmingham Hall Green (UK Parliament constituency)|Hall Green]] and [[Birmingham Yardley (UK Parliament constituency)|Yardley]]) in addition to Bradford West.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.politicsresources.net/area/uk/ge15/cand/other.htm "UK General Election 2015 candidates: Other candidates"], Political Resources.net&lt;/ref&gt; Where Respect was not standing in the election, Galloway had urged a vote for Labour in 2013, having met and been impressed with then Labour leader [[Ed Miliband]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/news/politics/i-want-ed-miliband-to-be-pm-says-labour-outcast-george-galloway-8585723.html|title=I want Ed Miliband to be PM, says Labour outcast George Galloway|work=London Evening Standard|date=24 April 2013|accessdate=11 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  None of the Respect candidates were elected. In George Galloway's own seat, the 10,000 majority he had gained at the 2012 Bradford West by-election was reversed, and the Labour Party candidate [[Naz Shah]] became the constituency's MP with a majority of 11,420 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/politics/constituencies/E14000589 "Election 2015: Bradford West"], BBC News; accessed October 3, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, it became known that former Respect Party leader [[Salma Yaqoob]] had applied to join the Labour Party in Hall Green following [[Jeremy Corbyn]]'s election as leader. Her application was rejected by her local constituency Labour Party owing to her standing against Labour candidates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gilligan|first=Andrew|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/politics/Jeremy_Corbyn/12060187/Labour-moderates-fighting-to-stop-leading-Stop-the-War-activist-joining-the-party.html|title=Labour moderates fighting to stop leading Stop the War activist joining the party|work=The Telegraph|date=19 December 2015|accessdate=31 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Robert Colvile reported in ''[[The Spectator]]'' at the beginning of January 2016:{{quote|Respect barely exists in Bradford — or anywhere else. In 2013, the membership fell to 230 people. Last year &lt;!-- See comment following the citation. --&gt;[2014], that had rebounded to 630 — but beyond their membership fees, Respect raised only £1,133 in donations.

Following his defeat in the 2015 general election, Galloway announced that he would stand as Respect's candidate in the [[London mayoral election, 2016|2016 London Mayoral Election]].{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=135}} During hustings, he praised newly elected Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn,{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=140}} but condemned Labour Mayoral candidate [[Sadiq Khan]] as a "flip-flop merchant" and a "product of the Blairite machine".{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=139}} In the final result of the London Mayoral election held on 5 May 2016, Galloway came seventh with 37,007 (1.4%) first preference votes.

==Support==

===Voter base===

Since its formation, Respect has presented itself as being "genuinely left" and has sought to appeal to leftist voters dissatisfied with the Labour Party's shift to the centre under the leadership of Blair and [[Gordon Brown]].{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=415}} There has however been little electoral support for parties to the left of Labour in Britain, with the party having to seek out an alternative voting base.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=415}}

[[File:East London Mosque and London Muslim Centre - geograph.org.uk - 394907.jpg|thumb|left|The East London Mosque, where Respect helped canvass support for it]]

The primary electoral support for Respect came from the [[Islam in the United Kingdom|British Muslim]] community.{{sfnm|1a1=Driver|1y=2011|1p=159|2a1=Peace|2y=2013a|2p=417|3a1=Ford|3a2=Goodwin|3y=2014|3p=238}} Traditionally, British Muslims voted for the Labour Party, but many had been disenchanted following the Labour government's decision to invade Iraq.{{sfn|Briggs|2007|p=94}} Respect appealed in particular to those British Muslim who had been disenchanted by the war.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=415}} According to Emmanuel Karagiannis, "now that the old working class has assimilated into an expanded middle class, the radical Left is obviously looking for a new constituency, and Europe's deprived and alienated Muslim communities may well be the answer."{{sfn|Karagiannis|2012|p=209}} The political scientist Stephen Driver suggested that this overreliance on dissatisfied Muslim voters left its electoral base "fragile", for when "the source of the protest disappears, so do the protest votes".{{sfn|Driver|2011|p=159}}

At no point did Respect position itself as a specifically Muslim party akin to the [[Islamic Party of Britain]] or the [[People's Justice Party (UK)|Muslim Party in Birmingham]], however from its beginnings it did specifically target Muslims with its campaign material, characterising itself as "the party for Muslims" and focusing on issues of particular concern to British Muslim communities. A local election flyer printed in 2004 featured the slogan "George Galloway – Fighting for Muslim Rights!" It often fielded Muslim candidates to stand in largely Muslim areas, although this was not unusual in British politics, with Labour, the Conservatives, and the Liberal Democrats often doing the same.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=415-17}}

Respect's main electoral support base was in East London and Birmingham. However, there were other areas of Britain with large Islamic communities—such as [[Yorkshire]], [[Lancashire]], and [[Leicester]]—where the party did not do well. Peace suggested that Respect had been successful in East London and Birmingham and not other areas with Muslim communities because these two areas had established anti-war movements and that Respect candidates had already become well known within that movement.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=415-16}}

It has also been suggested that Respect's connection to religious groups and [[mosques]] has been crucial to the party's success in many areas.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=418–419}} It attracted some controversy for allegedly being tied to the [[Islamic Forum of Europe]] (IFE), a group based at the [[East London Mosque]] in Tower Hamlets.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=419}} Both ''[[The Daily Telegraph|The Telegraph]]'' and ''[[Dispatches (TV series)|Dispatches]]'' have alleged that Respect activist Miah is an IFE member, although he has denied this.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=419}}&lt;ref name="Gilligan22102010"&gt;Andrew Gilligan [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewgilligan/100060409/britains-islamic-republic-full-transcript-of-channel-4-dispatches-programme-on-lutfur-rahman-the-ife-and-tower-hamlets-the-full-transcript "'Britain's Islamic republic': full transcript of Channel 4 Dispatches programme on Lutfur Rahman, the IFE and Tower Hamlets"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 22 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Gilligan [http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/andrewgilligan/100111564/ife-becomes-three-time-loser-in-the-complaint-stakes "The Islamic Forum of Europe becomes a three-time loser in the complaint stakes"], ''Daily Telegraph'', 19 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Respect received little attention from scholars of politics.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|pp=405–406}} This may be due to the perception that it was a single-issue party that provided a protest vote among a particular community.{{sfn|Peace|2013a|p=406}}
As with the Greens, Respect were recognised as having radical views but were nonetheless widely regarded as a legitimate part of politics in the UK. In this they contrasted with the pariah status accorded to contemporary far right groups like the [[British National Party]].{{sfn|Ford|Goodwin|2014|p=240}}
In just over two years, it had gained the electoral success that it had taken the BNP twenty years to attain.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=158}}

Respect was controversial within Britain's far left movement. Far left criticisms of the party included that it was engaging in political opportunism, that it invited the [[petty bourgeoisie]] into the socialist workers' movement, and that it focused on the narrow sectarian interests of British Muslims rather than the socio-economic issues of the working-class and in doing so neglected feminism and LGBT rights.{{sfn|Benedek|2007|p=159}}
According to ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist Dave Hill, Respect were "a case study in the British far left's enduring gift for self-parodic, self-destructive splits".{{sfn|Hill|2016|p=137}}

==Criticisms of Respect==

===Equality===
Respect has been accused of abandoning some traditional liberal-social issues, including women's rights, abortion, [[gay rights]] and fighting [[homophobia]] to attract Muslim support.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Gove]], [[Celsius 7/7]] p118, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; While Respect included opposition to discrimination based on gender and sexual orientation in its founding declaration,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.respectcoalition.org/index.php?ite=3|title=The Founding Declaration of Respect – the Unity Coalition|accessdate=23 April 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416002856/http://www.respectcoalition.org/index.php?ite=3|archivedate=16 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; critics claim Galloway has tended to avoid [[British House of Commons|Commons]] votes involving [[civil rights|equal rights]] for gay people – although he did vote to lower the age of consent for gay people in England and Wales to sixteen in 2000, earning him an invitation to open a new Lesbian and Gay centre in Glasgow. He praised New Labour's record on improving gay rights, and says of his absence from one vote that "there was never any doubt about the passage of the [[civil partnerships]] [bill], I wholly support it".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-539.html|title="What was the right answer for the question?"

According to a resolution at that year's conference, Respect's 2005 manifesto omitted the "defence of LGBT rights despite policy adopted at last year's AGM and contained in the founding statement". A resolution was passed calling for the end to all discrimination against lesbians, gay men, bisexuals and [[transgender]] people and that this policy would be stated in all of its manifestos and principal election materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Respect National Conference 2005|url=http://www.respectcoalition.org/?ite=932|website=respectcoalition.org|publisher=Respect|accessdate=4 April 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060217015704/http://www.respectcoalition.org/?ite=932|archivedate=17 February 2006|date=21 November 2005|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this commitment, Respect and parts of the [[LGBT]] community have clashed on several occasions.

In January 2006, an article attacking Tatchell's opposition to the party was written by Respect member and journalist [[Adam Yosef]]. Writing for ''[[Desi Xpress]]'', Yosef accused Tatchell of [[Islamophobia]] but was attacked by gay organisations for "encouraging violence against Tatchell" and for using "xenophobic" and "homophobic" language. Yosef also used other articles to attack [[same-sex union]]s, describing them as a front for "[[tax fraud]]". Tatchell called on Respect to expel Yosef but the party responded with the following statement: "Adam Yosef has the right to voice his own opinions in his own column – they range from an ecstatic review of Birmingham's gay pride to venting his thoughts about Peter Tatchell."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indymedia.org.uk/en/2006/01/331831.html?c=on#c145370|title=Galloway activist urges: assault Tatchell|accessdate=23 April 2007|publisher= |website=Indymedia|date=19 January 2006|author=GW}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in October 2009, Yosef pledged his formal support to Tatchell's [[United Kingdom general election, 2010|General Election]] parliamentary candidacy, calling for the left to "embrace a mutual personal and political commitment towards equality and human rights".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gscene.com/national/Muslim_homophobe_backs_Tatchell_s_bid_to_be_MP.shtml|title=Muslim "homophobe" backs Tatchell's bid to be MP|work=GScene|date=23 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711132438/http://www.gscene.com/national/Muslim_homophobe_backs_Tatchell_s_bid_to_be_MP.shtml|archivedate=11 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://www.dnamagazine.com.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=10594|title=Muslim 'Homophobe' Endorses Activist MP Candidate|work=[[DNA Magazine|DNA]]|date=26 October 2009|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110929163455/http://www.dnamagazine.com.au/articles/news.asp?news_id=10594|archivedate=29 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;br&gt;- {{cite web|url=http://www.gayuknews.com/Politics/muslim-qhomophobeq-backs-gay-rights-activist.html|title=Muslim "homophobe" backs Gay Rights Activist|work=Gay UK News|date=21 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antisemitism===

Abul Hussain, a former member of Respect's national council, posted antisemitic comments on Facebook and was expelled for his comments in September 2010. The councillor joked about chopping off a Jewish person's [[payot|sidelocks]] and confiscating their [[kippah]]. He also wrote about Jews, "Here's a penny go put it in the bank and [you] just might get a pound after ten years interest!". The Respect Party stated that "such views are demonstrably incompatible with party membership".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lipman|first=Jennifer|url=http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/38845/respect-expels-antisemitic-tower-hamlets-candidate-0 |title=Respect expels 'antisemitic' Tower Hamlets candidate|work=The Jewish Chronicle|accessdate=27 October 2012|date=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Hill|first=Dave|url=https://www.theguardian.com/politics/davehillblog/2010/sep/22/lutfur-rahman-tower-hamlets-mayoral-campaign-marred-ineptitude-nastiness|title=Tower Hamlets: ineptitude and nastiness marr Lutfur Rahman campaign|work=The Guardian|date=29 September 2010|accessdate=2 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 Carole Swords, of [[Bow, London|Bow]], the chairwoman of the Respect Party in Tower Hamlets, was convicted for a public order offence after an altercation with a Jewish counter-protester, Harvey Garfield, at a protest inside a Covent Garden Tesco Metro supermarket. She was alleged to have struck him in the face, smacking off his eyeglasses, while he was protecting Israeli goods from potentially being damaged.&lt;ref name="Dysch020212"&gt;Marcus Dysch [http://www.thejc.com/news/uk-news/62974/tower-hamlets-respect-chair-guilty-assault-tesco-demo "Tower Hamlets Respect chair guilty of assault at Tesco demo"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 2 February 2012&lt;/ref&gt; A subsequent appeal in December cleared her of the offence. Swords' defence team claimed Garfield had harassed and intimidated Swords inside the supermarket, and alleging he had called her a “Nazi”, a” fishwife” and a “terrorist”. The recorder determined that Garfield had followed Swords inside the Tesco and that she had demanded he desist.

Following &lt;!-- See citation which follows. --&gt;Naz Kahn's appointment as Respect's women's officer in Bradford in October 2012, it emerged that Kahn had recently commented on Facebook that "history teachers in our school" were and are "the first to start brainwashing us and our children into thinking the bad guy was Hitler.

The Jews haven’t suffered as much as they say they have, but insofar as they have suffered it's their own fault and, in any case, they have gone on to inflict equal or more suffering on others. That's 'the Jews' as a group, not 'many Jews', 'some Jews' or 'a few Jews.'"&lt;ref&gt;David Aaronovitch [http://www.thejc.com/comment-and-debate/columnists/89246/the-everyday-language-hate "The everyday language of hate"], ''The Jewish Chronicle'', 4 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Ron McKay, Galloway's spokesman, said Kahn's comments had been written shortly before she joined Respect, on an "unofficial site" (the Respect Bradford Facebook page), and that she "now deeply regrets and repudiates that posting."&lt;ref name="Lipman12"/&gt;

The last formal leader of Respect, George Galloway, has been accused by ''[[The Guardian]]'' journalist [[Hadley Freeman]] of having "said and done things that cross the line from anti-Israel to antisemitic". He threatened to sue her for the comments made on Twitter in February 2015, although the tweet had already been deleted.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cohen|first1=Benjamin|title=Anti-Zionist British Parliamentarian George Galloway Launches Legal Action Against Journalist's 'Antisemite' Tweet|url=http://www.algemeiner.com/2015/02/12/anti-zionist-british-parliamentarian-george-galloway-launches-legal-action-against-journalists-antisemite-tweet/#|accessdate=1 January 2016|work=The Algemeiner|date=12 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her tweet followed the [[Question Time George Galloway in Finchley controversy|''Question Time'' George Galloway in Finchley controversy]], an edition of the BBC's political debate series on which Freeman's ''Guardian'' colleague [[Jonathan Freedland]] had also appeared and made similar assertions about Galloway's conduct.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;

Galloway's support for [[Hizbollah]] and [[Hamas]], his refusal to debate with Israeli Jews; his endorsement of [[Gilad Atzmon]], and his declaration of Bradford as being an "Israeli-free zone" are among the issues which have led to the attitudes of the politician being thought suspect.&lt;ref name="Cohen"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=British MP George Galloway Declares His City 'Israeli-Free'|url=http://www.israelnationalnews.com/News/News.aspx/183832#.VoaeQJunyM8|accessdate=1 January 2016|work=Israel National News|date=8 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4690">'''Reverse Course''' was a change in [[United States|US]] government and [[Occupation of Japan|Allied Occupation]] policy toward [[Japan]] during the post-[[World War II]] reconstruction. Beginning roughly between 1947 and 1948, it lasted until the end of the occupation in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;John Dower, Embracing defeat: Japan in the wake of World War Two, Penguin Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-7139-9372-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impetus for the Reverse Course divides between global events and developments within Japan. On the one hand, it is linked to the escalation of the [[Cold War]], the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] and the looming [[Korean War]]. On the other hand, due to domestic inflation, the growth of poverty, and the expansion of leftist parties, Japan seemed ripe for communism to both the Japanese government and the leaders of the occupation—especially to the leader of the occupation, [[Douglas MacArthur]]. The Reverse Course resembled Europe’s [[Marshall Plan]].

The occupation had begun with various moves toward democratization, including [[Land reforms by country#Japan|land reform]], the [[Purge (During Occupation of Japan)|purge]] of officials responsible for [[Japanese nationalism|Japan's ultra-nationalism]], and the suppression of both the [[zaibatsu]] and the [[yakuza]]. This extended to Japan's new [[Constitution of Japan|constitution]], which included an [[Article 9 of the Japanese Constitution|article]] that barred the government from maintaining a [[standing army]]. This constitution and related policies had been written by [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt|Rooseveltian]] [[New Deal|New-Dealers]]. The Reverse Course changed such policies in favor of the [[containment policy]].

==Significance for Japanese domestic policy==
As a result of the Reverse Course, public-sector workers lost the right to strike, private-sector unions lost a great deal of bargaining power. Furthermore, severe blows were dealt to ideological freedom, to the zaibatsu-busting process, and to the suppression of the yakuza. It also allowed for the creation of the postwar Japanese armed forces, such as the establishment of the [[National Police Reserve]] (NPR) in 1950 and the Coastal Safety Force (CSF) in 1952. They later became the ground and maritime branches of the [[Japan Self Defense Forces]] (JSDF) in 1954, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title=Legal Restrictions on the Actions of the Japan Air Self Defense Force |last=Okamoto |first=Jun |volume=40 |number=2 |date=2013 |url=http://www.afjag.af.mil/Portals/77/documents/AFD-131017-010.pdf |format=pdf |journal=The Reporter |publisher=[[United States Air Force Judge Advocate General's Corps]] |ref=harv |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170611013327/http://www.afjag.af.mil/Portals/77/documents/AFD-131017-010.pdf |archivedate=11 June 2017 |page=14-15 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; It put conservative politicians back in power, who went on to spearhead the development of [[Liberal Democratic Party (Japan)|Japan's Liberal Democratic Party]].&lt;ref&gt;Yong Wook Lee 
 "The Origin of One Party Domination: America's Reverse Course and the Emergence of the Liberal Democratic Party in Japan" in ''Journal of East Asian Affairs'' XVIII, no. 2 (2004): 371-413 [http://www.watsoninstitute.org/pub_detail.cfm?id=537 link]&lt;/ref&gt; Opposition to the Reverse Course contributed to the protest against the 1960 [[Anpo]] treaty.

==Significance for Japanese foreign policy==
According to [[George F. Kennan]]'s theory, Japan would serve as an industrial engine of East Asia; by extension, a strong Japanese economy would prevent communism from spreading in Asia. A remilitarized and strengthened Japan made Japan the cornerstone of US security policy in East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Comparative politics : interests, identities, and institutions in a changing global order.

'''The Christians Party''' ({{lang-no|Partiet De Kristne}}, PDK)&lt;ref name="Dagen1"/&gt; is a [[Christian right|conservative Christian]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://snl.no/De_Kristne "De Kristne"]. ''Store norske leksikon''. 30.04.2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vg.no/nyheter/innenriks/valg-2013/artikkel.php?artid=10151627 "De Kristne størst av minipartiene"]. ''VG''. 10.09.2013.&lt;/ref&gt; [[List of political parties in Norway|political party in Norway]] founded in 2011. The party leader is Erik Selle.

==History==
Founded as '''The Christians''', the party was formed when the [[Christian Democratic Party (Norway)|Christian Democratic Party]] abolished its requirement that its representatives profess the Christian faith. The party saw this as a major step in the "de-Christianization" of the party, along with a perceived wider de-Christianization of Norway during the years of the [[Red–green coalition (Norway)|Red–Green government]].&lt;ref name="havis"&gt;[http://www.h-avis.no/nyheter/vil-rekristne-landet-1.6140253 "Vil rekristne landet"]. ''Haugesunds Avis''. 30.03.2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The party participated in its first election for the [[Norwegian local elections, 2011|2011 local elections]] limited to the municipal council in [[Bømlo]]. They won 6.5% of the votes there, earning them two seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nrk.no/hordaland/na-vil-de-kristne-innta-stortinget-1.8085303|title=Nå vil De Kristne innta Stortinget|last=Svendsen|first=Roy Hilmar|author2=Svåsand, Maria Pile|date=21 April 2012|publisher=NRK|language=Norwegian|accessdate=14 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bømlo was selected to test support for the new party, with defected local Christian Democratic politicians heading their list. Some saw the party's founding meeting on [[Moster (island)|Moster]] in Bømlo as symbolic, as it was the original starting point of the [[Christianization of Norway]] by King [[Olaf Tryggvason]] a thousand years ago.&lt;ref name="havis"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagen.no/Kristenliv/Kan_f%C3%A5_nytt_kristent_parti_i_dag-55081 "Kan få nytt kristent parti i dag"]. ''Dagen''. 24.02.2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the [[Norwegian parliamentary election, 2013|2013 parliamentary election]] the party gained additional support from philosopher [[Nina Karin Monsen]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagen.no/Samfunn/Fritt_Ord-vinner_stemmer_De_Kristne-57245 "Fritt Ord-vinner stemmer De Kristne"]. ''Dagen''. 03.09.2013.&lt;/ref&gt; veteran Christian Democratic politician [[Anita Apelthun Sæle]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagen.no/Samfunn/KrF-veteran_stemmer_De_Kristne-57336 "KrF-veteran stemmer De Kristne"]. ''Dagen''. 09.09.2013.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Visjon Norge]] televangelist [[Jan Hanvold]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagen.no/Samfunn/Oppfordrer_til_b%C3%B8nn_og_faste_for_De_Kristne-64767 "Oppfordrer til bønn og faste for De Kristne"]. ''Dagen''. 28.08.2013.&lt;/ref&gt; It received 0.6% of the national vote (17,731 votes), winning no seats but becoming second largest of the extra-parliamentary parties.&lt;ref name=2013results&gt;{{cite web|title=Valgresultat &gt; Partier &gt; De Kristne|url=http://valg.nrk.no/valg2013/valgresultat/partier/de-kristne|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130913012001/http://valg.nrk.no/valg2013/valgresultat/partier/de-kristne|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2013-09-13|work=[[NRK|Norsk rikskringkasting AS]]|accessdate=11 September 2013|language=Norwegian|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the [[Norwegian local elections, 2015|2015 local elections]] the Christians drew numerous local politicians from the Christian Democrats as well as the [[Progress Party (Norway)|Progress Party]], and the party had a large number of new local chapters established.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nettavisen.no/politikk/--det-er-fortsatt-noen-kristne-igjen-her-i-landet/8535293.html "- Det er fortsatt noen kristne igjen her i landet"]. ''Nettavisen''. 28.01.15.&lt;/ref&gt; The party managed to secure lists for the elections in 70 municipalities, as well as all the counties of Norway. Among the speakers at the party's national congress in May was the [[Israel]]i [[Greek Orthodox Church|Greek Orthodox]] priest [[Gabriel Naddaf]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dagen.no/Nyheter/landsm%C3%B8te/Gir-aldri-opp-partiets-sjel-198178 "Gir aldri opp partiets sjel"]. ''Dagen''. 08.05.2015.&lt;/ref&gt; The party won three municipal representatives in the election, one each in Bømlo, [[Vennesla]] and [[Karmøy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vl.no/nyhet/start-smell-for-de-kristne-1.396219 "Start-smell for De Kristne"]. ''Vårt Land''. 15.09.2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The party considers its ideology to be built on Christian and "[[Judeo-Christian]]" values.&lt;ref name="Dagen1"/&gt; It profiles itself as [[pro-life]], promotes the traditional family and opposition to [[same-sex marriage]], maintains strong support for Israel, and supports [[economic liberalism]].&lt;ref name="Dagen0913"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dekristne.no/hjertesaker.php "Våre hjertesaker"]. ''Partiet De Kristne''.&lt;/ref&gt; The party claims to follow the line of former Christian Democrat leader [[Kåre Kristiansen]].&lt;ref name="nettav"&gt;[http://www.nettavisen.no/3601450.html "- Vi skal i regjering på første forsøk"]. ''Nettavisen''. 05.04.13.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the Christian Democrats the party supports cooperation with the Progress Party, and has stated that it aims for participation in a coalition government together with the Progress and [[Conservative Party (Norway)|Conservative Party]].&lt;ref name="nettav"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aftenbladet.no/nyheter/politikk/De-Kristne-haper-pa-KrF-avhoppere-3167462.html#.U3zgtnbm6bU "De Kristne håper på KrF-avhoppere"].

'''''They Live''''' is a 1988 American [[science fiction film|science fiction]] [[horror film]] written and directed by [[John Carpenter]]. The film stars [[Roddy Piper]], [[Keith David]], and [[Meg Foster]]. It follows an unnamed drifter (referred to as "John Nada" in the film's credits) who discovers that the ruling class are aliens concealing their appearance and manipulating people to spend money, breed, and accept the status quo with subliminal messages in mass media. It is based on the 1963 short story "Eight O'Clock in the Morning" by [[Ray Nelson]].

At release it was number one for a short time at the box office. It was nominated for two [[Saturn Award]]s and became a [[cult film]]. It had a lasting impact on [[street art]], particularly that of [[Shepard Fairey]]; its quotations have entered the popular culture, and its near six-minute alley brawl between the protagonists makes appearances on all-time lists for best fight scenes.

==Plot==
Drifter "John Nada" finds construction work in Los Angeles and befriends fellow construction worker Frank Armitage, who leads him to a [[shanty town]] soup kitchen. A disruptive television signal and a preacher both warn of conspiracies, and Nada discovers a nearby church is a front for scientific equipment. After the church is raided and the shantytown bulldozed, Nada retrieves a box of sunglasses from the church's wall, wearing one pair and hiding the rest in an alley dumpster. The sunglasses reveal a hidden reality: media and advertising hide omnipresent [[subliminal stimuli]] to obey, consume, reproduce, and conform, while many of the elite are actually grotesque aliens.

When Nada confronts an alien woman, she alerts others via a wristwatch communicator. Two alien police confront Nada, but he kills them and goes on a shooting spree with their guns, killing aliens in a nearby bank while one uses its wristwatch to vanish; Nada spares a human police officer. Nada escapes, taking Cable 54 assistant director Holly Thompson hostage. She rejects his claims and knocks him through the window of her luxurious hill-top home before calling the police; Nada escapes, but loses his sunglasses in the fall.

Now a fugitive, Nada returns to the alley and retrieves the box of sunglasses from a garbage truck. Frank meets Nada to give him his paycheck. Frank also disbelieves Nada, but Nada forces a pair of sunglasses onto his face after an extended street fight. Accepting what he has now seen, Frank goes into hiding with Nada. They learn of a secret meeting for anti-alien activists, where they are given contact lenses to replace the sunglasses. The aliens control Earth as they have other planets in the past; they deplete each planet's resources and destroy its environment before moving on to others. If the source of the aliens' broadcast signal can be destroyed, all of humanity will see the hidden reality. Holly arrives to join the cause, apologizing to Nada. The meeting is raided by police, who kill several anti-alien activists; Nada and Frank use a stolen alien wristwatch to escape through a portal, entering the aliens' secret command center.

Nada and Frank discover a banquet celebration of aliens and human collaborators, one of whom gives them a tour of the facility, assuming they are also collaborators. Nada and Frank exit into the basement of Cable 54, the source of the signal. They fight their way through the building to the roof where the alien transmitter is disguised as a satellite dish. They encounter Holly, who joins them but then murders Frank; she is a collaborator. Nada kills Holly and destroys the transmitter, but is fatally wounded by aliens in a helicopter. With the signal destroyed, humans all over the world discover the aliens in their midst.

==Production==
===Development===
The idea for ''They Live'' came from a short story called "Eight O'Clock in the Morning" by [[Ray Nelson]], originally published in ''[[The Magazine of Fantasy &amp; Science Fiction]]'' in November 1963, involving an alien invasion in the tradition of ''[[Invasion of the Body Snatchers]]'', which Nelson, along with artist [[William Wray (artist)|Bill Wray]], adapted into a story called "Nada", published in the ''[[Alien Encounters]]'' [[comics anthology]] in April 1986.&lt;ref name="Swires, Steve"&gt;{{cite news | last = Swires | first = Steve| title = John Carpenter and the Invasion of the Yuppie Snatchers | work = [[Starlog]] | pages = 37–40; 43| date = November 1988 }}&lt;/ref&gt; John Carpenter describes Nelson's story as "...&amp;nbsp;a ''[[D.O.A. (1949 film)|D.O.A.]]''-type of story, in which a man is put in a trance by a stage [[Hypnosis|hypnotist]]. When he awakens, he realizes that the entire human race has been hypnotized, and that alien creatures are controlling humanity. He has only until eight o'clock in the morning to solve the problem."&lt;ref name="Swires, Steve"/&gt; Carpenter acquired the film rights to both the comic book and short story and wrote the screenplay, using Nelson's story as a basis for the film's structure.

The more political elements of the film are derived from Carpenter's growing distaste with the ever-increasing commercialization of 1980s popular culture and politics, particularly the influence of [[Reaganomics]], the economic policies promoted by U.S. President [[Ronald Reagan]].&lt;ref name="clark"&gt;{{cite web|last=Clark |first=Noelene |date=May 11, 2013 |url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/movies/john-carpenter-they-live-was-about-giving-the-finger-to-reagan/#/0 |title=John Carpenter: ‘They Live’ was about 'giving the finger to Reagan'|work=Hero Complex |publisher=[[Tribune Publishing]]|accessdate=August 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remarked, "I began watching TV again. I quickly realized that everything we see is designed to sell us something... It's all about wanting us to buy something. The only thing they want to do is take our money." To this end, Carpenter thought of sunglasses as being the tool to seeing the truth, which "is seen in black and white. It's as if the aliens have colorized us. That means, of course, that [[Ted Turner]] is really a monster from outer space." (Turner had received some bad press in the 1980s for [[Film colorization|colorizing classic black-and-white movies]].) The director commented on the alien threat in an interview: "They want to own all our businesses. A [[Universal Pictures|Universal]] executive asked me, 'Where's the threat in that? We all sell out every day.' I ended up using that line in the film." The aliens were deliberately made to look like ghouls, according to Carpenter, who said, "The creatures are corrupting us, so they, themselves, are corruptions of human beings."&lt;ref name="Swires, Steve"/&gt;

Because the screenplay was the product of so many sources—a short story, a comic book, and input from cast and crew—Carpenter decided to use the pseudonym "Frank Armitage", an allusion to one of the filmmaker's favorite writers, [[H. P. Lovecraft]] (Henry Armitage is a character in Lovecraft's ''[[The Dunwich Horror]]'').&lt;ref name="Swires, Steve"/&gt; Carpenter has always felt a close kinship with Lovecraft's worldview and according to the director, "Lovecraft wrote about the hidden world, the 'world underneath'. His stories were about gods who are repressed, who were once on Earth and are now coming back. The world underneath has a great deal to do with ''They Live''."&lt;ref name="Swires, Steve"/&gt;

===Casting===
For the crucial role of Nada the filmmaker cast professional wrestler Roddy Piper, whom he met at [[WrestleMania III]] earlier in 1987. For Carpenter it was an easy choice: "Unlike most Hollywood actors, Roddy has life written all over him."&lt;ref name="Swires, Steve"/&gt; Carpenter was impressed with Keith David's performance in ''[[The Thing (1982 film)|The Thing]]'' and needed someone "who wouldn't be a traditional sidekick, but could hold his own."&lt;ref name="Swires, Steve"/&gt; To this end, Carpenter wrote the role of Frank specifically for Keith David.

===Filming===
''They Live'' was shot in eight weeks during March and April 1988, principally on location in downtown L.A., with a budget only slightly greater than $3 million.&lt;ref name="Swires, Steve"/&gt; One of the highlights of the film is a five-and-a-half minute alley fight between David and Piper over a pair of the special sunglasses. Carpenter recalls that the fight took three weeks to rehearse: "It was an incredibly brutal and funny fight, along the lines of the slugfest between [[John Wayne]] and [[Victor McLaglen]] in ''[[The Quiet Man]]''."&lt;ref name="Swires, Steve"/&gt;

==Release==
The film opened on November 4, 1988, and debuted at #1 at the North American box office grossing $4.8 million during its opening weekend.&lt;ref name=mojo/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boxoffice"&gt;{{Cite news |title='They Live' tops the weekend's box office |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8uYpAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7WQFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4148,1705630&amp;dq=john+carpenter+they+live+number+1+box+office&amp;hl=en |author=[[Associated Press]]|magazine=[[Sun Journal (Lewiston, Maine)|Sun Journal]] |date=November 9, 1988|accessdate=July 3, 2018|via=[[Google News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film  spent  two weeks in the top ten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekly&amp;id=theylive.htm |work=[[Box Office Mojo]]|title=They Live: Weekly|accessdate=July 3, 2018|publisher=[[IMDb]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film had a total domestic gross of $13,008,928.&lt;ref name=mojo/&gt; Carpenter is on record as attributing the film's initial commercial failure to the hypothesis that those "who go to the movies in vast numbers these days don't want to be enlightened".&lt;ref name="Swires, Steve"/&gt; The film's original release date, advertised in promotional material as October 21, 1988, was pushed back two weeks to avoid direct competition with ''[[Halloween 4: The Return of Michael Myers]]''.

==Reception==
[[Rotten Tomatoes]] gave the film an approval rating of 85% based on 59 reviews; the average rating is 7.2/10. The website's critical consensus reads: "A politically subversive blend of horror and sci fi, ''They Live'' is an underrated genre film from John Carpenter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/they_live/|title=They Live (1988)|publisher=[[Fandango Media]]|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=July 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]] gave the film a weighted average rating of 52 out of 100, based on 10 reviews, indicating "mixed or average reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/they-live |title=They Live Reviews |work=[[Metacritic]]|publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]|accessdate=September 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his review for the ''[[Chicago Reader]]'', [[Jonathan Rosenbaum]] wrote, "Carpenter's wit and storytelling craft make this fun and watchable, although the script takes a number of unfortunate shortcuts, and the possibilities inherent in the movie's central conceit are explored only cursorily."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Rosenbaum | first=Jonathan | title=They Live | url=https://www.chicagoreader.com/chicago/they-live/Film?oid=2035158 | work=[[Chicago Reader]] | accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jay Carr, writing for ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', said "[O]nce Carpenter delivers his throwback-to-the-'50s visuals, complete with plump little [[B movie|B-movie]] flying saucers, and makes his point that the rich are fascist fiends, ''They Live'' starts running low on imagination and inventiveness", but felt that "as sci-fi horror comedy, ''They Live'', with its wake-up call to the world, is in a class with ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'' and ''[[RoboCop]]'', even though its hero doesn't sport bionic biceps".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Carr | first=Jay | title=What if we're cattle for aliens? |publisher=Boston Globe Media Partners |url=https://secure.pqarchiver.com/boston/doc/294477240.html?FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Nov+4,+1988&amp;author=Carr,+Jay&amp;pub=Boston+Globe+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=&amp;desc=WHAT+IF+WE'RE+CATTLE+FOR+ALIENS? |accessdate=July 3, 2018 | work=[[The Boston Globe]] | date=November 4, 1988 |archiveurl=https://archive.li/DNUQe |archivedate=February 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[AllMovie]] contributor Paul Brenner gave the film three and a half out of five stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last=Brenner | first=Paul | title=They Live | url=http://www.allmovie.com/work/they-live-49415 | work=[[AllMovie]] |publisher=[[RhythmOne]] | accessdate=December 13, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In her review for ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Janet Maslin]] wrote, "Since Mr. Carpenter seems to be trying to make a real point here, the flatness of ''They Live'' is doubly disappointing. So is its crazy inconsistency, since the film stops trying to abide even by its own game plan after a while."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Maslin | first=Janet | title=A Pair of Sunglasses Reveals a World of Evil | url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/11/04/movies/review-film-a-pair-of-sunglasses-reveals-a-world-of-evil.html | work=[[The New York Times]] |publisher=The New York Times Company | date=November 4, 1988 | accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Harrington wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', "it's just John Carpenter as usual, trying to dig deep with a toy shovel. The plot for ''They Live'' is full of black holes, the acting is wretched, the effects are second-rate. In fact, the whole thing is so preposterous it makes ''[[V (1984 TV series)|V]]'' look like ''Masterpiece Theatre''."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Harrington | first=Richard | title='They Live': (R) | work=[[The Washington Post]] | url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/theylive.htm |publisher=The Washington Post Company | date=November 5, 1988 | accessdate=May 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rick Groen, in ''[[The Globe and Mail]]'', wrote, "the movie never gets beyond the pop Orwell premise. The social commentary wipes clean with a dry towelette – it's not intrusive and not pedantic, just lighter-than-air."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Groen | first=Rick | title=''They Live'' | work=[[The Globe and Mail]] | date=November 5, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2012 documentary film ''[[The Pervert's Guide to Ideology]]'' presented by Slovene philosopher and psychoanalyst [[Slavoj Žižek]] starts with an analysis of the film ''They Live'': Žižek uses the main trope of the film, the wearing of the special sun-glasses reveals the truth of that which is perceived, to explain his definition of [[ideology]]. Žižek states:

{{quote|''They Live'' is definitely one of the forgotten masterpieces of the [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] [[Left-wing politics|Left]]. … The sunglasses function like a critique of ideology. They allow you to see the real message beneath all the propaganda, glitz, posters and so on. … When you put the sunglasses on you see the dictatorship in democracy, the invisible order which sustains your apparent freedom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=''THE PERVERT'S GUIDE TO IDEOLOGY'' (15) |url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/perverts-guide-ideology |publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]] |date=June 19, 2013 |accessdate=June 19, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005043700/http://www.bbfc.co.uk/releases/perverts-guide-ideology |archivedate=October 5, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; }}

Carpenter has rejected neo-Nazi claims that the film "is an allegory for Jewish control of the world," instead noting the film "is about yuppies and unrestrained capitalism".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Adam |last=White |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/films/2017/01/05/john-carpenter-condemns-neo-nazis-have-co-opted-cult-1988-satire/ |title=John Carpenter condemns neo-Nazis who have co-opted his cult 1988 satire They Live |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |work=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |date=January 4, 2017 |accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Brian |last=Raftery |url=https://www.wired.com/2017/01/they-live-theory-debunked/ |title=Bigots Are Trying to Ruin the Movie They Live, Because of Course They Are |publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=January 4, 2017 |accessdate=January 8, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legacy===
The film was ranked #18 on ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' magazine's "The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since '83" list.&lt;ref name="EWCult"&gt;{{cite news | title=The Cult 25: The Essential Left-Field Movie Hits Since '83 | work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] | url=http://www.ew.com/gallery/cult-25-essential-left-field-movie-hits-83 | accessdate=August 16, 2016 |publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date=August 27, 2008 |author=EW Staff}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"''They Live'' was…the basis for my use of the word 'obey'," Fairey said. "The movie has a very strong message about the power of commercialism and the way that people are manipulated by advertising."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.slashfilm.com/cool-stuff-shepard-faireys-they-live-mondo-poster |title=Cool Stuff: Shepard Fairey’s ‘They Live’ Mondo Poster |work=[[/Film]] |date=June 9, 2011 |accessdate=March 8, 2013 |first=Germain |last=Lussier}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jonathan Lethem]] called ''They Live'' one of his "favorite movies of the eighties, hands down". He said, "It's a great movie...Look at what it does to people, look at how it emboldens and provokes...It's disturbing and ridiculous and outrageous and uncomfortable, but I think it's the kind of great movie that doesn't really need defense, it just needs to be given the air." Lethem wrote a book-length homage to the movie for the [[Soft Skull Press]] ''Deep Focus'' series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kachka |first=Boris |url=http://www.vulture.com/2010/10/jonathan_lethem_says_tk.html |title=Jonathan Lethem on John Carpenter’s They Live and His Own Move to California |publisher=[[New York (magazine)|New York Media]] |work=Vulture |accessdate=July 29, 2012|date=October 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rock band [[Green Day]] paid homage to ''They Live'' in their music video for "Back in the USA", off of their album ''[[Greatest Hits: God's Favorite Band]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/see-green-days-they-live-inspired-back-in-the-usa-video-w512075|title=See Green Day's 'They Live'-Inspired 'Back in the USA' Video|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|access-date=December 13, 2017|first=Daniel|last=Kreps|date=November 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2018, it was selected to be screened in the Venice Classics section at the [[75th Venice International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.labiennale.org/en/news/restored-films-venezia-classici |title=Biennale Cinema 2018, Venice Classics |work=labiennale.org |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remake===
In Fall 2010, there was development on a remake of Carpenter's 1988 film ''They Live'', with him in a producer role. In 2011, [[Matt Reeves]] signed on to direct and write the screenplay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Sean |last=O'Neal|url=https://news.avclub.com/they-live-remake-is-no-longer-technically-a-remake-1798225017|title='They Live' Remake is No Longer Technically a Remake|work=[[The A.V.

The '''UK Border Agency''' ('''UKBA''') was the [[border control]] agency of the [[Government of the United Kingdom]] and part of the [[Home Office]] that was superseded by [[UK Visas and Immigration]], [[UK Border Force]] and [[Immigration Enforcement]] in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-border-agency |title=UK Border Agency |year=2013 |publisher=GOV.UK |accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was formed as an [[executive agency]] on 1 April 2008 by a merger of the [[Border and Immigration Agency]] (BIA), [[UKvisas]] and the Detection functions of [[Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs|HM Revenue and Customs]]. The decision to create a single border control organisation was taken following a [[Cabinet Office]] report.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/border_review.aspx Security in a global hub – Establishing the UK’s new border arrangements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080906193105/http://www.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/border_review.aspx |date=6 September 2008 }}". Cabinet Office. Last updated 16 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency's head office was 2 Marsham Street, London. [[Rob Whiteman]] became Chief Executive in September 2011. Over 23,000 staff worked for the agency, in over 130 countries. It was divided into four main operations, each under the management of a senior director: operations, immigration and settlement, international operations and [[Visa (document)|visas]] and law enforcement.&lt;ref name="Org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/aboutus/organisation/ |title=Our organisation |year=2013 |publisher=UK Border Agency |accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The agency came under formal criticism from the [[Parliamentary and Health Service Ombudsman|Parliamentary Ombudsman]] for consistently poor service, a backlog of hundreds of thousands of cases, and a large and increasing number of complaints.&lt;ref name="faf"&gt;[http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/__data/assets/tpdf_file/0016/673/UKBA-2010-02-09.pdf Fast and Fair?]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }} – report on UK Border Agency by the Parliamentary Ombudsman, published 9 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt; In the first nine months of 2009–10, 97% of investigations reported by the Ombudsman resulted in a complaint against the agency being upheld.&lt;ref name="omb"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/2010/pr2010-03 |title=Press release: Ombudsman publishes report on UK Border Agency |publisher=Ombudsman.org.uk |accessdate=12 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120403030127/http://www.ombudsman.org.uk/about-us/media-centre/press-releases/2010/pr2010-03 |archivedate=3 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The complainants were asylum, residence, or other immigration applicants.&lt;ref name="omb"/&gt;

On 26 March 2013, following a scathing report into the agency's incompetence by the Home Affairs Select Committee,&lt;ref name="HomeAffairsCommitteeReport"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm201213/cmselect/cmhaff/792/79207.htm|title=The work of the UK Border Agency (July-September 2012) - Conclusions and recommendations|publisher=UK Parliament|date=19 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was announced by [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] that the UK Border Agency would be abolished and its work returned to the Home Office.

Ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk (2013-04-01). Retrieved on 2013-10-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to this in April 2012, the border control division of the UKBA was separated from the rest of the agency as the [[Border Force]].

== Role ==
{{Further|Illegal immigration to the United Kingdom}}
The agency attained full agency status on 1 April 2009. Immigration Officers and Customs Officers retained their own powers for the enforcement and administration of the UK's borders, although management of the new organisation was integrated and progressively officers were cross trained and empowered to deal with customs and immigration matters at the border. The [[Borders, Citizenship and Immigration Act 2009]] received [[Royal Assent]] on 21 July 2009. This allowed the concurrent exercise of customs powers by HMRC Commissioners and the Director of Border Revenue; it was the first step in overhauling immigration and customs legislation.

[[File:UKBA officer.jpg|left|thumb|A UK Border Agency officer examines counterfeit football shirts upon their arrival in the United Kingdom]]
The UK Border Agency had a staff of 23,500 people located in over 130 countries. Overseas staff vetted visa applications and operated an intelligence and liaison network, acting as the first layer of border control for the UK. The organisation operated as the single force at the border for the UK. Local immigration teams worked within the regions of the United Kingdom, liaising with the police, HMRC, local authorities and the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/aboutus/your-region/ |title=Our work in your region |year=2013 |publisher=UK Border Agency |accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2009 HM Revenue and Customs transferred several thousand customs detection officers to the agency, following Parliament agreeing to give it customs control powers. The agency then began to investigate smuggling. The agency was developing a single primary border control line at the UK border combining controls of people and goods entering the country.

The agency's [[E-borders]] programme checked travellers to and from the UK in advance of travel, using data provided by passengers via their airline or ferry operators. The organisation used automatic clearance gates at main international airports.

The agency managed the UK Government's limit on non-European economic migration to the UK. It was responsible for in-country enforcement operations, investigating organised immigration crime and to detecting immigration offenders including illegal entrants and overstayers. The body was also responsible for the deportation of foreign national criminals at the end of sentences.

The UK Border Agency's budget combined with that of the Border Force was £2.17 billion in 2011-12. Under the spending review the agency was required to cut costs by up to 23%.&lt;ref name="Business plan"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/uk-border-agency-business-plan/business-plan/ukba-business-plan?view=Binary |title=UK Border Agency Business Plan |year=2011 |publisher=UK Border Agency |accessdate=27 March 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130604184259/http://ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/documents/aboutus/uk-border-agency-business-plan/business-plan/ukba-business-plan?view=Binary |archive-date=4 June 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At its peak the agency employed around 25,000 staff, but 5,000 posts were due to be cut by 2015 against the 2011-12 levels.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/hc1213/hc04/0467/0467.pdf |archive-url=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20121105152725/http://www.official%2Ddocuments.gov.uk/document/hc1213/hc04/0467/0467.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=5 November 2012 |title=The UK Border Agency and Border Force: Progress in cutting costs and improving performance |date=17 July 2012 |publisher=National Audit Office |accessdate=27 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Founding Chief Executive Lin Homer left the agency in January 2011 to become the Permanent Secretary at the [[Department for Transport]]. Deputy Chief Executive Jonathan Sedgwick was acting chief until the new CEO, Rob Whiteman, took over on 26 September 2011. Sedgwick then became director of international operations and visas.&lt;ref name="Org"/&gt; In July 2011, the strategic policy functions of the agency moved to the Home Office.

Home Secretary Theresa May announced to Parliament on 26 March 2013 that the agency would be abolished due to continuing poor performance, and replaced by two new smaller organisations which would focus on the visa system and immigration law enforcement respectively. The UKBA's performance was described as "not good enough", partly blamed on the size of the organisation. A report by MPs also criticised the agency, and described it as "not fit for purpose". It was also claimed that the agency had provided inaccurate reports to the [[Home Affairs Select Committee]] over a number of years.&lt;ref name=Abolition/&gt; The agency was split internally on 1 April 2013, becoming a visa and immigration service and separate immigration law enforcement service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsarticles/2013/may/11-transition |title=UK Border Agency's transition to Home Office |date=3 May 2013 |publisher=UK Border Agency |accessdate=12 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130616175953/http://www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk/sitecontent/newsarticles/2013/may/11-transition |archivedate=16 June 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Staff held a mixture of powers granted to them by their status as immigration officers and customs officers.

=== Immigration powers ===
{{Main|Immigration officer#United Kingdom|l1=Immigration officer}}
Immigration officers had the power of arrest and detention conferred on them by the [[Immigration Act 1971]], when both at ports and inland. In practice, border force officers exercised powers under Schedule 2 of the Immigration Act 1971 and inland immigration officers under S28A-H of the Immigration Act 1971 and paragraph 17 of Schedule 2.  This led to separate training for border and inland officers.

This act is applicable in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. "Designated Immigration Officers" are port immigration officers who have been trained in detention under PACE. UK Border Agency immigration officers wear a uniform with rank insignia. Enforcement immigration officers wear [[stab vest|body armour]] and carry [[handcuffs]] and [[Club (law enforcement)|ASP batons]].
[[File:UK Border Agency office Sheffield.png|thumb|right|Offices of the UK Border Agency in [[Sheffield]]]]

=== Customs powers ===
{{Main|Customs officer#United Kingdom|l1=Customs officer}}
Customs officers had wide-ranging powers of entry, search and detention. The main power was to detain anyone who had committed, or who the officer had reasonable grounds to suspect had committed, any offence under the Customs and Excise Acts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.opsi.gov.uk/RevisedStatutes/Acts/ukpga/1979/cukpga_19790002_en_21#pt14-pb1-l1g177 |title=Section 138, Customs and Excise Management Act 1979 (c. 2) |publisher=Office of Public Sector Information |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Removal of foreign nationals ===
The UK Border Agency occasionally removed foreign national criminals at the end of their prison terms. Over 5000 foreign national prisoners were deported each year. The agency also removed failed asylum seekers and others illegally in the UK. A 2009 report by the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] cited lack of detention space to support the asylum process. The agency had over 3000 detention spaces in removal centres run by private contractors or the [[Prison Service]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nao.org.uk/publications/0809/management_of_asylum_appl.aspx |title=Audit Office report |publisher=National Audit Office |date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immigration control ==
[[File:UK Border, Heathrow.jpg|thumb|right|UKBA officers staff the UK border at [[London Heathrow Airport]]'s [[London Heathrow Terminal 5|Terminal 5]]]]

===Common travel area===
Immigration control within the United Kingdom is managed within a wider [[Common Travel Area]] (CTA). The CTA is an intergovernmental agreement that allows freedom of movement within an area that encompasses the UK, Isle of Man, Channel Islands (Guernsey, Jersey, Sark and Alderney) and the Republic of Ireland. Authorised entry to any of the above essentially allows entry to all the others but it is the responsibility of the person entering to ensure that they are properly documented for entry to other parts of the CTA. Despite the CTA it is still possible to be deported from the UK to the Republic of Ireland and vice versa.

===Juxtaposed controls===
Entry to the UK via the [[Channel Tunnel]] from France or Belgium or by ferry through selected ports in north-east France is controlled by [[Juxtaposed controls|juxtaposed immigration controls]] in Britain, France, and [[Belgium]], i.e. travellers clear UK passport control in France or Belgium and those travelling to France or Belgium clear French controls while in the UK. Belgium does not maintain controls in the UK as the first Schengen country entered is France. UK Border Agency checkpoints in France are operated at [[Gare de Calais-Fréthun]], [[Gare de Lille Europe]], Marne la vallée Chessy TGV, Gare d'Avignon centre, Channel Tunnel, [[Calais]] ferry terminal, [[Dunkirk]] ferry terminal and [[Gare du Nord]] station, Paris. A checkpoint operated at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer]] until the port closed in August 2010.  [[United States border preclearance]] is an equivalent system operated by that country's [[USCBP|equivalent to the UKBA]] at some airports outside the US.

== Controversies ==

===Student visas===
There have also been difficulties with the management of student visas under Tier 4 of the Points-Based System. The assessment of the [[Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration|Independent Chief Inspector]], carried out between July and August 2010, found that there was an inconsistent response towards applications, with some cases given extra time to prepare and others dismissed for minor reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2011/02/16/ukborderagency_report_fails/ |title=UK Border Agency: Good at making cash, crap at making decisions |author=John Oates |date=16 February 2011 |publisher=The Register |accessdate=25 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dropped casework===
In November 2011, the Home Affairs Select Committee issued a report that found that 124,000 deportation cases had been shelved by the UKBA. The report said the cases had been dumped in a "controlled archive", a term used to try to hide the fact from authorities and auditors that it was a list of lost applicants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Casciani |first=Dominic |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15581877 |title=BBC News – UK Border Agency attacked for 'dumping' missing cases |publisher=BBC |date=4 November 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Border checks===
Following allegations that staff were told to relax some identity checks, in November 2011 the UK Home Office suspended: [[Brodie Clark]], the Head of the [[Border Force]];&lt;ref name=BBC15601988/&gt; Carole Upshall, director of the Border Force South and European Operation;&lt;ref name=DMail2057784/&gt; Graham Kyle, director of operations at Heathrow Airport.&lt;ref name=BBC15601988/&gt; The Home Office is presently investigating allegations that Clark had agreed to "open up the borders" at certain times in ways ministers would "not have agreed with".&lt;ref name=BBC15601988/&gt; It is alleged that between July and the end of October 2011, queues at passport control were "managed" so as not to annoy holiday makers.&lt;ref name=DMail2057784&gt;{{cite news|author=James Slack |url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2057784/UK-border-chief-axed-passport-controls-Top-civil-servant-faces-sack-decision-left-Britain-open-terrorists-criminals.html#ixzz1cmliZq21 |title=UK border chief axed passport controls: Top civil servant faces sack over decision that left Britain open to terrorists and criminals &amp;#124; Mail Online |work=Daily Mail  |date=5 November 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BBC]] reported that staff may have been told not to scan [[biometric passport]]s at certain times, which contain a digital image of the holder's face, which can be used to compare with the printed version and check the passport has not been forged.&lt;ref name=BBC15601988/&gt; It is also believed that "warning index checks" at Heathrow and Calais were also suspended, which would have applied strict security checks against official watchlists of terrorists, criminals, and deported illegal immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Alan Travis, home affairs editor |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2011/nov/05/head-of-uk-border-force-suspended |title=Head of UK border force suspended &amp;#124; UK news |work=The Guardian  |accessdate=12 April 2012 |location=London |date=5 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Clark refused the offer to take early retirement, he was suspended and the investigation began.&lt;ref name=BBC15601988&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15601988 |title=BBC News – Head of UK border force Brodie Clark suspended |publisher=BBC |date=5 November 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A two-week inquiry led by former Metropolitan Police detective Dave Wood, currently head of the agency's enforcement and crime group, sought to discover to what extent checks were scaled down, and what the security implications might have been. A second investigation, led by former [[MI6]] official Mike Anderson, the Director General of the Home Office's strategy, immigration and international group, sought to investigate wider issues relating to the performance of UKBA regarding racism.

It was then announced on 5 November by Theresa May that an independent inquiry would also be undertaken, led by the [[Independent Chief Inspector of Borders and Immigration|Chief Inspector of the UK Border Agency]], John Vine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Chris Mason |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-15608238 |title=BBC News – Inquiry into border force passport check claims |publisher=BBC |date=5 November 2011 |accessdate=12 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Border Force became a separate organisation on 1 March 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Theresa May to split up UK Border Agency |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-17099143 |newspaper=BBC News |date=20 February 2012 |accessdate=27 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2014 Sham Weddings Trial Collapse===
In October 2014, the trial of the Reverend Nathan Ntege - accused of conducting almost 500 sham marriages at a church in Thornton Heath, South London between 2007 and 2011 - collapsed after it became apparent that evidence had been tampered with, concealed, or even possibly destroyed. As immigration officers were questioned in the witness box of the [[Inner London Crown Court]] it became clear that not only had video footage gone missing but that an investigation log had been tampered with. The trial was halted by Judge Nic Madge, who said in court: "I am satisfied that officers at the heart of this prosecution have deliberately concealed important evidence and lied on oath”. The Judge added: “The bad faith and misconduct started in 2011, when two of the principal defendants were arrested, and has continued throughout the course of this trial. In my judgment, it has tainted the whole case. It has tainted the prosecution against all seven defendants. It is a case in which the prosecution should not be allowed to benefit from the serious misbehaviour of the officer in the case or the disclosure officer”. The Reverend Ntege and six other defendants were formally acquitted of all 17 charges, which related to marriages of convenience in order to bypass immigration laws. UK TV station [[Channel 4 News]] later reported that three immigration officers had been suspended and that the [[Independent Police Complaints Commission]] (IPCC) would be conducting an investigation. The [[Crown Prosecution Service]] (CPS) said that it accepted that the handling of the case had fallen below acceptable standards and that it would conduct a full review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.channel4.com/news/trial-collapses-after-immigration-officials-lie-under-oath|title=Trial collapses after immigration officials 'lie under oath'|last=Israel|first=Simon |date=23 October 2014 |website=channel4.com|publisher=Channel 4 News |accessdate=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:World Disarmament Conference Low.jpg|thumb|End of conference, [[David Low (cartoonist)|David Low]], 1937.]]
The '''Conference for the Reduction and Limitation of Armaments''' of 1932–1934 (sometimes '''World Disarmament Conference''' or '''Geneva Disarmament Conference''') was a failed effort by member states of the [[League of Nations]], together with the United States, to actualize the ideology of [[disarmament]].  It took place in the Swiss city of [[Geneva]], 1932 to 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Philip John Noel-Baker,  ''First World Disarmament Conference and Why It Failed'' (1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

The first effort at international arms limitation was made at the [[Hague Conferences]] of 1901 and 1907, which had failed in their primary objective.  Although many contemporary commentators (and [[Article 231 of the Treaty of Versailles]]) had blamed the outbreak of the [[First World War]] on the war guilt of Germany, historians writing in the 1930s began to emphasize the quick arms race preceding 1914.  Further, all the major powers except the [[United States|US]] had committed themselves to disarmament in both the [[Treaty of Versailles]] and the [[Covenant of the League of Nations]]. A substantial international non-governmental campaign to promote disarmament also developed in the 1920s and early 1930s.

A preparatory commission was initiated by the League in 1925; by 1931, there was sufficient support to hold a conference, which duly began under the chairmanship of former [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|British Foreign Secretary]] [[Arthur Henderson]].  The motivation behind the talks can be summed up by an extract from the message President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] sent to the conference: "If all nations will agree wholly to eliminate from possession and use the weapons which make possible a successful attack, defences automatically will become impregnable and the frontiers and independence of every nation will become secure."&lt;ref&gt;United States Department of State, ''Peace and War: United States Foreign Policy 1931—1941'' (United States Government Printing Office, Washington, 1943) pp. 180—181&lt;/ref&gt;

The talks were beset by a number of difficulties from the outset.  Germany immediately demanded to be allowed 'military equality' or it would leave.  The French, for their part, were equally insistent that German military inferiority was their only insurance from future conflict as serious as they had endured in the First World War. Britain and the  U.S. were unprepared to offer the additional security commitments that France requested in exchange for limitation of French armaments. After 10 months of negotiations, France, Britain and Italy announced, Germany and the other States disarmed by the Versailles Treaty should be insured equality in a system which gives security to all nations."&lt;ref&gt; Davies, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; The parties could not agree on what constituted "offensive" and "defensive" weapons.  

The talks broke down and [[Hitler]] withdrew Germany from both the Conference and the [[League of Nations]] in October 1933.  The 1930s had proved far too self-interested an international period to accommodate multilateral action in favour of pacifism.
