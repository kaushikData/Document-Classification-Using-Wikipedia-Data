"'''1984'''" is an American television commercial that introduced the [[Apple Macintosh]] personal computer. It was conceived by [[Steve Hayden (copywriter)|Steve Hayden]], Brent Thomas and [[Lee Clow]] at [[TBWA\Chiat\Day|Chiat\Day]], produced by New York production company Fairbanks Films, and directed by [[Ridley Scott]]. English athlete [[Anya Major]] performed as the unnamed heroine and [[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]] as [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Graham |first1=David |title=David's film appearances |url=http://davidgraham.co/blog/?page_id=14 |website=David Graham Official Site |accessdate=28 July 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6aLn5tbON?url=http://davidgraham.co/blog/?page_id=14 |archivedate=July 28, 2015 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; It first aired in 10 local outlets,&lt;ref name="NYT84March"&gt;{{cite news| title= The Computer, the Consumer and Privacy | url= https://www.nytimes.com/1984/03/04/weekinreview/the-computer-the-consumer-and-privacy.html| date= March 4, 1984| first= David |last=Burnham| location= Washington DC | publisher= The New York Times| accessdate= January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[Twin Falls, Idaho]], where Chiat\Day ran the ad on December 31, 1983, at the last possible break before midnight on [[KMVT]], so that the advertisement qualified for 1983 advertising awards.&lt;ref name=floss&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mentalfloss.com/article/29911/true-story-apples-1984-ads-first-broadcastbefore-super-bowl |title=The True Story of Apple's '1984' Ad's First Broadcast...Before the Super Bowl |accessdate=December 3, 2013 |work=mental_floss}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Folklore1984"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.folklore.org/StoryView.py?story=1984.txt | title=1984 | publisher=Folklore.org | date=September 2004 | accessdate=2016-02-08 | author=Hertzfeld, Andy | page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its second televised airing, and only national airing, was on January 22, 1984, during a break in the third quarter of the telecast of [[Super Bowl XVIII]] by [[CBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.duke.edu/~tlove/mac.htm |title=Apple's 1984: The Introduction of the Macintosh in the Cultural History of Personal Computers |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/19991005015117/http://www.duke.edu/~tlove/mac.htm |archivedate=October 5, 1999 |first=Ted |last=Friedman |date=October 1997 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In one interpretation of the commercial, "1984" used the unnamed heroine to represent the coming of the Macintosh (indicated by her white [[Tank top (shirt)|tank top]] with a stylized line drawing of [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]’s [[Macintosh]] computer on it) as a means of saving humanity from "conformity" ([[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]).&lt;ref name=cellini&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb197/is_200401/ai_n5556112 |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090628133757/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb197/is_200401/ai_n5556112 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2009-06-28 |title=The Story Behind Apple's '1984' TV commercial: Big Brother at 20 |accessdate=May 9, 2008 |last=Cellini |first=Adelia |date=January 2004 |work=[[MacWorld]] |volume=21 |issue=1 |page=18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These images were an [[allusion]] to [[George Orwell]]'s noted novel, ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', which described a [[dystopia]]n future ruled by a televised "Big Brother".  The estate of George Orwell and the television rightsholder to the novel ''Nineteen Eighty-Four'' considered the commercial to be a copyright infringement and sent a [[cease-and-desist]] letter to Apple and Chiat\Day in April 1984.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.dartmouthlawjournal.org/articles/106-115.pdf |title= ‘Big Brother’ is Watching Apple: The Truth About the Super Bowl's Most Famous Ad |first= William R. |last= Coulson |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110725220353/http://www.dartmouthlawjournal.org/articles/106-115.pdf |archivedate= July 25, 2011 |format= PDF |work= [[Dartmouth Law Journal]] |volume= 7 |issue= 1 |pages= 106–115 |date= Winter 2009 | accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, The [[Clio Awards]] added it to its Hall of Fame, and ''[[Advertising Age]]'' placed it on the top of its list of 50 greatest commercials.&lt;ref name="nyt1995adage"/&gt;

==Plot==
The commercial opens with a [[dystopia|dystopic]], industrial setting in blue and grayish tones, showing a line of people (of [[Androgyny|ambiguous gender]]) marching in unison through a long tunnel monitored by a string of [[telescreen]]s. This is in sharp contrast to the full-color shots of the nameless runner ([[Anya Major]]). She looks like a competitive track and field athlete, wearing an athletic "uniform" (red athletic shorts, running shoes, a white [[Tank top (shirt)|tank top]] with a [[cubist]] picture of Apple's [[Macintosh]] computer, a white sweat band on her left wrist, and a red one on her right), and is carrying a large brass-headed [[Hammer throw|hammer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Moriarty |first= Sandra |url= http://spot.colorado.edu/~moriarts/viscueing.html|title= An Interpretive Study of Visual Cues in Advertising |publisher= [[University of Colorado System|University of Colorado]] |accessdate= January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rows of marching minions evoke the opening scenes of ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]''.
[[File:Ad apple 1984 2.png|right|thumb|[[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]] ([[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]]) speaking to his audience]]
As she is chased by four police officers (presumably agents of the [[Thought Police]]) wearing black uniforms, protected by [[Riot control|riot gear]], helmets with [[Face shield#Police|visors]] covering their faces, and armed with large [[Club (weapon)|night sticks]], she races towards a large screen with the image of a [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]-like figure ([[David Graham (actor)|David Graham]], also seen on the telescreens earlier) giving a speech:

{{quote|Today, we celebrate the first glorious anniversary of the Information Purification Directives. We have created, for the first time in all history, a garden of pure ideology—where each worker may bloom, secure from the pests purveying contradictory truths. Our Unification of Thoughts is more powerful a weapon than any fleet or army on earth. We are one people, with one will, one resolve, one cause. Our enemies shall talk themselves to death, and we will bury them with their own confusion. We ''shall'' prevail!}}

The runner, now close to the screen, hurls the hammer towards it, right at the moment Big Brother announces, “we shall prevail!” In a flurry of light and smoke, the screen is destroyed, shocking the people watching the screen.

The commercial concludes with a portentous voiceover, accompanied by scrolling black text (in Apple's early signature "[[Apple Garamond|Garamond]]" typeface); the hazy, whitish-blue aftermath of the cataclysmic event serves as the background. It reads: "On January 24th, Apple Computer will introduce Macintosh. And you'll see why [[1984]] won't be like '[[Nineteen Eighty-Four|1984]].'"

The screen fades to black as the voiceover ends, and the rainbow Apple logo appears.

===Development===
The commercial was created by the advertising agency [[TBWA\Chiat\Day|Chiat/Day]], of [[Venice, Los Angeles, California|Venice]], California, with copy by [[Steve Hayden (copywriter)|Steve Hayden]],&lt;ref name=npr&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1627800 |title=A Look Back at Apple's Super Ad |accessdate=March 18, 2011 |last=Hansen |first=Liane |authorlink= Liane Hansen |date=February 1, 2004 |work= [[Weekend Edition Sunday]] |publisher=[[NPR]] |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110203045402/http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=1627800| archivedate= February 3, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; art direction by Brent Thomas, and creative direction by [[Lee Clow]].&lt;ref name=clow&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ciadvertising.org/SA/fall_02/adv382j/qwkag/assign2/master.htm |title=Lee Clow: His Masterpiece |accessdate=May 10, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The commercial "grew out of an abandoned print campaign" with a specific theme:&lt;ref name="NYT84March"/&gt;
{{quote|"[T]here are monster computers lurking in [[big business]] and [[big government]] that know everything from what motels you've stayed at to how much money you have in the bank. But at Apple we're trying to balance the scales by giving individuals the kind of computer power once reserved for corporations."}}
{{anchor|Budget}}
[[Ridley Scott]] (whose dystopian sci-fi film, ''[[Blade Runner]]'', was released one and a half years prior) was hired by agency producer Richard O'Neill to direct it. Less than two months after the Super Bowl airing, ''The New York Times'' reported that Scott "filmed it in England for about $370,000";&lt;ref name="NYT84March"/&gt; In 2005 writer Ted Friedman said the commercial had a then-"unheard-of production budget of $900,000."&lt;ref name=friedman&gt;{{Cite book |chapterurl= http://tedfriedman.com/electric-dreams/chapter-5-apples-1984/ |title=Electric Dreams: Computers in American Culture |chapter=Chapter 5: 1984 |accessdate=October 6, 2011 |last=Friedman |first= Ted |year=2005 |publisher= [[New York University Press]]|isbn=0-8147-2740-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The actors who appeared in the commercial were paid $25 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://adage.com/article/special-report-4as-conference/clow-hayden-reminisce-making-apple-s-1984/233775/ |title= Clow and Hayden Reminisce about Making Apple's '1984' |first= Rupal |last= Parekh |work= Advertising Age |date= March 29, 2012 |accessdate= March 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Scott later admitted that he accepted brutal budget constraints because he believed in the ad's concept, outlining how the total cost was less than $250,000 and that he used local [[skinheads]] to portray the broken, pale "drones" in the commercial.

[[Steve Jobs]] and [[John Sculley]] were so enthusiastic about the final product that they "...purchased one and a half minutes of ad time for the Super Bowl, annually the most-watched television program in America. In December 1983 they screened the commercial for the Apple Board of Directors. To Jobs' and Sculley's surprise, the entire board hated the commercial."&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt;&lt;ref name="hayden"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/digital/e3i543ab57159cb298a4d8c4c408b7a539d |title= '1984': As Good as It Gets |first= Steve |last= Hayden |work= [[Adweek]] |date= January 30, 2011 |accessdate=March 18, 2011 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110201011651/http://www.adweek.com/aw/content_display/news/digital/e3i543ab57159cb298a4d8c4c408b7a539d| archivedate= February 1, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{r|dvorak19840227}} However, Sculley himself got "cold feet" and asked Chiat/Day to sell off the two commercial spots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Issacson |first= Walter |authorlink= Walter Isaacson |title= [[Steve Jobs (book)|Steve Jobs]] |publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn= 1-4516-4853-7|year=2011}}{{page needed|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the board's dislike of the film, [[Steve Wozniak]] and others at Apple showed copies to friends, and he offered to pay for half of the spot personally if Jobs paid the other half.&lt;ref name="dvorak19840227"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gy4EAAAAMBAJ&amp;lpg=PA15&amp;pg=PA112#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true | title=Apple's stagnation | work=InfoWorld | date=1984-02-27 | accessdate=18 January 2015 | author=Dvorak, John C. | page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt; This turned out to be unnecessary. Of the original ninety seconds booked, Chiat/Day resold thirty seconds to another advertiser, then claimed they could not sell the other 60 seconds, when in fact they did not even try.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Steve Jobs |year=2011 |publisher= [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |isbn= 1-4516-4853-7|first= Walter |last=Isaacson |page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==={{anchor|Interpretation}}Intended message===
In his 1983 Apple [[keynote address]], Steve Jobs read the following story before showcasing a preview of the commercial:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSiQA6KKyJo |title=1983 Apple Keynote: The "1984" Ad Introduction |publisher= [[YouTube]] |date= April 1, 2006 |accessdate=January 22, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"[...] It is now 1984. It appears IBM wants it all. Apple is perceived to be the only hope to offer IBM a run for its money. Dealers initially welcoming IBM with open arms now fear an IBM dominated and controlled future. They are increasingly turning back to Apple as the only force that can ensure their future freedom. IBM wants it all and is aiming its guns on its last obstacle to industry control: Apple. Will ''Big Blue'' dominate the entire computer industry? The entire information age? Was George Orwell right about 1984?"}}

In March 1984 Michael Tyler, a communications expert quoted by ''The New York Times'', said "The Apple ad expresses a potential of small computers. This potential may not automatically flow from the company's product. But if enough people held a shared intent, [[grass-roots]] [[electronic bulletin board]]s (through which computer users share messages) might result in better balancing of political power."&lt;ref name="NYT84March"/&gt;

In 2004, Adelia Cellini writing for ''[[Macworld]]'', summarized the message:&lt;ref name=cellini/&gt;
{{quote|"Let's see—an all-powerful entity blathering on about Unification of Thoughts to an army of soulless drones, only to be brought down by a plucky, Apple-esque underdog. So Big Brother, the villain from Apple's '1984' Mac ad, represented [[IBM]], right? According to the ad's creators, that's not exactly the case. The original concept was to show the fight for the control of computer technology as a struggle of the few against the many, says TBWA/Chiat/Day's [[Lee Clow]]. Apple wanted the Mac to symbolize the idea of empowerment, with the ad showcasing the Mac as a tool for combating conformity and asserting originality. What better way to do that than have a striking blonde athlete take a sledgehammer to the face of that ultimate symbol of conformity, Big Brother?"}}

==Reception==
[[Image:Macintosh 128k transparency.png|thumb|The first Macintosh (1984), The [[Macintosh 128K]]]]

Art director Brent Thomas said Apple "had wanted something to 'stop America in its tracks, to make people think about computers, to make them think about Macintosh.' With about $3.5 million worth of Macintoshes sold just after the advertisement ran, Thomas judged the effort 'absolutely successful.' 'We also set out to smash the old [[wikt:canard|canard]] that the computer will enslave us,' he said. 'We did not say the computer will set us free&amp;mdash;I have no idea how it will work out. This was strictly a marketing position.'"&lt;ref name="NYT84March"/&gt;

===Social impact===
Ted Friedman, in his 2005 text, ''Electric Dreams: Computers in American Culture'', notes the impact of the commercial:

:Super Bowl viewers were overwhelmed by the startling ad. The ad garnered millions of dollars worth of free publicity, as news programs rebroadcast it that night. It was quickly hailed by many in the advertising industry as a masterwork. ''[[Advertising Age]]'' named it the 1980s ''Commercial of the Decade'', and it continues to rank high on lists of the most influential commercials of all time [...] '1984' was never broadcast again, adding to its mystique.&lt;ref name=friedman/&gt;

"1984" became a signature representation of [[Apple computers]]. It was scripted as a thematic element in the 1999 [[docudrama]], ''[[Pirates of Silicon Valley]]'', which explores the rise of Apple and [[Microsoft]] (the film opens and closes with references to the commercial including a re-enactment of the heroine running towards the screen of ''Big Brother'' and clips of the original commercial).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title= Review of ''Pirates of Silicon Valley'' Movie |url= http://www.dotjournal.com/review-pirates-silicon-valley-movie | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061107170215/http://www.dotjournal.com/review-pirates-silicon-valley-movie | archivedate= November 7, 2006 |date= October 29, 2006| publisher= DotJournal.com | first= Patrick|last= Grote| accessdate= January 24, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The "1984" ad was also prominent in the 20th anniversary celebration of the [[Macintosh]] in 2004, as Apple reposted a new version of the ad on its website and showed it during Jobs's Keynote Address at [[Macworld/iWorld|Macworld Expo]] in San Francisco, California. In this updated version, an [[iPod]], complete with signature white earbuds, was digitally added to the heroine. Keynote Attendees were given a poster showing the heroine with an iPod as a commemorative gift.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theregister.co.uk/2004/01/23/the_apple_mac |title= The Apple Mac Is 20 |first= Tony |last= Smith |work= The Register |date= January 23, 2004 |accessdate= April 1, 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; And the ad has also been cited as the turning point for Super Bowl commercials, which had been important and popular before (especially with the Coca-Cola ad featuring [[Joe Greene (American football)|Joe Greene]] from a years earlier) but after "1984" those ads became the most expensive, creative and influential advertising set for all television coverage.

In March 2007, the advertisement attracted attention again as ''[[Hillary 1984]]'', a [[Mashup (video)|video mashup]] of the original commercial with footage of [[Hillary Clinton]] used in the place of Big Brother, [[Viral video|went viral]] in the early stages of the [[Democratic Party presidential primaries, 2008|race for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination]]. The video was produced in support of [[Barack Obama]] by Phil de Vellis, an employee of [[Blue State Digital]], but was made without the knowledge of either [[Barack Obama presidential campaign, 2008|Obama's campaign]], or his employer: de Vellis stated that he made the video in one afternoon at home using a Mac and some software. Political commentators including [[Carla Marinucci]] and [[Arianna Huffington]], as well as de Vellis himself, suggested that the video demonstrated the way technology had created new opportunities for individuals to make an impact on politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sfgate.com/politics/article/Political-video-smackdown-Hillary-1984-2609651.php |title=Political video smackdown / 'Hillary 1984': Unauthorized Internet ad for Obama converts Apple Computer's '84 Super Bowl spot into a generational howl against Clinton's presidential bid |last=Marinucci |first=Carla|author-link=Carla Marinucci|date=18 March 2007 |website=[[SFgate.com]] |access-date=11 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/arianna-huffington/who-created-hillary-1984-_b_43978.html?guccounter=1|title=Who Created “Hillary 1984”?

Revisiting the commercial in ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' thirty years after it aired, [[Rebecca Solnit]] suggested that "1984" did not so much herald a new era of liberation as a new era of oppression. She wrote, "I want to yell at that liberatory young woman with her sledgehammer: 'Don't do it!' Apple is not different. That industry is going to give rise to innumerable forms of triviality and misogyny, to the concentration of wealth and the dispersal of mental concentration. To suicidal, underpaid Chinese factory workers whose reality must be like that of the shuffling workers in the commercial. If you think a crowd of people staring at one screen is bad, wait until you have created a world in which billions of people stare at their own screens even while walking, driving, eating in the company of friends—all of them eternally elsewhere."&lt;ref&gt;Solnit, Rebecca (December 2014) "Poison Apples." ''Harper's.'' Page 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2624">Adso is a  [[Chinese language|Chinese]] to [[English language|English]] dictionary and [[natural language processing]] engine for Chinese text. The Adso project started in 2001. Its gist translation and dictionary interface are online at the Adsotrans website,&lt;ref&gt;http://adsotrans.com&lt;/ref&gt; where its software and database are also available for download.&lt;ref&gt;http://adsotrans.com/downloads&lt;/ref&gt; These downloads include a copy of the "Adsotrans Attribution-NonCommercial License 1.1"&lt;ref&gt;https://github.com/wtanaka/adso/blob/master/license/ADSO.license.html&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional [[README]] that states "Free use may be made of the software for machine translation, hanzi-to-pinyin conversion and text segmentation purposes, provided that attribution is given, including a link to our project."

== Content ==

With over 195,000 entries, Adso is the largest free Chinese–English dictionary compilation on the Internet. It differs from other projects in providing [[part of speech]] and [[onthology|ontological]] data on word entries, and in reviewing user contributions. Project data is generated collaboratively by users through an online dictionary hosted at Popup Chinese.

The Adso software engine provides text segmentation, hanzi-to-pinyin, [[gist translation]], annotation, gist extraction and semantic analysis services. It is heavily used as a translation aid for Chinese-English translation. Adso also supports a specially-defined XML language which customizes software output. This has made it useful as preprocessor for [[statistical machine translation]] software such as [[GIZA++]] or for reverse-index search engines such as [[Lucene]].

After the release of the [[Panama Papers]], in 2016 an unknown source handed over internal data from the national corporate registry of the Bahamas to [[Frederik Obermaier]] and [[Bastian Obermayer]], who analyzed them with the help of the [[International Consortium of Investigative Journalists]] (ICIJ). At the same time ICIJ, [[Süddeutsche Zeitung]] and other media partners published detailed reporting before they published an online database of offshore entities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vice.com/read/what-we-know-so-far-about-the-bahamas-leaks-876|title=What We Know So Far About the Bahamas Leaks|date=22 September 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The files provided data on 175,888 [[shell companies]] and trusts that were established in the Bahamas between 1990 and 2016. The 38 gigabyte of data showed that "several current and former heads of state and government and high-ranking politicians, including former EU Commissioner [[Neelie Kroes]]; Colombia’s former mining minister Carlos Caballero Argáez; [[Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani]], the former prime minister of Qatar; and Angola’s vice-president, [[Manuel Vicente|Manuel Domingos Vicente]] were respectively are directors, secretaries, or presidents of Bahamian companies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://international.sueddeutsche.de/post/150734811455/bahamasleaks-frequently-asked-questions-and|title=The Bahamas Leak FAQ|website=SZ International}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4954">The '''Bellman joke''' is a type of simple [[joke]] popular among [[Sweden|Swedish]] schoolchildren, always including a person named Bellman as the main character. 

The jokes first became popular in the 19th century, and were originally inspired by the life of the poet and composer [[Carl Michael Bellman]]. The first known Bellman joke&lt;ref name="Klintberg"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Klintberg, Bengt af. | date=November 1987 | url=http://www.buks.dk/PDF/Varfor_er_bellmannhistorierna_roliga.pdf | title=Varför är Bellmanhistorierna roliga? |trans-title=Why are Bellman jokes so funny? | journal=Børne-og UngdomsKulturSammenslutningen (BUKS) | volume=9 | language=Swedish | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502234624/http://www.buks.dk/PDF/Varfor_er_bellmannhistorierna_roliga.pdf | archivedate=2 May 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; appears in the preface to an 1835 collection of Bellman's works, in which the publisher reprints an 1808 letter from a contemporary of Bellman, containing the following anecdote.

{{cquote|[Bellman] rarely owned more than one coat. Once when [[Gustav III of Sweden|King Gustav]] met him in the street he was wearing no more than a nightdress, at which the King said: "But my dear Bellman, you look so ill-clad," to which he bowed and replied, "I humbly assure your Majesty that I have the whole of my wardrobe on me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=1LOb3NnjzJkC&amp;pg=PA22 ''Valda Skrifter''] ("Selected Writings"), published by Henrik Gustaf Nordström, Stockholm, 1835. Page 22. {{quote|Hans sinnelag var det aldrabästa emot andra, alla tjente han, alla gaf han med sig, ägde till slut sällan mer än en rock; också mötte K. Gustaf honom en gång på gatan, uti en ganska stor negligée, och då Konungen sade: "Men, min kära Bellman, ni ser så illa klädd ut," bugade han sig och sade: "Jag kan i underdånighet försäkra Eder Maj:t, att jag ändå har hela min garderobe på mig."}}
&lt;/ref&gt;}}

19th-century Bellman jokes tended to focus on C. M. Bellman's life at court, and often contained sexual humour. Since then, however, the Bellman character of the jokes has changed into a generic Swede, rather than the historical figure. The shift from jokes told by adults to jokes told mainly by young schoolchildren up to 10 years of age probably happened in the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref name="Klintberg"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Klintberg, Bengt af. | date=November 1987 | url=http://www.buks.dk/PDF/Varfor_er_bellmannhistorierna_roliga.pdf | title=Varför är Bellmanhistorierna roliga? |trans-title=Why are Bellman jokes so funny? | journal=Børne-og UngdomsKulturSammenslutningen (BUKS) | volume=9 | language=Swedish | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502234624/http://www.buks.dk/PDF/Varfor_er_bellmannhistorierna_roliga.pdf | archivedate=2 May 2013 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The modern versions of the Bellman jokes often include Bellman and two other characters of different nationalities, with the former coming out victorious from a tricky situation. However, in many Bellman jokes, Bellman is portrayed as something of an [[anti-hero]], who may cheat, lie or even smell very bad in order to get the last laugh. Another common theme is that Bellman fools or makes fun of a priest, policeman or other authority figure. He can thus be seen as a modern sort of a [[trickster]]. The jokes tend to involve bodily functions such as [[urinating]] or [[defecating]].

The ubiquitous character of the stories and the fact that they have been told in various forms for so many years have made them subject to study by [[ethnology|ethnologists]] such as [[Bengt af Klintberg]]&lt;ref&gt;Klintberg, Bengt af. 1998. ''Kuttrasju: Folkloriska och kulturhistoriska essäer''. Stockholm: Norstedts&lt;/ref&gt; and researchers in children's culture.

==Examples of contemporary Bellman jokes==
{{unreferenced section|date=May 2010 }}

A Russian, a German and Bellman wanted to see who could swim the fastest across [[Atlantic Ocean|the Atlantic]]. First out was the German. He swam one kilometer and drowned. 
Next came the Russian. He swam 10 kilometers and then he drowned. 
Now it was Bellman's turn. He swam and swam until he almost reached the coast of America &amp;ndash; then he got tired and swam back.

A Dane, a Norwegian and Bellman made a wager on who could remain inside a goat pen the longest. First out was the Dane, who came out after just 10 minutes yelling "Damn! The goat stinks!" After him the Norwegian went in, and after half an hour he came out yelling, "Damn! The goat stinks!" Finally Bellman went in. After two hours the goat came rushing out yelling "Damn! Bellman stinks!"

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11901">The '''Berlin Memorandum''' was a document drawn up by the three imperial world powers in 1876 to address the [[Eastern Question]] during the [[Eastern Question#Great Eastern Crisis|Crisis of 1875-1878]]. The purpose of the Berlin Memorandum was for the three imperial powers of [[Imperial Russia|Russia]], [[Austria-Hungary]], and [[German Empire|Germany]] to address the state of relations between the [[Islam]]ic [[Ottoman Empire]] and with the Christian peoples of the [[Balkans]], with whom these imperial powers had international relationships and interests, and to correct the [[Gyula Andrássy#The "Andrássy Note"|"Andrássy Note"]], a document that preceded the Berlin Memorandum and had similar intentions in creating an armistice and plan of reforms for the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire.

==Background==
As the Ottoman Empire began to decline in the late 19th century, there were many nationalistic Christian uprisings in the Balkan States, whose populations wished to be free from the Islamic rule of the Ottoman Empire. In 1875, there were a series of rebellions that broke out first in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and then in [[Bulgaria]]. One of the main points of contention between the Balkans and their Ottoman rulers was the religious difference, which led to a bolstering of religious and ethnic nationalism that contributed to the uprisings that took place during the period of the Balkan Crisis.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnvn.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The bloodiness and destruction of Christians led to an exodus of Christians into [[Serbia]] and [[Montenegro]], and these countries had gained the diplomatic support of the Russian Empire.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.icrc.org/eng/resources/documents/misc/57jnvn.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "Andrássy Note"==
Initially, the three great powers, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia formed the [[League of the Three Emperors]] in 1872 and met to discuss the state of relations in the [[Near East]]. This meeting concluded with the policy of non-intervention in the East. However, as religious tensions between Christians and Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina began to come to a head, Count [[Gyula Andrássy]] of Austria-Hungary began to feel the need for religious reform in the Balkans, and so on December 30, 1875, Austria-Hungary, Russia, and Germany proposed the Andrássy Note. The note called for religious reforms that would allow the coexistence of Christians and Muslims in Bosnia and Herzegovina by incorporating Christian law into the Ottoman Empire’s traditional Islamic law, reforms in the system of tax farming that would alleviate the tax burden on Bosnia and Herzegovina, and ensure that the Ottoman Empire make proper revenue in taxes, and laws that would address the agrarian conflict in Bosnia and Herzegovina.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mtholyoke.edu/acad/intrel/andrassy.htm&lt;/ref&gt; However, by 1876, the note was considered a failure because the Ottomans, who had been pushed by Andrássy and never had intentions of reforming the Empire, had never acted to implement it.

==The Berlin Memorandum==
Because the Andrássy Note had been a failure, and the Balkan people were still revolting through the beginning of 1876, the Russian Prince [[Alexander Gorchakov|Gorchakov]] invited Andrássy to a meeting in [[Berlin]] in order to collaborate on a new armistice between the Balkans and the Ottoman Empire along with German Prince [[Otto von Bismarck|Bismarck]], as well as to forge an alliance with Austria and Germany. Andrássy complied, but only if he could arrive to Berlin early in order to have a preliminary meeting with Bismarck to discuss relations between Austria-Hungary and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;David Harris, ''A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of 1875-1878: The First Year'' (Stanford University Press, 1936), 288.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1876, Germany, Austria-Hungary, and Russia met in Berlin to discuss the response and plan of action to take in regards to the state of affairs in the Ottoman Empire and the Balkans. They drafted the Berlin Memorandum, which voiced the intent to protect the Christian populations of the Balkans. The Berlin Memorandum demanded that the Ottoman Empire end military response to the [[Slavs|Slav]]ic rebels for two months in order to give enough time for reforms to be put in place in the Balkans.&lt;ref&gt;http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=CHP18760731.2.23&lt;/ref&gt; The memorandum also requested that an international committee be formed and instituted in the Balkans in order to protect the Christians, and see that the changes proposed in the Andrássy Note of 1875 could be administered in Bosnia and Herzegovina. The new armistice, which the Berlin Memorandum was seeking, was incorporated into the following five points, which had originated in Andrássy’s initial note:

# Provision by the Turkish government of materials for rebuilding houses and churches and the furnishing of subsistence until the next harvest,
# Distribution of this aid in collaboration with the mixed commission provided for 	in the Andrássy Note,
# Temporary concentration of Turkish troops,
# Right of the Christians to bear arms,
# Surveillance by foreign consuls or delegates of the application of reforms in general and repatriation in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of 1875-1878: The First Year'', 298&lt;/ref&gt;

The end of the note was written by Prince Gorkachov of Russia and states that if the Ottoman Empire did not meet the demands of the Berlin Memorandum and failed to comply with the two-month armistice requested by the Berlin Memorandum, the three authoring imperial powers would take necessary international measures to provide for the safety of the people in the Balkans "in order to arrest the prevailing evil and prevent its development."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of 1875-1878: The First Year'', 298&lt;/ref&gt; The day following the agreement of the three imperial powers, [[France|French]], [[Italy|Italian]], and [[Great Britain|British]] representatives were summoned to Berlin in order to discuss the new armistice agreement.

==Western Response to the Eastern Question==
The response of the three major western powers of Great Britain, Italy, and France varied, though France and Italy’s position was generally the same while Britain had rejected the Berlin Memorandum completely.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of 1875-1878: The First Year'', 301&lt;/ref&gt; While Italy did have a position on any decisions made by the central powers, it initially deferred the controversy surrounding the Eastern Question because Italy had a power struggle of its own within the Italian government at the time of both the Andrássy Note and the Berlin Memorandum. In April 1876, Italian Prime Minister [[Luigi Amedeo Melegari|Melegari]] promised the German minister the service of his army in Bosnia if necessary.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of 1875-1878: The First Year'', 301&lt;/ref&gt; On May 14, the day after the Berlin Memorandum was circulated in the city of Berlin, Italy gave its full and abiding support to the provisions made by the Berlin Memorandum through telegraph.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of 1875-1878: The First Year'', 302&lt;/ref&gt; France’s response to the memorandum followed that of the Italians. While France’s role in the outcome of the Eastern Question seemed inconsequential, the tragic murder of a French consul in [[Salonika]] shocked and appalled French officials, and thus the memorandum earned support from France on the grounds that peace would be achieved in the Balkans and that the demands of the Berlin Memorandum would include the input of the three outside western powers in order to bring about the desired change.&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of 1875-1878: The First Year'', 303&lt;/ref&gt; While France and Italy quickly gave their support to the Berlin Memorandum, British Prime Minister [[Benjamin Disraeli]] rejected the document altogether on May 16, 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Pearce and Malcolm Stewart, ''British Political History, 1867-2001'' (New York: Routledge, 2010), 152&lt;/ref&gt; His reasons for rejecting the memorandum were cited by his idea that the three imperial powers were using the initiatives of the Berlin Memorandum to put an end to the Ottoman Empire.&lt;ref&gt;John Aldred, ''British Imperial and Foreign Policy, 1846-1890'', (Heinemann Educational Publishers, 2004), 39&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli felt that the meeting of Russia, Germany, and Austria-Hungary had not adequately included Great Britain in the discussions of the crisis, and as such, prevented Britain and Germany from "exchanging opinions."&lt;ref&gt;Harris, ''A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of 1875-1878: The First Year'', 305&lt;/ref&gt; Disraeli drew up his own memorandum because he felt that the three empires were conspiring to disband the Ottoman Empire. He even encouraged Turkey to reject the document and sent a fleet to [[Beşik Bay, Çanakkale|Besika Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;Pearce and Stewart,''British Political History, 1867-2001'', 152&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that all the provisions were erroneous, for example, he believed that the proposed relief, which the Ottoman Empire was to administer was far beyond the means of the Sultan, and that concentrating troops in any situation would lead to chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Harris,''A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of 1875-1878: The First Year'', 307&lt;/ref&gt; The cabinet nonetheless approved Disraeli’s rejection of the Berlin Memorandum&lt;ref&gt;Harris,''A Diplomatic History of the Balkan Crisis of 1875-1878: The First Year'', 308&lt;/ref&gt; and arguably, the reason why this armistice was unsuccessful, was because it lacked the British approval, which would have given the Berlin Memorandum unanimous support from the western European powers.&lt;ref&gt;http://paperspast.natlib.govt.nz/cgi-bin/paperspast?a=d&amp;d=CHP18760731.2.23&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conclusion==
Although the Berlin Memorandum made an effort to create a temporary armistice and correct the situation in the Balkans, tensions between the Ottoman Empire and the Christian Balkans continued. The violence continued to spread into Bulgaria, Serbia, and Montenegro, and was met with a massacre of the Bulgarians by the Ottomans.&lt;ref&gt;Aldred, ''British Imperial and Foreign Policy, 1846-1890'', 39&lt;/ref&gt; In June and July 1876, tensions between the Ottoman Empire and Serbia and Montenegro came to a head when Serbia and Montenegro declared war on the Ottoman Empire, culminating with the involvement of Russia in the war in 1877 in order to protect their Balkan allies.&lt;ref&gt;Aldred,''British Imperial and Foreign Policy, 1846-1890'', 40&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:KoninklijkeBibliotheek2.jpg|thumb|The Huygens Institute is housed in the same building as the [[RKD]], the National Archives, the Nederlands Letterkundig Museum (LM), the [[Netherlands Music Institute]] (NMI) and the [[National Library of the Netherlands|Koninklijke Bibliotheek]].]]
The '''Biografisch Portaal''' (Biography Portal) is an initiative based at the [[Huygens Institute for Dutch History]] in [[The Hague]], with the aim of making biographical texts of the Netherlands more accessible.

The project was started in February 2010 with material for 40,000 digitized biographies, with the goal to grant digital access to all reliable information about (deceased) people of the Netherlands from the earliest beginnings of history up to modern times.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.denederlandsegrondwet.nl/9353000/1/j9vvihlf299q0sr/vickk0yn4tz3?ctx=vh511aqp95x8 article] on government website of the Dutch constitution&lt;/ref&gt;

The Netherlands as a geographic term includes former colonies, and the term "people" refers both to people born in the Netherlands and its former colonies, and also to people born elsewhere but active in the Netherlands and its former colonies. {{As of|2011}}, only biographical information about deceased people is included. The system used is based on the standards of the [[Text Encoding Initiative]]. Access to the Biografisch Portaal is available free through a web-based interface.

The project is a cooperative undertaking by ten scientific and cultural bodies in the Netherlands with the Huygens Institute as main contact. The other bodies are:
*The {{ill|Biografie Instituut|nl}}
*The [[Centraal Bureau voor Genealogie]] (CBG)
*The [[Digital Library for Dutch Literature]] (DBNL)
*[[Data Archiving and Networked Services]] (DANS)
*The [[International Institute of Social History]] (IISG)
*The [[Onderzoekscentrum voor Geschiedenis en Cultuur]] (OGC),
*The [[Parlementair Documentatie Centrum]] (PDC)
*The [[Netherlands Institute for Art History]] (RKD)

Besides ongoing digital projects, Dutch biographical dictionaries originally published in book form that have been digitized and incorporated into the indexes of the Biografisch Portaal are:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.biografischportaal.nl/about/collecties List of collections] on the Biografisch Portaal website&lt;/ref&gt;
* The work of [[Abraham van der Aa]], which was the first Dutch biographical dictionary
* The BWN, or ''[[Biografisch Woordenboek van Nederland]]''
* The NNBW, or ''[[Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek]]''
* The work of [[Johan Engelbert Elias]] on the Amsterdam regency known as ''Vroedschap van Amsterdam''
* The work of [[Barend Glasius]] known as ''Godgeleerd Nederland''
* The work of [[Roeland van Eynden]] and [[Adriaan van der Willigen]], known as ''Geschiedenis der vaderlandsche schilderkunst''
* The work of [[Jan van Gool]] known as ''Nieuwe Schouburg''
* The work of [[Jacob Campo Weyerman]] known as ''[[The Lives of Dutch painters and paintresses]]''&lt;ref&gt;This is the only indexed dictionary that cannot be accessed from [[IP address]]es outside Dutch university libraries&lt;/ref&gt;
* The BLNP, or ''[[Biografisch lexicon voor de geschiedenis van het Nederlands protestantisme]]''

As of November 2012 the Biografisch Portaal contained 80,206 persons in 125,592 biographies. In February 2012, a new project was started called "BiographyNed" to build an analytical tool for use with the Biografisch Portaal that will link biographies to events in time and space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.huygens.knaw.nl/toekenning-biographyned-huygens-ing-vu|title=Toekenning BiographyNed Huygens ING / VU|work=knaw.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main goal of the three-year project is to formulate ‘the boundaries of the Netherlands’.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.let.vu.nl/en/events/news/2012/grant-for-ehumanities-project-biographyned.asp|title=Grant for eHumanities project: BiographyNed - 2012 - Faculty of Arts, VU University Amsterdam|date=24 February 2012|work=vu.nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Boundaries of Parliamentary Constituencies 1885–1972''''' ({{ISBN|0-900178-09-4}}), [[F. W. S. Craig]], Political Reference Publications, [[Chichester]], [[Sussex]], 1972, provides text and outline map descriptions of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|United Kingdom Parliament]] [[United Kingdom constituencies|constituencies]] in Great Britain for the period 1918 to 1983 and in [[Northern Ireland]] for the period 1922 to 1983. Also, it includes maps outlining constituencies in Great Britain for the period 1885 to 1918.

It succeeds in covering a period later than 1972 because boundary changes which became effective in 1974 (for the [[United Kingdom general election, February 1974|February general election]]) had been decided in 1971. Only the dates for which the new boundaries would be effective were unknown in 1972. Boundaries described under ''1955-1970'' remained effective until 1974, and boundaries described under ''1971-'' were effective 1974 to 1983.

The maps divide England into three areas, southern, central and northern, and boundaries between these areas appear to have been very stable throughout the 1885 to 1983 period. Wales is mapped as ''Wales and Monmouthshire''.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Craig makes clear that a work of this kind is unlikely to be free from error, and error is apparent in the way [[district of burghs]] constituencies are shown in the maps. [[Kilmarnock District of Burghs (UK Parliament constituency)|Kilmarnock District of Burghs]], for example, is shown as if a single area in [[Ayrshire]]: in fact, when abolished in 1918, it consisted of two [[parliamentary burgh]]s in Ayrshire, two in [[Renfrewshire]] and one in [[Lanarkshire]].

Craig attributes the maps to David Bird and Peter Westley, saying they ''prepared the diagrams and frequently had to work from inadequate maps not always free from error''.

Craig points also to inadequacies in [[boundary commissions (United Kingdom)|boundary commission]] reports, which may have generated errors in the text and maps, despite efforts to check details. He draws particular attention to [[Leeds South (UK Parliament constituency)|Leeds South]], which commissioners had listed as having a major boundary change in 1955: in fact the constituency boundaries were unaltered, although the official description of it changed.

The '''''Chronicle of 754''''' (also called the '''''Mozarabic Chronicle''''' or '''''Continuatio Hispana''''') is a [[Latin]]-language history in 95 sections,&lt;ref&gt;In some manuscripts the sections are apportioned into 13 chapters and an appendix. See the edition of Lopez Pereira 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; which was composed in 754 in a part of Spain under Arab rule.&lt;ref&gt;According to Christys p. 2 it was the last Latin chronicle written in al-Andalus.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Chronicle'' contains the earliest reference in Latin to "Europeans" (''europenses''), whom it describes as having defeated the Saracens at the [[battle of Tours]] in 732.&lt;ref&gt;[[Kwame Anthony Appiah]] (2012), "Misunderstanding cultures: Islam and the West", ''Philosophy and Social Criticism'' '''38'''(4–5) 425–33.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Evert Van De Poll (2013), ''Europe and the Gospel: Past Influences, Current Developments, Mission Challenges'' (Versita), p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Author==
Its compiler was an anonymous [[Mozarab]] (Christian) chronicler, living under Arab rule in some part of [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberia]]. Since the 16th century, it has been attributed to an otherwise unknown bishop, '''Isidorus Pacensis''' but this attribution is now widely accepted as being the result of compounded errors. Henry Wace&lt;ref&gt;In Smith &amp; Wace 1880.&lt;/ref&gt; explained the origin and the phantom history of "Isidorus Pacensis", an otherwise unattested bishop of [[Pax Julia]] (modern [[Beja (Portugal)|Beja]], Portugal).&lt;ref&gt;"Isidorus Pacensis" appears in error as bishop of [[Badajos]] in Smith, ''A Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology'' (1870) vol. II, ''s.v.'' Isidorus, p. 627. Beja plays no role in the Chronicle, as might be expected in a work issued from that city, as [[Reinhart Dozy]] pointed out. Neither does Badajoz, because it did not exist at the time of the chronicle; Bishop Prudencio Sandoval of Pamplona, who first published the chronicle in its entirety in 1615, evidently thought Pax Julia was Badajoz, since he refers to "Isidore, bishop of Badajoz" in his title to the work, see Mommsen p. 333.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also some disagreement about the place where the ''Chronicle'' was written. Tailhan&lt;ref&gt;Tailhan seems to have been the first to reject Isidorus Pacensis as author, but remarkably believed the ''Chronicle'' to be a rhymed epic such as the [[Song of Roland]].&lt;/ref&gt; named [[Córdoba, Andalusia|Córdoba]] as the city of origin. [[Theodor Mommsen|Mommsen]] was the first to champion [[Toledo, Spain|Toledo]]. A recent study by Lopez Pereira&lt;ref&gt;p. 58-59.&lt;/ref&gt; rejects both these in favour of an unidentified smaller city in south-east Spain.

==The work==
The Chronicle of 754 covers the years 610&lt;ref&gt;It opens with the accession of [[Heraclius]] in the East and gives, at several removes, a thread of Byzantine history and the Arabian conquest of Syria.&lt;/ref&gt; to 754, during which it has few contemporary sources against which to check its veracity; some consider it one of the best sources for post- [[Visigothic]] history and for the story of the Arabian conquest of Spain and [[southern France]]; it provided the basis for [[Roger Collins]], ''The Arab Conquest of Spain, 711-797'' (Blackwell, 1989), the first modern historian to utilise it so thoroughly.&lt;ref&gt;H.V. Livermore dismissed it as largely mythological, in ''The Origins of Spain and Portugal'' (London: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1971); Collins, conversely, eschewed the later, mythologised Arabic accounts, for which he has been criticised.&lt;/ref&gt; It contains the most detailed account of the [[Battle of Tours|Battle of Poitiers-Tours]].

The Chronicle is a continuation of an earlier history. It survives in three manuscripts, of which the earliest, of the ninth century, is divided between the [[British Library]] and the [[Real Academia de la Historia|Biblioteca de la Real Academia de la Historia]], Madrid. The other manuscripts are of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries.&lt;ref&gt;C.C. de Hartmann , "The textual transmission of the Mozarabic Chronicle of 754" ''Early Medieval Europe'' '''8'''.1, (March 1999:13-29). Two of the manuscripts, though they bear no author's name,  were asserted by seventeenth-century scholars to bear the name of "Isidorus Pacensis (Wace 1880).&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Chronicle  was first published in its entirety in [[Pamplona]], 1615; it was printed in [[Migne]]’s ''Patr. Lat.'', vol. 96, p. 1253 sqq. and given a modern critical edition and translated into Spanish by José Eduardo Lopez Pereira.&lt;ref&gt;Firstly as ''Cronica mozarabe de 754'' (Zaragoza, 1980); followed by a revised Latin edition and translation, with numerous essays, in 2009 (see References below)&lt;/ref&gt; An English translation by Kenneth Baxter Wolf can be found in his volume ''Conquerors and Chroniclers of Early Medieval Spain'' (Liverpool, 1990).

The '''Cristero War''' or '''Cristero Rebellion''' (1926–29), also known as '''{{lang-es|La Cristiada|label=none|italics=no}}''' {{IPA-es|la kɾisˈtjaða|}}, was a widespread struggle in many central-western Mexican states against the [[Secularism|secularist]], [[anti-Catholicism|anti-Catholic]] and [[anti-clericalism|anti-clerical]] policies of the Mexican government. The rebellion was set off by enactment under [[President]] [[Plutarco Elías Calles]] of a statute to enforce the anti-clerical articles of the [[Mexican Constitution of 1917]] (also known as the [[Calles Law]]). Calles sought to eliminate the power of the [[Catholic Church]] and organizations affiliated with it as an institution, and also suppress popular religious celebration in local communities. The massive, popular rural uprising was tacitly supported by the Church hierarchy and was aided by urban Catholic support. US Ambassador [[Dwight W. Morrow]] brokered negotiations between the Calles government and the Church. The government made some concessions, the Church withdrew its support for the Cristero fighters and the conflict ended in 1929. It can be seen as a major event in the struggle between Church and State dating back to the 19th century with the [[War of Reform]], but it can also be interpreted as the last major peasant uprising in Mexico following the end of the military phase of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1920.

== Background ==
=== Church–State conflict ===
[[Image:Mexico Flag Cristeros.svg|thumb|A modern reproduction of the flag used by the Cristeros with references to "[[Feast of Christ the King|Viva Cristo Rey]]" and "[[Our Lady of Guadalupe|Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe]]"]]
The [[Mexican Revolution]] (1910–20) remains the largest conflict in Mexican history. The overthrow of dictator [[Porfirio Díaz]] unleashed disorder, with many contending factions and regions. The Catholic Church and the Díaz government had come to an informal ''modus vivendi'' whereby the State did not enforce the anticlerical articles of the liberal [[Constitution of 1857]], but also did not repeal them. Having a change of leadership or a wholesale overturning of the previous order was potentially a danger to the Church's position. In the democratizing wave of political activity, the National Catholic Party (''Partido Católico Nacional'') was formed. [[Francisco Madero]] was overthrown and assassinated in a February 1913 military coup led by Gen. [[Victoriano Huerta]], bringing back supporters of the Porfirian order; with the ouster of Huerta in 1914, the Catholic Church was the target of revolutionary violence and fierce anticlericalism by many Northern revolutionaries. The [[Constitutionalist]] faction won the revolution and its leader, [[Venustiano Carranza]], had a new revolutionary constitution drawn up. The [[Constitution of 1917]] strengthened the anticlericalism of the previous document. Neither President Carranza (1915–20) nor his successor, Gen. [[Alvaro Obregón]] (1920–24), enforced the anticlerical articles. The Calles administration (1924–28) felt its revolutionary initiatives and legal basis to pursue them were being challenged by the Catholic Church. To destroy the Church's influence over the Mexican people, anti-clerical laws were instituted, beginning a ten-year religious conflict that resulted in the death of thousands of armed civilians. On the opposing side was an armed professional military sponsored by the government. Calles' Mexico has been characterized by some as an [[atheist state]],&lt;ref&gt;Haas, Ernst B., [https://books.google.com/books?id=ldKJ_Re6p8AC&amp;pg Nationalism, Liberalism, and Progress: The dismal fate of new nations], Cornell Univ. Press 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and his program as being one to eradicate religion in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Cronon, E. David "American Catholics and Mexican Anticlericalism, 1933–1936", pp. 205–208, Mississippi Valley Historical Review, XLV, Sept. 1948&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Crisis in Church–State Relations ====
{{Modern persecutions of the Catholic Church}}
A period of peaceful resistance to the enforcement of the anticlerical provisions of the constitution by Mexican Catholics brought no result. Skirmishing broke out in 1926 and violent uprisings began in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Luis González (John Upton translator), ''San José de Gracia: Mexican Village in Transition'' (University of Texas Press, 1982), p. 154&lt;/ref&gt; The rebels called themselves ''Cristeros'', invoking the name of [[Jesus Christ]] under the title of "Cristo Rey" or ''Christ the King''. The rebellion is known for the [[Feminine Brigades of St. Joan of Arc]], a brigade of women who assisted the rebels in smuggling guns and ammunition, and for certain priests who were tortured and murdered in public (and later [[canonized]] by [[Pope John Paul II|Pope Saint John Paul II]]). The rebellion eventually ended by diplomatic means brokered by [[U.S. Ambassador to Mexico]] [[Dwight Whitney Morrow]], with financial relief and logistical assistance provided by the [[Knights of Columbus]].{{citation needed|date=January 2018}}

The rebellion attracted the attention of [[Pope Pius XI]], who issued a series of [[papal encyclicals]] between 1925–37. On December 11, 1925, the [[pontiff]] issued ''[[Quas primas]]'', instituting the [[Feast of Christ the King]]. On November 18, 1926, he issued ''[[Iniquis afflictisque]]'' (On the Persecution of the Church in Mexico), denouncing the violent anti-clerical persecution in Mexico.&lt;ref name="The Papacy: An Encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book|author=Philippe Levillain |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7VDcmDeLuV4C&amp;dq |title=The Papacy: An Encyclopedia|page=1208|year=2002|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the government's promises to the contrary, it continued the persecution of the Church. In response, Pius issued ''[[Acerba animi]]'' on September 29, 1932.&lt;ref name="The Papacy: An Encyclopedia"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.papalencyclicals.net/Pius11/P11ANIMI.HTM|title=''Acerba animi''|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the persecution continued he issued [http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_19370328_firmissimam-constantiam_en.html Firmissimam Constantiam] and expressed his opposition to the "impious and corruptive school" (p.&amp;nbsp;22) while granting papal support for ''[[Catholic Action]]'' in Mexico for the third consecutive time with the use of [[plenary indulgence]] on March 28, 1937.&lt;ref name="FC"&gt;{{cite book |title=Firmissimam Constantiam|author=Pope Pius XI|publisher=Libreria Editrice Vaticana|year=1937|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/pius_xi/encyclicals/documents/hf_p-xi_enc_28031937_nos-es-muy-conocida_en.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Mexican Constitution of 1917 ===
{{Main|Constitution_of_Mexico#Anticlerical_articles_and_the_1934.2C_1946_and_1992_Amendments}}
The [[Political Constitution of the United Mexican States]] was drafted by the [[Constitutional Congress]] convoked by [[Venustiano Carranza]] in September 1916, and it was approved on February 5, 1917. The new constitution was based in the [[1857 Constitution of Mexico|previous one]] instituted by [[Benito Juárez]] in 1857. Three of its 136 articles—Article 3, Article 27 and Article 130—contain heavily secularizing sections, restricting the power and influence of the Roman Catholic Church.

The first two sections of [[Political Constitution of the United Mexican States#Article 3|article 3]] state: "I. According to the religious liberties established under article 24, educational services shall be secular and, therefore, free of any religious orientation. II. The educational services shall be based on scientific progress and shall fight against ignorance, ignorance's effects, servitudes, fanaticism and prejudice".&lt;ref name="constitution"&gt;{{cite book|title=The Political Constitution of the Mexican United States|author=Translation made by Carlos Perez Vazquez|publisher=Universidad Nacional Autónoma de México|year=2005|url=http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/infjur/leg/constmex/pdf/consting.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218091702/http://www.juridicas.unam.mx/infjur/leg/constmex/pdf/consting.pdf|archivedate=2015-02-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second section of [[Political Constitution of the United Mexican States#Article 27|article 27]] states that: "All religious associations organized according to article 130 and its derived legislation, shall be authorized to acquire, possess or manage just the necessary assets to achieve their objectives".&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt;

The first paragraph of [[Political Constitution of the United Mexican States#Article 130|article 130]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/286-cristero-rebellion-part-1-toward-the-abyss|title=Cristero Rebellion: part 1 - toward the abyss  : Mexico History|website=www.mexconnect.com|accessdate=9 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; states that: "The rules established at this article are guided by the historical principle according to which the State and the churches are separated entities from each other. Churches and religious congregations shall be organized under the law".

It also provided for obligatory state registration of all churches and religious congregations, and placed a series of restrictions on priests and ministers of all religions (ineligible to hold public office, to canvas on behalf of political parties or candidates, to inherit from persons other than close blood relatives, etc.).&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt; The article also allowed the state to regulate the number of priests in each region—even reducing the number to zero—and forbade the wearing of religious garb and excluded offenders from a trial by jury. Venustiano Carranza declared himself opposed to the final draft of Articles 3, 5, 24, 27, 123 and 130, but the Constitutional Congress contained only 85 conservatives and centrists close to Carranza's rather restrictive brand of "liberalism"; against them were 132 more radical delegates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico: biography of power: a history of modern Mexico, 1810–1996|author=Enrique Krauze|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1998|page=387|isbn=978-0-06-092917-6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sMIUcsUVyzsC}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico: meeting the challenge|author1=D.

[[Political Constitution of the United Mexican States#Article 24|Article 24]] states that: "Every man shall be free to choose and profess any religious belief as long as it is lawful and it cannot be punished under criminal law.

Those performed outdoors shall be regulated under the law".&lt;ref name="constitution"/&gt;

===Background to Rebellion===
{{History of Mexico |1864–1928}}
Violence on a limited scale occurred throughout the early 1920s, but never rose to the level of widespread conflict. In 1926, following passage of stringent [[anticlerical]] criminal laws and enforcement of these so-called Calles Laws (named for Mexican President Plutarco Elías Calles) coupled with peasant revolts against land reform in the heavily Catholic [[Bajio]] and clampdown on popular religious celebrations such as fiestas, scattered guerrilla operations coalesced into a serious armed revolt against the government.

Catholic and anticlerical groups turned to terrorism. Of the several uprisings against the Mexican government in the 1920s, the Cristero War was the most devastating and had the most long-range effects. The diplomatic settlement of 1929 brokered by the US Ambassador to Mexico between the Catholic Church and the Mexican government was supported by the Vatican. Although many Cristeros continued fighting, they no longer did so with the tacit support of the Church. Persecution of Catholics and anti-government terrorist attacks continued into the 1940s, when the remaining organized Cristero groups were incorporated into the Sinarquista Party.&lt;ref&gt;Chand, Vikram K., [https://books.google.com/books?id=pMIOAAAAYAAJ&amp;q ''Mexico's political awakening''], p.153, Univ. of Notre Dame Press, 2001: "In 1926, the Catholic hierarchy had responded to government persecution by suspending Mass, which was then followed by the eruption of the Cristero War…"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Leslie Bethel [https://books.google.com/books?id=9CmEcJgHqzsC&amp;dq ''Cambridge History of Latin America''], p. 593, Cambridge Univ. Press: "The Revolution had finally crushed Catholicism and driven it back inside the churches, and there it stayed, still persecuted, throughout the 1930s and beyond"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ramón Eduardo Ruiz ''Triumphs and Tragedy: A History of the Mexican People'', p. 355, W. W. Norton &amp; Company 1993: referring to the period: "With ample cause, the church saw itself as persecuted."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Grabman, ''Gorostieta and the Cristiada: Mexico's Catholic Insurgency of 1926–1929'', eBook, Editorial Mazatlán, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mexican Revolution of 1910 was originally fought against longtime autocrat [[Porfirio Díaz]] and in favor of the demand by the mass of peasantry for land. However, the late revolutionary leader Plutarco Elias Calles took radically anti-Catholic stances, despite the Church's overwhelming support from the people.&lt;ref name="Nesvig"&gt;Martin Austin Nesvig, [https://books.google.com/books?id=d1CXxGl9CNIC&amp;pg=PA229&amp;dq#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''Religious Culture in Modern Mexico''], pp. 228–29, Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; [[Francisco I. Madero]] was the first revolutionary leader. Madero was elected president in November 1911 but was overthrown and executed in 1913 by the counterrevolutionary Gen. [[Victoriano Huerta]]. When Huerta seized power after Madero's assassination, Archbishop Ruiz y Flores from Morelia published a letter condemning the coup and distanced the Church from Huerta. The National Catholic Party newspaper, representing the views of the bishops, attacked Huerta severely and, as a result, the new regime jailed the President of the NCP and halted the publication of the newspaper. Nevertheless, some members of the National Catholic Party decided to participate in Huerta's regime, such as Eduardo Tamariz.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=''The Mexican Revolution, 1910–1940'' |author=Michael J.

Carranza was the first president under the new Constitution, but he was overthrown by one-time ally [[Álvaro Obregón]] in 1919, who took over the presidency in late 1920. Obregón effectively applied the secularist laws emanating from the constitution only in areas where Catholic sentiment was weakest. This uneasy "truce" between the government and the Church ended with the 1924 hand-picked succession of an atheist, [[Plutarco Elías Calles]].&lt;ref&gt;Gonzales, Michael J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=se17aQLbKioC&amp;dq The Mexican Revolution, 1910–1940], p. 268, UNM Press, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WOBRb0wKpocC&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=%22anti+catholicism%22+in+the+1917+constitution+of+mexico&amp;source=web&amp;ots=QvOOX5u2s-&amp;sig=au3SRaN5q3RJVsn0BmYPDZYDy7Y#PPP1,M1 David A. Shirk, ''Mexico's New Politics: The PAN and Democratic Change'' p. 58 (L. Rienner Publishers 2005)]&lt;/ref&gt; Mexican [[Jacobins]], supported by Calles' central government, went beyond mere anti-clericalism and engaged in secular anti-religious campaigns to eradicate what they called "superstition" and "fanaticism", which included the desecration of religious objects as well as the persecution and murder of the clergy.&lt;ref name="Nesvig"/&gt;

Calles applied the anti-clerical laws stringently throughout the country and added his own anti-clerical legislation. In June 1926 he signed the "Law for Reforming the Penal Code", known unofficially as the "[[Calles Law]]." This provided specific penalties for priests and individuals who violated the provisions of the 1917 Constitution. For instance, wearing clerical garb in public (''i.e.'', outside Church buildings) earned a fine of 500 pesos ($250 U.S. per the historical exchange rate); a priest who criticized the government could be imprisoned for five years.&lt;ref&gt;Tuck, Jim [http://www.mexconnect.com/mex_/history/jtuck/jtcristero1.html THE CRISTERO REBELLION – PART 1] Mexico Connect 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Some states enacted oppressive measures.

{{Toryism |Related}}

===Peaceful resistance===
[[File:Boycott.jpg|thumb|left|Peaceful protesters standing against [[Plutarco Calles|President Plutarco Calles']] law forbidding public religious practices.]]

In response to these measures, Catholic organizations began to intensify their resistance. The most important of these groups was the [[National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty]], founded in 1924. This was joined by the Mexican Association of Catholic Youth (founded 1913) and the Popular Union, a Catholic political party founded in 1925.

On July 11, 1926, Catholic bishops voted to suspend all public worship in response to the Calles Law, with the suspension taking effect on August 1. On July 14 they endorsed plans for an economic boycott against the government, which was particularly effective in west-central Mexico (the states of [[Jalisco]], [[Guanajuato|Michoacan, Guanajuato]], [[Aguascalientes]] and [[Zacatecas]]). Catholics in these areas stopped attending movies and plays and using public transportation, and Catholic teachers stopped teaching in secular schools.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The bishops worked to have the offending articles of the Constitution amended. [[Pope Pius XI]] explicitly approved this plan. The Calles government considered the bishops' activism sedition and had many more churches closed. In September 1926 the episcopate submitted a proposal for the amendment of the constitution, but the [[Mexican Congress|Congress]] rejected it on September 22.{{Citation needed|date=May 2007}}

===Escalation of violence===
On August 3, in [[Guadalajara, Jalisco]], some 400 armed Catholics shut themselves in the Church of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]]. They exchanged gunfire with federal troops and surrendered when they ran out of ammunition. According to US consular sources, this battle resulted in 18 dead and 40 wounded. The following day, in [[Sahuayo]], [[Michoacán]], 240 government soldiers stormed the parish church. The priest and his vicar were killed in the ensuing violence.

On August 14 government agents staged a purge of the [[Chalchihuites]], Zacatecas, chapter of the Association of Catholic Youth and executed their spiritual adviser, Father Luis Bátiz Sainz. This execution caused a band of ranchers, led by Pedro Quintanar, to seize the local treasury and declare themselves in rebellion. At the height of their rebellion they held a region including the entire northern part of Jalisco. Luis Navarro Origel, the mayor of [[Pénjamo]], [[Guanajuato]], led another uprising on September 28. His men were defeated by federal troops in the open land around the town but retreated into the mountains, where they continued as [[guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]]. In support of the two guerrilla Apache clans, the Chavez and Trujillos helped smuggle arms, munitions and supplies from the US state of [[New Mexico]].

This was followed by a September 29 uprising in [[Durango]] led by Trinidad Mora and an October 4 rebellion in southern Guanajuato led by former Gen. Rodolfo Gallegos. Both rebel leaders adopted guerrilla tactics, as their forces were no match for federal troops. Meanwhile, rebels in Jalisco—particularly the region northeast of Guadalajara—quietly began assembling forces. Led by 27-year-old [[René Capistrán Garza]], leader of the Mexican Association of Catholic Youth, this region would become the main focal point of the rebellion.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The formal rebellion began on January 1, 1927, with a manifesto sent by Garza titled ''A la Nación'' (To the Nation). This declared that "the hour of battle has sounded" and "the hour of victory belongs to God". With the declaration the state of Jalisco, which had seemed to be quiet since the Guadalajara church uprising, exploded. Bands of rebels moving in the "[[Los Altos (Jalisco)|Los Altos]]" region northeast of Guadalajara began seizing villages, often armed with only ancient muskets and clubs. The Cristeros' battle cry was ''¡Viva Cristo Rey! ¡Viva la Virgen de Guadalupe!'' (''Long live [[Christ the King]]! Long live the Virgin of Guadalupe!''). The rebels had scarce logistical supplies and relied heavily on the Feminine Brigades of St. Joan of Arc, raids on towns, trains and ranches in order to supply themselves with money, horses, ammunition and food. By contrast, later in the war the Calles government was supplied with arms and ammunition by the US government.

The Calles government did not take the threat seriously at first. The rebels did well against the ''agraristas'' (a rural militia recruited throughout Mexico) and the Social Defense forces (local militia), but initially were always defeated by regular federal troops who guarded the important cities. At this time the federal army numbered 79,759 men. When Jalisco federal commander Gen. Jesús Ferreira moved on the rebels, he matter-of-factly wired to army headquarters that "it will be less a campaign than a hunt."&lt;ref name="books.google.com"&gt;Jim Tuck, [https://books.google.com/books?id=6UIWAAAAYAAJ&amp;q The Holy War in Los Altos: A Regional Analysis of Mexico's Cristero Rebellion], p. 55, University of Arizona Press, 1982&lt;/ref&gt; It was a sentiment that Calles also held.&lt;ref name="books.google.com"/&gt;

[[File:Cristero-leaders-and-their-banner.jpg|thumb|A photo of officers and family members from the Cristeros Castañon fighting regiment.]]

However, the rebels planned their battles fairly well, considering the fact that they had little to no previous military experience. The most successful rebel leaders were Jesús Degollado (a pharmacist); [[Victoriano Ramírez]] (a ranch hand) and two priests, [[Aristeo Pedroza|Fr. Aristeo Pedroza]] and [[José Reyes Vega|Fr. José Reyes Vega]].&lt;ref&gt;"The Anti-clerical Who Led a Catholic Rebellion", ''Latin American Studies''&lt;/ref&gt; Reyes Vega was renowned, and Cardinal Davila deemed him a "black-hearted assassin".&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies.org"&gt;Jim Tuck, [http://www.latinamericanstudies.org/mexico/gorostieta.htm The Anti-clerical Who Led a Catholic Rebellion], Latin American Studies&lt;/ref&gt; At least five priests took up arms, while many others supported them in various ways.

The Mexican episcopate never officially supported the rebellion,&lt;ref&gt;Roy P. Domenico, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z8ZixRcQfV8C&amp;dq ''Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Politics''], p. 151, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; but the rebels had some indications that their cause was legitimate. Bishop [[José Francisco Orozco y Jiménez|José Francisco Orozco]] of Guadalajara remained with the rebels; while formally rejecting armed rebellion, he was unwilling to leave his flock.

On February 23, 1927, the Cristeros defeated federal troops for the first time at [[San Francisco del Rincón]], [[Guanajuato]], followed by another victory at [[San Julián, Jalisco]]. However, they quickly began to lose in the face of superior federal forces, and retreated into remote areas, constantly fleeing federal soldiers. Most of the leadership of the revolt in the state of Jalisco was forced to flee to the US, although Victoriano Ramírez and Fr. Reyes Vega remained.

In April 1927 the leader of the civilian wing of the Cristiada, [[Anacleto González Flores]], was captured, tortured and killed. The media and government declared victory and plans were made for a re-education campaign in the areas that had rebelled. As if to prove that the rebellion was not extinguished, and to avenge the death of González Flores, Fr. Reyes Vega led a raid against a train carrying a shipment of money for the [[Bank of Mexico]] on April 19, 1927. The raid was a success, but Reyes Vega's brother was killed in the fighting.&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies.org"/&gt;

The "concentration" policy, {{Clarify|date=November 2011}} rather than suppressing the revolt, gave it new life, as thousands of men began to aid and join the rebels in resentment of the treatment of the Federation. When the rains came the peasants were allowed to return to the harvest, and there was now more support than ever for the Cristeros. By August 1927 they had consolidated their movement and were constantly attacking federal troops garrisoned in their towns. Soon they would be joined by [[Enrique Gorostieta]], a retired general hired by the [[National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty]].&lt;ref name="latinamericanstudies.org"/&gt; Although Gorostieta was himself a liberal and a skeptic, he would eventually wear a cross around his neck and speak openly of his reliance on God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.laits.utexas.edu/jaime/cwp5/crg/english/gorostieta/|title=University of Texas|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On June 21, 1927, the first Women's Brigade was formed in [[Zapopan]]. The brigade began with 16 women and one man, but after a few days grew to 135 members and soon after, they came to number 17,000. Its mission was to obtain money, weapons, provisions and information for the combatant men while also caring for the wounded. By March 1928 some 10,000 women were involved in the struggle, with many smuggling weapons into combat zones by carrying them in carts filled with grain or cement. By the end of the war they numbered some 25,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Meyer|first1=Jean A.|title=The Cristero Rebellion: The Mexican People between Church and State, 1926–1929|date=1976|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=9780521210317|pages=132, 133, 136}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With close ties to the Catholic Church and clergy, the De La Torre family was instrumental in bringing the Cristero Movement to northern Mexico. The family, originally from Zacatecas and Guanajuato, moved to Aguascalientes and then in 1922 to San Luis Potosí. They moved again to Tampico for economic reasons and finally to Nogales—both the Mexican city and its similarly named sister city across the border in Arizona—to escape persecution from authorities because of their involvement in the Church and the movement [http://www.azarchivesonline.org/xtf/view?docId=ead/uoa/UAMS420.xml&amp;doc.view=content&amp;brand=default&amp;anchor.id=0]

The Cristeros maintained the upper hand throughout 1928, and in 1929 the federal government faced a new crisis: a revolt within army ranks led by Arnulfo R. Gómez in [[Veracruz]]. The Cristeros tried to take advantage of this with an attack on Guadalajara in late March 1929. It failed, but the rebels did manage to take [[Tepatitlán de Morelos|Tepatitlán]] on April 19; however, Fr. Vega was killed. The military rebellion was met with equal force and the Cristeros were soon facing divisions within their own ranks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kourf|first1=Professor|title=U.S. Reaction Towards the Cristero Rebellion|date=November 27, 2002|publisher=Dalageorgas, Kosta|url=https://www.academia.edu/3548280/U.S._Reaction_Towards_the_Cristero_Rebellion}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On June 2 Gorostieta was killed in an ambush by a federal patrol.

===Diplomacy and the uprising===
[[File:A la batalla (Cristeros).jpg|thumb|right|Armed Cristeros congregating in the streets of Mexico.]]
In October 1927 US ambassador to Mexico [[Dwight Whitney Morrow]] initiated a series of breakfast meetings with President Calles at which the two would discuss a range of issues, from the religious uprising to oil and irrigation. This earned him the nickname "the ham and eggs diplomat" in US papers. Morrow wanted the conflict to end both for regional security and to help find a solution to the oil problem in the US. He was aided in his efforts by [[John J. Burke|Fr. John J. Burke]] of the [[National Catholic Welfare Conference]]. Calles' term as president was coming to an end—former president [[Álvaro Obregón]] had been elected president and was scheduled to take office on December 1, 1928. Though Obregon had been more lenient to Catholics during his time in office, it was also generally accepted among Mexicans, including the Cristeros, that Calles was his [[puppet leader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico: Biography of Power: A History of Modern Mexico, 1810–1996|author=Enrique Krauze|location=New York|publisher=HarperCollins|year=1997|isbn=978-0-06-016325-9 |page=399}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two weeks after his election Obregón was assassinated by a Catholic radical, [[José de León Toral]], an event that gravely damaged the peace process.

In September 1928 Congress named [[Emilio Portes Gil]] as interim president, with a special election to be held in November 1929. Portes was more open to the Church than Calles had been, allowing Morrow and Burke to re-initiate the peace initiative. Portes told a foreign correspondent on May 1, 1929, that "the Catholic clergy, when they wish, may renew the exercise of their rites with only one obligation, that they respect the laws of the land". The next day exiled Archbishop Leopoldo Ruíz y Flores issued a statement that the bishops would not demand the repeal of the laws, only their more lenient application.

Morrow managed to bring the parties to agreement on June 21, 1929. His office drafted a pact called the ''arreglos'' (agreement) that allowed worship to resume in Mexico and granted three concessions to the Catholics: only priests who were named by hierarchical superiors would be required to register, religious instruction in the churches (but not in the schools) would be permitted, and all citizens, including the clergy, would be allowed to make petitions to reform the laws. However, the most important part of the agreement was that the church would recover the right to use its properties, and priests recovered their rights to live on such property. Legally speaking, the Church was not allowed to own real estate, and its former facilities remained federal property. However, the church effectively took control over the properties. It was a convenient arrangement for both parties, and the church ostensibly ended its support for the rebels.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

Over the previous two years, anticlerical officers who were hostile to the federal government for reasons other than its position on religion had joined the rebels. When the agreement between the government and the church was made known, only a minority of the rebels went home, mainly those who felt their battle had been won. On the other hand, since the rebels themselves were not consulted in the talks, many felt betrayed and some continued to fight. The church threatened those rebels with excommunication, and gradually the rebellion died out. The officers, fearing that they would be tried as traitors, tried to keep the rebellion alive. This attempt failed and many were captured and shot, while others escaped to [[San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí|San Luis Potosí]] where Gen. Saturnino Cedillo gave them refuge.{{Citation needed|date=November 2011}}

On June 27, 1929, church bells rang in Mexico for the first time in almost three years. The war had claimed the lives of some 90,000 people: 56,882 on the federal side, 30,000 Cristeros, and numerous civilians and Cristeros who were killed in anti-clerical raids after the war ended.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}} As promised by Portes Gil, the Calles Law remained on the books, but no organized federal attempts to enforce it took place. Nonetheless, in several localities, officials continued persecution of Catholic priests based on their interpretation of the law.

In 1992 the [https://www.state.gov/g/drl/rls/irf/2003/24499.htm Mexican government] amended the constitution by granting all religious groups legal status, conceding them limited property rights and lifting restrictions on the number of priests in the country.

===United States involvement===

====Knights of Columbus involvement====
Both US councils and mostly newly formed Mexican councils of the [[Knights of Columbus]] opposed the persecution by the Mexican government. To date, nine of those beatified or canonized were Knights. The American Knights collected more than $1 million to assist exiles from Mexico, to continue the education of expelled seminarians and to inform citizens of the US about oppression.&lt;ref name="Catholic World Report"&gt;[http://www.catholicworldreport.com/Item/1396/the_story_martyrs_and_lessons_of_the_cristero_war.aspx The Story, Martyrs, and Lessons of the Cristero War: An interview with Ruben Quezada about the Cristiada and the bloody Cristero War (1926–1929)], Catholic World Report, June 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; They circulated five million leaflets educating the US about the war, held hundreds of lectures and spread the news via radio.&lt;ref name="Catholic World Report"/&gt; In addition to fostering an informed public the Knights met with President [[Calvin Coolidge]] to press for intervention.&lt;ref&gt;Don M. Coerver, [http://www.politicalreviewnet.com/polrev/reviews/DIPH/R_0145_2096_315_1007444.asp Book Review: Church, State, and Civil War in Revolutionary Mexico], Volume 31, Issue 03, Pages 575–578, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Supreme Knight]] of the Knights of Columbus [[Carl A. Anderson]], two-thirds of Mexican Catholic councils were shut down by the Mexican government at the time. In response, the Knights of Columbus published posters and magazines presenting Cristero soldiers in a positive light.&lt;ref&gt;Interview. For Greater Glory Film documentary. May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Ku Klux Klan involvement====
High-ranking members of the racist and anti-Catholic US organization the [[Ku Klux Klan]] in the mid-1920s offered President Calles $10,000 to help fight the Catholic Church. The offer came when the [[Knights of Columbus]] in the US secretly offered a group of Cristero rebels $1,000 of financial assistance for guns and ammunition. This was made after the fact that Calles also sent a private telegram to the Mexican Ambassador to France, Alberto José Pani Arteaga, advising that the Catholic Church in Mexico is a political movement, and must be eliminated in order to proceed with a Socialist government free of religious hypnotism which fools the people . . . within one year without the sacraments, the people will forget the faith . . ."&lt;ref&gt;[[Jean Meyer]], ''La Cristiada: A Mexican People's War for Religious Liberty'', {{ISBN|978-0-7570-0315-8}}.

==Aftermath of the war and toll on the Church==
The government in many cases did not abide by the terms of the truce and, in violation of its terms, executed some 500 Cristero leaders and 5,000 other Cristeros.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"&gt;Van Hove, Brian [http://www.ewtn.com/library/HOMELIBR/FR94204.TXT Blood-Drenched Altars] Faith &amp; Reason 1994&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly offensive to Catholics after the supposed truce was Calles' insistence on a complete state monopoly on education, suppressing all Catholic education and introducing secular education in its place: "We must enter and take possession of the mind of childhood, the mind of youth."&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"/&gt; Calles' military persecution of Catholics would be officially condemned by President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] and the Mexican Congress in 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,788523-1,00.html|title=MEXICO: Ossy, Ossy, Boneheads|date=4 February 1935|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2017|via=www.time.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1935–36 Cárdenas had Calles and many of his close associates arrested and forced them into exile soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,755388,00.html|title=MEXICO: Cardenas v.

Government disregard for the church, however, did not relent until 1940, when President [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]], a practicing Catholic, took office.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"/&gt; Church buildings in the country still belonged to the Mexican government&lt;ref name=hjoqac /&gt; and the nation's policies regarding the church still fell into federal jurisdiction.

The effects of the war on the Church were profound. Between 1926–34 at least 40 priests were killed.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"/&gt; There were 4,500 priests serving the people before the rebellion, but by 1934 there were only 334 licensed by the government to serve 15 million people.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodges, Donald Clark, [https://books.google.com/books?id=7prW3gXbFRgC&amp;dq Mexico, the end of the revolution], p. 50, Greenwood Publishing Group, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; The rest had been eliminated by emigration, expulsion and assassination.&lt;ref name="Blood-Drenched Altars"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scheina, Robert L.

The end of the Cristero War affected emigration to the US. "In the aftermath of their defeat, many of the Cristeros—by some estimates as much as 5 percent of Mexico's population—fled to America [i.e. the United States]. Many of them made their way to Los Angeles, where they found a protector in [[John Joseph Cantwell]], the bishop of what was then the Los Angeles-San Diego diocese."&lt;ref&gt;Rieff, David; "Nuevo Catholics"; ''The New York Times Magazine''; December 24, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Under Archbishop Cantwell's sponsorship the Cristero refugees became a substantial community in [[Los Angeles, California]], in 1934 staging a parade some 40,000 strong through the city.&lt;ref&gt;Rieff, David ''Los Angeles: Capital of the Third World'' London 1992 p.164 {{ISBN|978-0-224-03304-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present day==
The Mexican constitution prohibits outdoor worship, which is only allowed in exceptional circumstances, generally requiring governmental permission. Religious organizations are not permitted to own print or electronic media outlets, governmental permission is required to broadcast religious ceremonies, and ministers are prohibited from being political candidates or holding public office.&lt;ref name="Soberanes Fernandez pp. 437-443"&gt;Soberanes Fernandez, José Luis, [http://lawreview.byu.edu/archives/2002/2/Sob12.pdf Mexico and the 1981 United Nations Declaration on the Elimination of All Forms of Intolerance and of Discrimination Based on Religion or Belief], pp. 437–438 nn. 7–8, ''BYU Law Review'', June 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Despite remnants of anti-clerical statutes, there is no real enforcement of them, and the Catholic Church enjoys liberties from the Government, as well as devotion from the people.{{Dubious|date=November 2011}}

===Cristero War saints===
{{Main|Saints of the Cristero War}}
The Catholic Church has recognized several of those killed in the Cristero rebellion as [[martyr]]s, including the [[beatification|Blessed]] [[Miguel Pro]] ([[Jesuits|SJ]]), who was shot dead without trial by a firing squad on November 23, 1927, on trumped-up charges of involvement in an assassination attempt against former President [[Álvaro Obregón]] but in actuality for his priestly activities in defiance of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Bethell, Leslie, [https://books.google.com/books?id=9CmEcJgHqzsC&amp;dq The Cambridge History of Latin America], p. 593, Cambridge University Press, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Anne Commire|Commire, Anne]].

On May 21, 2000, [[Pope Saint John Paul II]] canonized a group of 25 martyrs from this period.&lt;ref name="homily-JPII"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20000521_canonizations_en.html|title="Homily of Pope John Paul II: Canonization of 27 New Saints".

''Guadalajara Reporter''. May 12, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; They had been beatified on November 22, 1992. Of this group, 22 were [[secular clergy]] and three were laymen.&lt;ref name="homily-JPII"/&gt; They did not take up arms&lt;ref name="gerzon"/&gt; but refused to leave their flocks and ministries, being shot or hanged by government forces for offering the [[sacraments]].&lt;ref name="gerzon"/&gt; Most were executed by federal forces. Although [[Peter of Jesus Maldonado|Peter de Jesus Maldonado]] was killed in 1937, after the war ended, he is considered a Cristero and a member of this group [http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_academies/cult-martyrum/martiri/013.html][http://www.vatican.va/news_services/liturgy/saints/ns_lit_doc_20000521_maldonado-lucero_sp.html][http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/homilies/documents/hf_jp-ii_hom_20000521_canonizations_en.html].

Fr. Luis Bátiz Sainz was the parish priest in Chalchihuites and a member of the Knights of Columbus. He was known for his devotion to the [[Eucharist]] and for his prayer for martyrdom: ''"Lord, I want to be a martyr; even though I am your unworthy servant, I want to pour out my blood, drop by drop, for your name."'' In 1926, shortly before the closing of the churches, he was denounced as a conspirator against the government because of his connections with the National League for the Defense of Religious Liberty, which was preparing an armed uprising. A squad of soldiers raided the private house where he was staying on August 14, 1926, and took him captive. They executed him, reportedly without benefit of a trial, along with three youths of the Mexican Association of Catholic Youth.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The Catholic Church declared 13 additional victims of the anti-Catholic regime as martyrs on November 20, 2005, thus paving the way for their beatifications.&lt;ref name="catholicnewsagency.com"&gt;[http://www.catholicnewsagency.com/new.php?n=5327 "14-year-old Mexican martyr to be beatified Sunday"]; ''Catholic News Agency''; November 5, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; This group was mostly lay people including 14-year-old [[José Sánchez del Río]]. On November 20, 2005, at Jalisco Stadium in Guadalajara, [[José Saraiva Martins|José Saraiva Cardinal Martins]] celebrated the beatifications.&lt;ref name="catholicnewsagency.com"/&gt;

=="Battle Hymn of the Cristeros"==
[[File:FlagCristeroCenter.jpg|thumb|A banner from a group of Cristero supporters at the Centro de Estudios Cristeros in [[Encarnación de Díaz]], [[Jalisco]].]]
Juan Gutiérrez, a surviving Cristero, penned the Cristeros hymn, "Battle Hymn of the Cristeros", which is based on the music of the Spanish-language song, "[[Marcha Real]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qrFK9nzgAB8|title=Juan Guitierrez "Original Cristero Soldier"|first=|last=Marc Kropfl|date=30 October 2006|publisher=|accessdate=9 September 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Spanish
:La Virgen María es nuestra protectora y nuestra defensora cuando hay que temer
:Vencerá a todo el demonio gritando "¡Viva Cristo Rey!" (x2)
:Soldados de Cristo: ¡Sigamos la bandera, que la cruz enseña el ejército de Dios!
:Sigamos la bandera gritando, "¡Viva Cristo Rey!"

;English translation
:The Virgin Mary is our protector and defender when there is to fear
:She will vanquish all demons at the cry of "Long live Christ the King!" (x2)
:Soldiers of Christ: Let's follow the flag, for the cross points to the army of God!
:Let's follow the flag at the cry of "Long live Christ the King!"

==Other views==
French historian and researcher [[Jean Meyer]] argues that the Cristero soldiers were western peasants who tried to resist the heavy pressures of the modern bourgeois state and its Revolution, of the city elites, and of the rich, all of whom wanted to suppress the Catholic faith.&lt;ref&gt;Meyer cited in Donald J. Mabry, "Mexican Anticlerics, Bishops, Cristeros, and the Devout during the 1920s: A Scholarly Debate", ''Journal of Church and State'' (1978) 20#1 pp 81–92&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
"[[El martes me fusilan]]" is a song by [[Vicente Fernandez]] about a fictional Cristero's execution. https://www.letras.com/vicente-fernandez/1300723/

[[Juan Rulfo]]'s famous novel ''[[Pedro Páramo]]'' is set during the Cristero War in the western Mexico city of [[Comala]].

[[Graham Greene]]'s novel ''[[The Power and the Glory]]'' is set during this period.

[[For Greater Glory]] is based on the events of the Cristero War.

[[Malcolm Lowry]]'s novel ''[[Under the Volcano]]'' is also set during this period. In Lowry's novel, the Cristeros appear as a reactionary group with fascist sympathies, which contrasts with their portrayal in other novels.

There is a long section of [[B. Traven]]'s novel ''[[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre]]'' devoted to the history of what Traven refers to as "the Christian Bandits". However, in the [[The Treasure of the Sierra Madre (film)|classic film made from the novel]], no mention is made of the Cristeros, although the novel takes place in the same time period as the rebellion.

Many fact-based films, shorts and documentaries about the war have been produced since 1929.&lt;ref&gt;Jean Meyer, Ulises Íñiguez Mendoza (2007).

'''Ernest Lindgren''' (3 October 1910 &amp;ndash; 22 July 1973) was a British film [[archivist]] and writer.

==Career==
Lindgren joined the [[British Film Institute]] in February 1934 as Information Officer, and became the first [[curator]] of the National Film Library in 1935, renamed the [[BFI National Archive|National Film Archive]] in 1955. He remained curator until his death in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;Luke McKernan, ‘Lindgren, Ernest Henry (1910–1973)’, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004 [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/65530, accessed 19 March 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; He was succeeded by [[David Francis (film archivist)|David Francis]].

Lindgren's approach to the preservation of film materials is often contrasted with that of [[Henri Langlois]], the founder of the [[Cinémathèque Française]]; the scientific against the romantic.&lt;ref name="Smither"&gt;Roger Smither "Henri Langlois and Nitrate, Before and After 1959" in Smither (ed) ''This Film is Dangerous: A Celebration of Nitrate Film'', Brussels: FIAF, 2002, p.247-55&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Langlois, Lindgren adopted a selective approach in opposition to accumulating every possible film. Along with Langlois though, Lindgren played a major role in the development of FIAF, the [[International Federation of Film Archives]]. It is argued that the NFA gained a reputation for being uncooperative in this period, and Lindgren reportedly applied the Alizarin Red test (a disputed means of checking for the extent of nitrate decomposition) to films which were on loan from other institutions. Langlois in contrast had an eccentric, or non-existent, approach to record keeping, and the Cinémathèque suffered a nitrate fire on 10 July 1959.&lt;ref name="Smither"/&gt;

Lindgren's approach, on the other hand, meant that no account of changes in fashion could be made. When the BFI published ''Missing Believed Lost'' (1992), and launched an accompanying campaign, it was forced to admit that some of the featured titles, all made during the [[Nitrocellulose#Nitrate film|nitrate]] era, had previously been rejected as possible acquisitions.

''The Art of the Film: An Introduction to Film Appreciation'', first published in 1948, went through several editions during Lindgren's lifetime. ''A Picture History of the Cinema'' appeared in 1960.

[[Image:Fat, An Appreciation of a Misunderstood Ingredient, with Recipes cover.jpg|thumb|right|Book cover]]
'''''Fat: An Appreciation of a Misunderstood Ingredient, with Recipes''''' is a [[cookbook]] written by Canadian author [[Jennifer McLagan]]. In ''Fat'', McLagan discusses the history of the shift from diets that were high in [[animal fat]] to low-fat foods, which has not resulted in an appreciable increase in overall health.  The trend to lower fat foods is a result of studies conducted in the 1940s, which McLagan disputes.  Included in ''Fat'' are instructions for fat [[Rendering (animals)|rendering]], recipes for its use, and a description of the health benefits of eating animal fat.

In 2009 the book received the [[James Beard Foundation Award]] and the [[International Association of Culinary Professionals|IACP]] Cookbook Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jennifermclagan.com/book_fat.htm |title=FAT: An Appreciation of a Misunderstood Ingredient, with Recipes |publisher=Jennifermclagan.com |accessdate=19 March 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120119132100/http://www.jennifermclagan.com/book_fat.htm |archivedate=19 January 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
McLagen was raised in Australia in the 1960s, prior to the North American and United Kingdom diets moving towards [[low-fat diet|low fat]]. In the 1970s, she moved to Europe, where fat was not being removed as a common part of the diet.&lt;ref name=independant&gt;{{cite news|last=Morris|first=Sophie|title=Fat is back: Rediscover the delights of lard, dripping and suet|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/food-and-drink/features/fat-is-back-rediscover-the-delights-of-lard-dripping-and-suet-1642912.html|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=The Independent|date=12 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1970s saw American diets adopting lower amounts of [[animal fat]] (though without an improvement in overall health), resulting in an increased intake of overall fat, with vegetable fats substituted for animal fats, leading to higher [[polyunsaturated fat]] levels in the diet.&lt;ref name=salon&gt;{{cite news|last=Bhide|first=Monica|title=Why you should eat fat|url=http://www.salon.com/2008/09/25/jennifer_mclagan/|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=Salon|date=25 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLagan's explanation for the belief that fat is unhealthy comes from [[Ancel Keys]]'s studies in the 1940s, which linked animal fat to heart disease—studies which have since been challenged by other studies which do not link the two.  McLangan states the studies were faulty, citing the "[[French paradox]]," according to which cultures with a high-fat diet have low rates of heart disease.&lt;ref name=CBC&gt;{{cite news|last=Smith|first=Shaun|title=Jenifer McLagan on her controversial book, Fat|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/health/story/2008/09/15/f-mclagan-fat.html|accessdate=12 March 2012|newspaper=CBC|date=15 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
McLagen discusses the misconception that people have about [[fat]] as a "greasy killer" and describes the shift to a low-fat diet, citing two studies that show that obesity may not be connected to heart attacks, and pointing to the [[Atkins diet]]. There are sections dedicated to butter and to types of fat from different animals, with instructions on how to [[Rendering (animals)|render]] it, store it, and cook with it. Recipes for dishes with animal fat as an ingredient are included as well.&lt;ref name=salon /&gt; McLagen's book also covers the health benefits of animal fat, such as its energy content, helping the [[immune system]], reducing bad [[cholesterol]] and aiding in digestion of protein and [[lipophilicity|fat-soluble]] vitamins.&lt;ref name=independant/&gt;&lt;ref name=salon/&gt;  McLagen contends that animal fat is not unhealthy and tastes good, but that it has gotten a bad reputation and thus consumers have become afraid of eating it—if they stopped being afraid, they would enjoy it.&lt;ref name=CBC /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2307">The '''Hessian Bibliography''' ({{lang-de|Hessische Bibliographie}}) is a German regional bibliography. Its aim is to completely capture all the literature connected with the geography, history and culture of the German federal state of [[Hesse]] from the year 1974. It is based on the holdings of the [[legal deposit|copyright libraries]] at [[Kassel University Library|Kassel]], [[Fulda]], [[Frankfurt University Library|Frankfurt]], [[Hessian State Library|Wiesbaden]] and [[Hessian State Library|Darmstadt]].

By 2000 a total of 24 indexed year books had appeared in print; since then it has only been available in electronic form as a freely accessible database of the Hessian library information system ([[HEBIS]]). The titles are recorded in accordance with the Rules for Alphabetic Cataloguing and accessed using a comprehensive system of about 1,200 system sites and keywords. About 6,500 bibliographic records are added per year. 

The Hessian bibliography is part of the [[Virtual German National Bibliography]], which has its own web portal.

For the period before 1974, the "Literature on the History and Historic Geograph and Culture of Hesse"&lt;ref&gt;Karl E. Demandt, Winfried Leist, Wolfgang Podehl (Bearb.): ''Schrifttum zur Geschichte und geschichtlichen Landeskunde von Hessen.'' Marburg/Wiesbaden 1965–1984. ([http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=1.1/SET=5/TTL=1/CLK?IKT=12&amp;TRM=011043458 Titelnachweis]).&lt;/ref&gt; is used. This consists of seven printed volumes by Karl Ernst Demandt (covering the period to 1964) and by Winfried Leist and Wolfgang Podehl (covering the period 1965-1976). Currently, the volumes of Podehl and Leist are gradually being added retrospectively to the database.

'''The Heywood Manuscript''' is a collection of handwritten copies of letters and poems of the Heywood family, and letters from their relatives and friends, which was completed in 1798, and to which some explanatory passages have been added. Most of the letters and poems are by Nessy and [[Peter Heywood]], and it may be that the transcription and reproduction of their correspondence and poetry was instigated by Peter as a lasting monument to his sister Nessy, who died so young, and who had devoted herself with indefatigatible energy to him and his release when he was imprisoned on HMS Hector and awaiting his court-martial in connection with the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]].

There are five known versions of the manuscript, which were produced for members of the Heywood family. Two are privately owned, the other three are in libraries:

* [[Manx National Heritage Library]], Heywood Manuscript [Acc No. 9519/1/1-186]
* [[Newberry Library]], Chicago, Nessy Heywood, Correspondence 1790-92 [Case MS E 5 .H 5078]
* [[State Library of New South Wales]], Mary Heywood, Letterbook [Microfilm : CY 2809].

The Manx National Heritage copy consists of a preface page with the name of the owner – E C Fleetwood, whose wife Elizabeth (Bessy) was Nessy’s niece – and several unbound small books and additional loose leaves which are numbered from 1 to 397, and which include a total of 184 different documents. Some pages are missing, and the last 110 pages are blank. One poem stems from 1786, others have no date. Most of the documents are dated between 1790 and 1793 and deal with Peter’s alleged participation in the [[Mutiny on the Bounty]] and the court proceedings against the mutineers. In the early 20th century the manuscript was in the possession of Mr A. R. Allinson, a relation of the Heywoods. In the 1920s it was sold to a private collector in London. Manx National Heritage obtained the Heywood-Manuscript as well as letters and poems by Peter Heywood and returned them to the Isle of Man, when Bonhams in London auctioned off letters and manuscripts by members of the Bounty expedition in 1996.

In the library catalogue of the New South Wales State Library there is mention that the manuscript was possibly produced by Nessy’s older sister, Mary Heywood. It is assumed that the inscription Mary Heywood on the first page is Mary’s handwriting. A second inscription Aunt to Bessie Fleetwood Castle Lawn Douglas seems to indicate that Mary left the manuscript to her niece Elizabeth (Bessy) Fleetwood. Bessy was the daughter of Mary’s and Nessy’s youngest brother Edwin Holwell.

ICPC-2 PLUS takes into account the frequency distribution of problems seen in [[health care#Primary care|primary health care]]. It allows for the classification of the patient’s [[reason for encounter]] (RFE), the problems/diagnosis managed, primary care interventions, and the ordering of the data of the primary care session in an episode of care structure.

ICPC-2 PLUS provides a list of possible terms matching a keyword (or start of a keyword) entered by the user. The user then selects the most appropriate term. Each term is already classified to ICPC-2 rubrics and a system of additional groupers that may include terms from multiple ICPC-2 rubrics.

Each term has one or more keywords linked to it which may include abbreviations, synonyms, generics or specifics. The keyword searching is thus much broader, faster and better controlled than text mining of free text and labels. Instead of guessing what the [[physician]] meant by a term (in free text) prior to classification, the physician is actually prompted with a small list of terms to select from which are already classified.

The product also includes a "natural language" label for each term which can be used for reports and letters.

'''Note:''' The PLUS extension mentioned here is not part of the ICPC-2 standard. The [[World Organization of Family Doctors]] (WONCA) and the [[WONCA International Classification Committee]] (WICC) have no control over it although they do have control over the ICPC classification which the PLUS extension makes use of. It is similar to the difference between a car and fuel.

==History==
ICPC-2 PLUS was the successor to 'ICPC PLUS' and were both designed by the Family Medicine Research Centre(FMRC) for use in Australia. ICPC 2 PLUS responsibility was transferred to the NCCH (&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sydney.edu.au/health-sciences/ncch/|title=National Centre for Classification in Health - The University of Sydney|website=sydney.edu.au|access-date=2017-01-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in July 2016 which continues to update and support ICPC-2 PLUS.

ICPC is being developed by the [[WONCA International Classification Committee]] (WICC), and the first version was published as [[International Classification of Primary Care|ICPC-1]] in 1987 by [[Oxford University Press]] (OUP), and a revision and inclusion of criteria and definitions, was published in 1998 as ''ICPC-2''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27193">'''Interracial adoption ''' (also referred to as '''transracial adoption''') refers to the act of placing a child of one racial or ethnic group with adoptive parents of another racial or ethnic group.

Interracial adoption is not the same as transcultural or [[international adoption]] though in some circumstances an adoption may be interracial, international, and transcultural.

==Statistics==
Based on the Adoption and Foster Care Analysis and Reporting System (AFCARS) in the U.S., the [[fiscal year]] of 1998 showed that approximately 64% of children waiting in [[foster care]] were of non-Caucasian background; 32% were white. Out of all foster children waiting for adoption 51% are black, 11% are Hispanic, 1% are American Indian, 1% are Asian/Pacific Islander, and 5% are unknown/unable to determine. Data from the 1995 [[National Survey of Family Growth]] (NSFG) in the U.S. show that adoption of an unrelated child was most common among childless white women and those with higher levels of income and education. The most recent estimate of interracial adoption was performed in 1987 by the [[National Health Interview Survey]] (NHIS) and it found that 1% of white women adopt black children, 5% of white women adopt children of other races, and 2% of women of other races adopt white children (estimates include foreign-born).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://naic.acf.hhs.gov/pubs/s_seek.cfm|title=Persons Seeking to Adopt|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031205082532/http://naic.acf.hhs.gov/pubs/s_seek.cfm|archivedate=December 5, 2003|publisher=National Adoption Information Clearinghouse}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US Census 2000 found that "White (and no other race), not Hispanic children made up the majority of all categories of children of householders under 18: about 58 percent of adopted children, 64 percent of biological children" and "Of the 1.7 million households with adopted children, about 308,000 (18 percent) contained members of different races."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/prod/2003pubs/censr-6.pdf|title=Adopted Children and Stepchildren: 2000|date=October 2003|publisher=census.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 2008 and 2009, approximately 2,700 white children were adopted compared to only 410 mixed-race children and only 90 black children in the UK. Approximately 1 in 10 children in care is black and 1 in 9 children in care comes from a racially mixed background. Black, mixed-race and Asian children typically wait to be adopted on average three years longer than white children. Children of mixed ethnicities are more likely than other children to be placed for adoption. The [[Children Act 1989]] and [[Adoption and Children Act 2002]] state that in England and Wales an adoption agency must give due consideration to a child's religious persuasion, racial origin and cultural and linguistic background; this requirement was repealed for England in the [[Children and Families Act 2014]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2014/6/section/3/enacted|title=Children and Families Act 2014|website=Legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adoption placement of children of mixed ethnicities is difficult because it is influenced by values, ideology and anti-oppressive practices that need to be considered within the practice. Mixed ethnicity children are subject to racism and complete inclusion of both parts of their heritage. Mixed children will struggle with discrimination from both parts of their ethnicity, desiring solidarity from both parts of their ethnic backgrounds.&lt;ref name=ebscohost&gt;[http://web.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?sid=d932bcba-8f78-4f28-a416-befb917bd106@sessionmgr112&amp;vid=7&amp;hid=123] {{dead link|date=May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statistics==
Interracial adoption grew significantly from 1999 to 2005 where it reached its peak year at 585 adoptions to the United States. Following 2005, interracial adoption into the US declined with 288 adoptions in the year 2011. From 1999 to 2011, there has been 233,934 adoptions into the United States from other countries across the globe. Of the total adoptions, 39.4% (92,202 children) were under the age of 12 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Intercountry Adoption|url=http://adoption.state.gov/about_us/statistics.php|work=Bureau of Consular Affairs|publisher=U.S. Department of State}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, 63% (146,516 children) were female. Overall, children from China were the most common to be adopted. 66,630 were from China and Russia was the second largest country with 45,112 children.

==History==
Before World War II it was very rare for white couples to adopt a child of a different race and every effort was made in order to match a child with the skin color and religion of the adoptive family. Then in 1944 the Boys and Girls Aid Society took an interest in the increasing number of minority children waiting to be adopted which focused on children from [[Asian American]], [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]], and [[African American]] [[biological inheritance|heritage]]. Children of Asian and Native American heritage were most easily placed outside of their racial group while those of African Americans heritage proved more difficult. The campaign was called "Operation Brown Baby" and its objective was to find adoptive homes even if from a different race, the first candidate in this operation, Noah Turner, was a Chinese baby adopted into a Caucasian family in 1947. Then during the civil rights movement, interracial adoptions in the United States increased dramatically and the numbers more than tripled from 733 cases in 1968 to 2,574 cases in 1971. (There are now about 6,500 cases a year.) It was then that the National Association of Black Social Workers condemned interracial adoption citing that adoptees were at risk for developing a poor racial identity due to lack of contact with [[role model]]s of the same race. In the 1990s the placement of black children into non-black homes virtually came to a complete stop.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

==Additional information==
Families formed across racial, national, and biological boundaries represent a growing demographic, adding to the pervasive, historical diversity of family forms in the United States (Coontz, 2008). Since 1990, the number of U.S. adoptions of foreign-born orphans has increased in unprecedented numbers, rising from 7,093 children to 12,753 in 2009—an 80% increase: China ranked as the top sending country, and Vietnam ranked as the seventh highest (U.S. Department of State, 2009). Whereas diversification in the family form is not a new phenomenon, it often appears so, given that family communication scholarship on nontraditional families is a relatively recent development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Coontz, S.|date=2008|title=American families: A multicultural reader|location=New York|publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=

==Law==
In 1994 the [[Multi-Ethnic Placement Act|Howard M. Metzenbaum Multiethnic Placement Act]] (MEPA) was passed. It prohibits an agency that receives Federal assistance and is involved in foster care and adoptive placements from delaying or denying the placement of a child based on race, color, or national origin of the child or adoptive/[[foster parent]]. Then, in 1996 it was amended with the ''Interethnic Adoption Provisions'', also known as the [[Interethnic Placement Act]]. These provisions forbid agencies from delaying or denying the placement of a child ''solely'' on the basis of race and national origin. The purpose of these revisions was to strengthen compliance and enforcement of the procedures, remove any misleading language, and demand that [[discrimination]] would not be tolerated.

Another important law regarding interracial adoptions was the [[Adoption and Safe Families Act]] that was implemented in 1997. The purpose of this law is to reduce the time that a child spends in foster care by implementing a two-year limit and therefore hopefully moving a child closer to permanent adoption. The purpose of this act was to reduce the instability and abuse problems in the foster care system. Critics argue that it also takes the emphasis off of trying to keep children with their biological parents.

==Academic research==
{{Unreferenced section|date=March 2008}}

===Adolescent adjustment===
One study found that interracial adoptees fare sometimes better, sometimes worse, but overall about the same as their same-race adopted counterparts across the 12 adjustment measures investigated. These measures investigated indices of academic, familial, psychological, and health outcomes for 4 groups of interracial and same-race adopted adolescents. Specifically, interracial adoptees had significantly higher grades and significantly higher academic expectations but marginally more distant father relationships and higher levels of psychosomatic symptoms than their same-race adopted counterparts. Also, Asian adolescents adopted by white parents had both the highest grades and the highest levels of psychosomatic symptoms, whereas black adolescents adopted by black parents reported the highest levels of [[clinical depression|depression]]. On the other hand, black adoptees reported higher levels of self-worth than non-black adoptees.

===Appearance discomfort===
Another report suggested that adjustment problems among their children at approximately the same levels as were reported by the parents of intraracially adopted whites. Yet, evidence also showed that extra-family forces, for example societal racism, did negatively impact adjustment outcomes. Particularly, experiences of discrimination generated feelings of appearance discomfort. The research suggested that black and Asian children, who appear unmistakably different from whites, are most likely to encounter such societal discrimination. Apparently, many Latino children with European physical features can safely escape such expressions of [[racism]]. One of this study's most interesting findings showed that interracial adoptive parents' decisions on where to live had a substantial impact upon their children's adjustments. Interracial adoptive parents living in predominantly white communities tended to have adoptees that experienced more discomfort about their appearance than those who lived in integrated settings.

===Identity development ===
Transracial adoptees are posed with the challenge of understanding the differences between their own view of identity and the identity reflected and modeled by their parents. Identity entails, not only race, but also heritage, culture, ethnicity and many other descriptors. Studies have sought to explore how children of interracial adoption are affected in these varying categories in an effort to counter the argument that transracial adoptions can have confusing and conflicting effects on a child's view of self-identity. Research suggests that the age of adoption and parenting acculturation styles may influence the way in which transracial children construct and build their own identities.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wickes|first=Kevin L.|last2=Slate|first2=John R.|date=1996-06-01|title=Transracial adoption of Koreans: A preliminary study of adjustment|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00114788|journal=International Journal for the Advancement of Counselling|language=en|volume=19|issue=2|pages=187–195|doi=10.1007/bf00114788|issn=0165-0653}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many groups continue to argue that children put up for adoption should be matched with same race parents in an effort to better help the child assimilate culturally and racially. This idea is commonly known as race-matching, when the adoptee and adoptive parents are paired based on race. In 2008, the Evan B. Donaldson Adoption Institute reignited the interracial adoption debate with its recommendation that race should be considered in selecting adoptive parents for children awaiting placement. These reports examined adoption of black children by white parents. They found that interracial adoptees face additional and complex challenges coping with being "different", particularly if they grew up in homogeneous white communities struggling to fit in with both their adoptive families and the black community, feeling awkward and out of place in both settings, developing a positive racial/ethnic identity, acknowledging racial differences but without expressing racial pride, and managing racial prejudice and discrimination. The findings from the Donaldson report links the challenges that interracial adoptees face with socialization practices of adoptive parents that minimize racial differences, particularly when parents do not facilitate their children's understanding of and comfort with their own ethnicities.

However, there has also been academic research on transracial adoption that has shown that black children can build strong racial identities when adopted by white parents.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lee|first=Richard M.|last2=Team|first2=Minnesota International Adoption Project|last3=Grotevant|first3=Harold D.|last4=Hellerstedt|first4=Wendy L.|last5=Gunnar|first5=Megan R.|title=Cultural socialization in families with internationally adopted children.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/0893-3200.20.4.571|journal=Journal of Family Psychology|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=571–580|doi=10.1037/0893-3200.20.4.571}}&lt;/ref&gt; In light of this debate, much research has been specifically designed to analyze how transracial adoption affects the construction of a child's personal identity, and whether the circumstance of transracial adoption present such acclaimed negative influence on development. One study&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=G.|first=McRoy, Ruth|last2=A.|first2=Zurcher, Louis|last3=L.|first3=Lauderdale, Michael|last4=N.|first4=Anderson, Rosalie|date=1982-11-01|title=Self-esteem and racial identity in transracial and inracial adoptees|url=https://academic.oup.com/sw/article/27/6/522/1925200/Selfesteem-and-racial-identity-in-transracial-and|journal=Social Work|language=en|volume=27|issue=6|doi=10.1093/sw/27.6.522|issn=0037-8046}}&lt;/ref&gt; compared black children who had been placed with black adoptive families and black children who had been transracially adopted. They measured self-esteem and perception of racial identity. While there was no difference in perception of racial identity, there was a difference in how they perceived their own racial identity. Transracial children were "more likely to identify themselves as being adopted and to use racial self-referents than in racially adopted children" (McRoy, 1982). This study relates back to the importance of how influential transracial adopted parents acculturation, socialization, and awareness of race plays into fostering a positive racial identity for the child.

A study involving Korean adoptees was designed to obtain information on how family involvement in culturally related activities factored into a child's ethnic identity. Results showed that children exposed to higher levels of involvement in Korean cultural activities attributed to a higher measure of Korean identity. In addition, these children were more easily able to communicate openly about their adoption. The implications of this study suggested that involvement of cultural activities of the child's native culture may help in the child's development of integrated ethnic identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Soon Huh|first=Nam|last2=Reid|first2=William J.|date=2016-12-20|title=Intercountry, transracial adoption and ethnic identity: A Korean example|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/a010522|journal=International Social Work|language=en|volume=43|issue=1|pages=75–87|doi=10.1177/a010522}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study, conceptually similarly, looked at both the parents and the children to measure how color-blind racial attitudes would affect engagement in activities of the adoptees native culture. Color blindness is the sociological concept that race, or racial characteristics, do not exist amongst people. The study found that parents scoring lower on color-blind racial attitudes positively correlated with high scores on acculturation and socialization levels, meaning parents that were aware of their cultural differences took part in more cultural activities of their adoptee.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; It is important to note that this study looked at international adoptions, which subsequently includes transracial adoptees, but is not specifically focused on this particular subset of individuals.

Another study, again focused on Korean transracial adoptees, sought to explore self-concept and acculturation through measurements of Religion, Honesty, Relationships with Opposite Sex, Physical Appearance, general self-concept, math, emotional stability, and relationships with parents in relation to age of placement of Korean adoptees. The significant findings in this study highlighted that the later the age at which the Korean adoptees were placed, the higher Honesty self-concept scores were.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The implications of this study presume that the older in which a child is adopted, the more secure they are in their ethnic identity. Due to a longer amount of time, exposed to their native culture, the longer they had to develop a sense of identity of that culture before their adoptive parents' culture.

===Ethnocentric bias===
Finally, some research has examined the [[empirical studies]] of interracial adoption themselves. These studies address whether past research that claims that interracial adoption positively benefits children of color, particularly black children, may have methodological difficulties. Specifically, these studies analyze the presence of an ethnocentric bias in legal and scientific assessments of children's well-being and adjustment.

==Assimilation into the family==
Multicultural families have both similarities and differences from the biological family. A family that has participated with interracial adoption shares similar roles, life stages, and transition points as other families. The challenge comes, however, with the pursuit of a shared family identity through communication. Linda D. Manning conducted a research study on this topic titled "Presenting Opportunities: Communicatively Constructing a Shared Family Identity". The research question she posed initially was, How do members of a multiracial adoptive family communicatively co-construct a shared family identity that emphasizes similarities and allows for difference? The results of the study found that having "cultural artifacts" in the home allow for the embrace of the differing cultures represented in the family. It "creates a worldview that embraces diversity – not just races and ethnicities directly related to those embodied by family members. The choice to embrace multiple races and ethnicities... affirms the multiethnic experience" (Manning, 2006). The study also showed that parents, in any family, present the family identity and the child responds. This is where an interracial family would share the similar roles as in a biological family. The parents act as educators and spokesperson. The children act as compliant participant, challenger, and expert. The research also showed that in an interracial family, there is tension between uniqueness and conformity. It is difficult but essential to balance these two qualities within the family identity. Manning concludes the research study by describing how "the constructs of a shared family identity is both a process and a product". The process includes roles and themes within the family while the product is developed through communication. "A shared family identity is a group identity that encompasses individual identity characteristics shared by each family member, allows for salient differences between and among family members, and accounts for dialectic tensions that exist within family interactions, as well as between the family and the community".

==Education prior to interracial adoption==
{{more citations needed|date=March 2016}}
The [[United States Department of State]] offers multiple resources for parents wanting to adopt such as the "Intercountry Adoption from A-Z" publication, Adoption guides, Adoptive families committees, FAQs, and Visa information. All of these and more are available on their website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adoption.state.gov/adoption_community/parents.php|title=Adopting Parents - Intercountry Adoption|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The article, "Adoptive Parent's Framing of Laypersons' Conceptions of Family" by Elizabeth A. Suter, Kristine L. Reyes, &amp; Robert L. Ballard, addresses the importance of parents preparing for outside comments from others. This study showed that families that had participated in interracial adoption had experienced comments such as "their families violated the canonical view of family in terms of racial dissimilarity between members, construction of family via adoption, and adoption of a child born out of the United States". The article uses a battleground as a metaphor for an adoptive family. The external view of the family does pose as a challenge for interracial families. The results suggest that prior to interracial adoption, parents "should be made aware of social stigmas... and be provided with opportunities to develop a critical consciousness about such stigmas". The research also suggests and encourages required statewide courses for prospective parents.

==Support and opposition==

===Support===
A dichotomy exists in reference to the subject of interracial adoption. Critics of race matching say there is a darker side involving whites with lingering racist beliefs against mixing races. They argue that children are hurt most by the practice. "One of the problems with race-matching policies," says Donna Matias, a lawyer with the Institute of justice, "is that it leaves the children in the system to wait. They are thrown into a vicious cycle where the chances plummet that they will ever get adopted."&lt;ref name="adoption1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.adoption.com/culture-and-ethnicity/the-colors-of-adoption-black-vs-white/article/1791/1.html |title=The Colors of Adoption: Black vs. White - |date=9 June 2008 |publisher= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609095354/http://library.adoption.com/culture-and-ethnicity/the-colors-of-adoption-black-vs-white/article/1791/1.html |archivedate=9 June 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Never getting adopted has been shown to have a negative impact on children. After aging out of foster care, 27% of males and 10% of females were incarcerated within 12 to 18 months. 50% were unemployed, 37% had not finished high school, 33% received public assistance, and 19% of females had given birth to children. Before leaving care, 47 percent were receiving some kind of counseling or medication for mental health problems; that number dropped to 21% after leaving care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statistics.adoption.com/information/adoption-statistics-foster-care-1999.html|title=Adoption Statistics: Foster Care 1999|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051203230630/http://statistics.adoption.com/information/adoption-statistics-foster-care-1999.html|archivedate=2005-12-03|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Opposition===
Opposition to interracial adoption has been [[reactionary]] to extreme misuse of adoption practices; for example [[Australian aborigines]] were taken from their parents, sterilized and then adopted for Christian upbringing.   Similar cases happened with [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].
The National Association of Black Social Workers, which consisted of twelve members, opposed interracial adoption, saying it was "cultural suicide", but their opposition was opposed by such groups as the [[NAACP]].&lt;ref&gt;"African-American Leadership Group Condemns Racist Adoption Practices." Project 21&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"All in the Family." The New Republic, January 24, 1994, pp6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christ, Fran. "When Whites Adopt Blacks."

This is an incomplete '''list of painters in the collection of the Rijksmuseum''', with the number of artworks represented, and sorted by century of birth. For more information about the collection which comprises more than 3,000 paintings, see [[Rijksmuseum]]. More than 300 works are by unknown or anonymous painters, and though over 1,000 individual artists are in the collection, many of these are represented by only one work. The highlights of the collection are the oldest works such as former altarpieces from Amsterdam churches, but also large works for other former Amsterdam institutions by [[Pieter Aertsen]], [[Rembrandt]], [[Nicolaes Maes]], and [[Bartholomeus van der Helst]]. Most of the artists in the collection were born in the 16th and 17th centuries. Only 24 women are represented with works in the collection, most notably [[Judith Leyster]], [[Gesina ter Borch]], [[Catharina van Hemessen]] and [[Rachel Ruysch]].

The '''Manifesto of the People of Brabant''' ({{lang-fr|Manifeste du peuple brabançon}}, {{lang-nl|Manifest van het Brabantse Volk}}) was a document made public at the start of the [[Brabant Revolution]] in 1789 proclaiming the end of [[Austrian Netherlands|Austrian occupation]] over the [[Duchy of Brabant]].

==Background==
In October 1789, the leader of the [[Statists (Belgium)|"Statists"]], [[Henri Van der Noot]] and the general [[Jean-André van der Meersch]] led  a small army of patriots from the [[Dutch Republic]] where they had been in exile into the Duchy of Brabant, then under Austrian rule. The first significant town liberated was [[Hoogstraten]] and it was there that van der Noot made the declaration public to his army.

==Manifesto==
The manifesto was first read on 24 October 1789 in the town of Hoogstraten, though it had been published on the previous day by the Committee of [[Breda]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Van der Noot, Holbach et le Manifeste du peuple brabançon|journal=[[Revue belge de philologie et d'histoire]]|author=J. Vercruysse|issue=46|year=1968|pages=1222–1227 |url=http://www.persee.fr/web/revues/home/prescript/article/rbph_0035-0818_1968_num_46_4_2752}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke of Brabant was obliged by the terms of the [[Joyous Entry of 1356|Joyous Entry]] to respect the privileges of the people of Brabant. The element which sparked the revolution was the infringement of the terms, meaning that the declaration also declaired Duke Joseph of Brabant deposed from his position.  

The declaration led, in January 1790, to the establishment of the [[United Belgian States]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="38887">[[File:Flag of North Carolina.svg|thumb|right|The [[flag of North Carolina]] bears the date of the Mecklenburg Declaration: May 20, 1775.]]
The '''Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence''' is a text published in 1819 with the claim that it was the first [[declaration of independence]] made in the [[Thirteen Colonies]] during the [[American Revolution]]. It was supposedly signed on May 20, 1775, in [[Charlotte, North Carolina]], by a committee of citizens of [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina|Mecklenburg County]], who declared independence from [[Kingdom of Great Britain|Great Britain]] after hearing of the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|battle of Lexington]]. If the story is true, the Mecklenburg Declaration preceded the [[United States Declaration of Independence]] by more than a year. The authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration has been disputed since it was published, forty-four years after it was reputedly written. There is no verifiable evidence to confirm the original document's existence and no reference to it has been found in extant newspapers from 1775.{{citation-needed|date=November 2018}}

Professional historians have maintained that the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence is an inaccurate rendering of an authentic document known as the [[Mecklenburg Resolves]]. The Mecklenburg Resolves were a set of radical resolutions passed on May 31, 1775, that fell short of an actual declaration of independence. Although published in newspapers in 1775, the text of the Mecklenburg Resolves was lost after the American Revolution and not rediscovered until 1838. Historians believe that the Mecklenburg Declaration was written in 1800 in an attempt to recreate the Mecklenburg Resolves from memory. According to this theory, the author of the Mecklenburg Declaration mistakenly believed that the Resolves had been a declaration of independence, and so he recreated the Resolves with language borrowed from the United States Declaration of Independence. Defenders of the Mecklenburg Declaration have argued that both the Mecklenburg Declaration and the Mecklenburg Resolves are authentic.

The early government of North Carolina, convinced that the Mecklenburg Declaration was genuine, maintained that North Carolinians were the first Americans to declare independence from Great Britain. As a result, both the seal and the flag of North Carolina bear the date of the declaration. A holiday commemorating the Mecklenburg Declaration, "Meck Dec Day", is celebrated on May 20 in North Carolina, although it is no longer an official holiday and does not attract the attention that it once did.

==Initial publication==
The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence was published on April 30, 1819 in an article written by Dr. Joseph McKnitt Alexander in the ''Raleigh Register and North Carolina Gazette'', of [[Raleigh, North Carolina|Raleigh]], [[North Carolina]].&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 172. Alexander's 1819 article is reprinted in Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=JHQBAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA3,M1 3–7].&lt;/ref&gt; "It is not probably known to many of our readers," wrote the editor of the ''Raleigh Register'' in an introduction to the article, "that the citizens of Mecklenburg County, in this State made a Declaration of Independence more than a year before Congress made theirs."&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Alexander, his father, John McKnitt Alexander, had been the clerk at a meeting convened in [[Charlotte, North Carolina|Charlotte]] on May 19, 1775. Each [[Militia (United States)|militia]] company in [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina|Mecklenburg County]] had sent two delegates to the meeting, where measures were to be discussed regarding the ongoing dispute between the [[British Empire]] and the [[Thirteen Colonies|American colonies]]. Relations between the colonies and the mother country had reached a crisis in [[Boston, Massachusetts]], following the 1774 passage of the [[Coercive Acts]] by the [[Parliament of Great Britain|British Parliament]]. During the meeting in Mecklenburg County, the delegates received official news that the [[Battles of Lexington and Concord|battle of Lexington]] had been fought in Massachusetts one month earlier. Outraged by this turn of events, wrote Dr. Alexander, the delegates unanimously passed the following resolutions at about 2:00&amp;nbsp;a.m. on May&amp;nbsp;20:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
:1. Resolved, That whosoever directly or indirectly abetted, or in any way, form, or manner, countenanced the uncharted and dangerous invasion of our rights, as claimed by Great Britain, is an enemy to this County, to America, and to the inherent and inalienable rights of man.

:2. Resolved, That we the citizens of Mecklenburg County, do hereby dissolve the political bands which have connected us to the Mother Country, and hereby absolve ourselves from all allegiance to the British Crown, and abjure all political connection, contract, or association, with that Nation, who have wantonly trampled on our rights and liberties and inhumanly shed the innocent blood of American patriots at Lexington.

:3. Resolved, That we do hereby declare ourselves a free and independent people, are, and of right ought to be, a sovereign and self-governing Association, under the control of no power other than that of our God and the General Government of the Congress; to the maintenance of which independence, we solemnly pledge to each other, our mutual cooperation, our lives, our fortunes, and our most sacred honor.

:4. Resolved, That as we now acknowledge the existence and control of no law or legal officer, civil or military, within this County, we do hereby ordain and adopt, as a rule of life, all, each and every of our former laws - where, nevertheless, the Crown of Great Britain never can be considered as holding rights, privileges, immunities, or authority therein.

:5. Resolved, That it is also further decreed, that all, each and every military officer in this County, is hereby reinstated to his former command and authority, he acting conformably to these regulations, and that every member present of this delegation shall henceforth be a civil officer, viz. a Justice of the Peace, in the character of a 'Committee-man,' to issue process, hear and determine all matters of controversy, according to said adopted laws, and to preserve peace, and union, and harmony, in said County, and to use every exertion to spread the love of country and fire of freedom throughout America, until a more general and organized government be established in this province.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A few days later, wrote Dr. Alexander, Captain James Jack of Charlotte was sent to the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] in [[Philadelphia]]. Jack carried a copy of the resolves and a letter asking North Carolina's congressmen to have the Mecklenburg proceedings approved by Congress. The North Carolina congressional delegation—[[Richard Caswell]], [[William Hooper]], and [[Joseph Hewes]]—told Jack that although they supported what had been done, it was premature to discuss a declaration of independence in Congress.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Alexander concluded by writing that although the original documents relating to the Mecklenburg Declaration were destroyed in a fire in 1800, the article was written from a true copy of the papers left to him by his father, who was now deceased.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 173; Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Jefferson skeptical==
{{quote box|align=right|width=30%|quote=''Either these resolutions are a plagiarism from Mr. Jefferson's Declaration of Independence, or Mr. Jefferson's Declaration of Independence is a plagiarism from those resolutions.''|source=—[[John Adams]], August 21, 1819&lt;ref&gt;John Adams, ''The Works of John Adams'' (Boston, 1856) [https://books.google.com/books?id=MZQ8AAAAIAAJ&amp;printsec=titlepage&amp;source=gbs_summary_r&amp;cad=0#PPA383,M1 10:383]; also quoted in Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 161.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The 1819 article about the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence was reprinted in many newspapers across the United States.&lt;ref name="Hoyt7"&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 7.&lt;/ref&gt; People immediately noticed that, even though the Mecklenburg Declaration was supposedly written more than a year before the 1776 [[United States Declaration of Independence]], the two declarations had some very similar phrases, including "dissolve the political bands which have connected", "absolve ourselves from all allegiance to the British Crown", "are, and of right ought to be", and "pledge to each other, our mutual cooperation, our lives, our fortunes, and our most sacred honor".&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, ''Jefferson Image'', 140–41.&lt;/ref&gt; This raised an obvious question: did [[Thomas Jefferson]], the principal author of the American Declaration of Independence, use the Mecklenburg Declaration as a source?

[[File:Thomas Jefferson by Rembrandt Peale, 1800.jpg|thumb|left|Former President [[Thomas Jefferson]], principal author of the United States Declaration of Independence, suspected that the Mecklenburg Declaration was a hoax.]]

One person who thought so was [[John Adams]], who like Jefferson was elderly and in retirement when the Mecklenburg Declaration was published in 1819. When Adams read Dr. Alexander's article in a Massachusetts newspaper, he was astonished because he had never previously heard of the Mecklenburg Declaration. He immediately assumed, as he wrote a friend, that Jefferson had "copied the spirit, the sense, and the expressions of it ''verbatim'' into his Declaration of the 4th of July, 1776."&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 7–8.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams, who had played a major role in getting the [[Second Continental Congress|Continental Congress]] to declare independence in 1776, had become somewhat resentful that Jefferson now received most of the praise for independence just because he had written the now-revered document announcing it.&lt;ref name="Maier173"&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 173.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams was therefore privately delighted with the emergence of the Mecklenburg Declaration, since it clearly undercut Jefferson's claim to originality and precedence.&lt;ref name="Maier173" /&gt; Adams sent a copy of the article to Jefferson to get his reaction.

Jefferson replied that, like Adams, he had never heard of the Mecklenburg Declaration before. Jefferson found it curious that historians of the American Revolution, even those from North Carolina and nearby Virginia, had never previously mentioned it. He also found it suspicious that the original was lost in a fire and that most of the eyewitnesses were now dead. Jefferson wrote that while he could not claim for certain that the Mecklenburg Declaration was a fabrication, "I shall believe it such until positive and solemn proof of its authenticity shall be produced."&lt;ref&gt;The correspondence between Adams and Jefferson pertaining to the Mecklenburg Declaration has often been reprinted. Extracts can be found, for example, in Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 7–11, or D.A. Tompkins, ''History of Mecklenburg County and the City of Charlotte'' (1904), [https://books.google.com/books?id=w8olAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=toc#PPA11,M1 p. 14].&lt;/ref&gt;

Jefferson's argument, Adams wrote in reply, "has entirely convinced me that 
the Mecklengburg{{sic}} Resolutions are a fiction".&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 11.&lt;/ref&gt; Adams forwarded Jefferson's letter to the editor of the Massachusetts newspaper, who wrote an article expressing reservations about the Mecklenburg Declaration without mentioning Jefferson or Adams by name.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt; In response to this skepticism, North Carolina senator [[Nathaniel Macon]] and others collected eyewitness testimony to the events described in the article. The now elderly witnesses did not agree in every detail, but they generally corroborated the story that a declaration of independence had been read in public in Charlotte, although they were not all certain about the date. Perhaps most importantly, eighty-eight-year-old Captain James Jack was still living, and he confirmed that he had delivered to the Continental Congress a declaration of independence that had been adopted in May 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Captain Jack's testimony was often reprinted, for example in Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 251–52.&lt;/ref&gt; For many, the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration had been firmly established.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 12–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signers==
After the Mecklenburg Declaration was published in 1819, supporters compiled a list of men who they believed had signed the document. [[William Polk (colonel)|William Polk]], who said that he had heard his father [[Thomas Polk]] read the Declaration to the public, listed the names of fifteen delegates present when the Declaration was adopted; other testimony produced other names.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 219.&lt;/ref&gt; A pamphlet issued in 1831 by the government of North Carolina listed the names of twenty-six delegates. Eventually, supporters of the Declaration settled on a list of twenty-seven or twenty-eight men who they claimed had signed the document. In alphabetical order, they are:

Modern historians have emphasized that the story of the 1775 signing of the Mecklenburg Declaration can be dated no earlier than 1819.&lt;ref name="Hoyt218"&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 218.&lt;/ref&gt; There is no contemporaneous evidence of a signing, nor did John McKnitt Alexander mention such an event in his notes.&lt;ref name="Hoyt218" /&gt; As far as it is known, none of the "signers" ever claimed to have signed the Mecklenburg Declaration.

Most of the listed signers were [[Scotch-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] [[Presbyterians]], as were many of the early promoters of the authenticity of the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Current, "The Other Declaration", 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the reputed signers were kinsmen, and their descendants were among the staunchest defenders of the Declaration.

Eyewitnesses who provided testimony about the 1775 meeting disagreed about the roles played by some of the signers. John McKnitt Alexander wrote that he had been the secretary at the meeting, but others recalled that Ephraim Brevard had been the secretary. Alexander wrote that his kinsman Adam Alexander had issued the order for the meeting to be convened, but William Polk and other eyewitnesses insisted that Thomas Polk had called the meeting. [[Abraham Alexander]] is said to have chaired the meeting.

==Celebration and controversy==
After 1819, people in North Carolina (and [[Tennessee]], which shared an early history) began to take pride in the previously unheralded Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. Before then, Virginia and Massachusetts had been given much of the credit for leading the American Revolution. The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence clearly enhanced North Carolina's role—already notable because of the [[Halifax Resolves]] of April 1776—in establishing American independence. The first celebration of the anniversary of the supposed adoption of the Mecklenburg Declaration took place in Charlotte on May 20, 1825.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many North Carolinians were offended when Thomas Jefferson's skeptical letter about the Mecklenburg Declaration was posthumously published in 1829. In questioning the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration, Jefferson, a Virginian, had impolitically referred to [[William Hooper]], one of North Carolina's signers of the American Declaration of Independence, as a "[[tory]]". According to author Hoyt, Jefferson used the term to mean that Hooper had been conservative on declaring independence, not to imply that he had been a [[Loyalist (American Revolution)|Loyalist]], but North Carolinians felt their honored [[Patriot (American Revolution)|Patriots]] had been slighted.&lt;ref name="Hoyt15"&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

The state of North Carolina responded to Jefferson's letter in 1831 with an official pamphlet that reprinted the previously published accounts with some additional testimony in support of the Mecklenburg Declaration.&lt;ref name="Hoyt15" /&gt; This was followed in 1834 with a book by a leading North Carolina historian, Joseph Seawell Jones, entitled ''A Defence of the Revolutionary History of the State of North Carolina from the Aspersions of Mr. Jefferson.'' Jones defended the patriotism of William Hooper and accused Jefferson of being envious that a little county in North Carolina had declared independence at a time when the "Sage of [[Monticello]]" was still hoping for reconciliation with Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, ''Jefferson Image'', 141.&lt;/ref&gt; On May 20, 1835, more than five thousand people gathered in Charlotte to celebrate the Mecklenburg Declaration. In the many toasts celebrating "the ''first'' declaration of American independence", Jefferson was never mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, ''Jefferson Image'', 142.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mecklenburg Declaration hoax.JPG|thumb|A fraudulent recreation of a page from the June 3, 1775, issue of the ''Cape Fear Mercury'', which supposedly printed the text of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence. Published in ''[[Collier's Magazine]]'' in 1905, the reproduction was quickly shown to be a hoax.]]

In 1837, Jefferson's first biographer, [[George Tucker (politician)|George Tucker]], came to Jefferson's defense. In ''The Life of Thomas Jefferson'', Tucker argued that Jefferson's Declaration of Independence had been fraudulently [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|interpolated]] into the Mecklenburg Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, ''Jefferson Image'', 142; Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 17.&lt;/ref&gt; North Carolina native [[Francis L. Hawks]], a New York Anglican clergyman, responded that Jefferson had instead [[Plagiarism|plagiarized]] the Mecklenburg Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Peterson, ''Jefferson Image'', 127–28, 142.&lt;/ref&gt; Hawks's position was apparently supported by the discovery of a proclamation by [[Josiah Martin]], the last royal governor of North Carolina, which seemed to confirm the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration. In August 1775, Governor Martin had written that he had:

&lt;blockquote&gt;seen a most infamous publication in the ''Cape Fear Mercury'' importing to be resolves of a set of people styling themselves a committee for the county of Mecklenburg, most traitorously declaring the entire dissolution of the laws, government, and constitution of this country, and setting up a system of rule and regulation repugnant to the laws and subversive of his majesty's government....&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 16.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Here, at last, was contemporaneous confirmation that radical resolves had been adopted in Mecklenburg County in 1775. Unfortunately, the issue of the ''Cape Fear Mercury'' that Martin referred to could not be found. Throughout the 19th century, supporters of the Mecklenburg Declaration hoped that the missing paper would be discovered, proving their case. In 1905, ''[[Collier's Magazine]]'' published what was said to be a clipping from the missing issue, but advocates and opponents of the Mecklenburg Declaration agreed that the document was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 52–53.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later confirmed that the "traitorous" document referred to by Governor Martin was not the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence, but was instead a radical set of resolutions known as the [[Mecklenburg Resolves]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 51–52; Henderson, [http://www.newrivernotes.com/nc/meckdec1.htm "The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence"], ''The Journal of American History'', 1912. Henderson noted that it was previously thought that Martin had sent a copy of the Mecklenburg Declaration to England, but that it is "now established beyond doubt" that he had sent a copy of the Resolves.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Discovery alters the debate==
In 1838, the case for the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence suffered a setback from which it has not recovered. That year, while examining newspapers published in 1775, archivist [[Peter Force]] discovered an abbreviated list of resolutions adopted in Mecklenburg County on May 31, 1775, that were different from the Mecklenburg Declaration of May 20.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 18.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1847, the complete text of these [[Mecklenburg Resolves]] was found in a South Carolina newspaper published in June 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 18–19.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--The same Resolves were subsequently discovered in a North Carolina newspaper, also published in June 1775.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt; Unlike the Mecklenburg Declaration that had appeared in the ''Raleigh Register'' in 1819, the Mecklenburg Resolves fell short of an outright declaration of independence, and did not contain language that was parallel to Jefferson's 1776 Declaration of Independence. The Resolves, though radical, were similar to other local resolutions that were adopted in the colonies in 1774 and 1775.

The controversy over the Mecklenburg Declaration entered a new phase with the discovery of the Mecklenburg Resolves. The focus shifted from Thomas Jefferson to the question of how to account for two very different sets of resolutions supposedly adopted in Charlotte only eleven days apart. How was it possible that citizens of Mecklenburg County declared independence on May 20, and then met again on May 31 to pass less revolutionary resolutions? For skeptics of the Mecklenburg Declaration, the answer was that the Declaration was a misdated, inaccurate recreation of the authentic Resolves. Supporters of the Declaration maintained that both documents were genuine, and were adopted to serve different purposes.

===Argument against===
The argument that the Mecklenburg Declaration is a flawed version of the Mecklenburg Resolves was first made in 1853 by Charles Phillips, a professor at the [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]].&lt;ref&gt;McNitt, ''Chain of Error'', 88.&lt;/ref&gt; In an influential article in the ''North Carolina University Magazine'', Dr. Phillips concluded that John McKnitt Alexander had admitted to having reconstructed the text of the Mecklenburg Declaration from memory in 1800.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 144.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1906, William Henry Hoyt published a scholarly work that many historians have regarded as the conclusive refutation of the Mecklenburg Declaration.

Hoyt's argument is briefly as follows: After the original documents relating to the Mecklenburg Resolves were destroyed by fire in 1800, John McKnitt Alexander attempted to recreate them from memory.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 30, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; Alexander made some rough notes, which still survive, and internal evidence indicates that these notes were written after the 1800 fire.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 140–41.&lt;/ref&gt; Like some of his contemporaries, Alexander mistakenly remembered the radical Mecklenburg Resolves as being an actual declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 28–30, 150.&lt;/ref&gt; This misconception led Alexander, or perhaps another unknown writer, to borrow language from Jefferson's well-known Declaration of Independence when the Mecklenburg Declaration was written from Alexander's rough notes.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 160.&lt;/ref&gt; The eleven-day discrepancy between the two sets of resolutions—May 20&amp;nbsp;and May&amp;nbsp;31—may result from some confusion of [[Old Style and New Style dates]].&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 171.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to this argument, when the elderly eyewitnesses were interviewed after 1819, they naturally could not be expected to verify the wording of a document that they had heard read nearly fifty years earlier, nor remember the exact date of the public reading. The eyewitnesses were misled into accepting the text of the Mecklenburg Declaration as authentic because it had been published in 1819 with the claim that it was a true copy of the original resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 29–30, 205–06.&lt;/ref&gt; Because the actual resolutions had been radical, and British authority in Mecklenburg County had effectively ended in 1775, the eyewitnesses were able to believe that the Mecklenburg Resolves had been an outright declaration of independence. While they undoubtedly told the truth about the events of May 1775 as they remembered them, their testimony was given in response to [[leading question]]s, and their answers actually referred to the lost Mecklenburg Resolves.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 206.&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, by the time the authentic text of the Resolves had been rediscovered, all of the eyewitnesses were dead, and so no one could be asked to explain the existence of two different sets of resolutions.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Argument for===
[[File:Mecklenburg County Court House 1898.jpg|thumb|In 1898, this monument was erected in front of the Mecklenburg County Court House to honor the signers of the Mecklenburg Declaration. The building no longer exists, but the monument now stands behind another old court building.]]

Advocates of the Mecklenburg Declaration have argued that both the Declaration and the Resolves are authentic. This argument was developed in the 20th century by Professor [[Archibald Henderson (professor)|Archibald Henderson]] of the University of North Carolina, who, beginning in 1916, wrote numerous articles on the subject. Henderson believed that the evidence showed that Mecklenburg County had adopted two sets of resolutions, that the text of the Mecklenburg Declaration was not recreated from memory, and that the events as described in Dr. Alexander's 1819 article were substantially correct. His work was supplemented in 1960 by journalist V. V. McNitt's book ''Chain of Error and the Mecklenburg Declarations of Independence''.

One of the strongest pieces of nearly contemporaneous evidence in support of the Mecklenburg Declaration is a diary entry discovered in 1904. The entry is unsigned and undated, but internal evidence suggests that it was written in 1783 in [[Old Salem|Salem, North Carolina]], by a merchant named Traugott Bagge.&lt;ref&gt;Fries, ''Mecklenburg Declaration as Mentioned'', 1–11.&lt;/ref&gt; The English translation of the German entry reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I cannot leave unmentioned at the end of the 1775th year that already in the summer of this year, that is in May, June, or July, the County of Mecklenburg in North Carolina declared itself free and independent of England, and made such arrangements for the administration of the laws among themselves, as later the Continental Congress made for all. This Congress, however, considered these proceedings premature.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Skeptics of the Mecklenburg Declaration argued that the diary entry merely suggests that Bagge, writing eight years after the event, misinterpreted the Mecklenburg Resolves as having been an actual declaration of independence.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyt, ''Mecklenburg Declaration'', 119–20.&lt;/ref&gt; Archibald Henderson, however, argued that the entry attested to both the Declaration ("declared itself free and independent") and the Resolves ("arrangements for the administration of the laws").&lt;ref name="newrivernotes.com"&gt;Henderson, [http://www.newrivernotes.com/nc/meckdec1.htm "The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence"].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current status of the debate==
The Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence no longer attracts much attention from professional historians, who generally regard the document as spurious. If the declaration is mentioned in scholarly works, it is usually to discount it. Professor [[William S. Powell]], in his standard history ''North Carolina through Four Centuries'' (1989) relegates the Mecklenburg Declaration to a skeptical footnote;&lt;ref&gt;As noted in Converse D. Clowse, "Alexander, Abraham", ''[[American National Biography Online]]'', February 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor H.G. Jones, in his ''North Carolina Illustrated'' (Chapel Hill: University of N.C. Press, 1983), pointedly places ironic quotation marks around the name of the declaration. The ''Harvard Guide to American History'' (1954) lists the Mecklenburg Declaration under the heading of "spurious declarations." Pulitzer Prize-winning historian [[Allan Nevins]] wrote in 1938 "Legends often become a point of faith. At one time the State of North Carolina made it compulsory for the public schools to teach that Mecklenburg County had adopted a Declaration of Independence on May 20, 1775—to teach what had been clearly demonstrated an untruth."&lt;ref&gt;Nevins, ''Gateway to History'' (1938), 119.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997 historian [[Pauline Maier]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;When compared to other documents of the time, the "Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence" supposedly adopted on May 20, 1775, is simply incredible. It makes the reaction of North Carolinians to Lexington and Concord more extreme than that of the Massachusetts people who received the blow. The resolutions of May 31, 1775, of which there is contemporary evidence, were also radical, but remain believable.&lt;ref&gt;Maier, ''American Scripture'', 174.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Despite much scholarly opinion against the authenticity of the Mecklenburg Declaration, belief in the document remains important to some North Carolinians, says historian Dan L. Morrill, who notes that the possibility that it is genuine cannot be entirely discounted. Morrill writes, "Let's make one thing clear. One cannot demonstrate conclusively that the Mecklenburg Declaration of Independence is a fake. The dramatic events of May nineteenth and May twentieth could have happened. Ultimately, it is a matter of faith, not proof. You believe it or you don't believe it."&lt;ref&gt;Morrill, [http://danandmary.com/historyofcharlottechap2replace.htm ''A History Of Charlotte and Mecklenburg County''], ch. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, North Carolina released a new license plate, with the words "First in Freedom" and the date of the Declaration of Independence preceded by the date of North Carolina's supposed declaration.

==Commemoration==
[[File:NorthCarolina-StateSeal.svg|thumb|right|The [[seal of North Carolina]] bears the date of the Mecklenburg Declaration.]]

The early government of North Carolina, convinced that the Mecklenburg Declaration was authentic,  maintained that North Carolinians were the first Americans to declare independence from Britain. As a result, both the seal and the flag of North Carolina bear the date of the declaration. Coins have been minted that celebrate the Mecklenburg Declaration, and the story was printed in elementary school textbooks. A monument to the reputed signers of the declaration was unveiled in Charlotte on May 20, 1898, and a commemorative tablet was placed in the rotunda of the [[North Carolina State Capitol]] building on May 20, 1912.&lt;ref name="newrivernotes.com"/&gt; In 1881, the state legislature made May 20 a legal holiday to commemorate the Mecklenburg Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;Current, "That Other Declaration", 181.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes known as "Meck Dec Day", it is no longer an official holiday and does not attract the attention that it once did.

Four United States presidents visited Charlotte to participate in the Mecklenburg Day celebration: [[William Howard Taft]] (1909), [[Woodrow Wilson]] (1916), [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]] (1954), and [[Gerald Ford]] (1975). Aware of the controversy, the presidents generally praised the revolutionary patriots of Mecklenburg County without specifically endorsing the authenticity of the disputed document.&lt;ref&gt;McNitt, ''Chain of Error'', 113–14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mecklenburg Declaration is referenced in the motto for [[Davidson College]], located in [[Davidson, North Carolina|Davidson]] in [[Mecklenburg County, North Carolina|Mecklenburg]] and [[Iredell County, North Carolina|Iredell]] counties: ''Alenda Lux Ubi Orta Libertas'' ("Let Knowledge Be Cherished Where Liberty Has Arisen").

[[File:Nanfangcaomuzhuang.svg|thumb|''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' title page, 1726 Japanese edition]]
The (c. 304 CE) '''''Nanfang caomu zhuang''''' (南方草木狀 '''''Plants of the Southern Regions'''''), attributed to the [[Jin dynasty (265-420)|Western Jin dynasty]] scholar and botanist Ji Han (嵇含, 263-307), is a [[Flora (publication)|Flora]] describing the plants of [[Nanyue]] and [[Jiaozhi]], present-day [[South China]] and northern [[Vietnam]]. The ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' is the oldest work extant in any language on subtropical botany. The book contains the first descriptions of several economic plants, for instance [[jasmine]] and [[black pepper]], as well as the earliest accounts of some agricultural techniques such as [[biological pest control]] (using [[Oecophylla smaragdina|"citrus ants"]] to protect [[orange (fruit)|orange]] crops), and the cultivation of vegetables on floating gardens (centuries before the earliest recorded Mesoamerican ''[[chinampa]]''). 

Since 1273, when the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' was first printed in the [[Song dynasty]], it was frequently quoted by Chinese authors, both in literature and technical books on horticulture, agriculture, and [[Chinese herbology]]. Since the 19th century (e.g., [[Friedrich Hirth|Hirth]] 1865 and [[Emil Bretschneider|Bretschneider]] 1870), many Western sinologists, botanists, and historians of plant cultivation have studied it.
 
==Ji Han==
The ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' author Ji Han was "one of the greatest of all Chinese botanists" (Needham, Ho, and Lu 1976: 80).

The primary source of information about Ji Han's life is the ''[[Book of Jin]]'' biography of his uncle Ji Shao (嵇紹), who was the son of the poet-musician [[Ji Kang]] (23–262), one of the [[Seven Worthies of the Bamboo Grove]]. Ji Han was born in 263 in Zhixian (銍縣, in present-day [[Anhui]] province). His [[courtesy name]] was Jun Dao (君道 "Gentleman's Way"), and his [[pen name]] Boqiuzi (亳丘子 "Master of Boqiu") refers to his residence at Boqiu (present-day [[Henan]]) near the capital [[Luoyang]]. He served as a scholar-administrator and poet on the staff of several princes. 

In 300, during the [[War of the Eight Princes]], Ji Han was a military commander under the future [[Emperor Huai of Jin]] (r. 307-313), whose army suffered a defeat at Tangyin (蕩陰), in which his uncle Ji Shao was killed protecting the emperor. Ji Han was made prefect of [[Xiangcheng County, Henan|Xiangcheng]] in 304, but when it was conquered, he had to escape south to [[Xiangyang]] (present-day [[Hebei]]), and at the recommendation of the official Liu Hong (劉弘), he was appointed governor of [[Guangdong]] in 306. However, before he could leave, Ji Han was assassinated at Xiangyang in 307 after Liu Hong's death. When Ji Han was made Governor, he appointed his friend [[Ge Hong]], the alchemist and author of the ''[[Shenxian zhuan]]'' and ''[[Baopuzi]]'', as [[aide-de-camp]]. Ge Hong went to Guangdong ahead of Ji, and remained there afterwards for several years, probably because he was interested in the exotic plants and unusual mineral substances of the south (Needham, Ho, and Lu 1976: 80).

In addition to writing the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'', the "first botanical treatise of all time", Ji Han was a prolific poet, particularly ''[[Fu (poetry)|fu]]'' "rhapsody; poetic exposition", and deeply interested in botany (Li 1979: 10-11). While most of his ten-volume collected works were lost, later texts quote the prefaces to Ji's poetical ''fu'' essays on the [[daylily]], [[hibiscus]], ''[[Platycarya]]'' tree, evergreen tree, and sweet melon. Ji Han also wrote a ''fu'' on the fashionable "[[Cold-Food Powder]]" mixture of mineral and plant drugs, which says "it cured his ailing son when other treatments had failed" (Lagerwey and Lü 2010:358).

==Title==
The title uses three common Chinese words.
*''Nánfāng'' (南方, lit. "south direction/region") "south; southern part of a country"
*''Cǎomù'' (草木, lit. grass/herb [and] tree") "vegetation; plants (in general)"
*''Zhuàng'' (狀) "form, shape; state, condition; account, record; description, narrative"

The title ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' does not have a standard English translation. For instance, the ''[[Science and Civilisation in China]]'' series of books, edited by [[Joseph Needham]] and his international collaborators, gives six variant versions. 
*"Plants and Trees of the Southern Regions" (Needham and Wang 1954: 118)

==Content==
[[File:Yue statue.jpg|thumb|Statue of a tattooed man from [[Yue (state)|Yue]] state, [[Zhejiang Provincial Museum]]]]
The ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' text is divided into three chapters, with a total of 80 botanical entries. The first (''cǎolèi'' 草類 "Herbs", 1-29) consists of 29 herbs and plants, the second (''mùlèi'' 木類 "Trees", 30-57) 28 forest trees, and the third consists of (''guǒlèi'' 果類 "Fruits", 58-74) 17 fruit trees, and (''zhúlèi'' 竹類 "Bamboos", 75-80) 6 bamboos.

The Preface explains Ji Han's motive in writing the book.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The plants of Nan-yueh and Chiao-chih are the most interesting of the four borderlands. They were not known before the Chou and Ch'in dynasties. Since the expansion territories undertaken by Wu Ti of Han, the rare and precious kinds were sought and brought in and the best were used as tributes. As people of the central regions [China] are often unfamiliar with their nature, I hereby record and describe these from what I have heard for the benefit of future generations. (tr. Li 1979: 32) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ancient kingdom of [[Nanyue]] ("southern [[Yue (state)|Yue]]") was located in parts of the present-day [[Chinese provinces]] of [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], and [[Yunnan]]; [[Jiaozhi]] was in northern [[Vietnam]]. The pre-Han dynasties were the [[Zhou dynasty|Zhou]] (c. 1046–256 BCE) and [[Qin dynasty|Qin]] (221–206 BCE). [[Emperor Wu of Han]] (r. 141–87 BCE) led the [[Southward expansion of the Han dynasty]].

Among six proposed categories of Chinese authors who wrote botanical books, Ji Han and the exotic botanical ''Nanfang caomu zhuiang'' exemplify the first, "scholar-officials, physicians and others whose duties took them to those places within or on the borders of the empire where special plants flourished" (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 359).

==Genre==
The ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' is considered the type-specimen for the "strange plants of the south" genre of Chinese botanical writings (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 28). Within the traditional [[Sinocentric]] world-view, China's "south" (''nan'' 南) referred to the seaward-facing regions of present-day [[Zhejiang]], [[Fujian]], [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], and [[Hainan]] provinces, all subtropical or tropical in climate are distinctly separate from the rest of China, which is borne out by their affiliation to a different [[floristic]] region. The [[Nan Mountains]] or ''Wuling'' (五岭 "five [[mountain ranges]]") geographically and climatically separate [[Northern and Southern China]], and [[Lingnan]] ("south of the mountain ranges") is another name for the subtropical area that Ji Han called Nanyue and Jiaozhi.

The first book in the "strange plants of the south" genre was the (early 3rd century) ''[[Yiwu Zhi|Yiwu zhi]]'' ("Record of Strange/Foreign Things"), by the Eastern Han official [[Yang Fu (Han dynasty)|Yang Fu]]. It is also known as the ''Nanyi yiwu zhi'' (南裔異物志, "Record of Strange Things of the Southern Borders").

The (c. 3rd century) ''Nanzhou yiwu zhi'' (南洲異物志, "Record of Strange Things of the Southern Continent") or ''Nanfang yiwu zhi'' (南方異物志, "Record of Strange Things of the South") was written by Wan Zhen (萬震), and may have been one of Ji Han's sources for his book.

Ji Han's ''Nanfang caomu zhi'' ("Record of Southern Plants and Trees") title is sometimes confused with the (c. 3rd-4th century) ''Nanfang caowu zhi'' (南方草物狀, "Record of Southern Plants and Products"), which was written by a less well-known person, whose name is written Xu Zhong (徐衷) or Xu Biao (徐表). In order to explain the confusion of these ''caomu'' ("plants and trees") and ''caowu'' ("plants and products") titles, Needham, Lu, and Huang (1986: 450) compare this almost-identically named parallel work with [[noise (electronics)|noise]] in [[communication systems]]. For instance, an early Chinese book on agriculture, Jia Sixie's (賈思勰, c. 540) ''[[Qimin Yaoshu]]'' was fond of quoting the ''Nanfang caowu zhi'', as were others later, often giving ''Nanfang caomu zhi'' as the title. But since none of the Xu Zhong quotations can be found in the work of Ji Han as it has come down to us, some scholars supposed the two books to have been one and the same. Modern scholarship has shown that the two books were quite distinct. In contrast to Ji Han's "refinement", Xu Zhong's style is "plain and rather repetitive". There are five cases of the same plant being described by both authors, and then the entries are generally quite different; but the ''Nanfang caowu zhi'' was never a flora, for it included marine animals and all kinds of natural products (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 451).

The (early 19th century) ''Xu nanfang caomu zhi'' (續南方草木狀 "Supplement to the Record of Southern Plants and Trees"), written by Jiang Fan (江藩), is an independent study rather than a supplement to Ji Han's book. It contains brief notes on 42 plants in Guangdong (Li 1979: 30).

==Sample entries==
[[File:Bananavarieties.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Left to right: [[Plantain (cooking)|plantain]]s, [[Red banana|Red]], [[Latundan banana|Latundan]], and [[Cavendish banana|Cavendish]] bananas.|alt=Photo of four several large green, smaller red, very small yellow, and medium-sized yellow bananas]]
The best way to elucidate the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' text is to provide some noteworthy entries for bananas, Chinese spinach, oranges, and "herb ferment".

===Banana===
The ''Gānjiāo'' (甘蕉, lit. "sweet banana/plantain") "[[banana]], ''Musa paradisiaca'', ''Musa sapientum''" entry distinguishes two kinds of dessert-banana plants and one fiber-banana plant.
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kan-chiao, seen from afar, resembles a tree. The larger plants are over one armspan in circumference. The leaves are ten feet long, or sometimes seven to eight feet and over one to almost two feet broad. The flowers are as big as a wine cup, with the shape and color of a lotus. Over one hundred pods are attached together at the end of the stem, called a ''fang'' (房, spathe). They are sweet and palatable and can also be preserved in honey. The roots resemble taro, the largest as big as a carriage wheel. Fruiting follows flowering, and the flowers, which have a cluster of six pods each, develop successively. The pods are not formed simultaneously and the flowers do not drop at the same time. It is also called ''Pa-chiao'' 芭蕉 or ''Pa-chü'' 巴苴. Removing the peel of the pod, the yellowish-white interior with a taste like the grape appears, sweet and soft. It satisfies hunger also. 
There are three kinds. The kind with pods the size of a thumb, long and pointed, resembling a sheep's horn in shape, is called ''Yang-chiao-chiao'' 羊角蕉 (sheep's horn banana), and is the sweetest and most delicious in taste. Another kind with pods the size of a hen's egg and resembling a cow's udder is called ''Niu-ju-chiao'' 牛乳蕉 (cow's udder banana), and is slightly inferior to ''Yang-chiao-chiao''. A third kind is the size of a lotus rootstock; the pods are six to seven inches in length, squarish in shape, not sweet, and considered the most inferior. The stem is separable into fibers, and when treated with lime, can be woven into thin cloth, called ''Chiao-ko'' 蕉葛 (banana linen). Although the cloth is soft and good and yellowish-white in color, it is not comparable to the reddish linen. The plant grows in both Chiao and Kuang. According to the ''San-fu huang-t'u'' 三輔黃圖, "Wu Ti of Han, in the sixth year of the Yüan-ting period (111 B.C.), conquered Nan-yüeh and built the Fu-Ii Palace to plant the rare plants and strange trees obtained. There are two plants Kan-chiao." (1, tr. Li 1979: 32-33) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
This detailed description is of great interest for botanists (Needham and Kuhn 1988: 49), but closer observation would have shown that the six fruits in a half-spiral did not come from one ovary (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 453). Since banana plants are all sterile hybrid [[cultigens]], species differentiation is problematic. ''[[Musa × paradisiaca]]'' includes the previously differentiated ''M. paradisiaca'' "cooking/fiber banana; plantain" and ''M. sapientum'' " dessert banana". Judging from the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' account, the two ''yángjiǎojiāo'' (羊角蕉 "ram's horn banana") and ''niúrǔjiāo'' (牛乳蕉 "cow's milk banana") were of the edible ''sapientum'' type, and the unnamed third was of the fibrous ''paradisiaca'' type. ''Xiāngjiāo'' (香蕉 "fragrant banana") is the common name in [[Modern Standard Chinese]] usage.

The most surprising thing is the emphasis placed on the banana as a [[fiber plant]] (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 453), and the oldest occurrences of the word ''jiao'' mention no fruit, but only the value of the fiber and the cloth. The (121 CE) ''[[Shuowen jiezi]]'' first recorded the [[Chinese character]] ''jiāo'' (蕉 "plantain; banana"), which combines the "[[Radical 140|plant radical]]" (艸) and a ''jiāo'' (焦 "burnt; scorched") phonetic, defined as (生枲, lit. "living/raw male [[Galeopsis|hemp-nettle]]") translated "raw plant fiber" (Reynolds 1940: 165) or "natural nettle-hemp" (Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 453). [[Zuo Si]]'s (c. 270) "Wudu fu" (吳都賦 "Rhapsody on the Wu capital", i.e., [[Suzhou]]) mentions ''jiāogé'' (蕉葛 "linen made from banana/plantain fibers") but not the fruit. Needham, Lu, and Huang (1986: 453) say that the banana was primarily a textile-producer, rather than cultivated for fruit, which could reasonably explain the origin of the name, for ''jiāo'' (焦) means "heat; burning; boiling", which was how the stems had to be treated with lime water to get the fibers. 

This entry quotes the ''Sanfu huangtu'' (三輔黃圖 "Description of palace buildings in [the Han capital] [[Chang'an]]"), which is an anonymous text of uncertain date, estimated at from the 3rd century (Reynolds 1940: 166) to the 8th century (Ma 1978: 231), says:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In the sixth year of Yüan-ting [i.e., 111 B. C.] of the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, Annam was vanquished. The palace Fu-li kung 扶荔宮 [so named on account of its lichee plants] was built [in Ch'ang-an, the national capital] for transplanting the newly acquired plants ... among which were ... twelve plants of the ''kan-chiao'', etc. ... Because the climates of the North and the South are different, most of the plants soon died. (tr. Reynolds 1940: 166) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Parts of this ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' banana entry are almost identical with passages in earlier and later texts. The ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' source could have been the (2nd-3rd century) ''Yiwu zhi'' or (3rd century) ''Nanzhou yiwu zhi''; and it could have been copied into the (3rd-4th century) ''Nanfang caowu zhi'' and (4th-5th century) ''Guang zhi'' (廣志). Yang Fu's ''Yiwu zhi'' gives this description.
&lt;blockquote&gt;''Pa-chiao'' has leaves as large as mats. Its stem is like a [bamboo] shoot. After boiling, the stem breaks into fibres and can be used for weaving cloth. Women weavers make this fibre into fine or coarse linen which is known now as ''chiao-chih'' [Cochin-China] linen. The center of the plant is shaped like a garlic-bulb and is as large as a plate[?]. There the fruit grows and holds the 'stem.' One stem bears several tens of fruits. The fruit has a reddish skin like the color of fire and when peeled the inside pulp is dark. The pulp is edible and is very sweet, like sugar or honey. Four or five of these fruits are enough for a meal. After eating, the flavor lingers on among the teeth. ''Kan-chiao'' is another name for it. (tr. Reynolds 1940: 167) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
The ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' has another entry (9) for an unidentified ''shuijiao'' (水蕉 "water banana") that "resembles the day-lily, and is either purple or yellow", which Li (1979: 44) suggests might be ''[[Lycoris (plant)|Lycoris]]''.

===Chinese spinach===
[[File:Ipomoea aquatica.jpg|thumb|''[[Ipomoea aquatica]]'' water spinach]]
The ''Nanfangcao mu zhuang'' entry for ''yongcai'' (蕹葉 "''[[Ipomoea aquatica]]''; Chinese spinach; water spinach; swamp cabbage") is the first record of both this vegetable and of floating gardens.

Chinese spinach is a [[aquatic plant|semi-aquatic]] [[tropical plant]] grown, either in water or on wet ground, as a vegetable for its tender shoots and leaves. In southern China it is a very common and popular vegetable, and often escapes from cultivation (Li 1979: 71). 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Yung has leaves resembling the Lo-k'uei 落葵 but smaller in size. The nature is cold and the taste sweet. The southerners make rafts by weaving reeds, cutting into the raft small holes and floating it above the water. When seeds are planted in the water, they float above the water like duckweeds. When grown, the stems and leaves rise above the holes in the raft, which undulates with the water. This is a strange vegetable of the south. Yeh-ko 冶葛 has deadly poison. If juice of the Yung is dropped on the shoot of the latter, it withers instantly. According to traditions, Wei-wu 魏武 could eat Yeh-ko up to one foot in length. It is said that this is possible because he ate the vegetable first. (25, tr. Li 1979: 71) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
Wei Wu (魏武 "[Emperor] Wu of Wei") is the posthumous name of [[Cao Cao]] (155-220), the penultimate [[Chancellor (China)|Chancellor]] of the [[Eastern Han dynasty]] and founder of the [[Cao Wei]] dynasty (220-265). These plant references are ''luòkuí'' (落葵 lit. "falling [[Malvaceae|malva]]") ''[[Basella alba]]'' or redvine spinach and ''yěgé'' (冶葛 lit. "smelting kudzu") ''[[Gelsemium|Gelsemium elegans]]'' or heartbreak grass. ''Gelsemium'' is the subsequent ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' entry (26, tr. Li 1979: 72), which says, "Those who use this to poison people often give it mixed with other raw vegetables. If not discovered quickly and treated with an antidote, the one poisoned will die within half a day." ''Gelsemium'' roots contain the highly toxic [[alkaloid]] [[gelsemine]], which acts as a paralytic and often results in death. Later Chinese works repeatedly mention using Chinese spinach as an antidote for ''Gelsemium'', and in India, the juice of this plant is believed to have emetic properties and is used in opium poisoning (Li 1979: 72).

Chinese floating gardens are called ''fēngtián'' (葑田 "wild-rice fields") or ''jiàtián'' (架田 "frame fields"). Many texts, such as [[Xu Guangqi]]'s (1693) ''Nongzheng chuanshu'' (農政全書 "Complete Treatise on Agricultural Administration"), refer to floating gardens (Li 1979: 15-16). [[Wang Zhen (inventor)|Wang Zhen]]'s (1313) ''Nongshu'' (農書 "Treatise on Agriculture") describes wooden instead of reed rafts as Ji Han mentions. Wang Zhen explains that the frame is like a ''fá'' (筏 "[bamboo] raft"), and that ''fēng'' means the roots of the aquatic plant ''gū'' (箛 ''[[Zizania latifolia]]'', Manchurian wild rice). He says that floating fields are found more or less everywhere in Southeast China, and quotes a poem by [[Su Dongpo]] that describes floating fields on the [[West Lake]] at [[Hangzhou]]: "'The water drains away, the wild grass sprouts, and gradually a [''fengtian''] appears"  (tr. Needham and Bray 1964: 119).

The ''[[chinampas]]'', which have been used by the [[Aztecs]] on shallow lakes in the [[Valley of Mexico]] since the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Middle Postclassic period]] (1150-1350), are the best-known floating gardens (technically, [[artificial island]]s separated by canoe-width channels). Several countries in Asia have actual floating gardens. In China, they are found not only in the [[Huai River|Huai]] and [[Yangtze]] River area but also on [[Dian Lake]] in the [[Yunnan–Guizhou Plateau]]. Floating fields are also found on [[Kasumigaura, Ibaraki]] in Japan, [[Dal Lake]] in [[Kashmir]] (West 1950), and [[Inle Lake]] in [[Myanmar]] (Needham and Bray 1964: 121).

===Oranges===
The ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' has two entries (62 and 63) for ''[[Citrus]]'' trees: ''Jú'' (橘 ''[[Citrus × sinensis]]'', Sweet Orange) and ''Gān'' (柑 ''[[Citrus reticulata]]'', Mandarin Orange).
&lt;blockquote&gt;The Chü has white flowers and reddish fruits which have fragrant petals and a delicious taste. Since the time of Wu Ti of Han, there was a Minister of Oranges with a salary of two hundred ''shih'' [of rice], responsible for presenting oranges to the royal court. In the Huang-wu period of Wu (A.D. 222-229), Shih Hsieh 士燮, the Governor of Chiao-chih, once presented an orange specimen with seventeen fruits to one stalk, considered as a symbol of auspiciousness. The entire court entourage presented their congratulations. (62, tr. Li 1979: 118) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Shi Xie]] (137-226) was a Han dynasty Administrator of [[Jiaozhi]] [[Commandery (China)|commandery]] (present-day northern [[Vietnam]]). This story about Shi Xie sending as tribute a sweet orange plant with seventeen fruits to [[Sun Quan]] (r. 229-252), the founder of the [[Eastern Wu]] dynasty, is not recorded elsewhere, and Ma (1978: 243) believes it is a forgery based on the (492-493) ''[[Songshu]]'' history record that in 33I [[Yu Liang]] sent a sweet orange plant with twelve fruits to the [[Jin dynasty (265–420)|Jin dynasty]] court.

Li (1979: 119) notes that the ''[[Yiwu Zhi]]'' (quoted in the ''Qimin yaoshu'') may possibly be the original source for this ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' entry: "the orange tree has white flowers and reddish fruits, which have fragrant peels and also sweet taste. It is produced in Kiangnan and not elsewhere". The ''[[Taiping Yulan]]'' quotes this same passage followed by an additional sentence: "There is an orange grove in Chiao-chih, where an administrative officer is installed, with a salary of 300 ''shih'' (picul) [of rice], who is responsible for presenting an annual tribute of oranges to the royal court."

&lt;blockquote&gt;The Kan is a kind of orange with an exceptionally sweet and delicious taste. There are yellow and red kinds. The red ones are called Hu-kan 壺柑 (jar orange). In the market, the natives of Chiao-chih sell ants stored in bags of rush mats. The nests are like thin silk. The bags are all attached to twigs and leaves, which, with the ants inside the nests, are for sale. The ants are reddish-yellow in color, bigger than ordinary ants. In the south, if the Kan trees do not have this kind of ant, the fruits will all be damaged by many harmful insects and not a single fruit will be perfect. There are now two trees of Kan in the Hua-lin Garden. When in fruit, the Emperor has the court entourage wine and dine by their side and the fruits are picked and given to all. (63, tr. Li 1979: 118-119) &lt;/blockquote&gt;
''Húgān'' (壺柑) is now called ''pènggān'' (椪柑 ''Citrus poonensis'', [[ponkan]], Chinese honey orange"). Ma (1978: 243-244) says the first few sentences appear [[Zhou Chu]]'s (236-297) ''Fengtuji'' (風土記 "Record of Local Conditions"), which is the likely source for this ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' entry. Both [[Duan Chengshi]]'s (9th century) ''Yuyang zalu'' (酉陽雜俎) and the (early 10th century) Lingbiao luyi (嶺表錄異) retell the citrus ant story. 

A number of scholars say this ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' mandarin orange entry is the first reference in any literature to the entomological control of plant pests (e.g., Needham and Wang 1954: 118, Li 1979: 120), as well as the earliest example of a [[biological control agent]] as an article of commerce (Huang and Yang 1987: 66). 

The arboreal "citrus ant", ''[[Oecophylla smaragdina]]'', Chinese ''huángjīngyǐ'' (黃猄蟻 "yellow fear ant"), is a [[weaver ant]] that binds leaves and twigs together with silk to form tight nests in a tree. At night, the citrus ants retire into these nests, and during the day, they leave the nests and forage for various insects that attack the orange trees and their fruit. To take advantage of these ants, a citrus grower secures a nest on one tree, then connects it to adjacent trees with bamboo strips for bridges, enabling the citrus ants to travel to and build new nests in neighboring trees, and eventually colonize the whole orchard. In 1915, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] sent plant physiologist [[Walter Tennyson Swingle]] to China for research in varieties of orange resistant to [[citrus canker]]. In collaboration with George W. Groff and his students at [[Lingnan University (Guangzhou)|Lingnan University]] in [[Guangzhou]] (Groff and Howard 1925), they became the first Western scientists to encounter the cultivated citrus ant of southern China.

===Herb ferment===
The ''Cǎoqū'' (草麴, lit. "herb ferment") entry in the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' is the earliest description of [[wine production]] using a natural [[Fermentation#Etymology|ferment]] made with rice flour and herbs. In Southern Chinese tradition, this special [[rice wine]] was prepared in advance for marriage ceremonies while the daughter was still young.

The traditional [[fermentation starter]] for [[Wine in China|Chinese wine]] is called ''[[jiuqu|jiǔqū]]'' (酒麴 "wine ferment", [[compound (linguistics)|compounding]] ''jiǔ'' "wine; liquor" and ''qū'' "leaven; yeast") or ''jiǔyào'' (酒藥 "wine medicament", with ''yào'' "drug; medicine"), which is produced by inoculating a cereal dough with a previously-grown [[microbial culture]] (Needham and Huang 2000: 183). [[Yeast in winemaking]] is divided between natural, ambient [[Yeast in winemaking#Wild yeasts and natural fermentation|wild yeast]] (such as ''caoqu'') and cultured [[Yeast in winemaking#Inoculated yeast|inoculated yeast]] (such as ''jiuqu'').
&lt;blockquote&gt;In Nan-hai there are many fine wines, prepared not with yeast leaven but by pounding rice flour mixed with many kinds of herb leaves and soaked in the juice of Yeh-ko 冶葛. The dough, as big as an egg, is left in dense bushes under the shade. After a month, it is done, and is used to mix with glutinous rice to make wine. Thus if drunk heavily, even after awakening from intoxication, the head is hot and sweaty because there are poisonous herbs in it. Among the southerners, when a daughter reaches several years of age the family starts to brew wine on a large scale. After straining, and when the ponds become dry in the winter, the wine is put in jars, tightly sealed at the top and buried in the side of the ponds. When spring comes and the ponds are full of water, these jars are not removed. When the daughter is getting ready to be married, the pond edges are dug to remove the wine for use in feasting the guests at the marriage ceremony. It is called "girl's wine." The taste is exceedingly fine. (14, tr. Li 1979: 59)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Nanhai District|Nanhai]] (南海 "south sea", in [[Guangzhou]]) was the capital of the ancient [[Jiaozhou (region)|Jiaozhou]] province. ''Yěgé'' (冶葛) ''[[Gelsemium|Gelsemium elegans]]'' or Heartbreak grass is a famous poisonous plant of southern China.  Besides this "herb ferment" entry mentioning ''yege'', the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' has a ''yege'' entry (26), and mentions it in the Chinese spinach entry (25, see above). Li (1979: 60) notes that while the root contains poison, it is not clear whether ''caoqu'' used the leaves or the roots. ''Nǚjiǔ'' (女酒 lit. "women wine") first appears in the ''[[Zhouli]]'' ritual text meaning "female slave winemaker" who (in ''yin'' and ''yang'' gender separation) made wines for women in the royal palace, the staff of the Superintendent of Wines is said to include 10 eunuchs, 30 "wine-women", and 300 convicts (tr. Manjo 1991: 236).

Needham and Huang (2000: 261) suggest that since it took one month or the herbal rice-flour dough to become infected by fungi (presumably [[mycelia]]), the process was probably not easily reproducible in areas outside South China.

The tradition of preparing wines for marriage ceremonies while the daughter was still young continued in the [[Shaoxing]] region of [[Zhejiang]] province until at least the early 20th century. [[Shaoxing wine]] is a famous variety of ''[[huangjiu]]'' fermented from rice, and it originated in Shaoxing, an ancient city in the southern [[Yue (state)|Yue]] kingdom during the [[Warring States period]]. Qu Dajun's (17th century) ''Guangdong xinyu'' (廣東新語) confirmed that ''caoqu'' "herb ferment" was still used in the Guangdong area, and it was made from beans and rice mixed with plant materials such as ''shānjié'' (山桔 ''[[Glycosmis|Glycosmis citrifolia)]]''), ''làliǎo'' (辣蓼 ''[[Persicaria hydropiper]]''), and ''mǎliǎo'' (馬蓼 ''[[Persicaria lapathifolia]]'') (Li 1979: 60).

==Authenticity==
Academic controversies over the authenticity of Ji Han's ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' been ongoing for over a century.

The first scholar to question the text's authenticity was Wen Dingshi (文廷式, 1856-1904), who said Ji Han could not have been the author because the [[theriac]] entry (19, tr. Li 1979: 64) says the physician Liu Juanzi (劉涓子, fl. 410), "used this plant to prepare pills and after taking them, attained immortality"; which is likely a copyist's mistake for the Daoist Juanzi (涓子) mentioned in the (c. 1st century BCE) ''[[Liexian Zhuan]]'' (Ma 1978: 234).

There is no reference to the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' in Ji Han's ''Book of Jin'' biography, nor in the bibliographies of the (636) ''[[Book of Sui]]'' or (945) ''[[Old Book of Tang]]'', both of which do mention his collected works. The ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' title is first recorded in Tang Shenwei's (唐慎微, 1108) ''Zhenglei bencao'' (證類本草) and You Mou's (尤袤, 1180) ''Suichutang shumu'' (遂初堂書目). The oldest extant edition is in the (1273) ''Baichuan xuehai'' (百川學海), printed by Zuo Gui (左圭).

On one side of the debate, Ma (1978: 246) concludes the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' is unequivocally a forgery, compiled sometime between 1108, the year the ''Zhenglei bencao'' was first published, and 1194, the year You Mou died. On the other side, Needham, Lu, and Huang conclude (1986: 450) that basically Ji Han's "text is authentic, though there may have been some later interpolations."

Li (1979: 11-12) lists internal evidence that attests the historical validity of the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' text, or at least the major part of it. First, Ji Han used archaic and unusual names for certain plants instead of those which later became standard in the Tang and Song, for instance (45), ''jishexiang'' (雞舌香) instead of ''dingxiang'' (丁香) for [[clove]]s, indicating the antiquity of the text. Second, he wrote eight entries describing plants that later authors have never been able to identify. Third, Ji Han was occasionally confused regarding some plants where later botanists were not, for example (17), he mixed up ''[[Phrynium]]'' with ''[[Zingiber]]''. Fourth, he mentions contemporary events, such as ''[[Aquilaria]]'' bark-paper (56) being presented as tribute to [[Emperor Wu of Jin]] in 284. Li (1979: 13) concludes that although we cannot rule out the possibility of interpolations, we can be reasonably sure that the text, as it has come down to us in its present form since the late Song period, "represents on the whole a historically trustworthy account of the plants treated therein as they appeared in the southern regions around the third and fourth centuries".

Huang Xingzong's (1986) summary of the proceedings at an international symposium on the authenticity of the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' provides an overview of both sides in the debate: those who claim that the text is a 12th-century forgery compiled from early texts, and those who consider it a genuine 4th-century work with later interpolations. 

In the first category of bibliographical evidence (Huang 1986: 73), some argued at the symposium that there is no reason to believe that the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' existed before the Song dynasty when the title first appeared, and when it did occur in pre-Song literature, it was often called the ''Nanfang caowu zhuang''. Others responded that lack of citation in the dynastic histories, which was a common occurrence in Chinese literary history, does not necessarily mean that the book did not exist. Since Ji Han's preface explicitly said the book was compiled for the edification of his family, and not intended for public dissemination, it is not surprising that for generations its existence was not well known. Furthermore, there are unanswered questions (Huang 1986: 73). If the text suddenly first appeared in the Song dynasty, why did it not arouse the suspicion of learned bibliophiles? What would a forger gain by spending the time and effort necessary to compile such an admirable text but not accepting its authorship? Huang says the most reasonable hypothesis is that the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' appearance in a printed edition did not attract any special attention because it was common knowledge among the Song literati that Ji Han wrote the text in the 4th century. 

In the second category of textual comparisons, there are numerous ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' passages that are similar or identical to those on the same topics in other classical works about South China. Ma (1978) identified passages in books written between the 3rd and 12th centuries as "sources" for many ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' entries, for example, the ''Yiwu zhi'' was a probable sources for the banana and orange descriptions. Ma claimed that at least thirteen entries were copied from (early 10th century) ''Lingbiao luyi'' (岭表錄異), and seven from (875) ''Beihulu'' (北戶錄). Symposium scholars who rejected this plagiarism hypothesis contended that it is more reasonable to conclude that the "sources" were themselves copied from the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' without acknowledgement, as early Chinese authors so often did. Furthermore, [[Hui-lin Li]] gave the entries on [[Alpinia|wild ginger]] (5) and [[Castanopsis |chinkapin]] (73) as convincing examples. In the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' the descriptions make botanical sense, but the corresponding entries in ''Lingbiao luyi'', though almost identical in language, lack one or two key words needed to render them botanically meaningful, thus indicating that the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' author had an intimate knowledge of plants and knew what he was writing about, whereas the ''Lingbiao luyi'' compiler was copying blindly from the older text.

In the third category of philological considerations, several discrepancies in book titles, personal names, and historical events quoted in the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang'' have led scholars in China and the West to question its authenticity (Huang 1986: 75-76). [[Jasminum officinale|Jasmine]] (''yeximing'' 耶悉茗, from Arabic ''yasmin'') and [[Jasminum sambac|sambac]] (''moli'' 茉莉, from Sanskrit ''mallikā''), according to the ''Beihulu'', were introduced from Persia in 536, and therefore, could not have been known to Ji Han. In rebuttal, scholars cited evidence that jasmine was already well known in central China during the Jin dynasty, thus the mistake was in the ''Beihulu'', and not in the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang''.

The symposium participants reached consensus that the extant text contains interpolations by later writers, and probably first appeared in its current form during the Southern Song dynasty. Among the pro-forgery group, opinions about the date of fabrication varied considerably, perhaps Tang, Northern Song, or Southern Song. Huang (1986: 77) says, "Based on what is known about Ji Han's life, his literary attainments, his love of plants, and his interest in alchemy, those opposed to the forgery thesis believe that he is a likely author for the ''Nanfang caomu zhuang''."

The '''Novgorod First Chronicle''' ({{lang-ru|Новгородская первая летопись}}) or '''The Chronicle of Novgorod, 1016-1471'''&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTw8AAAAIAAJ&amp;q The Chronicle of Novgorod, 1016-1471]&lt;/ref&gt; is the most ancient extant chronicle of the [[Novgorod Republic]]. It reflects a tradition different from the [[Kievan Primary Chronicle]]. As was first demonstrated by [[Aleksey Shakhmatov]], the later editions of the chronicle reflect the lost Primary Kievan Code (Начальный Киевский свод) of the late 11th century, which contained much valuable data suppressed in the later Primary Chronicle.

The earliest extant copy of the chronicle is the so-called Synod Scroll, dated to the second half of the 13th century, first printed in 1841 and currently preserved in the [[State Historical Museum]]. It is the earliest known manuscript of a major East Slavic chronicle, predating the [[Laurentian Codex]] of the Primary Chronicle by almost a century. In the 14th century, the Synod Scroll was continued by the monks of the [[Yuriev Monastery]] in [[Novgorod]]. 

Other important copies of the Novgorod First Chronicle include the Academic Scroll (241 lists, 1444), Commission Scroll (320 lists, mid-15th century), Trinity Scroll (1563), and Tolstoy Scroll (208 lists, 1720s).

The '''''Polenlager''''' ({{IPA-de|ˈpoːlənˌlaːɡɐ}}, ''Polish Camps'') was a system of [[labor camps|labor]] and [[Nazi concentration camps]] in [[Silesia]] that held [[Poles]] during the [[World War II]] [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] [[occupation of Poland]]. The prisoners, originally destined for deportation across the border to the new semi-colonial [[General Government]] district, were sent to the ''Polenlager'' between 1942 and 1945, once the other locations became too overcrowded to accommodate the prisoners. 

There were over 30 ''Polenlager'' camps, mostly in Silesia.

==History==
All ''Polenlager'' camps were classified by the Germans as "labour reformatories". They were built near major military work-sites for the steady supply of slave labor. The camps had permanent German staff, augmented by captives and volunteers from other Eastern European countries (known as [[Hiwi (volunteer)|Hiwis]]). The Poles were delivered to ''Polenlagers'' by trainloads from German temporary transit camps, after they had been evicted from their homes to make way for new settlers (see: [[Action Saybusch]]). Some of the [[Silesians]] who were imprisoned there, refused to sign the [[Volksliste]] (DVL) or claim German nationality.&lt;ref name="Tomaszewski"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xYQvRapO7rcC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;dq=Polenlager&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m3-sT__XMqah6gG165HOBA&amp;ved=0CGEQuwUwCDgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Polenlager&amp;f=false | title=Labor camps – Polenlager | publisher=ABC-CLIO | work=Code Name Żegota: Rescuing Jews in Occupied Poland, 1942–1945 : the Most Dangerous Conspiracy in Wartime Europe | year=2010 | accessdate=May 10, 2012 | author=Irene Tomaszewski, Tecia Werbowski | pages=10– | isbn=9780313383915}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Davies"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DMoPXktGwiUC&amp;pg=PA456&amp;dq=Polenlager&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=m3-sT__XMqah6gG165HOBA&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwBjgU#v=onepage&amp;q=Polenlager&amp;f=false | title=Polenlager | publisher=Columbia University Press | work=God's Playground, a History of Poland: 1795 to the present | year=1982 | accessdate=May 10, 2012 | author=Norman Davies | pages=456– | isbn=0231053533}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Polenlager'' idea was part of Adolf Hitler's plan, known as ''[[Lebensraum]]'', which involved Germanization of all [[Polish areas annexed by Nazi Germany]] with the help of settlers from [[Bukovina]], Eastern [[Galicia (Eastern Europe)|Galicia]] and [[Volhynia]]. The main purpose of the [[Ethnic cleansing|forcible displacement]] of Poles was to create a German-only enclave known as ''[[Reichsgau Wartheland]]'' across the formerly Polish territories.&lt;ref name="projectinposterum"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.projectinposterum.org/docs/lucas2.htm | title=Chapter IV.

'''''Port Elizabeth Municipality v Various Occupiers''''' [2004] [http://www.saflii.org/za/cases/ZACC/2004/7.html ZACC 7] decided by the [[Constitutional Court of South Africa|Constitutional Court]] in [[2004 in South Africa|2004]], is an important case in [[South Africa]]n [[law]], with significance especially for post-[[apartheid]] [[property rights]] and constitutional supremacy. 

==Facts==
The case concerned the fate of a small group of people who had been unlawfully occupying some vacant, unused and private land in the jurisdiction of the municipality of [[Port Elizabeth]]. At the instance of the landowners and a large number of concerned locals, the municipality applied for their eviction.

It fell to the court to decide whether the eviction could go ahead under the circumstances. 

==Judgment==
The Constitutional Court found that the eviction could not go ahead. [[Albie Sachs|Sachs J]] made reference to the judiciary's "new task,"&lt;ref&gt;At para 23.&lt;/ref&gt; which was to manage "the counterpositioning of conventional rights of ownership against the new, equally relevant, right not to be arbitrarily deprived of a home, without creating hierarchies of privilege."&lt;ref&gt;Mostert &amp; Pope 15-16.&lt;/ref&gt; The statute relied upon by the municipality, the [[Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act]] (PIE), was found to require the courts to "infuse elements of grace and compassion into the formal structures of the law," and confirmed with the Constitution that "we are not islands unto ourselves," and that the courts are "called upon to balance competing interests in a principled way and promote the constitutional vision of a caring society based on good neighbourliness and shared concern." The [[Chapter 2 of the Constitution of South Africa|Bill of Rights]] in particular is "nothing if not a structured, institutionalised and operational declaration in our evolving new society of the need for human interdependence, respect and concern."&lt;ref&gt;At para 37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Significance==
The court's reasoning "represents a profound commentary on the way in which property law is to be understood in light of the Constitution."&lt;ref&gt;Mostert &amp; Pope 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21859">The '''RKM code''',&lt;ref name="IEC_60062_2016"/&gt; also referred to as "letter and digit&lt;!-- also: numeral --&gt; code for [[electrical resistance|resistance]] and [[capacitance]] values and tolerances" or "R notation", is a notation to specify [[resistor]] and [[capacitor]] values defined in the international standard '''IEC 60062''' (formerly '''IEC 62''') since 1952. It is also adopted by various other standards including '''DIN 40825''' (1973), '''BS 1852''' (1974), '''IS 8186''' (1976) and '''EN 60062''' (1993). The significantly updated '''IEC 60062:2016''' comprises the most recent release of the standard.&lt;ref name="IEC_60062_2016"/&gt;

==Overview==
Originally meant also as part [[marking code]], this shorthand notation is widely used in [[electrical engineering]] to denote the values of resistors and capacitors in [[circuit diagram]]s and in the production of [[electronic circuit]]s (for example in [[bills of material]] and in [[silk screen]]s). This method avoids overlooking the [[decimal separator]], which may not be rendered reliably on components or when duplicating documents.

The standards also define a ''[[color code for fixed resistors]]''.

For brevity, the notation omits to always specify the unit (ohm or farad) explicitly and instead relies on implicit knowledge raised from the usage of specific letters either only for resistors or for capacitors,&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Letter-M"/&gt; the case used (uppercase letters are typically used for resistors, lowercase letters for capacitors),&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Letter-Case"/&gt; a part's appearance, and the context.

The notation also avoids using a [[decimal separator]] and replaces it by a letter associated with the prefix symbol for the particular value.

This is not only for brevity (for example when printed on the part or PCB), but also to circumvent the problem that decimal separators tend to "disappear" when [[photocopy]]ing printed circuit diagrams.

The code letters are loosely related to the corresponding [[SI prefix]], but there are several exceptions, where the capitalization differs or alternative letters are used.

For example, &lt;tt&gt;8K2&lt;/tt&gt; indicates a resistor value of 8.2&amp;nbsp;kΩ. Additional zeros imply tighter tolerance, for example &lt;tt&gt;15M0&lt;/tt&gt;.

When the value can be expressed without the need for a prefix, an "R" is used instead of the decimal separator. For example, &lt;tt&gt;1R2&lt;/tt&gt; indicates 1.2&amp;nbsp;Ω, and &lt;tt&gt;18R&lt;/tt&gt; indicates 18&amp;nbsp;Ω.

For ''resistances'', the standard dictates the use of the uppercase letters &lt;tt&gt;L&lt;/tt&gt; (for 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt; (for 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1), &lt;tt&gt;K&lt;/tt&gt; (for 10&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt; (for 10&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt;), and &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; (for 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;) to be used instead of the decimal point.

The usage of the letter &lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt; instead of the SI unit symbol Ω for ohms stems from the fact that the Greek letter Ω wasn't (and still isn't) part of most [[character set]]s and therefore is sometimes impossible to reproduce, in particular in some CAD/CAM environments. The letter &lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt; was chosen because visually it loosely resembles the Ω glyph, and also because it works nicely as a [[mnemonic]] for ''r''esistance in many languages.

The letters &lt;tt&gt;G&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;T&lt;/tt&gt; weren't part of the first issue of the standard, which pre-dates the introduction of the [[SI system]] (hence the name "RKM code"), but were added after the adoption of the corresponding SI prefixes.

The introduction of the letter &lt;tt&gt;L&lt;/tt&gt; in more recent issues of the standard (instead of an [[SI prefix]] &lt;tt&gt;m&lt;/tt&gt; for [[milli-|milli]]) is justified to maintain the rule of only using uppercase letters for resistances (the otherwise resulting &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt; was already in use for [[mega-|mega]]).

Similar, the standard prescribes the following lowercase letters for ''capacitances'' to be used instead of the decimal point: &lt;tt&gt;p&lt;/tt&gt; (for 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; (for 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;tt&gt;µ&lt;/tt&gt; (for 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;), &lt;tt&gt;m&lt;/tt&gt; (for 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt;), but uppercase &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt; (for 10&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; = 1) for [[farad]].

The letters &lt;tt&gt;p&lt;/tt&gt; and &lt;tt&gt;n&lt;/tt&gt; weren't part of the first issue of the standard, but were added after the adoption of the corresponding SI prefixes.

In cases where the Greek letter &lt;tt&gt;µ&lt;/tt&gt; is not available, the standard allows it to be replaced by &lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;U&lt;/tt&gt;, when only uppercase letters are available). This usage of &lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;µ&lt;/tt&gt; is also in line with [[ISO 2955]] (1974,&lt;ref name="ISO_2955-1974"/&gt; 1983&lt;ref name="ISO_2955-1983"/&gt;), [[DIN 66030]] (Vornorm 1973;&lt;ref name="Vornorm_DIN_66030_1973"/&gt; 1980,&lt;ref name="DIN_66030_1980"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Computerwoche_1981_DIN"/&gt; 2002&lt;ref name="DIN_66030:2002-05"/&gt;) and [[BS 6430]] (1983), which allow the prefix &lt;tt&gt;μ&lt;/tt&gt; to be substituted by the letter &lt;tt&gt;u&lt;/tt&gt; (or &lt;tt&gt;U&lt;/tt&gt;) in circumstances in which only the [[Latin alphabet]] is available.

==Notes==
{{reflist|group="nb"|refs=
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Letter-M"&gt;The letter &lt;tt&gt;M&lt;/tt&gt; was an exception to the rule that all different letters are supposed to be used for resistances and capacitances. Today, a lowercase letter &lt;tt&gt;m&lt;/tt&gt; should be used for capacitances whenever possible to avoid confusion.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Letter-Case"&gt;In old issues of the IEC 60062 standard, uppercase Latin letters were not only used for resistances, but also for capacitance values, whereas newer issues specifically use lowercase letters for capacitors (except for the special case of &lt;tt&gt;F&lt;/tt&gt;).&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Letter-k"&gt;The IEC 60062 standard prescribes the usage of an uppercase Latin letter &lt;tt&gt;K&lt;/tt&gt; only, however, a lowercase &lt;tt&gt;k&lt;/tt&gt; is often seen in [[schematic]]s and [[bill of material|bills of material]]s probably because the corresponding [[SI prefix]] is defined as a lowercase &lt;tt&gt;k&lt;/tt&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref group="nb" name="NB_Letter-E"&gt;The usage of the Latin letter &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt; instead of &lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt; is not standardized in IEC 60062, but nevertheless sometimes seen in practice. It stems from the fact, that &lt;tt&gt;R&lt;/tt&gt; is used in symbolic names for resistors as well, and it is also used in a similar fashion but with incompatible meaning in other part marking codes. It may therefore cause confusion in some contexts. Visually, the letter &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt; loosely resembles a small Greek letter [[omega]] (ω) turned sideways. Historically (f.e. in pre-[[WWII]] documents), before [[Ohm (unit)|ohm]]s were denoted using the uppercase Greek omega (Ω), a small omega (ω) was sometimes used for this purpose as well, as in 56&lt;sup&gt;ω&lt;/sup&gt; for 56&amp;nbsp;Ω. However, the letter &lt;tt&gt;E&lt;/tt&gt; is conflictive with the similar looking but incompatible [[E notation]] in engineering, and it may therefore cause considerable confusion as well.&lt;!--

{{refimprove|date=March 2017}}

A '''record chart''', also called a '''music chart''', is a ranking of [[Sound recording and reproduction|recorded music]] according to certain criteria during a given period of time. Many different criteria are used in different charts, including [[record sales]], the amount of radio [[airplay]], and since the popularity of the Internet for music, the number of [[music download|downloads]] and the amount of [[streaming media|streaming]] activity.

Some charts are specific to a particular [[musical genre]] and most to a particular geographical location (although download charts are not easily pinned down in this way). The most common period of time covered by a chart is one week with the chart being printed or broadcast at the end of this time. Summary charts for years and decades are then calculated from their component weekly charts. Component charts have become an increasingly important way to measure the commercial success of individual songs.

==Chart hit==
A ''chart hit'' is a recording, identified by its inclusion in a chart that uses sales or other criteria to rank popular releases, that ranks highly in popularity compared to other songs in the same time frame. ''Chart-topper'' and related terms (like ''number one'', ''No. 1 hit'', ''top of the charts'', ''chart hit'', and so forth) are widely used in common conversation and in marketing, and are loosely defined. Because of its value in promoting recording artists and releases, both directly to the consumer, and by encouraging exposure on radio, TV other media, chart positioning has long been a subject of scrutiny and controversy. Chart compilation methodology and data sources vary, ranging from "buzz charts" (based on opinions of various experts and [[:wiktionary:tastemaker|tastemaker]]s), to charts that reflect empirical data such as retail sales. Therefore, a ''chart-topper'' may be anything from an "insiders' pick" to a runaway seller. Most charts that are used to determine extant mainstream popularity rely on measurable data.

Record chart performance is inherently relative, as they rank songs, albums and records in comparison to each other at the same time, as opposed to [[music recording sales certification]] methods, which are measured in absolute numbers. Comparing the chart positions of songs at different times thus does not provide an accurate comparison of a song's overall impact. The nature of most charts, particularly weekly charts, also favors songs that sell very well for a brief period of time; thus, a song that is only briefly popular may chart higher than a song that sells more copies in the long range, but more slowly. As a result, a band's biggest hit single may not be its best-selling single.

According to [[Joel Whitburn]], the American trade publication ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' introduced the [[Billboard Hot 100|Hot 100]] on August 4, 1958.  This was the first chart in the US to "fully integrate the hottest-selling and most-played pop singles."&lt;ref name=whitburn&gt;{{cite book|first=Joel|last=Whitburn|year=2003|title=Top Pop Singles 1955-2002|edition= 1st|publisher=Record Research Inc.|location=Menomonee Falls, Wisconsin|isbn= 0-89820-155-1|page=xi-xiii}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From 1958 until 1991, ''Billboard'' compiled the chart from playlists reported by radio stations, and surveys of retail sales outlets.  Before 1958, several charts were published, including "Best Sellers in Stores", "Most Played by Jockeys" (later revived under the name [[Hot 100 Airplay]]), and "Most Played in Juke Boxes", and, in later collations of chart hits, the record's highest placing in any of those charts was usually reported.  On November 30, 1991, ''Billboard'' introduced a new method of determining the Hot 100, "by a combination of actual radio airplay monitored electronically by [[Nielsen Broadcast Data Systems]] (BDS), additional playlists from small-market stations, and actual point-of-sale information provided by Nielsen SoundScan."&lt;ref name=whitburn/&gt;  Until 1998, any songs placed on the chart had to be physically available as a [[single (record)|single]].&lt;ref name=whitburn/&gt; The Hot 100 continues to be published.

==Other terminology==
There are several commonly used terms when referring to a music/entertainment chart or the performance of a release thereon.

A ''new entry'' is a title which is making its début in that chart. This is applied to all charts, for instance a track which is outside the Top 40 but which later climbs into that level of the chart is considered to be a 'new entry' to the Top 40 that week. In most official charts, tracks have to have been on sale for a period of time in order to enter the charts; however, in some retailers' charts, new releases are included in charts as 'new entries' without a sales history in order to make them more visible to purchasers. A real ''new entry'' is a title that makes its chart début, no matter how many positions officially the chart actually is. In the UK the official published chart is a Top 100 although a new entry can take place between positions 101-200 (this is also true of the Billboard Hot 100, which has a "[[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles|bubbling under]]" addendum for new songs that have not yet made the Hot 100). The Top 40 is only used for radio to shorten the play-lists.

A ''re-entry'' is a track which has previously entered a chart falls out of that chart and then later re-appears in it. This may come about if a release is reissued or if there is a surge of interest in the track. Generally any repeat entry of a track into a chart is considered a re-entry, unless the later version of the track is a materially different recording or significantly repackaged (such as Michael Jackson's "Thriller 25"), where the release would normally be considered separate and thus a "new" entry.

A ''climber'' is a release which is going higher in the chart week-on-week. Because chart positions are generally relative to each other on a week-to-week basis, a release does not necessarily have to increase sales week-to-week to be a climber, as if releases ahead of it decline in sales sufficiently they may slip below it. By the same metric, not all week-to-week sales increases result in a climber, if other releases improve by a sufficient amount to keep it from climbing. The term ''highest climber'' is used to denote the release making the biggest leap upwards in the chart that week. There is generally not an equivalent phrase for tracks going down the chart; the term "faller" is occasionally used, but not as widely as 'climber'.

The ''top 10'', ''top 20'' and so forth are used to determine the relative success of a release. For instance, a track may be referred to as a 'top 10 hit' if it reaches a position between 1 and 10 on the singles chart, as a 'top 20 hit' if it reaches between positions 1 and 20, and so on. The most commonly known chart is the 'top 40' widely used by the media in various territories, though it is common for longer lists to be produced for or by the music industry. For example, in the UK, the [[Official Charts Company]] produces a top 200, although various media only publish shorter lists.

A ''[[one-hit wonder]]'' is an act that appears on the chart just once. The term ''true one-hit wonder'' was the term given by Guinness Book of British Hit Singles &amp; Albums (and also the Billboard book Top Pop Singles) is an act that has one number one hit and nothing else on the chart ever. If an act appears in some other form, (for example) a solo act that appears with a band or with other acts then these are taken separately.

'''''Sky Sports Football Yearbook''''' (formerly '''''Rothmans Football Yearbook''''') is a British [[association football|football]] reference book published annually by [[Headline (publisher)|Headline]] (a division of [[Hodder Headline]]). It was first published in 1970 for the [[1970–71 in English football|1970–71]] season, its first compilers being Tony Williams and Roy Peskett,&lt;ref&gt;[[Soccerama]] 02, p118&lt;/ref&gt; and has released its 43rd edition. For many years the editors were father and daughter Jack and Glenda Rollin.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.4sportsbooks.co.uk/?page=showreviews&amp;book_id=185 Sports Book of the Month.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The Rollins' involvement ended with the 2012-13 edition,&lt;ref&gt;[[Soccerama]] 02, p119&lt;/ref&gt; with the parting somewhat acrimonious.&lt;ref&gt;[[Soccerama]] 02, p119&lt;/ref&gt;

The book contains statistical information on the previous season in English football, including all results, appearances, goalscorers and transfers for the [[Premier League]], [[Football League]], [[Conference National]], [[Scottish Premier League]] and [[Scottish Football League]], as well as selected historical records for each club and all major competitions. It also contains less detailed information on football in [[Football in Wales|Wales]] and [[Association football in Northern Ireland|Northern Ireland]], [[non-League football]] and [[women's football in England]], European nations' national league tables, and international competitions. The current edition runs to 1056 pages.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.co.uk/Sky-Sports-Football-Yearbook-2012-2013/dp/0755363566/ref=pd_sim_sbs_b_3&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2018 it was reported that the future of the book was in doubt after Sky Sports withdrew their sponsorship, believed to be around £30,000 per year.

It was sponsored by the tobacco company [[Rothmans International|Rothmans]] from its inception until the 2002–03 edition, after which they withdrew due to pending United Kingdom legislation restricting [[tobacco advertising|tobacco sponsorship]] in sport.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chapter closes for Rothmans|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article880145.ece|publisher=The Times|author=Bill Edgar|date=February 17, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sky Sports]] took over as the new sponsors from the 2003–04 edition onwards.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/sport/general/new-identities-play-havoc-in-the-name-game-just-ask-miss-evertmrslloydishouldsay-540791.html The Independent: New identities play havoc in the name game, just ask Miss Evert-Mrs-Lloyd-I-should-say]&lt;/ref&gt;

From 2018/19 season the book will be sponsored by The Sun newspaper.

{{Spiritualism|main}}
A '''spirit''' is a [[supernatural]] being, often, but not exclusively, a [[non-physical entity]]; such as a [[ghost]], [[fairy]], or [[angel]].&lt;ref name="polysemy"/&gt; The concepts of a person's spirit and [[soul]], often also overlap, as both are either [[Mind-body dualism|contrasted with]] or [[Idealism|given ontological priority over]] the [[Human body|body]] and both are believed to survive bodily death in some religions,&lt;ref&gt;OED "spirit 2.a.: The soul of a person, as commended to God, or passing out of the body, in the moment of death."&lt;/ref&gt; and "spirit" can also have the sense of "[[ghost]]", i.e. a manifestation of the spirit of a deceased person. In [[Bible translations into English|English Bibles]], "the Spirit" (with a capital "S"), specifically denotes the [[Holy Spirit]].

Spirit is often used [[metaphysically]] to refer to the [[consciousness]] or [[personality]].

Historically, it was also used to refer to a "subtle" as opposed to "gross" material substance, as in the famous last paragraph of [[Sir Isaac Newton]]'s ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia Mathematica]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burtt|first1=Edwin A.|title=Metaphysical Foundations of Modern Physical Science|date=2003|publisher=Dover Publications, Inc|location=Mineola, New York|page=275|accessdate=7 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
The English word "spirit" comes from the [[Latin]] ''spiritus'',but also "spirit, soul, courage, vigor", ultimately from a [[Proto-Indo-European language|Proto-Indo-European]] ''*(s)peis''. It is distinguished from Latin ''anima'', "[[soul]]" (which nonetheless also derives from an Indo-European root meaning "to breathe", earliest form ''*h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;enh&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-'').&lt;ref&gt;'''anə-''', from *''ə&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;enə&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;-''. Watkins, Calvert. 2000. ''The American Heritage&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', second edition. Boston: Houghton-Mifflin Co., p.4. Also [https://web.archive.org/web/20071208010420/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE17.html available online]. (NB: Watkins uses '''ə&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''ə&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''ə&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''' as fully equivalent variants for '''h&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''h&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;''', '''h&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;''', respectively, for the notation of Proto-Indo-European [[Laryngeal theory|laryngeal segments]].)&lt;/ref&gt; In Greek, this distinction exists between ''[[pneuma]]'' ({{lang|grc|πνεῦμα}}), "breath, motile air, spirit," and ''[[Psyche (psychology)|psykhē]]'' ({{lang|grc|ψυχή}}), "soul"&lt;ref name="polysemy"&gt;[[#polysemy|François 2009]], p.187-197.&lt;/ref&gt; (even though the latter term, {{lang|grc|ψῡχή}} = ''psykhē/psūkhē'', is also from an Indo-European root meaning "to breathe": ''*bhes-'', [[Zero grade#Zero grade|zero grade]] ''*bhs-'' [[Consonant voicing and devoicing|devoicing]] in [[Proto-Greek language#Proto-Greek changes|proto-Greek]] to ''*phs-'', resulting in historical-period Greek ''ps-'' in ''psūkhein'', "to breathe", whence ''psūkhē'', "spirit", "soul").&lt;ref&gt;'''''bhes-'''''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Watkins, Calvert. 2000. ''The American Heritage&lt;sup&gt;®&lt;/sup&gt; Dictionary of Indo-European Roots'', second edition. Boston: Houghton-Mifflin Co., 2000, p.11. Also [https://web.archive.org/web/20071208011042/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE60.html available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

The word "spirit" came into [[Middle English]] via [[Old French]]. The distinction between soul and spirit also developed in the [[Abrahamic religions]]: Arabic ''nafs'' ({{lang|ar|نفس}}) opposite ''rūħ'' ({{lang|ar|روح}}); Hebrew ''neshama'' ({{Hebrew|נְשָׁמָה}} ''nəšâmâh'') or ''[[nephesh]]'' {{Hebrew|נֶ֫פֶשׁ}} ''nép̄eš'' (in Hebrew ''neshama'' comes from the root ''NŠM'' or "breath") opposite ''ruach'' ({{Hebrew|רוּחַ}} ''rúaħ''). (Note, however, that in Semitic just as in Indo-European, this dichotomy has not ''always'' been as neat historically as it has come to be taken over a long period of development: Both {{Hebrew|נֶ֫פֶשׁ}} (root {{Hebrew|נפשׁ}}) and {{Hebrew|רוּחַ}} (root {{Hebrew|רוח}}), as well as cognate words in various Semitic languages, including Arabic, also preserve meanings involving misc. air phenomena: "breath", "wind", and even "odour").&lt;ref&gt;Koehler, L., Baumgartner, W., Richardson, M. E. J., &amp; Stamm, J. J. (1999). The Hebrew and Aramaic lexicon of the Old Testament (electronic ed.) (711). Leiden; New York: E.J. Brill.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brown, F., Driver, S.

== Spiritual and metaphysical usage ==
In spiritual and metaphysical terms, "spirit" has acquired a number of meanings:
* An [[incorporeal]] but ubiquitous, non-quantifiable substance or [[Energy (spirituality)|energy]] present individually in all living things.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Unlike the concept of souls (often regarded as eternal and sometimes believed to pre-exist the body) a spirit develops and grows as an integral aspect of a living being.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.patheos.com/Library/Mormonism/Beliefs/Human-Nature-and-the-Purpose-of-Existence.html|title=Human Nature and the Purpose of Existence|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A [[Daemon (mythology)|daemon]], [[sprite (creature)|sprite]], or [[ghost]]. People usually conceive of a ghost as a wandering spirit from a being no longer living, having survived the death of the body yet maintaining at least vestiges of [[mind]] and [[consciousness]].l
* In [[religion]] and [[spirituality]], the [[Respiration (physiology)|respiration]] of a human has for obvious reasons become seen as strongly linked with the very occurrence of life. Spirit, in this sense, means the thing that separates a living body from a corpse&amp;mdash;and usually implies [[intelligence]], [[consciousness]], and [[sentience]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}}
* [[Latter-day Saint]] prophet [[Joseph Smith Jr.]] taught that the concept of spirit as incorporeal or without substance was incorrect: "There is no such thing as immaterial matter. All spirit is matter, but it is more fine or pure, and can only be discerned by purer eyes."&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/131?lang=eng 131:7]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Various forms of [[animism]], such as Japan's [[Shinto]] and [[African traditional religion]], focus on invisible beings that represent or connect with plants, animals, or [[landform]]s ([[kami]]){{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}: translators usually employ the English word "spirit" when trying to express the idea of such entities.
* Individual spirits envisaged as interconnected with all other spirits and with "The Spirit" (singular and [[capitalization|capitalized]]).{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} This concept relates to theories of a unified [[spirituality]], to [[universal consciousness]] and to some concepts of [[Deity]]. In this scenario all separate "spirits", when connected, form a greater unity, the Spirit, which has an identity separate from its elements plus a [[consciousness]] and [[intellect]] greater than its elements; an ultimate, unified, [[nondualism|non-dual]] awareness or [[force]] of [[life]] combining or transcending all individual units of consciousness. The [[experience]] of such a connection can become a primary basis for [[supernatural|spiritual]] [[belief]]. The term ''spirit'' occurs in this sense in (to name but a few) [[Anthroposophy]], [[Aurobindo]], ''[[A Course In Miracles]],'' [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Ken Wilber]], and [[Meher Baba]] (though in his teachings, "spirits" are only ''apparently'' separate from each other and from "The Spirit.")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kalchuri, Bhau |url=http://www.lordmeher.org/ |title=Meher Prabhu |trans-title=Lord Meher |volume=Eighteen |publisher=Manifestation, Inc. |year=1986 |page=5937}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this use, the term seems conceptually identical to [[Plotinus|Plotinus's]] "[[Absolute (philosophy)|The One]]" and [[Friedrich Schelling|Friedrich Schelling's]] "[[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]]". Similarly, according to the [[panentheism|panentheistic]]/[[pantheism|pantheistic]] view, Spirit equates to [[essence]] that can manifest itself as [[mind]]/[[soul]] through any level in pantheistic [[hierarchy]]/[[holarchy]], such as through a mind/soul of a single cell (with very primitive, elemental consciousness), or through a human or animal mind/soul (with [[consciousness]] on a level of organic synergy of an individual human/animal), or through a (superior) mind/soul with synergetically extremely complex/sophisticated consciousness of whole galaxies involving all sub-levels, all emanating (since the superior mind/soul operates non-dimensionally, or trans-dimensionally) from the one Spirit.
* Christian [[Spirituality|spiritual]]  [[theology]] can use the term "Spirit" to describe [[God]], or aspects of God — as in the "[[Holy Spirit]]", referring to a [[Triune God]] ([[Trinity]]) (cf. [[Gospel of Matthew]] 28:19).
* [[Pneumatology]] is the study of [[spirituality|spiritual beings]] and phenomena, especially the spiritual aspect of human beings and the interactions between humans and [[God]].
* [[Christian Science]] uses "Spirit" as one of seven synonyms for [[God]], as in: "Principle; Mind; Soul; Spirit; Life; Truth; Love"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eddy |first=Mary Baker |authorlink=Mary Baker Eddy |title=[[Science and Health With Key to the Scriptures]] |format=txt |accessdate=2009-03-11 |year=1875 |page=587 |chapter=Glossary |chapter-url=http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext02/shkts11.txt |quote='''GOD''' &amp;mdash; The great I AM; the all-knowing, all-seeing, all-acting, all-wise, all-loving, and eternal; Principle; Mind; Soul; Spirit; Life; Truth; Love; all substance; intelligence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to [[C. G. Jung]] (in a lecture delivered to the literary Society of Augsburg, 20&amp;nbsp;October 1926, on the theme of “Nature and Spirit”): 
{{quote|The connection between spirit and life is one of those problems involving factors of such complexity that we have to be on our guard lest we ourselves get caught in the net of words in which we seek to ensnare these great enigmas. For how can we bring into the orbit of our thought those limitless complexities of life which we call "Spirit" or "Life" unless we clothe them in verbal concepts, themselves mere counters of the intellect? The mistrust of verbal concepts, inconvenient as it is, nevertheless seems to me to be very much in place in speaking of fundamentals. "Spirit" and "Life" are familiar enough words to us, very old acquaintances in fact, pawns that for thousands of years have been pushed back and forth on the thinker's chessboard. The problem must have begun in the grey dawn of time, when someone made the bewildering discovery that the living breath which left the body of the dying man in the last death-rattle meant more than just air in motion. It can scarcely be an accident [[onomatopoeic]] words like ''ruach'' ([[Hebrew]]), ''ruch'' ([[Arabic]]), ''roho'' ([[Swahili language|Swahili]]) mean ‘spirit’ no less clearly than ''πνεύμα'' (''pneuma'', [[Greek language|Greek]]) and ''spiritus'' ([[Latin language|Latin]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=C. G. |last=Jung |author-link=Carl G. Jung |editor-last1=Hull |editor-first1=R. F. C. |title=The Collected Works of C. G. Jung |volume=8 |chapter =Spirit and Life |date=1960 |publisher=Pantheon Books for Bollinger |series=XX |location=New York, NY |pages=319–320 |accessdate=12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
* [[Parapsychology|Psychical research]], "In all the publications of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] the term ‘spirit’ stands for ''the personal [[Stream of consciousness (psychology)|stream of consciousness]]'' whatever else it may ultimately be proved to imply or require" ([[James H. Hyslop]], 1919).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hyslop |first1=James Hervey |title=Contact with the Other World |date=1919 |publisher=The Century Co. |location=New York, NY |page=11 |edition=First |accessdate=28 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[mysticism]]: existence in unity with [[Divinity|Godhead]].{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} Soul may also equate with spirit, but the soul involves a certain individual human consciousness, while spirit comes from beyond that. Compare the psychological teaching of [[Al-Ghazali#Psychology|Al-Ghazali]].

==Related concepts==
{{See also|Holy Spirit|Ruach HaKodesh}}
Similar concepts in other languages include Greek ''[[pneuma]]'' and Sanskrit ''[[akasha]] / [[Ātman (Hinduism)|atman]]''&lt;ref name=polysemy/&gt; (see also ''[[prana]]''). Some languages use a word for ''spirit'' often closely related (if not synonymous) to ''[[mind]]''. Examples include the German ''[[Geist]]'' (related to the English word ''ghost'') or the French ''l'esprit''. English versions of the [[Bible]] most commonly translate the Hebrew word ''ruach'' (רוח; ''wind'') as "the spirit", whose essence is divine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.biblicalheritage.org/Bible%20Studies/ruach.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151006125829/http://www.biblicalheritage.org/Bible%20Studies/ruach.htm |archive-date=2015-10-06 |title=Ruach: Spirit or Wind or ??? |website=BiblicalHeritage.org |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatively, Hebrew texts commonly use the word ''[[nephesh]]''. [[Kabbalah|Kabbalists]] regard ''nephesh'' as one of the five parts of the Jewish [[soul]], where ''nephesh'' (animal) refers to the physical being and its animal instincts. Similarly, [[Scandinavian languages|Scandinavian]], [[Baltic languages|Baltic]], and [[Slavic languages|Slavic]] languages, as well as [[Chinese language|Chinese]] ([[qi|气 ''qi'']]), use the words for ''breath'' to express concepts similar to "the spirit".&lt;ref name=polysemy/&gt;

==Career==
Ross began his career as a tax attorney at [[Coopers &amp; Lybrand]] in [[Detroit]]. In 1968, he moved to New York City and accepted a position as an assistant vice president in the real estate subsidiary of [[G. H. Walker &amp; Co.|Laird Inc.]] and then worked in the corporate finance department of [[Bear Stearns]]. In 1972, he left employment and living off $10,000 lent to him by his mother,&lt;ref name=UMGift&gt;[http://www.bus.umich.edu/NewsRoom/BusinessSchoolPubs/DividendAlumniMagazine/Fall_2004/StephenMRoss.pdf University of Michigan: "Two Men, One Vision - With $100 Million Gift, Steve Ross] Retrieved March 23, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; he utilized his federal tax law knowledge to organize deals for wealthy investors allowing them to shelter income with the generous incentives granted by the federal government to promote the construction of federally subsidized affordable housing.&lt;ref name=UMGift /&gt; He was very successful, earning $150,000 in his first year,&lt;ref name=UMGift /&gt; and he was soon arranging more complicated transactions. Using his earnings along with his newfound experience, he started to develop real estate on his own and with an emphasis on high-quality architecture and engineering, he quickly earned a solid reputation in the American real estate arena. With a focus on the northeastern United States and Florida, he developed apartments, condominiums, retail, office parks and mixed-use developments. In 1972, he founded [[The Related Companies]], a real estate development company.&lt;ref name=investing-businessweek-profile&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen M.

===Miami Dolphins===
In February 2008, Ross bought 50 percent of the Miami Dolphin franchise, Dolphin Stadium (now known as Hard Rock Stadium) and surrounding land from then-owner [[Wayne Huizenga]] for $550 million, with an agreement to later become the Dolphins' managing general partner. On January 20, 2009, Ross closed on the purchase of an additional 45% of the team from Wayne Huizenga. The total value of the deal was $1.1 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cbs4.com/sports/Stephen.Ross.dolphins.2.913395.html |title=Ross Becomes Miami Dolphins Majority Owner |publisher=CBS |date=2009-01-20 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=3847012 |title=Ross, Huizenga complete Fins sale |agency=Associated Press |publisher=ESPN |date=2009-01-21 |accessdate=2010-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means Ross is now the owner of 95% of both the franchise and the stadium.  Ross announced his intention to keep [[Bill Parcells]] as the director of football operations.&lt;ref name="sportsillustrated.cnn.com"/&gt;  Parcells later stepped down from his position shortly before the 2010 NFL season.  Since buying the Dolphins, Ross has brought in [[Gloria Estefan]], [[Marc Anthony]], [[Venus Williams]], and [[Serena Williams]], as minority owners of the team.  In 2013, Ross made a push to obtain multimillion-dollar public funding from the state of Florida and Miami-Dade taxpayers to help renovate Hard Rock Stadium, the Dolphins' home field. After this effort failed in the Florida legislature, a team spokesman said that Ross does not intend to move the team but that under an eventual future owner the Dolphins' future in the Miami area is bleak.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9246386/miami-dolphins-pay-stadium-fixes-ceo-mike-dee |title=Fins Future in Miami Bleak |publisher=ESPN |date=2013-05-06 |accessdate=2013-05-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Ross said he intends to keep the Dolphins "in town", there has been speculation that the team may seek to move out of Miami to a nearby locale such as Palm Beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2013/05/10/3389294/miami-dolphins-open-minded-to.html |title=Dolphins Open to Stadium in Palm Beach |work=The Miami Herald |date=2013-05-09 |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://blogs.miaminewtimes.com/riptide/2013/05/roger_goodell_we_want_dolphins.php |title=Roger Goodell: 'We Want Dolphins to Stay in Miami{{'-}} |work=Miami New Times |date=2013-05-10 |accessdate=2013-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civic and philanthropic activities==
Ross was co-chair of the [[University of Michigan]]'s fund raising campaign, which was completed May 2007.

In 2004, Ross made the single largest contribution (at the time) to the University of Michigan by donating $100 million to the school.&lt;ref name="bus.umich.edu" /&gt; The University renamed its business school, [[Ross School of Business]] in his honor. On September 12, 2013, it was announced Ross had committed an additional $200 million gift to the University, to be distributed equally among the Ross School of Business and the University's athletic department. It replaced [[Charlie Munger]]'s 2013 contribution of $115 million as the largest single gift in the University's history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stephen Ross tosses University of Michigan $200 million donation|url=http://www.heritage.com/articles/2013/09/12/ann_arbor_journal/news/doc52308a3edd1eb346969898.txt|publisher=Ann Arbor Journal|accessdate=13 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;. On September 20, 2017, Ross donated an additional 50 million to the University of Michigan, the majority of which would support career development programs for students, innovative action-based learning experiences, and resources for attracting and developing junior faculty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Guest|first1=Greta|title=Stephen Ross gives additional $50 million to U-M, bringing total lifetime giving to $378 million|url=http://ns.umich.edu/new/releases/25095-stephen-ross-gives-additional-50-million-to-u-m-bringing-total-lifetime-giving-to-378-million|accessdate=20 September 2017|publisher=University of Michigan News|date=20 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He was on the executive committee of NYC2012, New York's initiative to bring the summer Olympic Games to New York City in 2012, which failed when London won. Ross is chairman of Equinox Holdings, and chairperson emeritus of the [[Real Estate Board of New York]] (REBNY), the city's leading real estate trade association. As a member of the board of trustees of the [[Solomon R. Guggenheim Foundation]], Ross was involved in the planning of a major renovation of the [[Frank Lloyd Wright]] iconic building and other new museums. He is a trustee of [[New York Presbyterian Hospital]], the [[Urban Land Institute]], the NY Chapter of [[Juvenile Diabetes Research Foundation International]], the [[Levin Institute]] and is a director of the [[Jackie Robinson Foundation]] and the [[World Resources Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[[World Resources Institute]] [http://www.wri.org/about/board/stephen-ross Biosketch of Stephen M. Ross]. Accessed March 27, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; He also serves on the Executive Committee and is a trustee of [[Lincoln Center]].

Ross was a major supporter and contributor to the 2012 presidential campaign of [[Mitt Romney presidential campaign, 2012|Mitt Romney]].&lt;ref name=JewishDailyForward /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/sites/lauriebennett/2012/02/01/billionaires-give-2-million-to-romney-super-pac/ Forbes: "Billionaires Give $2 Million to Romney Super PAC" by Laurie Bennett] February 1, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

He serves on the Board for the [[Cornell Tech]] Campus,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://tech.cornell.edu/people/board-of-overseers|title=Board of Overseers|website=Cornell Tech|language=en|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; a $2B redevelopment of Roosevelt Island including the Joan &amp; Irwin Jacobs Technion-Cornell Institute, a partnership between [[Cornell University]] and the [[Technion – Israel Institute of Technology]] that when completed will house several thousand post-graduate students, hundreds of faculty, and a high-tech business incubator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ny.curbed.com/2016/3/2/11147898/tech-hub-the-bridge-tops-out-at-cornell-roosevelt-island-campus|title=Tech Incubator at Cornell's Roosevelt Island Campus Tops Out|date=2016-03-02|website=Curbed NY|access-date=2017-05-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 27, 2017, Ross cast the only "no" vote in the NFL owners' 31–1 "yes" decision on the [[Oakland Raiders]] request for approval to move to Las Vegas starting in the 2019 season. Ross said he had no personal problems with Raiders owner [[Mark Davis (American football)|Mark Davis]] and wished the franchise well, but did not think the Raiders did everything they could to stay in Oakland, and also that having 3 teams move within only 15 months (the Rams and Chargers both moved to Los Angeles) was not good for players or fans. Ross also stated prior to his Dolphins playing the Chargers in their first home game since the move to Los Angeles that he did not believe that Chargers owner Dean Spanos made his best effort to stay in San Diego, making him a popular figure with the betrayed San Diego fan base.

Ross invested in a partnership named RERI that was donated to the University of Michigan in 2003.  RERI obtained its own appraisal for the donation in the amount of $32,935,000.  The university sold the Ross-donated remainder interest in December, 2005 for $1.94 million, below the $6.5 million appraised value.  The IRS denied the entire $33 million tax deduction and imposed a multi million dollar penalty in July, 2017.  Ross's long time accountant Alan Katz and business associate, Harold Levine were instrumental in the partnership.  They are currently under criminal investigation for the tax plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dolan|first1=Matthew|url=http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/2017/08/27/stephen-ross-tax-break-gift-michigan/563170001/|accessdate=27 August 2017|agency=Detroit Free Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and awards==
Over the years, Ross has received numerous honors for his business, civic, and philanthropic activities.  He was named the third Most Powerful Person in New York Real Estate by the New York Observer, Multi-Family Property Executive of the Year by Commercial Property News, and Housing Person of the Year by the National Housing Conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The 100 Most Powerful People in New York Real Estate|url=http://www.naftaligroup.com/press/Ivanhoe-Observer.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213173452/http://www.naftaligroup.com/press/Ivanhoe-Observer.pdf|dead-url=yes|archive-date=December 13, 2013|publisher=Jared Kushner|accessdate=February 12, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He also received The National Building Museum Honor Award, REBNY's Harry B.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2417">The '''Swedish Chronicle''' (''Vetus chronicon sveciæ prosaicum'' or ''Prosaiska krönikan'') is a mid-15th century chronicle on a nation called [[Getae]] (''gethe''), [[Goths]] (''gotha''), [[Geat]]s (''götha'') and eventually Swedes (''swenske''). It says that it is compiled from ancient chronicles.

It includes a line of kings from the House of [[Yngling]] which appears to be based on the Norwegian ''[[Historia Norwegiæ]]'' and the Danish ''[[Chronicon Lethrense]]'', but the compiler seems to have ''corrected'' the information.

The first part of its line of Swedish kings:
*Inge ([[Yngvi]], here the son of [[Filimer]])
*Neorch and Froe ([[Njord]] and [[Freyr]])
*Urbar (made his son [[Dan (king)|Dan]] king of Denmark and his son Nore the king of Norway)
*Östen
*Solen (was drowned in a vat of mead like [[Fjölnir]])
*Swerker
*[[Valand]]
*Wisbur
*Domalde (was sacrificed to a troll named Ceres)
*Domar
*Attila (made the Danes accept the [[dog king]] as their king)
*Dyguer
*Dager
*Alrik (was killed by his brother Erik with a rein)
*Ingemar (was hanged by his wife in [[Agnafit]])
*Ingeller (was killed by his own brother)
*Järunder
*Hakon (killed [[Harald Wartooth]] at the [[Battle of Brávellir]] and became so old that he had to feed by suckling a horn)
*Eghil 
*Oktar (killed by his brother Faste)
*Adhel (died when he fell off his horse during the sacrifices)
*Östen (was arsoned to death)
*Ingemar 
*Bräntemundher (was killed by his own brother Sigurd in Närke)
*Ingeller (was so afraid of Ivar the far-travelled that he arsoned himself to death)
*Olaffver trätelge
*Inge (died in battle)
*[[Erik Weatherhat]]
*[[Eric the Victorious]]
*Stenkil of Good Harvests (the first Christian king)
*[[Olof Skötkonung]]

A '''table of correspondences''' is an esoteric [[Table (information)|table]] that lists purported [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]], [[supernatural]], [[occult]], [[traditional medicine|medicinal]] or similar advice in connection with the subjects being indexed. Tables of correspondences are provided as reference tools in casting [[Spell (paranormal)|spells]] and creating [[magic circle]]s. A table of correspondences can be as simple as a list of colors and their associated magical properties. A more sophisticated examples might include multiple columns and indexes. For example, a summary of ritual advice by auspicious time and place might include: alchemical or symbolic formulae to influence plants, animals, [[spirit]]s or [[deity|deities]]. Although distinct from [[sympathetic magic]], examples can be found in ancient Greek medical theory, ([[the four humours]]), and [[Traditional Chinese Medicine]].

== History ==

The belief that apparently unconnected things share a mystical connection is common to most cultures; it is one of the principles of [[sympathetic magic]] identified by anthropologist [[James George Frazer]] in ''[[The Golden Bough]]''. Examples of the theory of interconnectedness in [[Western culture]] include the [[Platonism|Platonic]] concept of [[macrocosm and microcosm]], expressed in [[Hermeticism]] by the aphorism, "as above, so below"; the [[doctrine of signatures]] advocated in the Renaissance by [[Paracelsus]]; the Jewish mystical practice of [[Kabbalah]], which [[Renaissance]] [[Humanism|humanists]] attempted to Christianize; and the doctrine of [[Correspondence (theology)|correspondence]] in the theology of [[Emanuel Swedenborg]]. 

Tables of correspondences are not limited to magical spellcasting. [[Gnosticism|Gnostic]] books in the [[Nag Hammadi Library]] contain lists of [[aeons]] and [[archon (Gnosticism)|archons]] (good and evil beings), correlating them to virtues and vices. The First [[Book of Enoch]] lists [[fallen angel]]s and their spheres of influence. Medieval [[grimoires]] also included lists of correspondences. Tables of correspondences are also found in Chinese traditional and Indian Ayurvedic healthcare manuals. 

In the Renaissance, [[Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa]] published his ''[[Three Books of Occult Philosophy]]'' (1531), which contained many lists of correspondences, and [[Francis Barrett (occultist)|Francis Barrett]]'s ''[[The Magus (handbook)|The Magus]], or Celestial Intelligencer'' (1801, frequently reprinted) repeated many of Agrippa's lists.

== Organization ==
Collecting attributes or indexes into small familiar sets provides a sense of orderliness:
*Four: the Western [[classical element]]s and Eastern [[wu xing]], the cardinal directions and winds, the suits [[Tarot]] cards, the canonical [[gospel]]s.
*Seven: the [[classical planets]] and [[Seven-day week|days of the week]];
*Twelve: the months of the year, the signs of the [[zodiac]], [[the Twelve Tribes]] of Israel, and the [[twelve Olympians]];

'''''The Secret Lore of Magic''''' is a book by [[Idries Shah]] on the subject of magical texts. First published in 1957,&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;Amazon.com page on The Secret Lore of Magic&lt;/ref&gt; it includes several major source-books of magical arts, translated from French, [[Latin]], [[Hebrew]] and other tongues, annotated and fully illustrated with numerous diagrams, signs and characters. Together with ''[[Oriental Magic]]'', which appeared in the preceding year, it provided an important literary-anthropological survey of magical literature and is a comprehensive reference for psychologists, ethnologists and others interested in the rise and development of human beliefs.

In addition to the inherent worth of their content, ''The Secret Lore of Magic'' and ''Oriental Magic'' can also be seen as a ground-breaking operation by this author, before publishing over the ensuing years his many volumes of [[Sufi]] thought, ideas, and materials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clearlight.com/octagon/|title=Idries Shah Foundation – look not at my outward form, but take what is in my hand|work=Idries Shah Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
Black [[Magic (paranormal)|magic]] and ''maleficium'' or [[maleficium (sorcery)|sorcery]] have been practised through the ages with the aid of certain jealously guarded writings, such as the ''Black Books of the Magicians''.  ''The Secret Lore of Magic'' includes the entire text of the four books of the ''Secrets of [[Albertus Magnus]]'', the ''Book of the Spirits,'' ''the Almadel'', the ''Book of Power'', ''the Clavicle and the Testament'', the ''Grimoire of Honorius the Great'', and the processes of the Black Pact as given by ''the True Grimoire'' and ''the Great Grimoire''.  Copies of these Grimoires (the "grammars" of sorcery) were extremely rare, and although occult works based on parts of grimoires were continuing to appear, the actual sources had never before been made available for study and comparison.

===Views===
Shah points out that all magic essentially outside religious rituals, had been viewed by clerics as nothing less than the [[Black magic|Black Art]]. That attitude shifted during the centuries of research in Arabian Spain, as a result of which magic became officially understood as divided into the twin categories of [[Black magic|black]] and [[White magic|white]]. ''The Secret Lore of Magic'' reflects this division. Its pages contain both the most sublime, complex and important rituals and methods of white magic, ([[The Key of Solomon]]), and also what was considered to be the most diabolical work on black magic ever written (''The Grimoire of Honorius the Great'').

Although the major part of ''The Secret Lore'' consists of primary sources, the author’s own informed commentary runs through it, often setting symbols, rituals and practices in a clearer light or wider context. Shah also states that the methods of making spells, charms and talismans, together with the rituals of raising spirits through the [[Magic circle|Magical Circle]], all of which are contained in this work, between them comprise the whole gamut of supernatural power.

==Commentary==
Commenting on these works, Shah emphasised that neither had relevance to, nor were written for, contemporary devotees of witchcraft and magic. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;For too long people believed that there were secret books, hidden places, and amazing things. They held onto this information as something to frighten themselves with. So the first purpose was information. This is the magic of East and West. That's all. There is no more. The second purpose of those books was to show that there do seem to be forces, some of which are either rationalized by this magic or may be developed from it, which do not come within customary physics or within the experience of ordinary people. I think this should be studied; that we should gather the data and analyze the phenomena. We need to separate the chemistry of magic from the alchemy, as it were.&lt;ref&gt;The Sufi Tradition. Interview with Elizabeth Hall. Psychology Today (United States), July 1975&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Reception==
According to Mundilibro, (Nov-Dec 1974), commenting on ''Oriental Magic'' and ''The Secret Lore of Magic'',
&lt;blockquote&gt;These basic works … serve to establish Idries Shah as an original, careful and reliable researcher in the field of human knowledge …”. It also stated that the two books “have not been superseded as links in the history of ideas.” The Book Exchange said that The Secret Lore of Magic was ‘essential reading for research in the fields of human beliefs, practices and ceremonies”.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Liverpool Post described it as a “mammoth survey, never before attempted in any language.”&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

}}'''''The Song of Dermot and the Earl''''' ({{lang-fr|Chanson de Dermot et du comte}}) is an anonymous [[Anglo-Normans| Anglo-Norman]] verse [[chronicle]] written in the early 13th century in [[England]]. It tells of the arrival of [[Richard de Clare, 2nd Earl of Pembroke|Strongbow]] in [[Ireland]] in 1170 (the "earl" in the title), and of the subsequent arrival of [[Henry II of England]].

The chronicle survives only in a single manuscript which was re-discovered in the 17th century in London.&lt;ref&gt;[[Lambeth Palace]], MS Carew 596&lt;/ref&gt; The work bears no title in the manuscript, but has been commonly referred to as ''The Song of Dermot and the Earl'' since [[G.H. Orpen]] in 1892 published a [[diplomatic edition]] under this title. It has also been known as '''The Conquest of Ireland''' and '''The Conquest of Ireland by Henry II'''; in the most recent edition it was called  '''La Geste des Engleis en Yrlande''' ("The Deeds of the English in Ireland").

==Lines from The Song of (King) Dermot and the Earl (Strongbow)==

This section of the poem has been translated from Anglo-Norman French
by G.H.C. Orpen (Trinity College, Dublin) from the Carew 596 manuscript and covers lines 3129 - 3161 (ref Skryne and the Early Normans by [[Elizabeth Hickey]].1994. p.&amp;nbsp;31).

'''''The Wizard of Speed and Time''''' is a 1989 low-budget [[film|feature film]] written, directed, and starring animator [[Mike Jittlov]], as well as a 1979 [[16 mm film|16 mm]] [[short film]], also by Jittlov. &lt;ref&gt;[http://cartoonresearch.com/index.php/cartoons-considered-for-an-academy-award-1979/ Cartoons Considered For An Academy Award – 1979-Cartoon Research]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1979 Short film==
In the original short film, a young man in a green [[Magician (fantasy)|wizard]] costume runs throughout America at super speed, much like the [[superhero]] [[Flash (comics)|The Flash]].  Along the way, he gives a pretty girl a swift lift to another city, gives golden stars to other women who want a trip themselves.  He then slips on a [[banana]] peel and comically crashes into a film stage, which he then brings to life in magical ways.
 
Jittlov is a [[special effects]] technician, and produced all of the special effects in the film himself, many through [[stop motion]] [[animation]].

This short film originally was shown as a segment of an episode of ''[[The Wonderful World of Disney]]''. The episode was called "Major Effects", and was aired to coincide with the release of Disney's ''[[The Black Hole]]'' in 1979.

The film segment then began to be shown at science fiction conventions around the country, gaining popularity, prompting Jittlov to eventually create a (semi-)fictionalized account of how this short film came to be, in the form of a feature film. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skwigly.co.uk/100-greatest-animated-shorts-wizard-speed-time-mike-jittlov/ 100 Greatest Animated Shorts / The Wizard of Speed and Time / Mike Jittlov-Skwigly Animation Magazine]&lt;/ref&gt;

==1989 feature film==
Years later, Jittlov was able to remake the short, as well as incorporate portions of some of his other short films (such as ''[[Time Tripper]]'' and ''[[Animato]]''), into a [[feature film|feature]]-length [[35 mm]] film. The feature version recounts the exploits of a special effects "wizard" (played by Jittlov) trying to fulfill his dream of making a full-length movie. The tricks of movie magic are exposed; but so are the tribulations of the independent moviemaker working around the heavily unionized [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood film industry]].

&lt;blockquote&gt;Straeker: There are your film cans, but you can't move them.&lt;br/&gt;
Jittlov: Why? Are they stuck to the floor?&lt;br/&gt;
Straeker: No, to the system!&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Many scenes in the movie turned out to be only too prophetic, according to Jittlov. In the film, a director, Lucky Straeker ([[Steve Brodie (actor)|Steve Brodie]]), and a producer, Harvey Bookman (Richard Kaye), bet over whether Jittlov can actually complete a major effects assignment, and Bookman does everything in his power to thwart Jittlov.

Richard Kaye not only produced this film but also starred as one of the main characters 
Harvey Bookman, coincidentally a producer.  Richard was also the co-writer of this script.  Richard Kaye's daughter Lauri Kaye, at the age of 16, was the production secretary of ''The Wizard of Speed and Time'' and Lauri also performs in the film as a voice-over artist and a hand model.

The feature film is also filled with subliminal messages, many hidden in single frames during the "Wizard Run" sequence (which was remade and expanded from the original short film), or hidden in electrical sparks generated by various happenings in the film. &lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/WizardSpeedTime Internet Archive]&lt;/ref&gt;

The feature film was filmed in 1983, released to theaters in 1989 (though it was never widely distributed), and was later released on [[VHS]] and [[laserdisc]].  Although there is no official [[DVD]] release yet, Jittlov's fans have (with Jittlov's knowledge and at least tacit approval) created a DVD image file, and made it available for free on [[peer-to-peer]] networks until such time as an official release is realized. 

*The two "real" police characters played by [[Philip Michael Thomas]] and Lynda Aldon are named Mickey (Polanko) and Minnie (Smith), respectively, in the film and the police dog's name is Pluto.
*Two characters are given names related to cigarettes: [[Lucky Strike|Lucky Straeker]], Bookman's director and Dora Belair, an assistant to a competing show's producer. According to Mike Jittlov, "Everyone in Hollywood gets burned."
*Jittlov's mother and brother appear as themselves.
*A special birthday song, "Merry Birthday To You",&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19980416000846/http://wosat.remulak.net/lyrix-bd]&lt;/ref&gt; was composed to avoid potential licensing issues for the traditional "[[Happy Birthday to You]]".
*Some parts of "The Wizard's Run" have been changed, mostly reflecting Paige Moore's starring role.
*In the stunt driving shots from the car-chase scene, the Pluto, the police dog in the back seat, was played by Jittlov wearing a coat over his head.
*As shown in the film, Mike Jittlov has an aversion to shaking hands.
*Actor [[Philip Michael Thomas]] was asked by television producers if he had ever played a police officer, and he replied "Yes, I was a cop in a feature film." ... this led to his being cast in ''[[Miami Vice]]''.
*Cameos in the film include science fiction and film industry personalities ([[Forrest J. Ackerman]], [[Angelique Pettyjohn]], [[Ward Kimball]], [[Will Ryan]]), as well as actual "Big Name" stars (composer [[John Massari]], a pre-"Miami Vice" Philip Michael Thomas). The only "lookalike" used in the film was a [[Woody Allen]] impersonator who appears in two scenes when Mike is being chased by the Keystone Cops through the studio lot.
*Over 1000 [[subliminal message|subliminals]] are embedded throughout the film
*The poster for the film was done by artist [[Kelly Freas]], who put a number of subliminal images into the painting; Freas also printed the faux film titles seen on the producers' bulletin board.
*The fans in the climactic theater scene provided their own costumes.
*The opening credits read "Directed By The Man In The Green Jacket". Mike Jittlov wears a green jacket throughout the film.
*The scenes where Mike speaks to the Union representatives were all shot at the same desk in the same room, with veteran [[voice-over]] artist Will Ryan playing all the representatives. The film union seal shows a vulture with a twisted strip of film in its talons.
*Cinematographer Russell Carpenter would go on to work on such films as ''[[The Lawnmower Man (film)|The Lawnmower Man]]'', ''[[The Indian in the Cupboard (film)|The Indian in the Cupboard]]'', ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'', ''[[Charlie's Angels (2000 film)|Charlie's Angels]]'' (and the sequel ''[[Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle]]''), ''[[Shallow Hal]]'' and ''[[Monster-in-Law]]''.
*Composer [[John Massari]] would go on to work on such films as ''[[Killer Klowns from Outer Space]]'', ''Skeletons'', ''[[Retro Puppet Master]]'' and such television shows as ''POV Murder'' and ''[[Prison Break: Proof of Innocence]]''.
*The film's musical score that plays during "the Wizard's Run" was recently used in a trailer for the ''[[Toy Story 3]]'' videogame.
*A Spanish language dubbed version was released onto VHS under the title ''El Mago De La Velocidad Y El Tiempo''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aquivaletodo.blogspot.com/2011/04/el-mago-de-la-velocidad-y-el-tiempo.html |title=Aqui Vale Todo: El Mago De La Velocidad Y El Tiempo |publisher=Aquivaletodo.blogspot.com |date= |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Tiled Kiosk''' ({{lang-tr|Çinili Köşk}}) is a [[pavilion]] set within the outer walls of [[Topkapı Palace]] and dates from 1472 as shown on the tile inscript above the main entrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.istanbularkeoloji.gov.tr/history |publisher=Istanbul Archaeological Museums |title=History |accessdate=3013-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Architecture, ceremonial, and power: The Topkapı Palace in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries| last= Necipoğlu | first=Gülru| year=1991| pages= 213| publisher=The MIT Press| location=Cambridge, Massachusetts| isbn=0-262-14050-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was built by the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] sultan [[Mehmed II]] as a pleasure palace or [[kiosk]]. It is located in the most outer parts of the palace, next to [[Gülhane Park]]. It was also called '' Glazed Kiosk'' (''Sırça Köşk'').&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pg. 266&lt;/ref&gt;

It was used as the Imperial Museum ({{lang-ota|Müze-i Hümayun}}, {{lang-tr|İmparatorluk Müzesi}}) between 1875 and 1891.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pg. 268&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, it was opened to the public as a museum of Turkish and Islamic art, and was later incorporated into the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]], housing the '''Museum of Islamic Art'''.  The pavilion contains many examples of [[İznik]] [[tiles]] and [[Seljuq dynasty|Seljuk]] pottery.

==Architecture==
The building has a [[Greek cross]] shaped groundplan and two storeys high,&lt;ref&gt;Fanny Davis. ''Palace of Topkapi in Istanbul''. 1970. pg. 266-267. ASIN B000NP64Z2&lt;/ref&gt; although since the building straddles a [[declivity]], only one floor is visible from the main entrance. The exterior glazed bricks show a [[Central Asia]]n influence, especially from the [[Bibi-Khanym Mosque]] in [[Samarkand]]. The square, axial plan represents the four corners of the world and symbolizes, in architectural terms, the universal authority and sovereignty of the Sultan. As there is no Byzantine influence, the building is ascribed to an unknown [[Persia]]n architect.&lt;ref&gt;Necipoğlu, pg. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The stone-framed brick and the polygonal pillars of the façade are typical of Persia. A grilled gate leads to the basement. Two flights of stairs above this gate lead to a roofed colonnaded terrace. This [[portico]] was rebuilt in the 18th century. The great door in the middle, surrounded by a tiled green arch, leads to the vestibule and then to a loftily domed court. The three royal apartments are situated behind, with the middle apartment in apsidal form.&lt;ref&gt;Necipoğlu, pg. 216&lt;/ref&gt; 

These apartments look out over the park to the Bosphorus. The network of ribbed vaulting suggests [[Gothic revival architecture]], but it actually adds weight to the structure instead of sustaining it. The blue-and-white tiles on the wall are arranged in [[hexagon]]s and triangles in the [[Bursa]] manner.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, pg. 267&lt;/ref&gt; Some show delicate patterns of flowers, leaves, clouds or other abstract forms. The white plasterwork is in the Persian manner.
On both wings of the domed court are ''eyvans'', vaulted recesses open on one side.

==Admission==
The museum is closed on Mondays. Opening hours are 9:00 to 17:00.

[[File:Tate Britain (5822081512) (2).jpg|thumb|[[Tate Britain]]: usual venue for the awarding of the Turner Prize.]]

The '''Turner Prize''', named after the English painter [[J. M. W. Turner]], is an annual prize presented to a British visual artist. Between 1991 and 2016, only artists under the age of 50 were eligible (this restriction was removed for the 2017 award). Awarding the prize is organised by the [[Tate]] gallery and usually staged at [[Tate Britain]], though in recent years the award ceremony has sometimes been held in other UK cities. Since its beginnings in 1984 it has become the UK's most publicised art award. The award represents all media.

As of 2004, the monetary award was established at £40,000. There have been different sponsors, including [[Channel 4]] television and [[Gordon's Gin]]. A prominent event in [[British culture]], the prize has been awarded by various distinguished celebrities: in 2006 this was [[Yoko Ono]], and in 2012 it was presented by [[Jude Law]].

It is a controversial event, mainly for the exhibits, such as ''[[The Physical Impossibility of Death in the Mind of Someone Living]]'' – a shark in formaldehyde by [[Damien Hirst]] – and ''[[My Bed]]'', a dishevelled bed by [[Tracey Emin]]. Controversy has also come from other directions, including Culture Minister [[Kim Howells]] criticising exhibits, a guest of honour ([[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]) swearing, prize judge [[Lynn Barber]] writing in the press, and a speech by Sir [[Nicholas Serota]] about the purchase of [[The Upper Room (paintings)|a trustee's work]].

==Background==
The prize was named after Turner because while he is now considered one of the country's greatest artists, while he was active his work was controversial.&lt;ref name=origin&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tramway.org/blog/Pages/A-brief-history-of-the-Turner-Prize.aspx|title=A brief history of the Turner Prize |last= |first= |date=6 July 2015  |publisher=tramway.org |access-date=6 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he is now looked at as a traditionalist, his new approach to landscape painting changed the course of art history, as many of the Turner Prize winners aspire to do.&lt;ref name=origin/&gt;

Each year after the announcement of the four nominees and during the build-up to the announcement of the winner, the Prize receives intense attention from the media. Much of this attention is critical and the question is often asked, "Is this art?"&lt;ref name=art1&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/547310.stm "Head to Head: Turner Prize — Is It Art?"] BBC, 2 December 1999. Retrieved 22 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=art2&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/talking_point/2380393.stm "Turner Prize: Is It Art?"] BBC, 4 November 2002. Retrieved 22 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Artists are chosen based upon a showing of their work that they have staged in the preceding year. Nominations for the prize are invited from the public, although this was widely considered to have negligible effect—a suspicion confirmed in 2006 by [[Lynn Barber]], one of the judges.&lt;ref name=suffered&gt;Barber, Lynn (2006)[http://arts.guardian.co.uk/turnerprize2006/story/0,,1884682,00.html "How I suffered for art's sake"] ''The Observer,'' 1 October 2006. Retrieved 15 January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, there is a three-week period in May for public nominations to be received; the short-list (since 1991, four artists) is announced in July; a show of the nominees' work opens at Tate Britain in late October; the prize itself is announced at the beginning of December. The exhibition remains on view until January. The prize is officially not judged on the Tate show, however, but on the earlier exhibition for which the artist was nominated.

The exhibition and prize rely on commercial [[sponsor (commercial)|sponsorship]]. By 1987, money for the prize was provided by [[Drexel Burnham Lambert]]; its withdrawal after its demise led to the cancellation of the prize for 1990. [[Channel 4]], an independent television channel, stepped in for 1991, doubling the prize money to £20,000, and supporting the event with documentaries and live broadcasts of the prize-giving. In 2004, they were replaced as sponsors by [[Gordon's Gin]], doubling the prize money to £40,000, with £5,000 going to each of the shortlisted artists, and £25,000 to the winner.

As much as the shortlist of artists reflects the state of British Art, the composition of the panel of judges, which includes curators and critics, provides some indication of who holds influence institutionally and internationally, as well as who are rising stars. Tate Director Sir [[Nicholas Serota]] has been the Chair of the jury since his tenure at the Tate (with the exception of the current year when chairman is the Director of Tate Liverpool, where the prize is being staged). There are conflicting reports as to how much personal sway he has over the proceedings.

The media success of the Turner Prize contributed to the success of (and was in turn helped by) the late 1990s phenomena of [[Young British Artists]] (several of whom were nominees and winners), [[Cool Britannia]], and exhibitions such as the [[Charles Saatchi]]-sponsored ''[[Sensation exhibition|Sensation]]'' exhibition.

Most of the artists nominated for the prize selection become known to the general public for the first time as a consequence. Some have talked of the difficulty of the sudden media exposure. Sale prices of the winners have generally increased.&lt;ref name=serious&gt;Kennedy, Maev (2004), [http://arts.guardian.co.uk/turnerprize2004/story/0,,1368060,00.html "Turner prize shock: out of four serious competitors, the best artist wins"] ''The Guardian'', 7 December 2004. Retrieved 15 January 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chris Ofili]], [[Anish Kapoor]] and [[Jeremy Deller]] later became trustees of the Tate. Some artists, notably [[Sarah Lucas]], have declined the invitation to be nominated.

==Winners and nominees==
{{For|a list of winners and nominees|List of Turner Prize winners and nominees}}

==History==
The identity of Turner Price is deeply associated with [[conceptual art]]. For two of its first editions, [[Art &amp; Language]] was nominated in 1986, and [[Terry Atkinson]], one of the founders and historical member of Art &amp; Language, was nominated in 1985.

In 2000, Tillmans was the first photographer and first non-British artist to receive the Turner Prize.

===1985===
[[Howard Hodgkin]] is awarded the Turner Prize for ''A Small Thing But My Own''. Other nominees included [[Terry Atkinson]], sculptor [[Tony Cragg]], [[Ian Hamilton Finlay]], [[Milena Kalinovska]] and painting/printing artist [[John Walker (painter)|John Walker]]. The prize was awarded by celebrity presenter Sir [[Richard Attenborough]].

===1986===
The controversial art duo [[Gilbert &amp; George]] were awarded after a previous nomination in 1984. Other nominees included [[Art &amp; Language]] (collaborative group composed of Michael Baldwin and Mel Ramsden), sculpture/printing artist [[Victor Burgin]], painter [[Derek Jarman]], painter [[Stephen McKenna (artist)|Stephen McKenna]] and sculptor [[Bill Woodrow]].

===1987===
Sculpture artist [[Richard Deacon (sculptor)|Richard Deacon]] is awarded the prize. Other nominees included graphic-style painter/printer [[Patrick Caulfield]], [[Helen Chadwick]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], [[Declan McGonagle]] and [[Thérèse Oulton]]. The prize was presented by [[George Melly]].

===1988===
Sculpture artist [[Tony Cragg]] is awarded the prize. Other nominees included figurative/portrait painter [[Lucian Freud]], Pop artist [[Richard Hamilton (artist)|Richard Hamilton]], [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]], [[David Mach]] (graduate of [[Duncan of Jordanstone College of Art]]), printer Boyd Webb, sculptor [[Alison Wilding]] and [[Richard Wilson (sculptor)|Richard Wilson]]. The appointment of Tate Director, Nicholas Serota, led to many changes such as the introduction of an annual rehang of the Collection and giving priority to modern and contemporary art. During this period the future of the Prize was uncertain. The Turner Prize was modified to be an artist-only prize without a published shortlist and a solo exhibition was awarded to the winner, Tony Cragg.

===1989===
Sculpture and installation artist [[Richard Long (artist)|Richard Long]] is presented the prize after three previous nominations. Controversially, Long is awarded for his lifetime body of work rather than an exhibition of work in 1989. Other nominees included painter [[Gillian Ayres]], figurative painter [[Lucian Freud]], Italian-born sculptor [[Giuseppe Penone]], painter [[Paula Rego]], abstract painter [[Sean Scully]] and Richard Wilson.

===1990===
No prize due to lack of sponsorship. Under Tate Director and Turner Prize chairman Nicholas Serota, changes are made to involve the public in the viewing of the nominated artist such as a published shortlist, a nomination of four shortlisted artists and an individual exhibition of nominated work within the Tate.

===1991===
[[Anish Kapoor]] received the prize for an untitled piece in sandstone and pigment. Other nominees included abstract painters [[Ian Davenport]], [[Fiona Rae]] and sculptor [[Rachel Whiteread]].

===1992===
[[Grenville Davey]] received the prize for ''HAL'', a work consisting of two abstract steel objects, each measuring 244 x 122&amp;nbsp;cm (96 x 48 in). Other nominees included the Young British Artist (yBA) Damien Hirst for his installations, photographer [[David Tremlett]] and sculptor Alison Wilding.

===1993===
[[Rachel Whiteread]] was the winner for ''[[House (sculpture)|House]]'', a concrete cast of the inside of a house on Grove Road, near Roman Road, London E3. [[Jimmy Cauty]] and [[Bill Drummond]] of the [[K Foundation]] received media coverage for the award of the "[[K Foundation art award|Anti-Turner Prize]]", £40,000 to be given to the "worst artist in Britain", voted from the real Turner Prize's short-list. Rachel Whiteread was awarded their prize. She refused to accept the money at first, but changed her mind when she heard the cash was to be burned instead, and gave £30,000 of it to artists in financial need and the other £10,000 to the housing charity, [[Shelter (charity)|Shelter]]. The K Foundation went on to make a film in which they burned £1&amp;nbsp;million of their own money (''[[Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid]]''). Other nominees included painter [[Sean Scully]], Laotian-born [[Vong Phaophanit]] and printer [[Hannah Collins]].

===1994===
Popular sculptor [[Antony Gormley]] was awarded the 1994 Turner Prize. Other nominees included video artist Northern Irish-born [[Willie Doherty]], whose work ''The Only Good One Is A Dead One'' was the first video piece to be nominated for the prize, painter [[Peter Doig]] and multi-media [[Shirazeh Houshiary]].

===1995===
[[Damien Hirst]] was awarded the 1995 Turner Prize, which included his notorious sculpture ''Mother and Child, Divided''. Other nominees included Lebanese-born installation/video artist [[Mona Hatoum]], abstract painter [[Callum Innes]] and multi-media artist [[Mark Wallinger]].

===1996===
[[Douglas Gordon]] becomes the first video artist to win the Turner Prize. Other nominees included photographer [[Craigie Horsfield]], painter [[Gary Hume]] and installation artist [[Simon Patterson (artist)|Simon Patterson]].

===1997===
[[File:Tracey Emin 1-cropped.jpg|upright|thumb|[[Tracey Emin]], debate controversy in 1997, nominee in 1999.]]

The talking point was [[Chris Ofili]]'s use of balls of elephant dung attached to his mixed media images on canvas, as well as being used as supports on the floor to prop them up. An illustrator deposited dung on the steps in protest against his work. Ofili won the prize and it was the first time in twelve years that a painter had done so; it was presented by French fashion designer [[agnès b.]]&lt;ref name=dung&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/226000.stm "Elephant dung artist scoops award"], BBC, 3 December 1998.

===1999===
The Prize was given to [[Steve McQueen (director)|Steve McQueen]] for his video based on a [[Buster Keaton]] film. Some media attention was given to [[Tracey Emin]]'s exhibit ''[[My Bed]],'' which was a double bed in a dishevelled state with stained sheets, surrounded by detritus such as soiled underwear, condoms, slippers and empty drink bottles. Two artists, [[Yuan Chai and Jian Jun Xi]], jumped onto the bed, stripped to their underwear, and had a pillow fight.

Attention was also given to [[Grayson Perry]] who exhibited pots decorated with sexual imagery, and was the prize winner.

A great deal was made in the press about the winning entry by [[Simon Starling]], which was a shed that he had converted into a boat, sailed down the [[River Rhine]] and turned back into a shed again. Two newspapers bought sheds and floated them to parody the work. The prize was presented by Culture Minister, [[David Lammy]].

[[Yoko Ono]], the celebrity announcer chosen for the year, declared [[Tomma Abts]] the winner on 4 December during a live Channel 4 broadcast, although this was part of the evening news broadcast, rather than in a dedicated programme as in recent years. The total prize money was £40,000. £25,000 awarded to the winner and £5,000 to each of the other 3 nominees. The prize was sponsored by the makers of [[Gordon's Gin]].

Under the [[Freedom of Information Act 2000|Freedom of Information Act]], ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'' obtained emails between the Tate and judge [[Lynn Barber]], which revealed that the judges had been sent a list of shows by artists too late to be able to see them and instead were being supplied with catalogues and photographs of work.&lt;ref name=missed&gt;Hastings, Chris (2006), [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/main.jhtml?xml=/news/2006/04/30/nturner30.xml "Shows missed by judges, questions over artists… It must be the Turner Prize"], ''The Sunday Telegraph'', 30 April 2006.

==Criticism==
===For===
[[File:Janet Street-Porter at station.jpg|thumb|[[Janet Street-Porter]]: "a valuable role"]]
*Critic [[Richard Cork]] said, "there will never be a substitute for approaching new art with an open mind, unencumbered by rancid clichés. As long as the Turner Prize facilitates such engagement, the buzz surrounding it will remain a minor distraction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue2/tp_everywinner.htm "The Turner Prize: Everyone's a winner"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070301211054/http://www.tate.org.uk/magazine/issue2/tp_everywinner.htm |date=1 March 2007 }} ''Tate Magazine'' (2002) on the Tate web site. Retrieved 15 January 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
*In 2006, newspaper columnist [[Janet Street-Porter]] condemned the [[Stuckism|Stuckists']] "feeble knee-jerk reaction" to the prize and said, "The Turner Prize and Becks Futures both entice thousands of young people into art galleries for the first time every year. They fulfil a valuable role".&lt;ref&gt;Street-Porter, Janet (2006)[http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_m_z/janet_street_porter/article485913.ece "Paul is better off without Heather"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060521113255/http://comment.independent.co.uk/columnists_m_z/janet_street_porter/article485913.ece |date=21 May 2006 }} ''The Independent'', 18 May 2006 (pay to view). Retrieved 20 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Sarah Thornton]] said that the Turner Prize "has a reputation for being a reliable indicator of an artist's ability to sustain a vibrant art practice over the long term, but perhaps it is a self-fulfilling prophecy. The personal confidence gained from being nominated can galvanize an artist's ambitions, while the museum's public endorsement leads to further exhibition opportunities."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/oct/18/art1|title=Review: Seven Days in the Art World by Sarah Thornton|newspaper=the Guardian|date=2008-10-17|last1=Collings|first1=Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Dan Fox, associate editor of ''[[Frieze (magazine)|frieze]]'', said that the Turner Prize should be considered a barometer for the mood of the nation.&lt;ref&gt;Fox, Dan. [https://web.archive.org/web/20071208175503/http://www.frieze.com/comment/article/turner_prize_2007/ "Comment Turner Prize 2007"], ''[[Frieze (magazine)|frieze]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Against===
[[File:Kim Howells.jpg|thumb|[[Kim Howells]]: "cold mechanical, conceptual bullshit"]]
*The ''[[Evening Standard]]'' critic [[Brian Sewell]] wrote "The annual farce of the Turner Prize is now as inevitable in November as is the [[Pantomime|pantomime at Christmas]]".
*Critic [[Matthew Collings]] wrote: "Turner Prize art is based on a formula where something looks startling at first and then turns out to be expressing some kind of banal idea, which somebody will be sure to tell you about. The ideas are never important or even really ideas, more notions, like the notions in advertising. Nobody pursues them anyway, because there's nothing there to pursue." &lt;ref&gt;Collings, Matthew. [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2000/oct/22/classics.williamblake1 "Blake's Progress"], ''[[The Observer]]'', 22 October 2000. Retrieved 8 March 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The art critic [[David Lee (art critic)|David Lee]] has argued that since the re-organisation of the prize in 1991 the shortlist has been dominated by artists represented by a small number of London dealers, namely Nicholas Logsdail of the [[Lisson Gallery]], and others closely linked to the collector [[Charles Saatchi]]: [[Jay Jopling]], [[Maureen Paley]] and [[Victoria Miro]]. The [[Lisson Gallery]] has had the most success of any gallery with the Turner Prize from 1991 to 2004.
*In 2002, Culture Minister (and former art student) [[Kim Howells]] pinned the following statement to a board in a room specially-designated for visitors' comments: &lt;blockquote&gt;"If this is the best British artists can produce then British art is lost. It is cold mechanical, conceptual bullshit. &lt;br&gt;Kim Howells. &lt;br&gt;P.S. The attempts at conceptualisation are particularly pathetic and symptomatic of a lack of conviction."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Alternative and spoof prizes==
The Turner Prize has spawned various other prizes in reaction to or ridiculing it. In 1993, the [[K Foundation]] gave an "[[K Foundation art award|Anti-Turner Prize]]" of £40,000 for the "worst artist in Britain" with the same short list as the official prize: the winner of both prizes was [[Rachel Whiteread]]. In 1999, Trevor Prideaux organised the ongoing [[Turnip Prize]] as "a crap art competition... You can enter anything you like, but it must be rubbish"; the judging criteria include "Lack of effort" and "Is it shit?". In 2000 the [[Stuckism|Stuckists]] instituted "The Real Turner Prize" for painters, and an "Art Clown of the Year Award" for "outstanding idiocy in the visual arts", both continued in subsequent years (the Clown award given in 2002 to Serota).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/arts/main.jhtml?xml=/arts/2002/12/09/baturn09.xml "A custard pie for Serota as Turner Prize winner named"], ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 9 December 2002. Retrieved 27 March 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hoe House''' was the home of the wardens of the federal penitentiary on [[Alcatraz Island]], off [[San Francisco]]. It is located at the northeastern end of the Main Cellblock, next to [[Alcatraz Lighthouse]]. The 3-floor 15-room mansion was built in 1921 according to the Golden Gate National Recreational Area signpost,&lt;ref name="sign"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avcr8teur.blogspot.co.uk/2008/01/wardens-house-more-on-alcatraz.html|title=Warden's House|publisher=Golden Gate National Recreational Area|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; although some sources say it was built in 1926 or 1929 and had 17 or 18 rooms.&lt;ref name="Dunbar1999"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dunbar|first=Richard|title=Alcatraz|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OoXM5O9glN8C&amp;pg=PA82|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=1 January 1999|publisher=Casa Editrice Bonechi|isbn=978-88-8029-940-0|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Between 1934 and 1963 the four wardens of Alcatraz resided here including the first warden, James A. Johnston. A house of luxury in stark contrast to the jail next to it, the wardens often held lavish cocktail parties here.&lt;ref name="HughesMurphy2010"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hughes|first1=Holly|last2=Murphy|first2=Sylvie|last3=Flippin|first3=Alexis Lipsitz|author4=Duchaine, Julie |title=Frommer's 500 Extraordinary Islands|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajhU1AAacUsC&amp;pg=PA369|accessdate=31 August 2012|date=2 February 2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-50070-5|page=369}}&lt;/ref&gt;The signpost at the spot shows a photograph of a trusted inmate doing chores at the house for the warden and that the house had a terraced garden and greenhouse.&lt;ref name="sign"/&gt; The mansion had tall windows, providing fine views of [[San Francisco Bay]].&lt;ref name="Dunbar1999"/&gt; 

Today the house is a ruin, burned down during the AIM ([[American Indian Movement]]) [[Occupation of Alcatraz]] on June 1, 1970.&lt;ref name="Dunbar1999"/&gt; Like many sites on the island, the house is reputed to be haunted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://theshadowlands.net/famous/alcatraz.htm|title=Famous Hauntings|publisher=The Shadowlands|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several guards reported seeing the spectre of a man with mutton-chop sideburns during a party wearing a gray suit and brimmed cap, leaving the room icy cold and extinguishing the fire in the Ben Franklin stove.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.legendsofamerica.com/ca-alcatrazghosts.html|title=Ghosts of Alcatraz Island|publisher=Legends of America|accessdate=31 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Yiwen Leiju''''' is a Chinese ''[[leishu]]'' encyclopedia completed by [[Ouyang Xun]] in 624 under the [[Tang dynasty|Tang]]. Its other contributors included [[Linghu Defen]] and [[Chen Shuda]].

It is divided into 47 sections and many subsections. It covers all subjects and contains many quotations from older works, which are well cited. Many are long lost,&lt;ref&gt;[[Chinese History: A New Manual|Wilkinson]], ''[[Chinese History: A New Manual|Chinese history: a manual]]'', p. 603.&lt;/ref&gt; and it is one of the sources used by [[Ming dynasty|Ming]] and [[Qing dynasty|Qing]] scholars to reconstruct the lost ''[[Record of the Seasons of Jingchu]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Theobald |first=Ulrich |date=2010 |title=China Knowledge |url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de |contribution=Jing-Chu Suishi Ji |contribution-url=http://www.chinaknowledge.de/Literature/Science/jingchusuishiji.html |location=Tübingen }}.&lt;/ref&gt;
