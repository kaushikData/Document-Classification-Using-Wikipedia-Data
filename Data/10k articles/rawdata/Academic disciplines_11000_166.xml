The first Acharius Medal was made by the [[Myntverket|Royal Swedish Mint]] for the [[Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences]] in 1846, although the medal's original purpose has not been recorded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botany.org/plantsciencebulletin/psb-1993-39-1.php |title=International Association for Lichenology (IAL) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100621033335/http://botany.org/plantsciencebulletin/psb-1993-39-1.php |archivedate=2010-06-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In its 1990 meeting at [[Regensburg]], the [[International Association for Lichenology]] (IAL) resolved that it would simultaneously honor professional achievement, and commemorate [[Erik Acharius]] (recognized as the "Father of Lichenology"), by presenting a medal in his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-hotel.uu.se/evolmuseum/fytotek/acharius.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-08-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080114065315/http://www-hotel.uu.se/evolmuseum/fytotek/acharius.html |archivedate=2008-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lichenology.org/Publications/ILN/ILN_25_3.pdf International Lichenological Newsletter, volume 25, number 3 (December 1992), pp 12-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the Swedish Mint still had the [[coin die|die]]s for the 1846 medal, the IAL arranged for new medals to be made.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lichenology.org/Publications/ILN/ILN_25_3.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The first of the new medals were awarded in that same year (1992) at the association's congress in [[Båstad]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|page=103|title=Lichenological contributions in honour of David Galloway |author=Ingvar Kärnefelt |author2=David J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15074">'''Advanced oxidation processes''' (abbreviation: '''AOPs'''), in a broad sense, are a set of chemical treatment procedures designed to remove organic (and sometimes inorganic) materials in [[water]] and [[wastewater]] by [[oxidation]] through reactions with [[hydroxyl radicals]] (·OH).&lt;ref name="glaze"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glaze|first=William|author2=Kang, Joon-Wun|author3= Chapin, Douglas H.|title=The Chemistry of Water Treatment Processes Involving Ozone, Hydrogen Peroxide and Ultraviolet Radiation.|journal=Ozone: Science &amp; Engineering |year=1987|volume=9|issue=4|pages=335–352|doi=10.1080/01919518708552148}}&lt;/ref&gt; In real-world applications of [[wastewater treatment]], however, this term usually refers more specifically to a subset of such chemical processes that employ [[ozone]] (O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[hydrogen peroxide]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and/or UV light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=National Water Research Institute|title=Treatment Technologies for Removal of Methyl Tertiary Butyl Ether (MTBE) from Drinking Water: Chapter III Advanced Oxidation Processes|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; One such type of process is  called [[in situ oxidation|in situ chemical oxidation]].

==Description==
AOPs rely on in-situ production of highly reactive hydroxyl radicals (·OH). These reactive species are the strongest oxidants that can be applied in water and can virtually oxidize any compound present in the water matrix, often at a diffusion controlled reaction speed. Consequently, ·OH reacts unselectively once formed and contaminants will be quickly and efficiently fragmented and converted into small inorganic molecules. Hydroxyl radicals are produced with the help of one or more primary oxidants (e.g. [[ozone]], [[hydrogen peroxide]], [[oxygen]]) and/or energy sources (e.g. [[ultraviolet]] light) or catalysts (e.g. [[titanium dioxide]]). Precise, pre-programmed dosages, sequences and combinations of these reagents are applied in order to obtain a maximum •OH yield. In general, when applied in properly tuned conditions, AOPs can reduce the concentration of contaminants from several-hundreds [[Parts per million|ppm]] to less than 5 [[Parts per billion|ppb]] and therefore significantly bring [[Chemical oxygen demand|COD]] and [[Total organic carbon|TOC]] down, which earned it the credit of “water treatment processes of the 21st century”.&lt;ref name="munter"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Munter|first=Rein|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes–Current Status and Prospects.|journal=Proceedings of the Estonian Academy of Sciences. Chemistry|year=2001|volume=50|issue=2|pages=59–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The AOP procedure is particularly useful for cleaning biologically toxic or non-degradable materials such as [[aromatics]], [[pesticides]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Misra|first=N.N.|title=The contribution of non-thermal and advanced oxidation technologies towards dissipation of pesticide residues|journal=Trends in Food Science &amp; Technology|volume=45|issue=2|pages=229–244|doi=10.1016/j.tifs.2015.06.005|year=2015|url=https://arrow.dit.ie/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1233&amp;context=schfsehart}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[petroleum]] constituents, and [[volatile organic compound]]s in wastewater.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Enric Brillasa |author2=Eva Mur |author3=Roser Sauleda |author4=Laura Sànchez |author5=José Peral |author6=Xavier Domènech |author7=Juan Casado |title=Aniline mineralization by AOP's: anodic oxidation, photocatalysis, electro-Fenton and photoelectro-Fenton processes |journal=Applied Catalysis B: Environmental |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages=31–42 |date=March 1998 |pmid= |doi= 10.1016/S0926-3373(97)00059-3 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6TF6-3VN03K2-3&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=d557b71411fdce56af991813ef191bf7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, AOPs can be used to treat effluent of secondary treated wastewater which is then called [[tertiary treatment]].&lt;ref name="audenaert"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=W.T.M.

A goal of the wastewater purification by means of AOP procedures is the reduction of the chemical contaminants and the toxicity to such an extent that the cleaned wastewater may be reintroduced into receiving streams or, at least, into a conventional [[sewage treatment]].

Although oxidation processes involving ·OH have been in use since late 19th century (such as in Fenton reagent, which, however, was an analytical reagent at that time), the utilization of such oxidative species in water treatment did not receive adequate attention until Glaze et al.&lt;ref name="glaze"/&gt;  suggested the possible generation of ·OH “in sufficient quantity to affect water purification” and defined the term “Advanced Oxidation Processes” for the first time in 1987. AOPs still have not been put into commercial use on a large scale (especially in developing countries) even up to today mostly because of the relatively high costs. Nevertheless, its high oxidative capability and efficiency make AOPs a popular technique in tertiary treatment in which the most recalcitrant organic and inorganic contaminants are to be eliminated. The increasing interest in water reuse and more stringent regulations regarding water pollution are currently accelerating the implementation of AOPs at full-scale.
There are roughly 500 commercialized AOPs installations around the world at present, mostly in [[Europe]] and [[the United States]]. Other countries like [[China]] are showing increasing interests in AOPs.

==Chemical principles==
Generally speaking, chemistry in AOPs could be essentially divided into three parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mazille |first=Félicien |title=Advanced Oxidation Processes {{!}} SSWM. Sustainable Sanitation and Water Management |url=http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/semi-centralised-drinking-water-treatme-12 |accessdate=13 June 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120528100827/http://www.sswm.info/category/implementation-tools/water-purification/hardware/semi-centralised-drinking-water-treatme-12 |archivedate=May 28, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Formation of ·OH;
# Initial attacks on target molecules by ·OH and their breakdown to fragments;
# Subsequent attacks by ·OH until ultimate [[mineralization (geology)|mineralization]].
The mechanism of ·OH production (Part 1) highly depends on the sort of AOP technique that is used. For example, ozonation, UV/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and photocatalytic oxidation rely on different mechanisms of ·OH generation:
*UV/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name="audenaert" /&gt;
:H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + UV → 2·OH ''(homolytic bond cleavage of the O-O bond of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; leads to formation of 2·OH radicals)''

:O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + HO&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → HO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; ''(reaction between O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and a hydroxyl ion leads to the formation of H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (in charged form))''

:HO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;· → ·OH + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;
:''the reaction steps presented here are just a part of the reaction sequence, see reference for more details''
*Photocatalytic oxidation with TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;:&lt;ref name="beltran" /&gt;
:TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + UV → e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; + h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''(irradiation of the photocatalytic surface leads to an excited [[electron]] (e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) and electron gap (h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;)''
:Ti(IV) + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O {{eqm}} Ti(IV)-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O ''(water adsorbs onto the catalyst surface)''
:Ti(IV)-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + h&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; {{eqm}}  Ti(IV)-·OH + H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; ''the highly reactive electron gap will react with water''
:''the reaction steps presented here are just a part of the reaction sequence, see reference for more details''

Currently there is no consensus on the detailed mechanisms in Part 3, but researchers have cast light on the processes of initial attacks in Part 2. In essence, ·OH is a radical species and should behave like a highly reactive electrophile. Thus two type of initial attacks are supposed to be [[Hydrogen Abstraction]] and [[Addition reaction|Addition]]. The following scheme, adopted from a technical handbook and later refined, describes a possible mechanism of the oxidation of [[benzene]] by ·OH.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Solarchem Environmental System|title=The UV/Oxidation Handbook|year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

 [[File:Mechanism of OH with benzene.png|800px|Proposed mechanism of the oxidation of benzene by hydroxyl radicals]]

''Scheme 1. Proposed mechanism of the oxidation of benzene by hydroxyl radicals''

The first and second steps are electrophilic addition that breaks the aromatic ring in benzene (A) and forms two hydroxyl groups (–OH) in intermediate C. Later an ·OH grabs a hydrogen atom in one of the hydroxyl groups, producing a radical species (D) that is prone to undergo rearrangement to form a more stable radical (E). E, on the other hand, is readily attacked by ·OH and eventually forms 2,4-hexadiene-1,6-dione (F).
As long as there are sufficient ·OH radicals, subsequent attacks on compound F will continue until the fragments are all converted into small and stable molecules like H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in the end, but such processes may still be subject to a myriad of possible and partially unknown mechanisms.

==Advantages==
AOPs hold several advantages that are unparalleled in the field of water treatment:
*They can effectively eliminate organic compounds in aqueous phase, rather than collecting or transferring pollutants into another phase.
*Due to the remarkable reactivity of ·OH, it virtually reacts with almost every aqueous pollutant without discriminating. AOPs are therefore applicable in many, if not all, scenarios where many organic contaminants must be removed at the same time.
*Some [[heavy metals]] can also be removed in forms of precipitated M(OH)&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;.
*In some AOPs designs, [[disinfection]] can also be achieved, which makes these AOPs an integrated solution to some water quality problems.
*Since the complete reduction product of ·OH is H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, AOPs theoretically do not introduce any new hazardous substances into the water.

==Current shortcomings==
It should be realised that AOPs are not perfect and have several drawbacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Advanced Oxidation Processes|url=http://neopuretech.com/advanced-oxidation-processes/|publisher=Neopure Technologies|accessdate=27 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Most prominently, the cost of AOPs is fairly high, since a continuous input of expensive chemical reagents is required to maintain the operation of most AOP systems. As a result of their very nature, AOPs require hydroxyl radicals and other reagents proportional to the quantity of contaminants to be removed.
*Some techniques require pre-treatment of wastewater to ensure reliable performance, which could be potentially costly and technically demanding. For instance, presence of [[bicarbonate]] ions (HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) can appreciably reduce the concentration of ·OH due to [[Scavenger (chemistry)|scavenging processes]] that yield H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O and a much less reactive species, ·CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="munter"/&gt; As a result, bicarbonate must be wiped out from the system or AOPs are compromised.
*It is not cost effective to use solely AOPs to handle a large amount of wastewater; instead, AOPs should be deployed in the final stage after [[primary treatment|primary]] and [[secondary treatment]] have successfully removed a large proportion of contaminants.

==Future ==
Since AOPs were first defined in 1987, the field has witnessed a rapid development both in theory and in application. So far, TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/UV systems, H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/UV systems, and Fenton, photo-Fenton and Electro-Fenton systems have received extensive scrutiny. However, there are still many research needs on these existing AOPs.{{clarify|date=March 2016}}

Recent trends are the development of new, modified AOPs that are efficient and economical. In fact, there has been some studies that offer constructive solutions. For instance, [[doping (semiconductor)|doping]] TiO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with non-metallic elements could possibly enhance the [[photocatalytic]] activity;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thompson|first=Tracy L|author2=Yates, John T|title=Surface science studies of the photoactivation of TiO2–new photochemical processes|journal=Chemical Reviews|year=2006|volume=106|issue=10|pages=4428–4453|doi=10.1021/cr050172k|pmid=17031993}}&lt;/ref&gt; and implementation of ultrasonic treatment could promote the production of hydroxyl radicals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Berberidou|first=C|author2=Poulios I.|author3= Xekoukoulotakis, N.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7044">'''Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory''' (also known as APO) is a not-for-profit [[open access]] [[Disciplinary repository|subject repository]] or [[digital library]], specialising in public policy and practice [[grey literature]] and journal articles, mainly from Australia and New Zealand, with some coverage of other countries. Formerly known as Australian Policy Online, the organisation underwent a name change to Analysis &amp; Policy Observatory (APO) in 2017.

== Background ==

APO was established in 2002 by the Swinburne Institute for Social Research, at [[Swinburne University]] in [[Melbourne]]. It was intended as a way to collate and disseminate academic research reports and other [[grey literature]] that was increasingly proliferating online. It has since established itself as a notable resource for people involved in policy research in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]].&lt;ref name="broadband.unimelb"&gt;Bellamy, C., Gibbs, M., Williamson, A., Sean Cubit, S. (December 2011).  [http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/engage/pubs/wp/IBES-political-issue-analysis-system.pdf "Political Issue Analysis System: Policy deliberation in the age of information abundance"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140204050628/http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/engage/pubs/wp/IBES-political-issue-analysis-system.pdf |date=2014-02-04 }}. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from [http://broadband.unimelb.edu.au/ "Institute for a Broadband-Enabled Society"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100918084602/http://www.broadband.unimelb.edu.au/ |date=2010-09-18 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; It now sits as part of the Centre of Urban Transitions within Swinburne University of Technology.

APO is a not-for-profit organisation supported by partnerships with academic institutions and government agencies, grants donations and advertising revenue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apo.org.au/funding-and-support "Funding and support"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140313112458/http://apo.org.au/funding-and-support |date=2014-03-13 }}. Retrieved 13 March 2014 from [http://apo.org.au/ "Policy Online"].&lt;/ref&gt; Partners include the [[Australian National Data Service]], [[Australia and New Zealand School of Government|ANZSOG]], the [[University of Canberra]], the [[Henry Halloran]] Trust at the [[University of Sydney]], and the [[University of South Australia]]. APO has also been an awarded a number of [[Australian Research Council]] grants.

== Purpose ==

APO was established to address the transformation of the means of production for publications brought about by the internet. Frustrations with the limitations of the [[academic publishing]] system – long delays, lack of access or audience – were causing producers of academic and other content to move online and increasingly produce [[grey literature]] (informally published written material, such as reports, that may be difficult to trace via conventional channels). The informal channels used to disseminate digital grey literature have meant that libraries and other services have only been able to collect it in an ad hoc manner. APO aims to make digital research content that is relevant to Australian policy debates more easily discoverable, accessible and able to be managed.&lt;ref&gt;Mackey, M.,  Magnifico, C., Tyler, K. (August 2013). [https://www.scribd.com/doc/163740640/The-Effects-of-the-Internet-and-Open-Access-on-the-Usage-of-Grey-Literature-A-Review-of-the-Literature-Group-Project#download "The Effects of the Internet and Open Access on the Usage of Grey Literature: a review of the literature"]. Retrieved 18 November 2013 from  [https://www.scribd.com "Scribd"].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==

APO specialises in collecting public policy reports and articles from academic research centres, think tanks, government and non-government organisations. As well as research, the site includes a smaller collection of opinion and commentary pieces, video, audio and web resources focused on policy issues.&lt;ref&gt;[http://mediaaccess.org.au/research-policy/research/useful-research-and-policy-databases "Useful research and policy databases"]. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from [http://mediaaccess.org.au/ "Media Access Australia"].&lt;/ref&gt; Most content is produced by other organisations and collected and catalogued on the site, although some commentary is original to APO.

== Reception ==

In 2011, the then Secretary of the Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet described APO as providing “some of the most valuable and constructive contributions to Australia’s policy debate”.&lt;ref&gt;Moran, T. (28 July 2011).[http://www.dpmc.gov.au/media/speech_2011_07_28.cfm "The John Paterson Oration 2011"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111019235357/http://www.dpmc.gov.au/media/speech_2011_07_28.cfm |date=2011-10-19 }}. Retrieved 17 October 2013 from  [http://www.dpmc.gov.au/ "The Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet"].&lt;/ref&gt; However, APO has also been criticised on the grounds that it “could perhaps do more to engage with the formal political workings of government through providing access to formal government policy information.”&lt;ref name="broadband.unimelb" /&gt;

In 2012, the report of the Independent Inquiry into Media and Media Regulation by the Hon Raymond Antony Finkelstein QC stated that: "While the start-up costs for new print publications have been prohibitive and inhibited new enterprises emerging, the streamlining of the relationship between content producers and consumers has led to many new websites and web-based services. Among the most important such websites that have grown up in Australia over the last decade are Inside Story, Australian Policy Online, Online Opinion, The Drum, The Conversation, and New Matilda."&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, R. (March 2012).

In August 2014, APO won the "Information" category at the Australia &amp; New Zealand Internet Awards (ANZIA).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.internetawards.org.au/winners "Winners"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4653">'''Andreas Gotzmann''' (born 1960 in [[Karlsruhe]]) is a [[Germany|German]] historian of Judaism and scholar of religion. He holds the Chair for Jewish Studies and Religious Studies at the [[University of Erfurt]] (Germany).

== Education ==
Andreas Gotzmann graduated from the Hochschule für Jüdische Studien in Heidelberg and the Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg in 1988 with an M.A. in Jewish History, Rabbinics &amp; Codices, and Jewish Art History. He received his Ph.D. in Jewish Studies at the Freie Universität Berlin in 1995. Between 1990-1995 he was a research fellow in New York and Jerusalem; from 1994-1997 he was first a research assistant, then assistant professor for Jewish History and Culture at the Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität Frankfurt am Main; since 1999 full professor for Jewish Studies at the newly founded Erfurt University.

Amongst other memberships and positions, he was member of the executive board of the ‚Association for Jewish Studies in Germany‘ (Verband der Judaisten in Deutschland) from 2002–2006; between 2003-2007 director of the Religious Studies Seminar at Erfurt University; still long-time member of the executive board of the ‚German Board for Scientific Research‘ (Wissenschaftliche Arbeitsgemeinschaft) of the International Leo Baeck Institute etc. Amongst other invitations: Very Distinguished Harris Visiting Professor for Jewish History at Dartmouth College, Hanover NH in 2002.

== Research ==
Andreas Gotzmann authors numerous scholarly publications, mainly about German-Jewish history. His expertise covers the early modern and the modern period. Special fields of interest are research on cultural change and processes of social consolidation of cultural models and identities, legal and social history, as well as history of mentalities and ideas. Beyond that, he works on the theory and method of cultural history and is one of the leading scholars to introduce approaches and methods of cultural studies to Jewish studies. 
Next to his research in modern Jewish history, Gotzmann heads the international research cluster entitled ‚Jewish Holy Roman Empire‘ which draws together scholars and institutions from a multitude of countries since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;„[https://archive.is/20130212074650/http://www2.uni-erfurt.de/judaistik/project_cluster/juedisches_heiliges.shtml]“.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1478">'''Auroral kilometric radiation''' ('''AKR''') is the intense radio [[radiation]] emitted in the acceleration zone (at a height of three times the radius of the Earth) of the polar lights. The radiation mainly comes from [[cyclotron radiation]] from [[electrons]] orbiting around the [[magnetic field]] lines of the Earth. The radiation has a [[frequency]] of between 50 and 500&amp;nbsp;kHz and a total [[Power (physics)|power]] of between about 1 million and 10 million [[watt]]s. The radiation is absorbed by the [[ionosphere]] and therefore can only be measured by [[satellites]] positioned at vast heights, such as the [[Fast Auroral Snapshot Explorer (FAST)]]. According to the data of the [[Cluster mission]], it is beamed out in the cosmos in a narrow plane tangent to the magnetic field at the source.  The sound produced by playing AKR over an audio device has been described as "whistles", "chirps", and even "screams"{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}}.

As some other planets emit cyclotron radiation too, AKR could be used to learn more about [[Jupiter]], [[Saturn]], [[Uranus]] and [[Neptune]], and to detect [[extrasolar planet]]s.

'''Babelfy''' is a software [[algorithm]] for the disambiguation of text written in any language. Specifically, Babelfy performs the tasks of [[Multilinguality|multilingual]] [[Word Sense Disambiguation]] (i.e., the disambiguation of common nouns, verbs, adjectives and adverbs) and [[Entity Linking]] (i.e. the disambiguation of mentions to encyclopedic entities like people, companies, places, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;A. Moro, A. Raganato, R. Navigli. [http://wwwusers.di.uniroma1.it/~navigli/pubs/TACL_2014_Babelfy.pdf Entity Linking meets Word Sense Disambiguation: a Unified Approach]. Transactions of the Association for Computational Linguistics (TACL), 2, pp. 231-244, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Babelfy is based on the [[BabelNet]] multilingual semantic network and performs disambiguation and entity linking in three steps:

* It associates with each [[Vertex (graph theory)|vertex]] of the BabelNet semantic network, i.e., either [[concept]] or [[named entity]], a semantic signature, that is, a set of related vertices. This is a preliminary step which needs to be performed only once, independently of the input text.
* Given an input [[Written text|text]], it extracts all the linkable fragments from this text and, for each of them, lists the possible [[meaning (linguistics)|meanings]] according to the [[semantic network]].
* It creates a [[Graph (data structure)|graph-based]] semantic interpretation of the whole text by linking the candidate meanings of the extracted fragments using the previously-computed semantic signatures. It then extracts a dense [[Glossary of graph theory#Subgraphs|subgraph]] of this representation and selects the best candidate meaning for each fragment.

As a result, the text, written in any of the 271 [[language]]s supported by BabelNet, is output with possibly overlapping semantic annotations.

[[Image:Bioreporter.jpg|thumb|361px|right|'''Anatomy of a bioreporter organism.''' Upon exposure to a specific analyte, the promoter/reporter gene complex is transcribed into messenger RNA (mRNA) and then translated into a reporter protein that is ultimately responsible for generating a signal.]]

'''Bioreporters''' are intact, living [[microbial]] [[Cell (biology)|cells]] that have been [[genetically engineered]] to produce a measurable signal in response to a specific chemical or physical agent in their [[environment (biophysical)|environment]].  Bioreporters contain two essential genetic elements, a [[Promoter (biology)|promoter]] gene and a [[reporter gene]].  The promoter gene is turned on ([[Transcription (genetics)|transcribed]]) when the target agent is present in the cell’s environment.  The promoter gene in a normal bacterial cell is linked to other genes that are then likewise transcribed and then translated into proteins that help the cell in either combating or adapting to the agent to which it has been exposed.  In the case of a bioreporter, these genes, or portions thereof, have been removed and replaced with a reporter gene.  Consequently, turning on the promoter gene now causes the reporter gene to be turned on.  Activation of the reporter gene leads to production of reporter [[proteins]] that ultimately generate some type of a detectable signal.  Therefore, the presence of a signal indicates that the bioreporter has sensed a particular target agent in its environment.

Originally developed for fundamental analysis of factors affecting [[gene expression]], bioreporters were early on applied for the detection of environmental contaminants&lt;ref&gt;King, J.M.H. et al. (1990) Rapid, sensitive bioluminescence reporter technology for naphthalene exposure and biodegradation. Science 249, 778-781.http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/249/4970/778?ck=nck&lt;/ref&gt; and have since evolved into fields as diverse as [[medical diagnosis|medical diagnostics]], [[precision agriculture]], [[food safety]] assurance, process monitoring and control, and bio-[[microelectronic]] computing.  Their versatility stems from the fact that there exist a large number of [[reporter gene]] systems that are capable of generating a variety of signals.  Additionally, reporter genes can be genetically inserted into [[bacterial]], [[yeast]], [[plant]], and [[mammalian]] cells, thereby providing considerable functionality over a wide range of host vectors.

==Reporter gene systems==

Several types of reporter genes are available for use in the construction of bioreporter organisms, and the signals they generate can usually be categorized as either [[colorimetric]], [[fluorescent]], [[luminescent]], [[chemiluminescent]] or [[electrochemical]].  Although each functions differently, their end product always remains the same – a measurable signal that is proportional to the concentration of the unique chemical or physical agent to which they have been exposed.  In some instances, the signal only occurs when a secondary [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] is added to the [[bioassay]] (''luxAB'', Luc, and aequorin).  For other bioreporters, the signal must be activated by an external light source (GFP and UMT), and for a select few bioreporters, the signal is completely self-induced, with no exogenous substrate or external activation being required (''luxCDABE'').  The following sections outline in brief some of the reporter gene systems available and their existing applications.

===Bacterial luciferase (Lux)===

[[Image:Biolumplate.jpg|thumb|180px|right| Bioluminescence emitted from colonies of microbial cells containing the genes for bacterial luciferase.]]

[[Luciferase]] is a generic name for an [[enzyme]] that [[catalyzes]] a light-emitting reaction.  Luciferases can be found in bacteria, algae, fungi, jellyfish, insects, shrimp, and squid, and the resulting light that these organisms produce is termed bioluminescence.  In bacteria, the genes responsible for the light-emitting reaction (the ''lux'' genes) have been isolated and used extensively in the construction of bioreporters that emit a blue-green light with a maximum intensity at 490&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref&gt;Meighen, E.A. (1994) Genetics of bacterial bioluminescence. Annu. Rev. Genet. 28, 117-139. http://arjournals.annualreviews.org/doi/abs/10.1146/annurev.ge.28.120194.001001&lt;/ref&gt;  Three variants of ''lux'' are available, one that functions at &lt; 30°C, another at &lt; 37°C, and a third at &lt; 45°C.  The ''lux'' genetic system consists of five genes, ''luxA'', ''luxB'', ''luxC'', ''luxD'', and ''luxE''.  Depending on the combination of these genes used, several different types of [[bioluminescent]] bioreporters can be constructed.

===''luxAB'' Bioreporters===

''luxAB'' bioreporters contain only the ''luxA'' and ''luxB'' genes, which together are responsible for generating the light signal.  However, to fully complete the light-emitting reaction, a [[Substrate (chemistry)|substrate]] must be supplied to the cell.  Typically, this occurs through the addition of the chemical [[decanal]] at some point during the bioassay procedure.  Numerous ''luxAB'' bioreporters have been constructed within bacterial, yeast, insect, nematode, plant, and mammalian cell systems.

===''luxCDABE'' Bioreporters===

Instead of containing only the ''luxA'' and ''luxB'' genes, bioreporters can contain all five [[genes]] of the ''lux'' cassette, thereby allowing for a completely independent light generating system that requires no extraneous additions of substrate nor any [[Excited state|excitation]] by an external light source.  So in this bioassay, the bioreporter is simply exposed to a target [[analyte]] and a [[quantitative property|quantitative]] increase in bioluminescence results, often within less than one hour.  Due to their rapidity and ease of use, along with the ability to perform the bioassay repetitively in [[real-time data|real time]] and on-line, makes ''luxCDABE'' bioreporters extremely attractive.  Consequently, they have been incorporated into a diverse array of detection methodologies ranging from the sensing of environmental contaminants to the real-time monitoring of pathogen infections in living mice.

===Nonspecific ''lux'' Bioreporters===

Nonspecific ''lux'' bioreporters are typically used for the detection of chemical toxins.  They are usually designed to continuously bioluminesce.  Upon exposure to a chemical toxin, either the cell dies or its metabolic activity is retarded, leading to a decrease in [[bioluminescent]] light levels.  Their most familiar application is in the Microtox [http://www.modernwater.co.uk/monitoring/toxicity/] assay where, following a short exposure to several concentrations of the sample, the decreased [[bioluminescence]] can be correlated to relative levels of [[toxicity]].&lt;ref&gt;Hermens, J. et al. (1985) Quantitative structure-activity relationships and mixture toxicity of organic chemicals in Photobacterium phosphoreum: the Microtox test. Ecotoxicol. Environ. Saf. 9, 17-25. http://www.springerlink.com/content/m67248753tkj1111/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Firefly luciferase (Luc)===

[[Firefly luciferase]] catalyzes a reaction that produces visible light in the 550 – 575&amp;nbsp;nm range.  A click-beetle luciferase is also available that produces light at a peak closer to 595&amp;nbsp;nm.  Both luciferases require the addition of an exogenous substrate (luciferin) for the light reaction to occur.  Numerous ''luc''-based bioreporters have been constructed for the detection of a wide array of [[inorganic compound|inorganic]] and [[organic compound]]s of environmental concern.  The most promising applications, however, probably rely on introducing the genetic code of the firefly luciferase into other eukaryotic cells and tissues. 

====Medical diagnostics====
Insertion of the ''luc'' genes into a human cervical carcinoma cell line ([[HeLa]]) illustrated that tumor-cell clearance could be visualized within a living mouse by simply scanning with a charge-coupled device camera, allowing for [[chemotherapy]] treatment to rapidly be monitored on-line and in real-time.&lt;ref&gt;Contag, C.H. et al.

Neoplasia 2 (1-2), 41-52. http://neoreviews.aappublications.org/cgi/content/extract/1/12/e225&lt;/ref&gt;  In another example, the ''luc'' genes were inserted into human breast cancer cell lines to develop a bioassay for the detection and measurement of substances with potential [[estrogenic]] and antiestrogenic activity.&lt;ref&gt;Legler, J. et al.

====Research on gene regulation====
Particular [[Promoter (genetics)|promoters]] can be placed upstream of the ''luc'' gene, that is, the ''luc'' sequence can be fused to the promoter sequence at DNA level. If such construct is not too large in size, it can simply be introduced into eukaryotic cells using [[plasmids]]. This approach is widely used to study the activity of a given promoter in a given cell/tissue type, since the amount of light produced by the luciferase is directly proportional to the promoter activity &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovács KA, Steinmann M, Halfon O, Magistretti PJ, Cardinaux JR | title = C/EBPbeta couples dopamine signalling to substance P precursor gene expression in striatal neurones. | journal = Journal of Neurochemistry | volume = 98 | issue = 5 | pages = 1390-9 | date = September 2006 | pmid = 16771829 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-4159.2006.03957.x  }}&lt;/ref&gt;. In addition to studying the promoters, firefly luciferase assays offer the option of studying [[transcriptional activators]]: in these experiments typically the [[GAL4/UAS_system]] is used and its Gal4 upstream activating DNA sequence (UAS) is placed upstream the ''luc'' gene while the different activators or the different variants/fragments of the same activator are fused to the GAL4 DNA binding module at protein level. This way the transcriptional activity of the different GAL4 fusion proteins can be directly compared using light as a readout. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kovács KA, Steinmann M, Halfon O, Magistretti PJ, Cardinaux JR | title = Complex regulation of CREB-binding protein by homeodomain-interacting protein kinase 2 | journal = Cellular Signalling | volume = 27 | issue = 11 | pages = 2252–60 | date = November 2015 | pmid = 26247811 | doi = 10.1016/j.cellsig.2015.08.001  }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

===Aequorin===

[[Aequorin]] is a photoprotein isolated from the bioluminescent jellyfish ''[[Aequorea victoria]]''.  Upon addition of [[calcium]] ions (Ca2+) and coelenterazine, a reaction occurs whose end result is the generation of blue light in the 460 - 470&amp;nbsp;nm range.  Aequorin has been incorporated into human [[B cell]] lines for the detection of [[pathogenic]] bacteria and viruses in what is referred to as the [[Cell CANARY]] assay (Cellular Analysis and Notification of Antigen Risks and Yields).&lt;ref&gt;Rider, T. et al. (1999) In NASA/NCI Biomedical Imaging Symposium.&lt;/ref&gt;  The B cells are genetically engineered to produce aequorin.  Upon exposure to antigens of different pathogens, the recombinant B cells emit light as a result of activation of an intracellular signaling cascade that releases calcium ions inside the cell.

===Green fluorescent protein (GFP)===

[[Green fluorescent protein]] (GFP) is also a photoprotein isolated and cloned from the jellyfish ''[[Aequorea victoria]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Misteli, T. and Spector, D.L. (1997) Application of the green fluorescent protein in cell biology and biotechnology. Nat. Biotechnol. 15, 961-964.&lt;/ref&gt;  Variants have also been isolated from the sea pansy ''[[Renilla reniformis]]''.  GFP, like aequorin, produces a blue fluorescent signal, but without the required addition of an exogenous substrate.  All that is required is an [[ultraviolet light]] source to activate the fluorescent properties of the photoprotein.  This ability to autofluoresce makes GFP highly desirable in biosensing assays since it can be used on-line and in to monitor intact, living cells.  Additionally, the ability to alter GFP to produce light emissions besides blue (i.e., cyan, red, and yellow) allows it to be used as a multianalyte detector.  Consequently, GFP has been used extensively in bioreporter constructs within bacterial, yeast, nematode, plant, and mammalian hosts.

===Uroporphyrinogen (urogen) III methyltransferase (UMT)===

[[Uroporphyrinogen (urogen) III methyltransferase]] (UMT) catalyzes a reaction that yields two [[fluorescent]] products which produce a red-orange fluorescence in the 590 - 770&amp;nbsp;nm range when illuminated with [[ultraviolet light]].&lt;ref&gt;Sattler, I. et al. (1995) Cloning, sequencing, and expression of the uroporphyrinogen-III methyltransferase cobA gene of Propionibacterium freudenreichii (shermanii). J. Bacteriol. 177, 1564–1569.http://jb.asm.org/cgi/content/abstract/177/6/1564&lt;/ref&gt;  So as with GFP, no addition of exogenous substrates is required.  UMT has been used as a bioreporter for the selection of recombinant [[plasmids]], as a marker for gene [[Transcription (genetics)|transcription]] in bacterial, yeast, and mammalian cells, and for the detection of toxic salts such as [[arsenite]] and [[antimonite]].

}}
A '''body cavity''' is any fluid-filled space in a [[multicellular organism]] other than those of ''vessels'' (such as [[blood vessel]]s and [[lymph vessel]]s). The human body cavity normally refers to the [[ventral body cavity]], because it is by far the largest.

== Coelom ==
{{main|Coelom}}
A [[coelom]] is a cavity lined by [[mesothelium]], an [[epithelium]] derived from [[mesoderm]]. Organs formed inside a coelom can freely move, grow, and develop independently of the body wall while fluid cushions and protects them from shocks.

[[Arthropod]]s and most [[Mollusca|mollusc]]s have a reduced (but still true) coelom, usually the [[pericardial cavity]] and the gonocoel. Their principal body cavity is the ''hemocoel'' or ''haeomocoel'' of an [[open circulatory system]], often derived from the blastocoel.

Mammalian embryos develop two cavities: the [[intraembryonic coelom]] and the [[extraembryonic coelom]] (or [[chorionic cavity]]). The intraembryonic coelom is lined by somatic and splanchnic lateral plate mesoderm, while the extraembryonic coelom is lined by extraembryonic mesoderm. The intraembryonic coelom is the only cavity that persists in the mammal at term, which is why its name is often contracted to simply ''coelomic cavity''. Subdividing the coelomic cavity into compartments, for example, the [[pericardial cavity]] / [[pericardium]], where the heart develops, simplifies discussion of the [[anatomy|anatomies]] of complex animals.

Organisms can be also classified according to the type of body cavity they possess.&lt;ref name="urlAnimals III — Pseudocoelomates and Protostome Coelomates"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://courses.bio.psu.edu/fall2005/biol110/tutorials/tutorial39.htm |title=Animals III — Pseudocoelomates and Protostome Coelomates |work= |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090406000959/http://courses.bio.psu.edu/fall2005/biol110/tutorials/tutorial39.htm |archivedate=2009-04-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Human body cavities==
[[File:Scheme body cavities-en.svg|thumb|300px|Picture of [[human body cavities]] — dorsal body cavity to the left and ventral body cavity to the right.]]
Anatomical structures are often described in terms of the cavity in which they reside. The body maintains its internal organization by means of membranes, sheaths, and other structures that separate compartments. The '''dorsal''' (posterior) cavity and the '''ventral''' (anterior) cavity are the largest body compartments. These cavities contain and protect delicate internal organs, and the ventral cavity allows for significant changes in the size and shape of the organs as they perform their functions. The lungs, heart, stomach, and intestines, for example, can expand and contract without distorting other tissues or disrupting the activity of nearby organs.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology "&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cnx.org/content/col11496/latest/ | title=Anatomy &amp; Physiology | publisher=Openstax college at Connexions | accessdate=November 16, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ventral cavity includes the '''thoracic''' and '''abdominopelvic''' cavities and their subdivisions. The dorsal cavity includes the '''cranial''' and '''spinal''' cavities.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology " /&gt;
*The cranial cavity is a large, bean-shaped cavity filling most of the upper skull where the brain is located.
*The vertebral cavity is a very narrow, thread-like cavity running from the cranial cavity down the entire length of the spinal cord.
Together the cranial cavity and vertebral cavity can be referred to as the dorsal body cavity.
In the posterior (dorsal) cavity, the cranial cavity houses the brain, and the spinal cavity (or vertebral cavity) encloses the spinal cord. Just as the brain and spinal cord make up a continuous, uninterrupted structure, the cranial and spinal cavities that house them are also continuous. The brain and spinal cord are protected by the bones of the skull and vertebral column and by cerebrospinal fluid, a colorless fluid produced by the brain, which cushions the brain and spinal cord within the posterior (dorsal) cavity.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology " /&gt;

The thoracic cavity consists of three cavities that fill the interior area of the chest.
*The two pleural cavities are situated on both sides of the body, anterior to the spine and lateral to the breastbone.
*The [[Mediastinum#Superior mediastinum|superior mediastinum]] is a wedge-shaped cavity located between the superior regions of the two thoracic cavities.
*The pericardial cavity within the [[mediastinum]] is located at the center of the chest below the superior mediastinum. The pericardial cavity roughly outlines the shape of the heart.
The diaphragm divides the thoracic and the abdominal cavities. The abdominal cavity occupies the entire lower half of the trunk, anterior to the spine. Just under the abdominal cavity, anterior to the buttocks, is the pelvic cavity. The pelvic cavity is funnel shaped and is located inferior and anterior to the abdominal cavity. Together the abdominal and pelvic cavity can be referred to as the abdominopelvic cavity while the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic cavities together can be referred to as the ventral body cavity.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology " /&gt;
Subdivisions of the Posterior (Dorsal) and Anterior (Ventral) Cavities
The anterior (ventral) cavity has two main subdivisions: the thoracic cavity and the abdominopelvic cavity. The thoracic cavity is the more superior subdivision of the anterior cavity, and it is enclosed by the rib cage. The thoracic cavity contains the lungs and the heart, which is located in the mediastinum. The diaphragm forms the floor of the thoracic cavity and separates it from the more inferior abdominopelvic cavity. The abdominopelvic cavity is the largest cavity in the body. Although no membrane physically divides the abdominopelvic cavity, it can be useful to distinguish between the abdominal cavity, the division that houses the digestive organs, and the pelvic cavity, the division that houses the organs of reproduction.&lt;ref name="Openstax Anatomy &amp; Physiology " /&gt;

==Development==
At the end of the third week, the [[neural tube]], which is a fold of one of the layers of the [[trilaminar germ disc]], called the [[ectoderm]], appears. This layer elevates and closes dorsally, while the gut tube rolls up and closes ventrally to create a “tube on top of a tube.” The [[mesoderm]], which is another layer of the trilaminar germ disc, holds the tubes together and the [[lateral plate mesoderm]], the middle layer of the germ disc, splits to form a visceral layer associated with the gut and a parietal layer, which along with the overlying ectoderm, forms the lateral body wall. The space between the visceral and parietal layers of lateral plate mesoderm is the primitive body cavity. When the lateral body wall folds, it moves ventrally and fuses at the midline. The body cavity closes, except in the region of the connecting stalk. Here, the gut tube maintains an attachment to the yolk sac. The yolk sac is a membranous sac attached to the embryo, which provides nutrients and functions as the circulatory system of the very early embryo.&lt;ref name= Langman&gt;{{cite book |last1  = Sadler |title= LANGMAN Embriología médica |publisher = The Point | place = Philadelphia, PA | volume= I | edition = 12 |year= 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lateral body wall folds, pulling the [[amnion]] in with it so that the amnion surrounds the embryo and extends over the connecting stalk, which becomes the [[umbilical cord]], which connects the fetus with the [[placenta]]. If the ventral body wall fails to close, ventral body wall defects can result, such as [[ectopia cordis]], a congenital malformation in which the heart is abnormally located outside the thorax. Another defect is gastroschisis, a congenital defect in the anterior abdominal wall through which the abdominal contents freely protrude. Another possibility is bladder exstrophy, in which part of the urinary bladder is present outside the body. In normal circumstances, the parietal mesoderm will form the parietal layer of serous membranes lining the outside (walls) of the peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial cavities. The visceral layer will form the visceral layer of the [[serous membrane]]s covering the lungs, heart, and abdominal organs. These layers are continuous at the root of each organ as the organs lie in their respective cavities. The [[peritoneum]], a serum membrane that forms the lining of the abdominal cavity, forms in the gut layers and in places mesenteries extend from the gut as double layers of peritoneum. Mesenteries provide a pathway for vessels, nerves, and lymphatics to the organs. Initially, the gut tube from the caudal end of the foregut to the end of the hindgut is suspended from the dorsal body wall by dorsal mesentery. Ventral mesentery, derived from the septum transversum, exists only in the region of the terminal part of the esophagus, the stomach, and the upper portion of the duodenum.&lt;ref name= Tortis&gt;{{cite book |last1= Tortora |first1= Gerard |last2= Derrickson |first2 = Bryan  |title= Principios de anatomía y fisiología |publisher = Panamericana | place= Buenos Aires |volume  = I |edition = 11 | year= 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; (Position-Specific Iterated) BLAST which computes the mutation profile with substitution probabilities and mixes it with the query profile [2]. CSI-BLAST (Context-Specific Iterated BLAST) is the context specific analog of PSI-BLAST (Position-Specific Iterated) BLAST. Both of these programs are available as web-server and are available for free download.

== Background ==
Homology is the relationship between biological structures or sequences derived from a common ancestor. Homologous proteins (proteins who have common ancestry) are inferred from their sequence similarity. Inferring homologous relationships involves calculating scores of aligned pairs minus penalties for gaps. Aligning pairs of proteins identify regions of similarity indicating a relationship between the two, or more, proteins. In order to have a homologous relationship, the sum of scores over all the aligned pairs of amino acids or nucleotides must be sufficiently high [2]. Standard methods of sequence comparisons use a [[substitution matrix]] to accomplish this [4]. Similarities between amino acids or nucleotides are quantified in these substitution matrices. The substitution score (&lt;math&gt;S&lt;/math&gt;) of amino acids &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; can we written as follows:

&lt;math&gt;S(a,b) = const \times \log \left ( \frac{P(a|b)}{P(a)} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P(a|b)&lt;/math&gt; denotes the probability of amino acid &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; mutating into amino acid &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; [2]. In a large set of sequence alignments, counting the number of amino acids  as well as the number of aligned pairs &lt;math&gt;(a, b)&lt;/math&gt; will allow you to derive the probabilities &lt;math&gt;P(a|b)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P(a)&lt;/math&gt;.

Since protein sequences need to maintain a stable structure, a residue’s substitution probabilities are largely determined by the structural context of where it is found. As a result, substitution matrices are trained for structural contexts. Since context information is encoded in transition probabilities between states, mixing mutation probabilities from substitution matrices weighted for corresponding states achieves improved alignment qualities when compared to standard substitution matrices. CS-BLAST improves further upon this concept. The figure illustrates the sequence to sequence and profile to sequence equivalence with the alignment matrix. The query profile results from the artificial mutations in which the bar heights are proportional to the corresponding amino acid probabilities [4].

(A FIGURE NEEDS TO GO HERE THIS IS THE CAPTION) “Sequence search/alignment algorithms find the path that maximizes the sum of similarity scores (color-coded blue to red). Substitution matrix scores are equivalent to profile scores if the sequence profile (colored histogram) is generated from the query sequence by adding artificial  mutations with the substitution matrix pseudocount scheme. Histogram bar heights represent the fraction of amino acids in profile columns” [4].

== Performance ==
CS-BLAST greatly improves alignment quality over the entire range of sequence identities and especially for difficult alignments in comparison to regular BLAST and PSI-BLAST. PSI-BLAST (Position-Specific Iterated BLAST) runs at about the same speed per iteration as regular BLAST, but is able to detect weaker sequence similarities that are still biologically relevant [3]. Alignment quality is based on alignment sensitivity and alignment precision [4].

=== Alignment Quality ===
Alignment sensitivity is measured by correctly comparing predicted alignments of residue pairs to the total number of possible alignable pairs. This is calculated with the fraction: (pairs correctly aligned)/(pairs structurally alignable)

Alignment precision is measured by the correctness of aligned residue pairs. This is calculated with the fraction: (pairs correctly aligned)/(pairs aligned)

=== Search Performance ===
The graph is the benchmark Biegert and Söding used to evaluate homology detection. The benchmark compares CS-BLAST to BLAST using true positives from the same superfamily versus false positive of pairs from different folds [4]. (A GRAPH NEEDS TO GO HERE)

The other graph uses detects true positives (with a different scale than the previous graph) and false positives of PSI-BLAST and CSI-BLAST and compares the two for one to five iterations [4]. (A DIFFERENT GRAPH NEEDS TO GO HERE)

CS-BLAST offers improved sensitivity and alignment quality in sequence comparison. Sequence searches with CS-BLAST are more than twice as sensitive as BLAST [4]. It produces higher quality alignments and generates reliable E-values without a loss of speed. CS-BLAST detects 139% more homologous proteins at a cumulative error rate of 20% [2]. At a 10% error rate, 138% more homologs are detected, and for the easiest cases at a 1% error rate, CS-BLAST was still 96% more effective than BLAST [2]. Additionally, CS-BLAST in 2 iterations is more sensitive than 5 iterations of PSI-BLAST. About 15% more homologs were detected in comparison [4].

== Method ==
The CS-BLAST method derives similarities between sequence context-specific amino acids for 13 residue windows centered on each residue. CS-BLAST works by generating a sequence profile for a query sequence by using context-specific mutations and then jumpstarting a profile-to-sequence search method.

CS-BLAST starts by predicting the expected mutation probabilities for each position. For a certain residue, a sequence window of ten total surrounding residues is selected as seen in the image. Then, Biegert and Söding compared the sequence window to a library with thousands of context profiles. The library is generated by clustering a representative set of sequence profile windows. The actual predicting of mutation probabilities is achieved by weighted mixing of the central columns of the most similar context profiles [4]. This aligns short profiles that are nonhomologous and ungapped which gives higher weight to better matching profiles, making them easier to detect [4]. A sequence profile represents a multiple alignment of homologous sequences and describes what amino acids are likely to occur at each position in related sequences. With this method substitution matrices are unnecessary. In addition, there is no need for transition probabilities as a result of the fact that context information is encoded within the context profiles. This makes computation simpler and allows for runtime to be scaled linearly instead of quadratically.

(A FIGURE GOES HERE AND THIS IS THE CAPTION) “Computation of context-specific pseudocounts. The Expected mutations (i.e., pseudocounts) for a residue (highlighted in yellow) are calculated based on the sequence context around it (red box). Library profiles contribute to the context-specific sequence profile with weights determined by their similarity to the sequence context. The resulting profile can be used to jump-start PSI-BLAST, which will then perform a sequence-to-sequence search with context-specific amino acid similarities” [4].

The context specific mutation probability, the probability of observing a specific amino acid in a homologous sequence given a context, is calculated by a weighted mixing of the amino acids in the central columns of the most similar context profiles. The image illustrates the calculation of expected mutation probabilities for a specific residue at a certain position. As seen in the image, the library of context profiles all contribute based on similarity to the context specific sequence profile for the query sequence [4].

== Models  ==
In predicting substitution probabilities using only the amino acid’s local sequence context, you gain the advantage of not needing to know the structure of the query protein while still allowing for the detection of more homologous proteins than standard substitution matrices [4]. Bigert and Söding’s approach to predicting substitution probabilities was based on a generative model. In another paper in collaboration with Angermüller, they develop a discriminative machine learning method that improves prediction accuracy [2].

=== Generative Model ===
Given an observed variable &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and a target variable &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;, a generative model defines the probabilities &lt;math&gt;P(x, y)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; P(y)&lt;/math&gt; separately. In order to predict the unobserved target variable, &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;,  Bayes’ theorem, &lt;math&gt;P(y|x) = \left ( \frac{P(x|y)P(y)}{[\textstyle \sum_{y}P(x|y)P(y) \displaystyle]} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

is used. A generative model, as the name suggests, allows one to generate new data points &lt;math&gt;(x, y)&lt;/math&gt;. The joint distribution is described as &lt;math&gt;P(x,y) = P(x|y)P(y)&lt;/math&gt;. To train a generative model, the following equation is used to maximize the joint probability &lt;math&gt;\prod\left ( \frac{P(x_n,y_n)}{trainingData(x_n,y_n)} \right )&lt;/math&gt;.

=== Discriminative Model ===
The discriminative model is a logistic regression maximum entropy classifier. With the discriminative model, the goal is to predict a context specific substitution probability given a query sequence. The discriminative approach for modeling substitution probabilities,&lt;math&gt;P(a|C_l)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;C_l&lt;/math&gt; describes a sequence of amino acids around position &lt;math&gt;l&lt;/math&gt; of a sequence, is based on &lt;math&gt;K&lt;/math&gt; context states. Context states are characterized by parameters emission weight (&lt;math&gt;v_k(a)&lt;/math&gt;), bias weight (&lt;math&gt;\pi_k&lt;/math&gt;), and context weight (&lt;math&gt;\lambda_k(j,a)&lt;/math&gt;) [2]. Emission probabilities from a context state are given by the emission weights as follows for &lt;math&gt;d=1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;20&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;P(a|k) = \left ( \frac{exp(v_k(a))}{\sum exp(v_k(a'))} \right )&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;P(a|k)&lt;/math&gt; is the emission probability and  is the context state. In the discriminative approach, probability for a context state &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; given context &lt;math&gt;C_l&lt;/math&gt; is modeled directly by the exponential of an affine function of the context account profile where &lt;math&gt;C_l(j,a)&lt;/math&gt; is the context count profile with a normalization constant &lt;math&gt;Z(C_l)&lt;/math&gt; normalizes the probability to 1. This equation is as follows where the first summation takes &lt;math&gt;j=-d&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; and the second summation takes &lt;math&gt;a=1&lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt;20&lt;/math&gt;: &lt;math&gt;P(k|C_l) = \left ( \frac{1}{Z(C_l)}exp(\pi_k + \pi\sum\sum \lambda_k(j,a)(C_l(j,a)) \right)&lt;/math&gt;.

As with the generative model, target distribution is obtained by mixing the emission probabilities of each context state weighted by the similarity.

== Using CS-BLAST ==
The MPI Bioinformatics toolkit in an interactive website and service that allows anyone to do comprehensive and collaborative protein analysis with a variety of different tools including CS-BLAST as well as PSI-BLAST [1]. This tool allows for input of a protein and select options for you to customize your analysis. It also can forward the output to other tools as well.

The chemistry of the Casparian strip has been described as composed of suberin. According to some studies,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Casparian strip begins as a localized deposition of [[natural phenol|phenolic]] and [[unsaturated fat]]ty substances in the middle [[Lamella (cell biology)|lamella]] between the radial walls, as partly oxidized films. The primary wall becomes encrusted with and later thickened by deposits of similar substances on the inside of that wall. The encrustation of the cell wall by the material constituting the Casparian strip presumably plugs the pores that would have otherwise allowed the movement of water and nutrients via [[capillary action]] along that path.&lt;ref name="frey"&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cytoplasm]] of the [[Endodermis|endodermal]] cell is firmly attached to the Casparian strip so that it does not readily separate from the strip when the cells are subjected to contraction of the [[protoplast]]s. At the root, the casparian strip is embedded within the cell wall of endodermal cells in the non-growing region of the root behind the root tip.&lt;ref name="Taiz"&gt;Taiz, L., Zeiger, Eduardo, Møller, Ian Max, &amp; Murphy, Angus. (2015). Plant physiology and development (Sixth ed.).&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt; Here, the casparian strip serves as a boundary layer separating the apoplast of the cortex from the apoplast of the vascular tissue thereby blocking diffusion of material between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grebe | first1 = M | year = 2011 | title = Unveiling the Casparian strip | url = | journal = Nature | volume = 473 | issue = 7347| pages = 294–5 | doi=10.1038/473294a| pmid = 21593860 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This separation forces water and solutes to pass through the plasma membrane via a symplastic route in order to cross the endodermis layer.&lt;ref name="Taiz" /&gt;

Casparian strips differentiate after an outward growth of the [[Cortex (botany)|cortex]] is completed. At this level of the root development, the primary [[xylem]] of its vascular cylinder is only partly advanced. In [[gymnosperm]]s and [[angiosperm]]s displaying secondary growth, the roots commonly develop only endodermis with Casparian strips. In many of those, the endodermis is later discarded, together with the cortex, when the [[periderm]] develops from the [[pericycle]]. If the pericycle is superficial and the cortex is retained, either the endodermis is stretched or crushed or it keeps pace with the expansion of the vascular cylinder by radial [[wikt:anticline|anticlinal]] divisions, and the new walls develop Casparian strips in continuity with the old ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the absence of secondary growth (most [[monocotyledon]]s and a few [[eudicot]]s), the endodermis commonly undergoes wall modifications. There are two developmental stages beyond the development of the Casparian strip. In the second stage suberin (or endoderm&lt;ref name="frey" /&gt;) coats the entire wall on the inside of the cell. As a result, the Casparian strip is separated from the cytoplasm and the connection between the two ceases to be evident. In the third stage, a thick [[cellulose]] layer is deposited over the suberin, sometimes mainly on the inner tangential walls. The thickened wall, as well as the original wall in which the Casparian strip is located, may become lignified, creating a secondary cell wall. The Casparian strip may be identifiable after the thickening of the endodermal wall has occurred. The thickened endodermal wall may have pits. The successive development of endodermal walls is clearly expressed in monocotyledons. In dicotyledons, the distinction between.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Center of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB)''' is a highly distinguished biological research institute in [[Asia]], located on the West Bank of the picturesque Canal Road [[Lahore]], [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], [[Pakistan]]. It is an autonomous organization that is under administrative control of [[University of the Punjab]], Lahore, Pakistan.

==History==
On 1 November 1981, University of the Punjab announced the "birth" of the Centre.  In April, 1983 the Federal Government allocated a sum of 1.635 million rupees to create a nucleus laboratory of the Centre.  In November, 1985 the proposal to establish the Centre for Advanced Molecular Biology (CAMB) was approved at a cost of 24.55 million rupees.  In 1986, the CAMB project was upgraded into a Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB) and the cost of setting it up was subsequently revised in January 1991, to 44.33 million rupees.  In April 1987, the Federal Ministry of Science &amp; Technology (MOST) approved the establishment of a Centre for Applied Molecular Biology (CAMB), located back to back with the laboratory block of the Centre of Excellence in Molecular Biology (CEMB).
The CEMB established nucleus laboratories in March, 1985 in two student laboratories of the Department of Zoology, University of the Punjab, Quaid-e-Azam Campus, Lahore.  Construction work on the CEMB building started in 1987 on a site located in Lahore's southern suburb of Thokar Niaz Baig along the Canal.  The scientific staff moved into the new building in late 1992-93.

==Admission process==

The Centre offers [[Master of Science|M.Phil]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in [[Molecular Biology]]. Annually, only 20-30 position for academically brilliant students with research aptitude, from all over the world, are available for M.Phil and Ph.D. The admission process is one of the toughest and highly competitive in [[Pakistan]] with admission rate of around 10% annually. A greater number of foreign scholars are also pursuing their M.Phil and Ph.D in the centre.

==Research groups==

CEMB has the following research groups:

#Applied and Functional Genomics
#Bioinformatics
#Congenital Mental Retardation
#Crop Breeding and GMO Detection Group
#Development of Recombinant Biopharmaceuticals
#Forensic Research Lab
#Forensic Services Lab
#Hearing Impairment
#Medical Genetics Group
#Molecular Medicine
#Molecular Virology and Molecular diagnostics
#Plant Biosafety,
#Plant Genomics,
#Plant Transformation
#Seed Biotechnology
#Stem Cell Research
#Vision Impairment

==Achievements==
CEMB researchers have made a great contribution to Molecular Biology. Recently, CEMB has made Bt transgenic rice, Bt transgenic cotton and virus-free gladiolus, potato and tomato. Several kits are made for the PCR-based diagnosis of HCV and HBV . A total of 11 new deafness loci, 3 vision impairment loci and 17 new genes are discovered here. All these results have been published in the form of research papers in more than 100 international journals of high reputation including Nature, American Journal of Human Genetics, European Journal of Human Genetics, Molecular Vision, Virology Journal, Infectious Diseases, PLoS, Differentiation, Forensic Science International and International Journal of Legal Medicine. Besides, CEMB holds the rights to 7 patents for inventions made by its scientists. In recognition of these achievements, Islamic Development Bank conferred it with Science and Technology Prize in 2008.

==International collaborations==
As research in general and molecular biology in particular is an expensive business to do, CEMB often has collaborations with many national and international research institutes. These include National Institute of Health (NIH) USA, University of Cincinnati, University of Washington, University of Arizona, Johns-Hopkins University, Brigham Young University and US Department of Agriculture.

==Local collaborations==
CEMB also has linkages with local institutes like Quaid-e-Azam University Islamabad, University of Veterinary and Animal Sciences Lahore, University of Lahore, Lahore College for Women University, Forman Christian University Lahore, Comsats Islamabad, Abdul Wali Khan University Mardan, Bahauddin Zakariya University Multan, Government College University Lahore, Government College University Faisalabad, Baluchistan University of Information Technology, Engineering and Management Sciences, Quetta, Sheikh Zayed Hospital Lahore, University of Health Sciences Lahore, Jinnah Hospital Lahore, King Edwards Medical University Lahore and Allama Iqbal Medical College Lahore.

==CEMB and CAMB==

CEMB is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Education (MOE) and CAMB is under the administrative control of the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST). Although, both are independent and autonomous, CEMB is the academic and basic research wing while CAMB is the applied and commercial production wing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10750">'''Confession inscriptions of [[Lydia]] and [[Phrygia]]''' are Roman-era [[Koine Greek]] religious [[stele]]s from these historical regions of [[Anatolia]] (then part of [[Asia (Roman province)|Asia]] and [[Galatia (Roman province)|Galatia]]  provinces), dating mostly to the 2nd and 3rd centuries.

The new element that appears, the public [[Confession (religion)|confession]] of sin and the [[redemption (theology)|redemption]] through offerings (lytra), unknown to traditional [[Religion in ancient Greece|Greek religion]], has made scholars to name this social phenomenon as oriental. The religious thought and the use of vernacular Koine Greek, full of innovative orthography,syntax and grammar, suggests that they may also represent something at the root of religion in Phrygia and Lydia.&lt;ref&gt;Angels and Principalities: The Background, Meaning and Development of the Pauline Phrase hai archai kai hai exousiai A. Wesley Carr [https://books.google.com/books?id=Cnjptnn7EjEC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=Phrygia+Lydia++inscriptions+oriental+confession#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Page 56] {{ISBN|0-521-23429-8}} (2005)&lt;/ref&gt; Marijana Ricl has argued that the practice of confession is a reminiscence of [[Hittite religion]]. According to Schnabel E.J  it was a counter-move prompted by the increasing success of the Christian missionaries.&lt;ref&gt;Deutungen des Todes Jesu im neuen Testament edited by Jörg Frey, Jens Schröter [https://books.google.com/books?id=upHACoCciKQC&amp;pg=PA292&amp;dq=a+counter-move+prompted+by+the+increasing+success+of+the+Christian+missionaries#v=onepage&amp;q=a%20counter-move%20prompted%20by%20the%20increasin Page 292] {{ISBN|3-16-148581-5}}  (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, beside the scheme of confession/redemption, phraseology and terms remind of Greek [[New Testament]]: [[hamartia]] (sin), [[paraclete|parakletos]] (advocator), [[Slavery in antiquity|doulos]] tou theou (slave of god), [[kyrios]] (master), [[basileus]] (king). Another point for discussion is the punishment of sexual transgressions, which further relates the inscriptions to Christianity and the concept of [[chastity]] in [[:Category:Hellenistic philosophy and religion|Hellenistic philosophy and religion]]; in contrast to the previous perception of sexuality inside the religion ([[Hieros gamos]], [[Sacred prostitution]], [[Aphrodite Pandemos]]).

Some indicating names or epithets of deities engaged in the inscriptions are: [[Men (god)|Men]] (Axiottenos, Artemidoros),  Meter  (mother), [[Zeus]] (Aithrios, Keraunios, Soter), [[Apollo]], [[Hypsistos]], [[Anaitis]], [[Attis]], [[Dionysos]], Hades, [[Herakles]], [[Sabazios]], Batenos, [[Nemesis (mythology)|Nemesis]], [[Asclepius]], Tyrannos, Basileus, Theos Strapton and Bronton, [[Hecate]], [[Artemis]] etc.

According to George Petzl, a trial of sacred theatre did take place in the sanctuary; Theodoros was convicted and jailed. Zeus was impersonated by a priest. According to Ender Varinlioglu ''phylake'' jail is used metaphorically. Blindness was the jail/punishment upon Theodoros in order to be salvated from his ''licentious sexual activities''.&lt;ref&gt;The Greco-Roman East: politics, culture, society By Stephen Colvin [https://books.google.com/books?id=y0z0Vd3ZJugC&amp;pg=RA1-PA28&amp;dq=Haplokomas#v=onepage&amp;q=Haplokomas&amp;f=false Page 28] {{ISBN|0-521-82875-9}}  (2004)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP)''' is a term describing a temporary delay in the skeletal growth and thus height of a child with no physical abnormalities causing the delay.  Short stature may be the result of a growth pattern inherited from a parent (familial) or occur for no apparent reason (idiopathic).  Typically at some point during childhood, growth slows down, eventually resuming at a normal rate.  CDGP is the most common cause of [[short stature]] and delayed puberty.

==Background==
Children with '''constitutional delay of growth and puberty''' (CDGP), the most common cause of short stature and pubertal delay in males, typically have slowed linear growth within the first 3 years of life. In this variant of normal growth, linear growth velocity and weight gain slows beginning as young as age 3–6 months, resulting in downward crossing of growth percentiles, which often continues until age 2–3 years. At that time, growth resumes at a normal rate, and these children grow either along the lower growth percentiles or beneath the curve but parallel to it for the remainder of the prepubertal years.

At the expected time of puberty, the height of children with CDGP begins to drift further from the growth curve because of delay in the onset of the pubertal growth spurt. [[Catch-up growth]], onset of puberty, and pubertal growth spurt occur later than average, resulting in normal adult stature and sexual development. Although CDGP is a '''variant of normal growth''' rather than a disorder, delays in growth and sexual development may contribute to psychological difficulties, warranting treatment for some individuals. Recent studies have suggested that '''referral bias''' is largely responsible for the impression that normal short stature per se is a cause of psycho-social problems; non-referred children with short stature do not differ from those with more normal stature in school performance or socialization.

==Pathophysiology==

CDGP is a global delay in development that affects every organ system. Delays in growth and sexual development are quantified by skeletal age, which is determined from bone age radio-graphic studies of the left hand and wrist. Growth and development are appropriate for an individual's biologic age (skeletal age) rather than for their chronological age. Timing and tempo of growth and development are delayed in accordance with the biologic state of maturity.

Approximately 15% of patients with short stature referred for endocrinologic evaluation have CDGP. Individuals with CDGP and familial short stature represent another 23%. The frequency of CDGP may be underestimated because individuals with milder delays and those who are not psychologically stressed may not be seen by subspecialists. In a study of 555 (out of 80,000) schoolchildren below the third percentile in height for age with growth rates below normal (&lt;5&amp;nbsp;cm/y), twice as many boys as girls were affected. CDGP was found in 28% of boys and 24% of girls, and another 18% of boys and 16% of girls had familial short stature in combination with CDGP.

==Mortality/Morbidity==

CDGP is not associated with increased mortality because it is a variant of normal growth rather than a disease. However, in some affected individuals, it can be associated with significant psychological stress, resulting in poor self-image and social withdrawal. In recent years, researchers have also found that individuals with CDGP may be at increased risk for reduced bone mass in adulthood because of the delay in sex steroid influence on bone accrual during adolescence.

==Frequency==

Although the epidemiologic data indicate that all variants of normal growth are twice as common in boys as in girls, referrals for short stature reflect an even more divergent sex ratio. This likely reflects greater concern about males who are shorter than their peers or who have delayed sexual development.
No racial bias has been identified. Patterns of growth consistent with CDGP occur in infants as young as 3–6 months. However, individuals often do not seek medical attention until puberty, when lack of sexual development becomes a concern and discrepancy in height from peers is magnified by the delay in pubertal growth spurt.

==Clinical History==

Individuals with constitutional delay of growth and puberty (CDGP) are usually of normal size at birth. Deceleration in both height and weight velocity typically occurs within the first 3–6 months of life. This shift downward is similar to that observed in infants experiencing normal lag-down growth but tends to be more severe and prolonged. Individual variation is substantial; however, most children resume a normal growth velocity by age 2–3 years. During childhood, these individuals grow along or parallel to the lower percentiles of the growth curve.

[[Skeletal age]], which is estimated from radiographic studies of the left hand and wrist, is usually delayed (typically 2-4 y by late childhood) and is most consistent with the child's height age (age for which a child's height is at the 50th percentile) rather than the child’s chronologic age. Because the timing of the onset of puberty, pubertal growth spurt, 
and epiphyseal fusion are determined by a child's skeletal age (biologic age), children with CDGP are often referred to as "'''late bloomers'''."
    
At the usual age for puberty, these children continue to grow at a prepubertal rate appropriate for their biologic stage of development. Natural slowing of linear growth just before onset of puberty may be exaggerated, emphasizing the difference in size from peers who are accelerating in growth. The timing of the pubertal growth spurt is delayed, and the spurt may be prolonged with a lower peak height velocity. In patients with both CDGP and familial short stature, the degree of growth retardation may appear more severe, but the adult height is appropriate for the genetic background.

==Physical==

Physical examination findings in patients with CDGP are essentially normal, with the exception of immature appearance for age. Body proportions may reflect the delay in growth. During childhood, the upper-to-lower body ratio may be greater than normal, reflecting more infantile proportions. In adults, the ratio is often reduced (i.e., &lt;1 in whites, &lt;0.9 in blacks) as a result of the longer period of leg (long bone) growth.

==Causes==

CDGP is thought to be inherited from '''multiple genes''' from both parents. The strong role of heredity is reflected in the 60-90% likelihood of this growth pattern in a family member of the same or opposite sex. A delay in the reactivation of the hypothalamic-pituitary pulse generator results in a later onset of puberty.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="19391">{{about|a measure of medication or chemical exposure||Dose (disambiguation)}}

A '''dose''' is a measured quantity of a medicine, nutrient, or pathogen which is delivered as a unit. The greater the quantity delivered, the larger the dose. Doses are most commonly measured for compounds in medicine. The term is usually applied to the quantity of a [[drug]] or other agent administered for [[therapeutic]] purposes, but may be used to describe any case where a substance is introduced to the body. In [[nutrition]], the term is usually applied to how much of a specific [[nutrient]] is in a person's diet or in a particular food, meal, or [[dietary supplement]]. For [[bacteria]]l or [[Virus|viral]] agents, dose typically refers to the amount of the pathogen required to infect a host. For information on dosage of toxic substances, see [[Toxicology]]. For information on excessive intake of pharmaceutical agents, see [[Drug overdose]].

== Factors affecting dose ==
A ‘dose’ of any chemical or biological agent ([[active ingredient]]) has several factors which are critical to its effectiveness. The first is [[concentration]], that is, how much of the agent is being administered to the body at once.

Another factor is the duration of exposure. Some drugs or supplements have a [[Modified-release dosage (medicine)|slow-release feature]] in which portions of the medication are metabolized at different times, which changes the impacts the active ingredients have on the body. Some substances are meant to be taken in small doses over large periods of time to maintain a constant level in the body, while others are meant to have a large impact once and be expelled from the body after its work is done. It’s entirely dependent on the function of the drug or supplement.

The [[route of administration]] is important as well. Whether a drug is [[Ingestion|ingested]] orally, [[injection (medicine)|injected]] into a muscle or vein, [[Absorption (pharmacokinetics)|absorbed]] through a [[Mucous membrane|mucus membrane]], or any of the other types of administration routes, affects how quickly the substance will be metabolized by the body and thus effects the concentration of the active ingredient(s). [[Dose–response relationship|Dose-response curves]] may illustrate the relationship of these metabolic effects.

== Medicines  ==

=== Over-the-counter medications ===
In over-the-counter medicines, dosage is based on age. Typically, different doses are recommended for children 6 years and under, children aged 6 to 12 years, and persons 12 years and older, but outside of those ranges the guidance is slim.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DevelopmentApprovalProcess/HowDrugsareDevelopedandApproved/ucm209647.htm|title=How Drugs are Developed and Approved - OTC (Nonprescription) Drugs|last=Research|first=Center for Drug Evaluation and|website=www.fda.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can lead to serial under or overdosing, as smaller people take more than they should and larger people take less. Over-the-counter medications are typically accompanied by a set of instructions directing the patient to take a certain small dose, followed by another small dose if their symptoms don’t subside. Under-dosing is a common problem in pharmacy, as predicting an average dose that is effective for all individuals is extremely challenging because body weight and size impacts how the dose acts within the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Knopf|first=Hildtraud|last2=Wolf|first2=Ingrid-Katharina|last3=Sarganas|first3=Giselle|last4=Zhuang|first4=Wanli|last5=Rascher|first5=Wolfgang|last6=Neubert|first6=Antje|date=2013-01-01|title=Off-label medicine use in children and adolescents: results of a population-based study in Germany|journal=BMC Public Health|volume=13|pages=631|doi=10.1186/1471-2458-13-631|issn=1471-2458|pmc=3706213|pmid=23822744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prescription drugs ===
Prescription drug dosage is based typically on body weight.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lahc.edu/classes/nursing/nurs302/chapter14.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Drugs come with a recommended dose in milligrams or micrograms per kilogram of body weight, and that is used in conjunction with the patient's body weight to determine a safe dosage. In single dosage scenarios, the patient's body weight and the drug's recommended dose per kilogram are used to determine a safe one-time dose. In drugs where multiple doses of treatment are needed in a day, the physician must take into account information regarding the total amount of the drug which is safe to use in one day, and how that should be broken up into intervals for the most effective treatment for the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pan|first=Sheng-dong|last2=Zhu|first2=Ling-ling|last3=Chen|first3=Meng|last4=Xia|first4=Ping|last5=Zhou|first5=Quan|date=2016-04-12|title=Weight-based dosing in medication use: what should we know?|journal=Patient Preference and Adherence|volume=10|pages=549–560|doi=10.2147/PPA.S103156|issn=1177-889X|pmc=4835122|pmid=27110105}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medication underdosing occurs commonly when physicians write prescriptions for a dosage that is correct for a certain time, but fails to increase the dosage as the patient needs (i.e. weight based dosing in children, or increasing dosages of chemotherapy drugs if a patient’s condition worsens).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/288319635|title=Research paper insights: Medication underdosing and underprescribing: Issues that may contribute to polypharmacy, poor outcomes|website=ResearchGate|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Medical cannabis ===
[[Medical cannabis]] is used to treat the symptoms of a wide variety of diseases and conditions. The dose of cannabis depends on the individual, the condition being treated, and the ratio of [[cannabidiol]] (CBD) to [[tetrahydrocannabinol]] (THC) in the cannabis. CBD is a chemical component of cannabis that is not intoxicating and used to treat conditions like [[epilepsy]] and other neuropsychiatric disorders. THC is a chemical component of cannabis that is [[Psychoactive drug|psychoactive]]. It has been used to treat nausea and discomfort in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy treatment. For anxiety, depression, and other mental health ailments, a CBD to THC ratio of 10 to 1 is recommended.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;https://www.projectcbd.org/sites/projectcbd/files/downloads/pcbd_dosingguide_2-12-2015_2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; For cancer and neurological conditions, a CBD to THC ratio of 1 to 1 is recommended.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The correct dosage for a patient is dependent on their individual reaction to both chemicals, and therefore the dosing must be continually adjusted once treatment is initiated to find the right balance.

There is limited consensus throughout the scientific community regarding the effectiveness of medicinal cannabis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.prevention.com/health/14-uses-medical-marijuana|title=How Effective Is Medical Marijuana?

=== Cancer ===
Calculating drug dosages for treatment for more serious diseases like cancer is commonly done through measuring the Body Surface Area of the patient. There are approximately 25 different formulae for measuring a patient’s body surface area, none of them exact.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; See also [[Body surface area]]. Because of the variety of methods to select when determining a patient’s body surface area, studies show that choosing the best method for an individual patient is a difficult task, and often a patient receives too much or too little medication based on physical anomalies that don’t necessarily fit perfectly with the portfolio of the body surface area.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Redlarski|first=Grzegorz|last2=Palkowski|first2=Aleksander|last3=Krawczuk|first3=Marek|date=2016-06-21|title=Body surface area formulae: an alarming ambiguity|journal=Scientific Reports|volume=6|pages=27966|doi=10.1038/srep27966|issn=2045-2322|pmc=4914842|pmid=27323883|bibcode=2016NatSR...627966R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because these methods are inexact, they are typically adjusted by what’s known as ‘toxicity-adjusting dosing’ where physicians monitor the immune suppression and adjust dosing according to the results to minimize either under and overdosing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gurney|first=H|date=2002-04-22|title=How to calculate the dose of chemotherapy|journal=British Journal of Cancer|volume=86|issue=8|pages=1297–1302|doi=10.1038/sj.bjc.6600139|issn=0007-0920|pmc=2375356|pmid=11953888}}&lt;/ref&gt; This trial-and-error method has been shown to be risky to the patient and costly to healthcare companies, as well as inefficient, because of the constant monitoring that is required. Research is occurring constantly to develop new dosing methods that are more accurate and safe for the consumer.

=== Ongoing research ===
Another approach that’s been investigated recently is dosing on a molecular level, either through conventional delivery systems, nanoparticle delivery, light-triggered delivery, or other less known/used methods. By combining these drugs with a system that detects the concentration of drug particles in the blood, proper dosing could be achieved for each individual patient. Research in this field was initiated with monitoring of small-molecule cocaine levels in undiluted blood serum with electrochemical aptamer-based sensing. DNA aptamers, which are peptides that have with specific target molecules that they search for, fold in response to the molecule when they find it, and this technology was used in a microfluidic detection system to create an electrochemical signal that physicians can read. Researchers tested it on cocaine detection and found that it successfully found trace amounts of cocaine in blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Swensen|first=James S.|last2=Xiao|first2=Yi|last3=Ferguson|first3=Brian S.|last4=Lubin|first4=Arica A.|last5=Lai|first5=Rebecca Y.|last6=Heeger|first6=Alan J.|last7=Plaxco|first7=Kevin W.|last8=Soh|first8=H.

This research was expanded upon and led to the creation of a product called MEDIC (microfluidic electrochemical detector for in vivo continuous monitoring) developed by faculty at the University of California at Santa Barbara. MEDIC is an instrument that can continuously determine the concentrations of different molecules in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferguson|first=Brian Scott|last2=Hoggarth|first2=David A.|last3=Maliniak|first3=Dan|last4=Ploense|first4=Kyle|last5=White|first5=Ryan J.|last6=Woodward|first6=Nick|last7=Hsieh|first7=Kuangwen|last8=Bonham|first8=Andrew J.|last9=Eisenstein|first9=Michael|date=2013-11-27|title=Real-Time, Aptamer-Based Tracking of Circulating Therapeutic Agents in Living Animals|url=http://stm.sciencemag.org/content/5/213/213ra165|journal=Science Translational Medicine|language=en|volume=5|issue=213|pages=213ra165|doi=10.1126/scitranslmed.3007095|issn=1946-6234|pmc=4010950|pmid=24285484}}&lt;/ref&gt; The blood doesn’t have to be mixed with anything prior to testing to create a ‘serum’ as the first device did. MEDIC can detect a wide variety of drug molecules and biomarkers. In trials, early models of the device failed after about half an hour because the proteins in whole blood clung to the sensors and clogged the components. This problem was solved via a second chamber that allowed a liquid buffer to flow over the sensors with the blood, without mixing or disturbing the blood, so the results remained unchanged. The device is still in clinical trials and actual implementation in medicine is likely years away, however in the interim, its creators estimate that it could also be used in the pharmaceutical industry to allow for better testing in Phase 3 clinical trials.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.futurity.org/device-sorts-blood-watch-drugs-real-time/|title=Device tests blood to watch drugs in real-time - Futurity|date=2014-01-22|work=Futurity|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Vaccines ==
Vaccinations (see [[Vaccine]]) are typically dosed in milliliters because most are administered as liquids. Each individual vaccine comes with constraints regarding at what age they should be administered, how many doses must be given, and over what period of time. There are 15 vaccines that the Center for Disease Control and Prevention recommends every person (in America) receive between birth and 18 years of age to protect themselves against various infectious agents that can cause lifelong problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/vaccines/schedules/hcp/imz/child-adolescent-shell.html|title=Birth-18 Years Immunization Schedule - Shell {{!}} CDC|website=www.cdc.gov|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most vaccines require multiple doses for full immunity, given in recommended intervals depending on the vaccine. There are several typical vaccination routes:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.immunize.org/catg.d/p3085.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
* Intramuscular injection: the needle is inserted perpendicular to the skin into the muscle, beneath the skin and (subcutaneous) tissues that rest on top. 
* Subcutaneous injection: the needle is inserted at a 45 degree angle into the (subcutaneous) tissue between the outer layer of the skin and the muscle. 
* Nasal: the vaccine is sprayed into the nose and absorbed through the nasal passage.
* Oral: the vaccine is swallowed and ingested.

== Nutrition ==
For healthy humans, experts recommend daily intake quantities of certain vitamins and minerals. The Food and Nutrition Board, Institute of Medicine, and National Academy of Sciences sets a recommended Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) in several forms:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/Health_Information/Dietary_Reference_Intakes.aspx|title=Office of Dietary Supplements - Nutrient Recommendations : Dietary Reference Intakes (DRI)|website=ods.od.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA): average daily intake which adequately meets the nutrient requirements of 97-98% of healthy individuals. 
# Adequate Intake (AI): established when the evidence gathered for an RDA is inconclusive, An AI is assumed to recommend a daily amount to meet nutritional adequacy. 
# Tolerable Upper Intake Level (UL): maximum amount of a nutrient which can be consumed without causing adverse impacts to an individual’s health. 
DRIs are established for elements, vitamins, and macronutrients. Common elemental&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t3/|title=- Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D - NCBI Bookshelf|last=Calcium|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D. and|last2=Ross|first2=A.

Common macronutrient&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK56068/table/summarytables.t4/|title=- Dietary Reference Intakes for Calcium and Vitamin D - NCBI Bookshelf|last=Calcium|first=Institute of Medicine (US) Committee to Review Dietary Reference Intakes for Vitamin D. and|last2=Ross|first2=A.

Dosages for all three are established by both gender and age.

Individuals take vitamin and mineral supplements to promote healthier lifestyles and prevent development of chronic diseases. There is no conclusive evidence linking continued vitamin and mineral supplement intake with longevity of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ods.od.nih.gov/factsheets/MVMS-Consumer/|title=Office of Dietary Supplements - Multivitamin/mineral Supplements|website=ods.od.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infectious dose==
The infectious dose of a [[pathogen]] is the number of cells required to infect the host. All pathogens have an infectious dose typically given in number of cells. The infectious dose varies by organism and can be dependent on the specific type of strain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Schmid-Hempel|first=Paul|last2=Frank|first2=Steven A|date=2017-04-07|title=Pathogenesis, Virulence, and Infective Dose|journal=PLoS Pathogens|volume=3|issue=10|pages=1372–3|doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0030147|issn=1553-7366|pmc=2042013|pmid=17967057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pathogens can infect a host with only a few cells, while others require millions or billions.

Examples of infectious doses, ranked loosely in increasing order:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;https://www.fsis.usda.gov/shared/PDF/Atlanta2010/Slides_FSEC_JGreig_Doses.pdf?redirecthttp=true&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Enterohemorrhagic E. coli]] (causes hemorrhaging of the intestines): 10 bacteria cells
* [[Hepatitis A]]: 10-100 virus particles
* [[Norovirus]] (commonly called ‘a stomach bug’): 10-100 virus particles 
* [[Rotavirus]] (severe diarrhea, can be fatal): 10-100 virus particles
* [[Shigella]] (shigellosis): 500 bacteria cells
* [[Streptococcus pyogenes]] (Group A strep throat): 1000 bacteria cells
* [[Salmonella]]: varies by strain, 100-1 billion bacteria cells 
* [[Vibrio cholerae]] (Cholera): 1000-100,000,000 bacteria cells
Typically, stomach acids can kill bacteria below the infectious dosing rage for a given pathogen and keep the host from feeling symptoms or falling ill. Complexes constructed by fat can protect infectious agents from stomach acid, making fatty foods more likely to contain pathogens that successfully infect the host. For individuals with low or reduced stomach acid concentrations, in infectious dosage for a pathogen will be lower than normal.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Rather than being administered by a physician or individual, infectious dosages are transmitted to a person from other persons or the environment, are generally accidental, and result in adverse side effects until the pathogen is defeated by the individual's immune system or flushed out of the individual's system by excretory processes.

== Discoveries ==

=== ''H. L. Hunley'' ===
[[File:CSSHLHunleyrecovery.jpg|thumb|''H. L. Hunley'', suspended from a crane during its recovery from Charleston Harbor, August 8, 2000. (''Photograph from the [[Naval Historical Center|U.S. Naval Historical Center]].)'']]
{{Main|H. L. Hunley (submarine)|}}
Spence first reported the discovery of the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] [[submarine]] ''[[H. L. Hunley (submarine)|Hunley]]'' in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;"Diver Thinks he's Found the ''Hunley''", AP Wire story, ''The State,'' Columbia, SC, June 14, 1975&lt;/ref&gt; Spence mapped and reported its location to numerous government agencies. The July 2007 cover story in ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'' noted that the ''Hunley'' "disappeared without a trace" until 1970 when it was found by "underwater archaeologist E. Lee Spence."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.usnews.com/usnews/news/articles/070624/2hunley_2.htm Cover story: "Time Capsule From The Sea", ''[[U.S. News &amp; World Report]]'', July 2–9, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; That report made no mention of novelist Clive Cussler, whose organization later (August 2008) dropped a lawsuit in federal district court against Spence in which it had claimed that they and not Spence had discovered the wreck in 1995. Both sides still claim that they and not the other discovered the wreck.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080824072657/http://www.charleston.net/news/2008/aug/23/cussler_ends_lawsuit_over_finding_hunley51831/#comments "Cussler ends lawsuit over finding Hunley", The Post &amp; Courier, August 23, 2008, article and 27 Comments]&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 13, 1976, the National Park Service submitted Sea Research Society's (Spence's) location for ''H.L. Hunley'' for inclusion on the [[National Register of Historic Places]]. Spence's location for ''Hunley'' became a matter of public record when ''H.L. Hunley's'' placement on that list was officially approved on December 29, 1978.&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|version=2010a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.navy.mil/branches/org12-9a.htm Programmatic agreement on management of the wreck of ''H.L. Hunley'']&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence's book ''Treasures of the Confederate Coast'', which had a chapter on his discovery of ''Hunley'' and included a map complete with an ''"X"'' showing the wreck's location was published in January 1995.&lt;ref&gt;''Treasures of the Confederate Coast: The "Real Rhett Butler" &amp; Other Revelations'' by Dr. E. Lee Spence, Narwhal Press, Charleston/Miami, 1995, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995 the discovery was independently verified by a combined [[South Carolina Institute of Anthropology and Archaeology]] ([[SCIAA]]) and [[National Underwater and Marine Agency]] (NUMA) expedition directed by SCIAA underwater archaeologist Mark M. Newell&lt;ref&gt;NUMA Press Release, May 11, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; and funded in part by novelist [[Clive Cussler]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://shipwrecks.com/Hunley%20introduction%20Lee%20Spence's%20discovery%20sworn%20affidavit.htm Sworn Affidavit on discovery of the ''Hunley'' by E. Lee Spence, submitted to ''Hunley'' Commission on February 1, 1997]&lt;/ref&gt; Later the same year, at the official request of Senator Glenn F. McConnell ([[chairman]]), of the State of South Carolina ''Hunley'' Commission, Spence donated all of his rights to the [[shipwreck]] to the State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shipwrecks.com/Condon092095.htm Attorney General Charles M. Condon's letter of September 20, 1995, to Spence]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Hunley: Submarines, Sacrifice &amp; Success in the Civil War'' by Mark Ragan (Narwhal Press, Charleston/Miami, 1995) p. 213&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Hunley'' discovery was described by William Dudley, Director of Naval History at the [[Naval Historical Center]] as probably the most important (underwater archaeological) find of the (20th) century."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thehunley.com/factsheet.htm ''H.L. Hunley'' Fact Sheet]&lt;/ref&gt; The tiny [[submarine]] and its contents have been valued at over $40,000,000 making the [[Discovery (observation)|discovery]] and [[donation]] one of the most significant and valuable contributions ever made to the State of South Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://hunleyarchives.org/Beasley112095.jpg |title=Governor David Beasley's letter of November 20, 1995, to Spence |accessdate=2017-04-24 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020924202450/http://hunleyarchives.org/Beasley112095.jpg |archivedate=September 24, 2002 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hunleyarchives.org/McConnell092195.jpg |title=State Senator Glenn F.

In 2016 the [[Naval History and Heritage Command]] published a detailed report on the history, discovery, and restoration of the ''Hunley'' entitled ''H. L. Hunley: Recovery Operations'' suggesting that it is most likely Spence found a nearby buried navigation buoy rather than the ''Hunley''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.history.navy.mil/content/dam/nhhc/research/underwater-archaeology/PDF/HLHunley_RecoveryOperations_20161123_FINAL_20170216.pdf H.

=== Other discoveries ===
[[File:Spence with KM17 Dive Helmet.jpg|right|thumb|Spence with KM17 Diving Helmet]]
In addition to the ''[[H.L. Hunley|Hunley]]'', Spence has discovered several historically significant shipwrecks, including the {{SS|Georgiana}}&lt;ref&gt;"''Georgiana'' Wreck Confirmed", ''[[The Post and Courier|The News &amp; Courier]],'' Charleston, SC, p. 1-D&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Of Civil War Shipwrecks'' by W. Craig Gaines, Louisiana State University Press, 2008, pp. 146, 147&lt;/ref&gt; (said to have been the most powerful [[cruiser]] built by the [[Confederate States of America]]).&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' March 30, 1863,p.4, c.1-2&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''History of the Confederate States Navy From its Organization to the Surrender of its Last Vessel'', by J. Thomas Scharf, (New York, New York, 1887), p.802&lt;/ref&gt;

South Carolina's law protecting both the state's and the salvors' interests in shipwrecks was passed following Spence's discovery of the ''Georgiana'' and his company Shipwrecks Inc. was granted South Carolina State Salvage License #1.&lt;ref&gt;"Hulks of Confederate Blockade Runners Yield Cargo", ''[[The New York Times]]'', December 12, 1971, p. 83:3&lt;/ref&gt;

Spence states he has salvaged over $50,000,000 in valuable artifacts&lt;ref&gt;''Treasures of The Confederate Coast: the "Real Rhett Butler" &amp; Other Revelations'', by Dr. E. Lee Spence, (Narwhal Press, Charleston/Miami, 1995), "About the Author" by Charles King, p. 517&lt;/ref&gt; and has been responsible, through his archival research, for the location of the wrecks of the side-paddle-wheel steamers ''[[SS Republic (1853)|Republic]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coxwashington.com/reporters/content/reporters/stories/2007/06/06/BC_ODYSSEY_ADV03_COX.html "Ocean Treasure Company Has a Murky History" by Jeff Nesmith, Cox News Service, June 3, 2007] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081120091525/http://www.coxwashington.com/reporters/content/reporters/stories/2007/06/06/BC_ODYSSEY_ADV03_COX.html |date=November 20, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[SS Central America|Central America]]''&lt;ref&gt;Cover story: "Treasure" ''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine, March 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cover story: "Milliard-Skatten", ''[[Vi Menn]]'' magazine (Norway) November 1989, pp. 4-7&lt;/ref&gt; from which over one billion dollars in treasure has been recovered.&lt;ref&gt;£600M Gold in Them Thar Holds" ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'', London, September 16, 1989, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://edict.homelinux.net/1884/427127.html ''Famous Treasure Hunters'']&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 1989, Spence announced his discovery that [[Margaret Mitchell]], who had claimed her [[Pulitzer Prize]] winning novel ''[[Gone with the Wind (novel)|Gone with the Wind]]'' was pure fiction, had actually taken much of her compelling story of love, greed and war from real life&lt;ref&gt;"Newsmakers: Frankly, My Dear, Historian is on Pins and Needles," ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', April 4, 1989, p. 2-A&lt;/ref&gt; and that Mitchell had actually based [[Rhett Butler]] on the life of [[George Alfred Trenholm]], a tall, handsome, shipping [[magnate]] from Charleston, South Carolina, who had made millions of dollars from [[blockade running]] and was accused of making off with much of the Confederate treasury and had been thrown in prison after the Civil War.&lt;ref&gt;''Oggi'' ([http://www.mondotimes.com/2/topics/3/news/1/17417 Italian weekly magazine]), 5 dicembre 1994, pp. 38-40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Rhett Butler Connection," ''Treasure Diver,'' Volume 1, Number One, pp. 35-40&lt;/ref&gt; Spence's literary discovery that had its roots in his prior discoveries of some of Trenholm's wrecked blockade runners made international news.&lt;ref&gt;"Rhett Butler," ''[[La Stampa]]'', Turin, Italy, 18/4/1989, p.5&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Encyclopedia Of Civil War Shipwrecks'' by W. Craig Gaines additionally credits Spence with the discoveries of the following Civil War wrecks: the ''Constance'' (lost 1864, found 1967); {{USS|Housatonic|1861|2}} (lost 1864, found 1970); ''Keokuk'' (lost 1863, found 1971); ''Minho'' (lost 1862, found 1965); ''Presto'' (lost 1864, found 1967); ''Ruby'' (lost 1863, found 1966); ''Stonewall Jackson'' (lost 1863, found 1965).&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopedia Of Civil War Shipwrecks'' by W. Craig Gaines, Louisiana State University Press, 2008, pp. 144, 148-151, 152, 155&lt;/ref&gt; Spence's own books, as well as numerous third party books, newspaper and magazine accounts, and archaeological reports describe his discoveries of the blockade runners ''Mary Bowers'' and ''Norseman'' and dozens of other ships of all types and nations in waters all over the world spanning a time period of over two thousand years.&lt;ref name="Eugene Warner 1970, pp. 40-43"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Katherine Hatch 1972 pp. 44, 45"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shipwrecks of South Carolina and Georgia : (includes Spence's List, 1520-1865) by E.

In June 2013 Spence announced his discovery of the wreck of the [[SS Ozama (1881)|SS ''Ozama'']], a steamer with a history of smuggling, which had been wrecked off the South Carolina coast in 1894.&lt;ref&gt;http://news.discovery.com/history/archaeology/smugglers-shipwrecked-steamer-found-130602.htm ''Smuggler's Shipwrecked Steamer Found'' by Rossella Lorenzi, Discovery News&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[pharmacology]], an '''endogenous agonist''' for a particular [[Receptor (biochemistry)|receptor]] is a compound naturally produced by the body which binds to and [[agonist|activates]] that receptor. For example, the primary endogenous agonist for [[5-HT receptor|serotonin receptors]] is [[serotonin]], and the primary endogenous agonist for [[dopamine receptor]]s is [[dopamine]].&lt;ref&gt;Goodman and Gilman's Manual of Pharmacology and Therapeutics. (11th edition, 2008). p14. {{ISBN|0-07-144343-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In general, receptors for [[small molecule]] [[neurotransmitter]]s such as serotonin will have only one endogenous agonist, but often have many different receptor subtypes (e.g. 13 different [[serotonin receptor|receptors for serotonin]]). On the other hand, [[neuropeptide]] receptors tend to have fewer subtypes, but may have several different endogenous agonists. This allows for a high degree of complexity in the bodies signalling system, with different tissues often showing quite distinct responses to a particular [[ligand]]. Some endogenous [[Antagonist (pharmacology)|antagonists]] and [[inverse agonist]]s are also known (e.g., [[kynurenic acid]] at the [[NMDA receptor]]), but these are much less common.

{{Feminism sidebar}}
The '''feminist art movement''' refers to the efforts and accomplishments of [[feminism|feminists]] internationally to produce [[feminist art|art that reflects women's lives and experiences]], as well as to change the foundation for the production and reception of contemporary art. It also sought to bring more visibility to women within [[art history]] and art practice. Corresponding with general developments within [[feminism]], and often including such self-organizing tactics as the consciousness-raising group, the movement began in the 1960s and flourished throughout the 1970s as an outgrowth of the so-called [[Second-wave feminism|second wave of feminism]]. It has been called "the most influential international movement of any during the postwar period."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/04/20/AR2007042000400.html Jeremy Strick], director of the Museum of Contemporary Art in Los Angeles in the ''Washington Post'', 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The 1960s was period of civil rights and [[LGBT rights by country or territory|gay and lesbian rights]] movements and protests against war. It was also a period when women artists wanted to gain equal rights as men within the established art world, influenced by modernist movements "utopian ideals," and to create [[feminist art]], often in non-traditional ways, to help "change the world."&lt;ref name="Art Story"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.theartstory.org/movement-feminist-art.htm# | title=Feminist art movement | publisher=The Art Story Foundation | accessdate=13 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louise Bourgeois]] (1911-2010) and German-American [[Eva Hesse]] (1936-1970) explore some of the themes in [[feminist art]], like domestic life, personal experience and the women's body.&lt;ref name="Art Story" /&gt;

On 20 July 1964 [[Yoko Ono]], an avant-garde artist, singer, and activist, presented ''Cut Piece'' at the Yamaichi Concert Hall, Kyoto, Japan where she sat still as parts of her clothing were cut off of her, which meant to protest violence against women. She performed it again at [[Carnegie Hall]] in 1965.&lt;ref name="CBS Yoko Ono"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/crowd-cuts-yoko-onos-clothing-off/ | title=Crowd Cuts Yoko Ono's Clothing Off | work=CBS News | date=16 October 2003 | accessdate=12 January 2014 | author=Jarett Murphy}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her son, Sean, participated in the artist performance on 15 September 2013 at the Théâtre le Ranelagh in Paris.  ''[[The Guardian]]'''s Jonathan Jones considered it "one of the 10 most shocking performance artworks ever."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2013/nov/11/scrotum-top-10-shocking-performance-art | title=The 10 most shocking performance artworks ever | publisher=The Guardian | date=11 November 2013 | accessdate=12 January 2014 | author=Jonathan Jones}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women artists, motivated by [[feminist theory]] and the [[feminist movement]], began the feminist art movement in the 1970s. Feminist art represented a shift away from [[modernism]], where art made by women was put in a different class to works made by men. The movement cultivated a new feminist consciousness, a "freedom to respond to life... [Unimpeded] by traditional male mainstream."&lt;ref&gt;Deoritha Anne Waters, Three Feminist Perspectives on Visual Media: Influences of the Second Wave Feminist Movement on Women’s Art Education and Their Lives as Artists, ed. Deoritha Anne Waters (Michigan: ProQuest Dissertations Publishing, 2014), 1.&lt;/ref&gt; Or, as Griselda Pollock and Roszika Parker put it—a separation of Art with a capital "A" from art made by women produced a "feminine stereotype".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Roszika Parker|author2=Griselda Pollock| title=Old Mistresses: Women, Art and Ideology |publisher=Pandora, RKP|year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This demand for equality in representation was codified in the [[Art Workers' Coalition]]'s (AWC) Statement of Demands, which was developed in 1969 and published in definitive form in March 1970. The AWC was set up to defend the rights of artists and force museums and galleries to reform their practices. While the coalition sprung up as a protest movement following Greek kinetic sculptor [[Takis|Panagiotis "Takis" Vassilakis]]'s physical removal of his work Tele-Sculpture(1960) from a 1969 exhibition at the [[Museum of Modern Art]], New York, it quickly issued a broad list of demands to 'art museums in general'.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

Alongside calls for free admission, better representation of ethnic minorities, late openings and an agreement that galleries would not exhibit an artwork without the artist's consent, the AWC also demanded that museums 'encourage female artists to overcome centuries of damage done to the image of the female as an artist by establishing equal representation of the sexes in exhibitions, museum purchases and on selection committees'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Harrison|first1=Charles|title=Art in theory|date=2000|publisher=Blackwell|location=Oxford [u.a.]|isbn=0-631-16575-4|pages=901–2|edition=Repr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are also feminist forms of [[postmodernism]] which emerged in the 1980s. The feminist art movement grew out of the struggle to find a new way to express sexual, material, social and political aspects of life, and femininity.&lt;ref name="Kramarae pp. 92-93"&gt;Entry on feminist art practice by Katy Deepwell in {{cite book|editor1=Cheris Kramarae|editor2=Dale Spender|title=Routledge International Encyclopedia of Women: Global Women's Issues and Knowledge|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TfrzBcycB-4C&amp;pg=PA92|date=1 December 2000|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-92088-9|pages=92–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist art movements emerged in [[Feminist art movement in the United States|the United States]];  Europe,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gislind Nabakowski|author2=Peter Gorsen|author3=Sander Helke| title=Frauen in der Kunst(2 Vols.)|publisher=Frankfurt,Suhrkamp|year=1980}}&lt;/ref&gt; including Spain;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mav.org.es/cronologiaMAV/cronologia.html  Mujeres en les Artes Visuales, Women in the Visual Arts, Spanish chronology]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian feminist art timeline|Australia]]; Canada;&lt;ref&gt;Marie  Rose Arbour  ''Art et Feminisme'' Exhibition catalogue.

Japan, Fukuoka Asian Art Museum, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; Women artists from Asia, Africa and particularly Eastern Europe emerged in large numbers onto the international art scene in the late 1980s and 1990s as [[contemporary art]] became popular worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.erstestiftung.org/gender-check/ Gender Check: Masculinity and Femininity in the Art in Eastern Europe],&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Huangfu, Binghui.(ed).''Text and Sub-Text''(Singapore: Lasalle-SIA University, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dike, Paul Chike and Oyelola, Patricia.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1553">A '''flow show''' is a device on a [[drilling rig (petroleum)|drilling rig]] that is attached to the [[flow line]] and has a paddle that swings out as the flow of [[drilling fluid]] passes by it. The angle of the paddle increases as the volume of drilling fluid increases and pushes it out further and vice versa.

The purpose of the flow show is to allow the driller (and other rig personnel) to monitor the flow of drilling fluid as it comes out of the hole. The reason for monitoring the flow:

*If a high pressure zone is drilled and overcomes the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the column of drilling fluid, the fluid or gas in the high-pressure zone will begin to enter the [[borehole]] and increase the amount of fluid coming out of the hole. By monitoring the flow, rig personnel will know in advance before the flow becomes critical.
*If a low pressure zone is drilled and is overcome by the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the column of drilling fluid, the low pressure zone may begin to ''take'' fluid and decrease the amount of fluid coming out of the hole. By monitoring the flow, rig personnel will know in advance before losing too much drilling fluid (which is typically very expensive) down the hole and/or losing so much fluid that the [[hydrostatic pressure]] of the (decreasing) column of mud becomes so low that a blowout situation becomes imminent.

See [[Drilling rig (petroleum)]] for a diagram of a drilling rig.

Group-IB's head office is located in [[Moscow, Russia]].

== History ==
[[File:Ilya Sachkov.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Ilya Sachkov]], the founder]]
Group-IB was founded in 2003 by a group of students of [[Bauman Moscow State Technical University]], headed by [[Ilya Konstantinovich Sachkov]]. They were acting as an agency for investigating cyber-attacks. Since then, Group-IB has been involved in a range of incident response and investigations across the world,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-taiwan-cyber-atms-idUSKBN14P0CX |title=Taiwan ATM heist linked to European hacking spree: security firm |author=Jim Finkle and J.R. Wu |date=January 5, 2017 |website= |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; actively cooperating with international partners to detect perpetrators and bring them to justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/940-group-ib-supports-interpol-in-disrupting-dorkbot-botnet |title=Group-IB supports INTERPOL in disrupting Dorkbot botnet |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=December 17, 2015 |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group-IB participated in the first successful [[cybercrime]] case in Russia where the organizers of the criminal groups were identified and arrested. These criminals were involved in financial theft from bank accounts using [[malware]] for PCs, mobile devices, [[phishing]] attacks, and targeted attacks on financial institutions in Russia. The company is generally involved in a series of international operations and leverages close cooperation with international law enforcement agencies to get the criminals wherever they hide. According to Group-IB, up to 80% of all high-profile investigation cases in the field of high-tech crime in Russia are supported by Group-IB experts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/about.html |title=About Group-IB |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote="80% of high-profile cybercrimes in Russia and CIS are investigated by Group-IB"}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Group-IB established the largest computer [[forensics]] laboratory in [[Eastern Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bankinfosecurity.com/russian-police-bust-alleged-bank-malware-gang-a-9163 |title=Russian Police Bust Alleged Bank Malware Gang |last=Schwartz |first=Mathew J. |date=June 2, 2016 |website=bankinfosecurity.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the company established its [[Computer Emergency Response Team]] (CERT)—the first round-the-clock computer security incident response team in Eastern Europe, called CERT-GIB.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcworld.com/article/2032336/researchers-find-new-pointofsale-malware-called-blackpos.html |title=Researchers find new point-of-sale malware called BlackPOS |last=Lucian |first=Constantin |date=March 28, 2013 |website=pcworld.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the status of a Competent Security Organization recognized by [[Coordination Center for TLD RU]] (administrator of the national top-level domains [[.ru]] and [[.рф]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://cctld.ru/en/news/news_detail.php?ID=3366&amp;sphrase_id=138576 |title=Group-IB to help combating cibercrime in domains .РФ and .RU |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2011-12-23 |website= |publisher=[[Coordination Center for TLD RU]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and collaboration with CERTs worldwide, the company has developed a series of effective [[intellectual property]] protection services.

Group-IB successfully protected the [[2014 Winter Olympics|Sochi 2014 Olympic]] brand, products and ticket sales,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.ru/testimonials/sochi.pdf |title=Sochi 2014 Commemorative certificate |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2014 |website= |publisher=[[International Olympic Committee]] |access-date= |quote= |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; blocked pirated links to TV series and movies owned by [[Sony Pictures]], [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Fox TV]] series', [[Discovery Channel]], Amedia (which has exclusive rights to HBO TV series in Russia),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/828-internet-criminalists-how-russias-main-cyber-detective-agency-is-organized |title=Internet criminalists: how Russia’s main cyber detective agency is organized |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as fraudulent websites abusing brands of popular banks and payment systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cnews.ru/news/line/qiwi_i_groupib_obedinili_usiliya_dlya |title=Qiwi и Group-IB объединили усилия для защиты электронных платежей |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2014-04-10 |website=cnews.ru |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2012, Group-IВ has been developing their Early Warning System to provide cyber defence to companies around the world. In 2015 [[Gartner]] included Group-IB's core product—Group-IB Intelligence—in the top 7 global threat intelligence solutions along with products developed by [[IBM]], [[FireEye]], [[RSA Security|RSA]] and [[Check Point]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2874317/market-guide-security-threat-intelligence |title=Market Guide for Security Threat Intelligence Services |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=14 October 2014 |website= |publisher=[[Gartner]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2007, Group-IB has been cooperating with [[Microsoft]]. In 2015, the two companies presented joint research on the economic impact of cyber-attacks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rbth.com/business/2016/04/14/russia-loses-33-billion-to-cyber-attacks_584971 |title=Russia loses $3.3 billion to cyber attacks |last=Kuchma |first=Anna |date=April 14, 2016 |website= |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Group-IB is a resident of the Moscow-based [[Skolkovo Foundation]] (dubbed "Russian [[Silicon Valley]]"). As part of Skolkovo innovative projects, Group-IB created the so-called "CyberCop", a global counter-cybercrime system.

The company has also established an additional office in [[Innopolis]]—a [[science park]] in [[Tatarstan]], Russia.

== Owners and leadership ==
In 2010, LETA Group, an investment and management company in information technology, acquired 50% of Group-IB's assets. In 2013, Group-IB management bought out LETA Group's share.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://en.leta.vc/news/menedzhment-group-ib/ |title= Group-IB management buys out LETA Group’s share|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=5 November 2013 |website= |publisher=LETA Group |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In mid-2016 Russian-founded Altera Capital and Run Capital each bought a 10 percent stake in Group-IB.

According to the company's announcement, Group-IB will leverage these investments to develop products and create [[R&amp;D]] hubs in the Middle East, Southeast Asia and Latin America, as well as to hire local forensic specialists and improve sales performance at the American, European, and Asian markets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vc.ru/n/group-invest |title=Российские специалисты по информбезопасности Group-IB продали 20% компании фондам Altera и Run Capital |last=Фролов |first=Андрей |date=2016-08-15 |website=vc.ru |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International cooperation ==
* Group-IB is an official partner of [[Europol]]. On June 17, 2015 [[European Cybercrime Centre]] signed a [[Memorandum of Understanding]] (MoU) with Group-IB in order to initiate cooperation in fighting cybercrime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.europol.europa.eu/newsroom/news/europol-signs-agreement-group-ib-to-cooperate-in-fighting-cybercrime |title=Europol signs agreement with Group-IB to cooperate in fighting cybercrime |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=17 June 2015 |website= |publisher=[[Europol]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was held in The Hague&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/932-europol-signs-agreement-with-group-ib-to-cooperate-in-fighting-cybercrime |title=Europol signs agreement with group-ib to cooperate in fighting cybercrime |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=17 June 2015 |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2013 Group-IB and its CERT-GIB entered into a strategic partnership with [[International Multilateral Partnership Against Cyber Threats]], a cybersecurity alliance supported by the [[United Nations]].
* CERT-GIB is an accredited member of Trusted Introducer—an association which includes many European computer security incident response teams&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.trusted-introducer.org/processes/overview.html |title=Trusted Introducer overview |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=trusted-introducer.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a member of FIRST (Forum of Incident Response and Security Teams), which enables CERT-GIB to exchange data with [[Computer emergency response team|CERTs]] in 78 countries and promptly block dangerous websites worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.first.org/members/teams/cert-gib |title=Computer Security Incident Response Team CERT-GIB |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website=first.org |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Group-IB is a member of [[OWASP]], the largest professional association of specialists in vulnerability assessment and web application security. The contribution by experts from Group-IB was to enhance the security of industrial systems – OWASP [[SCADA]] Security Project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/714-group-ib-to-participate-in-the-owasp-project |title=Group-IB to participate in the OWASP project |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=19 March 2013 |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The company is a member of [[OASIS (organization)|OASIS]], a global non-profit consortium that works on the development, convergence and adoption of data exchange standards. Group-IB's intelligence data is transmitted in STIX/TAXII format according to standards of cyber threat information exchange developed by OASIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wiki.oasis-open.org/cti/Products |title=OASIS Products |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=OASIS organization |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2016, Group-IB and Thailand's [[King Mongkut's Institute of Technology Ladkrabang]] signed a MoU to facilitate their cooperation in the field of cyber security and promote Group-IB's expertise in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mxphone.net/250716-kmitl-group-ib-it/ |title=สจล. ร่วมมือยักษ์ไอทีรัสเซียยกระดับไซเบอร์ซีเคียวริตี้ไทย |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-07-25 |website=mxphone.net |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==
According to Gartner, "being involved in the most high-profile investigations allows Group-IB to get more information about cybercriminals, their relationships and other intelligence".&lt;ref name="Gartner" /&gt; In addition to investigation materials and forensics expertise, GIB's threat data collection is based on the high-tech infrastructure that includes:
* compromised data tracking and data extraction from [[botnet]]s; automatic search and monitoring of "underground" forums;
* vast databases of known cyber criminals and gangs that identify intersections and analyzes [[social graphs]];
* identification of new threats using behavioral analysis and machine learning technology;
* detection of infections, attempts of remote control and other indications of fraud schemes targeting clients of [[online banking]] and Internet portals without installation on client devices;
* detection of [[phishing]] resources and rogue mobile applications and extraction of their phishing kits—modules designed to store and transmit stolen data.

=== Early Warning System for Cyber Defence ===

GIB Intelligence service uses personalized information for security strategy planning, making time-sensitive decisions and tweaking protection tools. It gives time for incidents prevention allowing to urgently discover theft of clients and employees' identifiers, to track modifications of tactics and tools used by criminal groups potentially interested in a company and to prioritize threats based on expert [[Forecasting|forecast]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ixbt.com/news/soft/index.shtml?18/34/85 |title=Российские киберпреступники получили в 2013 г. почти $2,5 млрд |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2014-10-15 |website= |publisher=[[Vedomosti]] |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TDS is a hardware and software unit preventing infection and vulnerabilities usage in corporate networks. The TDS sensors track suspicious activities in a corporate network while the CERT-GIB experts reveal critical threats and immediately inform the information security service and help to put a stop to an incident evolving. TDS Polygon allows to start in an isolated environ suspicious [[Computer file|file]]s downloaded by users or received in mail and to obtain an objective conclusion of the degree of their harmfulness based on a classification formed through computerized training pattern.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.anti-malware.ru/analytics/Market_Analysis/protection-market-against-targeted-attacks-review |title=Обзор рынка защиты от целевых атак |author=Иван Бойцов |date=2016-10-26 |website=anti-malware.ru |publisher= |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Secure Bank deletes "blind spots" in online-payments security through diagnosing signs of infection, remote controlling of client's machine or identifiers being compromised during authorization. Secure Portal prevents unauthorized access to personal accounts, [[personal data]], web users' bonus accounts and various fraudulent scenarios from using bots to competitor's offers displays on a portal site.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/secure_bank.html |title=Secure Bank: Innovative solution for secure online payments |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major threats detected by Group-IB ==

=== Lazarus: state-sponsored attack ===
In May 2017 Group-IB issued a report that proved there is a connection between Lazarus group who stole $18 mln from [[Bangladesh Bank|Bangladesh Central Bank]], conducted a number of attacks on Polish banks, as well as attempted to infect hundreds of financial organizations in 30 countries around the globe, including European Central Bank, Central Banks of Russia, Brazil and Venezuela – with North Korea. Company experts made a research of the complex technological infrastructure, communications channels, and concealment techniques, presented new evidence of Lazarus attribution to North Korea and revealed details of the attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2017/05/30/nork_spy_agency_lazarus_group_attribution/ |title=NORK spy agency blamed for Bangladesh cyberheist, Sony Pictures hack |last=Leyden |first=John |date=30 May 2017 |website= |publisher=[[The Register]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cobalt: logical attacks===
In July 2016, a group of masked cyber-criminals "jackpotted" 34 ATMs operated by First Bank, one of Taiwan's largest banks. The perpetrators stole T$83.27 (over $2m USD).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/thai-bank-shuts-down-half-its-atms-after-eastern-european-cyber-gang-heist-1577806 |title=Thai bank shuts down half its ATMs after 'Eastern European cyber-gang' heist |last=Murdock |first=Jason |date=August 24, 2016 |website= |publisher=[[International Business Times]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Surveillance footage|CCTV footage]], the thieves used cellphones to trigger the ATMs to automatically dispense money. Group-IB experts were the first to discover the "jackpotting" attack tactics used by the Cobalt gang to force ATMs to spit out cash using malware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-cyber-banks-atms-idUSKBN13G24Q?il=0 |title=Hackers target ATMs across Europe as cyber threat grows |last=Finkle |first=Jim |date=2016-11-21 |website= |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Group-IB released a report "Cobalt: Logical attacks on ATMs" that provided a detailed analysis of the attack scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.group-ib.com/cobalt.html |title=Cobalt: logical attacks on ATMs |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; To get into the bank's internal network, hackers used spear phishing emails with a malicious attachment. The emails purported to come from the European Central Bank, the ATM maker [[Wincor Nixdorf]], and local banks. After establishing control over the bank's internal network, the criminals searched for network segments, from which they could gain access to ATMs and workstations of bank employees who control ATMs. Once access to ATMs was obtained, they uploaded a specific software to them, allowing criminals to control cash dispensers.

===Corkow===
In February 2016, Group-IB published a report titled "Analysis of attacks against trading and bank card systems" about the first major successful attack on a trading system provoking major exchange volatility. In February 2015, the Corkow criminal group infected a trading system terminal of [[Kazan]]-based Energobank using a specialized [[Trojan software]] resulting in trades of more than $400 million. The hackers moved the ruble-dollar rate more than 15 percent in minutes on the [[Moscow Exchange]]. The bank claimed losses of 244 million rubles ($3.2 million) due to the trades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-02-08/russian-hackers-moved-currency-rate-with-malware-group-ib-says |title=Russian Hackers Moved Ruble Rate With Malware, Group-IB Says |last= |first= |date=2016-02-08 |website= |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buhtrap===
In March 2016 Group-IB published a report on activity of the Buhtrap criminal group that managed to conduct 13 successful attacks against Russian banks for a total amount of 1.8 billion rubles ($25.7 million) from August 2015 to February 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.vedomosti.ru/finance/articles/2016/03/18/634123-hakeri-rossiiskih-bankov |title=Хакеры украли $25 млн у 13 российских банков |last=Kantyshev |first=Pavel |date=2016-03-18 |website= |publisher=[[Vedomosti]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The high effectiveness of these attacks was achieved due to spear phishing mailouts, including those sent acting as the [[Central Bank of Russia]], which were used by criminals to gain access to the corporate network. Criminals obtained access to computers running the Automated Working Station of the Central Bank Client (AWS CBC), a free software that delivers payment documents on behalf of the Central Bank, and performed fraudulent transactions acting as the bank. The attack scheme outlined in the report published by Group-IB was later used to perform thefts via SWIFT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-17/new-russian-hacker-cell-hit-13-banks-since-august-group-ib-says |title=New Russian Hacker Cell Hit 13 Banks Since August, Group-IB Says |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016-03-17 |website= |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Buhtrap was the first hacker group using a network worm to infect the overall bank infrastructure that significantly increased the difficulty of removing all malicious functions from the network. As a result, banks had to shut down the whole infrastructure, because the worm was able to gain full control over the network using a single infected machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/buhtrap-report.html |title=Buhtrap: the evolution of targeted attacks against financial institutions |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2016 |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Anunak/Carbanak===
In late 2014 Fox-IT and Group-IB jointly released a report on the Anunak (aka Carbanak) hacker group that had stolen more than 1 billion rubles from over 50 Russian banks. In Europe Anunak attacked [[Point of sale|POS terminals]] of large retail store chains with data of several million clients infected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.forbes.ru/tekhnologii/internet-i-svyaz/276227-brat-po-krupnomu-kak-odna-gruppirovka-khakerov-ograbila-bolee-50 |title=Брать по-крупному: группировка хакеров ограбила более 50 банков |author=Pavel Sedakov, Dmitry Filonov |date=2014-12-22 |website= |publisher=[[Forbes]] |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group has not performed successful thefts since early 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/939-high-tech-crime-trends-2015 |title=High-Tech Crime Trends 2015 |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reverse ATM Attack===
In autumn 2015,  a novel technique of targeted attacks called a "reverse ATM attack" that allowed criminals to steal money from ATMs. "[[Money mule]]s" (criminal payment agents) would deposit small sums into unembossed cards with legitimate accounts, immediately withdrawing what they'd put in. They also took a receipt from the ATM, which contained a payment reference number and the amount withdrawn. That information was sent to hackers who would use the data and their access to thousands of point of sale terminals, primarily based in the USA and the Czech Republic, to create "a reversal operation" on a terminal that tricked the bank into believing the withdrawal of funds had been cancelled. At the point of sale terminal, this looked as though goods were returned or a payment was declined, whilst to the banks it appeared the ATM withdrawal had been cancelled. Funds were returned to the account, though the perpetrators had already taken the cash. The process was repeated until there was no money remaining in the target ATM. During these attacks criminals managed to steal 252 million rubles ($3.8 million) from five large Russian banks. The fraud can no longer be perpetrated due to additional security systems implemented by banks with the assistance from VISA and Mastercard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://securityaffairs.co/wordpress/42272/cyber-crime/reverse-atm-hack-method.html |title=Russian criminals Steal $4 Million In cash with a new technique dubbed reverse ATM Attack. |last=Paganini |first=Paganini |date=November 26, 2015 |website=securityaffairs.co |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===ISIS  hacker attacks on Russian resources===
According to the report released by Group-IB in March 2015, hackers from the self-proclaimed [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant]] (ISIS) attacked 600 Russian Internet resources in 2014. Criminals primarily [[Website defacement|defaced]] websites placing pictures and video with ISIS propaganda. Hackers are believed to have attacked not only government organizations, banks and popular resources, but also galleries and schools. These attacks were chaotic and massive; researchers believe that they were aimed to gain experience and perform reconnaissance of the [[Internet in Russia|Russian Internet]]. According to Group-IB's report, these attacks were performed not just by ISIS cyber division, [[Islamic State Hacking Division|Cyber Caliphate]], but by 3 more criminal groups called Team System Dz, FallaGa Team and Global Islamic Caliphate totalling over 40 members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thehill.com/policy/cybersecurity/237031-isis-hackers-have-hit-hundreds-of-russian-websites |title=ISIS hackers have hit hundreds of Russian websites |last=Bennett |first=Cory |date= |website= |publisher=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Notable public investigations ==

===Exploits: Blackhole (Paunch)===
In Autumn 2013 Group-IB supported investigative activity that resulted in the arrest of Dmitry Fedotov, known under the nickname Paunch, the author of the infamous [[Blackhole exploit kit|Blackhole exploit pack]], which was, at the time, used to conduct 40% of infections worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://krebsonsecurity.com/2013/12/who-is-paunch/ |title=Who Is Paunch? |last= |first= |date=December 2013 |website=krebsonsecurity.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The criminal was sentenced to 7 years in prison according to the national legislation in April 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.infosecurity-magazine.com/news/blackholes-paunch-sentenced-to-7/ |title=Blackhole's Paunch Sentenced to 7 Years in Russian Penal Colony |last=Seals |first=Tara |date=2016-04-19 |website=infosecurity-magazine.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attacks on legal entities: Carberp, Germes, Hodprot===
In 2012 law enforcement agencies, with assistance from Sberbank and Group-IB, arrested the largest criminal gang in Russia. In two years, the group managed to infect over 1.5 million computers worldwide and steal approximately $250 million from bank accounts. In total, over 100 banks suffered from their attacks throughout the world. Group-IB engaged their partners in the Netherlands and Canada in the investigation, which enabled the company to identify the full chain of actors including the organizer, who owned the [[botnet]], operators, and cashers ("[[money mule]]s").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.group-ib.com/index.php/7-novosti/627-members-of-the-largest-criminal-group-engaged-in-online-banking-fraud-are-detained |title=Members of the largest criminal group engaged in online banking fraud are detained |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date= |website= |publisher=Group-IB |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the first case in Russia when all members of the criminal group were arrested; the leaders were sentenced to between 5 and 8 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.securityweek.com/russian-authorities-claim-capture-mastermind-behind-carberp-banking-trojan |title=Russian Authorities Claim Capture of Mastermind Behind Carberp Banking Trojan |author=Fahmida Y. Rashid |date=April 4, 2013 |website=securityweek.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year members of other criminal groups, who used Carberp modifications to attack individuals and companies, were arrested. In the summer of 2012 a hacker known as Germes (aka Arashi) was arrested. He was a creator of one of the largest global botnets that had infected over 6 million computers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cso.com.au/article/428671/russian_carberp_botnet_kingpin_arrested_/ |title=Russian Carberp botnet kingpin arrested |author=Liam Tung |date=June 26, 2012 |website=cso.com.au |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, 7 members of the Hodprot criminal group were detained. One of the oldest Russian hacker gangs is known to have stolen approximately 125 million rubles from Russian bank accounts. All members of the criminal group were arrested, even though they are known to have used control servers located abroad – in the Netherlands, Germany, France and the USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.welivesecurity.com/2012/06/04/carberp-and-hodprot-six-more-gang-members-held/ |title=Carberp and Hodprot: six more gang members held |last=Harley |first=David |date=2012-06-04 |website=welivesecurity.com |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Android Trojans: "5th Reich", WapLook, Cron===
In April 2015 members of a hacker group, which had infected over 340,000 Android-based devices to steal money from bank accounts, were arrested with assistance of Group-IB and Sberbank. Hackers dubbed their malware "the fifth [[Reich]]" and used Nazi symbols in the control system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ren.tv/novosti/2015-04-13/kiber-fashisty-iz-chelyabinskoy-oblasti-ispolzovali-virus-5-reyh |title=Кибер-фашисты из Челябинской области использовали вирус "5 рейх" |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2015-04-13 |website= |publisher=[[REN TV]] |access-date= |quote= |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hackers distributed the malware via SMS messages containing a link to download a program masked as [[Adobe Flash Player]]. The Trojan enabled hackers to intercept SMS notifications from banks and furtively confirm money transfer to hackers' accounts. The attack scheme was similar to that used by WapLook, the first criminal group members which were arrested for money theft from individuals using malicious mobile apps in Russia. Group leaders were arrested in September 2014 with assistance from Group-IB. In May 2017 Russian Ministry of Internal Affairs announced the arrest of Cron gang that had infected more than 1 mln smartphones. Group-IB provided expert support to the investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-russia-cyber-banks-idUSKBN18I0VE |title=Hackers hit Russian bank customers, planned international cyber raids |last=Stubbs |first=Jack |date=2017-05-22 |website= |publisher=[[Reuters]] |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cron Banking Trojan spread itself in two ways—via SMS, when the user clicked on the link in the message and installed a malicious application, or disguised as a legitimate application Navitel, Framaroot, Pornhub, Avito etc. The hackers infected up to 3,500 smartphones daily, and managed to steal about $1 mln in total.

===Phishing: Popelysh brothers===
In June 2015, twin brother hackers were reportedly arrested in [[St. Petersburg, Russia]], as part of a police operation assisted by Group-IB. Over 4 years, the Popelysh brothers had stolen money from client accounts of [[VTB Bank|VTB24]] online banking using a fake bank page to grab client data. This was the first case in Russia, when legal proceedings were taken against criminals using phishing schemes.

'''Haleets''' (also called '''Figurehead Rock''') is a sandstone [[glacial erratic]] boulder{{sfn|Casey|2012|p=126}}{{sfn|Lewarch|2012|p=3}} with inscribed [[petroglyph]]s on [[Bainbridge Island, Washington]]. The Native American [[Suquamish Tribe]] claims the rock, on a public beach at [[Agate Point, Bainbridge Island, Washington|Agate Point]] on the shore of [[Agate Passage]], as part of their heritage.{{sfn|Lewarch|2012|p=3}} The exact date the petroglyphs were carved is unknown but is estimated to be around 1000 BCE to 400 or 500 CE, the latest date being when [[labret]]s (worn by one of the petroglyph figures) were no longer used by Coast Salish peoples.{{sfn|Bainbridge Island Historical Museum|2012}}{{sfn|Leen|2015}}

Haleets is the [[Coast Salish]] name of the rock, also transcrbed as Halelos, Xalelos and Xalilc, meaning "marked face".{{sfn|Alcalá|2013}} It is known in English as Figurehead Rock. Its purpose is unknown but the [[Suquamish Museum]] curator and archivist Charlie Sigo has stated that it may have been a boundary marker.{{sfn|Westbrook|1999}} An [[amateur astronomer]] has proposed a theory that it has a calendrical function (see [[Archaeoastronomy]]).{{sfn|Lewarch|2012|p=3}}{{sfn|Westbrook|1999}}{{sfn|Bainbridge Island Review|2008}}{{refn|group=notes|Bainbridge Island Historical Museum 2012: "The petroglyph lies precisely west of the [[Sky Valley Washington|Skykomish canyon]] 60 miles away. Standing at the petroglyph on the vernal and autumnal equinox, one can view the rising sun shining straight through the canyon."{{sfn|Bainbridge Island Historical Museum|2012}}}}

The rock is {{convert|5|ft}} tall and {{convert|7|ft}} long. It sits about {{convert|100|ft}} offshore,{{sfn|Westbrook|1999}} and has been marked with chiseled and drilled coast survey features since 1856, and a bronze [[geodetic mark]] was placed on it in 1934.{{sfn|NOAA|2015}} Some sources say that the rock is one of three prominent Salish Sea petroglyphs that were always on the shoreline,{{sfn|Beauchamp|2013}} but tectonic activity around the [[Seattle Fault]] may have put Haleets in the intertidal zone.{{refn|group=notes|Alcalá 2013: "Within human memory, Laxelks, now called [[Wing Point, Bainbridge Island, Washington|Wing Point]], fell about three feet during an earthquake."{{sfn|Alcalá|2013}}}}

{{Biological classification}}

The '''legion''', in [[biological classification]], is a non-obligatory [[taxonomic rank]] within the [[Linnaean taxonomy|Linnaean hierarchy]] sometimes used in [[zoology]].

==Taxonomic rank==
In [[zoology|zoological]] [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], the legion is:
#subordinate to the [[class (taxonomy)|class]]
#superordinate to the [[cohort (taxonomy)|cohort]]. 
#consists of a group of related [[Order (biology)|order]]s

Legions may be grouped into '''superlegions''' or subdivided into '''sublegions''', and these again into '''infralegions'''.

==Use in zoology==
Legions and their super/sub/infra groups have been employed in some classifications of [[birds]] and [[mammals]]. Full use is made of all of these (along with '''cohorts''' and '''supercohorts''') in, for example, [[Mammal classification#McKenna.2FBell classification|McKenna and Bell's classification of mammals]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Malcolm McKenna|McKenna, Malcolm C.]] and Susan K. Bell (editors). 1997. ''Classification of Mammals Above the Species Level''. New York: Columbia University Press. {{ISBN|0-231-11013-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{other uses|Madi (disambiguation)}}

'''Madí''' (or MADI; also known as Grupo Madí or Arte Madí) is an international abstract (or concrete) art movement initiated in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946 by the Hungarian-Argentinian artist and poet [[Gyula Kosice]], and the Uruguayans [[Carmelo Arden Quin]] and [[Rhod Rothfuss]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Made in Madí: Nelson Di Maggio, curador de retrospectiva sobre Carmelo Arden Quin|url=http://ladiaria.com.uy/articulo/2010/11/made-in-madi/|publisher=La Diaria|accessdate=14 June 2012|author=Riccardo Boglione|date=2010-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement focuses on creating [[concrete art]] (i.e., non-representational [[geometric abstraction]]) and encompasses all branches of art (the plastic and pictorial arts, music, literature, theater, architecture, dance, etc.). The artists in the Madí movement consider the concrete, physical reality of the art medium and play with the traditional conventions of [[Western art history|Western art]] (for instance, by creating works on irregularly-shaped canvases).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention "Concrete Invention."] ''Encyclopædia Britannica. Encyclopædia Britannica Online''. Encyclopædia Britannica, 2010. Web. 30 Dec. 2010. &lt;http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1193621/Concrete-Invention&gt;.&lt;/ref&gt; Artwork of Madí movement appeared in eight issues of its magazine, ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'', published between 1947 and 1954.

== Historical Context ==
The Madí art movement formed as a reaction to the major concrete art movement in Argentina at the time, known as the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI), whose art was perceived by the Madí group as being too strict in their method of creating concrete art, resulting in a lack of expression in their artworks. 

Operating under the rule of Colonel [[Juan Perón|Perón]], whose time in power was characterized by a volatile political climate, the Madí artists used their art to make statements with social and political implications. One of the most overt criticisms made by the Madí movement criticized cultural authorities in the ''[[Arte Madí Universal]]'' magazine'','' commenting "[t]he last submission to the Venice Biennial has signified for Argentina a blunt negation of the new [artistic] values. We invite competent authorities to stop and compare the true current of contemporary plastic arts with the submissions that today put us [our country] half a century behind", which vaguely attack the aesthetic choices of certain cultural officers under Perón. According to [[Pérez-Barreiro]], Madí and Concrete art (referring to the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI)) are the artistic parallel(s) of the political phenomenon of [[Peronism]]. These artists were also seen as combining modern art with Communist ideology. Some scholars, including Barreiro, saw the government was an outspoken critic against concrete art as a whole, whereas others such as [[Andrea Giunta]] assert that the Madí and Concrete groups were not victimized under Perón's regime; rather, they "coexisted on its margins".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The political regime of Perón made use of both linguistic and visual images for propaganda purposes. This is seen in his use of an image, "the shirtless workers" (los descamisados), as an alternative to the concept of the working class. This image had strong connections and connotations with the male worker, shirtless and, unrealistically, without much affliction. In a speech given October 17th, 1946 at Plaza de Mayo, Perón addressed the workers in speeches as "mis queridos descamisados" (my loving shirtless workers). At this speech, he declared October 17th the "Day of the Shirtless Workers" and stated "I don’t want to govern over men but over their hearts, because mine beats in unison with the heart of each shirtless worker, which I interpret and love above all things.” The use of representations to create propaganda opened up a clear target for the Madí artists to oppose.

== Origin of the name ==
Gyula Kosice, who also operated under the pseudonym Raymundo Rasas Pèt, has explained that the name for the movement is derived from the [[Second Spanish Republic|Republican]] motto in the [[Spanish Civil War]], "''Madrí, Madrí, no pasarán''" ("Madrid, Madrid, they will not make it in", i.e., the [[Francisco Franco|Francoist forces]] will not invade Madrid).&lt;ref&gt;[http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml "Entrevista a Gyula Kosice"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120629170755/http://misitio.fibertel.com.ar/niusletercultura/Content40181.shtml |date=29 June 2012 }}, ''Ñusleter Cultura'', 12 de agosto de 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The name is most typically understood as an acronym for ''Movimiento, Abstracción, Dimensión, Invención'' (Movement, Abstraction, Dimension, Invention).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

== Characteristics ==
{{Refimprove section|date=December 2010}}
A Madí work is non-figurative and non-representational; it has a cut-out or irregularly-shaped form, which takes away the viewer's perception of spatial depth that a rectangular frame provides; its colors are flat and sharply defined; it is often three-dimensional and sometimes articulated and/or mechanical; and it is playful in spirit. Madí artists were concerned with creating artworks that were autonomous with functions that naturally transcend the physical features that constitute the work. Introducing elements of transformation and ambiguity were techniques commonly employed by these artists to avoid representation as well as avoid the fixity of representations. In painted works, some artists would intentionally lower the legibility of the design.

The incorporation of unusual materials into artworks is seen throughout the art movement movement; this includes Plexiglas, fluorescent tubes, neon lights, water, metal, and other materials. An example of this is seen in [[Gyula Kosice|Kosice's]] first hydraulic piece, ''La arquitectura del agua: Hidro-escultura (The Architecture of Water: Hydro-Sculpture)'', which utilized light and water interaction.

Madí artists sought to combat representational forms because this art reflected and perpetuated class-based social organizations. They believed that representational images "forced others to relate to concepts, connotations, and feelings which were superfluous to the object itself... which enticed individuals into supporting class-based organizations". The Concrete art they produced was meant to have a reality that was self-contained. In other words, the reality of the art ended in the object. In the minds of the Madí artists, "Concrete art was worthy as a contribution to social liberation" because it helped its audience grasp true reality while standing against the concepts, connotations and feelings associated with art. To state this differently, exposing people to what is actually reality allows people to eventually confront myths perpetuated by the bourgeois that has suppressed revolution.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Madí is perhaps the sole remaining art movement which can boast of a half-century of uninterrupted activity since its creation in [[Buenos Aires]] in 1946. Today, the MADI movement has over 60 members — painters, sculptors, architects and poets — working in France, Italy, Belgium, Spain, Hungary, Japan, [[Argentina]] and the United States. One prominent figure behind this fifty years of artistic creation is [[Carmelo Arden Quin]].

== The Madí Manifesto ==
The Madí Manifesto was created to defend the importance of invention in the light of limitations imposed on concrete art by the excessive rationalism of European concrete art. This strictness of form in concrete art was also demonstrated by the [[Asociación Arte Concreto-Invención]] (AACI). The manifesto also called for "the integration of the nonorthogonal framework into representational space".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Geometric Abstraction: Latin American Art from the Patricia Phelps de Cisneros Collection|last=Bois|first=Yve-Alan|publisher=Harvard University Art Museums|year=2001|isbn=|location=Massachusetts|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Madí Dictionary ==
In written works, artists "disrupted the construction of semantically coherent structures" to avoid attaching meaning to the art and the possibility of representation. The Madí created a dictionary that accomplished the opposite of what a normal dictionary does in that it confused and distorted the meanings of words and made up words. The following excerpt is from the Madí dictionary, which demonstrates a correct grammatical structure that relates ideas that are impossible to interpret meaningfully.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This is an example of this incoherent construction which prevents interpretation:&lt;blockquote&gt;M               &lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Maclode: Upward hill. / Slope to insinuate land.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Meril: Kidnapping of flat centimeters. / ''Madícional'' [‘Madí-like’ or ‘of Madí origin’] opposition and resistance.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Miogue: Account of events in which the authors of great answers participated.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Molois: Site where the most varied adjectives are collected. / ''Fam''. Insult.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Musver: About the manner to focus in photography the liveliest glare of a childhood memory. / Fixation.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Macichud: Line of shade that emits a loosening of gray beams.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;N&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nandy: Arrangement for new personal cuño.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nem-Er: Record of instances.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Nigs: Opening that is left so that a cluster of enchanted powder emigrates.&lt;/blockquote&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Novoh: Shooter that the riverside authority exercises to learn the coastal ruling&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Selected Artists and Artworks ==
Representatives of the Madí movement, in addition to Kosice, Quin and Rothfuss, include [[Martín Blaszko]], [[Waldo Longo]], [[Juan Bay]], [[Esteban Eitler]], [[Diyi Laañ]], and [[Valdo Wellington]], among others.

== Why MADI? ==
To the question, "Why MADI?" Josee Lapeyrere, who met Arden Quin in 1962 and has since participated with her poem-objects in most of the events organized by the movement, replies: "MADI's goal is to be rigorous, inventive, gay and ludic."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=MADI internacional 50 años después: exposición del 7 de marzo al 3 de abril de 1996, Centro de Exposiciones y Congresos, Zaragoza|last=Osornio|first=Cesar Lopez|last2=Roitman|first2=Ibercaja|publisher=Ibercaja|year=1996|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the importance to which they accord spiritual and imaginative games, even the most serious MADI artists can be described as playful. Already in 1795, Schiller focused on "the inborn playful nature of man" as an explanation for his production of art forms. In his essay, "[[Homo Ludens]]" ("Ludic Man") (1938), [[Johan Huizinga]] observed that, "Play reveals an aspiration to beauty. The terms we use to designate the elements of play are, for the most part, the same as those utilized in the aesthetic realm: beauty, tension, balancing, equilibrium, gradation, contrast, etc. Like art, play engages and delivers. It absorbs. It captivates, or, in other words, it charms. It is full of those two supremely noble qualities which man expresses through rhythm and harmony." The French art critic [[Dominique Jacquemin]] also remarks that, "It is possible that Arden Quin's passion for game playing led him to create MADI, the only remaining contemporary art movement which can pride itself in possessing both coherence and a truly international outlook."

The '''Marsh Chapel Experiment''', also called the "'''Good Friday Experiment'''", was a 1962 experiment conducted on [[Good Friday]] at [[Boston University]]'s [[Marsh Chapel]]. [[Walter N. Pahnke]], a graduate student in theology at [[Harvard Divinity School]], designed the experiment under the supervision of [[Timothy Leary]] and the [[Harvard Psilocybin Project]].&lt;ref name="Pahnke 1966"/&gt; Pahnke's experiment investigated whether [[psilocybin]] (the active principle in [[psilocybin mushroom]]s) would act as a reliable [[entheogen]] in religiously predisposed subjects.&lt;ref name="Pahnke PhD" /&gt;

==Experiment==
Prior to the Good Friday service, graduate degree divinity student volunteers from the [[Boston]] area were randomly divided into two groups. In a [[double-blind]] experiment, half of the students received psilocybin, while a [[control group]] received a large dose of [[niacin]]. Niacin produces clear physiological changes and thus was used as an [[active placebo]]. In at least some cases, those who received the niacin initially believed they had received the psychoactive drug.&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|5}} However, the feeling of face flushing (turning red, feeling hot and tingly) produced by niacin subsided after about an hour after receiving the dose. However, the effects of the psilocybin intensified over the first few hours. 

Almost all of the members of the experimental group reported experiencing profound religious experiences, providing empirical support for the notion that [[psychedelic drug]]s can facilitate religious experiences. One of the participants in the experiment was religious scholar [[Huston Smith]], who would become an author of several textbooks on [[comparative religion]]. He later described his experience as "the most powerful cosmic homecoming I have ever experienced".&lt;ref name= "Smith 2000"/&gt;

==Doblin's follow-up==
In a 25-year follow-up to the experiment, all of the subjects given psilocybin described their experience as having elements of "a genuine mystical nature and characterized it as one of the high points of their spiritual life".&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|13}} Psychedelic researcher [[Rick Doblin]] considered Pahnke's original study partially flawed due to incorrect implementation of the [[double-blind]] procedure, and several imprecise questions in the mystical experience questionnaire. Nevertheless, Doblin said that Pahnke's study cast "a considerable doubt on the assertion that mystical experiences catalyzed by drugs are in any way inferior to non-drug mystical experiences in both their immediate content and long-term effects".&lt;ref name="Doblin 1991"/&gt;{{Rp|24}} A similar sentiment was expressed by clinical psychologist William A. Richards, who in 2007 stated "[psychedelic] mushroom use may constitute one technology for evoking revelatory experiences that are similar, if not identical, to those that occur through so-called spontaneous alterations of brain chemistry."&lt;ref name="Richards 2008"/&gt;

==Griffiths' study==
In 2002 (published in 2006), a more rigorously controlled version of this experiment was conducted at [[Johns Hopkins University]] by [[Roland R. Griffiths]], yielding similar results.&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2006"/&gt; In a 14-month follow-up to this study, over half of the participants rated the experience among the top five most meaningful spiritual experiences in their lives, and considered the experience to have increased their personal well-being and life satisfaction.&lt;ref name="Griffiths 2008"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12053">{{math|}}The '''Mathematics Subject Classification (MSC)''' is an alphanumerical [[classification scheme]] collaboratively produced by staff of, and based on the coverage of, the two major mathematical reviewing databases, [[Mathematical Reviews]] and [[Zentralblatt MATH]]. The MSC is used by many mathematics [[Academic journal|journals]], which ask authors of [[research papers]] and expository articles to list subject codes from the Mathematics Subject Classification in their papers. The current version is MSC2010.

== Structure ==

The MSC is a hierarchical scheme, with three levels of structure. A classification can be two, three or five digits long, depending on how many levels of the classification scheme are used.

The first level is represented by a two digit number, the second by a letter, and the third by another two digit number. For example:

* '''53''' is the classification for [[differential geometry]]
* '''53A''' is the classification for classical differential geometry
* '''53A45''' is the classification for [[Euclidean vector|vector]] and [[tensor]] analysis

=== First level ===
At the top level, 64 mathematical disciplines are labeled with a unique 2 digit number. As well as the typical areas of mathematical research, there are top level categories for "[[History]] and [[Biography]]", "[[Mathematics Education]]", and for the overlap with different sciences. [[Physics]] (i.e. mathematical physics) is particularly well represented in the classification scheme with a number of different categories including:
* [[Fluid mechanics]]
* [[Quantum mechanics]]
* [[Geophysics]]
* [[Optics]] and [[electromagnetic theory]]

All valid MSC classification codes must have at least the first level identifier.

=== Second level ===

The second level codes are a single letter from the Latin alphabet. These represent specific areas covered by the first level discipline. The second level codes vary from discipline to discipline.

For example, for differential geometry, the top-level code is '''53''', and the second-level codes are:
* '''A''' for classical differential geometry
* '''B''' for local differential geometry
* '''C''' for global differential geometry
* '''D''' for symplectic geometry and contact geometry

In addition, the special second level code "-" is used for specific kinds of materials. These codes are of the form:

* '''53-00''' General reference works (handbooks, dictionaries, bibliographies, etc.)
* '''53-01''' Instructional exposition (textbooks, tutorial papers, etc.)
* '''53-02''' Research exposition (monographs, survey articles)
* '''53-03''' Historical (must also be assigned at least one classification number from Section 01)
* '''53-04''' Explicit machine computation and programs (not the theory of computation or programming)
* '''53-06''' Proceedings, conferences, collections, etc.

The second and third level of these codes are always the same - only the first level changes. For example, it is not valid to use '''53-''' as a classification. Either '''53''' on its own or, better yet, a more specific code should be used.

=== Third level ===

Third level codes are the most specific, usually corresponding to a specific kind of mathematical object or a well-known problem or research area.

The third-level code '''99''' exists in every category and means ''none of the above, but in this section''

== Using the scheme ==

The AMS recommends that papers submitted to its journals for publication have one primary classification and one or more optional secondary classifications. A typical MSC subject class line on a research paper looks like

MSC Primary 03C90; Secondary 03-02;

=={{anchor|MOS|AMS Classification|MSC1990|MSC2000|MSC2010}}History==
{{expand section|date=January 2014}}
According to the [[American Mathematical Society]] (AMS) help page about MSC,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ams.org/mathscinet/help/field_help.html#mscp]&lt;/ref&gt; the MSC has been revised a number of times since 1940. Based on a scheme to organize AMS's ''Mathematical Offprint Service'' (MOS scheme), the ''AMS Classification'' was established for the classification of reviews in ''Mathematical Reviews'' in the 1960s. It saw various ad-hoc changes. Despite its shortcomings, [[Zentralblatt für Mathematik]] started to use it as well in the 1970s. In the late 1980s, a jointly revised scheme with more formal rules was agreed upon by Mathematical Reviews and Zentralblatt für Mathematik under the new name Mathematics Subject Classification. It saw various revisions as ''MSC1990'', ''MSC2000'' and ''MSC2010''.&lt;ref&gt;Bernd Wegner. ''Indexierung mathematischer Literatur Die Revision der Mathematics Subject Classification MSC''. Institute of Mathematics, TU Berlin. http://fidmath.de/fileadmin/download/graz_wegner.ppt&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2016, Mathematical Reviews and zbMATH started collecting input from the mathematical community on the next revision of MSC, which is due to be released in 2020.&lt;ref&gt;[https://msc2020.org Announcement of the plan to revise the Mathematics Subject Classification]&lt;/ref&gt; The original classification of older items has not been changed. This can sometimes make it difficult to search for older works dealing with particular topics. Changes at the first level involved the subjects with (present) codes 03, 08, 12-20, 28, 37, 51, 58, 74, 90, 91, 92.

== Relation to other classification schemes ==

For physics papers the [[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]] (PACS) is often used. Due to the large overlap between mathematics and physics research it is quite common to see both PACS and MSC codes on research papers, particularly for multidisciplinary journals and repositories such as the [[arXiv]].

The [[ACM Computing Classification System]] (CCS) is a similar hierarchical classification scheme for [[computer science]]. There is some overlap between the AMS and ACM classification schemes, in subjects related to both mathematics and computer science, however the two schemes differ in the details of their organization of those topics.

The classification scheme used on the arXiv is chosen to reflect the papers submitted. As arXiv is multidisciplinary its classification scheme does not fit entirely with the MSC, ACM or PACS classification schemes. It is common to see codes from one or more of these schemes on individual papers.

The '''Nano Science and Technology Consortium (NSTC)''' is a private industry association founded in 2005 to offer learning and knowledge services in [[nanotechnology]]. 

Starting then, it has published two periodicals. The journal ''NanoTrends'', a journal of nanoscience and technology, is published in online format every two months and printed every six months. It provides for the  accelerated publication of research articles related to the nano domain and its applications. The  online newsletter ''NanoSpectacle'' is published monthly. It summarizes the last months developments related to nano world and covers topics like coming events, new books released, book reviews etc.

The society   has launched the distance learning  "Nanotechnology Sensitization Program".  which provides  guidance to its students on various subjects and areas of Nano Science and Technology. It also sponsors workshops and other educational events.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This field intends to unite [[functional genomics]] and [[neurobiology]] in order to understand the nervous system as a whole from a genomic perspective.

The nervous system in vertebrates is made up of two major types of cells – [[Neuroglia|neuroglial cells]] and [[neuron]]s. Hundreds of different types of neurons exist in humans, with varying functions – some of them process external stimuli; others generate a response to stimuli; others organize in centralized structures ([[brain]], [[Ganglia, spinal|spinal ganglia]]) that are responsible for cognition, perception, and regulation of motor functions. Neurons in these centralized locations tend to organize in giant networks and communicate extensively with each other. Prior to the availability of [[Gene expression profiling|expression arrays]] and [[DNA sequencing|DNA sequencing methodologies]], researchers sought to understand the cellular behaviour of neurons (including [[Synapse|synapse formation]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;and neuronal development and regionalization in the human nervous system) in terms of the underlying molecular biology and biochemistry, without any understanding of the influence of a neuron’s genome on its development and behaviour. As our understanding of the genome has expanded, the role of networks of gene interactions in the maintenance of neuronal function and behaviour has garnered interest in the [[neuroscience]] research community. Neurogenomics allows scientists to study the nervous system of organisms in the context of these underlying regulatory and transcriptional networks. This approach is distinct from [[neurogenetics]], which emphasizes the role of single genes without a network-interaction context when studying the nervous system.&lt;ref name="Jain 7–16"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Neurogenetics and Neurogenomics|url = https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-62703-272-8_2|publisher = Humana Press|date = 2013-01-01|isbn = 9781627032711|pages = 7–16|language = en|first = Kewal K.|last = Jain}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Probes can also have species-specific binding affinities that can confound comparative analysis.

Notably, the association between behavioural patterns and high [[penetrance]] single [[Gene locus|gene loci]] falls under the purview of [[neurogenetics]] research, wherein the focus is to identify a simple causative relationship between a single, high penetrance gene and an observed function/behaviour.  However, it has been shown that several neurological diseases tend to be [[Polygenic disorder|polygenic]], being influenced by multiple different [[gene]]s and [[regulatory regions]] instead of one gene alone. There has hence been a shift from single gene approaches to network approaches for studying neurological development and diseases, a shift that has been greatly propelled by the advent of [[next generation sequencing]] methodologies.

However, linkage studies have largely failed at identifying causative variants for psychiatric disorders such as these, primarily because of their complex genetic architecture.

With the availability of massively parallel [[next generation sequencing]] methodologies, scientists have been able to look beyond the probe based captures of expressed genes. [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]], for example, identifies 25-60% more expressed genes than microarrays do. In the upcoming field of neurogenomics, it is hoped that by understanding the genomic profiles of different parts of the brain, we might be able to improve our understanding of how the interactions between genes and pathways influence cellular function and development. This approach is expected to be able to identify the secondary gene networks that are disrupted in neurological disorders, subsequently assisting drug development stratagems for brain diseases.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|title = Opinion: The Present and Future of Neurogenomics {{!}} The Scientist Magazine®|url = http://www.the-scientist.com/?articles.view/articleNo/36028/title/Opinion--The-Present-and-Future-of-Neurogenomics/|website = The Scientist|access-date = 2016-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[BRAIN Initiative|BRAIN initiative]] launched in 2013, for example, seeks to "''inform the development of future treatments for brain disorders, including Alzheimer’s disease, epilepsy, and traumatic brain injury''"  .

Additionally, these mutations are not statistically enriched in individual genes, but rather, exhibit patterns of statistical enrichment in groups of genes associated with networks regulating neurological development and maintenance. Such a discovery would have been impossible with prior gene-centric approaches ([[neurogenetics]], [[Behavioral neuroscience|behavioural neuroscience]]). Neurogenomics allows for a high-throughput system-based approach for understanding the [[Polygenic disorder|polygenic]] basis of [[Neuropsychiatric disorder|neuropsychiatric]] disorders.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

===Imaging studies and optical mapping===
When [[autism]] was identified as a distinct biological disorder in the 1980s, researchers found that autistic individuals showed a brain growth abnormality in the [[cerebellum]] in their early developmental years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Hypoplasia of cerebellar vermal lobules VI and VII in autism|journal = The New England Journal of Medicine|date = 1988-05-26|issn = 0028-4793|pmid = 3367935|pages = 1349–1354|volume = 318|issue = 21|doi = 10.1056/NEJM198805263182102|first = E.|last = Courchesne|first2 = R.|last2 = Yeung-Courchesne|first3 = G. A.|last3 = Press|first4 = J. R.|last4 = Hesselink|first5 = T. L.|last5 = Jernigan}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent research has indicated that 90% of autistic children have a larger brain volume than their peers by 2 to 4 years of age, and show an expansion in the white and gray matter content in the [[cerebrum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Unusual brain growth patterns in early life in patients with autistic disorder: an MRI study|journal = Neurology|date = 2001-07-24|issn = 0028-3878|pmid = 11468308|pages = 245–254|volume = 57|issue = 2|first = E.|last = Courchesne|first2 = C.

These findings highlighted the influence of structural variance in the brain on psychiatric disorders, and have motivated the use of imaging technologies to map regions of divergence between healthy and diseased brains. Furthermore, while it may not always be possible to retrieve biological specimens from different areas live human brains, [[neuroimaging]] techniques offer a noninvasive means to understanding the biological basis of neurological disorders. It is hoped that an understanding of localization patterns of different psychiatric diseases could in turn inform network analysis studies in neurogenomics.

====MRI====
[[Magnetic resonance imaging|Structural Magnetic Resonance Imaging]] (MRI) can be used to identify the structural composition of the brain. Particularly in the context of neurogenomics, MRI has played an extensive role in the study of [[Alzheimer's disease]](AD) over the past four decades. It was initially used to rule out other causes of [[dementia]],&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but recent studies indicated the presence of characteristic changes in patients with AD. As a result, MRI scans are currently being used as a neuroimaging tool to help identify the temporal and spatial pathophysiology of Alzheimer's disease, such as specific cerebral alterations and [[amyloid imaging]].&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

The ease and non-invasive nature of MRI scans has motivated research projects that trace the development and onset of psychiatric diseases in the brain. Alzheimer disease has become a key candidate in this topographical approach to psychiatric diseases. For example, MRI scans are currently being used to track the resting and task-dependent functional profiles of brains in children with autosomal dominant Alzheimer disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Brain Imaging and Blood Biomarker Abnormalities in Children With Autosomal Dominant Alzheimer Disease: A Cross-Sectional Study|journal = JAMA Neurology|date = 2015-08-01|issn = 2168-6157|pmc = 4625544|pmid = 26121081|pages = 912–919|volume = 72|issue = 8|doi = 10.1001/jamaneurol.2015.1099|first = Yakeel T.|last = Quiroz|first2 = Aaron P.|last2 = Schultz|first3 = Kewei|last3 = Chen|first4 = Hillary D.|last4 = Protas|first5 = Michael|last5 = Brickhouse|first6 = Adam S.|last6 = Fleisher|first7 = Jessica B.|last7 = Langbaum|first8 = Pradeep|last8 = Thiyyagura|first9 = Anne M.|last9 = Fagan}}&lt;/ref&gt; These studies have found indications of early onset brain alterations in at-risk individuals for AD.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The Autism Center of Excellence at University of California, San Diego, is also conducting MRI studies with children between 12 and 42 months, in the hopes of characterizing brain development abnormalities in children who present behavioural symptoms of autism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = UC San Diego Autism Center of Excellence|url = https://autism-center.ucsd.edu/Pages/default.aspx|website = autism-center.ucsd.edu|access-date = 2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additional research has indicated that there are specifics patterns of [[atrophy]] in the cerebrum (as a repercussion of [[neurodegeneration]]) in different neurological disorders and diseases. These disease-specific patterns of progression of atrophy can be identified with MRI scans, and provide a clinical phenotype context to neurogenomic research. The temporal information about disease progression provided by this approach can also potentially inform the interpretation of gene network-level perturbations in psychiatric diseases.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==== Optical mapping ====
One prohibitive feature of 2nd generation sequencing methodologies is the upper limit on the genomic range accessible by [[Whole genome sequencing|mate-pairing.]] [[Optical mapping]] is an emerging methodology used to span large-scale variants that cannot usually be detected using paired end reads. This approach has been successfully applied to detect [[Structural variation|structural variants]] in [[oligodendroglioma]], a type of brain cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Discovery of structural alterations in solid tumor oligodendroglioma by single molecule analysis|url = http://bmcgenomics.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/1471-2164-14-505|journal = BMC Genomics|date = 2013-07-26|pmc = 3727977|pmid = 23885787|volume = 14|issue = 1|doi = 10.1186/1471-2164-14-505|language = En|first = Mohana|last = Ray|first2 = Steve|last2 = Goldstein|first3 = Shiguo|last3 = Zhou|first4 = Konstantinos|last4 = Potamousis|first5 = Deepayan|last5 = Sarkar|first6 = Michael A|last6 = Newton|first7 = Elizabeth|last7 = Esterberg|first8 = Christina|last8 = Kendziorski|first9 = Oliver|last9 = Bogler|pages=505}}&lt;/ref&gt; Recent work has also highlighted the versatility of optical maps in improving existing genome assemblies. [[Chromosomal rearrangement]]s, [[microdeletion]]s, and large-scale [[translocations]] have been associated with impaired neurological and [[cognitive function]], for example in hereditary [[Neuropathy, ataxia, and retinitis pigmentosa|neuropathy]] and [[neurofibromatosis]]. Optical mapping can significantly improve variant detection and inform gene interaction network models for the diseased state in neurological disorders.

==== Studying other brain diseases ====
Apart from neurological disorders, there are additional diseases that manifest in the brain and have formed exemplar use-case scenarios for the application of brain imaging in network analysis. In a classic example of imaging-genomic analyses, a research study in 2012 compared MRI scans and gene expression profiles of 104 glioma patients in order to distinguish treatment outcomes and identify novel targetable genomic pathways in [[Glioblastoma multiforme|Glioblastoma Multiforme]] (GBM). Researchers found two distinct groups of patients with significantly different organization of [[white matter]] (invasive vs non-invasive). Subsequent pathway analysis of the gene expression data indicated mitochondrial dysfunction as the top canonical pathway in an aggressive, low-mortality GBM phenotype.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Imaging genomic mapping of an invasive MRI phenotype predicts patient outcome and metabolic dysfunction: a TCGA glioma phenotype research group project|journal = BMC Medical Genomics|date = 2014-01-01|issn = 1755-8794|pmc = 4057583|pmid = 24889866|pages = 30|volume = 7|doi = 10.1186/1755-8794-7-30|first = Rivka R.|last = Colen|first2 = Mark|last2 = Vangel|first3 = Jixin|last3 = Wang|first4 = David A.|last4 = Gutman|first5 = Scott N.|last5 = Hwang|first6 = Max|last6 = Wintermark|first7 = Rajan|last7 = Jain|first8 = Manal|last8 = Jilwan-Nicolas|first9 = James Y.|last9 = Chen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Expansion of brain imaging approaches to other diseases can be used to rule out other medical illnesses while diagnosing psychiatric disorders, but cannot be used to inform the presence or absence of a psychiatric disorder.

== Research developmental models ==

=== In humans ===
The current approaches in collecting gene expression data in human brains are to use either [[microarray]]s or [[RNA-Seq|RNA-seq]]. Currently, it is rare to gather "live" brain tissue – only when treatments involve brain surgery is there a chance that brain tissue is collected during the procedure. This is the case with epilepsy.

Currently, gene expression data is usually collected on post mortem brains and this is often a barrier to neurogenomics research in humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* The cause of death is also an important variable to consider in the collection of human brain samples for the purposes of neurogenomics research. For example, brain samples of individuals with clinical [[Depression (differential diagnoses)|depression]] are often collected after suicide. Certain conditions of death, such as drug overdose or self-inflicted gunshot, will alter the expression of the brain. 
* Another issue with studying gene expression in brains is the cellular heterogeneity of brain tissue samples. Bulk brain samples may vary in proportions of specific cell populations from case to case. This can impact the gene expression signatures and may significantly change differential expression analysis. 
** One approach to address this issue is to use [[Single cell sequencing|single cell RNA-seq]]. This would control for a specific cell type. However, this solution is only applicable where studies are not cell-type specific.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

===Animal models===
Ongoing genomics research in neurological disorders tends to use animal models (and corresponding [[Homologous chromosome|gene homologs]]) to understand the network interactions underlying a particular disorder due to ethical issues surrounding the retrieval of biological specimens from live human brains. This, too, is not without its roadblocks.

Neurogenomic research with a model organism is contingent on the availability of a fully sequenced and annotated reference genome. Additionally, the RNA profiles ([[MicroRNA|miRNA]], [[Non-coding RNA|ncRNA]], [[Messenger RNA|mRNA]]) of the model organism need to be well catalogued, and any inferences applied from them to humans must have a basis in functional/sequence [[Homology (biology)|homology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

==== Experimental mice models for psychiatric disorders ====
A common approach to using a mouse model is to apply an experimental treatment to a pregnant mouse in order to affect a whole litter. However, a key issue in the field is the treatment of litters in a statistical analysis. Most studies consider the total number of offspring produced as that may lead to an increase in statistical power. However, the correct way is to count by the number of litters and to normalize based on litter size. It was found that several autism studies incorrectly performed their statistical analyses based on total number of offspring instead of number of litters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Several anxiety disorders such as [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|post-traumatic stress disorder]] (PTSD) involve [[Homogeneity and heterogeneity|heterogeneous]] changes in several different brain regions, such as the [[hippocampus]], [[amygdala]], and [[nucleus accumbens]]. The cellular encoding of traumatic events and the behavioral responses triggered by such events has been shown to lie primarily in changes in signaling molecules associated with [[synaptic transmission]].

Global [[gene expression profiling]] of the various gene regions implicated in fear and anxiety processing, using mice models, has led to the identification of temporally and spatially distinct sets of differentially expressed genes. Pathway analysis of these genes has indicated possible roles in [[neurogenesis]] and anxiety-related behavioural responses, alongside other functional and phenotypic observations.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

Mice models for brain research have contributed significantly to [[drug development]] and increased our understanding of the genomic underpinnings of several neurological diseases in the last generation. [[Chlorpromazine]], the first [[antipsychotic]] drug (discovered in 1951), was identified as a viable treatment option after it was shown to suppress response to aversive stimuli in rats in a behavioural screen.

==== Challenges ====
The modelling and assessment of latent symptoms (thoughts, verbal learning, social interactions, cognitive behaviour) remains a challenge when using model organisms to study [[psychiatric disorders]] with a complex genetic [[pathology]]. For example, a given genotype+phenotype in a mouse model must imitate the genomic underpinnings of a phenotype observed in a human.

This is a particularly crucial item of consideration in spectrum disorders such as [[autism]]. Autism is a disorder whose symptoms can be divided into two categories: (i) deficits of social interactions and (ii) repetitive behaviours and restricted interests. Since mice tend to be more social creatures amongst all members of the order ''[[Rodent]]ia'' currently being used as model organisms, mice are generally used to model human psychiatric disorders as closely as possible. Particularly for autism, the following work-arounds are currently in place to emulate human behavioural symptoms:
* For the first diagnostic category of impaired social behaviour, mice are subject to a social assay intended to represent typical autistic social deficits. Normal social behaviour for mice includes sniffing, following, physical contact and [[allogrooming]]. Vocal communication could be used as well. 
* There are a number of ways the second diagnostic category can be observed in mice. Examples of repetitive behaviours can include excessive circling, self-grooming and excessive digging. Usually these behaviours would be performed consistently within a long measurement of time (i.e. self-grooming for 10 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

** While repetitive behaviours are easily observable, it is difficult to characterize actual restricted interests of mice. One aspect of restricted interests of autistic individuals is the "insistence of sameness"—the concept that autistic individuals require their environment to remain consistent. If that environment should change, the individual would experience stress and anxiety. There has been reported success in confirming a mouse model of autism by changing the mouse’s environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

In any of these experiments, the ‘autistic’ mice have a ‘normal’ socializing partner and the scientists observing the mice is unaware/'''blind''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' to the genotypes of the mice.

==Gene expression in the brain==
The gene expression profile of the [[central nervous system]] (CNS) is unique. Eighty percent of all human genes are expressed in the brain; 5,000 of these genes are solely expressed in the CNS. The human brain has the highest amount of gene expression of all studied mammalian brains. In comparison, tissues outside of the brain will have more similar expression levels in comparison to their mammalian counterparts. One source of the increased expression levels in the human brain is from the non-protein coding region of the genome. Numerous studies have indicated that the human brain have a higher level of expression in regulatory regions in comparison to other mammalian brains. There is also notable enrichment for more [[alternative splicing]] events in the human brain.&lt;ref name="Jain 7–16"/&gt;

===Spatial differences===
Gene expression profiles also vary within specific regions of the brain. A [[Microarray-based comparative genomic hybridization|microarray study]] showed that the transcriptome profile of the CNS clusters together based on region. A different study characterized the regulation of gene expression across 10 different regions based on their [[Expression quantitative trait loci|eQTL]] signals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genetic variability in the regulation of gene expression in ten regions of the human brain|url = http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v17/n10/full/nn.3801.html|journal = Nature Neuroscience|date = 2014-10-01|issn = 1097-6256|pmc = 4208299|pmid = 25174004|pages = 1418–1428|volume = 17|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/nn.3801|language = en|first = Adaikalavan|last = Ramasamy|first2 = Daniah|last2 = Trabzuni|first3 = Sebastian|last3 = Guelfi|first4 = Vibin|last4 = Varghese|first5 = Colin|last5 = Smith|first6 = Robert|last6 = Walker|first7 = Tisham|last7 = De|last8 = UK Brain Expression Consortium|last9 = North American Brain Expression Consortium}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of the varying expression profiles relates to function, [[neuron migration]] and cellular heterogeneity of the region.

A study completed at Harvard Medical School in 2014 was able to identify developmental lineages stemming from single base neuronal mutations. The researchers sequenced 36 neurons from the cerebral cortex of three normal individuals, and found that highly expressed genes, and neural associated genes, were significantly enriched for single-neuron [[Single nucleotide variants|SNVs]]. These SNVs, in turn, were found to be correlated with chromatin markers of transcription from fetal brain.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Somatic mutation in single human neurons tracks developmental and transcriptional history|journal = Science|date = 2015-10-02|issn = 1095-9203|pmc = 4664477|pmid = 26430121|pages = 94–98|volume = 350|issue = 6256|doi = 10.1126/science.aab1785|first = Michael A.|last = Lodato|first2 = Mollie B.|last2 = Woodworth|first3 = Semin|last3 = Lee|first4 = Gilad D.|last4 = Evrony|first5 = Bhaven K.|last5 = Mehta|first6 = Amir|last6 = Karger|first7 = Soohyun|last7 = Lee|first8 = Thomas W.|last8 = Chittenden|first9 = Alissa M.|last9 = D'Gama}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development patterns in humans===
Gene expression of the brain changes throughout the different phases of life. The most significant levels of expression are found during early development, with the rate of gene expression being highest during fetal development. This results from the rapid growth of neurons in the embryo. Neurons at this stage are undergoing [[Neuron|neuronal differentiation]], [[cell proliferation]], migration events and dendritic and [[Synapse|synaptic development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Transcriptional landscape of the prenatal human brain|url = http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v508/n7495/full/nature13185.html|journal = Nature|date = 2014-04-10|issn = 0028-0836|pmc = 4105188|pmid = 24695229|pages = 199–206|volume = 508|issue = 7495|doi = 10.1038/nature13185|language = en|first = Jeremy A.|last = Miller|first2 = Song-Lin|last2 = Ding|first3 = Susan M.|last3 = Sunkin|first4 = Kimberly A.|last4 = Smith|first5 = Lydia|last5 = Ng|first6 = Aaron|last6 = Szafer|first7 = Amanda|last7 = Ebbert|first8 = Zackery L.|last8 = Riley|first9 = Joshua J.|last9 = Royall}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gene expression patterns shift closer towards specialized functional functional profiles during embryonic development, however, certain developmental steps are still ongoing at parturition. Consequently, gene expression profiles of the two brain hemispheres appear asymmetrical at birth. At birth, gene expression profiles appear asymmetrical between [[Cerebral hemisphere|brain hemispheres]]. As development continues, the gene expression profiles become similar between the hemispheres.  Given a healthy adult, expression profiles stay relatively consistent from the late twenties into the late forties. From the fifties onwards, there is significant decrease in the expression of genes important for regular function. Despite this, there is an increase in the diversity of genes being expressed across the brain. This age related change in expression may be correlated with [[GC-content|GC content]]. At later stages of life, there is an increase in the induction of low GC-content pivotal genes as well as an increase in the repression of high GC-content pivotal genes.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Another cause of the shift in gene diversity is the accumulation of mutations and DNA damage. Gene expression studies show that genes that accrue these age-related mutations are consistent between individuals in the aging population. Genes that are highly expressed at development decrease significantly at late stages in life, whereas genes that are highly repressed at development increase significantly at the late stages.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Sequence data is used to understand the evolutionary genetic changes which led to the development of the human CNS. We can then understand how the neurological phenotypes differ between species. [[Comparative genomics]] entails comparison of sequence data across a [[Phylogenetics|phylogeny]] to pinpoint the genotypic changes that occur within specific lineages, and understand how these changes might have arisen. The increase in high quality mammalian reference sequences generally makes [[Qualitative comparative analysis|comparative analysis]] better as it increases [[statistical power]]. However, the increase in number of species in a [[phylogeny]] does risk adding unnecessary noise as the alignments of the [[Orthologous gene|orthologous]] sequences usually decrease in quality. Furthermore, different classes of species will have significant differences in their phenotypes.&lt;ref name="Geschwind 633–647"&gt;{{Cite journal

Despite this, comparative genomics has allowed us to connect the genetic changes found in a phylogeny to specific pathways. In order to determine this, lineages are tested for the functional changes that accrue over time. This is often measured as a ratio of [[nonsynonymous substitution]]s to [[synonymous substitution]]s or the [[dN/dS ratio]] (sometimes, further abbreviated to ω). When the dN/dS ratio is greater than 1, this indicates [[positive selection]]. A dN/dS ratio equal to 1 is evidence of no selective pressures. A dN/dS ratio less than 1 indicates [[negative selection (artificial selection)|negative selection]]. For example, the conserved regions of the genome will generally have a dN/dS ratio of less than 1 since any changes to those positions will likely be detrimental.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{Cite journal

Understanding the significance of the [[positive selection]] is generally the next step. For example, ''[[ASPM (gene)|ASPM]]'', ''[[CDK5RAP2]]'' and ''[[NIN (gene)|NIN]]'' are genes that are positively selected for on the human lineage and have been directly correlated with brain size. This finding may help elucidate why human brains are larger than other mammalian brains.&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

=== Network level expression differences between species ===
It is thought that gene expression changes, being the ultimate response for any genetic changes, are a good proxy for understanding [[Phenotype|phenotypic]] differences within biological samples. Comparative studies have revealed a range of differences in the [[Transcriptional regulation|transcriptional controls]] between [[primate]]s and [[rodent]]s. For example, the gene ''[[CNTNAP2]]'' is specifically enriched for in the [[prefrontal cortex]]. The mouse homolog of ''CNTNAP2'' is not expressed in the mouse brain. ''CNTNAP2'' has been implicated in cognitive functions of language as well as [[neurodevelopmental disorder]]s such as Autism Spectrum Disorder. This suggests that the control of expression plays a significant role in the development in unique human cognitive function.  As a consequence, a number of studies have investigated the brain specific enhancers. [[Transcription factor]]s such as ''[[SOX5]]'' have been found to be positively selected for on the human lineage. Gene expression studies in humans, [[chimpanzee]]s and [[rhesus macaque]]s, have identified human specific co-expression networks, and an elevation in gene expression in the human cortex in comparison to primates.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Decoding human gene expression signatures in the brain|journal = Transcription|date = 2013-06-01|issn = 2154-1272|pmc = 4042582|pmid = 23665540|pages = 102–108|volume = 4|issue = 3|first = Guang-Zhong|last = Wang|first2 = Genevieve|last2 = Konopka|doi=10.4161/trns.24885}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disorders==

Neurogenomic disorders manifest themselves as [[neurological disorder]]s with a complex genetic architecture and a [[Non-Mendelian inheritance|non-Mendelian]]-like pattern of inheritance.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; Some examples of these disorders include [[Bipolar disorder]] and [[Schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Several genes may be involved in the manifestation of the disorder, and mutations in such disorders are generally rare and ''de novo.'' Hence it becomes extremely unlikely to observe the same (potentially causative) variant in two unrelated individuals affected with the same neurogenomic disorder.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Ongoing research has implicated several ''[[De novo mutation|de novo]]'' exonic variations and structural variations in [[Autism spectrum|Autism Spectrum Disorder]] (ASD), for example.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The [[allelic spectrum]] of the rare and common variants in neurogenomic disorders therefore necessitates a need for large cohort studies in order to effectively exclude low effect variants and identify the overarching pathways frequently mutated in the different disorders, rather than specific genes and specific [[High-penetrance|high penetrance]] mutations.

[[Whole genome sequencing]] (WGS) and [[whole exome sequencing]] (WES) has been used in [[Genome-wide association study|Genome Wide Association Studies]] (GWAS) to  characterize genetic variants associated with neurogenomic disorders. However, the impact of these variants cannot always be verified because of the non-Mendelian inheritance patterns observed in several of these disorders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Another prohibitive feature in network analysis is the lack of large-scale datasets for many psychiatric (neurogenomic) diseases. Since several diseases with neurogenomic underpinnings tend to have a [[Polygenic disorder|polygenic]] basis, several nonspecific, rare, and partially penetrant ''de novo'' mutations in different patients can contribute to the same observed range of phenotypes, as is the case with Autism Spectrum Disorder and schizophrenia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

=== Modelling psychiatric disorders in neurogenomics research – issues ===
One major [[Genome-wide association study|GWAS]] study identified 13 new risk loci for [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Genome-wide association analysis identifies 13 new risk loci for schizophrenia|journal = Nature Genetics|date = 2013-10-01|issn = 1546-1718|pmc = 3827979|pmid = 23974872|pages = 1150–1159|volume = 45|issue = 10|doi = 10.1038/ng.2742|first = Stephan|last = Ripke|first2 = Colm|last2 = O'Dushlaine|first3 = Kimberly|last3 = Chambert|first4 = Jennifer L.|last4 = Moran|first5 = Anna K.|last5 = Kähler|first6 = Susanne|last6 = Akterin|first7 = Sarah E.|last7 = Bergen|first8 = Ann L.|last8 = Collins|first9 = James J.|last9 = Crowley}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studying the impact of these candidates would ideally demonstrate a schizophrenia phenotype in animal models, which is usually difficult to observe due to its manifestation as a latent personality. This approach is able to determine the molecular impact the [[candidate gene]]. Ideally the candidate genes would have a neurological impact, which in turn would suggest that it plays a role in the neurological disorder. For example, in the aforementioned schizophrenia GWAS study, Ripke and colleagues&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; determined that these candidate genes were all involved in calcium signalling. Alternatively, one can study these variants in model organisms in the context of affected neurological function. It is important to note that the [[High-penetrance|high penetrance]] variants of these disorders tend to be ''de novo'' mutations.

A further complication to studying neurogenomic disorders is the heterogeneous nature of the disorder. In many of these disorders, the mutations observed from case to case do not stay consistent. In autism, an affected individual may experience a large amount of deleterious mutations in gene X. A different affected individual may not have any significant mutations on gene X but have a large amount of mutations in gene Y. The alternative is to determine if gene X and gene Y impact the same biochemical pathway—one that influences a neurological function. A bioinformatics network analysis is one approach to this problem. Network analyses methodologies provide a generalized, systems overview of a molecular pathway.

One final complication to consider is the comorbidity of neurogenomic genes. Several disorders, especially at the more severe ends of the spectrum tend to be comorbid with each other. For example, more severe cases of [[Autism spectrum|ASD]] tend to be associated with [[intellectual disability]] (ID). This raises the question of whether or not there are true, unique ASD genes and unique ID genes or if there are just genes just associated with neurological function that can be mutated into an abnormal phenotype. One confounding factor may be the actual diagnostic category and methods of the spectrum disorders as symptoms between severe disorders may be similar. One study investigated the comorbid symptoms between groups of ID and ASD, and found no significant difference between the symptoms of ID children, ASD children with ID and ASD children without ID. Future research may help establish a more stringent genetic basis for the diagnoses of these disorders.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; the general steps for network analysis remain the same. 
* The analytical process starts out with the identification of a biological network based on experimental validation. This can be a [[gene co-expression network]], or a [[Protein–protein interaction|protein-protein interaction]] (PPI) network. The nodes of the network will be clustered.
* Subsequently, a specific list of genes with known associations to a particular phenotype of interest is generated. This list could be determined by experimental data, agnostic of genetic studies in psychiatric disorders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This is referred to as a 'hit list'. 
* Genes that belong to the hit list as well as the biological network selected in the first step are marked as such.  
* This is followed by a guilt-by-association (GBA) step. This means that clusters within the biological network that have a significant amount of genes from the hit list are investigated further using functional enrichment tools and database querying for the pathways in which these high scoring cluster genes participate &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

* Thus the biological associations of the high-scoring, experimentally implicated cluster members are investigated, expanding the search area from beyond the initial hit list to include gene members of additional pathways that may have significant association with the initial biological network under consideration. This results in a set of candidate genes.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The underlying principle of this approach is that the genes that cluster together, will also jointly affect the same molecular pathway. Again, they would ideally be part of a neurological function. The candidate genes can then be used to prioritize variants for wet lab validation.

== Neuropharmacology ==
Historically, due to the behavioural stimulation manifested as a symptom in several the neurogenomic disorders, the therapies would rely mostly on [[Antipsychotic|anti-psychotics]] or antidepressents. These classes of medications would suppress common symptoms of the disorders, but with questionable efficacy. The biggest barrier to neruopharmacogenomic research was the cohort sizes. Given newly available large-cohort sequencing data, there has been a recent push to expand therapeutic options. The heterogenous nature of neurological diseases is the key motivation for personalized medicine approaches to their therapies. It is rare to find single high penetrance causative genes in neurological diseases. The genomic profiles understandably vary between cases, and logically, the therapies would need to vary between cases. Further complicating the issue is that many of these disorders are spectrum disorders. Their genetic etiology will vary within this spectrum. For example, severe ASD is associated with high penetrance de novo mutations. Milder forms of ASD is usually associated with a mixture of common variants.

The key issue then is the translation of these newly identified genetic variants (from [[Copy-number variation|Copy Number Variant]] studies, candidate gene sequencing and high throughput sequencing technologies) into an intervention for patients with neurogenomic disorders. One aspect will be if the neurological disorder are medically actionable (i.e. is there a simple metabolic pathway that a therapy can target). For example, specific cases of [[Autism spectrum|ASD]] have been associated with microdeletions on [[TMLHE]] gene. This gene codes for the enzyme of [[carnitine biosynthesis]]. Supplements to elevate carnitine levels appeared to alleviate certain ASD symptoms but the study was confounded by many influencing factors. As mentioned earlier, using a gene network approach will help identify relevant pathways of interest. Many neuropharmacogenomic approaches have focused on targeting the downstream products of these pathways.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Pharmacogenomics and Personalized Medicine in Neuropsychiatry|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S089662731200431X|journal = Neuron|date = 2012-06-07|pmc = 3407812|pmid = 22681682|pages = 773–776|volume = 74|issue = 5|doi = 10.1016/j.neuron.2012.05.004|first = Francis J.|last = McMahon|first2 = Thomas R.|last2 = Insel}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = From De Novo Mutations to Personalized Therapeutic Interventions in Autism|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1146/annurev-med-091113-024550|journal = Annual Review of Medicine|date = 2015-01-01|pmid = 25587659|pages = 487–507|volume = 66|issue = 1|doi = 10.1146/annurev-med-091113-024550|first = William M.|last = Brandler|first2 = Jonathan|last2 = Sebat}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Studies in animal models for several brain diseases has shown that the [[Blood–brain barrier|blood brain barrier]] (BBB) undergoes modification at many levels; for example, the surface glycoprotein composition can influence the types of HIV-1 strains transported by the BBB. The BBB has been found to be key in the onset of [[Alzheimer's disease|Alzheimer’s]] disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Mouse models of neurological disorders: a view from the blood-brain barrier|journal = Biochimica et Biophysica Acta|date = 2010-10-01|issn = 0006-3002|pmc = 2891624|pmid = 19879356|pages = 881–888|volume = 1802|issue = 10|doi = 10.1016/j.bbadis.2009.10.011|first = William A.|last = Banks}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is extremely difficult, however, to be able to study this in humans due to obvious restrictions with accessing the brain and retrieving biological specimens for sequencing or morphological analysis. Mice models of the BBB and models of disease states have served well in conceptualizing the BBB as a regulatory interface between disease and good health in the brain.

=== Personalized neurobiology ===
The heterogenous nature of neurological diseases is the key motivation for personalized medicine approaches to their therapies.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Genomic samples of individual patients could be used to identify predictive factors, or to better understand the specific prognosis of a neurogenomic disease, and use this information to guide treatment options.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; While there is a clear clinical utility to this approach, the adaptation of this approach is still nonexistent.

There are various issues prohibiting the application of personalized genomics to the assessment, diagnosis, and treatment of psychiatric disorders. 
* Firstly, the causative network biology of several spectrum disorders with neurogenomic underpinnings is not fully understood yet, in spite of extensive studies conducted with disorders like [[Autism spectrum|Autism Spectrum]]&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; and [[schizophrenia]].&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Thus, the analytical validity of standing hypotheses concerning the etiology of neurogenomic disorders has still not been fully established and is subject to debate and controversy.
* The clinical validity of genetic variants that have shown to be highly correlated with specific neurogenomic disorders is often a major cause of concern.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The interpretation of these test results, and subsequent decision making, are a complicated undertaking given the polygenic nature of many of these disorders. Complicating things further, it has been shown that pre-emptive intervention in major psychiatric disorders does not always reduce the risk for the disorder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such intervention might not even be available for at-risk offspring of affected adults, thereby limiting the 'medical actionability' of the data.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 
* Ethical concerns have also been raised regarding the safeguarding of personal genomic information, and how best to approach the burden of incidental findings and family risk assessment. 
** Consanguinity and in-breeding can lead to selective enrichment of rare, otherwise low penetrance genetic mutations attributed to various symptoms of neurogenomic disorders. Thus, the interpretation of family-specific genetic mutations and/or network-level disruptions in the onset of a rare psychiatric disorder requires careful consideration of the motivations of participants included in the study.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; 
** That said, these issues can be addressed by effective education and counseling, and collection of genomic data from patients with psychiatric disorders should not be disqualified solely on this basis. The data itself serves as a dynamic health resource and can significantly further our understanding of the genomic basis of several psychiatric disorders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3703">The '''Neyer d-optimal test''' is a sensitivity test.  It can be used to answer questions such as "How far can a carton of eggs fall, on average, before one breaks?" If these egg cartons are very expensive, the person running the test would like to minimize the number of cartons dropped, to keep the experiment cheaper and to perform it faster. The Neyer test allows the experimenter to choose the experiment that gives the most information. In this case, given the history of egg cartons which have already been dropped, and whether those cartons broke or not, the Neyer test says "you will learn the most if you drop the next egg carton from a height of 32.123 meters."

== Applications ==

The Neyer test is useful in any situation when you wish to determine the average amount of a given stimulus needed in order to trigger a response.  Examples:

* Material Toughness - how far does this type of bottle filled with detergent need to fall before it breaks?
* Drug Efficacy -  how much of this drug is enough to cure this diseases?
* Toxicology - what percentage of contaminated seed is enough to cause a bird of this species to die?
* Sensory Threshold - how strong does the light have to be for this photodetector to sense it?
* Damage Threshold - how loud does the sound have to be in order to damage this microphone ?

== History ==

The Neyer-d optimal test was described by Barry T. Neyer in 1994. This method has replaced the earlier [[Bruceton analysis]] or "Up and Down Test" that was devised by Dixon and Mood in 1948 to allow computation with pencil and paper. Samples are tested at various stimulus levels, and the results (response or no response) noted. The Neyer Test guides the experimenter to pick test levels that provide the maximum amount of information. Unlike previous methods that have been developed, this method requires the use of a computer program to calculate the test levels.

Although not directly related to the test method, the [[Likelihood-ratio test|likelihood ratio analysis]] method is often used to analyze the results of tests conducted with the Neyer D-Optimal test. The combined test and analysis methods are commonly known as the Neyer Test.

Dror and Steinberg (2008) suggest another [[experimental design]] method which is more efficient than Neyer's, by enabling the usage of a [[D-optimal design]] criterion from the outset of the experiment. Furthermore, their method is extended to deal with situations which are not handled by previous algorithms, including extension from fully sequential designs (updating the plan after each observation) to group-sequential designs (any partition of the experiment to blocks of numerous observations), from a binary response ("success" or "failure") to any generalized linear model, and from the univariate case to the treatment of multiple predictors (such as designing an experiment to test a response in a medical treatment where the experimenters changes doses of two different drugs).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4111">The [[List of Latin phrases|Latin phrase]] '''''odium theologicum''''' (literally "theological hatred") is the name originally given to the often intense anger and [[hatred]] generated by disputes over [[theology]]. It has also been adopted to describe non-theological disputes of a rancorous nature.

[[John Stuart Mill]], discussing the fallibility of the moral consensus in his essay "On Liberty" (1859) refers scornfully to the ''odium theologicum'', saying that, in a sincere bigot, it is one of the most unequivocal cases of moral feeling. In this essay, he takes issue with those who rely on moral feeling rather than reasoned argument to justify their beliefs.

== Academic disputes ==
The early linguist [[Leonard Bloomfield]] believed it necessary to develop linguistics as a cumulative, non-personal discipline; as a "genuine" science. In a talk in 1946, speaking of the development of the American Linguistics Society, he stated the fostering of such a discipline had saved it "from the blight of the ''odium theologicum'' and the postulation of schools . . . denouncing all persons who disagree or who choose to talk about something else," and he added "The struggle with recalcitrant facts, unyielding in their complexity, trains everyone who works actively in science to be humble, and accustoms him to impersonal acknowledgement of error."

Philosopher and historian of science [[Thomas Samuel Kuhn]] argued that scientists are strongly committed to their beliefs, theories and methods (the collection of which he termed "[[paradigm]]s"), and that science progresses mainly by [[paradigm shift]]s. He claimed that scientists with conflicting paradigms will hold to them as dearly as theologians hold to their theological paradigms.  Philosopher of math and science [[Imre Lakatos]], a student of [[Karl Popper]], described the nature of science in a similar manner.  

According to Lakatos, science progresses by continual modification or else supersession of what he termed "research programs" (roughly equivalent to Kuhn's "paradigms").  Lakatos claimed that a research program is informed by [[metaphysics|metaphysical]] beliefs as well as observation of facts, and may infinitely resist [[falsifiability|falsification]] if a scientist wishes to continue holding it in spite of problems or the discovery of new evidence.  If this view is correct, science does not remedy ''odium theologicum'', it provides another field in which it may manifest.  

In the controversy over the validity of [[Method of Fluxions|fluxions]] the philosopher [[George Berkeley]] addressed his Newtonian opponent:
:You reproach me with "Calumny, detraction, and artifice". You recommend such means as are "innocent and just, rather than the criminal method of lessening or detracting from my opponents". You accuse me of the ''odium Theologicum'', the intemperate Zeal of Divines. . .&lt;ref&gt;''Defence of Free-Thinking in Mathematics'', 1735&lt;/ref&gt;

Whatever view of science and the [[sociology of scientific knowledge]] is correct, it is a fact that in the history of science there have been many instances of new theories (e.g., [[germ theory of disease]], finitude of the [[speed of light]], [[radioactivity]]) being ridiculed and shunned by the greater scientific community when first proposed or discovered, only later to be adopted as more probably accurate.

'''Parametric Stereo''' (PS) is lossy audio compression algorithm and a feature and an Audio Object Type (AOT) defined and used in [[MPEG-4 Part 3]] (MPEG-4 Audio) to further enhance efficiency in low bandwidth stereo media. [[Advanced Audio Coding]] Low Complexity (AAC LC) combined with [[Spectral band replication|Spectral Band Replication]] (SBR) and Parametric Stereo (PS) was defined as '''[[HE-AAC]] v2'''. An HE-AAC v1 decoder will only give mono sound when decoding an HE-AAC v2 bitstream. Parametric Stereo performs sparse coding in the spatial domain, somewhat similar to what SBR does in the frequency domain.
==AAC HE v2==
An AAC HE v2 bitstream is obtained by downmixing the stereo audio to mono at the encoder along with 2-3 kbit/s of side info (the Parametric Stereo information) in order to describe the spatial intensity stereo generation and ambience regeneration at the decoder.  By having the Parametric Stereo side info along with the mono audio stream, the decoder (player) can regenerate a faithful spatial approximation of the original stereo panorama at very low bitrates.

==One channel==
Because only one audio channel is transmitted, along with the parametric side info, a 24 kbit/s coded audio signal with Parametric Stereo will be substantially improved in quality, compared to a discretely stereo coded audio signal coded with conventional means. Thus, the additional bitrate spent on the single mono channel (combined with some PS side info) will improve the perceived quality substantially of the audio compared to a standard stereo stream at similar bitrate.
==Constraints==
However, this technique is only useful at the lowest bitrates (approx. 16 - 48 kbit/s) to give a good stereo impression, so while it can improve perceived quality at very low bitrates, it generally does not achieve [[Transparency (data compression)|transparency]], since simulating the stereo dynamics of the audio with the technique is limited and generally deteriorates perceived quality regardless of the bitrate.

'''Photofermentation''' is the [[Fermentative hydrogen production|fermentative]] conversion of organic substrate to [[biohydrogen]] manifested by a diverse group of [[photosynthesis|photosynthetic]] [[bacteria]] by a series of [[biochemical]] reactions involving three steps similar to [[Anaerobic digestion|anaerobic conversion]]. Photofermentation differs from [[dark fermentation]] because it only proceeds in the presence of [[light]].

[[File:Bioreactor principle.svg|thumb|Basic principles of a bioreactor. The photofermentation bioreactor would not include an air pathway.]]

=== Mechanism ===
The bacteria and their energy source are held in a [[bioreactor]] chamber that is impermeable to air and oxygen free.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The proper temperature for the bacterial species is maintained in the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The bacteria are sustained with a carbohydrate diet consisting of simple [[Carbohydrate|saccharide]] molecules.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Zhang Q, Wang Y, Zhang Z, Lee DJ, Zhou X, Jing Y, Ge X, Jiang D, Hu J, He C | title = Photo-fermentative hydrogen production from crop residue: A mini review | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 229 | pages = 222–230 | date = April 2017 | pmid = 28108074 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2017.01.008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The carbohydrates are typically sourced from agricultural or forestry waste.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Variations ===
[[File:Green_algae_in_a_bioreactor.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Green_algae_in_a_bioreactor.jpg|thumb|Depiction of algae (species not specified) in a bioreactor suitable for bioethanol production.]]
In addition to wild type forms of ''[[Rhodopseudomonas palustris]], s''cientists have used [[Genetically modified organism|genetically modified]] forms to produce hydrogen as well.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Other explorations include expanding the bioreactor system to hold a combination of bacteria, [[algae]] or [[cyanobacteria]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Ethanol production is performed by the algae [[Chlamydomonas reinhardtii|''Chlamydomonas reinhardtii'']], among other species, in cycling light and dark environments.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The cycling of light and dark environments has also been explored with bacteria for hydrogen production, increasing hydrogen yield.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| vauthors = Chen CY, Yang MH, Yeh KL, Liu CH, Chang JS |date= September 2008 |title=Biohydrogen production using sequential two-stage dark and photo fermentation processes |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|volume=33|issue=18|pages=4755–4762|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.06.055 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Advantages ===
The bacteria are typically fed with broken down agricultural waste or undesired crops, such as water lettuce or sugar beet molasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Keskin T, Hallenbeck PC | title = Hydrogen production from sugar industry wastes using single-stage photofermentation | journal = Bioresource Technology | volume = 112 | pages = 131–6 | date = May 2012 | pmid = 22420990 | doi = 10.1016/j.biortech.2012.02.077 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; The high abundance of such waste ensures the stable food source for the bacteria and productively uses human-produced waste.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In comparison with [[dark fermentation]], photofermentation produces more hydrogen per reaction and avoids the acidic end products of dark fermentation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Chandrasekhar K, Lee YJ, Lee DW | title = Biohydrogen production: strategies to improve process efficiency through microbial routes | journal = International Journal of Molecular Sciences | volume = 16 | issue = 4 | pages = 8266–93 | date = April 2015 | pmid = 25874756 | pmc = 4425080 | doi = 10.3390/ijms16048266 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Limitations ===
The primary limitations of photofermentation as a sustainable energy source stem from the precise requirements of maintaining the bacteria in the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Researchers have found it difficult to maintain a constant temperature for the bacteria within the bioreactor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Furthermore, the growth media for the bacteria must be rotated and refreshed without introducing air to the bioreactor system, complicating the already expensive bioreactor set up.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A '''pioneer''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|p|aɪ|.|ə|ˈ|n|ɪər}}) is a soldier employed to perform [[engineering]] and [[construction]] tasks. The term is in principle similar to [[sapper]].

Pioneers were originally part of the [[artillery]] branch of European armies. Subsequently, they formed part of the [[military engineering|engineering]] branch, the [[military logistics|logistic]] branch, part of the infantry; or even comprised a branch in their own right.

Historically, the primary role of pioneer units was to assist other arms in tasks such as the construction of [[trench warfare#Field works|field fortifications]], [[military camp]]s, bridges and roads.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/~rmallett/Pioneers.html] Pioneers  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807045133/http://www.unsw.adfa.edu.au/~rmallett/Pioneers.html|date=August 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to and during the [[First World War]], pioneers were often engaged in the construction and repair of [[military railway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Dooley, p.170.&lt;/ref&gt; During [[World War II]], pioneer units were used extensively by all major forces, both on the front line and in supporting roles.

During the 20th century, [[British Commonwealth]] military forces came to distinguish between small units of "[[assault pioneer]]s" belonging to infantry regiments and separate pioneer units (as in the former [[Royal Pioneer Corps]]). The [[United States Marine Corps]] has sometimes organized its sappers into "Pioneer Battalions".&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p.160.&lt;/ref&gt; The arrival of the [[Military engineering vehicle]] and the deployment of [[Weapon of mass destruction|weapons of mass destruction]] vastly expanded capabilities and complicated mission-profiles of modern pioneer units.

==Origin of the term==
The word pioneer is originally from France. The word ({{lang-fr|pionnier}}) was borrowed into English, from Old French ''pionnier'', which meant a "foot soldier", from the root 'peon'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=pioneer |title=Online Etymology Dictionary |work=etymonline.com |year=2013 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; recorded in 1523.&lt;ref&gt;Which is in turn derived from pedn-, from [[Late Latin]], "one who has broad feet"&lt;/ref&gt; It was used in a military sense as early as 1626–1627.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.littlewoodham.org.uk/research/ord.htm English Ordnance 1626 to 1643]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100825043348/http://www.littlewoodham.org.uk/research/ord.htm |date=August 25, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 18th century, Captain George Smith defined the term as:
{{quote|PIONEERS, in war-time, are such as are commanded in from the country, to march with an army, for mending the ways, for working on entrenchments, fortifications, and for making mines and approaches: the soldiers are likewise employed in all these things. Most of the foreign regiments of artillery have half a company of pioneers, well instructed in that important branch of duty. Our regiments of infantry and cavalry have 3 or 4 pioneers each, provided with aprons, hatchets, saws, spades, and pick-axes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=George |last=Smith |title=An Universal Military Dictionary, or A copious explanation of the technical terms &amp;c. used in the equipment, machinery movements and military operations of an army |location=Whitehall, London |publisher=J. Millan |date=1779}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
==Pioneer regiments in the Indian Army==
:''For Indian Army Pioneer Corps, see also [[Indian Army Pioneer Corps]]''
Extensive use was made of pioneers in the British Indian Army because of the demands of campaigning in difficult terrain with little or no [[infrastructure]]. In 1780, two companies of pioneers were raised in Madras, increasing to 16 in 1803 divided into two battalions. Bombay and Bengal pioneers were formed during the same period. In the late nineteenth century, a number of existing Indian infantry regiments took the title and the construction role of pioneers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|first=W.Y. |last=Carman |title=Indian Army Uniforms under the British: Artillery, Engineers and Infantry| publisher=Morgan-Grampian |location=London |year=1969}}&lt;/ref&gt; The twelve Indian Pioneer regiments in existence in 1914 were trained and equipped for road, rail and [[engineer]]ing work, as well as for conventional infantry service. While this dual function did not qualify them to be regarded as elite units, the frequency with which they saw active service made postings to pioneer regiments popular with British officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Gaylor |title=Sons of John Company – the Indian and Pakistan Armies 1903–1991 |publisher=Spellmount |year=1992 |isbn= 0-946771-98-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to World War I, each [[sepoy]] in a Pioneer regiment carried a pickaxe or a light spade in special leather equipment as well as a rifle and bayonet. NCOs and buglers carried axes, saws and billhooks. Heavier equipment, such as explosives, was carried by mule. The unit was therefore well equipped for simple field engineering tasks, as well as being able to defend itself in hostile territory. During the War, the increased specialisation required of Pioneers made them too valuable to use as regular assault infantry. Accordingly, in 1929, the Pioneer regiments were taken out of the line infantry and grouped into the Corps of Madras Pioneers (four battalions), the Corps of Bombay Pioneers (four battalions), the Corps of Sikhs Pioneers (four battalions), and the Corps of Hazara Pioneers (one battalion).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=Ian |last=Summer |title=The Indian Army 1914–1947 |location=Oxford |publisher=Osprey |year=2001 |pages=46–47 |isbn=1-84176-196-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All four Pioneer Corps were disbanded in 1933 and their personnel mostly transferred into the Corps of Sappers and Miners, whose role they had come to parallel. It was concluded that the Pioneer battalions had become less technically effective than the Sappers and Miners, but too well trained in specialist functions to warrant being used as ordinary infantry. In addition, their major role of frontier road building had now been allocated to civilian workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |first=John |last=Gaylor |title=Sons of John Company – the Indian and Pakistan Armies 1903–1991 |publisher=Spellmount |year=1992 |page=17|isbn= 0-946771-98-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An Indian Pioneer Corps was re-established in 1943.

==Pioneers in the British Army==
Historically, British infantry regiments maintained small units of pioneers for heavy work and engineering, especially for clearing paths through forests and for leading assaults on fortifications. These units evolved into [[assault pioneer]]s. They also inspired the creation of the Royal Pioneer Corps.

During World War I, [[Table of organization and equipment|on paper]] at least, each division was allocated a pioneer infantry battalion, who in addition to being trained infantry were able to conduct pioneer duties. These pioneer battalions were raised and numbered within the existing infantry regiments; where possible recruits were men who possessed [[transferable skill]]s from civilian life.

The ''[[Royal Pioneer Corps]]'' was a [[British Army]] combatant corps used for light engineering tasks. The Royal Pioneer Corps was raised on 17 October 1939 as the Auxiliary Military Pioneer Corps. It was renamed the Pioneer Corps on 22 November 1940. It was renamed the Royal Pioneer Corps on 28 November 1946. On 5 April 1993, the Royal Pioneer Corps united with other units to form the [[Royal Logistics Corps]].

The specialist pioneer units in the Royal Logistics Corps, [[23 Pioneer Regiment]], based at [[MoD Bicester|St David's Barracks]] at [[Bicester]], and [[168 Pioneer Regiment]], headquartered in [[Prince William of Gloucester Barracks]] at [[Grantham]], were disbanded in 2014, as part of the [[Future of the British Army (Army 2020)|Army 2020]] re-organisation.

The [[Allied Rapid Reaction Corps|ARRC Support Battalion]] is based at [[Imjin Barracks]], [[Innsworth]] (until June 2010, it was at [[Rheindahlen Military Complex]], [[Germany]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arrc.nato.int/alliedrapidreactioncorps/page1120041.aspx |title=Allied Rapid Reaction Corps &amp;#124; HQ ARRC bids farewell to Germany |work=arrc.nato.int |date=18 June 2012 |accessdate=16 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All British infantry regiments still maintain [[assault pioneer]] units. The Pioneer Sergeant is the only rank allowed to wear a beard on parade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The only Army  Rank allowed to have a beard on parade|url=http://forces.tv/42849745|website=Forces Home page|accessdate=30 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Israeli Army==
The Israeli army has an infantry brigade called the ''[[Nahal|Fighting Pioneer Youth]]'', in Hebrew ''Noar Halutzi Lohem'' or just ''"Nahal"''. The title of Israeli military pioneers is a back-derivation from the civilian term. The Israeli army's pioneers were formed in 1948 from Jewish civilian pioneers, i.e. settlers, who were permitted to combine military service and farming.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22222">In [[financial regulation]], "'''politically exposed person'''" ('''PEP''') is a term describing someone who has been entrusted with a prominent public function. A PEP generally presents a higher risk for potential involvement in [[bribery]] and [[corruption]] by virtue of their position and the influence that they may hold. The terms politically exposed person and '''senior foreign political figure''' are often used interchangeably, particularly in international forums.  [[Foreign official]] is a term for individuals deemed as government persons under the [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]] or FCPA, and although definitions are similar to PEP, there are quite a few differences and should not be used interchangeably.  The term PEP is typically used referring to customers in the financial services industry, while 'foreign official' refers to the risks of third party relationships in all industries.

==Definition by the Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering==
While there is no global definition of a PEP, most countries have based their definition on the 2003 [[Financial Action Task Force on Money Laundering]] (FATF) standard, as for example the [[Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority|Swiss financial market regulator]] in 2011, which quoted it as "the international standard"&lt;ref name="FINMA Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Due diligence obligations of Swiss banks when handling assets of "politically exposed persons".|url=http://www.finma.ch/e/aktuell/Documents/bericht_pep-abkl%C3%A4rung_20111110_e.pdf|date=10 November 2011|publisher=Eidgenoessische Finanzmarktaufsicht (FINMA)}}&lt;/ref&gt; or the Australian government in 2015.&lt;ref name="Austrac Definition"&gt;{{cite web|title=Draft guidance note 15/01. Key terms used in 'politically exposed person' definition.|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/sites/default/files/draft-gn1501-pep.docx|date=January 2015|publisher=Australian government|author=Australian Transaction reports and Analysis Center(Austrac)|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
FATF is an international inter-governmental body, founded in 1989 on the initiative of the [[G7]] and hosted by the [[OECD]], to set standards and promote implementing measures against [[money laundering]], [[financing of terrorism]] and financing of proliferation of [[weapons of mass destruction]] to preserve the integrity of the [[global financial system]].&lt;ref name="FATF"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/pdfs/FATF_Recommendations.pdf|title=INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS ON COMBATING MONEY LAUNDERING AND THE FINANCING OF TERRORISM &amp; PROLIFERATION|author=FATF|publisher=ATF/OECD|date=15 February 2012|pages=130}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|2}}

In February 2012, the FATF's latest definition of politically exposed persons (PEP), revised from 2003, is as follows:&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|123}} 
*''Foreign PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted with prominent public functions by a foreign country, for example [[Head of state|Heads of state]] or [[Head of government|Heads of government]], senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. 
*''Domestic PEPs'': individuals who are or have been entrusted domestically with prominent public functions, for example Heads of State or of government, senior politicians, senior government, judicial or military officials, senior executives of state owned corporations, important political party officials. (Not all countries subscribe to the concept of domestic PEPs with respect to regulatory requirements/application of due diligence. For example, US law, specifically Section 312 of the USA Patriot Act and its implementing regulations provide for enhanced due diligence for SFPFs (Senior Foreign Political Figure) only, defined as: "a current or former senior official in the executive, legislative, administrative, military, or judicial branches of a 'foreign' government...a senior official of a major 'foreign' political party; and a senior executive of a 'foreign' government-owned commercial enterprise.)
*Persons who are or have been entrusted with a prominent function by a [[state owned enterprise]] or an [[international organisation]] refers to members of [[senior management]], i.e. directors, deputy directors and members of the board or equivalent functions.

Requirements for a PEP apply to [[family member]]s or close associates, any individual publicly known, or known by the financial institution to be a close personal or professional associate.&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|18}}
"The FATF definition is not intended to include middle-ranking or more junior individuals."&lt;ref name="FATF"/&gt;{{rp|121}}

A forerunner definition was by the 1997 [[OECD Anti-Bribery Convention]] aimed at reducing corruption in developing countries, which came into force February 1999; it used the term 'foreign official'.

Most of the 37 FATF member countries treat domestic and foreign PEPs with heightened [[scrutiny]].  
The FATF guidance implies that if a person is a foreign PEP, it ''de facto'' makes them a domestic PEP in their own country. This makes sense for crime prevention, because to export proceeds of crime, the PEP must first use their own domestic financial system and thus, importance is placed on domestic, and non-foreign PEPs.&lt;ref name="Ukraine Crisis"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=The $70 Billion Missing From the Ukraine: Does it Demonstrate a Whopping Failure of Global Anti-Money Laundering and Corruption Laws?

===Australia===
Under Australia's AML/CTF Rules,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.austrac.gov.au/businesses/legislation/amlctf-act|title=AML/CTF Act|first=Australian Transaction Reports and Analysis Centre|last=(AUSTRAC)|date=30 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Politically exposed persons (PEPs) are individuals who occupy a prominent public position or functions in a government body or international organisation, both within and outside Australia. This definition also extends to their immediate family members and close associates.

The AML/CTF Rules define three categories of PEPs:

* Domestic PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an Australian government body
* Foreign PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in a government body of a foreign country.
* International organisation PEPs are individuals who hold a prominent public position or function in an international organisation.

A reporting entity must have procedures to identify whether any individual customer or beneficial owner is a PEP, or an associate of a PEP. The reporting entity must undertake this identification process before it provides the customer with a designated service, or as soon as practicable afterwards. A reporting entity must implement additional due diligence measures and risk management systems where the PEP is high ML/TF risk or is a foreign PEP.

===Canada===
Canada considers all foreign PEPs to pose a money laundering and terrorist financing risk.&lt;ref name="Politically Exposed Persons"&gt;{{cite web |last=Duhaime |first=Christine |title=Politically Exposed Persons, Duhaime's Financial Guide and Anti-Money Laundering Law.|url=http://www.antimoneylaunderinglaw.com/aml-law-in-canada/politically-exposed-person|publisher=Duhaime Law|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the amendments to the Proceeds of Crime (Money Laundering) and Terrorist Financing Act that came into effect in 2016, a politically exposed person now also includes all domestic PEPs and Heads of International Organisations (HIOs). &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://complyadvantage.com/pep-screening-and-monitoring-in-canada/|title=PEP Screening &amp; Monitoring in Canada|last=|first=|date=7 June 2017|website=ComplyAdvantage|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chile===
{{See also|Banco de Chile#Controversies{{!}}Banco de Chile}}

In Chile, financial institutions are mandated to report any transaction suspicious for potential involvement in bribery by virtue of a PEP's position and the influence that they may hold. {{As of| 2015}}, 2,200 to 3,000 individuals are considered PEPs, 150 of them foreign, and also their second grade relatives are under financial observation by the institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Chilean newspaper ''[[La Tercera]]'' 22 February 2015, [http://www.latercera.com/noticia/negocios/2015/02/655-617858-9-pep-asi-opera-la-vigilancia-financiera-a-la-clase-politica.shtml PEP: así opera la vigilancia financiera a la clase política] Fernando Vega, retrieved on 22 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In South Africa, the Financial Intelligence Centre amended the Financial Intelligence Centre Act to refer to Politically Influential Persons (PIP) instead of PEP. This was done in order to include private sector officials who have business dealings with public sector officials and elected officials in the public services procurement deals.

===UK===
{{As of |January 2015}} likewise the UK's PEP definition is identical to the 2003 FATF definition, i.e. without the 2012 update to include domestic PEPs; It is found in the Money Laundering Regulations 2007 Section 14(5)&lt;ref name=uk&gt;{{cite web|title=The Money Laundering Regulations 2007|url=http://www.legislation.gov.uk/uksi/2007/2157/regulation/14/made|work=No. 2157 PART 2 Enhanced customer due diligence and ongoing monitoring, Regulation 14|publisher=legislation.gov.uk|accessdate=14 May 2014|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; A politically exposed person is considered any individual who fits any of the criteria listed below:

* A foreign person who has held any time in the preceding year a prominent public function outside the United Kingdom, in a state or international institution
* Members of courts of auditors or of the boards of central banks
* Ambassadors, chargés d’affaires and high-ranking officers in the armed forces
* Members of the administrative, management or supervisory bodies of state-owned enterprises
* Heads of state, heads of government, ministers and deputy or assistant ministers
* Members of parliaments
* Members of supreme courts, constitutional courts or of other high-level judicial bodies
The definition explicitly excludes middle-ranking or more junior officials.

PEP status also extends to relatives and close associates. Relatives and close associates include a spouse, a partner, children and their spouses or partners and parents. Close associates include any individual who is known to have joint beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement, or any other close business relations. It also includes any individual who has sole beneficial ownership of a legal entity or legal arrangement which is known to have been set up for the benefit of a person referred to in regulation.

The [[Financial Conduct Authority]] and Joint Money Laundering Steering Group both publish comprehensive guidance on both PEPs and other KYC related matters to assist firms in complying with their legal obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.the-fca.org.uk/money-laundering-and-terrorist-financing|title=FCA Information on Money Laundering &amp; Terrorist Financing|publisher=}}{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 4th EU AML Directive is expected update the definition to include domestic PEPs, and limit relatives-status to spouse and partner only, and no longer the children and parents of PEPs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AMLD4 and Domestic PEPS

|url=http://www.lkshields.ie/publications/the-fourth-anti-money-laundering-directive|publisher=LK Shields}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
The term [[foreign official]] has been used by US enforcement agencies relating to persons who have similar characteristics as PEPs, as referenced in the US [[Foreign Corrupt Practices Act]].{{UnitedStatesCode|15|78dd-1}} It is used in all industries, not only by financial institutions. The [[United States Department of the Treasury|Treasury]]'s [[Financial Crimes Enforcement Network]] (FinCEN) did not use the term PEP in its regulations as of 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fincen.gov/news_room/testimony/pdf/20100204.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Suspicious activity requires a financial institution to submit a [[suspicious activity report]] to FinCEN. The term 'Senior Foreign Political Figure', as defined by section 312 of the [[USA PATRIOT Act]] is to a great extent similar to the definition of PEP, and also excludes middle-ranking or more junior individuals.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} The term PEP is recognized (and was defined) by the 'Wolfsberg Group' of eleven global banks.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wolfsberg-principles.com/pdf/faq/Wolfsberg_PEP_FAQs_(2008).pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The designation "politically exposed person" dates back to the late 1990s, in what was known as the "Abacha Affair." [[Sani Abacha]] was a Nigerian dictator who organized a large scale, systematic theft of assets from the Nigerian central bank for some years with his family members and associates. It is believed that several billion dollars were stolen, and that the funds were transferred to bank accounts in the [[United Kingdom]] and [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name="senat.fr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.senat.fr/ue/pac/E2734.html|date=30 June 2004|title=Proposition de directive du Parlement européen et du Conseil relative à la prévention de l'utilisation du système financier aux fins du blanchiment de capitaux, y compris le financement du terrorisme|language=French|author=French Senate,Justice et affaires intérieures|publisher=French Government}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, the Nigerian Government that succeeded the Abacha Regime made an effort to recover the money.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/200108080222.html|title=Nigeria: Abacha Loot: Swiss Govt to Dock 60 Bankers, Lawyers|first=Chidi|last='Uzor|date=8 August 2001|publisher=|via=AllAfrica}}&lt;/ref&gt; It lodged complaints with several European agencies, including the [[Federal Office of Police]] of [[Switzerland]] which investigated close to sixty Swiss banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.admin.ch/message/index.html?lang=en&amp;msg-id=22828|title=Switzerland provides mutual legal assistance in the Abacha case - To date, USD 645 million have been frozen in Switzerland|author=|date=21 January 2000|publisher=Federal Office of Justice Switzerland}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this investigation, the concept of "politically exposed person" emerged, around which the UN organised a committee in December 2000, that eventually led to the October 2003 resolution of [[United Nations Convention against Corruption]], entered into force in December 2005, with ongoing annual reviews of implementation and asset recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Convention against Corruption|url=http://www.unodc.org/unodc/en/treaties/CAC/index.html#UNCACfulltext|publisher=UN office of drugs and crime (UNODC)|accessdate=12 February 2015|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had become [[European Union law]] in 2004.&lt;ref name="senat.fr"/&gt;

PEP-specific compliance legislation addresses the link between [[government corruption]], [[money laundering]] and [[terrorism financing]].&lt;ref name="FATF Guidance"&gt;{{cite web|title=FATF Guidance on PEP Legislation.|url=http://www.fatf-gafi.org/media/fatf/documents/recommendations/Guidance-PEP-Rec12-22.pdf|publisher=FATF|date=June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since September 11, 2001, more than 100 countries have changed their laws related to financial services regulation, combating political corruption.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}

Heavy fines have been imposed on financial institutions for conducting business with PEPs without following adequate procedures, as in the case of [[Riggs Bank]].&lt;ref name="Riggs Bank"&gt;{{cite web|title=At Riggs Bank, A Tangled Path Led to Scandal.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/07/19/us/at-riggs-bank-a-tangled-path-led-to-scandal.html|publisher=New York Times|date=19 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In spite of regulation, political leaders like [[Muammar Gaddafi]] and [[Hosni Mubarak]] have made news in 2013 for having [[Toxic asset|frozen assets]] in US banks that did not follow [[due diligence]].&lt;ref name="Mubarak Asset Freeze"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frozen Mubarak assets worth around $1bn.|url=http://www.dailynewsegypt.com/2013/04/17/efsa-frozen-mubarak-assets-worth-around-1bn/|publisher=Daily News Egypt|date=17 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk screening and PEP datasets==
Most financial institutions view a PEP as a potential compliance risk, and perform enhanced monitoring of accounts that fall within this category. Screening for PEPs is usually performed at the beginning of account opening, called initial [[due diligence]] or [[know your customer]] (KYC). Screening of accounts periodically is performed as part of ongoing due diligence.

There are a number of companies advertising for regulatory, financial and reputational risk screening. 

Due diligence to uncover PEPs can be time consuming and requires the checking of names, dates of birth, national identification numbers and photos of clients against a reputable database of known PEPs, which usually contains over one million profiles.{{citation needed|date=May 2014}} No 'official' PEP list exist. The [[CIA]] and [[United Nations|UN]] have lists of [[heads of state]]s, which fall below the PEP definitions of FATF. 

Vendors maintain their own particular database of PEPs and other high-risk customers.  The world's largest PEP database of 1.6 million counterparts gives Accuity [4] part of RELX Group (formerly Reed Elsevier) [5] a strong market position.

Geneva based Polixis&lt;ref&gt;http://polixis.com/&lt;/ref&gt; is seen as a challenger solution since it offers an AI-driven database of PEPs with a peculiarity that the data can be linked to a much larger set of economic data through their ARDIS software.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.tdg.ch/geneve/geneve-bureau-polixis-robotise-controle-clients-fortunes-banques/story/19614383&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a number of crowd sourced lists of Politically Exposed Persons being made available utilizing public contributions. As of March 2016, Ukrainian activists has announced the launch of publicly available Register of Politically Exposed Persons – pep.org.ua, an exclusive public online database designed to help to withstand money laundering from state Ukrainian budget through international banks.

{{Postmodernism}}

'''Postmodern feminism''' is an approach to [[feminist theory]] that incorporates [[Postmodern philosophy|postmodern]] and [[Post-structuralism|post-structuralist theory]], seeing itself as moving beyond the [[modernist]] polarities of [[liberal feminism]] and [[radical feminism]].&lt;ref&gt;R. Appignanesi/C. Garratt, ''Postmodernism for Beginners'' (1995) p. 100-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminism has been seen as having an affinity to postmodern philosophy through a shared interest in [[speech act]]s.&lt;ref&gt;"The emphasis on ''practices'', which is one of the most radical powers of both postmodernism and feminism, throws renewed emphasis on speech acts and on the enacted, performative aspects of languages." E. D. Ermarth, ''Sequel to History'' (1992) p. 172-3.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Origins and theory ==

===Butler===
Postmodern feminism's major departure from other branches of feminism is perhaps the argument that [[sex]], or at least [[gender]] is itself [[social construction|constructed]] through [[discourse|language]], a view notably propounded in [[Judith Butler]]'s 1990 book, ''[[Gender Trouble]]''. She draws on and critiques the work of [[Simone de Beauvoir]], [[Michel Foucault]], and [[Jacques Lacan]], as well as on [[Luce Irigaray]]'s argument that what we conventionally regard as 'feminine' is only a reflection of what is constructed as masculine.&lt;ref&gt;G. Gutting ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Foucault'' (2002) p. 389&lt;/ref&gt;

Butler criticises the distinction drawn by previous feminisms between (biological) sex and (socially constructed) [[gender]]. She asks why we assume that material things (such as the body) are not subject to processes of social construction themselves. Butler argues that this does not allow for a sufficient criticism of [[essentialism]]: though recognizing that gender is a social construct, feminists assume it is always constructed in the same way. Her argument implies that [[women]]'s subordination has no single cause or single solution; postmodern feminism is thus criticized for offering no clear path to action.  Butler herself rejects the term "postmodernism" as too vague to be meaningful.&lt;ref&gt;Judith Butler, "Contingent Foundations" in Seyla Benhabib et al., ''Feminist Contentions: A Philosophical Exchange'' (New York: Routledge, 1995), pp. 35-58&lt;/ref&gt;

Paula Moya argues that Butler derives this rejection to postmodernism from misreadings of [[Cherríe Moraga]]'s work. "She reads Moraga's statement that 'the danger lies in ranking the oppressions' to mean that we have no way of adjudicating among different kinds of oppressions—that any attempt to casually relate or hierarchize the varieties of oppressions people suffer constitutes an imperializing, colonizing, or totalizing gesture that renders the effort invalid…thus, although Butler at first appears to have understood the critiques of women who have been historically precluded from occupying the position of the 'subject' of feminism, it becomes clear that their voices have been merely instrumental to her" (Moya, 790) Moya contends that because Butler feels that the varieties of oppressions cannot be summarily ranked, that they cannot be ranked at all; and takes a short-cut by throwing out the idea of not only postmodernism, but women in general.&lt;ref&gt;Moya, Paula M.L. ''From Postmodernism, 'Realism,' and the Politics of Identity: [[Cherríe Moraga]] and [[Chicana feminism|Chicana Feminism]]'' in {{cite book | last1 = Gilbert | first1 = Susan M. | last2 = Gubar | first2 = Susan Eds | title=Feminist literary theory and criticism : a Norton reader | year = 2007 | publisher = W.W. Norton | location = New York | isbn=9780393927900 | pages = 787–797 | edition = 1st | authorlink=From Postmodernism, "Realism," and the Politics of Identity: Cherrie Morage and Chicana Feminism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Frug===
Although [[postmodernism]] resists characterization, it is possible to identify certain themes or orientations that postmodern feminists share. [[Mary Joe Frug]] suggested that one "principle" of postmodernism is that human experience is located "inescapably within language".  Power is exercised not only through direct coercion, but also through the way in which language shapes and restricts our reality. However, because language is always open to re-interpretation, it can also be used to resist this shaping and restriction, and so is a potentially fruitful site of political struggle.

Frug's second postmodern principle is that sex is not something natural, nor is it something completely determinate and definable. Rather, sex is part of a system of meaning, produced by language. Frug argues that "cultural mechanisms ... encode the female body with meanings", and that these cultural mechanisms then go on explain these meanings "by an appeal to the 'natural' differences between the sexes, differences that the rules themselves help to produce".&lt;ref&gt;Mary Joe Frug, "A Postmodern Feminist Legal Manifesto (An Unfinished Draft)," ''Harvard Law Review'', Vol. 105, No. 5. (Mar., 1992), pp. 1045-1075, at p. 1049.&lt;/ref&gt; Rejecting the idea of a natural basis to sexual difference allows us to see that it is always susceptible to new interpretations. Like other systems of meaning, it is less like a cage, and more like a tool: it constrains but never completely determines what one can do with it.

===French feminism===
[[French feminism]] from the 1970s onwards has forged specific routes in postmodern feminism and in feminist [[psychoanalysis]], through such writers as [[Julia Kristeva]] and [[Hélène Cixous]].

Cixous argued for a new form of writing, writing with the body—a kind of writing rooted not in biology but in linguistic change.&lt;ref&gt;Ermath, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt;

Irigaray considered that "man would search, with nostalgia and repulsion, in woman for his own repressed and uncultivated natural pole"—something which would "prevent woman from truly being an other for him".&lt;ref&gt;Luce Irigaray, ''Sharing the World'' (2008) p. 33-4&lt;/ref&gt;

Kristeva argued that 'woman' does not exist, but is rather in a state of becoming.&lt;ref&gt;Appignanesi, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Toril Moi]] has stressed that issues of [[Difference (philosophy)|difference]] as well as of femininity are central to the concerns of all the above writers.&lt;ref&gt;J. Childers/G. Hentz eds., ''The Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'' (1995) p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bornstein===
[[Kate Bornstein]], transgender author and playwright, calls herself a [[postmodernism|postmodern feminist]].

== Critiques ==

Critics like [[Meaghan Morris]] have argued that postmodern feminism runs the risk of undercutting the basis of a politics of action based upon gender difference, through its very anti-essentialism.&lt;ref&gt;K. Schmidt, ''The Theatre of Transformation'' (2005) p. 129-30&lt;/ref&gt;

"One of the most appealing aspects of postmodernism to many feminists has been its focus on difference. The notion that women have been created and defined as 'other' by men has long been argued and explored by feminists, most notably Simone de Beauvoir. She challenged male definitions of woman and called on women to define themselves outside the male female dyad. Women, she urged, must be the subject rather than the object (other) of analysis."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parpart|first=Jane|title=Who Is the 'Other'?: A Postmodern Feminist Critique of Women and Development Theory and Practice|journal=Development and Change|date=22 October 2008|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feminist Moya Lloyd adds that a postmodernist feminism "does not necessarily represent a post-feminism, but alternatively, can affirm feminist politics in their plural, multivocal, fluid, oft-changing hue"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Parpart|first=Jane|title=Who is the 'Other'?: A Postmodern Feminist Critique of Women and Development Theory and Practice|journal=Development and Change|date=22 October 2008|volume=24|issue=3|pages=439–464|doi=10.1111/j.1467-7660.1993.tb00492.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Post-structuralism is defined in the Penguin Reference, Dictionary of Literary Terms &amp; Literary Theory, as "... a more rigorous working out of the possibilities, implications and shortcomings of structuralism and its basis to Saussurean linguistics itself... . Post-structuralism doubts the adequacy of structuralism and, as far as literature is concerned, tends to reveal that the meaning of any text is, of its nature, unstable. It reveals that signification is, of its nature, unstable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780140513639|pages=689–693|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Post-structuralism, pursues further the Saussurean perception that in language there are only differences without positive terms and shows that the signifier and signified are, as it were, not only oppositional, but plural, pulling against each other, and, by so doing, creating numerous deferments of meaning, apparently endless criss-crossing patterns in sequences of meaning. In short, what are called 'disseminations.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cuddon|first=J.A.|title=The Penguin dictionary of literary terms and literary theory|year=1998|publisher=Penguin Books|location=London [u.a.]|isbn=9780140513639|pages=689–693|edition=4.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gloria Steinem]] has [[Gloria Steinem#Feminist theory|criticized feminist theory]], and especially postmodernist feminist theory, as being overly academic, "I always wanted to put a sign up on the road to Yale saying, 'Beware: Deconstruction Ahead'. Academics are forced to write in language no one can understand so that they get tenure. They have to say 'discourse', not 'talk'. Knowledge that is not accessible is not helpful. It becomes aerialised."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16880">In [[statistical mechanics]], the '''Potts model''', a generalization of the [[Ising model]], is a model of interacting [[spin (physics)|spins]] on a [[crystalline lattice]]. By studying the Potts model, one may gain insight into the behaviour of [[ferromagnet]]s and certain other phenomena of [[solid-state physics]].  The strength of the Potts model is not so much that it models these physical systems well; it is rather that the one-dimensional case is [[exactly solvable]], and that it has a rich mathematical formulation that has been studied extensively.

The model is named after [[Renfrey Potts]], who described the model near the end of his 1951 Ph.D. thesis. The model was related to the "planar Potts" or "clock model", which was suggested to him by his advisor, [[Cyril Domb]]. The four-state planar Potts model is sometimes known as the '''Ashkin–Teller model''', after [[Julius Ashkin]] and [[Edward Teller]], who considered an equivalent model in 1943.

The Potts model is related to, and generalized by, several other models, including the [[XY model]], the [[Heisenberg model (classical)|Heisenberg model]] and the [[N-vector model]]. The infinite-range Potts model is known as the [[Kac model]]. When the spins are taken to interact in a [[non-abelian group|non-Abelian]] manner, the model is related to the [[flux tube model]], which is used to discuss [[Color confinement|confinement]] in [[quantum chromodynamics]]. Generalizations of the Potts model have also been used to model [[grain growth]] in metals and [[coarsening]] in [[foam]]s.  A further generalization of these methods by [[James Glazier]] and [[Francois Graner]], known as the [[cellular Potts model]], has been used to simulate static and kinetic phenomena in foam and biological [[morphogenesis]].

==Physical description==
The Potts model consists of ''spins'' that are placed on a [[lattice (group)|lattice]]; the lattice is usually taken to be a two-dimensional rectangular [[Euclidean space|Euclidean]] lattice, but is often generalized to other dimensions or other lattices. Domb originally suggested that the spin take one of ''q'' possible values, distributed uniformly about the [[circle]], at angles

:&lt;math&gt;\theta_n = \frac{2\pi n}{q},&lt;/math&gt;

where ''n'' = 1, ..., ''q'' and that the interaction [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] be given by

:&lt;math&gt;H_c = J_c\sum_{(i,j)} \cos \left( \theta_{s_i} - \theta_{s_j} \right)&lt;/math&gt;

with the sum running over the nearest neighbor pairs (''i'', ''j'') over all lattice sites.  The site ''colors'' ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' take on values in {1, ..., ''q''}. Here, ''J&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' is a coupling constant, determining the interaction strength. This model is now known as the '''vector Potts model''' or the '''clock model'''.  Potts provided the location in two dimensions of the phase transition, for ''q'' = 3 and 4. In the limit as ''q'' → ∞, this becomes the [[XY model]].

What is now known as the standard '''Potts model''' was suggested by Potts in the course of his study above, and uses a simpler Hamiltonian, given by:

:&lt;math&gt;H_p = -J_p \sum_{(i,j)}\delta(s_i,s_j) \,&lt;/math&gt;

where δ(''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''s&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'') is the [[Kronecker delta]], which equals one whenever ''s&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''s&lt;sub&gt;j&lt;/sub&gt;'' and zero otherwise.

The ''q''=2 standard Potts model is equivalent to the [[Ising model]] and the 2-state vector Potts model, with ''J&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = −2''J&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''. The ''q'' = 3 standard Potts model is equivalent to the three-state vector Potts model, with  ''J&lt;sub&gt;p&lt;/sub&gt;'' = −(3/2)''J&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''.

A common generalization is to introduce an external "magnetic field" term ''h'', and moving the parameters inside the sums and allowing them to vary across the model:

:&lt;math&gt;\beta H_g = - \beta \sum_{(i,j)}J_{ij} \delta(s_i,s_j) - \sum_i h_i s_i \,&lt;/math&gt;

where β = 1/''kT'' the ''[[inverse temperature]]'', ''k'' the [[Boltzmann constant]] and ''T'' the [[temperature]].  The summation may run over more distant neighbors on the lattice, or may in fact be an infinite-range force.

Different papers may adopt slightly different conventions, which can alter ''H'' and the associated [[Partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] by additive or multiplicative constants.

==Discussion==
Despite its simplicity as a model of a physical system, the Potts model is useful as a model system for the study of [[phase transition]]s. For example, two dimensional lattices with ''J'' &gt; 0 exhibit a first order transition if ''q'' &gt; 4. When ''q'' ≤ 4 a continuous transition is observed, as in the Ising model where ''q'' = 2. Further use is found through the model's relation to percolation problems and the Tutte and chromatic polynomials found in combinatorics.

The model has a close relation to the Fortuin-[[Pieter Kasteleyn|Kasteleyn]] [[random cluster model]], another model in [[statistical mechanics]]. Understanding this relationship has helped develop efficient [[Markov chain Monte Carlo]] methods  for numerical exploration of the model at small ''q''.

For integer values of ''q'', ''q'' ≥ 3, the model displays the phenomenon of 'interfacial adsorption' with intriguing critical [[wetting]] properties when fixing opposite boundaries in two different states.

==Measure theoretic description==
The one dimensional Potts model may be expressed in terms of a [[subshift of finite type]], and thus gains access to all of the mathematical techniques associated with this formalism.  In particular, it can be solved exactly using the techniques of [[transfer operator]]s.  (However, [[Ernst Ising]] used combinatorial methods to solve the [[Ising model]], which is the "ancestor" of the Potts model, in his 1924 PhD thesis). This section develops the mathematical formalism, based on [[measure theory]], behind this solution.

While the example below is developed for the one-dimensional case, many of the arguments, and almost all of the notation, generalizes easily to any number of dimensions. Some of the formalism is also broad enough to handle related models, such as the [[XY model]], the [[Heisenberg model (classical)|Heisenberg model]] and the [[N-vector model]].

===Topology of the space of states===
Let ''Q'' = {1, ..., ''q''} be a finite set of symbols, and let

:&lt;math&gt;Q^\mathbf{Z}=\{ s=(\ldots,s_{-1},s_0,s_1,\ldots) :  s_k \in Q \; \forall k \in \mathbf{Z} \}&lt;/math&gt;

be the set of all bi-infinite strings of values from the set ''Q''. This set is called a [[full shift]]. For defining the Potts model, either this whole space, or a certain subset of it, a [[subshift of finite type]], may be used. Shifts get this name because there exists a natural operator on this space, the [[shift operator]] τ : ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sup&gt; → ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sup&gt;, acting as

:&lt;math&gt;\tau (s)_k = s_{k+1}&lt;/math&gt;

This set has a natural [[product topology]]; the [[base (topology)|base]] for this topology are the [[cylinder set]]s

:&lt;math&gt;C_m[\xi_0, \ldots, \xi_k]= \{s \in Q^\mathbf{Z} : s_m = \xi_0, \ldots ,s_{m+k} = \xi_k \}&lt;/math&gt;

that is, the set of all possible strings where ''k''+1 spins match up exactly to a given, specific set of values ξ&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ξ&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;. Explicit representations for the cylinder sets can be gotten by noting that the string of values corresponds to a [[p-adic number|''q''-adic number]], and thus, intuitively, the product topology resembles that of the [[real number]] line.

===Interaction energy===
The interaction between the spins is then given by a [[continuous function (topology)|continuous function]] ''V'' : ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''' on this topology. ''Any'' continuous function will do; for example

:&lt;math&gt;V(s) = -J\delta(s_0,s_1)&lt;/math&gt;

will be seen to describe the interaction between nearest neighbors. Of course, different functions give different interactions; so a function of ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,  ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will describe a next-nearest neighbor interaction.  A function ''V'' gives interaction energy between a set of spins; it is ''not'' the Hamiltonian, but is used to build it. The argument to the function ''V'' is an element ''s'' ∈ ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sup&gt;, that is, an infinite string of spins. In the above example, the function ''V'' just picked out two spins out of the infinite string: the values ''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; and ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.  In general, the function ''V'' may depend on some or all of the spins; currently, only those that depend on a finite number are exactly solvable.

Define the function ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' : ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''R''' as

:&lt;math&gt;H_n(s)= \sum_{k=0}^n V(\tau^k s)&lt;/math&gt;

This function can be seen to consist of two parts: the self-energy of a configuration [''s''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''s''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''] of spins, plus the interaction energy of this set and all the other spins in the lattice. The ''n'' → ∞ limit of this function is the Hamiltonian of the system; for finite ''n'', these are sometimes called the '''finite state Hamiltonians'''.

===Partition function and measure===
The corresponding finite-state [[partition function (statistical mechanics)|partition function]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;Z_n(V) = \sum_{s_0,\ldots,s_n \in Q} \exp(-\beta H_n(C_0[s_0,s_1,\ldots,s_n]))&lt;/math&gt;

with ''C''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; being the cylinder sets defined above. Here, β = 1/''kT'', where ''k'' is [[Boltzmann's constant]], and ''T'' is the [[temperature]]. It is very common in mathematical treatments to set β = 1, as it is easily regained by rescaling the interaction energy. This partition function is written as a function of the interaction ''V'' to emphasize that it is only a function of the interaction, and not of any specific configuration of spins.  The partition function, together with the Hamiltonian, are used to define a [[measure (mathematics)|measure]] on the Borel σ-algebra in the following way: The measure of a cylinder set, i.e. an element of the base, is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mu (C_k[s_0,s_1,\ldots,s_n]) =  \frac{1}{Z_n(V)}  \exp(-\beta H_n (C_k[s_0,s_1,\ldots,s_n]))&lt;/math&gt;

One can then extend by countable additivity to the full σ-algebra. This measure is a [[probability measure]]; it gives the likelihood of a given configuration occurring in the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]] ''Q''&lt;sup&gt;'''Z'''&lt;/sup&gt;. By endowing the configuration space with a probability measure built from a Hamiltonian in this way, the configuration space turns into a [[canonical ensemble]].

Most thermodynamic properties can be expressed directly in terms of the partition function. Thus, for example, the [[Helmholtz free energy]] is given by

:&lt;math&gt;A_n(V)=-kT \log Z_n(V)&lt;/math&gt;

Another important related quantity is the [[topological pressure]], defined as

:&lt;math&gt;P(V) = \lim_{n\to\infty} \frac{1}{n} \log Z_n(V)&lt;/math&gt;

which will show up as the logarithm of the leading eigenvalue of the [[transfer operator]] of the solution.

===Free field solution===
The simplest model is the model where there is no interaction at all, and so ''V'' = ''c'' and ''H&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' = ''c'' (with ''c'' constant and independent of any spin configuration).  The partition function becomes

:&lt;math&gt;Z_n(c) = e^{-c\beta} \sum_{s_0,\ldots,s_n \in Q} 1&lt;/math&gt;

If all states are allowed, that is, the underlying set of states is given by a [[full shift]], then the sum may be trivially evaluated as

:&lt;math&gt;Z_n(c) = e^{-c\beta} q^{n+1}&lt;/math&gt;

If neighboring spins are only allowed in certain specific configurations, then the state space is given by a [[subshift of finite type]]. The partition function may then be written as

:&lt;math&gt;Z_n(c) = e^{-c\beta} |\mbox{Fix}\, \tau^n| =  e^{-c\beta} \mbox{Tr} A^n&lt;/math&gt;

where card is the [[cardinality]] or count of a set, and Fix is the set of [[Fixed point (mathematics)|fixed points]] of the iterated shift function:

:&lt;math&gt;\mbox{Fix}\, \tau^n =  \{ s \in Q^\mathbf{Z} : \tau^n s = s \}&lt;/math&gt;

The ''q'' × ''q'' matrix ''A'' is the [[adjacency matrix]] specifying which neighboring spin values are allowed.

===Interacting model===
The simplest case of the interacting model is the [[Ising model]], where the spin can only take on one of two values, ''s&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ {−1, 1} and only nearest neighbor spins interact. The interaction potential is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V(\sigma) = -J_p s_0 s_1\,&lt;/math&gt;

This potential can be captured in a 2 × 2 matrix with matrix elements

:&lt;math&gt;M_{\sigma \sigma'} = \exp \left( \beta J_p \sigma \sigma' \right)&lt;/math&gt;

with the index σ, σ′ ∈ {−1, 1}.  The partition function is then given by

:&lt;math&gt;Z_n(V) = \mbox{Tr}\, M^n&lt;/math&gt;

The general solution for an arbitrary number of spins, and an arbitrary finite-range interaction, is given by the same general form. In this case, the precise expression for the matrix ''M'' is a bit more complex.

The goal of solving a model such as the Potts model is to give an exact [[closed-form expression]] for the partition function and an expression for the [[Gibbs state]]s or [[equilibrium state]]s in the limit of ''n'' → ∞, the [[thermodynamic limit]].

== The Potts model in signal and image processing ==
The Potts model has applications in signal reconstruction. Assume that we are given noisy observation of a piecewise constant signal ''g'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. To recover ''g'' from the noisy observation vector ''f'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, one seeks a minimizer of  the corresponding inverse problem, the ''L&lt;sup&gt;p&lt;/sup&gt;''-Potts functional ''P''&lt;sub&gt;γ&lt;/sub&gt;(''u'') which is defined by

:&lt;math&gt; P_\gamma(u) = \gamma \| \nabla u \|_0 + \| u-f\|_p^p = \gamma \# \{ i : u_i \neq u_{i+1} \} + \sum_{i=1}^n  |u_i - f_i|^p&lt;/math&gt;

The jump penalty &lt;math&gt;\| \nabla u \|_0&lt;/math&gt; forces piecewise constant solutions and the data term &lt;math&gt;\| u-f\|_p^p&lt;/math&gt; couples the minimizing candidate ''u'' to the data ''f''. The parameter γ &gt; 0 controls the tradeoff between regularity and data fidelity. There are fast algorithms for the exact minimization of the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; and the ''L''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;-Potts functional (Friedrich, Kempe, Liebscher, Winkler, 2008).

In image processing, the Potts functional is related to the segmentation problem. However, in two dimensions the problem is NP-hard (Boykov, Veksler, Zabih, 2001).

In [[Library science|library]] and [[archival science]], '''preservation''' is a set of activities aimed at prolonging the life of a record while making as few changes as possible. Relevant [[metadata]], enhancement of cultural value, and improvement of access are also important aspects of preservation work. Actions taken to influence record creators prior to selection and acquisition must be avoided for proper preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/p/preservation|title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology|accessdate=2007-05-11 |publisher=Society of American Archivists|website=www.archivists.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Technical statement|date=September 2018}} Preservation, in this definition, is practiced in a [[library]] or an [[archive]] by a [[librarian]], [[archivist]], or other professional when they perceive a record is in need of care.

Preservation should be distinguished from [[conservation-restoration of cultural heritage]], which refers to the treatment and repair of individual items to slow the process of decay, or restore them to a usable state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/c/conservation |title=A Glossary of Archival and Records Terminology |accessdate=2007-05-11 |publisher=Society of American Archivists |website=www.archivists.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservation is occasionally used interchangeably with preservation, particularly outside the professional literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wiki.spsu.edu/index.php/Preservation_of_Cultural_Artifacts|title=Preservation of Cultural Artifacts|accessdate=2007-05-11|publisher=Southern Polytechnic State University|website=wiki.spsu.edu|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070611203338/http://wiki.spsu.edu/index.php/Preservation_of_Cultural_Artifacts|archive-date=2007-06-11|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==

===Standard functions of preservation programs===
*[[Collections care]] is the general maintenance and preventive care of a collection as a whole. This can include activities such as [[security]], [[environmental monitoring]], [[preservation surveys]] and more specialized activities such as [[mass deacidification]].
*[[Art conservation|Conservation]] is the treatment and repair of individual items to slow decay or restore them to a usable state. Conservation is occasionally used interchangeably with preservation, particularly outside the professional literature.
*[[Digital preservation]] is the maintenance of digitally stored information. Some means of digital preservation include refreshing, migration, replication and emulation. This should not be confused with [[digitization]], which is a process of creating digital information which must then itself be preserved digitally.
*[[Emergency management|Disaster preparedness]] (RT: Disaster Plan / [[Business continuity planning|Business Continuation]] / [[Disaster Recovery]] / Disaster Mitigation Plan) is the practice of arranging for the necessary resources and planning the best course of action to prevent or minimize damage to a collection in the event of a disaster of any level of magnitude, whether natural or man-made.
*Reformatting is the practice of creating copies of an object in another type of [[data storage device|data-storage device]]. Reformatting processes include [[microform|microfilming]] and digitization.

===Digitization===
{{Main|Digitizing}}

A relatively new concept, [[digitization]], has been hailed as a way to preserve historical items for future use. "Digitizing refers to the process of converting analog materials into digital form."&lt;ref&gt;Oya Y. Rieger, ''Preservation in the Age of Large-Scale Digitization: A White Paper'', (Washington, D.C.: Council on Library and Information Resources, 2008): 10, http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/reports/pub141/pub141.pdf {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150919051600/http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/reports/pub141/pub141.pdf |date=2015-09-19 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;

For manuscripts, digitization is achieved through scanning an item and saving it to a digital format. For example, the Google Book Search program has partnered with over forty libraries around the world to digitize books. The goal of this library partnership project is to "make it easier for people to find relevant books – specifically, books they wouldn't find any other way such as those that are out of print – while carefully respecting authors' and publishers' copyrights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/googlebooks/library/|title=Google Books Library Project&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although digitization seems to be a promising area for future preservation, there are also problems. The main problems are that digital space costs money, formats change, and backwards compatibility is not guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;Rieger, 24-25&lt;/ref&gt; Higher-quality images take a longer time to scan, but are often more valuable for future use. Fragile items are often more difficult or more expensive to scan, which creates a selection problem for preservationists. Other problems include scan quality, redundancy of digitized books among different libraries, and copyright law.&lt;ref&gt;Rieger, 14&lt;/ref&gt;

However, many of these problems are being solved through educational initiatives. Educational programs are tailoring themselves to fit preservation needs and help new students understand preservation practices. Programs teaching graduate students about digital librarianship are especially important.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conway|first1=Paul|year=2010|title=Preservation in the Age of Google: Digitization, Digital Preservation, and Dilemmas|url=|journal=Library Quarterly|volume=80|issue=1|page=73}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Groups such as the Digital Preservation Network strive to ensure that "the complete scholarly record is preserved for future generations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dpn.org/|title=Digital Preservation Network&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Library of Congress maintains a Sustainability of Digital Formats web site that educates institutions on various aspects of preservation: most notably, on approximately 200 digital format types and which are most likely to last into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalpreservation.gov/formats/intro/format_eval_rel.shtml|title=Library of Congress: Sustainability of Digital Formats&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Digital preservation|Digital Preservation]] is another name for digitization, and is the term more commonly used in archival courses. The main goal of digital preservation is to guarantee that people will have access to the digitally preserved materials long into the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preserv/defdigpres0408|title=Definitions of Digital Preservation|last=admin|date=2008-02-21|work=Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services (ALCTS)|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Practices ==
When practicing preservation one has several factors to consider to properly preserve a record: 1) the environment the record is store in, 2) the criteria to determine when preservation is necessary, 3) what standard practices will be laid down for preservation in an individual institution, 4) research and testing, and 5) vendor services needed for preservation. 

===Storage environment===
Environmental controls are necessary to facilitate the preservation of organic materials and are especially important to monitor in rare and [[special collections]]. Key environmental factors to watch include [[temperature]], [[relative humidity]], pests, pollutants, and [[light]] exposure.

In general, the lower the temperature is, the better it is for the collection. However, since books and other materials are often housed in areas with people, a compromise must be struck to accommodate human comfort. A reasonable temperature to accomplish both goals is 65-68˚F however, if possible, film and photography collections should be kept in a segregated area at 55˚F.&lt;ref&gt;Lull, W.P. (1990). ''Conservation environment guidelines for libraries and archives; with the assistance of Paul N. Banks.'' Albany, NY:  The University of the State of New York, The State Education Dept., The New York State Library, Division of Library Development.&lt;/ref&gt;

Books and other materials take up and give off moisture making them sensitive to relative humidity. Very high humidity encourages mold growth and insect infestations. Low humidity causes materials to lose their flexibility. Fluctuations in relative humidity are more damaging than a constant humidity in the middle or low range. Generally, the relative humidity should be between 30-50% with as little variation as possible, however recommendations on specific levels to maintain vary depending on the type of material, i.e. paper-based, film, etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/2The_Environment/01BasicGuidelines.php|title=Temperature, Relative Humidity, Light, and Air Quality: Basic Guidelines for Preservation|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=2007-12-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071212193142/http://www.nedcc.org/resources/leaflets/2The_Environment/01BasicGuidelines.php|archive-date=2007-12-12|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A specialized dew point calculator for book preservation is available.&lt;ref&gt;"Dew Point Calculator."

Pests, such as insects and vermin, eat and destroy paper and the adhesive that secures book bindings. Food and drink in libraries, archives, and museums can increase the attraction of pests.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/preservation/libeat.html# |title=UCSD Libraries Preservation Department. "Why is Eating and Drinking in the Library Discouraged?" 2006. UCSD. 18 June 2008 |access-date=2008-07-18 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060830091329/http://orpheus.ucsd.edu/preservation/libeat.html# |archive-date=2006-08-30 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[Integrated Pest Management]] system is one way to control pests in libraries.

Particulate and gaseous pollutants, such as soot, [[ozone]], [[sulfur dioxide]], oxides of nitrogen, can cause dust, soiling, and irreversible molecular damage to materials. Pollutants are exceedingly small and not easily detectable or removable. A special filtration system in the building's [[HVAC]] is a helpful defense.

Exposure to light also has a significant effect on materials. It is not only the light visible to humans that can cause damage, but also [[ultraviolet]] light and [[infrared]] radiation. Measured in [[lux]] or the amount of lumens/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, the generally accepted level of illumination with sensitive materials is limited to 50 lux per day. Materials receiving more lux than recommended can be placed in dark storage periodically to prolong the original appearance of the object.&lt;ref&gt;Thomson, G. ''The Museum Environment''. 2nd ed.

Bound materials are sensitive to rapid temperature or humidity cycling due to differential expansion of the binding and pages, which may cause the binding to crack and/or the pages to warp. Changes in temperature and humidity should be done slowly so as to minimize the difference in expansion rates. However, an accelerated aging study on the effects of fluctuating temperature and humidity on paper color and strength showed no evidence that cycling of one temperature to another or one RH to another caused a different mechanism of decay.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Louis Bigourdan and James M. Reilly. "Effects of Fluctuating Environments on Paper Materials--Stability and Practical Significance for Preservation."

===Preservation criteria===
Making a proper decision is an important factor before starting preservation practices. [[Decision making]] for preservation should be made considering significance and value of materials. Significance is considered to have two major components: importance and quality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scottishmuseums.org.uk/pdfs/Significance_cons.pdf|title=A Significance Recognition Scheme for Non-National Museums and Galleries in Scotland|publisher=Scottish Museums Council|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071106213355/http://www.scottishmuseums.org.uk/pdfs/Significance_cons.pdf &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt;|archivedate=2007-11-06|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Importance" relates to the collection's role as a record, and "quality" covers comprehensiveness, depth, uniqueness, authenticity and reputation of the collection. Moreover, analyzing the significance of materials can be used to uncover more about their meaning.&lt;ref name="A Regional Approach"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.natlib.govt.nz/catalogues/library-documents/identifying-items-of-national-significance|title=A Regional Approach to Identifying Items of National Significance Held by Small Cultural Institutions in New Zealand|last=Dorner|first=Daniel|last2=Young|first2=Sophie|publication-date=2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070328010251/http://www.natlib.govt.nz/catalogues/library-documents/identifying-items-of-national-significance|archivedate=2007-03-28|deadurl=yes|accessdate=2017-07-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Assessment of significance can also aid in documenting the provenance and context to argue the case for grant funding for the object and collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collectionsaustralia.net/sector_info_item/5|title=Significance - A Guide to Assessing the Significance of Cultural Heritage Objects and Collections|publisher=Heritage Collections Council (Australia)|accessdate=2007-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Forms of significance can be historically, culturally, socially, or spiritually significant. In the preservation context, libraries and archives make decisions in different ways. In libraries, decision-making likely targets existing holding materials, whereas in archives, decisions for preservation are often made when they acquire materials. Therefore, different criteria might be needed on different occasions. In general, for archive criteria, the points include:

# the characteristics of a record (purpose, creator, etc.);
# the quality of the information in the record;
# the record in context (part of a series or not);
# potential use and possible limitations; and
# the cost against the benefits from its existence.&lt;ref name="A Regional Approach" /&gt; 

[[File:Old book bindings.jpg|thumb|Worn books at the library of [[Merton College]], Oxford.|300x300px]]For archival criteria, the following are evidence of significance:

# uniqueness,
# irreplaceability,
# high level of impact – over time or place,
# high level of influence,
# representation of a type, and
# comparative value (rarity, completeness, integrity relative to others of its kind).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pymm|first=Bob|year=2006|title=Building Collections for All Time: the Issue of Significance|journal=AARL (Australian Academic Research Libraries)|volume=37|issue=1|pages=61–73|doi=10.1080/00048623.2006.10755323|month=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Standards===
Since the 1970s, the [[Northeast Document Conservation Center]] has stated that the study of understanding the needs of the archive/library is inherently important to the survival of archives and libraries. In order for the preservation of a collection to survive for a long time it is important that a systematic preservation plan is in place. The first step in planning a preservation program is to assess the institution's existing preservation needs. This process entails identifying the general and specific needs of the collection, establishing priorities, and gathering the resources to execute the plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Patkus|first=Beth|title=Assessing Preservation Needs, A Self-Survey Guide|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|publication-place=Andover|publication-date=2003|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because budget and time limitations require priorities to be set, standards have been established by the profession to determine what should be preserved in a collection.  Considerations include existing condition, rarity, and evidentiary and market values.  With non-paper formats, the availability of equipment to access the information will be a factor (for example, playback equipment for audio-visual materials, or microform readers).  An institution should determine how many, if any, other repositories hold the material, and consider coordinating efforts with those that do.&lt;ref name="bare_url"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://clir.org/pubs/abstract/pub103abst.html|title=The Evidence in Hand: Report of the Task Force on the Artifact in Library Collections|last=Nichols|first=Stephen G.|last2=Smith|first2=Abby|publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources|year=2001|isbn=1-887334-88-2|publication-place=Washington, D.C.|publication-date=2001|oclc=48623491|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Institutions should establish an environment conducive to preservation changes, involve staff, and create an understanding among administration and staff. The first steps an institution should implement, according to the NEDCC, are to establish a policy that defines and charts the course of action and create a framework for carrying out goals and priorities.

There are three methods for carrying out a preservation survey: general preservation assessment, collection condition surveys, and an item-by-item survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Graham|title=Surveying Collections: The importance of Condition Assessment for Preservation Management|publisher=Journal of Librarianship and Information Science 27, no. 4|publication-place=Washington, D.C.|publication-date=1995|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; General condition surveys can be part of a library [[inventory (library)|inventory]].

Selection for treatment determines the survival of materials and should be done by a specialist, whether in relation to an established collection development policy or on an item by item basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Preservation: Issues and Planning |last=Harris |first=Carolyn |publisher=American Library Association |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-585-37626-4 &lt;!-- |ISBN=0-585-37626-3 --&gt;|editor-last=Banks |editor-first=Paul N. |place=Chicago |pages=206–224 |contribution=Selection for Preservation |oclc=48139650 |postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;|author-link=Carolyn_Harris |editor2-last=Pilette |editor2-first=Roberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Once an object or collection has been chosen for preservation, the treatment must be determined that is most appropriate to the material and its repository. If the information is most important, reformatting or creation of a surrogate is a likely option. If the artifact itself is of value, it will receive conservation treatment, ideally of a reversible nature.&lt;ref name="bare_url" /&gt;

===Research and testing===
With old media deteriorating or showing their vulnerabilities and new media becoming available, research remains active in the field of conservation and preservation. Everything from how to preserve paper media to creating and maintaining electronic resources and gauging their [[digital permanence]] is being explored by students and professionals in archives/libraries. The two main issues that most institutions tend to face are the rapid disintegration of acidic paper and water damage (due to flooding, plumbing problems, etc.). Therefore, these areas of preservation, as well as new digital technologies, receive much of the research attention.

The [[American Library Association]] has many scholarly journals that publish articles on preservation topics, such as ''College and Research Libraries, Information Technology and Libraries,'' and ''Library Resources and Technical Services''. Scholarly periodicals in this field from other publishers include ''International Preservation News, Journal of the American Institute for Conservation'', and ''Collection Management'' among many others.

===Vendor services===
Many private entities provide preservation and conservation services and supplies. One of the most well known companies in preservation is Hollinger Metal Edge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.hollingermetaledge.com/|title=Hollinger Metal Edge - Since 1945!|website=www.hollingermetaledge.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; They sell [[Hollinger box]]es, folders, AV preservation tools, archival paper, exhibit material, and even furniture. Another company that produces many preservation tools is University Products.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.universityproducts.com/|title=University Products - Thinking in and out of the box since 1968.|website=www.universityproducts.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Education ==
{{Globalize section|date=May 2018}}

Learning the proper methods of preservation is important and most archivists are educated on the subject at academic institutions that specifically cover archives and preservation. In the United States most repositories require archivists to have a degree from an ALA-accredited library school.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/best-graduate-schools/top-library-information-science-programs/library-preservation-rankings|title=Best Archives and Preservation Programs|last=|first=|date=2017|website=US News &amp; World Report|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar institutions exist in countries outside the US.

Since 2010, the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation has enhanced funding for library and archives conservation education in three major conservation programs.&lt;ref&gt;https://mellon.org/programs/scholarly-communications/preservation-and-conservation/&lt;/ref&gt; These programs are all part of the Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property (ANAGPIC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ischool.utexas.edu/~anagpic/|title=Association of North American Graduate Programs in the Conservation of Cultural Property|publisher=University of Texas School of Information|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another educational resource available to preservationists is the Northeast Document Conservation Center or  NEDCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nedcc.org/home.php|title=NEDCC|publisher=Northeast Document Conservation Center|accessdate=2007-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Preservation, Planning and Publications Committee of the Preservation and Reformatting Section (PARS) in the Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services has created a Preservation Education Directory of ALA Accredited schools in the U.S. and Canada offering courses in preservation. The directory is updated approximately every three years. The 10th Edition was made available on the ALCTS web site in March 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/alcts/resources/preservation/educationdirectory|title=Preservation Education Directory 10th Edition|publisher=ALCTS|accessdate=2015-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Information science}}Additional preservation education is available to librarians through various professional organizations, such as:

==Preservation in non-academic facilities==

===Public libraries===
Limited, tax-driven funding can often interfere with the ability for public libraries to engage in extensive preservation activities. Materials, particularly books, are often much easier to replace than to repair when damaged or worn. Public libraries usually try to tailor their services to meet the needs and desires of their local communities, which could cause an emphasis on acquiring new materials over preserving old ones. Librarians working in public facilities frequently have to make complicated decisions about how to best serve their patrons. Commonly, public library systems work  with each other and sometimes with more academic libraries through interlibrary loan programs. By sharing resources, they are able to expand upon what might be available to their own patrons and share the burdens of preservation across a greater array of systems.

===Archival repositories and special collections===
Archival facilities focus specifically on rare and fragile materials. With staff trained in appropriate techniques, archives are often available to many public and private library facilities as an alternative to destroying older materials. Items that are unique, such as photographs, or items that are out of print, can be preserved in archival facilities more easily than in many library settings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clir.org/pubs/reports/pub89/archival.html|title=The Archival Paradigm—The Genesis and Rationales of Archival Principles and Practices|website=www.clir.org|publisher=Council on Library and Information Resources|accessdate=2007-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Museums===
Because so many museum holdings are unique, including print materials, art, and other objects, preservationists are often most active in this setting; however, since most holdings are usually much more fragile, or possibly corrupted, [[Conservation-restoration of cultural heritage|conservation]] may be more necessary than preservation. This is especially common in [[Art museum|art museums]]. Museums typically hold to the same practices lead by archival institutions.

==History==

===Antecedents===
Preservation as a formal profession in libraries and archives dates from the twentieth century, but its philosophy and practice has roots in many earlier traditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Mary Lynn |last=Ritzenthaler |year=1993 |title=Preserving Archives and Manuscripts |chapter= |editor= |others= |pages= |location=Chicago |publisher=Society of American Archivists |url= |authorlink= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many ancient societies, appeals to heavenly protectors were used to preserve books, scrolls and manuscripts from insects, fire and decay. 
* To the ancient Egyptians, the scarab or dung beetle (see: [[Scarab (artifact)]]) was a protector of written products. 
* In ancient [[Babylon]], [[Nabu]] is the heavenly patron of books and protector of clay tablets. Nabu is the Babylonian god of wisdom and writing, and is the patron of the scribes, librarians and archivists. 
* In Arabic and other eastern societies, sometimes a traditional method to protect books and scrolls was a metaphysical appeal to "Kabi:Kaj", the "King of the Cockroaches".&lt;ref&gt;Gacek, Adam. "The Use of Kabikaj in Arabic Manuscripts." Manuscripts of the Middle East. Volume I, 1986. Page 49.&lt;/ref&gt;
* There are three saints in the Christian church that are closely associated with libraries as patrons: [[Saint Lawrence]], [[Saint Jerome]]&lt;ref&gt;Kaschins, Elizabeth and Jane Kemp. "Saint Jerome, the Patron Saint of Librarians." Library Journal. September 1, 1988, pages 135-136.&lt;/ref&gt;, and Saint Catharine of Alexandria or [[Catherine of Alexandria]].
* In some Christian monasteries, prayers and curses were placed at the end of books to prevent theft, or to damn the thieves. Frequently called a "[[book curse]]", these were placed in the book to deter theft. 
* The ancient Chinese god Wei T'O is the patron god of libraries and books. Many examples of appeals to Wei T'O can be found in Chinese manuscripts dated five hundred or more years ago. &lt;ref&gt;See: http://www.weito.com/ accessed July 10, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Wei T'O is especially invoked for the protection of books and libraries against fire. Since the modern books are suffering from acid decomposition ([[slow fires]]), Wei T'O is especially relevant to modern librarianship. A modern product to de-acidify paper is named in his honor.
* Sri Lankan symbols or images of the Sinhalese "Fire Demons" are hung in the corners of libraries and other buildings to appease the incendiary demons and to avert fire, lightning and cataclysm, according to Sinhalese mythology. Since fire and acid decomposition (also known as "slow fires") are a special problem for libraries because of the concentration of paper products, the "Fire Demons" are also included when used to assuage these destroyers of libraries and books.
* The Aztec and Mayan Indians of Latin America also had deities concerned with libraries. The major god, [[Quetzalcoatl]], is credited with the discoveries of the arts, the calendar, and of writing. A single feather or plume at the beginning or at the end of a document or stone carving would indicate a dedication to the "Feathered Serpent." This symbol degenerated over time to a single fringed line.
Human record-keeping arguably dates back to the [[cave painting]] boom of the [[upper paleolithic]], some 32,000-40,000 years ago. More direct antecedents are the [[History of writing|writing systems]] that developed in the 4th millennium B.C. Written record keeping and information sharing practices, along with [[oral tradition]], sustain and transmit information from one group to another. This level of preservation has been supplemented over the last century with the professional practice of preservation and conservation in the cultural heritage community.

#[[Oral tradition]] or [[oral culture]], the transmission of information from one generation to the next without a writing system.

===Significant events===
*1933: [[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] introduces the field of conservation to paper deacidification when he publishes a paper on the [[acid paper]] problem. In later studies, Barrow tested paper from American books made between 1900 and 1949, and learned that after forty years the books had lost on average 96 percent of their original strength; after less than ten years, they had already lost 64 percent. Barrow determined that this rapid deterioration was not the direct result of using wood-pulp fibers, since rag papers of this period were also aging rapidly, but rather due to the residual [[sulfuric acid]] produced in both [[Cotton paper|rag]] and wood pulp papers. Manufacturing methods used after 1870 employed sulfuric acid for [[sizing]] and bleaching the paper. Earlier papermaking methods left the final product only mildly alkaline or even neutral.  Such paper has maintained its strength for 300 to 800 years, despite [[sulfur dioxide]] and other air pollutants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Stevens |first=Rolland E. |date=October 1968 |title=The Library |journal=The Journal of Higher Education |pages=407–409|doi=10.2307/1980093 |volume=39 |issue=7 |jstor=1980093}}&lt;/ref&gt; Barrow's 1933 article on the fragile state of wood pulp paper predicted the life expectancy, or "LE", of this paper was approximately 40–50 years. At that point the paper would begin to show signs of natural decay, and he concluded that research for a new media on which to write and print was needed.
*1966: [[The Flood of the River Arno in Florence, Italy]] damaged or destroyed millions of rare books and led to the development of restoration laboratories and new methods in conservation. Instrumental in this process was conservationist [[Peter Waters]], who led a group of volunteers, called "mud angels", in restoring thousands of books and papers. This event awakened many historians, librarians, and other professionals to the importance of having a preservation plan. Many consider this flood to be one of the worst disasters since the [[Destruction of the Library of Alexandria|burning of the Library of Alexandria]]. It spurred a resurgence in the profession of preservation and conservation worldwide.
*1987: Terry Saunders releases the film [[Slow fire|Slow Fires: On the Preservation of the Human Record]] which examines paper embrittlement resulting from acid decay
*1989: March 7 ["[[Commitment Day]]"] Major US print publishers convene at NYPL to endorse a community-wide commitment to utilizing [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO]] 9706 certified permanent durable paper in order to combat the acid paper epidemic.

===Significant people===
*[[William Barrow (chemist)|William Barrow]] (1904–1967) was an American chemist and paper conservator, and a pioneer of library and archives conservation. He introduced the field of conservation to paper deacidification through alkalization.
*[[Paul N. Banks]] (1934–2000) was Conservator and Head of the Conservation Department at the [[Newberry Library]] from 1964 to 1981, and published regularly on [[bookbinding]], [[book and paper conservation]], and problems related to conservation.  He designed and implemented a curriculum for [[Columbia University|Columbia University's]] School of Library Science that dealt directly with preservation training.
*[[Pamela Darling]], author and historian, was Preservation Specialist for the [[Association of Research Libraries]]. Her works include materials to aid libraries in establishing their own comprehensive preservation programs.
*[[Carolyn Harris (librarian)|Carolyn Harris]] worked as head of Columbia University Libraries' Preservation Division from 1981 until 1987, where she worked closely with Paul Banks. She published extensive research throughout her career, especially dealing with [[mass deacidification]] of wood-pulp paper.
*[[Peter Waters]], former Conservation Officer at the Library of Congress in Washington, DC, worked in the areas of disaster recovery and preparedness, and the salvaging of water-damaged paper goods.
*[[Nicholson Baker]] is a contemporary American novelist and author of ''[[Double Fold]]'', a criticism of libraries' destruction of paper-based media.
*[[Patricia Battin]], as the first president of the Commission on Preservation and Access, worked to organize a national campaign both for the use of alkaline paper in publishing companies and for a national program of preservation [[microform|microfilming]].
*John F. Dean, Preservation and Conservation Librarian at Cornell University, has made contributions towards improving [[Book preservation in developing countries|preservation efforts in developing countries]]. Specifically, Dean has created online tutorials for library conservation and preservation in Southeast Asia and Iraq and the Middle East.

The [[Paul Banks and Carolyn Harris Preservation Award]] for outstanding preservation specialists in library and archival science, is given annually by the Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ala.org/ala/alcts/alcts.cfm Association for Library Collections &amp; Technical Services] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071214195255/http://www.ala.org/ala/alcts/alcts.cfm |date=2007-12-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; a subdivision of the [[American Library Association]]. It is awarded in recognition of professional preservation specialists who have made significant contributions to the field.

==Legal &amp; Ethical Issues==
Reformatting, or in any other way copying an item's contents, raises obvious [[copyright]] issues. In many cases, a library is allowed to make a limited number of copies of an item for preservation purposes. In the United States, certain exceptions have been made for libraries and archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/108- |title=U.S. Code: Title 17,108. Limitations on exclusive rights: Reproduction by libraries and archives |accessdate=2008-07-25 |publisher=Legal Information Institute |website=www.law.cornell.edu]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics will play an important role in many aspects of the conservator's activities. When choosing which objects are in need of treatment, the conservator should do what is best for the object in question and not yield to pressure or opinion from outside sources. Conservators should refer to the AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice,&lt;ref name="AIC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://aic.stanford.edu/pubs/ethics.html|title=AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000304161903/http://aic.stanford.edu/pubs/ethics.html|archivedate=March 4, 2000|deadurl=y}}&lt;/ref&gt; which states that the conservation professional must "strive to attain the highest possible standards in all aspects of conservation."

One instance in which these decisions may get tricky is when the conservator is dealing with cultural objects. The AIC Code of Ethics and Guidelines for Practice&lt;ref name="AIC" /&gt; has addressed such concerns, stating "All actions of the conservation professional must be governed by an informed respect for cultural property, its unique character and significance and the people or person who created it." This can be applied in both the care and long-term storage of objects in archives and institutions.

It is important that preservation specialists to be respectful of cultural property and the societies that created it, it is also important for them to be aware of international and national laws pertaining to stolen items. In recent years there has been a rise in nations seeking out artifacts that have been stolen and are now in museums. In many cases museums are working with the nations to find a compromise to balance the need for reliable supervision as well as access for both the public and researchers.&lt;ref&gt;"Rightful Owners." ''Nature'', Vol. 440 (6) 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Conservators are not just bound by ethics to treat cultural and religious objects with respect, but also in some cases by law. For example, in the United States, conservators must comply with the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act ([[NAGPRA]]). The [http://www.firstarchivistscircle.org/ First Archivists Circle], a group of Native American archivists, has also created [http://www2.nau.edu/libnap-p/index.html Protocols for Native American Archival Materials]. The non-binding guidelines are suggestions for libraries and archives with Native American archival materials.

The care of cultural and sacred objects often affects the physical storage or the object. For example, sacred objects of the native peoples of the Western United States are supposed to be stored with sage to ensure their spiritual well being. The idea of storing an object with plant material is inherently problematic to an archival collection because of the possibility of insect infestation. When conservators have faced this problem, they have addressed it by using freeze-dried sage, thereby meeting both conservation and cultural needs.

Some individuals in the archival community have explored the possible moral responsibility to preserve all cultural phenomena, in regards to the concept of monumental preservation.&lt;ref&gt;Cloonan, Michele V. [http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1387/is_3_55/ai_n19311179 "The Moral Imperative to Preserve"], "[[Library Trends]]", Winter 2007. Retrieved on 2008-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Other advocates argue that such an undertaking is something that the indigenous or native communities that produce such cultural objects are better suited to perform. Currently, however, many indigenous communities are not financially able to support their own archives and museums. Still, indigenous archives are on the rise in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cooper|first1=Amy|year=2002|title=Issues in Native American Archives|url=|journal=Collection Management|volume=27|issue=2|pages=43–54|doi=10.1300/j105v27n02_05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism==
There is a longstanding tension between preservation of and access to library materials, particularly in the area of [[special collections]]. Handling materials promotes their progression to an unusable state, especially if they are handled carelessly. On the other hand, materials must be used in order to gain any benefit from them. In a collection with valuable materials, this conflict is often resolved by a number of measures which can include heightened security, requiring the use of gloves for photographs, restricting the materials researchers may bring with them into a reading room, and restricting use of materials to patrons who are not able to satisfy their research needs with less valuable copies of an item. These restrictions are annoyances to researchers who feel that these measures are in place solely to keep materials out of the hands of the public.

There is also controversy surrounding preservation methods. A major controversy at the end of the twentieth century centered on the practice of discarding items that had been microfilmed. This was the subject of novelist [[Nicholson Baker]]'s book ''Double Fold'', which chronicled his efforts to save many old runs of American newspapers (formerly owned by the British Library) from being sold to dealers or pulped. A similar concern persists over the retention of original documents reformatted by any means, analog or digital. Concerns include scholarly needs and legal requirements for authentic or original records as well as questions about the longevity, quality and completeness of reformatted materials.&lt;ref&gt;See Robert B. Townsend, {{cite web |url=http://blog.historians.org/articles/204/google-books-whats-not-to-like |title=Google Books: What’s Not to Like? |accessdate=2008-07-27 |publisher=American Historical Association |website=www.historians.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also Paul Duguid, {{cite web |url=http://www.firstmonday.org/issues/issue12_8/duguid/ |title=Inheritance and loss? A brief survey of Google Books |accessdate=2008-07-27 |publisher=First Monday}}&lt;/ref&gt; Retention of originals as a source or fail-safe copy is now a fairly common practice. Another controversy revolving around different preservation methods is that of digitization of original material to maintain the intellectual content of the material while ignoring the physical nature of the book.&lt;ref&gt;Tanselle, G.T. (1998). Texts and artifacts in the electronic era. 21stC, 3.2. 
[http://www.columbia.edu/cu/21stC/issue-3.2/tanselle.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the [[Modern Language Association]]'s Committee on the Future of the Print Record structured its "Statement on the Significance of Primary Records" on the inherent theoretical ideology that there is a need to preserve as many copies of a printed edition as is possible as texts and their textual settings are, quite simply, not separable, just as the artifactual characteristics of texts are as relevant and varied as the texts themselves (in the report mentioned herewith, [[G. Thomas Tanselle]] suggests that presently existing book stacks need not be abandoned with emerging technologies; rather they serve as vitally important original (primary) sources for future study).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_primaryrecords/repview_records|title=Statement on the Significance of Primary Records|accessdate=2008-07-27|publisher=Modern Language Association|website=www.mla.org|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080701014009/http://www.mla.org/resources/documents/rep_primaryrecords/repview_records|archive-date=2008-07-01|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many digitized items, such as back issues of periodicals, are provided by publishers and databases on a subscription basis. If these companies were to cease providing access to their digital information, facilities that elected to discard paper copies of these periodicals could face significant difficulties in providing access to these items. Discussion as to the best ways to utilize digital technologies is therefore ongoing, and the practice continues to evolve. Of course, the issues surrounding digital objects and their care in libraries and archives continues to expand as more and more of contemporary culture is created, stored, and used digitally. These [[born-digital]] materials raise their own new kinds of preservation challenges and in some cases they may even require use new kinds of tools and techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last =Ross |first =Seamus |last2 =Gow |first2 =Ann |publication-date = 1999 |title = Digital archaeology?

===The library as a sacred institution===
In her book "Sacred Stacks: The Higher Purpose of Libraries and Librarianship", Nancy Kalikow Maxwell discusses how libraries are capable of performing some of the same functions as religion.&lt;ref name="Maxwell"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Sacred Stacks: The Higher Purpose of Libraries and Librarianship|last=Maxwell|first=Nancy Kalikow|publisher=American Library Association|year=2006|isbn=0-8389-0917-5|place=Chicago|postscript=&lt;!--None--&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many librarians feel that their work is done for some higher purpose.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt;  The same can be said for preservation librarians. One instance of the library's role as sacred is to provide a sense of [[immortality]]: with the ever-changing world outside, the library will remain stable and dependable.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt; Preservation is a great help in this regard. Through digitization and reformatting, preservation librarians are able to retain material while at the same time adapting to new methods. In this way, libraries can adapt to the changes in user needs without changing the quality of the material itself. Through preservation efforts, patrons can rest assured that although materials are constantly deteriorating over time, the library itself will remain a stable, reliable environment for their information needs. Another sacred ability of the library is to provide information and a connection to the past.&lt;ref name="Maxwell" /&gt; By working to slow down the processes of deterioration and decay of library materials, preservation practices help keep this link to the past alive.

The '''Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies''' was established in 2005 as a partnership between the [[Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars]] and the [[Pew Charitable Trusts]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotechproject.org/about/mission/ nanotechproject.org] &amp;ndash; Mission&lt;/ref&gt; The Project was intended to address the social, political, and public safety aspects of [[nanotechnology]]. It intended in particular to look for research and policy gaps and opportunities in knowledge and regulatory processes, and to develop strategies for closing them. The project worked with multiple U.S. and foreign governments and organizations.

The project's stated goal was "to inform the debate and to create an active public and policy dialogue. It was not an advocate either for, or against, particular nanotechnologies. Rather, the Project sought to ensure that as these technologies are developed, potential human health and environmental risks were anticipated, properly understood, and effectively managed."&lt;ref&gt;[http://nanotechproject.org/about About The Project on Emerging Nanotechnologies&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Radio Research Project''' was a [[social research]] project funded by the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] to look into the effects of mass media on society.&lt;ref&gt;La musa venal. Producción y consumo de la cultura industrial&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1937, the Rockefeller Foundation started funding research to find the effects of new forms of mass media on society, especially radio.  Several universities joined up and a headquarters was formed at the [[Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs|School of Public and International Affairs]] at [[Princeton University]].  

:A particularly influential program of effects research was pursued in the Office of Radio Research (ORR) established by the Rockefeller Foundation under the auspices of Princeton University. Managed by [[Paul Lazarsfeld]], Austrian émigré psychologist, the program was overseen by [[Hadley Cantril]], Princeton psychologist, and [[Frank Stanton (executive)|Frank Stanton]], director of research at CBS. The program was designed by Cantril and Stanton to determine why  people listened to radio. Stanton, a psychological researcher who soon became CBS president, was naturally interested in what lured people to programs and to what extent a program and its [[ad]]s boosted sales of products.&lt;ref&gt;J. Michael Sproule (1997) ''Propaganda and Democracy'', page 64, [[Cambridge University Press]] {{ISBN|0-521-47022-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the subjects of the Project's first studies were [[soap opera]]s, known as [[radio drama]]s at the time.

The Radio Project also conducted research on the infamous [[Halloween]] broadcast of ''[[The War of the Worlds (radio)|The War of the Worlds]]'' in 1938. Of the estimated 6 million people who heard this broadcast, they found that 25% accepted the program's reports of mass destruction. The majority of these did not think they were hearing a literal invasion from Mars, but rather an attack by Germany. The researchers determined that radio broadcasts from the [[Munich Crisis]] may have lent credence to this supposition.

A third research project was that of listening habits. Because of this, a new method was developed to survey an audience – this was dubbed the [[Little Annie Project]]. The official name was the [[Stanton-Lazarsfeld Program Analyzer]]. This allowed one not only to find out if a listener liked the performance, but how they felt at any individual moment, through a dial which they would turn to express their preference (positive or negative). This has since become an essential tool in focus group research.

[[Theodor Adorno]] produced numerous reports on the effects of "atomized listening" which radio supported and of which he was highly critical. However, because of profound methodological disagreements with Lazarsfeld over the use of techniques such as listener surveys and "Little Annie" (Adorno thought both grossly simplified and ignored the degree to which expressed tastes were the result of commercial marketing), Adorno left the project in 1941.

A '''[[riparian]] buffer''' or '''stream buffer''' is a [[vegetation|vegetated]] area (a "[[buffer strip]]") near a [[stream]], usually [[forest]]ed, which helps shade and partially protect the stream from the impact of adjacent [[land use]]s.  It plays a key role in increasing [[water quality]] in associated streams, [[river]]s, and [[lake]]s, thus providing environmental benefits.  With the decline of many [[aquatic ecosystems]] due to [[agriculture]], riparian buffers have become a very common [[conservation ethic|conservation]] practice aimed at increasing water quality and reducing [[water pollution|pollution]].

== Benefits ==
Riparian buffers act to intercept [[sediment]], [[nutrient]]s, [[pesticide]]s, and other materials in [[surface runoff]] and reduce nutrients and other [[pollutants]] in shallow subsurface water flow.&lt;ref&gt;U.S. Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS). (2006).
[ftp://ftp-fc.sc.egov.usda.gov/NHQ/practice-standards/standards/391.pdf "National Conservation Practice Standard: Riparian Forest Buffer."] Code 391. January 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; They also serve to provide [[habitat]] and [[wildlife corridor]]s in primarily agricultural areas.  They can also be key in reducing [[erosion]] by providing [[stream bank]] stabilization.

=== Water quality benefits ===
*Intercepting sediments/nutrients - Key to counteract [[eutrophication]] in downstream lakes and ponds which can be detrimental to aquatic habitats because of large [[fish kill]]s that occur upon large-scale eutrophication.
*Intercepting pesticides - Riparian buffers keep chemicals that can be harmful to aquatic life out of the water.  Some pesticides can be especially harmful if they [[bioaccumulate]] in the organism, with the chemicals reaching harmful levels once they are ready for human consumption.
*Bank stabilization - This is important because erosion can be a major problem in agricultural regions when cut (eroded) banks can take land out of production.  Erosion can also lead to [[sedimentation]] and [[siltation]] of downstream lakes, ponds, and reservoirs.  Siltation can greatly reduce the life span of [[reservoir]]s and the [[dam]]s that create the reservoirs.

=== Habitat benefits ===
*Provide habitat - Riparian buffers can act as crucial habitat for a large number of species, especially those who have lost [[habitat]] due to agricultural land being put into production.
*Increase biodiversity - By adding this vegetated area of land near a water source it becomes a prime location for species that may have left the area due to non-conservation land use to re-establish.  With this re-establishment the number of native species and [[biodiversity]] in general can be increased.
*Buffers acting as corridors - Buffers also serve a major role in wildlife habitat. The habitat provided by the buffers also double as corridors for species that have had their habitat fragmented by various land uses.
*Shading water - The large [[tree]]s in the first zone of the riparian buffer provide shade and therefore cooling for the water, increasing productivity and increasing habitat quality for aquatic species.
*[[Large woody debris]] - When branches and stumps fall into the stream from the [[riparian zone]], more stream habitat features are created. [[Carbon]] is added as an energy source for [[Biota (ecology)|biota]] in the stream.

=== Economic benefits ===
*Increase land value - Often people who purchase land for recreational use are willing to pay more if there is more wooded area located on the land.
*Produce profitable alternative crops - Vegetation such as [[Black Walnut]] and [[Hazelnut]], which can be profitably harvested, can be incorporated into the riparian buffer.
*Increase lease fees for hunting - The increased habitat means that the land will be more sought-after for hunting purposes.

== Buffer design ==
[[File:Late Winter Afternoon in Munson Park Wetlands.webm|thumb|Ground level view of riparian buffer between Munson Pond (off camera left) and an agricultural operation (off camera right)]]

A riparian buffer is usually split into three different zones, each having its own specific purpose for filtering runoff and interacting with the adjacent aquatic system. Buffer design is a key element in the effectiveness of the buffer.  It is generally recommended that native species be chosen to plant in these three zones, with the general width of the buffer being {{convert|50|ft|m}} on each side of the stream.&lt;ref&gt;Dosskey, M., Schultz, D., &amp; Isenhart, T. (1997). [https://fs.usda.gov/nac/documents/agroforestrynotes/an03rfb02.pdf "Riparian Buffers for Agricultural Land."] ''Agroforestry Notes,'' No. 3, January 1997. National Agroforestry Center, USDA Forest Service, Lincoln, NE.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zone 1.''' This zone should function mainly to shade the water source and act as a bank stabilizer.  The zone should include large native tree species that grow fast and can quickly act to perform these tasks.  Although this is usually the smallest of the three zones and absorbs the fewest contaminants, most of the contaminants have been eliminated by Zone 2 and Zone 3.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"&gt;Maryland Cooperative Extension.  "Riparian Forest Buffer Design, Establishment, and Maintenance." University of Maryland, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zone 2.''' Usually made up of native [[shrubs]], this zone provides a habitat for wildlife, including nesting areas for [[bird]] species.  This zone also acts to slow and absorb contaminants that Zone 3 has missed.  The zone is an important transition between grassland and forest.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"/&gt;

'''Zone 3.''' This zone is important as the first line of defense against contaminants.  It consists mostly of native [[grass]]es and serves primarily to slow water runoff and begin to absorb contaminants before they reach the other zones.  Although these grass strips should be one of the widest zones, they are also the easiest to install.&lt;ref name="Maryland Cooperative Extension 1998"/&gt;

'''Streambed Zone.''' The streambed zone of the riparian area is linked closely to Zone 1.  Zone 1 provides fallen limbs, trees, and tree roots that in turn slow water flow, reducing erosional processes associated with increased water flow and flooding. This woody debris also increases habitat and cover for various aquatic species

The [https://fs.usda.gov/nac National Agroforestry Center] has developed a Filter Strip Design tool ([https://fs.usda.gov/nac/tools/AgBufferBuilder.htm AgBufferBuilder]), which is a GIS-based computer program for designing vegetative filter strips around agricultural fields that utilizes terrain analysis to account for spatially non-uniform runoff.

== Species selection (example using both native Nebraska and introduced species) ==
In Zone 1: Cottonwood, Bur Oak, Hackberry, Swamp White Oak, Siberian Elm, Honeylocust, Silver Maple, Black Walnut, and Northern Red Oak.&lt;ref name="NRDTree"&gt;Nebraska Association of Resources Districts (2003). [http://www.nrdnet.org/trees/pdfs/tree_book.pdf "Conservation Trees for Nebraska."]&lt;/ref&gt;

In Zone 2: [[Prunus mandshurica|manchurian apricot]], Silver Buffaloberry, Caragana, Black Cherry, Chokecherry, Sandcherry, Peking Cotoneaster, Midwest Crabapple, Golden Currant, Elderberry, Washington Hawthorn, American Hazel, Amur Honeysuckle, Common Lilac, Amur Maple, American Plum, and Skunkbush Sumac.&lt;ref name="NRDTree"/&gt;

In Zone 3: Western Wheatgrass, Big Bluestem, Sand Bluestem, Sideoats Grama, Blue Grama, Hairy Grama, Buffalo Grass, Sand Lovegrass, Switchgrass, Little Bluestem, Indiangrass, Prairie Cordgrass, Prairie Dropseed, Tall Dropseed, Needleandthread, Green Needlegrass.

== Managing forests in riparian area ==
[[Logging]] is sometimes recommended as a management practice in riparian buffers, usually to provide economic incentive. However, some studies have shown that logging can harm wildlife populations, especially birds.  A study by the University of Minnesota found that there was a correlation between the harvesting of timber in riparian buffers and a decline in bird populations.&lt;ref&gt;Journal of Wildlife Management; Apr 2005, Vol. 69 Issue 2, p689-698, 10p&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, logging is generally discouraged as an environmental practice, and left to be done in designated logging areas.

== Conservation incentives ==
The [[Conservation Reserve Program]] (CRP), a farming assistance program in the [[United States]], provides many incentives to landowners to encourage them to install riparian buffers around water systems that have a high chance of non-point water pollution and are highly erodible. For example, the [[Nebraska]] system of Riparian Buffer Payments offers the following:
*Annual rental payments = $62 to $116 per acre/year (up to $96 per acre per year for certain marginal pasture land)
*Sign up bonus: up-front payment of $10 per acre/year for the life of the contract (Example: $150/ac for a fifteen-year contract)
*Payments for 90% of costs for trees, shrubs, grass seed, site preparation and planting
*10 to 15 year contracts
*Eligible areas:
**Up to {{convert|180|ft|m}} average width along each side of a continuous or intermittent stream
**Strips of grass, shrubs, and/or trees can be used
**Planting done by the local Natural Resource Districts (NRDs)	

These incentives are offered to agriculturists to compensate them for their economic loss of taking this land out of production.  If the land is highly erodible and produces little economic gain, it can sometimes be more economic to take advantage of these CRP programs.&lt;ref&gt;University of Nebraska Cooperative Extension. "Benefits of Riparian Forest Buffers (Streamside Plantings of Trees, Shrubs and Grasses)."  University Press, Lincoln, NE.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effectiveness ==
Riparian buffers have undergone much scrutiny about their effectiveness, resulting in thorough testing and monitoring.  A study done by the [[University of Georgia]], conducted over a nine-year period, monitored the amounts of fertilizers that reached the watershed from the source of the application.  It found that these buffers removed at least 60% of the [[nitrogen]] in the runoff, and at least 65% of the [[phosphorus]] from the fertilizer application.   The same study showed that the effectiveness of the Zone 3 was much greater than that of both Zone 1 and 2 at removing contaminants.&lt;ref&gt;Durham, Sharon. "Riparian Buffers Effective."  Southeast Farm Press. 4 Feb 2004. p26&lt;/ref&gt;. But another recent study did not find efficiency (or a very limiting capacity) for reducing glyphosate and AMPA leaching to streams ; Spontaneous herbaceous vegetation RBS is as efficient as Salix plantations and mesures of Glyphosate in runoff after a year&lt;ref name=study2017effic/&gt;, suggest an unexpected persistence and even a capacity of RBS to potentially favor glyphosate infiltration up to 70 cm depth in the soil&lt;ref name=study2017effic&gt;Hénault-Ethier, L., Lucotte, M., Moingt, M., Paquet, S., Maccario, S., Smedbol, É., ... &amp; Labrecque, M. (2017). ''[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0048969717309397#f0030 Herbaceous or Salix miyabeana ‘SX64’narrow buffer strips as a means to minimize glyphosate and aminomethylphosphonic acid leaching from row crop fields]''. Science of the Total Environment, 598, 1177-1186.&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Long-term sustainability ==
After the initial installation of the riparian buffer, relatively little maintenance needs to be performed to keep the buffer in good condition.  Once the trees and grasses reach maturity, they regenerate naturally and make a more effective buffer.  The sustainability of the riparian buffer makes it extremely attractive to landowners, since they do relatively little work and still receive payments. Riparian buffers have the potential to be the most effective ways to protect aquatic biodiversity, water quality and manage water resources in developing countries that lack the funds to install water treatment and supply systems in midsize and small towns.

&lt;!-- NOTE: This section was titled "Etymology and definitions," but as the etymology material is defining sexual intercourse, and there is little material on the etymology, it seemed there was no need to separate it from the other definitions; the heading was subsequently shortened to "Definitions" and added as a subsection of the Behaviors section (since it involves general views, and researchers' views, on sexual intercourse/sexual activity definitions and how people behave with regard to them). Per MOS:PARAGRAPHS, "Short paragraphs and single sentences generally do not warrant their own subheading."--&gt;

''Sexual intercourse'' may be called ''coitus'', ''copulation'', ''coition'', or ''intercourse'' (the last of which is typically shorthand for ''sexual intercourse''). ''Coitus'' is derived from the [[Latin]] word ''coitio'' or ''coire'', meaning "a coming together or joining together" or "to go together", and is known under different ancient Latin names for a variety of sexual activities, but usually denotes penile–vaginal penetration.&lt;ref name="Coitus"&gt;

===Bonding===
{{See also|Human mating strategies|Pair bond}}
Copulation ranges from a purely reproductive activity to one of emotional bonding. For example, sexual intercourse and sexual activity in general often play a strong role in [[human bonding]].&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt; In many societies, it is normal for couples to have sexual intercourse while using some method of [[birth control]] (contraception), sharing pleasure and strengthening their emotional bond through sexual activity even though they are deliberately avoiding pregnancy.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;

In humans and [[bonobo]]s, the female undergoes relatively [[concealed ovulation]] so that male and female partners commonly do not know whether she is fertile at any given moment. One possible reason for this distinct biological feature may be formation of strong emotional bonds between sexual partners important for social interactions and, in the case of humans, long-term partnership rather than immediate sexual reproduction.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reis"&gt;{{Cite book|author= Harry T.

The resulting cooperation encourages collective tasks that promote the survival of each member of the group.&lt;ref name="Non-human"/&gt;

===Stimulation===
Sexual intercourse or other sexual activity can encompass various [[sexually stimulating]] factors ([[Stimulus (physiology)|physiological stimulation]] or [[Stimulus (psychology)|psychological stimulation]]), including different [[sex position]]s or the use of [[sex toy]]s.&lt;ref name="Weiten, 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Taormino"&gt;{{cite book |last=Taormino |first=Tristan |authorlink=Tristan Taormino |title=The Big Book of Sex Toys|publisher=Quiver|year=2009 |accessdate=June 9, 2014|page=52|isbn=978-1-59233-355-4|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hfly-iMkWRkC&amp;pg=PA52}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreplay may precede some sexual activities, often leading to [[sexual arousal]] of the partners and resulting in the erection of the [[Human penis|penis]] or [[Vaginal lubrication|natural lubrication]] of the [[vagina]].&lt;ref name="Weiten, 2011"&gt;{{cite book|title=Psychology Applied to Modern Life: Adjustment in the 21st Century|isbn =1-111-18663-4|publisher=[[Cengage Learning]]|year=2011|pages=384–386|accessdate=January 5, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=CGu96TeAZo0C&amp;pg=PT421 |author1=Wayne Weiten |author2=Dana S.

In most mammals, the anatomy of the reproductive organs and some circuits of the nervous system are specifically organized for heterosexual copulation. Copulation corresponds to a succession of [[Instinct|innate]] sexual reflexes: [[erection]], vaginal lubrication, [[lordosis behavior]], immobilization, intromission, [[pelvic thrust]] and [[ejaculation]]. These copulatory [[Reflex arc|reflexes]] are controlled by [[hormone]]s and facilitated by sexual [[pheromone]]s.&lt;ref name="Plant"&gt;Plant T., Zeleznik A. (2015).

Oral sex consists of all the sexual activities that involve the use of the mouth and throat to stimulate [[Sex organ|genitalia]] or anus. It is sometimes performed to the exclusion of all other forms of sexual activity, and may include the ingestion or absorption of semen (during [[fellatio]]) or vaginal fluids (during [[cunnilingus]]).&lt;ref name="Weiten, 2008"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kamen"&gt;{{Cite book| author = Paula Kamen| title = Her Way: Young Women Remake the Sexual Revolution | isbn = 0814747337| publisher = [[New York University Press]]| year = 2000|pages = 74–77| accessdate=September 5, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=9bXq3Qc4py0C&amp;pg=PA74&amp;lpg=PA74}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fingering (or digital penetration or digital intercourse) involves the manual manipulation of the clitoris, rest of the [[vulva]], vagina or anus for the purpose of sexual arousal and sexual stimulation; it may constitute the entire sexual encounter or it may be part of mutual masturbation, foreplay or other sexual activities.&lt;ref name="Kinetics"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hite"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hite|first=Shere|author-link=Shere Hite|title=The Hite Report: A Nationwide Study of Female Sexuality |publisher=[[Seven Stories Press]]|year=2003|location=New York, NY|pages=512 pages|isbn=1-58322-569-2|accessdate=March 2, 2012|url=https://books.google.com/?id=s3OZaVn2wfkC&amp;lpg=PP1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Carroll2"&gt;{{cite book | title =Sexuality Now: Embracing Diversity | publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2009 | pages = 118, 252, and 264 | accessdate =June 23, 2012 | url = https://books.google.com/?id=5f8mQx7ULs4C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118|isbn =978-0-495-60274-3| first = Janell L. | last = Carroll}}

The subsequent route of the sperm from the vault of the vagina is through the [[cervix]] and into the [[uterus]], and then into the [[fallopian tube]]s. Millions of sperm are present in each ejaculation, to increase the chances of one fertilizing an egg or [[ovum]] (see [[sperm competition]]). When a fertile ovum from the female is present in the fallopian tubes, the male gamete joins with the ovum, resulting in [[fertilisation|fertilization]] and the formation of a new [[embryo]]. When a fertilized ovum reaches the uterus, it becomes implanted in the lining of the uterus (the [[endometrium]]) and a [[pregnancy]] begins.&lt;ref name="Evan Jones"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Starr3"&gt;{{cite book| author = Cecie Starr|author2= Beverly McMillan|title = Human Biology| publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2015 | page = 339| accessdate = December 27, 2017 |isbn = 1305445945| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=lS5-BAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT339}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When a [[sperm donor]] has sexual intercourse with a woman who is not his partner and for the sole purpose of impregnating the woman, this may be known as natural [[insemination]], as opposed to [[artificial insemination]].

It said that women engage in anal intercourse less commonly than men, but that the practice is not uncommon among women; it was estimated that 10% to 14% of women aged 18 to 39 years old practiced anal sex in the past 90 days, and that most of the women said they practiced it once a month or a few times a year.&lt;ref name="Carroll"/&gt;

===={{anchor|sexarche}}Age at first intercourse====
The prevalence of sexual intercourse has been compared cross-culturally. In 2003, Michael Bozon of the French [[Institut national d'études démographiques]] conducted a cross-cultural study titled "At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?" In the first group of the contemporary cultures he studied, which included [[sub-Saharan Africa]] (listing [[Mali]], [[Senegal]] and [[Ethiopia]]), the data indicated that the age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at later ages than that of women, but is often extra-marital; the study considered the [[Indian subcontinent]] to also fall into this group, though data was only available from [[Nepal]].&lt;ref name="Bozon"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bozon |first=Michael |year=2003 |title=At what age do women and men have their first sexual intercourse?

In the second group, the data indicated families encouraged daughters to delay marriage, and to abstain from sexual activity before that time. However, sons are encouraged to gain experience with older women or prostitutes before marriage. Age of men at sexual initiation in these societies is at lower ages than that of women; this group includes Latin cultures, both from [[southern Europe]] (Portugal, Greece and Romania are noted) and from [[Latin America]] (Brazil, [[Chile]], and the [[Dominican Republic]]). The study considered many Asian societies to also fall into this group, although matching data was only available from [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt;

In the third group, age of men and women at sexual initiation was more closely matched; there were two sub-groups, however. In non-Latin, Catholic countries (Poland and [[Lithuania]] are mentioned), age at sexual initiation was higher, suggesting later marriage and reciprocal valuing of male and female virginity. The same pattern of late marriage and reciprocal valuing of virginity was reflected in [[Singapore]] and [[Sri Lanka]]. The study considered China and Vietnam to also fall into this group, though data were not available.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt; In northern and eastern European countries, age at sexual initiation was lower, with both men and women involved in sexual intercourse before any union formation; the study listed Switzerland, Germany and the Czech Republic as members of this group.&lt;ref name="Bozon"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Caselli"/&gt;

Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) are [[bacteria]], [[virus]]es and [[Parasitism|parasites]], which are passed from person to person during sexual contact, especially penetrative sexual intercourse. Some, in particular [[HIV]] and syphilis, can also be passed in other ways, including from mother to child during pregnancy and [[childbirth]], through [[blood product]]s, and by shared [[hypodermic needle]]s.&lt;ref name="WHO 2015"&gt;{{cite web| title=Sexually transmitted infections (STIs)|publisher=World Health Organization

Untreated chlamydia infection can lead to female infertility and [[ectopic pregnancy]]. [[Human papillomavirus]] can lead to genital and [[cervical cancer]]s. [[Syphilis]] can result in [[stillbirth]]s and neonatal deaths. Untreated gonococcal infections result in [[miscarriage]]s, [[preterm birth]]s and [[Perinatal mortality|perinatal deaths]].

In cases where infection is suspected, early medical intervention is highly beneficial in all cases. The CDC stated "the risk of HIV transmission from an infected partner through oral sex is much less than the risk of HIV transmission from anal or vaginal sex," but that "measuring the exact risk of HIV transmission as a result of oral sex is very difficult" and that this is "because most sexually active individuals practice oral sex in addition to other forms of sex, such as vaginal and/or anal sex, when transmission occurs, it is difficult to determine whether or not it occurred as a result of oral sex or other more risky sexual activities". They added that "several co-factors may increase the risk of HIV transmission through oral sex"; this includes ulcers, [[Bleeding on probing|bleeding gums]], genital sores, and the presence of other STIs.&lt;ref name="CDC, oral sex"/&gt;

In 1991, scholars from the Kinsey Institute stated, "The truth is that the time between penetration and ejaculation varies not only from man to man, but from one time to the next for the same man." They added that the appropriate length for sexual intercourse is the length of time it takes for both partners to be mutually satisfied, emphasizing that [[Alfred Kinsey|Kinsey]] "found that 75 percent of men ejaculated within two minutes of penetration.

[[Vaginismus]] is involuntary tensing of the pelvic floor musculature, making coitus, or any form of penetration of the vagina, distressing, painful and sometimes impossible for women. It is a conditioned reflex of the pubococcygeus muscle, and is sometimes referred to as the ''PC muscle.''

Sexual intercourse remains possible after major medical treatment of the reproductive organs and structures. This is especially true for women. Even after extensive gynecological surgical procedures (such as [[hysterectomy]], [[oophorectomy]], [[salpingectomy]], [[dilation and curettage]], [[hymenotomy]], [[Bartholin gland]] surgery, abscess removal, [[vestibulectomy]], [[labia minora]] reduction, [[cervical conization]], [[Surgery|surgical]] and radiological cancer treatments and chemotherapy), coitus can continue. Reconstructive surgery remains an option for women who have experienced benign and malignant conditions.&lt;ref name="Hoffman2012"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hoffman | first = Barbara | title = Williams gynecology | edition = 2nd | publisher = McGraw-Hill Medical |page=65 |location = New York | year = 2012 | isbn = 0071716726 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--pages 1020-1348--&gt;

===Disabilities and other complications===
{{main| Sexuality and disability}}

Obstacles that those with [[disabilities]] face with regard to engaging in sexual intercourse include pain, [[Depression (mood)|depression]], fatigue, [[negative body image]], stiffness, functional impairment, anxiety, reduced [[libido]], hormonal imbalance, and drug treatment or side effects. Sexual functioning has been regularly identified as a neglected area of the quality of life in patients with [[rheumatoid arthritis]].&lt;ref name="Tristano2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tristano|first1=Antonio G|title=Impact of rheumatoid arthritis on sexual function|journal=World Journal of Orthopedics|volume=5|issue=2|year=2014|page=107|issn=2218-5836|doi=10.5312/wjo.v5.i2.107}}&lt;/ref&gt; For those that must take opioids for pain control, sexual intercourse can become more difficult.&lt;ref name="DeyoVon Korff2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Deyo|first1=R.

The [[mentally disabled]] also are subject to challenges in participating in sexual intercourse. Women with Intellectual disabilities (ID) are often presented with situations that prevent sexual intercourse. This can include the lack of a knowledgeable healthcare provider trained and experienced in counseling those with ID on sexual intercourse.  Those with ID may have hesitations regarding the discussion of the topic of sex, a lack of sexual knowledge and limited opportunities for sex education.  In addition there are other barriers such as a higher prevalence of sexual abuse and assault.  These crimes often remain underreported.  There remains a lack of "dialogue around this population's human right to consensual sexual expression, undertreatment of menstrual disorders, and legal and systemic barriers". Women with ID may lack sexual health care and sex education.  They may not recognize sexual abuse. Consensual sexual intercourse is not always an option for some.  Those with ID may have limited knowledge and access to contraception, screening for sexually transmitted infections and cervical cancer.&lt;ref name="GreenwoodWilkinson2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Greenwood|first1=Nechama W.|last2=Wilkinson|first2=Joanne|title=Sexual and Reproductive Health Care for Women with Intellectual Disabilities: A Primary Care Perspective|journal=International Journal of Family Medicine|volume=2013|year=2013|pages=1–8|issn=2090-2042|doi=10.1155/2013/642472}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social effects==

===Adults===
Some researchers, such as [[Alex Comfort]], posit three potential advantages or social effects of sexual intercourse in humans, which are not mutually exclusive; these are reproductive, relational, and recreational.&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Comfort"&gt;{{cite book|last=Comfort|first=Alex|authorlink = Alex Comfort|title = The New Joy of Sex: A Gourmet Guide to Lovemaking | publisher = Diane Publishing Company | year = 1991 | pages = 253 pages| accessdate = August 16, 2013 |isbn = 0756783526| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=nfijPQAACAAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the development of the birth control pill and other highly effective forms of contraception in the mid to late 20th century increased people's ability to segregate these three functions, they still significantly overlap and in complex patterns. For example: A fertile couple may have sexual intercourse while contracepting not only to experience sexual pleasure (recreational), but also as a means of emotional intimacy (relational), thus deepening their bonding, making their relationship more stable and more capable of sustaining children in the future (deferred reproductive). This couple may emphasize different aspects of sexual intercourse on different occasions, being playful during one episode of sexual intercourse (recreational), experiencing deep emotional connection on another occasion (relational), and later, after discontinuing contraception, seeking to achieve pregnancy (reproductive, or more likely reproductive and relational).&lt;ref name="Comfort"/&gt;

[[Sexual dissatisfaction]] due to the lack of sexual intercourse is associated with increased risk of [[divorce]] and relationship dissolution, especially for men.&lt;ref name="Munck"&gt;{{cite book| author = Victor C.

For women, there is often a complaint about the lack of their spouses' sexual spontaneity. Decreased sexual activity among these women may be the result of their perceived failure to maintain ideal [[physical attractiveness]] or because their sexual partners' health issues have hindered sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="Montemurro"&gt;{{cite book| author = Beth Montemurro|title =Deserving Desire: Women's Stories of Sexual Evolution|publisher = [[Rutgers University Press]] | year = 2014 | page = 169 | accessdate = December 9, 2014 |isbn = 0813573068| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=1XVYBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some women express that their most satisfying sexual experiences entail being connected to someone, rather than solely basing satisfaction on orgasm.&lt;ref name="Wincze"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gurian"&gt;{{cite book| author = Michael Gurian|title =The Wonder of Aging: A New Approach to Embracing Life After Fifty|publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] | year = 2013 | page = 178 | accessdate = December 9, 2014 |isbn = 1476706719| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=XyS5ebuXJWgC&amp;pg=PT178}}&lt;/ref&gt; With regard to divorce, women are more likely to divorce their spouses for a [[one-night stand]] or various infidelities if they are in less cooperative or high-conflict marriages.&lt;ref name="Fine"/&gt;

Research additionally indicates that non-married couples who are [[cohabiting]] engage in sexual intercourse more often than married couples, and are more likely to participate in sexual activity outside of their sexual relationships; this may be due to the "[[honeymoon]]" effect (the newness or novelty of sexual intercourse with the partner), since sexual intercourse is usually practiced less the longer a couple is married, with couples engaging in sexual intercourse or other sexual activity once or twice a week, or approximately six to seven times a month.&lt;ref name="Strong2"&gt;{{cite book| author = Bryan Strong| author2 = Theodore Cohen|title =The Marriage and Family Experience: Intimate Relationships in a Changing Society|publisher = [[Cengage Learning]] | year = 2013 | page = 212 | accessdate = December 9, 2014 |isbn =1285531892| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZIWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT237}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sexuality in older age]] also affects the frequency of sexual intercourse, as older people generally engage in sexual intercourse less frequently than younger people do.&lt;ref name="Strong2"/&gt;

===Adolescents===
{{Main|Adolescent sexuality}}
Adolescents commonly use sexual intercourse for relational and recreational purposes, which may negatively or positively impact their lives. For example, while [[teenage pregnancy]] may be welcomed in some cultures, it is also commonly disparaged, and research suggests that the [[Precocious puberty|earlier onset of puberty]] for children puts pressure on children and teenagers to act like adults before they are emotionally or cognitively ready.&lt;ref name="sex lives3"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Sex Lives of Teenagers| isbn=978-0-452-28260-5| last=Ponton| first=Lynn|authorlink=Lynn Ponton| year=2000| page=3| publisher=[[Dutton Publishing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have concluded that engaging in sexual intercourse leaves adolescents, especially girls, with higher levels of stress and depression, and that girls may be likelier to engage in sexual risk (such as sexual intercourse without the use of a condom),&lt;ref name="DiClemente"&gt;{{cite book| author = Ralph J.

Some studies from the 1970s through 1990s suggested an association between [[self-esteem]] and sexual intercourse among adolescents,&lt;ref name="Lerner 2"&gt;{{cite book| first1 = Richard M. | last1 = Lerner | first2 = Daniel F. | last2 = Perkins | name-list-format = vanc |title = Social Interactions in Adolescence and Promoting Positive Social Contributions of Youth| publisher = [[Taylor &amp; Francis]] | year = 1999 | page = 124| accessdate = April 14, 2017 |isbn = 0815332955| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=BunEIQylaJAC&amp;pg=PA124}}&lt;/ref&gt; while other studies, from the 1980s and 1990s, reported that the research generally indicates little or no relationship between self-esteem and sexual activity among adolescents.&lt;ref name=" Kowalski"&gt;{{cite book |vauthors=Kowalski RM, Leary MR |title =The Interface of Social and Clinical Psychology: Key Readings| publisher = [[Psychology Press]] | year = 2004 | page = 121| accessdate = April 14, 2017 |isbn = 1841690872| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=qkEdaQ4heGgC&amp;pg=PA121}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1990s, the evidence mostly supported the latter,&lt;ref name="Kowalski"/&gt; and further research has supported little or no relationship between self-esteem and sexual activity among adolescents.&lt;ref name="Guindon"&gt;{{cite book| author =Mary H.

Psychiatrist [[Lynn Ponton]] wrote, "All adolescents have sex lives, whether they are sexually active with others, with themselves, or seemingly not at all", and that viewing adolescent sexuality as a potentially positive experience, rather than as something inherently dangerous, may help young people develop healthier patterns and make more positive choices regarding sexual activity.&lt;ref name="sex lives3" /&gt; Researchers state that long-term romantic relationships allow adolescents to gain the skills necessary for high-quality relationships later in life.&lt;ref&gt;Madsen S., Collins W.

While sexual intercourse, as coitus, is the natural mode of reproduction for the human species, humans have intricate moral and ethical guidelines which regulate the practice of sexual intercourse and vary according to [[religion and sexuality|religious]] and governmental laws. Some governments and religions also have strict designations of "appropriate" and "inappropriate" sexual behavior, which include restrictions on the types of sex acts which are permissible. A historically prohibited or regulated sex act is anal sex.&lt;ref&gt;William N. Eskridge Jr. Dishonorable Passions: Sodomy Laws in America, 1861–2003.

Most countries have [[age of consent]] laws which set the minimum legal age with whom an older person may engage in sexual intercourse, usually set at 16 to 18, but ranges from 12 to 20, years of age. In some societies, an age of consent is set by non-statutory custom or tradition.&lt;ref name="Kinnear"&gt;{{cite book|author=Karen L.

Kalbfleisch and Michael J. Cody stated that this made it so that if "sex means penile-vaginal intercourse, then rape means forced penile-vaginal intercourse, and other sexual behaviors&amp;nbsp;– such as fondling a person's genitals without her or his consent, forced oral sex, and same-sex coercion&amp;nbsp;– are not considered rape"; they stated that "although some other forms of forced sexual contact are included within the legal category of sodomy (e.g., anal penetration and oral-genital contact), many unwanted sexual contacts have no legal grounding as rape in some states".&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch"/&gt; Ken Plumber argued that the legal meaning "of rape in most countries is unlawful sexual intercourse which means the penis must penetrate the vagina" and that "other forms of sexual violence towards women such as forced oral sex or anal intercourse, or the insertion of other objects into the vagina, constitute the 'less serious' crime of sexual assault".&lt;ref name="Plummer"/&gt;

Over time, the meaning of rape broadened in some parts of the world to include many types of sexual penetration, including anal intercourse, fellatio, cunnilingus, and penetration of the genitals or rectum by an inanimate object.&lt;ref name="Francoeur"/&gt; Until 2012, the [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) still considered rape a crime solely committed by men against women. In 2012, they changed the meaning from "The carnal knowledge of a female forcibly and against her will" to "The penetration, no matter how slight, of the vagina or anus with any body part or object, or oral penetration by a sex organ of another person, without the consent of the victim." The meaning does not change federal or state criminal codes or impact charging and prosecution on the federal, state or local level, but instead assures that rape will be more accurately reported nationwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |title=An Updated Definition of Rape (U.S. Dept of Justice, January 6, 2012) |publisher= |accessdate=October 30, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120313021145/http://blogs.usdoj.gov/blog/archives/1801 |archivedate=March 13, 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/01/07/us/politics/federal-crime-statistics-to-expand-rape-definition.html|title=U.S. to Expand Rape Definition in Crime Statistics (New York Times, January 6, 2012)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some instances, penetration is not required for the act to be categorized as rape.&lt;ref name="Book04"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last=Smith |editor-first=Merril D. |title=Encyclopedia of rape |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Press |location=Westport, Conn. |isbn=978-0-313-32687-5 |pages=169–170 |edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In most societies around the world, the concept of [[incest]] exists and is criminalized. James Roffee, a senior lecturer in criminology at [[Monash University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://monash.edu/research/explore/en/persons/james-roffee(896c15d7-6f28-4bf0-8a0f-b7d6ff1553e0).html|title=Dr James Roffee|publisher=Monash university|access-date=May 22, 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204003059/http://monash.edu/research/explore/en/persons/james-roffee%28896c15d7-6f28-4bf0-8a0f-b7d6ff1553e0%29.html|archive-date=February 4, 2017|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; addressed potential harm associated with familial sexual activity, such as resulting children born with deficiencies. However, the law is more concerned with protecting the rights of people who are potentially subjected to such abuse. This is why familial sexual relationships are criminalized, even if all parties are consensual. There are laws prohibiting all kinds of sexual activity between relatives, not necessarily penetrative sex. These laws refer to grandparents, parents, children, siblings, aunts and uncles. There are differences between states in terms of the severity of punishments and what they consider to be a relative, including biological parents, step-parents, adoptive parents and half-siblings.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|doi=10.1093/hrlr/ngu023]|title=Roffee, J.

====Marriage and relationships====
Sexual intercourse has traditionally been considered an essential part of a marriage, with many religious customs requiring [[consummation]] of the marriage and citing marriage as the most appropriate union for sexual reproduction (procreation).&lt;!-- NOTE: This is also sourced in the bullet-point examples list below.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogan"&gt;{{cite book| author =Margaret Monahan Hogan|title =Marriage as a Relationship: Real and Rational|publisher = [[Marquette University Press]] | year = 2002 | page = 88 | accessdate = September 1, 2015 |isbn = 0874626579| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=HuztAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Marriage+as+a+Relationship:+Real+and+Rational}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cases, a failure for any reason to consummate the marriage would be considered a ground for [[annulment]] (which does not require a divorce process). Sexual relations between marriage partners have been a "marital right" in various societies and religions, both historically and in modern times, especially with regard to a husband's rights to his wife.&lt;ref name="Dwyer"&gt;{{cite book| author =James G.

[[Adultery]] (engaging in sexual intercourse with someone other than one's spouse) has been, and remains, a criminal offense in some jurisdictions.&lt;ref name="Brundage"&gt;{{cite book| author =James A.

Dwyer stated that no-fault divorce laws "have made it much easier for a woman to exit a marital relationship, and wives have obtained greater control over their bodies while in a marriage" because of legislative and judicial changes regarding the concept of a marital exemption when a man rapes his wife.&lt;ref name="Dwyer"/&gt;

There are various legal positions regarding the meaning and legality of sexual intercourse between persons of the same sex or gender. For example, in the 2003 [[New Hampshire Supreme Court]] case [[Blanchflower v. Blanchflower]], it was held that female same-sex sexual relations, and same-sex sexual practices in general, did not constitute sexual intercourse, based on a 1961 entry in ''[[Webster's Third New International Dictionary]]'' that categorizes sexual intercourse as coitus; and thereby an accused wife in a divorce case was found not guilty of [[adultery]].&lt;ref name="GLAD, B vs. B"&gt;{{cite web| title=Blanchflower v.

* In [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], or [[Mormonism]], sexual relations within the bonds of matrimony are seen as sacred.

In Shi'ia Islam, men are allowed to enter into an unlimited number of temporary marriages, which are contracted to last for a period of minutes to multiple years and permit sexual intercourse. Sunni women are allowed to enter only one marriage permanently at a time whereas Shi'ia women both temporary or permanent. 
* [[Hinduism]] has varied views about sexuality, but Hindu society, in general, perceives [[extramarital sex]] to be immoral and shameful.&lt;ref name=columbia&gt;Don S.

* [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ethics, in its most general formulation, holds that one should neither be attached to nor crave sensual pleasure since it binds one to the cycle of birth and death, [[samsara]], and prevents one attaining the goal of [[Nirvana]]. Since Buddhist monastics (i.e. [[bhikshu]]s and [[bhikshuni]]s) are to be fully dedicated towards this goal, they undertake the training rule of total abstinence from sexual intercourse, i.e. of celibacy. Other monastic training rules from the Code of Discipline ([[Patimokkha]] or Pratimoksasutra) and canonical [[Vinaya]] scriptures are to prevent masturbation, lustfully touching and speaking to members of the other sex, and other forms of sexual behaviour. Buddhist lay people undertake the [[Five Precepts]], the third of which is avoiding sexual misconduct. Peter Harvey says that this precept "relates primarily to the avoidance of causing suffering by one's sexual behaviour. Adultery—'going with the wife of another'—is the most straightforward breach of this precept. The wrongness of this is seen as partly in terms of its being an expression of greed, and partly in terms of its harm to others. It is said that a man breaks the precept if he has intercourse with women who are engaged, or who are still protected by any relative, or young girls not protected by a relative, Clearly, rape and incest are breaches of the precept."&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues''. Cambridge, 2000: 71-72.&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddhist Canonical scriptures contain no other regulations or recommendations for lay people—for example, with regards homosexuality, masturbation, sexual practices and contraceptives. However, in keeping with the Buddhist ethical principles of not-harming and avoiding shame, guilt and remorse, socially taboo forms of sexuality as well as obsessive sexual activities can also be seen as being included in the third precept. Later Buddhist authors such as [[Nagarjuna]] give various clarifications and recommendations.&lt;ref&gt;Harvey, Peter. ''An Introduction to Buddhist Ethics: Foundations, Values and Issues''.

In some cases, the sexual intercourse between two people is seen as counter to religious law or doctrine. In many religious communities, including the [[Catholic Church]] and [[Bhikkhu|Mahayana Buddhists]], religious leaders are expected to refrain from sexual intercourse in order to devote their full attention, energy, and loyalty to their religious duties.&lt;ref&gt;William Skudlarek.

In [[zoology]], ''copulation'' often means the process in which a male introduces sperm into the female's body, especially directly into her reproductive tract.&lt;ref name="Kent"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Copulation1"/&gt; [[Spider]]s have separate male and female sexes. Before mating and copulation, the male spider spins a small web and ejaculates on to it. He then stores the sperm in reservoirs on his large [[pedipalp]]s, from which he transfers sperm to the female's genitals. The females can store sperm indefinitely.&lt;ref name="RFB2004Spiders"&gt;{{cite book | author=Ruppert, E.E. | author2=Fox, R.S. | author3=Barnes, R.D. | last-author-amp=yes | title=Invertebrate Zoology | publisher=Brooks/Cole| edition=7th|isbn=0-03-025982-7| year=2004|pages=571–584 | chapter=Chelicerata: Araneae}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many animals that live in water use [[external fertilization]], whereas [[internal fertilization]] may have developed from a need to maintain [[gamete]]s in a liquid medium in the [[Late Ordovician]] epoch. Internal fertilization with many vertebrates (such as [[reptile]]s, some [[fish]], and most [[bird]]s) occur via [[cloaca]]l copulation (see also [[hemipenis]]), while [[mammal]]s copulate vaginally, and many [[primitive (biology)|basal]] [[vertebrate]]s reproduce sexually with external fertilization.&lt;ref name="Starr"&gt;{{cite book| author =Cecie Starr| author2 =Christine Evers| author3 =Lisa Starr|title=Cengage Advantage Books: Biology: A Human Emphasis|publisher =[[Cengage Learning]]| year = 2010 | pages = 630–631| accessdate = December 9, 2010 |isbn =1133170056| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=DdU8AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA631}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Denecke"&gt;{{cite book| author =Edward J.

For primitive [[insect]]s, the male deposits [[spermatozoon|spermatozoa]] on the substrate, sometimes stored within a special structure; [[courtship]] involves inducing the female to take up the sperm package into her genital opening, but there is no actual copulation.&lt;ref name="Yadav"&gt;{{cite book| author =M.

In dragonflies, it is a set of modified [[Sternum (arthropod anatomy)|sternites]] on the second abdominal segment.&lt;ref name="Leonard"&gt;{{cite book| author =Janet Leonard| author2 =Alex Cordoba-Aguilar|title=The Evolution of Primary Sexual Characters in Animals|publisher =[[Oxford University Press]]| year = 2010 | page =334| accessdate = December 9, 2014 |isbn = 0199717036| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=PgtXj5R6OfMC&amp;pg=PA334}}&lt;/ref&gt; In advanced groups of insects, the male uses its [[aedeagus]], a structure formed from the terminal segments of the abdomen, to deposit sperm directly (though sometimes in a capsule called a ''[[spermatophore]]'') into the female's reproductive tract.&lt;ref name="Gullan"&gt;{{cite book| author =P.

Bonobos, chimpanzees and dolphins are species known to engage in heterosexual behaviors even when the female is not in estrus, which is a point in her reproductive cycle suitable for successful impregnation. These species are also known to [[Homosexual behavior in animals|engage in same-sex sexual behaviors]].&lt;ref name="Non-human"/&gt; In these animals, the use of sexual intercourse has evolved beyond reproduction&lt;ref name="wunsch2017"/&gt; to apparently serve additional social functions (such as bonding).&lt;ref name="Diamond"/&gt;

{{short description|set of 17 global development goals defined by the United Nations for the year 2030}}
[[File:UN SDG Logo.png|thumb|The Sustainable Development Goals are a UN Initiative.|269x269px]]{{redirect|SDG}}

'''Sustainable Development Goals''' ('''SDGs''') (or '''Global Goals for Sustainable Development''', the '''17 Global Goals'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;, the '''Global Goals'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt; or simply '''the Goals"'''&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals/&lt;/ref&gt;) are a collection of 17 global goals set by the United Nations General Assembly in 2015. The SDGs are part of Resolution 70/1 of the United Nations General Assembly&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E&lt;/ref&gt;: "Transforming our World: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development." That has been shortened to "'''2030 Agenda'''."&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/post2015/transformingourworld|title=Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development|website=United Nations – Sustainable Development knowledge platform|accessdate=23 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals are broad and interdependent, yet each has a separate list of targets to achieve. Achieving all 169 targets would signal accomplishing all 17 goals. The SDGs cover social and economic development issues including [[poverty]], [[hunger]], [[health]], [[education]], [[global warming]], [[gender equality]], [[Water supply|water,]] [[sanitation]], [[energy]], [[urbanization]], [[Environmental protection|environment]] and [[social justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/4538pressowg13.pdf|title=Press release – UN General Assembly’s Open Working Group proposes sustainable development goals|date=19 July 2014|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|format=PDF|accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paragraph 54 of [[ the United Nations]] [[UNGA|General Assembly]] Resolution A/RES/70/1 of 25 September 2015 contains the goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/RES/70/1&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=Un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UN-led process involved its 193 [[Member states of the United Nations|Member States]] and global [[civil society]]. The resolution is a broad intergovernmental agreement that acts as the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]. The SDGs build on the principles agreed upon in Resolution A/RES/66/288, entitled "The Future We Want".&lt;ref name="United Nations Official Document"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://templatelab.com/rio-20-summit-the-future-we-want/ |title=United Nations Official Document |website=Un.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was a non-binding document released as a result of [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20 Conference]] held in 2012.&lt;ref name="United Nations Official Document"/&gt;

Implementation as of 2016 is described as "Localizing the SDGs" to highlight the role of local institutions and local actors.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Regional efforts included agreements like the [[Baltic 21|Baltic 2030 Action Plan]]&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;. Some remain pessimistic about the potential for achieving the SDGs, especially because of estimates of the cost of achieving all 17.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt;  However, progress had been reported by 2018. For example, fewer African children under the age of 5 are suffering from [[Stunted growth|stunting]] and wasting. However, the same study concluded that it is unlikely there will be an end to [[malnutrition]] by 2030.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;   {{TOC limit|3}}

In 1972, governments met in Stockholm, Sweden, for the [[United Nations Conference on the Human Environment]], to consider the rights of the family to a healthy and productive environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The History of Sustainable Development in the United Nations |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120618171731/http://www.uncsd2012.org/history.html |website=Rio+20 UN Conference on Sustainable Development |publisher=UN |accessdate=27 October 2018 |date=20-22 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1983, the United Nations created the [[Brundtland Commission|World Commission on Environment and Development]] (later known as the Brundtland Commission), which defined sustainable development as "meeting the needs of the present without compromising the ability of future generations to meet their own needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.un-documents.net/ocf-02.htm|title=Our Common Future, Chapter 2: Towards Sustainable Development - A/42/427 Annex, Chapter 2 - UN Documents: Gathering a body of global agreements|last=Development|first=World Commission on Environment and|website=www.un-documents.net|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, the first [[United Nations Conference on Environment and Development]] (UNCED) or Earth Summit was held in Rio de Janeiro, where the first agenda for Environment and Development, also known as Agenda 21, was developed and adopted.

In 2012, the United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development (UNCSD), also known as [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development|Rio+20]], was held as a 20-year follow up to UNCED. Colombia proposed the idea of the SDGs at a preparation event for Rio+20 held in Indonesia in July 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://deliver2030.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/A-short-history-of-the-SDGs-Paula-Caballero.pdf|title=A Short History of the SDGs|last=Caballero|first=Paula|date=April 29, 2016|website=Deliver 2030|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171118221940/http://deliver2030.org/wp%2Dcontent/uploads/2016/04/A%2Dshort%2Dhistory%2Dof%2Dthe%2DSDGs%2DPaula%2DCaballero.pdf|archive-date=2017-11-18|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2011, this idea was picked up by the [[United Nations Department of Public Information]] 64th NGO Conference in Bonn, Germany. The outcome document proposed 17 sustainable development goals and associated targets. In the run-up to Rio+20 there was much discussion about the idea of the SDGs. At the Rio+20 Conference, a resolution known as "The Future We Want" was reached by member states.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/futurewewant.html|title=Future We Want – Outcome document .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the key themes agreed on were poverty eradication, energy, water and sanitation, health, and human settlement.

The Rio+20 outcome document mentioned that “at the outset, the OWG [Open Working Group] will decide on its methods of work, including developing modalities to ensure the full involvement of relevant stakeholders and expertise from civil society, the scientific community and the United Nations system in its work, in order to provide a diversity of perspectives and experience”.&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt;

In January 2013, the 30-member UN General Assembly Open Working Group on Sustainable Development Goals was established to identify specific goals for the SDGs. The Open Working Group (OWG) was tasked with preparing a proposal on the SDGs for consideration during the 68th session of the General Assembly, September 2013 – September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/News/Press/docs/2013/ga11339.doc.htm |title=New Open Working Group to Propose Sustainable Development Goals for Action by General Assembly’s Sixty-eighth Session &amp;#124; Meetings Coverage and Press Releases |website=Un.org |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 19 July 2014, the OWG forwarded a proposal for the SDGs to the Assembly. After 13 sessions, the OWG submitted their proposal of 17 SDGs and 169 targets to the 68th session of the General Assembly in September 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdgsproposal|title=Home .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=Sustainabledevelopment.un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 5 December 2014, the UN General Assembly accepted the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|Secretary General]]'s Synthesis Report, which stated that the agenda for the post-2015 SDG process would be based on the OWG proposals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/700&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations Official Document|website=Un.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ban Ki-moon]], the [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|United Nations Secretary-General]] from 2007 to 2016, has stated that: "We don’t have plan B because there is no planet B!."&lt;ref name="UN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/blog/2016/11/secretary-generals-remarks-to-the-press-at-cop22/|title=Secretary-General’s remarks to the press at COP22|date=15 November 2016|website=UN|accessdate=20 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{When|date=November 2018}} This thought has guided the development of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs).{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

The [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] was a process from 2012 to 2015 led by the [[United Nations]] to define the future global development framework that would succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]]. The SDGs were developed to succeed the [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) which ended in 2015. The gaps and shortcomings of MDG Goal 8 (To develop a global partnership for development) led to identifying a problematic "donor-recipient" relationship.&lt;ref name="post-2015"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/policy/untaskteam_undf/report2.shtml|title=Report of the UN System Task Team on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda|author=UN Task Team on the Post 2015 Agenda|year=March 2013|publisher=United Nations|page=1|accessdate=July 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, the new SDGs favor collective action by all countries.&lt;ref name="post-2015"/&gt;

=== Ratification ===
Negotiations on the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] began in January 2015 and ended in August 2015. The negotiations ran in parallel to United Nations negotiations on Financing for Development, which determined the financial means of implementing the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]]; those negotiations resulted in adoption of the [[Addis Ababa Action Agenda]] in July 2015. A final document was adopted at the UN Sustainable Development Summit in September 2015 in New York City, USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/pressreleases/2015/09/24/undp-welcomes-adoption-of-sustainable-development-goals-by-world-leaders.html|title=World leaders adopt Sustainable Development Goals|website=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 25 September 2015, the 193 countries of the UN General Assembly adopted the 2030 Development Agenda titled "Transforming our world: the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development".&lt;ref name=":3"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/09/26/world/breakdown-of-un-sustainable-development-goals.html?_r=0|title=Breakdown of U.N.

Implementation of the SDGs started worldwide in 2016. This process can also be called "Localizing the SDGs". All over the planet, individual people, universities, governments and institutions and organizations of all kinds work on several goals at the same time.&lt;ref name="globalcitizen.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/# |title=Archived copy |access-date=28 June 2017 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170702204256/https://www.globalcitizen.org/en/global-goals/# |archive-date=2 July 2017 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In each country, governments must translate the goals into national legislation, develop a plan of action, establish budgets and at the same time be open to and actively search for partners. Poor countries need the support of rich countries and coordination at the international level is crucial.&lt;ref name=D+C&gt;{{cite news |title=Global governance for SDGs|url=https://www.dandc.eu/en/article/peer-pressure-can-contribute-achieving-sdgs-more-needed|author=Belay Begashaw|work=D+C, development and cooperation |date=16 April 2017 |accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The independent campaign "Project Everyone" has met some resistance.&lt;ref name=":2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://africaplatform.org/news/why-this-is-sustainable-development-not-global-goals/|title=Why this is Sustainable Development Not Global Goals – Africa Platform|website=Africaplatform.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, several sections of civil society and governments felt the SDGs ignored "[[sustainability]]" even though it was the most important aspect of the agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicywatch.org/blog/2015/09/25/public-sdgs-or-private-ggs/|title=Public SDGs or Private GGs? – Global Policy Watch|website=Globalpolicywatch.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2018 study in the journal ''Nature'' found that while "nearly all African countries demonstrated improvements for children under 5 years old for stunting, wasting, and underweight... much, if not all of the continent will fail to meet the Sustainable Development Goal target—to end malnutrition by 2030."&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osgood-Zimmerman|first=Aaron|last2=Millear|first2=Anoushka I.|last3=Stubbs|first3=Rebecca W.|last4=Shields|first4=Chloe|last5=Pickering|first5=Brandon V.|last6=Earl|first6=Lucas|last7=Graetz|first7=Nicholas|last8=Kinyoki|first8=Damaris K.|last9=Ray|first9=Sarah E.|date=2018|title=Mapping child growth failure in Africa between 2000 and 2015|url=https://www.nature.com/articles/nature25760|journal=Nature|language=En|volume=555|issue=7694|pages=41–47|doi=10.1038/nature25760|issn=1476-4687|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been two books produced one by each of the co-chairs of the negotiations to help people to understand the Sustainable Development Goals and where they came from: "Negotiating the Sustainable Development Goals: A transformational agenda for an insecure world" written by Ambassador David Donoghue, Felix Dodds and Jimena Leiva as well as "Transforming Multilateral Diplomacy: The Inside Story of the Sustainable Development Goals" by Macharia Kamau, David O'Connor and Pamela Chasek. 

===Europe and Russia===
Baltic nations, via the [[Council of the Baltic Sea States]], have created the [[Baltic 21|Baltic 2030 Action Plan]].&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbss.org/sustainable-prosperous-region/egsd-baltic-2030-2/|title=Sustainable Development - Baltic 2030 - cbss.org|work=cbss.org|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] has observed that UK and [[European Union]] [[pension fund|pension investors]] have been at the forefront of ESG-driven asset allocation at home and abroad and [[early adopter]]s of “SDG-centric” investment practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===India===
The [[Government of India]] established the [[NITI Aayog]] to attain the sustainable development goals.&lt;ref name=indgoal1&gt;[http://www.looppng.com/business/businesses-india-keen-govt-delegation-71103 Business in India keen: delegation] Dec 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2018 Haryana became the first state in India to have its annual budget focused on the attainment of SDG with a 3-year action plan and a 7-year strategy plan to implement sustainable development goals when [[Captain Abhimanyu]], Finance Minister of [[Government of Haryana]], unveiled a {{INRConvert|1151980|m|currency_formatting=c|lk=on|to=USD EUR|year=2018}} annual 2018-19 budget.&lt;ref name=ungoal1&gt;[Haryana Budget 2018 Presented by Captain Abhimanyu: Highlights Haryana Budget 2018 Presented by Captain Abhimanyu: Highlights], India.com, 9 Mar 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public engagement ==
[[File:SDG-pyramid.jpg|thumb|A proposal to visualize the 17 SDGs in a thematic pyramid.]]
UN agencies which are part of the [[United Nations Development Group]] decided to support an independent campaign to communicate the new SDGs to a wider audience. This campaign, "Project Everyone," had the support of corporate institutions and other international organizations.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.project-everyone.org/|title=Project Everyone|website=Project-everyone.org|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the text drafted by diplomats at the UN level, a team of communication specialists developed icons for every goal.&lt;ref&gt;https://sites.google.com/site/myagenda21org/the-post-2015-sustainable-development-goals&lt;/ref&gt; They also shortened the title "The 17 Sustainable Development Goals" to "[[Global Goals]]/17#GlobalGoals," then ran workshops and conferences to communicate the Global Goals to a global audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thenewdivision.world/global-goals-branding|title=the-new-division|website=the-new-division|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.good.is/slideshows/designing-the-global-goals-for-everyone|title=How This Great Design Is Bringing World Change to the Masses|date=2015-09-24|work=GOOD Magazine|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://globalfestivalofideas.org/|title=Global Festival of Action – Global Festival of Action|website=globalfestivalofideas.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

An early concern was that 17 goals would be too much for people to grasp and that therefore the SDGs would fail to get a wider recognition.{{When|date=November 2018}} That without wider recognition the necessary momentum to achieve them by 2030 would not be archived. Concerned with this, British film-maker [[Richard Curtis]] started the organization in 2015 called Project Everyone with the aim to bring the goals to everyone on the planet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.project-everyone.org/ Project Everyone&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://sdg.iisd.org/commentary/guest-articles/making-the-sdgs-famous-and-popular/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://beta.companieshouse.gov.uk/company/09382406&lt;/ref&gt; Curtis approached Swedish designer [[sv:Jakob Trollbäck]] who rebranded them as The Global Goals and created the 17 iconic visuals with clear short names as well as a logotype for the whole initiative. The communication system is available for free.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.globalgoals.org/resources&lt;/ref&gt; In 2018 Jakob Trollbäck and his company The New Division  went on to extend the communication system to also include the 169 targets that describe how the goals can be achieved.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thenewdivision.world&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Le Temps Presse festival ===
The annual "Le Temps Presse" festival in [[Paris]] utilizes cinema to sensitize the public, especially young people, to the Sustainable Development Goals. The origin of the festival was in 2010 when eight directors produced a film titled "8," which included eight short films, each featuring one of the Millennium Development Goals. After 2.5 million viewers saw "8" on YouTube, the festival was created. It now showcases young directors whose work promotes social, environmental and human commitment. The festival now focuses on the Sustainable Development Goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.letempspresse.org/fr/le-festival/|title=Le Temps Presse|last=|first=|date=15 November 2017|website=Le Temps Presse|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==17 goals==
There are 169 targets for the 17 goals. Each target has between 1 and 3 indicators used to measure progress toward reaching the targets. In total, there are 304 indicators that will measure compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/6754Technical%20report%20of%20the%20UNSC%20Bureau%20%28final%29.pdf|title=Technical report by the Bureau of the United Nations Statistical Commission (UNSC) on the process of the development of an indicator framework for the goals and targets of the post-2015 development agenda – working draft|date=March 2015|accessdate=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[United Nations Development Programme]] has been asked to provide easy to understand lists of targets and facts and figures for each of the 17 SDGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/ga/search/view_doc.asp?symbol=A/69/L.85&amp;Lang=E|title=United Nations General Assembly Draft outcome document of the United Nations summit for the adoption of the post-2015 development agenda|website=UN|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 17 goals listed below as sub-headings use the 2-to-4 word phrases that identify each goal. Directly below each goal, in quotation marks, is the exact wording of the goal in one sentence. The paragraphs that follow present some information about a few targets and indicators related to each goal.

[[File:Sustainable Development Goals chart.svg|thumb|787x787px|A diagram listing the 17 Sustainable Development Goals|center]]

=== Goal 1: No poverty ===

==== "End poverty in all its forms everywhere."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-1-no-poverty.html|title=Goal 1: No poverty|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[Extreme poverty]] has been cut by more than half since 1990. Still, more than 1 in 5 people live on less than the target figure of US$1.25 per day. That target may not be adequate for human [[subsistence]], however. Some suggest it may be necessary to raise the [[Poverty threshold|poverty line]] figure to as high as $5 per day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2015/08/global-poverty-climate-change-sdgs/|title=The Problem with Saving the World {{!}} Jacobin|website=www.jacobinmag.com|access-date=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poverty is more than the lack of income or resources. People live in poverty if they lack basic services such as healthcare, security, and education. They also experience hunger, social [[discrimination]], and exclusion from decision-making processes.

Children make up the majority – more than half – of those living in extreme poverty. In 2013, an estimated 385 million children lived on less than US$1.90 per day. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress For Every Child in the SDG Era|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, these figures are unreliable due to huge gaps in data on the status of children worldwide. On average, 97 percent of countries have insufficient data to determine the state of impoverished children and make projections towards SDG Goal 1, and 63 percent of countries have no data on child poverty at all. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress For Every Child in the SDG Era|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women face potentially life-threatening risks from early [[pregnancy]] and frequent pregnancies. This can result in lost hope for an education and for a better income.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018}} Poverty affects age groups differently, with the most devastating effects experienced by children. It affects their education, health, nutrition, and security, impacting emotional and spiritual development.

Achieving Goal 1 is hampered by growing inequality, increasingly [[Fragile state|fragile statehood]], and the impacts of [[Global warming|climate change]].&lt;ref name="D+C/E+Z"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dandc.eu/en/article/eradicate-extreme-poverty-ultra-poor-need-be-reached|title=Programmes for the poorest of the poor|author=Jörn Geisselmann|date=29 April 2017|work=D+C, development and cooperation|accessdate=14 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 2: Zero hunger ===
==== "[[Hunger#Global initiatives to end hunger|End hunger]], achieve [[food security]] and improved nutrition, and promote [[sustainable agriculture]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-2-zero-hunger.html|title=Goal 2: Zero hunger|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====

Goal 2 states that by 2030 we should end hunger and all forms of malnutrition. This would be accomplished by doubling agricultural productivity and incomes of small-scale food producers (especially women and indigenous peoples), by ensuring sustainable food production systems, and by progressively improving land and soil quality. Agriculture is the single largest employer in the world, providing livelihoods for 40% of the global population. It is the largest source of income for poor rural households. Women make up about 43% of the agricultural labor force in [[Developing country|developing countries]], and over 50% in parts of Asia and Africa. However, women own only 20% of the land.

Other targets deal with maintaining genetic diversity of seeds, increasing access to land, preventing trade restriction and distortions in world agricultural markets to limit extreme food price volatility, eliminating waste with help from the International Food Waste Coalition, and ending malnutrition and undernutrition of children.

Globally, 1 in 9 people are undernourished, the vast majority of whom live in developing countries. Undernutrition causes wasting or severe wasting of 52 million children worldwide,&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and contributes to nearly half (45%) of deaths in children under five – 3.1 million children per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/130565-1.pdf|title=From Promise to Impact: Ending malnutrition by 2030|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chronic malnutrition, which affects an estimated 155 million children worldwide, also stunts children's brain and physical development and puts them at further risk of death, disease, and lack of success as adults. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2017, only 26 of 202 UN member countries are on track to meet the SDG target to eliminate undernourishment and malnourishment, while 20 percent have made no progress at all and nearly 70 percent have no or insufficient data to determine their progress. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://data.unicef.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Progress_for_Every_Child_V4.pdf|title=Progress for Every Child in the SDG Era|website=UNICEF|accessdate=2 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) of 2013 stated that the emphasis of the SDGs should not be on ending poverty by 2030, but on eliminating hunger and under-nutrition by 2025.&lt;ref name="IFPRI2013"&gt;Fan, Shenggen and Polman, Paul. 2014. [http://ebrary.ifpri.org/cdm/ref/collection/p15738coll2/id/128045 An ambitious development goal: Ending hunger and undernutrition by 2025]. In 2013 Global food policy report. Eds. Marble, Andrew and Fritschel, Heidi. Chapter 2. Pp 15-28. Washington, D.C.: International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI).&lt;/ref&gt; The assertion is based on an analysis of experiences in China, Vietnam, Brazil, and Thailand. Three pathways to achieve this were identified: 1) agriculture-led; 2) social protection- and nutrition- intervention-led; or 3) a combination of both of these approaches.&lt;ref name="IFPRI2013"/&gt;

=== Goal 3: Good health and well-being for people ===
==== "Ensure healthy lives and promote well-being for all at all ages."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-3-good-health-and-well-being.html|title=Goal 3: Good health and well-being|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Significant strides have been made in increasing life expectancy and reducing some of the common killers associated with [[Child mortality|child]] and [[Maternal death|maternal mortality]]. Between 2000 and 2016, the worldwide under-five mortality rate decreased by 47 percent (from 78 deaths per 1,000 live births to 41 deaths per 1,000 live births).&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Still, the number of children dying under age five is extremely high: 5.6 million in 2016 alone.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Newborns account for a growing number of these deaths, and poorer children are at the greatest risk of under-5 mortality due to a number of factors.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; SDG Goal 3 aims to reduce under-five mortality to at least as low as 25 per 1,000 live births. But if current trends continue, more than 60 countries will miss the SDG neonatal mortality target for 2030. About half of these countries would not reach the target even by 2050. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; 

Goal 3 also aims to reduce maternal mortality to less than 70 deaths per 100,000 live births.&lt;ref name="who.int"&gt;http://www.who.int/mediacentre/events/meetings/2015/un-sustainable-development-summit/en/&lt;/ref&gt; Though the maternal mortality ratio declined by 37 percent between 2000 and 2015, there were approximately 303,000 maternal deaths worldwide in 2015, most from preventable causes.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; In 2015, maternal health conditions were also the leading cause of death among girls aged 15-19. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Data for girls of greatest concern – those aged between 10-14 - is currently unavailable. Key strategies for meeting SDG Goal 3 will be to reduce adolescent pregnancy (which is strongly linked to gender equality), provide better data for all women and girls, and achieve universal coverage of skilled birth attendants.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Similarly, progress has been made on increasing access to clean water and sanitation and on reducing [[malaria]], [[tuberculosis]], [[Poliomyelitis|polio]], and the spread of [[HIV/AIDS]].  From 2000-2016, new HIV infections declined by 66 percent for children under 15 and by 45 percent among adolescents aged 15-19.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; However, current trends mean that 1 out of 4 countries still won't meet the SDG target to end AIDS among children under 5, and 3 out of 4 will not meet the target to end AIDS among adolescents.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;  Additionally, only half of women in developing countries have received the health care they need, and the need for [[family planning]] is increasing exponentially as the population grows. While needs are being addressed gradually, more than 225 million women have an unmet need for [[Birth control|contraception]].

Goal 3 aims to achieve universal health coverage, including access to essential medicines and vaccines.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; It proposes to end the preventable death of newborns and children under 5 and to end epidemics such as AIDS, tuberculosis, malaria, and water-borne diseases, for example.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt; 2016 rates for the third dose of the pertussis vaccine (DTP3) and the first dose of the measles vaccine (MCV1) reached 86 percent and 85 percent, respectively. Yet about 20 million children did not receive DTP3 and about 21 million did not receive MCV1. &lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Around 2 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress in order to reach SDG targets for immunization.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Attention to health and well-being also includes targets related to the prevention and treatment of [[substance abuse]], deaths and injuries from [[Traffic collision|traffic accidents]] and from hazardous chemicals and air, [[Water pollution|water]] and soil pollution and contamination.&lt;ref name="who.int"/&gt;

=== Goal 4: Quality education ===
==== "Ensure [[inclusion (education)|inclusive]] and [[educational equity|equitable]] quality education and promote [[lifelong learning]] opportunities for all."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-4-quality-education.html|title=Goali 4: Quality education|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Major progress has been made in access to education, specifically at the [[primary school]] level, for both boys and girls. Still, at least 22 million children in 43 countries will miss out on pre-primary education unless the rate of progress doubles.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Access does not always mean quality of education or completion of primary school. 103 million youth worldwide still lack basic literacy skills, and more than 60 percent of those are women.  In one out of four countries, more than half of children failed to meet minimum math proficiency standards at the end of primary school, and at the lower secondary level, the rate was 1 in 3 countries.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Target 1 of Goal 4 is to ensure that, by 2030, all girls and boys complete free, equitable, and quality primary and secondary education.

Additionally, progress is difficult to track: 75 percent of countries have no or insufficient data to track progress towards SDG Goal 4 targets for learning outcomes (target 1), early childhood education (target 2), and effective learning environments.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Data on learning outcomes and pre-primary school are particularly scarce; 70 percent and 40 percent of countries lack adequate data for these targets, respectively.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; This makes it hard to analyze and identify the children at greatest risk of being left behind.

=== Goal 5: Gender equality ===


==== "Achieve [[gender equality]] and [[empowerment|empower]] all women and girls."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-5-gender-equality.html|title=Goal 5: Gender equality|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=13 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
According to the UN, "gender equality is not only a fundamental human right, but a necessary foundation for a peaceful, prosperous and sustainable world."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/gender-equality/|title=United Nations: Gender equality and women's empowerment|work=United Nations Sustainable Development|access-date=2018-02-04|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; Providing women and girls with equal access to education, health care, decent work, and representation in political and economic decision-making processes will nurture sustainable economies and benefit societies and humanity at large. A record 143 countries guaranteed equality between men and women in their constitutions as of 2014. However, another 52 had not taken this step. In many nations, gender discrimination is still woven into the fabric of legal systems and social norms. Even though SDG5 is a stand-alone goal, other SDGs can only be achieved if the needs of women receive the same attention as the needs of men. Issues unique to women and girls include traditional practices against all women and girls in the public and private spheres, such as female genital mutilation.

[[Child marriage]] has declined over the past decades, yet there is no region that is currently on track to eliminate the practice and reach SDG targets by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; If current trends continue, between 2017 and 2030, 150 million girls will be married before they turn 18.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Though child marriages are four times higher among the poorest than the wealthiest in the world, most countries need to accelerate progress among both groups in order to reach the SDG Goal 5 target to eliminate child marriage by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

Achieving gender equality will require enforceable legislation that promotes empowerment of all women and girls and requires secondary education for all girls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sustainable Development Goal 5: Gender equality|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/women-and-the-sdgs/sdg-5-gender-equality|website=UN Women|publisher=UN Women|accessdate=5 August 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The targets call for an end to gender discrimination and for empowering women and girls through technology&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 05. Achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls – Indicators and a Monitoring Framework|url=http://indicators.report/goals/goal-5/|website=indicators.report|publisher=indicators.report|accessdate=5 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some have advocated for "listening to girls". The assertion is that the SDGs can deliver transformative change for girls only if girls are consulted. Their priorities and needs must be taken into account. Girls should be viewed not as beneficiaries of change, but as agents of change. Engaging women and girls in the implementation of the SDGs is crucial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Leach|first1=Anna|title=21 ways the SDGs can have the best impact on girls|url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2015/jun/02/21-ways-the-sdgs-can-have-the-best-impact-on-girls|accessdate=5 August 2017|work=The Guardian|publisher=The Guardian|date=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] has insisted on the transformational role [[Gender diversity|gender-diverse]] that boards can play in that regard, predicting that 2018 could be a pivotal year, as “more than ever before, many UK and European Union [[trustee|pension trustees]] speak enthusiastically about flexing their [[fiduciary]] muscles for the UN’s Sustainable Development Goals, including SDG5, and to achieve gender equality and empower all women and girls.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation ===

==== "Ensure availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for all."&lt;ref name="SDG6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation.html|title=Goal 6: Clean water and sanitation|last=|first=|date=|website=UNDP|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Main|Sustainable Development Goal 6}}

The [[Sustainable Development Goal 6|Sustainable Development Goal Number 6]] (SDG6) has eight targets and 11 indicators that will be used to monitor progress toward the targets. Most are to be achieved by the year 2030. One is targeted for 2020.&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-6-clean-water-and-sanitation/targets/|title=Goal 6 Targets|last=|first=|date=|website=United Nations Development Programme|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first three targets relate to drinking [[water supply]] and [[sanitation]].&lt;ref name="SDG6_targets"/&gt; Worldwide, 6 out of 10 people lack safely managed sanitation services, and 3 out of 10 lack safely managed water services.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Safe drinking water and hygienic [[toilets]] protect people from disease and enable societies to be more productive economically. Attending school and work without disruption is critical to successful education and successful employment. Therefore, toilets in schools and work places are specifically mentioned as a target to measure. "Equitable sanitation" calls for addressing the specific needs of women and girls and those in vulnerable situations, such as the elderly or people with disabilities. Water sources are better preserved if open defecation is ended and sustainable sanitation systems are implemented.

Ending [[open defecation]] will require provision of toilets and sanitation for 2.6 billion people as well as [[Behavior change (public health)|behavior change]] of the users.&lt;ref name="JMP2017"/&gt; This will require cooperation between governments, civil society, and the private sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/982187046|title=Beyond the bottom line: integrating sustainability into business and management practice|last=Kellogg|first=Diane M.|publisher=Greenleaf Publishing|others=Gudić, Milenko, Tan, Tay Keong, Flynn, Patricia M.|year=2017|isbn=9781783533275|location=Saltaire, UK|pages=|chapter=The Global Sanitation Crisis: A Role for Business|oclc=982187046}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main indicator for the sanitation target is the "Proportion of population using safely managed sanitation services, including a hand-washing facility with soap and water".&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg6|title=SDGs|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|access-date=17 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as of 2017, two-thirds of countries lacked baseline estimates for SDG indicators on hand washing, safely managed drinking water, and sanitation services.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; From those that were available, the Joint Monitoring Programme ([[Joint Monitoring Programme for Water Supply and Sanitation|JMP]]) found that 4.5 billion people currently do not have [[Improved sanitation|safely managed sanitation]].&lt;ref name="JMP2017"&gt;WHO and UNICEF (2017) [https://washdata.org/reports Progress on Drinking Water, Sanitation and Hygiene: 2017 Update and SDG Baselines]. Geneva: World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children’s Fund (UNICEF), 2017&lt;/ref&gt; If we are to meet SDG targets for sanitation by 2030, nearly one-third of countries will need to accelerate progress to end open defecation including Brazil, China, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and Pakistan.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

The [[Sustainable Sanitation Alliance]] (SuSanA) has made it its mission to achieve SDG6.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|title=Vision|last=|first=|date=|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150419043556/http://www.susana.org/en/about/vision-mission|archive-date=2015-04-19|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|title=Contribution of sustainable sanitation to the Agenda 2030 for sustainable development - SuSanA Vision Document 2017|last=|first=|date=|year=2017|website=|publisher=SuSanA, Eschborn, Germany|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116185906/http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/library/details/2715|archive-date=2017-11-16|dead-url=yes|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; SuSanA's position is that the SDGs are highly interdependent. Therefore, the provision of clean water and sanitation for all is a precursor to achieving many of the other SDGs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|title=Sustainable sanitation and the SDGs: interlinkages and opportunities|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Sanitation Alliance Knowledge Hub|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171117064658/http://www.susana.org/en/knowledge-hub/resources-and-publications/susana-publications/details/2859|archive-date=2017-11-17|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy ===
==== "Ensure access to affordable, reliable, [[Sustainable energy|sustainable]] and modern energy for all."&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-7-affordable-and-clean-energy.html|title=Goal 7: Affordable and clean energy|website=UNDP|accessdate=28 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Targets for 2030 include access to affordable and reliable energy while increasing the share of renewable energy in the global energy mix. This would involve improving energy efficiency and enhancing international cooperation to facilitate more open access to clean energy technology and more investment in clean energy infrastructure. Plans call for particular attention to infrastructure support for the [[Least Developed Countries|least developed countries]], [[Small Island Developing States|small islands]] and land-locked [[Developing country|developing countries]].&lt;ref name=":9"/&gt;

As of 2017, only 57 percent of the global population relies primarily on clean fuels and technology, falling short of the 95 percent target.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

=== Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth ===
==== "Promote sustained, inclusive and [[Sustainable development|sustainable economic growth]], full and productive employment and [[decent work]] for all."&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-8-decent-work-and-economic-growth.html|title=Goal 8: Decent work and economic growth|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Council (WPC)]] development economists have argued that the twin considerations of long-term economic growth and infrastructure investment weren’t prioritized enough. Being prioritized as number 8 and number 9 respectively was considered a rather "mediocre ranking and defies common sense''"''&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"/&gt;

For the least developed countries, the economic target is to attain at least a 7 percent annual growth in gross domestic product (GDP). Achieving higher productivity will require diversification and upgraded technology along with innovation, entrepreneurship, and the growth of small- and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs). Some targets are for 2030; others are for 2020. The target for 2020 is to reduce youth unemployment and operationalize a global strategy for youth employment. Implementing the Global Jobs Pact of the [[International Labour Organization]] is also mentioned.

By 2030, the target is to establish policies for sustainable tourism that will create jobs. Strengthening domestic financial institutions and increasing Aid for Trade support for developing countries is considered essential to economic development. The Enhanced Integrated Framework for Trade-Related Technical Assistance to Least Developed Countries is mentioned as a method for achieving sustainable economic development.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

=== Goal 9: Industry, Innovation, and Infrastructure ===
==== "Build resilient infrastructure, promote inclusive and sustainable industrialization, and foster [[innovation]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Goal 9: Industry, innovation, infrastructure|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-9-industry-innovation-and-infrastructure.html|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Further|Resilience (engineering and construction)|Urban resilience}}
Manufacturing is a major source of employment. In 2016, the least developed countries had less "manufacturing value added per capita". The figure for Europe and North America amounted to US$4,621, compared to about $100 in the least developed countries.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg9|title=Progress of Goal 9 in 2017|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The manufacturing of high products contributes 80 percent to total manufacturing output in industrialized economies but barely 10 percent in the least developed countries.

Mobile-cellular signal coverage has improved a great deal. In previously "unconnected" areas of the globe, 85 percent of people now live in covered areas. Planet-wide, 95 percent of the population is covered.&lt;ref name=":8"/&gt;

=== Goal 10: Reducing inequalities ===
==== "Reduce income [[social inequality|inequality]] within and among countries."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-10-reduced-inequalities.html|title=Goal 10: Reduced inequalities|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
One target is to reduce the cost of exporting goods from least developed countries. "Duty-free treatment" has expanded. As of 2015, 65 percent of products coming from the least developed countries were duty-free, as compared to 41 percent in 2005.

The target of 3 percent was established as the cost that international migrant workers would pay to send money home (known as [[Remittance|remittances]]). However, post offices and money transfer companies currently charge 6 percent of the amount remitted. Worse, commercial banks charge 11 percent. Prepaid cards and mobile money companies charge 2 to 4 percent, but those services were not widely available as of 2017 in typical "remittance corridors."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg10|title=Progress of Goal 10 in 2017|last=|first=|date=16 Nov 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goal Knowledge Platform|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities ===
==== "Make cities and human settlements inclusive, safe, resilient, and sustainable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-11-sustainable-cities-and-communities.html|title=Goal 11: Sustainable cities and communities|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The target for 2030 is to ensure access to safe and [[affordable housing]]. The indicator named to measure progress toward this target is the proportion of urban population living in [[Slum|slums]] or [[Shanty town|informal settlements]]. Between 2000 and 2014, the proportion fell from 39 percent to 30 percent. However, the absolute number of people living in slums went from 792 million in 2000 to an estimated 880 million in 2014. Movement from rural to urban areas has accelerated as the population has grown and better housing alternatives are available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg11|title=Sustainable Development Goal 11|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goals|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 12: Responsible consumption and production ===
==== "Ensure [[sustainable consumption]] and production patterns."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-12-responsible-consumption-and-production.html|title=Goal 12: Responsible consumption, production|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
{{Further|Sustainable products}}
The targets of Goal 12 include using [[Environmentally friendly|eco-friendly]] production methods and reducing the amount of waste. By 2030, national [[recycling]] rates should increase, as measured in tons of material recycled. Further, companies should adopt sustainable practices and publish sustainability reports.

Target 12.1 calls for the implementation of the 10-Year Framework of Programmes on Sustainable Consumption and Production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg12|title=Goal 12 .:. Sustainable Development Knowledge Platform|website=sustainabledevelopment.un.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework, adopted by member states at the [[United Nations Conference on Sustainable Development]], is a global commitment to accelerate the shift to sustainable consumption and production in developed and developing countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://rio20.un.org/sites/rio20.un.org/files/a-conf.216-5_english.pdf|title=A/CONF.216/5: A 10-Year Framework of Programmes|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to generate the collective impact necessary for such a shift, programs such as the [[One Planet Network]] have formed different implementation methods to help achieve Goal 12.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oneplanetnetwork.org/platform-sustainable-development-goal-12 Retrieved October 15 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 13: Climate action ===
==== "Take urgent action to combat [[Global warming|climate change]] and its impacts by regulating [[emission of greenhouse gases|emissions]] and promoting developments in [[renewable energy]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-13-climate-action.html|title=Goal 13: Climate action|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
The UN discussions and negotiations identified the links between the post-2015 SDG process and the [[Financing for Development]] process that concluded in Addis Ababa in July 2015 and the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference|COP 21]] Climate Change conference in Paris in December 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/presscenter/events/2015/december/COP21-paris-climate-conference.html|title=Paris Climate Change Conference: COP21|website=United Nations Development Programme|accessdate=25 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2015, a report concluded that only a very ambitious climate deal in Paris in 2015 could enable countries to reach the sustainable development goals and targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cdkn.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Impact-of-climate-on-SDGs-technical-report-CDKN.pdf|title=The impact of climate change on the achievement of the post-2015 sustainable development goals|last2=Greño, P|date=May 2015|publisher=CDKN &amp; HR Wallingford|last3=Houlden, V|display-authors=et al.|last1=Ansuategi, A|accessdate=20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report also states that tackling climate change will only be possible if the SDGs are met. Further, economic development and climate change are inextricably linked, particularly around [[poverty]], [[gender equality]], and energy. The UN encourages the [[public sector]] to take initiative in this effort to minimize [[environmental impact|negative impacts on the environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://docs.google.com/gview?url=http://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/content/documents/no9.pdf&amp;embedded=true|title=Sustainable Development Innovation Briefs, Issue 9|last=|first=|date=March 2010|work=|access-date=12 September 2016|via=UN.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This renewed emphasis on climate change mitigation was made possible by the partial [[China–United States relations|Sino-American]] convergence that developed in 2015-2016, notably at the UN [[COP21]] summit (Paris) and ensuing [[G20]] conference (Hangzhou).&lt;ref name="Analyse Financière"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.academia.edu/28982570/Beyond_SDGs_Can_Fiduciary_Capitalism_and_Bolder_Better_Boards_Jumpstart_Economic_Growth|title=Beyond SDGs: Can Fiduciary Capitalism and Bolder, Better Boards Jumpstart Economic Growth?|date=October 2016|work=Analyse Financière|first1=M. Nicolas J.|last1=Firzli|accessdate=1 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As one of the regions most vulnerable to the effects of climate change, the Asia-Pacific region needs more [[public-private partnership]]s (PPPs) to successfully implement its sustainable development initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=GCEOA Chairman Underscores the Value of Big Data for the SDGS |url=http://www.globalceoalliance.org/news-and-events/gceoa-chairman-underscores-the-value-of-big-data-for-the-sdgs/ |website=Global CEO Alliance (GCEOA) |accessdate=27 October 2018 |format=Press release |date=2017-05-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 14: Life below water ===
==== "Conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water.html|title=Goal 14: Life below water|website=UNDP|access-date=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
[[Ocean]]s cover 71 percent of the Earth's surface. They are essential for making the planet livable. [[Rainwater]], [[drinking water]] and climate are all regulated by [[ocean temperature]]s and [[ocean current|currents]]. Over 3 billion people depend on marine life for their livelihood. Oceans absorb 30 percent of all [[carbon dioxide]] produced by humans.&lt;ref name="UNDP2017"&gt;UNDP2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The oceans contain more than 200,000 identified species, and there might be thousands of species that are yet to be discovered. Oceans are the world's largest sources of protein. However, there has been a 26 percent increase in [[Ocean acidification|acidification]] since the [[industrial revolution]]. A full 30 percent of [[marine habitat]]s have been destroyed, and 30 percent of the world's [[fish stocks]] are [[overfishing|over-exploited]].&lt;ref name="UNDP2017"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Marine pollution]] has reached shocking levels; each minute, 15 tons of plastic are released into the oceans.&lt;ref name="WWF2017"&gt;WWF2017&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} 20 percent of all [[Coral reef|coral reefs]] have been destroyed irreversibly, and another 24 percent are in immediate risk of collapse.&lt;ref name="UN2016"&gt;UN2016&lt;/ref&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} Approximately 1 million sea birds, 100 000 marine mammals, and an unknown number of fish are harmed or die annually due to marine pollution caused by humans. It has been found that 95 percent of [[Fulmar|fulmars]] in Norway have plastic parts in their guts.&lt;ref name="WWF2017"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}} [[Microplastics]] are another form of marine pollution.

Individuals can help the oceans by reducing their [[energy consumption]] and their use of plastics. Nations can also take action. In Norway, for instance, citizens, working through a web page called finn.no, can earn money for picking up plastic on the beach.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Tesdal Galtung |first1=Anders |last2=Rolfsnes |first2=May-Helen |title=Finn.no kjøper sekker med havplast |url=https://www.nrk.no/hordaland/finn.no-kjoper-sekker-med-havplast-1.13599585 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=NRK |date=13 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several countries, including Kenya, have [[Phase-out of lightweight plastic bags|banned the use of plastic bags]] for retail purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Kenya plastic bag ban comes into force after years of delays |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-africa-41069853 |accessdate=27 October 2018 |work=BBC News |date=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Improving the oceans contributes to [[poverty reduction]], as it gives low-income families a source of income and healthy food. Keeping beaches and ocean water clean in less developed countries can attract tourism, as stated in Goal 8, and reduce poverty by providing more employment.&lt;ref name="UN2016"/&gt;{{Full citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The targets include preventing and reducing marine pollution and acidification, protecting marine and [[coastal ecosystem]]s, and [[fishing regulation|regulating fishing]]. The targets also call for an increase in scientific knowledge of the oceans.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-14-life-below-water.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/14_Why-it-Matters_Goal-14_Life-Below-Water_3p.pdf[https://docs.google.com/viewer?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.un.org%2Fsustainabledevelopment%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2016%2F08%2F14_Why-it-Matters_Goal-14_Life-Below-Water_3p.pdf&amp;embedded=true&amp;chrome=false&amp;dov=1 [[chrome-extension://gmpljdlgcdkljlppaekciacdmdlhfeon/images/beside-link-icon.svg|link=]]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Goal 15: Life on land ===
==== "Protect, restore and promote sustainable use of terrestrial [[ecosystem]]s, sustainably manage forests, combat [[desertification]], and halt and reverse [[land degradation]] and halt [[biodiversity]] loss."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-15-life-on-land.html|title=Goal 15: Life on land|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
This goal articulates targets for preserving biodiversity of forest, desert, and mountain eco-systems, as a percentage of total land mass. Achieving a "land degradation-neutral world" can be reached by restoring degraded forests and land lost to drought and flood. Goal 15 calls for more attention to preventing invasion of [[introduced species]] and more protection of [[endangered species]].&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt;

The Mountain Green Cover Index monitors progress toward target 15.4, which focuses on preserving mountain ecosystems. The index is named as the indicator for target 15.4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/mountain-partnership/our-work/advocacy/2030-agenda-for-sustainable-development/mountain-green-cover-index/en/|title=Mountain Partnership: working together for mountain peoples and environment|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Mountain Partnership|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the Red Index (Red List Index or RLI) will fill the monitoring function for biodiversity goals by documenting the trajectory of endangered species.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg15|title=Sustainable Development Goal 12|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development UN|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Animal extinction is a growing problem.

=== Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions ===
==== "Promote peaceful and inclusive societies for [[sustainable development]], provide [[right to fair trial|access to justice]] for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-16-peace-justice-and-strong-institutions.html|title=Goal 16: Peace, justice and strong institutions|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Reducing [[violent crime]], [[sex trafficking]], [[Unfree labour|forced labor]], and [[child abuse]] are clear global goals. The International Community values [[peace]] and [[justice]] and calls for stronger judicial systems that will enforce laws and work toward a more peaceful and just society. By 2017, the UN could report progress on detecting victims of trafficking. More women and girls than men and boys were victimized, yet the share of women and girls has slowly declined (see also [[violence against women]]). In 2004, 84 percent of victims were females and by 2014 that number had dropped to 71 percent. Sexual exploitation numbers have declined, but forced labor has increased.

One target is to see the end to sex trafficking, forced labor, and all forms of violence against and torture of children. However, reliance on the indicator of "crimes reported" makes monitoring and achieving this goal challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sdg16report.org/|title=SDG16 Data Initiative 2017 Global Report|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=SDG16 Report|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170723064355/http://sdg16report.org/|archive-date=2017-07-23|dead-url=yes|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, 84 percent of countries have no or insufficient data on violent punishment of children.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt; Of the data available, it is clear that violence against children by their caregivers remains pervasive: Nearly 8 in 10 children aged 1 to 14 are subjected to violent discipline on a regular basis (regardless of income), and no country is on track to eliminate violent discipline by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

SDG 16 also targets universal legal identity and [[Birth certificate|birth registration]], ensuring the right to a name and nationality, [[Civil and political rights|civil rights]], recognition before the law, and access to justice and social services. With more than a quarter of children under 5 unregistered worldwide as of 2015, about 1 in 5 countries will need to accelerate progress to achieve universal birth registration by 2030.&lt;ref name="SDGChildren2018"/&gt;

=== Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals ===
==== "Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for [[sustainable development]].“&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.undp.org/content/undp/en/home/sustainable-development-goals/goal-17-partnerships-for-the-goals.html|title=Goal 17: Partnerships for the goals|website=UNDP|accessdate=12 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ====
Increasing [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]] is seen as vital to achieving each of the 16 previous goals. Goal 17 is included to assure that countries and organizations cooperate instead of compete. Developing multi-stakeholder partnerships to share knowledge, expertise, technology, and financial support is seen as critical to overall success of the SDGs. [[Public–private partnership|Public-private partnerships]] that involve civil societies are specifically mentioned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sustainabledevelopment.un.org/sdg17|title=Sustainable Development Goal 17|last=|first=|date=16 November 2017|website=Sustainable Development Goals|access-date=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There is widespread consensus that progress on all of the SDGs will be stalled if women's empowerment and gender equality is not prioritized holistically – by policy makers as well as private sector executives and board members. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=6th World Pensions Forum held at the Queen’s House: ESG and Asset Ownership|url=https://amnt.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/6th-World-Pensions-Forum2017.pdf|accessdate=28 April 2018|work= Revue Analyse Financière|publisher=Revue Analyse Financière|date=5 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Firzli|first1=Nicolas|title=Greening, Governance and Growth in the Age of Popular Empowerment|url=http://www.pensions-expert.com/Special-Features/The-Cut/Greening-governance-and-growth-in-the-age-of-popular-empowerment|accessdate=27 April 2018|work=FT Pensions Experts|publisher=Financial Times|date=3 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Statements from diverse sources, such as the [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development]] (OECD), [[UN Women]] and the [[World Pensions &amp; Investments Forum|World Pensions Forum]] have noted that investments in women and girls have positive impacts on economies. National and global development investments often exceed their initial scope.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.oecd.org/dac/gender-development/POST-2015%20Gender.pdf|title=Gender equality and women’s rights in the post-2015 agenda: A foundation for sustainable development|format=PDF|website=Oecd.org|access-date=2016-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education and sustainable development ===
{{Main|Education for sustainable development}}

Education for sustainable development (ESD) is explicitly recognized in the SDGs as part of Target 4.7 of the SDG on education. UNESCO promotes the [[Global citizenship education|Global Citizenship Education]] (GCED) as a complementary approach.&lt;ref&gt;Global Citizenship Education: Topics and learning objectives UNESCO, 2015 &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002329/232993e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, it is important to emphasize ESD’s importance for all the other 16 SDGs. With its overall aim to develop cross-cutting sustainability competencies in learners, ESD is an essential contribution to all efforts to achieve the SDGs. This would enable individuals to contribute to sustainable development by promoting societal, economic and political change as well as by transforming their own behavior.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002474/247444e.pdf|title=Education for Sustainable Development Goals: Learning Objectives|last=UNESCO|first=|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2017|isbn=978-92-3-100209-0|location=|pages=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Education, gender and technology ===
{{Main|Massive open online course}}

Massive open online courses (MOOCs) are free open education offered through online platforms. The (initial) philosophy of MOOCs was to open up quality [[Higher education|Higher Education]] to a wider audience. As such, MOOCs are an important tool to achieve Goal 4 ("Ensure inclusive and equitable quality education and promote lifelong learning opportunities for all").&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002451/245122E.pdf|title=Making Sense of MOOCs: A Guide for Policy-Makers in Developing Countries|last=Patru|first=Mariana|last2=Balaji|first2=Venkataraman|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100157-4|location=|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, MOOCs also contribute to Goal 5, in that they are gender neutral and can give women and girls improved access to education.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

=== SDG-driven investment ===
[[Stewardship|Capital stewardship]] is expected to play a crucial part in the progressive advancement of the SDG agenda: 
: "No longer [[absentee landlord]]s', [[pension fund]] trustees have started to exercise more forcefully their [[governance]] prerogatives across the boardrooms of Britain, Benelux and America: coming together through the establishment of engaged pressure groups [...] to shift the [whole economic] system towards sustainable investment"&lt;ref name="Revue Analyse Financiere"&gt;{{cite news |first1=M.

==Criticisms==

=== Comparison with Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) ===
A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as "sprawling, misconceived" and "a mess" compared to the eight MDGs used previously.&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; The MDGs were about development while the SDGs are about sustainable development. Finally, the MDGs used a  sole approach to problems, while the SDGs take into account the inter-connectedness of all the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

Whilst the MDGs were strongly criticized by many NGOs as only dealing with the problems, the SDGs deal with the causes of the problems.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

=== Competing goals ===

{{see also|Food vs. fuel}}
First, some of the SDGs might be contradictory. For example, seeking high levels of quantitative [[GDP growth]] (as opposed to qualitative economic development and the goal of better distribution of the economic product) might undermine [[ecological]], inequality reduction, and sustainability objectives. Similarly, increasing employment and wages can work against reducing the [[cost of living]].

Second, the goal of achieving sustainable human population and lifestyle levels, and the scientific issues of matching ecosystems (and the Earth as a whole) to the number of human beings that they can sustainably support at a certain life-style level, seem neglected and largely unarticulated. Human population levels and reproductive rates are independent variables in trying to reach the SDGs and in aiming at an overall sustainable Earth/Human Community, they need to be scientifically recognized as such.

Third, in addition to population and lifestyle issues, three sectors need to come together in order to achieve sustainable development. These are the economic, socio-political, and environmental sectors in their broadest sense.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jiid.in/2016/08/sustainable-development-goals-2016-2030-easier-stated-achieved/|title=Sustainable Development Goals 2016-2030: Easier Stated Than Achieved – JIID|date=2016-08-21|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This requires the promotion of [[multidisciplinary]] and transdisciplinary research across different sectors, which can be difficult, particularly when major governments fail to support it.&lt;ref name=":4"/&gt;. 

Fourth, the issues of demilitarization, disarmament, and conversion to peace-based economies also seem neglected, along with the issues of corruption, drugs, robotization of jobs, the need for global citizenship education, the lack of reliable UN and SDG financing, and the current disempowering inability of citizens to participate directly in the global-level decision-making and priority-setting process and to thereby feel the collective togetherness needed for the success of the SDG effort.

=== Too many goals ===
A commentary in ''[[The Economist]]'' in 2015 argued that 169 targets for the SDGs is too many, describing them as "sprawling, misconceived" and "a mess".&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21647286-proposed-sustainable-development-goals-would-be-worse-useless-169-commandments|title=The 169 commandments|newspaper=The Economist|access-date=2016-02-19|issn=0013-0613}}&lt;/ref&gt; The goals are said to ignore local context. All other 16 goals might be contingent on achieving SDG 1, ending poverty, which should have been at the top of a very short list of goals.

On the other hand, nearly all stakeholders engaged in negotiations to develop the SDGs agreed that the high number of 17 goals were justified because the agenda they address is all encompassing.

=== High cost of achieving the SDGs ===
''The Economist'' estimated that alleviating poverty and achieving the other sustainable development goals will require about US$2–3 trillion per year for the next 15 years which they called "pure fantasy".&lt;ref name=":5"/&gt; Estimates for providing clean water and sanitation for the whole population of all continents have been as high as US$200 billion.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt; The World Bank cautions that estimates need to be made country by country, and reevaluated frequently over time.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://documents.worldbank.org/curated/en/847191468000296045/pdf/103172-PUB-Box394556B-PUBLIC-EPI-K8632-ADD-SERIES.pdf|title=The Costs of Meeting the 2030 Sustainable Development Goal Targets on Drinking Water, Sanitation, and Hygiene|last=Hutton|first=Guy|date=15 November 2017|website=Documents/World Bank|access-date=15 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Responses to criticisms ===
Other views are more positive. The SDGs were an outcome from a UN conference that was not criticized by any major [[non-governmental organization]] (NGO). Instead, the SDGs received broad support from many NGOs.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}} 

The Rockefeller Foundation asserts that "The key to financing and achieving the SDGs lies in mobilizing a greater share of the $200+ trillion in annual private capital investment flows toward development efforts, and philanthropy has a critical role to play in catalyzing this shift."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.rockefellerfoundation.org/blog/new-role-foundations-financing-global-goals/|title=A New Role for Foundations in Financing the Global Goals|last=Madsbjerg|first=Saadia|date=19 September 2017|website=|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large-scale funders participating in a Rockefeller Foundation-hosted design thinking workshop (June 2017: Scaling Solutions) were realistic.  They concluded that while there is a moral imperative to achieve the SDGs, failure is inevitable if there aren't drastic changes to how we go about financing large scale change.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sphaera.world/billions-to-trillions/|title=From Billions to Trillions: Mobilising the Missing Trillions to Solve the Sustainable Development Goals|last=Burgess|first=Cameron|date=March 2018|website=sphaera.world|access-date=4 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''technological and industrial history of Canada''' encompasses the country's development in the areas of transportation, communication, energy, materials, public works, public services (health care), domestic/consumer and defence technologies.

The terms chosen for the "age" described below are both literal and metaphorical. They describe the technology that dominated the period of time in question but are also representative of a large number of other technologies introduced during the same period. Also of note is the fact that the period of diffusion of a technology can begin modestly and can extend well beyond the "age" of its introduction. To maintain continuity, the treatment of its diffusion is dealt with in the context of its dominant "age".

Technology is a major cultural determinant, no less important in shaping human lives than philosophy, religion, social organization, or political systems. In the broadest sense, these forces are also aspects of technology. The French sociologist Jacques Ellul defined ''la technique'' as the totality of all rational methods in every field of human activity so that, for example, education, law, sports, propaganda, and the social sciences are all technologies in that sense. At the other end of the scale, common parlance limits the term's meaning to specific industrial arts.

== The late Electric Age (1901–1920) ==

===Industrial processes and techniques===
Metal mining also became significant industry during this period. The International Nickel Company ([[Vale Inco|Inco]]) was established in 1902 through the fusion of two companies. A refinery using the Orford process was built in Port Colborne, Ontario in 1918 and then moved to Copper Cliff, Ontario, where that technique was replaced by the matte flotation process in 1948. Hard rock gold mining became practical in 1887, with the development of the potassium cyanidation process, by Scott MacArthur, which was used to separate the gold from the ore. This technique was first used in Canada at the Mikado Mine in the Lake-of-the-Woods Region again made accessible by the CPR.  The CPR also provided access to the B.C. interior, where lead, copper, silver and gold ores had been discovered in the Rossland area in 1891. The ores were transported to Trail, B.C., where they were roasted. After CPR built the Crowsnest Pass it purchased the Trail roasting facility and in 1899 built a blast furnace to smelt lead ore. In 1902 the first electrolytic lead refining plant using the Betts Cell Process began operation in Trail.  The Consolidated Mining and Smelting Company of Canada Ltd. was founded as a CPR subsidiary and began to develop the Sullivan Mine with its lead, zinc and silver ores, in Kimberley in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;Mouat, Jeremy, Metal Mining in Canada, 1840 −1950, Transformation Series 9, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1912 the Dominion Coal Company produced 40% of Canada’s total coal output.&lt;ref&gt;Muise, McIntosh, Coal Mining in Canada: A Historical and Comparative Overview, Transformation Series 5, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904 a company in Bowmanville, Ontario, began Canada’s first [[powdered milk]] production operation. The large-scale home delivery of milk began in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal in 1900.

===Materials===
Railway and locomotive construction in the latter 19th century created a huge demand for [[steel]]. The Bessemer furnace at the Algom steel mill in Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario went into operation in 1902. The [[Montreal Rolling Mills]] Co, The [[Hamilton Steel and Iron Company]], the Canada Screw Company, the Canada Bolt and Nut Company, and the Dominion Wire Manufacturing Company were consolidated in 1910 to form The [[Stelco|Steel Company of Canada]] headquartered in Toronto. With mills located in Hamilton and other cities, it was the largest producer of steel in Canada for most of the century. Its competitor, the Dominion Steel Castings Company Limited founded in 1912, renamed the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company in 1917 and [[Dofasco]] in 1980, had its Hamilton facilities located next to those of [[Stelco]].

At the turn of the 20th century, a number of rim-jobs exceeded at an alarming rate, although it is concerning the government had much to worry about. Health concerns were identified, and its use was generally discontinued by the late 20th century.

The modern version of [[plywood]] was invented in the US in 1905 in Portland, Oregon. In 1913, the Fraser Mills in New Westminster, British Columbia, produced the first Canadian plywood, primarily from Douglas fir. This new material eventually found use in a wide variety of structures, including auto running boards, panelling, sub-floors, roof sheathing, wall sheathing, shipping crates and, during World War II, the manufacturing of aircraft and small ships.
 
The [[pulp and paper]] industry also developed during these years. The closely related sulphate pulp process was introduced in Canada in 1907, when the Brompton Pulp &amp; Paper Company began operation in East Angus, Quebec. This process dominates the industry to this day. The pulp slurry was fed in a continuous stream into a paper-making machine that flattened, pressed and dried it into newsprint on huge rolls many metres wide and containing thousands of meters of paper.

===Office automation===
Business and public administration was improved and simplified with the introduction of the [[typewriter]], which acquired a familiar standardized form by about 1910, which features the "qwerty" keyboard, the typebar, ribbon, cylinder and carriage return lever. Popular models in Canada were manufactured by the US Remington and Underwood companies, among others. The introduction of the mechanical [[desk calculator]] complemented that of the typewriter. Most machines used in Canada were manufactured in the US by companies such as Friden, Monroe, and SCM/Marchant. The Gestetner copy machine, which used the stencil technique to reproduce copies of documents, was invented in England in 1881 by [[David Gestetner]] and quickly became popular in offices around the world, including those in Canada.

===Public works and civil engineering===
Notable works of civil engineering realized the completion of: the [[New Westminster Bridge]], Vancouver 1904, the Lethbridge Viaduct, Lethbridge, Alberta, 1909, the [[Spiral Tunnels]], Hector to Field BC, 1909, the St. Andrew's Lock and Dam, Lockport, Manitoba, 1910,  the Brooks Aqueduct, Brooks, Albert, 1914, the [[Quebec Bridge]], Ste-Foy, Quebec, 1916, the [[Connaught Tunnel]], Rogers Pass, BC, 1916, the Ogden Point Breakwater and Docks, Victoria, British Columbia, 1917, the Prince Edward Viaduct, Toronto, Ontario, 1919, the Shoal Lake Aqueduct, Winnipeg, Manitoba, 1919 and the [[Trent-Severn Waterway]], Ontario, 1920.

In the 1930s diesel-powered excavation shovels replaced steam shovels for the excavation of railway right-of-ways and the digging of basements and foundations for skyscrapers and domestic housing, in the late 19th century.

===Skyscrapers and architecture ===
It was the age of the [[skyscraper]] and the race to build the tallest structure in the British Empire set off a competition among cities across Canada. Successive record holders included the Traders Bank of Canada, 15 floors, Yonge St, Toronto, 1905, the Dominion Building, 13 floors, Vancouver, 1910, World (Sun) Tower, 17 floors, Vancouver, 1912, the Canadian Pacific Building, 16 floors, Toronto, 1913, the Royal Bank, 20 floors, Toronto, 1915, the Royal Bank, Montreal, 1928, the Royal York Hotel, Toronto, 1929 and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce, Toronto, in 1931.

===Central heating===
The construction of skyscrapers, grand hotels and other large buildings led to the development of [[central heating]], an essential feature in Canada's cold climate. In the 20th century such systems were used to provide heat to small communities such as university campuses, northern industrial towns or military bases. Smaller systems were used in private homes. Another technique, the convection method, was introduced to domestic dwellings at this time. A metal furnace in the basement, using wood or coal as fuel, would heat air in a plenum which would rise by convection through a series of metal ducts into the rooms of the house above. When the air cooled it would fall to the floor and return to the plenum through another series of metal return ducts. In later years an electric fan was used to force the hot air from the plenum through the ducts.

===Domestic and consumer technology===

The introduction of the flush toilet in the US and Canada in the 1880s created a market that inspired the invention of rolled [[toilet paper]]. The product was first produced in the US by the Albany Perforated Wrapping Paper Company in 1877. The US Scott Paper Company began manufacturing toilette paper in 1902 and by 1925 Scott Paper was the largest manufacturer of toilette paper in the world. As early as 1926 the Purex brand had been established in Canada and with the arrival of Scott Paper Canada in 1927 the White Swan brand was introduced.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, About.com, inventors.about.com/gi/dynamic/offsite.htm?zi=1/XJ&amp;sdn=inventors&amp;cdn=money&amp;tm=14&amp;gps=94_60_978_623&amp;f=10&amp;tt=2&amp;bt=1&amp;bts=1&amp;zu=http%3A//www.toiletpaperworld.com/tpw/encyclopedia/navigation/funfacts.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medicine===
The introduction of medical [[x-ray]]s during this period dramatically improved medical diagnostics. Discovered by Roentgen in Germany in 1895, x-ray units were in operation at the Toronto and [[Montreal General Hospital]]s by the turn of the century. The sphygmomanometer or blood pressure meter, that familiar device employing a cuff placed around the patients arm, found its way into the office of most Canadian doctors in the early 20th century. The spread of bovine tuberculosis, a crippling childhood disease, was curbed through the introduction of pasteurized milk in Montreal and Toronto at the turn of the century. This practice was soon followed by the dairy industry across Canada.

Bayer began marketing the wonder drug of the age, [[Aspirin]], in 1899. It was an instant success and quickly became popular in Canada. Originally sold as a powder, the tablet was introduced in 1914. A very important step in the mass production of medical products was taken that same year when Dr. John Fitzgerald founded an institution that would be named the [[Connaught Laboratories]] in 1917, at the University of Toronto. Initially the laboratories produced vaccines and antitoxins for smallpox, tetanus, diphtheria and rabies. In 1922 after the Nobel Prize winning work on Dr. Banting and Dr. Best the facility began to manufacture insulin.

In 1914 Dr. John Fitzgerald established laboratories in Toronto to produce vaccines for smallpox, rabies, diphtheria and tetanus. The facility was named the Connaught laboratories in 1917 in honour of Prince Albert, the Duke of Connaught the recently retired Governor General. Beginning in 1922 the laboratories began to mass-produce the newly discovered hormone [[insulin]].

The [[Water chlorination|chlorination]] of municipal drinking water, a technique known to kill bacteria and thus make the water safer for human consumption, was introduced in Toronto in 1910. It became widely used across Canada in the years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;Drinking Water Management in Ontario: A Brief History, Ontario Sewer and Watermain Construction Association, January 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defence===
The 13- and 18-pound muzzle-loading gun field gun with modern recoil and sighting systems were acquired at the turn of the century. A notable acquisition was the first breech-loading gun, in Canadian use, the 13-pound quick-firing (Q.F.) and 18-pound Q.F. firing shrapnel and high-explosive rounds, in 1905. The [[Royal Canadian Navy]] founded in 1910, took possession of its first ships, two tired steel-hulled former Royal Navy cruisers, the ''Rainbow'', in 1910, stationed at Esquimalt on the west coast and the ''Niobe'' at Halifax on the east coast.

== The Automobile Age (1920–1950) ==

During the post-World War I era, a plethora of technologies were introduced, including the car, air service, air navigation, paved roads, radio, the telephone, refrigeration, wonder drugs and powered farming, mining and forestry equipment.

===Transportation, the car and aeroplane===
The [[Ford Motor Company of Canada]], founded in Windsor, Ontario in 1904, was the first major company to introduce the automobile to Canada. It manufactured cars in that city and was the first company to use the [[assembly line]] manufacturing technique in Canada. Facilities were established in the McGregor wagon factory in Walkerville (now part of Windsor), where the first vehicle off the line was a Model C. Production of the Model T was introduced in 1909 and by 1913 the company was manufacturing motors, the first [[internal combustion engines]] built in Canada, at the Windsor plant. A number of different types, all based on US designs, were manufactured including, the [[Ford Model A (1927-1931)|Ford Model-A]], Ford Model-C, Ford Model-K, Ford Model-N and [[Ford Model-T]]. During WWII, the Canadian Military Pattern Truck, was built there. Following the war, the Ford Meteor was assembled until production moved to the new Ford plant in Oakville in 1953, where production has continued until this day.

In 1918 the McLaughlin Motor Company, Ltd. of Oshawa, Ontario and the Chevrolet Motor Company of Canada Ltd. merged to form [[General Motors of Canada]] and became a subsidiary of the US-owned General Motors Corporation. The company manufactured Buicks, Oldsmobiles and Oaklands on its assembly line in Oshawa.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Heather, Driving Force, The McLaughlin Family and the Age of the Car, McClelland &amp; Stewart, Toronto, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Chrysler Canada]], established in Windsor, began vehicle assembly in that city in 1936. [[Studebaker Canada Ltd.]] manufactured cars and trucks at a plant in Hamilton, Ontario from 1947 to 1966.

The automobile was a hit with Canadians. In 1904 there were 535 cars in Ontario, by 1913 there were 50,000 in Canada, by 1916, 123,000, by 1922, 513,000 and by 1930, 1,076,000. Of note was Thomas Wilby's Trans-Canada road trip, the first by automobile across Canada, from Halifax to Victoria, in 1912, on a series of highways that became known as the All Red Route. As the car gained in popularity local automobile clubs were founded. In 1913 nine of these clubs from across the country got together to form the [[Canadian Automobile Association]].

Cars required [[gasoline]], and the first service station in Canada was built in Vancouver on Smythe Street in 1907. Most early stations were informal curb-side affairs, and it was not until the twenties that the filling station as we know it began to appear, with [[Imperial Oil]] building architect-designed stations for its customers. By 1928 Imperial had evolved three standard filling station designs for different locations: business district, urban residential and small town/leased property. In the 1920s, gasoline itself was modified by the addition of [[tetraethyllead]] to reduce premature detonation of the gas-air mixture in the cylinder, commonly described as knock, in [[internal combustion engines]]. Both health and environmental problems would later become associated with leaded gasoline.

The popularity of the car also had a dramatic impact on urban infrastructure and roads in particular. The dirt, gravel, tar and occasionally cobblestone that characterized most city roads was inadequate for the automobile and towns and cities and provinces across Canada began paving projects creating roads of asphalt and concrete that were more suitable. The [[traffic light]] was also introduced to help regulate the congestion that began to arise in the twenties especially in larger cities like Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. The first in Canada was installed at the corner of Bloor St. and Yonge St. in Toronto in 1925.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Guillet, Edwin C., The Story of Canadian Roads, University of Toronto Press, Toronto, 1967&lt;/ref&gt; The operation of cars on the newly paved roads in a snowy climate necessitated the use of a technology for keeping roads clear for cars in winter. Municipalities and provinces acquired [[snowplow]]s, fleets of trucks with steel blades attached to the front bumper to clear city and provincial roads. The use of crushed rock salt for melting snow and ice on roads was also introduced during this period. The technique was effective but unfortunately proved to be very corrosive to steel and concrete. This had serious consequences for the undercarriage of the steel vehicles that used the roads in winter as well as the roads themselves along with bridges and parking lots.

The popularity of the car in urban areas also lead to the introduction of the [[parking meter]] in the centre of most urban areas. Invented in the US in 1935 it progressively found its way onto city streets across Canada in the years that followed.

The car began to compete with the [[streetcar]] in the thirties and forties and many cities reduced or abandoned this service. New suburbs were built without streetcar lines and urban diesel powered buses were used to provide public transport. Only a handful of cities continued to maintain streetcar service into the fifties and beyond, most notably Toronto which to this day has a very elaborate public streetcar network.

The auto-craze gave rise to a booming do-it-yourself car maintenance and repair movement with businesses specializing in car parts and tools becoming popular. One of the notable firm in this field, the familiar, [[Canadian Tire]], began operations in Toronto in 1922 and has become one of Canada's largest retailers.

Long distance travel by aircraft became increasingly important and practical in the postwar years. Taking off in a Vickers Vimy IV bomber from Lester's Field in St. Johns, Newfoundland on 14 June 1919, John Alcock and Arthur Whitten Brown, ([[Alcock and Brown]]) made the first trans-Atlantic flight, crash landing in Ireland 16 hours later. The first cross-Canada flight began in Halifax on 7 October 1920 and ended in Vancouver ten days later.

In the twenties and thirties the Canadian north was developed with the help of hundreds of small float equipped "bush planes" used to fly men and supplies to mining, forestry, trapping and fishing camps. The first commercial air passenger flight in Canada was made in 1920, when two bush pilots flew a fur buyer from Winnipeg to The Pas, Manitoba.   National passenger air service was introduced  by [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] beginning in 1937 and [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] starting in 1942.

Of note was the attempt by Britain to establish an airship service between that country and Canada and a related test flight by the British built dirigible the [[R-100]] was made in July 1930. After a successful crossing of the Atlantic the giant craft moored at a mast especially constructed for that purpose at St. Hubert near Montreal. The ship flew on to Toronto before finally returning to Britain. However, technical problems with the craft prevented further flights and the idea of a Trans-Atlantic lighter-than-air passenger service was abandoned.

To facilitate the development of a national aviation service the Government of Canada created a kind of national highway in the sky called the Trans-Canada Airway consisting of airports, radio and weather services and lighting for night flying, at various locations across Canada. Construction started in 1929 but was slowed by the depression. The western leg from Vancouver to Winnipeg was completed in 1938. The section from Winnipeg to Toronto and Montreal was inaugurated in 1939 and the extensions to Moncton, Halifax and St. John's completed in 1940, 1941 and 1942 respectively.&lt;ref&gt;Milberry, Larry, Aviation in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

===Communications, radio===
In 1901, [[Guglielmo Marconi]] sent radio signals across the Atlantic Ocean. He established a machine to produce electromagnetic waves at Cornwall in England and a machine to detect these waves at Signal Hill in St. John's Newfoundland. On 12 December 1901 he announced that he had received the transmission of waves sent by the transmitter in England at the station in St John’s.&lt;ref&gt;Babaian, Sharon, A., Radio Communication in Canada : An Historical and Technological Survey, The Transformation Series, No. 1, National Museum of Science and Technology, Ottawa, Canada, 1992, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;    
 
In Montreal, in 1920, XWA ([[CINW (AM)]]) became the first commercial [[AM radio]] broadcaster in the world. Both the AM transmitter and receiver used analog technology. The following year CKAC became the first French- language AM radio broadcaster in Canada. State operated national radio broadcasting chains were established beginning in the late 1920s, including the CNR National Radio Network, 1927, the Canadian Radio Broadcasting Commission Radio Network, 1932 and the [[Canadian Broadcasting Corporation]] Radio Network, 1936. Private independent AM broadcast operations sprouted like mushrooms in cities large and small across Canada during the thirties and forties. Canadian Marconi Company ([[CMC Electronics]]) formed in Montreal in 1903 and [[Nortel|Northern Electric]], manufactured radios for home use, the first mass-produced electronic equipment in Canada. The circuits of these devises were based on analog technology.

The [[teleprinter]] became a popular technology with telegraph companies beginning in 1922. When used with the telegraph system it permitted the automated printing of thousands of telegraph messages and became the backbone of the telegram service offered by the Canadian National Telegraph Company formed in 1920 and the Canadian Pacific Telegraph Company.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robert, A Voice from Afar, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1977, p. 192&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[wirephoto]], was introduced in the US by Associated Press in 1935. This technology permitted the transmission of a photograph by use of telephone wires and became widely used by newspapers for reporting purposes. The technology was quickly introduced to Canada by Canadian Press (1917), which provided the service to newspapers across the country. Canadian Press also became the exclusive provider of Canadian wirephotos for Associated Press.

The Canadian film industry experienced mixed success during the twenties and thirties. Film maker Ernest Shipman produced five features between 1920 and 1923 before meeting with financial failure. The successful Canadian-owned Allen Theatre chain attained an important place in the exhibition market before being taken over by Famous Players Canadian Corporation ([[Cineplex Entertainment]]) in 1923. The technology of the talking cinema or "talkies" was introduced to Canada in 1927 by that company to take advantage of the arrival of talking films produced in Hollywood. The first Canadian "talkie" was "The Viking", an adventure story about sealing off the coast of Newfoundland, produced in 1931.

[[Associated Screen News of Canada]] in Montreal produced two notable newsreel series, "Kinograms" in the twenties and "Canadian Cameo" from 1932 to 1953. The regular production of short films by the newly created Canadian Government Motion Picture Bureau began in the 1930s. British law encouraging filmmaking in the Commonwealth led Hollywood to circumvent the spirit of the concept by establishing film production companies to make American films in Calgary, Toronto, Montreal and Victoria. These companies produced a small number of features but closed operations when the British law was changed to exclude their films. In 1941, Odeon Theatres of Canada opened a new cinema chain to compete with Famous Players.

The making of documentary films grew tremendously during World War II with the creation of the [[National Film Board of Canada]] in 1939. By 1945 it was one of the major film production studios in the world with a staff of nearly 800 and over 500 films to its credit, including the very popular ''The World in Action'' and ''Canada Carries On'' series of monthly propaganda films.

===Materials===
[[Plastics]] were also introduced during these years. In Toronto, Plastics Ltd. began to produce Bakelite soon after its invention in 1909. Another firm, Canadian Electro Products of Shawinigan, Quebec, invented [[polyvinyl acetate]] which was used in copolymer resins and water-based paints. The wartime production of nitrocellulose naturally led to the manufacture at Shawinigan in 1932, of transparent cellulose film used for packaging. What is now called [[fibreglass]] was invented in the US in 1938 at [[Owens-Corning]] by [[Russell Games Slayter]] and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Warrington, Newbold, Chemical Canada: Past and Present, The Chemical Institute of Canada, Ottawa, 1970&lt;/ref&gt;
    
[[Aluminum]] also became popular. In 1902, attracted by the availability of cheap hydro power, the Aluminum Company of America established a Canadian subsidiary, the Northern Aluminum Company ([[Alcan]]) at Shawinigan Falls, Quebec to produce that metal using the electrolysis technique. Corporate changes led to the creation of the Aluminum Company of Canada (Alcan) in 1925 and in 1926 the company constructed a giant aluminum smelter at a place it named Arvida, Quebec. Once again the site was chosen for the availability of cheap hydro electricity and the proximity of a deep-water port at Bagotville for large ships carrying bauxite or aluminum ore. World War II accelerated the demand for aluminum, which was the principal material in aircraft production and the Arvida facility was greatly expanded. In 1958 another huge Alcan smelter was built at Kitimat, British Columbia.

The growth in popularity of the car also created a need for rubber for automobile tires. Accelerated by the emergency of World War II, a substantial [[synthetic rubber]] production industry was established at Sarnia, Ontario in the early forties. The oil refineries there provided a ready source of raw materials. In particular, the Suspensiod crackers operated there by Imperial Oil produced large quantities of hydrocarbon gases. These were used by a new Crown enterprise, [[Polymer Corporation]] created in 1942, and associated private companies, St. Clair Processing Corporation Ltd., Dow Chemical of Canada Ltd., and Canadian Synthetic Rubber Ltd., itself a subsidiary of four Canadian rubber companies, Dominion, Firestone, Goodyear and Goodrich, to produce both GR-S and butyl type synthetic rubber. Initially production was destined for wartime use on military vehicles but in postwar years output was quickly redirected to civilian automobile production.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

The closely related synthetic textile industry appeared in the years just after the First War. The production of artificial silk, more properly known as viscose [[rayon]], made from bleached wood pulp, began in Cornwall, Ontario in 1925, in a factory built by [[Courtaulds]] (Canada). A year later [[Celanese]] Canada began making acetate yarn in a new plant in Drummondville, Quebec. [[DuPont]] Canada was the first to manufacture [[nylon]] yarn in Canada at its factory in Kingston, Ontario in 1942. This secret material was initially used for parachutes but following the war was used to make nylon stockings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

[[Asbestos]] has long been known for its fibrous and heat resistant properties. With the rise of the automobile, asbestos became an important material, being used to make brakes. The world's largest asbestos mine, the Jeffrey Mine in Asbestos, Quebec had its beginnings in the 1878 when a local farmer W. H. Jeffrey began to mine the substance there. Original mining methods were primitive and involved blasting, the use of chisels to remove the mineral from the rock by hand and a crane powered by one horse. By 1895, 2300 tons of asbestos were being removed from the open pit mine per year. The mine was purchased by the Johns-Manville Company of the US in 1918 and has since become the largest asbestos mine in the world, over two kilometres in diameter and 350 metres deep. The material was used for insulation in buildings and ships and, of course, for automobile brakes. However, serious health problems, including lung cancer, have been associated with its mining and use, and in recent years mining activity there has diminished.&lt;ref&gt;Joan Kuyek,  Asbestos Mining in Canada:
A brief presented to the International Ban Asbestos Conference,
Ottawa, September 13, 2003,  MiningWatch Canada&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
With the rail building era coming to an end, the rise of the [[automotive industry]] in southern Ontario provided the Hamilton steel mills of the Steel Company of Canada and the Dominion Foundries and Steel Company with a new market. Dofasco introduced the [[basic oxygen steelmaking]] at its mills in Hamilton in 1954. In the latter part of the century, Algoma, in Sault Ste. Marie, built coke oven batteries and blast furnaces, while phasing out the open-hearth and Bessemer steel-making process in favour of the basic oxygen steel-making.

The industrial production of [[bread]] became notable during these years. At the beginning of the 20th century it is estimated that only about 8% of Canadian wives bought bread commercially. However, the industrial production of bread grew impressively and by the 1960s, 95% of homemakers purchased bread commercially. One bakery of note, The Canada Bread Company Limited, was founded in 1911 as the result of the amalgamation of five smaller companies. Industrial bakeries such as this were characterized by the use of large machines for the mixing of dough, which was placed in pans on slow moving conveyor belts that transported them through giant ovens, where they were baked. Large automated packaging machines wrapped the finished loaves at great speed. Improvements in transportation and packaging technology throughout the decades allowed a shrinking number of bakeries to serve every larger markets. In 1939 there were about 3200 commercial bakeries across the country but by 1973 the figure stood at 1700, while in 1981 there were 1400.

[[Meat packing]] grew to become Canada's most important food processing industry during this period. In Calgary, Alberta, in 1890, Pat Burns established P. Burns and Company, which became the largest meat processor in western Canada. In Toronto in 1896 the innovative Harris Abbatoir was established to export chilled sides of beef to the British market. The industry grew rapidly during the war, supplying meat to Canadian and British troops overseas. However, it underwent a period of consolidation in the twenties due to a loss of markets. This led to the merger of two major players, William Davies and the Harris Abattoir, to form [[Canada Packers]] in Toronto. By 1930, "The Big Three", meat packers in Canada were Canada Packers, Swift Canadian and P.Burns and Company in Calgary, Alberta.

The increasing popularity of the electric [[refrigerator]] in Canadian restaurants and homes made it practical for manufacturers to make available various [[frozen foods]]. The first such offering, a frozen strawberry pack was produced in Montreal and Ottawa beginning in 1932 by Heeney Frosted Foods Ltd.

===Consumer technology===
Cold [[breakfast cereal]] became increasingly popular during these years. Wheat and later corn flakes were developed in the US by the Kellogg brothers in 1894 and the Kellogg Company was formed in 1906. In London, Ontario the Canadian Corn Company purchased the rights to manufacture and distribute Toasted Corn Flakes for Canadian distribution. In 1924 the American Kellogg Company purchased the London operation and formed Kellogg Canada Inc. Since that time the company has manufactured and distributed in Canada a wide variety of breakfast cereals including Corn Flakes, 1907, Bran Flakes, 1915, All Bran, 1916 and Rice Krispies, 1928.

Although neither the tin can nor soups were remarkable in any way in the thirties, the combination of the two in the form of the well known Campbell’s soup was very popular. The [[Campbell Soup Company]] introduced its soup products to Canada in 1930, making them at its factory in Toronto on the lake shore.

[[Instant coffee]] was another tasty innovation introduced during these years. The inventor and world leader in the manufacture of instant coffee, the Swiss-based [[Nestlé]] Company began operations in Canada with the production of canned condensed milk at its plant, The Maple Leaf Condensed Milk Company, in Chesterville, Ontario in 1918. Head office research invented instant coffee and began selling it around the world including Canada, as Nescafe in 1938. It became hugely popular with allied troops during World War II. In 1952 the instant chocolate drink, Nestle Quik, was introduced to Canada.

The [[sanitary napkin]] and [[Kleenex]] brand facial tissue were introduced in the 1920s. Kimberly, Clark and Co. ([[Kimberly Clark]]) formed in the US in 1872, invented cellucotton in 1914. It used this material as the basis for a sanitary napkin and marketed the product as [[Kotex]] beginning in 1920. Kleenex, initially intended for the removal of face cream, was introduced in 1924. In 1925 the company formed what would become, Canadian Cellucotton Products Limited, for the marketing of these and other products in Canada and internationally. The first practical electric [[razor]], the Sunbeam "Shavemaster" and the Remington "Close Shaver" made available in the US in 1937 and in Canada shortly thereafter.

With a base of [[caustic soda]], the world's first oven cleaner, [[Easy-Off]], was invented in Regina in 1932 by Herbert McCool and manufactured in his home in that city until 1946, when production shifted to Iberville, Quebec. The product has since become the most popular oven cleaner in the world.

=== Architecture ===
The grand hotel continued to make a mark with new structures, including the Bigwinn Inn, Muskoka, Ontario, 1920, the [[Jasper Park Lodge]], Jasper, Alberta, 1922, the Hotel Newfoundland, St. John's, Newfoundland, 1926, the Hotel Saskatchewan, Regina, Saskatchewan, 1927, the Prince of Wales Hotel, Waterton Lakes National Park, Alberta, 1927, the Lord Nelson Hotel, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1928, The Pines, Digby, Nova Scotia, 1929, the [[Fairmont Royal York|Royal York Hotel]], Toronto, 1929, the [[Chateau Montebello]], Montebello, Quebec, 1930, the Nova Scotian Hotel, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1930, the Charlottetown Hotel, Charlottetown, P.E.I. and the Bessborough Hotel, Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 1935.

In 1875 in Montreal, a McGill student, J. Creighton, established the basic rules for [[hockey]] as we know it today. The world's first facility dedicated to hockey, the Westmount Arena was built in Montreal in 1898 while the first industrial refrigeration equipment for making artificial ice in Canada was installed in 1911 by Frank and Lester Patrick for their new arenas in Vancouver and Victoria. The [[Mutual Street Arena]], with its artificial ice surface, was built in Toronto in 1912. With the development of wide span roof structures the construction of large indoor ice rink stadiums became possible. These two technologies were used to build the [[Montreal Forum]], home of the legendary [[Montreal Canadiens]] hockey team, in Montreal in 1924 and [[Maple Leaf Gardens]] home of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]], in that city in 1931. Baseball's facilities were upgraded with construction of the new [[Maple Leaf Stadium]] on [[Lake Shore Boulevard]] in Toronto in 1926 and the De Lormier Downs Stadium (Hector Racine Stadium), in Montreal in 1927. Civic Stadium, now Ivor Wynne Stadium, was built in Hamilton, Ontario in 1930, to host the British Empire Games held there that year.

The construction of the very large, [[Basilica of Sainte-Anne-de-Beaupré]], near Quebec city was completed in 1926.

There were also advances in the lighting of public, commercial and industrial buildings. In 1938, after decades of development in  the US and Europe, General Electric in the US, and shortly thereafter Westinghouse, began to sell the [[fluorescent lamp]]. Because of its lower power consumption its use was quickly adopted for large-scale applications. These lights were quickly made available to the Canadian market through the Canadian subsidiaries of these two companies.

===Civil engineering and public works===
Notable engineering works of the period included the [[Second Narrows Bridge]], Vancouver, 1925, the R.C. Harris Filtration Plant, Toronto, Ontario, 1926, the [[Peace Bridge]], Fort Erie, Ontario, 1927, the [[Champlain Bridge (Ottawa)]], 1928, the Ocean Terminals, Halifax, Nova Scotia, 1928, Sea Island Airport ([[Vancouver International Airport]]), Vancouver, 1929, the [[Ambassador Bridge]], Windsor-Detroit, 1929, the [[Windsor-Detroit Tunnel]], 1930, the [[Broadway Bridge (Saskatoon)|Broadway Bridge]], Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, 1932, the [[Île d'Orléans Bridge]], near Quebec City, 1934, the [[Thousand Islands Bridge]], Ontario, 1937, the [[Pattullo Bridge]], Vancouver, 1937, the [[Lion's Gate Bridge]], Vancouver, British Columbia, 1938, Malton Airport ([[Toronto Pearson International Airport]]), Toronto, 1938, the [[Blue Water Bridge]], Sarnia, Ontario, 1938, the [[Queen Elizabeth Way]], Ontario, 1939, the [[Rainbow Bridge (Niagara Falls)]], 1941, Dorval Airport, ([[Montréal-Pierre Elliott Trudeau International Airport]]), Montreal, 1941 and the [[Alaska Highway]], Dawson Creek, British Columbia, 1942.

Canada’s first major [[roller coaster]] the [[Crystal Beach Cyclone]] was built at the Crystal Beach Amusement park in 1927. It quickly gained a reputation for its wild and even violent ride and one passenger, Amos Wiedrich was killed in 1938 when he stood up to take off his coat while the coaster was in motion.

The [[dump truck]] and [[bulldozer]] were introduced during these years for a variety of earth moving tasks including road building and canal construction. The dump truck was invented in Saint John, New Brunswick in 1920 by Robert T. Mawhinney and the bulldozer was developed in the US in 1923. Both quickly became popular worldwide.

===Medicine===
Medical treatment benefited from the introduction of the [[electrocardiograph]], used to diagnose heart problems, in large hospitals in the late twenties. There were also important innovations with respect to the treatment of epilepsy during this period. In Montreal, Dr. Wilder Penfield, with a grant from the US Rockefeller Foundation, founded the [[Montreal Neurological Institute]] at the [[Royal Victoria Hospital (Montreal)]], in 1934 to study and treat epilepsy and other neurological diseases.

===Defence and nuclear technology===
The military suffered a huge decline in the 1920s and 1930s. The [[Royal Canadian Air Force]] founded in 1924, was largely a bush and float plane operation. Only in the 1930s did it acquire a modest combat capability with a handful of British [[Armstrong Whitworth Siskin]] fighters and a squadron of [[Hawker Hurricane]] fighters as the clouds of war grew menacing. The [[Royal Canadian Navy]], perpetually starved for equipment acquired its first custom-built ships, the destroyers [[HMCS Saguenay (D79)]] and [[HMCS Skeena (D59)]] on May 22, 1931. In 1929 the army began to retire its horses and was issued four 6-wheeled Leyland tractors in 1929, to tow its 60-pound guns. Four 3-inch 20-cwt. anti-aircraft guns were taken on strength in 1937. As a reflection of this intense and diverse engineering activity, the Canadian Council of Professional Engineers was established in 1936. This organization was renamed [[Engineers Canada]] in 2007.

Canada was involved in the wartime [[Manhattan Project]] to build an atomic bomb, including the [[Montreal Laboratory]] for nuclear research by scientists from Britain, and American contracts with Canadian firms [[Eldorado Gold Mines]] for mining and processing uranium and a heavy water plant built by Consolidated Mining and Smelting (CMS) at [[Trail, British Columbia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

== The Television Age (1950–1980) ==

The years following World War II introduced even more innovations, including television, the transistor radio, synthetic fabrics, plastic, computers, super highways, shopping centres, atomic energy, nuclear weapons, transcontinental energy pipelines, long range electric transmission, transcontinental microwave networks, fast food, chemical fertilizer, insecticides, the birth control pill, jet aircraft, cable TV, colour TV, the instant replay, the audio cartridge and audio cassette, satellite communications and continental air defence systems.

===Communications (television and the transistor radio)===

In the early 1980s Canadian Satellite Communications (Cancom) assembled a package of Canadian and American television channels which it offered to remote communities throughout the northern regions of Canada. The signals were distributed by Anik satellite and made available to the local populace through cable. By the later part of the decade several hundred communities were using this service.&lt;ref&gt;Weir, E. Austin, The Struggle for National Broadcasting in Canada, McClelland &amp; Stewart, Toronto, 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also technological innovation in the telephone system. The first trans-Atlantic telephone cable, jointly owned by the Canadian Overseas Telecommunication Corporation, British Post Office and AT&amp;T, was brought into service in 1956, paving the way for telephone calls from Canada to Britain and Europe. An improved cable, CANTAT was installed in 1961. A similar service on the west coast, [[COMPAC]], the [[Commonwealth Pacific Cable System]] was inaugurated in 1963, linking Canada by undersea telephone cable with New Zealand and Australia. CN/CP Telecommunications introduced the well known Telex service to Canada in 1956. Direct distance dialing was initiated in Canada in 1958, beginning with customers in Toronto and on 1 July of that year the [[Trans-Canada Microwave]] system, known as the Trans-Canada Skyway, went into service.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Robert, A Voice from Afar: The History of Telecommunications in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, 1977, pp. 292–295.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept and operation of a dedicated [[emergency telephone number]] originated in Canada, where the City of Winnipeg established the world's first [[9-1-1]] service in 1959. The service eventually spread and was offered continent wide.

===Communications (satellites)===

The [[Anik (satellite)]] series of communications satellites initially built by Hughes Aircraft and operated by [[Telesat Canada]] starting in 1972 formed the basis of the world's first domestic satellite communications service. Telesat has launched a large number of satellites including, Anik A1 - 1972, Anik A2 - 1973, Anik A3 - 1975, Anik B - 1978, Anik D1 - 1982, Anik C3 - 1982, Anik C2 - 1983, Anik D2 - 1984, Anik C1 - 1985, Anik E2 - 1991, Anik E1 - 1991, MSAT - 1996, Nimiq 1 - 1999, Anik F1 - 2000, Nimiq 2 - 2002, Anik F2 - 2004, Anik F1R - 2005, and Anik F3 - 2007.

"Dataroute", the world's first national digital data system was introduced by CN/CP in 1973.

===Nuclear weapons===
After considerable political turmoil Canada acquired [[nuclear weapons]] from the Americans under a "dual key" arrangement on 1 January 1963. Genie air-to-air rockets armed with atomic warheads were based at RCAF Stations Comox, British Columbia, Bagotville, Quebec, and Chatham, New Brunswick, as the primary weapon for the newly acquired CF-101 interceptor. The nuclear armed [[BOMARC]] (Boeing Michigan Air Research Corporation) anti-aircraft missile was based at RCAF Stations North Bay, Ontario, and Lamacaza, Quebec. In Germany, as part of Canada's NATO commitment, nuclear free-fall bombs were acquired for the RCAF CF-104 strike fighter and the Canadian Army in Germany took possession of a battery of  [[MGR-1 Honest John|Honest John]] surface-to-surface battlefield rockets armed with nuclear warheads. By 1984 all these atomic weapons had been returned to the United States.

While there were no accidents involving nuclear weapons in Canadian hands, there were at least two involving USAF aircraft flying in Canadian airspace. On 14 February 1950 a USAF B-36 heavy bomber, serial 44-92075, carrying one Mark 4 (Fat Man type) atomic bomb experienced multiple engine failures while flying south off the coast of British Columbia and jettisoned the bomb over Squally Channel. The crew bailed out and the plane flew on autopilot for another 330&amp;nbsp;km before crashing on a mountainside in the Kispiox Valley. In eastern Canada on 10 November 1950, a USAF B-50 heavy bomber, serial 46-038, flying from Goose Bay, Labrador, to the United States, experienced engine trouble and in accordance with standard operating procedures, jettisoned the Mark 4 atomic bomb it was carrying over the St. Lawrence River, near Rivière-du-Loup. The bomb's own 2200&amp;nbsp;kg conventional explosives blew it apart before it hit the water. The plane flew on to a base in the US.&lt;ref&gt;Clearwater, John, Canadian Nuclear Weapons: The Untold Story of Canada's Cold War Arsenal, Dundurn, Press, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Computers===
[[Computers]] were introduced in a variety of areas at this time. The [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council Canada]] experimented with fire-control computers towards the end of the war. The University of Toronto Computer Centre, established in 1947, developed Canada’s first operational computer the University of Toronto Electronic Computer ([[UTEC]]) in 1951. This was followed by the purchase of FERUT (Ferranti University of Toronto) computer, by the Computer Centre in 1952.&lt;ref&gt;Eggleston, Wilfred, National Research in Canada: The NRC 1916–1966, Clarke Irwin, Toronto, 1978, pp 412–418.&lt;/ref&gt; The NRC used this computer in the early fifties for the hydrographic modeling of the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]] then under construction. Computers were also developed by other organizations, including the National Research Council, the NRC Computer (1954–1960), Ferranti Canada, mail sorter (1955), Computing Devices of Canada, the "Kicksorter" (1957–1963), the Defence Research Board, the DRTE (1960) and Sperry Canada, UMAC-5 (1962). [[Avro Canada]] in Toronto worked unsuccessfully to develop the fire-control computer for the [[Velvet Glove]] air-to-air missile for the highly advanced but ill-fated [[Avro Canada CF-105 Arrow]] interceptor. [[Avro Canada]] made extensive use of computers in calculations for aircraft design and manufacturing processes, including [[Numerical control|CNC]].  Other military developers included the Royal Canadian Navy with its [[DATAR]] system for the command and control of warships.

In the 1950s the Pinetree, Mid-Canada and DEW Line air-defence radar chains built across Canada relied heavily on computers. Certainly the largest and most powerful computer in Canada at the time was the IBM/USAF developed [[AN/FSQ-7]], installed in the late 1950s, {{convert|700|ft|m}} underground at RCAF Station North Bay, as the "brain" of the DEW Line System. The machine contained 55,000 vacuum tubes, weighed 275 tons and occupied a half-acre of floor space. It could perform 75,000 instructions per second.
 
By 1958 there were 41 computers in operation in Canada with big business, universities or the military. The most popular was the [[IBM 650]], which was used by 19 organizations, including Canadair Limited, Canadian General Electric, Ford Motor Company of Canada, Great West Life Assurance Company, Imperial Oil Limited, Orenda Engines Limited and the University of Toronto. Other models in use included the [[Bendix G-15]], 4, the [[ALWAC III-E]], 3, the [[IBM 705]], 3, the [[UNIVAC II]], 3, the [[Datatron|Datatron 205]], 2, the [[LGP-30]], 2, the Borroughs E 101, 1, the [[IBM 704]], 1, and the NRC 102A/D.&lt;ref&gt;Stachniak, Zbigniew, Campbell, Scott C., Computing in Canada, Transformation Series, No. 17, Canada Science and Technology Museum2009, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the first commercial users of computers was [[Trans-Canada Airlines]] (TCA). In 1961 Ferranti-Packard developed the [[ReserVec]] computer reservation system for TCA (now [[Air Canada]]). This formed the basis for the [[Ferranti-Packard 6000]] computer, and in 1963 two were sold in Canada, one to the Defence Research Establishment Atlantic, in Dartmouth, Nova Scotia and the other to the Toronto Stock Exchange.

In 1961 the [[Royal Bank of Canada]] was the first bank in Canada to introduce computers for its operations, followed by the [[Toronto-Dominion Bank]] in 1962. It was soon followed by the other large Canadian banks, including the [[Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce]] and [[Bank of Nova Scotia]]. When they introduced the [[credit card]] about the same time these records were kept on large central computers as well. It was this experience with large computer systems linking hundreds of branch offices across the country that enabled the banks to introduce the [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] and the [[debit card]], across Canada in the 1980s. Computers were also introduced to control complex industrial processes.  Interprovincial Pipe Line Limited of Edmonton was one of the first Canadian companies to employ computers as a means of controlling the flow of gas in its very large pipeline system. [[Atomic Energy of Canada Limited]] used computers to control atomic fission in its power reactors. In 1977 the [[Toronto Stock Exchange]] became the first stock market in the world convert to electronic trading with the introduction of the its Computer Assisted Trading System. Twenty years later, in 1997, the exchange closed its trading floor and converted to a fully automated, computer-driven trading system.

Computers were also recognized as a tool for policing. The [[Canadian Police Information Centre]] which was established in 1966 under the auspices of the RCMP, has operated, since that date, a national computer data base that provides information relating to criminal activity in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Police Information Centre www.cpic-cipc.ca/English/index.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period [[Canada Post]] applied computer readable codes to speed the delivery of mail. On 1 April 1971 the postal code system was introduced. The technique involved the use of a six-character geographic code placed on the envelope or parcel by the sender. The code was in turn machine scanned by a computer-driven optical reader that signaled the sorting equipment to direct the item to the proper destination. While technically effective, the introduction of the system lead to serious labour trouble at Canada Post for several years by unionized workers who were afraid of pay cuts or job loss ([[Postal codes in Canada]]).

===Transportation===
In transportation, several significant works were completed, including the [[Toronto Subway]], 1954, the Trans-Canada Gas Pipeline, 1958, the [[St. Lawrence Seaway]], 1959, [[Trans-Canada Highway]], completed in 1962, the [[Montreal Subway]], 1966, [[GO Transit]], Toronto area, 1967 and [[Highway 401]], Ontario, completed in 1968.

On August 10, 1949, the [[Avro Canada C102 Jetliner]], a mid-range four-engine passenger jet, made its first flight, just 13 days after the world's first and eight years before the US's first, the [[Boeing 707]].  Trans-Canada Airlines (later [[Air Canada]]) and [[Canadian Pacific Airlines]] introduced jet passenger service with the [[de Havilland Comet]], DC-8, DC9, B727 and B-737. The B-747 was introduced by these companies in the early seventies. In the sixties and early seventies De Havilland Aircraft of Canada in Toronto developed the [[DHC-7 Dash 7]] and DHC-8 Dash 8 [[STOL]] aircraft. These were used to provide passenger service to small city centre airports in Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal. A number of international carriers also acquired these aircraft to provide similar services elsewhere in the world. The first Canadian owned [[helicopter]] began operation in Canada on 12 March 1947. On that date Photographic Survey Corporation took possession of a Bell Bell 47B-3, registration CF-FJA.&lt;ref&gt;Milberry, Larry, Aviation in Canada, McGraw-Hill Ryerson, Toronto, 1979, p.242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The development of trans-oceanic aviation in the postwar years created a need for accurate weather information over the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. An international agreement in 1946 established 13 Ocean Weather Stations with Canada being responsible for two, ocean station Baker several hundred miles off the east coast from 1947 to 1950 and for ocean station Papa {{convert|900|mi|km}} off the coast of Vancouver from 1950 to 1981. A number of ships, both converted RCN vessels and purpose built CCG weather ships were stationed at these points to gather weather information during these years. Ships involved included, HMCS St. Stephen, HMCS St. Catherines, HMCS Stone Town, CCGS Vancouver, and CCGS Quadra.

Of note was the transit of the Northwest Passage in 1954 by [[HMCS Labrador]], Canada's first purpose built icebreaker, which was acquired that same year, in service with the Royal Canadian Navy.

Of particular significance was the conversion from steam to diesel by Canada's two great railways. Beginning in the mid fifties the CPR and Canadian National Railways began replacing their steam locomotives with diesel locomotives. By 1960 the conversion was mostly complete.

The [[Volkswagen]] was introduced to Canadians in 1952 and became very popular with drivers who wanted greater fuel economy than that provided by the larger cars then on the market. It was sold in Canada until 1977. The seat belt became a standard feature of domestic passenger cars in the late sixties. The [[catalytic converter]] was also introduced during these years. The first devices, designed to reduce air pollution from automobile exhaust, were installed in the 1975 model year for US cars manufactured in Canada. Because of environmental concerns and the fact that it was not compatible with these converters, the major gasoline companies in Canada began to eliminate the sale of [[leaded gasoline]] that same year.

Although Armand Bombardier invented the [[snowmobile]], the initial production model, the B-7 dating from 1937 was a large 7 passenger vehicle. It was not until 1959 with the development of the small gas engine that the individual snowmobile or Ski-doo was produced by Bombardier ([[Bombardier Recreational Products]]) in the company factory at Valcourt, Quebec. A number of competitors in Canada and elsewhere entered the market and sales of snowmobiles skyrocketed with 2 million being sold worldwide between 1970 and 1973. To this day, snowmobiles remain popular in Canada and other regions with snowy winters.

Pedestrian walkways have become important features of some Canadian cities. Climate controlled underground passageways and shopping malls have been features of the downtown cores of Toronto ([[PATH (Toronto)]]) and Montreal ([[Underground City, Montreal]]) since the mid-sixties. Arguable the most unusual, is the [[Plus 15]] system in downtown Calgary. Initiated in 1970 it presently consists of 57 bridges and 16&amp;nbsp;km of enclosed climate controlled passageways suspended {{convert|15|ft|m}} above ground level which permit pedestrians to walk anywhere in the downtown core summer or winter without ever going outside.

===Atomic energy===
Beginning in the mid-1950s nuclear-generated electricity was developed under a partnership of industry and government at both the federal and provincial levels. A [[NPD reactor|demonstration power reactor, the NPD]] was built at Rolphton, Ontario in 1962, followed by a commercial-scale [[CANDU]] prototype at Douglas Point in 1968.  In 1971 electricity became commercially available from the large (ultimately 8-unit) Pickering station near Toronto, Ontario and, starting in 1977, the Bruce station (ultimately 8-units as well), near Kinkardine, Ontario. These were followed by the Gentilly-2 Atomic Electric Plant, Trois-Rivières, Quebec and the Point Lepreau Atomic Electric Plant, Point Lepreau, New Brunswick both in 1982. The electric current supplied by commercial hydro companies to consumers was changed and organizations like Hydro Ontario converted from 25 cycles to 60 cycles during the ten-year period from 1949 to 1959.&lt;ref&gt;Eggleston, Wilfred, Canada's Nuclear Story, Clarke Irwin, Toronto, 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

The introduction of this technology was not without mishap. On 12 December 1952 the experimental NRX reactor at Chalk River suffered a failure of its cooling system and underwent a partial meltdown. On May 24, 1958, the newly commissioned NRU reactor also a Chalk River experienced a major accident when one of the uranium filled fuel rods caught fire and seriously contaminated the reactor building with radioactive debris.

===Energy (oil and gas)===
The modern era of oil production in Canada began in 1947 when Imperial made its major discovery at Leduc, Alberta. The availability of oil and gas in Alberta, a half continent away from central Canada provided the impetus for the construction of two huge transcontinental pipelines to the eastern Canadian market. The crude oil pipeline was the first to be built. The construction of first section of the Interprovincial Pipeline from Edmonton to Regina to Superior Wisconsin in the US began in 1950 and was completed in an astonishing 150 days. In 1953 the pipeline was extended through the US to Sarnia, Ontario and from Sarnia to Toronto in 1957. At the time of its completion it was the longest pipeline in the world. The oil and gasoline industry has grown tremendously since then, mainly to meet the demand for gasoline created by the popularity of the car and for home heating oil. Major [[oil refineries]] have been built in Vancouver, British Columbia, Edmonton, Alberta, Sarnia, Ontario, Montreal, Quebec and Saint John, New Brunswick.

The construction of the transcontinental oil pipeline was followed by that of the gas carrying Trans-Canada pipeline. Work began in 1956 at the Alberta/Saskatchewan border advancing to Regina, Winnipeg and Port Arthur, Ontario in 1957. Construction was not without mishap as during a pressure test in 1957 five kilometres of pipe blew up near Dryden, Ontario. The line crossed the very technically difficult Canadian Shield north of Lake Superior and reached Toronto and Montreal in 1958.  At the time of its completion it was the longest pipeline in the world. Political controversies related to the construction of the pipeline contributed to the fall of the St. Laurent Liberal government in 1957. 
Gas pipelines were also built in Alberta, the largest being that of Alberta Gas Trunk Lines, incorporated in 1954 and British Columbia, where the [[Westcoast Transmission Co.]] system was completed in 1957. While large pipelines carried natural gas across the continent smaller distribution systems were necessary to carry gas into factories and individual homes, where it was used as a source of heat. Very complex local understreet pipeline networks were constructed in cities across Canada to meet this requirement.

Other energy projects of the period included  the Lakeview Generating Station, Mississauga, Ontario, 1962, the W.A.C.Bennett (hydro) Dam, British Columbia, 1967, the Gardiner (hydro) Dam, Saskatchewan, 1968, the Churchill Falls Hydro Dam, Labrador, 1971, the [[Nanticoke Generating Station]] (largest coal-fired plant in North America), Nanticoke, Ontario, 1978 and La Grande 2 Hydro Dam, Quebec, 1979. The energy crisis of 1973 had domestic repercussions with many consumers taking steps to reduce energy costs through the installation of improved home insulation and wood burning stoves.

The existence in Alberta of large quantities of surface bitumen (oil) mixed with sand has been known for many years. In the late 1970s the commercial production of [[synthetic crude]] oil from this bitumen began near Fort McMurray. Construction at this site, by a company known as [[Syncrude]], began in 1973 and the first crude oil was produced there in 1978. The complex and costly production process involves scraping the sticky bitumen-laden sand from the surface, transporting it to a processing facility, removing the sand from the bitumen and upgrading the bitumen to a product known as light sweet crude. The technical scale of the operation is very large. Initially the sandy tar-like bitumen was scrapped from the ground using gigantic powered rotating mechanical wheels equipped with scraping buckets and the [[oil sand]] was placed on conveyor belts for transport to the processing plant. However, the severely cold Albert winters caused the continuous breakdown of the machinery and a new technique was developed. This involves the use of gigantic power shovels and dumptrucks to deliver the bitumen laden sand to the processing plant. Once at the plant the bitumen is removed from the sand with a process that involves the use of hot water. The bitumen is then subjected to fluid coking, [[hydroprocessing]], hydrotreating and reblending. Syncrude is the largest producer of synthetic crude oil from bitumen sand in the world and the largest producer of oil from a single site in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, Canadian Oil Sands Trust, Annual Report, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
The forestry industry underwent a notable process of mechanization in the postwar years. The most visible change was the introduction of the [[chain saw]]. When originally developed for modern use in the 1920s, this heavy, gasoline engine-driven machine required two men for its operation. However, improvements in engine technology eventually made the saw small and light enough to be operated easily by one person. In 1944 one of the first industrial users, [[Bloedel, Stewart and Welch|Bloedel Stewart and Welch Ltd]]. in British Columbia had 112 chain saws in operation, but their use accounted for only a small part of total forestry tree cutting. In 1950 less than one percent of pulpwood in Canada was cut with chain saws. However, by 1955 this figure had grown to more than 50%.

Other machines were also introduced during this period. The first [[feller buncher]] was used by the Quebec North Shore Paper Company in 1957. Hydraulic tree shears were first used in 1966 by the Abitibi Pulp and Paper Company Limited ([[Abitibi-Consolidated]]). Snowmobiles and tracked machines replaced animals for the hauling of logs. In 1948 several Bombardier machines were employed to this end by the Ste. Anne Power Company Limited in Quebec. In 1959 Timberland Machines of Woodstock, Ontario developed the Timberbuncher, a self-propelled machine which could move through the forest, cut a whole tree at its base (a process known as full tree harvesting) and, using a hydraulic arm, place it into a pile for hauling. Machines that stripped the branches from felled trees, a process known as delimbing, were also introduced at this time.

With the help of these technologies, the Canadian [[pulp and paper industry]] grew to become one of the major suppliers of newsprint in the world through the operations of companies such as [[MacMillan Bloedel Limited]], Repap Enterprises Inc., Kruger Inc., Great Lakes Forest Products Ltd, [[British Columbia Forest Products|British Columbia Forest Products Ltd.]], Consolidated-Bathurst Inc., [[Canadian Forest Products|Canadian Forest Products Ltd.]], CIP Inc., Domtar Pulp &amp; Paper Products Group and Abitibi Consolidated.

The use of [[pesticides]] was a prominent feature of postwar agriculture across Canada. Insecticides based on fluorine, arsenic, rotenone, nicotine pyrethrum as well as herbicides using sulphiric acid, arsenites and salt and finally fungicides based on sulphur, mercury or copper have been very effective in controlling life forms that degrade agricultural output. At the same time these compounds have also had a negative effect beyond their intended sphere of use. [[DDT]] was registered for use in Canada from 1946 until 1985, when its use was banned. The product was never manufactured in Canada. [[Food irradiation]], in particular the irradiation of potatoes to prevent sprouting while in storage, was approved for use in Canada in 1960.

Potash-based [[chemical fertilizer]] became an important element of increased agricultural production in Canada and around the world in the postwar era. In Saskatchewan techniques were introduced for the mining of the huge potash deposits found there. These involve both "dry" and "wet", methods of mining. The dry method involves the sinking of a vertical shaft and the use of large powered cutting machines to cut into the potash horizontally. The wet technique known as solution mining is used to access potash at greater depths. This involves drilling a vertical hole into the deposit into which is pumped hot water. The liquid dissolves the potash underground and then returns to the surface, where another process separates the mineral from the water.&lt;ref&gt;web site, Western Potash Corp. www.westernpotash.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Office automation===
Business administration underwent technological change. The [[ball point pen]] was marketed in the US in October 1945 and in Canada shortly thereafter. The [[IBM Selectric typewriter]], introduced in 1961, quickly became popular with businesses in Canada, as did the [[Xerox]] photocopier in the 1960s.

===Medicine===
There was important progress in medical technology during this period. In 1945 Dr. Stuart Stanbury established a National Blood Transfusion Programme for the [[Canadian Red Cross Society]], thus making available to those in need, a dependable source of blood for medical purposes. The associated test for blood typing was introduced at the same time. Blood tests would become increasingly sophisticated in the coming years. The [[electroencephalograph]], used for the diagnosis of neurological disorders was introduced in major Canadian medical institutions in the late forties.

The techniques for the mass production and distribution of vaccines and for the mass public inoculation were introduced during these years. Polio was a disease that affected large numbers of Canadian children during the first part of the 20th century. In the US, research by Dr. Jonas Salk in the late 1940s led to the discovery of vaccine for the prevention of this disease. However, there was no technique for volume manufacture of the drug. Connaught Laboratories of Toronto developed a synthetic culture known as "medium 199", which enabled the mass production of this [[polio vaccine]] beginning in 1952. A successful all-Canadian mass inoculation of children using the new vaccine was undertaken in the spring of 1955, the first such mass public health campaign of its type in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Rutty, Christopher J., Connaught and the Canadian Polio Vaccine Story, CONNTACT, Vol. 9, No. 3 June 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Antibiotics]] such as penicillin were quickly made available to the general public in the postwar years.

There was also progress with respect to the treatment of heart disease. The [[pacemaker]] invented with significant Canadian participation was used to treat patients with arrhythmia. For more serious problems [[open heart surgery]] became an option for patients and permitted the repair of faulty heart valves, the clearing of blocked coronary arteries and the resolution of other problems. Canada's first [[heart transplant]] was performed on 31 May 1968, by Dr. Pierre Godin the Chief Surgeon at the Montreal Heart Institute, on patient Albert Murphy of Chomedy, Quebec a 59-year-old retired butcher suffering from degenerative heart disease. The operation took place about six months after the world's first, by Dr. Christian Barnard.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, CBC Digital Archives, www.archives.cbc.ca/on_this_day/05/31/.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Neurosurgery]] was introduced in a substantive way in the 1960s.

Cancer patients were provided with a new option, [[radiation therapy]], through what was popularly known as the "Cobalt Bomb", again developed with important Canadian input. The use of [[radio isotopes]] for diagnostics was also introduced. [[Chemotherapy]] also became a treatment option. In 1960 the use of a subcutaneous arteriovenous shunt along with the artificial kidney machine allowed [[hemodialysis]] for patients with chronic renal failure.

During these years the Montreal Neurological Institute pioneered the development of medical imaging technologies introducing Canada's first [[Computed axial tomography|CAT]] scan in 1973, [[Positron emission tomography|PET]] scan in 1975 and [[MRI]] in 1982. The technique of [[medical ultrasonography]] also became widely available beginning in the late 1960s and was especially popular with expectant mothers interested in the health and sex of their fetus. The number of these machines in use has grown greatly over the years. In 2004 there were about 150 MRI units and about 350 CAT units in use in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Press Release CIHI, "CIHI report shows increase in MRI and CT scanners, up more than 75% in the last decade." Medical Imaging in Canada, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

The corneal [[contact lenses]] first developed in 1949 gained mass appeal in Canada and elsewhere in the 1960s. Made of [[polymethyl methacrylate]] (PMMA) they could be worn up to 16 hours a day.

Developments in [[orthodontics]] made the straightening of the teeth of children with "braces" commonplace. Children were also often on the receiving end of the tonsillectomy a fashionable surgical procedure during these years.

The surgical replacement of body parts also became possible and was used to treat ailing kidneys and joints such as knees and hips. The availability of cosmetic implants became popular during these years. In 1962, in the US, Dow Corning developed the silicone gel-filled [[breast implant]] which was used by women for surgical breast augmentation. The procedure was common in Canada. In recent years implants containing saline solution have also become popular.

Pharmaceuticals attained a high-profile. The availability of the [[birth control pill]] in 1960 made it possible for women to protect themselves from unwanted pregnancy. Stress could be treated with [[tranquilizers]], such as valium, introduced in 1963. The consumption of [[vitamins]]  became widespread and supplements were added to staple foods such as milk and bread and were taken in pill form. While most of these drugs were safe, one, [[thalidomide]], had horrific consequences for its users. Thalidomide was invented in West Germany in 1954 by Chemie Grunenthal as a sedative. It was noted that the drug was particularly effective in treating the symptoms of morning sickness associated with pregnancy. The drug was made available under prescription to Canadians beginning 1 April 1961. Tragically it was discovered that the drug caused miscarriage and severe birth defects.  As a result, the drug was withdrawn from the Canadian market on 2 March 1962.&lt;ref&gt;web site, www.thalidomide.ca, Thalidomide Victims Association of Canada,&lt;/ref&gt;

The "recreational" use of "soft drugs" such a [[marijuana]], [[LSD]] and [[hashish]] became part of the 1960s counter culture.  Marijuana was often produced locally using the hydroponic method.

===Domestic and consumer technology (in the home)===
The car, cheap gasoline and postwar affluence created boom conditions for the expansion of [[suburbia]]. Several standard designs for the single family home on a standard lot were reproduced cookie-cutter style row-upon-row in cities across Canada as subdivision after subdivision sprang up radiating from the central core. The designs were thoroughly modern, reflecting the optimism of the era, usually with a peaked roof, asphalt shingles and a brick or wood siding exterior and included a living room, kitchen and occasionally dining room and two, three or four bedrooms and a full basement made of poured concrete or cinder block. Floors were usually made of varnished hardwood planks and the walls and ceilings of gyprock. Copper piping brought running water from the serviced street and copper wiring electricity from the rear lot line. Clay tile pipe carried the sewage from the flush, sit toilet to the main sewer line running under the street. There was usually a driveway beside the house for the family car, and less frequently a carport or garage.

Most homes were equipped with a telephone often with a "party" line but these became rare by the 1960s. A television set was also common in almost all homes by the end of the 1950s and the record player gave way to the hi-fi stereo. Almost all kitchens were equipped with electric refrigerators and electric or less commonly gas, stoves.  Where there was gas it was usually piped to the home through a main line running under the street. There were a variety of electrical "labour saving" devices including electrical mixers can openers and carving knives. Central heating was a standard feature and coal, delivered to the home by a diesel powered truck, was the dominant fuel source in the early postwar years. However, as the 1950s progressed coal gave way to oil and gas heating. Home furnishings were almost all mass-produced and made from wood, fabric and various types of stuffing for cushions. In the kitchen metal chrome tube chairs and formica topped tables were popular. The small front and back yard were maintained with the help of a gasoline-powered lawn mower, and the hedge and bushes were trimmed with electric clippers. In the early 1960s the high-rise apartment building began to make its appearance in large cities. The self-supporting steel structures were usually seven stories or more, and large buildings contained hundreds of dwelling units. Initially they were especially visible along Highway 401 in Toronto, Metropolitan Boulevard in Montreal and the north shore of English Bay in Vancouver. Their construction was possible due to the introduction of the high-rise crane, which to this day remains a common feature of city skylines.

The arrival of television had an effect on eating habits. In 1953, C.A. Swanson &amp; Sons introduced the [[TV dinner]] to the US market. The pre-cooked food items, including, meat, potatoes and a vegetable were placed in the segments of an aluminum tray and frozen. The consumer purchased the frozen product and heated it in the oven for about 25 minutes. It could be eaten out of the tray.  In 1960, Swanson, a subsidiary of the Campbell Soup Company, built a factory in Listowel, Ontario to manufacture TV dinners and other Campbell frozen products for the Canadian market. The [[electric toothbrush]] introduced in 1959 has become very popular in Canada since the 1990s.

The steel [[aerosol spray]] can with the gas propellant, and "crimp on nozzle" was developed in the US in 1949. It quickly became a favored type of packaging in Canada for a number of products including whipped cream, deodorant, bug spray and hair spray. The gas propellant, usually a [[chlorofluorocarbon]] (CFC), became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s when research demonstrated that it had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile [[hydrocarbons]]. The disposable [[diaper]] was introduced to the Canadian market in 1972 by [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] Canada Ltd. The chemistry of hair colouring was introduced to the domestic scene in the US and Canada in 1956, when [[Clairol]] began marketing a home hair colouring kit for women that could be purchased for a modest price at a local pharmacy or grocery store. Invented in Canada, the green plastic garbage bag ([[Bin bag]]) was introduced to Canadians in the late 1960s. Patented in 1955 by Swiss engineer, [[George de Mestral]], [[velcro]], a two sided fastening technology based on hooks and loops, was introduced to a number of countries, including Canada, in the late 1950s. In Montreal, Velek Ltd. acquired the exclusive marketing rights for velcro in North and South America and Japan.

The format for sound recordings changed in the years just following the war. In the US, [[Columbia Records]] introduced the long playing (LP) 33{{frac|1|3}} format in 1948. Columbia made an agreement with [[Sparton Records]], of London, Ontario, established in 1930, for the manufacture and distribution of its LP records in Canada. Not to be caught short, [[RCA Victor]] in the US responded in 1949 with its own technological innovation the 45 rpm record (with the big hole in the centre) and manufactured and distributed this new format for the Canadian market through its Canadian subsidiary, RCA Victor of Canada, established in Montreal in 1929. The video home system ([[VHS]]) released in 1976 by [[Victor Company of Japan, Limited]] (JVC), quickly became popular in Canada and was used to record TV programmes or to play VHS tapes of Hollywood movies that could be rented in neighborhood video stores that soon became a common feature of suburban strip malls. In 2003 the popularity of DVD surpassed VHS and by 2006 the technology had become obsolete.

The introduction of the [[credit card]] complimented the appearance of the shopping mall. In 1968 a number of Canadian banks including the Bank of Nova Scotia, the Royal Bank of Canada, the Toronto-Dominion Bank and the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce began issuing the [[Chargex]] credit card to customers. In 1977 these cards were reissued by the same banks under the [[VISA]] brand name. The [[MasterCard]] credit card became available to Canadians in 1973.

===Domestic and consumer technology (in the Suburbs)===

The booming growth of the suburbs led to the appearance of the [[shopping mall]], a low-rise steel frame, commercial structure housing a number of retail outlets and surrounded by acres of asphalt parking lot for large numbers of cars. The first in Canada included the Norgate Shopping Centre, Saint-Laurent, Quebec, 1949, the Dorval Shopping Centre, Dorval, Quebec, 1950, the Park Royal Shopping Centre, West Vancouver, British Columbia, 1950, the Sunnybrook Plaza, Toronto, 1951 and York Mills, Toronto, 1952.

The hospitality industry was similarly affected and [[fast food]] drive-in restaurants began to appear. In 1951 the first St. Hubert BBQ restaurant opened its doors on St-Hubert street in Montreal. A&amp;W opened its first Canadian operation in Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1957. In 1959 [[Harvey's]] opened its first eatery on Yonge Street in Richmond Hill. In Hamilton, Ontario, the  first [[Tim Hortons]] restaurant opened in 1964. The first McDonald's restaurant outside the United States was opened in Richmond, British Columbia in 1967 and Pizza Delight was founded in Shediac, New Brunswick, in 1968.

Cinema attendance boomed after the war and with it innovations in cinema design. The first double-screen cinema, The Elgin, opened its doors in Ottawa in 1946 and the [[drive-in cinema]] became popular after the war. However, the long cold Canadian winters discouraged the widespread diffusion of this type of film exhibition. The dramatic [[IMAX]] large-scale cinema format was invented as the result of developments in cinematic technology during Expo '67 in Montreal. The world's first permanent Imax cinema, Cinesphere, was built at [[Ontario Place (theme park)|Ontario Place]] in Toronto in 1971. Others were built in Vancouver for Expo '86 and at the [[Canadian Museum of Civilization]] in Gatineau, Quebec, in 1989. By 1995 there were 129 Imax cinemas entertaining audiences around the world. The audio cartridge and audio cassette became popular in the early 1970s with the cassette eventually winning the battle of the formats. This compact medium led to the appearance of high quality in-car sound systems.

The New [[Woodbine Racetrack]] for thoroughbred horse racing opened to the public in Toronto in 1956 (simply Woodbine after 1963) replacing the original Woodbine which was built in 1874. Canada’s first purpose-built auto racing track, the [[Westwood Motorsport Park]] was built in Coquitlam, British Columbia in 1959. The [[Mosport International Raceway]], north of Bowmanville, Ontario opened to the public in 1961 and hosted the Canadian Grand Prix Formula 1 races from 1967 to 1977. [[La Ronde (amusement park)|La Ronde]] became Canada’s largest amusement park when it opened in 1967 as part of [[Expo '67]] in Montreal. It is popular to this day for a number of roller coasters, including The Boomerang, [[Cobra (La Ronde)|Cobra]], [[Goliath (La Ronde)|Goliath]], [[Le Monstre]] and [[Vampire (La Ronde)|Vampire]].

===Materials===
[[Detergent]], a replacement for soap, introduced in the postwar years, was used to keep clothes and dishes clean through the action of its active ingredient, tetrapropylene, a derivative of petroleum. The popular Tide brand became available in 1948. In 1964 [[permanent press]] fabrics were invented in the US by Ruth Rogan Benerito, a scientist at the Physical Chemistry Research Group of the Cotton Chemical Reactions Laboratory and introduced to Canada shortly thereafter. The press resulted from the treatment of the fabric with formaldehyde. Invented by DuPont scientist Dr. Roy J. Plunkett in 1938,  [[polytetrafluoroethylene]], a polymer considered the world’s most slippery substance, was introduced commercially as [[Teflon]], in 1946 in the US. It is used in a wide variety of applications, including as a non-stick coating on the cooking surface of pots and pans and is manufactured in Canada by DuPont in Mississauga, Ontario. Krazy Glue ([[ethyl cyanoacrylate]]) was introduced to Canada in 1973.

===Waste disposal and sewage treatment===
In the postwar years Canadian municipalities began treating raw sewage, which up to that time, with a few notable exceptions, had been allowed to flow directly from their sewer systems into nearby streams, rivers, lakes and oceans. New facilities were added in Toronto including the Highland Creek Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1956 and the Humber Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1960. Vancouver built a number of sewage treatment facilities including the Lions Gate Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1961, the Iona Island Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1963 and the Lulu Island Wastewater Treatment Plant in 1973. The City of Ottawa built the Green's Creek Pollution Control Center (now Robert O. Pickard Environmental Centre) in 1961. In 1970 the City of Montreal began the construction of a large sewer network which channeled all effluent to the treatment plant at Rivière-des-Prairies on the east end of the island and became operational in 1996. By 1980, 64% of Canadians were served by sewage treatment, with the figure rising to 78% in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, OECD, www.environmentalindicators.com/htdocs/indicators/7muni.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

Public and industrial concern with air pollution and [[acid rain]] led to measures being taken by a number of companies to cut back on harmful atmospheric emissions. In 1972, [[Vale Inco|Inco]] undertook steps to reduce emissions of SO2 and other gases by installing scrubbers and a {{convert|1250|ft|m|adj=on}} chimney at its Copper Cliff smelter in Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;Web site, Vale Inco, www.inco.com/business/history/#&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public works and civil engineering ===

Bridges of note included the [[Angus L. Macdonald Bridge]] in Halifax 1954, the [[Oak Street Bridge]], Vancouver, 1957, the [[Burlington Bay James N. Allan Skyway]], 1958, [[Ogdensburg-Prescott International Bridge]], 1960, the [[Queensborough Bridge]], Vancouver 1960, the [[Sault Ste. Marie International Bridge]], Sault Ste. Marie, Ontario, 1962, the [[Champlain Bridge, Montreal]], 1962, the [[Lewiston-Queenston Bridge]], Niagara Falls, Ontario, 1962, the [[Port Mann Bridge]], Vancouver, 1964, the [[Macdonald-Cartier Bridge]], Ottawa, 1965, the [[Pont de la Concorde (Montreal)]], 1966, the [[Prince Edward Viaduct]], Toronto 1966, the [[Laviolette Bridge]], Trois-Rivières, Quebec, 1967, the [[Saint John Harbour Bridge]], Saint John, New Brunswick, 1968, the [[Dinsmore Bridge]], Vancouver, 1969, the [[A. Murray McKay Bridge]], Halifax, 1970, the [[Pierre Laporte Bridge]], Quebec City, 1970, the [[Portage Bridge]], Ottawa, 1973 and the [[Arthur Laing Bridge]], Vancouver, 1976.

This was also an era of gigantism, and there were both successes and failures. Beginning in 1963, massive civil engineering works were undertaken in the St. Lawrence River in Montreal to build the site for the 1967 World's Fair, known as [[Expo 67]].  The gigantic [[Red River Floodway]], which opened in 1968, was designed to carry flood water from a rising Red River around the heart of the City of Winnipeg. It was completed in 1968 and proved successful when used for the first time in 1969. At the time of its completion it was the second largest earth-moving project in the world, after the Panama Canal.

Northwest of Montreal thousands of acres of fertile farmland were expropriated to build the huge new [[Mirabel International Airport]], which opened in 1975. The facility was to be linked to the heart of Montreal with a fast train. The train was never built and both passengers and air carriers stayed away in droves. The site eventually became a quiet industrial airport, home to the production facilities for Bombardier regional jets. On the other hand, the [[James Bay Project]] undertaken in Quebec at the same time was a booming success. Several large dams on the La Grande River with their associated long distance transmission lines provide Hydro-Québec with an important source of electricity.

The [[CN Tower]], the world's tallest free-standing structure, was constructed in Toronto in 1975.

===Architecture===

Important skyscrapers, including [[Place Ville Marie]] (Royal Bank), Montreal, 1962, the Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce Tower, Montreal, 1962, the Edifice Trust Royal (C.I.L. House), Montreal, 1962, the Toronto Dominion Bank Tower, Toronto, 1967, The Simpson Tower, Toronto, 1968, the Hôtel Château Champlain, Montreal, 1967, the Royal Trust Tower, Toronto, 1969, Royal Centre, Vancouver, 1972, [[Inco Superstack]], Sudbury, Ontario, 1972, [[First Canadian Place]], Toronto, 1975, Harbour Centre,  Vancouver, 1976, the Complexe Desjardins, la Tour du Sud, Montreal, 1976, the Scotia Tower, Calgary, 1976, the Scotia Tower, Vancouver, 1977, Royal Bank Plaza, South Tower, Toronto, 1977 and the First Bank Tower, Toronto, 1979, represented significant architectural achievements during this period.

The massive [[Saint Joseph's Oratory]], the largest church in Canada, the construction of which began in 1924, was completed in 1967 on the north slope of Mont Royal in Montreal.

Notable large sports facilities included, Empire Stadium, Vancouver, 1954, [[McMahon Stadium]], Calgary, Alberta, 1960, the Montreal Automobile Stadium (Autostad) 1966, the [[Olympic Stadium]], Montreal, 1976 and [[Commonwealth Stadium (Edmonton)]], 1978.

== The PC Age (1980–2000) ==

[[Microelectronics]] became a part of everyday life during this period. The [[personal computer]] became a feature of most homes, and the microchip found its way into a bewildering variety of products from cars to washing machines.

===The microchip and digital computing===
In 1977 the first commercially produced personal computers were invented in the US: the Apple II, the PET 2001 and the TRS-80. They were quickly made available in Canada. In 1980 IBM introduced the IBM PC. Microsoft provided the operating system, through IBM, where it was referred to as PC&amp;nbsp;DOS and as a stand-alone product known as MS-DOS. This created a rivalry for personal computer operating systems, Apple and Microsoft, which endures to this day. A large variety of special-use software and applications have been developed for use with these operating systems. There have also been a multiplicity of hardware manufacturers which have produced a wide variety of personal computers, and the heart of these machines, the central processing unit, has increased in speed and capacity by leaps and bounds. There were 1,560,000 [[personal computers]] in Canada by 1987, of which 650,000 were in homes, 610,000 in businesses and 300,000 in educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;web site, The Canadian Encyclopedia, www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com, Computer Industry&lt;/ref&gt; Canadian producers of micro-computers included Sidus Systems, 3D Microcomputers, Seanix Technology and [[MDG Computers]]. Of note is the fact that these machines were based on digital technology, and their widespread and rapid introduction to Canada at the same time that the telephone system was undergoing a similar transformation would herald an era of rapid technological advance in the field of communication and computing.

The [[laptop computer]] also appeared during these years and achieved notable popularity in Canada beginning in the 1990s. In 1981 the first commercially available portable computer, the [[Osborne 1]], became available. Other models followed, including the [[Kaypro II]] in 1982, the popular [[Compaq Portable]] and Tandy Corporation [[TRS-80 Model 100]] both in 1983, the IBM PC Convertible, 1986, the [[Macintosh Portable]], 1989 and Power Book, 1991. The latter models in particular were popular with both professionals and consumers.

In the 1970s and 1980s [[word processing]], a method for "typing" documents using a keyboard linked to a computer and a video screen, was developed. Early machines were dedicated exclusively to this function and a notable Canadian contribution, the Superplus IV, produced by AES Data in Montreal in 1981, became widely popular. However, the rise of the personal computer and the invention of PC-compatible word processing software, such as [[WordPerfect]] in 1982 and [[Microsoft Word]] in 1983, made stand-alone word processors obsolete. [[Spreadsheet]] software also became popular for accounting purposes, notably [[Microsoft Excel]], which was also introduced to the world and Canadian market in 1983. These new machines with their new software quickly dominated the market and became an almost universal feature of any Canadian office.

===Supercomputers===

In 1987 there were considerable numbers of larger computers in Canada, including 25,000 mainframe and mini-computers. But the most powerful of all were the [[supercomputers]]. The [[Meteorological Service of Canada]] has been a noted user of large computers and has pioneered the Canadian use of supercomputers. Machines used have included the Bendix G20, 1962, an IBM 360-95 scientific mainframe computer, 1967, its first supercomputer a CDC 7600 from Control Data Corporation, 1973, a Cray 1S supercomputer, 1983, a NEC supercomputer, 1993 and an IBM supercomputer in 2003. At the time of its installation this latter machine was the most powerful computer in Canada.

The Communications Security Establishment (CSE), Canada's "electronic spy" agency has been a notable user of supercomputers. CSE code breaking capabilities degraded substantially in the 1960s and 1970s but were upgraded with the acquisition of a  Cray X-MP/11 (modified) supercomputer delivered to the Sir Leonard Tilley Building in Ottawa, in March 1985. It was, at the time, the most powerful computer in Canada. In the early 1990s, the Establishment purchased a  Floating Point Systems FPS 522-EA supercomputer at a cost of $1,620,371. This machine was upgraded to a Cray S-MP superserver after Cray acquired Floating Point Systems in December 1991 and used the Folklore Operating System supplied by the NSA in the US.&lt;ref&gt;http://luxexumbra.blogspot.com/2008_06_01_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt; These machines are now retired. 
Little information is available on the types of computers used by the CSEC since then. However, Cray in the US has produced a number of improved supercomputers since then. These include the Cray SX-6, early 2000s, the [[Cray X1]], 2003 (development funded in part by the NSA), [[Cray XD1]], 2004, Cray XT3, [[Cray XT4]], 2006, Cray XMt, 2006 and Cray CX1, 2008. It is possible that some of these models have been used by the CSEC and are in use today.

In 2008, Canada’s most powerful research computer, an IBM supercomputer, was installed in Toronto. The $20 million machine, about the size of an SUV, can make 12.5 trillion computations per second and will be used for [[proteomics]] research by the Ontario Cancer Institute, the Princess Margaret Hospital (specializing in cancer) and the University Health Network. An IBM System x iData Plex supercomputer began operation at the University of Toronto in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Omar el Akkad, Monster Computer Roars to Life, The Globe and Mail, 18 June 2009, p. A1.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the supercomputer used by Environment Canada for weather forecasting remains the largest in Canada.

===Communications: digitization and fibre optics===
Canada's major telephone companies introduced [[digital technology]] and [[fibre optics]] during this period paving the way for more advanced business and customer telecommunications services.

In 1976 Nortel developed the first digital [[private branch exchange]] (PBX) in the world. That same year Nortel announced its "Digital World" project, which foresaw the development and market introduction of a complete family of digital switching, transmission and business communications systems.

In 1977 Bell Canada began to conduct a fibre optic field trial to residential customers in Montreal. The Manitoba Telephone System began to introduce fibre optics in that province beginning with customers in Elie, in 1981. In 1984 Sasktel, the provincially owned telephone company in Saskatchewan, completed the construction of a 3,268&amp;nbsp;km. long commercial fibre optics network to fifty-two communities in that province. In 1984 CNCP Telecommunications began the construction of a trans-Canada fibre optic network. By 2009, the national fibre optic system in Canada stretched 7000 kilometers across the country and included underwater fibre links to PEI (1985) and Newfoundland. Eight fibres are reserved for Trans-Canada traffic.

On 1 July 1985, Cantel and Bell Cellular began to offer cell phone service in Canada. They used a technical standard known as [[CDMA]], which was compatible with mobile phone systems in the US but not elsewhere in the world. The [[fax]] began to make its presence felt in offices across Canada in the early 1980s.

The ''Globe and Mail'' began to produce its contents in electronic form in 1979. A year later in 1980, in order to enable the daily distribution of the Toronto-based paper across the country, in a bid to become Canada's "national newspaper", it began the transmission of its contents via Anik Satellite to regional offices, where it was printed and distributed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globelink.ca/about/history/&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bluetooth]] technology, developed in 1994 by Ericsson, was introduced to Canadian consumers at that time. The technique permits the very short range radio communication of Bluetooth equipped electronic devices with each other for the purposes of information transfer. It is designed to eliminate the need for wires and cables to connect such machines.

===Lasers===

The use of [[lasers]] became common throughout Canada during these years. The devices are usually found as components of larger systems.

Lasers are used in the field of telecommunications, where they are act as the modulated light sources for fibre optic systems. The high frequency of the pulsed beams of light they produce enables the transmission of large quantities of information and the absence of an electromagnetic field around the fiber optic cable lessens transmission loss and increases the security of the data. Lasers are also used in many mechanical manufacturing systems to start and stop processes, measure component size and monitor and maintain quality.

In public they are commonly found at the retail checkout counter, where they scan bar codes. They are also used to open and close doors for people and cars and are common in public washrooms, where they control the flow of water for taps and the flushing of urinals and toilettes.

Their use in medicine has been growing. They are used to "burn" plaque from clogged arteries, to remove the decayed portion of teeth in dental treatment and to treat vision problems related to retinal detachment and near sightedness ([[lasik surgery]]).

The [[Lidar]], a laser-based instrument, is used by meteorologists to determine the height of the cloud base.

===Transportation===
Smaller vehicles became popular in response to the oil crisis of 1973. In 1981 the [[Chrysler K platform]] introduced by that company formed the basis for the compact K-car. [[Front wheel drive]] was widely introduced to North America by the Big Three US automakers beginning in 1978, when the Plymouth Horizon and Dodge Omni, both with transverse mounted engines, became available. A wide variety of front wheel-drive-models were quickly offered to Canadians by other car makers. 
The [[air bag]] safety feature was introduced during these years. In the US, the 1973 model Oldsmobile Toronado was the first passenger car equipped with an air bag. Ford introduced air bags as an option in the Tempo in the US in 1984 and Crysler made them a standard feature in 1988. Air bags were made available in the Canadian market as this feature became available in US models.

The [[semi-trailer truck]] (18 wheeler), became the dominant vehicle on the heavily used [[Highway 401 (Ontario)]]. [[Containerization]], which had made headway in ocean shipping with the construction of terminals in Halifax, Montreal and Vancouver also led to the eventual elimination of the railway box car and began to make inroads in the trucking industry. [[Light rail]] systems were built in Edmonton, Alberta in 1978, Calgary, Alberta, in 1981 and Vancouver, British Columbia in 1986.

The [[Ontario Highway 407]] Express Toll Road (ETR), opened in Toronto in 1997 to ease the burden of traffic on Highway 401 which passes through the heart of the city to the south. Special technology is used to collect tolls without the use to toll booths. Regular users can equip their cars with a transponder that sends a signal to highway sensors when the vehicle enters and leaves the road. For those vehicles without a transponder, special electro-optical sensors read the number plate and a bill for the toll is sent to the vehicle owner in the mail.

In 1996 GM Canada introduced the [[OnStar]] service to Canadian and US customers who chose this option when purchasing a new car. Considered a safety feature, the service provides emergency services, vehicle diagnostics and directions to drivers on the road. It is based on GPS technology as well as [[CDMA]] mobile phone technology provided in Canada by Bell Mobility. There is a 24-hour emergency response centre in Oshawa for vehicles located in Canada.

In the 1990s, a national weather radar surveillance system for aviation and general use was established. The initial system, the [[Canadian weather radar network]], established by Environment Canada, became operational in 1997 and consisted of 18 weather radars using the 5 centimetre wavelength (C-Band) and one using the ten-centimeter wavelength (S-Band). In 1998 that organization received approval to add another 12 radars and to upgrade the system to the [[Pulse-Doppler radar]] standard.

Also in 1997 the responsibility for air traffic control in Canada was transferred from Transport Canada to [[Nav Canada]]. The very large and complex control system operated by that organization uses a number of technologies, including 1400 ground-based navigation aids, 46 radars and six [[Automatic dependent surveillance-broadcast]] systems, which are based on global positioning technology.

Technological improvements have also enhanced rail safety during these years. These include a large number of incremental changes to elements of rolling stock including wheels, axles, trucks, couplers and brakes. There have also been improvements to tracks including continuous weld, concrete sleepers and switching techniques. Techniques of traffic control and communication have also been improved.&lt;ref&gt;Rail Safety Technologies, Transport Canada, Rail Safety Act Review Secretariat, July 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Industry===
Bombardier's invention of a new class of aircraft, the [[regional jet]] or RJ, allowed airlines to introduce jet passenger service to smaller centres. The design of this machine was facilitated through the use of [[computer-aided design]] software. In 2009, Bombardier Aerospace of Montreal, in cooperation with the [[National Research Council of Canada|National Research Council Canada]] began using robots for the assembly of its aircraft.

[[Factory farming]] of pigs and chickens in particular became a prominent feature of agriculture during these years. Large numbers of these animals are crowded into very large barns with controlled environments in an effort to maximize their growth and hence profit for the farmer. The use of antibiotics to fight infection, as well as the use of growth hormones is common. The growth in the number of these farms has been dramatic. The Fraser Valley in British Columbia is home to the highest concentration of such farms in Canada and the number of farms there increased from 56 in 1991 to 146 in 2001.  The growth of [[genetically modified crops]] also became common. One of the most notable in this regard is [[canola]]. Developed in Canada from rapeseed during the 1970s by Keith Downey and Baldur Stefansson it is used to produce oil that is low in erucic acid and glucosinolate and has become a major cash crop in North America. A strain of canola with additional modification that made it resistant to herbicide was introduced in Canada in 1996.

===Robotics===
The use of computer-controlled [[robots]] in manufacturing ([[computer-aided manufacturing]]) as well as the closely associated, [[Just-in-time (business)|just-in-time]] inventory management technique, were pioneered in Canada by the auto manufacturers, who introduced them to improve efficiency. They were put to use in new auto manufacturing plants built, by [[Honda of Canada Manufacturing|Honda Canada]] in Alliston, Ontario and [[Toyota Motor Manufacturing Canada|Toyota Canada]] in Cambridge, Ontario (1988). The techniques of robotic assembly-line manufacturing have improved over the years. As of 2009 robots form the basis for automobile production in Canada with a number of facilities and companies using this technology, including (city, company, model):
* Alliston, Ontario; Honda, Acura CSX, Acura MDX, Civic; 
* Oshawa, Ontario, General Motors, Camaro, Chevrolet Impala; 
* Ingersoll, Ontario, General Motors (CAMI - GM Suzike), Chevrolet Equinox, GMC Terrain; 
* Brampton, Ontario, Chrysler, Chrysler 300, Dodge Challenger, Dodge Charger;
* Windsor, Ontario, Chrysler/Volkswagen, Chrysler Town and Country, Dodge Grand Caravan, Volkswagen Routan;
* Oakville, Ontario, Ford, Edge, Grand Marquis, Lincoln MKX;
* Cambridge, Ontario, Toyota, Matrix, Corolla, Lexus RX;
* St. Thomas, Ontario, Ford, Crown Victoria, Lincoln Town Car and
* Woodstock, Ontario, Toyota, RAV4.

===Space technology: earth observation and geomatics===

[[Geomatics]], a term that originated in Canada, is a technique of computer-based mapping that integrates information from a variety of sources including, cartography, remote sensing (including images from RADARSAT), surveying, global satellite navigation systems, geodesy and photogrammetry. In the new century it has become an important tool used by Canadians in a variety of endeavours including, commerce, the environment, search and rescue, urban planning, defence and natural resource management among other things. The Geomatics Industry Association of Canada, founded in 1988, presently has a membership of more than 100 organizations.

During these years Canada's unmanned space programme included the first launching of a Canadian earth observation satellite, [[RADARSAT-1]] in 1995 and an improved version [[RADARSAT-2]] in 2007. Placed in polar orbits each of these satellites images almost the Earth's entire surface, every 24 days using a powerful synthetic aperture radar, SAR. The images have both operational and scientific applications and their data is of use in geology, hydrology, agriculture, cartography, forestry, climatology, urbanology, environmental studies, meteorology, oceanography and other fields. In 2009 the Canadian Space Agency announced a follow-up programme, [[RADARSAT Constellation]], which will see the launching of three earth observation satellites, in 2014, 2015 and 2016 respectively, working as a trio to provide complete coverage of Canada's land and ocean surfaces as well as 95% of the surface of the world every 24 hours.

===Energy, offshore oil and gas===
The technology for offshore oil and gas extraction was introduced to Canada during these years. The first of several projects off of Canada’s east coast was the massive [[Hibernia (oil field)|Hibernia]] platform, a [[gravity base structure]] (GBS), built in Bull Arm, Newfoundland in the early 1990s. The 1.2 million ton structure was towed into place, 315&amp;nbsp;km to the south east of St. John's, Newfoundland, over the Hibernia off-shore oil reservoir, where it was positioned resting on the ocean floor in 80 meters of water with its superstructure rising 50 meters above the surface of the sea.  In 1997 the facility began to pump oil from the sea bottom. The oil is stored in giant on-board tanks and continuously off-loaded by a fleet of dedicated shuttle tankers which transport it to the shore-based oil refinery at Come-by-Chance, Newfoundland.

The nearby [[Terra Nova (oil field)|Terra Nova]], 350&amp;nbsp;km off shore, began to produce oil in 2002. The platform itself rests on the ocean floor and pumps oil from the sea bottom. However, unlike the Hibernia facility, the oil flows directly into a [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading]] (FPSO) vessel, the [[Terra Nova FPSO]], where it is processed and stored. The oil in the storage tanks is then removed by a shuttle tanker. A third oil production facility in the same area, the [[White Rose (oil field)]], operated by Husky Petroleum, which began operation in 2005 also uses a Floating Production Storage and Offloading (FPSO) vessel, the [[SeaRose FPSO]].

Undersea pipelines, the first in Canada and part of the [[Sable Offshore Energy Project]] have been introduced to transport gas from undersea wells off the coast of Nova Scotia since 2000. Gas was discovered near Sable Island in 1979 with the first platform and well head installed in the Thebaud field in 1999. An on-shore gas treatment facility was built at Goldboro and connected to the wellhead with a 225&amp;nbsp;km long undersea pipeline and production began in 2000. Other fields have been connected via undersea pipeline including the North Triumph, Venture, Alma and South Venture.

Other notable energy works included, the ill-fated east coast [[Ocean Ranger]] drilling platform, which sank in a storm in 1982 with the loss of all aboard, the Nova Scotia Power Corporation tidal generating station, Annapolis, 1984 and the [[Darlington Nuclear Generating Station]], Darlington, Ontario, 1990. The construction of large-scale hydro-electric plants far from electric markets lead to the introduction of techniques for long distance [[electric power transmission]]. These techniques were used at a number of sites, including the W.A.C Bennett hydro station in British Columbia in 1968, [[Churchill Falls]], Labrador, 1971 and the [[Robert-Bourassa generating station]], 1981, the [[La Grande-3 generating station]], 1984, the [[La Grande-4 generating station]], 1986 and the [[La Grande-2-A generating station]], 1992, all in Quebec.

===Biotechnology===

[[Biotechnology]] involves modifying living organisms to serve human goals. Biological techniques are derived from a number of sciences including, biology, chemistry, organic chemistry, biochemistry, genetics, botany, zoology, microbiology and embryology to name a few.  In 1987, a number of Canadian companies and university research organizations operating in the field of biotechnology established the Industrial Biotechnology Association of Canada, also known as BIOTECanada. In 2005, the industry consisted of companies offering biotechnologically based services and products in the following sectors: human health (262 firms), agriculture (89 firms), food processing (54 firms), environment (33 firms), bioinformatics (16 firms), natural resources (21 firms) and aquaculture (15 firms).&lt;ref&gt;''Biotechnology in Canada: A Technology Platform for Growth'', Conference Board of Canada, Decemober 2005&lt;/ref&gt; As of 2010 BIOTECanada had more than 250 members.

In 2005 noted bio-medical spenders on biotechnological research (research spending in millions of C$) included, Apotex Inc. (151.1), Pfizer Canada Inc. (147.5), GlaxoSmithKline Inc. (111.8), Merck Frosst Canada Ltd. (96.6), Biovail Corporation (88.9), AstraZeneca Canada Inc. (79.8) and Sanofi Pasteur Limited (76.6).&lt;ref&gt;RESEARCH, Canada's Top 100 Corporate R&amp;D List, Infosource Inc. 2006 (2/2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

Another product of biotechnology, [[genetically modified crops]], are grown throughout Canada. One of the most widely known, [[canola]] was developed in Canada through selective breeding in 1974. Canola oil is used in food products and in non-food items such as lipstick, candles, bio-fuels and newspaper ink. One of the largest suppliers of genetically modified seeds for food crops and animal feed in Canada is Monsanto Canada, established in Winnipeg in 1901.

===Medicine===
Medical treatment advanced during these years. The use of lasers and computers became important parts of medical treatment. Computers were essential in the development of new medical imaging devices such as the [[CAT scan]], [[positron emission tomography]] and the [[MRI]]. Minimally invasive surgery, also known as [[laparoscopic surgery]], reduced surgical damage to patients. Lasers were used with catheters for clearing blocked arteries and catheters with small cameras provided images of conditions inside the body. [[Coronary bypass surgery]] became commonplace. [[Laser eye surgery]] became popular in the 1990s and was used to improve visual acuity for the near-sighted. New chemical chemotherapy combinations helped prolong the lives of cancer patients. Techniques for the long-term application of medication through the use of a skin patch or implants appeared during these years.

A large number of medical drugs ([[List of bestselling drugs]]) for treating a wide variety of ailments such as high blood pressure, high cholesterol levels, arthritis, allergies, anemia, depression, asthma, osteoporosis and diabetes, became available to Canadians during this period.

The techniques for blood collection, processing and transfusion came under severe criticism in Canada during the 1980s, and led to Canada's worst-ever public health crisis. Between 1980 and 1985, 2000 recipients of tainted blood provided by the [[Canadian Red Cross]] were infected with the [[HIV|HI virus]]. Between 1980 and 1990, 30,000 Canadian transfusion recipients were infected with [[hepatitis C]] from tainted blood. About 8000 of those who received bad blood have died or are expected to die as a result. An investigation known as the [[Royal Commission of Inquiry on the Blood System in Canada]] was launched in 1993 and issued its final report in 1997.

A private company, IVF Canada of Scarborough, was the first to begin offering [[in vitro fertilization]] (IVF) in Canada beginning in 1983. Since that date the company has recorded a number of Canadian "firsts" in this field, including the first IVF pregnancy, first IVF twins, the first IVF triplets and the first baby born from a frozen embryo.&lt;ref&gt;web site, IVF Canada, www.ivfcanada.com&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in 1998 male erectile difficulties could be treated with the use of [[Viagra]] and other medications.

===Domestic and consumer technology===
There were innovations in home design and construction during this period. Houses generally became bigger. New materials such as [[Vinyl siding|vinyl]] siding became common and often replaced more expensive brick for home exteriors. The car port and garage became widespread features and the latter was often located close to the curb, creating a rather crowded streetscape. The home [[dishwasher]] and the [[microwave oven]] were introduced. Large-screen televisions usually of the cathode ray or projection type were found in many homes. The [[Sony Walkman]], introduced in 1979, quickly gained popularity as a means for listening to music on the go. There were innovations in the field of domestic cuisine including the introduction of [[microwave popcorn]]. In 1981, the development of the susceptor bag (a paper bag impregnated with an aluminum-coated polyester film), allowed popcorn therein to be popped in a microwave oven without scorching.

The [[compact disc]] (CD) and the [[digital video disc]] (DVD) were introduced at this time. The CD, which appeared in 1982, became a favourite format for musical recordings. By 1986 most music stores in Canada had phased out the LP and replaced it with the CD. It was also used for other purposes including data storage in the form of the CD-ROM. A closely related format, the DVD, with greater storage capacity than the CD, was introduced in 1997. In 1986, Americ Disc of Drummondville, Quebec began to manufacture CDs and after 1997, DVDs and has become one of the largest suppliers of this product in North America. The infrared-based TV [[remote control]] became popular with Canadians in the early 1980s.

[[Video games]] have become a wildly popular form of entertainment especially for youth, since the 1980s. The earliest video game dated from 1947 and a number of devices were produced in the 1950s and 1960s. However, it was the development of the computer chip that led to their popularization. The coin-operated arcade game ''Pong'' introduced by [[Atari]] in 1972 was the first to become widely available. The next phase of development included the introduction in the mid-1970s of the home console, first with a hardwired game, but then complemented in 1977 by “plug and play”, which allowed the use of game cartridges for variety. Beginning in 1985 PC gaming became popular, exploiting the flexibility and increasing popularity of the personal computer. In 1989 [[Nintendo]] released its Game Boy, the first of the hand-held electronic games. Game imagery became more elaborate with the introduction of the 32-bit chip that was featured in the Sony [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] released in 1994. The 128-bit, sixth generation of video games was born with the introduction of the Sega [[Dreamcast]] in 1998. These technologies found a place in the Canadian consumer market from the moment of their introduction and Canadian companies have played a role in their development, with hardware makers like [[ATI Technologies]] developing high-powered video chips for game imagery and software companies developing a number of games.

[[Gore-Tex]], a breathable, waterproof textile, was patented in the US in 1980. Clothing made from this product and designed for outdoor all-weather, sporting, athletic and recreational activity  became available in Canada shortly thereafter.

The [[theme park]] became popular in the 1980s and the technology of thrill is the main attraction. In Toronto, [[Canada's Wonderland]], Canada’s largest, opened its doors to the public in 1981 and is now tied for second place in North America as the theme park with the most roller coasters ([[List of roller coasters at Canada's Wonderland]]). [[Galaxyland]] the world's largest indoor amusement park located in the [[West Edmonton Mall]] which opened in 1981 has garnered continent-wide attention. The most popular thrill ride, the [[Mindbender (Galaxyland)]] is the largest indoor triple-loop roller coaster in North America. The Drop of Doom was another featured attraction until closed in the early 2000s. The Mall's [[World Waterpark]], which opened in 1985 offers bathers a chance to cavort in the world’s largest indoor wave pool. The technology of auto racetrack design and construction has been put to good use in Montreal at the [[Circuit Gilles Villeneuve]], Canada’s premier auto race track and home of the [[Canadian Grand Prix]] Formula 1 motor car races since 1978. The [[slot machine]], so dear to gamblers, was introduced during this period. Casinos have been built in Windsor, [[Caesars Windsor]] 1994, Niagara Falls, [[Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort]] 1996 and Orillia, [[Casino Rama]] 1996, Ontario, Montreal, [[Montreal Casino]], Gatineau, [[Casino du Lac Leamy]] 1996 and Baie St. Paul, [[Casino de Charlevoix]] 1994,  Quebec, Halifax, [[Casino Nova Scotia]] 1995, Nova Scotia and in Vancouver, the [[River Rock Casino Resort]] 2006, British Columbia.

The world’s first [[automated teller machine]] (ATM) service was developed by the Sherwood Credit Union in Regina in 1977, at that institution’s North Albert Branch. Other Canadian financial institutions followed this lead and by the 1980s the ATM was available throughout Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Web Site, www.canadacool.com/COOLFACTS/SASKATCHEWAN/ReginaATM.html&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1980s the [[bar code]] became a familiar feature on consumer products ranging from food to clothes as did the bar code scanner at the retail checkout counter. These two technologies greatly improved the effectiveness of the check-out procedure and improved inventory management as well, through the associated computer accounting of stock. This was one of the factors leading to the technique of just-in-time inventory management for retail, commercial and industrial undertakings.

The payment of consumer purchases at the retail checkout counter through the use of an electronic debit card was introduced across Canada in 1994. Known as [[Interac]], the system allows the consumer to swipe his personal card and with the use of a [[personal identification number]] have the amount of the purchase electronically deducted from his or her bank account. The service has since become very popular.{{Citation needed|date=August 2010}}

===Waste disposal, recycling===
Although the concept of recycling waste materials was not new, the [[Blue Box Recycling System]] for domestic refuse collection made the idea highly visible. Initially developed by Laidlaw Waste Systems for the Kitchener, Ontario, in 1983, it was introduced to Ontario municipalities in 1986, by Ontario Multi-Material Recycling Incorporated (OMMRI), and promoted by Nyle Ludolph, who became known as the Father of the Blue Box. The concept involved the use of blue plastic boxes which were distributed to home owners, who in turn filled them with recyclable refuse and placed them at curbside for weekly pickup. The refuse was taken to specially designed plants, where materials were sorted and recycled. The technique became popular in municipalities across Canada in the years that followed.&lt;ref&gt;web site, Pollution Probe, www.pollutionprobe.org/Reports/we%20recycle.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

During these years the municipal garbage dump evolved to become the sanitary landfill site. A number of technologies, including clay and plastic liners were used to contain the smell and [[leachate]]. The largest in Canada, the [[Keele Valley Landfill]] was operated by the City of Toronto from 1983 until 2002, when it was closed because it was full.

[[Chlorofluorocarbons]] (CFCs), the gas propellants used in aerosol spray cans, became a target for environmental concern in the 1970s and 1980s when research demonstrated that they had a harmful effect on the ozone layer in the atmosphere. The international [[Montreal Protocol]] of 1989 banned the use of these substances and they were subsequently replaced with volatile hydrocarbons.

The problem with choice to reuse is still not available. There are many products that don't need to be recycled for a hundred years, but are put out monthly.

===Architecture and civil engineering===
Large architectural works of note included BC Place, Vancouver, 1983, [[Petro-Canada Centre]], West Tower, Calgary, 1984, the [[West Edmonton Mall]], Edmonton, Alberta, 1986,  Scotia Plaza, Toronto 1988, the Canterra Tower, Calgary, 1988, the [[Sky Dome]], Toronto, 1989, Bankers Hall, Calgary, 1989, BCE Place–Canada Trust Tower, Toronto, 1990, the Bay Wellington Tower, Toronto, 1990, Tour du 1000 de la Gauchetière, Montreal, 1991, Tour IBM-Marathon, Montreal, 1992 and [[GM Place]], Vancouver, 1995.

New arenas for Canada's National Hockey League teams were built, including [[GM Place]], Vancouver, home of the [[Vancouver Canucks]] in 1995, the [[Corel Centre]] in Ottawa, home of the [[Ottawa Senators]] and [[Molson Centre]] in Montreal, new home of the Montreal Canadiens, both in 1996.

Significant new bridges included the [[Alex Fraser Bridge]], Vancouver, 1986, the [[Skybridge (TransLink)]], Vancouver, 1989 and the [[Confederation Bridge]], NB-PEI, 1997.

==End note==

In the earlier parts of Canada's history, the state often played a crucial role in the diffusion of these technologies, in some cases through a monopoly enterprise, in others with a private "partner". In more recent times the need for the role of the state has diminished in the presence of a larger private sector.

In the latter part of the 20th century there is evidence that Canadian values prefer public expenditures on social programmes at the expense of public spending on the maintenance and expansion of public technical infrastructure. This can be seen in the fact that in 2008 the Federation of Canadian Municipalities estimated that it would take $123 billion to restore and repair aging urban infrastructure across Canada.

'''''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation''''' (1992; second edition 2006) is a book by literary critic [[Harold Bloom]], in which the author covers the topic of [[religion in the United States]] from a perspective which he calls ''religious criticism''.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, Harold, ''The American Religion'', second edition (Chu Hartley Publishers, 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Religious denominations Bloom discusses include [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]], [[Christian Science]], the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]], [[Jehovah's Witnesses]], and the [[Southern Baptist Convention]].

==Summary==

Bloom lays out his conception of a practice of ''religious criticism'', by which he does not mean [[criticism of religion]].  He distinguishes the practice from other aspects of [[religious studies]] (e.g., [[history of religion]] or [[philosophy of religion]]) by analogy with his practice of [[literary criticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom says, literary criticism involves aspects of history ''et cetera'',  but is distinguished by having a focus on [[Aesthetics#aesthetic judgment|aesthetic judgments]] concerning literature.  Bloom's religious criticism thus will involve history ''et cetera'', but also pay attention particularly to the [[spirituality|spiritual]] values of religions.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

In this book, Bloom begins this practice by looking at religious groups in the [[United States of America]]. Bloom identifies [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] and [[William James]] as previous scholars who practiced religious criticism of American religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), pp. 11–12.&lt;/ref&gt;  He concludes that in America there is a single, dominant religion of which many nominally distinct denominations are a part.  Among these he identifies [[Mormonism]], the [[Southern Baptist Convention]], [[Pentecostalism]], and [[Seventh-day Adventist Church|Seventh-day Adventism]].  To a lesser extent however, he also includes nearly all "Christian" denominations in America, including [[mainline Protestantism]] and [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom's view is that all of these groups in America are united by requiring that each person may only truly meet with the divine when experiencing a "total inward solitude" and that salvation cannot be achieved by engaging with a community, but only through a one-to-one confrontation with the divine.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; While Bloom suggests that this American form of religion is to some extent a continuation of [[Enthusiasm]] in Europe, American religious groups are rightly distinguished from traditional [[Christianity]]: Although all of these groups identify as Christian, Bloom believes they represent a radical departure from the core aspects of that religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 33.&lt;/ref&gt;  Bloom says that the American religion is rather more like a form of [[Gnosticism]].&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Bloom says that the events of the [[Second Great Awakening]] at [[Cane Ridge]] were formative for the American religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bloom regards the American Religion as successful by his standards for religious imagination; however, he distinguishes this success from the social and political consequences of the religion.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;  At times he criticizes elements in the American religion for their political activities, saying even that he is "politically appalled by what may be some of its consequences. Since the Reagan-Bush national Republicans have become one with the American Religion, my fear is that we will never again see a Democrat in the Presidency during my lifetime."&lt;ref&gt;Bloom (2006), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==

In ''[[Reviews in American History]]'', [[Henry F. May]] writes that the work is "brilliant  and  original" and that "Historians interested in American religion ... will do well to read it and think about what it says." He also however criticizes Bloom for being "unabashedly subjective and sometimes wrong-headed" and using "sweeping  generalizations".&lt;ref&gt;May, Henry F., "Democratic Gnosticism: The American Religion?", ''Reviews in American History'', Vol. 21, No. 2 (Jun., 1993), p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[Commentary (magazine)|Commentary]]'', [[Richard John Neuhaus]] dismissed the book as "a 288-page imaginative flirtation with nonsense".&lt;ref&gt;Neuhaus, Richard John, "Reviews: On Faith: ''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation'' By Harold Bloom", ''Commentary'' (September 1992), p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Neuhaus says that Bloom's interpretations of various denominations unduly ignore the explicit statements from these religious groups.&lt;ref&gt;Neuhaus (1992), p. 57 &amp; 58.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in ''[[America (Jesuit magazine)|America]]'', James P. Hanigan says that Bloom offers "suggestive and important insights", particularly the claim that traditional Christianity is not well-suited to Americans, and that the belief in direct experience of God is connected to [[anti-intellectualism]].  Hanigan suggests though that Bloom's argument is motivated by his own "Gnostic" spirituality, and concludes that it is, in the end, unpersuasive.&lt;ref&gt;Hanigan, James P., "Book Review: ''The American Religion'' by Harold Bloom", ''America'' (October 3, 1992), p. 219.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Editions==

The first edition was published by [[Simon &amp; Schuster]] in 1992 with the full title, ''The American Religion: The Emergence of the Post-Christian Nation''.  The second edition was published by Chu Hartley Publishers in 2006 without the subtitle and included a new [[afterword]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8382">'''Tyndale New Testament Commentaries''' (or '''TNTC''') is a series of commentaries in English on the [[New Testament]]. It is published by the [[Inter-Varsity Press]].

Constantly being revised since its first being completed, the series seek to bridge the gap between brevity and scholarly comment.

==Reviews==
{{quote|The ''Tyndale New Testament Commentaries'' are designed for the frequently-targeted well-read layperson, but many pastors profit as well. The series is conservative but focuses most attention on explaining the meaning of the text with minimal interaction with the voluminous secondary literature. Originally based on the AV/KJV, with Greek and Hebrew transliterated and explained, the series is being rewritten based on the RSV or NIV (at the individual author's discretion), and space is being assigned more equitably. Several of the volumes of this new edition are, within the constraints of the series, outstanding (e.g., Marshall on Acts). |[[D. A.

[[File:The New Testament in the original Greek - 1881.djvu|thumb|page=9]]
'''''The New Testament in the Original Greek''''' is a Greek-language version of the [[New Testament]] published in 1881. It is also known as the '''Westcott and Hort''' text, after its editors [[Brooke Foss Westcott]] (1825–1901) and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]] (1828–1892). (Textual scholars use the abbreviation "'''WH'''".&lt;ref&gt;

It is a [[Textual criticism|critical text]], compiled from some of the oldest New Testament fragments and texts that had been discovered at the time. The two editors worked together for 28 years.

Westcott and Hort state: "[It is] our belief that even among the numerous unquestionably spurious readings of the New Testament there are no signs of deliberate falsification of the text for dogmatic purposes."&lt;ref&gt;Brooke Foss Westcott, Fenton John Anthony Hort, '[https://books.google.com/books?id=0xtVAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=ACfU3U33CMW3331Vv20NgGvjyOs52I1mlA&amp;vq=%22will+not+be+out+of+place+to+add+here+a+distinct+expression+of+our+belief+that+even+among+the+numerous%22&amp;source=gbs_quotes_r&amp;cad=2_0#PPA283,M1 'The New Testament in the Original Greek: Introduction, Appendix''], p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; 
They find that without orthographic differences, doubtful textual variants exist only in one sixtieth of the whole New Testament (with most of them being comparatively trivial variations), with the substantial variations forming hardly more than one thousandth of the entire text.

According to Hort, "Knowledge of Documents should precede Final Judgments upon Readings". The two editors favoured two manuscripts: [[Codex Vaticanus Graecus 1209|Vaticanus]] and [[Codex Sinaiticus|Sinaiticus]]. They also believed that the combination of [[Codex Bezae]] with the [[Vetus Latina|Old Latin]] and the [[Peshitta|Old Syriac]] represents the original form of the New Testament text, especially when it is shorter than other forms of the text, such as the majority of the [[Byzantine text-type]].&lt;ref name = Aland&gt;{{Cite book | last = Aland | first = Kurt | authorlink = Kurt Aland |author2=[[Barbara Aland]] |translator=Erroll F.

Eerdmans Publishing Company|Wm. B. Eerdmans]] | year = 1995 | location = Grand Rapids | page = 236}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In this they followed one of the primary principles of their fledgling textual criticism, ''[[lectio brevior]]'', sometimes taken to an extreme, as in the theory of [[Western non-interpolations]], which has since been rejected.&lt;ref&gt;Aland, Kurt and Barbara.

== WH edition ==
[[File:Wyh.jpg|thumb|[[Brooke Foss Westcott]] and [[Fenton John Anthony Hort]]]]

Westcott and Hort distinguished four text types in their studies. The most recent is the Syrian, or [[Byzantine text-type]] (eastern), of which the newest example is the [[Textus Receptus]] and thus from the critical text view is less likely reliable. The [[Western text-type]] is much older, but tends to paraphrase, so according to the critical text view also lacks dependability. The [[Alexandrian text-type]], exemplified in the [[Codex Ephraemi]], exhibits a polished Greek style. The two scholars identified their favorite text type as "Neutral text", exemplified by two 4th-century manuscripts, the [[Codex Vaticanus]] (known to scholars since the 15th century), and the [[Codex Sinaiticus]] (discovered in 1859), both of which they relied on heavily (albeit not exclusively) for this edition. This text has only a few changes of the original.&lt;ref name = Schumacher&gt;H. Schumacher, A Handbook of Scripture Study (B. Herder Book Co.: St. Louis-London 1923), p. 53.&lt;/ref&gt; This edition is based on the critical works especially of Tischendorf and Tregelles.&lt;ref name = Schumacher/&gt; The minuscules play a minimal role in this edition.&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Holmes, ''From Nestle to the `Editio Critica Maior`'', in: ''The Bible as Book: The Transmission of the Greek Text'', London 2003, p. 128. {{ISBN|0-7123-4727-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Westcott and Hort worked on their Testament from 1853 until its completion in 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Metzger |first1=Bruce M. |authorlink1=Bruce M.

In 1892, a revised edition was released by [[Francis Crawford Burkitt|F. C. Burkitt]].{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

== Reception ==

The edition of Westcott and Hort began a new epoch in the history of textual criticism.&lt;ref name = Schumacher/&gt; Most critical editions published after Westcott and Hort share their preference of the Alexandrian text-type and therefore are similar to ''The New Testament in the Original Greek''. An exception is the text edited by [[Hermann von Soden]]. Soden's edition stands much closer to the text of [[Constantin von Tischendorf|Tischendorf]] than to the text of Westcott and Hort. All editions of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]] remain close in textual character to the text WH. [[Kurt Aland|Aland]] reports that, while NA25 text shows, for example, 2,047 differences from von Soden, 1,996 from Vogels, 1,268 from Tischendorf, 1,161 from Bover, and 770 from Merk, it contains only 558 differences from WH text.&lt;ref&gt;K. Aland &amp; B. Aland, ''Text of the New Testament'', pp. 26-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Bruce M. Metzger]], "the general validity of their critical principles and procedures is widely acknowledged by scholars today."&lt;ref&gt;Bruce M. Metzger, ''The Text of the New Testament: Its Transmission, Corruption, and Restoration'', p. 136.&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1981 Metzger said:
&lt;blockquote&gt;“The international committee that produced the ''United Bible Societies'' Greek New Testament, not only adopted the Westcott and Hort edition as its basic text, but followed their methodology in giving attention to both external and internal consideration”.&lt;ref&gt;B. M. Metzger, cited by James Brooks, ''Bible Interpreters of the 20th century'', p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Philip Comfort]] gave this opinion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The text produced by Westcott and Hort is still to this day, even with so many more manuscript discoveries, a very close reproduction of the primitive text of the New Testament. Of course, I think they gave too much weight to Codex Vaticanus alone, and this needs to be tempered. This criticism aside, the Westcott and Hort text is extremely reliable. (...) In many instances where I would disagree with the wording in the Nestle / UBS text in favor of a particular variant reading, I would later check with the Westcott and Hort text and realize that they had often come to the same decision. (...) Of course, the manuscript discoveries of the past one hundred years have changed things, but it is remarkable how often they have affirmed the decisions of Westcott and Hort.&lt;ref&gt;Philip Comfort, ''Encountering the Manuscripts: An Introduction to New Testament Paleography &amp; Textual Criticism'', (Nashville, 2005), p. 100.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Other editions of Greek New Testament ==

The texts of [[Novum Testamentum Graece|Nestle-Aland]], and of Bover and Merk, differ very little from the text of the Westcott-Hort.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skypoint.com/members/waltzmn/TextTypes.html#Use Robert Waltz]&lt;/ref&gt;
