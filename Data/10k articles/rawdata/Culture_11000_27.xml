Green|title=African American Folktales|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bS4jt9p1Jl4C|year=2009|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-36295-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
African-American folktales are a storytelling tradition which started in Africa. They are a rich oral tradition which has grown and expanded as Africans were brought to the Americas as slaves. 

In general, most African-American Folktales fall into one of seven categories:  tales of origin, tales of trickery and trouble, tales of triumph over natural or supernatural evils, comical heart warming tales, tales teaching life lessons, tales of ghosts and spirits, and tales of slaves and their slave-owners.&lt;ref name="Green2009" /&gt; Many revolve around animals which have human characteristics with the same morals and short comings that humans do making the moral of the stories relatable.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many new tales were born out of the experiences of Africans in the Americas, but many of the tales have endured. Although many of the original stories have changed, being added to and evolving, since African Americans were brought to the Americas as slaves, their meaning and moral life lessons have remained the same.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Categories ==

=== Origins ===
African-American tales of origin include the stories that center around beginnings and transformations whether it is focused on a character, event, or generally explaining how the world came to be.&lt;ref name="Green2009" /&gt; Some examples of tales of origin includes "How Jackal Became an Outcast" and "Terrapin's Magic Dipper and Whip".&lt;ref name="Green2009" /&gt;

"How Jackal Became an Outcast" was adapted from "The Jackal and the Lion", written by Joseph Cotter.&lt;ref name="Green2009" /&gt; It is told that this story was brought directly from Africa.&lt;ref name="Green2009" /&gt; In this tale, the Jackal takes the role of a trickster who tries to use their clever wit to outplay the Lion, which ends up backfiring because his lack of morality leads to disaster for both the Jackal and his future descendants.&lt;ref name="Green2009" /&gt;

"Terrapin's Magic Dipper and Whip" was adapted from "Negro Folk Tales from the South (Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana) by Arthur Huff Fauset.&lt;ref name="Green2009" /&gt; The storyteller of this tale (collected in the 1920s) is said to have been brought to Alabama as a slave after being born in West Africa.&lt;ref name="Green2009" /&gt; This folktale focuses on explaining the origin of a Tortoise named Terrapin's shell and its "furtive behavior" - it involves a plot "in which a magical object provides an apparently unlimited food supply and another object dispenses beatings [which] is likely to be of European in origin...[this tale] suggests the creative merging of two folk traditions: African and European".&lt;ref name="Green2009" /&gt;

Overall, a tale of origin is a very common theme found within African-American folktales and helps explain how events and characters came to be.  

=== Trickery and trouble ===
[[File:Brer_Rabbit_and_the_Tar_Baby.jpg|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Brer_Rabbit_and_the_Tar_Baby.jpg|thumb|Brer Rabbit and the Tar Baby]]
Tricksters in folk stories are commonly characters (people, animals, etc.) who 'succeed' off of deceiving others and taking advantage of their weaknesses.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;They usually don't think if their actions are right or wrong - they have been described as amoral.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nationalhumanitiescenter.org/tserve/freedom/1865-1917/essays/trickster.htm|title=The Trickster in African American Literature, Freedom's Story, TeacherServe®, National Humanities Center|website=nationalhumanitiescenter.org|access-date=2018-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; In stories, they tend to use their wits to get out of trouble and/or get what they want. Specifically in African-American folktales, two examples of common tricksters are [[Br'er Rabbit|Brer Rabbit]] and [[Anansi]].&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Tricksters in African American folktales tend to have a comedic approach. However, these stories also have an underlying important theme as well: inequality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;The National Humanities Center says that, "they contain serious commentary on the inequities of existence in a country where the promises of democracy were denied to a large portion of the citizenry, a pattern that becomes even clearer in the literary adaptations of trickster figures".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; The trickster folktales reflect what was happening during that period of time.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

These kinds of folktales didn't always have a literal 'trickster', but they had the overarching theme of using trickery tactics. For example, Charles Chesnutt's collected a series a stories and named it ''The Conjure Woman'' (1899).&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; One of the stories found in this book includes a story of "how an enslaved man is spared being sent from one plantation to another by having his wife, who is a conjure woman, turn him into a tree...the trickery works until a local sawmill selects that particular tree to cut".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

It was during these slavery times, "and for decades thereafter, trickster tales, with their subtly and indirection, were necessary because blacks could not risk a direct attack on white society".&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

=== Comical heartwarming tales ===
African-American Tales of comical and heartwarming are told to “stimulate the imagination with wonders, and are told to remind us of the perils and the possibilities”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The annotated African American folktales|isbn=9780871407535|edition=Firstition}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The heartwarming tales are told to lighten and stay connected. The stories commonly told are about heroes, heroines, villains and fools. One story, The Red Feather, is a response to the amalgamation of intertwining cultures ending with heroes bringing forth gifts&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=African American folktales|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0313362958}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Other lighthearted stories include many examples with heroes. Rabbit Rides Wolf is a story told representing the amalgamation of African and Creek descent where another hero is emerged during a bitter time&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=African American folktales|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0313362958}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Teaching life lessons ===
African folklore and tales are means of handing down traditions and duties through generations. Tales are often passed through word of mouth through family or gatherings of people. It was not uncommon for the people in Africa to gather children in groups, sit them down, and share the jarring tales that were once told to them. This kind of gathering was known as Tales by Midnight.&lt;ref name=":32"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://anikefoundation.org/?page_id=3893&amp;preview_id=3893|title=The Midnight  Goat Thief « ANIKE FOUNDATION|website=anikefoundation.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tales by Midnight was supposed to share stories that could potentially prepare children for their futures. These gatherings were lessons to the youth of African. The tales were representations of their culture. Diverse kinds of animals would often have human-like characteristics to make the story compelling to the young children. This could be physical acts like singing and dancing, or it would be portrayals of emotion like greediness, honesty, loyalty, ect.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

There were several tales that were commonly told in this Tales by Midnight setting. One for example was the tale of The Midnight Goat Thief. This tale originated from Zimbabwe, and has passed through many generations of African children.

The Midnight Goat Thief is a tale of misplaced trust and betrayal between two friends, a baboon and a hare. The relationship is under water when a conflict between the two arises. The story is supposed to teach youth to be loyal and honest.&lt;ref name=":32" /&gt;

=== Ghosts and spirits ===
African-American tales of ghosts and spirits were commonly told of spook or “haint” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Affrilachian tales : folktales from the African-American Appalachian tradition|last1=Ford|first1=Lynette|publisher=Marion : Parkhurst Brothers, Inc.|isbn=1-935166-67-0|edition=Firstition}}&lt;/ref&gt;, in modern day known as “haunt,” a term referring to a repeated visits by ghosts or&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_reportedly_haunted_locations|title=List of reportedly haunted locations|date=26 October 2018|website=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in tradition, tales of ghosts and spirits that keep one awake at night&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Affrilachian tales : folktales from the African-American Appalachian tradition|last1=Ford|first1=Lynette|isbn=1-935166-66-2|edition=Firstition}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Possessed of Two Spirits is a personal experience believing in the magic powers in conjuration with both the living and the spiritual world&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Affrilachian tales : folktales from the African-American Appalachian tradition|isbn=1-935166-66-2|edition=Firstition}}&lt;/ref&gt; found commonly in African-American spirit folklore. Another story, Married to a Boar Hog emerged during the colonial Revolution against the British&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=African American folktales|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0313362958}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The story is an example of a young woman who marries to a figure typically told as a supernatural being such as a boar and in the end her savior typically ends as her brother but with some form of disease [leprosy, club foot, or yaws]. In the midst of the revolution, "Married to a Boar Hog" is from slaves being carried to the British Caribbean but with reference to the African Origin about the hardships they endured&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=African American folktales|publisher=Greenwood Press|isbn=978-0313362958}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Slavery ===
[[File:Conjure_Woman_book_cover.JPG|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Conjure_Woman_book_cover.JPG|thumb|''Conjure Woman'' (1899)]]
African-American tales of slavery often uses rhetoric that can seem uncommon to the modern era. The language that is passed down through generations has deviated the standard for racial narrative. The Conjure Woman, a book of tales dealing with racial identity, was written by the first African-American author, Charles W. Chesnutt, in the perspective of a freed slave.&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Myers|first=Jeffrey|date=2003|title=Other Nature: Resistance to Ecological Hegemony in Charles W. Chesnutt's "The Conjure Woman"|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1512356|journal=African American Review|volume=37|issue=1|pages=5|doi=10.2307/1512356|issn=1062-4783}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The folklore-styled tales within this book are a representation of the struggles that the slaves had to face during the post-war time period in the South. The author wrote them in order for readers to a gain perspective on the challenges of being left behind. Chestbutt’s stories were a pensive view of the times of slavery. &lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;The Conjure Woman tales were told by the freed slave from their owners who left the South after the war.  

Chesnutt's language surrounding African American folklore derived from the standards of the racial narrative of his era. By using vernacular language, Chesnutt was able to deviate from the racial norms and formulate a new, more valorized, message of folk heroes. “ Chesnutt writes "on the other side" of standard racial narratives, effectively refuting them by evoking a different kind of "racial project" in his fictional work.”&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt;

== Plot ==
Reagan Willis (Siena Agudon) is excited about her tryout for the girls soccer club the Crush. However, her parents are preoccupied by recruiting visits for their son Logan, a star on his high school football team. On her way to the tryout, her bike chain breaks, causing her to be late. She tells the coach she plays striker, the position of nemesis and coaches favorite Claire, who is paid by her father for every goal she scores. 

After being cut from the team, Reagan calls a number of clubs, but all spots have been filled. While tearing down a poster of her favorite player Alex Morgan, she fall off a chair and hits her head. When she comes to, she sees Alex Morgan in her room but thinks it’s just a hallucination caused by the fall. She accepts she is the only one that sees Alex and they begin to train together.

Her crush Ben tells her there may be a spot on a team called the Breakaways. At the tryout she discovers the team illegally practices on a field owned by the city. Reagan makes the team and becomes their best player.

The city finds out about the practices and they are forced to move to a vacant lot across the street from Reagan’s house. Their coach is replaced by Reagan’s father after the girls find out he is not British and has no experience coaching soccer.

The Breakaways begin to win games, trying to finish in the top 4 in their league in order to play in the Diamond Cup, a tournament of the best clubs in the state. Claire finds out the Breakaways qualified for the Diamond Cup and confronts Reagan, threatening to have her father buy the vacant lot where they practice. While Claire tries to tear down the Breakaways banner, Reagan hits her head. When she wakes up, she no longer sees Alex Morgan.

__NOTOC__
[[File:MaraAssault.jpg|thumb|270px|An aniconic representation of [[Mara (demon)|Mara]]'s assault on the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]], with an [[empty throne]], 2nd century, [[Amaravathi village, Guntur district|Amaravati]], [[India]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, pp. 1 and 5, fig 4a caption&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Since the beginning of the serious study of the history of [[Buddhist art]] in the 1890s, the earliest phase, lasting until the 1st century CE, has been described as [[aniconic]]; the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] was only represented through symbols such as an [[Hetoimasia|empty throne]],  [[Bodhi]] tree, a riderless horse with a parasol floating above an empty space (at [[Sanchi]]), [[Buddha footprint|Buddha's footprints]], and the [[dharma wheel]].&lt;ref&gt;Huntington, opening pages&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is still some debate, the first [[anthropomorphic]] representations of the Buddha himself are often considered a result of the [[Greco-Buddhist art|Greco-Buddhist]] interaction, in particular in [[Gandhara]], a theory first fully expounded by [[Alfred A. Foucher]], but  criticised from the start by [[Ananda Coomaraswamy]].  Foucher also accounted for the origins of the aniconic symbols themselves in small souvenirs carried away from the main pilgrimage sites and so becoming recognised and popularized as symbolic of the events associated with the site.  Other explanations were that it was inappropriate to represent one who had attained [[nirvana]].&lt;ref&gt;Krishan, 9&lt;/ref&gt;

However, in 1990, the notion of aniconism in Buddhism was challenged by [[Susan Huntington]], initiating a vigorous debate among specialists that still continues.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://books.google.com/books?id=8ZCl3DRN3vsC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=2#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false note 7 here] for an update on the controversy as of 2007, and [https://books.google.com/books?id=FHxsDV1GDOIC&amp;pg=PA20&amp;dq=Riderless+horse+Buddha&amp;lr=&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Riderless%20horse%20Buddha&amp;f=false here] for another from 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;  She sees many early scenes claimed to be aniconic as in fact not depicting scenes from the life of the Buddha, but worship of [[cetiya]] (relics) or re-enactments by devotees at the places where these scenes occurred.  Thus the image of the [[empty throne]] shows an actual relic-throne at [[Bodh Gaya]] or elsewhere.  She points out that there is only one indirect reference for a specific aniconic doctrine in Buddhism to be found, and that pertaining to only one sect.&lt;ref&gt;(Huntington 1990) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt;

As for the archeological evidence, it shows some anthropomorphic sculptures of the Buddha actually existing during the supposedly aniconic period, which ended during the 1st century CE.  Huntington also rejects the association of "aniconic" and "iconic" art with an emerging division between [[Theravada]] and [[Mahayana]] Buddhism.  Huntington's views have been challenged by Vidya Dehejia and others.&lt;ref&gt;(Huntington 1990) [http://ccbs.ntu.edu.tw/FULLTEXT/JR-ADM/huntin.htm] and [https://books.google.com/books?id=sgkKbE-9EhAC&amp;pg=PA73&amp;dq=Early+Buddhist+Art+and+the+Theory+of+Aniconism&amp;as_brr=3&amp;cd=3#v=onepage&amp;q=Early%20Buddhist%20Art%20and%20the%20Theory%20of%20Aniconism&amp;f=false here]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although some earlier examples have been found in recent years, it is common ground that the large free-standing iconic images of the Buddha so prominent in later Buddhist art are not found in the earliest period; discussion is focused on smaller figures in [[relief]] panels, conventionally considered to represent scenes from the life of the Buddha, and now re-interpreted by Huntington and her supporters.

== Later periods ==
In later periods both the major schools of Buddhism have made great use of representational art, though [[Theravada]] temples and other sites typically concentrate on a single large sculpture of the Buddha, whereas [[Mahayana]] temples have larger numbers of images of a greater variety of figures with varying degrees of spiritual significance.  However some schools, such as [[Zen Buddhism]] in [[Japan]], have also shown a general tendency towards aniconism, though without specific prohibition of figurative images.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13837">An '''anthropologist''' is a person engaged in the practice of [[anthropology]]. Anthropology is the study of various aspects of [[human]]s within past and present [[Society|societies]].&lt;ref name="oed3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/anthropology?q=anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Oxford Dictionaries|publisher=Oxford University Press|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="eb3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/27505/anthropology|title=anthropology|work=Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate=23 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aaa3"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aaanet.org/about/whatisanthropology.cfm|title=What is Anthropology?|publisher=[[American Anthropological Association]]|accessdate=10 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social anthropology]], [[cultural anthropology]], and [[philosophical anthropology]] study the norms and values of societies. [[Linguistic anthropology]] studies how language affects social life, while [[economic anthropology]] studies human economic behavior. [[Biological anthropology|Biological (physical)]], [[Forensic anthropology|forensic]], and [[medical anthropology]] study the biological development of humans, the application of biological anthropology in a legal setting, and the study of diseases and their impacts on humans over time, respectively.

==Education==
Anthropologists usually cover a breadth of topics within anthropology in their [[undergraduate education]], and then proceed to specialize in topics of their own choice at the [[Postgraduate education|graduate level]]. In some universities, a qualifying exam serves to test both the breadth and depth of a student's understanding of anthropology; the students who pass are permitted to work on a doctoral dissertation.

Anthropologists typically hold graduate degrees, either doctorates or master's degrees. Not holding an advanced degree is rare in the field. Some anthropologists hold undergraduate degrees in other fields than [[anthropology]] and graduate degrees in anthropology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.americananthro.org/AdvanceYourCareer/Content.aspx?ItemNumber=1782|title=Career Paths and Education - Advance Your Career|website=www.americananthro.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, anthropologists primarily worked in academic settings; however, by 2014, U.S. anthropologists and [[Archaeology|archaeologists]] were largely employed in research positions (28%), management and consulting (23%), and government positions (27%).&lt;ref&gt;Baba, Marietta L.

Anthropologists without doctorates tend to work more in other fields than [[Academy|academia]], while those while the majority of those with doctorates are primarily employed in academia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.insidehighered.com/news/2011/02/16/anthropology_master_s_are_most_likely_to_bring_their_discipline_to_the_public|title=Anthropology Without Doctorates|access-date=2017-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of those without doctorates in academia tend to work exclusively as researchers and do not teach. Those in research-only positions are often not considered faculty. The median salary for anthropologists in 2015 was $62,220.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://money.usnews.com/careers/best-jobs/anthropologist|title=Anthropologist Ranks Among Best Jobs of 2017|website=money.usnews.com|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many anthropologists report an above average level of job satisfaction.

Although closely related and often grouped with archaeology, anthropologists and [[archeologist]]s perform differing roles, though [[archeology]] is considered a sub-discipline of [[anthropology]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; While both professions focus on the study of human culture from past to present, archaeologists focus specifically on analyzing material remains such as artifacts and architectural remains.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.paesta.psu.edu/book/earth-systems-science-introduction/definitions/paleontology-vs-archaeology-vs-anthropology|title=Paleontology vs. Archaeology vs. Anthropology {{!}} PAESTA|website=www.paesta.psu.edu|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropology encompasses a wider range of professions including the rising fields of [[forensic anthropology]], [[digital anthropology]], and [[cyber anthropology]]. The role of an anthropologist differs as well from that of a [[historian]]. While anthropologists focus their studies on humans and human behavior, historians look at events from a broader perspective.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.careerigniter.com/questions/what-is-the-difference-between-a-historian-and-an-anthropologist/|title=What Is The Difference Between A Historian And An Anthropologist? - Career Igniter|website=www.careerigniter.com|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians also tend to focus less on culture than anthropologists in their studies. A far greater percentage of historians are employed in academic settings than anthropologists, who have more diverse places of employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.historians.org/jobs-and-professional-development/career-diversity-for-historians/career-diversity-resources/where-historians-work-an-interactive-database-of-history-phd-career-outcomes|title=Where Historians Work: An Interactive Database of History PhD Career Outcomes {{!}} AHA|website=www.historians.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Anthropologists are experiencing a shift in the twenty-first century [[United States]] with the rise of forensic anthropology. In the United States, as opposed to many other countries forensic anthropology falls under the domain of the anthropologist and not the [[Forensic pathologist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Traithepchanapai|first=Pongpon|last2=Mahakkanukrauh|first2=Pasuk|last3=Kranioti|first3=Elena F.|date=2016-04-01|title=History, research and practice of forensic anthropology in Thailand|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0379073816300470|journal=Forensic Science International|volume=261|issue=Supplement C|pages=167.e1–167.e6|doi=10.1016/j.forsciint.2016.02.025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this role, forensic anthropologists help in the identification of skeletal remains by deducing biological characteristics such as [[sex]], [[Ageing|age]], [[Human height|stature]], and [[Ancestor|ancestry]] from the [[skeleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of forensic anthropology: especially as developed in the United States.|last=Stewart|first=T.D.|publisher=Charles C.

The profession of Anthropology has also received an additional sub-field with the rise of [[Digital anthropology]]. This new branch of the profession has an increased usage of [[computer]]s as well as interdisciplinary work with [[medicine]], computer visualization, [[industrial design]], [[biology]], and [[journalism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/174131450|title=Virtual anthropology : a guide to a new interdisciplinary field|last=1961-|first=Weber, Gerhard W.,|date=2011|publisher=Springer|others=Bookstein, Fred L., 1947-|isbn=9783211486474|location=Wien|oclc=174131450}}&lt;/ref&gt; Anthropologists in this field primarily study the evolution of human reciprocal relations with the [[computer-generated imagery|computer-generated]] world.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Libin|first=Alexander|last2=Libin|first2=Elena|date=2005|title=Cyber-anthropology: a new study on human and technological co-evolution|journal=Studies in Health Technology and Informatics|volume=118|pages=146–155|issn=0926-9630|pmid=16301776}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyber anthropologists also study digital and [[Cyberethics|cyber ethics]] along with the global implications of increasing connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/50279971|title=Ethics and the profession of anthropology : dialogue for ethically conscious practice|date=2002|publisher=AltaMira Press|others=Fluehr-Lobban, Carolyn.|isbn=9780759103375|edition=2nd|location=Walnut Creek|oclc=50279971}}&lt;/ref&gt; With cyber ethical issues such as [[net neutrality]] increasingly coming to light, this sub-field is rapidly gaining more recognition.

'''''Armored Core: For Answer''''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[vehicular combat]] [[mecha]]-based [[video game]] developed by [[FromSoftware]] and published by [[Ubisoft]] for the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]]. It is the 13th installment of [[FromSoftware]]'s ''[[Armored Core]]'' series. ''Armored Core: For Answer'' is the direct sequel to ''[[Armored Core 4]]'', and takes place around ten years later. It was released in Japan on March 19, 2008, in North America on September 16, 2008, and in Europe on October 3, 2008.

==Gameplay==
AC customization has been changed from the previous ''Armored Core'' title, with a new interface and many new parts not found in ''[[Armored Core 4]]''. Online mode returns with a new co-operative mode alongside the player versus mode. Gameplay enhancements included a power increase for both Quick Boost and Over Boost, as well as an auxiliary high speed booster known as Vanguard Over Booster (VOB). Another new feature in the game is the Assault Armor attack that becomes available by equipping certain OB parts. This attack uses up all available Primal Armor that the AC has and generates a huge blast consisting of Kojima (highly reactive particles) that destroys or damages all objects surrounding the AC. However, this also leaves the AC vulnerable because not only will the AC lose its PA, it will also not regenerate for a few seconds. Laser blades are deadlier because of the revamped laser blade attack. Once the blade has acquired a lock-on, the AC will instantly rush to the target, traveling a great distance to use the laser blade. All parts carried over from the previous game have had their parameters altered, much like the transition between previous series installments Silent Line and Nexus. The on-screen HUD can now be changed to any of 20 colors. There are now 442 FRS tuning points available to unlock, which is an increase from the 300 (PS3) and 337 (Xbox 360) FRS points available in AC4. Maps are much larger and more detailed including environment damage such as collapsing buildings. The game is also the second in the series (after [[Armored Core: Last Raven#Endings|Last Raven]]) to feature multiple endings, with three different possible plot branches available depending on your actions and decisions in the game.{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}}

''Armored Core: For Answer'' received generally mixed reviews.  The scores tended to be about the same or a little lower than those for ''[[Armored Core 4#Reception|Armored Core 4]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamerankings.com/browse.html?search=Armored+Core+4&amp;numrev=3&amp;site= ''Armored Core 4'' reviews at GameRankings]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamerankings.com/htmlpages2/944262.asp?q=armored%20core%20for%20answer ''Armored Core: For Answer'' Reviews at GameRankings]&lt;/ref&gt; (with exceptions, such as IGN, who scored the game considerably higher than AC4)&lt;ref&gt;[http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/912/912354p1.html Armored Core for Answer Xbox 360 Review at IGN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ps3.ign.com/articles/912/912337p1.html Armored Core for Answer PS3 Review At IGN]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/774/774515p1.html Armored Core 4 Xbox 360 Review at IGN]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most consistent complaints among reviewers seemed to be the lack of any sort of online community. Kevin Van Ord of GameSpot stated in his review that there were "fewer than a dozen [players on] [[Xbox Live]]" when he tried to playtest the game, and that similar attempts to find a game on [[PlayStation Network]] yielded "just a single opponent".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gamespot.com/ps3/sim/armoredcoreforanswer/review.html?tag=result;score;0 Armored Core: For Answer Review for PlayStation 3 at Gamespot]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Arriva Sapphire''' is a premium brand used by various [[Arriva UK Bus|Arriva]] bus subsidiaries in the United Kingdom.

==History==
[[File:Arriva Sapphire Logo.png|thumb|Arriva Sapphire logo used 2013–17]]
In February 2013 [[Arriva UK Bus|Arriva]] announced that it would launch a premium service under the Sapphire brand for its bus services in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=B&amp;CP210213&gt;{{cite news |url= http://busandcoach.com/news/articles/archive/arriva-launches-sapphire-upgrade/ |title=Arriva launches Sapphire upgrade |newspaper=Bus and Coach Professional |publisher=Plum Publishing Ltd |date=21 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is similar to the [[Stagecoach Gold]] brand launched by [[Stagecoach Group|Stagecoach]] in 2007.

The brand was launched initially on four pilot routes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://web.archive.org/web/20130501120638/http://www.arrivasapphire.co.uk/where-we-operate |title=Where We Operate |website=Arriva Sapphire |publisher=Arriva}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 the brand was Extended to 11 more routes with another six scheduled for conversion in late 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.route-one.net/industry/operations/11-new-routes-arrivas-sapphire/ |title=11 new routes for Arriva's Sapphire |newspaper=Route One |publisher=[[Diversified Communications]] UK |date=9 July 2014}}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.arrivasapphire.co.uk/where-we-operate/ |title=Where We Operate |website=Arriva Sapphire}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=B&amp;CP050315&gt;{{cite news |url= http://busandcoach.com/news/articles/archive/adl-in-pole-position-as-arriva-confirms-2015-orders/ |title=ADL in pole position as Arriva confirms 2015 orders |newspaper=Bus and Coach Professional |publisher=Plum Publishing Ltd |date=5 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 the Sapphire brand was shortlisted for an award for exemplary commitment to customer excellence at the [[International Association of Public Transport]] World Congress &amp; Exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://busandcoach.com/news/articles/archive/uitp-award-nomination-for-sapphire-brand/ |title=UITP award nomination for Sapphire brand |newspaper=Bus and Coach Professional |publisher=Plum Publishing Ltd |date=14 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 Arriva Sapphire was rebranded with a new logo and livery, in line with the complete rebrand of Arriva. However the original Best Impressions designed logo is still embroidered on the seats of new vehicles. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.arrivabus.co.uk/kent-and-surrey/floating/sapphire-700/ |title=We're upgrading the Chatham to Bluewater 700 services to join our select family of premium Sapphire routes. |publisher=Arriva |date=12 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gardner's Book of Shadows front.JPG|thumb|right|300px|One of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]]'s earliest Books of Shadows.]]

A '''Book of Shadows''' is a book containing religious texts and instructions for [[magic (paranormal)|magical]] rituals found within the [[Neopaganism|Neopagan]] religion of [[Wicca]], and in many pagan practices. One famous Book of Shadows was created by the pioneering Wiccan [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] sometime in the late 1940s or early 1950s, and which he utilised first in his [[Bricket Wood coven]] and then in other covens which he founded in following decades. The Book of Shadows is also used by other Wiccan traditions, such as [[Alexandrian Wicca|Alexandrianism]] and Mohsianism, and with the rise of books teaching people how to begin following Wicca in the 1970s onward, the idea of the Book of Shadows was then further propagated amongst solitary practitioners unconnected to earlier traditions.

Initially, when Wicca was still dominated by [[coven]]s, "only one copy [of the Book] existed for an entire coven, kept by the high priestess or high priest. That rule has proved unfeasible, and it is [now] commonplace for all Witches to have their own copies."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gui08|Guiley 2008]]. p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; In the various traditions that make up [[British Traditional Wicca]],  copies of the original Book composed by Gerald Gardner with the aid of his High Priestess [[Doreen Valiente]], along with alterations and additions that have been made since then, is followed by adherents. They have tried to keep the contents of this Book a secret, although it has been published on a number of occasions by figures such as [[Charles Cardell]], Lady Sheba, and [[Janet Farrar|Janet]] and [[Stewart Farrar]]. In other Wiccan traditions and amongst a number of solitary practitioners, alternate versions of the Book have been written that are independent of Gardner's original.

Numerous associations and traditions have since grown up around the Book of Shadows. Traditionally, "a Witch's book of shadows is destroyed upon death."&lt;ref&gt;[[#Gui08|Guiley 2008]]. p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; The concept of the Book of Shadows has subsequently appeared in popular culture, for instance being utilised in the American television series ''[[Charmed]]'' and providing the title of films, musical albums and comics. However, in all these cases it was taken out of its original Wiccan context{{fact|date=November 2013}}.

==History==
===Origins===

Gerald Gardner, the "father of Wicca", first introduced the Book of Shadows to people that he had initiated into the craft through his [[Bricket Wood coven]] in the 1950s. He claimed that it was a personal cookbook of spells that have worked for the owner; they could copy from his own book and add or remove material as they saw fit. He said that the practice of Witches keeping such a book was ancient, and was practised by the [[Witch-cult]] throughout history. According to tradition, Gardner claimed, the book was burned after a person died, so that it would not be discovered that they had been a witch.

Gerald Gardner did not mention any such thing as a "Book of Shadows" in his 1949 (though written three years earlier), novel about mediaeval witchcraft, ''High Magic's Aid''. Doreen Valiente claimed that this was because at the time, Gardner had not yet conceived of the idea, and only invented it after writing his novel.

High Priestess [[Doreen Valiente]] made the claim that Gardner found the term "Book of Shadows" from a 1949 edition (Volume I, Number 3) of a magazine known as ''The Occult Observer''. In this edition, she claimed, was an advertisement for Gardner's novel, ''High Magic's Aid'', which was opposite an article titled "The Book of Shadows" written by the [[palmistry|palmist]] Mir Bashir. The article in question was about an allegedly ancient [[Sanskrit]] divination manual which explained how to foretell things based upon the length of a person's shadow.&lt;ref name="Valiente1"&gt;{{cite book | first=Doreen | last=Valiente | authorlink=Doreen Valiente | title=The Rebirth of Witchcraft | publisher = Hale| year=1989}} Page 51&lt;/ref&gt; Valiente theorised that Gardner then adopted this term for his Witches' [[grimoire]]. She maintained that "It was a good name, and it is a good name still, wherever Gardner found it".&lt;ref name="Valiente1" /&gt;
[[File:Ye Booke Of Ye Art Magical.JPG|right|thumb|A typescript from a page of ''Ye Booke of Ye Art Magical'']]

A leather bound manuscript written in Gardner's handwriting that was titled ''Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical'' was later found amongst his papers from the Museum after his death by [[Aidan Kelly]]&lt;ref&gt;''Crafting the Art of Magic: Book I, Aidan Kelly, page xvii, Llewellyn Publications, 1991&lt;/ref&gt; and was later obtained by Richard and Tamarra James of the [[Wiccan Church of Canada]]. It appeared to be a first draft of Gardner's Book of Shadows, and featured sections based upon the rituals of the [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] which had been devised by the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 58&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner had gained access to these rituals in 1946, when he had purchased a charter from Crowley giving him permission to perform the OTO rituals.

Some people have taken this as evidence that Gardner invented the idea of a Witches' [[Grimoire]], perhaps sometime between 1946 (when he finished his novel ''High Magic's Aid''), and 1949, and had named it ''Ye Bok of Ye Art Magical''. In 1949, he had renamed it to the ''Book of Shadows'', and soon began to make use of it with his Bricket Wood Coven.

Adding weight to the evidence indicating Gardner invented the Book was that other Neo-pagan witches of the time, such as [[Roy Bowers|Robert Cochrane]], never made use of such a book.&lt;ref name="ValienteCochrane"&gt;{{cite book | first=Doreen | last=Valiente | authorlink=Doreen Valiente | title=Witchcraft: A Tradition Renewed | publisher = Hale| year=1990}} Page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

===Valiente's rewriting===
In 1953, [[Doreen Valiente]] joined Gardner's [[Bricket Wood coven]], and soon rose to become its High Priestess. She noticed how much of the material in his Book of Shadows was taken not from ancient sources as Gardner had initially claimed, but from the works of the occultist [[Aleister Crowley]], from ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', from the ''[[Key of Solomon]]'' and also from the rituals of [[Freemasonry]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 54-55&lt;/ref&gt; She confronted Gardner with this, who admitted that the text he had received from the [[New Forest coven]] had been fragmentary and he had had to fill much of it using various sources. He also stated that "well, if you think you can do any better, go ahead",&lt;ref name="Witchcraft, Doreen Valiente page 61"&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 61&lt;/ref&gt; and Valiente thought that she could, later stating that:

{{quotation|''I accepted the challenge and set out to rewrite the Book of Shadows, cutting out the Crowleyanity as much as I could and trying to bring it back to what I felt was, if not so elaborate as Crowley's phraseology, at least our own and in our own words.''&lt;ref name="Witchcraft, Doreen Valiente page 61" /&gt;}}

Valiente rewrote much of it, cutting out a lot of sections that had come from Crowley (whose negative reputation she feared), though retaining parts that originated with ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', which she felt was genuine witchcraft practice. Valiente dramatically rewrote sections such as the ''[[Charge of the Goddess]]'' and also wrote several poems for the book, such as ''The Witches Rune''. She also helped to create a poem to include the [[Wiccan Rede]] within it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rosemary Ellen Guiley|Guiley, Rosemary Ellen]] (1999) ''The Encyclopedia of Witches and Witchcraft''. p348.&lt;/ref&gt;

Valiente also noticed that a chant in one ritual in the book was based upon the poem "A Tree Song" from ''[[Puck of Pook's Hill]]'' by [[Rudyard Kipling]], which she had enjoyed as a child.&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 54&lt;/ref&gt; The chant in question stated that:
:Oh, do not tell the priest our plight,
:Or he would call it sin;
:But - we have been in the woods all night,
:A-conjuring summer in !
:And we bring you news by word of mouth -
:Good news for cattle and corn -
:Now is the Sun come up from the South,
:With Oak, and Ash, and Thorn!&lt;ref&gt;''The Rebirth of Witchcraft'', Doreen Valiente, page 55&lt;/ref&gt;

(These eight lines are exactly the final stanza of [http://www.kipling.org.uk/poems_treesong.htm "A Tree Song"].)

This version of the ritual, written by both Gardner and Valiente, but containing sections adopted from various sources, such as [[Aleister Crowley]], ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'', and even [[Rudyard Kipling]], went on to become the traditional text for [[Gardnerian Wicca]].

==In British Traditional Wicca==

In forms of [[British Traditional Wicca]], which include [[Gardnerian Wicca]], [[Alexandrian Wicca]] and [[Algard Wicca]], the Book of Shadows used by adherents is based upon that written by Gardner and Valiente.

Although his own book had been put together with the help of [[Doreen Valiente]] and included material from a variety of modern sources, (notably from ''[[Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches]]'' and the writings of [[Aleister Crowley]]) it also included sections written in an antique (or mock-antique) style, including advice for witches brought to [[Witch-hunt|trial]] and tortured. Gardner claimed that these sections were genuinely historical in origin, and that witches had not been allowed to write anything down until recently, to avoid incrimination; when at last Books of Shadows were allowed, the rituals and spells had to be written in a jumbled manner to prevent any non-initiate from using them.&lt;ref name="50YearsBoS"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lamond |first=Frederic |year=2004 |title=Fifty Years of Wicca |location=Sutton Mallet, England |publisher=Green Magic |pages=14–15 |isbn=0-9547230-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent scholars however have doubted their authenticity.

It seems likely that Gardner told his three subsequent initiatory lines that the book should be copied word for word, and Wiccans descended from [[Eleanor Bone]], [[Patricia Crowther (Wiccan)|Patricia Crowther]] and [[Monique Wilson]] have widely believed that the book was of ancient provenance.&lt;ref name="50YearsBoS" /&gt; North American [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerians]] of the Long Island line allow covens to add rituals and teachings to the book, but nothing may be removed.&lt;ref name="50YearsInitiatoryValidity"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lamond |first=Frederic |year=2004 |title=Fifty Years of Wicca |location=Sutton Mallet, England |publisher=Green Magic |pages=63 |isbn=0-9547230-1-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary usage===
There sometimes exists two Books of Shadows kept by more traditional Wiccans, one being a coven book of core rituals and practises which remains unchanged and from which new initiates copy, and the second, intended for personal use, which differs from witch to witch and contains magical material collected by the initiate, such as [[astrology]], [[herbalism|herbal lore]], and information regarding [[divination]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Maxine Sanders|Sanders, Maxine]]. "A Talk by Maxine Sanders" part 1, ''Witchcraft and Wicca'' Issue 3, p. 4. London: Children of Artemis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Publication===
After Gardner's death, his rival, [[Charles Cardell]], published much of the material from the Gardnerian Book of Shadows. In the 1970s, the then Alexandrians [[Janet Farrar]] and [[Stewart Farrar]] decided, with the consent of [[Doreen Valiente]], that much of the Gardnerian book should be published in its true form. Much of it was published by the Farrars in their 1984 book ''The Witches' Way''.

==In Eclectic Wicca==
In non-traditional or "eclectic" forms of Wiccan or [[Neo-paganism|Neo-pagan]] practice, the term ''Book of Shadows'' is more often used to describe a personal [[diary|journal]], rather than a traditional text. This journal records [[ritual]]s, [[spell (paranormal)|spells]], and their results, as well as other [[Magic (paranormal)|magical]] information. This can be either an individual or coven text, and is not normally passed from teacher to student. In many cases, this kind of Book of Shadows is an [[file (computing)|electronic document]] (disk or [[website]]) instead of a hand-written one. Some reserve the Book of Shadows for recording spells and keep a separate book, sometimes called the '''Book of Mirrors''' to contain thoughts, feelings and experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Cunningham]], ''Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practitioner'', Llewellyn Books, pp. 79-80.&lt;/ref&gt;
==Other traditions==
Not all traditions of Wicca utilize the term "Book of Shadows". In Seax Wica, a tradition founded by Raymond Buckland, the Book of Shadows is called "The Tree", and in Devotional Wicca, the book is titled "The Book of Ways"; many traditions refer to their Books of Shadows as simply "The Book".
==In popular culture==
The television fantasy series ''[[Charmed]]'' features a fictional ''[[Book of Shadows (Charmed)|Book of Shadows]]'' which contains spells and arcane law, and has a supernatural ability to defend itself from harm. In the 1996 film ''[[The Craft (film)|The Craft]]'', which some critics saw as a major influence on the series ''Charmed'',&lt;ref name="DVDVerdict1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/charmedseason1.php |title=Charmed: The Complete First Season |work=DVD Verdict |first=Judge Brett |last=Cullum |date=2005-02-02 |accessdate=2008-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080321011436/http://www.dvdverdict.com/reviews/charmedseason1.php |archivedate=2008-03-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DVDTimes1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dvdtimes.co.uk/content.php?contentid=56208 |title=Charmed: The Complete First Season |work=DVD Times |date=2005-02-18 |accessdate=2008-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Book of Shadows'' was referred to as an object in which a witch keeps her "power thoughts".

The 2000 sequel to ''[[The Blair Witch Project]]'' was titled ''[[Book of Shadows: Blair Witch 2]]'' and featured a Wiccan character, despite there being no mention of a "Book of Shadows", during the film. But in the film's [[Teaser campaign|teaser trailer]], reveals the "Book of Shadows" itself but never appeared in the film. In the trailer, the "Book of Shadows" was found by a half-naked woman, Erica Geerson (portrayed by [[Erica Leerhsen]]) in the woods of [[Burkittsville, Maryland|Black Hills]], until she was attacked by an unknown man.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|work=The Guardian|date=September 29, 2000|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/sep/29/news|accessdate=April 18, 2018|title=Net debut for Blair Witch 2 trailer}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title was seen as an attempt to capitalise on the ''Charmed'' series' established market.&lt;ref name="11thHour"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.the11thhour.com/archives/112000/moviereviews/blairwitch2.html |title=Wow, they made a whole movie about the book from Charmed! |work=The 11th Hour Web Magazine |first= |last= |year=2000 |accessdate=2008-04-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080807164106/http://www.the11thhour.com/archives/112000/moviereviews/blairwitch2.html |archivedate=2008-08-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 2011 television series, ''[[The Secret Circle]]'' each family is shown to have their own "Book of Shadows", with each book containing unique spells. As the book is passed down from generation to generation, each generation appears to write their own spells or notes, as indicated by Cassie's recognition of her mother's handwriting in her own family's "Book of Shadows".

The Japanese horror adventure game ''Corpse Party: Book of Shadows'' deals with the eponymous book during its final chapter, in which it is revealed to be an actual Book of Shadows very much in keeping with the description in this article (albeit in the game, there is only one Book of Shadows that exists, containing a complete chronicle of all spells that exist in the entire world, be they Wiccan or not).

In the Australian television series ''[[Nowhere Boys]]'' two characters are known to possess a Book of Shadows. One being one of the protagonists, Felix Ferne, and one being an antagonist, Alice Hartley. Felix's book was first thought to be his diary as he tried to hide its true existence from his friends, and Alice's book was thought to be her sister's.

In the [[Editions of Dungeons &amp; Dragons#Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5th edition|fifth edition]] of roleplaying game [[Dungeons &amp; Dragons]], members of the [[Warlock (Dungeons &amp; Dragons)|warlock class]] can gain a Book of Shadows, which enables them to learn extra spells and rituals regardless of whether or not such magic is ordinarily accessible through the warlock class.

"'''Brian in Love'''" is the fourth episode and the mid-season premiere from the second season of the [[Fox Broadcasting Company|FOX]]  [[list of animated television series|animated series]] ''[[Family Guy]]''. It aired on March 7, 2000 and guest stars [[Sam Waterston]] as Dr. Kaplan. The episode sees [[Brian Griffin]] visit a psychiatrist to aid his [[urinary incontinence]], and then discovers his love for [[Lois Griffin|Lois]].

==Plot summary==
[[Lois Griffin|Lois]] is upset that [[Stewie Griffin|Stewie]] has [[urination|wet]] the carpet in the living room. Stewie emphatically denies doing so, but Lois and [[Peter Griffin|Peter]] are convinced that it is a sign that Stewie is ready to [[Toilet training|potty train]]. After a failed attempt by Peter at getting Stewie to use the toilet, the family goes to the supermarket to buy groceries. In the checkout line, [[Brian Griffin|Brian]] [[urination|urinates]] once again, revealing that Stewie is innocent.

This leads to Brian seeing Dr. Kaplan, a [[psychiatrist]]. The doctor decides Brian is having a [[midlife crisis]], so Brian goes traveling. Brian feels better, but shortly after returning, Stewie gets revenge by framing Brian for peeing all over the living room. While unable to remember having done so, Brian believes he has done it himself and returns to Dr. Kaplan to find out why. After revealing that his last accident happened after watching Lois and Peter have a water fight while washing the car, Dr. Kaplan tells Brian that he thinks Brian might be in love with Lois. Stewie catches on when Brian attempts to flirt with Lois and smells one of her shirts and nearly exposes him by cuddling up with Lois.

Later, Brian implies to Lois his feelings and she sweetly rejects him. He then wonders what would happen if they were both drunk, to which Lois starts to respond, "Well I'd have to be really..." before giving a flat-out "No!". An oblivious Peter conjectures that Brian's beloved would "probably end up with some idiot".

==Reception==
In his 2008 review, Ahsan Haque of [[IGN]] rated the episode an 8/10, saying that the episode shows Brian's love for Lois in "a perfectly believable and somewhat heartfelt earnest manner". He stated that "while not every joke works [...] the focus on Brian's feelings is pretty significant for the series from both an entertainment and ongoing storyline perspective." &lt;ref name=ign&gt;{{cite web |author=Haque, Ahsan |title=Family Guy: "Brian in Love" Review |publisher=[[IGN]] |url=http://tv.ign.com/articles/896/896754p1.html |accessdate=2009-12-02 |date=6 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Canadian cuisine}}
A '''butter tart''' is a type of small [[pastry]] tart highly regarded in [[Canadian cuisine]] and considered one of Canada's quintessential treats. The sweet tart consists of a filling of [[butter]], [[sugar]], syrup, and [[egg (food)|egg]], baked in a [[pastry]] shell until the filling is semi-solid with a crunchy top.&lt;ref name=great&gt;{{Cite episode |title=What makes a great butter tart? |series=[[Morningside (radio program)|Morningside]] |credits= Presenter:[[Peter Gzowski]] Guests:Max Burns, Marion Kane, Charles Pachter |network=[[CBC Radio]] |station=[[CBC Radio One]] |location=[[Moose Jaw]] |airdate=December 5, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The butter tart should not be confused with [[butter pie]] (a savoury pie from the [[Preston, Lancashire|Preston]] area of [[Lancashire]], [[England]]) or with [[bread and butter pudding]].

Recipes for the butter tart vary according to the families baking them. Because of this, the appearance and physical characteristics of the butter tart – the firmness of its pastry, or the consistency of its filling – also vary.&lt;ref name=SS/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Better butter tarts |journal=The Ottawa Citizen |date=October 26, 2006 |url=http://www.canada.com/topics/lifestyle/food/story.html?id=be2adf75-3134-4a2d-97b2-280c9155d9c2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110140939/http://www.canada.com/topics/lifestyle/food/story.html?id=be2adf75-3134-4a2d-97b2-280c9155d9c2 |archivedate=November 10, 2012 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, the [[English Canadian]] [[tart]] consists of butter, sugar, and eggs in a pastry shell, similar to the French-Canadian [[sugar pie]], or the base of the U.S. [[pecan pie]] without the [[nut (fruit)|nut]] topping. The butter tart is different from [[pecan pie]] in that it has a "runnier" filling due to the omission of corn starch. Often [[raisin]]s, [[walnut]]s or [[pecan]]s are added to the traditional butter tart. However purists contend that such additions should not be allowed.

More exotic flavours are also produced by some bakers. Examples such as [[maple syrup|maple]]– [[bacon]], [[pumpkin]], [[chili pepper|chili]] and [[salted caramel]] [[cardamom]] flavours have been made for competitions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.thestar.com/life/food_wine/2015/06/25/ontarios-best-butter-tart-bakers-gather-in-midland-for-a-contest-and-festival.html "Ontario's best butter tart bakers gather in Midland for a contest and festival"], Jennifer Bain, Toronto Star, June 25, 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Butter tarts were common in pioneer Canadian cooking, and they remain a characteristic pastry of Canada, considered a recipe of genuinely Canadian origin. It is primarily eaten in and associated with the English-speaking provinces of [[Canada]].

Some suggested pastries with similar origins to the butter tart include:&lt;ref name="great" /&gt;
*'''Border tart''': a similar pie including dried fruit from the [[Anglo-Scottish border|Anglo-Scottish border country]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.torontosun.com/life/eat/2010/06/07/14296321.html |title=On the butter tart trail |work=[[Toronto Sun]] |date=June 16, 2010 |accessdate=September 22, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Sugar pie]] (''{{lang|fr|tarte au sucre}}'')''': which possibly came with the arrival of the "[[King's Daughters]]" in [[Quebec]] during the 1600s, where the imported brides used [[maple syrup]], [[butter]] and [[dried fruit]] to make a possible precursor to modern examples of the butter tart,&lt;ref name=SS&gt;{{citation|first=Susan |last=Sampson |url=https://www.thestar.com/Life/article/211699 |title=The art of the tart |date=May 9, 2007 |publisher=Toronto Star |journal=thestar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[Pecan pie]]''': which possibly came north from the southern [[United States]],
*'''Backwards pie''': which is found in [[the Maritimes]] and western Canada and made with corn syrup,
*'''[[Shoofly pie]]''': which is made with molasses and comes from the [[Pennsylvania Dutch]] community,
*'''[[Treacle tart]]''': which is an English pastry made with [[golden syrup]] or [[treacle]].

The earliest published Canadian recipe is from [[Barrie]], Ontario, dating back to 1900 and can be found in The Women's Auxiliary of the Royal Victoria Hospital Cookbook,&lt;ref name=hj&gt;{{Citation |title=Structural Elements in Canadian Cuisine |first=Hersch |last=Jacobs |journal=Cuizine: The Journal of Canadian Food Cultures |volume=2 |number=1 |year=2009 |url=http://www.erudit.org/revue/cuizine/2009/v2/n1/039510ar.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; to which a Mrs. Mary Ethel MacLeod submitted the recipe for a butter tart filling.&lt;ref&gt;Mrs. Malcolm MacLeod and her recipe for butter tart filling https://www.simcoe.ca/Archives/Pages/Mrs-MacLeods-Butter-Tarts.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; The original cookbook and recipe is housed at the Simcoe County Archives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title=The Canadian history of the butter tart (video) |journal=Breakfast TV video, City TV |url=http://www.bttoronto.ca/videos/the-canadian-history-of-the-butter-tart/|date=January 17, 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another early publication of a butter tart recipe was found in a 1915 pie cookbook.&lt;ref name=great/&gt; The food was an integral part of early Canadian cuisine and often viewed as a source of pride.&lt;ref name=hj/&gt;

Similar tarts are made in Scotland, where they are often referred to as ''Ecclefechan butter tarts'' from the town of [[Ecclefechan]].  In [[France]], they are related to the much more common ''{{lang|fr|tarte à la frangipane}}'', that differs from the basic Canadian recipe only by the addition of ground almonds.

==Cultural identity==
Butter tarts are an integral part of Eastern Canadian cuisine and are objects of cultural pride of many communities across [[Ontario]] and indeed Canada.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Does Canada Have a National Dish? |url=http://www.canadianliving.com/blogs/food/2009/06/30/does-canada-have-a-national-dish/ |first=Elizabeth |last=Baird |date=June 30, 2009 |journal=Canadian Living}}&lt;/ref&gt; This cultural and community connection with the tart has spawned butter tart themed tourism such as the Butter Tart festival at [[Muskoka Lakes]], Ontario,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |journal=Bracebridge Examiner |first=Laura |last=Finney |first2=Alison |last2=Sandstrom |date=July 11, 2013 |title=Buttertart festival a big success |url=http://www.cottagecountrynow.ca/news-story/3887729-buttertart-festival-a-big-success/ |access-date=July 12, 2013 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130928021427/http://www.cottagecountrynow.ca/news-story/3887729-buttertart-festival-a-big-success/# |archive-date=September 28, 2013 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; the trademarked "Butter Tart Trail" at [[Wellington North, Ontario]], and the "Butter Tart Tour" in [[Kawarthas Northumberland]], Ontario.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://www.mykawartha.com/news-story/3885882-misunderstanding-over-butter-tarts-could-turn-into-sweet-success-for-city-bakeries/ |date=July 10, 2013 |journal=Kawartha Lakes This Week |title=Misunderstanding over butter tarts could turn into sweet success for City bakeries}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two competing associations have since resolved their dispute through the mutual agreement to modify "The Butter Tart Tour" to "Kawarthas Northumberland Butter Tart Tour".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|first=Kirk |last=Dickson |title=Wellington North In Butter Tart Taste Off |date=August 14, 2013 |publisher=Blackburn Radio Inc. |url=http://blackburnnews.com/midwestern-ontario/midwestern-ontario-news/2013/08/14/wellington-north-in-butter-tart-taste-off/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130917224432/http://blackburnnews.com/midwestern-ontario/midwestern-ontario-news/2013/08/14/wellington-north-in-butter-tart-taste-off/ |archivedate=September 17, 2013 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The first Kawarthas Northumberland Butter Tart Tour Taste-Off was launched at the Flavour Festival in Peterborough on Sunday, April 28, 2013, where four bakeries were crowned winners by a panel of celebrity judges.

Ontario's Best Butter Tart Festival and Contest is an annual event held in [[Midland, Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Butter Tart Fans Flock to Midland |url=http://www.simcoe.com/community-story/3842983-buttertart-fans-flock-to-midland/ |first=Nikki | last=Million-Cole |date=June 17, 2013 | journal=The Midland Mirror}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The contest portion of the festival attracts bakers from across Ontario, and is Canada's largest butter tart themed celebration, with over 50,000 tarts sold in the festival market in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=50 fun things to do in cottage country this spring |url=http://cottagelife.com/99787/environment/50-fun-things-to-do-in-cottage-country-this-spring}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even ''[[National Geographic]]'' recognizes the significance of the butter tart in an article on Georgian Bay, Ontario. In October 2013, referring to a stand in Wasaga Beach, they stated that "It's the homemade Canadian butter tarts – flaky crust with gooey pecan filling – that set this place apart from other lakeside ice cream stands." &lt;ref&gt;[http://travel.nationalgeographic.com/travel/canada/georgian-bay-ontario/ National Geographic]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <comment>/* 1920s styles */Fixed chronology to Jeep coat (1940’s) being the forerunner of the _modern_ car coat, since the article up until that point has been talking about car coats from 1909–1930’s, so a 1940’s coat clearly couldn’t be the forerunner of them all.</comment>

A '''car coat''' is an outer garment originally made to be worn by automobile drivers and passengers. First designed to provide maximum warmth and coverage, over time it became a much shorter garment. Today it describes a coat that typically ends at mid thigh. It is worn by both men and women.

While fur, leather and heavy wool were preferred in the early days, today the coat may be made in a wide variety of materials. In the period after [[World War II]], it took on design elements of the jeep coat worn by servicemen and this is when the shorter length became common. As car ownership grew so did the popularity of the coat; by the 1960s it was described as "ubiquitous". The car coat remains popular today, both as a functional and a fashion garment.

==Early history of the car coat==
Originally the car coat was more usually termed 'motoring dress'. It emerged in the early 1900s, when driving was considered an outdoor sport (most cars were open top) and required protective clothing.&lt;ref name="The Dictionary of Fashion History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cumming|first1=Valerie|last2=Cunnington|first2=C.W.|last3=Cunnington|first3=P.|title=The Dictionary of Fashion History|date=2010|publisher=Berg|location=Oxford|page=135|isbn=9781847887382|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e3evAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=history+of+fashion+%2B+car+coats&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=v4vXAagZr9&amp;sig=paM2xjvEU6kRpxGEExdSlGIhPOQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=3r5fVKD-OLSBsQTT7YLoBQ&amp;ved=0CGAQ6AEwDQ#v=onepage&amp;q=history%20of%20fashion%20%2B%20car%20coats&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clothing for men and women and for driver and passenger was relatively similar, comprising a long heavy coat. This was often in fur or lined with fur, although sometimes it was in heavy cloth. In summer, women would wear a [[duster coat]], sometimes called a dust coat, to cover their garments, in a cloth such as [[linen]] or [[Alpaca|alpaca wool]].&lt;ref name="The Dictionary of Fashion History"/&gt; This would be accessorised with gloves, goggles and a hat – women often wore elaborate hats and veils, while men would wear a cap. These accessories were worn year round.&lt;ref name="The Dictionary of Fashion History"/&gt;

Motoring was still an activity for the elite, however the privations of driving in a vehicle that broke down frequently and provided no retreat from the elements, meant clothing had to be functional and warm. Sports motorist [[Dorothy Levitt]] – author of the 1909 handbook ''The Woman and the Car'' and dubbed 'the fastest woman on earth' for her 'scorching' (speeding) antics round tracks such as [[Brooklands]] – provided useful tips for women drivers on what to wear, along with guidance about the mechanical aspects of driving. On choosing the right coat, she said: "Under no circumstance wear lace or fluffy adjuncts to your toilet. There is nothing like a thick frieze, homespun or tweed coat lined with fur. Do not heed the cry, 'nothing like leather.' Leather coats do not wear gracefully."&lt;ref name="WaC" &gt;{{cite book|title=The Woman and the Car|last=Levitt  |first=Dorothy|isbn=978-0-238-78967-0|year=1909
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1920s styles==
In the 1920s, women continued to favour male motoring dress and this also crossed over into high fashion. A 1921 article in ''[[The Times]]'' about the latest Paris fashions described a red leather motoring coat fastened with metal buckles.&lt;ref name="The Times 42799."&gt;{{cite news|title=A Woman's View: Paris Fashions|issue=42799.|publisher=The Times|date=15 August 1921|ref=pg.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar leather coats had been popular for chauffeurs and male motorists for several years. Fur was still popular, with a fashion correspondent noting that the [[British International Motor Show|Motor Show]] in [[Olympia (London)|Olympia]] was transforming shop windows around London. She recommended the latest craze for fur-lined coats in [[Tweed (cloth)|tweed]], [[Velour|wool velour]] and [[Cheviot (cloth)|cheviot]]. [[Muskrat|Musquash]] and [[Nutria fur|nutria]] were also being chosen by women motorists, while in [[Knightsbridge]], one new store was offering women's coats suitable for motoring made from men's suiting cloth.&lt;ref name="The Times 43787"&gt;{{cite news|title=Round the shops: motoring outfits|issue=43787|publisher=The Times|date=20 October 1924|ref=pg.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Zez Confrey.jpg|thumb|Composer [[Zez Confrey]] wearing a fur motoring coat – fur would remain popular driving gear for men and women]]
Accessories also followed the unisex trend; ''The Times'' described the arrival of neat leather caps as a fashion accessory for women in 1923.&lt;ref name="The Times 43486"&gt;{{cite news|title=London fashions: some new millinery|issue=43486|publisher=The Times|date=31 October 1923|ref=pg. 17}}&lt;/ref&gt; This style of sporty hat was worn in the iconic [[Tamara de Lempicka]] self-portrait of 1929 in which she is driving a green [[Bugatti]] with leather cap and driving gloves – reputed to be based on an [[Hermès]] set that she had seen on the cover of the magazine ''[[Vu (magazine)|Vu]]''. As this portrait suggests, and Peter Thorold has noted, the car had become the ultimate symbol of modernity and emancipation, something that was reflected in the styling of clothes.&lt;ref name="The Motoring Age Thorold"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Thorold|first1=Peter|title=The Motoring Age: 1896-1939|date=2003|publisher=Profile Books|location=Hatton Garden, London|isbn=9781847651020|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4OCEVCFplMUC&amp;pg=PT66&amp;lpg=PT66&amp;dq=tamara+de+lempicka+%2B+motorist&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=SuhdbUKi6L&amp;sig=YRKeFXWhhC4FOnRSdhmDfuKbNFQ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HSxhVMj3Boyu7Ab-q4CgBA&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBA#v=onepage&amp;q=tamara%20de%20lempicka%20%2B%20motorist&amp;f=false|accessdate=10 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although no coat is visible in the de Lempicka portrait, by the late 1920s the latest motoring coats from France were worn long, made of tweed or flannel with narrow leather belts and collars in fur or flannel.&lt;ref name="The Times 45528"&gt;{{cite news|title=Paris Fashions: Midsummer out of doors|issue=45528|publisher=The Times|date=2 June 1930|ref=pg.17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Wide raglan sleeves were popular – allowing freedom of movement – and collars could be military in style with buttons up to the neck.&lt;ref name="The Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Round the shops: clothes for election campaign|issue=45955|publisher=The Times|date=16 October 1931|ref=pg.11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reporting on fashions in the shops ahead of the 1931 Motor Show, ''The Times'' described not only furs, but a new trend for shorter coats – made of suede and silk lined with [[Zipper|zips]] as fastening – for walking and motoring.&lt;ref name="The Times 46263"&gt;{{cite news|title=Trade improved by cold weather:  Motor Show visitors|issue=46263|publisher=The Times|date=13 October 1932|ref=pg.11}}&lt;/ref&gt; As cars became more common and designs provided more protection from the elements, clothing reduced in weight and quantity.  However the leather motoring coat remained popular as a distinct item of dress throughout the 1930s.&lt;ref name="The Dictionary of Fashion History"/&gt; 
[[File:Man looks under the hood of an old jeep from world war two.jpg|thumb|left|The jeep coat – as worn by servicemen during World War II – was the forerunner to the modern car coat]]

==Postwar designs==
The immediate precursor to the postwar (modern) car coat was based around the [[jeep coat]], a design popular in [[World War II|wartime]] for the drivers of open-topped vehicles. This was generally of a shorter length, ending at mid thigh.&lt;ref name="The Dictionary of Fashion History"/&gt;

By the early 1960s, some car coats were being designed in [[nylon]], a report from the British Nylon Spinners' Fair in London in 1961 described a new washable mock suede car coat with brushed fleece nylon lining as: "one of the good possibilities" of the technology.&lt;ref name="The Times 54998"&gt;{{cite news|title=Here and There|issue=54998|publisher=The Times|date=6 February 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt; Real leathers remained popular – showerproof suede models with detachable collars and large leather buttons were being designed for women by 1964. These were also in the shorter length, ending at mid thigh.&lt;ref name="The Times 56170"&gt;{{cite news|title=Devoted to women|issue=56170|publisher=The Times|date=16 November 1964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another new motoring design was the [[Roe deer|roebuck]] suede (deerskin) jacket, designed at hip length for both women and men, and described as a real innovation because: "A suede upon which grease, alcohol, even motor oil has no effect is a find indeed."&lt;ref name="The Times 56485"&gt;{{cite news|title=Coats in roebuck suede|issue=56485|publisher=The Times|date=22 November 1965|ref=pg.13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warmth was still considered a key component of the car coat, with water-repellent [[poplin]] models with padded and quilted linings being designed for women as "knock-about car coats". These came complete with detachable hoods and toggle fastenings.&lt;ref name="The Times 56485"/&gt; Fur was still being promoted for motorists, but as a prestige item to go with prestige cars. An advert from 1965 in ''The Times'' by the National Fur Company entitled "An ocelot in your Jaguar" said: "We consider that an important feature of a car coat is its length – about halfway between a jacket and a 3/4 coat. At this length, it's comfortable to wear when driving. It doesn't ride up. Or 'seat'. And there is no risk of undue wear on the seat or back."&lt;ref name="The Times 56457"&gt;{{cite news|title=About Fur: No.4. An ocelot in your Jaguar? (advert)|issue=56457|publisher=The Times|date=20 October 1965|ref=pg.14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The "ubiquitous" car coat==
By the late 1960s, the car coat was an item of leisurewear, rather than simply a motoring accessory, and was being produced in a variety of fabrics, including [[Shearling|sheepskin]] and the new [[Fake fur|manmade fur]] varieties. A fashion writer describing the uses of faux fur said: "Apart from coats they are made into all kinds of leisure wear, of which the now ubiquitous car coat is a conspicuous example. Derived from the more expensive but still popular sheepskin jacket, it is usually made from a cotton suedette or brushed nylon outer fabric lined with an acrylic pile".&lt;ref name="The Times 56614"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Elvin|first1=Rene|title=The new status symbol – deep pile fabrics|issue=56614|publisher=The Times|date=25 April 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:John Motson.jpg|thumb|150px|left|Football commentator [[John Motson]] got his first car coat in 1972, subsequently having them tailored in [[Savile Row]]]]

While women continued to wear the car-coat length – among others – by the mid 1960s the car coat had become a staple item of the male wardrobe. Editor of ''The Tailor and Cutter'' magazine John Taylor, writing in 1966, said: "The riding mac was the equivalent in the nineteen twenties and thirties of the car coat of the nineteen fifties and sixties. If a riding mac was worn there was the suggestion that it had been bought for a specific purpose. The wearer probably owned a hack and therefore was not a member of the ''hoi polloi''. For similar reasons today, however submerged in the psyches of their owners the reasons may lie, there are far more car coats in male wardrobes than there are cars in garages."&lt;ref name="The Times 56825"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Taylor|first1=John|title=English weather puts us into top gear|issue=56825|publisher=The Times|date=29 December 1966}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the car coat was by now a familiar item, it did not mean it couldn't be reinvented. Michael Carr, who had designed an [[Ergonomics|ergonomic]] racing suit for his company's co-director [[Stirling Moss]] applied first design principles to add functionality. Made of waterproofed poplin, his design of 1968 featured a zip front and separate [[velcro]] quick fasten strip. Buttons were designed so they didn't catch on the car [[seat belt]], gathered cuffs excluded draughts and pockets were designed to fall on the knee while seated in the car. There was also an interior deep pocket for roadmaps.&lt;ref name="The Times 57183"&gt;{{cite news|last1=King-Deacon|first1=Antony|title=Business Habits: sartorial science|issue=57183|publisher=The Times|date=23 February 1968|ref=pg.12}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 1970s, the car coat continued to be a wardrobe staple for men, while car coat became a description of cut and length in women's fashion (often looser and always shorter than a traditional coat).

===Car coats in popular culture===
From the 1980s on, the men's car coat started to symbolise a particular character or walk of life on British TV and in the press, especially when worn in sheepskin or camel hair. Sheepskin was the style favoured by [[Del Boy]] in ''[[Only Fools &amp; Horses]]'' and by [[Association football|football]] managers. It was also worn by detectives in ''[[The Sweeney]]''.&lt;ref name="BBC Nursey"&gt;{{cite news|title='Del Boy' sheepskin factory Nursey of Bungay shuts|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-suffolk-26684324|accessdate=13 November 2014|publisher=BBC|date=21 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Sunday Times Gerard"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gerard|first1=Jasper|title=It's a woman's life in The Sweeney|url=http://www.thesundaytimes.co.uk/sto/news/article34223.ece|accessdate=11 November 2014|publisher=The Sunday Times|date=14 December 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, the ''[[Life on Mars (UK TV series)|Life on Mars]]'' detective series, in which the hero is transported back to the 1970s, would reprise the car coat by giving DCI [[Gene Hunt]] a scruffy version in camel wool.&lt;ref name="Daily Mirror 220409"&gt;{{cite news|title=Gene Hunt's camel coat to make return in Ashes to Ashes|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/tv/tv-news/gene-hunts-camel-coat-to-make-389735|accessdate=11 November 2014|publisher=Daily Mirror|date=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; More celebrated still are the trademarked sheepskin car coats worn by BBC football commentator [[John Motson]] – he wore his first in 1972, acquired from a furrier he met at a party in Chelsea, and subsequently had them made on [[Savile Row]].&lt;ref name="The Guardian Lawson"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lawson|first1=James|title=John Motson: The Full Motty|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/profiles/john-motson-the-full-motty-856104.html|accessdate=11 November 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=28 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It had become such a shorthand description for British football pundits by the late 1990s that a ''Times'' feature about the warm-up for the 1998 World Cup began with the description: "Paul Sexton, our man in the sheepskin car coat, on the tournament for the World Cup".&lt;ref name="The Times 66228"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sexton|first1=Paul|title=Soccer it to me baby|issue=66228|publisher=The Times|date=15 June 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fashion revivals==
In the late 1990s the car coat attracted attention as a fashion curiosity when [[Liam Gallagher]] wore a sheepskin model to the [[Brit Awards]]; [[Craig David]] wore a similar design in 2001.&lt;ref name="The Times 65823"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Shilling|first1=Jane|title=Pass the cocoa, Liam|issue=65823|publisher=The Times|date=26 February 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Guardian Onanuga"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Onanuga|first1=Tola|title=Is Liam Gallagher a fashion pioneer|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/gallery/2009/mar/23/liam-gallagher-fashion-pioneer|accessdate=12 November 2014|publisher=The Guardian|date=23 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Times 67317"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sheep's clothing|issue=67317|publisher=The Times|date=8 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; The car coat length has remained popular since 2008 – with ''[[GQ]]'' citing the "''[[Mad Men]]'' effect" as a contributor to the revival of more formal and retro styles.&lt;ref name="GQ Durbin"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Durbin|first1=Jonathan|title=This Just In: La Rosa vintage car coat|url=https://www.gq.com/style/blogs/the-gq-eye/2008/10/this-just-in-la-rosa-vintage-car-coat.html|accessdate=12 November 2014|publisher=GQ|date=28 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010-11, it was popular on the catwalks for both men's and women's coats.&lt;ref name="Esquire 061011"&gt;{{cite news|title=Smart Buy - Gloverall Anniversary Car Coat|url=http://www.esquire.co.uk/style/fashion/1188/smart-buy-gloverall-anniversary-car-coat/|accessdate=12 November 2014|publisher=Esquire|date=6 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DT Armstrong"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Hilary|title=Diane Von Furstenberg autumn/winter 2010/11 collection|url=http://fashion.telegraph.co.uk/Article/TMG7242011/190/Diane-Von-Furstenberg-autumnwinter-201011-collection-New-York-Fashion-Week.html|accessdate=12 November 2014|publisher=Daily Telegraph|date=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some versions were in fur and [[shearling]] (sheepskin), as well as in camel colourways.

'''''Centurion: Defender of Rome''''' is a [[turn-based strategy]] [[video game]] with [[real-time tactics|real-time battle sequences]], designed by [[Kellyn Beck]] and Bits of Magic and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. Originally released for [[MS-DOS]] in 1990, the game was later ported to the [[Amiga]] and the [[Sega Genesis]] in 1991. ''Centurion'' shares much of the concept and feel with Beck's earlier game ''[[Defender of the Crown]]'' (1987).

==Story==
The game begins in [[Ancient Rome]] in the year 275 BC, placing the player in the sandals of a [[Centurion (Roman army)|centurion]] in the [[Roman army]], at first leading a single [[Roman legion|legion]]. The player's ultimate goal is to become a [[Caesar (title)|Caesar]] through a mix of successful military conquests and internal politics of "[[bread and circuses|Bread and Circuses]]".

== Gameplay ==
The bulk of the game involve turn-based strategic planning and management on the world map and the real-time battles (with on-demand pauses to give orders to formations) against various enemies of the [[Roman Empire]], such as the [[Celts]], [[Carthage|Carthaginians]] and [[Parthia]]ns. ''Centurion'' also featured other "side-show" activities, such as [[Gladiator|gladiatorial combat]] (the player's duties involve financing the [[ludi]] events), [[chariot racing]] in the [[Circus Maximus]], and [[Roman Navy|naval battles]]. There is also some diplomacy (it is even possible to seduce the queen [[Cleopatra]] after forming an alliance with [[Ancient Egypt|Egypt]]).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZkS-FT8vV0&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The game's designer, Kellyn Beck, was also the creator of several [[Cinemaware]] games and ''Centurion'' was similar in look to those games, featuring "cinematic" graphics, animation and sound effects. His inspiration for the game came from watching the films ''[[Ben-Hur (1959 film)|Ben Hur]]'' and ''[[Spartacus (film)|Spartacus]]'' and the game's working title was ''Caesar''.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' 55 (January 1989), p.14&lt;/ref&gt; The team Bits of Magic, who co-designed and programmed the game, included [[Nicky Robinson (game programmer)|Nicky Robinson]].

==Reception==
The PC version of ''Centurion'' received 3 out of 5 stars in ''[[Dragon (magazine)|Dragon]]''.&lt;ref name="Dragon163"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Role of Computers|last1=Lesser|last2=Lesser|last3=Lesser|first1=Hartley|first2=Patricia|first3=Kirk|journal=Dragon|issue=163|date=November 1990|pages=47–50}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other magazines, however, usually gave the game better reviews, with scores mostly in the range of 75-90%.&lt;ref&gt;[http://amr.abime.net/review_43515 The game's review chart at Amiga Magazine Rack]&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' gave it three-plus stars out of five in 1990. The magazine praised the [[Video Graphics Array|VGA]] graphics and audio, and said that as a game as opposed to an accurate historical simulation, ''Centurion'' "succeeds admirably ... those who liked those old [[sword-and-sandal|gladiator movies]]" would enjoy it.&lt;ref name="brooks199009"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1990&amp;pub=2&amp;id=74 | title=A Funny Game Happened on the Way to the Forum / Electronic Arts' Centurion: Defender of Rome | work=Computer Gaming World | date=September 1990 | accessdate=16 November 2013 | author=Brooks, M.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9727">In [[philology]], a '''commentary''' is a line-by-line or even word-by-word explication usually attached to an [[edition (book)|edition]] of a text in the same or an accompanying volume. It may draw on [[methodology|methodologies]] of [[close reading]] and [[literary criticism]], but its primary purpose is to elucidate the language of the text and the specific culture that produced it, both of which may be foreign to the reader. Such a commentary usually takes the form of [[footnote]]s, [[footnote|endnotes]], or separate text cross-referenced by line, paragraph or page.

Means of providing commentary on the language of the text include notes on [[textual criticism]], [[syntax]] and [[semantics]], and the analysis of [[rhetoric]], literary [[trope (linguistics)|tropes]], and [[stylistics (linguistics)|style]]. The aim is to remove, lessen or point out [[linguistics|linguistic]] obstacles to reading and understanding the text.

If a text is historical, or is produced within a culture assumed to be of limited familiarity to a reader, a broader range of issues may require elucidation. These include, but are by no means limited to, biographical data pertaining to the author, historical events, customs and laws, technical terminology and facts of daily life, religious beliefs and philosophical perspectives, literary allusions, geographical settings, and cross-references to related passages in the same work, other works by the author, or sources used by the author.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Cheney, "'Jog on, jog on': European Career Paths," in ''European Literary Careers: The Author from Antiquity to the Renaissance'' (University of Toronto Press, 2002), p. 6 [https://books.google.be/books?id=N8kufnGjol0C&amp;printsec=references&amp;dq=cites:ISBN+0-19-814372-9&amp;vq=%22Scribes+and+Scholars%22&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Scribes%20and%20Scholars%22&amp;f=false online.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Some commentaries from [[Classical Antiquity]] or the [[Middle Ages]] (more strictly referred to as [[scholium|scholia]]) are a valuable source of information otherwise unknown, including references to works that are now lost.  [[Jerome]] provides a list of several commentaries that were in use during his days as a student in the 350s A.D.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jerome]], ''Apology for Himself against the Books of Rufinus'' [http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/npnf203.vi.xii.html 1.16]; Alan Cameron, ''Greek Mythography in the Roman World'' (Oxford University Press, 2004), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the most used of the ancient scholia today is that of [[Maurus Servius Honoratus|Servius]] on [[Virgil|Vergil]]’s ''[[Aeneid]]'', written in the 4th century.

The production of commentaries began to flourish in the 16th century as part of the [[Renaissance humanism|humanist]] project to recover the texts of antiquity, with its related boom in publishing. In the modern era, a commentary differs from an annotated edition aimed at students or the casual reader in that it attempts to address an exhaustive range of [[scholarly method|scholarly questions]], many of which may be of concern or interest primarily to specialists. The commentator may take a position on variant readings of the text or on a point of scholarly dispute, but arguments are usually succinct, a paragraph or less than a page in length.

==Mesopotamian Commentaries==
The earliest examples, and also one of the largest corpora of text commentaries from the ancient world, comes from first-millennium-BCE Mesopotamia (modern Iraq). Known from over 860 manuscripts, the majority of which date to the period 700-100 BCE, most of these commentaries explore numerous types of texts, including literary works (such as the [[Enûma Eliš|Babylonian Epic of Creation]]), medical treatises, magical texts, ancient dictionaries, and law collections (the [[Code of Hammurabi]]). Most of them, however, comment on divination treatises, in particular treatises that predict the future from the appearance and movement of celestial bodies on the one hand ([[Enūma Anu Enlil]]), and from the appearance of a sacrificed sheep’s liver on the other ([[Bārûtu]]).

As with the majority of the thousands of texts from the [[ancient Near East]] that have survived to the present day, Mesopotamian text commentaries are written on clay tablets in [[cuneiform script]]. Text commentaries are written in the East Semitic language of [[Akkadian language|Akkadian]], but due to the influence of lexical lists written in [[Sumerian language]] on cuneiform scholarship, they often contain Sumerian words or phrases as well.

Cuneiform commentaries are important because they provide information about Mesopotamian languages and culture that are not available elsewhere in the cuneiform record. To give but one example, the pronunciation of the cryptically written name of Gilgamesh, the hero of the [[Epic of Gilgamesh]], was discovered in a cuneiform commentary on a medical text.&lt;ref&gt;BM 54595 ([http://ccp.yale.edu/P461257 ''CCP'' 4.2.R]). See T. G. Pinches, “Exit Gišṭubar!”, ''The Babylonian and Oriental Record'', vol. 4, p. 264, 1889.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the significance of cuneiform commentaries extends beyond the light they shed on specific details of Mesopotamian civilization. They open a window onto what the concerns of the Mesopotamian literate elite were when they read some of the most widely studied texts in the Mesopotamian intellectual tradition, a perspective that is important for “seeing things their way.”&lt;ref&gt;Sheldon Pollock, [http://doi.org/10.1086/599594 “Future Philology? The Fate of a Soft Science in a Hard World”, ''Critical Inquiry'' 35/4, pp. 931-961], here p. 954.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, cuneiform commentaries are also the earliest examples of textual interpretation. It has been repeatedly argued that they influenced rabbinical [[exegesis]]. See [http://ccp.yale.edu/introduction/akkadian-hebrew-exegesis Akkadian Commentaries and Early Hebrew Exegesis]

The publication and interpretation of these texts began in the mid-nineteenth century, with the discovery of the royal Assyrian libraries at Nineveh, from which ca. 454 text commentaries have been recovered. The study of cuneiform commentaries is, however, far from complete. It is the subject of on-going research by the small, international community of scholars who specialize in the field of [[Assyriology]].

'''De-categorialization''' ([[American and British English spelling differences#-ise.2C_-ize_.28-isation.2C_-ization.29|or]] '''de-categorialisation''') in [[linguistics]], refers to one of the five principles by which [[grammaticalization]] can be detected while it is taking place (according to [[Paul Hopper]]). The other four are [[Layering (linguistics)|layering]], [[Divergence (linguistics)|divergence]], [[specialization (linguistics)|specialization]], and [[persistence (linguistics)|persistence]].

De-categorialization can be described as the loss of [[morphosyntactic]] properties.

'''Enchanted Mesa''' is a sandstone [[butte]]&lt;ref&gt;Enchanted Mesa is a [[butte]], rather than a [[mesa]], because its top is less than three times its height.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Cibola County, New Mexico|Cibola County]], New Mexico, United States, about {{convert|2.5|mi|km}} northeast of the [[Acoma Pueblo|pueblo of Acoma]].  It is called '''Mesa Encantada''' in Spanish and '''Katzimo''' or '''Kadzima''' in [[Keresan languages|Keresan]].  Acoma tradition says that Enchanted Mesa was the home of the Acoma people until a severe storm and landslide destroyed the only approach.  There are no longer any ruins on the flat top.  The butte is {{convert|430|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} high, {{convert|1250|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} long and only {{convert|400|ft|m|-1|abbr=on}} ft wide, at its widest.  The elevation at the top is {{convert|6643|ft|m|0|abbr=on}}.

==History==
In 1892, when [[Charles Fletcher Lummis|Charles F. Lummis]] was visiting Acoma he listened to the old Indian governor, Martín Valle, who told the story of how the Acoma people used to live on Enchanted Mesa.&lt;ref name="Simmons"&gt;{{Cite news|author=Simmons, Marc |date=20 May 2006|title=Trail dust: The Enchanted Mesa: myth or true tale?|newspaper=The Santa Fe New Mexican|url=http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/43920.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531004304/http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/43920.html|archivedate=31 May 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their access to the top was on the southern side where a large piece of the butte was said to have spalled off and formed a ramp, a "stone ladder", up to the top. In reality, access was by climbing a ladder in a narrow fissure. Evidence of holes carved into the sandstone on either side of the fissure can be seen, located in the horseshoe shaped bowl at the southern end. . The early inhabitants had a precipitous climb up the fissure, but it assured their safety. Into these holes were placed stout lengths of wood, the 'rungs' of the ladder. Today, this is still the only means of climbing access to the top of the mesa. Their fields, and the springs that were their water source, were in the valley.  In the summer, the entire village would descend into the valley to tend the crops.  One afternoon a severe thunderstorm washed away the "stone ladder", leaving only sheer rock faces all the way around the butte. Legend has it that three old women and a young boy had been left in the village, but they could not get down, nor could anyone else get back to the village. A giant thunderbird swooped down and scooped up the four and carried them to the valley floor. The Acoma people abandoned Enchanted Mesa and moved to White Rock Mesa, now called Acoma.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Charles Fletcher Lummis|author=Lummis, Charles F.|year=1895|title=The Land of Poco Tiempo|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons|location=New York|series=reprinted in 1952 by University of New Mexico Press, Albuquerque|pages=43–44|oclc=494947}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1897, Professor [[William Libbey]] from Princeton University climbed Enchanted Mesa to disprove the existence of ruins.  His team used a cannon to shoot a rope over the end of the butte and using a pulley pulled himself up in a marine life-saving chair.  Libbey and a newspaperman climbed to the top, spent two to three hours exploring, and returned empty-handed. Libbey announced that he had seen no ruins or artifacts, saying "Romantic Indian legend can never stand the acid test of scientific investigation."&lt;ref name="Simmons" /&gt;  Self-educated archaeologist [[Frederick Webb Hodge]] did not take Libbey's word for it. On a later 1897 expedition he reported evidence of occupation.  Although the main ruins had been washed over the edge by centuries of thunderstorms, he found plenty of arrow points, stone tools, beads and pottery fragments lodged in crevices.&lt;ref name="Simmons" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Hodge, Frederick Webb|year=1897|title=The Verification of a Tradition|journal=American Anthropologist|volume=10|issue=9|pages=299&amp;ndash;302|doi=10.1525/aa.1897.10.9.02a00020 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hodge, Frederick Webb (October 1897) "Enchanted Mesa" ''National Geographic (Magazine)'' 8(9): pp.273&amp;ndash;284&lt;/ref&gt;

On 18 November 1974, an Acoma police officer indicated that he had seen a [[UFO]] over Enchanted Mesa. Over the next several days, other officers reported "a red light, faster than any aircraft".&lt;ref name="Baldridge"&gt;Baldridge, Gary (25 November 1974) "Spooky Search for UFO" ''Albuquerque Tribune'' p.F-7, col. 1&lt;/ref&gt; A helicopter was dispatched to the top with the governor of the pueblo and a police officer, but no direct evidence of a UFO was found.&lt;ref name="Baldridge" /&gt;

'''''Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two''''' (known as '''''Epic Mickey: The Power of 2''''' in Europe) is a [[platform game|platform]] video game and the sequel to ''[[Epic Mickey]]''. The game has a companion called ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]'' for the [[Nintendo 3DS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.nintendoworldreport.com/news/29649|title=Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion 3DS Game Announced|publisher=[[Nintendo World Report]]|date=March 24, 2012| accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
All has been well in Wasteland since Mickey helped defeat the Shadow Blot, with all the forgotten characters rebuilding their home. However, a series of [[earthquake]]s threatens to undo the work and the world. The [[The Mad Doctor (1933 film)|Mad Doctor]] (who somehow survived his defeat and mostly sings instead of talking) arrives and asks [[Oswald the Lucky Rabbit|Oswald]] to join forces with him to help repair Wasteland. Gus, the leader of the [[The Gremlins|Gremlins]], and Ortensia, Oswald's wife (who doesn't trust the Mad Doctor), contact [[Mickey Mouse]]. Mickey once more enters Yen Sid's workshop and takes the magic brush to aid him as he enters Wasteland. Oswald joins up with them in Dark Beauty Castle, explaining the Mad Doctor warned him of the Blotworx - Blotlings piloting mechanical suits - which have taken control of the Beetleworx production. The castle begins collapsing, forcing them to escape; Oswald retrieves his powerful remote en route.

Mickey and Oswald fight their way through Wasteland, defeating Blotlings, Beetleworx, and Blotworx (including a [[Pete's Dragon|giant robotic dragon]] in which it can be redeemed or defeated) and helping other characters. After repairing the disabled projectors, they notice one of the Gremlins named Prescott is acting strange and they follow him. This takes them to Fort Wasteland, an area that was seemly destroyed before the events of Mickey's last visit, which leads to the Floatyard, where they find he has built a massive robot designed after him. Destroying or trapping the mech, Mickey and Oswald try interrogating Prescott, only to have Animatronic Daisy Duck's news team and the Mad Doctor arrive; the doc seems to put Prescott in a hypnotic trance, making him confess to being behind the chaos which convinces everyone except for the duo. Concerned, Mickey and Oswald follow the Mad Doctor's trail to his hideout, which leads them through Autotopia, another area that was also supposedly destroyed during the Blot's revolt. After finding his diary, they learn that he wants to take all the paint to broadcast a show into the Cartoon world, so people can remember him and give him a heart to escape Wasteland and it is also revealed that he was the one who made the Blotworx who eventually turned on him and he was also the cause of the earthquakes via paint extraction devices found in Autotopia. They defeat the Mad Doctor, whose robotic body finally gives out and is either defeated or redeemed depending on which path was taken in his fight. Afterwards, the Wasteland celebrates Mickey and Oswald's triumph with a parade highlighting the duo's major choices in the game (including the three bosses).

However, the Petes of Wasteland, with Petetronic being present if Mickey and Oswald achieve the bad ending, kidnap Prescott, presumably having plans for both him and Wasteland.

==Gameplay==
Like its predecessor, ''Epic Mickey 2'' takes place in a world based on classic and retired Disney characters and attractions. Likewise, the gameplay in ''Epic Mickey 2'' closely resembles that of the original. One of the biggest updates is the addition of Oswald as a supporting character for Mickey; Oswald can either be controlled by the computer or a second player. Oswald uses a [[remote control]] in method as Mickey uses his [[paintbrush]], to attack or befriend enemy characters and to alter the environment as needed to complete tasks. Oswald also has many other abilities, such as flying with his ears, taking off his leg, using his arms as boomerangs, etc. There are also some special abilities that can only be used when Mickey and Oswald are working together. In the PlayStation 3 version of the game players are able to use motion controls using the PlayStation Move controller.

==Development==
On August 27, 2011, [[Destructoid]] posted an article that speculated that a sequel, ''Epic Mickey 2'', was in development and showed possible box art for the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/looks-like-epic-mickey-2-may-be-in-development-210015.phtml |title=Looks like Epic Mickey 2 may be in development |publisher=Destructoid |date= |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; These rumors were further encouraged when Disney France and [[Warren Spector]] invited the French media to an "epic project" taking place on March 27, 2012. Nintendo Power magazine also commented on the rumor, stating that their April 2012 issue would include a "top-secret" title preview, with the preview for the issue showing a cropped down picture of Oswald the Lucky Rabbit.

Game Trailers also stated that their March 22, 2012 episode would include a "world-exclusive preview of Warren Spector's new epic adventure" and that it would be "notably significant".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiiuvlog.com/2012/03/16/first-epic-mickey-2-trailer-coming-next-week/ |title=First Epic Mickey 2 Trailer Coming Next Week |publisher=Wii U Vlog |date=2012-03-16 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Warren Spector himself also commented on the game's development, revealing that he had "a team of over 700 people working on the sequel".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mynintendonews.com/2012/03/17/there-are-over-700-people-working-on-epic-mickey-2/ |title=There Are Over 700 People Working On Epic Mickey 2 |publisher=My Nintendo News |date=2012-03-17 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this, on March 20, 2012, the official French Nintendo magazine posted a comment on Twitter, revealing that [[Disney]] had plans to create a companion to the main sequel for the 3DS, under the name ''[[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://theparanoidgamer.com/rumour-epic-mickey-2-power-of-illusion-for-3ds/ |title=Rumour: Epic Mickey 2: Power of Illusion For 3DS |publisher=TheParanoidGamer |date=2012-03-20 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warren Spector, on March 21, 2012, officially confirmed the rumors, revealing the sequel's title to be ''Epic Mickey: Power of Two''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.videogamer.com/wii/disney_epic_mickey/news/disney_epic_mickey_2_confirmed_for_wii_xbox_360_and_ps3.html |title=Disney Epic Mickey 2 confirmed for Wii, Xbox 360 and PS3 - Disney Epic Mickey for Wii News |publisher=Videogamer.com |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spector also directly addressed the camera issues that reviewers criticized in the first game, stating that "They'll be working on it until the day we ship the second game. (There have been) over 1,000 specific changes made to the camera. Our goal is that you will not have to touch the manual camera controls even once to play through the main story path of this game."

Spector also revealed that the game was to include voice acting and musical numbers, both of which were absent in the first game. Spector said: "I'm such a geek about musicals, I love the co-op and next-gen stuff, but for me, when a character breaks into song, which they do on a regular basis in this game, it's magic."

Spector also commented on the sequel's co-op features, stating that: "It's drop-in, drop-out co-op, you can sit down at any time with a friend who is playing as Mickey, and you can take control of Oswald. If you're playing as a single player, Oswald will be there every second of the game. He's not just a multiplayer character, he's a helper, whether you're playing alone or with a friend or family member." Wasteland itself will feature old areas ruined by earthquakes and other natural disasters, as well as new areas such as Disney Gulch, based on Disneyland's [[Frontierland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=HigherLevel |url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2012/03/21/epic-mickey-2-the-power-of-two-announced.aspx/ |title=Epic Mickey 2: The Power Of Two Announced - News |publisher=www.GameInformer.com |date=2012-03-21 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

12 screenshots for the game were released on October 4, 2012. Fans long speculated that the recently located Oswald cartoon ''Hungry Hobos'' (1928) would appear as an unlockable, but the final game included the Silly Symphony ''Skeleton Dance'' (1929) instead.

On March 18, 2013, the UK division of Disney Movie's announced via Twitter that Disney's ''Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two'' would be receiving a port to Sony's [[PlayStation Vita]] platform. The Vita version will be developed by Blitz Game Studios (in collaboration with [[Sony Computer Entertainment]]), which has already dealt with the [[PlayStation 3]] and [[Xbox 360]] version of the game. Was announced that this version will be optimized especially for the Vita and that the defects of the original version will be placed, in particular the frame-rate and artificial intelligence. Furthermore, boasts of a co-op online or ad-hoc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2013/03/18/disney-epic-mickey-2-the-power-of-two-coming-soon-to-ps-vita/ |title=Disney Epic Mickey 2 coming soon to PSVita |publisher=PlayStation Blog UK |date=2013-03-18 |accessdate=2013-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2013, the previously cancelled PC port of Epic Mickey 2 was given a limited release in Central European countries such as Poland and the Czech Republic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.cz/articles/2013-10-04-dobre-rano-s-eurogamerem-patek-4-rijna |title=Dobré ráno s Eurogamerem - pátek, 4. října |publisher=Eurogamer Czech Republic |date=2013-10-04 |accessdate=2014-09-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese magazine [[Famitsu]] confirmed that the game would arrive in Japan exclusively on Nintendo's consoles on September 26, 2013. The [[Nintendo 3DS]] sister title [[Epic Mickey: Power of Illusion|''Power of Illusion'']] (renamed as ''Mickey’s Marvelous Adventure'') would arrive with ''The Power of Two'' on the same day in Japan. Unlike the previous title ''[[Epic Mickey]]'', ''Epic Mickey 2'' was published by Spike Chunsoft in Japan.&lt;ref name="JPrelease"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siliconera.com/2013/06/19/epic-mickey-2-is-a-nintendo-exclusive-in-japan/ |title=Epic Mickey 2 Is A Nintendo Exclusive In Japan |publisher=Siliconera |author=Spencer |date=2013-06-19 |accessdate=2013-06-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 6, 2014, ''Epic Mickey 2'' was made available on [[Steam (software)|Steam]].

''Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two'' received mixed reviews, with most complaints being the game not fixing issues that were present in the original. Aggregating review websites [[GameRankings]] and [[Metacritic]] gave the Wii version 67.60% and 64/100,&lt;ref name=GRWII/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCWII/&gt; the Xbox 360 version 60.80% and 59/100&lt;ref name=GRX360/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCX360/&gt; the PlayStation 3 version 57.83% and 59/100,&lt;ref name=GRPS3/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCPS3/&gt; the Wii U version 55.42% and 57/100,&lt;ref name=GRWIIU/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCWIIU/&gt; and the PlayStation Vita version 51.50% and 57/100.&lt;ref name=GRVITA/&gt;&lt;ref name=MCVITA/&gt;

===Sales===
By the end of 2012, ''Epic Mickey 2'' sold 529,000 copies in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.joystiq.com/2013/01/29/epic-mickey-2-sales-at-529-in-us/|title=Disney Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two life-to-date sales 529K in US|last=Sliwinski|first=Alexander|date=January 29, 2013|publisher=Joystiq|accessdate=29 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the end of 2010, its predecessor had sold at least 1.3 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2013/01/16/epic-mickey-2-the-power-of-two-only-sold-270k-units-in-the-us/ |title=Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two only sold 270k copies in the US |publisher=VG247 |date=2013-01-16 |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a recent interview, Warren Spector stated that he was 'in doubt' about the future of the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-17-epic-mickey-2s-sales-were-less-than-epic/ |accessdate=January 17, 2013 |title=Epic Mickey's Future |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130118121921/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-01-17-epic-mickey-2s-sales-were-less-than-epic |archivedate=January 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite heavy advertising and due to gameplay criticism, the game barely sold a quarter of the copies the original did, making it a commercial bomb (its sales were scoped at around 2 million), despite being available on multiple platforms. Following these financial losses, Disney made an official statement on January 29, 2013 that Junction Point Studios was to be closed in order to direct resources to other projects. It is revealed that Disney still owns the ''Epic Mickey'' [[Intellectual property|IP]], but has no plan for the series.&lt;ref name="gamesradar.com"&gt;{{cite web|author=Connor Sheridan on January 29, 2013 |url=http://www.gamesradar.com/epic-mickey-developer-junction-point-shuts-down/ |title=Epic Mickey developer Junction Point shuts down |publisher=GamesRadar |date=2013-01-29 |accessdate=2013-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, concept art was leaked of a cancelled kart racer based on the Epic Mickey franchise, named Epic Mickey Racers, which was to include a number of other playable characters from Disney's legacy including Scrooge McDuck and Cruella De Vil as well as Mickey Mouse and Oswald the Rabbit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mynintendonews.com/2016/08/21/disney-cancelled-an-epic-mickey-racing-spin-off/|title=Disney Cancelled An Epic Mickey Racing Spin-Off|date=August 21, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planned sequel==
A sequel titled ''Epic Mickey 3'' was originally intended to be the third and final part of the ''[[Epic Mickey]]'' trilogy. Due to the poor sales of ''Epic Mickey 2'', [[Junction Point Studios]] closed on January 29, 2013, therefore canceling production on ''Epic Mickey 3''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.digitalspy.com/gaming/news/a376874/epic-mickey-planned-as-three-games-by-warren-spector/|title='Epic Mickey' planned as three games|date=April 17, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nintendolife.com/news/2012/12/warren_spector_hints_at_epic_mickey_3|title=Warren Spector Hints At Epic Mickey 3|first=Nintendo|last=Life|date=December 16, 2012|publisher=|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/05/01/spector-puts-down-rumours-of-troubled-epic-mickey-development/|title=Spector puts down rumours of troubled Epic Mickey development|publisher=|accessdate=February 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also one of the very last games to be published by Disney Interactive Studios before it closed in May 2016.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2939">'''Fescennine Verses''' ('''Fescennina carmina'''), one of the earliest kinds of [[Italian language|Italian]] [[poetry]], subsequently developed into [[satire]] and [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] comic drama.

==History==
Originally sung at village harvest-home rejoicing, they made their way into the towns, and became the fashion at religious festivals and private gatherings, especially [[wedding]]s, to which in later times they were practically restricted. They were usually in the [[Saturnian (poetry)|Saturnine metre]] and took the form of a dialogue consisting of an interchange of extemporaneous raillery. Those who took part in them wore masks made of the bark of trees. At first harmless and good-humored, if somewhat coarse, these songs gradually outstripped the bounds of decency; malicious attacks were made upon both gods and men, and the matter became so serious that the law intervened and scurrilous personalities were forbidden by the Twelve Tables ([[Cicero]], ''De re publica'', 4.10; see also [[Horace]] ''epist''. 2.1.139).

==Examples==
Specimens of the Fescennines used at weddings are the ''Epithalamium of Manlius'' ([[Catullus]] 61) and the four poems of [[Claudian]] in honor of the marriage of Honorius and Maria; the first, however, is distinguished by a licentiousness which is absent in the latter. [[Ausonius]] in his ''Cento nuptialis'' mentions the Fescennines of [[Annianus Faliscus]], who lived in the time of [[Hadrian]].

==Etymology==
Various derivations have been proposed for the word "Fescennine." According to [[Sextus Pompeius Festus|Festus]], they were introduced from [[Fescennia]] in [[Etruria]], but there is no reason to assume that any particular town was specially devoted to the use of such songs. As an alternative Festus suggests a connection with ''[[fascinus]]'', the Latin word referring to a phallus-shaped amulet used to ward off the evil eye, either because the Fescennina were regarded as a protection against evil influences (see Munro, ''Criticisms and Elucidations of Catullus'', p.&amp;nbsp;76) or because the phallus, as the symbol of [[fertility]], would from early times have been naturally associated with [[harvest festival]]s. H. Nettleship, in an article on ''The Earliest Italian Literature'' (''Journal of Philology'', xi. 1882), in support of Munro's view, translates the expression "verses used by charmers", assuming a noun ''fescennus'', connected with ''fas fari''.

'''Xuan Kong Flying Star feng shui''' or ''Xuan Kong Fei Xing''&lt;ref&gt;Heluo (1999). [http://www.heluo.nl/articles/HowToFindFacingAndSittingInFengShui.pdf How to find facing and sitting in feng shui.]&lt;/ref&gt; is one of disciplines in [[Feng Shui]], and is an integration of the principles of [[Yin Yang]], the interactions between the five elements, the eight trigrams, the [[Lo Shu]] numbers, and the [[24 Mountains]], by using time, space and objects&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Your Ultimate Book in Feng Shui.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt; to create an astrological chart to analyze positive auras and negative auras of a building.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Introduction_to_Flying_Stars.html 8-White Star Feng Shui: Introduction to Flying Stars.]&lt;/ref&gt;

These include analyzing wealth, mental and physiological states, success, relationships with external parties, and health of the inhabitant.&lt;ref&gt;Jamilin (2007). [http://www.jamilin.com/Free_Feng_Shui/Articles/Flying_Star_Feng_Shui/ Flying Stars Feng Shui.]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Qing Dynasty]], it was popularized by a grandmaster [[Shen Zhu Ren]], with the book that he wrote called '''Mr. Shen's Study of Xuan Kong''', or ''Shen Shi Xuan Kong Xue''.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Introduction_to_Flying_Stars.html 8-White Star Feng Shui: Introduction to Flying Stars.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Flying Star Feng Shui does not limit itself to buildings for the living or ''Yang Zhai'', where rules pertaining to directions equally apply to all built structures; it also applies to grave sites and buildings for spirits or ''Yin Zhai''.&lt;ref&gt;Heluo (1999). [http://www.heluo.nl/articles/HowToFindFacingAndSittingInFengShui.pdf 8-White Star Feng Shui: How to find facing and sitting in Feng Shui.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Your Ultimate Book in Feng Shui.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 3–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==

===Numbers===
[[File:Magic Square Lo Shu.svg|thumb|right|Modern representation of the ''Lo Shu'' square as a [[magic square]]]]

In the [[Lo Shu Square]], flying stars are nine numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Allen Tsai  (2009). [http://www.chineseastrologyonline.com/pwbasic.htm The Background of the Purple White Flying Stars.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Each number in the Lo Shu represents one of the Chinese [[Trigram]]s and is related to an Element, Family Member, [[Cardinal direction|Cardinal]], Colour, Hour, Season, [[Organ (anatomy)|Organ]], Ailments and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Feng Shui Design Consultancy  (2008-09). [http://www.feng-shui-design-consultancy.com/chinese-magic-square.html Chinese Magic Square.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Your Ultimate Book in Feng Shui.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

The numbers always move to the lower right (northwest), middle right (west), lower left (northeast), upper center (south), lower center (north), upper right (southwest), middle left (east), upper left (southeast) and back to the center.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Plotting_the_Stars_1.html Plotting a Flying Star.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Time===

[[Time]] is divided into 20-Year cycles. Each cycle of 20 years is a Period or "Yun". A grand cycle comprises 9 Periods in total which covers a span of 180 years.&lt;ref&gt;Joey Yap (2005). [http://joeyyap.com/fengshui/article.asp?ArID=11 Hoo Hah About Period 8 .]&lt;/ref&gt;

Periods are used to describe the cyclical pattern of [[Qi]]. Different types of Qi have different strengths and weaknesses with the reference to a particular Period.&lt;ref&gt;Heluo (1999). [http://www.heluo.nl/articles/HowToBuildYourFlyingStarChart.pdf How to build your flying star chart.]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Timely and Untimely Flying Stars====

A timely star is positive for a building whereas untimely star is negative. For the current period, ''Period 8'' (Year 2004–2023), stars ''Eight'', ''Nine'' and ''One'' are timely (For a building, they are timely if and only if the object placed in that palace is timely). Star ''Eight'' is most timely which is often treated as Prosperous and Noble Star. Star ''Nine'' and Star ''One'' belong to ''Sheng Qi'', a growing [[energy]]. The other six stars are regarded as having retreating, killing or dead ''qi''.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng Xiao Wen (2005). [http://joeyyap.com/fengshui/article.asp?ArID=42 Help! My flying star chart doesn’t work.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerby Kuek. ''Power of Feng Shui.'' Ming Pao Publications (2009) 16-18.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen Feng Mou. ''Xuan Kong Feng Shui Tan Jiu.'' Wu Ling (2005) 22-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Space===

An accurate measurement of direction must be obtained before any system of [[Feng Shui]] can be undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Taking_Directions.html 8-White Star Feng Shui: Taking Directions.]&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Luopan]] is a magnetic compass to determine the precise direction of a structure or an item.

====24 Mountains====
The most important ring on the [[Luopan]] is the 24 Mountain ring.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/The_Luo_Pan_and_the_24_Mountains.html 8-White Star Feng Shui: 24 Mountains.]&lt;/ref&gt;

On the 24 Mountain ring, each direction is subdivided into three sectors.

====Taking Directions====

Using the principles of [[Yin and Yang]], the facing of a building is determined by the side of the built structure that receives most ''Yang Qi''.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Your Ultimate Book in Feng Shui.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Jiu Xing Feng Shui Xue.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 25.&lt;/ref&gt;

A house is constructed with an architectural frontage with its side that faces whatever landscape feature. The facing of that house is considered by the direction of its frontage which is most ''Yang'' in nature.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Jiu Xing Feng Shui Xue.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In apartments, or condominiums, the facing of a unit is determined by the facing of the entire building. If the structure is not an obvious facade, the facing of the unit is determined by the side of the building having the most ''Yang'' energy (faces the busiest crowd flow).

====Taking locations====

Energy in a building can be tapped into by locating a person within a sector that houses the energy. Ideally, living objects should be located in a sector with positive [[Qi]] as determined by Flying Star Chart.&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Direction_vs_Location.html 8-White Star Feng Shui: Direction vs Location.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The layout of a building is demarcated with a '''Nine Palace''' grid, which looks like a ''tic-tac-toe grid''. A door, room or other object's location refers to the square within this grid where the object is found. This may or may not correspond to the direction that the object faces. A door could be located in the southwest sector, but face south. Its location could be also southwest, and its direction to be facing to the south.

===Objects===

Objects are essential to evaluate the [[Feng Shui]] of a building.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Jiu Xing Feng Shui Xue.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhao Jiufeng. ''Di Li Wu Jie.'' Wu Ling (2004) 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chen Feng Mou. ''Xuan Kong Feng Shui Tan Jiu.'' Wu Ling (2005) 22-30.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mountain====
[[Image:City of London.jpg|thumb|Skyscrapers and apartments are mountains.]]
Mountain generates [[Qi]]. A lush and green mountain or hill generates auspicious Qi, while a barren, rocky rising area will, in general, generate inauspicious energy.&lt;ref&gt;Kerby Kuek. ''Power of Feng Shui.'' Ming Pao Publications (2009) 24.&lt;/ref&gt;

In urban areas, skyscrapers, apartments or any structure that rises from the ground have a similar role to a mountain: generating energy outside. From inside, cupboards, wardrobes, or any furniture that is taller or larger than any others nearby are also considered mountains.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Xue Feng Shui De Di Yi Ben Shu.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2004) 10-14.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Water====
[[Image:Tokyo EXP way.JPG|thumb|Highways and roads are forms of water in Feng Shui.]]

Water conducts [[Qi]]. It is essential to identify the cleanliness of the water, the location and the flow of the water formation. These include ponds, lakes, rivers, drains and fountains.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Fa Da Feng Shui Xue.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2007) 20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerby Kuek. ''Power of Feng Shui.'' Ming Pao Publications (2009) 28.&lt;/ref&gt;

In urban areas, highways and lowland play a similar role to waterways, conducting Qi. Inside a building or a room, spinning fan or anything  lower than ground level is considered water.&lt;ref&gt;Chen Feng Mou. ''Xuan Kong Feng Shui Tan Jiu.'' Wu Ling (2005) 34-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nine-Palace Flying Stars==

'''Nine Palace Flying Stars''' or ''Jiu Gong Fei Xing'' is another name of Flying Stars method whereby palaces are the nine sectors overlaid onto a layout of the house.&lt;ref&gt;Zeng Xiao Wen (2005). [http://joeyyap.com/fengshui/article.asp?ArID=42 Help! My flying star chart doesn’t work.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Flying Star Chart===

A '''Flying Star chart''' consists of three numbers in each Palace of the [[Luo Shu]]. These numbers are called the '''Base Star''', the '''Facing Star''' and the '''Sitting Star'''.

Constructing a Flying Star Chart requires
- The dates that the building was occupied by the owners
- The facing of the building&lt;ref&gt;Chad Dunham (1998). [http://www.8whitestarfengshui.com/Plotting_the_Stars_1.html Plotting a Flying Star.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Ju Ming Shuo Fa.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2004) 25-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, if a building is constructed in the year 2003, but the residents do not move in until February 4 of 2004, the Period of the building is 8, not 7.

Period does not change again unless there is major renovation undertaken to the structure.&lt;ref&gt;Li Kui-Ming. ''Xue Feng Shui De Di Yi Ben Shu.'' Ju Ming Zheng Tang (2004) 15.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rules and Procedures===

Creating a ''Flying Star chart'' is always begun with the Base Star. Period of the building determines the number occupies the Base Star position of the ''Central Palace''. Base Stars always fly in the [[Luo Shu]] path.

[[Image:FlyingStarChartA.jpg|thumb|left|Constructing a flying star chart.]]

Once all the base stars are distributed amongst the nine palaces, the number in Facing Palace on the Luo Shu grid is determined by the facing direction of the building. This number is the facing star.

The ''Sitting Palace'' is always opposite of the ''Facing Palace''. The sitting star is the number in the sitting palace.

For instance, in a Period-8 building that faces southwest, the number that locates in Facing Palace is number 5 whereas the number in Sitting Palace is number 2; thus, 5 is Facing Star and 2 is Sitting Star.

Unlike the Base Star, the Facing Star and Sitting Star can fly in either ascending (''Yang'') order, or descending (''Yin'') order. The order depends upon two factors on 
1 Whether the star is an even number or an odd number, and 
2 Which the mountain that the unit faces.

Even-numbered Stars follow a ''Yin-Yang-Yang'' form. In a certain number which comprises three mountains, should the mountain that the property faces is ''Yang'', then the numbers fly in ascending order of [[Lo Shu]] path, and vice versa.

Odd-numbered Stars follow a ''Yang-Yin-Yin'' form. In a certain number which comprises three mountains, should the mountain that the property faces is ''Yang'', then the numbers fly in ascending order of Lo Shu path, and vice versa.

To determine the polarity of number 5 star, go by the polarity of the Period number.

==Properties of Nine Stars==

===Timely and Untimely===
Flying stars can be timely or untimely. The nature of flying star depends on which period is to be referred and which star is being activated.&lt;ref&gt;Fushantang (1998). [http://www.fushantang.com/1007/1007-1/g2106.html Xuan Kong Fei Xing.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Chemistry of Flying Stars==

According to [[I-Ching]], south direction belongs to fire. However, in a building, the south sector may not a fire. The nature of a palace depends on combination among elements of the ''base star'', of the ''sitting star'', of the ''facing star'' and of the ''Heaven Trigram''.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu zuxia ''Feixing Feng Shui Xue.'' Zhu Zuxia Training Centre (2009) 20-35.&lt;/ref&gt;

For example, a house that faces bearing 337.6 - 352.5 was built in 2001, and was occupied by residents in 2006.

Period of the house: Period 8, since 2006 is the year of occupying

Facing: Ren mountain in North direction, bearing 337.6 - 352.5

Sitting: Bing mountain in South direction, opposite of the facing

===Timely Flying Star===

Timely flying star is a catalyst to the phase combination of ''Sitting Star'', ''Facing Star'', ''Base Star'' and ''Heavenly Trigram'', implying whether to boost the current aura to best or to the opposite.&lt;ref&gt;Zhu zuxia ''Feixing Feng Shui Xue.'' Zhu Zuxia Training Centre (2009) 36-40.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, annual Star 1 (Water) has the ability to combat the competition of metallic stars 6 and 7.

====Annual and Monthly Flying Stars====

In [[Sexagenary cycle]], a new Chinese year begins on start of spring, which usually falls on February 4. The annual flying star that visits the center palace has to be subtracted by one every Chinese year. Once ''Star 1'' is reached, annual star would loop back around to 9 in next year. 

''Star 1'' occupies center palace in 1999, 2008, 2017 and so on.

Annual and monthly stars always follow Lo Shu path.

Daily Flying Stars are governed by,&lt;ref&gt;Zhu zuxia ''Feixing Feng Shui Xue.'' Zhu Zuxia Training Centre (2009) 41.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;HC Hung (2008). [http://www.absolutelyfengshui.com/library/daily-flying-stars.php Daily Flying Stars.]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RULE 1:''' From the onset of [[Winter Solstice]] until [[Summer Solstice]] in the following year, the daily stars progress in '''ascending order''' (... 7,8,9,1, 2, 3, ...). The stars are distributed around the nine palaces following [[Lo Shu]] path.

On the very first '''Yang Wood [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]]''' day or ''Jia-zi'' day after Winter Solstice, daily ''Star 1'' presides the center palace.

'''RULE 2:''' From the onset of Summer Solstice until the next Winter Solstice, the daily stars progress in a '''descending order''' (... 3,2,1,9,8,7,...). The stars are distributed around the nine palaces fleeing Lo Shu path.

On the very first '''Yang Wood [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]]''' day or ''Jia-zi'' day after Summer Solstice, daily ''Star 9'' presides the center palace.

====Bihourly Flying Star====

Bi-hourly Flying Stars are ruled by,&lt;ref&gt;Zhu zuxia ''Feixing Feng Shui Xue.'' Zhu Zuxia Training Centre (2009) 43.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''RULE 1:''' From the onset of [[Winter Solstice]] until [[Summer Solstice]] in the following year, the bi-hourly stars are distributed around the nine palaces following [[Lo Shu]] path. The stars progress in '''ascending order''' every bi-hourly.

On [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]], [[Rabbit (zodiac)|Rabbit]], [[Horse (zodiac)|Horse]], and [[Rooster (zodiac)|Rooster]] days, ''star 1'' occupies the center sector at [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]] hour (11 pm of previous day – 1 am). On [[Ox (zodiac)|Ox]], [[Dragon (zodiac)|Dragon]], [[Goat (zodiac)|Goat]], and [[Dog (zodiac)|Dog]] days, ''star 4'' occupies the center sector at [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]] hour. On [[Tiger (zodiac)|Tiger]], [[Snake (zodiac)|Snake]], [[Monkey (zodiac)|Monkey]], [[Pig (zodiac)|Pig]] days, ''star 7'' occupies the center sector at [[Rat (zodiac)|Rat]] hour.

'''RULE 2:''' From the onset of Summer Solstice until next Winter Solstice, the bi-hourly stars are distributed around the nine palaces fleeing Lo Shu path. The stars progress in '''descending order''' every bi-hourly.

'''Goulash''' ({{lang-hu|gulyás}} {{IPA-hu|ˈɡujaːʃ|}}) is a [[stew]] of [[meat]], usually seasoned with [[paprika]] and other spices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karoly |last=Gundel |title=Gundel's Hungarian cookbook |publisher=Corvina |location=Budapest |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=963-13-3600-X |oclc=32227400}}page 20&lt;/ref&gt; Originating from the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary|Hungary]], goulash is a popular meal predominantly eaten in [[Central Europe]] but also in other parts of Europe.

Its origin traces back to the 9th century to stews eaten by Hungarian shepherds.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; Back then, the cooked and flavored meat was dried with the help of the sun and packed into bags produced from sheep's stomachs, needing only water to make it into a meal.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Pf6cAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA356 Bulgaria, Hungary, Poland, Romania, the Czech Republic, and Slovakia], Britannica Educational Publishing, 2013, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier versions of goulash did not include [[paprika]], as it was not introduced to the [[Old World]] until the 16th century. It is one of the [[national dish]]es of [[Hungary]] and a symbol of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Gil Marks, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ojc4Uker_V0C&amp;pg=PA234 Encyclopedia of Jewish Food], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2010, p. 234&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="away.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://away.com/feature/excerpt/national-geographic/top-ten-great-national-dishes-1.html?page=1|title=Orbitz Travel: Vacations, Cheap Flights, Airline Tickets &amp; Airfares|website=away.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The name originates from the [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] "''gulyás''" {{IPA-hu|ˈɡujaːʃ||hu-gulyás.ogg}}. The word "''gulya''" means "''herd of cattle''" in Hungarian, and "[[Gulyás (herdsman)|''gulyás'']]" means "''herdsman''" or "cowboy".&lt;ref&gt;William White, [https://books.google.com/books?ei=QkOTTprbBdPA8QOe8OgY&amp;ct=result&amp;id=7GcEAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=Gulyas+herd&amp;q=Gulya#search_anchor Notes and queries, Volume 126], Oxford University Press, 1912&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith Petres Balogh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ne4-6gFVrmsC&amp;pg=PA244 This Old House by the Lake], Trafford Publishing, 2006, p. 244&lt;/ref&gt;

The word gulyás originally meant only "herdsman", but over time the dish became gulyáshús (goulash meat) – that is to say, a meat dish which was prepared by herdsmen. Also in medieval times the Hungarian herdsman of [[Central Europe]] made use of every possible part of the animal, as was common practice. As meat was scarce, nearly all of the animal was often used to make the soup; even part of the hide that provided foot protection was considered a necessity. Today, gulyás refers both to the herdsmen, and to the soup. From the Middle Ages until well into the 19th century, the [[Puszta]] was the home of massive herds of cattle. They were driven, in their tens of thousands, to Europe’s biggest cattle markets in Moravia, Vienna, [[Nuremberg]] and Venice. The herdsmen made sure that there were always some cattle that had to be slaughtered along the way, the flesh of which provided them with gulyáshús.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smithsonianmag.com/travel/goulash-origins-food-history-atlas-of-eating-soup-smithsonian-journeys-travel-quarterly-danube-180958690/|title=The Humble Beginnings of Goulash|date=Apr 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anikó Gergely, Culinaria Hungary [https://books.google.com/books?id=V8tPNQAACAAJ&amp;dq=culinaria+hungary&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=K2gYCUEgLm&amp;sig=5aZEktfXprju0TJDcDuT9l8MqEQ&amp;hl=hu&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=syJkUKz4LsmztAaBrYGwBA&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwAA], H.f. Ullmann, 2008.10.15. - p. 318&lt;/ref&gt;

==In Hungary==

===''Gulyás''===
{{Main|Gulyásleves}}
In [[Cuisine of Hungary|Hungarian cuisine]], traditional "''Gulyásleves''" (literally "''goulash soup''"), "''bográcsgulyás''",&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Gundel's Hungarian Cookbook, Karoly Gundel.&lt;/ref&gt; [[pörkölt]], and [[paprikás]]  were thick stews made by cattle herders and stockmen.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; [[Garlic]], [[caraway seed]], [[bell pepper]], and [[wine]] are optional. These dishes can be made as soups rather than stews. Excepting paprikás, the Hungarian stews do not rely on a [[flour]] or [[roux]] for [[thickening agent|thickening]].
[[Tomato]] is a modern addition, totally unknown in the original recipe and in the whole Central European food culture until the first half of the twentieth century.
Goulash is as well a fundamental part of [[Slovak_cuisine#Soups_and_sauces|Slovak cuisine]], where is prepared in several different tastes too, mainly the same ones of Hungarian cuisine. [[Slovakia]] was an important part of the [[Kingdom of Hungary]] for several centuries, and the two cuisines have many common recipes.

Goulash can be prepared from beef, veal,&lt;ref&gt;[http://recipes.grocceni.com/vealgoulash.html Famous Hungarian recipes] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090114120209/http://recipes.grocceni.com/vealgoulash.html |date=14 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; pork, or lamb.  Typical cuts include the [[Shank (meat)|shank]], [[shin (meat)|shin]], or [[shoulder (meat)|shoulder]]; as a result, goulash derives its thickness from tough, well-exercised muscles rich in [[collagen]], which is converted to [[gelatin]] during the cooking process. Meat is cut into chunks, seasoned with [[salt]], and then [[Maillard reaction|browned]] with sliced [[onion]] in a pot with oil or lard. [[Paprika]] is added, along with [[water]] or [[Stock (food)|stock]], and the goulash is left to simmer. After cooking a while, garlic, whole or ground [[caraway seed]], or soup vegetables like [[carrot]], [[parsley root]], peppers (green or bell pepper) and [[celery]] may be added. Other herbs and spices could also be added, especially [[chili pepper]], [[bay leaf]] and [[thyme]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Diced [[potato]]es may be added, since they provide [[starch]] as they cook, which makes the goulash thicker and smoother. However, chili peppers and potatoes are post-16th century additions, unknown in the original recipe. A small amount of white wine or wine [[vinegar]] may also be added near the end of cooking to round the taste. Goulash may be served with small egg noodles called ''[[Spätzle|csipetke]]''. The name ''Csipetke'' comes from pinching small, [[fingernail]]-sized bits out of the dough (''csipet'' =pinch) before adding them to the boiling soup.

The Hungarian cook Karoly Gundel claims that in a goulash recipe, meat should not be mixed with any grains or with potatoes, so if potatoes or noodles are used, the meat should be omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karoly |last=Gundel |title=Gundel's Hungarian cookbook |publisher=Corvina |location=Budapest |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=963-13-3600-X |oclc=32227400}}page 31&lt;/ref&gt; Given the large number of goulash variants, however, this dictum is dubious.

===Hungarian varieties===
Hungarian goulash variations include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Karoly |last=Gundel |title=Gundel's Hungarian cookbook |publisher=Corvina |location=Budapest |year=1992 |pages= |isbn=963-13-3600-X |oclc=32227400}}page 21&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Székely Gulyás''. Reduce the potatoes and add [[sauerkraut]] and [[sour cream]].
* ''Gulyás Hungarian Plain Style''. Omit the homemade soup pasta (''csipetke'') and add vegetables.
* ''Mock Gulyás''. Substitute beef bones for the meat and add vegetables. Also called ''Hamisgulyás'', (Fake Goulash)
* ''Bean Gulyás''. Omit the potatoes and the caraway seeds. Use kidney beans instead.
* ''Csángó Gulyás''. Add [[sauerkraut]] instead of pasta and potatoes.
* ''Betyár Gulyás''. Use smoked beef or smoked pork for meat.
* ''Likócsi Pork Gulyás''. Use pork and thin  [[vermicelli]] in the goulash instead of potato and soup pasta. Flavour with lemon juice.
* ''Mutton Gulyás'' or ''Birkagulyás''. Made with [[mutton]]. Add red wine for flavour.
A thicker and richer goulash, similar to a stew, originally made with three kinds of meat, is called ''Székely gulyás'', named after the Hungarian writer, journalist and archivist József Székely (1825–1895).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

===''Paprikás krumpli''===
"Paprikás krumpli" is a traditional paprika-based potato stew with diced potatoes, onion, bell peppers, ground paprika and some bacon or sliced spicy sausage, like the smoked [[Debrecener]], in lieu of beef.

In German-speaking countries this inexpensive peasant stew is made with sausage and known as Kartoffelgulasch ("potato goulash").

==Outside Hungary==
Thick stews similar to ''pörkölt'' and the original cattlemen stew are popular throughout almost all the former [[Austrian-Hungarian Empire]], from [[Northeast Italy]] to the [[Carpathians]]. Like ''pörkölt,'' these stews are generally served with boiled or [[mashed potato]], [[polenta]], [[dumpling]]s (e.g. ''[[Spätzle|nokedli]]'', or ''[[Halušky|galuska]]''), [[spätzle]] or, alternatively, as a stand-alone dish with [[bread]].

===Austria===
In Vienna, the former center of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]], a special kind of goulash had been developed. The ''Wiener Saftgulasch'' or the ''Fiakergulasch'' on the menu in traditional restaurants is a rich ''[[pörkölt]]''-like stew; more onions but no tomatoes or other vegetables are used, and it usually comes just with dark bread. A variation of the ''Wiener Saftgulasch'' is the ''Fiakergulasch'', which is served with fried egg, fried sausage, and dumplings named ''[[Knödel|Semmelknödel]]''.

===Croatia===
Goulash ({{lang-hr|gulaš}}) is also very popular in most parts of [[Croatia]], especially north ([[Hrvatsko Zagorje]]) and [[Lika]]. It is considered to be part of traditional [[cuisine]]. In [[Gorski Kotar]] and [[Lika]], deer and boar frequently replace beef (''lovački gulaš''). There is also a kind of goulash with [[Boletus edulis|porcini]] mushrooms (''gulaš od vrganja''). Bacon is an important ingredient.

Gulaš is often served with [[fuži]], [[gnocchi|njoki]], [[polenta]] or [[pasta]]. In [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bosnian language|Bosnian]] and [[Serbian language|Serbian]] is augmented with vegetables. Green and red bell peppers and carrots are most commonly used. Sometimes one or more other kinds of meat are added, e.g., pork loin, bacon, or mutton. In [[Slovenia]], they are known as ''perkelt,'' but are often referred to as "goulash" or a similar name.

===Czech Republic and Slovakia===
[[File:Goulash in Prague.jpg|thumb|right|Goulash in [[Prague]], [[Czech Republic]]]]
In the Czech and Slovak Republics, goulash ([[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: ''guláš'') is usually made with beef, although pork varieties exist, and served with [[Knödel|bread dumplings]] (goulash with beef in Czech ''hovězí guláš s knedlíkem'', in Slovak ''hovädzí guláš s knedľou''), in Slovakia more typically with bread. In pubs it is often garnished with slices of fresh onion, and is typically accompanied by beer. Beer can be also added to the stew in the process of cooking. Seasonal varieties of goulash include venison or wild boar goulashes. Another popular variant of ''guláš'' is ''segedínský guláš'' (''[[Szeged]] goulash''), with [[sauerkraut]]. 

In Czech and Slovak slang, the word ''guláš'' means "mishmash", typically used as ''mít v tom guláš'': to be disoriented or to lack understanding of something.

===Germany===
[[Image:German goulash soup.jpg|thumb|German goulash soup]]

German ''Gulasch'' is either a beef (''Rindergulasch''), pork (''Schweinegulasch''), venison (''Hirschgulasch''), or wild boar (''Wildschweingulasch'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chefkoch.de/rs/s0o8/gulasch/Rezepte.html|title=Gulasch Rezepte - Chefkoch.de|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; stew that may include red wine and is usually served with potatoes (in the north), white rice or spirelli noodles (mostly in [[Cafeteria|canteens]]), and dumplings (in the south). ''Gulaschsuppe'' (goulash soup) is the same concept served as a soup, usually with pieces of white bread.

===Italy===
Goulash in Italy is eaten in the region of [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]] and the autonomous region of [[Trentino-Alto Adige/Südtirol]], regions that had been part of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and still are in part culturally and linguistically Austrian. Here it is eaten as a regular Sunday dish.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} It can also, although less typically so, be found in the nearby [[Veneto]].  An interesting regional recipe comes from the [[Pustertal]] (Val Pusteria, Puster Valley) in [[South Tyrol]]. It is made of beef and red wine, and seasoned with rosemary, red paprika, bay leaf, marjoram and lemon zest, served with crusty white bread or polenta. The lemon gives its signature flavor. Goulash is also quite popular in the city of [[Ancona]], which is culturally quite near to eastern Europe.

===Poland===
In [[Poland]], goulash ({{lang-pl|gulasz}}) is popular and eaten in most parts of the country. A variant dish exists that is similar to Hungarian [[pörkölt]]. It came to being around the 9th century. It is usually served with various forms of noodles and dumplings, such as [[Pyzy (dish)|pyzy]].

===Serbia===
In [[Serbia]], goulash (Serbian: гулаш) is eaten in most parts of the country, especially in Vojvodina, where it was probably introduced by the Hungarian minority. It is actually a pörkölt like stew, usually made with beef, veal or pork, but also with game meat like venison, deer and boar. Compulsory ingredients are meat and onions, usually in 50-50% ratio, paprika, and lard or oil, other ingredients being optional: garlic, parsley, chilly pepper, black pepper, cinnamon, bell peppers, carrots, tomatoes, red wine, mushrooms, bacon. Sometimes, goulash is sweetened by adding tomato paste, sugar or dark chocolate at the very end. In Serbia, goulash is most often served with macaroni or potato mash.

===Slovenia===
In [[Slovene language|Slovene]] ''partizanski golaž'', "partisan goulash", favoured by [[Slovenia]]n [[partisans (Yugoslavia)|partisans]] during the [[Second World War]], is still regularly served at mass public events. "Partisan ''golaž''" utilizes onion in equal proportion to meat; Slovenians usually use two or more types of meat in cooking "''golaž''".

===United States and Canada===
{{Main|American goulash}}
American goulash, mentioned in cookbooks since at least 1914, exists in a number of variant recipes.&lt;ref name=Metcalf&gt;{{cite book|last=Metcalf|first=Allan|title=The World in so Many Words|year=1999|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Company]]|location=Boston, MA, USA|isbn=0-395-95920-9|pages=47–48|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4O0W5XyQVCYC&amp;pg=PA47 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Toledo&gt;{{cite book|title=Cookbook of the Woman's Educational Club|year=1914|publisher=Woman's Educational Club of Toledo, Ohio|location=Toledo, OH, USA|url=https://books.google.com/?id=4iwwAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA49 |page=49}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Originally a dish of seasoned beef,&lt;ref name=Toledo/&gt; core ingredients of American goulash now usually include [[elbow macaroni]], cubed [[steak]], [[ground beef]] or "hamburger", and tomatoes in some form, whether canned whole, as [[tomato sauce]], tomato [[soup]], and/or [[tomato paste]]. In some areas it is called "slumgullion".

'''Heritage science''' is cross-disciplinary scientific research of [[cultural heritage]]. It encompasses research enabling access to [[cultural heritage]], its [[Art conservation|conservation]], [[Interpretation (aesthetics)|interpretation]] and [[management]].

The term has become widely used after 2006 when it became increasingly evident that the more traditional terms [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]] or preservation science inadequately reflected the breadth of research into [[cultural heritage]]. Heritage scientists in museums, galleries, libraries, archives, universities and research institutions support conservation (often called [[conservation science (cultural heritage)|conservation science]]), access (e.g. development of new [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]] tools), interpretation, including [[archaeometry]] and [[archaeological science]] (e.g. dating, [[Provenance|provenancing]], attribution), heritage management (e.g. development of tools and knowledge supporting strategic or environmental management decisions) and wider societal engagement with heritage (e.g. heritage [[Value (ethics)|values and ethics]]). Heritage science is also an excellent vehicle for public engagement with science as well as heritage.

Heritage science is seen as "key to the long-term sustainability of heritage: it is about managing change and risk and maximising social, cultural and economic benefit not just today, but in such a way that we can pass on to future generations that which we have inherited."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200506/ldselect/ldsctech/256/256.pdf |format=PDF |title=Science and Technology Committee : Science and Heritage |publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |accessdate=2015-02-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domains of research, where heritage science makes a particular input were recognised to be museums, galleries, libraries and archives; the built historic environment and archaeology, by the United Kingdom National Heritage Science Strategy documents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescienceforum.org.uk/strategy.php | title=UK National Heritage Science Strategy | accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Theory==
[[File:Red Rot Leather.jpg|right|thumbnail|Red rot on leather bindings was one of the first conservation issues to excite scientists.]]
The field still requires its literature canon and opinions on whether heritage science is a domain in its own right or a field of research diverge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h5SpIq80XpU | title=Round Table discussion on the Future of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this appears a matter of academic recognition, rather than a matter of research practice.

Heritage science is an old field of research: in his [[Royal Institution Christmas Lectures|Royal Institution Christmas Lecture]] in 1843, [[Michael Faraday]] already pointed out how pollution importantly contributes to book degradation. The following premises appear to be of defining importance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://heritagescienceresearch.wordpress.com/2015/11/17/theory_heritagescience/ | title=A Brief Theory of Heritage Science| accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Heritage science is inherently biased, as scientists, by doing research on heritage, contribute to its value: they create and popularize heritage through their research. 
# Heritage science is neither fundamental nor experimental: work with actual heritage objects, building or sites cannot be repeatable because heritage is not an experiment. On the other hand, the [[scientific method]] and deductive reasoning is easily applied when working with models and model objects, which heritage scientists often do due to the high value of actual historic objects and consequentially, sampling restrictions.

Since the context of heritage is often unknown, there can be any number of variables affecting the heritage system under observation – inductive reasoning is therefore often applied in heritage science. In this aspect, the premise of heritage science comes close to social science.
Heritage that is accessible, in its preserved authentic form or as a (digital) reproduction, is a "resource for economic growth, employment and social cohesion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/culture/library/publications/2014-heritage-communication_en.pdf |format=PDF |title=Towards an integrated approach to cultural heritage for Europe |publisher=EU |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through improved access, heritage science therefore contributes to well-being. Heritage science is proof that there is no world of [[The Two Cultures|'Two Cultures']]. A scientist, researching heritage defies the existence of the divide: there can be no scientific research of heritage without a contribution by humanities research. Heritage science also successfully bridges science and culture, because it provides an attractive vehicle to convey ideas and concepts related to technology and engineering, as well as culture and society. Heritage science can be considered an anthropogenic analog to environmental geography, which was defined by [[Halford Mackinder]] in 1887 as a discipline that aims to "bridge one of the greatest of all gaps" between "the natural sciences and the study of humanity".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=MacKinder|first=H. J.|date=1887|title=On the Scope and Methods of Geography|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/1801248|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography|volume=9|issue=3|pages=141–174|doi=10.2307/1801248}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Research==
[[Image:WoS publications 2015.png|right|thumbnail|Publication trends in the heritage science field, 2005-2014.]]

Heritage science is an increasingly lively science domain. Materials and techniques of the past are often very difficult to study and state-of-the-art techniques and methods need to be employed. Discoveries new to science are often the result of such endeavours, e.g. new antibiotics from bacteria discovered in the [[Cave of Altamira]], in Spain. With its wide definition, heritage science spans a significant variety of scientific activities. In order to support conservation, access, interpretation and management, heritage science must be based on an [[interdisciplinary]] palette of knowledge, from fundamental sciences ([[chemistry]], [[physics]], [[mathematics]], [[biology]]) to [[arts]] and [[humanities]] (conservation, [[archaeology]], [[philosophy]], [[ethics]], [[history]], [[art history]] etc.), including [[economics]], [[sociology]], [[computer science]]s and [[engineering]].

In academia, heritage science is often performed by scientists spending a proportion of their time on heritage-related research. The academic field, judged by the number of academic outputs published annually, is steadily increasing. This could be taken to estimate the domain size – with the number of outputs in 2014 being 6,800 (Source: Web of Science&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.webofknowledge.com/ |title=ISI Web of Knowledge |publisher=Images.isiknowledge.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;), it could be assumed that there are about 3,000 heritage scientists active in the field (publishing on average 2 academic publications per year). This goes against the generally held view that the field is small.

The proportion per country varies greatly, about 20% of researchers being active in the US, 15% in the UK, 10% in Italy, 5% France, and 5% in China (with a strong increase in the last decade).

Since 2013, the scientific domain has its own flagship journal, ''Heritage Science''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/ |title=Heritage Science |publisher=Heritagesciencejournal.com |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the Mind the Gap project,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/about/our-role/collection-care/heritage-science-research-and-development/collaborative-working-practices-mind-the-gap/ |title= Mind the gap project |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; funded by the UK EPSRC/AHRC Science and Heritage Programme,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagescience.ac.uk/ |title= UK AHRC/EPSRC Science and Heritage Programme |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; reported on the drivers and impediments in cross-disciplinary research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/documents/mind-the-gap-report-jan-2014.pdf |format=PDF |title=Mind the Gap Report |publisher=AHRC |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project found that there is no gap between rigour and relevance in heritage science research but rather that there is a continuum of activity. However, there was less satisfaction with heritage science research in relation to its impact on practice, in comparison to its academic impact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heritagesciencejournal.com/content/2/1/11 |title= Mind the gap: rigour and relevance in collaborative heritage science research |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education==
[[File:SEAHA Mobile Heritage Lab.jpg|thumbnail|The SEAHA Mobile Heritage Laboratory for field research and public engagement with science and heritage.]]
The heritage science career paths are various. Due to the cross-disciplinary nature of heritage science, any academic background is suitable, from [[formal sciences]], [[natural sciences]] to [[social sciences]]. 
Most researchers have entered the field by carrying out doctoral research in the field, which is due to the fact that there is currently no undergraduate course in this domain. Since 2010, Master's degree courses in heritage science have become available at [[University College London]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bartlett.ucl.ac.uk/heritage/programmes/mres-msc/mres-seaha |title=Heritage Science Masters at UCL Institute for Sustainable Heritage |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Queens University Belfast]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qub.ac.uk/schools/gap/ProspectiveStudents/PostgraduateStudies/GraduateStudiesTaught/HeritageScience/ |title=Heritage Science Masters at Queens University, Belfast |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Italy, students can obtain undergraduate and/or graduate degrees in conservation science at the [[University of Florence]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unifi.it/p-cor2-2016-101227-B194-GEN-1-1.html|title=Offerta formativa - Università degli Studi di Firenze - UniFI|website=www.unifi.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Bologna]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://corsi.unibo.it/SCIENCEFORCONSERVATION/Pages/default.aspx|title=Two year master in Science for the conservation-restoration of cultural heritage - Ravenna - Università di Bologna|website=corsi.unibo.it|language=en|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a recently created programme at the [[Ca' Foscari University of Venice|University of Venice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.unive.it/pag/20740/|title=Summary: Master's Degree Programme in Conservation Science and Technology for Cultural Heritage - Ca' Foscari|website=www.unive.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other universities in Italy have faculty members whose primary research focus is in heritage science; these groups often accept international students who would like to obtain a PhD in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.scich.it/index.html|title=COLOMBINI GROUP - Chemical Science for the Safeguard of Cultural Heritage|website=www.scich.it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it/do/docenti.pl/Alias?oscar.chiantore#profilo|title=Prof. Oscar Chiantore - Corso di Laurea Magistrale in Scienza dei Materiali - Università degli Studi di Torino|last=Torino|first=Università degli Studi di|website=scienzadeimateriali.campusnet.unito.it|language=it|access-date=2017-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Taught courses in heritage science programmes include elements of heritage science, e.g. technical art history is often part of [[art history]] courses, and [[natural sciences]] are often taught in conservation courses. [[Brandenburg University of Technology]] in Germany offers the international Master's programme World Heritage Studies &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/en/heritage-studies-phd/|title=World Heritage Studies, Master of Arts|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and PhD programme Heritage Studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.b-tu.de/worldheritage-ma/|title=PhD Programme Heritage Studies|website=www.b-tu.de|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[University College London|UCL]], [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Brighton]], the Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology ([http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ SEAHA]) was established in 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seaha-cdt.ac.uk/ |title=Centre for Doctoral Training in Science and Engineering in Arts, Heritage and Archaeology |accessdate=2016-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; A key aspect of the SEAHA scheme is the collaborative nature of projects, enabling partnerships between academic institutions, industry and national heritage agencies and giving an applied focus to the research training.

Since the field requires significant cross-disciplinary and transferrable skills, graduates may be able to take jobs in industry and academia. To work within the field of heritage science (e.g. in a museum laboratory), a PhD in the physical sciences and significant experience in a museum or conservation studio is typically required.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="70470">A '''hookup culture''' is one that accepts and encourages [[casual sex]]ual encounters, including [[one-night stand]]s and other related activity, without necessarily including emotional bonding or long-term commitment.{{sfn|Freitas|2013}} It is generally associated with [[Western culture|Western]] late adolescent behavior and, in particular, American college culture.&lt;ref name=TIMIvyLegHook/&gt;&lt;ref name=bogle2007/&gt;&lt;ref name="paul2006"/&gt; The term '''hookup''' has an ambiguous definition because it can indicate [[kissing]] or any form of physical [[Human sexual activity|sexual activity]] between [[sexual partner]]s.&lt;ref name=ABCHookup/&gt;&lt;ref name=WolfHookingUp/&gt; The term has been widely used in the USA since at least 2000.&lt;ref name="WolfHookingUp"/&gt; It has also been called '''nonrelationship sex''',&lt;ref&gt;http://www.psc.isr.umich.edu/pubs/abs/4696 Retrieved July 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; or sex without dating.

Most research on hookups has been focused on American college students, but hookups are not limited to college campuses.&lt;ref name="Kerner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mckay"/&gt; Adolescents and emerging adults engage in hookups for a variety of reasons, which may range from instant physical gratification, to fulfillment of emotional needs, to using it as a means of finding a long-term romantic partner.&lt;ref name="mckay"/&gt; Media reaction to hookup culture has been dismissed as [[moral panic]].&lt;ref name="contexts" /&gt;&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;&lt;ref name=panic /&gt; The recent introduction of mobile hookup apps and websites have shaped hookup culture, especially among gay men.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==History==
The rise of hookups, a form of [[casual sex]], has been described by [[Evolutionary biology|evolutionary biologist]] [[Justin Garcia]] and others as a "cultural revolution" that had its beginnings in the 1920s.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt; Historians D'Emilio and Freedman put the beginning of casual sex, including college hookups, further back in history, to the early 1800s, and explain the phenomenon as shaped by historical and cultural forces.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;D'Emilio, John, and Estelle Freedman. (2012). ''Intimate Matters: A History of Sexuality in America.'' Chicago, IL: Chicago University Press. {{ISBN|9780226923819}}&lt;/ref&gt; They give as examples planter class white men who had casual sex with enslaved African American women, and white male college students who had casual sex with both white and black women. Lisa Wade, a sociologist, documents that 19th century white fraternity men often had what would be called hookup sex with prostitutes, poor women, and the women they had enslaved.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Wade, Lisa. (2017). ''American Hookup: The New Culture of Sex on Campus.'' W. W. Norton. {{ISBN|9780393355536}}&lt;/ref&gt; Homosexual men also engaged in hookup sex during the 1800s, meeting in spaces that were transient in nature, such as wharves and boarding houses.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Since the 1920s, there has been a transition from an age of courtship to an era of hookup culture.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hooking Up: Sex, Dating, and Relationships on Campus|last=Bogle|first=Kathleen A.|publisher=NYU Press|year=2008|isbn=9780814789919|location=New York|pages=7–|via=ProQuest ebrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Technological advancements such as the automobile and movie theaters brought young couples out of their parents' homes, and out from their watchful eyes, giving them more freedom and more opportunity to engage in casual sexual activity.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;

The [[sexual revolution]] of the 1960s brought a loosening of sexual morals which allowed for sex to become uncoupled from relationships and non-marital sex to become more socially acceptable.&lt;ref name="bogle2007"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bogle2008"/&gt; Some scholars, including Garcia and Freitas, have found that [[dating]], while it has not disappeared, has decreased as the frequency of hookups have increased.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;{{sfn|Freitas|2013|p=159}} By the mid-1990s, Freitas found that hookups were an accepted form of interactions among sexually active adults especially those located on college campuses.{{sfn|Freitas|2013}}

According to a review by Garcia, this is "an unprecedented time in the history of human sexuality."&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt; People are marrying and beginning families at ages later than previous generations while becoming sexually mature at an earlier age. As a result, Garcia and other scholars argue that young adults are able to reproduce physiologically but are not psychologically or socially ready to 'settle down' and begin a family.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;

These developmental shifts, Garcia's [[systematic review]] of the literature suggests, is one of the factors driving the increase in hookups, a "popular cultural change that has infiltrated the lives of emerging adults throughout the Western world."&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;  The review shows that hookups are becoming increasingly normative among young adults and adolescents in North America and have taken root throughout the Western world, which represents a notable shift in how casual sex is perceived and accepted.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

Garcia and others have noted that the "past decade has witnessed an explosion in interest in the topic of hookups, both scientifically and in the popular media. Research on hookups is not seated within a singular disciplinary sphere; it sits at the crossroads of theoretical and empirical ideas drawn from a diverse range of fields, including [[psychology]], [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], [[biology]], [[medicine]], and [[public health]]."&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;  Difficulties in defining the term can lead to different perceptions of its prevalence.&lt;ref name="Stuart"/&gt; The hookup culture is vaguely defined due to a variety of perspectives taken on this subject related human sexuality. It is hard to make sense of the hookup culture with understanding why it exists in society and why individuals participate in the culture.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Laid : Young People's Experiences with Sex in an Easy-Access Culture|last=Boodram|first=Shannon T.|publisher=Seal Press|year=2009|isbn=9781580053242|location=Berkeley, California|pages=1–58|via=ProQuest Ebrary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shannon T. Boodram, "hooking up is nothing more than settling; it is the microwaveable burrito of sex."&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Hooking up is engaged in for the instant gratification for sex, pleasure, a feeling of being loved, an emotional feeling of being adhered to, the thought of the potential of the hook up developing into something less casual, and many more reasons.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

According to Kathleen Bogle, the phrase 'hooking up' is "a slang term" deemed unofficial and unpredictable due to the extended variation of its meaning.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Many other slang terms for hooking up were and still are used such as "friends with benefits" and "booty call."&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Other terms for repeated acts of hooking up include, "casual sex" or "recreational sex," or defined as a relationship with "no strings attached."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=College sex : philosophers with benefits|author1=Bruce, Michael |author2=Stewart, Robert |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2010|isbn=9781444324488|location=Malden, MA|pages=91–102|quote=|via=Wiley Online Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Behavioral norms ==
The definition of hooking up can vary depending on the person or on the age group. It can range from acts that involve kissing, oral sex, or intercourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Napper|first=Lucy E.|last2=Kenney|first2=Shannon R.|last3=LaBrie|first3=Joseph W.|date=2016-10-20|title=The Longitudinal Relationships among Injunctive Norms and Hooking Up Attitudes and Behaviors in College Students|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=52|issue=5|pages=499–506|doi=10.1080/00224499.2014.952809|issn=0022-4499|pmc=4374023|pmid=25255916}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term "hooking up", meaning an instance of casual sex, differs from hook up ''culture''. A hook up is an act that involves sexual intimacy, claimed by many to be a sexually liberating act. On the other hand, hook up culture is thought to be oppressive and monolithic, with intimacy only occurring within a specific context.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.chatelaine.com/health/sex-and-relationships/hookups-new-social-norm/|title=The difference between casual sex and hooking up - Chatelaine.com|date=2013-03-27|newspaper=Chatelaine|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jennifer Aubrey and Siobhan Smith have found that between genders there are minimal differences when it comes to behavior and frequency in hookups; on the other hand, women still face a harder social stigma, because their social status decreases with increased sexual partners, while men's social status increases with more sexual partners''.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Impact of Exposure to Sexuality Oriented Media on the Endorsement of Hookup Culture: A Panel Study of First-Year College Students".|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Danielle M. Currier, she explores how the phrase "hooking up" conveys different meanings depending on whether a man or woman uses it when describing their sexual encounters; furthermore, Currier notes that men use "hooking up" to emphasize their masculinity and heterosexuality whereas women use the phrase to preserve their femininity by being strategically ambiguous in order to downplay their sexual desires.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Currier|first=Danielle M.|year=2013|title=Strategic Ambiguity: Protecting Emphasized Femininity and Hegemonic Masculinity in the Hookup Culture|url=|journal=Gender &amp; Society|volume=27|issue=5|pages=704–727|via=sagepub|doi=10.1177/0891243213493960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adolescents==
Some North American surveys published in the mid-2000s have shown that upwards of 60% or 70% of sexually active teens reported having had uncommitted sex within the last year.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="manning"/&gt;&lt;ref name="grello"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Couric"/&gt;  This is more common among boys than girls.&lt;ref name="manning"/&gt;  Among sexually experienced adolescents, 28% of boys and 16% of girls reported losing their virginity to either someone they have just met, or to a friend who is not a dating partner.&lt;ref name="gutt"/&gt;

Boys are more likely than girls to have several hookup partners at the same time, and are also more likely to hook up with someone they are not dating.&lt;ref name="manning"/&gt;  For both genders, hookups are more likely to be with an ex-boyfriend, an ex-girlfriend or a friend than with an acquaintance.&lt;ref name="manning"/&gt;  The majority of teens (68%) who hook up with a friend or an ex will hook up with them again.&lt;ref name="manning"/&gt;

About half of all hookups among adolescents were a one time affair, and this is the same for both boys and girls.&lt;ref name="manning"/&gt; Only 6% of teens have had sex with someone they just met,  and these encounters are a one time affair 75% of the time.&lt;ref name="manning"/&gt;  Over all, 25% of those who had sexual experience with a dating partner have also hooked up with someone they were not dating.&lt;ref name="manning"/&gt;  Additionally, 40% of those who had hooked up with someone they were not dating had also hooked up with a dating partner in the previous 12 months.&lt;ref name="manning"/&gt;

Studies have shown that most high school girls are more interested in a relationship compared to high school boys, who are mostly interested in sex. Young women tend to be honest about their sexual encounters and experiences, while young men tend to lie more often about theirs. Another study shows that once a person has sex for their first time, it becomes less of an issue or big deal to future relationships or hook ups. During this study, it was shown that girls in high school do not care as much as boys do on having sex in a relationship. But, on the contrary girls will have sex with their partner in order to match them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/business/moneybox/2010/11/freaks_geeks_and_economists.html|title=Freaks, Geeks, and Economists|last=Lowrey|first=Annie|date=2010-11-15|newspaper=Slate|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
For some adolescents, sex and relationships have been decoupled.

Some worry that if society disconnects intimate sexual behavior and emotional connection, teens who hook up will have trouble forming stable intimate relationships later in life.&lt;ref name="NYT Teenage Face" /&gt;&lt;ref name="USATodayTeens" /&gt;{{sfn|Sax|2005|p=131}}

Journalist [[Sabrina Weill]] asserts that "casual teen attitudes toward sex—particularly oral sex—reflect their confusion about what is normal behavior," and adds that they "are facing an intimacy crisis that could haunt them in future relationships. 'When teenagers fool around before they're ready or have a very casual attitude toward sex, they proceed toward adulthood with a lack of understanding about intimacy.'"&lt;ref name="USATodayTeens" /&gt;

==College==
Historical research documents that white male college students have a long history of engaging in hookup sex.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Journals and letters from the 1800's demonstrate that wealthy young white male college students hooked up with prostitutes, poor women, and enslaved African American women. 

Today, according to one study the vast majority, more than 90% of American college students say their campus is characterized by a hookup culture,&lt;ref name="wade" /&gt; and students believe that about 85% of their classmates have hooked up.&lt;ref name="paul2006" /&gt;  Studies show that most students (most recent data suggest between 60% and 80%) do have some sort of casual sex experience.&lt;ref name="review" /&gt;&lt;ref name="apa" /&gt;  Of those students who have hooked up, between 30% and 50%  report that their hookups included sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name="paul2006" /&gt; Nationally, women now outnumber men in college enrollment by 4 to 3, leading some researchers to argue that the gender imbalance fosters a culture of hooking up because men, as the minority and [[limiting factor]], hold more power in the sexual marketplace and use it to pursue their preference of casual sex over long-term relationships.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/fashion/sex-on-campus-she-can-play-that-game-too.html |title=Sex on Campus: She Can Play That Game, Too|date=14 July 2013|work=The New York Times|accessdate=1 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, most students overestimate the amount of hookups in which their peers engage.&lt;ref name="Skelton" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;  Only 20% of students regularly hookup.&lt;ref name="wade" /&gt; Roughly one half will occasionally hookup, and one-third of students do not hook up at all.&lt;ref name="wade" /&gt;  The median number of hookups for a graduating senior on a college campus is seven, and the typical college student acquires two new sexual partners during their college career.&lt;ref name="wade" /&gt;  Half of all hookups are repeats, and 25% of students will graduate from college a virgin.&lt;ref name="wade" /&gt; African American women students are less likely to engage in hookup sex than white women students.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

One study has found that the strongest predictor of hookup behavior was previous experience hooking up.  Those who have engaged in hookups that involve penetrative sex are 600% more likely to hookup again during the same semester.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="owen"/&gt;

Subculture can affect gender roles and sexuality, and youth subcultures are particularly susceptible to peer pressure. Self-esteem is also an indicator: men with high self-esteem and women with low self-esteem are more likely to have multiple sexual partners, but hookups are less likely among both genders when they have high self-esteem.  Most predictors among males and females rarely differ.&lt;ref name="paul2000" /&gt;

One third of gay and bisexual college men have met an anonymous sexual partner in a public place such as a park, bookstore, or restroom.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;  Other venues such as public [[Cruising for sex|cruising areas]], Internet cruising networks, and bathhouses are popular for gay men, but not for lesbians or heterosexuals.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

The trend toward marrying later may be what is fueling the hookup scene on college campuses.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Bogle, Kathleen A. (January 2008). Hooking Up : Sex, Dating, and Relationships on Campus. NYU Press. {{ISBN|9780814789919}}.&lt;/ref&gt; At colleges, hookups are common between students at parties, in dormitories and fraternity houses, at surrounding bars and clubs, and at popular student vacation destinations. For example, a study of Canadian college students who planned to hook up while on spring break showed that 61% of men and 34% of women had sex within a day of meeting their partner.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;

Another study was based on a survey of over 18,000 college students from ages 18–25. This survey asked questions like how many sexual partners they have had since graduating high school, how many sexual partners per year, and how many times per week they have sex.  It was reported that a little over 59% of college students have sex once per week. A little over 31% reported to having at least one sexual partner per year, and about 50% said that they have had more than two sexual partners since the age of 18.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.livescience.com/38843-college-hookup-culture-myth.html|title=The Truth About College Students and Casual Sex Revealed|newspaper=Live Science|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptions of "frat boys" and how this stereotype seems to be the typical male how only pursues women to have sexual relations. Many female college students explained how the "frat boy" perfectly embodies the persona of a sex driven male.&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hooking Up : Sex, Dating, and Relationships on Campus.|last=Bogle|first=Kathleen A.|publisher=NYU Press|year=January 2008|isbn=9780814789919|location=|pages=|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationships===
Hooking up generally refers to having sex; however, many others indicated that when they say hooking up they are referring to something less than intercourse.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In a hookup culture, young people often have little experience with dating and developing romantic relationships.{{sfn|Freitas|2013|p=170}}{{sfn|Kimmel|2008|p=190}}  Hooking up is means for experiencing casual sexual encounters, but it is also means for beginning relationships.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Students often feel that hookups are the only option, and that their peers do not date, which becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy as fewer students date because they believe their classmates do not believe in dating.{{sfn|Freitas|2013|p=160}} Freitas' study has found that students on these campuses generally feel that the decision about whether or not to be in a relationship is out of their control and that "hookup culture dictated for them that there would be no dating, and that they simply had to endure this reality."{{sfn|Freitas|2013|p=159}}

Kimmel believes that while sexual promiscuity once existed on college campuses alongside more traditional forms of dating, hooking up is now "the alpha and omega of young adult romance."{{sfn|Kimmel|2008|p=191}}  Wade, on the other hand, says that college students are merely engaging in a different form of courtship that often results in monogamous relationships.&lt;ref name="wade" /&gt; This view is echoed by Armstrong,  Hamilton, and England, who state that college students have not abandoned dating.&lt;ref name="contexts" /&gt;  Some students claim that hook ups fit their busy personal and professional schedules better than traditional dating does and is thus liberating.&lt;ref name="Taylor"/&gt;  Freitas counters that living in the hookup culture is not at all liberating if what students want is to actually go on dates.{{sfn|Freitas|2013|p=165}}

Freitas has opined that a "hookup is a sexual act that thwarts meaning, purpose, and relationship."{{sfn|Freitas|2013|p=29}}  However, most students do want to be in a romantic relationship.&lt;ref name="Kerner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wade"/&gt;  One study has found that 63% of college-aged men and 83% of college-aged women would prefer a traditional romantic relationship at their current stage in life to casual sex.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;  Additionally, 95% of women and 77% of men say they prefer dating to hooking up.&lt;ref name="wade"/&gt;  "Without exception," sex counselor [[Ian Kerner]] has says, students "discuss a long-term monogamous relationship as their desired end goal."&lt;ref name="Kerner"/&gt; While more than half of students of both genders say they would like a hook up to develop into a romantic relationship,&lt;ref name="Kerner" /&gt;&lt;ref name="review" /&gt;{{sfn|Freitas|2013|p=112}} only 6.5% (4.4% of men and 8.2% of women) expect that one will.&lt;ref name="apa" /&gt;&lt;ref name="garcia" /&gt;  Half of women, 51%, and 42% of men, have tried discussing the possibility of beginning a romantic relationship with a hookup partner.&lt;ref name="review" /&gt;

More than half of college relationships begin with a hookup, Bogle's research has found.&lt;ref name="Whelan" /&gt;{{sfn|Bogle|2008}}  Freitas's study shows that when a relationship is born of a hookup, it is usually after months of engaging is a serial hookup.{{sfn|Freitas|2013|p=158}}  Relationships that begin as a hookup, or as a "friends with benefits" situation, report lower levels of satisfaction.&lt;ref name="review" /&gt;  Garcia says that hookup culture can lead to a lower incidence of dating among youth, but as people get a bit older they outgrow their desire for hookups and settle into traditional dating.&lt;ref name="Kerner" /&gt;

Oftentimes, men and women seem to not be on the "same page." According to Bogle, many males believed that females often invested themselves or had an ulterior motive for pursuing a hookup like situation. For instance, when a male student was asked if he felt that women looked for different components in a hookup; his response was that most females generally did not lean towards a "one and done" thing.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;

Sociologist Wade&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; discusses several scholars who disagree that contemporary college students desire long-term monogamous relationships. She cites Elizabeth Armstrong and Laura Hamilton,&lt;ref&gt;Armstrong, Elizabeth, and Laura Hamilton. (2015). ''Paying for the Party: How College Maintains Inequality''. Harvard University Press. {{ISBN|9780674088023}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hanna Rosin,&lt;ref&gt;Rosin, Hannah. (September 2012). "Boys on the side." ''The Atlantic.'' https://www.theatlantic.com/magazine/archive/2012/09/boys-on-the-side/309062/ &lt;/ref&gt; and Kate Taylor&lt;ref name="Taylor" /&gt; who posit that hookup culture is good for women as it frees them to focus on their studies and on their professional develop for careers instead of seeking a long term partner or marriage.

Freitas believes the lessons imparted by hookup culture have "set back" students who often have little experience dating, and few skills in asking a romantic partner out as a result.{{sfn|Freitas|2013}}  There has been such a decline in dating culture on college campuses that most students have had more hookups than first dates.&lt;ref name="Kerner"/&gt;  On some campuses, dating is so rare that many students do not have the skills to know how to ask someone out.{{sfn|Freitas|2013}}  [[Boston College]] even offers a course on how to plan and execute a date.{{sfn|Freitas|2013}}

===Risk===
Garcia's review has found that hookups can result in emotional and psychological injury, sexual violence, sexually transmitted infections, and/or unintended pregnancy.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;  Most students report with not concerning themselves with or being concerned about the health risks that come with hookups, however, especially if their partner was a member of their own community, such as a student on the same college campus.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt; Garcia notes that there can be a lot of pressure when it comes to hooking up which can contribute to discomfort, performance anxiety, and stress. &lt;sup&gt;[69]&lt;/sup&gt;

Some studies have found that students, both men and women, overwhelmingly regret their hookups.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;  In one, 77% of students regretted their hookups,&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eshbaugh"/&gt; and in another 78% of women and 72% of men who had uncommitted vaginal, anal, and/or oral sex regretted the experience.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eshbaugh"/&gt;  Intercourse that occurred less than 24 hours after meeting, and those that took place only one time are the most likely to be regretted.&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt; Men were more likely to be sorry for having used another person, and women regretted the experience because they felt they had been used.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="campbell"/&gt;  While women usually feel worse after a hook up than men do, 39% of men expressed extreme regret, shame, and frustration with themselves about their hookup experiences.{{sfn|Freitas|2013|p=111}}

Other studies found that many college students do not regret their hookup experiences. Wade&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; interviewed many women and men who were enthusiastic about their hookup experiences. Vrangalova and Ong's study documented that students who had a stable personality orientation towards casual sex reported a heightened sense of well being after experiencing casual sex.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Vrangalova, Zhana, and Anthony D. Ong. (June 6 2014). "Who benefits from casual sex? The moderating role of sociosexuality." ''Social Psychology &amp; Personal Science.'' http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/abs/10.1177/1948550614537308 accessed 6-16-18.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some research shows that hook up regret is gendered, with women tending to regret hooking up much more than men do. According to one study of 832 college students, 26% of women and 50% of men reported positive emotional reactions following a hookup and 49% of women and 26% of men reported negative reactions following a hook up.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/gpr/16/2/161.pdf|title = PsycNET - Option to Buy|website = psycnet.apa.org|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to "Explaining Gender Differences in Hookup Regret", there are at least four explanations for why women may regret hookups more than men: (1) They may have different attitudes towards relationships, hooking up, and sex; (2) there may be differences in sexual initiation and agency within hookups; (3) there may be differences in the frequency of orgasm within hookups; and (4) there may be differences in perceived inequality in orgasms during hookups.&lt;ref&gt;Explaining Gender Differences in Hookup Regret. Jeremy E. Uecker Brandon C. Martinez. Retrieved from http://paa2014.princeton.edu/papers/142072 on March 3, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Other studies, such as Vrangalova and Ong, found no gender difference.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

Regret from hooking up may be linked to negative emotional outcomes, especially in women. According to an article by Steven E. Rhoads, Laura Webber, et al., "the more partners women have in the course of their lives, the more likely they are to be depressed, to cry almost every day, and to report relatively low satisfaction with their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://chronicle.com/article/The-Emotional-Costs-of-Hooking/65960/|title = The Emotional Costs of Hooking Up|website = The Chronicle of Higher Education|access-date = 2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Premarital Sex in America: How Young Americans Meet, Mate, and Think About Marrying,'' Mark Regnerus and Jeremy Uecker report that having more sexual partners is associated with "poorer emotional states in women, but not in men."

The [[American Psychological Association]] also says that hookups can result in guilt and negative feelings. In a study of 169 sexually experienced men and women surveyed in singles bars, when presented with the statement, "I feel guilty or would feel guilty about having sexual intercourse with someone I had just met," 32 percent of men and 72 percent of women agreed (Herold &amp; Mewhinney, 1993).&lt;ref name="apa" /&gt;

Students who reported to Freitas that they were profoundly upset about hooking up say the encounters made them feel, among other things, used, miserable, disgusted, and duped.{{sfn|Freitas|2013|48}}  In order to avoid becoming a victim, experts believe "that the first step is to acknowledge the dangers inherent in the free-and-easy hookup approach to dating and sex."&lt;ref name="cosmo"/&gt;  In one qualitative study, only 2% felt desirable or wanted after a hookup.&lt;ref name="paul"/&gt;  More than a third, on the other hand, felt regretful or disappointed, and others reported feeling nervous or uncomfortable as well.&lt;ref name="paul"/&gt;

=== Peer culture ===
College students base their sexual ideas and sexual actions within a peer culture. This is where students who are peers are comparing and differing sexual situations in one's own life amongst each other to create a foundation for the current hookup culture.&lt;ref name=":13"/&gt; Kathleen A. Bogle describes the peer culture at universities as the "sexual arena."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; College students on campuses are able to create and explore their own sexual beings in life by referencing others' intimacy, which tends to be presented publicly.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

This peer culture is not only amongst college students, but it may start to develop around the time puberty starts in middle school for both genders around the age of eleven to fourteen years old. In general, puberty is a time when sexuality and body awareness becomes a main focus for individuals to formulate this aspect of their identity. Once in college, for most students, the parental aspect is diminished leaving a student feeling a high degree of freedom to truly explore and expand their whole personal identity, strongly including sexual identity in this "sexual arena."&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

According to Bogle, the campuses her studies were done at had a common trend of college students being strongly interested in every other student's private life.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  This awareness of all the happenings in other students' lives closed the doored for true privacy, and made the college scene an open door in looking at others' relationships and sexual intimacy.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;  College is a highly public environment, any kind of sexual activity or public display of affection at parties or on campus are exposed to others. The viewers of this activity process, interpret, and form assumptions about what was observed. These types of sexual activity or public displays of affection could be as meaningless as two individuals romantically speaking to each other in a high capacity location on campus or could be as extreme as two individuals walking into a bedroom together at a party.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

This peer culture has evolved and escalated with access to rapid communication such as texting on cell phones and multiple social media applications. Most these social media applications are identity profiles, public thought disposals, and virtual photo albums of oneself, where other's are just a click away from cyber analysis of how that individual displays themselves physically, sexually, psychologically, emotionally, and mentally on the internet. Bogle states that the knowing of other's personal lives isn't just a purpose to gossip, but a way to observe, analyze, and be impacted by other's sexual actions, solely for the purpose of their own actions.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; A peer culture is where norms surface because individuals begin to conduct themselves in the same manner that their peers do, which creates this typical and common style of acquitting oneself.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt;

==Drugs and alcohol==
Some studies have made a connection between hookup culture and substance use.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt; A majority of students said that their hookups occurred after drinking [[Alcoholic beverage|alcohol]].&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fielder"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis"/&gt;  Frietas has said that in her study the relationship between drinking and the party scene, and between alcohol and hookup culture, was "impossible to miss."{{sfn|Freitas|2013|p=41}} Hookups "almost always" occur when at least one participant is drunk according to Kimmel.{{sfn|Kimmel|2008|p=199}} On average, men have five drinks when they hookup, and women three.{{sfn|Kimmel|2008|p=199}}  Students who reported using [[marijuana]] or [[cocaine]] in the past year were also more likely than their peers to have hooked up during that period.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="van gelder"/&gt;

About a third of the students who reported engaging in vaginal, anal, or oral sex during a hookup reported being very intoxicated and another third reported being mildly intoxicated.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fisher"/&gt; Alcohol can act as a cue regarding sexual availability, as a disinhibitor, and as a rationalization or excuse for their behavior, poor sexual performance, premature ejaculation, and other sexual dysfunctions.{{sfn|Kimmel|2008|p=200}}&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="paul"/&gt; It also is the "liquid courage" that allows them to make a sexual advance in the first place.{{sfn|Kimmel|2008|p=200}}

Studies suggest that the degree of alcoholic intoxication directly correlates with the level of risky behavior.&lt;ref name="paul2000" /&gt;  In one study, 33% of those who had hooked up indicated that it was "unintentional," and likely due to the influence of alcohol or other drugs.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="garcia"/&gt; In a survey of first-year students, women said that 64% of their hookups came after drinking alcohol.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fielder"/&gt;  These results were similar to another study which found that 61% of all undergraduates reported drinking alcohol before their last hookup.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lewis"/&gt;

Studies have generally shown that greater alcohol use is associated with more sexual activity in the course of a hookup.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="owen"/&gt; The students who reported the least amount of alcohol consumption were also the least likely to hook up. At the other end of the spectrum, the greatest alcohol consumption was associated with penetrative sex, and less alcohol consumption with non-penatrative hookups.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="owen"/&gt; Of those who took part in a hook up that included vaginal, anal, or oral sex, 35% were very intoxicated, 27% were mildly intoxicated, 27% were sober and 9% were extremely intoxicated.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="fisher"/&gt;

==Wider culture==
Hookup culture on college campuses is intertwined with a broader society. On the other hand, some sociologists have argued that hookup culture is a characteristic of the American college environment and does not reflect broader American youth culture, just as many college graduates stop engaging in hookups when they leave college preferring instead dating or other sexual arrangements.&lt;ref name="bogle2007"/&gt;  Others, including [[Michael Kimmel]], have said that "the hookup culture can extend for years" beyond college, "well into their thirties and even their forties."{{sfn|Kimmel|2008|p=259}}  Baby Boomer fears of hookup culture have been termed a "moral panic".&lt;ref name="contexts" /&gt; Until recently, those who studied the rise of hookup culture had generally assumed that it was driven by men, and that women were reluctant participants, more interested in romance than in casual sexual encounters. But evidence exists that young women are propelling it too.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

Hookup culture also exists outside of the college environment. Location-based geosocial networking smartphone applications, a.k.a. hookup apps or dating apps, are increasingly being used to locate potential hookups.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Hahn, Hunter A.; Dokyoung S. You; Michale Sferra; Meagan Hubbard; Sneha Thamotharan; et al. (2018). "Is it too soon to meet? Examining differences in geosocial networking app use and sexual risk behavior of emerging adults." ''Sexuality &amp; Culture'' 22(1): 1-21. DOI:10.1007/s12119-017-9449-3. Accessed 6-16-18&lt;/ref&gt; Men who have sex with men (MSM) commonly use mobile dating apps designed for the gay male market such as [[Grindr]], [[Jack'd]], and [[Scruff (app)|SCRUFF]] to find hookup partners.&lt;ref&gt;Chan, Lik Sam. (2017). "The role of gay identity confusion and outness in sex-seeking on mobile dating apps among men who have sex with men." ''Journal of Homosexuality'' 64(5): 622-637. DOI:10.1080/00918369.2016.1196990. Accessed 6-16-18.&lt;/ref&gt; One study noted that gay men's increased use of mobile hook-up apps has eroded gay public life, especially for those gay men who are on the urban margins in terms of social class and generation.&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Mark; Paul Flowers; Karen Lorimer; Jane Oakland; and Jamie Frankis. (2016). "Location, safety, and (non)strangers in gay men's narratives on 'hook-up' apps." ''Sexualities. 19(7): 836-852.''&lt;/ref&gt; Hook-up apps designed for heterosexuals emerged after the gay-oriented Grindr; [[Tinder (app)|Tinder]], for example, was introduced in 2013.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;Murray, Sarah, and  Megan Sapnar Ankerson. (2016). "Lez takes time: designing lesbian contact in geosocial networking apps." ''Critical Studies in Media Communication'' 33(1): 53-69. https://doi.org/10.1080/15295036.2015.1133921 Accessed. 6-16-18.&lt;/ref&gt; There have been a variety of dating apps for women who identify as lesbian, but they have been criticized for merely being "reskins" of successful hookup apps for gay men.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Daatch is described as one of the few successful hookup apps designed for lesbians.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

Life course studies indicate that as people grow older and as they subjectively identify as adult, they are less likely to engage in casual sexual behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Lyons, Heidi Ann. (2015). "Subjective adult identity and casual sexual behavior."  Advances in Life Course Research 26(1): 1-10. https://doi.org/10.1016/j.alcr.2015.07.001 Accessed 6-16-18.&lt;/ref&gt; However, social scientists recognize that there is little scientific research on older people's sex lives, so no definitive conclusions may be drawn.&lt;ref&gt;DeLamater, John. (2015). "Sexual expression in later life," pp. 175-197 in ''Sexualities: Identities, Behaviors, and Society'', Michael Kimmel and the Stony Brook Sexualities Group, ed. Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Media===
{{See also|Media and American adolescent sexuality}}

The [[American Academy of Pediatrics]] has argued that media representations of sexuality may influence teen sexual behavior,&lt;ref name="PED media"/&gt; and this view is supported by a number of studies.&lt;ref name="review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="depts.washington.edu"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Strasburger"/&gt;{{lopsided|date=July 2013}} Some studies suggest that teens who watch movies with more sexual content tend to become sexually active at an earlier age, and engage in riskier sexual behaviors.&lt;ref name="linda"/&gt; The idea is that the media may serve as a "super peer" for youth,&lt;ref name="JAH media"/&gt; who then seek to develop a sexual identity that is in line with popular portrayals.&lt;ref name="paul2006"/&gt;{{sfn|Kimmel|2008|p=207}} On the other side, conservatives opposed to hookup culture have sparked controversy and come under criticism.&lt;ref name="Horn" /&gt;

Cable television is filled with reality shows that depict an image of partying and glorified hookups, one of the most well known shows being MTV's Jersey Shore.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Impact of Exposure to Sexually Oriented Media on the Endorsement of Hookup Culture: A Panel Study of First-Year College Students|journal=Mass Communication and Society|volume=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Studies have found that about 35% of sexual behavior on cable television is with people "who are not in established committed relationships".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In television sexual monogamy differs from gender, suggesting men stray away from commitment, while women desire it.&lt;ref name=":23"&gt;{{Cite journal|title=From sex to sexuality: Exposing the heterosexual script on primetime network television|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=44|doi=10.1080/00224490701263660}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further suggesting masculinity is equal to sex, possibly leading male viewers to be more accepting of hookup culture.&lt;ref name=":23"/&gt;

As the cost of personal computers dropped and online access has increased, Heldman and Wade, along with others, argue that internet pornography has "emerged as a primary influence on young people's, especially men's, attitudes towards sex and their own sexuality."&lt;ref name="paul2006" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JAH media" /&gt;&lt;ref name="heldman" /&gt;  Heldman and Wade believe that the increase of access to pornography via the internet is what "spurred" hookup culture, in part by challenging the idea that "good sex" takes place in a monogamous relationship.&lt;ref name="heldman" /&gt;{{sfn|Freitas|2013}}  Feminist [[Gail Dines]] has opined that pornography is "a cultural force that is shaping the sexual attitudes of an entire generation" and a "major form of sex ed today for boys."&lt;ref name="Aucoin" /&gt;

===Extra effects and causes===
There are many ideas as to why people think young adults are involved in this hook up culture, such as that they feel like they have to do it to fit in.&lt;ref name="Kerner" /&gt; Some girls also reported that the main reason they are involved with random hook ups is because they think that is what boys want.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://qz.com/685852/hookup-culture/|title=Most women don’t enjoy hookup culture—so why do we force ourselves to participate?|newspaper=Quartz|language=en-US|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The feeling of being wanted by a cute guy is what they want and hook ups are how girls think they can get that attention. However, many boys and girls did report that they do hook up with random people in order to find someone they could possibly start something serious with.&lt;ref name="Kerner" /&gt; That being said not all young adults are hooking up with each other to fit the college norm, and gain sexual pleasure, but because they truly want to find someone they have a serious connection with. There was a study by University of Louisville researchers Owen and Fincham, who asked 500 undergraduate students that have been involved in hook up culture how they felt about commitment, and about 45% of men and 65% of women said they wanted their hook ups to possibly end up in a serious relationship.&lt;ref name="The Shocking Truth About Hook-Ups"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/all-about-sex/201602/the-shocking-truth-about-hook-ups|title=The Shocking Truth About Hook-Ups|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have also been a number of studies that have studied the mental aspects of casual hookups. In a study done by psychologist Seth Schwartz has shown results that say that people who had many random hook ups had more psychological issues.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/fulfillment-any-age/201303/how-casual-sex-can-affect-our-mental-health|title=How Casual Sex Can Affect Our Mental Health|website=Psychology Today|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, students in college that had stated they were involved in casual sex had higher levels of depression and anxiety and lower levels of self-esteem, happiness and [[life satisfaction]] compared to the students who did not engage in a casual hook up in the past thirty days.&lt;ref name="psychologytoday.com"/&gt; There was then a study of about 400 young adults that felt lonely and depressed and adults who had less feeling of loneliness and depression who were involved in sexual intercourse.&lt;ref name='apa' /&gt; They then researched what emotional affects being involved in sexual intercourse hookups had on them. They then came up with results that showed that penetrative sex hook ups made people with greater feelings of depression and loneliness have a decrease in those symptoms and feelings.&lt;ref name="apa" /&gt; Whereas people who expressed less symptoms of loneliness and depression had an increase in those feelings after a penetrative sex hook up.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt; Not only does it make people feel depressed but it makes them feel uncomfortable. For example, a study by Reiber and Garcia in 2010 show that a lot of people that engage in sexual hook ups feel uncomfortable.&lt;ref name="apa"/&gt; They also came to a conclusion that 78% of people in a hook up overestimate how comfortable their partner is doing certain things during their sexual engagement. Random hook ups also have shown to cause  feelings of pressure and performance anxiety in a study by Paul, et al.&lt;ref name="apa" /&gt;

Total number of sex partners among U.S. young adults since age 18:

{|

|1988-96

In this research it was demonstrated that the number of sex partners people have nowadays has barely any difference to the number of partners people had twenty to thirty years ago.&lt;ref name="The Shocking Truth About Hook-Ups"/&gt;

|quote="Hooking up" was a term known in the year 2000 to almost every American child over the age of nine, but to only a relatively small percentage of their parents, who, even if they heard it, thought it was being used in the old sense of "meeting" someone. Among the children, hooking up was always a sexual experience, but the nature and extent of what they did could vary widely.

'''''Htaingmathein''''' ({{lang-my|ထိုင်မသိမ်း}}; {{IPA-my|tʰàɪɴməθéɪɴ}}) is the name of a traditional Burmese buttonless hip-length [[jacket]], sometimes with flared bottoms and embroidered sequins. ''Htaingmathein'' in Burmese literally means "does not gather while sitting," referring to the fact that the tight-fitting jacket does not crumple up when sitting. This jacket was popular among the aristocratic classes during the [[Konbaung dynasty]], and is now most commonly worn by females as part of a [[wedding dress]], or as traditional dance costume. The ''htaingmathein'' is worn over a bodice called ''yinkhan'' ({{my|ရင်ခံ}}, {{IPA-my|jɪ̀ɴkʰàɴ|}}). Historically, the ''htaingmathein'' also had a pair of pendulous appendages on both sides called ''kalano'' ({{my|ကုလားနို့}}).

'''Iau''' (Iaw, Yau) or '''Turu''' is a [[Lakes Plain languages|Lakes Plain language]] of [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], [[Indonesia]], spoken by about 600 people. Most speakers are monolingual, and their number is growing. Other peoples in the western Lakes Plain area speak basic Iau. Iau is [[tonal language|tonal]].

Dialects are Foi (Poi), Turu, Edopi (Elopi), and Iau proper; these may be distinct enough to be considered separate languages.  Foi is spoken on the large [[Tariku River]] (Rouffaer River), Turu on the [[Van Daalen River]], Iau proper between the rivers, and Edopi at the juncture of the Tariku and Kliki (Fou) rivers.

Another name for the language is Urundi ~ Ururi. Dosobou (Dou, Doufou) is specifically Edopi.

==Phonology==
The following discussion is based on Bateman (1990a).

===Consonants===

{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center
|+ Consonant phonemes of Iau
|-
!
![[Labial consonant|Labial]]
![[Coronal consonant|Coronal]]

|-

|{{IPA link|f}}
|{{IPA link|s|s}}

|-
|}

There are six consonants. /t d/ are dental; /s/ is alveolar. /b d/ are implosive, and may be realized as nasals before the low nasal vowel /ã/. /d/ may also be realized as the liquid [l].

/f/ is pronounced [ɸ]~[h] word-initially, or as [x] before the high nonback vowels /i ɨ/. The labial allophone [ɸ] is preferred in the Foi dialect; the glottal allophone [h] is preferred in Turu. It is always pronounced [h] word-medially and as an unreleased plosive [p̚] word-finally. /f/ is the only consonant that can occur word-finally.

===Vowels===
{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center
|-

| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA link|ɔ}}
|-
![[Open vowel|Open]]
| &amp;nbsp;
| {{IPA link|ã}}
| &amp;nbsp;
|}

The low vowel is always nasalized, except when it is a component of a diphthong. The open-mid front vowel varies between [e], [ɛ], and [æ].

The following diphthongs exist:
{|class=wikitable style=text-align:center
|-
!
! ɛ
! ɪ
! ʊ
! i
! u
! i̝
|-
! a
| aɛ
| aɪ

| ai̝
|-
! ɛ
|
|
|

|
|
|-
! ɔ

|
|
| ɔi
|
|
|-
! ʊ
|
| ʊɪ
|
|
|
|
|-
! u
|
|
|
| ui
|
|
|}
No diphthongs begin with /ɪ i i̝/ or end in /a ɔ/.

There are two triphthongs: /aui/ and /aʊɪ/. The back components of these triphthongs are realized as unrounded.

=== Syllables ===
Syllables consist minimally of a vowel. They may include a single onset consonant and/or a single coda consonant. Diphthongs and triphthongs are attested. The template is (C)(V)V(V)(C). The tone-bearing unit is the syllable.

=== Stress ===
Stress in Iau is predictable: it falls on the final syllable of disyllabic words. (Words may not be longer than two syllables.) The interaction between stress and tone is not clear.

=== Tone ===
There are eight tones in Iau: two level tones (low and high), two rising tones (low rising and high rising), three falling tones (high-low, high-mid, and mid-low), and one falling-rising tone.

Tone is only lexical on nouns; the lexical forms of verbs are unmarked for tone, and each tone represents a different aspect. The complex system of aspectual marking via tone is discussed in Bateman (1986).

A sequence of two tones (called a tone cluster) may occur on one syllable. There are eleven tone clusters that can occur on verbs to mark aspect; only three of these can occur on nouns.

For generations warlike Moro [[Tribalism|tribes]] had successfully prevented [[Spain]] from fully controlling the areas around [[Mindanao]] and the [[Sulu Archipelago]], developing a well-earned reputation as notorious [[Seamanship|seafaring]] [[Raid (military)|raiders]], adept [[Navy|naval]] [[Naval tactics|tacticians]], and ferocious warriors who frequently demonstrated extraordinary personal bravery in [[Melee|combat]]. While Moro forces could never match opponents' [[firepower]] or [[Armour|armor]], such bands used [[Military intelligence|intelligence]], audacity and [[Mobility (military)|mobility]] to raid strongly defended targets and quickly defeat more vulnerable ones. One extreme [[asymmetric warfare]] tactic was the Moro juramentado.

==Etymology and usage==

Juramentado is an [[Archaism|archaic]] term derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] word ''juramentar'', meaning one who takes an oath.&lt;ref name=Tarling231&gt;{{cite book |last1=Tarling |first1=Nicholas |title=The Cambridge History of Southeast Asia: The Nineteenth and Twentieth centuries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBfsaw64rjMC&amp;pg=PA231 |format= |accessdate=May 25, 2009 |year=1992 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=0-521-35506-0 |page=231 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some sources link amoks (from the [[Malay language|Malayan]] term for "out of control") and juramentados as similar [[culture-specific syndrome]]s&lt;ref name=Corsini518&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Corsini |first=Raymond J. |encyclopedia=The Dictionary of Psychology |title=Juramentado |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cB5UOSsIN74C&amp;pg=PA518 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=1-58391-028-X|page=518 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=1921AMA405&gt;{{cite book |last1=American Medical Association |authorlink1=American Medical Association|title=Archives of Neurology and psychiatry |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0ClYAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA405 |accessdate=May 25, 2009 |volume=5 |year=1921|publisher=American Medical Association |location=Chicago, Illinois |page=405}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others draw distinctions of religious preparation and state of mind.&lt;ref name=Hurley14/&gt;&lt;ref name=Lindsay32&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lindsay |first1=Mark |authorlink1= |last2=Lester |first2=David |title=Suicide by Cop |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zY0O7OIhd2MC&amp;pg=PA32 |accessdate=May 25, 2009 |year=2004 |month= |origyear= |publisher=Baywood |location=Amityville, New York |isbn=0-89503-290-2 |page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Moro might be said to have "gone juramentado" or be "running juramentado."

U.S. Army officers who had served in [[Bangsamoro (political entity)|Moroland]] incorporated the idiom into their own vocabulary, but often simply equated it with the Moro people as a whole. In his memoirs, Army Air Service advocate [[Benjamin D. Foulois]] said of volatile rival Army Air Service officer [[Billy Mitchell]], "He had become fanatic much in the way that the Moros were in the Philippines. He had become a ''juramentado'' and was ready to run amok."&lt;ref&gt;Benjamin D. Foulois and Carroll V. Glines, "From the Wright Brothers to the Astronauts: The Memoirs of Benjamin D. Foulois" (New York: McGraw-Hill, 1968).&lt;/ref&gt;

The juramentado suicide charges were started by the Moros in the late 19th century to compensate after 1876 when they suffered reprisals from modern gunboats run by steam used by the Spanish.&lt;ref name="Kirchner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Kirchner|title=More of the Deadliest Men Who Ever Lived|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=74DKAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT132&amp;dq=bayonet+impale+reach+soldier&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiwt5O8o7bOAhWESyYKHXTRAf4Q6AEIHjAA#v=onepage&amp;q=bayonet%20impale%20reach%20soldier&amp;f=false|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Paladin Press|isbn=978-1-61004-694-7|pages=132–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Path to paradise==

Candidates, known as ''mag-sabil'', "who endure the pangs of death," were selected from [[Muslim]] youth inspired to [[martyr]]dom by the teaching of [[Imam]]s. Parents were consulted before the young men were permitted by the [[sultan]] to undergo training and preparation for ''Parang-sabil'' (the path to [[Paradise]]). After an oath taken, hand on the [[Qur'an]], the chosen took a ritual bath, all body hair was shaved, and the eyebrows trimmed to resemble "a moon two days old." A strong band was wrapped firmly around the waist, and cords wrapped tightly around the genitals, ankles, knees, upper thighs, wrists, elbows, and shoulders, restricting blood flow and preventing the ''mag-sabil'' from losing too much blood from injury before reaching their target. Clad in white robe and turban, the chosen youth would polish and sharpen his weapons before action.&lt;ref name=Hurley14/&gt;

At the moment of attack, the ''mag-sabil'' would approach a large group of enemies, shout "''La ilaha il-la'l-lahu''" ("There is no god but Allah"), draw [[kris]] or [[Barong (knife)|barong]] and then rush into the group swinging his sword, killing and maiming as many victims as possible in the time he had left. The ''mag-sabil's'' body would be washed and again wrapped in white for burial. In the unlikely event the ''mag-sabil'' survived his attack, it was believed his body would ascend to Paradise after 40 years had passed.&lt;ref name=Hurley14/&gt;

The Moros' use of local intelligence to mark target situations, coupled with a keen understanding of the tactical element of surprise made combating juramentado warriors difficult for Spanish troops during its long attempt to occupy the [[Sulu Archipelago]]. In an era of warfare where body armor had become anachronistic, an unexpected melee attack with razor-sharp blades was a devastating tactic against veteran soldiers. Even when colonizers had time to draw weapons and fire on the charging attacker, the small caliber weapons commonly in use possessed no stopping power, bullets passing through limbs and torso, the juramentados' ritual binding working as a set of tourniquets to prevent the swordsman from bleeding out from wounds before accomplishing his purpose.

In 1983, the American journalist [[Daniel P. Mannix]] released an edited version of the autobiography of his father, Rear Admiral Daniel P Mannix the 3rd.&lt;ref name="Mannix1983"&gt;{{cite book|author=Daniel Pratt Mannix|title=The Old Navy: from the personal records of Rear Admiral Daniel P Mannix III|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V8ggAAAAMAAJ|date=1 January 1983|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-0-02-579470-2|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book, called ''The Old Navy: The Glorious Heritage of the U.S. Navy, Recounted through the Journals of an American Patriot'', included the following paragraph:

{{blockquote|What finally stopped the Juramentados was the custom of wrapping the dead man in a pig's skin and stuffing his mouth with pork. As the pig was an unclean animal, this was considered an unspeakable defilement.}}

[[Vic Hurley]], an American author who was a member of the [[Philippine Constabulary]], wrote the book Jungle Patrol in 1938, arguing that Colonel Alexander Rodgers of the [[6th Cavalry Regiment]] (brother of [[Thomas S. Rodgers]]) had implemented the strategy of mass graves and pig entrails:&lt;ref name="Hurley2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vic Hurley|title=Jungle Patrol, the Story of the Philippine Constabulary (1901-1936)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=fAuBedlSboIC|date=14 June 2011|publisher=Cerberus Books|isbn=978-0-9834756-2-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bakbakan.com/junglep/jp-17.html|title=Jungle Patrol - 17.

{{blockquote|It was Colonel Alexander Rodgers of the 6th Cavalry who accomplished by taking advantage of religious prejudice what the bayonets and [[Springfield Model 1892–99|Krags]] had been unable to accomplish. Rodgers inaugurated a system of burying all dead juramentados in a common grave with the carcasses of slaughtered pigs. The Mohammedan religion forbids contact with pork; and this relatively simple device resulted in the withdrawal of juramentados to sections not containing a Rodgers. Other officers took up the principle, adding new refinements to make it additionally unattractive to the Moros. In some sections the Moro juramentado was beheaded after death and the head sewn inside the carcass of a pig. And so the rite of running juramentado, at least semi-religious in character, ceased to be in Sulu. The last cases of this religious mania occurred in the early decades of the century. The juramentados were replaced by the amucks. .. who were simply homicidal maniacs with no religious significance attaching to their acts.}}

After the [[September 11 attacks]] on the United States, a number of American [[urban legend]]s began circulating that [[John J. Pershing]] had ordered the [[summary execution]] of captured enemies using bullets laced with pig blood, and whose bodies were placed in a mass grave filled with pig entrails.&lt;ref name=about&gt;David Emery, [http://urbanlegends.about.com/library/bl_black_jack_pershing.htm "Black Jack Pershing vs. Muslim Terrorists"], about.com.

Vandiver, professor of history at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] and author of ''Black Jack: The Life and Times of John J. Pershing'' said about the burial of Juramentados with pig remains that he never found any indication that it was true in extensive research on his Moro experiences, and that such an event would be out of keeping with Pershing's character. Rather, most sources indicate the idea of using pigs was suggested to Pershing but he rejected it.&lt;ref name="O'Connor1961"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard O'Connor|title=Black Jack Pershing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K6l1AAAAMAAJ&amp;q=General+Bliss,+commanding+the+Philippine+Division,+suggested+to++Pershing+on+May+23,+1911,+that+he+adopt+the+methods+used+by+the++British+in+India+to+deal+with+Mohammedan+fanaticism.+Juramentados,++Bliss+recommended,+should+be+buried+with+the+carcass+of+a+pig&amp;dq=General+Bliss,+commanding+the+Philippine+Division,+suggested+to++Pershing+on+May+23,+1911,+that+he+adopt+the+methods+used+by+the++British+in+India+to+deal+with+Mohammedan+fanaticism.+Juramentados,++Bliss+recommended,+should+be+buried+with+the+carcass+of+a+pig&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjPmOv91dzLAhXDFz4KHb78Cf8Q6AEIHDAA|year=1961|publisher=Doubleday|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://leminhkhai.wordpress.com/2016/02/23/john-pershing-and-the-myth-of-bullets-dipped-in-pigs-blood/|title=Page not found – Le Minh Khai's SEAsian History Blog|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yet John Pershing did not say that he had ordered the practice, but that « the army had already adopted » the practice, and that « it was not pleasant », as he states quite clearly in his ''Memoir'':&lt;ref name=autobio&gt;Pershing, John, [https://books.google.com/books?id=a74_JIbehzsC&amp;q=materially+reduced+#v=snippet&amp;q=materially%20reduced&amp;f=false ''My Life Before the World War, 1860–1917 - A Memoir''], University Press of Kentucky, 2013, pp. 284-285 {{isbn|9780813141978}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

{{blockquote|These ''juramentado'' attacks were materially reduced in number by a practice the army had already adopted, one that Muhhamadans held in abhorrence. The bodies were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins.&lt;ref name=autobio /&gt;}}

In the 2013 publishing of his ''Memoir'', a footnote cites a letter from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell to J. Pershing: 

{{blockquote|Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom. It is the only possible thing we can do to discourage crazy fanatics.&lt;ref name=autobio /&gt;}}

[[M1911]] was developed in order to nullify juramentados, for six-shooters and revolvers are useless against them.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16629">A '''Knowledge Building Community''' (''KBC'') is a community in which the primary goal is knowledge creation rather than the construction of specific products or the completion of tasks.  This notion is fundamental in [[Knowledge building]] theory. If knowledge is not realized for a community then we do not have knowledge building. Examples of KBCs are

==Theoretical Background==
Knowledge Building is a theory developed by Carl Bereiter and Marlene Scardamalia that deals with the construction of knowledge. To build knowledge, learners should collaborate with one another and establish common goals, hold group discussions, and synthesize ideas in such a way that their knowledge of a topic advances from their current understanding. Knowledge building is outwardly focused on generating contributions that learners can give back to the community. Thus, the product of knowledge building should be an “artifact”—such as a publication, an illustrated model, or a theory—which other learners can then use to advance their own understanding of that subject. Among the most widely cited models characterizing the processes of collaborative knowledge building are those of Garrison, Anderson &amp; Archer (2001) ;&lt;ref&gt;Garrison, D. R., Anderson, T., &amp; Archer, W. (2001). Critical thinking, cognitive presence, and computer conferencing in distance education. American Journal of Distance Education, 15(1).&lt;/ref&gt; Gunawardena, Lowe, &amp; Anderson (1997);&lt;ref&gt;Gunawardena, L., Lowe, C., &amp; Anderson, T. (1997).

==Principles of Knowledge Building Communities==
A school culture that fosters KBCs supports research, innovation, and high expectations for student achievement and participation. The twelve KB principles are continuously emphasized for and by teachers, students, and the school environment as a whole.
 
12 Knowledge Building Principles (Adapted from Scardamalia, 2002)&lt;ref&gt;Scardamalia, M. (2002). Collective cognitive responsibility for the advancement of knowledge. Liberal education in a knowledge society, 67-98.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Real Ideas and Authentic Problems – students identify real problems to study
*Improvable Ideas – ideas are improvable rather than accepted or rejected
*Epistemic Agency – students plan and engage in the process
*Collective Responsibility for Community Knowledge – all participants contribute to community goals
*Democratizing Knowledge – all participants are empowered; no knowledge have/have-not lines
*Idea Diversity – knowledge advancement depends on diversity of ideas, just as an ecosystem depends on biodiversity
*KB Discourse – problems progressively identified and addressed and new conceptualizations built
*Rise Above – by transcending trivialities and oversimplifications, students work towards more inclusive principles and higher level formulations of problems
*Constructive Use of Authoritative Sources – critically evaluate authoritative sources, don't just find “the answer”
*Pervasive KB – KB is a continuous process and can happen anywhere; it is not unique to the classroom
*Symmetric Knowledge Advance – “to give knowledge is to get knowledge”; there is no one expert
*Embedded and Transformative Assessment – integral to KB and helps to advance knowledge through identifying advances, problems, and gaps as work proceeds

==Knowledge building communities in classrooms==
The key focus for KBCs has been research on fostering KBCs in classrooms. Transforming a classroom into a KBC requires a significant shift in classroom norms and also in student and teacher identities. In this context, students define themselves through their personal learning goals and collaboratively pursue them. Students are viewed as intentional learners, working at the edge of each competence. Knowledge advances are not circumscribed by a teacher’s knowledge. 
 
Specific to a KBC is the objectification of knowledge artifacts. More precisely, if in a regular class, questions, ideas and discussions are personal and ethereal constructs, in a KBC classroom, they are public artifacts that have a permanent presence in a digital format, usually in the classroom database. For this reason, they can be analyzed, pointed at, talked about, and progressively refined over time. In order to be successful, the members of the knowledge building community should accomplish the following: 
*Focus work on making advances to what the community already knows
*Embrace a general philosophy of inclusion
*Share openly what they do not understand, "What I need to understand..." or "What I need to know..."
*Respect each other's perspectives and tentative understandings
*Express disagreement in a constructive fashion
 
Successful knowledge building initiatives at an elementary school “demonstrated sustained advancement of knowledge building as a principle-based, school-wide innovation.”&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, J., Hong, H., Scardamalia, M., Teo, C., &amp; Morley, E. A. (2011) Sustaining Knowledge Building as a Principle-Based Innovation at an Elementary School, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 20(2), 262-307.&lt;/ref&gt; Rather than focusing on a particular procedure or pedagogical approach to KBC, this study emphasized using a principle-based approach. This approach “defines core values and principles, leaving teachers the challenge of engaging in reflective interpretation, using discretionary judgment, and making adaptive classroom decisions to accommodate their different contexts and possibilities.”&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, J., Hong, H., Scardamalia, M., Teo, C., &amp; Morley, E. A. (2011) Sustaining Knowledge Building as a Principle-Based Innovation at an Elementary School, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 20(2), 262-307.&lt;/ref&gt; The KBC model immerses students in collaborative efforts to extend knowledge of the classroom community rather than just individual learning. Students take ownership of their learning and knowledge building by completing the tasks of goal setting, long-term planning, and impromptu process control, rather than following predetermined scripts for learning set by the teacher. Understanding, integrating, and sharing information are all vital components of sustained KBC models.&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, J., &amp; Sun, Y. (2011). Reading for idea advancement in a grade 4 Knowledge Building community. Instructional Science, 39(4), 429-452.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Because learners at the post-secondary level are more cognitively mature than younger students, researchers have observed many successful implementations of KBCs in higher education. Stefano Cacciamani published a study in 2010 that explored how an instructor could make the shift from knowledge transition to knowledge construction. In the study, students enrolled in an online course initially modeled after a guided inquiry format, in which the teacher played a significant role in setting students' goals and monitoring their progress. This format eventually shifted to a self-organized inquiry model focused on knowledge construction, where students were expected to replace the teacher in setting class goals and monitoring their own progress. This fundamental change entailed the instructor’s concession of increasing responsibility to students. The study’s results indicate that students in the self-organized course engaged in critical thinking and displayed a greater effort to go beyond the given information than students in the guided inquiry course. To that effect, the authors concluded "...there is a suggestion in the early pilot work reported, that the self-organized inquiry approach favours a shift towards a knowledge construction perspective more so than the guided inquiry approach."&lt;ref&gt;Cacciamani, S. (2010). Towards a knowledge building community: from guided to self-organized inquiry. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology/La revue canadienne de l’apprentissage et de la technologie, 36(1).&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
Participants in a 2012 study by Philip used Knowledge Forum, an online environment designed to support knowledge building, to read, post, and respond to notes over the course of one semester.&lt;ref&gt;Philip, D. (2012). Pilgrims' Progress: The Journey towards a Knowledge Building Community in a University Undergraduate Class. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology, 38(1), n1.&lt;/ref&gt; The author identified several likely indicators of the presence of a KBC, including:
*A high level of overall activity (at least 50% of students read 60 or more postings)
*Universal participation (online participation comprised 40% of the students’ final grades)
*The presence of reciprocal strong ties among students that indicate the potential for the transfer of complex information and “collective responsibility for the development of the community”&lt;ref&gt;Philip, D. (2012). Pilgrims' Progress: The Journey towards a Knowledge Building Community in a University Undergraduate Class. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology, 38(1), n1., p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Limitations===
Despite some promising results, efforts to implement KBCs in classrooms have also seen unintended consequences. Disparities in participation and maladaptive strategies aimed at reducing individual workload can lessen the effectiveness of KBCs for the community as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Philip, D. (2012). Pilgrims' Progress: The Journey towards a Knowledge Building Community in a University Undergraduate Class. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology, 38(1), n1.&lt;/ref&gt; Student relationships have a significant effect on participation patterns, and individual feelings of autonomy, relatedness, and intrinsic motivation all influence behaviors in KBCs.&lt;ref&gt;Xie, K., &amp; Ke, F. (2011). The role of students' motivation in peer‐moderated asynchronous online discussions. British Journal of Educational Technology,42(6), 916-930.&lt;/ref&gt; Diversity among peers, response lags, and deadlines can be negative influences on collaboration causing stress, frustration, and difficulties in negotiating meaning and consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, O. A. (2007). Students' perceptions of online asynchronous discussion and group learning in graduate distance education courses, 1-185.&lt;/ref&gt; Without effective guidance from teachers, students tend to focus on individualistic contributions related to their areas of personal interest rather than developing a shared understanding or pursuing a common line of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, O. A. (2007). Students' perceptions of online asynchronous discussion and group learning in graduate distance education courses, 1-185.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The collaborative technology itself could also be problematic. The tool of choice may be difficult to use and thus pose a slow learning curve for collaborators. In a review of fifty studies, Hew, Cheung, &amp; Ng (2010) identified a series of "design quirks" common to these tools that frustrate students, such as the inaccessibility of other posts and features while in composition mode and the inability to edit and delete messages after posting.&lt;ref&gt;Hew, K. F., Cheung, W. S., &amp; Ng, C. S. L. (2010). Student contribution in asynchronous online discussion: A review of the research and empirical exploration. Instructional Science, 38(6), 571-606.&lt;/ref&gt; Unforeseen glitches in the technology can also add strain to the collaborative process.

==Computer Support for Knowledge Building Communities==
Scardamalia, Bereiter, and their team at the Center for Applied Cognitive Science at the University of Toronto developed a networked software system called Computer Supported Intentional Learning Environments, or CSILE, in the 1980s. In the 1990s, the system was re-engineered and released for commercial use as Knowledge Forum™. This software provides support for cognitive processes involved in knowledge building, making these visible to both the instructors and the students. Discussions, comments, knowledge artifacts, and knowledge advances are all visible and improvable within Knowledge Forum. The software also includes tools that can be used for formative (self-)assessment of the quantity of activity of students and the connections between them.&lt;ref&gt;Philip, D. (2012). Pilgrims' Progress: The Journey towards a Knowledge Building Community in a University Undergraduate Class. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology, 38(1), n1.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge Forum has been used as a tool to support knowledge building communities in K-12&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, J., Hong, H., Scardamalia, M., Teo, C., &amp; Morley, E. A. (2011) Sustaining Knowledge Building as a Principle-Based Innovation at an Elementary School, Journal of the Learning Sciences, 20(2), 262-307.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, J., Scardamalia, M., Reeve, R., &amp; Messina, R. (2009). Designs for collective cognitive responsibility in knowledge-building communities. The Journal of the Learning Sciences, 18(1), 7-44.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zhang, J., &amp; Sun, Y. (2011). Reading for idea advancement in a grade 4 Knowledge Building community. Instructional Science, 39(4), 429-452.&lt;/ref&gt; and higher-education settings.&lt;ref&gt;Philip, D. (2012). Pilgrims' Progress: The Journey towards a Knowledge Building Community in a University Undergraduate Class. Canadian Journal of Learning and Technology, 38(1), n1.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mylläri, J., Åhlberg, M., &amp; Dillon, P. (2010). The dynamics of an online knowledge building community: A 5‐year longitudinal study. British Journal of Educational Technology, 41(3), 365-387.&lt;/ref&gt; 
 
With the rapid growth of social networking software, a wide range of Web 2.0 tools with the capability to support community knowledge building have become available. Blogs, micro-blogs, wikis, and virtual worlds are just some of the Web 2.0 tools that have been implemented in K-12, higher education, and corporate settings. Likewise, learning management systems commonly contain tools for discussion that have been used as the platform for KBCs, though the alignment of these tools with the requirements of community knowledge building has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Onrubia, J., &amp; Engel, A. (2009). Strategies for collaborative writing and phases of knowledge construction in CSCL environments. Computers &amp; Education, 53(4), 1256-1265.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hewitt, J. (1997) Beyond threaded discourse, In: Proceedings of WebNet '97.&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge mapping software can increase the number of hypotheses generated in group problem solving as well as the likelihood that a group will converge on a consensus.&lt;ref&gt;Suthers, D. D., Vatrapu, R., Medina, R., Joseph, S., &amp; Dwyer, N. (2008). Beyond threaded discussion: Representational guidance in asynchronous collaborative learning environments. Computers &amp; Education, 50(4), 1103-1127.
&lt;/ref&gt; Real-time collaborative editing platforms, like Google Docs, enable multiple people to work on a document simultaneously. These tools allow "evolving documents" to be refined repeatedly by multiple collaborators, and come equipped with built-in chat functionality, commenting, and reviewing tools for facilitating knowledge construction through suggestion-making.&lt;ref&gt;Heimbuch, S., Uhde, K., &amp; Bodemer, D. (2014). “A new Wiki way?” - An experimental study of collaborative knowledge building scripts. In ''Proceedings of the 22nd International Conference on Computers in Education (ICCE 2014)'' (Vol. WIPP), 10–12. Nara, Japan: Asia-Pacific Society for Computers in Education.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Louse''' (plural: '''lice''') is the common name for members of the [[order (biology)|order]] Phthiraptera, which contains nearly 5,000 species of wingless [[insect]]. Lice are [[obligate parasite]]s, living externally on warm-blooded [[Host (biology)|hosts]] which include every species of [[bird]] and [[mammal]], except for [[monotreme]]s, [[pangolin]]s, and [[bat]]s. Lice are [[Vector (epidemiology)|vectors]] of diseases such as [[typhus]].

Chewing lice live among the hairs or feathers of their host and feed on skin and debris, while sucking lice pierce the host's skin and feed on blood and other secretions. They usually spend their whole life on a single host, cementing their eggs, which are known as nits, to hairs or feathers. The eggs hatch into [[Nymph (biology)|nymphs]], which moult three times before becoming fully grown, a process that takes about four weeks.

Humans host three species of louse, the [[head louse]], the [[body louse]] and the [[Crab louse|pubic louse]]. The body louse has the smallest [[genome]] of any known insect; it has been used as a [[model organism]] and has been the subject of much research.

Lice were ubiquitous in human society until at least the [[Middle Ages]]. They appear in folktales, songs such as ''The Kilkenny Louse House'', and novels such as [[James Joyce]]'s ''[[Finnegans Wake]]''. They commonly feature in the psychiatric disorder [[delusional parasitosis]]. A louse was one of the early subjects of [[microscope|microscopy]], appearing in [[Robert Hooke]]'s 1667 book, ''[[Micrographia]]''.

==Morphology and diversity==
{{about||information about human infestation|Pediculosis|information on treatment|Treatment of human head lice}}

Humans host three different kinds of lice: [[Head louse|head lice]], [[body louse|body lice]], and [[Crab louse|pubic lice]]. Lice infestations can be controlled with [[Nit comb|lice combs]], and medicated shampoos or washes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author= Mumcuoglu, Kosta Y. |year=1999 |title=Prevention and Treatment of Head Lice in Children |journal=Pediatric Drugs |volume=1 |issue=3 |pages=211–218 |doi=10.2165/00128072-199901030-00005 |pmid=10937452}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sucking lice are small wingless insects ranging from {{convert|0.5|to|5|mm|in|2|abbr=on}} in length. They have narrow heads and oval, flattened bodies. They have no [[Simple eye in invertebrates|ocelli]], and their compound eyes are reduced in size or absent. Their [[Antenna (biology)|antennae]] are short with three to five segments, and their mouth parts, which are retractable into their head, are adapted for piercing and sucking.&lt;ref name=Capinera/&gt; There is a cibarial pump at the start of the gut; it is powered by muscles attached to the inside of the cuticle of the head. The mouthparts consist of a proboscis which is toothed, and a set of stylets arranged in a cylinder inside the proboscis, containing a salivary canal ([[ventral]]ly) and a food canal ([[dorsally]]).&lt;ref name=GullanCranston&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gullan |first1=P. J. |last2=Cranston |first2=P. S. |title=The Insects: An Outline of Entomology |date=2014 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=978-1-118-84615-5 |pages=41–42}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thoracic segments are fused, the abdominal segments are separate, and there is a single large claw at the tip of each of the six legs.&lt;ref name=Capinera&gt;{{cite book|author=Capinera, John L. |title=Encyclopedia of Entomology |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i9ITMiiohVQC&amp;pg=PA838 |year=2008 |publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-1-4020-6242-1 |pages=838–844}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chewing lice are also flattened and can be slightly larger than sucking lice, ranging in length from {{convert|0.5|to|6|mm|in|2|abbr=on}}. They are similar to sucking lice in form but the head is wider than the thorax and all species have compound eyes. There are no ocelli and the mouthparts are adapted for chewing. The antennae have three to five segments and are slender in the suborder [[Ischnocera]], but club-shaped in the suborder [[Amblycera]]. The legs are short and robust, and terminated by one or two claws. Many lice are specific to a single species of host and have co-evolved with it. They are usually [[Crypsis|cryptically coloured]] to match the fur or feathers of the host.&lt;ref name=Capinera/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phthiraptera.info/classification/23 |title=Phthiraptera: Summary |author=Smith, Vince |publisher=Phthiraptera.info |accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lice are divided into two groups: sucking lice, which obtain their nourishment from feeding on the [[Sebaceous gland|sebaceous secretions]] and body fluids of their host; and chewing lice, which are [[scavenger]]s, feeding on [[skin]], fragments of feathers or hair, and debris found on the host's body. Most are found on only specific types of animals, and, in some cases, on only a particular part of the body; some animals are known to host up to fifteen different species, although one to three is typical for mammals, and two to six for birds. For example, in humans, different species of louse inhabit the scalp and pubic hair. Lice generally cannot survive for long if removed from their host.&lt;ref name=IIBD&gt;{{cite book |author1=Hoell, H.V. |author2=Doyen, J.T. |author3=Purcell, A.H. |year=1998 |title=Introduction to Insect Biology and Diversity |edition=2nd |publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] |pages= 407–409|isbn= 0-19-510033-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some species of chewing lice house [[Symbiosis|symbiotic]] bacteria in [[bacteriocyte]]s in their bodies. These may assist in digestion because if the insect is deprived of them, it will die. If their host dies, lice can opportunistically use [[Phoresis (biology)|phoresis]] to hitch a ride on a fly and attempt to find a new host.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ecology and Evolution of Transmission in Feather-feeding Lice (Phthiraptera: Ischnocera)|author=University of Utah |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RUfFjqPoQTEC&amp;pg=PA83 |year=2008 |publisher=ProQuest |isbn=978-0-549-46429-7 |pages=83–87}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A louse's color varies from pale beige to dark gray; however, if feeding on blood, it may become considerably darker. Female lice are usually more common than males, and some species are [[parthenogenesis|parthenogenetic]], with young developing from unfertilized eggs. A louse's [[egg]] is commonly called a nit. Many lice attach their eggs to their hosts' hair with specialized [[saliva]]; the saliva/hair bond is very difficult to sever without specialized products. Lice inhabiting birds, however, may simply leave their eggs in parts of the body inaccessible to [[Personal grooming|preening]], such as the interior of feather shafts. Living louse eggs tend to be pale whitish, whereas dead louse eggs are yellower.&lt;ref name=IIBD/&gt; Lice are [[Exopterygota|exopterygote]]s, being born as miniature versions of the adult, known as [[nymph (biology)|nymphs]]. The young moult three times before reaching the final adult form, usually within a month after hatching.&lt;ref name=IIBD/&gt;

==Ecology==

The average number of lice per host tends to be higher in large-bodied bird species than in small ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Rózsa  | year = | title = Patterns in the abundance of avian lice (Phthiraptera: Amblycera, Ischnocera) | url = http://www.zoologia.hu/list/patterns%20in%20the%20abundance.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Avian Biology | volume = 28 | issue = | pages = 249–254 | doi=10.2307/3676976}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lice have an aggregated distribution across bird individuals, i.e. most lice live on a few birds, while most birds are relatively free of lice.

==Evolution==

===Classification===
The order Phthiraptera is clearly a [[Monophyly|monophyletic]] grouping, united as the members are by a number of derived features including their parasitism on [[warm-blooded]] vertebrates and the combination of their [[metathoracic ganglion|metathoracic]] [[Ganglion|ganglia]] with their [[abdominal ganglia]] to form a single ventral nerve junction.&lt;ref name=Ax&gt;{{cite book|author=Ax, Peter |title=Multicellular Animals: Volume II: The Phylogenetic System of the Metazoa |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7vtCAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA303 |year=2013|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media |isbn=978-3-662-10396-8 |pages=303–307 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The order has traditionally been divided into two suborders, the sucking lice (Anoplura) and the [[mastication|chewing]] (Mallophaga); however, recent classifications suggest that the Mallophaga are [[Paraphyly|paraphyletic]] and four suborders are now recognized:&lt;ref name=info&gt;{{cite web |url=http://phthiraptera.info/ |title=Phthiraptera.info |author=Smith, Vince |publisher=International Society of Phthirapterists |accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Anoplura]]: [[sucking]] lice, occurring on mammals exclusively
* [[Haematomyzus|Rhynchophthirina]]: parasites of elephants and [[warthog]]s
* [[Ischnocera]]: mostly avian chewing lice, however, one family parasitizes mammals
* [[Amblycera]]: a primitive suborder of chewing lice, widespread on birds, however, also live on South-American and Australian mammals

Nearly 5,000 species of louse have been identified, about 4,000 being parasitic on birds and 800 on mammals. Lice are present on every continent in all the habitats that their host animals and birds occupy.&lt;ref name=info/&gt; They are found even in the [[Antarctic]], where [[penguin]]s carry 15 species of lice (in the genera ''[[Austrogonoides]]'' and ''[[Nesiotinus]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Banks |first1=Jonathan C. |last2=Paterson|first2=Adrian M. |title=A penguin-chewing louse (Insecta : Phthiraptera) phylogeny derived from morphology |journal=Invertebrate Systematics |date=2004 |volume=18 |issue=1 |pages=89–100 |doi=10.1071/IS03022 |url=http://www.publish.csiro.au/paper/IS03022.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===Phylogeny===

Lice have been the subject of significant [[DNA]] research in the 2000s that led to discoveries on human evolution. The three species of sucking lice that parasitize human beings belong to two genera, ''Pediculus'' and ''Pthirus'': head lice (''Pediculus humanus capitis''), body lice (''Pediculus humanus corporis''), and pubic lice (''Pthirus pubis''). Human head and body lice (genus ''Pediculus'') share a common ancestor with chimpanzee lice, while pubic lice (genus ''Pthirus'') share a common ancestor with gorilla lice. Using phylogenetic and cophylogenetic analysis, Reed et al. hypothesized that ''Pediculus'' and ''Pthirus'' are sister taxa and monophyletic.&lt;ref name="Reed D.L. 2007"/&gt; In other words, the two genera descended from the same common ancestor. The age of divergence between ''Pediculus'' and its common ancestor is estimated to be 6-7 million years ago, which matches the age predicted by [[Chimpanzee–human last common ancestor|chimpanzee-hominid divergence]].&lt;ref name="Reed D.L. 2007"/&gt; Because parasites rely on their hosts, host-parasite cospeciation events are likely.

Genetic evidence suggests that our human ancestors acquired pubic lice from [[gorilla]]s approximately 3-4 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Reed D.L. 2007"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Pair of lice lost or parasites regained: the evolutionary history of anthropoid primate lice |author1=Reed D.L. |author2=Light, J.E. |author3=Allen, J.M. |author4=Kirchman, J.J. |journal=[[BMC Biology]] |volume=5 |issue=7 |doi=10.1186/1741-7007-5-7 |year=2007 |url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/1741-7007/5/7 |pmid=17343749 |pmc=1828715}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike the genus ''Pediculus'', the divergence in ''Pthirus'' does not match the age of host divergence that likely occurred 7 million years ago. Reed et al. propose a ''Pthirus'' species host-switch around 3-4 million years ago. While it is difficult to determine if a parasite-host switch occurred in evolutionary history, this explanation is the most parsimonious (containing the fewest evolutionary changes).&lt;ref name="Reed D.L. 2007"/&gt;

Additionally, the DNA differences between head lice and body lice provide corroborating evidence that humans used clothing between 80,000 and 170,000 years ago, before leaving Africa.&lt;ref name=Parry&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parry |first1=Wynne |title=Lice Reveal Clues to Human Evolution |url=http://www.livescience.com/41028-lice-reveal-clues-to-human-evolution.html |publisher=LiveScience |accessdate=25 October 2015 |date=7 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Human head and body lice occupy distinct ecological zones: head lice live and feed on the scalp, while body lice live on clothing and feed on the body. Because body lice require clothing to survive, the divergence of head and body lice from their common ancestor provides an estimate of the date of introduction of clothing in human evolutionary history.&lt;ref name=Parry/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kittler R. 2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kittler, R. |author2=Kayser, M. |author3=Stoneking, M. |year=2003 |title=Molecular Evolution of ''Pediculus humanus'' and the Origin of Clothing |journal=Current Biology |volume=13 |issue=16 |pages=1414–1417 |doi=10.1016/S0960-9822(03)00507-4 |pmid=12932325}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mitochondrial genome of the human species of body lice (''[[Pediculus humanus|Pediculus humanus humanus]]''), the head louse (''[[Pediculus humanus|Pediculus humanus capitis]]'') and the pubic louse (''[[Pthirus pubis]]'') fragmented into a number of minichromosomes, at least seven million years ago.&lt;ref name=Shao2012&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Shao, R. |author2=Zhu, X.Q. |author3=Barker, S.C. |author4=Herd, K. |year=2012 |title=Evolution of extensively fragmented mitochondrial genomes in the lice of humans |journal=Genome Biology and Evolution |volume=4 |issue=11 |pages=1088–1101 |doi=10.1093/gbe/evs088 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Analysis of mitochondrial DNA in human body and hair lice reveals that greater genetic diversity existed in African than in non-African lice.&lt;ref name="Kittler R. 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Light&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Light, J.E. |author2=Allen, J.M. |author3=Long, L.M. |author4=Carter, T.E. |author5=Barrow, L. |author6=Suren, G. |author7=Raoult, D. |author8=Reed, D.L |year=2008 |title=Geographic distribution and origins of human head lice (''Pediculus humanus capitis'') based on mitochondrial data |journal=Journal of Parasitology |volume=94 |issue=6 |pages=1275–1281 |doi=10.1645/GE-1618.1 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Human lice can also shed light on human migratory patterns in pre-history. The dominating theory of [[Anthropology|anthropologists]] regarding human migration is the [[Recent African origin of modern humans|Out of Africa Hypothesis]]. Genetic diversity accumulates over time, and mutations occur at a relatively constant rate. Because there is more genetic diversity in African lice, the lice and their human hosts must have existed in Africa before anywhere else.&lt;ref name=Light/&gt;

Lice have been intimately associated with human society throughout history. In the [[Middle Ages]], they were essentially ubiquitous. At the death of [[Thomas Becket]], [[Archbishop of Canterbury]] in 1270, it was recorded that "The vermin boiled over like water in a simmering cauldron, and the onlookers burst into alternate weeping and laughing".&lt;ref name=Kowalski&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kowalski |first1=Todd J. |last2=Agger |first2=William A. |title=Art Supports New Plague Science |journal=Clin.

In 1935 the Harvard medical researcher [[Hans Zinsser]] wrote the book ''Rats, Lice and History'', alleging that both body and head lice transmit typhus between humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Zinsser |first1=Hans |title=Rats, Lice and History |date=2007 |origyear=1935 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-1-4128-0672-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, the modern view is that only the body louse can transmit the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Altschuler |first1=Deborah Z.|title=Zinsser, Lice and History |url=http://www.headlice.org/faq/disease/zinsser.htm |publisher=HeadLice.org |accessdate=19 October 2015 |date=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soldiers in the trenches of the [[First World War]] suffered severely from lice, and the [[typhus]] they carried. The Germans boasted that they had lice under effective control, but themselves suffered badly from lice in the [[Second World War]] on the Eastern Front, especially in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]]. "[[Delousing]]" became a grim [[euphemism]] for the extermination of Jews in [[concentration camp]]s such as [[Auschwitz]] under the Nazi regime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Evans |first1=Richard J. |authorlink1=Richard J.

In the psychiatric disorder [[delusional parasitosis]], patients express a persistent irrational fear of animals such as lice and mites, imagining that they are continually infested and complaining of itching, with "an unshakable false belief that live organisms are present in the skin".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weinstein |first1=Phillip |title=Entomophobia/Delusionary Parasitosis; Illusionary Parasitosis |url=http://medent.usyd.edu.au/fact/delpara.htm |publisher=University of Sydney Department of Medical Entomology |accessdate=17 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish songwriter John Lyons (b. 1934) wrote the popular&lt;ref name=Clare/&gt; song ''The Kilkenny Louse House''. The song contains the lines "Well we went up the stairs and we put out the light, Sure in less than five minutes, I had to show fight. For the fleas and the bugs they collected to march, And over me stomach they formed a great arch". It has been recorded by Christie Purcell (1952), Mary Delaney on ''From Puck to Appleby'' (2003), and the [[Dubliners]] on ''[[Double Dubliners]]'' (1972) among others.&lt;ref name=Clare&gt;{{cite web |last1=Carroll |first1=Jim |title=Songs of Clare: The Kilkenny Louse House |url=http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/songs/cmc/the_kilkenny_louse_house_jlyons.htm |publisher=Clare Library |accessdate=19 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=Bruce |title=My Colleen by the Shore |url=http://www.veteran.co.uk/VT149CD%20Paginated%20booklet%20pages.pdf |publisher=Veteran |year=2013 |accessdate=25 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Robert Burns]] dedicated a poem to the Louse, inspired by witnessing one on a lady's bonnet in church: "Ye ugly, creepin, blastid wonner, Detested, shunn'd, by saint and sinner, How dare ye set your fit upon her, sae fine lady! Gae somewhere else, and seek your dinner on some poor body." [[John Milton]] in ''[[Paradise Lost]]'' mentioned the biblical plague of lice visited upon pharaoh: "Frogs, lice, and flies must all his palace fill with loathed intrusion, and filled all the land." [[John Ray]] recorded a Scottish proverb, "Gie a beggar a bed and he'll repay you with a Louse."
In [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Troilus and Cressida]]'', [[Thersites]] compares [[Menelaus]], brother of [[Agamemnon]], to a louse: "Ask me not what I would be, if I were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=Insect Life in the Poetry and Drama of England: With Special Reference to Poetry |last=Twinn  |first=Cecil Raymond |publisher=University of Ottawa (PhD Thesis) |year=1942 |url=http://hdl.handle.net/10393/21088}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mercerie bonneterie --Romanceor.jpg|thumb|450px|A mercery (mercer's shop) in Brussels]]
'''Mercery''' (from French ''mercerie'', the [[Notions (sewing)|notions]] trade) initially referred to [[silk]], [[linen]], and [[fustian]] textiles imported to [[England]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;The Mercery of London, Anne F. Sutton, pg. 2&lt;/ref&gt;

The term [[wikt:mercery|mercery]] later extended to goods made of these and the sellers of those goods.

==Mercer==
The term [[wikt:mercer|'''mercer''']] for cloth merchants (from French ''mercier'', "notions dealer") is now largely obsolete. Mercers were formerly merchants or traders who dealt in cloth, typically fine cloth that was not produced locally. Inventories of mercers in small towns, however, suggest that many were shopkeepers who dealt in various dry commodities other than cloth.&lt;ref&gt;Europe's Rich Fabric: The Consumption, Commercialisation, and Production of Luxury Textiles in Italy, the Low Countries and Neighbouring Territories (Fourteenth-Sixteenth Centuries.) pp. 24–25.&lt;/ref&gt; Related occupations include [[haberdasher]], [[draper]] and [[cloth merchant]], while [[cloth merchant|clothier]] historically referred to someone who manufactured [[cloth production|cloth]], often under the [[domestic system]].

By the 21st century the word ''mercer'' was primarily used in connection with the [[Worshipful Company of Mercers]], one of the twelve great [[Livery company|Livery Companies]] of the [[City of London]].

{{nihongo|'''''Metal Slug 5'''''|メタルスラッグ 5}} is a [[Run and gun (video game)|run and gun]] [[video game]] for the [[Neo Geo (console)|Neo-Geo]] console/arcade platform created by [[SNK Playmore]]. It was released in 2003 for the MVS arcade platform, is the fifth game in the [[Metal Slug (series)|Metal Slug series]], and was one of the last games for the Neo Geo system. The game was developed by [[Noise Factory]]/[[SNK Playmore]], after Korean company [[Mega Enterprise]] had directed ''[[Metal Slug 4]]''.

The biggest difference from previous titles is the addition of the slide move, which allows the player to evade and maneuver in a new fashion. Unlike its predecessor ''[[Metal Slug 4]]'', which reused many of the backgrounds from the previous games, ''Metal Slug 5'' incorporates a wealth of new environments and backgrounds and features a more [[heavy metal music|Heavy metal]] influenced soundtrack.

It was later ported to [[Xbox (console)|Microsoft Xbox]] in Japan and North America only (not compatible with [[Xbox 360]]) and [[PlayStation 2|Sony PlayStation 2]] as a stand-alone game in Japan and Europe, and along with ''Metal Slug 4'' as a [[compilation (games)|compilation]] in North America and South Korea. It was also ported to [[Microsoft Windows]] for a Korean release.

==Plot==
One year after the event of [[Metal Slug 7]]. A special disc that contains deep and intricate secrets about the Metal Slug project is stolen by a mysterious group called the Ptolemaic Army, whose speciality lies from within archaeological excavation and espionage. Marco and Tarma of the Peregrine Falcon Strike Force follow in hot pursuit against the group and in the process are joined by Eri and Fio of SPARROWS. Together once more, the quartet investigate the shrouded objective of the Ptolemaic Army, who over time grows more powerful as they are joined by a mysterious masked man and his followers. At the end of the game, the Ptolemaic Army summons a giant demon as the final boss, which after a long battle is forced to leave Earth thanks to the heroes.

==Differences from previous games==
*The player may now perform a slide-dash.
*"[[Obese|Fat]] mode" is the only remaining modifier, there are no zombies, mummies, aliens or other supernatural creatures, although the final boss is a large demon.
*Morden's infantry, Morden himself and Allen O'Neil are nowhere to be found in this game; rather, one fights armies of veiled terrorists, special forces, and assorted mecha. As a result, this game lacks much of the sense of humor of its predecessors. However, most of the new enemies are mostly edits of Rebel soldier sprites.
*With the exception of the first and third levels, the game does not have branching paths.
*The "Flame shot" has been omitted. According to the Debug level, the Flame Shot is present in the code.
*The medal system from Metal Slug 4 has been abandoned.
*Playable characters Trevor and Nadia have been omitted in favor of Eri and Tarma.
*There are cutscenes at various points throughout the game, rather than one or two at the end, giving the game a hint of progression of plot.
*A remixed version of "Final Attack" is played whilst facing the final boss.
*Depending on whether the Arcade machine has the "Blood" option turned on or off, not only the blood color will change from red to white, but the Ptolemaic Army's guerilla's T-shirt and bandanas will change from red to navy.

==New vehicles and Slugs==
Only three new vehicles were added, though the Metal Slug, Slug Mariner, and Slug Flyer make a return.
*The first new vehicle, the Slug Gunner, is the ultimate evolution of the Metal Slug and rebel Armor. The Gunner fires a machine gun, a chassis-mounted cannon, and can punch enemies with a close-combat exploding metal spike "cannon". The Gunner can perform a mid-air jump like that of the Level Armor. The Gunner can transform from a walker into a tank, and can move slightly faster in addition to running over [[infantry]]. However, the gunner is slow, takes a while to turn, and only has a 180-degree firing arc (360-degree while in the air).
*The second new vehicle is the Car Slug or the TIAF 660. This is a car with a 360-degree vulcan  cannon attached. Its secondary fire is an oversized Enemy Chaser. Of particular interest is that the player cannot eject from the vehicle, meaning they die when its destroyed, and will subsequently respawn in a new Car Slug.
*The Spider Slug is a giant squid-like walker with two legs tethered to the floor and to the ceiling; jumping raises or lowers the cockpit. The Spider Slug is armed with 360-degree firing vulcan cannons, and a [[harpoon]] gun.

*Problems with the Slug Gunner are now fixed, allowing it to move and turn around faster than usual. It also has the longest health than the other Slugs.
*Three new weapons are introduced: the ''Flame Machine Gun'' (which has more damage than Heavy Machine Gun, and capable of burning enemy soldiers when hit), the ''Grenade Launcher'' (which fires grenade rounds that provides a large blast radius and more damage than Super Grenade), and ''Super Shotgun'' (which has more damage than the Shotgun).
*The game has new cutscenes that provides more information of the original plot, as well as incorporating an original soundtrack.

'''Museum education''' is a specialized field devoted to developing and strengthening  the education role of non-formal education spaces and institutions such as museums. Its main objective is to engage visitors in learning experiences to enhance their curiosity and interest on their objects and collections. [[File:Dallas Museum of Art 06.jpg|thumb|Educational exhibition on "Materials &amp; Meanings" at the [[Dallas Museum of Art]].]]

In a seminal report called ''Excellence and Equity''&lt;ref name="aam1992"&gt;{{cite book|title=Excellence and Equity|year=1992|publisher=American Association of Museums|isbn=978-0-931201-14-1|url=http://iweb.aam-us.org/Purchase/ProductDetail.aspx?Product_code=I277}}&lt;/ref&gt; published in 1992 by the American Association of Museums (now the [http://aam-us.org/about-us American Alliance of Museums]), the educational role of museums was identified as the core to museums' service to the public. According to the report, "...the public dimensions of museums leads them to perform the public service of education—a term that in its broadest sense includes exploration, study, observation, critical thinking, contemplation and dialogue". As museum education has developed as a field of study and interest in its own right, efforts have been made to record its history and to establish a research agenda to strengthen its position as a discipline in the wider work of museums.

== History ==

=== Non-formal education ===

In his first report as the first Assistant Secretary of State for Education and Culture during [[John F. Kennedy]]'s administration, in 1968, [[Philip H. Coombs]] emphasized the increment of the educative needs of the world’s population after World War II. In it, he mentions the diversity of non-formal education activities that constitute, or should constitute an important complement to formal education to the total educational efforts of any country.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2001). «La necesidad de planificación y evaluación educativas en la educación no formal. Algunas propuestas». ''Educació i Cultura'': 14, 87-89.&lt;/ref&gt; To Coombs, non-formal education had the potential to satisfy the learning demands of both, individuals and collectivities, because unlike formal and traditional education, which is rigid with its contents and programs, it is flexible and, when planning and designing educational activities, it takes into consideration local variations of culture, economy and society, which counteracts the tendency of developing countries to just imitate education models of developed countries.&lt;ref&gt;Pastor Homs, Ma. Inmaculada (2011 [2004]). «1». ''Pedagogía museística. Nuevas perspectivas y tendencias actuales''. Ariel. p. 15. {{ISBN|978-84-344-6974-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a work written by Coombs in conjunction with M. Ahmed, non-formal education is defined as "...any organized educational activity outside the established formal system—whether operating separately or as an important feature of some broader activity—that is intended to serve identifiable learning clienteles and learning objective".&lt;ref&gt;Coombs, Phillips H. and H. Ahmed. ''New Paths To Learning: For Rural Children and Youth'' (en inglés). New York, N.Y.: International Council for Educational Development Publications. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, Coombs and Ahmed add the idea that non-formal education is any systematic educative activity, organized outside from the official framework to facilitate educative experiences for all people, regardless of age, genre, nationality, social, economic or health situation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Throughout his career, Coombs encouraged and impulsed the professional development of people responsible of non-formal education, which will be determining to the development and professionalization of the educative areas in institutions devoted to non-formal education.

=== Beginnings in art museums of the United States ===

At the turn of the twentieth century, art museums were very new institutions to the average visitor, who was seen wandering with no clear direction through the galleries, and with no clear idea on how to appreciate and study the exhibitions. In 1906, architect J. Randolph Coolidge Jr. was appointed the temporary director of the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. He experimented with a guiding system in the galleries, to help visitors orient themselves throughout their walk across the exhibitions.&lt;ref&gt;Burnham, Rika and, Elliot Kai-Kee (2011). «2». ''Teaching in the Art Museum. Interpretation as Experience''(en inglés). J. Paul Getty Museum, Los Angeles. {{ISBN|978-1-60606-058-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

An article published in the June bulletin of the museum that same year, features one of the first uses of the term docent and the description of its functions:&lt;blockquote&gt;"It has been proposed to the Trustees to consider the permanent appointment of one or more persons of intelligence and education who could act as intermediaries between Curators and the many who would be glad to avail themselves of trained instruction in our galleries. Through these docents, as it has been proposed to call them, the heads of departments could instruct many more persons than it would be possible for them to accompany through the galleries; and illustrated lectures upon the collections prepared in the departments might be regularly given by these specially qualified aids both in the Museum and in the class rooms of neighboring schools and colleges."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/jstor-4423283/4423283_djvu.txt|title=Full text of "The Educational Work of the Museum.

In [[free climbing]], a '''first ascent''' ('''FA'''), or '''first free ascent''' ('''FFA''') is the first successful, documented climb of a [[Climbing route|route]] or [[boulder]] performed without using equipment such as [[Anchor (climbing)|anchors]], [[quickdraw]]s or [[Dynamic rope|ropes]] for aiding progression or resting. In this article, notable first free ascents of hard routes and boulders are listed.

[[Grade (climbing)|Ratings]] on the hardest climbs tend to be speculative, until other climbers have had a chance to complete the routes and a consensus can be reached on the precise [[Grade (climbing)|grade]]. This becomes increasingly difficult as the grade increases, because fewer climbers are capable of repeating the route and passing judgment on its grade.
[[File:Adam Ondra climbing Silence, 9c by PAVEL BLAZEK 1-cropped.jpg|thumb|left|250 px|[[Adam Ondra]] climbing [[#Redpointed|''Silence'']], {{Climbing grade|9c}}, in 2017]]

== Overview ==
As of November 2017:
* The hardest ascended route ([[#Redpointed|''Silence'']]) has a proposed grade of {{climbing grade|9c}}. It was first ascended by [[Adam Ondra]] in 2017&lt;ref name=first9c /&gt; and no one else has yet repeated it.
* The hardest route ever ascended by a woman is [[#PlantaShiva|''La Planta de Shiva'']], graded {{climbing grade|9b}}. [[Angela Eiter]] claimed its first female ascent in 2017&lt;ref name=PlantadeShiva1 /&gt;&lt;ref name=PlantadeShiva2 /&gt; and no other woman has yet repeated it. 
* The hardest ascended [[Bouldering|boulder problem]] ([[#Boulder problems|''Burden of dreams'']]) has a proposed grade of {{Boulder grade|9A}}. It was first ascended by [[Nalle Hukkataival]] in 2016&lt;ref name=first9Aboulder /&gt; and no one else has yet repeated it.
* The hardest routes ever successfully climbed [[on-sight]] are graded {{Climbing grade|9a}}. The first [[on-sight]] ascent of a {{Climbing grade|9a}} route ([[#Onsighted|''Estado Critico'']]) was claimed by [[Alex Megos]] in March 2013.&lt;ref name=EstadoCritico /&gt; The second ([[#Onsighted|''Cabane au Canada'']]) by Adam Ondra in July 2013.&lt;ref name=ukc68197 /&gt; No one else has yet onsighted this grade.

The route is about 45 m long. The first 20 m are about {{climbing grade|8B}}, followed by three distinct boulder problems: an extremely hard 8C, a "burly 4-move" 8B and a 7C+ with slippery feet. The first one was described by Ondra as the hardest {{Boulder grade|8C}} he ever climbed. It consists of 10 incredibly hard and unusual moves, including single-[[Glossary of climbing terms#finger_jam|finger locks]], climbing upside down and a variation of a [[Glossary of climbing terms#figure four|figure four]] move.&lt;ref name=first9c&gt;

'''Olsok''' ("Olaf's Wake" or "Olaf's Vigil") is a national day of celebration in the [[Nordic countries]] of [[Norway]] and the [[Faroe Islands]], and also in the provinces of [[Härjedalen]] in Sweden and [[Savonlinna]] in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.baltzersens.co.uk/olsok-nordic-commemoration-celebration-across-beliefs-borders/ ''Olsok: a Nordic celebration across beliefs and borders'' (Baltzersens Ltd)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
King [[Olaf II Haraldsson]] of Norway is remembered as [[Rex perpetuus Norvegiae]], the Eternal King of Norway. July 29 is traditionally the date of the death of King Olaf at the [[Battle of Stiklestad]], east of [[Nidaros]] ([[Trondheim]]), [[Norway]], in 1030.  King Olaf's [[martyrdom]] at Stiklestad appears to have contributed decisively to establishing [[Christianity]] throughout the nation of Norway. King Olaf was subsequently canonized in Nidaros on 3 August 1031 following efforts principally  of  [[Grimketel|Bishop Grimkell]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aktivioslo.no/hvaskjer/olsok/ ''Olsok og Olsokfeiring i Norge - 29.juli''  (Aktiv i Oslo AS)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bibel.no/OversettelseSprakLitteratur/Bibelen-i-Norge/Bibelen-i-hoytidene/Olsok ''Olsok eller Olavsdagen'' (Bibelen i Norge)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the [[Lutheran]] [[Reformation]]  in the 16th century, Olsok was a major church feast in the [[Nordic countries]]. The late 19th and the early 20th century saw a renewed interest in Olsok, particularly in Norway. The [[Roman Catholic Church]] in Norway recognizes Olsok as a major feast all over the country, while the Lutheran [[Church of Norway]] recognizes the day principally in [[Nidaros Cathedral]] as well as other churches. Starting with the 900th anniversary of Stiklestad in 1930, July 29 has been an official flag day (''Olsokdagen'') in Norway.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.regjeringen.no/nb/dep/ud/dep/norges-flagg-forskrift/id449230/'' Norges flagg'' (regjeringen.no)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://snl.no/olsok ''Olsok'' (Store norske leksikon)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia2.thefreedictionary.com/St.+Olav%27s+Day ''St. Olav's Day'' (Farlex, Inc.)]&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1954, ''[[The Saint Olav Drama]]'' has been performed at Stiklestad each year.

In the [[Faroe Islands]],  [[Ólavsøka]] is also recognized on July 29. Ólavsøka is the biggest summer festival in the Faroe Islands and is commonly celebrated over a several day period. This tradition dates from when the islands were part of Norway during the [[Middle Ages]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.torshavn.fo/Default.aspx?pageid=71 ''Ólavsøka'' (Tórshavnar kommunu)]&lt;/ref&gt; Within [[Sweden]] ''Olofsmässa'' ("Olaf's Mass") is recognized principally within the former Norwegian province of [[Härjedalen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ne.se/uppslagsverk/encyklopedi/l%C3%A5ng/olofsm%C3%A4ssa ''Olofsmässa'' (Nationalencyklopedin AB)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Within [[Finland]], ''Pyhän Olavin Päivä'' ("St. Olaf's Day") is celebrated principally at [[Savonlinna]], site of [[Olavinlinna]] ("Olof's Castle"), since St. Olaf is the patron saint of the site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nba.fi/en/museums/olavinlinna_castle/events ''Olavinlinna Castle Events'' (World Heritage in Finland)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savonlinna.fi/asukas/kulttuuri/vuosittaiset_tapahtumat/pyhan_olavin_paiva ''Pyhän Olavin päivä 29.7'' (Savonlinna)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The Queen's English Society was founded in 1972 by Joe Clifton, an Oxford graduate and schoolteacher. The Society's meetings were held in [[Arundel]], and members wrote to newspapers and broadcasters, pointing out perceived linguistic errors and instances of ambiguous spoken English.

The Society claims to be concerned about the education of children. It believes that teachers should be trained to spot certain errors in English usage. In 1988, the Society delivered a petition to the then Secretary of State for Education and Science, [[Kenneth Baker, Baron Baker of Dorking|Kenneth Baker]], urging him "to introduce the compulsory study of formal grammar, including parsing and sentence analysis, into the school curriculum".

The objectives of the Society, as expressed in its constitution, are "to promote the maintenance, knowledge, understanding, development and appreciation of the English language as used both colloquially and in literature; to educate the public in its correct and elegant usage; and to discourage the intrusion of anything detrimental to clarity or euphony”.

On 4 June 2012, after a general meeting of the society attracted no nominations to replace retiring officers of the Society, chairman Rhea Williams announced that the society would cease to exist,&lt;ref name="Guardian 4 June 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Independent 4 June 2012" /&gt; but after new committee members volunteered, the Society was able to continue.&lt;ref name="Quest111"/&gt;

==The QES Academy of the English Language==

In June 2010 the QES announced that it had formed an Academy of English, a language reference website. The founder of the academy was quoted as saying that: "At the moment, anything goes. Let’s set down a clear standard of what is good, correct, proper English. Let’s have a body to sit in judgment."&lt;ref name="Times 7 Jun 2010" /&gt;

The Academy attracted widespread press coverage, some positive and some negative, and the QES enjoyed a surge in membership. In September 2010 the QES deleted the "Academy" content from its website, though the Academy was continued by its own board on a separate website,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.queens-english-society.org.uk/{{dead link|date=July 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; which is linked to that of the QES and ''vice versa''.

===Reception===
A ''[[Daily Telegraph]]'' opinion piece&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.telegraph.co.uk/news/geraldwarner/100042575/we-need-an-academy-of-english-to-save-our-beautiful-language/ "We need an Academy of English to save our beautiful language"], Gerald Warner. ''[[Daily Telegraph]] Education'', 8 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; had called the QES Academy "both welcome and long overdue.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4470">The '''R score''' ('''''cote de rendement au collégial''''', '''''CRC''''' or '''''cote R''''' in [[French language|French]]) is a [[statistics|statistical]] method which classifies [[College education in Quebec|college]] students' academic performances in [[Quebec]]. It is used by Quebec [[university|universities]] for selection purposes.

The R score is in fact a [[standard score|''z''-score]] (Zcol) multiplied by a group dispersion indicator (IDGZ) to which an indicator of group strength (ISGZ) has been added.

:R score = ( (Zcol x IDGZ) + ISGZ + C ) x D , where C = D = 5

The Zcol is the number of standard deviations the student is above the class average and gives an indication of the grade of the student with respect to the grades of other students in the class. The ISGZ is the average high school z-score (Zsec) the group's students obtained on the MEES uniform examination subjects in Secondary 4 and 5. The IDGZ is the standard deviation of the students' Zsec scores. The inclusion of the ISGZ and IDGZ in the determination of the R score allows for a more equitable comparison between students, regardless of their CEGEP's academic rank, although the effectiveness remains in dispute.

The use of the constant C = 5 greatly reduces the possibility of a negative value in the score and the multiplying the sum of all the preceding values by the constant D = 5 ensures the largeness of the score. The R score is defined such that the average is 25. Most R scores fall between 15 and 35, although any real number is a possible R score since the z-scores tend to positive or negative infinity as the standard deviation decreases. To guarantee that a grade of 100 will produce an R score of at least 35, an adjusted Z score formula guaranteed to produce a result above 35 is used. Grades below 50 are not considered when calculating the average and standard deviation of a grade distribution.

An R score is calculated for every course except for Physical Education taken before Fall 2007 or for remedial courses. The final R score is the weighted average of the R score in all courses. In addition, failed courses are given a reduced weight in the overall R score; they are weighted at 25% of the credits in the first semester and subsequently at 50%. 

==History==
Failed courses have been given a reduced weight since October 2004. Before the Fall 2007 semester, Physical Education courses were not given an R score. Before July 2017, the R score did not include the IDGZ and used calculated the ISG as 

:ISG = ( Average grade results of Secondary 4 and 5 of all the group's students - 75 ) / 14.

Also until July 2017, an additional score of 0.5 was added to the overall R score to a student graduating with an [[International Baccalaureate]] degree or a ''DEC (Diplôme d'études collégiales) en Sciences, Lettres et Arts''. The adjustment of Z score using the IDGZ makes this unnecessary. 

==Criticism==
Firsthand experience suggests that the R score is not as ideal a tool as it was meant to be. A recurring complaint from students is that the ISG does not seem to sufficiently offset the advantage enjoyed by students in weak groups. Such students have the opportunity to obtain grades much higher than the low average of their class, thus earning an elevated Z score, whereas students in strong groups cannot earn such high Z scores. One possible reason for this is that the ISG for a certain course is based on the average of the grades in all high school courses, which may not correlate to the group's strength in that course as much as the average of the grades of similar courses in high school. 

Such perceived weaknesses of the R score are particularly worrying, because it is the main and sometimes only criterion considered by Quebec universities during the admissions process. Since the R score is perceived as an absolute measure of a student's academic performance regardless of their College academic rank, differences smaller than 0.5 are often used to discriminate between candidates applying to programs with fixed quotas, such as medicine, pharmacy, dentistry or law.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4495">The '''recency illusion''' is the belief or impression that a word or language usage is of recent origin when it is long-established. The term was coined by [[Arnold Zwicky]], a linguist at [[Stanford University]] primarily interested in examples involving words, meanings, phrases, and grammatical constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rickford |first1=John R. |last2=Wasow |first2=Thomas |last3=Zwicky |first3=Arnold |date=2007 |title=Intensive and quotative ''all'': something new, something old |journal=American Speech |doi=10.1215/00031283-2007-001 |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=3–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, use of the term is not restricted to linguistic phenomena: Zwicky has defined it simply as, "the belief that things ''you'' have noticed only recently are in fact recent".&lt;ref name=LL02386&gt;{{cite web |last=Zwicky |first=Arnold |date=7 August 2005 |title=Just between Dr. Language and I |website=Language Log |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002386.html |accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Zwicky, the illusion is caused by [[selective perception|selective attention]].&lt;ref name="LL02386"/&gt;

==Examples==

Linguistic items prone to the recency illusion include:
* "[[Singular they]]": the use of "they," "them," or "their" to reference a singular antecedent without specific [[gender]], as in "someone said they liked the play." Although this usage is often cited as a modern invention, it is quite old.&lt;ref name="MWDU"&gt;{{cite book |year=1989 |title=Merriam Webster's Dictionary of English Usage |publisher=Merriam Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; The usage is found, for example, in Shakespeare.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Shakespeare |first=William |authorlink=William Shakespeare |date=1594 |title=The Comedy of Errors |chapter=Act IV, Scene 3 |url=http://www.opensourceshakespeare.org/views/plays/play_view.php?WorkID=comedyerrors&amp;Act=4&amp;Scene=3&amp;Scope=scene |quote=There's not a man I meet but doth salute me / As if I were their well-acquainted friend}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The phrase "between you and I" (rather than "between you and me"), often viewed today as a [[hypercorrection]], which could also be found occasionally in Early Modern English.&lt;ref name="MWDU" /&gt;
* The [[intensifier]] "really," as in "it was a really wonderful experience," and the moderating adverb "pretty," as in "it was a pretty exciting experience." Many people have the impression that these usages are somewhat [[slang]]-like, and have developed relatively recently.{{citation needed |date=November 2014 |reason=need an RS stating that this is the recency illusion -- otherwise this is WP:SYN}} They go back to at least the 18th century, and are commonly found in the works and letters of such writers as [[Benjamin Franklin]].
* "Literally" being used figuratively as an intensifier is often viewed as a recent change, but in fact usage dates back to the 1760s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Zimmer |first=Benjamin |title=Literally: a history |publisher=Language Log |url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/002611.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* "Aks" as a production of [[African American English]] only.{{citation needed |date=November 2014 |reason=need an RS stating that this is the recency illusion -- otherwise this is WP:SYN}} Use of "aks" in place of "ask" dates back to the works of [[Chaucer]] in Middle English, though typically in this context spelled "ax".&lt;ref name="lippi-green"&gt;{{cite book |last=Lippi-Green |first=Rosina |date=1997 |title=English with an Accent: Language, Ideology, and Discrimination in the United States |edition=2nd |publisher=Routledge |location=London |isbn=9780415559102}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The word "recency" itself. It is commonly used in consumer marketing ("analyze the recency of customer visits")&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=root |date=14 February 2011 |title=Recency, Frequency, Monetary Value (RFM) Definition |publisher=Investopedia |url=http://www.investopedia.com/terms/r/rfm-recency-frequency-monetary-value.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; and many think it was coined for that purpose.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}} But its first known use was in 1612.&lt;ref&gt;{{MerriamWebsterDictionary|recency}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"'''Riddles Wisely Expounded'''" is a traditional English song, dating at least to 1450. It is [[Child Ballads|Child Ballad]] 1 and [[Roud Folk Song Index|Roud]] 161, and exists in several variants.&lt;ref&gt;[[Francis James Child]], [http://www.sacred-texts.com/neu/eng/child/ch001.htm "Riddles Wisely Expounded"]&lt;/ref&gt; The first known tune was attached to it in 1719.

==Synopsis==
In the earliest surviving version of the song,&lt;ref&gt;Child, Additions and corrections to Ballad #1, in the appendix to Volume 5 of ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads''&lt;/ref&gt; ''Inter diabolus et virgo'', "between the devil and the maiden" (mid-15th century), the "foul fiend" proposes to abduct a maiden unless she can answer a series of riddles. The woman prays to Jesus for wisdom, and answers the riddles correctly. 

In later versions, a knight puts a woman to test before he marries her (sometimes after seducing her), or a devil disguised as a knight tries to carry her off.  The woman knows the answers, and thus either wins the marriage or is free of the devil. In the latter case, the last riddle is often "what is worse than woman?" (the devil).

The riddles vary, but typical ones include
*What is longer than the way? -- love
*What is deeper than the sea? -- hell
*What is louder than the horn?  -- thunder
*What is sharper than a thorn? -- hunger
*What is whiter than milk? -- snow
*What is softer than silk? -- down

==Commentary==
The motif of riddling in folklore is very ancient, the stories of [[Oedipus]] and [[Samson]] giving two early examples.  The particular form used here matches the folktale [[Aarne-Thompson]] type 875  ''The Clever Girl'' where a woman wins a husband by her clever answers to riddles.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 1, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; Other tales of this type include ''[[What Is the Fastest Thing in the World?]]'' and ''[[The Wise Little Girl]]''.  

In this ballad, the words of each verse are interspersed with a chorus phrase "lay the bent to the bonny broom". [[A. L. Lloyd]]  euphemistically describes this as a phrase of "physiological significance", explaining that the word "bent" means a horn.&lt;ref&gt;A. L. Lloyd, ''Folk Song in England'', Paladin, 1975. p.154&lt;/ref&gt; "Broom" most likely refers to the [[broom (shrub)|flowering shrub]].

There are many German variants of this ballad,&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 1-2, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt; and a Gaelic form was widespread among both Scots and Irish.&lt;ref&gt;Francis James Child, ''The English and Scottish Popular Ballads'', v 1, p 3, Dover Publications, New York 1965&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Shemahinskaya boyaderka 2.jpg|right|thumb|150px|A dancer from [[Shamakhi]]. [[Grigory Gagarin|G.Gagarin]], mid-19th century]]
The '''Shamakhi dancers''' ([[Azerbaijani language|Azerbaijani]]: ''Şamaxı rəqqasələri'') were the principal dancers of the entertainment groups that existed in [[Shamakhi]] ([[Azerbaijan]]) up to the late 19th century. These groups worked similarly to [[tawaif]]s.

[[Russia]]n painter [[Grigory Gagarin]] who lived in the [[Caucasus]] in 1840–1855 depicted the Shamakhi dancers in a series of paintings, in which he referred to them as ''bayaderki''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azeri.ru/az/cultur/359/ Ими восхищался Дюма] by Emil Karimov and Mehpara Aliyeva. ''Azeri.ru''&lt;/ref&gt; (баядерки; sg. ''bayaderka'' – баядерка; originally the Portuguese term ''balliadera'' borrowed into Russian and other European languages via French (''bayadère'') and initially used to refer to the [[devadasi]].&lt;ref&gt;Bayadère. Oxford English Dictionary. Retrieved February 1st, 2008 from Oxford English Dictionary.&lt;/ref&gt;)

The extant documents regarding the Shamakhi dancers, and dances, are very limited. In literature, Shamakhi dancers are referred to in [[Arthur Gobineau|Comte de Gobineau]]'s novel ''The dancing girl of Shamakha and other Asiatic tales''.

''The Dancer of Shamakha'' recounts the life of Armenian dancer [[Armen Ohanian]], her education as a dancer, her childhood in Russia, and her travels in Iran and Egypt. It was published in French as ''La Danseuse de Shamakha'' in 1918 and translated into English in 1923 by [[Rose Wilder]].  After moving to Europe, Ohanian danced traditional dances for audiences, gave lectures on poetry, and was an active member in intellectual and political circles.  She eventually moved to Mexico.  She is the author of some 15 publications including autobiographical volumes and books on culture and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Ohanian, Armen.  ''La Danseuse de Shamakha''.  Forward by Anatole France. Paris: Bernard Grasset, 1918

{{More footnotes|date=April 2012}}

In [[social science]], a '''social relation''' or '''social interaction''' is any relationship between two or more individuals. Social relations derived from [[agency (sociology)|individual agency]] form the basis of [[social structure]] and the basic object for analysis by [[social scientists]]. Fundamental inquiries into the nature of social relations feature in the work of sociologists such as [[Max Weber]] in his theory of [[social action]].

[[Categorizing]] social interactions enables observational and other social research, such as [[Gemeinschaft and Gesellschaft]] (lit. "community and society"),  [[collective consciousness]], etc. However different schools and theories of [[sociology]] and other social sciences dispute the methods used for such investigations.

==Forms of relation and interaction ==
According to [[Piotr Sztompka]], forms of relation and interaction in [[sociology]] and [[anthropology]] may be described as follows: first and most basic are [[animal]]-like [[behavior]]s, i.e. various physical movements of the body. Then there are [[Action (philosophy)|action]]s – movements with a meaning and purpose. Then there are [[social behavior]]s, or [[social action]]s, which address (directly or indirectly) other people, which solicit a response from another agent. Next are [[social network|social contacts]], a pair of social actions, which form the beginning of social interactions. Social interactions in turn form the basis of social relations. Symbols define social relationships. Without symbols, our social life would be no more sophisticated than that of animals. For example, without symbols we would have no aunts or uncles, employers or teachers-or even brothers and sisters. In sum, symbolic integrations analyze how social life depends on the ways we define ourselves and others. They study [[face-to-face interaction]], examining how people make sense out of life, how they determine their relationships.

This sociological hierarchy is illustrated in the table below:&lt;ref&gt;Sztompka (2002), p. 107&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Exorcist''''' is an American [[media franchise]] that originated with [[William Peter Blatty]]'s [[The Exorcist (novel)|1971 horror novel of the same name]] and most prominently featured in a [[The Exorcist (film)|1973 film adapted from the novel]], and [[The Exorcist (film series)|many subsequent prequels and sequels]]. All of these installments focus on fictional accounts of people [[Demonic possession|possessed]] by [[Pazuzu (The Exorcist)|Pazuzu]], the main antagonist of the series, and the efforts of religious authorities to counter this possession.

==Novels==
===''The Exorcist'' (1971)===
{{main|The Exorcist (novel)}}
'''''The Exorcist''''' is a 1971 novel by American writer [[William Peter Blatty]]. The book details the [[demonic possession]] of twelve-year-old [[Regan MacNeil]], the daughter of a famous actress, and the two priests who attempt to [[exorcise]] the demon. It was published by [[Harper (publisher)|Harper &amp; Row]]. 

The novel was inspired by a 1949 case of [[demonic possession]] and [[exorcism]] that Blatty heard about while he was a student in the class of 1950 at [[Georgetown University]].&lt;ref name="Pedro Palao Pons"&gt;{{Cite book|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=7h9huFdnsmcC&amp;pg=PA132&amp;dq=Robbie+Mannheim&amp;cd=5#v=onepage&amp;q=Robbie%20Mannheim&amp;f=false|title= Dimension Desconocida|publisher= Ediciones Robinbook|quote= La inspiración del exorcista La historia de Robbie Mannheim es un caso típico de posesión, y es la que dio vida a la película ''El Exorcista''.|accessdate = 2010-04-04|isbn = 9788499170015|year = 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, the novel takes place in Washington D.C. near the campus of Georgetown University. In September 2011, the novel was reprinted by Harper Collins to celebrate its fortieth anniversary, with slight revisions made by Blatty as well as interior title artwork by [[Jeremy Caniglia]].

===''Legion'' (1983)===
{{main|Legion (Blatty novel)}}
''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]'' is the 1983 follow-up to the ''Exorcist'' novel. It was made into the movie ''[[The Exorcist III]]'' in 1990. Like ''The Exorcist'', it involves [[demonic possession]]. The book was the focus of a court case over its exclusion from [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller list]].

Blatty based aspects of the Gemini Killer on the real-life [[Zodiac Killer]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.movietome.com/movie/282482/the-exorcist-iii/index.html |title=The Exorcist III Info, Trailers, and Reviews at MovieTome |publisher=Movietome.com |date= |accessdate=7 April 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090928072014/http://www.movietome.com/movie/282482/the-exorcist-iii/index.html |archivedate=28 September 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; who, in a January 1974 letter to the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]'', had praised the original ''[[The Exorcist (film)|Exorcist]]'' film as "the best satirical comedy that I have ever seen".&lt;ref name=SFGateZL2&gt;{{cite news|title=Zodiac Killer : The Letters - 01-29-1974|url=http://www.sfgate.com/news/slideshow/Zodiac-Killer-The-Letters-37941/photo-2467717.php|publisher=SFGate (''San Francisco Chronicle'')|accessdate=7 April 2013|date=2 December 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''The Exorcist'' (1973)===
{{main|The Exorcist (film)}}
'''''The Exorcist''''' is a 1973 American [[Supernatural fiction|supernatural]] [[horror film]] directed by [[William Friedkin]], adapted by [[William Peter Blatty]] from his 1971 [[The Exorcist (novel)|novel of the same name]], and starring [[Ellen Burstyn]], [[Linda Blair]], [[Max von Sydow]], and [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]]. The film is part of [[The Exorcist (franchise)|''The Exorcist'' franchise]].The book, inspired by the 1949 [[exorcism]] of [[Exorcism of Roland Doe|Roland Doe]],{{Sfn|Fry|2008|p=130}}{{Sfn|Pons|2009|p=132}} deals with the [[demonic possession]] of a 12-year-old girl and her mother's attempts to win back her child through an exorcism conducted by two priests. The adaptation is relatively faithful to the book, which itself has been commercially successful (hitting the [[New York Times bestseller list|''New York Times'' bestseller list]]).&lt;ref name=Holtzclaw&gt;{{cite news|first=Mike|last=Holtzclaw|accessdate=August 8, 2015|url=http://www.dailypress.com/entertainment/blog/dp-popcorn-the-exorcist-1024-story.html|title=The sound and fury of 'The Exorcist'|date=October 24, 2014|publisher=''[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]]''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Susman&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=August 8, 2015|url=http://news.moviefone.com/2013/12/26/the-exorcist-facts/|title='The Exorcist': 25 Things You Didn't Know About the Terrifying Horror Classic|date=December 26, 2013|first=Gary|last=Susman|publisher=[[moviefone.com|news.moviefone.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Exorcist II: The Heretic'' (1977)===
{{main|Exorcist II: The Heretic}}
[[John Boorman]]'s ''[[Exorcist II: The Heretic]]'' was released in 1977, and revisited Regan four years after her initial ordeal. The plot dealt with an investigation into the legitimacy of Merrin's exorcism of Regan in the first film. In flashback sequences, we see Regan giving Merrin his fatal heart attack, as well as scenes from the exorcism of a young boy named Kokumo in Africa many years earlier.

===''The Exorcist III'' (1990)===
{{main|The Exorcist III}}
''[[The Exorcist III]]'' appeared in 1990, written and directed by Blatty himself from his own 1983 novel ''[[Legion (Blatty novel)|Legion]]''. Jumping past the events of ''Exorcist II'', this book and film presented a continuation of Karras' story. Following the precedent set in ''[[The Ninth Configuration]],'' Blatty turned a supporting character from the first film—in this case, Kinderman—into the chief protagonist. Though the characters of Karras and Kinderman were acquainted during the murder investigation in ''The Exorcist'' and Kinderman expressed fondness for Karras, in ''Exorcist III'' Blatty has Kinderman remembering Karras as his "best friend". [[Jason Miller (playwright)|Jason Miller]] reprised his Academy Award-nominated role in ''The Exorcist'' for this film.

===''Exorcist: The Beginning'' (2004)===
{{main|Exorcist: The Beginning}}
Because of the studio's dissatisfaction with Schrader's version of the prequel (see "Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist"), [[Renny Harlin]] was then hired as director to retool the movie. Harlin reused some of Schrader's footage but shot mostly new material to create a more conventional horror film. Harlin's new version ''[[Exorcist: The Beginning]]'' was released, but was not well received.

===''Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist'' (2005)===
{{main|Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist}}
A prequel film attracted attention and controversy even before its release in 2004; it went through a number of directorial and script changes, such that two versions were ultimately released. [[John Frankenheimer]] was originally hired as director for the project, but withdrew before filming started due to health concerns. He died a month later. [[Paul Schrader]] replaced him. Upon completion the studio rejected Schrader's version as being too slow, and hired another director to retool the movie. Nine months after the release of the retooled movie (see "Exorcist: The Beginning") Schrader's original version, retitled ''[[Dominion: Prequel to the Exorcist]]'', was given a small theatrical release.

==Parodies and pastiches==

The success of ''The Exorcist'' inspired a string of possession-related films worldwide. The first was ''[[Beyond the Door (1974 film)|Beyond the Door]]'', a 1974 Italian film with [[Juliet Mills]] as a woman possessed by the devil. It appeared in the U.S. one year later. Also in 1974, a Turkish film, ''[[Şeytan]]'' (Turkish for ''Satan''; the original film was also shown with the same name), is an almost scene-for-scene [[remake]] of the original. The same year in Germany, the exorcism-themed film ''Magdalena, vom Teufel besessen'' was released. In 1975, Britain released ''[[The Devil Within Her]]'' (also called ''[[I Don't Want to Be Born]]'') with [[Joan Collins]] as an exotic dancer who gives birth to a demon-possessed child.

In 1987, Warner Brothers released an animated short  starring Daffy Duck, entitled "Duxorcist" which was a parody of "Exorcist", where a group of spirits possess a female duck, and Daffy does succeed in getting them out of the female figure. Similarly, a [[blaxploitation]] film was released in 1974 titled ''[[Abby (film)|Abby]]''. While the films ''Şeytan'' and ''Magdalena, vom Teufel besessen'' were protected from prosecution by the laws of their countries of origin, ''Abby''{{'}}s producers (filming in Louisiana) were sued by Warner. The film was pulled from theaters, but not before making $4 million at the box office.

A parody, ''[[Repossessed]]'', was released the same year as ''The Exorcist III'', with Blair lampooning the role she had played in the original. Another parody, was made in Italy by actor and comedian [[Ciccio Ingrassia]] in 1977, called [[L'esorciccio]]. The prologue for ''[[Scary Movie 2]]'' was a short parody of several scenes from the original.

Mexican comics "Los Polivoces", (The Multivoices), made a copy-parody, called "El Exorcista". Eduardo Manzano incarned{{Elucidate|date=June 2017}} the "possession", hard make-up was used. Flying clothes were used as "phantoms" and rotoscophy techniques make his bed fly.

===Other references===
A 1995 episode of ''[[The Simpsons]]'' (titled "[[Home Sweet Homediddly-Dum-Doodily]]") features [[Bart Simpson|Bart]], [[Lisa Simpson|Lisa]] and Maggie getting put under the care of the Flanders family.  After Lisa reveals that neither she, Bart nor Maggie is [[baptism|baptized]], [[Ned Flanders|Ned]] decides to baptize them.  On the way to the baptism, Maggie turns her head around like Linda Blair in ''The Exorcist''.  It was also parodied in [[Treehouse of Horror I]], [[Treehouse of Horror XVI]] and [[Treehouse of Horror XXVIII]]. It was also parodied in "[[Fland Canyon]]".

A meta-reference to the film was made in an episode of ''[[Supernatural (U.S. TV series)|Supernatural]]'' titled "The Usual Suspects". On the show, demons possessing humans is a common plot element; demons in the series are human souls corrupted by their time in Hell, lacking physical bodies of their own to interact with Earth. Linda Blair appeared in "The Usual Suspects" as a police detective, with protagonist [[Dean Winchester]] finding her character familiar and expressing a strange desire for pea soup at the episode's conclusion.

In ''Angel: Earthly Possessions'', a spin-off comic story based on the TV series ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'', protagonist [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] finds himself dealing with a priest who performs exorcisms, but comes to realize that the priest is summoning the demons for him to exorcise in the first place. He also makes a note of ''The Exorcist'' film, noting that the vision it created of possession actually made things easier for possession demons by making it harder for humans to know what to expect from a possession.

In the animated [[Horror-comedy]] show ''[[Courage the Cowardly Dog]]'', the episode "[[List of Courage the Cowardly Dog episodes|The Demon In The Mattress]]" is a direct spoof of the film, using several plot elements that was lifted straight from ''The Exorcist''. In the episode, Muriel orders a comfy new mattress, not paying attention to the grotesque deliveryman nor the sinister [[Horse-drawn carriage]] that delivered it. Unaware of the demon in the mattress, she is later possessed by it when while she sleeps.

In the paranormal TV show ''[[Ghost Adventures]]'' visited the Exorcist House for their 100th episode of the series.  In the episode, Zak, Nick, and Aaron visit the house to see that an exorcism occurred there in 1949.  The episode has been announced as one of the scariest lockdown since Bobby Mackeys.

The film was parodied in [[The Boondocks (TV series)|''The Boondocks'']] episode "Stinkmeaner Strikes Back" ([[The Boondocks (season 2)|season 2, episode 4]]).

The 2013 disaster comedy film ''[[This Is the End]]'' referenced the exorcism when [[Jonah Hill]] is possessed by a demon and [[Jay Baruchel]] performs an exorcism on by repeating lines from the movie.

In 2014, British author [[Saurav Dutt]] released a book entitled "''Pazuzu Unbound''", which is a book set in contemporary times dealing with the demon Pazuzu but which does not deal with the original characters in the film and novel on which the book is inspired.

'''''World at the End of Time''''' is a 1990 [[hard science fiction]] novel by [[United States|American]] writer [[Frederik Pohl]]. It tells the parallel stories of a human and a plasma-based intelligence who manage to survive to the time near the [[heat death of the universe]]. The book is thus a combined work in speculative [[cosmology]] and [[space colonization]].

==Plot summary==

''World at the End of Time'' follows the story of a young Earth-born human, Viktor Sorricaine, on a colony expedition to a distant star system. The colonists are frozen for the long trip between stars. Unknown to both the humans of Earth and the colonists, the stars around them are home to immensely long-lived (effectively immortal) [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] creatures—with no knowledge of, or interest in, the activities of insignificant matter creatures.

Wan-To, one of the oldest and most powerful plasma creatures, is engaged in a war. After creating modified copies of himself, or "children", for company, Wan-To finds himself in a deadly game of chess with them. The "board" is the entire galaxy and the weapons are the stars themselves. Each star may be home to an enemy "child"; using a variety of exotic particles, Wan-To is able to cause a targeted star to flare and kill any enemy that may be living within it.

Into the middle of this battlefield, the three colony ships (''Ark'', ''New Mayflower'' and ''Argosy'') unwittingly head for their new home. Upon arriving, the colony begins to establish itself ... only to discover that their entire local group of stars appears to be undergoing a bizarre acceleration, and are dimming. After a disastrous disease outbreak and [[terraforming]] failures, the desperate colonists eventually decide to investigate the strange radiation emissions from a small world within their solar system.

Upon arriving in orbit, their ship is badly damaged and Viktor is forced into the onboard freezer systems. They are eventually rescued and unfrozen four hundred of the colony's years later, to find the colony in an even more desperate situation. The star around which the colony's world orbits has dimmed considerably (due to the energy being siphoned off to accelerate it) and they are now travelling so fast that, due to relativistic effects, the universe around them has shrunk to a bright dot. The colony has become factionalized and heavily religious, with scientific investigation discouraged.

Viktor is eventually frozen again for attempting to investigate why they have been accelerating. He wakes four thousand of the colony's years later, to find the far descendants of the colony have rebuilt their society into habitats closely orbiting the dim star (a [[brown dwarf]]) and created a high-technology civilization dedicated to pleasure and comfort. He makes his way, eventually, to the former colony to find only a few fellow-colonists unfrozen and attempting to rebuild it. His unique status as someone who was born on "old Earth" brings publicity to their efforts and the rebuilding forges ahead.

During the four thousand years of Viktor's frozen sleep, the star system has been slowed again. After the vast amount of time that has passed, all that remains of the once young universe are dead stars and black holes, with Wan-To desperately surviving on the energy provided by [[proton decay]]. Wan-To receives a [[tachyon]] transmission from his long-forgotten systems and makes preparations to move into these last remaining stars — believing that the small matter creatures inhabiting the system are irrelevant and can be destroyed should they become an irritation.

'''''Tom Clancy's The Division''''' is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] [[video game]] developed by [[Massive Entertainment]] and published by [[Ubisoft]], with assistance from [[Red Storm Entertainment]] and Ubisoft Annecy, for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. It was announced during Ubisoft's [[E3 2013]] press conference, and was released worldwide on 8 March 2016. It is set in a near future [[New York City]] in the aftermath of a [[smallpox]] [[pandemic]]; the player, who is a Special Agent of the eponymous Strategic Homeland Division, commonly referred to simply as "Division", is tasked with helping the group rebuild its operations in [[Manhattan]], investigate the nature of the outbreak, and combating criminal activity in its wake. ''The Division'' is structured with elements of [[Role-playing video game|role-playing games]], as well as cooperative and [[player versus player]] online multiplayer.

The game received generally positive reviews, and was a commercial success, with Ubisoft stating that the game broke the company's record for highest number of first-day sales. Furthermore, one week after the game's release, Ubisoft stated that ''The Division'' was the company's best-selling game, and the industry's biggest first-week launch for a new game franchise, which generated an estimated amount of $330 million globally. A sequel, ''[[Tom Clancy's The Division 2]]'',  is scheduled to be released in March 2019.

== Gameplay ==
[[File:Tom Clancy's The Division gameplay screenshot.jpg|thumb|left|250px|Players may take cover behind objects during firefights to avoid taking damage from enemies, and to give them a [[Positional advantage|tactical advantage]] when attacking.]]

''Tom Clancy's The Division'' is an [[Action role-playing game|action role-playing]] game set in an [[open world]] mid-crisis [[Manhattan]] with destructible environments that can be freely explored by the players. The player's mission is to restore order by investigating the source of a virus. The player character can carry three weapons, and explosives like sticky bombs and seeker mines to fight against enemies.&lt;ref name="PCG1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/the-division-preview-playing-pvp-in-the-lawless-dark-zone/|title=The Division preview: playing PvP in the lawless Dark Zone|first=Samuel|last=Roberts|work=[[PC Gamer]]|date=15 June 2015|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players may take cover behind objects during fire-fights to avoid taking damage from enemies, and to give them a tactical advantage when attacking. The game is played from a [[Virtual camera system#Third-person view|third-person perspective]], meaning the character model is visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2015/6/23/8827287/the-division-hands-on-e3-xbox-one-ps4-preview|title=The Division has promise — if you can keep from shooting the wrong people|first=Arthur|last=Gies|work=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]|date=23 June 2015|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As players progress, they earn [[Experience (gaming)|experience points]] (commonly known as XP) and currency. They can use this currency to buy weapons and gear, and use the points to learn new talents and skills. The player's gear is categorized into seven levels: worn, standard, specialized, superior, high-end, gear set items or the rarer exotic items, each with a specific color code. Gear can be either bought, or found as in-game loot, or crafted from gathered materials. The storyline missions involve objectives that are relevant to their respective wing of the Base of Operations, which serves as the player's home base. At the player's home base there are three wings which are the Medical, Security and Tech wing. Playing missions for a wing grants the player points for that wing which the player can spend to gain access to new talents, perks and facilities in the Base of Operations. The player will receive intel videos from each head of the wing at certain progression points, which the player can watch. The intel received is specific to its wing, with the Medical wing giving virus reports on the outbreak, the Security wing giving insight into each in-game enemy faction and the tech wing providing camera footage.&lt;ref name="dz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesradar.com/division-character-progression-mmo/?tag=grsocial-20|title=The Division's character progression sure sounds like an MMO|first=Connor|last=Sheridan|work=[[GamesRadar]]|date=26 November 2015|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game features a dynamic, time-based weather system which may bring benefits or disadvantages to players. For instance, storms can hinder player's visibility and make aiming difficult. The game also features a day-night cycle which can change the behaviour of enemies in the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.vg247.com/2015/10/23/the-division-pc-ps4-xbox-one/|title=The Division – more on how dynamic weather and lighting can affect gameplay|first=Stephany |last=Nunneley|work=[[VG247]]|date=23 October 2015|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Dark Zone is the player-versus-player competitive multiplayer mode featured in ''The Division'', where a lot of high-end weapons are left behind when the military retreats in the game. It is separated from the main campaign and has its own progression system. Higher quality items can be found within the Dark Zone, but are considered "contaminated"; contaminated loot can be stolen by other players, and must be flown out via helicopter in order for them to be available to the player after they leave the Dark Zone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-division-s-pvp-dark-zones-detailed/1100-6425586/|title=The Division's PvP "Dark Zones" Detailed|first=Eddie|last=Makuch|work=[[GameSpot]]|date=27 February 2015|accessdate=26 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Players can be accompanied by several co-operative partners and other neutral, player-controlled agents. These people, however, can turn against the player at any moment, going rogue. Players' [[Level (role-playing games)|level]] and ranking may drop if they die too often in the zone.&lt;ref name="dz"/&gt;

==Plot==
On [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]] 2015, a [[smallpox]] [[pandemic]], transmitted by a virus planted on [[banknotes]], sweeps through [[New York City]]. The disease, known as "Green Poison" or "The Dollar Flu", causes widespread chaos, and [[Manhattan]] is placed under quarantine. The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. Government]] activates sleeper agents in the population who operate for the Strategic Homeland Division, or simply "The Division", to assist emergency responders, now called the Joint Task Force (JTF), in restoring order. In [[Brooklyn]], the [[protagonist]], a Division agent, assists the JTF before planning to depart for the Quarantine zone with fellow agent Faye Lau. However, the [[VTOL]] meant to take them there is destroyed in an explosion, killing the Division Commander along with most of the second wave and severely wounding Faye Lau. Arriving in a JTF-commandeered news helicopter instead, the Division agents reclaim the [[James A. Farley Post Office Building]] as their base of operations. From there, the agents undertake assignments to rescue important personnel, help in restoring the base of operations to full working capacity and combat criminal groups, such as the Rioters, common street thugs in New York who generally want to take advantage of the quarantine, the Rikers, escapees from [[Rikers Island]], and the Cleaners, insane [[New York City Department of Sanitation|New York Sanitation]] workers who wield flamethrowers and believe everyone is infected. In the course of the game, the agent helps rescue important personnel like Dr. Jessica Kandel, Captain Roy Benitez and Paul Rhodes. These personnel head the Medical, Security and Tech wings of the base of operations respectively. Agents also recover a sample of Green Poison. Studying the sample reveals the virus was manufactured and then modified heavily by a controversial biologist named Dr. Gordon Amherst.

Eventually, the agents find footage of Division agent Aaron Keener going rogue and killing other agents, having gone insane after witnessing the chaos and destruction caused during the breakdown of order following the initial outbreak. It is also discovered Keener and the rest of the first wave of agents who went rogue along with him are assisting the "Last Man Battalion" (LMB), an equally rogue [[private military company]] that was abandoned by the government during the evacuation, and are now hostile to it. Working together, these two groups destroyed the VTOL and killed the Commander to weaken Division operations in New York. Intercepting a signal from the Russian consulate, the agents attempt to rescue Vitaly Tchernenko, a Russian virologist who claims to have information on the Green Poison. However, he is kidnapped by Keener and the LMB before the Division can reach him. After helping the JTF secure supplies and weapons, the JTF and Division agents launch an attack on the LMB's base, the evacuated [[Headquarters of the United Nations|United Nations headquarters]]. The agent finds footage of Keener and his fellow rogue agents abandoning the LMB, with Tchernenko as their prisoner. The leader of the LMB, Charles Bliss, initially escapes in a helicopter, but then returns to make a final stand alongside his men. In the end, the agent destroys the vehicle, killing Bliss. Lau informs the agent that most threats are destroyed or weakened, however the LMB was split into factions. New York is approaching stability, but an unknown signal leads the agent to a secluded laboratory. There, they find Dr. Amherst's remains, having discovered that he has died from exposure to his own virus. They also find a message from Keener, showing he has the technology to manufacture a new strain of Green Poison and intends to do so, and mysteriously tells the agent to explore the center of Manhattan, called the “Dark Zone.” The agent is informed that the information in the lab will further the development of a vaccine and is shown a recovered message from Amherst. In the message, Amherst reveals he engineered Green Poison as part of his [[eco-terrorist]] plan to decimate the human race and preserve the planet. If the player follows Keener's instructions, they will discover a message from Keener claiming that he plans to continue with Amherst's plot, as he has come to worship the virus as the judge of all humanity and plans to reverse engineer and improve it; he then offers the player a position beside him based on their actions in the Dark Zone.

''Tom Clancy's The Division'' received "generally favourable" reviews according to review aggregator, [[Metacritic]]. ''[[Ars Technica]]'' drew comparisons between ''The Division'' and ''[[Destiny (video game)|Destiny]]'', a first-person shooter game with similar overall mechanics regarding items, crafting, and "shared world" elements. The game was also compared to "modern" [[massively multiplayer online role-playing game]]s (MMORPG), explaining that "structurally, it all feels like it could have been ripped from ''[[Guild Wars 2]]'' or a latter-day ''[[World of Warcraft]],''" including "that old MMO staple of being stuck in a server queue before diving into a game" on-launch, in combination with the "quintessential Ubisoft design style" of varying types of collectible and upgrade systems. ''The Division'' was criticized for lacking variety in its activities and missions, explaining that it "does little to break from or advance what is fast becoming the general form of the "loot shooter" genre. In fact, it takes very few risks at all, particularly with its enemies and encounter design." The Dark Zone was described as being "harrowing", but was panned for sharing characteristics with the post-game content of ''Destiny'', as being the only means of obtaining higher-level gear that is, ultimately, only theoretically needed for further play in the Dark Zone, and for not introducing any major differences in gameplay mechanics like the raids of ''Destiny''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Division review: Mistakes were made, both old and new|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/03/the-division-review-mistakes-were-made-both-old-and-new/|website=Ars Technica|publisher=Conde Nast|accessdate=13 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vince Ingenito of ''IGN'' was more critical of ''The Division'', outlining that "next to every good thing ''The Division'' does, there hangs a big, ugly asterisk". The overall atmosphere was panned for being "barren and unengaging" overall; as examples, Ingenito focused upon the lack of dynamic events in the game world, that there were "long stretches of eventless walking where very little happens" due to the lack of events and encounters, the lack of variety in missions and activities, and that the grid layout of Manhattan made navigation and exploration "tedious". The gun mechanics of ''The Division'' were described as being "standard" and more in line with the more realistic feel of other ''Tom Clancy''-branded games, with guns that had distinct feels due to their varying statistics, and that "the fact that the action leans so heavily on smart tactics makes it rewarding when the last foe in a pack finally goes down." &lt;ref name="ign-review"/&gt;

The progression system was also criticized for being "fractured", requiring that players visit multiple locations with different systems in order to upgrade their abilities, explaining that "[it's] hard to accurately gauge just how strong you really are, and as a result, easy to get in over your head in a mission that your character level indicates you can handle." While noting that its "post-game" content was mainly limited to harder versions of story missions with stronger "bullet sponge" enemies, Ingenito praised the Dark Zone for "[fixing] just about every problem I have with ''The Division's'' pacing, its lack of player-driven moments, and the overall toothlessness and emptiness of its open world", by adding an "omnipresent" danger and a higher degree of risk to player interactions. In conclusion, Ingenito felt that the game's ideas and mechanics were "not spread evenly or interwoven cleanly enough to form a cohesive, consistently enjoyable loop".&lt;ref name="ign-review"/&gt;

{{anchor|Notable glitch}}Prior to version 1.0.2 of the game, named enemy [[non-player character|NPCs]] would respawn indefinitely, as long as their entourage of minions were never killed. This allowed players to collect the named enemies' superior and high-end loot over and over again. The most popular target of this [[exploit (video game)|exploit]] was a character known as the Bullet King, as this character was the named enemy closest to any player spawn point in the game.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kotaku.com.au/2016/03/heres-a-good-way-to-farm-items-and-phoenix-credits-inthe-division/ Here's a Good Way to Farm Items and Phoenix Credits in ''The Division''].

===Sales===
According to Ubisoft, the game broke company records, including highest number of first-day sales&lt;ref name="UbiFirstDay"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Varanini|first1=Giancarlo|title=The Division Breaks Ubisoft Records|url=http://blog.ubi.com/the-division-sets-new-sales-records/|website=Ubiblog|accessdate=April 30, 2016|date=March 9, 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318050333/http://blog.ubi.com/the-division-sets-new-sales-records/|archivedate=18 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (breaking the record previously set by ''[[Watch Dogs]]'' in 2014), and becoming the company's best-selling game.

[[File:WoodcockTrapLine.jpg|thumb|A photo of a trapper on his line from the 1913 American autobiography ''[[Fifty Years a Hunter and Trapper]]'']]
[[File:Brooks Range (29) Trapper's cabin.jpg|thumb|A photo of a modern trapper's cabin from the [[Brooks Range]] in [[Alaska]]]]
In the [[fur trade]], a '''trapline''' is a route along which a [[trapping|trapper]] sets traps for his or her quarry.  Trappers traditionally move habitually along the route to set and check the traps, in so doing become skilled at traversing remote terrain, and become experts in the geography of the local area.  Because of this [[traditional knowledge]], traplines are not only of interest to trappers themselves but to researchers and others (governments, corporations) interested in local history, biology, and topography.  The assignment of particular trapline territories to individuals in [[band societies]] was traditionally handled by group consensus, and occasionally violence and warfare.  In the present-day trapline assignment is typically formalized and controlled by the state.  Formalized trapline territory boundaries now form the basis for many major land-use projects in fur-rich regions.

One of the entitlements that goes along with possessing a trap territory is the right to erect a '''trapper’s cabin''': a simple shelter in which a trapper can stay while moving around his territory. Trappers' cabins are a [[cultural icon]] of fur regions, and an important part of the [[national mythos]] of countries and regions such as [[Canada]] and [[Alaska]], and among groups such as the [[Métis people|Métis]].

== Pre-treaty indigenous governance of trapping and other harvesting ==
{{see|Keyoh}}
Before European colonisation, determining where a particular family or band could hunt, fish, and gather without encroaching on others to the point of over-harvesting was the main preoccupation of indigenous governance in the [[subartic peoples|subarctic]] and other non-farming regions.  Councils were convened to reconcile disputes and warfare was always a possibility.

When European traders began exporting bulk amounts of fur to Europe in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries, the trapping territories of the subarctic became much more commercially valuable and disputes intensified.

== Registered traplines ==
In Canada formal trapping territories assigned by the state are typically called "'''registered traplines'''" (RTLs), though each province administers its own system; they have been common across Canada since the 1930s.

Alberta's registered traplines were once exactly that: lines which followed a [[Stream|creek]] or other feature, but in the 1960s they were switched to a system of trapping territories.&lt;ref name="Notzke"&gt;Notzke, 125.&lt;/ref&gt;

In British Columbia "the registered trapline system continues to be the primary system for setting harvest guidelines and managing furbearing animals". It is an offence to trap an animal on a registered trapline that does not belong to you in BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/fw/wildlife/hunting/regulations/1214/docs/trapping_Section.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140114140542/http://www.env.gov.bc.ca/fw/wildlife/hunting/regulations/1214/docs/trapping_Section.pdf |archivedate=2014-01-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Manitoba has had registered traplines since 1940; they were brought in at that time to stop a wave of new arrivals in [[Northern Manitoba]] from trapping out an area that was already overharvested by the local, mostly [[First Nations in Manitoba|First Nations]], population.  The system is administered under the province's ''[[Mantioba Wildlife Act|Wildlife Act]]''.  Lines cannot be sold, inherited, or handed down, but are awarded through a points system, where preference is given to people with a close family relationship to the previous lineholder, a history of using that trapline with the permission of the previous lienholder, and residency near the territory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gov.mb.ca/conservation/wildlife/trapping/rtl_lines.html |title=Manitoba Trapping Guide &amp;#124; Wildlife &amp; Ecosystem Protection — Conservation &amp;#124; Province of Manitoba |publisher=Gov.mb.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2013}} Ontario has more than 2,800 registered traplines on [[Crown land]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mnr.gov.on.ca/en/Business/FW/2ColumnSubPage/STEL02_168422.html |title=Trapping in Ontario - Ontario Government, Ministry of Natural Resources |publisher=Mnr.gov.on.ca |date= |accessdate=2014-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the 2001 ''[[Paix des braves]]'' agreement, trapline territories have been used as the basis for forestry and mining planning in the [[Eeyou Istchee (territory)|Eeyou Istchee territory]], in [[Quebec]].&lt;ref name="TindallTrosper2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=D.B. Tindall|author2=Ronald Trosper|author3=Pamela Perreault|title=Aboriginal Peoples and Forest Lands in Canada|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gdfzyzKjJg0C&amp;pg=PA143|date=11 February 2013|publisher=UBC Press|isbn=978-0-7748-2336-4|page=143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Indigenous land claims ===
Indigenous peoples have not always welcomed the regulation of the fur industry by provincial authorities, and the assignment of trapping territories by the provincial Crown implies that the land is ultimately the property of the province, to be disposed of at its will, rather than subject to [[Comanagement in Canada|comanagement]] under the terms of the treaties.  Furthermore, having to apply to provincial authorities to distribute traplines removes control of the process from local Indigenous forms of governance, and institutionalizes a non-Indigenous presence on traditional lands.&lt;ref name="Notzke" /&gt;  Nevertheless, as registered traplines provide Aboriginal peoples with legal rights to a piece of land off-reserve, a potential economic livelihood, and a connection to a traditional lifestyle, registered traplines are considered of the utmost importance for many First Nations and Metis communities.&lt;ref&gt;Notzke, 126.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="827">The '''Três Estrelas''' book imprint, owned by [[Grupo Folha]], was created in 2012 and covers the non-fiction field, with books on journalism, communication, history, politics, sociology, economics, philosophy, psychoanalysis, scientific information and biography.

The first titles launched were “A Perfeição Não Existe", by Tostão; "História da Imprensa Paulista", by Oscar Pilagallo; and "Diário da Corte", by [[Paulo Francis]].

The imprint’s name was inspired by the three stars that accompany the logo of [[Folha de S.Paulo]], the flagship newspaper published by the company that owns the imprint.
