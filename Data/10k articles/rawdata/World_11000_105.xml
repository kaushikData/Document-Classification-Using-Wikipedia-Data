'''93.3 Central FM''' (93.3 [[FM broadcasting|FM]]) was a non-profit community [[radio station]] based on the island of [[Malta]] and serving mainly [[three villages of Malta]]: [[Attard]], [[Lija]] and [[Balzan]]. 93.3 Central FM went on air on {{cn-span|15 January 2006|reason=The ref to the Malta Times already mentioned the station in 2004|date=June 2016}}.

==Overview==
The station was founded and managed by Maltese radio personality [[Andre` Bugeja]] and [[Clayton Camilleri]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesofmalta.com/articles/view/20040805/local/new-community-radio.115976 |title=New community radio |newspaper=Times of Malta |date=5 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Located in Attard, a central and densely populated location on the island of Malta, Central FM managed to reach a wide audience thanks to its ongoing, community centric and entertaining programming. The station transmitted on 93.3&amp;nbsp;MHz from the center of Malta and all around the world on the World Wide Web.

The station motto was 'Transmitting from the center of the island' ("{{lang|mt|L-istazzjon li jxandar mic-centru ta' Malta}}").

93.3 Central FM also trained various young aspiring radio presenters who have today managed to follow a professional media career. The station was the first ever [[community radio]] station on the Maltese islands to broadcast using high radio standards. CentralFM was also famous amongst the English-speaking community as it collaborated with a number of foreign radio personalities stationed in America, UK, and Australia .

Central FM terminated its broadcast due to personal commitments from the management who stated they would be working on new projects in the future.

'''Days for Girls''' ('''DfG''') is a global movement that prepares and distributes sustainable menstrual health solutions to girls who would otherwise miss school during their monthly periods. The [[nonprofit organization]] was founded in 2008 by American woman '''Celeste Mergens'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://news.impactalpha.com/by-women-for-women-the-new-economics-of-menstrual-pads-in-africa-a6e1ace71ba0|title=By women, for women: The new economics of menstrual pads in Africa|last=Thorpe|first=Devin|date=2018-01-09|work=ImpactAlpha|access-date=2018-02-19|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; After visiting an orphanage in [[Nairobi]], Kenya, she discovered that [[menstruation|menstruating]] girls stayed in their dormitories for days, sitting on cardboard to absorb their flow, because they could not afford [[feminine hygiene]] products. Her first response was to organize donations of disposable sanitary pads, but she realized that this was not a sustainable solution — and the girls had no way to dispose of used pads. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ecwid.com/blog/case-study-days-for-girls.html|title=Days for Girls: Improving Girls’ Access to Education, One DfG Kit at a Time|last=Hoffman|first=Ashley|work=Ecwid|access-date=2018-02-20|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She then developed the idea of creating washable, reusable pads and providing the girls with a personal kit of all they would need to continue their schooling with hygiene and dignity.&lt;ref name="mccray"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/health/celeste-mergens-days-for-girls|title=Period Drama: Helping Girls Around the World Navigate "That Time of the Month"|last1=Mccray|first1=Linzee Kull|date=January 7, 2014|website=|publisher=Oprah.com|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 2018, the DfG Kits (designed to last up to three years) and health education programs had reached more than one million girls and women in over 100 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.daysforgirls.org/single-post/2018/01/04/One-Million-And-Counting|title=One Million...

[[File:Droeba - Ilia.jpg|thumb|A ''droeba'' issue with Prince [[Ilia Chavchavadze]]'s article on its front page]]
'''''Droeba''''' ({{Lang-ka|დროება}}, "the Times") was an influential [[Georgian language|Georgian]] political and cultural newspaper published in [[Tiflis]] from 1866 to 1885. 

''Droeba'' first came out in Tiflis, the capital of the Russian [[Caucasus Viceroyalty (1844–1881 CE)|Caucasus Viceroyalty]], on March 4, 1866, to be published thrice weekly and then daily from 1877.&lt;ref name="Rayfield"&gt;[[Rayfield, Donald]] (2000), ''[[The Literature of Georgia: A History]]'', p. 150. [[Routledge]], {{ISBN|0-7007-1163-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The paper was published by S. Melikishvili from 1866 to 1882 and then by [[Giorgi Kartvelishvili]] from 1882 to 1885. At various times, it was edited by leading Georgian intellectuals, including [[Ilia Chavchavadze]] and [[Ivane Machabeli]]. The newspaper, in which most major Georgian writers, journalists and social activists of that time were published, was an energetic promoter of the Georgian national idea. The younger radical Georgian literati used the pages of ''droeba'' to introduce their readers to the ideas of progressive liberal thinkers like [[John Stuart Mill]] and "[[utopian socialism|utopian socialists]]" like [[Robert Owen]], [[Claude Henri de Rouvroy, comte de Saint-Simon|Saint-Simon]], [[Charles Fourier]], [[Pierre Proudhon]], and [[Louis Blanc]].&lt;ref name="Suny"&gt;[[Ronald Grigor Suny|Suny, Ronald Grigor]] (1994), ''The Making of the Georgian Nation'', p. 131. [[Indiana University Press]], {{ISBN|0-253-20915-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, it became more closely associated with the new generation of the Georgian national movement, known as ''meore dasi'' ("the second group") and led by [[Niko Nikoladze]], which sought widely for a program of various forms of [[capitalism]] and [[Western world|Westernization]].&lt;ref name="Suny"/&gt; The division of the Georgian intellectuals over the issues related to financial and economical projects was also reflected on the pages of ''droeba''. This was one reason for Ilia Chavchavadze to leave the editorial board of ''droeba'' and found his own newspaper ''iveria''.&lt;ref&gt;Suny, Ronald Grigor (1996),  ''Transcaucasia, Nationalism and Social Change'', pp. 128-129. [[University of Michigan Press]], {{ISBN|0-472-06617-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newspaper was closed on the order of the Russian viceroy [[Alexander Dondukov-Korsakov]] on September 16, 1885.&lt;ref&gt;Jersild, Austin (2002), ''Orientalism and Empire: North Caucasus Mountain Peoples and the Georgian Frontier, 1845-1917'', p. 129.

'''''Fattypuffs and Thinifers''''' ({{ISBN|1-903252-07-5}}) is a 1941 translation of the French [[children's book]] ''Patapoufs et Filifers'' originally written in 1930 by [[André Maurois]].  It concerns the imaginary underground land of the fat and congenial Fattypuffs and the thin and irritable Thinifers, which is visited by the Double brothers, the plump Edmund and the thin Terry.  Fattypuffs and Thinifers do not mix, and their respective countries are on the verge of war when Edmund and Terry make their visit.

==Plot summary==
Edmund and Terry find the entrance through the Twin Rock, where a long [[escalator]] descends into the bowels of the earth.  The underground region is illuminated by large [[balloon]]s filled with a blue, dazzling gas, which float in the underground sky.
   
At the bottom of the escalator a narrow [[quay]], ''Surface-by-the-Sea'', borders a large gulf.  Edmund and Terry are separated here.  Edmund is taken to Fattyborough, the capital of the Fattypuff kingdom, on the ship ''Fattiport'', while Terry is ordered to board the steel vessel ''Thiniport'' for Thiniville, capital of the Thinifer Republic.

Edmund soon assumes an important position in the administration of Fattypuff, whose inhabitants are friendly, happy, and who live only for drinking and eating.  Everything there is round and cushioned; the architecture is domes and baroque.  Terry also rises through the ranks quickly in the land of the Thinifers, [[workaholic]]s all, who scarcely eat, and who rush to and from their country, which is all high, sharp spires and thin railway cars.

For centuries Fattypuffs and Thinifers have been mortal enemies, having fought one another already in the ''War of the Captive Armies''.  Their main source of tension lies over ownership of an island in the gulf that separates the countries, and what to call it - the Fattypuffs prefer "Fattyfer," the Thinifers "Thinipuff."  Negotiations, in which Edmund and Terry participate, are unsuccessful, and the countries go to war.  The Thinifers emerge as the victors, and annex the Fattypuff kingdom.

The consequences of this annexation are unexpected.  Many soldiers of the occupying army of the Thinifers begin to marry Fattypuff girls, and return to their homeland with affection for the country that they conquered.  The Thinifers begin to adopt Fattypuff cuisine, habits, and attitudes.  Consequently, the Thinifer president proclaims that the two peoples form a new nation, the ''United States of the Underground''.  King Plumpapuff of the Fattypuffs is made constitutional sovereign, while the Thinifer president is made his [[chancellor]].  All distinctions by weight are abolished.  A [[toponymy|toponymic]] compromise is reached: the island of ''Fattyfer-Thinipuff'' is called ''Peachblossom Island''.

Edmund and Terry are allowed to return home, where their father has been looking for them at the base of the Twin Rock.  They spent ten months underground, but only an hour has passed on the surface.

George Millar wrote: "Technically, Maurois' book belong to the subgenre of [[Hollow Earth]] fantasies, imagining vast countries stretching in enormous caverns right there under our feet, like ''[[Journey to the Center of the Earth]]'' penned by Maurois' illustrious countryman. However, the underground location need not be taken too seriously. Maurois was writing a political fantasy and parable, not a physical one.(...) The code in not really difficult to unravel. Two countries who are hereditary enemies, with divergent cultures and ways of life—one endlessly, pedantically precise and methodical, the other addicted to gourmet food and the good things of life - who can they be but Germans and French.(...) On this basis Maurois can be credited with predicting that there would be a new war and that France would be occupied by Germany; he can also be credited with predicting that there would be ultimately a reconciliation and an end to the prolonged enmity between these two countries - even if the actual EU falls a bit short of the complete unification in the story's happy ending...".&lt;ref&gt;George D. Millar, "Literary and Journalistic Predictions of the Second World War in the 1920's and 1930's" in Margaret Cassiof, ''Round-Up of Critical Essays in 20th Century History and Literature''.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Favarger''' is a [[Swiss chocolate]] maker founded in 1826. It is located in [[Versoix]], [[Canton of Geneva]], [[Switzerland]].

In 2003, the majority of shares of Favarger were acquired by Luka Rajic. His intention is to ally the traditional know-how of this chocolate specialist with new managerial competences in order to develop the brand in Switzerland and abroad.

The [[flag]] of [[Hezbollah]], while sometimes found in different colours, is usually composed of the green logo of the [[Shi'a Islam|Shi'a]] political/military organization Hezbollah, upon a yellow background with text above and below the logo in red (or sometimes green).

The logo itself is a stylized representation of the Arabic words {{lang|ar|حزب الله}} ''ḥizbu-llāh'' (meaning "Party of God") in [[Kufic]] script. The first letter of "[[Allah]]" reaches up to grasp a stylized [[assault rifle]], which combines elements of the [[H&amp;K G3]] battle rifle and the [[AK-47]] assault rifle. The logo also incorporates several other objects, namely a globe, a book, a sword, and a seven-leafed branch. The text above the logo reads {{lang|ar|فإن حزب الله هم الغالبون}} ''fa-inna ḥizbu llāh hum al-ġālibūn'') and means "Then surely the party of God are they that shall be triumphant" ([[Quran]] [[Al-Ma'ida|5]]:56), which is a reference to the name of the party. Underneath the logo are the words {{lang|ar|المقاومة الإسلامية في لبنان}} ''al-muqāwamah al-islāmīyah fī lubnān'', meaning "The Islamic Resistance in Lebanon".

The flag was designed by Ali Salih, an artist from [[Brital]], with the help of Abdul ar-Rahman Mazlūm from the same village.{{Citation needed|date=September 2009}} The flag has some similarity with the emblem of [[Iran]]'s [[Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps|Revolutionary Guard]].

The '''Frabosana''' is a [[breed]] of [[sheep]] from the valleys of the [[Monregalese]], the area around Mondovì in the [[province of Cuneo]], in [[Piemonte]] in north-west Italy.&lt;ref name=dad/&gt; It takes its name from the [[comuni]] of [[Frabosa Soprana]] and [[Frabosa Sottana]], and was once the most numerous sheep breed of Piemonte.&lt;ref name=bigi/&gt;&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt; It is raised in the [[Valle Gesso]], the [[Valle Grana]], the [[Valle Pesio]], the [[Valle Vermenagna]] and the [[Valli Monregalesi]] in the [[provinces of Italy|province]] of Cuneo, and in the [[Val Pellice]] in the [[province of Turin]].&lt;ref name=rare2/&gt; Two types are recognised within the breed, the Roaschino in the [[Ligurian Alps]], and the slightly smaller Frabosana raised in the area of Mondovì. The Frabosana is one of the forty-two autochthonous local sheep breeds of limited distribution for which a herdbook is kept by the [[Associazione Nazionale della Pastorizia]], the Italian national association of sheep-breeders.&lt;ref name=aspa/&gt;

The conservation status of the breed was listed as "not at risk" by the [[FAO]] in 2007.&lt;ref name=barb/&gt; In 2013 total numbers for the breed were 4284.&lt;ref name=aspa2/&gt;

'''Gurzil''' or '''Agurzil''' was a [[war deity]] of the [[Berbers|ancient Berbers]].

In [[traditional Berber religion|ancient Berber religion]], Gurzil was a bull-shaped war god who became identified with the son of [[Amun|Amun (Ammon)]]. He was taken by the Berbers to their battles against the [[Ancient Rome|Romans]]. 

In the sixth century, [[Corippus]] mentioned that [[Ierna]] -- chief of the Berber tribe known as the [[Laguatan]]s (or ''Luwata'', as they were later known to the [[Arabs]]) -- took his god Gurzil into battle against the [[Byzantine]]s. Ierna was a [[Berbers|Berber]] ruler and a high priest of Gurzil. After the [[Berbers]] were defeated, he fled with the "sacred image" of Gurzil, but was caught and killed and the image destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;John Morris, Arnold Hugh Martin Jones, John Robert: The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire p. 612&lt;/ref&gt; Gurzil was later taken by the Berber queen [[Dihya]] ("the Kahina") into her battles during [[Muslim conquest of the Maghreb]].

A temple among the ruins of [[Gerisa]] in Libya may have been dedicated to Gurzil, and the name of the town itself may even be related to his name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/16819163/Recherches-Sur-La-Religion-Des-Berberes-1910 |title=Recherches Sur La Religion Des Berberes |trans-title=Research on Berber Religion |author=[[René Basset]] |date=1910 |work=Revue de L’Histoire des Religions |accessdate=October 3, 2011}} {{language icon|fr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"[R]egulators increasingly regard clearing houses as central to financial stability (Hosking and Griffiths 2012)." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/business/economics/article3637678.ece |title=US exchange warns of redundancies after winning the battle for NYSE |author1=Patrick Hosking |author2=Katherine Griffiths |date=December 21, 2012 |accessdate=March 15, 2013 |publisher=The Times |location=London, UK }}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 19, 2012 The [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] designated ICE Clear Credit LLC as a [[Systemically important financial market utility]] (FMU). &lt;ref group=notes&gt;The [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (the Payment, Clearing and Settlement Supervision Act of 2010) mitigate financial risk in the financial system and promoting financial stability by giving the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve authority to set risk management standards for entities that have been designated as [[Systemically Important Financial Market Utilities]] (FMU) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).

This subjects this entity to enhanced regulatory oversight. "One of the concerns raised by regulatory bodies is the concentration of CDS trading in only a few dealer institutions in recent years. (Note that the top 10 global banks are involved in 70% of all credit derivatives transactions.) Over time, the use of clearinghouses such as ICE Trust [ICE Clear Credit LLC since July 16, 2011] is expected to reduce the volume of settlement payments among members of the clearinghouse and, in theory, reduce counterparty credit risks that arise under CDS. However, trading CDS through clearinghouses may not effectively address concentration risk given that, at least initially, the clearinghouse members will be the major dealers currently involved in most trades. In order to address counterparty risk, members must provide collateral to ICE Trust [ICE Clear Credit LLC since July 16, 2011] to cover their obligations under cleared CDS. Members must also make initial and ongoing contributions to a guaranty fund that can be used by ICE Trust in the event of a member default (Forrester et al 2009)." &lt;ref name=OTC2009 /&gt;

ICE Clear Credit LLC is regulated by the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]] (CFTC) as a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) and by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) as a Securities Clearing Agency (SCA).&lt;ref name=OfficeFairTrading /&gt;

On July 19, 2012 The [[Financial Stability Oversight Council]] designated ICE Clear Credit LLC as a [[Systemically important financial market utility]] (FMU). &lt;ref group=notes&gt;The [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]] (the Payment, Clearing and Settlement Supervision Act of 2010) mitigate financial risk in the financial system and promoting financial stability by giving the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve authority to set risk management standards for entities that have been designated as [[Systemically Important Financial Market Utilities]] (FMU) by the Financial Stability Oversight Council (FSOC).

==History==
In 2009 ICE Trust became a New York chartered bank for purposes of [[Federal Reserve Act]] &lt;ref name=FederalReserveApproval2009&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.federalreserve.gov/newsevents/press/orders/orders20090304a1.pdf |format=PDF |title=Federal Reserve System ICE US Trust LLC New York, New York Order Approving Application for Membership ICE US Trust LLC ("ICE Trust") |accessdate=March 15, 2013 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and was therefore eligible for membership in the [[Federal Reserve System]]. 

By 2010, Intercontinental Exchange had cleared more than $10 trillion &lt;ref name=businessweek1&gt;

Intercontinental's clearing houses guarantee every transaction between buyer and seller providing a much-needed safety net reducing the impact of a default by spreading the risk. ICE collects on every trade.(Terhune Bloomberg Business Week 2010-07-29).&lt;ref name=businessweek1 /&gt; Brookings senior research fellow, Robert E. Litan, cautioned however, "valuable pricing data will not be fully reported, leaving ICE's institutional partners with a huge informational advantage over other traders. He calls ICE Trust [now ICE Clear Credit] "a derivatives dealers' club" in which members make money at the expense of nonmembers (Terhune citing Litan in Bloomberg Business Week 2010-07-29).&lt;ref name=businessweek1 /&gt; (Litan Derivatives Dealers’ Club 2010)." &lt;ref name=Litan&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actually, Litan conceded that "some limited progress toward central clearing of CDS has been made in recent months, with CDS contracts between dealers now being cleared centrally primarily through one clearinghouse (ICE Trust) [ICE Trust [now ICE Clear Credit] in which the dealers have a significant financial interest (Litan 2010:6)." &lt;ref name=Litan /&gt; However, "as long as ICE Trust [now ICE Clear Credit] has a monopoly in clearing, watch for the dealers to limit the expansion of the products that are centrally cleared, and to create barriers to electronic trading and smaller dealers making competitive markets in cleared products (Litan 2010:8)." &lt;ref name=Litan /&gt;

The [[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]] granted an exemption for IntercontinentalExchange to begin guaranteeing credit-default swaps. The SEC exemption represented the last regulatory approval needed by Atlanta-based Intercontinental. Its larger competitor, [[CME Group|CME Group Inc.]], hasn’t received an SEC exemption, and agency spokesman John Nester said he didn’t know when a decision would be made.

On March 4, 2009, ICE announced that ICE US Trust, LLC (ICE Trust), a New York limited liability trust company, received regulatory approval from the Board of Governors of the [[Federal Reserve System]] &lt;ref name="FederalReserveApproval2009"/&gt; to become a member of the Federal Reserve System and to serve as a [[Clearing house (finance)|clearing house]] and central counterparty for [[credit default swap]] (CDS) transactions, initially for North American CDS indexes and later adding liquid single-name swaps. Now known as ICE Clear Credit LLC it is subject to direct regulation and supervision by the CFTC and the SEC.

Also in March 2009 ICE acquired The Clearing Corporation (TCC). This acquisition provided the risk management framework, operational processing and clearing infrastructure for CDS clearing. ICE paid TCC's cash on hand at the close, $39 million more in cash and gave profit participation of less than 35% of the total to be paid to the 10 initial clearing members of TCC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICE Clear Credit Regulation and Governance FACT SHEET May 2012|url=https://www.theice.com/publicdocs/clear_credit/ICE_Clear_Credit_Regulation_and_Governance.pdf|accessdate=22 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ICE Clear Credit LLC received temporary no-action assurances from CFTC to exempt ICE swap market participants from various requirements under the [[Commodity Exchange Act]] (CEA), that would otherwise apply to certain swap transactions as a result [[Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act]].  The exemption was based on the premise that the Dodd-Frank Act reflected an "underlying policy to facilitate the central clearing of CDS transactions to reduce systemic risk in the global financial markets, while also minimizing unnecessary disruption and costs to the markets." &lt;ref name=SEC2011July16&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sec.gov/divisions/investment/noaction/2011/iceclearcredit072911-17f6.htm |publisher=US Securities and Exchange Commission |date=July 16, 2011 |title=Investment Company Act of 1940 — Section 17(f) and Rule 17f-6 ICE Clear Credit LLC |accessdate=March 15, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an article published in the [[New York Times]] (December 11, 2010) Louise Story &lt;ref name=StoryNYT&gt;{{cite news |author=Story, Louise |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/12/business/12advantage.html?hp |title=A Secretive Banking Elite Rules Trading in Derivatives |publisher=[[The New York Times]] |date=December 11, 2010 |accessdate=March 15, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; argued that members of ICE Clear Credit LLC powerful risk committee drawn from banks like [[Deutsche Bank]], [[JPMorgan Chase]], [[Goldman Sachs]] and [[Morgan Stanley]], "helps oversee trading in derivatives ... [and also] share a common goal: to protect the interests of big banks in the vast market for derivatives, one of the most profitable — and controversial — fields in finance," a system with "costly implications" for customers and smaller banks. "The marketplace as it functions now 'adds up to higher costs to all Americans,' said [[Gary Gensler]], the chairman of the [[Commodity Futures Trading Commission]], which regulates most derivatives. More oversight of the banks in this market is needed, he said."&lt;ref name=StoryNYT /&gt; In the same month, ICE said it was "well positioned" to establish a [[Swap Execution Facility]] (SEF), having met with Commissioner Gensler or his staff four times in the past year to discuss SEF registration. An SEF or multiple SEFs will be the derivatives-trading platform(s) newly required under [[Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act|Dodd-Frank]] financial-markets reform. Other firms said to be looking at becoming SEFs were [[Bloomberg LP]], [[Thomson Financial|Thomson TradeWeb]], Parity Energy,&lt;ref name=CFTC&gt;{{cite web |publisher=CFTC Agenda |url=http://www.cftc.gov/ucm/groups/public/@newsroom/documents/file/agenda033111.pdf |format=PDF |title=Commissioner O’Malia’s SEF Showcase: Current Technology &amp; Market Direction |date=March 31, 2011 |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[MarketAxess]].&lt;ref&gt;Protess, Ben, [https://dealbook.nytimes.com/2010/12/17/swap-execution-facility-the-new-term-on-wall-street/ "Swap Execution Facility: The New Term on Wall Street"], December 17, 2010, 9:47 am. Retrieved 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt; In a call with investors on November 1, CEO Sprecher had discussed the company's position in and preparation across its numerous markets, including the prospects for SEFs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://seekingalpha.com/article/233887-intercontinentalexchange-ceo-discusses-q3-2010-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=thestreet "IntercontinentalExchange CEO Discusses Q3 2010 Results - Earnings Call Transcript"], ''[[Seeking Alpha]]'', November 01, 2010. Retrieved 2010-12-22.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2011, ICE Trust U.S. changed its name to ICE Clear Credit. At that time it registered with the Commodity Futures Trading Commission as a Derivatives Clearing Organization and with the Securities and Exchange Commission as a Securities Clearing Agency.

The '''Jenolan Caves''' ([[Tharawal language|Tharawal]]: '''''Binoomea''''', '''''Bindo''''', '''''Binda'''''&lt;ref name=gnb&gt;{{NSW GNR|id=MaYbwprXJP|title=Jenolan Caves|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are [[limestone cave|limestone]] [[cave]]s located within the '''Jenolan Karst Conservation Reserve''' in the [[Central Tablelands]] region, west of the [[Blue Mountains (New South Wales)|Blue Mountains]], in [[New South Wales]], in eastern Australia. The caves and {{convert|3083|ha|adj=on}} reserve are situated approximately {{convert|175|km}} west of [[Sydney]], {{convert|20|km}} east of {{NSWcity|Oberon}} and {{convert|30|km}} west of [[Katoomba, New South Wales|Katoomba]].

The caves are the most visited of several similar groups in the limestone caves of the country, and the most ancient discovered open caves in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-07-25/tests-show-jenolan-caves-among-worlds-oldest/1809928|title=Tests show Jenolan Caves among world's oldest|work=[[ABC News (Australia)|ABC News]]|location=Australia|date=25 July 2006|accessdate=18 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Colchester, D.

{{blockquote|''Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its historical, aesthetic, research and rarity values. The caves and karst landscapes developed as important scientific and tourist destinations throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, and the Reserve is highly significant as the first public reserve set aside in NSW for the protection of a natural resource—in this case, the Jenolan Caves.''|Statement of significance, [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]], 2004.}}

==Etymology==
The word ''Jenolan'' is believed to be an [[Indigenous languages of Australia|indigenous word]] for "high place";&lt;ref name=gnb/&gt; derived from the Tharawal word, ''Genowlan'', for a "high place shaped like a foot". An alternative (although highly unlikely) meaning comes from the name "J E Nolan" that was found smoked by a candle on the roof of a cave.&lt;ref name=gnb/&gt;

== History ==

===Geology===
By [[K–Ar dating|measuring the ratio]] of [[Potassium-40|radioactive potassium]] and trapped [[Isotopes of argon#Argon-40|argon]] gas, which was produced when the potassium decayed, scientists determined the age of the clay in the caves to be approximately 340&amp;nbsp;million years old, thereby making the cave complex the world's oldest known and dated open cave system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|title=Jenolan Caves 340 million years old: study|date=25 July 2006|publisher=[[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation|CSIRO]]|url=http://www.csiro.au/Organisation-Structure/Divisions/Earth-Science--Resource-Engineering/Jenolan-Caves-340-million-years-old-study.aspx|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation]] (CSIRO) in association with the [[University of Sydney]] and the [[Australian Museum]] lead the efforts in scientific research into the caves.

===Indigenous culture===
For thousands of years, the Jenolan area has been part of the culture of local [[Indigenous Australians|indigenous]] peoples. The area holds significance to the [[Gundungurra]] and [[Wiradjuri]] peoples, who knew it as ''Binomil'' or ''Bin-oo-mur'', and a variety of similar names.&lt;ref name=pom/&gt; A [[Dreamtime]] creation story of the Gundungurra people describes how the countryside came into being, and involves a struggle between two ancestral creator spirits – one a giant eel-like creature, Gurangatch, and the other, Mirrigan, a large native cat or quoll. The Gundungurra people penetrated the caves as far as the subterranean water, carrying sick people to be bathed in this water, which they believed to have curative powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jenolancaves.org.au/about/aboriginal-culture/healing-waters/|title=Healing Waters|publisher=Jenolan Caves|accessdate=5 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===European discovery===
There are no known contemporaneous accounts of the discovery of the caves by Europeans – though Charles Whalan is attributed as the first to conduct visitors to the caves in the 1840s.&lt;ref name="reprints"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nla.gov.au/apps/doview/nla.aus-f18433-p.pdf|title=The Late Charles Whalan of Oberon|work=Bathurst Free Press and the Weekly Advocate (Sydney)|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]|quote=attributes discovery of cave mouth to James Whalan in 1838, while in pursuit of the theif{{sic|?}} James McKeown, but the exploration and opening up of the caves to visitors to his brother Charles Whalan (who lived nearby)|date=1887}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in Charles Whalan's obituary and other sources, credit for the caves' discovery is given to his brother, James Whalan.&lt;ref name="reprints"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jenolancaves.weebly.com/lithgow-mercury-april-7th-1899.html|title=Extract from submission to ''Lithgow Mercury'' by Jeremiah Wilson on 4 April 1899|date=7 April 1899|quote=Clarification on the Discovery of Jenolan Caves by Jeremiah Wilson (first "official" guide) written 50 years after discovery}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though most accounts were written some decades after the initial discovery, and differ somewhat in the details, it is generally accepted that in 1838 (or possibly 1841), James Whalan was in pursuit of an ex-convict and active local thief named McKeown, who had stolen livestock, tools, clothing and a flour grinder, was tracked to the area.&lt;ref name="officialhistory"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jenolancaves.org.au/about/history-of-jenolan-caves/|publisher=JenolanCaves.org.au|title=The History of Jenolan Caves}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this pursuit, James Whalan discovered the cave system and reported its existence to his brother Charles – who further explored the caves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article12945323 |title=NEWS FROM THE INTERIOR. |newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=25 April 1853|accessdate=17 December 2013|page=2|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article62045489|title=Police Office|newspaper=[[The Bathurst Advocate]]|location=NSW|date=13 May 1848|accessdate=17 December 2013|page=3|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article60275897|title=THE FISH RIVER STALACTIVE CAVES|newspaper=[[Empire (newspaper)|The Empire]]|location=Sydney|date=26 February 1857|accessdate=17 December 2013|page=5|publisher=[[National Library of Australia]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The caves, originally known as the [[Fish River (Oberon)|Fish River]] Caves, came under the control of the NSW Government in 1866—becoming only the second area in the world reserved for the purpose of conservation. The following year, Jeremiah Wilson was appointed as the first "Keeper of the Caves".&lt;ref name="officialhistory"/&gt; Wilson not only explored the already known Elder and Lucas Caves but later discovered the Imperial, Left Imperial (now known as Chifley), Jersey and Jubilee Caves.

The caves were open to tourism early, but there was little protection from visitors damaging formations until the collection of souvenirs and the writing of graffiti was banned in 1872. In 1884 the name Jenolan Caves was adopted.&lt;ref name=pom/&gt;

The road to the caves originally went via {{NSWcity|Tarana}}, which meant that travellers from the south had to take a long, roundabout route of about {{convert|90|mi}} from Katoomba to Oberon, and, from there, to Tarana. In the mid-1880s, hotel keepers in Katoomba wanted to improve business by constructing a road to the Caves from their town, but the steep, rough ground between the caves and town was a major obstacle, and several attempts failed. However, representations were made to the [[Premier of New South Wales|Premier]] by Peter Fitzpatrick of Burragorang, who was connected to some mining operations near Katoomba. In April 1884, William Marshall Cooper, Surveyor of Public Parks for the State Government, was assigned the job, and worked out a horse-and-carriage track in a 10-day trek from Katoomba to the Caves. The route was, he remarked, 26.5 miles from the Western Hotel in Katoomba. "... Anyone accustomed to walking can do it comfortably in 12 hours ... when the proposed horse track is completed, it will be a very enjoyable ride of five hours." It became known as the [[Six Foot Track]].

By 1885, Parliament had approved [[Australian pound|A₤]]2,500 for the construction of Cooper's bridle track, with the work starting at the most difficult area, the Megalong Cleft, where a zig-zag had to be cut, partly in solid rock, to reduce the grade to 1:5.5.&lt;ref&gt;"Track from Katoomba to Jenolan Caves" by W. M. Cooper, Surveyor of Public Parks, published in Sydney, Australia, 1885, copy at National Library of Australia (nla.map-rm1826-s2-e)&lt;/ref&gt; The first recorded passage of the completed bridle track from Katoomba to Jenolan was by the [[Governor of New South Wales|Governor]], [[Charles Wynn-Carington, 1st Marquess of Lincolnshire|Lord Carrington]], in September 1887. Lord Carrington also made the first official visit to the caves at the completion of his journey, accompanied by Wilson.

In 1898 the current [[Jenolan Caves House]] was built, replacing the earlier wooden accommodation house built by Jeremiah Wilson, which had been partially destroyed in 1895 by fire.

J. C. (Voss) Wiburd became "Keeper of the Caves" in 1903 and discovered (with fellow guide and friend Jack Edwards) five more caves within eighteen months: the River, Pool of Cerberus, Temple of Baal, Orient and Ribbon Caves. He remained Keeper until 1932, when he left due to the Government's policy at the time of compulsory retirement at the age of 65.

The Chifley Cave, originally known as the Left Imperial Cave, was renamed in 1952 in honour of [[Ben Chifley]], the recently retired [[Division of Macquarie|Federal local member of parliament]] and former [[Prime Minister of Australia|Prime Minister]]. This cave was the first of the caves to be lit with electric light, as early as 1880. In 1968, the Orient Cave became the first in the world to be cleaned, due to contamination by mud from the previous access route and a nearby coal boiler. The soot from the boiler was entering the cave via a new tunnel blasted 400 feet through to the Orient cave in 1954 to allow easier access (entering at Bat End). Steam cleaning was found to be damaging to the crystal formations, due to the rapid expansion and contraction caused by the heat from the steam, and these days water from the caves' own underground rivers is used if cave cleaning becomes necessary.

Since 2011, the CSIRO in association with the [[Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation]] began using a new hand-held mapping system to map some of the caves in three-dimensional detail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/environment/climate-change/jenolan-caves-sheltering-climate-secrets-20121215-2bgck.html|title=Jenolan Caves sheltering climate secrets|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=16 December 2012|accessdate=16 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|align="left"| The Jubilee Cave is the longest show cave at Jenolan. It takes the longest amount of time to visit as it is fairly remote from the other caves. Of the caves shown at Jenolan to the public it is the least visited due to the length of the tour and the small tour groups that can be taken there.

|align="left"| This cave consists of only two large chambers, one of which is dominated by the huge 9-metre shawl formation called the Angel's Wing. The cave is also noted for a high incidence of the peculiar formations known as [[Helictite]]s. The name derives partly from the biblical story of [[Baal]] and other more obscure ancient mythology. The feature names in the cave also partly relate to the bilical story, as well as Esoteric Freemasonry. Recent 2006 development work has upgraded the lighting and added an audio accompaniment to the cave experience.

The cave takes its name from the nettles which grow near its entrance (note that raised walkways protect visitors from their stings); an upper part of this cave can be seen from inside the Devil's Coach House. Originally shown as a guided tour, the cave was closed to the public in 1932 and re-opened in 2006, combined with the adjoining Devil's Coach House. The Nettle Cave hosts "Crayfish backs", [[stromatolite]]s shaped by [[cyanobacteria]], light and wind. They are estimated to be at least 20,000 years old. Due to rock falls (made more probable by drought, according to the cave guides) the easy access path from the Grand Arch to the Devil's Coach House is currently closed. The open cave is best accessed via a 270-stair descent from the Carlotta Carpark.

Adjacent to the Grand Arch is the Devil's Coach House, a vast open-ended chamber that forms part of the many nature walks in the area. High above both of these is Carlotta Arch, a free-standing arch that is all that remains of a higher cavern system long since eroded and collapsed. Along with these areas, there are several other caves in the area, some of which are available for special tours.

|align="left"| Named from the [[Elder tree]], visitors would climb down to enter the doline (sinkhole). The Elder Cave was the first of the caves at Jenolan to be found and opened to tourists. It was later considered too difficult to develop adequately and tours eventually ceased; however, in the late 1990s the Elder Cave was re-opened for adventure caving, and is sold as the Plughole Tour. It is not as decorated as the regular show caves, but features signatures left by early visitors and includes a short section of the Imperial Cave.

==Tourism==

The Jenolan Caves are located three hours' drive from Sydney and [[Canberra]]. Private [[coach (bus)|coach]] companies operate day tours from Sydney and from [[Katoomba railway station]]. There is no public transport to Jenolan Caves. The caves attract over 250,000 visitors a year, making it one of the most popular tourist locations in rural New South Wales,{{citation needed|date=March 2013}} and has won numerous tourism awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jenolancaves.org.au/imagesDB/wysiwyg/AnnualReport0809.pdf|type=PDF|title=Jenolan Caves Reserve Trust. Annual Report. 2008 - 2009 |date=2009|publisher=Jenolan Caves Reserve Trust|page=3|accessdate=4 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically the caves were only accessible via the [[Six Foot Track]], a 45-kilometre-long bridle trail from [[Katoomba, New South Wales|Katoomba]] established in 1884. This trail became in disused in the early 1900s after new roads were built in the area, but was reopened as a [[Hiking|bushwalking]] track in 1984. It is now one of the most popular overnight bushwalks in the Blue Mountains area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sixfoottrack.com/six-foot-track-history-2/&lt;/ref&gt;

Ten of the area's "dark caves" are open for regular guided tours every day (1 to 2 hours per tour). These show cave tour sizes vary. For example, the delicate Pool of Cerberus Cave can have only 8 on a tour, while the Lucas Cave (with its large chambers) can have up to 65 people per tour.

Tours vary in difficulty. Imperial Cave, for example, has the fewest stairs, while the River Cave is the most strenuous. The average tourist can tour any of these show caves.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

A self-guided tour of the huge Nettle Cave/Devils Coach House is also available. The self-guided tour gives visitors a choice of many languages. One of the choices on the self-guided tour is an Aboriginal culture commentary.

Night tours run every night except Sundays, including the popular ghost tour, 'Legends, Mysteries &amp; Ghosts'.

Several undeveloped caves are available for adventure caving (2-hour to all-day tours). These adventure caving tours include the Plughole Tour, which runs daily and includes basic abseiling. Other more challenging adventure caving tours are available.{{citation needed|date=March 2013}}

The Cathedral Chamber, part of the "Lucas Cave" is famous for its acoustics. Underground concerts take place in this chamber. Concerts also take place in the Grand Arch, including the annual 'Carols in the Caves', which raises money for charity.

During school holidays, specially-developed tours are available for children. Jenolan Caves has long been a popular destination for school excursions.

===Jenolan Caves House===
{{main|Jenolan Caves House}}
Tourists visiting Jenolan Caves can stay at the heritage-listed Jenolan Caves House. It was designed in 1897 by government architect [[Walter Liberty Vernon]] as a resort or retreat for the wealthy. To cater for the expectations of the well-to-do, Vernon included a ballroom and grand dining room, now Chisolm's Restaurant. Chisolm's is open for dinner every day, serving modern Australian cuisine. Facilities include an hotel/motel complex, self-contained cottages, restaurant, bar, and cafe.

== Heritage listing ==
As at 15 June 2004, Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its historical, aesthetic, research and rarity values. The caves and karst landscapes developed as important scientific and tourist destinations throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries, and the Reserve is highly significant as the first public reserve set aside in NSW for the protection of a natural resource - in this case, the Jenolan Caves.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

The Reserve is highly regarded for the aesthetic qualities of the caves and cave formations, reflected in cave names such as Aladdin and Gem Cave; for the ability of the caves to demonstrate technological developments such as the first use of electric cave lighting in the 1880s, and the first development of hydro-electric power in Australia.  The setting of the caves hamlet in the Jenolan Valley, with the tiny hamlet and picturesque Caves House almost dwarfed by steeply rising cliffs on all sides, the entrance into the hamlet through the fortress-like Grand Arch, and the distinctive [[Blue Lake (New South Wales)|Blue Lake]] formed by the weir for the hydro-electric scheme, all combine to form a landscape of great beauty and distinctiveness.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

The Reserve has the ability to yield information on the geological history of NSW and of the Australian continent, and for the archaeological potential of the hamlet area to provide evidence of the early period in the development of tourism in NSW.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

The number of rare and uncommon flora and fauna species to which it is home, especially within the caves; and the evidence it can demonstrate of the development of tourism, especially mountain and caving tourism, in NSW, add to the significance of the Jenolan Caves Reserve (HO).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

The geomorphic history of the Jenolan Caves system is extremely complex, the cave system contains an exceptionally diverse variety of karst and cave types illustrating the full range of processes and products from incipient, scarcely perceptible depressions through to multistage cave developments and decayed remnant features.  The McKeowns Valley, north of Blue Lake contains the finest such assemblage in Australia.  The Jenolan River valley is one of the most outstanding fluviokarst valleys in the world. The range and diversity of the karst and decoration, including a remarkable diversity of mineral species, is varied, profuse and equal to the finest in the world.  The Jenolan Caves and surrounding areas contains a very diverse assemblage of morphologies and mineral species.  There is evidence in these features of the influences of palaeo-landscapes.
The contribution to the formation of the landscape of structural influences, lithological influences, and drainage patterns is the source of considerable scientific and educational interest at Jenolan.  The geomorphology of Jenolan includes a variety of non karstic phenomena that are important because of their relationship with the karst.  Because these features lie adjacent to, and in some cases over, the karst they give considerable insight into the formation of the karst. A large number of invertebrate fossils have been discovered in the limestone of the Jenolan Caves.  These include corals, stromatoporoids, algae, brachiopods, gastropods and straight nautiloids.  Subfossil remains of many vertebrates are also found in the caves.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

The caves provide shelter and habitat for a number of rare species including the sooty owl (TYTO TENEBRICOSA TENEBRICOSA) (rare in Australia) which roosts in the cave known as the Devil's Coach House and the Jenolan Caves Reserve supports a population of the brush tailed rock wallaby (PETROGALE PENICILLATA).  This species is listed as vulnerable on Schedule 12 of the NSW National Parks and Wildlife Act.  Also found in the caves is the opilionid arachnid (HOLONUNCIA CAVERNICOLA) which is known only from the Jenolan Caves system. The Caves Reserve contains three rare or endangered plant species. These are PSEUDANTHUS DIVARICATISSIMUS (3RC), GONOCARPUS LONGIFOLIUS (3RC), and GERANIUM GRANITICOLA (3RC).  In the latter half of the 19th century the caves were recognised as perhaps the premier natural attraction in Australia.  Although they no longer occupy this role, Jenolan remains one of the most important natural heritage areas in Australia.  The caves are a very high-profile natural feature in NSW.  The Jenolan Caves area is widely used as a research and teaching site for studying the geomorphology and processes involved in karst formation.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698-141&gt;RNE, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenolan is one of the most important areas of natural and cultural history in Australia.  The area includes one of the largest and most beautiful interconnected cave systems in Australia and is an outstanding site of geological and speleological interest.  The Jenolan River, Blue Lake and a system of intimate valleys and watercourses provide a magnificent setting for a distinctive range of native vegetation and fauna.  The Caves Reserve was created in 1866, six years before the declaration of the world's first National Park.  Since its reported discovery by James Whalan between 1838 and 1841 the area has attracted more than three million visitors.  Caves House, and its associated outbuildings, adds to the area's cultural significance. The area also contains a number of important industrial relics, including Australia's first hydro-electic power station and the remnants of the first electric lighting of caves which was installed in the Chifley Cave in 1887.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698-3339&gt;National Trust of Australia, 1985&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

Jenolan Caves was listed on the [[New South Wales State Heritage Register]] on 25 June 2004 having satisfied the following criteria.&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating the course, or pattern, of cultural or natural history in New South Wales.'''

Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its ability to demonstrate the significant historical activity of identifying and conserving the natural resources of NSW - in this case, the caves and karst landscapes that have developed as important scientific and tourist destinations throughout the late 19th and 20th centuries.  The Reserve is highly significant as the first public reserve set aside in NSW for the protection of a natural resource - in this case, the caves, and as such predates the creation of The National Park in 1879.  The caves hamlet illustrates the significant human activity of providing accommodation for travellers and tourists since the 1890s in romantic buildings especially designed for this purpose by the Government Architect (HO).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

'''The place has a strong or special association with a person, or group of persons, of importance of cultural or natural history of New South Wales's history.'''

Jenolan Caves Reserve is significant for its associations with Government Architect Walter Liberty Vernon, who design much of Caves House.  Although only the first or 1897 wing was built during his tenure, his plans were respected and adapted by subsequent government architects so that the original style and setting for the building has been largely maintained to the present day (HO).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

'''The place is important in demonstrating aesthetic characteristics and/or a high degree of creative or technical achievement in New South Wales.'''

Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for the highly regarded aesthetic qualities of the caves and cave formations, reflected in cave and formation names such as Aladdin, Orient and Temple of Baal caves and Gem, Arabesque, Angel's Wing and Pool of Reflections formations; for the ability of the caves to demonstrate technological developments such as the first use of electric cave lighting in the 1880s, and the first development of hydro-electric power in Australia.  The setting of the caves hamlet in the Jenolan Valley, with the tiny hamlet and picturesque Caves House almost dwarfed by steeply rising cliffs on all sides, the entrance into the hamlet through the fortress-like Grand Arch, and the distinctive Blue Lake formed by the weir for the hydro-electric scheme, all combine to form a landmark landscape of great beauty and distinctiveness (HO).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

'''The place is has strong or special association with a particular community or cultural group in New South Wales for social, cultural or spiritual reasons.'''

Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its associations with many groups of people, three of which have been particularly identified - tourists, speleologists (that is, those who study caves and engage in caving) and guides.  From the 1860s travellers and cavers have visited the Reserve, and cavers have continued to explore and make know to the public more of the caves, their connecting passages and the often unique plants and animals that inhabit this subterranean and lightless world.  The caves are also important to the community of caretakers and guides who for nearly 150 years have guided visitors through the caves, shown them the beauty and wonders of the caverns, interpreted and educated people about the geological history of eastern Australia, and made the caves hamlet their home (HO).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

'''The place has potential to yield information that will contribute to an understanding of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for its ability to yield information on the geological history of NSW and of the Australian continent, as the benchmark karst landscapes contained within the NSW reserve system, and for the archaeological potential of the hamlet area to provide evidence of the early period in the development of tourism in NSW (HO).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

'''The place possesses uncommon, rare or endangered aspects of the cultural or natural history of New South Wales.'''

The Jenolan Caves Reserve is of state significance for the number of rare and uncommon flora and fauna species to which it is home, especially within the caves; for containing the greatest diversity of cave invertebrates in NSW; and for the evidence it can demonstrate of the development of tourism, especially mountain and caving tourism, for over a century and a half in NSW (HO).&lt;ref name=nswshr-1698/&gt;

This is a '''list of active stock exchanges in the Americas'''.  [[Stock exchange]]s in [[Latin America]] (where [[Spanish language|Spanish]] and [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] prevail) use the term ''Bolsa de Valores'', meaning "bag" or "purse of "values." (compare [[börse (disambiguation)|börse]] in [[German language|German]] or [[bourse (disambiguation)|bourse]] in [[French language|French]]).

The [[Caribbean]] has one major [[regional stock exchange]]: the [[Eastern Caribbean Securities Exchange]] (ECSE), which serves [[Anguilla]], [[Antigua and Barbuda]], [[Dominica]], [[Grenada]], [[Montserrat]], [[Saint Kitts and Nevis]], [[Saint Lucia]], and [[Saint Vincent and the Grenadines]]. The service area of the ECSE corresponds to the service area of the [[Eastern Caribbean Central Bank]], with which it is associated.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1041">The '''Lodo Alfano''' (roughly "Alfano Law"), named after Berlusconi's Minister of Justice [[Angelino Alfano]], was an Italian law, valid between 2008 and 2009, granting immunity from prosecution to the four highest political offices in Italy (the [[President of Italy|President of the Republic]], the two Speakers of the Houses of Parliament and the [[Prime Minister of Italy|Prime Minister]]). It was widely criticized as a copy of the ''Lodo [[Renato Schifani|Schifani]]'', declared unconstitutional in 2004, as it actually aimed exclusively at stopping trials involving [[Silvio Berlusconi]]. 

The ''Lodo Alfano'' was declared unconstitutional by the [[Italian Constitutional Court]] in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.giurcost.org/decisioni/2009/0262s-09.html Sentenza n. 292/2009], ''Consulta Online (i.e. Italian Constitutional Court website)'', 7 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Makhad Trust''' is a UK [[Charitable organization|charity]] that works to sustain the environment and the natural heritage of peoples living in the [[nomadic]] regions of the world. The organisation gained charitable status in 2003 (registered no. 100377).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.charity-commission.gov.uk/registeredcharities/search.asp?words=makhad+trust&amp;searchby=name&amp;keytype=N&amp;limit=200&amp;position=2&amp;submit=+Run+Search+&amp;opArea=S&amp;Area_of_op= Charity Commission Central Register of Charities]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aims==
The word ‘makhad’ in [[Arabic]] means ‘meeting place’. The aim of the Makhad Trust is to provide a meeting place in nomadic regions of the world and to assist nomadic peoples who wish to restore their ancient connection to the land. Working with local entrepreneurs the Makhad Trust helps these peoples in organising projects which promote [[sustainable]] living and protect their traditional cultures.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.makhad.org/new/homepage.html Modified from a statement published on Makhad Trust's own website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090129161315/http://makhad.org/new/homepage.html |date=2009-01-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==

===Sinai===
The Makhad Trust operates primarily in south [[Sinai]], in the region of [[Saint Catherine's Monastery]], but also in [[Tibet]] and the [[Arctic Circle]]. The work of the Trust includes the restoration of the ancient gardens of the [[Bedouin]] tribes in the mountains of South Sinai, and the building of small dams which collect the water for these gardens. It assists in the building and restoration of drinking wells in the Sinai [[desert]], plus the building of community schools, a medicinal herb school, a craft centre, a computer centre and a Bedouin museum. One of the most important ongoing projects is the restoration of Ain Khudra (‘green spring’), an ancient oasis and settlement dating back to before the Biblical [[The Exodus|Exodus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/travel/destinations/africaandindianocean/egypt/746908/Egypt-a-feast-of-sand-and-stars.html | title=Egypt: a feast of sand and stars | publisher=The Telograph | date=3 Feb 2008 | accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.independent.co.uk/travel/africa/sinai-desert-nomadic-wonder-433777.html | title=Sinai Desert: Nomadic wonder | publisher=The Independent | date=27 January 2007 | accessdate=August 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tibet===
In Tibet projects include the restoration of Buddhist prayer walls in the Terton Chogar Gompa and the restoration of [[murals]] in the [[Lukhang]] Temple near Llasa.

===Funding===
This work is funded through charitable donations, through sponsorship of a specific project, by a series of working journeys in the Sinai mountains or [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]] journeys in the Sinai desert, and by grants from charitable trusts.

===Partners===
The Makhad Trust works in partnership with the [[Eden Project]], Jebeliya NGO (Egypt), the Centre for Himalayan Studies, The Buddhist Association, Lhasa (Tibet), the Waldorf College Project, Ruskin Mill Education Trust, [[SEKEM]] (Egypt) and the Isbourne Foundation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3633">The '''margraviate''' or '''marquisate of Bodonitsa''' (also '''Vodonitsa''' or '''Boudonitza'''; {{lang-el|Μαρκιωνία/Μαρκιζᾶτον τῆς Βοδονίτσας}}), today [[Mendenitsa]], [[Phthiotis]] (180&amp;nbsp;km northwest of [[Athens]]), was a [[Franks|Frankish]] state in [[Greece]] following the conquests of the [[Fourth Crusade]]. It was originally granted as a margravial holding of [[Guy Pallavicini]] by [[Boniface of Thessalonica|Boniface]], first [[king of Thessalonica]], in 1204. Its original purpose was to guard the pass of [[Thermopylae]].

The marquisate survived the fall of Thessalonica after the death of Boniface, but it was made subservient to the [[Principality of Achaea]] in 1248. The marquisate further survived the coming of the [[Catalan Company]] in 1311, but it fell to two [[Republic of Venice|Venetian]] families in quick succession: [[Cornaro]] (till 1335) and the [[Zorzi]]. Among the eighteen Catalan vassals of the area in 1380-1 the Margrave of Bodonitsa ranks third below Count [[Demitre]] and the [[Count of Salona]].&lt;ref name="Setton1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Setton|first=Kenneth Meyer|title=Athens in the Middle Ages|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U0toAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=14 October 2012|year=1975|publisher=Variorum Reprints|isbn=9780902089846|page=246}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Zorzi ruled the marquisate until the [[Ottoman Turks]] conquered it in 1414. [[Nicholas II Zorzi|Nicholas II]] continued to use the margravial title after that date, but the territory was never recovered.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1964">[[San Marino]] is a small sovereign state located within the territory of [[Italy]]. It has a musical heritage which includes the 17th-century composer [[Francesco Maria Marini di Pesaro]] and the 20th-century composer Cesare Franchini Tassini (1925–2010).

Since 1894, a wordless composition by [[Federico Consolo]] has been the [[national anthem]] of San Marino. The piece is based on a 10th-century [[choir|choral]] composition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://david.national-anthems.net/sm.htm National Anthems Reference Page]&lt;/ref&gt; The previous anthem was by Aur. Muccioli and U. Balsimelli, and is similar to the Italian national anthem.&lt;ref&gt;[http://david.national-anthems.net/sm-94.htm National Anthems Reference Page]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peregu Mare''' ({{lang-hu|Németpereg}}; {{lang-sk|Veľký Pereg}}) is a [[Communes of Romania|commune]] in [[Arad County]], [[Romania]], on the [[Arad Plateau]], at the western border of Romania. The commune stretches over 3095 ha and is composed of two villages, Peregu Mare (situated at 38&amp;nbsp;km from Arad) and Peregu Mic (''Kispereg'').

==Population==
According to the 2011 census, the population of the commune counts 1,584 inhabitants, out of which 26.26% are Romanians, 46.14% Hungarians, 0.94% Roma, 3.47% Germans, 12.87% Slovaks, 1.19% Ukrainians, 9.09% Czechs. 47% are [[Reformed Church of Romania|Reformed]], 20.1% [[Romanian Church United with Rome, Greek-Catholic|Greek-Catholic]], 19.7% [[Romanian Orthodox]] and 11.4% [[Roman Catholic]]. This village has about 876 houses.

==History==
The first documentary record of Peregu Mare dates back to 1241.

Magister Rogerius (Italian monk from Benevento, Apulia) wrote:
„XXXII: De destructione Nove-uille et monasterii de Egres. Uersus Orodinum et Chandinum procedere inceperunt, in medio eorum, Noua-uilli dimissa, nomen cuius '''Pereg''' fuerat, in qua homines septuaginta uillarum fuerant congregati, et dimisso monasterio Egres Cisterciensis ordinis, in quod tanquam munitum castrum se milites et multe domine receperant. Nec Tartari loca illa aggredi uoluerunt, quousque circumcirca esset terra totaliter desolata. (...) Tartari uero retro post omnes stantes, ridebat de casu et ruina illorum, et retrocedentes a pugna suorum, dabant quamplurimos uoragini gladiorum, ita quod ipsis diebus et noctibus, pugnantibus per unam septimanam, et fossatis impletis ceperunt uillam.”
—Magister Rogerius, Carmen miserabile.

==Economy==
The economy of the commune is mainly agricultural, farming and livestock-breeding are well represented. 

==Tourism==
Due to the customs and traditions specific to the ethnic groups of this area Peregu Mare commune is a quite attractive place during the period of Christian festivals.

'''Plastic resin pellet pollution''' is a type of [[marine debris]] originating from plastic particles utilized in manufacturing large-scale plastics. These pre-production plastic pellets are created separately from the user plastics they are melted down to form, and pellet loss is incurred during both the manufacturing and transport stages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pelletwatch.org/en/what.html|title=What's resin pellet? :: International Pellet Watch|website=www.pelletwatch.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Commonly referred to as [[Microplastics|nurdles]], these plastics are released into the open environment, creating pollution in the oceans and on beaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-1-4614-3414-6_1|title=Reviews of Environmental Contamination and Toxicology|last=Hammer|first=Jort|last2=Kraak|first2=Michiel H.

==Description==
Plastic resin pellets are classified as primary source [[microplastics]], meaning that they were intentionally produced at the size ranging from 1–5&amp;nbsp;mm in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;GESAMP (2015). “Sources, fate and effects of microplastics in the marine environment: a global assessment” (Kershaw, P. J., ed.). (IMO/FAO/UNESCO-IOC/UNIDO/WMO/IAEA/UN/UNEP/UNDP Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection). Rep. Stud. GESAMP No. 90, 96 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately 60 billion pounds (27 million [[tonne]]s) of nurdles are manufactured annually in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://healthebay.org/currentissues/ppi/bills_AB258.asp|title=Heal the Bay - The Pacific Protection Initiative - AB 258: Nurdles|date=20 April 2008|publisher=|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420095307/http://healthebay.org/currentissues/ppi/bills_AB258.asp|archivedate=20 April 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; One pound of [[pelletizing|pelletized]] [[HDPE]] contains approximately 25,000 nurdles (approximately 20&amp;nbsp;[[milligram|mg]] per nurdle). They are typically under {{convert|5|mm|abbr=on}} in diameter.&lt;ref name="blog"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2006/11/whats_a_nurdle.html|title=What's a nurdle?|date=7 November 2006|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mCCdKBcf?url=http://weblog.greenpeace.org/oceandefenders/archive/2006/11/whats_a_nurdle.html|archivedate=2009-12-21|accessdate=2009-12-21|postscript=.|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Environmental impact==
[[File:Granulés plastiques industriels sur une plage de la côte Aquitaine.JPG|thumb|300px|Nurdles on a beach in southwest France, 2011.]]
Nurdles are a major contributor to [[marine debris]]. During a three-month study of [[Orange County, California|Orange County]] beaches researchers found them to be the most common beach contaminant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =  Moore | first = Charles | title = A comparison of neustonic plastic and zooplankton abundance in southern California's coastal waters and elsewhere in the North Pacific | work = Algalita Marine Research Foundation | year = 2002 | url = http://www.mindfully.org/Plastic/Ocean/Marine-Debris-Panel30oct02.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nurdles comprised roughly 98% of the beach debris collected in a 2001 Orange County study.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.opc.ca.gov/webmaster/ftp/pdf/agenda_items/20070208/0702COPC05_MarineDebris_Resolution.pdf "Adopted Marine Debris Resolution"]&lt;/ref&gt; Waterborne nurdles may either be a raw material of [[Plastics engineering|plastic production]], or from larger chunks of plastics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6218698.stm|title=Plastics 'poisoning world's seas'|last=Ayre|first=Maggie|date=7 December 2006|work=[[BBC Online]]|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; A major concentration of plastic may be the [[Great Pacific garbage patch]], a growing collection of [[marine debris]] known for its high concentrations of plastic litter.

Nurdles that escape from the plastic production process into waterways or oceans have become a significant source of ocean and beach [[plastic pollution#Ocean|plastic pollution]]. Plastic pellet pollution that has been monitored in studies is mainly found in the sediments and beach areas and is usually [[polyethylene]] or [[polypropylene]], the two main plastic polymers found in [[Microplastics|microplastic]] pollution.&lt;ref&gt;GESAMP (2015). “Sources, fate and effects of microplastics in the marine environment: a global assessment” (Kershaw, P. J., ed.). (IMO/FAO/UNESCO-IOC/UNIDO/WMO/IAEA/UN/UNEP/UNDP Joint Group of Experts on the Scientific Aspects of Marine Environmental Protection). Rep. Stud. GESAMP No. 90, 96 p.&lt;/ref&gt; Marine life is severely threatened by these small pieces of plastic; the creatures that make up the base of the marine [[Food web|food chain]], such as [[krill]], are prematurely dying by choking on nurdles.&lt;ref name="worldwithout"&gt;{{cite book|last=Weisman|first=Alan|title=The World Without Us|publisher=Thomas Dunne Books |date=July 10, 2007|chapter=9|isbn=978-0-312-34729-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Nurdles have frequently been found in the [[digestive tract]]s of various marine creatures, causing physiological damage by [[Leaching (chemistry)|leaching]] plasticizers such as [[Polyvinyl chloride#Phthalate plasticizers|phthalates]].  Nurdles can carry two types of micropollutants in the marine environment: native plastic additives and [[hydrophobic]] pollutants absorbed from seawater. For example, concentrations of [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCB]]s and [[Dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene|DDE]] on nurdles collected from Japanese coastal waters were found to be up to 1 million times higher than the levels detected in surrounding seawater.&lt;ref&gt;Mato Y: "Plastic resin pellets as a transport medium for toxic chemicals in the marine environment", "Environmental Science &amp; Technology" 35(2), pages 318–324, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Plastic microbeads used in [[Exfoliation (cosmetology)|cosmetic exfoliating]] products are also found in water.

==Incidents==
'''2018'''

USA - Pennsylvania - Semi-truck crash leading to release of nurdles into Pocono Creek, with a picture of the nurdles in Spring Run (The Morning Call, 9 April 2018).

'''2017'''

South Africa - Durban - Nurdle spill leading to extended cleanup efforts. An overview of the response can be found here (http://www.coastkzn.co.za/nurdles)

UK - "The Great Nurdle Hunt" occurring from June 2-5th, 2017 - across the United Kingdom drew attention to the issue of plastic pellet pollution. A program started by Fidra, a Scottish environmental charity, sourced information on nurdles from citizens across the region using shared photos to better understand the makeup of pollution across beaches in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nurdlehunt.org.uk/images/Leaflets/Results-140717.pdf|title=The Great European Nurdle Hunt|last=|first=|date=|website=Nurdle Free Oceans|access-date=2017-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nurdle hunts occurring earlier in 2017 determined that 73% of UK beaches had nurdle pollution.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/feb/17/tiny-plastic-pellets-found-on-73-of-uk-beaches|title=Tiny plastic pellets found on 73% of UK beaches|last=Association|first=Press|date=2017-02-17|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-11-30|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''2012'''

USA - San Francisco Bay Coastal Cleanup from multiple nurdle spills (https://baynature.org/article/tiny-plastics-have-become-big-problem-in-coastal-cleanup/)

In [[Hong Kong]], after being blown by [[Typhoon Vicente (2012)|Typhoon Vicente]] on 24 July 2012, some containers belonging to Chinese oil giant [[Sinopec]] which were carrying over 150 tonnes of plastic pellets were blown into the sea, washing up on southern Hong Kong coasts, such as [[Shek O]], [[Cheung Chau]], [[Ma Wan]] and [[Lamma Island]]. The spill disrupted marine life and is being credited with killing stocks of fish on fish farms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/aug/09/hong-kong-plastic-spill|title=Sinopec pledges help to clear Hong Kong plastic spill|date=9 August 2012|accessdate=2012-08-24|postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Current progress and solutions ==
The plastic industry has responded to the increased interest and concern for plastic pellet loss and pollution sources.

'''Radio Veritas Asia''' is the non-commercial Catholic shortwave station broadcasting to [[Asia]]. It is based in [[Quezon City]], [[Philippines]], and is owned by the '''Philippine Radio Educational and Information Center''', which previously owned [[DZRV|the original Radio Veritas]] from 1969 to 1991. Its Urdu Service started its broadcast on August 14, 1987 in [[Lahore]], [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fides.org/aree/news/newsdet.php?idnews=28274&amp;lan=eng Agenzia Fides 2011-02-05] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402201448/http://www.fides.org/aree/news/newsdet.php?idnews=28274&amp;lan=eng |date=2012-04-02 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its mission is to promote justice to the oppressed through programs with specific moral, religious and inspirational content, and to voice peace and harmony among the sects, races, and sexes through socio-cultural programs and to promote dialogue among different religions.

==History==
On December 1958, the delegates of the Southeast Asian Bishops' Conference unanimously resolved to establish a radio station to serve the countries of [[Southeast Asia]]. Eleven years after that, Radio Veritas was inaugurated, on April 11, 1969.

The [[Federation of Asian Bishops' Conference]] (FABC) was entrusted with the operations of RVA from its beginning in 1970. This was confirmed by FABC's governing body, the General Assembly, in 1974.

Since 1991 the annual magazine of the Radio Veritas Asia [[Urdu]] Service has been housed in the office building of the WAVE Studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCANEWS.com December 1, 2006| url=http://www.ucanews.com/2006/12/01/catholic-office-for-social-communications-celebrates-15th-anniversary/?key=Lahore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most programs for Radio Veritas Asia's Urdu service are also recorded at the WAVE studio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=UCANEWS.com August 29, 2007| url=http://www.ucanews.com/2007/08/29/decades-of-church-radio-service-draws-praise-from-muslim-listeners/?key=lahore/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Radio Veritas embarked on different means of delivering its religious message. It started using new technology such as the Internet and webcasting, and plans to upgrade to digital broadcasting.

Between 2007 and June 2011 it had received over 30,000 letters from listeners in Pakistan, over 3,500 from India and nearly 500 from other countries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rveritas-asia.org Radio Veritas Asia website]&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 9, 2011, more than 80 people from all over the country attended the 11th listeners’ conference of Radio Veritas Asia’s Urdu language service in Lahore. RVA’s Urdu service airs 13 morning and evening programs reaching listeners in Pakistan and India. In 2011 Father Nadeem John Shakir was the studio director.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ucanews.com/2011/10/10/muslims-welcome-church-message/ UCANews October 10, 2011]&lt;/ref&gt;

The 15th Conference of Catholic radio listeners was held on 21 September 2015 at Loyola Hall in Lahore. It was attended by 120 people from around the country. Bishop [[Joseph Arshad]] of Faisalabad and head of the Commission for Social Communications, addressed the conference invited the participants to build peace, tolerance and brotherhood in society via the radio.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.asianews.it/news-en/Muslim-teacher:-Thanks-to-Radio-Veritas-I-became-a-writer-35399.html AsiaNews 24 September 2015]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Funding==
The service is largely funded by the [[Germans|German]] donors Missio. Last year they announced a cut back of 10 per cent of their annual funding. The Center used to receive annual funding of 10,000 rupees from the [[Catholic Bishops' Conference of Pakistan]] but this stopped six years ago.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.ucanews.com/give-us-this-day/2011/05/24/short-wave-short-of-listeners/  UCANews 24 May 2011] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110526040935/http://blogs.ucanews.com/give-us-this-day/2011/05/24/short-wave-short-of-listeners/ |date=26 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==RVA Programs==
RVA programming evolves from its two-fold objectives.

===Evangelization===
It has a mix of moral, religious, evangelical and socio-cultural, and entertainment programs on offer, as well as a few political, economic and informational programs. Programs include:
*Gospel Reflection 
*Church News 
*Morals 
*Catholic Doctrines 
*[[Catechesis]]
*Liturgy and Sacraments 
*Dialogue with Religions and Cultures 
*Role of the Church in the Modern World

===Human development===
In 2015, it offers two 27 minute programs, one in the morning and one at night, dealing with health, culture, values, famous places in the world, personalities, social issues, literature, inventions and world news.

*People Empowerment {{clarify|date=March 2015}}
*Community Building  {{clarify|date=March 2015}}
*Family  {{clarify|date=March 2015}}
*Women and Youth  {{clarify|date=March 2015}}
*Science and Technology 
*Environment 
*History and Culture 
*News and Information 
*Health

==Through The Years==

===RVA and the Pope===
During the 25th anniversary celebration of RVA in 1995 [[Pope John Paul II]] said that RVA must be helped to fulfill its mission even though this will certainly involve even greater sacrifices and renewed commitment on the part of the local churches in [[Asia]].

===The library===
The broadcast tapes of the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] are housed in the RVA archives. [[UNESCO]] has catalogued the audio files as part of the selected collection included in the ''Memory of the World Program and [[Digital Preservation]] of Documentary Heritage''.

'''Sabayad''', also known as '''Kimis''', is a type of [[flatbread]] eaten in [[Somalia]] and [[Djibouti]]. It is closely related to the [[paratha]] of the [[Indian subcontinent]].

==History==
A very commonly served bread in [[Somali cuisine]], sabayad is usually eaten during [[breakfast]] or [[dinner]]. It is made from a dough of plain [[flour]], [[water]] and [[salt]]. Like the paratha, it is rolled into rough squares or circles and then briefly fried in a [[Frying pan|pan]]. However, the sabayad is mainly prepared in the traditional Somali way.{{Clarify|reason=|date=July 2018}}

The classic sounds of the traditional instruments evoke not only the past but also the bustling, urban energy of Bandung today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/sambasunda_30105/en_US National Geographic]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110528172943/http://worldmusic.nationalgeographic.com/view/page.basic/artist/content.artist/sambasunda_30105/en_US |date=May 28, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recorded in that city's Jugala studios, Berekis Album brings a full sound palette from the deep resonance of the mighty gongs to the silvery eloquence of the bamboo flute.

SambaSunda are led by composer and multi-instrumentalist Ismet Ruchimat, who started his career in 1989 in [[Gugum Gumbira]]'s famous Jugala Orchestra and has appeared on a number of international recording projects: with Spanish percussionist Vidal Paz ("Sunda-Africa", Globestyle); Indian flautist, Hariprasad Chaurasia ("Moon Magic", BMG India); the Madagascan group, Tarika ("Soul Makassar", Sakay); and on the Kartini label with Sabah Habas Mustapha &amp; the Jugala Allstars ("Jalan Kopo" and "So La Li").&lt;ref&gt;[http://womad.org/artists/sambasunda/ Womad] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120716091128/http://womad.org/artists/sambasunda/ |date=2012-07-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Planisphere of Domingos Teixeira''' was made by this Portuguese cartographer in 1573, during the reign of [[Sebastian of Portugal]].

It is made and painted by hand on a piece of [[parchment]] and conserved in the [[Bibliothèque nationale de France]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b5901212v.r=Domingos+Teixeira.langFR  BnF : Planisphère de Domingos Teixeira 1573]&lt;/ref&gt;
== Datasheet==
* Date: 1573
* Author: Domingos Teixeira (Portugal).
* Cartographic School: Portuguese.
* Brief description: World Map.
* Physical Location: Bibliothèque nationale de France

== Description ==
It is one of the first full world maps showing the spice routes, both the [[Portuguese discovery of the sea route to India|Portuguese route]] of [[Vasco da Gama]], following the east route and the Spanish route towards the west, discovered by [[Ferdinand Magellan]] (shows the [[Terra Magellanica]] not yet circumnavigated by [[Diego Ramirez de Arellano]] that christened it [[Isla de Xativa]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cch.cat/pdf/el_mercantil_valenciano_140607.pdf Tierra de Fuego, antes «Isla de Xativa»]&lt;/ref&gt;

You can see the scope of the [[Treaty of Tordesillas | Tordesillas]] Meridian, both on the side of America ([[Brazil]]) and at the opposite side of the world at the [[Philippines]], that according to the [[treaty of Zaragoza]] should belong to [[Kingdom of Portugal|Portugal]], as they are in the "Portuguese" hemisphere.
&lt;!--
The '''Cantino planisphere''' or '''world map''' is the earliest surviving map showing [[History of Portugal (1419-1499)|Portuguese geographic discoveries]] in the east and west. It is named after '''Alberto Cantino''', an agent for the [[Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara|Duke of Ferrara]], who successfully smuggled it from [[Portugal]] to [[Italy]] in 1502. The map is particularly notable for portraying a fragmentary record of the [[Brazil]]ian coast, discovered in 1500 by the Portuguese explorer [[Pedro Álvares Cabral]], and for depicting the African coast of the Atlantic and Indian Oceans with a remarkable accuracy and detail. It was valuable at the beginning of the sixteenth century because it showed detailed and up-to-date strategic information in a time when geographic knowledge of the world was growing at a fast pace. It is important in our days because it contains unique historical information about the maritime exploration and the evolution of nautical cartography in a particularly interesting period. The Cantino planisphere is the earliest extant nautical chart where places (in Africa and parts of Brazil and India) are depicted according to their astronomically observed latitudes.

==History==
[[File:Cantino west.jpg|thumb|180px|left|West and the recently reached Americas, [[Treaty of Tordesillas|Tordesillas]] line depicted - Cantino planisphere detail]]
[[File:Compass rose Cantino.jpg|thumb|180px|Major wind rose of the Cantino planisphere]]
In the beginning of the 16th century, [[Lisbon]] was a buzzing metropolis where people from diverse backgrounds came in search of work, glory or fortune. There were also many undercover agents looking for the secrets brought by the Portuguese voyages to remote lands. Among them was Alberto Cantino, who was sent to Portugal by the Ercole I d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, with the formal intention of [[horse trading]], while secretly collecting information on the [[History of Portugal (1419-1499)|Portuguese Discoveries]]. Cantino’s diligence is shown in two of his letters to the Duke, dated from 17th and 18 October 1501, where he describes, amongst other things, hearing [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] detailing his latest voyage to Newfoundland (Terra Nova) to King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].

A popular theory, introduced in the earliest studies of the map,&lt;ref&gt;Duarte Leite (1923), 225-32&lt;/ref&gt; suggests that the Cantino Planisphere was ordered to an official Portuguese mapmaker, who made a copy of the royal cartographic pattern, the so-called ''Padrão Real'', kept in the ''Armazéns da Índia''. However, there is no historical evidence that such order was ever made and the theory is weakened by the presence of numerous mistakes. One would expect a carefully made copy of an official standard, if it existed in Portugal at that time, would be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Gaspar (2012), 181-82&lt;/ref&gt; A more plausible explanation is that the map was surreptitiously acquired shortly after it was made for some nobleman or official client.&lt;ref&gt;Gaspar (2010), 182; 195&lt;/ref&gt; From a letter sent by Cantino to its patron, the Duke of Ferrara, on the 19th of November 1502, we know that he paid 12 golden [[ducat]]s for it, which was a considerable amount for the time. An Italian inscription in the back of the map reads: ''Carta de navigar per le Isole nouam trovate in le parte de India: dono Alberto Cantino al S. Duca Hercole'', which translates as 'Navigational chart of the islands recently [discovered]... in part of the Indies: from Alberto Cantino to Duke Hercole'.

While it enlightened the Italians to many new territories yet unknown to them, it was obsolete within months due to subsequent mapping voyages by the Portuguese. Nevertheless, its importance to the Portuguese–Italian trade relations should not be understated; this map provided the Italians with knowledge of Brazil's coastline and that of much of the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] Coast of [[South America]] long before other nations even knew South America extended so far to the south. It also supplied great details of the [[Indian Ocean]]. It also maps the east coast of North America, at least from Florida to New York, and includes descriptive place names such as Rio de las Almadias (River of Rafts), which describes the unique vegetation rafts in the [[St. Johns River]] in Florida.{{fact|date=January 2015}}  Others argue that this peninsula was actually intended to represent part of [[China]], [[Cuba]], or the [[Yucatan Peninsula]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://journals.fcla.edu/flgeog/article/view/77942/75378 | title=THE FIRST EUROPEAN CHARTING OF FLORIDA AND THE ADJACENT SHORES | author=Peck, Douglas T. | journal=The Florida Geographer | year=2003 | volume=34 | pages=82-113}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The geographical information given on the Cantino map was copied into the Italian-made [[Caverio map|Canerio (or Caveri) map]] shortly after the Cantino map arrived in Italy and the Canerio, in turn, became the primary source for the design of the newly discovered western lands on the highly influential wall map of the world produced by [[Martin Waldseemüller]] in 1507 under the auspices of Rene, Duke of Lorraine.

This old map, made-up by 6 glued [[parchment]] sheets, was kept in the Ducal Library, [[Ferrara]], for about 90 years, until [[Pope Clement VIII]] transferred it to another palace in [[Modena]], Italy. More than two centuries later, in 1859, the palace was ransacked and the Cantino Map lost. It was found by Giuseppe Boni, Director of the Biblioteca Estense, in that same year, in a butcher’s store in Modena. The Cantino world map can currently be found in [[Modena]], Italy, at the [[Biblioteca Estense]].

== Construction ==
[[File:Cantino rhumb line system.JPG|thumb|300px|The rhumb-line construction scheme and geographic lines in the Cantino planisphere. Adapted from Gaspar (2012), Plate 3]]
The Cantino planisphere is the earliest extant example of the so-called ''latitude chart'', which was developed following the introduction of astronomical navigation, during the second half of the fifteenth century. Contrarily to the portolan charts of the Mediterranean, which were constructed on the basis of magnetic courses and estimated distances between places, in the latitude chart places were represented according to their latitudes. In the Cantino planisphere, latitudes were incorporated only in the coasts of Africa, Brazil and India, while Europe and the Caribbean Sea continued to be represented according to the portolan-chart model &lt;ref&gt;Gaspar (2012), 129-82&lt;/ref&gt;).

The construction of the [[rhumb lines|rhumb line]] system in the Cantino planisphere uses two circles (some charts use only one, others use as many as three, depending of size): the western circle is centered on the [[Cape Verde|Cape Vert]] Islands, the eastern circle is centered in India. The circumference of each circle is marked with sixteen equally spaced points, from which radiate the 32 classic rhumbs: 0°, 11 1/4°, 22 1/2°, 33 3/4°, etc. The western and eastern outer circles are tangent to each other at a large wind-rose in central Africa, with a [[fleur-de-lis]] indicating North. This dense rhumb-line mesh was used in navigation as a reference, for reading and marking directions (courses) between places. Six scale bars graduated in Iberian leagues, with a variable number of sections (or ''logs''), are distributed over the chart's area. These were used to measure distances between places.

Illustrations are few, but elaborate. Two cities are grandly depicted - [[Venice]] and [[Jerusalem]]. There is also an elaborate depiction of the Portuguese castle of São Jorge da Mina ([[Elmina Castle]], on the [[Portuguese Gold Coast|Gold Coast]] of [[west Africa]]), flanked by two African towns. Other illustrations include a lion-shaped mountain representing the [[Sierra Leone]] mountain range, the [[Pharos of Alexandria|Alexandria lighthouse]] (laid horizontal), the mythical [[Mountains of the Moon (Africa)|Mountains of the Moon]] (legendary source of the [[Nile River]]) in central Africa, and either the [[Table Mountain]] or [[Drakensberg]] range in South Africa. Along the central African coast are the various cross stone markers (''[[Padrão|padrões]]'') erected by [[Diogo Cão]] and [[Bartolomeu Dias]] in the 1480s.

In north Africa, there is the "Montes Claros" in the usual place of the [[Atlas mountains]], the legend below on the left reading that "this is the land of King Organo, whose king is very noble and very rich", and to the right that this is the "land of the King of Nubia, the king of which is continuously making war on [[Prester John]] and is a moor and a great enemy of Christians".

== Discoveries ==
The Brazilian coast was certainly the last to be added and reached its present form in three phases: to the first belong an initial coastline running to southeast from ''Golfo fremosso'' to ''Cabo Sam Jorge'', and from there, to north of ''Porto Seguro'', continuing further south to the tip of the landmass. Only a relatively small portion of the coast, between the flag near the ''Vera cruz'' inscription and the northern side of the ''baia de todos os santos'' would have been surveyed, in 1500, by the fleet of Pedro Álvares Cabral. To the second phase belongs the pasting of the strip of parchment between ''Rio de sã franc°'' and ''Golfo fremosso'', which would have been based on the information brought by the fleet of João da Nova, who arrived in Lisbon in September 1502. In the third phase the island named ''quaresma'', together with some names written in cursive would have been added .&lt;ref&gt;Roukema (1963), p. 7-8&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greenland]] is supposed to have been re-discovered by João Fernandes Labrador and Pedro de Barcelos between 1495 and 1498, and also visited by [[Giovanni Caboto]] (John Cabot), in the English expedition of 1498. But the depiction of the island on the map suggests it was based on the Portuguese mission of Labrador and Barcelos. [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] was probably visited by an English expedition in 1497-98, and again, by the Portuguese explorer [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] in 1500 and 1501. The map makes clear that the land was discovered and charted for Portugal by [[Gaspar Corte-Real]], for King [[Manuel I of Portugal]].

== North American section ==
[[File:Cantino Map - North America.jpg|thumb|200px|Top left corner section of 1502 Cantino map, which shows US East Coast, Cuba, Hispaniola, and other Caribbean Islands]]
[[File:Cantino Map - 1502 - Florida.jpg|thumb|200px|A depiction of what might be Florida from the 1502 Cantino map]]
The North American section of the Cantino map is historically very important. It represents one of the very first mappings of America's East Coast, and includes descriptive place names. It may map both coasts of [[Florida]], and 11 years before [[Juan Ponce de León|Ponce de León]] got credit for discovering Florida in 1513. Other suggestions include the possibility it reflects the belief that Columbus reached Asia and it is meant to show the mainland of Asia or that it represents [[Yucatán Peninsula|Yucatán]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Allen|first=John Logan|title=A New World Disclosed|year=1997|publisher=University of Nebraska Press|isbn=978-0803210158|page=198}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Newfoundland]], which was visited in 1500 and 1501 by [[Gaspar Corte-Real]] and his brother Miguel, members of the Portuguese royal household, is labeled as ''Terra del Rey de Portuguall'' on the Cantino map. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.loc.gov/rr/hispanic/portam/coast.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Water access and gender''' are intricately linked in many parts of the world today and also historically. Discrimination in access to water occurs along many lines, including [[gender]]. Women and girls are more likely to be expected to collect and provide water for their families in less developed countries. Men and women are affected differently by water crisis situations. The study of how water access and gender are related is part of [[Feminist political ecology]] (FPE). Dealing with inequalities of water access falls under [[international human rights law]].

[[File:DRAWING_WATER_TO_QUENCH_THURST.jpg|alt=Woman collecting water in Kenya.|thumb|Woman collecting water in Kenya.]]
Around the world there are patterns of [[discrimination]] in relation to water access.{{sfn|Winkler|Satterthwaite|De Albuquerque|2014|p=557}} Around 1.1 billion people in the world do not have access to adequate water supplies.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moser|first=Anne|date=2009-01-01|title=Women and Water: Marginalization, Hope and a Call to Action|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-200881508.html|journal=Feminist Collections: A Quarterly of Women's Studies Resources|volume=|pages=|subscription=yes|via=HighBeam Research}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many places of the world, getting and providing water is considered "women's work," so [[gender]] and water access are intricately linked.{{sfn|Keefer|Bousalis|2015|p=256}} Also, because collecting water is often unpaid labor, women are more likely to be assigned to water collection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Strochlic|first=Nina|date=April 2017|title=Water Collective|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=121884321&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=National Geographic|volume=231|issue=4|pages=24|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Water gathering and supply to family units remains primarily a woman’s task in [[less developed countries]] where water gathering is considered a main chore.{{sfn|Keefer|Bousalis|2015|p=256}} This water work is also largely unpaid household work based on patriarchal gender norms and often related to domestic work, such as laundry, cooking and childcare.&lt;ref name="Bennet et al 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bennet|first1=Vivienne|last2=Davila-Poblete|first2=Sonia|last3=Rico|first3=Maria N.|date=2008|title=Water and gender: the unexpected connection that really matters.|journal=Journal of International Affairs|volume=61|issue=2|pages=107-126}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Koolwal|Van de Walle|2010|p=5}} Areas that rely on women to primarily collect water include countries in [[Africa]], [[South Asia]] and in the [[Middle East]].{{sfn|Koolwal|Van de Walle|2010|p=4}}

Many women in less developed countries must walk long distances to collect water.{{sfn|Keefer|Bousalis|2015|p=261}} Girls who must spend hours a day collecting water from natural sources often miss school.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Many walk miles to get to the water source and must wait in line for their turn to collect water.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Some women in Africa may spend eight hours a day both collecting and then treating the water.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=McManus|first=Reed|date=November 2014|title=One Woman at a Time|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=hxh&amp;AN=102926262&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Sierra|volume=99|issue=6|pages=44|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt; In areas of [[Nairobi]], women carry 44 pound containers of water back to their homes, taking anywhere between an hour and several hours to wait and collect the water.{{sfn|Crow|Odaba|2010|p=733}} Some of these women are unable to open their businesses because of the wait for collecting water.{{sfn|Crow|Odaba|2010|p=745}}

Women and girls who collect water may also face [[sexual assault]] along the way.{{sfn|Winkler|Satterthwaite|De Albuquerque|2014|p=557}}

In places like [[Nepal]], not only are women and girls affected by water collection by it being their "job," but there are also restrictions for collecting water based on [[caste]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; [[India]] also has a great deal of social stratification that not only affect water gathering, but also effect policies relating to government-managed water services.{{sfn|Deininger|Nag|Nagarajan|2011|p=343}} When women are represented in the government, local women are more likely to participate in public meetings relating to water delivery.{{sfn|Deininger|Nag|Nagarajan|2011|p=347}} In rural Bangladesh, women living in poverty are less likely to have a political voice regarding water access.{{sfn|Sultana|2007|p=498}} When inequalities to water access aren't properly addressed, governments end up providing a low level of service to their people.{{sfn|Winkler|Satterthwaite|De Albuquerque|2014|p=558}}

In addition, [[Water scarcity|Water crises]] affect men and women differently in some areas, such as in rural [[Bangladesh]].{{sfn|Sultana|2007|p=494}} 

== Men and water access ==
Beginning in the 19th century, water management, access, and technology was considered a masculine domain.&lt;ref name="Bennet et al 2008" /&gt;

Gender norms can negatively affect how men and women access water through such behavior expectations along gender lines--for example, when water collection is a woman’s chore, men who collect water may face [[discrimination]] for performing perceived women’s work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=CAP-NET|last2=GWA|date=2006|title=Why Gender Matters: a tutorial for water managers|location=Delft|publisher=CAP-NET International network for Capacity Building in Integrated Water Resources Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men rarely collect water in rural [[Bangladesh]] due to local ideas of [[masculinity]].{{sfn|Sultana|2007|p=496}} On the other hand, the same norms often result in women being pressured to collect and use water in an efficient and timely manner, without the advantages of modern technology.&lt;ref name="Krish 2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Krishnaraj|first1=Maithreyi|date=2011|title=Women and water: Issues of gender, caste, class and institutions|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=46|issue=18|pages=37-39}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study conducted in the [[Volta Region]] of [[Ghana]] found that men collected water only when their wives were not available.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Arku|first=Frank S.|date=July 2010|title=Time savings from easy access to clean water: Implications for rural men's and women's well-being|url=http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bth&amp;AN=51431946&amp;site=ehost-live|journal=Progress In Development Studies|volume=10|pages=238|subscription=yes|via=EBSCOhost}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Boys and girls are able to more fully participate in school when there is improved access to water.{{sfn|Koolwal|Van de Walle|2010|p=24}}

== Addressing inequalities in access ==
[[Feminist political ecology|Feminist political ecology (FPE)]] seeks to question and inform understanding regarding how gender, and other social labels and classifiers, influence how people relate to and interact with the natural environment, including how people have access to water.&lt;ref name="Oberhauser et al 2017 general"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DHE3DwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=feminist%20spaces%20gender%20and%20geography%20in%20a%20global&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q=feminist%20spaces%20gender%20and%20geography%20in%20a%20global&amp;f=false|title=Feminist Spaces: Gender and Geography in a Global Context|last1=Oberhauser|first1=Ann M.|last2=Fluri|first2=Jennifer L.|last3=Whitson|first3=Risa|last4=Mollett|first4=Sharlene|date=2017|publisher=Taylor and Francis|year=|isbn=|location=Florence|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ivens 2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ivens|first1=Saskia|date=2008|title=Does increased water access empower women?|journal=Development|volume=51|pages=63-67}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender becomes integrated into these environmentally-focused and development-oriented policies, projects, and programs through [[gender mainstreaming]], which further encourages the convergence of [[Feminism|women’s issues]] and [[gender equality]] with [[natural resource]] protection and development projects.&lt;ref name="Dankelman 2010"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender and Climate Change: An Introduction|last1=Dankelman|first1=Irene|date=2010|publisher=Taylor and Francis|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing inequalities in access to water is also considered a [[human rights]] issue in legal terms and in [[International human rights law|international human rights laws]].{{sfn|Winkler|Satterthwaite|De Albuquerque|2014|p=563}}{{sfn|Winkler|Satterthwaite|De Albuquerque|2014|p=567}} Equality in water access also means that governments and [[Non-governmental organization|non-governmental organizations]] need to focus on the most disadvantaged and poorest members of the community.{{sfn|Winkler|Satterthwaite|De Albuquerque|2014|p=565}} The [[United Nations]] adopted a resolution in 2010 on the "[[Human right to water and sanitation|Human Right to Water and Sanitation]]."{{sfn|Winkler|Satterthwaite|De Albuquerque|2014|p=566}}
