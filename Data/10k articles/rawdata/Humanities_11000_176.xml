      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5655">'''‘Aql''' ({{lang-ar|عقل}}, meaning "intellect"), is an [[Arabic language]] term used in [[Islamic philosophy]] or [[Schools of Islamic theology|theology]] for the [[intellect]] or the [[reason|rational]] [[Faculties of the soul|faculty of the soul]] or mind. It is the normal translation of the Greek term ''[[nous]]''. In [[Islamic jurisprudence|jurisprudence]], it is associated with using reason as a source for ''[[sharia]]'' "religious law" and has been translated as "dialectical reasoning".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Esposito | first =John | author-link =John Esposito  | year =2004 | title =The Oxford Dictionary of Islam | series =Oxford paperback reference | publication-place =Oxford, UK | publisher =Oxford University Press | page =22 | isbn =0-19-512559-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DivineGuide"&gt;{{Citation | last =Moezzi | first =Mohammad Ali Amir | year =1994 | title =The Divine Guide in Early Shiʻism: The Sources of Esotericism in Islam | publication-place =Albany | publisher =State University of New York Press | page =6 | isbn =0-7914-2121-X }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alkafi"&gt;{{Citation |title = Kitab al-Kafi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Alamut"&gt;{{Citation |first=Anthony |last=Campbell |title = The Assassins of Alamut| year = 2004 |pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
In Islam, the term ‘aql was heavily elucidated by early Shī‘ah thinkers; it came to replace and expand the pre-Islamic concept of ''ḥilm'' ({{lang-ar|حلم}}) "serene justice and self-control, dignity" in opposition to the negative notions of ignorance (''jahl'') and stupidity (''safah'').&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt;

The "possessor of ‘aql", or ''al-‘āqīl'' (plural ''al-‘uqqāl'') realises a deep connection with God. [[Ja'far al-Sadiq|Jaʿfar aṣ-Ṣādiq]] (d. 765, notably an [[Imamah (Shi'a doctrine)|Imām]]) described this connection as a realisation that God loves some, that God is truth and that only ''[[ilm (Arabic)|‘ilm]]'' "sacred knowledge" and its development can help humanity fulfil its potential.

His son, Imām [[Musa al-Kadhim|Mūsà al-Kāżim]] (d. 799), expanded this exegesis by defining ‘aql as the "faculty for apprehending the divine, a faculty of metaphysical perception, a light in the heart, through which one can discern and recognize signs from God."&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt; He further noted that where the A'immah (Imāms) are the ''ḥujjatu ż-żāhira'' "External proof [of God]", ‘aql is the ''ḥujjatu l-Bāṭina'' "Secret proof".&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt;

While in early Islam, ‘aql was opposed to ''jahl'' "ignorance", the expansion of the concept meant it was now opposed to ''safah'' "[deliberate] stupidity" and ''junūn'' "lack of sense, indulgence". Under the influence of [[Mu'tazili|Mu‘tazilī]] thought, ‘aql came to mean "dialectical reasoning".&lt;ref name="DivineGuide" /&gt;

== Shī‘ī Legal Implementation ==
In Shī‘ī jurisprudence, ‘aql is the process of using intellect or logic to deduce law. Legal scholars in both Sunni and Shī‘ī Islamic traditions share Quranic interpretation, the ''[[Sunnah]]'', and ''Ijma‘'' "consensus" as sources of Islamic law and judicial decisions (''ḥukm''). However, [[Twelver]]s of the Ja‘farī [[madh'hab|school of law]] utilize ‘aql whereas Sunnis use ''[[qiyas]]'' "analogical reasoning" as the fourth source of law.

Among Twelvers, [[Akhbari|Akhbārīs]] (associated with exotericism and traditionalism and theological schools in [[Qom]]) and [[Usuli]]s (associated with esotericism and rationalism and theological schools in [[Baghdad]]) were contending subschools: the former reject ''[[ijtihad|ijtihād]]'' outright; the latter advocate ''ijtihad'' and have been predominant for the last 300 years.&lt;ref name="DivineGuide"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last =Masud | first =Muhammad Khalid | last2 =Messick | first2 =Binkley Morris | first3 =Powers | last3 =David Stephan | year =1996 | title =Islamic Legal Interpretation: Muftis and Their Fatwas  | series =Harvard studies in Islamic law | publication-place =Cambridge, MA | publisher =Harvard University Press | page =14 | isbn =0-674-46870-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shī‘ī Islam, "the gates of ''ijtihād''" were never closed and with the use of ‘aql, Shī‘ī ''mujtahid''s "practitioner of ''ijtihād''" and ''faqīh''s "legal specialists" are able to respond as issues arise that were not explicitly dealt with in the Qur'an or Sunnah.{{Islamic theology}}

An '''art movement''' is a tendency or style in art with a specific common philosophy or goal, followed by a group of artists during a restricted period of time, (usually a few months, years or decades) or, at least, with the heyday of the movement defined within a number of years. Art movements were especially important in [[modern art]], when each consecutive movement was considered as a new [[avant-garde]].

== Concept ==
According to theories associated with [[modernism]] and the concept of [[Postmodern art|postmodernism]], art movements are especially important during the period of time corresponding to [[modern art]].&lt;ref&gt;''Man of his words: Pepe Karmel on Kirk Varnedoe&amp;nbsp;— Passages'' – Critical Essay [[Artforum]],  Nov, 2003  by Pepe Karmel&lt;/ref&gt; The period of time called "modern art" is posited to have changed approximately halfway through the 20th century and art made afterward is generally called [[contemporary art]]. [[Postmodern art|Postmodernism]] in visual art begins and functions as a parallel to [[late modernism]]&lt;ref&gt;The Originality of the Avant Garde and Other Modernist Myths [[Rosalind E. Krauss]], Publisher: The MIT Press; Reprint edition (July 9, 1986), ''Part I, ''Modernist Myths'', pp.8–171&lt;/ref&gt; and refers to that period after the "modern" period called contemporary art.&lt;ref name="Deconstructionists, 2006, pp218-221"&gt;''The Citadel of Modernism Falls to Deconstructionists'', – 1992 critical essay, ''The Triumph of Modernism'', 2006, [[Hilton Kramer]], pp 218–221.&lt;/ref&gt; The postmodern period began during [[late modernism]] (which is a contemporary continuation of modernism), and according to some theorists postmodernism ended in the 21st century.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Post-Modernism: The New Classicism in Art and Architecture'' [[Charles Jencks]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="William R. Everdell 1997, p4"&gt;William R. Everdell, [[The First Moderns|''The First Moderns: Profiles in the Origins of Twentieth-century Thought'']], University of Chicago Press, 1997, p4. {{ISBN|0-226-22480-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of time corresponding to "modern art" each consecutive movement was often considered a new [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Also during the period of time referred to as "modern art" each movement was seen corresponding to a somewhat grandiose rethinking of all that came before it, concerning the visual arts. Generally there was a commonality of visual style linking the works and artists included in an art movement. Verbal expression and explanation of movements has come from the artists themselves, sometimes in the form of an [[art manifesto]],&lt;ref name=introduction&gt;[http://www.pupress.princeton.edu/chapters/i8066.html "Poetry of the Revolution. Marx, Manifestos, and the Avant-Gardes" introduction, Martin Puchner] Retrieved April 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://humanities.sas.upenn.edu/05-06/mellon_postdoc.shtml "Looking at Artists' Manifestos, 1945–1965", Stephen B. Petersen] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927185416/http://humanities.sas.upenn.edu/05-06/mellon_postdoc.shtml |date=September 27, 2011 }} Retrieved April 4, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes from [[art critic]]s and others who may explain their understanding of the meaning of the new art then being produced.

In the [[visual arts]], many artists, theorists, art critics, art collectors, art dealers and others mindful of the unbroken continuation of modernism and the continuation of modern art even into the contemporary era, ascribe to and welcome new philosophies of art as they appear.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], seventh paragraph of the essay. URL accessed on June 15, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sharecom.ca/greenberg/postmodernism.html Clement Greenberg: Modernism and Postmodernism], William Dobell Memorial Lecture, Sydney, Australia, Oct 31, 1979, Arts 54, No.6 (February 1980). His final essay on modernism Retrieved October 26, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Postmodern art|Postmodernist]] theorists posit that the idea of art movements are no longer as applicable, or no longer as discernible, as the notion of art movements had been before the postmodern era.&lt;ref&gt;''Ideas About Art'' by Desmond, Kathleen K. [https://books.google.com/books?id=iP4sA3kwcFsC&amp;dq=ideas+about+art&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2011, p.148&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''International postmodernism: theory and literary practice'', Bertens, Hans [https://books.google.com/books?id=n_Eqx2Gr1vUC&amp;dq=international+postmodernism:+theory+and+literary+practice&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s], Routledge, 1997, p.236&lt;/ref&gt; There are many theorists however who doubt as to whether or not such an era was actually a fact;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; or just a passing fad.&lt;ref name="William R. Everdell 1997, p4"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophynow.org/issue58/The_Death_of_Postmodernism_And_Beyond Alan Kirby, ''The Death of Postmodernism and Beyond'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The term refers to tendencies in [[visual art]], novel ideas and [[architecture]], and sometimes [[literature]]. In [[music]] it is more common to speak about [[genre]]s and [[fashion|styles]] instead. See also [[cultural movement]], a term with a broader connotation.

As the names of many art movements use the -ism suffix (for example [[cubism]] and [[futurism (art)|futurism]]), they are sometimes referred to as ''isms''.

The '''[[Bratislava]] Declaration''' was the result of the conference held on 3 August 1968 for the representatives of the Communist parties and Worker's parties of [[People's Republic of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], [[Hungarian People's Republic|Hungary]], [[East Germany]], [[Polish People's Republic|Poland]], the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics|USSR]], and [[Czechoslovakia]].&lt;ref name="bratislava declaration august 3rd"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://library.thinkquest.org/C001155/documents/doc41.htm|accessdate=4 April 2014|title=The Bratislava Declaration, August 3, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt; The declaration was a response to the [[Prague Spring]]. It affirmed unshakable fidelity to Marxism–Leninism and proletarian internationalism, and declared an implacable struggle against "bourgeois" ideology and all "anti-socialist" forces. The Soviet Union also expressed its intention to intervene in any [[Warsaw Pact]] country if a "bourgeois" system – a pluralist system of several political parties – was ever established.&lt;ref name="ussr czechoslovakia intervention"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.onwar.com/aced/data/cite/czechoslovak1968.htm|accessdate=12 October 2014|title=USSR Czechoslovakia Intervention 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Bratislava Declaration and Roadmap]] is an unrelated document that was the outcome of an informal meeting of the 27 heads of state or government on September 16, 2016, chaired by [[Donald Tusk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/press-releases/2016/09/16-bratislava-declaration-and-roadmap/ "...devoted to diagnose together the present state of the European Union and discuss our common future..."]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Collezione Farnesina Experimenta''' is a bilingual book ([[Italian language|Italian]] and [[English language|English]]) that assembles and catalogues the eighty works (reproduced in colour) of the [[Farnesina Experimenta Art Collection]], housed in [[Palazzo della Farnesina]].

Along with exhibitions of the collection that are promoted by the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Italy)|Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], the aim of the volume is to valorize and make known contemporary Italian art, by supporting those generations of artists who made names for themselves from the nineties to the year 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Collezione Farnesina - Experimenta Ministero degli Affari Esteri Roma|url = http://1995-2015.undo.net/it/mostra/73598|website = 1995-2015.undo.net|access-date = 2016-02-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The volume==
In addition to being a catalogue of the works, the volume contains biographical entries of the artists and four critical essays:
*''What is its Function? '' by Maurizio Calvesi,
*''Experiments For The Future'' by Lorenzo Canova,
*''The Perception Of Young Italian Art'' by Marco Meneguzzo,
*''Contemporary Paradigms'' by Marisa Vescovo,
which reveal how Italian contemporary art still shows a capacity to be reborn, to find a new meaning and new energies for facing the complexity of its own historical moment, by combining elements of the country’s prolific artistic history with the most evolved inclinations of contemporaneity.&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.gangemi.com/scheda.asp?id=8849214863 File card] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711072050/http://www.gangemi.com/scheda.asp?id=8849214863 |date=2011-07-11 }} on Gangemi Editore website. URL retrieved 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Catalogue of the collection==
The [[Farnesina Experimenta Art Collection]] amplifies the Italian collection of art of [[Palazzo della Farnesina]] and represents the current state of art in [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} [http://www.undo.net/cgi-bin/undo/pressrelease/pressrelease.pl?id=1214940418 Collezione Farnesina Experimenta] «Undo press release». 5 July 2008. URL retrieved 22 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;
The collection includes works that have been created using the different forms of expression that distinguish [[contemporary art]]: from [[video art]] to [[painting]], from [[photography]] to [[digital art]], from [[sculpture]] to [[drawing]] to [[Installation art|installation]].
The eighty works in the collection are by artists from all over [[Italy]].

'''Contrastive focus reduplication''', also called '''lexical cloning''' or the '''double construction''', is a type of [[syntactic]] [[reduplication]] found in some languages. Doubling a word or phrase – such as ''do you LIKE-like him?'' –  can indicate that the prototypical meaning of the repeated word or phrase is intended.&lt;ref name=ssp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ghomeshi|first1=Jila|last2=Jackendoff|first2=Ray|last3=Rosen|first3=Nicole|last4=Russell|first4=Kevin|year=2004|title=Contrastive focus reduplication in English (the salad-salad paper)|journal=Natural Language &amp; Linguistic Theory|volume=22|pages=307–357|url=https://ase.tufts.edu/cogstud/jackendoff/papers/salad-salad.pdf|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; U.S. writer [[Paul Dickson (writer)|Paul Dickson]] coined the term '''word word''' in 1982 to describe this phenomenon.&lt;ref name="OxfordCompanion"&gt;{{cite book| title = The Oxford Companion to the English Language|last = McArthur|first = Tom|year = 1992|publisher = Oxford University Press|isbn = 0-19-214183-X|page = 1127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first part of the reduplicant bears contrastive intonational [[Stress (linguistics)|stress]].

Contrastive focus reduplication in English can apply not only to words but also to multi-word [[phrase]]s such as [[idiom]]s, or to [[word stem]]s without their [[inflectional morpheme]]s.
* I talked to him that week, but I didn’t TALK-TO-HIM-talk-to-him.
* In fact I barely talked to him. Not TALK-talked.&lt;ref name=ssp /&gt;

==Examples==
The authors of the article that defined contrastive focus reduplication collected a [[Text corpus|corpus]] of examples in English.&lt;ref name=ssp/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.cc.umanitoba.ca/~krussll/redup-corpus.html |title=Corpus of English contrastive focus reduplications|date=30 May 2014|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include:

*"and you think you know me? The ME-me?"
*"I’m up, I’m just not UP–up."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://itre.cis.upenn.edu/~myl/languagelog/archives/004591.html |title=Contrastive focus reduplication in Zits|last=Liberman|first=Mark|date=June 11, 2007|work=[[Language Log]]}} This example from Ghomeshi et al. was used by the comic strip ''[[Zits (comics)|Zits]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2835">'''Cowznofski''' is a [[running gag|running]] [[in-joke]] heavily used in the early years of [[Mad (magazine)|''MAD'' magazine]], usually as a character's last name, often with the first name "[[Melvin]]", occasionally "Lance" or "Irving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author= |coauthors= |title=After 25 years of perpetrating humor in the jugular vein, the magazine that wised up millions of kids is still a crazy hit|url= http://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F40914F83B5F117A93C3AA178CD85F438785F9|quote="Melvin" evolved as a running joke, and soon the name Melvin Cowznofski ...

It is also one of the units in the magazine's joke [[Potrzebie]] unit system created by [[Donald E. Knuth]], in which it is the equivalent of a year.

A character similar to [[Alfred E. Neuman]] named Melvin Cowznofski – a tall man with a large, broad nose, receding hair, glasses, and an obvious small brain – appeared a number of times in the magazine in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/chicagotribune/access/623511452.html?dids=623511452:623511452&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;date=May+04%2C+1980&amp;author=R+McN&amp;pub=Chicago+Tribune&amp;desc=The+genesis+of+Alfred+E.+Neuman%2C+a.k.a.+Melvin+Cowznofski&amp;pqatl=google|title=The genesis of Alfred E.

(Both ''Collier's'' and the Brooklyn Dodgers were defunct by then.) He was said to be "barred from 48 states (and [[Alaska]] will be voting any minute)"; [[Hawaii]] had not yet achieved statehood. Still, he "held a high position in our country, living atop [[Mt. Whitney]]."

[[Moxie]] Cowznofski was Neuman's girlfriend for a period in the 1950s.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=7TeJMLUqueMC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22moxie+cowznofski%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=Y-cuTbGdDI-u8AaCz8TgCQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC0Q6AEwAQ  Heritage Comics Sale 820  Ivy Oress 2006]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Population==
{{outdated|section|date=December 2017}}
The [[2010 United States Census#State rankings|2010 census]] estimated Alabama's population at 4,802,740, an increase of 332,636 or 7.5% since [[2000 United States Census#State rankings|2000]].  This includes a natural increase of 87,818 (375,808 births minus 287,990 deaths) and a net migration of 73,178 people into the state.  Immigration from outside the United States resulted in a net increase of 30,537 and migration within the country produced a net increase of 42,641.

As of 2005 Alabama had 108,000 foreign-born residents (2.4% of the state population), of which an estimated 24,000 or 22.2% were undocumented immigrants.

In 2006 Alabama had a larger percentage of tobacco smokers than the national average, with 23% of adults smoking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apps.nccd.cdc.gov/StateSystem/stateSystem.aspx?selectedTopic=100&amp;selectedMeasure=1000&amp;dir=epi_report&amp;ucName=UCSummary&amp;year=2006&amp;excel=htmlTable&amp;submitBk=y CDC's STATE System - State Comparison Report Cigarette Use (Adults) – BRFSS]{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} for 2006, lists the state as having 23.3% smokers.  The national average is 20.8% according to [https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/preview/mmwrhtml/mm5644a2.htm Cigarette Smoking Among Adults --- United States, 2006] article in the CDC's Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancestry==
The largest reported ancestry groups in Alabama according to the 2010 census were African American (26.0%), [[American ancestry|American]] (17.0%), [[English American|English]] (7.8%), [[Irish American|Irish]] (7.7%), [[German American|German]] (5.7%), and [[Scots-Irish American|Scots-Irish]] (2.0%).  'American' includes those reported as Native American or [[African American]]. &lt;ref&gt;[https://docs.google.com/viewer?a=v&amp;q=cache:WJGw9z2RkkYJ:www.uen.org/Lessonplan/downloadFile.cgi%3Ffile%3D1041-6-15955-AF_Census_Data.pdf%26filename%3DAF_Census_Data.pdf+49,598,035&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=uk&amp;pid=bl&amp;srcid=ADGEESgyigzsjZP7yBWdThzodFWP_t7GiFtOGi5W12qTf5nLj_yFzQ0YIKJn2pSyS1TIT-ZjvBx0s057h5mpwrf39HOZmlg3VzoOdaoPrNTdS6x-0SbHnwGXfzVLkDYTyIg7k4E_Zsn8&amp;sig=AHIEtbTzro9GQY6LB1-9ZG9n2r46Epyyaw Data on selected ancestry groups.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/population/censusdata/pc80-s1-10/tab02.pdf 1980 United States Census]&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, African Americans were brought to Alabama as [[slavery|slaves]], in greatest numbers in the cotton-producing plantation region known as the [[Black Belt (region of Alabama)|Black Belt]]. This region remains predominantly African American, where many freedmen settled to work at agriculture after the Civil War. The northern part of the state, originally settled by small farmers with fewer slaves, is predominantly [[European American]]. The Port of Mobile, founded by the [[France|French]] and subsequently controlled by [[England]], [[Spain]], and the United States, has long had an ethnically diverse population. It has long served as an entry point for various groups settling in other parts of the state. Those citing "[[United States|American]]" ancestry in Alabama are of overwhelmingly [[English American|English]] extraction, however most [[English American]]s identify simply as having [[United States|American]] ancestry because their roots have been in North America for so long, in many cases since the early sixteen hundreds.  Demographers estimate that a minimum of 20–23% of people in Alabama are of predominantly [[English American|English]] ancestry and state that the figure is probably much higher. In the 1980 census 1,139,976 people in Alabama cited that they were of [[English American|English]] ancestry out of a total state population of 2,824,719 making them 41% of the state at the time and the largest ethnic group.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.census.gov/population/www/censusdata/files/pc80-s1-10/tab03.pdf Ancestry of the Population by State: 1980 - Table 3&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=SVoAXh-dNuYC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=Sharing+the+dream:+white+males+in+multicultural+America++english+ancestry&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false ''Sharing the Dream: White Males in a Multicultural America''] by Dominic J.

'''Drago Jančar''' (born 13 April 1948) is a [[Slovenia]]n [[writer]], [[playwright]] and [[essayist]]. Jančar is one of the most well-known contemporary Slovene writers. In Slovenia, he is also famous for his political commentaries and civic engagement.

==Life==
He was born in [[Maribor]], an industrial center in what was then the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] [[Socialist Republic of Slovenia]]. His father, originally from the [[Prekmurje]] region, joined [[Slovene Partisans]] during [[World War II]]. Jančar studied law in his home town. While a student, he became chief editor of the student journal ''Katedra''; he soon came in conflict with the [[Communist Party of Slovenia|Communist]] establishment because he published some articles critical of the ruling regime. He had to leave the journal. He soon found a job as an assistant at the Maribor daily newspaper ''[[Večer (Maribor)|Večer]]''. In 1974 he was arrested by [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] authorities for bringing to Yugoslavia a booklet entitled ''V Rogu ležimo pobiti'' (''We Lie Killed in the Rog Forest''), which he had bought in nearby Austria and lent to some friends. The booklet was a survivor's account of the [[Kočevski Rog massacres]] of the [[Slovene Home Guard]] war prisoners perpetrated by [[Josip Broz Tito]]'s regime in May 1945. He was sentenced to a year's imprisonment for "spreading hostile propaganda" but was released after three months. Immediately after his release he was called up for military service in southern [[Serbia]], where he was subjected to systematic harassment by his superiors due to his "criminal file".

After completing military service, Jančar briefly returned to ''Večer'', but he was allowed to perform only administrative work. He decided to move to [[Ljubljana]], where he came into contact with several influential artists and intellectuals who were also critical of the cultural policies of the Communist establishment, among them [[Edvard Kocbek]], [[Ivan Urbančič]], [[Alenka Puhar]], [[Marjan Rožanc]], and [[Rudi Šeligo]]. Between 1978 and 1980, he worked as a screenwriter in the film studio [[Viba Film]], but he quit because his adaptation of [[Vitomil Zupan]]'s script for [[Živojin Pavlović]]'s movie ''[[See You in the Next War]]'' was censored. In 1981, he worked as a secretary for the ''[[Slovenska matica]]'' publishing house, where he is now an editor. In 1982, he was among the co-founders of the journal ''[[Nova revija (magazine)|Nova revija]]'', which soon emerged as the major alternative and opposition voice in Socialist Slovenia. He also befriended [[Boris Pahor]], the Slovene writer from [[Trieste]] who wrote about his experience in the [[Nazi concentration camps]]. Jančar has frequently pointed out Pahor's profound influence on him, especially in the essay "The Man Who Said No" (1990), one of the first comprehensive assessments of Pahor's literary and moral role in the post-[[World War II|war]] era in Slovenia.

Early in his career, Jančar was not allowed to publish his works, but when [[Edvard Kardelj|Kardelj]]'s and Tito's deaths in the late 1970s led to gradual liberalisation, he was able to work as a screenwriter and playwright. In the mid-1980s, he gained initial success with his novels and short stories, while his plays earned recognition throughout [[Yugoslavia]]. From the late 1980s on, his fame began to grow outside the country, especially in [[Central Europe]].

Since the early 1990s, he has worked as an editor at the ''[[Slovenska matica]]'' publishing house in Ljubljana.

==Work==
Jančar started writing as a teenager. His first short novels were published by the magazine ''[[Mladina]]''.

Jančar's prose is influenced by [[modernist]] models. One of the central themes of his works is the conflict between individuals and repressive institutions, such as prisons, [[galley]]s, psychiatric hospitals and military barracks. He is famous for his [[laconic]] and highly [[irony|ironic]] style, which often makes use of [[Tragicomedy|tragicomic]] twists. Most of his novels explore concrete events and circumstances in [[Central Europe]]an history, which he sees as an exemplification of the [[human condition]].

He also writes [[essay]]s and [[column]]s on the current political and cultural situation. During the [[war in Bosnia]], he voiced his support for the [[Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnian]] cause and personally visited the [[Siege of Sarajevo|besieged Sarajevo]] to take supplies collected by the Slovene Writers' Association to the civilian population. In his essay "Short Report from a City Long Besieged" (''Kratko poročilo iz dolgo obleganega mesta''), he reflected on the [[Yugoslav Wars|war in Yugoslavia]] and the more general question of the ambiguous role of [[intellectuals]] in ethnic, national and political conflicts.

Throughout the 1990s, he engaged in [[polemics]] with the Austrian writer [[Peter Handke]] regarding the dissolution of Yugoslavia.

==The public intellectual==

Between 1987 and 1991 Jančar served as president of the Slovene [[International PEN|PEN Center]] and through this role also actively supported the emergence of Slovenian democracy. In 1987, he was among the authors of the [[Contributions to the Slovenian National Program]], a manifesto calling for a democratic, pluralistic and sovereign Slovenian state. During the [[Ljubljana trial]] in spring and summer 1988, he was one of the organizers of the first opposition political rally in Slovenia since 1945, which was held on the central [[Congress Square]] in Ljubljana. In the run-up to the first democratic elections in April 1990, Jančar actively campaigned for the [[Democratic Opposition of Slovenia|oppositional]] presidential candidate [[Jože Pučnik]]. During the [[Slovenian War of Independence]], he and several other writers helped rally international support for Slovenia's independence.

In 2000, Slovenia's most widely read daily newspaper, ''[[Delo]]'', published his controversial essay "Xenos and Xenophobia", which accused the Slovenian [[liberalism|liberal]] media of inciting [[xenophobia]] and [[Anti-Catholicism]] (Jančar himself is an [[agnostic]]). He had been accusing the liberal media of similar attitudes since 1994, when his essay "The Fleshpots of Egypt" blamed the media for having helped the rise of the [[chauvinist]]ic [[Slovenian National Party]].

Although Jančar has never actively participated in politics, he controversially publicly supported the [[Slovenian Democratic Party]] during the [[Elections in Slovenia|general elections]] of [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2000|2000]] and [[Slovenian parliamentary election, 2004|2004]].

In 2004, he was among the co-founders of the [[liberal conservative]] civic platform [[Rally for the Republic (Slovenia)|Rally for the Republic]] ({{lang-sl|Zbor za republiko}}).

==Recognition and reception==

Jančar's novels, essays and short stories have been translated into 21 languages and published in Europe, [[Asia]] and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siol.net/kultura/dogodki/2011/04/jancar_literarni_vecer.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423161554/http://www.siol.net/kultura/dogodki/2011/04/jancar_literarni_vecer.aspx |archivedate=2011-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most numerous translations are into German, followed by [[Czech language|Czech]] and [[Croatian language|Croatian]] translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.siol.net/kultura/dogodki/2011/04/jancar_literarni_vecer.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110423161554/http://www.siol.net/kultura/dogodki/2011/04/jancar_literarni_vecer.aspx |archivedate=2011-04-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

His dramas have also been staged by a number of foreign theatres, while back home they are frequently considered the highlights of the Slovenian theatrical season. Jančar has received a number of literary awards, including the [[Prešeren Award]], Slovenia's most prestigious arts award in 1993 for his narratives, plays and essays; the [[Kresnik Award]] for best novel of the year in 1999 (for ''Zvenenje v glavi''), 2001 (for ''Katarina, pav in jezuit'') and 2011 (for ''To noč sem jo videl''); the European Short Story Award ([[Augsburg]], 1994); the [[Herder Prize]] for literature in 2003; the [[European Prize for Literature]] in 2011. Since 1995, he has been a member of the [[Slovenian Academy of Sciences and Arts]].

He lives and works in Ljubljana.

The '''Feminism and Legal Theory Project''' is a project aimed at addressing issues relating to women and law. It was founded in 1984 by legal theorist [[Martha Fineman]], a pioneer in [[feminist legal theory]]. The project nurtures scholars from around the world, bringing them together to study and debate a wide range of topics related to feminist theory and law. The project began at the [[University of Wisconsin Law School]] to provide a forum for interdisciplinary feminist scholarship addressing important issues in law and society. In 1990, the project moved to [[Columbia Law School]], and in 1999, to [[Cornell Law School]]. Since 2004, the project has been part of [[Emory University School of Law]], where Fineman holds a [[Robert W. Woodruff Professor]]ship. The project has resulted in the publication of several books on feminist legal theory. Fineman has been its director since 1984.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara J. Love, ''Feminists who changed America, 1963-1975'', 2006, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the hallmarks of the Feminism and Legal Theory Project is its quarterly, interdisciplinary workshops. Scholars from around the world converge to participate in "uncomfortable conversations" and theorize solutions to systemic legal issues. 2013 marks the beginning of the 30th year of operation for the Feminism and Legal Theory Project, and a special retrospective series of workshops reflecting on the past 30 years of [[feminist legal theory]]. Workshops over the 2013-2014 academic year will treat sex and reproduction, the family, violence, and workplaces.

'''Gender identity''' is the personal sense of one's own [[gender]].&lt;ref name="MorrowMessinger"&gt;''Sexual Orientation and Gender Expression in Social Work Practice'', edited by Deana F. Morrow and Lori Messinger (2006, {{ISBN|0231501862}}), page 8: "Gender identity refers to an individual's personal sense of identity as masculine or feminine, or some combination thereof."&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity can correlate with [[assigned sex]] at birth, or can differ from it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrc.org/resources/sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-terminology-and-definitions|title=Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Definitions - Human Rights Campaign|first=Human Rights|last=Campaign|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; All societies have a set of gender categories that can serve as the basis of the formation of a person's [[social identity]] in relation to other members of society.&lt;ref&gt;V. M. Moghadam, ''Patriarchy and the politics of gender in modernising societies'', in ''International Sociology'', 1992: "All societies have gender systems."&lt;/ref&gt; In most societies, there is a basic division between gender attributes assigned to males and females,&lt;ref name="Carlson"&gt;{{citation| last1= Carlson| first1= Neil R.| last2= Heth| first2= C.

(G. O. MacKenzie, ''Transgender Nation'' (1994, {{ISBN|0879725966}}), page 43.) — "There are records of males and females crossing over throughout history and in virtually every culture. It is simply a naturally occurring part of all societies." (Charles Zastrow, ''Introduction to Social Work and Social Welfare: Empowering People'' (2013, {{ISBN|128554580X}}), page 234, quoting the North Alabama Gender Center.)&lt;/ref&gt; some of those people are [[transgender]], [[Genderqueer|genderqueer or non-binary]]. There are some societies that have [[third gender]] categories.

Core gender identity is usually formed by age three.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"&gt;{{cite book|title=Gender, power, and communication in human relationships|publisher=Psychology Press|year=1995|pages=366 pages|accessdate=June 3, 2011|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LyMo1RUJwj0C&amp;lpg=PR1&amp;pg=PR1#v=onepage&amp;q=Gender,%20power,%20and%20communication%20in%20human%20relationships|isbn=978-0805814040|author1=Pamela J.

Gallagher |author2=James C. Kaufman }}&lt;/ref&gt; After age three, it is extremely difficult to change,&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt; and attempts to reassign it can result in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; Both biological and social factors have been suggested to influence its formation.

==Age of formation==
There are several theories about how and when gender identity forms, and studying the subject is difficult because children's [[Language acquisition|lack of language]] requires researchers to make assumptions from indirect evidence.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"&gt;Boles, 2013. Pages 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt; John Money suggested children might have awareness of, and attach some significance to gender, as early as 18 months to two years; Lawrence Kohlberg argues that gender identity does not form until age three.&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; It is widely agreed that core gender identity is firmly formed by age three.&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gallagher"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A few authorities say it forms between ages 3-4 rather than precisely at age 3, e.g. George J. Bryjak and Michael P. Soraka, ''Sociology: Cultural Diversity in a Changing World'' (ed. Karen Hanson), Allyn &amp; Bacon, 1997; 209-245&lt;/ref&gt; At this point, children can make firm statements about their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; and tend to choose activities and toys which are considered appropriate for their gender&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt; (such as dolls and painting for girls, and tools and rough-housing for boys),&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Bates Doob, ''Social Inequality and Social Stratification in US Society''&lt;/ref&gt; although they do not yet fully understand the implications of gender.&lt;ref name="Newmann"/&gt; After age three, core gender identity is extremely difficult to change,&lt;ref name="Kalbfleisch and Cody"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt; and attempts to reassign it can result in [[gender dysphoria]].&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. Coleman, ''Developmental stages of the coming out process'', in ''Journal of homosexuality'', 1982: "Core gender and sex-role identities are well-formed by the age of 3 (Money &amp; Ehrhardt, 1972). This is believed because attempts to reassign gender identity after age 3 result in further gender dysphoria."&lt;/ref&gt; Gender identity refinement extends into the fourth&lt;ref name="Kleeman"&gt;J. A. Kleeman, ''The establishment of core gender identity in normal girls. I.(a) Introduction;(b) Development of the ego capacity to differentiate'', in the ''Archives of Sexual Behavior'', 1971: "Though gender identity formation continues into young adulthood and core gender identity establishment extends into the fourth year and possibly longer, core gender identity is fairly firmly formed by age 3[.]"&lt;/ref&gt; to sixth years of age,&lt;ref name="Boles101102"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stein MT, Zucker KJ, Dixon SD. December, 1997. "Gender Identity", ''The Nurse Practitioner''. Vo. 22, No. 12, P. 104&lt;/ref&gt; and continues into young adulthood.&lt;ref name="Kleeman"/&gt;

Martin and Ruble conceptualize this process of development as three stages: (1) as toddlers and preschoolers, children learn about defined characteristics, which are socialized aspects of gender; (2) around the ages of 5–7 years, identity is consolidated and becomes rigid; (3) after this "peak of rigidity," fluidity returns and socially defined gender roles relax somewhat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Martin | first1 = C. | last2 = Ruble | first2 = D. | year = 2004 | title = Children's Search for Gender Cues Cognitive Perspectives on Gender Development | url = | journal = Current Directions in Psychological Science | volume = 13| issue = 2|pages = 67–70 | doi = 10.1111/j.0963-7214.2004.00276.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; Barbara Newmann breaks it down into four parts: (1) understanding the concept of gender, (2) learning [[gender role]] standards and stereotypes, (3) identifying with parents, and (4) forming gender preference.&lt;ref name="Newmann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Newmann|first=Barbara|title=Development Through Life: A Psychosocial Approach|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=9781111344665|page=243|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oTY_7osGmqUC|date=2012-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to UN agencies, discussions relating to comprehensive sexuality education raise awareness of topics, such as gender and gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0026/002607/260770e.pdf|title=International technical guidance on sexuality education: An evidence-informed approach|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2018|isbn=978-92-3-100259-5|location=Paris|pages=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors influencing formation==

===Nature vs. nurture===
{{Main|Nature versus nurture}}

Although the formation of gender identity is not completely understood, many factors have been suggested as influencing its development. In particular, the extent to which it is determined by socialization (environmental factors) versus innate (biological) factors is an ongoing debate in psychology, known as "nature versus nurture". Both factors are thought to play a role. Biological factors that influence gender identity include pre- and post-natal hormone levels.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"&gt;''Effects of male sex hormones on gender identity, sexual behavior, and cognitive function'', ''Zhong Nan Da Xue Xue Bao, Yi Xue Ban'' (''Journal of Central South University, Medical Sciences''), April 2006, 31(2):149-61&lt;/ref&gt; While genetic makeup also influences gender identity,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt; it does not inflexibly determine it.&lt;ref&gt;Susan Golombok, Robyn Fivush, ''Gender Development'' (1994, {{ISBN|0521408628}}), page 44: "When assigned and raised as boys, these genetic girls adopt a male gender identity and role, showing that a Y chromosome is not necessary for gender development to proceed in a male direction."&lt;/ref&gt;

A well-known example in the nature versus nurture debate is the case of [[David Reimer]], otherwise known as "John/Joan". As a baby, Reimer went through a faulty circumcision, losing his male genitalia. Psychologist John Money convinced Reimer's parents to raise him as a girl. Reimer grew up as a girl, dressing in girl clothes and surrounded by girl toys, but did not feel like a girl. After he tried to commit suicide at age 13, he was told that he had been born with male genitalia, which he underwent surgery to reconstruct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nolen-Hoeksema|title=Abnormal Psychology|date=2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9781308211503|pages=368|edition=6}}&lt;!--|accessdate=5 December 2014--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This response went against Money's hypothesis that biology had nothing to do with gender identity or human sexual orientation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Carol |author2=Diane Ruble |author3=Joel Szkrybalo |title=Cognitive Theories of Early Gender Development |journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2002 |volume=128|issue=6 |pages=903–913|doi= 10.1037/0033-2909.128.6.903 |pmid=12405137|citeseerx=10.1.1.460.3216 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biological factors===
Several prenatal, biological factors, including genes and hormones, may affect gender identity.&lt;ref name="ZhongNan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ghosh"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Shuvo|title=Gender Identity|url=http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/917990-overview|publisher=MedScape|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The biochemical theory of gender identity suggests that people acquire gender identities through such factors rather than socialization.

Hormonal influences are also complex; [[Sexual differentiation in humans|sex-determining hormones]] are produced at an early stage of foetal development,&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke, ''In Pursuit Of Difference, scientific studies of women and men'', in ''The Gender and Science Reader'', page 310&lt;/ref&gt; and if prenatal hormone levels are altered, phenotype progression may be altered as well, and the natural predisposition of the brain toward one sex may not match the genetic make-up of the fetus or its external sexual organs.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hines|first=Melissa|date=2017-02-02|title=Prenatal endocrine influences on sexual orientation and on sexually differentiated childhood behavior|journal=Frontiers in Neuroendocrinology|volume=32|issue=2|pages=170–182|doi=10.1016/j.yfrne.2011.02.006|issn=0091-3022| pmc=3296090 |pmid=21333673}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hormones may affect differences between males' and females' verbal and spatial abilities, memory, and aggression; prenatal hormone exposure affects how the hypothalamus regulates hormone secretion later in life, with "women's sex hormones usually follow[ing] a monthly cycle [while] men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern."&lt;ref&gt;Lynda Birke suggests that during the early stage of fetal development, specific hormones will enter the brain and “permanently affect how the hypothalamus works. As before, high levels of hormones known as androgens will stop the hypothalamus from ever organizing hormone cycles. If there are low levels, then it will be cyclic.” This early influence on brain determines the different frequency of hormone secretion later in male or female’s life. “Obviously, women’s sex hormones usually follow a monthly cycle,” while “men’s sex hormones do not follow such a pattern.” {{cite book|last=Birke|first=Lynda|title=The Gender and Science Reader|pages=313}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research suggests that the same hormones that promote differentiation of sex organs in utero also elicit puberty and influence the development of gender identity.

===Social and environmental factors===
{{Refimprove section|date=October 2010}}

In 1955, John Money proposed that gender identity was malleable and determined by whether a child was raised as male or female in early childhood.&lt;ref&gt;J. Money, J. G. Hampson, and J. L. Hampson, ''An examination of some basic sexual concepts'', 1955&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="GDDSD"&gt;A. L. C. de Vries, et al., ''Gender Dysphoria and Disorders of Sex Development'' (2013, {{ISBN|1461474418}})&lt;/ref&gt; Money's hypothesis has since been discredited,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Anne Fausto-Sterling, ''Sexing the Body: Gender Politics and the Construct''&lt;/ref&gt; but scholars have continued to study the effect of social factors on gender identity formation.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; In the 1960s and 1970s, factors such as the absence of a father, a mother's wish for a daughter, or parental reinforcement patterns were suggested as influences; more recent theories suggesting that parental psychopathology might partly influence gender identity formation have received only minimal empirical evidence,&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt; with a 2004 article noting that "solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;ref&gt;D. F. Swaab, ''Sexual differentiation of the human brain: relevance for gender identity, transsexualism and sexual orientation'', in ''Gynecological Endocrinology'', 2004: "...direct effects of testosterone on the developing fetal brain are of major importance for the development of male gender identity and male heterosexual orientation. Solid evidence for the importance of postnatal social factors is lacking."&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study found that the parents of gender-dysphoric children showed no signs of psychopathological issues aside from mild depression in the mothers.&lt;ref name="GDDSD"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M. S. C. Wallien, ''Psychosexual outcome of gender-dysphoric children'' (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been suggested that the attitudes of the child's parents may affect the child's gender identity, although evidence is minimal.&lt;ref&gt;M Weinraub, LP Clemens, A Sockloff, T Ethridge, ''The development of sex role stereotypes in the third year: relationships to gender labeling, gender identity, sex-types toy preference, and family characteristics'', in ''Child Development'', 1984: "Previous investigators have failed to observe a relationship between parental attitudes and children's early sex role acquisition..."&lt;/ref&gt;

====Parental establishment of gender roles====
Parents who do not support gender nonconformity are more likely to have children with firmer and stricter views on gender identity and gender roles.&lt;ref name="Oswalt"/&gt; Recent literature suggests a trend towards less well-defined gender roles and identities, as studies of parental coding of toys as masculine, feminine, or neutral indicate that parents increasingly code kitchens and in some cases dolls as neutral rather than exclusively feminine.&lt;ref name=Kane&gt;{{cite book|last=Spade|first =Joan|title=The Kaleidoscope of Gender|publisher=SAGE|location=London|isbn=978-1-4129-7906-1|pages= 177–184|date =2010-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Emily Kane found that many parents still showed negative responses to items, activities, or attributes that were considered feminine, such as domestic skills, nurturance, and empathy.&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; Research has indicated that many parents attempt to define gender for their sons in a manner that distances the sons from femininity,&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt; with Kane stating that "the parental boundary maintenance work evident for sons represents a crucial obstacle limiting boys options, separating boys from girls, devaluing activities marked as feminine for both boys and girls, and thus bolstering gender inequality and heteronormativity."&lt;ref name=Kane /&gt;

Many parents form gendered expectations for their child before it is even born, after determining the child's sex through technology such as [[ultrasound]]. The child thus arrives to a gender-specific name, games, and even ambitions.&lt;ref name="Ghosh"/&gt; Once the child's sex is determined, most children are raised in accordance with it to be a man or a woman, fitting a male or female gender role defined partly by the parents.

When considering the parents' social class, lower-class families typically hold traditional gender roles, where the father works and the mother, who may only work out of financial necessity, still takes care of the household. However, middle-class "professional" couples typically negotiate the division of labor and hold an egalitarian ideology. These different views on gender from a child's parents can shape the child's understanding of gender as well as the child's development of gender.&lt;ref name="Halpern" /&gt;

Within a study conducted by Hillary Halpern&lt;ref name="Halpern"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Halpern|first=Hillary Paul|title=Parents' Gender Ideology and Gendered Behavior as Predictors of Children's Gender-Role Attitudes: A Longitudinal Exploration|journal=Sex Roles|volume=74|issue=11–12|pages=527–542|doi=10.1007/s11199-015-0539-0|pmid=27445431|pmc=4945126|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was hypothesized, and proven, that parent behaviors, rather than parent beliefs, regarding gender are better predictors for a child's attitude on gender. It was concluded that a mother's behavior was especially influential on a child's assumptions of the child's own gender. For example, mothers who practiced more traditional behaviors around their children resulted in the son displaying fewer stereotypes of male roles while the daughter displayed more stereotypes of female roles. No correlation was found between a father's behavior and his children's knowledge of stereotypes of their own gender. It was concluded, however, that fathers who held the belief of equality between the sexes had children, especially sons, who displayed fewer preconceptions of their opposite gender.

In recent decades it has become possible to [[sex reassignment surgery|reassign sex surgically]]. Some people who experience gender dysphoria seek such medical intervention to have their physiological sex match their gender identity; others retain the genitalia they were born with (see [[transsexual]] for some of the possible reasons) but adopt a gender role that is consistent with their gender identity.

==History and definitions==

===Definitions===
The terms ''gender identity'' and ''core gender identity'' were first used with their current meaning — one's personal experience of one's own gender&lt;ref name="MorrowMessinger"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boles101"&gt;Boles, 2013. Page 101: "Gender identity is the individual's personal and private experience of his/her gender."&lt;/ref&gt; — sometime in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=GID&gt;"The term 'gender identity' was used in a press release, November 21, 1966, to announce the new clinic for transsexuals at The Johns Hopkins Hospital. It was disseminated in the media worldwide, and soon entered the vernacular. ... gender identity is your own sense or conviction of maleness or femaleness." {{Cite journal | last1 = Money | first1 = John | authorlink = John Money | year = 1994 | title = The concept of gender identity disorder in childhood and adolescence after 39 years | url = | journal = Journal of Sex and Marital Therapy | volume = 20 | issue = 3| pages = 163–77 | pmid = 7996589 | doi = 10.1080/00926239408403428 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Handbook of the Psychology of Women and Gender'' (2004, {{ISBN|0471653578}}), page 102: "''Gender identity'' was introduced into the professional lexicon by Hooker and Stoller almost simultaneously in the early 1960s (see Money, 1985). For example, Stoller (1964) used the slightly different term ''core gender identity''..."&lt;/ref&gt; To this day they are usually used in that sense,&lt;ref name="Carlson"/&gt; though a few scholars additionally use the term to refer to the [[sexual orientation]] and [[sexual identity]] categories ''[[gay]]'', ''[[lesbian]]'' and ''[[Bisexuality|bisexual]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Brym, Roberts, Lie, Rytina. "Sociology". Nelson Education Ltd., 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early medical literature===
In late-19th-century medical literature, women who chose not to conform to their expected gender roles were called "inverts", and they were portrayed as having an interest in knowledge and learning, and a "dislike and sometimes incapacity for needlework". During the mid 1900s, doctors pushed for corrective therapy on such women and children, which meant that gender behaviors that were not part of the norm would be punished and changed. The aim of this therapy was to push children back to their "correct" gender roles and thereby limit the number of children who became transgender.&lt;ref name = Padawer&gt;{{cite news|last=Padawer|first=Ruth|title=What's So Bad About a Boy Who Wants to Wear a Dress?| url = https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/12/magazine/whats-so-bad-about-a-boy-who-wants-to-wear-a-dress.html | accessdate = October 29, 2012|work =[[The New York Times]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Freud and Jung's views===
In 1905, [[Sigmund Freud]] presented his theory of [[psychosexual development]] in ''[[Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality]]'', giving evidence that in the pregenital phase children do not distinguish between sexes, but assume both parents have the same genitalia and reproductive powers. On this basis, he argued that bisexuality was the original sexual orientation and that heterosexuality was resultant of repression during the [[phallic stage]], at which point gender identity became ascertainable. According to Freud, during this stage, children developed an [[Oedipus complex]] where they had sexual fantasies for the parent ascribed the opposite gender and hatred for the parent ascribed the same gender, and this hatred transformed into (unconscious) transference and (conscious) identification with the hated parent who both exemplified a model to appease sexual impulses and threatened to castrate the child's power to appease sexual impulses.&lt;ref name=myers/&gt; In 1913, [[Carl Jung]] proposed the [[Electra complex]] as he both believed that bisexuality did not lie at the origin of psychic life, and that Freud did not give adequate description to the female child (Freud rejected this suggestion).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Freud | first1 = Sigmund | year = 1931 | title = Female Sexuality | url = | journal = The Standard Edition of the Complete Psychological Works of Sigmund Freud | volume = 21 | issue = | page = 229 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===1950s and 1960s===
During the 1950s and '60s, psychologists began studying gender development in young children, partially in an effort to understand the origins of [[homosexuality]] (which was viewed as a [[mental disorder]] at the time). In 1958, the Gender Identity Research Project was established at the [[UCLA Medical Center]] for the study of [[intersex]] and transsexual individuals. Psychoanalyst [[Robert Stoller]] generalized many of the findings of the project in his book ''Sex and Gender: On the Development of Masculinity and Femininity'' (1968). He is also credited with introducing the term ''gender identity'' to the International Psychoanalytic Congress in [[Stockholm, Sweden]] in 1963. Behavioral psychologist [[John Money]] was also instrumental in the development of early theories of gender identity. His work at [[Johns Hopkins University|Johns Hopkins Medical School]]'s Gender Identity Clinic (established in 1965) popularized an [[interactionist]] theory of gender identity, suggesting that, up to a certain age, gender identity is relatively fluid and subject to constant negotiation. His book ''Man and Woman, Boy and Girl'' (1972) became widely used as a [[college textbook]], although many of Money's ideas have since been challenged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Haraway |first=Donna |authorlink=Donna Haraway |year=1991 |title=Simians, Cyborgs, and Women: The Reinvention of Nature |page=133 |publisher=[[Free Association Books]] |location=London |isbn=978-0-415-90386-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Fixing Sex|Fixing Sex: Intersex, Medical Authority, and Lived Experience]] by Katrina Karkazis, Duke University Press, November 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

===Butler's views===
In the late 1980s, [[Judith Butler]] began lecturing regularly on the topic of gender identity, and in 1990, she published ''[[Gender Trouble|Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity]]'', introducing the concept of [[gender performativity]] and arguing that both sex and gender are constructed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Butler |first=Judith |authorlink=Judith Butler |year=1990 |title=Gender Trouble: Feminism and the Subversion of Identity |pages=front/backmatter |publisher=[[Routledge Classic]] |location=London |isbn=978-0415389556}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present views==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}&lt;!--also needs expansion--&gt;

===Medical field===
{{As of|2018}}, there is some changing of views and new discrepancies about the best way to deal with gender nonconformity. Medical practitioners, as well as an increasing number of parents, generally no longer support or believe in the idea of [[conversion therapy]],&lt;ref name="nymag-7feb2016"&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Singal|first1=Jesse|title=How the Fight Over Transgender Kids Got a Leading Sex Researcher Fired|url=http://nymag.com/scienceofus/2016/02/fight-over-trans-kids-got-a-researcher-fired.html|accessdate=April 25, 2017|magazine=[[New York (magazine)|New York]]|date=February 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is now widely discredited as unethical and ineffective.&lt;ref name="The Guardian - prayer and pain"&gt;{{cite news |author1=Tom Dart |title=Prayer and pain: why gay conversion therapy is still legal despite dangers |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2016/jul/15/gay-conversion-therapy-republican-party-platform |accessdate=9 July 2018 |work=The Guardian |publisher=Guardian Media Group |date=July 15, 2016 |ref=Prayer_and_pain |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stonewall - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Conversion Therapy |url=https://www.stonewall.org.uk/campaign-groups/conversion-therapy |website=Stonewall |publisher=Stonewall |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=stonewall_conversion|date=2015-12-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the UK, all major counselling and psychotherapy bodies, as well as the [[NHS]], have concluded that conversion therapy to 'cure' sexual orientation is dangerous and work is being done to extend this position to include gender identity.&lt;ref name="MOU - Conversion Therapy"&gt;{{cite web |title=Memorandum of Understanding on Conversion Therapy in the UK |url=https://www.psychotherapy.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Memorandum-of-understanding-on-conversion-therapy.pdf |website=www.pyschotherapy.org |publisher=UKCP - UK Council for Psychotherapy |accessdate=9 July 2018 |ref=MOU_CT |date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, there are still a number of clinicians who continue to believe that there should be interventions for gender nonconforming children. They believe that stereotypical gender-specific toys and games will encourage children to behave in their traditional gender roles.&lt;ref name="Padawer"/&gt;

[[Transsexual]] self-identified people sometimes wish to undergo physical surgery to refashion their [[primary sexual characteristics]], secondary characteristics, or both, because they feel they will be more comfortable with different genitalia. This may involve removal of penis, testicles or breasts, or the fashioning of a penis, vagina or breasts. In the past, sex assignment surgery has been performed on infants who are born with ambiguous genitalia. However, current medical opinion is strongly against this procedure, since many adults have regretted that these decisions were made for them at birth. Today, [[sex reassignment surgery]] is performed on people who choose to have this change so that their anatomical sex will match their gender identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Diamond|first=Milton|title=Sex and Gender are Different: Sexual Identity and Gender Identity are Different|journal=Clinical Child Psychology &amp; Psychiatry|year=2002|volume=7|issue=3|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/PCSS/biblio/articles/2000to2004/2002-sex-and-gender.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, it was decided under the Affordable Care Act that [[health insurance exchange]]s would have the ability to collect demographic information on gender identity and sexual identity through optional questions, to help policymakers better recognize the needs of the [[LGBT]] community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Baker|first=Kellan|title=FAQ: Collecting Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Data|url=http://www.americanprogress.org/issues/lgbt/report/2012/10/16/41620/faq-collecting-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity-data/|publisher=Center for American Progress|accessdate=October 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Gender dysphoria and gender identity disorder===
[[Gender dysphoria]] (previously called "gender identity disorder" or GID in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]]) is the formal diagnosis of people who experience significant [[dysphoria]] (discontent) with the sex they were assigned at birth and/or the gender roles associated with that sex:&lt;ref&gt;"Gender Identity Disorder | Psychology Today." Psychology Today: Health, Help, Happiness Find a Therapist. Psychology Today, 24 Oct. 2005. Web. 17 Dec. 2010. http://www.psychologytoday.com/conditions/gender-identity-disorder.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100306075726/http://www.genderdysphoria.org/genderdysphoria_medical.html Gender Dysphoria Organization Research and Education - About Gender Dysphoria&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; "In gender identity disorder, there is discordance between the natal sex of one's external genitalia and the brain coding of one's gender as masculine or feminine."&lt;ref name="GID" /&gt; The [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] (302.85) has five criteria that must be met before a diagnosis of gender identity disorder can be made, and the disorder is further subdivided into specific diagnoses based on age, for example [[gender identity disorder in children]] (for children who experience gender dysphoria).

The concept of gender identity appeared in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders]] in its third edition, [[DSM-III]] (1980), in the form of two [[mental disorder|psychiatric diagnoses]] of gender dysphoria: gender identity disorder of childhood (GIDC), and transsexualism (for adolescents and adults). The 1987 revision of the manual, the [[DSM-III-R]], added a third diagnosis: gender identity disorder of adolescence and adulthood, nontranssexual type. This latter diagnosis was removed in the subsequent revision, DSM-IV (1994), which also collapsed GIDC and transsexualism into a new diagnosis of gender identity disorder.&lt;ref name="Historical Note"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Zucker | first1 = KJ | last2 = Spitzer | first2 = RL  |date=Jan–Feb 2005 | title = Was the gender identity disorder of childhood diagnosis introduced into DSM-III as a backdoor maneuver to replace homosexuality?

The authors of a 2005 academic paper questioned the classification of gender identity problems as a [[mental disorder]], speculating that certain DSM revisions may have been made on a tit-for-tat basis when certain groups were pushing for the removal of homosexuality as a disorder. This remains controversial,&lt;ref name="Historical Note"/&gt; although the vast majority of today's mental health professionals follow and agree with the current DSM classifications.

===International human rights law===
[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], a document on the application of [[international human rights law]], provide in the preamble a definition of gender identity as each person's deeply felt internal and individual [[experience]] of gender, which may or may not correspond with the sex assigned at birth, including the person's sense of the body (which may involve, if freely chosen, modification of bodily appearance or function by medical, surgical or other means) and other experience of gender, including dress, speech and mannerism. Principle 3 states that "Each person’s self-defined [...] gender identity is integral to their personality and is one of the most basic aspects of self-determination, dignity and freedom. No one shall be forced to undergo medical procedures, including sex reassignment surgery, sterilisation or hormonal therapy, as a requirement for legal recognition of their gender identity."&lt;ref&gt;[[The Yogyakarta Principles]], ''Principle 3. The Right to recognition before the law''&lt;/ref&gt; and Principle 18 states that "Notwithstanding any classifications to the contrary, a person's sexual orientation and gender identity are not, in and of themselves, medical conditions and are not to be treated, cured or suppressed."&lt;ref&gt;The Yogyakarta Principles, ''Principle 18. Protection from medical abuse''&lt;/ref&gt; Relating to this principle, the "Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles" observed that "Gender identity differing from that assigned at birth, or socially rejected [[gender expression]], have been treated as a form of [[mental illness]]. The pathologization of difference has led to gender-transgressive children and adolescents being confined in psychiatric institutions, and subjected to aversion techniques — including [[electroshock therapy]] — as a 'cure'."&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf Jurisprudential Annotations to the Yogyakarta Principles, page 43] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122035344/http://www.yogyakartaprinciples.org/yogyakarta-principles-jurisprudential-annotations.pdf |date=November 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The "Yogyakarta Principles in Action" says "it is important to note that while 'sexual orientation' has been declassified as a mental illness in many countries, 'gender identity' or 'gender identity disorder' often remains in consideration."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ypinaction.org/wp/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Activists_Guide_English_nov_14_2010.pdf|title=Activist's Guide to the Yogyakarta Principles, p. 100|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These Principles influenced the [[LGBT rights at the United Nations|UN declaration on sexual orientation and gender identity]]
In 2015, gender identity was part of a Supreme Court case in the United States called Obergefell v Hodges  in which marriage was no longer restricted between man and woman.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/14pdf/14-556_3204.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Non-binary gender identities==
{{See also|Gender binary|Genderqueer|Third gender}}
Some people, and some societies, do not construct gender as a [[gender binary|binary]] in which everyone is either a boy or a girl, or a man or a woman. Those who exist outside the binary fall under the umbrella terms ''non-binary'' or ''[[genderqueer]]''. Some cultures have specific gender roles that are distinct from "man" and "woman." These are often referred to as ''[[third gender]]s''.

===Fa'afafine===
{{Main|Fa'afafine}}
In some [[Polynesians|Polynesian]] societies, [[fa'afafine]] are considered to be a third gender. They are anatomically male, but dress and behave in a manner considered typically feminine. According to Tamasailau Sua'ali'i (''see references''), fa'afafine in [[Samoa]] at least are often physiologically unable to reproduce. Fa'afafine are accepted as a natural gender, and neither looked down upon nor discriminated against.&lt;ref&gt;Sua'ali'i, Tamasailau, "[[Samoa]]ns and Gender: Some Reflections on Male, Female and Fa'afafine Gender Identities", in: ''Tangata O Te Moana Nui: The Evolving Identities of Pacific Peoples in [[Aotearoa]]/[[New Zealand]]'', Palmerston North (NZ): Dunmore Press, 2001, {{ISBN|0-86469-369-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fa'afafine also reinforce their femininity with the fact that they are only attracted to and receive sexual attention from straight masculine men. They have been and generally still are initially identified in terms of labour preferences, as they perform typically feminine household tasks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schmidt|first=Johanna|title=Paradise Lost? Social Change and Fa'afafine in Samoa|journal=Current Sociology|date=May 2003|issue=3|pages=417–432|doi=10.1177/0011392103051003014|volume=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vasey, Nancy H. Bartlett, "What Can the Samoan "Fa'afafine" Teach Us About the Western Concept of Gender Identity Disorder in Childhood?", ''Biology and Medicine'', 50.4 (2007) 481-490&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hijras===
{{Main|Hijra (South Asia)}}
In some cultures of [[Asia]], a [[Hijra (South Asia)|hijra]] is usually considered to be neither a man nor a woman. Most are anatomically [[male]] or [[intersex]], but some are anatomically [[female]]. The hijra form a third gender role, although they do not enjoy the same acceptance and respect as males and females in their cultures. They can run their own households, and their occupations are singing and dancing, working as cooks or servants, sometimes [[prostitute]]s, or long-term sexual partners with men. Hijras can be compared to [[transvestism|transvestites]] or [[drag queen]]s of contemporary western culture.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 92–93.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Khanith===
{{Main|Khanith}}
The [[khanith]] form an accepted third gender in [[Oman]]. The khanith are [[male]] [[homosexual]] [[prostitute]]s whose dressing is male, featuring pastel colors (rather than white, worn by men), but their mannerisms female. Khanith can mingle with women, and they often do at [[wedding]]s or other formal events. Khaniths have their own households, performing all tasks (both male and female). However, similarly to men in their [[society]], khaniths can marry women, proving their [[masculinity]] by consummating the [[marriage]]. Should a [[divorce]] or death take place, these men can revert to their status as khaniths at the next wedding.&lt;ref&gt;Lorber, Judith. Paradoxes of Gender. Yale University Press:Yale, 1994. pp. 94–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Two-spirit identities===
{{Main|Two-Spirit}}
&lt;!--section needs slight expansion--&gt;
Many [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous North American Nations]] had more than two gender roles. Those who belong to the additional gender categories, beyond [[cisgender]] man and woman, are now often collectively termed "two-spirit" or "two-spirited." There are parts of the community that take "two-spirit" as a category over an identity itself, preferring to identify with culture or Nation-specific gender terms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hunt|first=Sarah|year=2016|title=An Introduction to the Health of Two-Spirit People: Historical, contemporary and emergent issues|url=http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|journal=National Collaborative Centre Aboriginal Health|volume=|pages=|via=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170202004508/http://www.nccah-ccnsa.ca/Publications/Lists/Publications/Attachments/156/2016-05-10-RPT-HealthTwoSpirit-Hunt-EN-Web.pdf|archivedate=2017-02-02|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Gretchen Reydams-Schils gained a [[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] (magna cum laude) at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]] where she majored in [[Classics]], with her Senior Thesis on “Plato’s ‘Myth of Er’ in the Republic”; an [[Master of Arts|MA]] at the [[University of Cincinnati]]; and a PhD from the [[University of California at Berkeley]].&lt;ref name=Faculty&gt;{{cite web |url=http://pls.nd.edu/faculty-and-staff/gretchen-reydams-schils/ |title=Gretchen Reydams-Schils.Professor; Program of Liberal Studies; Department of Philosophy; Department of Theology |date=2017 |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her Classics/Ancient Philosophy dissertation was on “Stoic and Platonist Readings of Plato's Timaeus”. She acted as Research Fellow in the Institute of Philosophy at the [[Catholic University of Leuven (1834–1968)|Catholic University of Leuven]].

She teaches at the [[University of Notre Dame]], where she also runs the Notre Dame Workshop on Ancient Philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ancientphilosophy.nd.edu/ |title=Workshop on Ancient Philosophy |publisher=University of Notre Dame |accessdate=2017-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She has been a fellow at the Center for Hellenic Studies and at the Israel Institute for Advanced Studies, and also held positions as Visiting Professor at the University of Bordeaux, France, in 2013; at Montpellier, Université Paul Valéry, France, in 2005; at Albert-Ludwigs-Universität Freiburg, Germany, in 2002; and at Spiritan Missionary Philosophy Seminary, Arusha, Tanzania, in Spring 1998 during a sabbatical. She was Directrice d’Études at the École Pratique des Hautes Études Paris, France, for four seminars on Calcidius, in May–June 2004.

She edited a 2003 [[edited volume]], ''Plato's Timaeus as Cultural Icon'' which explored the influence of [[Plato]]'s [[Timaeus (dialogue)|''Timaeus'']] and attempted to account for its cultural and philosophic status.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://bmcr.brynmawr.edu/2003/2003-05-20.html |title=(Review) Gretchen J.

Mellon Foundation]] Grant, and a EURIAS Senior Fellowship.

==Personal life==
She published a letter in the Catholic magazine ''[[Commonweal (magazine)|Commonweal]]'' marking her discontent at a change to the [[Nicene Creed]], during the tenure of [[Pope Benedict XVI]], in which the phrase "
“born of the Virgin Mary”  was changed to “incarnate of.”&lt;ref name="huff"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/christmas-story-sidelines-marys-humanity_us_58ac9aa2e4b0ead5f0d41ec9 |author=Celia Wexler |date=2017-02-21 |title=Christmas Story Sidelines Mary’s Humanity |publisher=The Huffington Post |accessdate=2017-02-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article she argued that the change identified "a deep strand of repulsion at the female body in the Christian tradition".&lt;ref name="huff"/&gt; She is married to professor Luc Reydams with three children.

[[File:Human voice spectrogram.jpg|thumb|300px|The [[spectrogram]] of the human voice reveals its rich [[harmonic]] content.]]
The '''human voice''' consists of [[sound]] [[Voice production|made]] by a [[human being]] using the [[vocal tract]], such as [[Speech|talking]], [[singing]], [[Laughter|laughing]], [[crying]], [[screaming]], etc. The human voice frequency is specifically a part of human sound production in which the [[vocal folds]] (vocal cords) are the primary sound source. (Other sound production mechanisms produced from the same general area of the body involve the production of [[Voicelessness|unvoiced consonants]], [[Click consonant|clicks]], [[whistling]] and [[whispering]].)

Generally speaking, the mechanism for generating the human voice can be subdivided into three parts; the lungs, the vocal folds within the [[larynx]] (voice box), and the articulators. The [[lungs|lung]], the "pump" must produce adequate airflow and air pressure to vibrate vocal folds. The vocal folds (vocal cords) then vibrate to use airflow from the lungs to create audible pulses that form the laryngeal sound source.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lionsvoiceclinic.umn.edu/page2.htm#physiology101|title=About the voice|website=www.lionsvoiceclinic.umn.edu|access-date=2018-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The muscles of the larynx adjust the length and tension of the vocal folds to ‘fine-tune’ [[Pitch (music)|pitch]] and [[Tone (linguistics)|tone]]. The articulators (the parts of the vocal tract above the larynx consisting of [[tongue]], [[Soft palate|palate]], [[cheek]], [[lip]]s, etc.) [[Manner of articulation|articulate]] and [[Band-pass filter|filter]] the sound emanating from the larynx and to some degree can interact with the laryngeal airflow to strengthen it or weaken it as a sound source.

The vocal folds, in combination with the articulators, are capable of producing highly intricate arrays of sound.&lt;ref&gt;Stevens, K.N.(2000), Acoustic Phonetics, MIT Press, {{ISBN|0-262-69250-3}}, 978-0-262-69250-2

==Voice types and the folds (cords) themselves==
{{Main|Vocal folds|Voice types}}
[[File:Gray1204.png|right|401x400px|thumb|A labeled anatomical diagram of the [[vocal folds]] or cords.]]
Adult men and women typically have different sizes of vocal fold; reflecting the male-female differences in larynx size. Adult male voices are usually lower-pitched and have larger folds. The male vocal folds (which would be measured vertically in the opposite diagram), are between 17&amp;nbsp;mm and 25&amp;nbsp;mm in length.&lt;ref&gt;Thurman, Leon &amp; Welch, ed., Graham (2000), Body mind &amp; voice: Foundations of voice education (revised ed.), Collegeville, Minnesota: The Voice Care Network et al., {{ISBN|0-87414-123-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; The female vocal folds are between 12.5&amp;nbsp;mm and 17.5&amp;nbsp;mm in length.

The folds are within the [[larynx]]. They are attached at the back (side nearest the spinal cord) to the ''arytenoids cartilages'', and at the front (side under the chin) to the [[thyroid]] cartilage. They have no outer edge as they blend into the side of the [[Vertebrate trachea|breathing tube]] (the illustration is out of date and does not show this well) while their inner edges or "margins" are free to vibrate (the hole). They have a three layer construction of an [[epithelium]], vocal ligament, then muscle ([[vocalis muscle]]), which can shorten and bulge the folds. They are flat triangular bands and are pearly white in color. Above both sides of the vocal cord is the [[vestibular fold]] or ''false vocal cord'', which has a small [[wikt:sac|sac]] between its two folds.

The difference in vocal folds size between men and women means that they have differently pitched voices. Additionally, [[genetics]] also causes variances amongst the same sex, with men's and women's [[singing]] voices being categorized into types. For example, among men, there are [[Bass (vocal range)|bass]], [[baritone]], [[tenor]] and [[countertenor]] (ranging from [[scientific pitch notation|E2 to even F6]]), and among women, [[contralto]], [[mezzo-soprano]] and [[soprano]] (ranging from F3 to C6 and higher). There are additional categories for [[Opera#Operatic voices|operatic voices]], see [[voice type]]. This is not the only source of difference between male and female voice. Men, generally speaking, have a larger [[vocal tract]], which essentially gives the resultant voice a lower-sounding [[timbre]]. This is mostly independent of the vocal folds themselves.

==Voice modulation in spoken language==
Human spoken language makes use of the ability of almost all people in a given society to dynamically modulate certain parameters of the laryngeal voice source in a consistent manner. The most important communicative, or phonetic, parameters are the voice pitch (determined by the vibratory frequency of the vocal folds) and the degree of separation of the vocal folds, referred to as vocal fold adduction (coming together) or abduction (separating).&lt;ref name="Rothenberg_BSD"&gt;[http://www.rothenberg.org/Breath-Stream/BSD_contents.htm Rothenberg, M. ''The Breath-Stream Dynamics of Simple-Released Plosive Production'', Vol. 6, Bibliotheca Phonetica, Karger, Basel, 1968.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability to vary the ab/adduction of the vocal folds quickly has a strong genetic component, since vocal fold adduction has a life-preserving function in keeping food from passing into the lungs, in addition to the covering action of the epiglottis. Consequently, the muscles that control this action are among the fastest in the body.&lt;ref name="Rothenberg_BSD" /&gt; Children can learn to use this action consistently during speech at an early age, as they learn to speak the difference between utterances such as "apa" (having an abductory-adductory gesture for the p) as "aba" (having no abductory-adductory gesture).&lt;ref name="Rothenberg_BSD" /&gt; Surprisingly enough, they can learn to do this well before the age of two by listening only to the voices of adults around them who have voices much different from their own, and even though the laryngeal movements causing these phonetic differentiations are deep in the throat and not visible to them.

If an abductory movement or adductory movement is strong enough, the vibrations of the vocal folds will stop (or not start). If the gesture is abductory and is part of a speech sound, the sound will be called [[voiceless]]. However, voiceless speech sounds are sometimes better identified as containing an abductory gesture, even if the gesture was not strong enough to stop the vocal folds from vibrating. This anomalous feature of voiceless speech sounds is better understood if it is realized that it is the change in the spectral qualities of the voice as abduction proceeds that is the primary acoustic attribute that the listener attends to when identifying a voiceless speech sound, and not simply the presence or absence of voice (periodic energy).&lt;ref name="Rothenberg_IF"&gt;[http://www.rothenberg.org/Glottal/glottal.pdf Rothenberg, M. The glottal volume velocity waveform during loose and tight voiced glottal adjustments, Proceedings of the Seventh International Congress of Phonetic Sciences, 22-28 August 1971 ed. by A. Rigault and R. Charbonneau, published in 1972 by Mouton, The Hague – Paris.]&lt;/ref&gt;

An adductory gesture is also identified by the change in voice spectral energy it produces. Thus, a speech sound having an adductory gesture may be referred to as a "glottal stop" even if the vocal fold vibrations do not entirely stop.&lt;ref name="Rothenberg_IF"/&gt;

Other aspects of the voice, such as variations in the regularity of vibration, are also used for communication, and are important for the trained voice user to master, but are more rarely used in the formal phonetic code of a spoken language.

==Physiology and vocal timbre==
The sound of each individual's voice is entirely unique not only because of the actual shape and size of an individual's vocal cords but also due to the size and shape of the rest of that person's body, especially the vocal tract, and the manner in which the speech sounds are habitually formed and articulated. (It is this latter aspect of the sound of the voice that can be mimicked by skilled performers.) Humans have vocal folds that can loosen, tighten, or change their thickness, and over which breath can be transferred at varying pressures. The shape of chest and neck, the position of the tongue, and the tightness of otherwise unrelated muscles can be altered. Any one of these actions results in a change in pitch, volume, timbre, or tone of the sound produced. Sound also resonates within different parts of the body, and an individual's size and bone structure can affect somewhat the sound produced by an individual.

Singers can also learn to project sound in certain ways so that it resonates better within their vocal tract. This is known as [[vocal resonation]]. Another major influence on vocal sound and production is the function of the larynx, which people can manipulate in different ways to produce different sounds. These different kinds of laryngeal function are described as different kinds of [[vocal registers]].&lt;ref name=Vennard&gt;{{cite book

|isbn= 978-0-8258-0055-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; The primary method for singers to accomplish this is through the use of the [[Singer's Formant]], which has been shown to be a resonance added to the normal resonances of the vocal tract above the frequency range of most instruments and so enables the singer's voice to carry better over musical accompaniment.&lt;ref&gt;Sundberg, Johan, The Acoustics of the Singing Voice, Scientific American Mar 77, p82

===Vocal registration===

'''Vocal registration''' refers to the system of vocal registers within the human voice. A register in the human voice is a particular series of tones, produced in the same vibratory pattern of the [[vocal folds]], and possessing the same quality. Registers originate in ''[[larynx|laryngeal]]'' functioning. They occur because the vocal folds are capable of producing several different vibratory patterns.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Chest‐ and falsetto‐like oscillations in a two‐mass model of the vocal folds|url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/asa/journal/jasa/100/5/10.1121/1.416976|journal = The Journal of the Acoustical Society of America|date = 1996|issn = 0001-4966|pages = 3355–3359|volume = 100|issue = 5|doi = 10.1121/1.416976|first = Jorge C.|last = Lucero}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each of these vibratory patterns appears within a particular ''Vocal range'' of [[pitch (music)|pitches]] and produces certain characteristic sounds.&lt;ref name=Large&gt;{{cite journal

The term register can be used to refer to any of the following:&lt;ref name = McKinney/&gt;
* A particular part of the [[vocal range]] such as the upper, middle, or lower registers.
* A [[resonance]] area such as [[chest voice]] or [[head voice]].
* A [[phonation|phonatory]] process.
* A certain vocal [[timbre]].
* A region of the voice that is defined or delimited by vocal breaks.
* A subset of a [[language]] used for a particular purpose or in a particular social setting.

In [[linguistics]], a '''register language''' is a language that combines [[tone (linguistics)|tone]] and vowel [[phonation]] into a single [[phonology|phonological]] system.

Within [[speech pathology]] the term vocal register has three constituent elements: a certain vibratory pattern of the vocal folds, a certain series of pitches, and a certain type of sound. Speech pathologists identify four vocal registers based on the physiology of laryngeal function: the [[vocal fry register]], the [[modal register]], and the [[falsetto register]], and the [[whistle register]]. This view is also adopted by many vocal pedagogists.&lt;ref name=McKinney /&gt;

===Vocal resonation===
{{main|Vocal resonation}}
'''Vocal resonation''' is the process by which the basic product of phonation is enhanced in timbre and/or intensity by the air-filled cavities through which it passes on its way to the outside air. Various terms related to the resonation process include amplification, enrichment, enlargement, improvement, intensification, and prolongation; although in strictly scientific usage acoustic authorities would question most of them. The main point to be drawn from these terms by a singer or speaker is that the end result of resonation is, or should be, to make a better sound.&lt;ref name=McKinney&gt;{{cite book

==Influences of the human voice==
{{main|Voice projection|Evolution}}
The [[Chromatic scale|twelve-tone musical scale]], upon which a large portion of all music (western popular music in particular) is based, may have its roots in the sound of the human voice during the course of [[evolution]], according to a study published by the [[New Scientist]]. Analysis of recorded speech samples found peaks in acoustic energy that mirrored the distances between notes in the twelve-tone scale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn4031 Musical roots may lie in human voice – 6 August 2003 – New Scientist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Voice disorders==
{{main|Vocal loading|Voice disorders}}

There are many [[Voice disorders|disorders]] that affect the human voice; these include [[speech impediment]]s, and growths and [[Vocal fold nodule|lesions]] on the [[vocal folds]]. Talking improperly for long periods of time causes [[vocal loading]], which is stress inflicted on the [[speech organs]]. When vocal injury is done, often an [[Otorhinolaryngology#Laryngology|ENT]] specialist may be able to help, but the best treatment is the prevention of injuries through good vocal production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stayhealthymn.com/article.php?articleID=122|title=Fine Tuning Your Voice|work=stayhealthymn.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716133228/http://stayhealthymn.com/article.php?articleID=122|archivedate=16 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Voice therapy is generally delivered by a [[speech-language pathologist]].

==Vocal cord nodules and polyps==
[[Vocal nodules]] are caused over time by repeated abuse of the vocal cords which results in soft, swollen spots on each vocal cord.{{citation needed|date=November 2017}} These spots develop into harder, callous-like growths called nodules. The longer the abuse occurs the larger and stiffer the nodules will become. Most polyps are larger than nodules and may be called by other names, such as polypoid degeneration or Reinke's edema. Polyps are caused by a single occurrence and may require surgical removal.  Irritation after the removal may then lead to nodules if additional irritation persists.  Speech-language therapy teaches the patient how to eliminate the irritations permanently through habit changes and vocal hygiene.
[[Dysphonia|Hoarseness]] or breathiness that lasts for more than two weeks is a common symptom of an underlying voice disorder such as nodes or polyps and should be investigated medically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aafp.org/afp/980600ap/rosen.html|title=Evaluating Hoarseness: Keeping Your Patient's Voice Healthy|author=Clark A. Rosen-Deborah Anderson-Thomas Murry|work=aafp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir John Rhys''', {{Post-nominals|country=GBR|PC|FBA|sep=,|size=100}} (also spelled '''Rhŷs''';&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C00O1ZYs0pAC&amp;printsec=frontcover |title=Celtic Folklore: Welsh and Manx – John Rhys – Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date=31 January 2002 |accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 21 June 1840 – 17 December 1915) was a [[Welsh people|Welsh]] scholar, [[fellow]] of the [[British Academy]], [[Celtic Studies|Celticist]] and the first Professor of [[Celtic languages|Celtic]] at [[Oxford University]].&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web | title=Sir John Rhys Papers | work=Sir John Rhys Papers, University of Wales Aberystwyth, Archives – Network – Wales | url=http://www.archivesnetworkwales.info/cgi-bin/anw/fulldesc_nofr?inst_id=42&amp;coll_id=10013&amp;expand=| accessdate=13 April 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years and education==
He was born '''John Rees''' at [[Ponterwyd]] in [[Ceredigion]], to a lead [[miner]] and farmer, Hugh Rees, and his wife. Rhys was educated at schools in [[Pantyffynnon]] and [[Ponterwyd]] before moving to the [[Penllwyn British School|British School]], a recently opened institution at Penllwyn, in 1855. Here Rhys was enrolled as a pupil and teacher, and after leaving studied at [[Bangor Normal College]] from 1860 to 1861. Upon leaving Bangor Normal College, Rhys gained employment as headmaster at [[Rhos-y-bol]], [[Anglesey]]. It was here that Rhys was introduced to Dr [[Charles Williams (academic)|Charles Williams]], then the [[Principal (college)|Principal]] of [[Jesus College, Oxford]], in 1865. This meeting eventually led to Rhys being accepted into the college, where he studied ''[[literae humaniores]]''. In 1869, he was elected to a [[fellow]]ship at [[Merton College]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;[[John Fraser (Celticist)|John Fraser]], [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35734 ‘Rhŷs , Sir John (1840–1915)’], rev. Mari A. Williams, Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Oxford University Press, 2004; online edn, May 2006; accessed 15 January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhys also travelled and studied in Europe during this period, staying in Paris, [[Heidelberg]], Leipzig, and [[Göttingen]]. He attended lectures by [[Georg Curtius]] and [[August Leskien]] whilst in Leipzig, and it was during this period that his interest in [[philology]] and [[linguistics]] developed. Rhys [[Matriculation|matriculated]] from Leipzig in 1871, and it was around this time that he adopted the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] spelling of his name. He returned to [[Wales]] as a government [[inspector]] of schools, covering [[Flint, Flintshire|Flint]] and [[Denbigh]], and he settled in [[Rhyl]].   Rhys also began to write, with articles on the grammar of the [[Celtic language]] and articles on the [[glosses]] in the [[Luxembourg manuscript]] being printed, the latter in the ''[[Revue Celtique]]''. In 1872 Rhys married Elspeth Hughes-Davies.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1874 Rhys delivered a series of lectures in [[Aberystwyth]], later published as ''Lectures on Welsh Philology'', which served to establish his reputation as a leading scholar of the Celtic language. This reputation saw him appointed as the first [[Jesus Professor of Celtic|Professor of Celtic]] at Oxford University in 1877. He was also made a [[Fellow]] of [[Jesus College, Oxford]]. Rhys was elected [[bursar]] of the college in 1885, a position he held until 1895, when he succeeded [[Daniel Harper (headmaster)|Daniel Harper]] as principal.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

Rhys served on several public bodies.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;
*1881 – [[Henry Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare|Lord Aberdare]]'s departmental committee on [[Education in Wales|Welsh education]]
*1887 – Secretary to the commission on the [[tithe]] agitation in Wales

*1907 – Sir Thomas Raleigh's commission on the Welsh university and its constituent colleges
*1908 – [[Christopher Palles|Chief Baron Palles's]] commission for a national university of Ireland
*1908 – First chairman of the [[Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales]], a post that he held until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Williams|first1=Sir Ifor|authorlink=Ifor Williams|title=RHYS , Sir JOHN (1840-1915), Celtic scholar|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s-RHYS-JOH-1840.html|website=[[Dictionary of Welsh Biography]]|accessdate=1 December 2016|archivedate=1959}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
Rhys gained his [[knighthood]] in 1907, and in 1911 was appointed to the [[Privy Council of the United Kingdom|Privy Council]]. Rhys was one of the founding Fellows of [[British Academy|The British Academy]] when it was given its [[Royal Charter]] in 1902, and after his death the Academy established an annual lecture in his name, the Sir John Rhys Memorial Lecture. The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' declares him to be "foremost among the scholars of his time" in his published fields, noting that "his pioneering studies provided a firm foundation for future Celtic scholarship and research for many decades."&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

[[File:Josep M. Nadal.jpg|thumb|Josep M. Nadal]]

== Biography ==
He graduated in Romance Philology at the [[University of Barcelona]] and is Ph.D. in Hispanic Studies at the [[Autonomous University of Barcelona]] since 1975. He worked at this university for sixteen years, where he became Professor in 1987 and he held several management positions.&lt;ref&gt;Chair of the Department of Catalan Philology and Vice-Chancellor.&lt;/ref&gt; From this position he promoted the creation of the [[University of Girona]], which happened in December 1991. He was Chancellor of this new university from 1993 to early 2002. He has also been Chair of the Department of Language and Communication from 2009 to 2012. He is a member of the [http://www.udg.edu/instituts/LlenguaiCulturaCatalanes/Inici/tabid/11894/language/ca-ES/Default.aspx Institute of Catalan Language and Culture] and Director of the [http://www.udg.edu/tabid/10917/language/ca-ES/Default.aspx Observatory of European and the Mediterranean Languages] (ODELLEUM). He has promoted various forums for scientific and interdisciplinary discussion. Since 2009 is member of the Philological Section of the [[Institute for Catalan Studies]]. That same year he received the Jaume Vicens Vives Price for University Quality awarded by the [[Government of Catalonia]].&lt;ref&gt;Agreement of Generalitat of Catalonia's Government on September 1, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

His early research focused on generative linguistics and in 1975 defended his doctoral thesis ''Aspectes de la subordinació en català actual: per una sintaxi abstracta'' (''On Aspects of the Current Catalan Subordination: Towards an Abstract Syntax'').&lt;ref&gt;Two typewritten copies accessible at the Autonomous University of Barcelona (T UAB/08794) and the Library of Catalonia (Bad-4-621)&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, however, and beside Modest Prats he became interested in the History of the Catalan Language from a new approach: the study of the linguistic aspects in relation to those social and within the historical context. Both experts set themselves to write a History of the Catalan language from this perspective. In 1982 they published the first volume of the ''Història de la llengua catalana: dels inicis al segle XV'' (''History of Catalan language: from the beginning until the 15th century'') and in 1986 the second, ''Història de la llengua catalana: el segle XV'' (''History of the Catalan language: the 15th century''). Other three volumes are still in progress and researchers from the Group of History of the Language at the University of Girona, as August Rafanell, Narcís Iglésias, Joan Ferrer Costa or Francesc Feliu, have been incorporated to the project.

== A particular view of the History of Language ==
Josep M. Nadal has contributed decisively to characterize History of Language as independent linguistic discipline. Along with his research group from Girona, he has aimed to research in the history of languages from an interdisciplinary perspective, incorporating contributions coming from the field of literature, social history or other apparently further disciplines like sociology, psychology or philosophy of the language.

The team headed by Josep M. Nadal, on the other hand, has been interested in the history of Catalan language but always in relation to other historical processes that European languages have undergone, especially Romance languages. Moreover, they have worried about theoretical and methodological aspects, so that led them to discuss questions linked to the concept of language itself and the role played by disciplines such as philology and linguistics in the history of languages. These questions have focused several international colloquia held in Girona with the motto ''Problems and Methods of History of Language''&lt;ref&gt;Title chosen in honor on the illuminator work of Alberto Varvaro ''Storia, problemi e metodi della linguistica romanza'', Napoli: Liguori, 1968 (2. ed. 1980; 3 ed. 1985. {{ISBN|88-207-0697-0}}) .&lt;/ref&gt; that, throughout more than twenty years, have gathered internationally recognized researchers like [[:it:Alberto Varvaro|Alberto Varvaro]], [[Bernard Cerquiglini]], Sylvain Auroux, [[:it:Francesco Bruni (linguista)|Francesco Bruni]], John E. Joseph, [[:ca:José Antonio Pascual|José Antonio Pascual]], [[:it:Francesco Sabatini (linguista)|Francesco Sabatini]], Maria Leonor Carvalhão-Buescu, Paolo Trovato, Jean-Michel Eloy, Rosanna Sornicola, etc.

{{Culture of Bengal}}
'''Kalighat painting''' or '''Kalighat Pat''' originated in the 19th century [[Bengal]], in the vicinity of [[Kalighat Kali Temple]], [[Kalighat]], [[Kolkata]], [[India]], and from being items of souvenir taken by the visitors to the Kali temple, the paintings over a period of time developed as a distinct school of [[Indian painting]].  From the depiction of Hindu gods, [[Hindu goddess|god]], and other [[Hindu mythology|mythological]] characters, the Kalighat paintings developed to reflect a variety of themes.

==History==
[[File:The demon ravana fighting with the ape hanuman, 1880, kalighat school.jpg|thumb|left|[[Ravana]] and [[Hanuman]], Kalighat school of painting, c1880]]

In the nineteenth century, the only school of painting that was flourishing in Bengal was the traditional art of scroll paintings that was popular in the rural areas. These paintings were done on cloth or patas. They depicted conventional images of gods and goddesses and scenes from epics like Tulsidas’ Rama charita manas. The artists were villagers who travelled from place to place with their scroll paintings and sang the scenes from the epics depicted in the paintings during village gatherings and various festivals. These artists, called patuas or ‘painters on cloth’.

===The British: as patrons  this art===
[[File:Kalighat Temple, 1887.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Kalighat]], Kolkata- shown with the [[Kalighat Temple]] and the river, [[Adi Ganga]]]]
Meanwhile, the British, having established themselves in the country politically started to evince interest in art, literature, and music. They set up institutions that imparted a European style of academic training to Indian artists. The Calcutta School of Art was one such school and attracted traditional artists–the patuas—to the city.
Initially these artists were concentrated around the temple at Kalighat where there was a demand for religious art. Gradually, they started to learn from the newer techniques and discovered that these could help them increase their earnings. They started creating new forms of art and the Kalighat painting was born.

===Oriental and Occidental Kalighat===
The Kalighat School was an agreeable and unique blend of two different styles of painting—the Oriental and the Occidental—and steadily gained popularity. Among the deities that the Kalighat artists painted, the goddess Kali was a favorite. Images of Durga, Lakshmi, and Annapurna were also popular, especially during the Durga Puja festival. The artists also portrayed themes like Sita-Rama, Radha-Krishna and the exploits of Hanuman. 
Another theme depicted, dear to the Bengali ethos, was that of Chaitanya Mahaprabhu and his disciples. But the Kalighat artists did not restrict themselves to religious themes. Their paintings depicting different professions and costumes were also popular with the tourists. Even contemporary events like crime were the subject of many paintings. The artists also chose to portray secular themes and personalities and in the process played a role in the Independence movement. They painted historic  characters like Rani Lakshmibai, and Duldul the famous horse of Imam Hussain of Karbala.

==Capturing Daily Life==

An important achievement of the Kalighat artistes was that they made simple paintings and drawings, which could easily be reproduced by lithography. Such prints were then hand coloured. This trend continued up to the early part of the twentieth century and these paintings ended up in museums and private collections. The charm of the Kalighat paintings lies in the fact that they captured the essence of daily life and they influence modern artistes like the late [[Jamini Roy]] even to this day.

'''Kinal''' is a major [[pre-Columbian]] [[Maya civilization|Maya]] [[archaeological site]] in the [[Petén Department]] of the modern-day [[Petén Department]] of northern [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref&gt;Adams et al. 2004, 2005, pp. 324-326.&lt;/ref&gt; The major occupational phase for the site dates from the Late Classic period of [[Mesoamerican chronology]]  (c.600&amp;ndash;900 AD),&lt;ref&gt;Adams 2000, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt; with evidence for a substantial and expansionary building program dating from the first half of the 8th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1999, p.125.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinal was discovered in the 1960s by archaeologist [[Ian Graham]] while he was carrying out an archaeological survey of the region, although no excavations were undertaken at the site at that time.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p98"&gt;Grazioso Sierra 1992, p.98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name Kinal means "something that heats" in the [[Yucatec Maya language]]. In the [[K'iche' language|K'iche' Maya language]], ''kinal'' is used to refer a sacred fire.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p98"/&gt; The first archaeological excavations were carried out in 1990 by the Proyecto Regional Ixcanrio ("Ixcanrio Regional Project"), directed by Richard Adams of the [[University of Texas]].&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p98"/&gt; The site has suffered significant damage at the hands of looters but is now protected by custodians.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p99"/&gt;

==Location==
[[File:Peten Map v3 May archaeological sites.gif|thumb|right|350px|Map of the department of Petén showing the location of Kinal. Click to enlarge.]]
Kinal is located in the northeast of Guatemala's northern Petén department.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p98"/&gt; The ruins are situated among tropical forest on a limestone plateau projecting above surrounding swamps (known as ''bajos'') to the north and south, at an altitude of {{convert|140|m|ft}} above mean sea level.&lt;ref&gt;Gutierrez 1992, p. 81. Grazioso Sierra 1992, p.98.&lt;/ref&gt; Kinal is located {{convert|12|km|mi}} south of the ruins of [[Río Azul]].&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 326.&lt;/ref&gt; The city was built in a defensive location and was heavily fortified. The approach to the site was protected by steep hillsides, augmented by a {{convert|9|m|ft|adj=on}} high platform topped by sheer walls.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1996, p.161.&lt;/ref&gt; The fortification of the city took place between AD 680 and 810, and may have been motivated by the military catastrophe that overtook nearby Río Azul at the end of the Early Classic period (c. AD 600).&lt;ref&gt;Adams et al. 2004, 2005, pp. 329, 333.&lt;/ref&gt; It is likely that Kinal superseded Río Azul as the primary centre in the region and adopted the administrative functions that were formerly the preserve of that city.&lt;ref&gt;Adams 1999, p. 197.&lt;/ref&gt;

The city's main water source provides water all year round and has been used in modern times to supply a gum-gatherers' (known as ''chicleros'' in Spanish) camp at the site. A path has been opened through the forest from the camp to Fallabón, near [[Melchor de Mencos]] on the Guatemalan side of the border with [[Belize]].&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p99"/&gt;

==Site description==
The area of the city centre was mapped by Ian Graham and covers approximately {{convert|60|ha|sqft}}. However, architectural remains extend beyond this central zone to the edges of the northern and southern swamps, a distance of approximately {{convert|2|km|mi}}.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p98"/&gt; The plateau on which the ruins are situated is not broken by abrupt changes in altitude but rather presents a smoothly contoured elevation. The layout of the site is centred on a north-south axis centred on the causeway;&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p99"&gt;Grazioso Sierra 1992, p. 99.&lt;/ref&gt; in general the plan of the site is similar to that of [[Ixkun]] on the Dolores Plateau in the southern Petén.&lt;ref&gt;Grazioso Sierra 1992, p. 99. Laporte 2005, p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt; The architectural style of the site corresponds to the Late Classic period. The site is noted for its complete absence of sculpted monuments such as [[Maya stelae|stelae]] and altars.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p99"/&gt;

The city possessed an [[acropolis]] complex arranged around a raised plaza with external walls enclosing it and restricting access. The acropolis is unusually complex and is estimated to contain between 100-200 rooms. A {{convert|20|m|ft|adj=on}} wide [[sacbe|causeway]] runs across the site from north to south crossing from the edge of one swamp to the other. A water source is located {{convert|50|m|ft}} southeast of the acropolis and provides water all year; it was probably the principal water source during Kinal's occupation. A number of ''[[chultun]]'' subterranean storage chambers are evident at the site.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p99"/&gt;

The '''South Plaza''' is the southernmost plaza at Kinal. It is bordered on the north side by Structure 65, on the west by Structure 66 and on the east by Structure 64. From the plaza the terrain descends gently to the southern swamp, with the intervening area supporting a scattering of other structures.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p100"/&gt;

===Structures===
All of the structures at Kinal were built using masonry, often utilising natural limestone outcrops as a foundation. Stonework varies considerably in quality, from finely cut, well-fitting blocks to roughly worked irregular stones. Most of the structures possessed [[Corbel arch|corbel vaulting]]. Many of the city's structures have been damaged by looters' tunnels, some of which have cut entirely through them.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p99"/&gt;

'''Structure 7''' is located at the northern end of the causeway, near the edge of the northern swamp.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p99"/&gt;

'''Structure 33''' displays especially fine quality masonry.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p99"/&gt;

'''Structure 42''' is the tallest structure at Kinal, standing {{convert|23|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p99"/&gt;

'''Structure 65''' is situated in the South Plaza, located to the southwest of the acropolis. It is the largest building in a group of eight structures. Structure 65 is a palace-type building and is well preserved, consisting of a multi-room structure standing on top of a sizeable basal platform.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p99"/&gt; The building covers an area of approximately {{convert|1000|m2|sqft}} and stands alone facing south onto a plaza also bordered by Structures 64 and 66. Structure 65 measures {{convert|64|by|24|m|ft}} and contains 16 rooms. It is possible that Structure 65 may have served a residential, administrative or ceremonial purpose but the most likely use was as an elite residence housing members of the priesthood or nobility.&lt;ref name="Grazioso92p100"&gt;Grazioso Sierra 1992, p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rule, née Martin, was born in Buckinghamshire on 27 September 1928. She studied [[chemistry]] at the [[University of London]].&lt;ref name="obit - Times"&gt;{{cite news|title=Margaret Rule|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/obituaries/article4415216.ece|accessdate=19 April 2015|work=The Times|date=17 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
She was the curator of the [[Fishbourne Roman Palace]], when she began her work in [[maritime archaeology]] when she was consulted on the initial search for the wreck of [[Mary Rose]].

In March 1982 Margaret Rule visited [[Adelaide]], South Australia, as the keynote speaker to the Second Southern Hemisphere Conference on Maritime Archaeology. During the Conference she visited the historic Murray River port of [[Morgan, South Australia|Morgan]] and dived with members of the [[Society for Underwater Historical Research]] (SUHR) on a project to record and recover items from the riverbed alongside the town's massive wharf.&lt;ref&gt;Marfleet, Brian, (2006), ''The Morgan Project: Volume 1 – Progress, Newsletter &amp; Annual Reports (1977–1983)'', Port Adelaide, SA, Society for Underwater Historical Research, ({{ISBN|0 9588006 3 4}}), pp. 92 &amp; 107.

Her first book, ''[[Toward a Speech Act Theory of Literary Discourse]]'', made an important contribution to [[Critical Theory|critical theory]] by demonstrating that the foundation of written literary narrative can be seen in the structure of [[Oral Narrative]]. In it Pratt uses the research of [[William Labov]] to show that all narratives contain common structures that can be found in both literary and oral narratives.

In her more recent research, Pratt has studied what she calls [[The Contact Zone (theoretical concept)|contact zones]] - areas in which two or more cultures communicate and negotiate shared histories and power relations. She remarks that [[The Contact Zone (theoretical concept)|contact zones]] are “social spaces where cultures meet, clash, and grapple with each other, often in contexts of highly asymmetrical relations of power, such as colonialism, slavery, or their aftermaths as they are lived out in many parts of the world today.”  In her article “Arts of the Contact Zone,” Pratt also coins the term autoethnographic texts, which are “text[s] in which people undertake to describe themselves in ways that engage with representations others have made of them.”  &lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Mary Louise. “Arts of the Contact Zone.” Profession 91 (1991): 33-40. Web. http://learning.writing101.net/wp-content/readings/pratt_arts_of_the_contact_zone.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changing public discourse about language acquisition==
As a part of the appointment, each Silver professor must write a Silver dialogue, an essay discussing a major issue in his or her field. Pratt used her essay to discuss the obstacles and possible solutions for promoting language learning in America. Pratt frames her argument with an anecdote from a multicultural wedding:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
IT WAS a fancy California wedding party at a big Bay Area hotel. The groom's family
spoke Urdu, and the bride's spoke [[Gujarati language|Gujarati]] and [[Urdu]]. Both were practicing Muslims, but
she was from southern California, sometimes regarded by northerners as too laid-back.
The groom was attended by his two best friends from high school, one of Mexican-
Jewish-Anglo parentage and the other of Chinese and Japanese descent via Hawai'i and
Sacramento.&lt;ref&gt;Pratt, Mary Louise. "Building a Public Idea about Language." Silver Dialogues. 2002. http://silverdialogues.fas.nyu.edu/docs/CP/306/pratt.pdf paragraph 1.&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Pratt uses the wedding as a segue to expose American myths about language. Pratt systematically challenges four common misconceptions about language learning: the willing rejection of heritage languages by immigrants, American hostility to multilingualism, the limit of second language learning to early childhood, and the need of language expertise solely for national security. With each misconception Pratt shows how these factors have come together to create a resistance to language learning that has helped cause the national security crisis that the [[Critical Language Awareness|Critical Language]] Institutes are trying to solve.

Pratt shows hope for changing the public discourse and outlines four ideas that need to be promoted in order to encourage language acquisition in America. Pratt sees a need to correct ideas about mono- and multilingualism. Americans need to be shown that monolingualism is a handicap and that relying on others' willingness to learn English will simply limit transcultural communication to "all but the most limited and scripted" exchanges &lt;ref&gt;Pratt. "Building a Public Idea about Language." paragraph 9.&lt;/ref&gt; Pratt also calls more encouragement of heritage language learning and using local non-English linguistic communities to fulfill needs in language learning and transcultural understanding. Along with using heritage communities, Pratt wants to see educators place more emphasis on advanced language competency and create a pipeline to encourage those who are skilled in language acquisition. In order to bring about these changes, she calls on her fellow academics and other LEPs (linguistically endowed persons) to change how we discuss language learning in American public discourse.

'''Mexican art''' consists of various [[visual arts]] that developed over the geographical area now known as Mexico. The development of these arts roughly follows the [[history of Mexico]], divided into the prehispanic [[Mesoamerica]]n era, the colonial period, with the period after [[Mexican War of Independence]] further subdivided. Mexican art is usually filled most of the time with intricate patterns.&lt;ref name="jflam"&gt;{{cite news |title=Mexican Art Over Three Millennia |first=Jack |last=ver Flam |newspaper=Wall Street Journal |location=New York |date=October 9, 1990 |page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mesoamerican art is that produced in an area that encompasses much of what is now central and southern Mexico, before the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]] for a period of about 3,000 years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE. During this time, all influences on art production were indigenous, with art heavily tied to religion and the ruling class. There was little to no real distinction among art, architecture, and writing. The Spanish conquest led to 300 years of Spanish colonial rule, and art production remained tied to religion—most art was associated with the construction and decoration of churches, but secular art expanded in the eighteenth century, particularly [[casta]] paintings, portraiture, and history painting. Almost all art produced was in the European tradition, with late colonial-era artists trained at the [[Academy of San Carlos]], but indigenous elements remained, beginning a continuous balancing act between European and indigenous traditions.&lt;ref name="paz"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.301.&lt;/ref&gt;

After Independence, art remained heavily European in style, but indigenous themes appeared in major works as liberal Mexico sought to distinguish itself from its Spanish colonial past. This preference for indigenous elements continued into the first half of the 20th century, with the [[Mexican muralism|Social Realism or Mexican muralist movement]] led by artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and [[Fernando Leal (artist)|Fernando Leal]], who were commissioned by the post-[[Mexican Revolution]] government to create a visual narrative of Mexican history and culture.

The strength of this artistic movement was such that it affected newly invented technologies, such as still photography and cinema, and strongly promoted popular arts and crafts as part of Mexico's identity. Since the 1950s, Mexican art has broken away from the muralist style and has been more globalized, integrating elements from Asia, with Mexican artists and filmmakers having an effect on the global stage.

==Pre-Columbian art==
[[File:Cavepaintings-loltun.jpg|thumb|Painting cave in [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]]]]

It is believed that the American continent's oldest rock art, 7500 years old, is found in a cave on the peninsula of Baja California.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html Descubierta en una cueva de México la pintura rupestre más antigua de América / EL MUNDO&lt;!-- Título generado por un bot --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090213061450/http://www.elmundo.es/2002/12/12/ciencia/1292233.html |date=February 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pre-Hispanic art of Mexico belongs to a cultural region known as [[Mesoamerica]], which roughly corresponds to central Mexico on into [[Central America]],&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; encompassing three thousand years from 1500 BCE to 1500 CE generally divided into three eras: Pre Classic, Classic and Post Classic.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; The first dominant Mesoamerican culture was that of the [[Olmec]]s, which peaked around 1200 BCE. The Olmecs originated much of what is associated with Mesoamerica, such as [[Mesoamerican writing systems|hieroglyphic writing]], [[Mesoamerican calendars|calendar]], first advances in astronomy, monumental sculpture ([[Olmec colossal heads|Olmec heads]]) and [[jade]] work.&lt;ref name="pazp38"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.38.&lt;/ref&gt;

They were a forerunner of later cultures such as [[Teotihuacan]], north of Mexico City, the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotecs]] in Oaxaca and the [[Mayan peoples|Mayas]] in southern Mexico, [[Belize]] and [[Guatemala]]. While empires rose and fell, the basic cultural underpinnings of the Mesoamerica stayed the same until the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]].&lt;ref name="pazp38"/&gt; These included cities centered on plazas, temples usually built on pyramid bases, [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s and a mostly common cosmology.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p4" /&gt;

While art forms such as cave paintings and rock etchings date from earlier, the known history of Mexican art begins with Mesoamerican art created by sedentary cultures that built cities, and often, dominions.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pazp38"/&gt; While the art of Mesoamerica is more varied and extends over more time than anywhere else in the Americas, artistic styles show a number of similarities.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p9"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike modern Western art, almost all Mesoamerican art was created to serve religious or political needs, rather than art for art's sake. It is strongly based on nature, the surrounding political reality and the gods.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p12" /&gt; [[Octavio Paz]] states that "Mesoamerican art is a logic of forms, lines, and volumes that is as the same time a cosmology." He goes on to state that this focus on space and time is highly distinct from European naturalism based on the representation of the human body. Even simple designs such as [[fretwork|stepped frets]] on buildings fall into this representation of space and time, life and the gods.&lt;ref name="pazp41"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.41.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tlatilco culture figurines.jpg|thumb|Female figurines from the [[Tlatilco culture]], 1250 to 800 BCE.]]
Art was expressed on a variety of mediums such as ceramics, [[amate]] paper and architecture.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p9" /&gt; Most of what is known of Mesoamerican art comes from works that cover stone buildings and pottery, mostly paintings and reliefs.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt; Ceramics date from the early the Mesoamerican period. They probably began as cooking and storage vessels but then were adapted to ritual and decorative uses. Ceramics were decorated by shaping, scratching, painting and different firing methods.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p12"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest known purely artistic production were small ceramic figures that appeared in [[Tehuacán, Puebla|Tehuacán]] area around 1,500 BCE and spread to [[Veracruz]], the [[Valley of Mexico]], [[Guerrero]], [[Oaxaca]], [[Chiapas]] and the Pacific coast of Guatemala.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt; The earliest of these are mostly female figures, probably associated with fertility rites because of their often oversized hips and thighs, as well as a number with babies in arms or nursing. When male figures appear they are most often soldiers.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p56"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; The production of these ceramic figures, which would later include animals and other forms, remained an important art form for 2000 years. In the early Olmec period most were small but large-scale ceramic sculptures were produced as large as 55&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p2"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p6"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the middle pre-Classic, ceramic sculpture declined in the center of Mexico except in the [[Chupícuaro (archaeological site)|Chupícuaro]] region. In the Mayan areas, the art disappears in the late pre-Classic, to reappear in the Classic, mostly in the form of whistles and other musical instruments. In a few areas, such as parts of Veracruz, the creation of ceramic figures continued uninterrupted until the Spanish conquest, but as a handcraft, not a formal art.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p67"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.6-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Messico, maya, piatto da calakmul, 600-800 ca..JPG|thumb|Painted ceramic plate from [[Calakmul]], 600 to 800 AD.]]
Mesoamerican painting is found in various expressions—from murals, to the creation of [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]] and the painting of ceramic objects. Evidence of painting goes back at least to 1800&amp;nbsp;BCE and continues uninterrupted in one form or another until the arrival of the Spanish in the 16th century.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p2"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.2.&lt;/ref&gt; Although it may have occurred earlier, the earliest known cases of artistic painting of monumental buildings occur in the early Classic period with the Mayas at [[Uaxactun]] and [[Tikal]], and in [[Teotihuacan]] with walls painted in various colors.&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;

Paints were made from animal, vegetable and mineral pigments and bases.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt; Most paintings focus one or more human figures, which may be realistic or stylized, masculine, feminine or asexual. They may be naked or richly attired, but the social status of each figure is indicated in some way. Scenes often depict war, sacrifice, the roles of the gods or the acts of nobles. However, some common scenes with common people have been found as well.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p5"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; Other subjects included gods, symbols and animals.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4" /&gt; Mesoamerican painting was bi-dimensional with no efforts to create the illusion of depth. However, movement is often represented.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7"&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-ceramic sculpture in Mesoamerica began with the modification of animal bones, with the oldest known piece being an animal skull from [[Tequixquiac]] that dates between 10,000 and 8,000&amp;nbsp;BCE.&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p56" /&gt; Most Mesoamerican sculpture is of stone; while relief work on buildings is the most dominant, freestanding sculpture was done as well. Freestanding three-dimensional stone sculpture began with the Olmecs, with the most famous example being the [[Olmec#Colossal heads|giant Olmec stone heads]]. This disappeared for the rest of the Mesoamerican period in favor of relief work until the late post-Classic with the [[Aztec]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Rosas Volume 3, p.12.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:CoyolxauhquiDisk cropped.JPG|thumb|A disk depicting the goddess [[Coyolxauhqui]], 14th to 16th century, at the [[Templo Mayor]] museum.]]
The majority of stonework during the Mesoamerican period is associated with monumental architecture that, along with mural painting, was considered an integral part of architecture rather than separate.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p15"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Monumental architecture began with the Olmecs in southern [[Veracruz]] and the coastal area of [[Tabasco]] in places such as San Lorenzo; large temples on pyramid bases can still be seen in sites such as Montenegro, [[Chiapa de Corzo (Mesoamerican site)|Chiapa de Corzo]] and [[La Venta]]. This practice spread to the [[Oaxaca]] area and the [[Valley of Mexico]], appearing in cities such as [[Monte Albán]], [[Cuicuilco]] and [[Teotihuacan]].&lt;ref name="salvat vol 1p11" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p18"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

These cities had a nucleus of one or more plazas, with temples, palaces and [[Mesoamerican ball court]]s. Alignment of these structures was based on the cardinal directions and astronomy for ceremonial purposes, such as focusing the sun's rays during the spring equinox on a sculpted or painted image. This was generally tied to calendar systems.&lt;ref name="salvatvol1p2023"&gt;Rosas Volume 1, p.20-23.&lt;/ref&gt; Relief sculpture and/or painting were created as the structures were built. By the latter pre-Classic, almost all monumental structures in Mesoamerica had extensive relief work. Some of the best examples of this are Monte Albán, Teotihuacan and [[Tula (Mesoamerican site)|Tula]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p5"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pre-Hispanic reliefs are general lineal in design and low, medium and high reliefs can be found. While this technique is often favored for narrative scenes elsewhere in the world, Mesoamerican reliefs tend to focus on a single figure. The only time reliefs are used in the narrative sense is when several relief steles are placed together. The best relief work is from the Mayas, especially from [[Yaxchilan]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol2p4"&gt;Rosas Volume 2, p.4.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing and art were not distinct as they have been for European cultures. Writing was considered art and art was often covering in writing.&lt;ref name="pazp41" /&gt; The reason for this is that both sought to record history and the culture's interpretation of reality.(salvatvolp14) Manuscripts were written on paper or other book-like materials then bundled into [[Mesoamerican codices|codices]].&lt;ref name="eboone"&gt;Boone 2000, p. 28.&lt;/ref&gt; The art of reading and writing was strictly designated to the highest priest classes, as this ability was a source of their power over society.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7" /&gt;

The [[Mesoamerican writing systems|pictograms or glyphs of this writing system]] were more formal and rigid than images found on murals and other art forms as they were considered mostly symbolic, representing formulas related to astronomical events, genealogy and historic events.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p7" /&gt; Most surviving pre-Hispanic codices come from the late Mesoamerican period and early colonial period, as more of these escaped destruction over history. For this reason, more is known about the Aztec Empire than the Mayan cultures.&lt;ref name="salvatvol3p4" /&gt;&lt;ref name="eboone" /&gt; Important [[Aztec codices]] include the [[Borgia Group]] of mainly religious works, some of which probably pre-date the conquest, the [[Codex Borbonicus]], [[Codex Mendoza]], and the late [[Florentine Codex]], which is in a European style but executed by Mexican artists, probably drawing on earlier material that is now lost.

==Colonial era, 1521–1821==

===The early colonial era and indigenous artists and influences===
{{See also|Aztec codices}}
[[File:AtriumCrossAcolman1.JPG|thumb|right|An atrium cross in [[Acolman]]. During the early period of evangelization, an enclosed open chapels for large congregations of neophytes saw the creation and placement of decorated, anthropomorphized stone crosses with Jesus at their center.]]
Since the [[Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire]], Mexican art has been an ongoing and complex interaction between the traditions of Europe and native perspectives.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;

'''Church construction'''  After the conquest, Spaniards' first efforts were directed at evangelization and the related task of building churches, which needed indigenous labor for basic construction, but they Nahuas elaborated stonework exteriors and decorated church interiors. Indigenous craftsmen were taught European motifs, designs and techniques, but very early work, called ''tequitqui'' ([[Nahuatl]] for “vassal”), includes elements such as flattened faces and high-stiff relief.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p34"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mexorg"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicanarchitecture.org/glossary/index.php?detail=121 |author=Charlote Ekland |title= Mexican Colonial Architecture |publisher=Mexican Architecture |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Spanish friars directing construction were not trained architects or engineers. They relied on indigenous stonemasons and sculptors to build churches and other Christian structures, often in the same places as temples and shrines of the traditional religion. "Although some Indians complained about the burden such labor represented, most communities considered a large and impressive church to be a reflection of their town's importance and took justifiable pride in creating a sacred place for divine worship."&lt;ref&gt;Ida Altman, Sarah Cline, Javier Pescador, ''The Early History of Greater Mexico''. Prentice Hall 2003, 119.&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that so many colonial-era churches have survived centuries it testament to their general good construction.

The first monasteries built in and around Mexico City, such as the [[Monasteries on the slopes of Popocatépetl|monasteries on the slopes of Popocatepetl]], had [[Renaissance architecture|Renaissance]], [[Plateresque]], [[Gothic architecture|Gothic]] or [[Moorish architecture|Moorish]] elements, or some combination. They were relatively undecorated, with building efforts going more towards high walls and fortress features to ward off attacks.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p17"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.17.&lt;/ref&gt; The construction of more elaborate churches with large quantities of religious artwork would define much of the artistic output of the colonial period. Most of the production was related to the teaching and reinforcement of Church doctrine, just as in Europe. Religious art set the rationale for Spanish domination over the indigenous. Today, colonial-era structures and other works exist all over the country, with a concentration in the central highlands around [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p3"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.3.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Huanitzin.jpg|thumb|300px|The ''[[Mass of St. Gregory]]'', feathers on wood panel, the oldest dated feather work with a Christian subject. Made by or for [[Diego de Alvarado Huanitzin|Diego Huanutzin]], nephew and son-in-law of [[Moctezuma II]] to present to [[Pope Paul III]], dated 1539]]
[[File:The Florentine Codex- Aztec Feather Painters VI.tiff|thumb|left|Feather work artists as depicted in the [[Florentine Codex]] (ca. 1576).]]
[[Mexican feather work|'''Feather work''']] was a highly valued skill of prehispanic central Mexico that continued into the early colonial era.  Spaniards were fascinated by this form of art, and indigenous feather workers (''amanteca'') produced religious images in this medium, mainly small "paintings", as well as religious vestments.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Schrefler, "Visual Arts: Sixteenth Century" in ''Encyclopedia of Mexico'', Chicago: Fitzroy Dearborn 1997, p. 1557.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Teresa Castello Yturbide, ''The Art of Featherwork in Mexico'', Mexico: Fomento Cultural Banamex 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Indigenous writings'''  Indians continued production of written manuscripts in the early colonial era, especially [[Aztec codices|codices in the Nahua area]] of central Mexico.  An important early manuscript that was commissioned for the Spanish crown was [[Codex Mendoza]], named after the first viceroy of Mexico, Don [[Antonio de Mendoza]], which shows the tribute delivered to the Aztec ruler from individual towns as well as descriptions of proper comportment for the common people. A far more elaborate project utilizing indigenous scribes illustration is the project resulting in the [[Florentine Codex]] directed by Franciscan [[Bernardino de Sahagún]].  Other indigenous manuscripts in the colonial era include the [[Huexotzinco Codex]] and Codex Osuna.

An important type of manuscript from the early period were pictorial and textual histories of the Spanish conquest of the Aztecs from the indigenous viewpoint.  The early [[Lienzo de Tlaxcala]] illustrated the contributions the Spaniards' Tlaxcalan allies made to the defeat of the Aztec empire, as well the [[Hernán Cortés]] and his cultural translator Doña Marina ([[Malinche]]).

'''Painting''' Most Nahua artists producing this visual art are anonymous.  An exception is the work of Juan Gerson, who ca. 1560 decorated the vault of the Franciscan church in the Nahua town of Tecamachalco,(Puebla state), with individual scenes from the Old Testament.&lt;ref&gt;Schrefler, "Visual Arts", p.1556.&lt;/ref&gt;

While colonial art remained almost completely European in style, with muted colors and no indication of movement—the addition of native elements, which began with the ''tequitqui,'' continued. They were never the center of the works, but decorative motifs and filler, such as native foliage, pineapples, corn, and [[Theobroma cacao|cacao]].&lt;ref name="jcummings"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1311-diego-frida-and-the-mexican-school |title= Diego, Frida And The Mexican School |first=Joe |last=Cummings |date= January 1, 1999 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of this can be seen on portals as well as large frescoes that often decorated the interior of churches and the walls of monastery areas closed to the public.&lt;ref name="Britannica"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253322 |title=Colonial Art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The earliest of Mexico's colonial artists were Spanish-born who came to Mexico in the middle of their careers. This included mendicant friars, such as Fray Alonso López de Herrera. Later, most artists were born in Mexico, but trained in European techniques, often from imported engravings. This dependence on imported copies meant that Mexican works preserved styles after they had gone out of fashion in Europe.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt; In the colonial period, artists worked in guilds, not independently. Each guild had its own rules, precepts, and mandates in technique—which did not encourage innovation.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p10"&gt;Rosas Volume 4, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexican Baroque===
{{See also|Architecture of Mexico}}
[[File:Eternal father painting guadalupe.jpg|right|thumb|18th-century painting of [[God the Father]] fashioning the image of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]]]]
Baroque painting became firmly established in Mexico by the middle of the 17th century with the work of Spaniard Sebastián López de Arteaga. His painting is exemplified by the canvas called ''Doubting Thomas'' from 1643. In this work, the [[Apostle Thomas]] is shown inserting his finger in the wound in Christ's side to emphasize Christ's suffering. The caption below reads "the Word made flesh" and is an example of Baroque's didactic purpose.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

One difference between painters in Mexico and their European counterparts is that they preferred realistic directness and clarity over fantastic colors, elongated proportions and extreme spatial relationships. The goal was to create a realistic scene in which the viewer could imagine himself a part of. This was a style created by [[Caravaggio]] in Italy, which became popular with artists in [[Seville]], from which many migrants came to New Spain came.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Similarly, Baroque free standing sculptures feature life-size scales, realistic skin tones and the simulation of gold-threaded garments through a technique called ''estofado'', the application of paint over gold leaf.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

The most important later influence to Mexican and other painters in Latin America was the work of Flemish artist [[Peter Paul Rubens]], known through copies made from engravings and [[mezzotint]] techniques. His paintings were copied and reworked and became the standard for both religious and secular art.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Later Baroque paintings moved from the confines of altarpieces to colossal freestanding canvases on church interiors. One of the best known Mexican painters of this kind of work was [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]]. His work can be seen in the [[sacristy]] of the Mexico City Cathedral, which was done between 1684 and 1686. These canvases were glued directly onto the walls with arched frames to stabilize them, and placed just under the vaults of the ceiling. Even the fresco work of the 16th century was not usually this large.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; Another one of Villalpando's works is the cupola of the [[Puebla Cathedral]] in 1688. He used Rubens’ brush techniques and the shape of the structure to create a composition of clouds with angels and saints, from which a dove descends to represent the Holy Spirit. The light from the cupola's windows is meant to symbolize God's grace.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt; [[Juan Rodríguez Juárez]] (1675–1728) and mulatto artist [[Juan Correa]] (1646–1716) were also prominent painters of the baroque era. Correa's most famous student, [[José de Ibarra]] (1685–1756) was also mixed-race. One of Mexico's finest painters, [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] (1695–1768), was possibly mixed race.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, "Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700–85" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550–1820'', Luisa Elena Alcalá and Jonathan Brown, eds. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

The church produced the most important works of the seventeenth century. Among the important painters were [[Baltasar de Echave Ibia]] and his son Baltasar Echave Rioja, also [[Luis Juárez (painter)|Luis Juárez]] and his son [[José Juárez]], [[Juan Correa]], [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], Rodrigo de la Piedra, Antonio de Santander, Polo Bernardino, Juan de Villalobos, Juan Salguero and Juan de Herrera. Juan Correa, worked from 1671 to 1716 and reached great prestige and reputation for the quality of its design and scale of some of his works. Among the best known: 'Apocalypse in the Cathedral of Mexico', 'Conversion of St. Mary Magdalene', now in the 'Pinacoteca Virreinal' and 'Santa Catarina and Adam and Eve casting out of paradise', the latter located in the [[Museo Nacional del Virreinato|National Museum of Viceroyalty]] of [[Tepotzotlán]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1541-Arte-y-cultura-en-la-colonia Arte y cultura en la colonia] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013144844/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/1541-Arte-y-cultura-en-la-colonia |date=October 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Colonial religious art was sponsored by Church authorities and private patrons. Sponsoring the rich ornamentation of churches was a way for the wealthy to gain prestige.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p3" /&gt; In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries, Mexico City was one of the wealthiest in the world, mostly due to mining and agriculture, and was able to support a large art scene.&lt;ref name="dwarren"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Warren |first=David B. |date=April 2002 |title=The Magazine Antiques |journal=Art Journal |volume=161 |issue=4 |pages=120–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neoclassical and Secular Art===
[[File:Sor Juana by Miguel Cabrera.png|thumb|right|Posthumous portrait of seventeenth-century nun and savante, Sor [[Juana Inés de la Cruz]] by [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] 1750.]]
[[File:Verdadero retrato de Santa María Virgen de Guadalupe.jpg|thumb|250px|Painting of [[Our Lady of Guadalupe]], including scenes of the apparition of the [[Virgin Mary]] to [[Juan Diego]] by Josefus De Ribera Argomanis. (1778)]]
While most commissioned art was for churches, secular works were commissioned as well. Portrait painting was known relatively early in the colonial period, mostly of viceroys and archbishops. Beginning in the late Baroque period, portrait painting of local nobility became a significant genre. Two notable painters of this type are brothers Nicolás and Juan Rodríguez Juárez. These works followed European models, with symbols of rank and titles either displayed unattached in the outer portions or worked into another element of the paintings such as curtains.&lt;ref name="Britannica" /&gt;

Another type of secular colonial painting is called [[casta]] paintings referring to the depiction of racial hierarchy racially in eighteenth-century [[New Spain]]. Some were likely commissioned by Spanish functionaries as souvenirs of Mexico. A number of artists of the era created casta paintings, including [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]], [[José de Ibarra]], [[Juan Patricio Morlete Ruiz]], [[Francisco Clapera]], and [[Luis de Mena]], but most casta paintings are unsigned. Ibarra, Morlete, and possibly Cabrera were of mixed race and born outside Mexico City.&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew, "Valiant Styles: New Spanish Painting, 1700-85" in ''Painting in Latin America, 1550–1820'', Luisa Elena Alcalá and Jonathan Brown. New Haven: Yale University Press 2014, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mena's only known casta painting links the Virgin of Guadalupe and the casta system, as well as depictions of fruits and vegetables and scenes of everyday life in mideighteenth-century Mexico. It is one of the most-reproduced examples of casta paintings, one of the small number that show the casta system on a single canvas rather than up to 16 separate paintings. It is unique in uniting the thoroughly secular genre of casta painting with a depiction of the Virgin of Guadalupe.&lt;ref&gt;Sarah Cline, "Guadalupe and the Castas: The Power of a Singular Colonial Mexican Painting", ''Mexican Studies/Estudios Mexicanos'', Vol. 31, Issue 2, Summer 2015, pages 218–246.&lt;/ref&gt; Production of these paintings stopped after the [[Mexican War of Independence]], when legal racial categories were repudiated in independent Mexico. Until the run-up to the 500th anniversary of the Columbus's 1492 voyage, casta paintings were of little or no interest, even to art historians, but scholars began systematically studying them as a genre.&lt;ref&gt;Cline, "Guadalupe and the Castas", p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;María Concepción García Sáiz, ''Las castas mexicanas: un g´enero pictórico americano''. Milan: Olivetti, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ilona Katzew. ''Casta Paintings: Images of Race in Eighteenth-Century Mexico''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico was a crossroads of trade in the colonial period, with goods from Asia and Europe mixing with those natively produced. This convergence is most evident in the decorative arts of New Spain.&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; It was popular among the upper classes to have a main public room, called a ''salon de estrado'', to be covered in rugs and cushions for women to recline in Moorish fashion. Stools and later chairs and settees were added for men. Folding screens were introduced from Japan, with Mexican-style ones produced called ''biombos'' The earliest of these Mexican made screens had oriental designs but later ones had European and Mexican themes. One example of this is a screen with the conquest of Mexico one side and an aerial view of Mexico City on the other at the [[Franz Mayer Museum]].&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt;

The Crown promoted the establishment in Mexico of the [[Neoclassicism|Neoclassical]] style of art and architecture, which had become popular in Spain. This style was a reinterpretation of Greco-Roman references and its use was a way to reinforce European dominance in the Spain's colonies. One Neoclassical artist from the Academy at the end of the colonial period was [[Manuel Tolsá]]. He first taught sculpture at the [[Academy of San Carlos]] and then became its second director. Tolsá designed a number of [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical buildings]] in Mexico but his best known work is an equestrian status of King Charles IV in bronze cast in 1803 and originally placed in the [[Zócalo]]. As of 2011 it can be seen at the [[Museo Nacional de Arte]].&lt;ref name="statesponsored" /&gt;

Along with the construction of temples and houses artistic religious themes proliferated. In New Spain, as in the rest of the [[New World]], since the seventeenth century, particularly during the eighteenth century, the portrait became an important part of the artistic repertoire. In a society characterized by a deep religious feeling which was imbued, it was expected that many portraits reflected the moral virtues and piety of the model.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305145806/http://www.retratos.org/pdfs/TRG_121504b.pdf |archivedate=2016-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here he shows a Spanish (español) father, Mestiza (mixed Spanish-Indian) mother, and their Castiza daughter.]]

Some prominent painters of this period are: [[Cristóbal de Villalpando]], [[Juan Correa (1646–1716)|Juan Correa]], [[José de Ibarra]], Joseph Mora, Nicolas Rodriguez Juarez, Francisco Martinez, [[Miguel Cabrera]], Andrés López and Nicolás Enríquez. Sebastian Zalcedo painted ca. 1780 a beautiful allegory of the [[Our Lady of Guadalupe (Mexico)|Virgin of Guadalupe]] in oil on copper foil. In this century Josep Antonio de Ayala was a prominent artist, who is known for painting ''[[La familia del Valle a los pies de la Virgen de Loreto (Josep Antonio de Ayala)|The family of the Valley at the foot of Our Lady of Loreto]]'' c. 1769. This devotional painting was commissioned to be done for the children of the del Valle family in memory of his parents and is characteristic of the painting of this century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Seis Siglos de Arte, Cien Grandes Maestros de Romero|editor-last=de Romero|editor-first=Soumaya Slim|editor-first2=Minerva Mogollan|editor-last2=Garcia|editor-first3=Eva Maria|editor-last3=Ayala Canseco|publisher=Fundacion Carso / Museo Soumaya|year=2006|isbn=9789687794303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of colonial art says: ''"In the "Sponsorship of [[Saint Joseph]] on the Caroline College", [[Saint Joseph]] is seen as a major figure of the work, who carries on his left side the child [[Jesus]]. Two archangels flank him and maintain its long purple robe. At the top two little angels are observed with intent to crown the holy". "For centuries, the work was attributed to [[Manuel Caro]], but the meticulous restoration work allowed to find the signature of the original author. Miguel Cabrera"''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comunicacion.buap.mx/bol_mar08/boletin-d-13mar.html |title=Puebla, Pue. México, Jueves 13 de Marzo de 2008 |website=Comunicacion.buap.mx |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 18th century, artists increasingly included the Latin phrase ''[[pinxit]] Mexici'' (painted in Mexico) on works bound for the European market as a sign of pride in their artistic tradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Painted in Mexico, 1700–1790: Pinxit Mexici |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/exhibitions/listings/2018/pinxit-mexici |website=www.metmuseum.org |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |quote=This expression eloquently encapsulates the painters' pride in their own tradition and their connection to larger, transatlantic trends.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Academy of San Carlos===
[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Manuel Tolsá - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|right|Portrait of [[Manuel Tolsá]], director of the [[Academy of San Carlos]] by [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]], director of painting at the Academy]]
The last colonial era art institution established was the [[Academy of San Carlos]] in 1783.&lt;ref name="statesponsored"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253329 |title=State sponsored art |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the depiction of saints consumed most artistic efforts, they were not without political effects. The most important of these was the rise of the cult of the [[Virgin of Guadalupe]] as an American rather than European saint, representative of a distinct identity.&lt;ref name="salvatvol4p13"&gt;Rosas, 1982, p.13.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 18th century, Spain's colonies were becoming culturally independent from Spain, including its arts. The Academy was established by the [[Spanish Crown]] to regain control of artistic expression and the messages it disseminated. This school was staffed by Spanish artists in each of the major disciplines, with the first director being Antonio Gil.&lt;ref name="statesponsored" /&gt; The school became home to a number of plaster casts of classic statues from the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|San Fernando Fine Arts Academy]] in Spain, brought there for teaching purposes. These casts are on display in the Academy's central patio.&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last=Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=70–72 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Academy of San Carlos survived into post-independence Mexico.

==Independence to the outbreak of the Mexican Revolution, 1821–1911==

===Early Post-independence era the Mid Nineteenth Century===
[[File:Retrato del excelentísimo señor don José María Morelos.png|thumb|left|Hero of Independence, Father [[José María Morelos]], artist unknown, painted ca. 1812.]]
[[File:Flag of Mexico (1823-1864, 1867-1893).svg|thumb|left|The [[Mexican flag]] during most of the nineteenth century. The flag with the eagle wearing a gold crown was designed by [[Agustín de Iturbide]], emperor of Mexico 1821–22.]]
[[File:Valle de México José Maria Velazco 3.jpg|thumb|[[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]], El Valle de México.]]

Artists of the independence era in Mexico (1810–21) produced works showing the insurgency's heroes. A portrait of secular cleric [[José María Morelos]] in his military uniform was painted by an unknown artist. The portrait is typical of those from the late eighteenth century, with framing elements, a formal caption, and new elements being iconography of the emerging Mexican nationalism, including the eagle atop the nopal cactus, which became the central image for the Mexican flag.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''Mexican Art and Architecture''. London: Thames &amp; Hudson 2013, pp. 151-152.&lt;/ref&gt; Morelos was the subject of a commissioned statue, with [[Pedro Patiño Ixtolinque]], who trained at the Academy of San Carlos and remained an important sculptor through the era of era independence.&lt;ref&gt;James Oles, ''Art and Architecture in Mexico''. London: Thames and Hudson 2013, pp. 153-154.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of San Carlos remained the center of academic painting and the most prestigious art institution in Mexico until the [[Mexican War of Independence]], during which it was closed.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/ |title= Academia de San Carlos |language= Spanish |accessdate= November 30, 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090409140215/http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/ |archivedate= April 9, 2009 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite its association with the Spanish Crown and European painting tradition, the Academy was reopened by the new government after Mexico gained full independence in 1821. Its former Spanish faculty and students either died during the war or returned to Spain, but when it reopened it attracted the best art students of the country, and continued to emphasize classical European traditions until the early 20th century.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba" /&gt;&lt;ref name="neoclassbrit"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253332 |title=Neoclassicism |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The academy was renamed to the National Academy of San Carlos. The new government continued to favor Neoclassical as it considered the Baroque a symbol of colonialism. The Neoclassical style continued in favor through the reign of [[Maximilian I of Mexico|Maximilian I]] although President [[Benito Juárez]] supported it only reluctantly, considering its European focus a vestige of colonialism.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;

Despite Neoclassicism's association with European domination, it remained favored by the Mexican government after Independence and was used in major government commissions at the end of the century. However, indigenous themes appeared in paintings and sculptures. One indigenous figure depicted in Neoclassical style is Tlahuicol, done by [[Catalan people|Catalan]] artist Manuel Vilar in 1851. In 1887, [[Porfirio Díaz]] commissioned the statue of the last Aztec emperor, [[Cuauhtémoc]], which can be seen on [[Paseo de la Reforma]]. Cuauhtémoc is depicted with a toga-like cloak with a feathered headdress similar to an Etruscan or Trojan warrior rather than an Aztec emperor. The base has elements reminiscent of Mitla and Roman architecture. This base contains bronze plates depicting scenes from the Spanish conquest, but focusing on the indigenous figures.&lt;ref name="neoclassbrit" /&gt;

There were two reasons for this shift in preferred subject. The first was that Mexican society denigrated colonial culture—the indigenous past was seen as more truly Mexican.&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; The other factor was a worldwide movement among artists to confront society, which began around 1830. In Mexico, this anti-establishment sentiment was directed at the Academy of San Carlos and its European focus.&lt;ref name="pazp2"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the first half of the 19th century, the Romantic style of painting was introduced into Mexico and the rest of Latin America by foreign travelers interested in the newly independent country. One of these was [[Bavaria]]n artist [[Johann Moritz Rugendas]], who lived in the country from 1831 to 1834. He painted scenes with dynamic composition and bright colors in accordance with Romantic style, looking for striking, sublime, and beautiful images in Mexico as well as other areas of Latin America. However much of Rugendas's works are sketches for major canvases, many of which were never executed. Others include Englishman [[Daniel Egerton]], who painted landscapes in the British Romantic tradition, and German [[Carl Nebel]], who primarily created [[lithograph]]s of the various social and ethnic populations of the country.&lt;ref name="foreigntravel"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253334 |title=Foreign Travelers |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:VelorioJaraDF.JPG|thumb|right|''El Velorio'' by [[José María Jara]] 1889]]
A number of native-born artists at the time followed the European Romantic painters in their desire to document the various cultures of Mexico. These painters were called ''[[Costumbrismo|costumbristas]]'', a word deriving from ''costumbre'' (custom). The styles of these painters were not always strictly Romantic, involving other styles as well. Most of these painters were from the upper classes and educated in Europe. While the European painters viewed subjects as exotic, the costumbristas had a more nationalistic sense of their home countries. One of these painters was [[Agustín Arrieta]] from Puebla, who applied realistic techniques to scenes from his home city, capturing its brightly painted tiles and ceramics.

In the mid-to late 19th century Latin American academies began to shift away from severe Neoclassicism to “academic realism”. Idealized and simplified depictions became more realistic, with emphasis on details. Scenes in this style were most often portraits of the upper classes, Biblical scenes, and battles—especially those from the Independence period. When the Academy of San Carlos was reopened after a short closure in 1843, its new Spanish and Italian faculty pushed this realist style. Despite government support and nationalist themes, native artists were generally shorted in favor of Europeans.&lt;ref name="realismbrit" /&gt;

One of the most important painters in Mexico in the mid 19th century was Catalan [[Pelegrí Clavé]], who painted landscapes but was best known for his depictions of the intellectual elite of Mexico City. Realist painters also attempted to portray Aztec culture and people by depicting settings inhabited by indigenous people, using live indigenous models and costumes based on those in Conquest era codices. One of these was [[Félix Parra]], whose depictions of the conquest empathized with the suffering of the indigenous. In 1869, José Obregón painted ''The Discovery of Pulque''; he based his depictions of architecture on [[Mixtec]] codices, but misrepresented temples as a setting for a throne.&lt;ref name="realismbrit"&gt;dead link {{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253336 |title=Realism |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The art of the 19th century after Independence is considered to have declined, especially during the late 19th century and early 20th, during the regime of [[Porfirio Díaz]] (1876–1911).  Although during this time, painting, sculpture, and the decorative arts were often limited to imitation of European styles,&lt;ref name="tburton"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1205-dr-atl-and-the-revolution-in-mexico-s-art |title= Dr. Atl and the revolution in Mexico's art |first=Tony |last=Burton |date= March 14, 2008 |publisher=Mexconnect newsletter |issn=1028-9089 |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the emergence of young artists, such as [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Saturnino Herrán]], increased the focus on Mexican-themed works. This meant that following the military phase of the [[Mexican Revolution]] in the 1920s, Mexican artists made huge strides is forging a robust artistic nationalism.

In this century there are examples of murals such as folkloric style created between 1855 and 1867 in La Barca, Jalisco.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arts-history.mx/semanario/index.php?id_nota=02042008173408 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-10-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141030053129/http://www.arts-history.mx/semanario/index.php?id_nota=02042008173408 |archivedate=2014-10-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Highlights at this time: Pelegrín Clavé, [[Juan Cordero]], Felipe Santiago Gutiérrez and José Agustín Arrieta.
In Mexico, in 1846 he was hired to direct Pelegrín Clavé's reopening of the Academy of San Carlos, a body from which he promoted the historical and landscaping themes with a pro-European vision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/cercadetuarte/pintura.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015220757/http://www.geocities.com/cercadetuarte/pintura.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2007-10-15 |title=Pintura |website=Web.archive.org |date=2007-10-15 |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Academy of San Carlos continued to advocate classic, European-style training until 1913. In this year, the academy was partially integrated with [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM). Between 1929 and the 1950s, the academy’s architecture program was split off as a department of the university; the programs in painting, sculpture, and engraving were renamed the National School of Expressive Arts, now the [[Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas "Rafael Rodríguez Padilla"|Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas]] (ENAP). Both moved to the south of the city in the mid-20th century, to [[Ciudad Universitaria]] and [[Xochimilco]] respectively, leaving only some graduate programs in fine arts in the original academy building in the [[historic center of Mexico City|historic center]]. ENAP remains one of the main centers for the training of Mexico’s artists.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;

===Mexican muralism and Revolutionary art===
[[File:Fragmento Mural Alfredo Zalce 6 063.jpg|thumb|Detail of mural "Gente y paisaje de Michoacán" at the Palacio de Gobierno in [[Michoacán]] (1962)]]
{{Further|Mexican muralism}}

While a shift to more indigenous and Mexican themes appeared in the 19th century, the [[Mexican Revolution]] from 1910 to 1920 had a dramatic effect on Mexican art.&lt;ref name="historic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="arquitectuba" /&gt; The conflict resulted in the rise of the Partido Revolucionario Nacional (renamed the [[Partido Revolucionario Institucional]]), which took the country in a socialist direction. The government became an ally to many of the intellectuals and artists in Mexico City&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; and commissioned murals for public buildings to reinforce its political messages including those that emphasized Mexican rather than European themes. These were not created for popular or commercial tastes; however, they gained recognition not only in Mexico, but in the United States.&lt;ref name="pazp24"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

This production of art in conjunction with government propaganda is known as the Mexican Modernist School or the Mexican Muralist Movement, and it redefined art in Mexico.&lt;ref name="pazp298299"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.298-299.&lt;/ref&gt; Octavio Paz gives [[José Vasconcelos]] credit for initiating the Muralist movement in Mexico by commissioning the best-known painters in 1921 to decorate the walls of public buildings. The commissions were politically motivated—they aimed to glorify the [[Mexican Revolution]] and redefine the Mexican people vis-à-vis their indigenous and Spanish past.&lt;ref name="pazp11"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.11.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first of these commissioned paintings were at [[San Ildefonso College|San Ildefonso]] done by Fernando Leal, [[Fermín Revueltas]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], and [[Diego Rivera]]. The first true fresco in the building was the work of [[Jean Charlot]]. However, technical errors were made in the construction of these murals: a number of them began to blister and were covered in wax for preservation.&lt;ref name="pazp12"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.12.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roberto Montenegro]] painted the [[San Pedro y San Pablo College (Museum of Light)|former church and monastery of San Pedro y San Pablo]], but the mural in the church was painted in [[tempera]] and began to flake. In the monastery area, Montenegro painted the ''Feast of the Holy Cross,'' which depicts Vasconcelos as the protector of Muralists. Vasconcelos was later blanked out and a figure of a woman was painted over him.&lt;ref name="pazp1213"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.12-13.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first protagonist in the production of modern murals in Mexico was [[Dr. Atl]]. Dr Atl was born “Gerard Murillo” in [[Guadalajara, Mexico|Guadalajara]] in 1875. He changed his name in order to identify himself as Mexican. Atl worked to promote [[Mexican handcrafts and folk art|Mexico's folk art and handcrafts]]. While he had some success as a painter in Guadalajara, his radical ideas against academia and the government prompted him to move to more liberal Mexico City. In 1910, months before the start of the [[Mexican Revolution]], Atl painted the first modern mural in Mexico. He taught major artists to follow him, including those who came to dominate Mexican mural painting.&lt;ref name="tburton" /&gt;

The muralist movement reached its height in the 1930s with four main protagonists: [[Diego Rivera]], [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]], [[José Clemente Orozco]], and Fernando Leal. It is the most studied part of Mexico's art history.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt;&lt;ref name="alee"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Lee |first=Anthony |date=Spring 1999 |title= Mexican murals and their meaning |journal=Art Journal |volume=58 |issue=1 |pages=114–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; All were artists trained in classical European techniques and many of their early works are imitations of then-fashionable European paintings styles, some of which were adapted to Mexican themes.&lt;ref name="jflam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="pazp298299" /&gt; The political situation in Mexico from the 1920s to 1950s and the influence of Dr. Atl prompted these artists to break with European traditions, using bold indigenous images, lots of color, and depictions of human activity, especially of the masses, in contrast to the solemn and detached art of Europe.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;

Preferred mediums generally excluded traditional canvases and church porticos and instead were the large, then-undecorated walls of Mexico's government buildings. The main goal in many of these paintings was the glorification of Mexico's pre-Hispanic past as a definition of Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; They had success in both Mexico and the United States, which brought them fame and wealth as well as Mexican and American students.&lt;ref name="pazp24" /&gt;

These muralists revived the fresco technique for their mural work, although Siqueiros moved to industrial techniques and materials such as the application of [[pyroxilin]], a commercial enamel used for airplanes and automobiles.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; One of Rivera's earliest mural efforts emblazoned the courtyard of the Ministry of Education with a series of dancing tehuanas (natives of [[Tehuantepec]] in southern Mexico). This four-year project went on to incorporate other contemporary indigenous themes, and it eventually encompassed 124 frescoes that extended three stories high and two city blocks long.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; The [[Abelardo L. Rodriguez Market, Mexico City|Abelardo Rodriguez Market]] was painted in 1933 by students of Diego Rivera, one of whom was [[Isamu Noguchi]].&lt;ref name="pazp16"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure of this time period was [[Frida Kahlo]], the wife of Diego Rivera. While she painted canvases instead of murals, she is still considered part of the Mexican Modernist School as her work emphasized Mexican folk culture and colors.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt;&lt;ref name="dgoddard"&gt;{{cite news |title= enfoque ; Artistic update ; Mexican art featured at Blue Star and the Instituto de Mexico |first= Dan R. |last= Goddard |newspaper=Conexion |location=San Antonio, Texas |date=May 20, 2004 |page=20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's self-portraits during the 1930s and 40s were in stark contrast to the lavish murals artists like her husband were creating at the time. Having suffered a crippling bus accident earlier in her teenage life, she began to challenge Mexico's obsession with the female body. Her portraits, purposefully small, addressed a wide range of topics not being addressed by the mainstream art world at the time. These included motherhood, domestic violence, and male egoism. 

Her paintings never had subjects wearing lavish jewelry or fancy clothes like those found in muralist paintings. Instead, she would sparsely dress herself up, and when there were accessories, it added that much more importance to them. She would also depict herself in very surreal, unsettling scenarios like in ''[[The Two Fridas]]'' where she depicts two versions of herself, one with a broken heart and one with a healthy infusing the broken heart with “hopeful” blood., or Henry Ford Hospital where she depicts herself in having an abortion and the struggle she had in real life coming to terms with it.

Although she was the wife of Diego Rivera, her self-portraits stayed rather obscured from the public eye until well after her passing in 1954.  Her art has grown in popularity and she is seen by many to be one of the earliest and most influential feminist artists of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Meade |first=Teresa |title=The History of Modern Latin America |year=2016 |pages=192-193}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Selling Mexican art abroad===
Despite maintaining an active national art scene, Mexican artists after the muralist period had a difficult time breaking into the international art market. One reason for this is that in the Americas, Mexico City was replaced by New York as the center of the art community, especially for patronage.&lt;ref name="pazp25"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Within Mexico, government sponsorship of art in the 20th century (dominated until 2000 by the PRI party) meant religious themes and criticism of the government were effectively censored. This was mostly passive, with the government giving grants to artists who conformed to their requirements.&lt;ref name="rgallop11" /&gt;

===Other Artistic Expressions 1920–1950===
[[File:HoyTamayoBADF.JPG|thumb|300px|''Mexico de Hoy'' by Rufino Tamayo on the first floor of the [[Palacio de Bellas Artes]]]]
The first to break with the nationalistic and political tone of the muralist movement was [[Rufino Tamayo]]. For this reason he was first appreciated outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="pazp2425"&gt;Paz, 1987 p.24-25.&lt;/ref&gt; Tamayo was a contemporary to Rivera, Siqueiros, and Orozco, and trained at the Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes. Like them he explored Mexican identity in his work after the Mexican Revolution. However, he rejected the political Social Realism popularized by the three other artists and was rejected by the new establishment.&lt;ref name="miami" /&gt;

He left for New York in 1926 where success allowed him to exhibit in his native Mexico. His lack of support for the post-Revolutionary government was controversial. Because of this he mostly remained in New York, continuing with his success there and later in Europe. His rivalry with the main three Mexican muralists continued both in Mexico and internationally through the 1950s. Even a belated honorific of “The Fourth Great One” was controversial.&lt;ref name="miami"&gt;{{cite news |title= Mexican Master |author= Carlos Suarez De Jesus |url= http://www.miaminewtimes.com/2007-07-05/culture/mexican-master/full |newspaper=Miami New Times |location=Miami |date=July 5, 2007 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, [[Wolfgang Paalen]] published the extremely influential ''[[DYN (magazine)|DYN]]'' magazine in Mexico City, which focussed on a transitional movement between surrealism to abstract expressionism.

In 1953, [[Museo Experimental El Eco]] (in Mexico City) opened; it was created by [[Mathias Goeritz]].

===The Rupture Movement===
{{Further|Generación de la Ruptura}}

[[File:Murayl y tempusfugit.jpg|thumb|160px|A mural and clock sculpture by [[Manuel Felguerez]] at [[Universidad La Salle]], Campus central.]]
The first major movement after the muralists was the [[Generación de la Ruptura|Rupture Movement]], which began in the 1950s and 1960s with painters such as [[José Luis Cuevas]], Gilberto Navarro, [[Rafael Coronel]], Alfredo Casaneda, and sculptor [[Juan Soriano]]. They rejected social realism and nationalism and incorporated surrealism, visual paradoxes, and elements of Old World painting styles.&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rfajardo"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fajardo |first=Renee |date=September 10, 2003 |title= Miradas Del Arte Mexicano; A modern perspective on contemporary Mexican art |journal=La Voz Bilinguë |page=25 |location=Denver, Colorado }}&lt;/ref&gt; This break meant that later Mexican artists were generally not influenced by muralism or by Mexican folk art.&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt;

José Luis Cuevas created self-portraits in which he reconstructed scenes from famous paintings by Spanish artists such as [[Diego Velázquez]], [[Francisco de Goya]], and [[Picasso]]. Like Kahlo before him, he drew himself but instead of being centered, his image is often to the side, as an observer. The goal was to emphasize the transformation of received visual culture.&lt;ref name="trends1950"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253344 |title=Trends 1950–1970 |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another important figure during this time period was Swiss-Mexican [[Gunther Gerzso]], but his work was a “hard-edged variant”{{cite quote|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--Is this is a quotation from a critic, or "scare-quotes"?--&gt; of Abstract Expressionism, based on clearly defined geometric forms as well as colors, with an effect that makes them look like low relief. His work was a mix of European abstraction and Latin American influences, including Mesoamerican ones.&lt;ref name="trends1950" /&gt;&lt;ref name="violencia"&gt;{{cite news |title= Opinion invitada/ Gunther Gerzso/Gunther Gerzso: una violencia metaforica |first=Cuauhtemoc |last=Medina |newspaper=Mural |location=Guadalajara, Mexico |date=April 3, 2000 |page=9 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Invited opinion/Gunther Gerzo:metaphoric violence }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[watercolor]] field we can distinguish [[Edgardo Coghlan]] and [[Ignacio Barrios]] who were not aligned to a specific artistic movement but were not less important.

===The Olympics in Mexico City (1968); later===
"Designed by [[Mathias Goeritz]], a series of sculptures ... [lined] the "Route of Friendship" ([[Ruta de la Amistad]]) in celebration of the Olympics ... In contestation to the government-sanctioned artistic exhibition for the Olympics, a group of diverse, independent visual artists organize a counterpresentation entitled ''[[Salón Independiente]]'', or ''Independent Salon''; the exhibition signifies a key event in the resistance by artists of state-controlled cultural policies. This show of antigovernment efforts by artists would also be expressed in a mural in support of student movement's protests; the work became known as the ''Mural Efímero'' (or ''Ephemeral Mural'')" at [[National Autonomous University of Mexico|UNAM]]".&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXV"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M.

Saragoza, Editors|title=Mexico Today: An Encyclopedia of Life in the Republic: Volume One|date=2012|isbn=978-0-313-34948-5|page=XXV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The third Independent Salon was staged in 1970. In 1976 "[[Fernando Gambao]] spearheads the organization of an exposition of abstract art entitled ''El Geometrismo Mexicano Una Tendencia Actual''".&lt;ref name="ZaragozaXXVI"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alex M.

"In an attempt to reassess ... post-1968 Mexican art, the Museum of Science and Art at UNAM" organized in 2007, the exhibition ''La Era de la Discrepancia. Arte y cultura visual en México 1968-1997''

In 1990 the exhibition ''Mexico: Esplendor de Treinta Siglos'', started its world tour at [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in New York.

===Neo-expressionism===
From the 1960s to the 1980s [[Neo-expressionist]] art was represented in Mexico by [[Manuel Felguerez]], Teresa Cito, Alejandro Pinatado, and [[Jan Hendrix]].&lt;ref name="rfajardo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="huella"&gt;{{cite news |title= Manuel Felguerez: La huella de su arte |first=Leticia |last=Sanchez |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=July 11, 1997 |page=1 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Felguerez:The mark of his art }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Swiss-German artist, [[Mathias Goeritz]], in the 1950s created public sculptures including the ''Torres Satélite'' in [[Ciudad Satélite]]. In the 1960s, he became central to the development of abstract and other modern art along with [[José Luis Cuevas]] and [[Pedro Friedeberg]].&lt;ref name="rogallery"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://rogallery.com/Goeritz_Mathias/goeritz-biography.html |title= Mathias Goeritz, German-Mexican (1915–1990) |publisher= RO Gallery |location=Mexico City |accessdate=November 30, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Neomexicanismo===
In the mid-1980s, the next major movement in Mexico was Neomexicanismo, a slightly surreal, somewhat kitsch and postmodern version of Social Realism that focused on popular culture rather than history.&lt;ref name="jcummings" /&gt; The name ''neomexicanismo'' was originally used by critics to belittle the movement.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} Works were not necessarily murals: they used other mediums such as collage and often parodied and allegorized cultural icons, mass media, religion, and other aspects of Mexican culture. This generation of artists were interested in traditional Mexican values and exploring their roots—often questioning or subverting them. Another common theme was Mexican culture vis-à-vis globalization.&lt;ref name="artmod"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mam.org.mx/exposiciones/actuales/376-ineomexicanismos-ficciones-identitarias-en-el-mexico-de-los-ochenta |title=¿Neomexicanismos?

===Postmodern===
Art from the 1990s to the present is roughly categorized as Postmodern, although this term has been used to describe works created before the 1990s. Major artists associated with this label include [[Betsabeé Romero]],&lt;ref name="nunes"&gt;{{cite news |title= ART IN REVIEW; Betsabee Romero |first=Ken |last=Johnson |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2000/07/28/arts/art-in-review-betsabee-romero.html |newspaper=New York Times |location=New York |date=July 28, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Monica Castillo]], [[Francisco Larios]],&lt;ref name="dgoddard" /&gt; Martha Chapa and Diego Toledo.&lt;ref name="rfajardo" /&gt;

The success of Mexican artists is demonstrated by their inclusion in galleries in New York, London, and [[Zurich]].&lt;ref name="rgallop10"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Art collections and galleries===
In 1974 Museo de Arte Carrillo Gil (MACG), a gallery and museum, opened.

[[Museo Tamayo de Arte Contemporáneo]] opened in Mexico City in 1981. The [[Museo Nacional de Arte|National Museum of Art]] (MUNAL) opened in 1982.

[[Centro Cultural Arte Contemporáneo]] opened in Mexico City in 1986, now defunct. "In 1998 ... with the sudden death of its chief executive, [[Televisa]] closed ... [the gallery] for a time, as the turnover in the company coincided with a drastic drop in the company's profitability".

Private art exhibition is concentrated  to major urban centers, in particular [[Monterrey]], [[Nuevo Léon]], [[Guadalajara]], [[Oaxaca City]] and [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="Zaragoza51"/&gt;

===Art criticism===
[[Octavio Mercado]] said in 2012 that the activity of art criticism still can be found in specialized magazines and nationally disseminated newspapers; furthermore, a new generation of art critics include [[Daniela Wolf]], [[Ana Elena Mallet]], [[Gabriella Gómez-Mont]], and [[Pablo Helguera]].

==Popular arts and handcrafts==
{{Main|Mexican handcrafts and folk art}}
[[File:Our Lady of San Juan de los Lagos votive 1920 1922.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Ex-voto]] painting from the early 1920s honoring Our Lady of [[San Juan de los Lagos]].]]
[[Mexican handcrafts and folk art]], called ''artesanía'' in Mexico, is a complex category of items made by hand or in small workshops for utilitarian, decorative, or other purposes. These include ceramics, wall hangings, certain types of paintings, and textiles.&lt;ref name="mexpopart"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://mexipopulart.org/mexicanpopularart.aspx |title= Mexican Popular Arts |accessdate= 2009-11-28 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100312005022/http://mexipopulart.org/mexicanpopularart.aspx |archivedate= 2010-03-12 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the more formal arts, artesanía has both indigenous and European roots and is considered a valued part of Mexico's ethnic heritage.&lt;ref name="pomar"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/interior/index.php?idNota=4038&amp;p=nota |title=Centenaria presencia de las artesanías |first=Maria Teresa |last=Pomar |date=Nov–Dec 1999 |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=100 years of arts and crafts |accessdate=2009-11-28 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This linking among the arts and cultural identity was most strongly forged by the country's political, intellectual, and artistic elite in the first half of the 20th century, after the Mexican Revolution.&lt;ref name="pomar" /&gt; Artists such as [[Diego Rivera]], [[Rufino Tamayo]], and [[Frida Kahlo]] used artesanía as inspiration for a number of their murals and other works.&lt;ref name="pomar" /&gt; Unlike the fine arts, artesanía is created by common people and those of indigenous heritage, who learn their craft through formal or informal apprenticeship.&lt;ref name="mexpopart" /&gt; The linking of artesanía and Mexican identity continues through television, movies, and tourism promotion.&lt;ref name="iturbe"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Iturbe |first1=Mercedes |editor1-first=Mercedes |editor1-last=Iturbe |title= Folk Art Aesthetics and Poetry in Belleza y Poesía en el arte popular mexicano |year=1996 |publisher= CVS Publicaciones |location= Querétaro,QRO |language=Spanish, English |isbn=968-7377-14-3 |pages=223–234}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the artesanía produced in Mexico consists of ordinary things made for daily use. They are considered artistic because they contain decorative details or are painted in bright colors, or both.&lt;ref name="mexpopart" /&gt; The bold use of colors in crafts and other constructions extends back to pre-Hispanic times. These were joined by other colors introduced by European and Asian contact, always in bold tones.&lt;ref name="aprahamian1112"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |pages=11–12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Design motifs vary from purely indigenous to mostly European with other elements thrown in. Geometric designs connected to Mexico's pre-Hispanic past are prevalent, and items made by the country's remaining purely indigenous communities.&lt;ref name="aprahamian31"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Motifs from nature are popular, possibly more so than geometric patterns in both pre-Hispanic and European designs. They are especially prevalent in wall-hangings and ceramics.&lt;ref name="aprahamian36"&gt;{{cite book |title= Mexican Style:Creative ideas for enhancing your space |last= Aprahamian |first= Peter |year=2000 |publisher= Universe Publishing |location=New York |isbn=978-0-7893-0402-5 |page=36 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the best of Mexico's handcrafts is [[Talavera (pottery)|Talavera pottery]] produced in [[Puebla]].&lt;ref name="dwarren" /&gt; It has a mix of Chinese, Arab, Spanish, and indigenous design influences.&lt;ref name="delpaso"&gt;{{cite book |last1= del Paso |first1=Fernando |editor1-first=Mercedes |editor1-last=Iturbe |title= Form and Color in the Manual Arts of Mexico in Belleza y Poesía en el arte popular mexicano |year=1996 |publisher= CVS Publicaciones |location= Querétaro,QRO |language=Spanish, English |isbn=968-7377-14-3 |pages=245–256}}&lt;/ref&gt; The best known folk paintings are the ''ex-voto'' or ''[[retablo]]'' [[Votive paintings of Mexico|votive paintings]]. These are small commemorative paintings or other artwork created by a believer, honoring the intervention of a saint or other figure. The untrained style of ex-voto painting was appropriated during the mid-20th century by Kahlo, who believed they were the most authentic expression of Latin American art.&lt;ref name="trends1970"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.britannica.com/hispanic_heritage/article-253345 |title=Trends 1970-present |work=Latin American Art |publisher=Britannica |accessdate=November 29, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cinema==
{{Main|Cinema of Mexico}}
[[File:Francisco Villa.gif|right|thumb|Iconic image of [[Pancho Villa]] during the [[Mexican Revolution]], a publicity still taken by Mutual Film Corporation photographer John Davidson Wheelan, January 1914.&lt;ref name="John Mraz 2012, pp. 246-47"&gt;[[John Mraz]], ''Photographing the Mexican Revolution'', Austin: University of Texas Press 2012, pp. 246-47. Inv. #287647. Fondo Casasola. SINAFO-Fototeca Nacional de INAH.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[Cinema in Mexico|Cinematography]] came to Mexico during the [[Mexican Revolution]] from the U.S. and France. It was initially used to document the battles of the war. Revolutionary general [[Pancho Villa]] himself starred in some silent films.  In 2003, [[HBO]] broadcast ''[[And Starring Pancho Villa as Himself]]'', with Antonio Banderas as Villa; the film focuses on the making of the film ''[[The Life of General Villa]]''.  Villa consciously used cinema to shape his public image.&lt;ref&gt;Deborah Mistron. "The Role of Pancho Villa in the Mexican and American Cinema." ''Studies in Latin American Popular Culture'' 2:1-13 (1983).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first sound film in Mexico was made in 1931, called ''Desde Santa''. The first Mexican film genre appeared between 1920 and 1940, called ''ranchero''.&lt;ref name="truax"&gt;{{cite news |title=El Cine Mexicano Vuelve a Brillar |first=Eileen |last=Truax |newspaper=La Opinion |location=Los Angeles |date=January 29, 2007 |pages=1A, 16A |language=Spanish |trans-title=Mexican Cinema Shines Again }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While [[Golden Age of Mexican cinema|Mexico's Golden Age of Cinema]] is regarded as the 1940s and 1950s, two films from the mid to late 1930s, ''Allá en el Rancho Grande'' (1936) and ''Vamanos con Pancho Villa'' (1935), set the standard of this age thematically, aesthetically, and ideologically. These films featured archetypal star figures and symbols based on broad national mythologies. Some of the mythology according to [[Carlos Monsiváis]], includes the participants in family melodramas, the masculine ''[[charro]]s'' of ranchero films, [[femme fatale]]s (often played by [[María Félix]] and [[Dolores del Río]]), the indigenous peoples of [[Emilio Fernández]]’s films, and [[Cantinflas]]’s ''peladito'' (urban miscreant).&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt;

Settings were often ranches, the battlefields of the Revolution, and [[cabaret]]s. Movies about the Mexican Revolution focused on the initial overthrow of the [[Porfirio Díaz]] government rather than the fighting among the various factions afterwards. They also tended to focus on rural themes as “Mexican”, even though the population was increasingly urban.&lt;ref name="strayer"&gt;Strayer, 2009 p.7-12.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mexico had two advantages in filmmaking during this period. The first was a generation of talented actors and filmmakers. These included actors such as [[María Félix]], [[Jorge Negrete]], [[Pedro Armendáriz]], [[Pedro Infante]], [[Cantinflas]], and directors such as [[Emilio Fernández|Emilio “El Indio” Fernandez]] and cinematographer [[Gabriel Figueroa]]. Many of these starts had success in the United States and at the [[Cannes Film Festival]] .&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="macdonald"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=MacDonald |first1=Christine |year=1994 |title= Cinema renaissance: Mexican films captivate world audiences |journal=Business Mexico |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=60–61 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the corner of La Brea and [[Hollywood Boulevard]], there is a sculpture of four women who represent the four pillars of the cinema industry, one of whom is Mexican actress [[Dolores del Rio]] .&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt; Gabriel Figueroa is known for black-and-white camerawork that is generally stark and expressionist, with simple but sophisticated camera movement.&lt;ref name="roads"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cox |first1=Alex |date=November 1995 |title=Roads to the south: In praise of Mexican cinema |journal=Film Comment |volume=31 |issue=6 |page=26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The second advantage was that Mexico was not heavily involved in the [[Second World War]], and therefore had a greater supply of celluloid for films, then also used for bombs.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

[[File:Bird of Paradise (1932) 1.jpg|thumb|300px|A scene from ''Bird of Paradise'' (1932) with [[Dolores del Río]].]]
In the 1930s, the government became interested in the industry in order to promote cultural and political values. Much of the production during the Golden Age was financed with a mix of public and private money, with the government eventually taking a larger role. In 1942 the Banco Cinematográfico financed almost all of the industry, coming under government control by 1947. This gave the government extensive censorship rights through deciding which projects to finance.&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt; While the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) censored films in many ways in the 1940s and 1950s, it was not as repressive as other Spanish speaking countries, but it played a strong role in how Mexico's government and culture was portrayed.&lt;ref name="strayer" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

The Golden Age ended in the late 1950s, with the 1960s dominated by poorly made imitations of Hollywood westerns and comedies. These films were increasingly shot outdoors and popular films featured stars from [[lucha libre]]. Art and experimental film production in Mexico has its roots in the same period, which began to bear fruit in the 1970s.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; Director [[Paul Leduc (film director)|Paul Leduc]] surfaced in the 1970s, specializing in films without dialogue. His first major success was with ''Reed: Insurgent Mexico'' (1971) followed by a biography of [[Frida Kahlo]] called ''Frida'' (1984). He is the most consistently political of modern Mexican directors. In the 1990s, he filmed ''Latino Bar'' (1991) and ''Dollar Mambo'' (1993). His silent films generally have not had commercial success.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

In the late 20th century the main proponent of Mexican art cinema was Arturo Ripstein Jr.. His career began with a spaghetti Western-like film called ''Tiempo de morir'' in 1965 and who some consider the successor to [[Luis Buñuel]] who worked in Mexico in the 1940s. Some of his classic films include ''El Castillo de la pureza'' (1973), ''Lugar sin limites'' (1977) and ''La reina de la noche'' (1994) exploring topics such as family ties and even homosexuality, dealing in cruelty, irony, and tragedy.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;
State censorship was relatively lax in the 1960s and early 1970s, but came back during the latter 1970s and 1980s, monopolizing production and distribution.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

Another factor was that many Mexican film making facilities were taken over by Hollywood production companies in the 1980s, crowding out local production.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; The quality of films was so diminished that for some of these years,{{which|date=January 2012}} [[Ariel Award|Mexico's Ariel film award]] was suspended for lack of qualifying candidates.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt; Popular filmmaking decreased but the art sector grew, sometimes producing works outside the view of censors such as [[Jorge Fons]]’ 1989 film ''Rojo Amanecer'' on the [[Tlatelolco massacre|1968 Tlatelolco massacre]]. The movie was banned by the government but received support in Mexico and abroad. The film was shown although not widely.{{elucidate|date=January 2012}}&lt;!--Shown where? In Mexico? I thought it was banned. From whom did it receive support?--&gt; It was the beginning of more editorial freedom for filmmakers in Mexico.&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Starting in the 1990s, Mexican cinema began to make a comeback, mostly through co-production with foreign interests. One reason for international interest in Mexican cinema was the wild success of the 1992 film [[Like Water for Chocolate (film)|''Como Agua Para Chocolate'']] (''Like Water for Chocolate'').&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt; In 1993, this film was the largest grossing foreign language film in U.S. history and ran in a total of 34 countries.&lt;ref name="macdonald" /&gt; Since then, Mexican film divided into two genres. Those for a more domestic audience tend to be more personal and more ambiguously political such as ''Pueblo de Madera'', ''La Vida Conjugal'', and ''Angel de fuego''. Those geared for international audiences have more stereotypical Mexican images and include ''Solo con tu Pareja'', ''La Invencion de Cronos'' along with ''Como Agua para Chocolate''.&lt;ref name="macdonald" /&gt;&lt;ref name="roads" /&gt;

Mexico's newest generation of successful directors includes [[Alejandro González Iñárritu]], [[Guillermo del Toro]], and [[Alfonso Cuarón]]. Films include ''[[Children of Men|Cuarón/Children of Men]]'' filmed in England and ''[[Pan's Labyrinth|El Laberinto del Fauno]]'', which was a Mexican/Spanish production. Film professionals in the early 21st century tend to be at least bilingual (Spanish and English) and are better able to participate in the global market for films than their predecessors.&lt;ref name="truax" /&gt;

==Photography in Mexico==
[[File:MetlacBridgeKahlo.JPG|thumb|300px|An image of the Metlac Bridge, taken by [[Guillermo Kahlo]].]]
Photography came to Mexico in the form of [[daguerreotype]] about six months after its discovery, and it spread quickly. It was initially used for portraits of the wealthy (because of its high cost), and for shooting landscapes and pre-Hispanic ruins.&lt;ref name="monroy"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/hitoria-de-la-fotografia-en-mexico.html |title= Historia de la Fotografía en México |first=Rebeca |last=Monroy Nasr |publisher=Mexico Desconocido |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=History of Mexican photography |accessdate=November 30, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Another relatively common type of early photographic portraits were those of recently deceased children, called ''little angels,'' which persisted into the first half of the 20th century. This custom derived from a Catholic tradition of celebrating a dead child's immediate acceptance into heaven, bypassing purgatory. This photography replaced the practice of making drawings and other depictions of them as this was considered a “happy occasion.”&lt;ref name="sleeping"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Marino |first1=Daniela |date=Summer 1997 |title= Prayer for a sleeping child: Iconography of the funeral ritual of little angels in Mexico |journal= The Journal of American Culture |volume=20 |issue=2 |pages=37–49 |doi=10.1111/j.1542-734x.1997.2002_37.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Formal portraits were the most common form of commercial photography through the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

Modern photography in Mexico did not begin as an art form, but rather as documentation, associated with periodicals and government projects. It dates to the [[Porfirio Díaz]] period of rule, or the ''Porfiriato'', from the late 19th century to 1910.&lt;ref name="mexconnect"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexconnect.com/articles/1086-the-legacy-of-agustin-victor-casasola-photographer-1874-1938 |title= The legacy of Agustin Victor Casasola (Photographer 1874–1938) |author=Rita Pomade |date=June 1, 2004 |publisher=Mexconnect |issn= 1028-9089 |accessdate=29 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp7"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.7.&lt;/ref&gt; Porfirian-era photography was heavily inclined toward the presentation of the nation's modernization to the rest of the world, with Mexico City as its cultural showpiece. This image was European-based with some indigenous elements for distinction.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp24"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.24.&lt;/ref&gt;

Stylized images of the indigenous during the Porfirato were principally done by Ybañez y Sora in the [[costumbrista]] painting style, which was popular outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; The most important Porfirian era photographer was [[Guillermo Kahlo]], who worked with associate Hugo Brehme.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; Kahlo established his own studio in the first decade of the 1900s and was hired by businesses and the government to document architecture, interiors, landscapes, and factories.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp35"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kahlo's style reflected the narratives of the period, solely focusing on major constructions and events, and avoiding the common populace.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp37"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.37.&lt;/ref&gt; It avoided subjects that hinted at the political instability of the country at the time, such as [[strike action]]s.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp26"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; One major Kahlo project was the Photographic Inventory of Spanish Colonial Church Architecture in Mexico (1910), which consisted of twenty five albums sponsored by the federal government to document the remaining colonial architecture.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp25"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.25.&lt;/ref&gt; Kahlo's photography was used to link Mexico's past to its progress with political and social power provided in symbols and ideals, as well to link the government's aspirations with its colonial and pre-Hispanic past.{{clarify|date=January 2012}}&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp34"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.34.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Decena trágica.JPG|thumb|300px|A scene from the [[Decena Trágica]], February 1913, from the [[Agustín Casasola]] archives.]]
Another pioneer of Mexican photography was [[Agustín Casasola|Agustín Victor Casasola]]. Like Kahlo, he began his career in the Porfirato, but his career was focused on photography for periodicals. Again like Kahlo, Casasola's work prior to the Mexican Revolution focused on non-controversial photographs, focusing on the lives of the elite. The outbreak of civil war caused Casasola's choice of subject to change. He began to focus not only on portraits of the main protagonists (such as [[Francisco Villa]]) and general battle scenes, but on executions and the dead. He focused on people whose faces showed such expressions as pain, kindness, and resignation.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

His work during this time produced a large collection of photographs, many of which are familiar to Mexicans as they have been widely reprinted and reused, often without credit to Casasola. After the war, Casasola continued to photograph common people, especially migrants to Mexico City during the 1920s and 1930s. His total known archives comprise about half a million images with many of his works archived in the former monastery of San Francisco in [[Pachuca]].&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

Kahlo and Casasola are considered the two most important photographers to develop the medium in Mexico, with Kahlo defining architectural photography and Casasolas establishing photojournalism. Neither man thought of himself as an artist—especially not Casasolas—who thought of himself as a historian in the [[Positivism|Positivist]] tradition, but the photography of both show attention to detail, lighting, and placement of subjects for emotional or dramatic effect.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp1825"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.18-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

For the rest of the 20th century, most photography was connected to documentation. However, artistic trends from both inside and outside the country had an effect. In the 1920s, the dominant photographic style was [[Pictorialism]], in which images had a romantic or dream-like quality due to the use of filters and other techniques. American [[Edward Weston]] broke with this tradition, taking these effects away for more realistic and detailed images.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday"&gt;{{cite news |title= Edward Weston: Pictorialist Pioneer |newspaper=USA Today |date=September 27, 2003 |pages=62–65 s }}&lt;/ref&gt; This caused a split in the photography world between Pictorialists and Realists both inside and outside of Mexico.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;

Weston and his Italian assistant [[Tina Modotti]] were in Mexico from 1923 to 1926, allying themselves with Mexican Realist photographers [[Manuel Álvarez Bravo]] as well as muralists such as [[Gabriel Fernández Ledesma]]. These photographers' political and social aspirations matched those of the muralist movement and the new post-Revolution government.&lt;ref name="mexconnect" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9" /&gt;&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp1718"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.17-18.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mariana Yampolsky]], originally from the U.S., became an important photographer in Mexico.  Photography and other arts shifted to depictions of the country's indigenous heritage and the glorification of the Mexican common people.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp9" /&gt; This was mainly to reject the elitist and heavily European values of the Porfiriato, along with the increasing cultural influence of the United States in favor of an “authentic” and distinct Mexican identity.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp910"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Another was the government's decision to use this imagery, rather than the still-fresh memories of the battles and atrocities of the Revolution to promote itself.&lt;ref name="cuevaswolfp27"&gt;Cuevas-Wolf, 1997 p.27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Centro-fotografico-in-oaxaca-founded-by-toledo.jpg|thumb|[[Centro Fotográfico Álvarez Bravo]] at the [[Institute of Graphic Arts of Oaxaca]].]]

Manuel Alvarez Bravo experimented with abstraction in his photography and formed his own personal style concerned with Mexican rites and customs. He was active from the 1920s until his death in the 1990s. Like other artists of the 20th century, he was concerned with balancing international artistic trends with the expression of Mexican culture and people. His photographic techniques were concerned with transforming the ordinary into the fantastic. From the end of the 1930s to the 1970s his photography developed along with new technologies such as color, using the same themes. In the 1970s, he experimented with female nudes.&lt;ref name="aalonso"&gt;{{cite news |title= Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico en imagenes |first=Alejandro |last=Alonso |newspaper=Reforma |location=Mexico City |date=June 13, 1997 |page=14 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Manuel Alvarez Bravo: Mexico in images }}&lt;/ref&gt;

These post-Revolution photographers influenced the generations after them, but the emphasis remained on documentary journalism, especially for newspapers. For this reason, the focus remained on social issues. This included work by [[Nacho López]] and [[Héctor García Cobos|Hector Garcia]], best known for their photography of the [[Tlatelolco massacre|student uprising of 1968]].&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

During the 1970s, a fusion of various styles retained a social focus.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt; During the same period, institutions were established that dedicated themselves to the promotion of photography and conservation of photographs, such as the Centro de la Imagen, the Fototeca Nacional del [[INAH]], and the publication ''Luna Córnea''.&lt;ref name="grandes"&gt;{{cite news |title= Los 13 grandes de la fotografía mexicana |first=Yanet |last=Aguilar Sosa |url= http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/sociedad/3014.html |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=May 20, 2009 |accessdate=November 30, 2011 |language=Spanish |trans-title=The 13 greats of Mexican photography }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Photography in Mexico from the latter 20th century on remains mostly focused on photojournalism and other kinds of documentary. Francisco Mata de Rosas is considered the most notable photographer in contemporary Mexico mostly working with documentaries.{{according to whom|date=January 2012}} He has published a number of books including ''México Tenochtitlan'' and ''Tepito, Bravo el Barrio''. Eniac Martínez specializes in panoramas. Patricia Aridjis works with social themes, mostly to illustrate books. Gerardo Montiel Klint's work has been described as a “shadowing and dark world”, focusing on the angst and violence of adolescents.&lt;ref name="grandes" /&gt; The most recent generation of photographers work with new and digital technologies. One of these is [[Javier Orozco]] who specializes in interiors.&lt;ref name="monroy" /&gt;

However, purely artistic photography has had an impact. In 2002, a photographic exhibit by Daniela Rossell featured images of Mexican multimillionaires posing in their ostentatious homes, filled with expensive paintings, hunting trophies, crystal chandeliers, gold lamé wallpaper, and household help. The photographs set off a wave of social criticism as well as tabloid gossip.&lt;ref name="rgallop47"&gt;Gallo, 2004 p.47.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mumba Cave''', located near the highly alkaline [[Lake Eyasi]] in northern [[Tanzania]], is a rich archaeological site noted for deposits spanning the transition between the [[Middle Stone Age]] and [[Late Stone Age]] in eastern Africa.&lt;ref name="Pendergast"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prendergast|first1=Mary|last2=Luque|first2=Luis|last3=Domínguez-Rodrigo|first3=Manuel|last4=Diez-Martín|first4=Fernando|last5=Mabulla|first5=Audax|last6=Barba|first6=Rebeca|title=New Excavations at Mumba Rockshelter, Tanzania|journal=Journal of African Archaeology|date=2007|volume=5|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="TEXTBOOK"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Barham|first1=Lawrence|last2=Mitchell|first2=Peter|title=The First Africans: African archaeology from the earliest toolmakers to the most recent foragers|date=2008|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The transitional nature of the site has been attributed to the large presence of its large assemblage of ostrich eggshell beads and more importantly, the abundance of microlith technology. Because these type artifacts were found within the site it has led archaeologists to believe that the site could provide insight into the origins of the modern human behavior.&lt;ref name=Gliganic&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gliganic|first1=Luke|last2=Jacobs|first2=Zenobia|last3=Roberts|first3=Richard|last4=Dominguez-Rodrigo|first4=Manuel|last5=Mabulla|first5=Audax|title=New Ages for Middle and Late Stone Age deposits at Mumba Rockshelter, Tanzania: Optically stimulated luminescence dating of quartz and feldspar grain|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2012|volume=62|pages=533–547|doi=10.1016/j.jhevol.2012.02.004|pmid=22425240}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cave was originally tested by [[Ludwig Kohl-Larsen]] and his wife Margit in their 1934 to 1936 expedition. They found abundant artifacts, rock art, and burials. However, only brief descriptions of these findings were ever published. That being said, work of the Kohl-Larsens has been seen as very accomplished due to their attention to detail, especially when one considers that neither was versed in proper archaeological techniques at the time of excavation.&lt;ref name="Melhman 1"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mehlman|first1=M.J.|title=Mumba-Hohle Revisted: The Relevance of a Forgotten Excavation to Some Current Issues in East African Prehistory|journal=World Archaeology|date=1979|volume=11|issue=1| doi = 10.1080/00438243.1979.9979751|pages=80–94}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site has since been reexamined in an effort to reanalyze and complement the work that has already been done, but the ramifications of improper excavations of the past are still being felt today, specifically in the unreliable collection of C-14 data and confusing stratigraphy.&lt;ref name=Gliganic/&gt;

==The Kohl-Larsen excavation==

In 1938 Margit Kohl-Larsen returned to Mumba Cave in an effort to obtain a more complete understanding of the site. Although her work was considered a great triumph in African archaeology at the time, more recent work at the site has illuminated issues from the excavation. Most of the problems lie with the lack of study of the site’s uncovered artifacts, soil samples, and faunal remains. Additional problems lie in that very little information from the site, most of which is now considered unclear, ended up being published by Ludwig Kohl-Larsen in 1943.&lt;ref name="Melhman 1"/&gt;

Further excavations have revealed that there was a significant disregard for the lithic assemblage at the sites, making it clear that Kohl-Larsen favored large lithics above secondary or tertiary flakes.&lt;ref name="Eren"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Eren|first1=Metin|last2=Diez-Martin|first2=Fernando|last3=Dominguez-Rodrigo|first3=Manuel|title=An empirical test of the relative frequency of bipolar reduction in Beds VI, V, and III at Mumba Rockshelter, Tanzania: implications for the East African Middle to Late Stone Age transition|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2013|volume=40|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2012.08.012|pages=248–256}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It has been calculated that only the largest 2% of the stones were collected. However, this is unsurprising since the presence of microliths was not yet realized as a hallmark of the Late Stone Age.&lt;ref name="Melhman Diss"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Melhman|first1=Michael|title=Later quaternary archaeological sequences in northern Tanzania|date=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; All problems considered, archaeologists such as M.J. Melhman have stated that the importance of the site should not be downplayed.&lt;ref name="Eren"/&gt;

==Site stratigraphy==
 
During the Kohl-Larsen excavation the [[stratigraphy]] and levels of the site were determined within its nine by twelve and a half meters area. Depth of the excavation varies between sources as bedrock has said to have been to be reached between nine and eleven meters. The site was divided into six beds that are now recognized as potentially problematic but still used for reference in present work and reanalysis.&lt;ref name="Melhman 1"/&gt; In later excavations, artifacts from each of the defined beds have been dated using [[radiocarbon dating]] techniques. Unfortunately, it has been difficult to confirm and fully understand the site due to heavily mixed deposits from the Kohl-Larsen excavations, few comparable sites, and lack of data on the past environmental conditions.&lt;ref name="Pendergast"/&gt; Each bed has been C-14 dated; however, some scholars question these dates.&lt;ref name=Gliganic/&gt;

===Bed I===
Bed I is referred to as the surface level of the site. It has been noted to contains remnants of obsidian, ostrich eggshell beads, fireplace wood, pottery sherds, and arrowheads that are similar to those fashioned by the [[Hadza people]].&lt;ref name="Melhman 1"/&gt;

===Bed II===
Artifacts from Bed II have been dated using radiocarbon to 381 ± 91 B.P.&lt;ref name="Pendergast"/&gt; Amongst rockfall debris, this bed contains both human and animals bones, including the bones of turtles and fish, some of which have been carved. Other artifacts include ostrich eggshell beads, pottery, obsidian tools, red [[ochre]].&lt;ref name="Melhman 1"/&gt;

===Bed III===
Bed III contains a particular rich assemblage with the presence of a kitchen midden made of several animal bones and broken pottery. The bed also includes decorated ostrich eggshell beads and pottery. Additionally several human burials found at the site were discovered within this bed.&lt;ref name="Pendergast"/&gt; The ceramic artifacts found in this bed are attributed to a type known as "[[Kansyore Pottery|Kansyore Ware]]", associated with hunter/gatherer peoples. Also found were Neolithic "[[Narosura|Narosura Ware]]" and Iron Age "Lelesu Ware."&lt;ref name=Gliganic/&gt; This bed has an associated radiocarbon date of 844 ± 78 B.P.&lt;ref name="Pendergast"/&gt;

===Bed IV===
This Bed is recognized by archaeologists as sterile containing a large beach deposit. Dates from available material are 21530 ± 320 B.P.&lt;ref name="Pendergast"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Melhman 1"/&gt;

===Bed V===
This bed contains fossilized bone and considerable rockfall debris. Cultural material recovered includes a grinder and the remains of a colored pigment.&lt;ref name="Melhman 1"/&gt; M.J Melhman attributed this bed to what he called the transitional "Mumba Industry" which contains both hallmarks of the Middle and Late Stone Ages. However, after reanalysis of Bed V, several archaeologists have suggested that the assemblages found within are better assigned exclusively to Late Stone Age technology.&lt;ref name=Gliganic/&gt; Radiocarbon dates on artifacts are estimated at 31,070 ± 500 B.P.&lt;ref name="Pendergast"/&gt;

===Bed VI===
Bed VI contains the least amount of bone of all beds of the site, all of which are heavily fossilized. However, there is a large amount of naturally occurring raw materials and associated quartz artifacts.&lt;ref name="Melhman 1"/&gt; Furthermore, stone tools associated with the Sanzako Industry are present within the bed's assemblage. The Sanzako industry includes sided and notched scrapers, as well as are what described as "heavy duty" choppers and bifaces.&lt;ref name=Gliganic/&gt; Radiocarbon dates on available material are from 19820 ± 750 B.P.&lt;ref name="Pendergast"/&gt;

==Lithics==
Recent archaeological experiments have confirmed that bipolar flaking, a form of [[lithic reduction]], was used in the cave. These experiments further suggest that the site contains evidence for a transitional period between the Middle and Late Stone Age. Bipolar flaking is described as a hammer and anvil technique of stone tool production; it is an expedient process that produces significantly smaller flakes. This process has been an area of particular interest at Mumba, since there are a significant number of these smalls flakes between stratigraphic Beds VI to V and then in a plateau from Beds V to III. It is believed that the increase of bipolar reduction is a response to favorable climate change in the area, which lead to increased populations and thus territorial activities near Mumba which required more time.&lt;ref name="Eren"/&gt;

==Faunal remains==
Mumba's geographic location may have been a strong factor in determining the overall appeal of the site to its past inhabitants. Along with the nearby lake, the cave is surrounded by various types of terrain including the [[Serengeti Plains]] to the west, as well as the Mubulu and Yada Highlands to the east. This diversity in environment brings with it an abundance of biodiversity. Presence of tilapia and catfish bones suggests both served as food resources, as well as snails confirmed by the presence of shell [[middens]]. These middens also suggests that Lake Eyasi had once reached to just outside the cave. Additionally, after paying closer attention to the faunal remains, several archaeologists have been able to conclude that the Mumba's past inhabitants took advantage of the terrestrial environment as well. Bones of several animals including baboons, rabbits, warthogs, dik-diks, lizards, and snakes have been found at the site suggesting exploitation of the nearby grassland, and terraces.&lt;ref name="TEXTBOOK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Melhman 1"/&gt;

==Human remains==
Upon the excavation of Bed III the remains of eighteen individuals were discovered between 1934 and 1938. This discovery included twelve males, one female, three children, and two unknown individuals ranging from as young as two up to sixty years of age. Later examination of the available cranial remains revealed that these individuals exhibited [[Negroid]] characteristics. Further analysis, attention to context, and dating of the remains suggest these individuals lived in the time period between the start of the Late Stone Age to the start of the [[Iron Age]] and that they were most likely the makers of the [[Kansyore Pottery]] and ostrich eggshell beads found at the site.&lt;ref name="Melhman Diss"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Brauer1980&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bräuer|first1=Günter|title=Human Skeletal Remains From Mumba Rock Shelter, Northern Tanzania|journal=American Journal of Physical Anthropology|date=1980|volume=52|doi=10.1002/ajpa.1330520110|pages=71–84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contextual significance==
Mumba is recognized for its potential in providing evidence for a gradual change between the Middle Stone Age and Late Stone Age in Africa.&lt;ref name="Pendergast"/&gt; This is an important time period in human evolution, because many scholars believe that between the Middle and Late Stone Age is when the origin of modern human behavior began. Characteristics of modern human behavior include an increase in cognitive ability, evidence for the use of symbolism, and the origin of language.&lt;ref name=McBBrooks&gt;{{cite journal|last1=McBearty|first1=Sally|last2=Brooks|first2=Allison|title=The revolution that wasn't: a new interpretation of the origin of modern behavior|journal=Journal of Human Evolution|date=2000|volume=39|doi=10.1006/jhev.2000.0435|pages=453–563|pmid=11102266}}&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of modern human behavior at the site include the presence of red ochre, the lithic artifacts, the wall art on the caves, and the overwhelming number of ostrich eggshell beads.&lt;ref name="Melhman 1"/&gt; The idea of Mumba Cave being an example of this transition was supported by M.J. Melhman and his formation of what he called the Mumba Industry that was largely based on the artifacts observed in Bed V. Archaeologists, however, still debate the validity of the Mumba Industry today.&lt;ref name=Gliganic/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6092">[[File:Museo miraflores 1.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.7|Interior of the museum]]
The '''Museo Miraflores''' is an archaeological museum in [[Guatemala City]], dedicated to the display of artefacts from the ancient [[Maya civilization|Maya]] city of [[Kaminaljuyu]].&lt;ref&gt;Museo Miraflores (1). Anonymous 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is open from Tuesday through to Sunday.&lt;ref name="REDCAMUS"/&gt;

The museum was founded in 2002.&lt;ref name="Herrera2011"&gt;Herrera 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The museum is located in Zone 11 of Guatemala City, in the southern part of the area once covered by the [[Maya city]] of Kaminaljuyu.&lt;ref name="MuseoMiraflores1"&gt;Museo Miraflores (1).&lt;/ref&gt; It  covers an area of approximately {{convert|1200|m2|sqft}}.&lt;ref name="MuseoMiraflores1"/&gt; Within the grounds of the museum are three preserved mounds.&lt;ref name="MuseoMiraflores1"/&gt;

The modern museum is located in a shopping area outside the city centre.&lt;ref name=lp/&gt; It is privately owned and run by the Fundación Miraflores ("Miraflores Foundation"), a for-profit organisation.&lt;ref name="MuseoMiraflores3"&gt;Museo Miraflores (3).&lt;/ref&gt; The [[museum label|museum is described with labels]] in Spanish and usually English too.&lt;ref name=lp&gt;{{cite web|title=Museo Miraflores|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/guatemala/guatemala-city/sights/museum/museo-miraflores|publisher=Lonely Planet|accessdate=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Facilities==
The entrance hall to the museum has a map of the ancient city set into the floor, overlaid with glass marked with the streets of modern Guatemala City.&lt;ref name="MuseoMiraflores2"&gt;Museo Miraflores (2).&lt;/ref&gt; The museum has a permanent exhibition hall, a temporary exhibition hall and a mezanine with a display of 60 archaeological photographs taken between 1994 and 1996.&lt;ref name="MuseoMiraflores2"/&gt; The museum also has a shop and a cafeteria and is the venue for workshops, conferences and courses.&lt;ref name="REDCAMUS"&gt;REDCAMUS.&lt;/ref&gt;

The mounds within the museum garden are three of twenty-five ancient mounds surviving from Kaminaljuyu that are located on private property.&lt;ref name="Crasborn04p190"&gt;Crasborn et al 2004, p.190.&lt;/ref&gt; They are Structures B-V-3, B-V-4 and B-V-5;&lt;ref name="Crasborn04p190"/&gt; they have been provided with information plaques.&lt;ref&gt;Crasborn et al 2004, p.195.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collection==
{{Maya civilization}}
The collection includes approximately 500 artefacts excavated from Kaminaljuyu.&lt;ref name="MuseoMiraflores1"/&gt; Most of the artefacts were excavated from Kaminaljuyu during the period 1994 to 1996 by the Proyecto Miraflores ("Miraflores Project").&lt;ref name="Torres09"&gt;Torres 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; However, not all the artefacts on display have a local origin, and some have come from further afield in Guatemala, especially from [[pre-Columbian era|pre-Columbian]] sites that had contact with Kaminaljuyu.&lt;ref name="Torres09"/&gt; Among the artefacts in the collection are a mosaic mask consisting of 19 pieces of [[Jade use in Mesoamerica|jade]] of unknown provenance and a sculpted stone atlante column.&lt;ref&gt;Anonymous 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Other collections at the museum include [[Maya textiles|indigenous textiles]] from the [[Guatemalan Highlands]] and monthly displays of modern art.&lt;ref name="Torres09"/&gt;

'''Nwya Devu''' is a high-altitude archaeological site on the [[Tibetan Plateau]] located in the eastern [[Changtang]] region of Tibet. At around {{convert|4600|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level, Nwya Devu is the highest known archaeological site from the [[Paleolithic]] and provides evidence for the earliest known presence of humans at a high-altitude site, at around 40,000-30,000 [[Before Present|BP]].{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1049}}

==Background==
The site was discovered in 2013 during [[Systematic survey|systematic archaeological surveying]] performed by the Tibetan Cultural Relics Conservation Institute and the [[Institute of Vertebrate Paleontology and Paleoanthropology]].{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=3 (Supplementary)}} Nywa Devu lies on the former [[Terrace (geology)#Lacustrine_terraces|lacrustrine terrace]] of Co Ngoin, a nearby freshwater lake to the site's north.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=4 (Supplementary)}}

==Stratigraphy==
Archaeologists identified three [[Stratigraphy (archaeology)|stratigraphic]] layers at the site and excavated around {{convert|170|cm|ft|0|abbr=on}} worth of deposits in depth.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1049}} Layer 1 is [[Luminescence dating|OSL dated]] from around 13,000 to 4,000 [[Before Present|BP]]. Mollusc shells taken from the lowest part of Layer 1 yielded [[Radiocarbon dating#Accelerator mass spectrometry|AMS date]] ranges from around 12,700 to 12,400 BP, which shows concurrence with the OSL dating. Layer 2 is OSL dated from around 25,000 to 18,000 BP and corresponds with the [[Last Glacial Maximum]]. The earliest layer, Layer 3, is OSL dated to around 45,000 to 30,000 BP.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1050}} While artefacts were found outside of Layer 3, the archaeologists who worked the site believe that all of the artefacts come from the assemblage associated with Layer 3.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|pp=1049-1050}}{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} Paleo-environmental evidence suggests that the local climate was milder during the time of Layer 3 when compared against the present.{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}}

==Artefacts==
3,683 lithic artefacts were excavated from the site. The lithic assemblage at Nwya Devu consists primarily of blade cores, flake cores, blades, flakes, chunks, and tools. All of the lithic artefacts at Newa Devu were sourced from black [[slate]] that was locally derived, from nearby Nwya Devu Hill, which lies around {{convert|800|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} east of the site. Blades found at the site were made using a non-[[Levallois technique]], through the use of prismatic cores.{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1050}} Archaeologists believe that Nwya Devu, with access to a good source of raw materials nearby, was likely the site of a lithic tool-making workshop, with a primary focus on creating long knives and scrapers that could be [[Hafting|hafted]].{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} Some of the excavated blades were over {{convert|20|cm|in|0|abbr=on}} in length.{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} The lithic assemblage at Newa Dwvu appears to be unique and not obviously related to any other sites in East Asia.{{sfn|Zhang|Dennell|2018}} It shows some similarities to sites from the Early [[Upper Paleolithic]] in Siberia (Kara Bom) and Mongolia (Tolbor-21).{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=1051}}{{sfn|Zhang|Ha|Wang|Chen|2018|p=4 (Supplementary)}}

'''Polynesians''' are an [[ethnolinguistic group]] of closely related peoples who are native to [[Polynesia]] ([[Polynesian Triangle]]), an expansive region of [[Oceania]] in the [[Pacific Ocean]]. They are part of the larger [[Austronesian peoples|Austronesian]] ethnolinguistic group who trace their [[urheimat]] to [[Southeast Asia]]. They speak the [[Polynesian languages]], a branch of the [[Oceanic languages|Oceanic subfamily]] of the [[Austronesian language family]].

There are an estimated 2 million ethnic Polynesians worldwide, vast majority of whom inhabit independent Polynesian nation states ([[Samoa]], [[Niue]], [[Cook Islands]], [[Tonga]] and [[Tuvalu]]) and form minorities in [[Australia]], [[Chile]] ([[Easter Island]]), [[New Zealand]], [[France]] ([[French Polynesia]] and [[Wallis and Futuna]]), [[United Kingdom]] ([[Pitcairn Islands]]) and the [[United States]] ([[Hawaii]] and [[American Samoa]]).

Polynesians, including [[Samoans]], [[Tongans]], [[Niueans]], [[Cook Islanders|Cook Islands Māori]], [[Tahitians|Tahitian Mā'ohi]], [[Native Hawaiians|Hawaiian Māoli]], [[Marquesas Islands|Marquesans]] and [[Māori people|New Zealand Māori]], are a subset of the [[Austronesian peoples]]. They share the same origins as the indigenous peoples of [[Southeast Asia]] (especially the [[Philippines]], [[Malaysia]] and [[Indonesia]]), [[Madagascar]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} and [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwan]]. This is supported by [[DNA evidence|genetic]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = | first1 = | year = 2005 | title = Mitochondrial DNA Provides a Link between Polynesians and Indigenous Taiwanese | url = | journal = PLoS Biology | volume = 3 | issue = 8| page = e281 | doi = 10.1371/journal.pbio.0030281 }}&lt;/ref&gt; linguistic&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/01/090122141146.htm|title=Pacific People Spread From Taiwan, Language Evolution Study Shows|date=27 January 2009|work=ScienceDaily|accessdate=29 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and archaeological evidences.
 	
The [[Polynesia#History of the Polynesian people|origins of the Polynesian people]] are addressed in the theories regarding human migration into the Pacific, which began about 3,000 years ago.  These are outlined well by Kayser ''et al.'' (2000).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/S0960-9822(00)00734-X| pmid = 11069104| title = Melanesian origin of Polynesian Y chromosomes| journal = Current Biology| volume = 10| issue = 20| pages = 1237–46| year = 2000| last1 = Kayser | first1 = M. | last2 = Brauer | first2 = S. | last3 = Weiss | first3 = G. | last4 = Underhill | first4 = P. | last5 = Roewer | first5 = L. | last6 = Schiefenhövel | first6 = W. | last7 = Stoneking | first7 = M. }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most widely accepted theory is that modern Austronesians originated from migrations out of [[Taiwanese aborigines|Taiwan]] between 3000 and 1000 BC; travelling via the [[Philippines]] and eastern [[Indonesia]] and from the northwest ("[[Bird's Head]]") of [[New Guinea]], on to [[Island Melanesia]] by roughly 1400 BC, reaching the western Polynesian islands right about 900 BC. However, Soares ''et al.'' (2008) have argued for an older pre-[[Holocene]] [[Sundaland]] origin within Island Southeast Asia (ISEA) based on [[mitochondrial DNA]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physorg.com/news130761648.html |title=Climate Change and Postglacial Human Dispersals in Southeast Asia | author=Dr. Martin Richards |publisher=Oxford Journals | accessdate=1 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Analysis by Kayser ''et al.'' (2008) discovered that only 21% of the Polynesian autosomal gene pool is of Melanesian origin, with the rest (79%) being of East Asian origin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kayser | first1 = Manfred | last2 = Lao | first2 = Oscar | last3 = Saar | first3 = Kathrin | last4 = Brauer | first4 = Silke | last5 = Wang | first5 = Xingyu | last6 = Nürnberg | first6 = Peter | last7 = Trent | first7 = Ronald J. | last8 = Stoneking | first8 = Mark | year = 2008 | title = Genome-wide analysis indicates more Asian than Melanesian ancestry of Polynesians | journal = The American Journal of Human Genetics | volume = 82 | issue = 1| pages = 194–198 | doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2007.09.010 | pmid=18179899 | pmc=2253960}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another study by Friedlaender ''et al.'' (2008) also confirmed that Polynesians are closer genetically to [[Micronesian people|Micronesians]], [[Taiwanese Aborigines]], and [[East Asians]], than to [[Melanesians]]. The study concluded that Polynesians moved through Melanesia fairly rapidly, allowing only limited admixture between Austronesians and Melanesians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Friedlaender | first1 = Jonathan S. | last2 = Friedlaender | first2 = Françoise R. | last3 = Reed | first3 = Floyd A. | last4 = Kidd | first4 = Kenneth K. | last5 = Kidd | first5 = Judith R. | last6 = Chambers | first6 = Geoffrey K. | last7 = Lea | first7 = Rodney A. | display-authors = 7 | last8 = et al | year = 2008 | title = The genetic structure of Pacific Islanders | url = | journal = PLoS Genetics | volume = 4 | issue = 1| page = e19 | doi=10.1371/journal.pgen.0040019}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Thus the high frequencies of mtDNA B4a1a1 in the Polynesians are the result of drift and represent the descendants of a few East Asian females who mixed with Papuan males.&lt;ref&gt;Assessing Y-chromosome Variation in the South Pacific Using Newly Detected, By Krista Erin Latham [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wSeSv6qWoroC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=very+few+successful+East+Asian+women+polynesian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mIHbVKjqM8ndPeCEgbAM&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=very%20few%20successful%20East%20Asian%20women%20polynesian&amp;f=false] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150713121627/https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=wSeSv6qWoroC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;dq=very+few+successful+East+Asian+women+polynesian&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=mIHbVKjqM8ndPeCEgbAM&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAA |date=2015-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Polynesian population experienced a [[founder effect]] and genetic drift.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pnas.org/content/95/15/9047.full.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The Islands of Samoa are theorized to have been the gestation point from where which the initial roots of Polynesia patiently formulated over time, religion, philosophy, spirituality, language, Arts, culture and then spread forth through eastern Polynesia through the spreading of Samoa's Religion ([[Polynesian narrative|Aitu]], Kahuna, Tafuna). Through their Polynesian Aitu religion, the worship of animal, human deities and a pantheon of Gods and [[Maui (god)|Demi]]-Gods which would grow exponentially in Eastern Polynesia, with the construction of monolithic Tiki Deities in Tahiti, Rapanui and the spread of the spiritual belief of [[Energy (esotericism)|Mana]]; a Polynesian spiritual life force which governs all living beings. 

The last place to be settled by Polynesians was [[Aotearoa]] (New Zealand) estimated at around 1300AD.

The results of research at the Teouma Lapita site ([[Efate Island]], [[Vanuatu]]) and the Talasiu Lapita site (near [[Nuku'alofa]], [[Tonga]]) published in 2016 supports the [[Taiwanese aborigines|'out of Taiwan']] theory although with the qualification that the migration bypassed [[New Guinea]] and [[Island Melanesia]].  The conclusion from the research published in 2016 is that the initial population of those two sites appears to come directly from [[Taiwan]] or the northern [[Philippines]] and did not mix with the ‘AustraloPapuans’ of [[New Guinea]] and the [[Solomon Islands]].&lt;ref name="Nat16"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Pontus Skoglund, et al.|first=|title= Genomic insights into the peopling of the Southwest Pacific|journal= Nature|date=27 October 2016|volume=538|issue=7626|pages=510–513 |url= http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v538/n7626/full/nature19844.html |accessdate=11 January 2017|doi=10.1038/nature19844|pmid=27698418|pmc=5515717}}&lt;/ref&gt; DNA analysis of modern Polynesians indicates that there has been intermarriage that results in a mixed Asian-Papuan ancestry of some Polynesians.

[[File:PMs Appreciation.gif|framed|Ribbon of the Jamaican Prime Ministers Medal of Appreciation]]
The '''Prime Minister's Medal of Appreciation''' is an award presented by the [[Prime Minister of Jamaica]] to those individuals whom he feels are worthy to be recognized for services to [[Jamaica]] or to those Jamaicans who have excelled in personal achievements outside of Jamaica.

It is not part of the [[Jamaican honours system|Jamaican National Honours system]].  Most recipients will not advance into the Honours system, but a few have been appointed into the Honours system.

==History==
[[Jamaica]] received its independence from the [[United Kingdom]], changing its status from a British [[Crown colony]] to an independent country in the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], on 6 August 1962.  In 1983, The Right Honorable Edwards Seaga, Prime Minister of Jamaica, felt that, during the twenty-first "coming of age" anniversary of independence, a special recognition should be given to Jamaican citizens who had made significant contributions to the Nation, but who had not received any of the National Honours.  A committee was formed of prominent Jamaicans to select recipients with the following criteria:
*Have served their Community and Jamaica with distinction for at least twenty years and who are held in high esteem by their community.
*Have not received any of the National Honours.
*Recipients to be at least thirty-eight years old at the time of selection.

The Prime Minister determined that 1,000 medals would be presented.
Mr. F. A. Douce, the Secretary General of the Orders, Chancery of the Orders of the Societies of Honours, Office of the Prime Minister in Kingston, Jamaica, was commissioned with the design of the Medal.

==Presentations==
The first 1,000 presentations were awarded at the Historic Town Square in [[Spanish Town|Spanish Town, Jamaica]] on Sunday, 18 December 1983.  [[Edward Seaga|Prime Minister Seaga]] personally presented the first 10 medals to the County [[Custos]].  The Custodes then presented the Medals to those in their County who had been selected for the award.

The following areas of service were recognized for the awards:

|}

Since that Sunday, the succeeding Prime Ministers have reserved the privilege of awarding the medal to those Jamaicans who distinguished themselves, usually in the International arena.  Recipients who were personally awarded the medal by the Prime Minister included three Champion Boxers, [[Michael McCallum]] (3 June 1986), [[Lloyd Honeyghan]] (10 November 1985) and [[Trevor Berbick]] (10 April 1986).   Nine other prominent Jamaican was awarded the medal, including Jamaican born actress Marge Sinclair (12 March 1987).  

In 1986, the supply of medals became scarce.  It was recommended by the Prime Minister that a new design for the Medal be found to more accurately reflect the current presentations.  Again, Mr. F. A. Douce, the Secretary General of the Orders, was tasked with the design and production of a new Medal.

The first Medal presentation of the new design was given by Jamaican Prime Minister The Right Honorable [[Michael Norman Manley]] on 27 April 1989 to [[Russell Ralph Fritz]], a Major in [[The Salvation Army]].  It was awarded to Fritz for "Social and Welfare Services Particularly the Handicapped and the Aged" to the people of [[Jamaica]].  This was the first time that Jamaican Prime Minister [[Michael Manley]] had awarded the Medal.  This was also the first time that a non-Jamaican was awarded the Medal, as Russell Fritz is a native [[California]]n, but his wife Jacqueline was a Jamaican Citizen.  At the time of the Medal presentation, Fritz was assigned by the International Salvation Army to the Caribbean Territorial Headquarters stationed in [[Kingston, Jamaica]]. Fritz had also been the Principal of the School for the Blind and Visually Handicapped in Kingston. Fritz had written a number of articles on Jamaica that were published in international magazines and had also produced three [[Jamaica Broadcasting Corporation]] television series. He now lives in San Bernardino, California.

==Design==
The medal is round, 2{{fraction|1|4}} inches in diameter, made of [[nickel]] and plated with [[24-carat]] [[gold]]. It is attached to a ribbon by a small ring, through which larger ring is attached directly to the ribbon.  The statutes state that it can be worn either around the neck or on the left breast.  However, all medals are presented, for both men and women, with a neck ribbon only.

The [[Obverse and reverse|obverse]]s for both the first and second design are the same.  The field has a [[Jamaican flag]]. Encircling the inside rim are the words "The National Flag of Jamaica," with a small pineapple at the bottom separating the wording.

The [[Obverse and reverse|reverse]] of the first design has the Prime Ministers flag in the field with the inscription "Prime Ministers Standard" directly below the flag. Encircling the inside rim are the words "Prime Ministers Medal of Appreciation 1962-6th August-1983."

The reverse of the second design is close to the first design.  It has the Prime Ministers flag in the field with the inscription "Prime Ministers Standard" directly below the flag.  Encircling the inside rim are the words "Prime Ministers Medal of Appreciation."  Replacing the 21st anniversary dates is a raised plate at the bottom where the date of issuance is to be stamped.       
   
Statutes for the current Prime Ministers Medal of Appreciation state that a maximum of 12 medals can be presented each year.

The '''Seljuk stucco figures''' are [[stucco]] ([[plaster]]) figures found in the region of the [[Seljuk Empire]], from its "golden age" between the 11th and 13th centuries. They decorated the inner walls and friezes of Seljuk palaces, together with other ornamented stucco ornaments, concealing the wall behind them. The figures were painted bright-colored and often gilded. They represented royal figures and were symbols of power and authority. 

==Islamic art of Seljuk==
The Seljuks were a [[Turkish people|Turkic]] dynasty of [[Central Asia]]n nomadic origins, who became the new rulers of the eastern Islamic world after defeating the [[Ghaznavids]] in the [[Battle of Dandanaqan]], and the [[Buyid dynasty]]. Following these victories, the Seljuks established themselves as the new patrons of the [[Abbasid Caliphate]] and [[Sunni Islam]]. In only half-a-century, the Seljuks managed to create a vast empire encompassing modern [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], and much of [[Anatolia]]. Under the Seljuks, Iran enjoyed a period of cultural prosperity. Multitudes of architecture and arts were developed during the period, and influenced later artistic developments in the region and the surrounding.{{sfn|Yalman|2001}}

In ceramics, fine motifs were created in underglaze painting, luster decorations, and polychrome painting. Metal objects were decorated with [[inlay]]s of silver and gold. The Seljuks developed many figurative motifs with frequent depiction of animals, men, and women.&lt;ref name="dk"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.davidmus.dk/en/collections/islamic/dynasties/seljuks |title=The Seljuks and their Successors |author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt; |date=2017 |website=THE DAVID COLLECTION  |publisher=THE DAVID COLLECTION  |access-date=November 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; An anthropomorphic representation of figures are not rare at all in the Muslim culture. Whereas iconic image in holy places e.g. mosques are strictly forbidden, in secular places, depiction of figures are common.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt;

==Seljuk palaces==
All the Seljuk palaces are now in ruins. Excavations indicate that these palaces had once been decorated with tiles and with stucco wall [[relief]]s of geometric patterns and figures. In Lashgari Bazar, a ruin of former Ghaznavid period palace, polychrome [[fresco]]es depicting 44 soldiers were found decorating the lower floor of the audience hall. They all have similar round faces and almond-shaped eyes, traditionally associated with the [[Turkish people|Turks]] of Central Asia.{{sfn|Öney|1984|pp=133-5}}  

The stucco figures would have decorated similar royal palaces in the audience hall or the royal court. They were found decorating large palaces of the Seljuk sultans, or smaller royal courts of the local vassals or successors.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt; The stucco figures may be part of larger stucco geometric ornamentation which conceals the base wall behind it. One example of stucco figures in complete form comes from the late 12th century [[Rey, Iran|Rey]], which depicts the enthroned Seljuk Sultan Tughril II (1194) surrounded by his officers. Similar examples were found in [[Bast, Afghanistan]], in [[Samarkand]], and in [[Uzbekistan]].&lt;ref name="kianush"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.artarena.force9.co.uk/seljuks.htm |title=THE SELJUKS 11th - 13th Century |last=Kianush |first=K. |date=1999 |website=IRANSAGA |publisher=Art Arena |access-date=November 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were painted in bright colors of red, blue, black, and gilded with gold. The dark room in the palace where they were placed means that this figure needs to stand out as much as possible.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt;

==Form==
[[File:Persian - Standing Warrior Holding a Sword - Walters 241.jpg|thumb|left|Stucco figures of a warrior discovered in Iran. This is painted with red, blue, black, and gilded with gold.]]
Stucco or plaster is a soft, cement-like water-based material that is easy to carve when dry and [[mold]] when still wet. Its lightness makes it easy to affix to walls. Many 12th-century stucco figures survived in pristine condition because of the preserving dryness of the desert where they were found. Seljuk stucco figures were painted in bright colors of blue (powdered [[lapis lazuli]]), red (powdered [[ruby]]), and black colors, and were gilded with gold.&lt;ref name="metwar"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection/search/451909 |title=Standing Figure with Jeweled Headdress |date=2017 |website=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |access-date=November 10, 2017 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The figures were representations of power. In a royal palace setting, they represent figures related to the power of the empire, e.g. royal guards, royal viziers, courtiers or [[emir|amir]]. Warrior figures were depicted clutching swords. They wear rich colored caftans, trousers, [[tiraz|tiraz bands]] and long boots. Royal figures were depicted wearing crowns. The two figures in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]] in [[New York City|New York]] are wearing crowns, one figure is wearing the winged crown, an ancient symbol of authority which was first recorded in a 3rd century [[Sasanian Empire|Sasanian]] coins. All of the Seljuk stucco figures have round faces with typical high cheekbones and almond-shaped eyes, known as the Turkic moon face, which reflect the indicating the Turkic and Mongol ethnic type.&lt;ref name="dk"/&gt; The stucco figures were usually displayed in a pomp and circumstance setting, enhancing the actual ceremonies that took place in the room where the figures were set.&lt;ref name="metwar"/&gt;

{{Marxism|Variants}}

'''Structural Marxism''' was an approach to [[Marxist philosophy]] based on [[structuralism]], primarily associated with the work of the French philosopher [[Louis Althusser]] and his students. It was influential in France during the 1960s and 1970s, and also came to influence philosophers, political theorists and sociologists outside France during the 1970s. Other proponents of structural Marxism were the [[sociologist]] [[Nicos Poulantzas]] and the [[anthropologist]] [[Maurice Godelier]].  Many of Althusser's students broke with structural Marxism in the late 1960s and 1970s.

==Overview==
Structural Marxism arose in opposition to the [[Marxist humanism|humanistic Marxism]] that dominated many western universities during the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} In contrast to Humanistic Marxism, Althusser stressed that Marxism was a [[science]] that examined objective structures,&lt;ref&gt;Althusser, L. (1971). Lenin and Philosophy. In ''Lenin and Philosophy and Other Essays''. NY: Monthly Review Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and he believed that [[Marxist humanism|humanistic]], [[Historicism#Karl Marx|historistic]] and [[Open Marxism|phenomenological Marxism]], which was based on Marx's early works, was caught in a "pre-scientific humanistic ideology".&lt;ref&gt;Heine Andersen and L. B. Kaspersen (ed.). ''Classical and Modern Social Theory'', Blackwell publishers, Oxford, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

Toward the middle of the 1970s and throughout the 1980s, Marxist theorists began to develop structuralist Marxist accounts of the state, law, and crime. Structuralist Marxism disputes the [[Instrumental Marxism|instrumentalist]] view that the state can be viewed as the direct servant of the capitalist or ruling class. Whereas the instrumentalist position argues that the institutions of the state are under the direct control of those members of the capitalist class in positions of state power, the structuralist perspective takes the position that the institutions of the state must function in such a way as to ensure ongoing viability of capitalism more generally. Another way that Marxists put this is that the institutions of the state must function so as to reproduce capitalist society as a whole. The [[Miliband-Poulantzas debate]] between instrumentalist [[Ralph Miliband]] and structuralist [[Nicos Poulantzas]] characterized the debate between structural and instrumental Marxists.&lt;ref&gt;Poulantzas, N. &amp; Miliband R. (1972). The Problem of the Capitalist State. In R. Blackburn (ed.) Ideology in Social Science: Readings in Critical Social Theory. NY: Pantheon Books, pp. 238–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

Structuralists view the state in a [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]] as taking a specifically capitalist form, not because particular individuals are in powerful positions, but because the state reproduces the logic of capitalist structure in its economic, legal, and political institutions. Hence, from a structuralist perspective one would argue that the institutions of the state (including its legal institutions) function in the long-term interests of capital and capitalism, rather than in the short term interests of members of the capitalist class. Structuralists would thus argue that the state and its institutions have a certain degree of independence from specific elites in the ruling or capitalist class.

==Long- versus short-term class interests==
Structural Marxism posits that the state functions to serve the long-term interests of the [[Bourgeosie|capitalist class]]. Building upon the works of [[Engels]] and [[Lenin]], structural Marxists posit the idea that the state is a mechanism for regulating [[class conflict]], the irreconcilable tension between the [[proletariat]] and the bourgeoisie.&lt;ref name=Lenin&gt;Lenin, V.I. (2004/1917). ''The State and Revolution''. Whitefish, MT: Kessinger Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Offe&gt;Offe, Claus (1974). ''Structural Problems of the Capitalist State: Class Rule and the Political System''. In [[Klaus von Beyme]] (ed.) ''German Political Studies, vol. 1''. Beverly Hills, CA: Sage Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; By regulating these antagonisms rather than eliminating them—which Lenin thought was impossible without violent revolution&lt;ref name=Lenin /&gt;—the state serves to stabilize the capitalist system as a whole and preserve its existence.

Structuralists differentiate between the long-term and short-term interests of the capitalist class in order to describe the necessity of the state to the capitalism system. Short-term interests of the bourgeoisie include policies that affect capital accumulation in the immediate future such as tax breaks, reduced minimum wages, government subsidies, etc. They maintain that when the state is not benefiting the bourgeois class’ short-term interests, it is acting on the behalf of its future interests. Accordingly, when the state seems to act on behalf of the proletariat rather than the bourgeoisie (raising minimum wages, increasing rights of workers’ unions, etc.) it is serving capitalist interests by meeting the demands of workers only enough to prevent an uprising that could threaten the system as a whole. Because the interests of the proletariat and the capitalist classes are counter to one another, the state is necessary to regulate the capitalist system and assure its preservation by forcing capitalists to agree to demands of workers to which they otherwise would not succumb.&lt;ref name=Offe /&gt;

==Criticism==
In a 1971 paper for ''[[Socialist Register]]'', Polish philosopher [[Leszek Kołakowski]]&lt;ref&gt;Kołakowski, Leszek (1971), "[http://www.socialistregister.com/index.php/srv/article/view/5334/2235 Althusser's Marx]". ''Socialist Register'' 1971, pp. 111–28.&lt;/ref&gt; undertook a detailed critique of structural Marxism, arguing that the concept was seriously flawed on three main points:

:I will argue that the whole of Althusser's theory is made up of the following elements : 1. common sense banalities expressed with the help of unnecessarily complicated [[neologisms]]; 2. traditional Marxist concepts that are vague and ambiguous in [[Marx]] himself (or in Engels) and which remain, after Althusser's explanation, exactly as vague and ambiguous as they were before; 3. some striking historical inexactitudes.

Kołakowski further argued that, despite Althusser's claims of scientific rigor, structural Marxism was [[unfalsifiable]] and thus unscientific, and was best understood as a quasi-religious [[ideology]]. In 1980, sociologist Axel van den Berg&lt;ref&gt;Van den Berg, Axel (1980). "Critical Theory: Is There Still Hope?" ''The American Journal of Sociology'', Vol. 86 No. 3 (Nov 1980), pp. 449–478.&lt;/ref&gt; described Kołakowski's critique as "devastating," proving that "Althusser retains the orthodox radical rhetoric by simply severing all connections with verifiable facts."

Similar arguments have been made concerning structural theories  of the capitalist nature of the state. [[Claus Offe]] averred that the class-character of the state could only be observed in an ''ex post'' perspective. In other words, the class character of the state can only be shown after policies are put in place and the outcome is observed. Because of this, he criticizes structural theories which attempt to prove the capitalist character of the state, claiming they do so on an unfounded basis: because outcomes of the state's policies are empirically capitalist, it does not make the State a capitalist enterprise in its nature.&lt;ref name=Offe /&gt;{{rp| 45–46}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1870">The '''Suteans''' were a [[Semitic people]] who lived throughout the [[Levant]] and [[Canaan]] c. 1350 BC, and later also lived in [[Babylonia]].  They are mentioned in eight of the 382 [[Amarna letters]].  Like the [[Habiru]], they traditionally worked as mercenaries. They are listed in documents from the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]] (1395-1075 BC) as being extant in the Assyrian colony city of [[Emar]], in what is now north east [[Syria]]. Together with other [[Semitic peoples]]; the [[Chaldea]]ns and [[Arameans]], they overran swaths of Babylonia c. 1100 BC. They were eventually conquered by [[Assyria]], along with the rest of [[Babylonia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Roux|title=Ancient Iraq|ISBN=978-0140125238}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=June 2012}}

==Amarna letters==
One letter mentioning the Suteans is entitled "Waiting for the Pharaoh's words", from [[Biryawaza]] of [[Damascus|Dimasqu]]-(''Damascus'') to [[pharaoh]]:
{{bquote|I am indeed, together with my troops and [[chariot]]s, together with my brothers, my [[Habiru|'Apiru]] and my Suteans, at the disposition of the [[Pítati|archers]], wheresoever the king, my lord, shall order (me to go).&lt;ref&gt;EA 195 (''EA'' for [[el Amarna]]), lines 24-32. From [[William L. Moran|Moran, William L.]] ''The Amarna Letters.'' Johns Hopkins University Press, 1987, 1992. (softcover, {{ISBN|0-8018-6715-0}})&lt;/ref&gt;}}

This usage is somewhat atypical of the usage of Habiru and external mercenary forces in the Amarna letters, since this letter quotes them as being necessary and beneficial to the efforts of Biryawaza.

The [[Sutean language]] appears to have been [[Semitic languages|Semitic]].

{{refimprove|date=January 2012}}
A '''talking animal''' or '''speaking animal''' is any non-human animal that can produce sounds or gestures resembling those of a [[human language]]. Several species or groups of animals have developed [[animal communication|forms of communication]] which superficially resemble verbal language, however, these are not defined as language because they lack one or more of the defining characteristics, i.e. [[grammar]], [[syntax]], [[Recursion#Recursion in language|recursion]] and [[Displacement (linguistics)|displacement]]. Researchers have been successful in teaching some animals to make gestures similar to [[sign language]]. However, these animals fail to reach one or more of the criteria accepted as defining language.

== Possibility of animal language ==
[[Image:CleverHans.jpg|thumb|[[Clever Hans]] performing]]

The term refers to animals which can imitate (though not necessarily understand) human speech. [[Parrot]]s, for example, repeat things nonsensically through exposure.{{citation needed|reason=This is not necessarily true|date=July 2015}} It is a form of [[anthropomorphism]] to call this human speech, as it has no [[Semantics|semantic grounding]].

Researchers have attempted to teach [[Great ape language|great apes]] (gorillas, chimpanzees, and bonobos) spoken language with poor results as they can only be taught how to say one or a few basic or limited words or phrases or less, and sign language with significantly better results as they can be very creative with various [[sign language|hand signals]] like those of [[deaf|deaf people]].{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}  However, even the best communicating great ape has shown an inability to grasp the idea of syntax and grammar, instead communicating at best at the same level as a [[pidgin]] language in humans.  They are expressive and communicative, but lack the formality that remains unique to human speech.

Modern{{clarify timeframe|date=November 2018}} research shows that the key difference is the animal's lack of asking questions and that formal syntax is merely a superficial detail, however Alex the parrot has been recorded as having asked an existential question.&lt;ref name = "jordania"&gt;{{cite book | title = Who Asked the First Question? The Origins of Human Choral Singing, Intelligence, Language and Speech | last1 = Jordania | first1=Joseph | isbn = 978-99940-31-81-8 |year = 2006 | publisher = Logos | location = Tbilisi| title-link = Who Asked the First Question? }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other differences as well, including poor precision, as shown by Kanzi the bonobo used the lexigram for ''chase'' interchangeably with that for ''get'', though this behavior may not be the same for all animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Kluger, J.|title=Inside the minds of animals|year=2010|publisher=Time}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2008867,00.html | work=Time | first=Jeffrey | last=Kluger | title=Inside the Minds of Animals | date=August 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research supports the idea that the linguistic limitations in animals are due to limited general brainpower (as opposed to lack of a specific module),{{citation needed|date=January 2012}} and that words are created by breaking down sentences into pieces, making grammar more basic than semantics.&lt;ref&gt;Francisco Lacerda: A ecological theory of language acquisition&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reported cases by species ==

=== Birds ===
{{main|Bird vocalisation}} {{main|Talking bird}}

* Research done by Dr. [[Irene Pepperberg]] indicates that parrots are capable of speaking in context and with intentional meaning. One of Pepperberg's parrots, [[Alex (parrot)|Alex]], a [[grey parrot]], demonstrated the ability to assemble words out of letters.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== Dogs ===
{{main|Dog communication}} {{See also|Hundesprechschule Asra}}

An owner hears a dog making a sound that resembles a phrase says the phrase back to the dog, who then repeats the sound and is rewarded with a treat.

* Don, a German pointer born around the beginning of the 20th century, was a dog that was reputed to be able to pronounce a couple of words in German and became a vaudeville sensation as a result. Although most scientists at the time dismissed Don's capabilities, the author [[Jan Bondeson]] puts forward an argument that Don was genuinely capable of limited human speech and criticises the tests that were performed on Don at the time as having serious methodological flaws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=UoaoAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT72&amp;lpg=PT72&amp;dq=Don+Talking+Dog#v=onepage&amp;q=Don+Talking+Dog&amp;f=false|title=Amazing Dogs: A Cabinet of Canine Curiosities|first=Jan|last=Bondeson|date=15 March 2011|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|via=Google Books|isbn=9781445609645}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1959 a German sheepdog by the name of Corinna living in [[Prague]] spontaneously developed a capability for limited human speech.

* The case of a cat that was videotaped speaking purported human words and phrases such as "Oh my dog", "Oh Long John", "[[Oh Long Johnson]]", "Oh Don piano", "Why I eyes ya", and "All the live long day"&lt;ref name="youtube_201203"&gt;{{cite video | url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9LBKVXyrHcw | title=Oh Long Johnson... - talking cat | date=June 11, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; became an [[Internet phenomenon]] in 2006. Footage of this cat, nicknamed Oh Long Johnson from one of the phrases spoken, was featured on ''[[America's Funniest Home Videos]]'' in 1998, and a longer version of the clip (which revealed the animal was reacting to the presence of another cat) was aired in the UK. Clips from this video are prevalent on [[YouTube]]. The cat appeared as a character in "[[Faith Hilling]]", the 226th episode of ''[[South Park]]'', which aired on March 28, 2012.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3122">'''The Book Collector''' is a [[London]] based journal that deals with all aspects of the book.

It is published quarterly and exists in both paper and digital form. It prints independent opinions on subjects ranging from typography to national heritage policy, from medieval libraries to modern first editions. It has run series on Unfamiliar Libraries, Literary and Scientific Autographs, Author Societies, Contemporary Collectors and many other subjects.

== History ==
An earlier series that preceded the Book Collector, was the ''Book Handbook''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Horrox, Reginald, (ed.) | title=Book handbook : an illustrated guide to old and rare books | publication-date=1951 | publisher=Berks | url=http://trove.nla.gov.au/work/13274412 | accessdate=23 November 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
''The Book Collector'' was launched by the novelist [[Ian Fleming]] in the same year, 1952, that he wrote the first [[James Bond]] novel, ''[[Casino Royale (novel)|Casino Royale]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=British Library | title=The pleasures of Bibliophily: Fifty Years of The book Collector: An Anthology | publication-date=2003 | publisher=British Library ; New Castle, Del. : Oak Knoll Press | isbn=978-1-58456-097-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The journal has had only four editors since it was founded. After the death in 1965 of John Hayward, the friend and muse of [[T.S. Eliot]], it was edited for fifty years by [[Nicolas Barker]], sometime publisher and first head of conservation at the [[British Library]]. In 2015 he stepped down and James Fergusson, founding obituaries editor of ''[[The Independent]]'', 1986-2007, took his place.

Essays about book collecting by Geoffrey Keynes in the Book Collector has been published in a compilation volume. &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|author1=Keynes, Geoffrey Sir, 1887-1982| title=To Geoffrey Keynes: articles contributed to "The Book Collector" to commemorate his eighty-fifth birthday|publication-date=1972|work=The Book Collector|isbn=978-0-903482-00-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publication ==
''The Book Collector'' publishes four times a year in March, June, September and December. Each issue consists of 192pp and is sent to subscribers by airmail, where appropriate. Subscribers also have digital access to every issue of ''The Book Collector'', as printed, since its first appearance in 1952 and to its predecessor ''Book Handbook'', which was published in twenty-eight numbers between 1947 and 1951. There is no restriction for libraries and other institutions on the number of digital users. ''The Book Collector'''s website holds its complete archive, indexed.

'''''The Pall Mall Magazine''''' was a monthly [[United Kingdom|British]] [[literary magazine]] published between 1893 and 1914. Begun by [[William Waldorf Astor]] as an offshoot of ''[[The Pall Mall Gazette]]'', the magazine included poetry, short stories, serialized fiction, and general commentaries, along with extensive artwork. It was notable in its time as the first British magazine to "publish illustrations in number and finish comparable to those of American periodicals of the same class"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1914/06/24/100095726.pdf | title = BUYS PALL MALL MAGAZINE.; Hearst Company Acquires Publication that W.W. Astor Started. | author = [unsigned] | date = 1914-06-24 | work = [[The New York Times]] | page = 1 | format = PDF | accessdate  = 2010-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; much of which was in the late [[Pre-Raphaelite]] style. It was often compared to the competing publication ''[[The Strand Magazine]]''; many artists, such as illustrator [[Sidney Paget]] and author [[H. G. Wells]], sold freelance work to both.

During its run, the magazine published many of the most significant artists of the day, including illustrators [[George Morrow (illustrator)|George Morrow]] and [[Edmund Joseph Sullivan]], poets [[Algernon Charles Swinburne]] and [[Rudyard Kipling]], and authors such as [[Julian Osgood Field]], [[Bernard Capes]], [[Charlotte O'Conor Eccles]], [[Jack London]], and [[Joseph Conrad]], whose novel ''[[Typhoon (novel)|Typhoon]]'' was first serialized therein. Among the magazine's editors were [[Douglas Straight]] (1893–1896), [[Lord Frederick Spencer Hamilton]] (1896–1900), [[George Halkett]] (1901–1905) and [[Charles Morley (editor)|Charles Morley]] (1905–1914).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On October 6, 1912, ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported that Waldorf Astor had sold the magazine, "Said to Have Obtained Very Little for It." In 1914, as romantic ideas faded with the onset of the [[World War I|First World War]], ''The Pall Mall Magazine'' merged with ''Nash's Magazine'', controlled by the [[Hearst Corporation]] since 1910, to become ''[[Nash's Pall Mall Magazine]]''. From May 1927, the two magazines were again published separately, but they were re-merged after the September 1929 issue, and finally ceased publication altogether following the issue of September 1937.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Tomás de Bhaldraithe''' (14 December 1916 – 24 April 1996) was an Irish language scholar and [[lexicographer]] born Thomas MacDonagh Waldron in [[Limerick]]. He is best known for his ''English-Irish Dictionary'', published in 1959.

==Biography==
He moved to [[Dublin]] with his family at the age of five. He was named after [[Thomas MacDonagh]] one of the signatories of the [[Proclamation of the Irish Republic]], who had been executed after the [[Easter Rising]] earlier that year. He adopted the use of the [[Irish language]] version of the name in both Irish and English. He received his second level education at [[Belvedere College]] in Dublin.

His stance on standard forms and spellings was supported by [[Éamon de Valera]] despite opposition from traditionalists in the Department of Education, and the work is widely seen as an important benchmark in Irish scholarship.

In 1960 he was appointed professor of modern Irish language and literature in [[University College Dublin]], where he developed an impressive archive of material on Irish dialects. Much of the material in this archive was later used as the basis of [[Niall Ó Dónaill]]'s ''Foclóir Gaeilge-Béarla'', published in 1978, for which he was consulting editor. Also during the 1970s, de Bhaldraithe translated the [[Irish language]] [[diary]] of [[Amhlaoibh Ó Súilleabháin]] into English. It was then published by [[Mercier Press]] as "[[Cín Lae Amhlaoibh|The Diary of an Irish Countryman]]."

The language laboratory which he set up in UCD was the first of its kind in any university in Ireland. His interest in seanchas (folklore) led to his publication of ''Seanchas [[Thomáis Laighléis]]'' in 1977, while his earlier work includes the ground-breaking study of the [[Gaeltacht Cois Fharraige|Cois Fharraige]] dialect (a variety of [[Connacht Irish]]), ''Gaeilge Chois Fharraige: Deilbhíocht''. In later years he worked extensively on the definitive Irish dictionary, [[Foclóir na Nua-Ghaeilge]], which remained unfinished when he died in 1996, but which is still in progress today.

The '''Umariya Elementary School''' is a [[madrassa]] in the Muslim Quarter of [[Jerusalem]]'s [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]]. It is located at the start of the [[Via Dolorosa]], and is adjacent to the [[Convent of the Sisters of Zion]]. Underneath the buildings of the school are remains of the [[Antonia Fortress]].

In 1996, under the orders of the then prime minister, [[Benjamin Netanyahu]], an exit from the [[Western Wall Tunnel]] was opened into the Via Dolorosa underneath the school (specifically, under the school's entrance stairs). This was interpreted by some in the Arabic population as a land-grab, and over the subsequent week, 80 people were killed as a result of riots against the creation of the exit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/548443.stm |title=Mayor halts Temple Mount dig |publisher=BBC |accessdate=5 May 2009 | date=3 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former students at the school include [[Abu Nidal]], the founder of a militant [[Fatah]] breakaway organization.

'''Ute'''&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Givón, T. ''Ute Reference Grammar''. John Benjamins Publishing Company, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  is a dialect of the [[Colorado River Numic language]], spoken by the [[Ute people]]. Speakers primarily live on three reservations: [[Ute Indian Tribe of the Uintah and Ouray Reservation|Uintah-Ouray (or Northern Ute)]] in northeastern Utah, [[Southern Ute Indian Reservation|Southern Ute]] in southwestern [[Colorado]], and [[Ute Mountain Ute Tribe|Ute Mountain]] in southwestern Colorado and southeastern [[Utah]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Ute is part of the [[Numic languages|Numic branch]] of the [[Uto-Aztecan languages|Uto-Aztecan]] language family. 
Other dialects in this [[dialect chain]] are Chemehuevi and Southern Paiute. As of 2010, there were 1,640 speakers combined of all three dialects Colorado River Numic.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ethnologue.com/language/ute|title=Ute-Southern Paiute|work=Ethnologue|access-date=2018-01-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ute's parent language, Colorado River Numic, is classified as a threatened language, although there are tribally-sponsored language revitalization programs for the dialect.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Ute'' as a term was applied to the group by Spanish explorers, being derived from the term ''quasuatas'', used by the Spanish at the time to refer to all tribes north of the Pueblo peoples and up to the Shoshone peoples.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.utefans.net/home/ancient_ute/utetribe.html|title=What is a Ute?|accessdate=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ute people refer to their own language as ''núu-'apaghap&lt;span style="text-decoration: underline;"&gt;i&lt;/span&gt;'' or ''núuchi'', meaning "the people's speech" and "of the people" respectively.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/733750317|title=Ute reference grammar|last=1936-|first=Givón, Talmy,|date=2011|publisher=John Benjamins Pub. Co|year=|isbn=9027202850|location=Amsterdam|pages=|oclc=733750317}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==

===Vowels===
T.Givon (2011) gives the following orthography and phonetic information for Southern Ute. Northern Ute differs from Southern and Central in some lexical and phonological areas.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Southern Ute has five vowels, as well as several allophones, which are not shown in the orthography. Each vowel can be short or long, and vowel length is marked orthographically by doubling the vowel. In Ute, the length of a vowel is often phonemic, and relevant for determining meaning. For example, ''whca-y'', meaning 'wrapping,' versus ''whcáa-y'', meaning 'swirling'.  In some cases, however, the difference between a long and a short vowel is purely phonetic, and does not change word meaning. Ute devoices vowels in certain phonological or grammatical environments, as described in later sections. Devoiced vowels are marked in the orthography by underlining them, or, when the identity of the underlying vowel has been lost, with the letter [h].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Here bold text indicates a practical orthographic representation, while the [[International Phonetic Alphabet|IPA]] representation is included in brackets.
{| class="wikitable" style="text-align: center"
! !! [[Front vowel|front&lt;br /&gt;unrounded]] !! front&lt;br /&gt;rounded !! [[Central vowel|central]] !! [[Back vowel|back&lt;br /&gt;unrounded]] !! back&lt;br /&gt;rounded

| || '''ɵ''' {{IPA|[œ]}} || || ||
|-
! [[Open vowel|Low]] 
| || || '''a''' {{IPA|[ä]}} || ||
|}

==== Allophones ====

* {{IPA|[ɨ]}} is an allophone of '''ʉ'''

* [e] and [æ] are both allophones of '''a'''; the former is used more often by younger speakers, while older speakers use the latter

* [o] is an allophone of '''ɵ'''.

===Consonants===
Southern Ute consonants are given in the table below. As above, orthographic representations are bold and the IPA representations are in brackets. All stops in Ute are voiceless. Thus, '''g''' here does not indicate a [[voiced velar stop]] but rather a [[voiced velar fricative]], similar to ''luego'' in Spanish. Also similar to Spanish is the [[voiced bilabial fricative]] '''v''', as in the Spanish phrase ''la verdad'', in contrast with the voiced labiodental fricative {{IPA|[v]}} which does not appear in Ute. The velar sounds '''k''' and '''g''' have some interesting [[Uvular consonant|uvular]] [[allophones]]: '''k''' becomes either a [[voiceless uvular stop]] {{IPA|[q]}} or a [[voiceless uvular fricative]] {{IPA|[χ]}} when either between two vowels or adjacent to the vowel {{IPA|[o]}};{{clarify|date=April 2013}} likewise '''g''' becomes a voiced uvular fricative {{IPA|[ʁ]}} under the same conditions. Either '''k''' or '''g''' can become a [[voiceless velar fricative]] {{IPA|[x]}} when before a de-voiced word ending.

Note here that [[Coronal consonant|coronals]] are produced as dental sounds rather than the [[Alveolar consonant|alveolar]] sounds used in English.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* '''kh ('''or [x]), is an allophone of '''k''' or '''g'''

* '''gh,''' or {{IPA|[ʁ]}}, is an allophone of '''g'''

=== Syllable Structure ===
[[Syllable|Syllables]] usually follow the CVCV pattern. All words must begin with a consonant, but other syllables may or may not include an onset. When an onset is present, it is usually composed of only one consonant. Words with suffixes like ''-'ni, -'na,'' and ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'wa'', can have a two-consonant onset, though they were historically -''ni-'i, -na-'a,'' and ''-wa-'a'' respectively. These earlier suffix forms did have single-consonant onsets. Most syllables do not have codas, but some codas do appear at word-end, such as in ''pʉi-n'', 'I'm sleeping'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

=== Stress ===
Each Southern Ute word must have one [[Stress (linguistics)|stressed]] vowel. Either the first or second vowel of a word in Ute may be stressed, with the latter situation being the most common. Stress is orthographically marked when it occurs on the first vowel. In compound words, the primary stress is applied to the first stem, and a secondary stress may also occur on a later stem.

Vowel stress is constrastive in pairs such as, ''suwá'', meaning 'almost', and ''súwa'', meaning 'straight out'.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;  Note that the [[Close back unrounded vowel|high back unrounded vowel]] '''ʉ''' often is pronounced as a high central {{IPA|[ɨ]}} when unstressed. Though this change produces some [[minimal pair]]s, it is the destressing, rather than the vowel change, that produces the change in meaning and thus {{IPA|[ɨ]}} is excluded from the orthography.

=== Phonological processes ===
Ute has several phonological processes that affect the realization of underlying phonemes. Below is a representative sample.
* '''a '''changes to [e] or [æ] (usually for younger and older speakers respectively) when near '''y, i, '''or ɵ''', '''such as in ''ɵæ-qar&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;,'' 'yellow', or ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'ura-'æ''y'','' 'is'. Although '''a''' often makes the alternation when directly preceding or following '''y''', '''i''', or '''ɵ''', it does not have to be directly next to one of those phonemes, such as in ''sinaæv&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;'', 'wolf' 
* '''ɵ''' becomes [o] when directly preceding or following [gh], [q], or [qh]—however, '''k''' becomes [q] and [qh] between two '''a'''s or directly prec''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''eding or following [o], so the precise mechanism is unknown. ''qhoqh'', 'bull-snake', is one word where this process occurs 
* '''g''' becomes [gh] when between two '''a'''s or directly preceding or following [o], such as in  ''pagha-'ni,'' 'walking about' 
*  '''w''' is inserted af''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''ter '''g''' and '''k''' if the '''g''' or '''k''' directly follow '''u''', [o], or '''ɵ''', such as in ''tagu-kwa'', 's/he was thirsty'
*  vowels are sometimes devoiced in unstressed word-initial or word-final syllables, or unstressed syllables that begin with a voiceless consonant, nasal consonant, or glide, such as in ''whcaay'', 'swirl'

== Morphology ==
Ute is [[Polysynthetic language|polysynthetic]]. Affixes are mostly [[Suffix|suffixes]], but there are three major types of [[Prefix|prefixes]] for verbs and one for nouns.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Nouns ===
Most nouns in Ute obligatorily have suffixes. Inanimate nouns usually take the suffix -''p&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;''/''-v&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;''. However, this suffix can also sometimes denote animate nouns or body parts. Animate nouns usually take the ''-chi'' suffix, but can also take ''-vi/-pi'' or ''-t&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;/-r&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;''. The consonant pairs p/v and t/r were once allophones, but are no longer predictable; this produces the suffixes separated by a slash. Some older animate nouns have a silent final vowel rather than an explicit suffix. 

-''p&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;'' is also used to derive inanimate nouns from verbs, such as ''piki''-''p&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;'' "rotten thing" from ''piki-'' "be rotten". ''-t&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;/-r&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;'' are used for animate nouns that derive from verbs or possession: thus, ''kaá-mi-t&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;'' "singer" derives from ''kaá-mi&lt;u&gt;ya&lt;/u&gt;'' "sings" and ''piwa-gha-t&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;''  "married person, spouse" derives from ''piwa-n'' "my spouse". 

There are three ways plurality can be marked, and only animate nouns are marked for plurality. ''-u'' is the most common plural suffix, and ''-mu'' is usually used for plural nouns that derive from verbs or possession. These suffixes are placed after the obligatory noun suffix. Finally, some nouns show plurality by [[reduplication]] of the first syllable in combination with the ''-u'' suffix, such as in ''táa-ta'wa-chi-u'' "men" from ''ta'wa-ch&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;.'' In this case, ''-u'' without reduplication would create the dual form: "two men".

=== Verbs ===
Ute verbs can take many suffixes and several prefixes. Negation is marked with both the suffix ''-wa'' and prefix ''ka-''. Alternatively, instead of the prefix, the full form ''kách-'' can appear as a separate word somewhere before the verb being negated.

First syllable reduplication in verbs denotes the [[distributive case]]. Thus, ''táa-p&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;gay-'u'' "[s/he] kicked him (once)" becomes ''t&lt;u&gt;a&lt;/u&gt;-táa-p&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;gay-'u'' "[s/he] kicked him repeatedly".

[[Incorporation (linguistics)|Incorporation]] can take place at the leftmost prefix position to add the meanings of the incorporated word to the verb. For example, ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'apagha-y'' "[s/he] is talking" and ''pia-'apagha-y'' "[s/he] is sweet-talking".

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

Verbs usually take the suffix''-ka'' after the stem when the subject is plural. ''-ka'' can also be realized as ''-qa, -kwa, -kya'', etc. according to the phonological processes above. Many suffixes are used to denote [[Tense–aspect–mood|tense, aspect, and modality]]. Some of the more common of these suffixes include ''-y'' for the present tense, ''-vaa-ni'' for the future, and ''-mi&lt;u&gt;ya&lt;/u&gt;''. for the habitual. Other suffixes include ''-ti, -k&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;,'' and ''-ta'', which mark the causative, [[Benefactive case|benefactive]], and [[Passive voice|passive]] case respectively.

== Syntax ==
Word order in Ute is flexible and determined primarily by discourse pragmatics, although speakers will mostly use SOV order when producing isolated clauses.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Case Marking ===
Ute marks nouns for nominative and oblique case. The former category contains subjects and predicates, and the latter contains objects and genitives. In most cases, the final vowel of the entire noun is devoiced in the nominative case and voiced in the oblique case. For example, "woman" in the nominative is ''mama-ch&lt;u&gt;i&lt;/u&gt;'' and in the oblique is ''mama-chi.'' In some pronouns, the (voiced) suffix ''-y'' is added to mark the oblique case, as in singular "you", which is ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'&lt;s&gt;ú&lt;/s&gt;m&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;'' in the nominative and ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'&lt;s&gt;ú&lt;/s&gt;m&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;-y'' in the oblique.

''&lt;nowiki/&gt;&lt;nowiki/&gt;''

=== Noun Incorporation ===
As described above in morphology, nouns and other words can be incorporated as prefixes of verbs to specify the method of action: for example, ''wii-chi-m t&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;ka-y-aqh'', "s/he eats it with a knife" can incorporate ''wii-chi-m,'' "knife", into the verb ''t&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;ka-y-aqh'', "eats" to produce ''wii-t&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;ka-y-aqh'', "s/he is knife-eating it".

=== Switch Reference ===
[[Switch-reference|Switch reference]] uses the independent pronoun ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'uwas'', "s/he", or ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'um&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;s'', "they", to refer to a previously-introduced subject when there are multiple previously-introduced parties, to indicate that the subject of the current clause is different from the previously-mentioned subject. For example, in ''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'áa-gha máy-kya-p&lt;s&gt;u&lt;/s&gt;gay-k&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;, 'ú-vwaa pagha'ni-p&lt;s&gt;&lt;u&gt;u&lt;/u&gt;&lt;/s&gt;ga '''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'uwas''''', "as they were whispering (amongst themselves), '''he''' paced around there", when the sentence begins, the subject is "they", and the independent pronoun is used when the subject changes to "he", a previously introduced character.

His main temples were in the cities of [[Sippar]] and [[Larsa]]. He was believed to ride through the heavens in his [[sun chariot]] and see all things that happened in the day. He was the enforcer of [[Divine judgment|divine justice]] and was thought to aid those in distress. According to Sumerian mythology, he helped protect [[Dumuzid]] when the ''[[gallu|galla]]'' demons tried to drag him to the Underworld and he appeared to the hero [[Ziusudra]] after the [[Flood myth|Great Flood]]. In the ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', he helps [[Gilgamesh]] defeat the ogre [[Humbaba]].

==Family==
Utu was the twin brother of Inanna,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=182}}{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=36}} the Queen of Heaven, whose domain encompassed a broad variety of different powers.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=108–109}}{{sfn|Pryke|2017|page=36}} In Sumerian texts, Inanna and Utu are shown as extremely close;{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=36–37}} in fact, their relationship frequently borders on [[incest]]uous.{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=36–37}}{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=183}} Utu is usually the son of [[Sin (mythology)|Nanna]], the god of the moon, and his wife, [[Ningal]],{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=182–184}}{{sfn|Mark|2017}} but is sometimes also described as the son of [[Anu|An]] or [[Enlil]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|pages=182–184}}{{sfn|Mark|2017}} His wife was the goddess [[Sherida]], later known in Akkadian as Aya.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}}{{sfn|Holland|2009|page=115}}{{sfn|Mark|2017}} Sherida was a goddess of beauty, fertility, and sexual love,{{sfn|Holland|2009|page=115}} possibly because light was seen as inherently beautiful, or because of the sun's role in promoting agricultural fertility.{{sfn|Holland|2009|page=115}} They were believed to have two offspring: the goddess Kittu, whose name means "Truth", and the god Misharu, whose name means "Justice".{{sfn|Holland|2009|page=115}} By the time of the [[First Babylonian dynasty|Old Babylonian Period]] ({{circa}} 1830 – {{circa}} 1531 BC), Sherida, and consequently Utu, was associated with ''[[nadītu]]'', an order of [[cloister]]ed women who devoted their lives to the gods.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} Utu's charioteer Bunene is sometimes described as his son.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}}{{sfn|Mark|2017}} Bunene was worshipped independently from Utu as a god of justice in [[Sippar]] and [[Uruk]] during the Old Babylonian Period{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}}{{sfn|Mark|2017}} and, in later times, he was also worshipped at [[Assur]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}}{{sfn|Mark|2017}}

==Worship==
Utu was worshipped in Sumer from the very earliest times.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}} The oldest documents mentioning him date to around 3500 BC, during the first stages of Sumerian writing.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} His main temples, which were both known as E-babbar ("White House"), were located in [[Sippar]] and in [[Larsa]].{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}} Utu continued to be venerated until the end of Mesopotamian culture{{sfn|Mark|2017}} and was worshipped for well over 3,000 years.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} Utu's main personality characteristics are his kindness and generosity,{{sfn|Mark|2017}} but, like all other Mesopotamian deities, he was not above refusing a request which inconvenienced him.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} In the [[Hurrian language|Hurro]]-Akkadian bilingual Weidner god list, Utu is equated with the [[Hurrians|Hurrian]] sun-god Šimigi.{{sfn|Simons|2017|page=83}} In the [[Ugarit]]ic trilingual version of the Weidner god list, Šimigi and Utu are both equated with [[Lugalbanda]].{{sfn|Simons|2017|page=86}}

==Iconography==
In Sumerian texts, Utu is described as "bearded" and "long-armed".{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}} In art, he is shown as an old man with a long beard.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} He was believed to emerge from the doors of [[Heaven]] every day at dawn and ride across the sky in his [[Sun chariot|chariot]] before returning to the "interior of heaven" through a set of doors in the far west every evening.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}} Utu's charioteer was named Bunene.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=52}} [[Cylinder seal]]s often show two gods holding the doors open for him as he wields his weapon, the pruning-saw,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}} a double-edged arch-shaped saw with large, jagged teeth, representing his role as the god of justice.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}} Utu's main symbol was the solar disc,{{sfn|Mark|2017}} a circle with four points in each of the cardinal directions and four wavy, diagonal lines emanating from the circle between each point.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} This symbol represented the light, warmth, and power of the sun.{{sfn|Mark|2017}}

==Mythology==
The Sumerians believed that, as he rode through heaven, Utu saw everything that happened in the world.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}}{{sfn|Holland|2009|page=115}} Alongside his sister Inanna, Utu was the enforcer of [[Divine judgement|divine justice]].{{sfn|Pryke|2017|pages=36–37}} At night, Utu was believed to travel through the Underworld as he journeyed to the east in preparation for the sunrise.{{sfn|Holland|2009|page=115}} One Sumerian literary work refers to Utu illuminating the Underworld and dispensing judgement there{{sfn|Horowitz|1998|page=352}} and Shamash Hymn 31 (BWL 126) states that Utu serves as a judge of the dead in the Underworld alongside the ''malku'', ''kusu'', and the [[Anunnaki]].{{sfn|Horowitz|1998|page=352}} On his way through the Underworld, Utu was believed to pass through the garden of the sun-god,{{sfn|Holland|2009|page=115}} which contained trees that bore precious gems as fruit.{{sfn|Holland|2009|page=115}}

Utu was believed to take an active role in human affairs,{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}} and was thought to aid those in distress.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}} In one of his earliest appearances in literature, in the ''Myth of Etana'', written before the conquest of [[Sargon of Akkad]] ({{circa}} 2334–2284 BC), the hero [[Etana]] invokes Utu to help his wife conceive a child.{{sfn|Mark|2017}} In the Sumerian poem ''The Dream of Dumuzid'', Utu intervenes to rescue Inanna's husband [[Dumuzid the Shepherd|Dumuzid]] from the ''[[gallu|galla]]'' demons who are hunting him.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}} In the Sumerian [[flood myth]], Utu emerges after the flood waters begin to subside,{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=98}}{{sfn|Hämmerly-Dupuy|1988|page=56}} causing [[Ziusudra]], the hero of the story, to throw open a window on his boat and fall down prostrate before him.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=98}}{{sfn|Hämmerly-Dupuy|1988|page=56}} Ziusudra sacrifices a sheep and an ox to Utu for delivering him to salvation.{{snf|Kramer|1961|page=98}}{{sfn|Hämmerly-Dupuy|1988|page=56}}

In the [[Sumerian King List]], one of the early kings of [[Uruk]] is described as "the son of Utu"{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}} and Utu seems to have served as a special protector to several of that city's later kings.{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}} In the Sumerian poem of ''Gilgamesh and Huwawa'', the hero [[Gilgamesh]] asks Utu to assist him in his journey to the [[Cedar Forest|Cedar Mountain]].{{sfn|Tigay|2002|page=76}} In this version, Gilgamesh asks Utu's help because Utu is associated with the Cedar Mountain, which is implied to be located in the far east, the land where the sun rises.{{sfn|Tigay|2002|pages=76–77}} Utu is initially reluctant to help,{{sfn|Tigay|2002|page=77}} but, after Gilgamesh explains that he is doing this because he intends to establish his name, because he knows he will eventually die, Utu agrees.{{sfn|Tigay|2002|pages=76–77}} Once Gilgamesh reaches the Cedar Mountain, Utu helps him defeat the ogre [[Humbaba|Huwawa]], who lives there.{{sfn|Tigay|2002|page=77}}

In the standard [[Babylonia]]n ''[[Epic of Gilgamesh]]'', Gilgamesh's plan to visit the Cedar Mountain is still his own idea and he goes to Shamash for aid.{{sfn|Tigay|2002|pages=77–78}} In this version, however, the Cedar Mountain is explicitly stated to be located in the northwest, in [[Lebanon]].{{sfn|Tigay|2002|page=78}} Shamash helps Gilgamesh defeat [[Humbaba]] (the East Semitic name for Huwawa).{{sfn|Black|Green|1992|page=184}}{{sfn|Tigay|2002|pages=77–81}} Jeffrey H. Tigay suggests that Lugalbanda's association with the sun-god in the [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Old Babylonian]] version of the epic strengthened "the impression that at one point in the history of the tradition the sun-god was also invoked as an ancestor".{{sfn|Tigay|2002|pages=76–81}} In the Sumerian version, Gilgamesh's initial quest is to visit the Cedar Mountain and Humbaba is merely an obstacle that Gilgamesh and Enkidu encounter once they have already arrived there,{{sfn|Tigay|2002|pages=77, 79}} but, in the Babylonian version, defeating Humbaba is the initial quest on which the heroes embark.{{sfn|Tigay|2002|page=79}} In a late version of the Gilgamesh story, Shamash becomes the instigator of the quest, the one who instructs Gilgamesh to go slay Humbaba to begin with.{{sfn|Tigay|2002|page=79}} Tigay describes this as the "final and logical development of [Shamash's] role."{{sfn|Tigay|2002|page=79}}

==Later influence==
The authors of the [[Hebrew Bible]] generally attempt to portray the sun in a non-anthropomorphic manner, sometimes using it as a symbol of [[Yahweh]]'s power.{{sfn|van der Toorn|Becking|van der Horst|1999|page=960}} The Hebrew word for "sun", ''šapaš'' or ''šemeš'', is often substituted for euphemisms, such as the word ''or'', meaning "light".{{sfn|van der Toorn|Becking|van der Horst|1999|page=960}} These authors appear to have made a conscious effort to avoid implications of sun worship, even of a Yahwistic variety, at all costs.{{sfn|van der Toorn|Becking|van der Horst|1999|page=960}} However, the [[Woman of the Apocalypse]] in the [[Book of Revelation]], may directly allude to ancient Near Eastern sun goddesses.{{sfn|van der Toorn|Becking|van der Horst|1999|page=960}}

'''Lintel 24''' is the designation given by modern archaeologists to an [[Maya civilization|ancient Maya]] limestone carving from [[Yaxchilan]], in modern [[Chiapas]], [[Mexico]]. The lintel dates to about 725 AD,{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} placing it within the Maya [[Mesoamerican chronology|Late Classic period]]. The text of [[Maya hieroglyphics]] indicates that the scene depicted is a [[Bloodletting in Mesoamerica|bloodletting]] ritual that took place on 5 Eb 15 Mac, 709 AD. The ruler, [[Shield Jaguar]], holds a torch while his consort, [[Lady Xoc]], pulls a rope studded with what are now believed to be [[obsidian]] shards through her tongue in order to conjure a [[vision serpent]].

==Discovery and removal==
Lintel 24 was found in its original context alongside Lintels 25 and 26 in Structure 23 of Yaxchilan. [[Alfred Maudslay]] had the lintel cut from the ceiling of a side entrance in 1882 and shipped to Great Britain where it remains today in the [[British Museum]] of [[London]]. Lintel 25 made the journey in 1883. Lintel 26 was discovered in 1897 by [[Teobert Maler]]. It was removed to the [[Museo Nacional de Antropología e Historia]] in 1964. Structure 23 has since collapsed.

==Inscriptions==
The text consists of two sentences, one relating to Shield Jaguar, the other to his wife.  The first three glyphs record the date and the event, “he is letting blood,” with additional glyphs apparently specifying the particular ritual context.  Shield Jaguar’s name begins at E2b, with a title telling us he was a “4-Katun ahpo”--- that he had lived into his fourth katun, at the time of the event.  His personal name consists of a shield sitting atop a jaguar head.  The name phrase concludes by naming him “the captor of [[Ah-Ahaual]]” and “a blood lord of Yaxchilan.”  
The actions of the woman are recorded in the smaller frame behind Shield Jaguar… The last three glyphs record her name phrase.” &lt;ref&gt;Based on translation in Schele, Linda, and Mary E. Miller.

[[Image:Yaxchilán lintel.jpg|thumb|250px|right|Drawing by [[Désiré Charnay]] (1885)]]The lintel is done in high relief style with the background deeply recessed. All three were apparently commissioned by Lady Xoc for the doorways of Structure 23. The lintels show the elaborate costumes of the king and queen with remarkable detail and with an uncharacteristic lack of abstraction. These lintels are considered by some to be the pinnacle of Mayan Art.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, p. 18, cites [[Sylvanus G. Morley]], who in his ''Ancient Maya'' (1946) considered this to be "the most beautiful example of sculptured stone door lintel."&lt;/ref&gt;  We are able to study the detail of Mayan weaving as depicted in these carvings, and see the pearls woven into the fabric. Subtle differences in the three lintels suggest that the compositions were completed by two or three different artists. Each of the works is signed, indicating that the production of such works was regarded as a highly specialized skill rather than a trade.

==The King==
Shield Jaguar was a central figure in directing the course of Yaxchilan.  Shield Jaguar ascended to power in AD 681 and died in AD 742.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} There are numerous documented references to him on artifacts at the end of Stage V at Yaxchilan. In Lintel 24, he is depicted holding a torch above his first wife, Lady Xoc. The king is wearing his hair back with [[quetzal feathers]] indicating that he will also let blood in this ceremony.  Attached to his head band is what appears to be a representation of the Jester Mask. The jester mask is considered analogous to the glyph for kingship, ajaw, and is named so for the vegetation often depicted coming from the crown of it. Since the rest of the costume is depicted without much abstraction, it is suggested that Maya kings may have literally attached a shrunken head to their head band as a representation of power. He is shown wearing a pectoral with a representation of the sun god depicted.  It is strung from a jade bead necklace that is counterbalanced by a long strand of jade beads and what are probably carved shells going down his back. The artist was careful to show such minute details as the strings that are tied to hold on the wrist cuffs worn by both royals, and the pattern woven on Shield Jaguar’s beautiful cape.

==The Queen==

Lady Xoc is one of the most prominent and probably politically powerful women in the Maya civilization.  Lady Xoc is shown here performing an important royal rite of blood letting. By pulling the rope studded with obsidian shards through her tongue, she causes blood to drip onto paper strips held in a woven basket to be burned as depicted on Lintel 25. Blood scrolls can be seen on her face.  The queen also wears an elaborate headdress. There are flower tassels on the main part of the head band and a mosaic depiction of [[Tlaloc]] sprouting quetzal feathers. Her elaborately carved [[huipil]] is trimmed with fringe and pearls. Her necklace also appears to have a pectoral depiction of the sun god.  It is probably made of shell or jade plaques, as are her wrist cuffs.

==Associated tombs==
Recent excavations have unearthed what is thought to be the tombs of Shield Jaguar and Lady Xoc within Structure 23.  Discovered in association with the female burial attributed to Lady Xoc were 146 prismatic obsidian blades, each with two lateral notches on the edges. These were located in what is known as Element 21 in Room 1 of Structure 23 at Yaxchilan. Due to the association with Lady Xoc’s burial in Room 2, these have been interpreted as being depicted on Lintel 24. The original interpretation of the studded rope was that there were thorns attached, but this new evidence in context has caused the interpretation to shift. We now know that it was a rope studded with obsidian blades used in the ritual, and may have the very physical shards depicted themselves. Lady Xoc’s burial is known as Tomb 3. Shield Jaguar’s remains lay not far, in Room 3. This is referred to as Tomb 2. Elaborate grave goods were found in association with both burials.
