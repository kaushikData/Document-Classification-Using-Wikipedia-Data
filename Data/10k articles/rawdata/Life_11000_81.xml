{{Campaignbox Black Power movement}}
The '''1969 Greensboro uprising''' occurred on and around the campuses of [[James B. Dudley High School]] and [[North Carolina Agricultural and Technical State University]] (A&amp;T) in [[Greensboro, North Carolina]], when, over the course of May 21 to May 25, gunfire was exchanged between student protesters, police and [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]]. One student bystander, Willie Grimes, was killed, although whether he was killed by police or protesters remains unknown.

The uprising was sparked by perceived [[civil rights]] issues at the [[Racial segregation|segregated]] high school, when a popular [[student council]] write-in presidential candidate was denied his [[landslide victory]] allegedly because school officials feared his activism in the [[Black Power]] movement. Starting on the campus of Dudley High School, the uprising spread to A&amp;T campus where students had stood up in support of the Dudley protest. Escalating violence eventually led to armed confrontation and the invasion of the A&amp;T campus by what was described at the time as "the most massive armed assault ever made against an American university".{{sfn|Biondi|2012|p=158}} The uprising ended soon after the National Guard made a sweep of A&amp;T college dormitories, taking hundreds of students into protective custody.

While local officials blamed [[outside agitators]], a report released by the North Carolina State Advisory Committee to the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]] found that James B. Dudley High School had an unjust system and suppressed dissent. They found the National Guard invasion reckless and disproportionate to the actual danger, and criticized local community leaders for failing to help the Dudley High School students when the issues first emerged. They declared it "a sad commentary that the only group in the community who would take the Dudley students seriously were the students at A&amp;T State University."{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=6}}

==James B. Dudley High School==
Before events began to coalesce in the spring of 1969, the students at James B. Dudley High School were already unhappy. They no longer believed that [[desegregation]] of the school system in Greensboro was a possibility.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=9}} Their school was the only school in the district to place restrictions on student attire or forbid students leaving campus for lunch.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=5}} But the catalyst for their uprising was their failure to elect a student council president of their choice.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=5}}{{sfn|Newton|1979}}

Even though he was not permitted on the ballot, the students attempted to place [[honor student]] [[Claude Barnes]] in the office of president as a write-in.{{sfn|Newton|1979}}{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=1}} A senior, Barnes had been politically active in his earlier years at the school, but was feared by school officials, who believed him a militant advocate of Black Power as a member of the Youth for the Unity of Black Society.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=1}}{{sfn|Bluford Library}}{{sfn|Waller|2002|p=49}} Barnes won the election with 600 votes, a landslide compared to the top official candidate who received 200.{{sfn|Bermanzohn|2003|p=90}} But the student body was informed on May 1 that Barnes would not be permitted to run.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=1}}

The students of Dudley High turned for assistance to A&amp;T.{{sfn|Waller|2002|p=49}} In the later 1960s, A&amp;T was a center for the Black Power movement in the South.{{sfn|Biondi|2012|p=157}} They took the Dudley students seriously. On May 2, A&amp;T students attempted to join discussions with school administrators, but their several attempts proved unsuccessful.{{sfn|Bermanzohn|2003|p=90}} {{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=10}}

Angry response of the students began to build, with an increasing number of students boycotting classes, and armed police were seen in the vicinity of the school in [[riot gear]].{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=9}}{{sfn|Chafe|1981|p=185-186}} On May 9, the school superintendent effectively disempowered the school's black principal, sending in a white administrator to try to quell the trouble.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=5}} Students made several attempts during this period to reach a peaceful resolution with school officials, but this administrator did not take a sympathetic or conciliatory approach to the students.

On May 19, events began to reach a head.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=6, 7}} Police were called to deal with [[picketing (protest)|picketing]], and, in the midst of alleged police misconduct, nine students were arrested.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=2-3}} Student response damaged the school and resulted in more student arrests, as well as student injuries.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=3, 6}}

On May 21, during school hours, students again assembled near the school.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=3}} Police were contacted when an official indicated seeing a weapon on one of the students. Efforts by a school administrator to disperse the protesters peaceably failed when some students instead began throwing rocks through the windows of the school. Police brought [[tear gas]] against student protesters, applying it over a larger area than may have been needed for the small percentage of students involved in the protest; in some cases—according to residential bystanders—they pursued and gassed students for blocks even as they attempted to flee.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=9}}{{sfn|Hawkins}} Community members, some of whom were also affected by the tear gas canisters, began throwing rocks at police and cars, while students from Dudley High went again to A&amp;T to appeal for assistance.{{sfn|Bermanzohn|2003|p=90}}{{sfn|Chafe|1981|p=187}}

==North Carolina A&amp;T State University==
Early response to the situation at Dudley had been restricted to members of the {{Not a typo|newly-formed}} black activism group Student Organization for Black Unity, but the events of the day brought attention from the wider campus.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=12}} A&amp;T student activist [[Nelson Johnson]] reported 400 students marching on Dudley High.{{sfn|Bermanzohn|2003|p=90}}

While at first violence was contained to tear gas and rocks, the shooting started shortly thereafter. Johnson claims that the first gunfire was instigated by a carload of young white people who fired onto the A&amp;T campus, prompting the students to defend themselves in kind.{{sfn|Bermanzohn|2003|p=90}} Police report [[sniper]] fire from the dormitories at 10:45&amp;nbsp;p.m.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=11, 12}} Wherever it started, the police began returning fire within two hours, and 150 [[National Guard of the United States|National Guard]] were sent to the scene to keep the peace.{{sfn|Hawkins}} Two students were shot.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=10}} One of them, bystander Willie Grimes, was killed, although whether he was shot by police or protesters remains unknown.{{sfn|Hawkins}}{{sfn|Chafe|1981|p=189}} The 22-year-old Grimes had been walking with a group of friends to a restaurant at around 1:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. when shots came from a passing car.{{sfn|Biondi|2012|p=158}} Whether or not the car was a police vehicle has long been the subject of dispute.{{sfn|Newton|1979}}{{sfn|Bluford Library}}

Grimes' death ignited the campus.{{sfn|Biondi|2012|p=158}} A [[state of emergency]] was declared in Greensboro and 500 more National Guardsmen called in.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=10}} The university was closed down, and a curfew was set for 8p.m. to 5 a.m.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=11}} During the day of May 22, violence continued, as protesters vented their anger on white motorists, overturning cars and attacking at least one of the drivers.{{sfn|Newton|1979}} That evening, in spite of the curfew, shooting resumed{{sfn|Hawkins}} Early in the morning of the 23rd, a shoot-out resulted in the serious injuries of five policemen and two students, which was followed by what was described at the time by one journalist as "the most massive armed assault ever made against an American university", with—according to 2012's ''The Black Revolution on Campus''—the descent upon A&amp;T of 600 National Guardsmen, a tank, a helicopter, an airplane and several armed personnel carriers.{{sfn|Biondi|2012|p=158}} A [[UPI]] reporter wrote that "it looked like war".{{sfn|Biondi|2012|p=159}}

On information suggesting students may be harboring a large number of guns, then-[[Governor of North Carolina|governor]] [[Robert W. Scott]] ordered the invasion of the [[dormitory]] Scott Hall, the centerpoint of the shooting.{{sfn|Newton|1979}} At approximately 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m., supported by [[Smoke grenade|smoke]], [[Malodorant|"nausea"]] and tear gas grenades, the National Guard swept through the dorm, placing the students they found under protective custody and doing tens of thousands worth of dollars in damage.{{sfn|Hawkins}}{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=14}}{{sfn|Biondi|2012|p=159}} Many of the students were packing to evacuate or sleeping at the time of the invasion. Over 300 students from Scott Hall and neighboring dormitories were sent to state prisons, where they were detained through the day. More than 60 bullet holes left their mark on Scott Hall.{{sfn|Newton|1979}} Students alleged that during the sweep, personal items disappeared.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=13}} When the sweep was completed, only three operable firearms had been located.{{sfn|Newton|1979}}

By the 24th, the violence was contained.{{sfn|Hawkins}} The curfew was lifted and the National Guard withdrawn. The uprising was declared over on May 25.

==Aftermath==
Willie Grimes' funeral was attended by 2,000 people, and a marker was erected on campus in his memory.{{sfn|Newton|1979}}{{sfn|Bluford Library}}

Governor Scott stated that the violence had been incited by a group of hard-core militants who had seized on the high school election as a catalyst for furthering their own cause.{{sfn|Chafe|1981|p=191}} On October 3 and 4 of that year, meetings were held to investigate the incident under the direction of the North Carolina State Advisory Committee to the [[United States Commission on Civil Rights]].{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=III}} While local officials continued blaming "outsiders" and "radicals" for the event, the committee found that the "prevailing system" at Dudley was unjust and that the school had suppressed dissent.{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=5, 8, 15}} Criticizing the inaction or ineffective action of school officials and community leaders, they declared it "a sad commentary that the only group in the community who would take the Dudley students seriously were the students at A&amp;T State University."{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=6}} They also condemned the conduct of the National Guard sweep of Scott Hall, which endangered innocent students and seemed out of proportion to the actual risk, writing that "it is difficult to justify the lawlessness and the disorder in which this operation was executed."{{sfn|NC Advisory Committee|1970|p=14}}

In 1979, Jack Elam, Greensboro's mayor during the event, expressed discomfort with the sweep of Scott Hall, but—although he agreed that communication had been poor—declared the committee's report a "joke".{{sfn|Newton|1979}} Johnson, who had been arrested for inciting the Dudley students to riot and who was instrumental in bringing the committee to review the situation, wrote later that the community ignored the Advisory Committee's report.{{sfn|Biondi|2012|p=158, 160}} Additional black policemen were employed by the city, although by 1979 the number of black policemen were still not representative of the proportion of black residents of the area.{{sfn|Newton|1979}}

2008 saw the release of a documentary recounting the event, ''Walls that Bleed''.{{sfn|Rowe|2008}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3004">'''Aba II''' was [[List of Patriarchs of the Church of the East|Patriarch of the Church of the East]] from 741 to 751.  He is included in the traditional list of patriarchs of the Church of the East.

== Sources ==
Brief accounts of Aba's reign are given in the ''Ecclesiastical Chronicle'' of the Jacobite writer Bar Hebraeus (''floruit'' 1280) and in the ecclesiastical histories of the Nestorian writers Mari (twelfth-century), {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Amr (fourteenth-century) and Sliba (fourteenth-century).

== Aba's patriarchate ==
The following account of Aba's reign is given by Bar Hebraeus:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
After fulfilling his office for eleven years, he ([[Pethion]]) died in the year 123 of the Arabs [AD 740/1] and was succeeded by Aba Bar Brikh Sebyaneh from Kashkar.  This man was well read in church literature and dialectic, wrote a commentary on Gregory Theologus, and devoted all his time to the reading of books.  Meanwhile the clerics seized the revenues from his school and removed it from the authority of the catholicus.  He took this badly, left Seleucia, and went instead to live in a monastery near Kashkar.  Then the clerics suppressed his proclamation by removing his name from the diptychs, but after he wrote them soothing letters and returned to them they welcomed him back.  During his time, in the year 129 of the Arabs [AD 746], the caliphate of the Arabs came to an end in Palestine and the caliphate of the {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abbasids began in the East.  The {{transl|ar|DIN|ʿ}}Abbasids were fonder of the Christians than the Damascenes had been.  The catholicus Aba, after fulfilling his office for ten years, died at the age of over a hundred and was buried in Seleucia.

'''Aristobulus II'''  ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|r|ᵻ|s|t|ə|ˈ|b|j|uː|l|ə|s}}, {{lang-he|אריסטובולוס}}; {{lang-el|Ἀριστόβουλος}} ''Aristóboulos'') was the [[Jewish]] [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] and King of [[Judea]], 66 BC to 63 BC, from the [[Hasmonean]] Dynasty.

==Family==
Aristobulus was the younger son of [[Alexander Jannaeus]], King and High Priest, and [[Alexandra Salome]]. After the death of Alexander in 76 BC, his widow succeeded to the rule of [[Judea]] and installed her elder son [[Hyrcanus II]] as High Priest. When Salome died in 67 BC, Hyrcanus succeeded to the kingship as well. 

Aristobulus shared his late father's views on religion and politics. He entertained designs upon the throne, even during the life of his mother. He courted the nobles and military party by constituting himself the patron of the [[Sadducees]] and bringing their cause before the queen. The many fortresses which the queen placed at the disposal of the Sadducees, ostensibly for their defense against the [[Pharisees]], constituted in reality one of the preparatory moves of Aristobulus for the usurpation of the government. The queen sought to direct his military zeal outside Judea, and sent him (70-69) against [[Ptolemy (son of Mennaeus)|Ptolemy Mennaeus]]; but when the undertaking failed, Aristobulus resumed his political intrigues. He left Jerusalem secretly and betook himself to his friends, who controlled the largest number of fortified places, with the intention of making war against his aged mother. But the queen died at the critical moment, and he immediately turned his weapons against his brother Hyrcanus, the legitimate heir to the throne.&lt;ref name=je&gt;[http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/1769-aristobulus-ii "Aristobulus II", ''Jewish Encyclopedia'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rebellion==
Hyrcanus seemed to be sympathetic to the [[Sadducees]] just like his father Alexander Jannaeus. Aristobulus rebelled against his elder brother. Because of this conflict, the Pharisees seemed to be in a vulnerable position at this time.&lt;ref&gt;Junghwa Choi, [https://books.google.ca/books?id=mRUdnEVqersC&amp;pg=PA90 ''Jewish Leadership in Roman Palestine from 70 C.E. to 135 C.E.''] BRILL, 2013 {{ISBN|9004245146}} p90&lt;/ref&gt;

Hyrcanus advanced against Aristobulus at the head of his [[mercenaries]] and his followers. The brothers met in battle near [[Jericho]] and many of Hyrcanus' soldiers went over to Aristobulus, and thereby gave the latter the victory. 

Hyrcanus took refuge in the citadel of [[Jerusalem]]; but the capture of the [[Temple of Jerusalem|Temple]] by Aristobulus compelled Hyrcanus to surrender. A peace was then concluded, according to the terms of which Hyrcanus was to renounce the throne and the office of high priest, but was to enjoy the revenues of the latter office.&lt;ref&gt;[[Schürer]], "Gesch." i. 291, note 2&lt;/ref&gt;

This agreement however did not last, as [[Antipater the Idumaean]] convinced Hyrcanus that Aristobulus was planning his death and to take refuge with [[Aretas III]], King of the [[Nabataeans]]. The Nabataeans advanced toward Jerusalem with an army of 50,000 and besieged the city for several months.

==Roman intervention==

During this civil war, the Roman general [[Pompey]] defeated the Kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Pontus|Pontus]] and the [[Seleucid Empire|Seleucids]]. He sent his deputy [[Marcus Aemilius Scaurus (praetor 56 BC)|Marcus Aemilius Scaurus]] to take possession of Seleucid Syria.

As the Hasmoneans were allies of the Romans, both brothers appealed to Scaurus, each endeavoring by gifts and promises to win him over to his side. Scaurus, moved by a gift of 400 talents, decided in favor of Aristobulus and ordered Aretas to withdraw his army. During his retreat, the Nabateans suffered a crushing defeat at the hands of Aristobulus. 

When Pompey arrived in Syria in 63 BC, both brothers and a third party that desired the removal of the entire dynasty, sent their delegates to Pompey, who however delayed the decision. He favoured Hyrcanus II over Aristobulus II, deeming the elder, weaker brother a more reliable ally of the Roman Empire.

Pompey defeated the Jewish armies in multiple battles, and took the fortresses of Judea. Aristobulus and his sons [[Alexander of Judaea|Alexander]] and [[Antigonus II Mattathias|Antigonus]] were captured in 63 BC. Aristobulos, suspicious of Pompey, entrenched himself in the fortress of [[Alexandrium]], but when the Romans defeated his army again, he surrendered and undertook to deliver Jerusalem over to them. However, since many of his followers were unwilling to open the gates, the Romans [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|besieged and captured]] the city by force, badly damaging city and temple. Hyrcanus was restored as High Priest, but deprived of political authority.

Aristobulus II escaped in 57 BC, instigating rebellion against Rome in Judea, until he was finally holed up by [[Aulus Gabinius]], consul of the Roman province of Syria, in [[Machaerus]]. [[Marc Antony]], commander of the cavalry under Gabinius, led several men to scale Aristobulus' fortifications and subdue his forces.&lt;ref&gt;Plutarch "Makers of Rome" p. 272, trans by Ian Scott-Kilvert, Penguin Classics.&lt;/ref&gt;

Taken prisoner, Aristobulus was released by [[Julius Caesar]] in 49 BC in order to turn Judea against Pompey. He was on his way to Judaea with his son [[Alexander of Judaea|Alexander]], when "he was taken off by poison given him by those of Pompey's party".&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, Jewish Wars 1 9:1 (184).&lt;/ref&gt; His son Alexander was beheaded by the Roman commander Scipio at Antioch.&lt;ref&gt;Josephus, Jewish Wars 1 9:2 (185).&lt;/ref&gt;

His son [[Antigonus the Hasmonean|Antigonus]] led a rebellion against Rome, with help from the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], and became king and high priest in 40 BC, but was defeated and killed by the [[Roman Empire|Romans]] in 37 BC.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8380">'''Bioseparation of 1,3-propanediol''' is a biochemical process for production of [[1,3-propanediol]] (PDO). PDO is an [[organic compound]] with many commercial applications. Conventionally, PDO is produced from [[crude oil]] products such as [[propylene]] or [[ethylene oxide]]. In recent years, however, companies such as [[DuPont]] are investing in the biological production of PDO using renewable feedstocks such as [[maize|corn]].&lt;ref name="chem.uu.nl"&gt;http://www.chem.uu.nl/brew/BREWsymposiumWiesbaden11mei2005/WEBSITEBrewPresentations51105.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="azom.com"&gt;http://www.azom.com/News.asp?NewsID=8862&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In May 2004, [[DuPont]] and [[Tate &amp; Lyle]] announced that they would start up a [[joint venture]] to build a facility that produces [[polymers]] from renewable feedstock instead of petrochemicals.&lt;ref name="chem.uu.nl" /&gt; In particular, their goal was to design a [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermentation]] system that converts corn sugar into PDO (propanediol manufactured in this way is referred to in the media as "BioPDO"). They argue that using such a bioprocess is more energy efficient than conventional [[petrochemical]] processes (conversion of [[propylene]] into propanediol) because the bioprocess has four advantages over the conventional process: smaller [[environmental footprint]], lower operating costs, smaller [[Financial capital|capital]] [[investment]], and greater [[sustainability]] due to use of [[renewable]] [[maize|corn]] feedstock.&lt;ref name="chem.uu.nl" /&gt;

==Process==
BioPDO can be made by the bacterial fermentation of [[glycerol]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Microbial production of 1,3-propanediol | author =  H. Biebl | author2 = K. Menzel, A.-P. Zeng and W.-D. Deckwer | journal = Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology | volume = 52 | pages = 289–297 | year = 1999 | pmid = 10531640 | doi = 10.1007/s002530051523 | issue = 3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, DuPont has managed to engineer a strain of ''[[Escherichia coli]]'' (''E. coli''),&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"&gt;{{cite patent | country = WO | number = 2004101479 | title = Purification of Biologically-Produced 1,3-Propanediol | inventor = Adkesson, D.M.; Alsop, A.W. ; Ames, T.T. ; Chu, L.A.; Disney, J.M. ; Dravis, B.C. ; Fitzgibbon, P.; Gaddy, J.M. ; Gallagher, F.G. ; Lehnhardt, W.F. ; Lievense, J.C. ; Luyben, M.L. ; Seapan, M.; Trotter, R.E. ; Wenndt, G.M. ; Yu, E.K. | assign1 = Du Pont | gdate = 2004-11-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; a common bacterium, to allow industrial-scale production of 1,3-propanediol by  fermentation of [[glucose]]. After the ''E. coli'' produce sufficient BioPDO product, DuPont uses a method to separate the BioPDO from the cellular broth that comes out of the [[bioreactor]] consisting of four steps: [[microfiltration]] and [[ultrafiltration]], [[ion exchange]], [[flash evaporation]], and [[distillation]].&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt;

===Filtration===
The first of the two filtration steps, microfiltration, is used to remove the cells from the reactor broth. Ceramic filters are used because, although expensive, they can last for five to ten years.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; High temperatures have been found to increase the flux of liquid across the microfiltration membrane, so a minimum temperature of {{convert|165|F}} is specified.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; A series of three ultrafiltration membranes are used to filter out [[protein]]s with a [[molecular weight]] of 5,000 [[Dalton (unit)|Daltons]] and higher. The feed pressure to the microfiltration membrane is typically 65 psia with a transmembrane pressure drop of 40 psia.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; The feed pressure to each ultrafiltration membrane is 60 psia.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; Using these feed pressures and temperatures, typical transmembrane liquid fluxes are 108 LMH (liters per hour per square meter) for the microfiltration membrane, and 26 LMH for the ultrafiltration membrane.

===Ion exchange===
The next step of the scheme, ion exchange, removes impurities that cause the downstream polymer product to turn yellow.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; Four ion exchange columns in series are used to remove these impurities, and they are arranged in the following order:&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt;
# Strong acid cationic exchanger
# Strong base anionic exchanger
# Strong acid cationic exchanger
# Strong base anionic exchanger

The first cationic exchanger replaces the [[divalent]] [[cations]] in solution with [[hydrogen ions]].&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; The first anionic exchanger replaces the [[anions]] in solution with [[hydroxide|hydroxide ions]].&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; The second cationic and anionic exchangers further reduce ion levels in solution. Note that hydrogen ions (H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; spontaneously react with hydroxide ions (OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;) to form water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O):

:H&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; + OH&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

===Flash evaporation===
After the ion exchange step, excess water is produced from the hydrogen and hydroxide ions, and that can dilute the product to less than 10% concentration by weight.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; By sending the dilute solution to an evaporation system under vacuum, water will flash out of the solution into low-pressure steam, leaving a propanediol solution with up to 80% propanediol by weight.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; The low-pressure steam is then compressed to a higher pressure and temperature, and afterward directed to the outer casing of the flash evaporation unit to heat the system.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt;

===Distillation===
The final step of the scheme, distillation, comprises two distillation columns, and optionally four distillation columns.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; The three main types of chemicals in the fluid at this stage of the separation are water, BioPDO, and impurities such as glycerol, sugars, and proteins. Of the three chemicals water has the lowest boiling point (see the [[water]], [[1,3-propanediol]], and [[glycerol]] articles for boiling point information), so it is removed as distillate in the first column. The bottoms of the first column is then sent to a second column, where BioPDO is removed as distillate because of its lower boiling point.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; Both columns operate under low pressure (55&amp;nbsp;mm Hg in the first column; 20&amp;nbsp;mm Hg in the second column) to lower the boiling points of the distillate and bottoms streams, thereby using a lower pressure steam than that for atmospheric columns.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; At this point, the BioPDO stream has 99% purity.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; If the BioPDO is to be used for polymer production, however, then greater purity is required.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; To achieve greater purity, the BioPDO distillate of the second column is sent to a [[hydrogenation]] reactor to convert the remaining polymer-coloring impurities into non-coloring chemicals.&lt;ref name="Patent WO 2004/101479"/&gt; The effluent of the reactor is then sent to a second set of two distillation columns that operate the same way as the first set of columns. The BioPDO distillate of the fourth distillation column has a purity of 99.97%, which is able to meet polymer- and fiber-grade standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Kurian, Joseph V. | title = A New Polymer Platform for the Future&amp;nbsp;– Sorona from Corn Derived 1,3-Propanediol | journal = Journal of Polymers and the Environment | volume = 13 | issue = 2 | year = 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Energy efficiency of process==
According to DuPont, the BioPDO process uses 40% less energy than conventional processes.&lt;ref name="chem.uu.nl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="azom.com" /&gt; DuPont also claims that the bioprocess reduces greenhouse gas emissions by 20%,&lt;ref name="chem.uu.nl" /&gt;&lt;ref name="azom.com" /&gt; and that the production of one hundred million pounds of BioPDO annually "saves the energy equivalent of fifteen million gallons of gasoline per year".&lt;ref name="azom.com" /&gt; Because of DuPont and Tate &amp; Lyle's success in developing a renewable BioPDO process, the [[American Chemical Society]] awarded the BioPDO research teams the "2007 [[Heroes of Chemistry]]" award.&lt;ref name="azom.com" /&gt;

'''Chekannur P.  K. Mohammed Abul Hassan Maulavi''' (born in 1936)  was a [[progressive Islam]]ic cleric who lived in [[Edappal]], in the [[Malappuram]] district of [[Kerala]], [[India]]. He disappeared on 29 July 1993 and may be dead.

==Biography==
Son of Abdullakutty and Fathima, Maulavi was born in 1936 and studied Islamic theology and Arabic at Baqiyathu Sallihath in Vellor, and at [[Vazhakkad]] Darul Ulloom.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}}

Although he became a religious teacher at the age of 24, his "incompatible" progressive views caused him to leave three teaching assignments in Arabic colleges in Kerala. He began thereafter to spread his own revolutionary ideals,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100925232411/http://nuke.humanrightskerala.com/index.php?name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1497 'early life']&lt;/ref&gt; in which he directly based his interpretation of [[Islam]] on the [[Quran]], paying little attention to conventional wisdom or [[ahadith]]. {{Citation needed|date= August 2018}}

He argued that the Quran alone was true and that many ahadith were written to malign the prophet himself.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}} He rejected those narrated by [[Abu Hurairah]] (who is the most prolific among the [[Biographical evaluation|narrators of hadith]]) which he claimed were corrupt.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}}

His controversial teachings — especially on subjects such as Muslim personal law, women's rights and the proper methods for praying — drew considerable attention and, from religious orthodoxy and extremist fringe groups, disapproval.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}}

He has authored eighteen books including an incomplete Malayalam translation of the Quran.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}} His followers have founded the Khur'aan Sunnath Society to spread his thoughts and ideas.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}}

== Disappearance and investigation ==
Maulavi was last seen on 29 July 1993 when, according to his wife Howah Umma, he left his home to deliver a speech with two unidentified people in a vehicle that did not have a number plate.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}} Following a complaint by his wife and uncle Salim Haji, an investigation was launched that also drew considerable public attention, leading to a reward of Rs 300,000 being offered by police for information related to the case.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}}

The [[Central Bureau of Investigation|CBI]] took over the case in 1996, and in 2000 arrested two members of the ultra orthodox Muslim sect, which is linked to [[Kanthapuram A.P. Aboobacker Musliyar]], under suspicion of murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/2000/12/18/stories/0418211r.htm|title=Moulavi case: CBI closing in on main culprit?|last=|first=|date=|work=|access-date=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180329135405/http://www.thehindu.com/2000/12/18/stories/0418211r.htm|archive-date=29 March 2018|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trial&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2005/07/27/stories/2005072713660400.htm 'Court orders trial of Kanthapuram']&lt;/ref&gt; By 2005, ten people were accused of the murder.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}}

The case was hampered by the disappearance of a number of witnesses, whose property was seized when they fled abroad rather than appear to testify in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newindpress.com/NewsItems.asp?ID=IEX20080329231818 Chekannur Maulavi murder case: CBI court orders confiscation &lt;br&gt;of assets of witnesses - Newindpress.com&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maulavi's wife filed a petition seeking to arraign Kanthapuram Aboobacker Musaliyar as a murder suspect through her lawyer, Advocate S.K. Premraj which was allowed.&lt;ref name=trial/&gt; The Kerala High Court set aside the order, which was challenged in the Supreme Court. Though elaborate arguments were advanced by Advocate S.K. Premraj before the Supreme Court, Kanthapuram who was defended by the legal stalwart Harish Salve ultimately won the legal battle.{{Citation needed|date=March 2010}}

On 30 September 2010, the CBI special court in Kochi sentenced V. V. Hamsa, the first accused in the murder of Chekannur Maulavi, to double life imprisonment and a fine of Rs. 100,000.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}} Stating that the Maulavi case was a rare case, the prosecution had demanded the death sentence. Pronouncing the verdict, Special Court judge S. Vijaykumar said, of the fine amount, that Rs. 50,000 should be given to Maulavi's wife.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}} The other eight accused were acquitted.{{Citation needed|date= August 2018}}

The court found that Maulavi's body was disposed of in some mysterious manner so as never to be recovered.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/news/states/kerala/article804461.ece&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
His life and disappearance are the subject of a documentary, ''Ore Oru Chekannur'', for which filming began in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hindu.com/2009/04/11/stories/2009041152510300.htm Documentary on Chekannur Maulavi ]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cobra-La''' is a fictional civilization created by [[Hasbro]] for the military-themed toyline and TV series [[G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero]]. Introduced to the public in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Movie]]'' and the 1987 series of action figures, Cobra-La was created as a reference to James Hilton's ''[[Lost Horizon]]'', and the name itself is likely a pun on [[Shangri-La]]. It was originally meant as a working name, but Hasbro liked the name so much that it remained.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.joeheadquarters.com/interviews_dixon.shtml G.I. Joe Interview with story editor/writer Buzz Dixon] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160404092712/http://www.joeheadquarters.com/interviews_dixon.shtml |date=2016-04-04 }} Retrieved 2011-06-03.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cobra-La hierarchy==
[[File:Golobulus.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Golobulus as seen in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Movie]]''.]]
* '''Golobulus''' - The [[Genocide|genocidal]] ruler of Cobra-La. Described as the "last of the Serpent Kings", he appears as a large bald humanoid with a legless, serpentine lower body and one of his eyes was either covered or replaced by some form of invertebrate/plant hybrid. Golobulus' right arm and much of his torso are covered with a hard, chitinous armor, similar to that of [[crustacean]]s. His primary form of transportation, a large, organic pod with several tendrils, hides his lower body most of the time. He is voiced by [[Burgess Meredith]] in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Movie]]''.
{{Clear}}

* '''Nemesis Enforcer''' - The commander of the Cobra-La Royal Guards. The towering guardian is [[Speech disorder|mute]], but he is able to make other sounds. His bat-like wings are used for flight, deflection and combat. He also exhibits superhuman strength and [[scythe]]-like blades, continuing on his forearm and protruding above his elbows. Very few men are able to match his strength which makes him a fearsome warrior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Matt Caracappa |title=The Cobra-La G.I. Joe 3-Pack |url=http://www.x-entertainment.com/articles/0716/index.html |date= 29 December 2002 |work= |publisher=X-Entertainment |accessdate=30 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His vocal effects are provided by [[Peter Cullen]] in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Movie]]''.
* '''Pythona''' - A formidable [[femme fatale]] [[Assassination|assassin]] who is rarely seen but is known to be very deadly. She is voiced by [[Jennifer Darling]] in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Movie]]''. Pythona employs a number of different organic weapons of Cobra-La, however her deadliest weapons are the claws at the end of her fingers. She can extend them at will and they drip a toxic fluid that can kill on contact or aid her in cutting through solid material.
* '''Royal Guards''' - The [[arthropod]]-themed foot soldiers of Cobra-La. According to their file card, the Royal Guards were Cobra-La citizens who had living insect bodyparts permanently bonded onto their bodies because their brains were [[Lobotomy|lobotomized]] in order to ensure their complete loyalty to Golobulus.

==Cobra-La biotechnology==
* '''Web of Remembrance''': This is a cloud-like device in Cobra-La that the ruler manipulates into displaying records depicting the history of Cobra-La.
* '''Psychic Motivator''': A chirping [[spider]]-like device used to literally program humans. Doctor Mindbender was programmed with one containing all necessary information, the idea and the will to create [[Serpentor]] after [[Cobra Commander]] was proven to be repeatedly incompetent and had failed one time too many. Seen in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Movie]]'' where Golobulus stated to Doctor Mindbender that his Psychic Motivator was behind Doctor Mindbender's reoccurring dream that involved the creation of Serpentor.
* '''Spore Launcher''': A missile-like device designed to launch a cylindrical, multistage rocket like device used to deploy "The Fungazoids" (See below)
* '''Spore Rocket''': A device launched by the Spore launcher. It is a multistage gas or air powered rocket which contains a payload of the fungazoids.
* '''Fungazoids''': These are spores created by Cobra-La and designed to cause [[brain damage]] to such a degree that any human who is exposed to them would be returned to a very primitive animal-like level of intelligence. They are also mutagenic as well since a small quantity turned [[Cobra Commander]] into a large snake. These were destroyed by the "BET" before they re-entered Earth's atmosphere.
* '''Time [[Worm]]''': A worm that is on a rod which is marked, to function as a timing device. Shown being used by the Cobra-La ruler in regard to the fungazoid spores.
* '''Serpentor's Collar''': This is where Serpentor creates his "Snake spears" from which, if they miss, degenerate into [[cobra]]s which slither away. If they hit, the snake spear kills its victim. One exception was Duke who was hit by one, but he survived after he was briefly in a [[coma]] (an earlier draft for the film would've had Duke killed, but it was scrapped due to the negative reactions of [[Optimus Prime]]'s death in ''[[The Transformers: The Movie]]''){{citation needed|date=November 2016}}. Serpentor grabs the collar, which is a writhing mass of snakes, two at a time, rips one out, straightens the snake into a spear and throws it head first at an enemy.
* '''Path of Esteem''': Stored in a large, flat, golden receptacle, The Path of Esteem serves the same role as a red carpet. When the golden chest is placed on the ground, a large number of red crab like creatures exit, forming a red path for the esteemed to walk upon.
* '''Hand Weapons''': Cobra-La citizens, Pythona in particular, use several unnamed weapons, including a [[starfish]]-like creature which is thrown at targets and then constricts its tentacles. Another is a small, formless, green object that, when squeezed, emits some sort of [[Sleeping gas|knockout gas]], a creature that appears to be an actual [[starfish]] which is thrown like a [[shuriken]], and a creature that seems to be four snakes joined in a cross shape at their center, which is immune or highly resistant to electricity and is capable of chewing through metals. Pythona used a clamshell that generated thin strips which wrapped around opponents. She attacked several Joes in Recon Sleds with [[trilobite]]-looking creatures that exploded, wrecking their vehicles. The Cobra-La royal guards are shown using a single weapon; a large golden [[scimitar]], which is highly curved on one edge, and serrated on the other. Nemesis Enforcer also used a small, hand-held plant that emits a white mist which is capable of causing temporary blindness.
* '''Carno Tree''': These large [[Venus flytrap|Venus' flytrap]]-like plants grow beneath the Cobra-La ice dome, in various parts of the city, particularly around the entrance and the detention area. The trees use long green vines to ensnare would-be escapees or intruders.
* '''Organisms of Cobra-La''': First seen during the second attempt to capture the B.E.T. These creatures came in various land, sea, and aerial forms: Serpent/worms, Arachnids, Mantis, Stick Insect, and larvae.

==Comics==

===G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers===
Cobra-La made their first comics appearance in the ''G.I. Joe vs. the Transformers'' series from [[Devil's Due Publishing]], holders of the G.I. Joe license. They first appeared in the second crossover, springing Cobra scientist [[Doctor Mindbender]] from jail. They would reappear in the fourth crossover "Black Horizon", with a much-expanded back story.

Although the series does not directly reveal their origins, it does reveal the reason for their secrecy. Believed to be the children of an old god who was worshipped by early humans, the creatures found themselves confronted by another creature who was also believed to be a god; [[Unicron]], the Chaos-Bringer, had come to Earth to devour it so he could feed his own hunger. Cobra-La opposed him, threatening to attack him with a metal-devouring organic spore. Before the two sides could annihilate each other, an agreement was reached favoring both parties. The creatures would go into hiding, allowing humanity to develop. Then, when they had reached a sufficient technological level so they could serve as slaves for the Chaos-Bringer's inner workings, the creatures would call Unicron. He would destroy the remainder of humanity and Cobra-La would inherit the human-free world he left behind.

Thousands of years later the pact would be kept, and the creatures, now calling themselves Cobra-La, would summon Unicron via a beacon, using [[Bludgeon (Transformers)|Bludgeon]] and his team of Decepticon mercenaries to kill all interlopers, including Autobots from Cybertron. They also have an unusual captive - [[General Joseph Colton|Joe Colton]], the original G.I. Joe. Here they are also led by Golobulus. They attempted to sacrifice [[Firewall (G.I. Joe)|Firewall]] to Unicron, but they are stopped by an escaped Colton, [[Hawk (G.I. Joe)|Hawk]] and Autobot leader [[Optimus Prime]]. Golobulus attacks Hawk as he attempts to free Firewall, while Colton battles Nemesis Enforcer. Ranting about how he intends to destroy the mechanical Transformers, Golobulus is then crushed by Prime's fist. Pythona has a change of heart and kills the Enforcer. With Unicron defeated by [[Cosmos (Transformers)|Cosmos]] and [[Flint (G.I. Joe)|Flint]], Cobra-La are detained by the rest of G.I. Joe.

===IDW Publishing===
[[The Coil]], Cobra's religious wing, worships a god named Gol Lobulas, a celestial serpent-being who brings order. Gol Lobulas once ruled a great paradise called Cobra-La, but human arrogance and ignorance forced the Serpent underground and ruined humanity with disharmony and individuality. However, champions of the Serpent have arisen to try and reverse this, and Serpentor, the Final Disciple, combines the best traits of all these past warriors. Serpentor, the Final Disciple touched by Gol Lobulas himself, combines all the best traits from these past champions. (In Coil doctrine, the enemies of their deity are philosophers and scientists, and the champions are [[dictator]]s like [[Napoleon]] and [[Genghis Khan]].)&lt;ref&gt;''G.I. Joe: Cobra'' #8&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cartoons==

===G.I. Joe: The Movie===
Little is known of the history of Cobra-La in ''[[G.I. Joe: The Movie]]'', save for the fact that they dominated much of the Earth in the years before the [[Ice Age]]. Their way of life is based on a [[Symbiosis|symbiotic relationship]] with nature: living creatures comprise their machines, vehicles, clothes and more, particularly massive [[Mutant (fictional)|mutant]] insectoids and serpents, from which they are descended. The weakness inherent in this technology, however, soon became apparent when the Ice Age began and destroyed much of what Cobra-La had built. Retreating into a massive cavern beneath the [[Himalayas]], with the intention of emerging to retake the world when the Ice Age had passed, the Cobra-Lavians were shocked to discover that the primitive [[barbarian]]s whom they had left on the surface had managed to survive and flourish, evolving in body and mind and developing inorganic technology, the complete antithesis of Cobra-La.

In order to retake the Earth, Golobulus chooses a nobleman who had been scarred in a laboratory accident (which gave him additional eyes), to go forth from Cobra-La into the human world. This nobleman's mission was to raise an army that would conquer the world, paving the way for the return of Cobra-La. That army was [[Cobra Command|Cobra]], and the nobleman became known as [[Cobra Commander]]. After Cobra Commander's repeated failures in this task, Golobulus sets into motion a plan to replace him. Using a "psychic motivator" to implant information into the brain of Cobra's top scientist [[Doctor Mindbender]], Golobulus has the unwitting scientist genetically engineer the perfect warrior from DNA samples of history's greatest rulers. This creation who is called [[Serpentor]] proceeds to take control of Cobra from Cobra Commander.

Golobulus then sends Pythona to the [[Terror Drome]], to have a private conversation with Serpentor (whom Serpentor had seen in his dreams). Cobra-La guards headed up by Pythona and Nemesis Enforcer then capture Cobra Commander, Serpentor, and all the other Cobra members with them, and take them to their hidden headquarters inside the Himalayas. Golobulus puts Cobra Commander on trial for his repeated failures, and puts Serpentor in his place as a leader of the serpent world to come. Cobra Commander becomes a test subject for special mutating spores, which devolve him into a large snake following his trial. These spores are to be spread around the Earth, in order to de-evolve humanity back "to the level of mindless beasts" (as described by Pythona to Serpentor). Following a large-scale battle between the forces of G.I. Joe versus Cobra and Cobra-La forces, Cobra-La is in ruins and their plan is eventually foiled. Pythona is defeated by [[Jinx (G.I. Joe)|Jinx]], and Nemesis Enforcer meets his doom at the hands of [[Sgt. Slaughter (G.I. Joe)|Sgt. Slaughter]], when they are both thrown into a spike-walled pit, but Golobulus escapes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |date=April 20, 1987 |title=G.I. Joe: The Movie |medium=Motion picture |publisher=De Laurentiis Entertainment Group}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the final battle, Golobulus abandons his pod briefly to make full use of his lower body during combat. According to his commentary for the Shout Factory DVD release of ''G.I. Joe: The Movie'', [[Buzz Dixon]] originally envisioned Golobulus to be a very corpulent figure, which would have made it a surprise when he is able to attack Lt. Falcon with such speed. Also stated that Golobulus was killed in the avalanche off screen. &lt;ref&gt;''G.I. Joe: The Movie'' DVD commentary&lt;/ref&gt;

==Toys==
Golobulus, the Royal Guard, and Nemesis Enforcer were all released as action figures in 1987, in a Cobra-La three-pack. Golobulus is the only G.I. Joe figure that does not have traditional legs, as he has a long snake-like tail. Golobulus' only accessory was a red rifle. Nemesis Enforcer's only accessories were two backpacks, dark gray wings and green tentacles (which is never demonstrated in the movie). The Royal Guard came with a grey handgun, a silver scythe, and a red antenna.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Official 30th Anniversary Salute To G.I. Joe 1964-1994|last= Santelmo|first= Vincent|year= 1994|publisher= Krause Publications|ISBN= 0-87341-301-6|page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nemesis Enforcer was renamed Nemesis Immortal and released in 2008, as part of the 25th Anniversary in a two pack with [[Lt. Falcon]]. He came with a red vest, a red belt, a red backpack, two blue bat wings, a green tentacle backpack, and a black display stand. The figure pack also included an original comic, issue #8 titled ''Lt. Falcon vs. Nemesis Immortal: Showdown at the Top of the World'', which is written by Larry Hama and featuring both characters. The story takes place in the Himalayas, the same location as the Movie. Lt. Falcon carries a wounded Dusty to their extraction site, concerned that Nemesis Immortal is still around. As the story continues, it focuses on Lt. Falcon battling Nemesis Immortal, so that the Joes can escape.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic | writer = Larry Hama | artist = Sheldon Goh | story = Lt. Falcon vs. Nemesis Immortal: Showdown at the Top of the World | title = G.I. Joe: A Real American Hero | volume = | issue = 8 | date = 2008 | publisher = Hasbro | location = | page = | panel = | id = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Nemesis Immortal more closely resembles the movie incarnation of the character than the original Nemesis Enforcer figure, in both design and size.

At the 2012 San Diego Comic-Con, concept art for new figures of Golobulus, Royal Guard, Pythona, and a mutant-snake Cobra Commander appeared in a Hasbro display featuring cancelled toys.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

==Video games==
Golobulus also appeared as one of the "[[Boss (video games)|bosses]]" in the ''[[G.I. Joe (NES)|G.I. Joe]]'' [[video game]] by [[Taxan]] for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]].

Traditionally, the theory of [[retributive justice]] is based on the ideas of [[revenge|retaliation]] ([[punishment]]), which is valuable in itself, and also provides [[Deterrence (legal)|deterrent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Retributive Justice|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-retributive/|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|accessdate=7 September 2017|date=18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before the police, [[Sentence (law)|sentences]] of execution or imprisonment were thought pretty efficient at this, while at the same time removing the threat criminals pose to the public (protection). Alternative sentences add to these goals, trying to reform the offender ([[Rehabilitation (penology)|rehabilitation]]), and put right what he did ([[Reparation (legal)|reparation]]).

Traditionally, [[Victimology|victims of a crime]] only played a small part in the criminal justice process, as this breaching the rules of the society. The [[restorative justice|restorative approach to justice]] approach often makes it a part of a sentence for the offender to apologize, compensate the damage they have caused or repair it with their own labour.

The shift towards alternative sentencing means that some offenders avoid imprisonment with its many unwanted consequences. This is beneficial for the society, as it may prevent them from getting into the so-called [[Recidivism|the revolving door syndrome]], the inability of a person to go back to normal life after leaving a prison, becoming a [[Habitual offender|career criminal]]. Furthermore, there are hopes that this could alleviate [[prison overcrowding]] and reduce the cost of punishment.

Instead of depriving those who commit less dangerous offences (such as [[summary offence]]s) of their freedom, the courts put some limitations on them and give them some duties. The list of components that make up a community sentence is of course different in individual countries, and will be combined individually by the court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Types of Sentences|url=http://www.citizensinformation.ie/en/justice/criminal_law/criminal_trial/types_of_sentences.html|website=Citizens Information|publisher=Citizens Information Board, Ireland|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Non-custodial sentences can include:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Larson|first1=Aaron|title=Sentencing in Criminal Cases - Fines, Probation and Jail|url=https://www.expertlaw.com/library/criminal/sentences.html|website=ExpertLaw|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Alternative Sentencing|journal=ABA Journal|date=1 November 1987|volume=73|issue=13|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s2yX6rsuuJ4C&amp;pg=PA32&amp;lpg=PA32|accessdate=7 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''CryptoKitties''''' is a [[Blockchain game|blockchain]] based [[video game]] developed by Axiom Zen that allows players to purchase, collect, breed and sell various types of virtual cats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Miller |first1=John |title=Animoca Brands one of the ASX top performers in 2018 |url=http://www.proactiveinvestors.com.au/companies/news/190721/animoca-brands-one-of-the-asx-top-performers-in-2018-190721.html |website=Proactive Investors |accessdate=7 October 2018 |date=29 Jan 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It represents one of the earliest attempts to deploy blockchain technology for recreational and leisurely purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3084411 Cryptokitties Analysis Paper] "The Leisures of Blockchains."

==Background==
CryptoKitties is not a [[cryptocurrency]]. Instead it operates on [[Ethereum]]'s underlying blockchain network, as a [[Non-Fungible Tokens|non fungible token (NFT)]] unique to each CryptoKitty. Each CryptoKitty is unique and owned by the user, validated through the blockchain, and its value can appreciate or depreciate based on the market. CryptoKitties cannot be replicated and cannot be transferred without the user's permission even by the game developers. Users can interact with their CryptoKitties, having the ability to buy, sell, and sire (breed) them. A test version of CryptoKitties was unveiled at ETH Waterloo on October 19, 2017, the largest Ethereum [[hackathon]] in the world. As of December 2, 2017, Genesis, the first and highest selling cat was sold for 246.9255 [[Ethereum|ETH]] (~$117,712 USD) on that day.

The virtual cats are breedable and carry a unique number and 256 bit distinct genome with DNA and different attributes (cattributes) that can be passed to offspring.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.cnbc.com/2017/12/06/meet-cryptokitties-the-new-digital-beanie-babies-selling-for-100k.html|title=Meet CryptoKitties, the $100,000 digital beanie babies epitomizing the cryptocurrency mania|last=Cheng|first=Evelyn|date=2017-12-06|work=CNBC|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several traits can be passed down from the parents to the offspring. These include pattern, mouth (shape), fur, eye shape, base color, accent color, highlight color, eye color, and optional wild and environment characteristics. Other features like cool down times are not passed down but are instead a function of the 'generation' of the offspring, which is one higher than the maximum generation between the two parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/12/03/people-have-spent-over-1m-buying-virtual-cats-on-the-ethereum-blockchain/|title=People have spent over $1M buying virtual cats on the Ethereum blockchain|last=Tepper|first=Fitz|work=TechCrunch|access-date=2017-12-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In December 2017 a CryptoKitty sold for $100,000.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

On March 20, 2018, it was announced that ''CryptoKitties'' would be spun off into its own company and raised $12 million from several top venture capital firms and angel investors. The investment round was led by New York based [[Union Square Ventures]] and San Francisco based [[Andreessen Horowitz]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coindesk.com/a16z-leads-12-million-funding-for-ethereum-app-cryptokitties/|title=A16z, USV Lead $12 Million Funding for CryptoKitties - CoinDesk|date=2018-03-20|work=CoinDesk|last=Milano|first=Annaliese|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/03/20/cryptokitties-blockchain-sensation-raises-12-million/|title=CryptoKitties blockchain sensation raises $12 million|date=2018-03-20|work=VentureBeat|last=Takahashi|first=Dean|access-date=2018-03-26|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://medium.com/cryptokitties/cryptokitties-receives-12m-in-funding-38322f90ab65|title=CryptoKitties receives $12M in funding|last=CryptoKitties|date=2018-03-20|website=CryptoKitties|access-date=2018-03-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2018, ''CryptoKitties'' launched their first celebrity-branded CryptoKitty with [[Stephen Curry]], an American professional basketball player.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.coindesk.com/nba-superstar-steph-curry-now-first-celebrity-cryptokitty/|title=NBA Superstar Steph Curry Is Now the First Celebrity CryptoKitty - CoinDesk|date=2018-05-07|work=CoinDesk|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the partnership, Curry was given three CryptoKitties with special imagery, the first of which he put up for auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/07/warriors-steph-curry-will-auction-off-celebrity-cryptokitties/|title=Warriors’ Steph Curry will auction off celebrity CryptoKitties|date=2018-05-07|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-05-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company later suspended the auction, claiming that Stephen Curry wasn't as involved as they initially thought.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://ca.finance.yahoo.com/news/cryptokitties-quietly-suspends-currykitties-promotion-144800509.html|title=CryptoKitties Quietly Suspends ‘CurryKitties’ Promotion|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company was later sued for trade secret theft over the Stephen Curry collectibles.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/05/25/cryptokitties-sued-for-trade-secret-theft-over-stephen-curry-collectibles/|title=CryptoKitties sued for trade secret theft over Stephen Curry collectibles|date=2018-05-25|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ccn.com/company-sues-cryptokitties-creator-for-allegedly-stealing-trade-secrets/|title=Company Sues CryptoKitties Creator for Allegedly Stealing Trade Secrets|date=2018-05-25|work=CCN|access-date=2018-05-29|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2018, ''CryptoKitties'' reached the milestone of 1 million cats being bred with a volume of 3.2 million transactions on its smart contracts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/10/06/cryptokitties-explained-why-players-have-bred-over-a-million-blockchain-felines/|title=CryptoKitties explained: Why players have bred over a million blockchain felines|date=2018-10-06|work=VentureBeat|access-date=2018-10-22|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2018, Dapper Labs, which was spun out of Axiom Zen as the developer of ''CryptoKitties'', raised an additional $15 million in a venture round led by Venrock.The company doubled its valuation in this round.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2018-11-01/cryptokitties-maker-doubles-valuation-in-venrock-led-fundraising|title=CryptoKitties Maker Doubles Valuation in Venrock-Led Fundraising|last=|first=|date=|website=www.bloomberg.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2018 ''CryptoKitties'' will help the German museum [[ZKM Center for Art and Media Karlsruhe]] explain blockchain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Takahashi |first1=Dean |title=CryptoKitties will help German museum explain blockchain |url=https://venturebeat.com/2018/08/28/cryptokitties-will-help-german-museum-explain-blockchain/ |website=Venture Beat |accessdate=7 October 2018 |date=28 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Cant |first1=Joeri |title=CryptoKitties at German art exhibit 'Bringing Blockchain to Life' |url=https://www.chepicap.com/en/news/3286/cryptokitties-at-german-art-exhibit-bringing-blockchain-to-life-.html |website=Chepicap |accessdate=7 October 2018 |date=29 Aug 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Technology ==

A CryptoKitties' ownership is tracked via a smart contract on the Ethereum blockchain. CryptoKitties are distributed automatically, via smart contract, at the rate of one every 15 minutes (672 per week) for one year. Each CryptoKitty is represented in the form of a non-fungible ERC-721 token, which allows for each entity to have specific cattributes.

Based on the limited number of cats going into circulation and their limited genomes, there is a limit of 4 billion total cats that can be bred.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Each cat will have a distinct visual appearance ("phenotype") determined by its immutable genes ("genotype") stored in the smart contract. Because cats are tokens on a blockchain, they can be bought, sold, or transferred digitally, with strong guarantees of ownership. A CryptoKitty does not have a permanently assigned gender. While they can only engage in one breeding session at one time, each cat is able to act as either matron or sire. The owner chooses with each breeding interaction.

A group known as Axiom Zen innovation studio developed the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-12-04/cryptokitties-quickly-becomes-most-widely-used-ethereum-app|title=CryptoKitties Mania Overwhelms Ethereum Network's Processing|date=2017-12-04|work=Bloomberg|access-date=2017-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Until November 2018, Axiom Zen intends to continually release a new CryptoKitty every 15 minutes,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; with the rest of supply determined by breeding of CryptoKitties. CryptoKitty owners may put them up for sale via an auction for a price set in Ether (ETH).

== Reception ==
There are concerns that ''CryptoKitties'' is crowding out more serious, significant business that use the Ethereum platform. As of December 5, 2017 Etherscan has reported a sixfold increase in pending transactions on Ethereum since the game's release just a week earlier. "''CryptoKitties'' has become so popular that it's taking up a significant amount of available space for transactions on the Ethereum platform", said Garrick Hileman, from the University of Cambridge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-42237162|title=CryptoKitties cripple Ethereum blockchain|date=2017-12-05|work=BBC News|access-date=2017-12-11|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ethereum miners increased the gas limit in response to ''CryptoKitties'', which allowed for more data per block and increasing transactions per second.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

'''Cycadales''' is an [[order (taxonomy)|order]] of [[seed plant]]s that includes all the extant [[cycad]]s. These plants typically have a stout and woody ([[ligneous]]) [[trunk (botany)|trunk]] with a [[crown (botany)|crown]] of large, hard and stiff, [[evergreen]] leaves. They usually have [[pinnate]] leaves. The individual plants are either all male or all female ([[dioecious]]). Cycads vary in size from having trunks only a few centimeters to several meters tall. They typically grow very slowly and live very long, with some specimens known to be as much as 1,000 years old. Because of the superficial resemblance, they are sometimes confused with and mistaken for [[Arecaceae|palms]] or [[fern]]s, but are only distantly related to either.

Cycadales are found across much of the [[subtropical]] and [[tropical]] parts of the world. They are found in South and Central America (where the greatest diversity occurs), Mexico, the [[Antilles]], southeastern United States, Australia, [[Melanesia]], [[Micronesia]], Japan, China, [[Southeast Asia]], India, Sri Lanka, [[Madagascar]], and [[Southern Africa|southern]] and tropical Africa, where at least 65 [[species]] occur. Some can survive in harsh [[semidesert]] [[climate]]s ([[xerophytic]]), others in wet [[rain forest]] conditions, and some in both.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Some can grow in [[sand]] or even on [[rock (geology)|rock]], some in oxygen-poor, swampy, [[bog]]-like soils rich in [[organic material]], and some in both.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Some are able to grow in full sun, some in full shade, and some in both.{{Citation needed|date=April 2011}} Some are [[Sodium chloride|salt]] tolerant ([[halophytes]]).

Cycadales belong to the [[division (botany)|biological division]] [[Cycadophyta]] along with the fossil order [[Medullosales]]. The three extant [[family (biology)|families]] of cycadales are [[Cycadaceae]], [[Stangeriaceae]], and [[Zamiaceae]]. Though they are a minor component of the [[plant kingdom]] today, during the [[Jurassic]] period, they were extremely common. They have changed little since the Jurassic, compared to some major evolutionary changes in other plant divisions.

Cycads are [[gymnosperms]] (naked seeded), meaning their [[fertilization|unfertilized]] seeds are open to the air to be directly fertilized by [[pollination]], as contrasted with [[angiosperms]], which have enclosed seeds with more complex fertilization arrangements. Cycads have very specialized [[pollinator]]s, usually a specific species of [[beetle]]. They have been reported to [[nitrogen fixation|fix nitrogen]] in association with a [[cyanobacterium]] living in the roots. These [[blue-green algae]] produce a [[neurotoxin]] called [[BMAA]] that is found in the [[seed]]s of cycads. This neurotoxin may enter a  human food chain as the cycad seeds may be eaten directly as a source of flour by humans or by wild or feral animals such as bats, and humans may eat these animals. It is [[hypothesize]]d that this is a source of some [[neurological disease]]s in humans.&lt;ref name=Holtcamp&gt;{{cite journal | author = Holtcamp, W. | year = 2012 | title = The emerging science of BMAA: do cyanobacteria contribute to neurodegenerative disease? | journal = Environmental Health Perspectives | volume = 120 | issue = 3 | doi = 10.1289/ehp.120-a110 | pmid=22382274 | pmc=3295368 | pages=a110–a116}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:Cycad leaves semicircle.jpg|thumb|Cycads have a rosette of pinnate leaves around a cylindrical trunk]]
Cycads have a [[cylindrical]] trunk which usually does not [[branch]].
Leaves grow directly from the trunk, and typically fall when older, leaving a crown of leaves at the top. The leaves grow in a [[rosette (botany)|rosette]] form, with new foliage emerging from the top and center of the crown. The trunk may be buried, so the leaves appear to be emerging from the ground and the plant appears to be a [[rosette (botany)|basal rosette]]. The leaves are generally large in proportion to the trunk size, and sometimes even larger than the trunk.

The leaves are [[pinnate]] (in the form of bird feathers, [[pinnation|pinnae]]), with a central leaf stalk from which parallel "ribs" emerge from each side of the stalk, perpendicular to it. The leaves are typically either compound (the leaf stalk has [[leaflet (botany)|leaflets]] emerging from it as "ribs"), or have edges ([[Leaf margin|margin]]s) so deeply cut ([[incised]]) so as to appear compound. Some species have leaves that are [[bipinnate]], which means the leaflets growing along the [[rachis]] each have their own subleaflets growing along a [[wikt:rachilla|rachilla]] ([[fractal|self-similar geometry]]).

==Taxonomy==
[[File:Cycad cone.jpg|right|thumb|Leaves and cone of ''[[Encephalartos sclavoi]]'']]

About 306 species of living Cycadales have been described, in 10&amp;ndash;12&amp;nbsp;genera and two or 3 families of cycads (depending on [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomic]] viewpoint). The classification below is based upon a hierarchical structure based on cladistic analyses of [[Morphology (biology)|morphological]], [[anatomy|anatomical]], [[karyology|karyological]], [[physiology|physiological]] and [[phytochemistry|phytochemical]] [[data]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Stevenson, D. |year=1992 |title=A formal classification of the extant cycads |journal=Brittonia |volume=44 |issue=2 |pages=220–223  |doi=10.2307/2806837}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The number of species in the [[clade]] is low compared to the number in most other plant [[Phylum|phyla]]. However, paleobotanical and molecular research indicates that the diversity was greater in the history of the phylum. The disparity in molecular sequences is very high between the three main lineages of cycads, implying that genetic diversity in the clade was once high.

Some clearly defined cycad species can [[Hybrid (biology)|interbreed]] and produce fertile offspring.

===Identification===
The three families can be identified by looking at the central stalk of the leaf.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Each family has at least one [[Leaf#Veins|vein]] running up the leaf stalk from bottom to top ([[Anatomical terms of location|longitudinal]]). The [[Cycadaceae]] have only one [[Leaf#Veins|vein]] in the center of the leaf stalk (central vein), but no veins on the stalklets of the leaflet (no [[lateral vein]]s). The [[Stangeriaceae]] have only one central vein, but with lateral veins, also.  The [[Zamiaceae]] have more than one central vein, and they are [[parallel (geometry)|parallel]] to each other.

==History of human use==
[[File:Cycas revoluta seeds.jpg|thumb|These are ''Cycas revoluta'' seeds. They are very toxic.]]
Starch-rich cycad seeds were an important part of the diet of [[Aboriginal people]] in some regions of Australia. Prior to eating them, Aboriginal people used techniques such as roasting the seeds and then soaking the kernels for many days to wash out the poison.

Modern knowledge about cycads began in the 9th century with the recording by two [[Arab]] naturalists that the genus ''Cycas'' was used as a source of [[flour]] in India. Later, in the 16th century, [[Antonio Pigafetta]], [[Fernão Lopes de Castanheda]] and [[Francis Drake]] found ''Cycas'' plants in the [[Moluccas]], where the seeds were eaten. The first report of cycads in the [[New World]] was by [[Giovanni Lerio]] in his 1576 trip to Brazil, where he observed a plant named ''ayrius'' by the indigenous people; this species is now classified in the genus ''Zamia''.

In January 1697, Dutch sailors landed on the banks of the [[Swan River (Western Australia)|Swan River]] in [[Western Australia]], part of the crew of the [[Nyptang]], one of the ships in an expedition led by the Dutch navigator [[Willem de Vlamingh]]. They noticed palm-like plants with cones bearing large brightly coloured seeds. These were enticing and appeared to be a delicious change to a monotonous seafaring diet. Some of the sailors eagerly sampled the seeds and later wrote about the experience:

“… I ate five or six [seeds] and drank some of the water from one of the aforesaid holes, but after an interval of about three hours I and five more of the others who had also eaten the said fruit began to vomit so violently that there was hardly any distinction between death and us.”&lt;ref&gt;G. Schilder (ed.), Royal Australian Historical Society, quoted in J. Kenny 1995, Before the First Fleet, Kangaroo Press, Kenthurst, NSW, pg. 76&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 1770, some British sailors passed the time on the banks of the [[Endeavour River]] in northern Queensland. They were part of the crew of the [[Endeavour voyage]] of [[James Cook]] and their ship has been badly damaged on a coral reef. The sailors noticed many palm-like plants growing nearby, some of which had large brownish seeds described as ‘nuts about the size of a large chestnut and rounder’&lt;ref&gt;Endeavour Journal of Joseph Banks, Vol. 2, pg. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Thinking that the seeds were edible, some sailors tried them. A few hours later, these men suffered from painful stomach cramps and explosive vomiting. The ship’s captain later wrote in his journal:

“… those who made the experiment paid dear for their knowledge of the contrary, for they [the seeds] operated as an emetic and cathartic with great violence…”&lt;ref&gt;Hawksworth 1785, An account of the voyages for making discoveries in the Southern Hemisphere, Vol. IV, Third edition, London, pg. 195&lt;/ref&gt;

Pigs were taken on board the Endeavour in Tahiti as a source of fresh meat and, when they were fed cycad seeds, several of them died.

Throughout the 18th-19th centuries, discoveries of several species were reported by numerous naturalist researchers and discoverers traveling throughout the world. One of the most notable researchers of cycads was American [[botanist]] [[C.J. Chamberlain]] whose work is noteworthy for the quantity of data and the novelty of his approach to studying cycads. His 15 years of travel throughout Africa, the Americas and Australia to observe cycads in their natural habitat resulted in his 1919 publication of ''The Living Cycads'' which remains current in its synthesis of taxonomy, morphology and reproductive biology of cycads, most of which was obtained from his original research. His 1940s [[monograph]] on the Cycadales, was never published.

==Historical diversity==
The probable former range of cycads can be inferred from their global distribution. For example, the family Stangeriaceae only contains three extant species in Africa and Australia. Diverse fossils of this family have been dated to 135&amp;nbsp;mya, indicating that diversity may have been much greater before the Jurassic and late Triassic [[Extinction event|mass extinction events]]. However, the cycad fossil record is generally poor and little can be deduced about the effects of each mass extinction event on their diversity.

Instead, correlations can be made between the number of extant [[gymnosperms]] and [[angiosperms]]. It is likely that cycad diversity was affected more by the great angiosperm radiation in the mid-Cretaceous than by extinctions. Very slow cambial growth was first used to define cycads, and because of this characteristic the group could not compete with the rapidly growing, relatively short-lived angiosperms, which now number over 250,000&amp;nbsp;species, compared to the 947&amp;nbsp;remaining gymnosperms.

===Origins===
[[File:Zamites-feneonis-BRONGNIART.jpg|thumb|The fossil cycad ''[[Zamites|Zamites feneonis]]'']]
The cycad fossil record dates to the early [[Permian]], 280 million years ago ([[mya (unit)|mya]]). There is controversy over older cycad fossils that date to the late [[Carboniferous]] period, 300&amp;ndash;325 &amp;nbsp;mya. One of the first colonizers of terrestrial habitats, this [[clade]] probably diversified extensively within its first few million years, although the extent to which it radiated is unknown because relatively few fossil specimens have been found. The regions to which cycads are restricted probably indicate their former distribution in the [[Pangea]] before the supercontinents [[Laurasia]] and [[Gondwana]] separated.&lt;ref&gt;(Hermsen et al. 2006).&lt;/ref&gt; Recent studies have indicated the common perception of existing cycad species as [[living fossil]]s is largely misplaced, with only ''[[Bowenia]]'' dating to the [[Cretaceous]] or earlier.  Although the cycad lineage itself is ancient, most extant species have evolved in the last 12 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Nagalingum | first1 = N.

The [[family (biology)|family]] [[Stangeriaceae]] (named for Dr. [[William Stanger (surveyor)|William Stanger]], 1811&amp;ndash;1854), consisting of only three [[extant taxon|extant]] [[species]], is thought to be of Gondwanan origin, as fossils have been found in [[Lower Cretaceous]] deposits in [[Argentina]], dating to 70&amp;ndash;135&amp;nbsp;mya. The family [[Zamiaceae]] is more diverse, with a fossil record extending from the middle [[Triassic]] to the [[Eocene]] (54&amp;ndash;200&amp;nbsp;mya) in [[North America|North]] and South America, [[Europe]], Australia, and [[Antarctic]]a, implying the family was present before the break-up of Pangea. The family [[Cycadaceae]] is thought to be an early offshoot, with fossils from [[Eocene]] deposits (38&amp;ndash;54&amp;nbsp;mya) in [[Japan]], [[China]], and [[North America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hopkins|first=DJ|author2=KR Johnson |title=First Record of cycad leaves from the Eocene Republic flora|journal=Washington Geology|date=December 1997|volume=25|issue=4|page=37|url=http://www.nwpaleo.org/Resources/WA_Geology/WA_Geol_1997-CycadLeaves.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; indicating this family originated in Laurasia. ''[[Cycas]]'' is the only [[genus]] in the family and contains 99&amp;nbsp;species, the most of any cycad genus. [[Molecular biology|Molecular]] data have recently shown ''Cycas'' species in [[Australasia]] and the east coast of Africa are recent arrivals, suggesting [[adaptive radiation]] may have occurred. The current distribution of cycads may be due to radiations from a few ancestral types sequestered on Laurasia and Gondwana, or could be explained by [[genetic drift]] following the separation of already evolved genera. Both explanations account for the strict [[endemism]] across present continental lines.

===Distribution===
[[File:Cycads world distribution.png|thumb|800px|center|&lt;center&gt;Approximate world distribution of living Cycadales&lt;/center&gt;]]

Overall species diversity peaks at 17˚ 15"N and 28˚ 12"S, with a minor peak at the [[equator]]. There is therefore not a [[Latitudinal gradients in species diversity|latitudinal diversity gradient]] towards the equator but towards the tropics. However, the peak in the northern tropics is largely due to ''Cycas'' in Asia and ''Zamia'' in the New World, whereas the peak in the southern tropics is due to ''Cycas'' again, and also to the diverse genus ''Encephalartos'' in southern and central Africa and ''Macrozamia'' in Australia. Thus, the distribution pattern of cycad species with latitude appears to be an artifact of the geographical isolation of cycad genera, and is dependent on the remaining species in each genus that did not follow the extinction pattern of their ancestors. ''Cycas'' is the only genus that has a broad geographical range and can thus be used to infer that cycads tend to live in the upper and lower tropics. This is probably because these areas have a drier climate with relatively cool winters; while cycads require some rainfall, they appear to be partly [[xerophytic]].

===Conservation===
[[File:Encephalartos woodii (Londra).JPG|right|thumb|''Encephalartos woodii'' is extinct in the wild, and all living specimens are clones of the [[Biological type|type]].]]
In recent years, many cycads have been dwindling in numbers and may face risk of [[extinct]]ion because of theft and unscrupulous collection from their natural habitats, as well as from habitat destruction. [http://www.traffic.org/ TRAFFIC], the wildlife monitoring network are urging countries supplying the illegal trade in Cycads to implement a blanket ban on all species to prevent further wild extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.traffic.org/home/2011/2/25/south-african-measures-to-restrict-cycad-trade-inadequate.html TRAFFIC - Wildlife Trade News - South African measures to restrict cycad trade inadequate&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

About 23% of the 305&amp;nbsp;extant cycad species are either [[Critically endangered species|critically endangered]] or [[Endangered species|endangered]], and 15% are [[Vulnerable species|vulnerable]]. Thus, 38% of cycads are on the [[IUCN Red List]] (2004), and the other 62% are in the [[Least concern]] or [[Near Threatened]] category (i.e. not actually on the Red List), or are [[data deficient]]. This value has changed dramatically within the past few years; 46% of cycads were on the 1978 Red List, and this rose to 82% in 1997. This was largely due to the recent discovery of over 150 new species, disagreements about classification, and uncertainty. This has not been helpful for conservation planning for the group.

''Zamia'' in the New World, ''Cycas'' in Asia and ''Encephalartos'' in Africa are the most threatened genera. This pattern reflects the pressures on species in these regions. At least two species, ''[[Encephalartos woodii]]'' and ''[[Encephalartos relictus]]'' (both from Africa), are confirmed [[extinct in the wild]]. Cycads are long-lived with infrequent reproduction, and most populations are small, putting them at risk of extinction from habitat destruction and stochastic environmental events. Regionally, Australian cycads are the least at risk, as they are locally common and habitat fragmentation is low. However, land management with fire is thought to be a threat to Australian species. African cycads are rare and are thought to be naturally decreasing due to small population sizes, and there is controversy over whether to let natural extinction processes act on these cycads.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

All cycads are in the [[CITES]] appendix appearing under the heading Plant Kingdom and under three family names, Cycadaceae, Stangeriaceae and Zamiaceae.

All cycads are CITES APPENDIX II except the following, in APPENDIX I:
*''Cycas beddomei''
*''Stangeria eriopus''
*All ''Ceratozamia''
*All ''Chigua''
*All ''Encephalartos''
*''Microcycas calocoma''

Cycad seeds from species on APPENDIX II are not CITES regulated. APPENDIX I seeds are treated the same as the plants.

==Uses==
[[File:Wuhan - Cycad tied up for the winter - P1040916.JPG|thumb|Popular landscaping plants in [[Wuhan]], cycads need some winter protection in central China's winters]]
In [[Vanuatu]], where the cycad is known by the [[Bislama]] name ''namele'', the tree has deep customary and spiritual significance. A single cycad leaf may be used as a taboo sign, while a pair of crossed cycad leaves is a peace sign and appears on the Vanuatu flag. The breaking off of fronds from a cycad leaf is used in traditional contexts as an aid to counting.

Cycad leaves are used to decorate venues during festivals, marriages and other community celebrations.

===Horticulture===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2015}}
[[File:Cycas Sago.palm.arp.750pix.jpg|left|thumb|A Sago Cycad (''Cycas revoluta'') growing in England as a houseplant]]
Cycads can be cut into pieces to make new plants, or by direct planting of the seeds. Propagation by seeds is the preferred method of growth, and two unique risks to their germination exist. One is that the seeds have no dormancy, so the embryo is biologically required to maintain growth and development, which means if the seed dries out, it dies. The second is that the emerging radicle and embryo can be very susceptible to fungal diseases in its early stages, when in unhygienic or excessively wet conditions. Thus, many cycad growers pregerminate the seeds in moist, sterile media such as vermiculite or perlite. However pregermination is not necessary, and many report success by directly planting the seeds in regular potting soil. As with many plants, a combination of well-drained soil, sunlight, water and nutrients will help it to prosper. Although, because of their hardy nature, cycads do not necessarily require the most tender or careful treatment, they can grow in almost any medium, including soilless ones. One of the most common causes of cycad death is from rotting stems and roots due to over-watering.

Some [[insect]]s, particularly [[scale insect]]s, some [[weevil]]s and chewing insects can damage cycads, though the pests are susceptible to [[insecticide]]s such as the horticulture soluble oil [[white oil]]. Sometimes bacterial preparations may be used to control insect infestation on cycads. When some of the mature plants prepare for reproduction, though, the presence of weevils has been shown to help accomplish pollination.

While the cycads have a reputation of slow growth, it is not always well-founded, and some actually grow quite fast, achieving reproductive maturity in 2&amp;ndash;3&amp;nbsp;years (as with some ''Zamia'' species), while others in 15&amp;nbsp;years (as with some ''Cycas'', Australian ''Macrozamia'' and ''Lepidozamia'').

===Source of nutrition===
The [[starch]] obtained from the stems of certain species is still used as [[food]] by some indigenous tribes. Tribal people also grind and soak the seeds to remove the nerve [[toxin]]s that may be present, making the food source generally safe to eat, although often not all the toxin is removed. In addition, consumers of [[bush meat]] may face a health threat as the meat comes from game which may have eaten cycad seeds and carry traces of the toxin in body [[fat]].

Cycad, known as ''sotetsu'' (Jap. ソテツ, [[Kanji]]: 蘇鉄) in [[Japanese language|Japanese]], was traditionally a [[famine food]] in [[Okinawa]] - a last resort to turn to for sustenance during particularly difficult times.&lt;ref&gt;Kerr, George. ''Okinawa: The History of an Island People''. Revised Edition. Boston: Tuttle Publishing, 2000. pp406-7.&lt;/ref&gt; A period of particularly devastating poverty and famine in the 1920s, caused in large part by Japanese economic policies in the island prefecture, is known as "cycad hell" or ''[[sotetsu jigoku]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Smits, Gregory. "[http://www.east-asian-history.net/Ryukyu/History/Okinawa/Postwar/index.htm Okinawa in Postwar Japanese Politics and the Economy] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130530211516/http://www.east-asian-history.net/Ryukyu/History/Okinawa/Postwar/index.htm |date=30 May 2013 }}." East-Asian-History.net. Accessed 5 December 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cycad meal known as ''Eenthu'' in Malayalam is a common food in Kerala. Traditionally, the seeds were sliced and kept in direct sunlight or near the hearth during rainy season to promote drying. The drying process is carried out to reduce the toxin levels and as a means of preservation. The outer shell is subsequently removed and inner portion is ground into a flour. Properly dried cycad seed flour may be stored for several years without deterioration.

Food items like ''Puttu, Eenthu kanji, Eenthu payasam'' etc. are made out of cycad seed powder.These food items are particularly prepared in heavy rainy seasons in Kerala.

There is some indication that the regular consumption of starch derived from cycads is a factor in the development of [[Lytico-Bodig disease]], a neurological disease with symptoms similar to those of [[Parkinson's disease]] and [[amyotrophic lateral sclerosis|ALS]]. Lytico-Bodic and its potential connection to cycasin ingestion is one of the subjects explored in [[Oliver Sacks]]' 1997 book ''Island of the Colourblind.'' Cattle that graze in pastures containing cycads may ingest the leaves and seeds and develop the neurologic syndrome of cycad toxicosis known as [[zamia staggers]].

'''Diana Walter''' is a fictional character featured in the 2016 film ''[[Lights Out (2016 film)|Lights Out]]'', portrayed by Alicia Vela-Bailey and serving as the [[antagonist]] of the film. She is a vengeful ghost-like entity that attacks people in the dark.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-lights-out-mov-rev-0719-20160719-column.html|title='Lights Out' review: Watch out for the darkness|last=|first=|date=|website=Chicago Tribune|publisher=|access-date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/cinema/lights-out-review-dark-matters/article8916904.ece?homepage=true&amp;w=ma446|title=Lights Out: When darkness matters|last=|first=|date=|website=The Hindu|publisher=|access-date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indiewire.com/2016/07/lights-out-director-david-sandberg-explains-film-ending-1201711861/|title=‘Lights Out’: Director David Sandberg Explains the Film's Shocking Ending|last=|first=|date=|website=IndieWire|publisher=|access-date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fictional character biography ==
Diana is a mysterious figure that attacks people only in the dark. It is revealed she was a young teenager committed to a mental hospital, who also suffered from [[xeroderma pigmentosum]], a serious skin condition that prevented her from being exposed to any light. She befriends teenaged Sophie, who was hospitalized for treatment for her depression. They take a picture together outside where she is covered in shadow by an umbrella. Doctors began performing experiments on Diana, but inadvertently killed her by exposing her to intense surgical-suite spotlights, instantly reducing her body to ashes.&lt;ref name="bio"&gt;{{cite AV media |people=[[David F. Sandberg|Sandberg, David F.]] (Director) |year=2016 |title=[[Lights Out (2016 film)|Lights Out]] |medium=Motion picture |publisher = [[Warner Bros. Pictures]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diana then turns into a demonic, malevolent creature that can act only in the darkness. The creature latches onto Sophie, and kills anyone who tries to help or be with her. She interferes with Sophie's intentions of trying to get better, and frightens Sophie's young daughter [[Rebecca (Lights Out)|Rebecca]] by taking her drawing of her family and inserting herself into it as a stick figure while rubbing out her father. Rebecca’s father flees the family, and Rebecca moves out as soon as she is old enough. Some years later, Diana appears at Sophie's second husband Paul's work place and kills him. She then haunts Sophie and Paul’s child, Martin, to the point that he is unable to get sleep anymore. When Martin is staying at Rebecca's, Diana goes there and haunts them, scratching onto the floor the same name and stick figure she added to Rebecca's childhood drawing.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

Diana continues to influence Sophie, who suggests a stay-in movie night with Martin, including Diana as "the three of us", in an attempt to proactively introduce her son to her demon friend. When Sophie tries to take her pills, Diana knocks them aside. Diana tries to pull Martin under the bed, but Rebecca stops her. She locks Rebecca and Martin in the basement, and attacks Rebecca's boyfriend Bret, who flees to get help. She ignores Sophie's pleas to not hurt her kids, and continues to attack in the dark, killing two police officers. However, as Diana is about to kill Rebecca, Sophie arrives and states that Diana only exists because Sophie has allowed her to exist. Sophie then shoots herself in the head, and Diana disappears.&lt;ref name="bio" /&gt;

== Development ==
=== Conception ===
David said that his goal was to keep Diana's appearance in the film as a silhouette. When asked about how challenging it was to keep Diana in the dark he said "Very challenging because I didn’t want to cheat. I had to storyboard all of it just to make sure that she was truly a silhouette. At first I was working with a storyboard artist. He would draw her with a rim light on her and I was like, “No, we can’t shoot it like that because that’s cheating.” So I had to do my own storyboards and really figure out how we could always keep her as a true silhouette. When she grabs Bret, I had to think about, “If he uses his flashlight like this to bang on the handle, if she grabs him when he’s up here, then the flashlight is pointed backwards creating a silhouette so that she can actually grab him.” It was really hard to figure out exactly how to get her on film." Diana was originally supposed to be more of a demonic presence but [[James Wan]] suggested that she have a human background so she could have a relationship to Sophie and add to the connection to the family.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nerdreport.com/2016/07/21/lights-interview-david-f-sandberg-lotta-losten/|title=Lights Out Interview: David F. Sandberg and Lotta Losten|last=Topel|first=Fred|date=July 21, 2016|website=Nerd Report|publisher=|access-date=August 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Casting ===
In an interview, when asked about the casting of Diana, David said "...I figured she would be pretty still but once I met Alicia, we met Alicia just to have her as a stunt person for whoever would play Diana. But when I met Alicia and she showed me what she could do, because she’s a dancer and she has full control over her body, it was like, 'Oh, this is really awesome. So let’s have Alicia play Diana the whole time and we can really turn her into this ferocious, animalistic creature almost.'”&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4645">'''Digby Augustus Stewart Mackworth Dolben''' (8 February 1848 – 28 June 1867) was an English [[poet]] who died young from drowning. He owes his poetic reputation to his cousin, [[Robert Bridges]], [[poet laureate]] from 1913 to 1930, who edited a partial edition of his verse, ''Poems'', in 1911.

He was born in [[Guernsey]], and brought up at [[Finedon Hall]] in [[Northamptonshire]].  His father, William Harcourt Isham Mackworth (1806—1872), a younger son of Sir Digby Mackworth, the [[Mackworth baronets|3rd Baronet]], took the additional surname Dolben after he married Frances, the heiress of Sir John English Dolben, the [[Dolben baronets|4th Baronet]].

He was educated at [[Cheam School]] and [[Eton College]], studying under the influential Master [[William Johnson Cory]] whose principles of pedagogy and collection of verses ''Ionica'' inspired his own poetry.&lt;ref name="cohen81"&gt;{{cite book| title=The Poems and Letters of Digby Mackworth Dolben 1848–1867 | editor-first=Martin | editor-last=Cohen | year=1981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At Eton, his distant cousin Bridges was his senior and took him under his wing.

Dolben caused considerable scandal at school by his exhibitionist behaviour. He marked his romantic attachment to another pupil a year older than he was, [[Martin Gosselin|Martin Le Marchant Gosselin]], by writing love poetry.  He also defied his strict Protestant upbringing by joining  a [[High Church]] [[Puseyite]] group of pupils. He then claimed allegiance to the [[Order of St Benedict]], affecting a [[Religious habit|monk's habit]]. He was considering a conversion to [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref&gt;Cohen (1981), p.171, quoting letter from Dolben to [[John Henry Newman]], dated 20 March 1867.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1865 on his seventeenth birthday, he was introduced by Bridges, by then an undergraduate at [[Corpus Christi College, Oxford]], to [[Gerard Manley Hopkins]] who was at [[Balliol College, Oxford|Balliol]]. According to the account given by his biographer Norman White, this encounter greatly perturbed Hopkins.

Hopkins's biographer [[Robert Bernard Martin]] asserts that Hopkins’s meeting with Dolben, "was, quite simply, the most momentous emotional event of [his] undergraduate years, probably of his entire life".&lt;ref&gt;''Gerard Manley Hopkins: A Very Private Life'', p. 80; see also Norman White, ''Hopkins: A Literary Biography'', p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|''Hopkins was completely taken with Dolben, who was nearly four years his junior, and his private journal for confessions the following year proves how absorbed he was in imperfectly suppressed erotic thoughts of him''&lt;ref&gt;Robert Bernard Martin, "Digby Augustus Stewart Dolben," ''[[Dictionary of National Biography|DNB]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hopkins kept up a correspondence with Dolben, wrote about him in his diary and composed two poems about the youth, "Where art thou friend" and "The Beginning of the End."&lt;ref name="cohen81" /&gt; Hopkins' High Anglican confessor seems to have forbidden him to have any contact with Dolben except by letter. Dolben's death greatly affected Hopkins, although his feeling for Dolben seems to have cooled  by that time.&lt;ref name="cohen81" /&gt;

Dolben drowned in the [[River Welland]] when bathing with the ten-year-old  son of his tutor, Rev. C. E. Prichard, Rector of [[South Luffenham]]. He was aged 19 and preparing to go up to [[University of Oxford|Oxford]].

Bridges guaranteed Dolben's reputation with ''Three Friends: Memoirs of Digby Mackworth Dolben, Richard Watson Dixon, Henry Bradley'' (1932), as well as the careful editing of his poetry. Subsequently, ''The Poems and Letters of Digby Mackworth Dolben 1848–1867'' (1981) has given a less selective picture.&lt;ref name="cohen81" /&gt;

Hopkins' infatuation for Dolben and Dolben's tragic death feature in [[Simon Edge]]'s novel ''The Hopkins Conundrum'' (2017).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Hopkins Conundrum|url=http://eye-books.com/books/the-hopkins-conundrum|publisher=Eye Books|accessdate=22 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[environmental impact]] of [[wind power]] when compared to the environmental impacts of fossil fuels, is relatively minor. Compared with other [[low carbon power]] sources, wind turbines have some of the lowest [[global warming potential]] per unit of electrical energy generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.renene.2011.05.008 |title=Life cycle assessment of two different 2 MW class wind turbines |journal=Renewable Energy |volume=37 |pages=37–44 |year=2012 |last1=Guezuraga |first1=Begoña |last2=Zauner |first2=Rudolf |last3=Pölz |first3=Werner }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[IPCC]], in assessments of the [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources]], wind turbines have a [[median]] value of between 15 and 11 ([[gram|g]]{{CO2}}[[Carbon dioxide equivalent|eq]]/[[kWh]]) depending on whether off- or onshore turbines are being assessed.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III"&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II I: Technology – specific cost and performance parameters |url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-iii.pdf |publisher=IPCC |accessdate=1 August 2014 |page=10 |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616215117/http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-iii.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II Metrics and Methodology. p. 37–40, 41 |url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-ii.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929140555/http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-ii.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While wind turbine installations may cover a large area, they are compatible with many [[Land-use in Wales|land uses]] such as farming and grazing, as only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure are made unavailable for use.&lt;ref name=mar /&gt;&lt;ref name="British Wind Energy Association"/&gt;

Wind turbines generate some noise. At a residential distance of {{convert|300|m}} this may be around 45&amp;nbsp;dB, which is slightly louder than a refrigerator. At {{convert|1.5|km|abbr=on|0}} distance most wind turbines become inaudible.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gereports.com/post/92442325225/how-loud-is-a-wind-turbine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=8itBNxBL4igC&amp;lpg=PA376&amp;ots=HNpEAjOxaL&amp;dq=wind%20power%20noise%20footprint&amp;pg=PA376#v=onepage&amp;q=wind%20power%20noise%20footprint&amp;f=false Wind Energy Comes of Age  By Paul Gipe]&lt;/ref&gt; From a fundamental biological point of view, it is known that loud noise increases stress and stress causes diseases.&lt;ref name="Gohlke"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.11602 |pmid=18560493 |pmc=2430245 |title=Health, Economy, and Environment: Sustainable Energy Choices for a Nation |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=116 |issue=6 |pages=A236–7 |year=2008 |last1=Gohlke |first1=Julia M. |last2=Hrynkow |first2=Sharon H. |last3=Portier |first3=Christopher J. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wind turbines do not affect human health from noise when properly placed.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Simon Chapman.

Siting restrictions (such as [[Setback (land use)|setbacks]]) have often been implemented to limit any intrusive environmental impacts.&lt;ref name = knopper2014/&gt;

There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures. The scale of the ecological impact remains unclear.&lt;ref name="Eilperin" /&gt;&lt;ref name="rspb"/&gt; Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of [[peat bogs]], affect the siting and operation of wind turbines.

== Basic operational considerations ==

=== Net energy gain ===
The [[EROEI|energy return on investment]] (EROI) for wind energy is equal to the cumulative electricity generated divided by the cumulative primary energy required to build and maintain a turbine. According to a meta study, in which all existing studies from 1977 to 2007 were reviewed, the EROI for wind ranges from 5 to 35,&lt;ref name="Kubiszewski" /&gt; with the most common turbines in the range of 2 MW [[nameplate capacity]]-rotor diameters of 66 meters. On average the EROI is 16, but a paper by Weißbach et al. claimed that, including pump storage systems reduces the EROI for wind remarkably- to an order of magnitude worse than fossil fuels or nuclear power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2013.01.029 |title=Energy intensities, EROIs (energy returned on invested), and energy payback times of electricity generating power plants |journal=Energy |volume=52 |pages=210–21 |year=2013 |last1=Weißbach |first1=D. |last2=Ruprecht |first2=G. |last3=Huke |first3=A. |last4=Czerski |first4=K. |last5=Gottlieb |first5=S. |last6=Hussein |first6=A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Dailykos]] - GETTING TO ZERO: Is renewable energy economically viable? by Keith Pickering MON JUL 08, 2013 AT 04:30 AM PDT.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this paper was rebutted by other scientists, who found serious methodological faults.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.energy.2014.12.060 |title=Rebuttal: "Comments on 'Energy intensities, EROIs (energy returned on invested), and energy payback times of electricity generating power plants' – Making clear of quite some confusion" |journal=Energy |volume=82 |pages=1088–91 |year=2015 |last1=Raugei |first1=Marco |last2=Carbajales-Dale |first2=Michael |last3=Barnhart |first3=Charles J. |last4=Fthenakis |first4=Vasilis }}&lt;/ref&gt; EROI is strongly proportional to turbine size, and larger late-generation turbines average at the high end of this range, at or above 35.{{better source|date=September 2014}} &lt;ref name="Kubiszewski" /&gt; Wind turbine manufacturer [[Vestas]] claims that initial energy "pay back" is within about 7–9 months of operation for a 1.65-2.0MW wind power plant under low wind conditions,&lt;ref name="vestas" /&gt;&lt;ref name=vestas2/&gt; whereas [[Siemens Wind Power]] calculates 5–10 months depending on circumstances.&lt;ref name=witt&gt;Wittrup, Sanne.

Accessed: 27  November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Pollution &amp; effects on the grid ===

====Pollution costs====
Wind power consumes no water&lt;ref name="Mielke" /&gt; for continuing operation, and has near negligible emissions directly related to its electricity production. Wind turbines when isolated from the [[electric grid]] produce negligible amounts of [[carbon dioxide]], [[carbon monoxide]], [[sulfur dioxide]], [[nitrogen dioxide]], [[Mercury (element)|mercury]] and [[radioactive waste]] when in operation, unlike fossil fuel sources and [[nuclear power station|nuclear energy station]] fuel production, respectively.

With the construction phase largely to blame, wind turbines emit slightly more [[particulate matter]](PM), a form of [[air pollution]], at an "exception" rate higher per [[kWh|unit of energy generated]](kWh) than a [[fossil gas]] electricity station("[[NGCC]]"),&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20130405123307/http://wind-energy-the-facts.org/en/environment/chapter-1-environmental-benefits/lca-in-wind-energy.html LCA in Wind Energy: Environmental Impacts through the Whole Chain]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20120813051630/http://www.wind-energy-the-facts.org/documents/download/Chapter5.pdf Wind Energy Environmental issues. table V.1.2 &amp; V.1.15]&lt;/ref&gt; and also emit more [[heavy metals]] and PM than nuclear stations, per unit of energy generated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.externe.info/externe_2006/expoltec.pdf ExternE. The EU's Externality study.Page 35 figure 9]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oecd-nea.org/ndd/reports/2002/nea3676-externalities.pdf Hydropower-Internalised Costs and Externalised Benefits"; Frans H. Koch; International Energy Agency (IEA)-Implementing Agreement for Hydropower Technologies and Programmes; Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. p. 131–134, Figure 1].&lt;/ref&gt; As far as total pollution costs in economic terms, in a comprehensive 2006 European study, [[Mountain|alpine]] [[Hydropower]] was found to exhibit the lowest external pollution, or [[externality]], costs of all electricity generating systems, below 0.05 c[[euro|€]]/[[kWh]]. Wind power externality costs were found to be 0.09 - 0.12c€/kW, while nuclear energy had a 0.19 c€/kWh value and fossil fuels generated 1.6 - 5.8 c€/kWh of downstream costs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.externe.info/externe_2006/expoltec.pdf ExternE. The EU's Externality study.Page 37]&lt;/ref&gt; With the exception of the latter fossil fuels, these are negligible costs in comparison to the [[cost of electricity]] production, which is approximately 10 c[[euro|€]]/[[kWh]] in [[European countries]].

A typical study of a wind farms [[Life cycle assessment]], when not connected to the electric grid, usually results in similar findings as the following 2006 analysis of 3 installations in the US Midwest, where the carbon dioxide ({{CO2}}) emissions of wind power ranged from {{convert|14|to|33|t|ST}} per GWh (14–33 [[gram|g]]{{CO2}}/[[kWh]]) of energy produced, with most of the {{CO2}} [[emission intensity]] coming from producing the concrete for wind-turbine foundations.&lt;ref name="White" /&gt; By combining similar data from numerous individual studies in a [[meta-analysis]], the [[median]] global warming potential for wind power was found to be 11–12 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/kWh and unlikely to change significantly.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dolan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II Metrics and Methodology. p. 37–40, 41 |url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-ii.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929140555/http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-ii.pdf |archivedate=2014-09-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However these relatively low pollution values begin to increase as greater and greater wind energy is added to the grid, or wind power '[[electric grid]] penetration' levels are reached. Due to the effects of attempting to balance out the energy demands on the grid, from [[Intermittent power sources]] e.g. wind power(sources which have low [[capacity factor]]s due to the weather), this either requires the construction of large [[List of energy storage projects|energy storage projects]], which have their own [[emission intensity]] which must be added to wind power's system-wide pollution effects, or it requires more frequent reliance on fossil fuels than the [[spinning reserve]] requirements necessary to back up more dependable sources. With the latter combination presently being the more common.&lt;ref name="is windpower reliable"&gt;{{cite web

National Renewable Energy Laboratory, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
This higher dependence on back-up/[[Load following power plant]]s to ensure a steady [[power grid]] output has the knock-on-effect of more frequent inefficient (in {{CO2}}e g/kWh) [[throttle|throttling]] up and down of these other power sources in the grid to facilitate the intermittent power source's variable output. When one includes the total effect of intermittent sources on other power sources in the grid system, that is, including these inefficient start up emissions of backup power sources to cater for wind energy, into wind energy's total system wide life cycle, this results in a higher real-world wind energy emission intensity. Higher than the direct g/kWh value that is determined from looking at the power source in isolation and thus ignores all down-stream detrimental/inefficiency effects it has on the grid. 
This higher dependence on back-up/[[Load following power plant]]s to ensure a steady [[power grid]] output forces fossil power plants to operate in less efficient states. In a 2012 paper that appeared in the ''Journal of Industrial Ecology'' it states.&lt;ref name="Dolan"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1111/j.1530-9290.2012.00464.x |ssrn=2051326 |title=Life Cycle Greenhouse Gas Emissions of Utility-Scale Wind Power |journal=Journal of Industrial Ecology |volume=16 |pages=S136–S154 |year=2012 |last1=Dolan |first1=Stacey L. |last2=Heath |first2=Garvin A. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|"The [[thermal efficiency]] of fossil-based power plants is reduced when operated at fluctuating and suboptimal loads to supplement wind power, which may degrade, to a certain extent, the GHG([[Greenhouse gas]]) benefits resulting from the addition of wind to the grid. A study conducted by Pehnt and colleagues (2008) reports that a moderate level of [grid] wind penetration (12%) would result in efficiency penalties of 3% to 8%, depending on the type of conventional power plant considered. Gross and colleagues (2006) report similar results, with efficiency penalties ranging from nearly 0% to 7% for up to 20% [of grid] wind penetration. Pehnt and colleagues (2008) conclude that the results of adding offshore wind power in Germany on the background power systems maintaining a level supply to the grid and providing enough reserve capacity amount to adding between 20 and 80 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh to the life cycle GHG emissions profile of wind power."}}

In comparison to other [[low carbon power]] sources Wind turbines, when assessed in isolation, have a [[median]] life cycle emission value of between 11 and 12 ([[gram|g]]{{CO2}}[[Carbon dioxide equivalent|eq]]/[[kWh]]). The more dependable alpine Hydropower and nuclear stations have median total life cycle emission values of 24 and 12 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh respectively.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II Metrics and Methodology. p. 37–40, 41 |url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-ii.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150908235241/http://report.mitigation2014.org/report/ipcc_wg3_ar5_annex-ii.pdf |archivedate=2015-09-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While an increase in emissions due to the practical issues of load balancing is an issue, Pehnt et al. still conclude that these 20 and 80 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh added penalties still result in wind being roughly ten times less polluting than fossil gas and coal which emit ~400 and 900 g CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-eq/kWh respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Pehnt | first1 = Martin | last2 = Oeser | first2 = Michael | last3 = Swider | first3 = Derk J. | year = 2008 | title = Consequential environmental system analysis of expected offshore wind electricity production in Germany | url = | journal = [[Energy (journal)|Energy]] | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 747–759 | doi = 10.1016/j.energy.2008.01.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As these losses occur due to cycling of fossil power plants, they may at some point become smaller when more than 20–30% of wind energy is added to the power grid, as fossil power plants are replaced, however this has yet to occur in practice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Breyer | first1 = Christian | last2 = Koskinen | first2 = Otto | last3 = Blechinger | first3 = Philipp | year = 2015 | title = Profitable climate change mitigation: The case of greenhouse gas emission reduction benefits enabled by solar photovoltaic systems | url = | journal = [[Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews]] | volume = 49 | issue = | pages = 610–628 | doi = 10.1016/j.rser.2015.04.061 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=February 2017}}

=== Rare-earth use ===

The production of permanent magnets used in some wind turbines makes use of [[neodymium]].&lt;ref name="Perry" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hilsum " /&gt; Primarily exported by China, [[Rare-earth element#Environmental considerations|pollution concerns]] associated with the extraction of this rare-earth element have prompted government action in recent years,&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes-2009.12.26" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Biggs " /&gt; and international research attempts to refine the extraction process.&lt;ref name="Ingebretsen" /&gt; Research is underway on turbine and generator designs which reduce the need for neodymium, or eliminate the use of rare-earth metals altogether.&lt;ref name="ScientificAmerican-2010.10.13" /&gt; Additionally, the large wind turbine manufacturer [[Enercon GmbH]] chose very early not to use permanent magnets for its direct drive turbines, in order to avoid responsibility for the adverse environmental impact of rare-earth mining.&lt;ref name="Enercon" /&gt;

== Ecology ==

=== Land use ===
Wind farms are often built on land that has already been impacted by land clearing. The vegetation clearing and ground disturbance required for wind farms is minimal compared with coal mines and coal-fired power stations. If wind farms are decommissioned, the landscape can be returned to its previous condition.&lt;ref name="nsw2010" /&gt;

A study by the US National Renewable Energy Laboratory of US wind farms built between 2000 and 2009 found that, on average, only 1.1 percent of the total wind farm area suffered surface disturbance, and only 0.43 percent was permanently disturbed by wind power installations. On average, there were 63 hectares (156 acres) of total wind farm area per MW of capacity, but only 0.27 hectares (0.67 acres) of permanently disturbed area per MW of wind  power capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Denholm, Maureen Hand, Maddalena Jackson, and Sean Ong, [http://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy09osti/45834.pdf Land-Use Requirements of Modern Wind Power Plants in the United States],  National Renewable Energy Laboratory, NREL/TP-6A2-45834, Aug. 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the UK many prime wind farm sites - locations with the best average wind speeds - are in upland areas which are frequently covered by blanket bog. This type of habitat exists in areas of relatively high rainfall where large areas of land remain permanently sodden. Construction work may create a risk of disruption to peatland hydrology which could cause localised areas of peat within the area of a wind farm to dry out, disintegrate, and so release their stored carbon. At the same time, the warming climate which renewable energy schemes seek to mitigate could itself pose an existential threat to peatlands throughout the UK.&lt;ref name="peatmageddon" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilligan" /&gt; A Scottish [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] campaigned for a moratorium on wind developments on peatlands saying that "Damaging the peat causes the release of more carbon dioxide than wind farms save".&lt;ref name="SudayHerald-2009.05.20" /&gt; A 2014 report for the Northern Ireland Environment Agency noted that siting wind turbines on peatland could release considerable carbon dioxide from the peat, and also damage the peatland contributions to flood control and water quality: “The potential knock-on effects of using the peatland resource for wind turbines are considerable and it is arguable that the impacts on this facet of biodiversity will have the most noticeable and greatest financial implications for Northern Ireland.”&lt;ref&gt;David Tosh, W. Ian Montgomery &amp; Neil Reid [http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/a_review_of_the_impacts_of_onshore_wind_energy_for_publication_9.12.14.pdf A review of the impacts of onshore wind energy development on biodiversity] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150531205832/http://www.doeni.gov.uk/niea/a_review_of_the_impacts_of_onshore_wind_energy_for_publication_9.12.14.pdf |date=2015-05-31 }}, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, Research and Development Series 14/02, 2014, p.54&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind-energy advocates contend that less than 1% of the land is used for foundations and access roads, the other 99% can still be used for farming.&lt;ref name="British Wind Energy Association"/&gt; A wind turbine needs about 200–400 m² for the [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]]. A (small) 500-kW-turbine with an annual production of 1.4 GWh produces 11.7 MWh/m², which is comparable with coal-fired plants (about 15-20 MWh/m²), coal-mining not included. With increasing size of the wind turbine the relative size of the foundation decreases.&lt;ref name="Hau" /&gt; Critics point out that on some locations in forests the clearing of trees around tower bases may be necessary for installation sites on mountain ridges, such as in the northeastern U.S.&lt;ref name="Wind-Watch" /&gt; This usually takes the clearing of 5,000 m² per wind turbine.&lt;ref name="Brandenburg" /&gt;

Turbines are not generally installed in urban areas. Buildings interfere with wind, turbines must be sited a safe distance ("setback") from residences in case of failure, and the value of land is high. There are [[Unconventional wind turbines#Wind turbines on public display|a few notable exceptions]] to this. The [[WindShare]] ExPlace wind turbine was erected in December 2002, on the grounds of [[Exhibition Place]], in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada. It was the first wind turbine installed in a major North American urban city centre.&lt;ref name="TorontoHydro" /&gt; [[Steel Winds]] also has a 20 MW urban project south of [[Buffalo, New York]]. Both of these projects are in urban locations, but benefit from being on uninhabited lake shore property.

==== Livestock ====
The land can still be used for farming and cattle grazing. Livestock are unaffected by the presence of wind farms. International experience shows that livestock will "graze right up to the base of wind turbines and often use them as rubbing posts or for shade".&lt;ref name="nsw2010"/&gt;

In 2014, a first of its kind [[Veterinary]] study attempted to determine the effects of rearing [[livestock]] near a wind turbine, the study compared the health effects of a wind turbine on the development of two groups of growing [[geese]], preliminary results found that geese raised within 50 meters of a wind turbine gained less weight and had a higher concentration of the stress hormone [[cortisol]] in their blood than geese at a distance of 500 meters.&lt;ref name=pmid24597302/&gt;

Semi-domestic [[reindeer]] avoid the construction activity,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1007/s10980-015-0210-8 | volume=30 | title=Wind farm construction impacts reindeer migration and movement corridors | journal=Landscape Ecology | pages=1527–1540}}&lt;/ref&gt; but seem unaffected when the turbines are operating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.7557/2.24.2.301 | volume=24 | title=Effects of wind turbines on area use and behaviour of semi-domestic reindeer in enclosures | journal=Rangifer | pages=55}} [http://septentrio.uit.no/index.php/rangifer/article/viewFile/301/282 mirror]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://wild.nrel.gov/search/site/reindeer?retain-filters=1 Article list]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impact on wildlife ===

Environmental assessments are routinely carried out for wind farm proposals, and potential impacts on the local environment (e.g. plants, animals, soils) are evaluated.&lt;ref name=nsw2010/&gt; Turbine locations and operations are often modified as part of the approval process to avoid or minimise impacts on threatened species and their habitats. Any unavoidable impacts can be offset with conservation improvements of similar ecosystems which are unaffected by the proposal.&lt;ref name="nsw2010"/&gt;

A research agenda from a coalition of researchers from universities, industry, and government, supported by the [[Atkinson Center for a Sustainable Future]], suggests modeling the spatiotemporal patterns of migratory and residential wildlife with respect to geographic features and weather, to provide a basis for science-based decisions about where to site new wind projects. More specifically, it suggests:
* Use existing data on migratory and other movements of wildlife to develop predictive models of risk.
* Use new and emerging technologies, including radar, acoustics, and thermal imaging, to fill gaps in knowledge of wildlife movements.
* Identify specific species or sets of species most at risk in areas of high potential wind resources.&lt;ref name="Zehnder et al." /&gt;

The impact of wind energy on birds, which can fly into turbines directly, or indirectly have their habitats degraded by wind development, is complex.  Projects such as the [[Black Law Wind Farm]] have received wide recognition for its contribution to environmental objectives, including praise from the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]], who describe the scheme as both improving the landscape of a derelict opencast mining site and also benefiting a range of wildlife in the area, with an extensive habitat management projects covering over 14 square kilometres.&lt;ref name=bwea /&gt;

The [[meta-analysis]] on avian mortality by [[Benjamin K. Sovacool]] led him to suggest that there were a number of deficiencies in other researchers' methodologies.&lt;ref name="Sovacool-2009" /&gt; Among them, he stated were a focus on bird deaths, but not on the reductions in bird births: for example, mining activities for fossil fuels and pollution from fossil fuel plants have led to significant toxic deposits and acid rain that have damaged or poisoned many nesting and feeding grounds, leading to reductions in births. The large cumulated footprint of wind turbines, which reduces the area available to wildlife or agriculture, is also missing from all studies including Sovacool's. Many of the studies also made no mention of avian deaths per unit of electricity produced, which excluded meaningful comparisons between different energy sources. More importantly, it concluded, the most visible impacts of a technology, as measured by media exposure, are not necessarily the most flagrant ones.&lt;ref name="Sovacool-2009" /&gt;

Sovacool estimated that in the United States wind turbines kill between 20,000 and 573,000 birds per year, and although he regards either figure as minimal compared to bird deaths from other causes. He uses the lower 20,000 figure in his study and table (see ''Causes of avian mortality'' table) to arrive at a direct mortality rate per unit of energy generated figure of 0.269 per [[GWh]] for wind power. Fossil-fueled power plants, which wind turbines generally require to make up for their weather dependent [[intermittency]], kill almost 20 times as many birds per gigawatt hour (GWh) of electricity according to Sovacool. Bird deaths due to other human activities and cats total between 797 million and 5.29 billion per year in the U.S. Additionally, while many studies concentrate on the analysis of bird deaths, few have been conducted on the reductions of bird births, which are the additional consequences of the various pollution sources that wind power partially mitigates.&lt;ref name="Sovacool-2009" /&gt;

Of the bird deaths Sovacool attributed to fossil-fuel power plants, 96 percent were due to the effects of climate change. While the study did not assess bat mortality due to various forms of energy, he considered it not unreasonable to assume a similar ratio of mortality.&lt;ref name="Sovacool-2009" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Baerwald et al." /&gt; The Sovacool study has provoked controversy because of its treatment of data.&lt;ref name="Seven Biologists" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Paul Lorenzini" /&gt; In a series of replies, Sovacool acknowledged a number of large errors, particularly those that relate to his earlier "0.33 to 0.416" fatalities overestimate for the number of bird deaths per GWh of nuclear power, and cautioned that "the study already tells you the numbers are very rough estimates that need to be improved."&lt;ref name="atomicinsights.com"/&gt;

A 2013 meta-analysis by Smallwood identified a number of factors which result in serious under-reporting of bird and bat deaths by wind turbines. These include inefficient searches, inadequate search radius, and carcass removal by predators. To adjust the results of different studies, he applied correction factors from hundreds of carcass placement trials. His meta-analysis concluded that in 2012 in the United States, wind turbines resulted in the deaths of 888,000 bats and 573,000 birds, including 83,000 birds of prey.&lt;ref&gt;K. Shawn Smallwood, [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/wsb.260/abstract "Comparing bird and bat fatality-rate estimates among North American wind-energy projects"], Wildlife Society Bulletin, 26 Mar. 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2013, a meta-analysis by Scott Loss and others in the journal ''Biological Conservation'' found that the likely mean number of birds killed annually in the U.S by monopole tower wind turbines was 234,000. The authors acknowledged the larger number reported by Smallwood, but noted that Smallwood’s meta-analysis did not distinguish between types of wind turbine towers. The monopole towers used almost exclusively for new wind installations have mortality rates that "increase with increasing height of monopole turbines", but as of yet, it remains to be determined if increasingly taller monopole towers result in lower mortality per GWh.&lt;ref name="Loss et all 2013"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.biocon.2013.10.007 |title=Estimates of bird collision mortality at wind facilities in the contiguous United States |journal=Biological Conservation |volume=168 |pages=201–9 |year=2013 |last1=Loss |first1=Scott R. |last2=Will |first2=Tom |last3=Marra |first3=Peter P. }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kcet.org/news/rewire/wind/study-california-wind-turbines-deadliest-in-us.html |title=Study: California Wind Power is the Worst For Wildlife, Chris Clarke, November 2013. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140220060515/http://www.kcet.org/news/rewire/wind/study-california-wind-turbines-deadliest-in-us.html |archivedate=2014-02-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bird mortality at wind energy facilities can vary greatly depending on the location, construction, and height, with some facilities reporting zero bird fatalities, and others as high as 9.33 birds per turbine per year.&lt;ref name="Barclay Study" /&gt; A 2007 article in the journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' stated that each wind turbine in the U.S. kills an average of 0.03 birds per year, and recommends that more research needs to be done.&lt;ref name="Marris" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-2007.05.10" /&gt;

A comprehensive study of wind turbine bird deaths by the [[Canadian Wildlife Service]] in 2013 analyzed reports from 43 out of the 135 wind farms operating across Canada as of December 2011. After adjusting for search inefficiencies, the study found an average of 8.2 bird deaths per tower per year, from which they arrived at a total of 23,000 per year for Canada at that time. Actual habitat loss averaged 1.23 hectares per turbine, which involved the direct loss of, on average, 1.9 nesting sites per turbine. The effective habitat loss, which was not quantified, was observed to be highly variable between species: some species avoided nesting within 100 to 200 m from turbines, while other species were observed feeding on the ground directly under the blades. The study concluded that, overall, the combined effect on birds was “relatively small” compared to other causes of bird mortality, but noted that mitigation measures might be required in some situations to protect at-risk species.&lt;ref&gt;J.

Francis, [http://www.ace-eco.org/vol8/iss2/art10/#habitat "Canadian estimate of bird mortality due to collisions and direct habitat loss associated with wind turbine developments"], Avian Conservation &amp; Ecology, 2013, v.8 n.2.&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind facilities have attracted the most attention for impacts on iconic raptor species, including [[golden eagle]]s.  The Pine Tree Wind energy project near [[Tehachapi, California]] has one of the highest raptor mortality rates in the country; by 2012 at least eight golden eagles had been killed according to the [[United States Fish and Wildlife Service|U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] (USFWS).&lt;ref name="Pine Tree" /&gt; Biologists have noted that it is more important to avoid losses of large birds as they have lower breeding rates and can be more severely impacted by wind turbines in certain areas.

Large numbers of bird deaths are also attributed to collisions with buildings.&lt;ref name="Balogh" /&gt; An estimated 1 to 9 million birds are killed every year by tall buildings in [[Toronto|Toronto, Ontario]], Canada alone, according to the wildlife conservation organization [[Ecological light pollution#Birds|Fatal Light Awareness Program]].&lt;ref name="NYTimes-2012.10.27" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy" /&gt; Other studies have stated that 57&amp;nbsp;million are killed by cars, and some 365&amp;nbsp;to&amp;nbsp;988 million are killed by collisions with buildings and plate glass in the United States alone.&lt;ref name="NewYorkTimes-2014.05.13" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature-2007.05.10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Lomborg" /&gt; Promotional event lightbeams as well as [[ceilometer]]s used at airport weather offices can be particularly deadly for birds,&lt;ref name="StapleNews" /&gt; as birds become caught in their lightbeams and suffer exhaustion and collisions with other birds.  In the worst recorded ceilometer lightbeam kill-off during one night in 1954, approximately 50,000 birds from 53 different species died at the [[Robins Air Force Base|Warner Robins Air Force Base]] in the United States.&lt;ref name="Johnston " /&gt;

[[File:Eidersperrw Sterna paradisaea colony.jpg|thumb|left| [[Arctic tern]]s and a wind turbine at the [[Eider Barrage]] in Germany.]]

In the United Kingdom, the [[Royal Society for the Protection of Birds]] (RSPB) concluded that "The available evidence suggests that appropriately positioned wind farms do not pose a significant hazard for birds."&lt;ref name="rspb" /&gt; It notes that climate change poses a much more significant threat to wildlife, and therefore supports [[wind farms]] and other forms of [[renewable energy]] as a way to mitigate future damage. In 2009 the RSPB warned that "numbers of several breeding birds of high conservation concern are reduced close to wind turbines" probably because "birds may use areas close to the turbines less often than would be expected, potentially reducing the wildlife carrying capacity of an area.&lt;ref name="RSPB-2009.09.26" /&gt;

Concerns have been expressed that wind turbines at [[Smøla]], [[Norway]] are having a deleterious effect on the population of [[white-tailed eagle]]s, Europe's largest [[bird of prey]]. They have been the subject of an extensive re-introduction programme in [[Scotland]], which could be jeopardised by the expansion of wind turbines.&lt;ref name="Elliott" /&gt;

The [[Peñascal Wind Power Project]] in Texas is located in the middle of a major [[bird migration]] route, and the wind farm uses [[Bird|avian]] radar originally developed for [[NASA]] and the [[United States Air Force]] to detect birds as far as {{convert|4|mi|km}} away. If the system determines that the birds are in danger of running into the rotating blades, the turbines shut down and are restarted when the birds have passed.&lt;ref name="McDermott" /&gt; A 2005 Danish study used surveillance radar to track migrating birds traveling around and through an offshore wind farm. Less than 1% of migrating birds passing through an offshore wind farm in [[Rønde]], Denmark, got close enough to be at risk of collision, though the site was studied only during low-wind conditions. The study suggests that migrating birds may avoid large turbines, at least in the low-wind conditions the research was conducted in.&lt;ref name="NewScientist-2005.06.18" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Desholm" /&gt;  Furthermore, it is not thought that nocturnal migrants are at higher risk to collision than diurnally active species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Welcker, J.|author2=Liesenjohann, M.| author3=Blew, J. |author4=Nehls, G. | author5=Grünkorn, T. |year=2017| title=Nocturnal migrants do not incur higher collision risk at wind turbines than diurnally active species| journal=Ibis| volume=159| pages=366–373 | url = http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/ibi.12456/full | doi=10.1111/ibi.12456 | issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Wind energy converter5.jpg|thumb|right|Old style wind turbines at Altamont Pass in California, which are being replaced by more "bird-friendly designs". While newer designs are taller, there is as yet, no definitive evidence that they are "friendlier". A recent study suggests that they might not be safer to wildlife,&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/energy/2014/04/140427-altamont-pass-will-newer-wind-turbines-mean-fewer-bird-deaths/ Will Newer Wind Turbines Mean Fewer Bird Deaths?

In 2012, researchers reported that, based on their four-year radar tracking study of birds after construction of an offshore wind farm near [[Lincolnshire]], that [[Pink-footed goose|pink-footed geese]] migrating to the U.K. to overwinter altered their flight path to avoid the turbines.&lt;ref name="Yirka" /&gt;

At the [[Altamont Pass Wind Farm]] in California, a settlement between the [[National Audubon Society|Audubon Society]], Californians for Renewable Energy and [[NextEra Energy Resources]] who operate some 5,000 turbines in the area requires the latter to replace nearly half of the smaller turbines with newer, more bird-friendly models by 2015 and provide $2.5 million for raptor habitat restoration.&lt;ref name="Dalton" /&gt; The proposed [[Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Wind Energy Project]] in [[Wyoming]] is allowed by the [[Bureau of Land Management]] to "take" up to 16 eagles per year as predicted by the Fish and Wildlife Service, while making powerlines less damaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://apnews.com/0ae4fb9364a04199838f987c36dd428b/critical-federal-approvals-massive-wyoming-wind-project |title=Critical federal approvals for massive Wyoming wind project|publisher= AP |date=18 January 2017|accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.blm.gov/press-release/blm-announces-major-milestone-and-fws-issues-record-decision-potential-eagle-take |title=BLM Announces Major Milestone and FWS Issues Record of Decision for Potential Eagle Take Permit for Chokecherry and Sierra Madre Phase I Wind Energy Project|publisher= [[Bureau of Land Management]] |date=9 March 2016|accessdate=29 October 2017 |quote=“take” (disturb, injure or kill)}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2012 BLM study estimated nearly 5,400 birds each year, including over 150 raptors.&lt;ref name="EIS" /&gt; Some sites are required to watch for birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://ocm.auburn.edu/newsroom/news_articles/2016/02/auburns-eagles-participating-in-colorado-wind-technology-research-to-help-prevent-bird-strikes.htm |title=Auburn's eagles participating in Colorado wind technology research to help prevent bird strikes|publisher=[[Auburn University]] |date=12 February 2016 |first=Janet |last=McCoy |accessdate=29 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Bats ====

Bats may be injured by direct impact with turbine blades, towers, or transmission lines. Recent research shows that bats may also be killed when suddenly passing through a low air pressure region surrounding the turbine blade tips.&lt;ref name="Baerwald et al." /&gt;

The numbers of [[bat]]s killed by existing onshore and near-shore facilities have troubled bat enthusiasts.&lt;ref name="vawind" /&gt;

In April 2009 the Bats and Wind Energy Cooperative released initial study results showing a 73% drop in bat fatalities when wind farm operations are stopped during low wind conditions, when bats are most active.&lt;ref name="BWEC_curtailment" /&gt; Bats avoid radar transmitters, and placing microwave transmitters on wind turbine towers may reduce the number of bat collisions.&lt;ref name="bats_avoid_radar" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Nicholls2007" /&gt;

A 2013 study produced an estimate that wind turbines killed more than 600,000 bats in the U.S. the previous year, with the greatest mortality occurring in the [[Appalachian Mountains]]. Some earlier studies had produced estimates of between 33,000 and 888,000 bat deaths per year.&lt;ref name="LA Times-2013.11.08" /&gt;

=== Weather and climate change ===

Wind farms may affect weather in their immediate vicinity. This turbulence from spinning wind turbine rotors increases vertical mixing of heat and water vapor that affects the meteorological conditions downwind, including rainfall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scientificamerican.com/article/wind-power-found-to-affect-local-climate/&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, wind farms lead to a slight warming at night and a slight cooling during the day time. This effect can be reduced by using more efficient rotors or placing wind farms in regions with high natural turbulence. Warming at night could "benefit agriculture by decreasing frost damage and extending the growing season. Many farmers already do this with air circulators".&lt;ref name="Nature-2010.12.23" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Roy+Traiteur" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ScienceDaily-2005" /&gt;

A number of studies have used climate models to study the effect of extremely large wind farms. One study reports simulations that show detectable changes in global climate for very high wind farm usage, on the order of 10% of the world's land area. Wind power has a negligible effect on global mean surface temperature, and it would deliver "enormous global benefits by reducing emissions of {{CO2}} and air pollutants".&lt;ref name="PNAS" /&gt; Another peer-reviewed study suggested that using wind turbines to meet 10 percent of global energy demand in 2100 could actually have a warming effect, causing temperatures to rise by {{convert|1|C-change}} in the regions on land where the wind farms are installed, including a smaller increase in areas beyond those regions. This is due to the effect of wind turbines on both horizontal and vertical atmospheric circulation. Whilst turbines installed in water would have a cooling effect, the net impact on global surface temperatures would be an increase of {{convert|0.15|C-change}}. Author Ron Prinn cautioned against interpreting the study "as an argument against wind power, urging that it be used to guide future research".  "We’re not pessimistic about wind," he said. "We haven’t absolutely proven this effect, and we’d rather see that people do further research".&lt;ref name="MIT-2010" /&gt;

[[File:MtStMichel avion.jpg|thumb|right|The surroundings of [[Mont Saint-Michel]] at low tide. While windy coasts are good locations for wind farms, aesthetic considerations may preclude such developments in order to preserve historic views of cultural sites.]]
Aesthetic considerations of wind power stations have often a significant role in their evaluation process.&lt;ref name="TK" /&gt; To some, the perceived  [[aesthetics|aesthetic]] aspects of wind power stations may conflict with the protection of historical sites.&lt;ref name=ARL&gt;[http://shop.arl-net.de/media/direct/pdf/ab/ab_009/ab_009_gesamt.pdf Tourismus und Regionalentwicklung in Bayern], Diana Schödl, Windkraft und Tourismus – planerische Erfassung der Konfliktbereiche, in  Marius Mayer, Hubert Job, 05.12.2013, Arbeitsgruppe „Tourismus und Regionalentwicklung" der Landesarbeitsgemeinschaft Bayern der ARL, p 125. ff&lt;/ref&gt; Wind power stations are less likely to be perceived negatively in urbanized and industrial regions.&lt;ref name=DNR&gt;Günter Ratzbor (2011): [http://www.dnr.de/downloads/thesenpapier-landschaftsbild.pdf Windenergieanlagen und Landschaftsbild.

In the 1980s, wind energy was being discussed as part of a [[soft energy path]].&lt;ref name=wid1&gt;Windenergie in Deutschland: Konstellationen, Dynamiken und Regulierungspotenziale Im Innovationsprozess, Bö Ohlhorst, Springer-Verlag, 2009, p.90 ff&lt;/ref&gt; [[Renewable energy commercialization]] led to an increasing industrial image of wind power, which is being  criticized by various stakeholders in the planning process, including nature protection associations.&lt;ref name=wid2&gt;Windenergie in Deutschland: Konstellationen, Dynamiken und Regulierungspotenziale Im Innovationsprozess, Bö Ohlhorst, Springer-Verlag, 2009, p.163, "Kritik an zunehmend industrieller Charakter der Windenergienutzung"&lt;/ref&gt; Newer wind farms have larger, more widely spaced turbines, and have a less cluttered appearance than older installations. Wind farms are often built on land that has already been impacted by land clearing and they coexist easily with other land uses.

Coastal areas and areas of higher altitude such as ridgelines are considered prime for wind farms, due to constant wind speeds. However, both locations tend to be areas of high visual impact and can be a contributing factor in local communities' resistance to some projects. Both the proximity to densely populated areas and the necessary wind speeds make coastal locations ideal for wind farms.&lt;ref name="EDN Network"&gt;Dipert, Brian.

[[Image:Mittelrhein Burg Katz.jpg|thumb|Loreley rock in Rhineland-Palatinate, part of UNESCO World heritage site [[Rhine Gorge]]]] 
Wind power stations can impact on important sight relations which are a key part of culturally important landscapes, such as in the [[Rhine Gorge]] or [[Moselle valley]].&lt;ref name=sch/&gt; Conflicts between heritage status of certain areas and wind power projects have arisen in various countries. In 2011 UNESCO raised concerns regarding a proposed wind farm 17 kilometres away from the French island abbey of [[Mont-Saint-Michel]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/unesco-s-wind-turbine-problem-mont-saint-michel-s-world-heritage-status-under-threat-a-744555.html UNESCO's Wind Turbine Problem: Mont-Saint-Michel's World Heritage Status Under Threat, Stefan Simons, Der Spiegel]&lt;/ref&gt; In Germany, the impact of wind farms on valuable [[cultural landscape]]s has implications on [[zoning]] and [[land-use planning]].&lt;ref name=sch&gt;Sören Schöbel (2012): Windenergie und Landschaftsästhetik: Zur landschaftsgerechten Anordnung von Windfarmen, Jovis-Verlag, Berlin&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Nohl&gt;Nohl, Werner (2009): [http://www.wanderforschung.de/files/nohl-windkraft1375881239.pdf Landschaftsästhetische Auswirkungen von Windkraftanlagen], p.2, 8&lt;/ref&gt; For example, sensitive parts of the Moselle valley and the background of the [[Hambach Castle]], according to the plans of the state government, will be kept free of wind turbines.&lt;ref name=fitt&gt;Fittkau, Ludger: [http://www.deutschlandfunk.de/aesthetik-und-windraeder.691.de.html?dram:article_id=255858 Ästhetik und Windräder], Neues Gutachten zu "Windenergienutzung und bedeutenden Kulturlandschaften" in Rheinland-Pfalz, Kultur heute, 30 July 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

Wind turbines require [[aircraft warning lights]], which may create [[light pollution]]. Complaints about these lights have caused the US [[FAA]] to consider allowing fewer lights per turbine in certain areas.&lt;ref name="StarBulletin" /&gt; Residents near turbines may complain of "shadow flicker" caused by rotating turbine blades, when the sun passes behind the turbine. This can be avoided by locating the wind farm to avoid unacceptable shadow flicker, or by turning the turbine off for the time of the day when the sun is at the angle that causes flicker. If a turbine is poorly sited and adjacent to many homes, the duration of shadow flicker on a neighbourhood can last hours.&lt;ref name="The wind energy fact sheet"/&gt;

=== Wind turbine syndrome ===
{{main article|Wind turbine syndrome}}
Wind turbine syndrome is a [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] disorder largely caused by anxiety about wind farms and not by the turbines themselves. There is limited evidence of anxiety effects caused by low level noise in the close vicinity of the turbines.&lt;ref name="NRC1" /&gt;

=== Safety ===

Some turbine nacelle fires cannot be extinguished because of their height, and are sometimes left to burn themselves out. In such cases they generate toxic fumes and can cause secondary fires below.&lt;ref name="Reporter News"/&gt; Newer wind turbines, however, are built with automatic fire extinguishing systems similar to those provided for jet aircraft engines. These autonomous systems, which can be retrofitted to older wind turbines, automatically detect a fire, shut down the turbine unit, and extinguish the fires.&lt;ref name="Brown" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Infor4Fire" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MiniMax" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MiniMax2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Modern Power Systems" /&gt;

During winter, ice may form on turbine blades and subsequently be thrown off during operation. This is a potential safety hazard, and has led to localised shut-downs of turbines.&lt;ref name="Telegraph-2008.12.04" /&gt;
Modern turbines can detect ice formation and excess vibration during operations, and are shut down automatically. Electronic controllers and safety sub-systems monitor many aspects of the turbine, generator, tower, and environment to determine if the turbine is operating in a safe manner within prescribed limits.  These systems can temporarily shut down the turbine due to high wind, ice, electrical load imbalance, vibration, and other problems.  Recurring or significant problems cause a system lockout and notify an engineer for inspection and repair.  In addition, most systems include multiple passive safety systems that stop operation even if the electronic controller fails.{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} A 2007 study noted that no insurance claims had been filed, either in Europe or the US, for injuries from ice falling from wind towers, and that while some fatal accidents have occurred to industry workers, only one wind-tower related fatality was known to occur to a non-industry person: a parachutist.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Klepinger, [http://miwind.msue.msu.edu/uploads/files/msue_bulletin.pdf Michigan Land Use Guidelines for Siting Wind Energy Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130503172521/http://miwind.msue.msu.edu/uploads/files/msue_bulletin.pdf |date=2013-05-03 }}, Michigan State University, October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== Offshore ==

Many [[List of offshore wind farms|offshore wind farms]] have contributed to electricity needs in [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] for years, and as of 2014 the first [[List of offshore wind farms in the United States|offshore wind farms are under development in U.S. waters]]. While the offshore wind industry has grown dramatically over the last several decades, especially in Europe, there is still some uncertainty associated with how the construction and operation of these wind farms affect marine animals and the marine environment.&lt;ref&gt;Rodmell, D. &amp; Johnson, M., 2002. The development of marine based wind energy generation and inshore fisheries in UK waters: Are they compatible? In M. Johnson &amp; P. Hart, eds. Who owns the sea? University of Hull, pp. 76–103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditional offshore wind turbines are attached to the seabed in shallower waters within the near-shore marine environment. As offshore wind technologies become more  advanced, floating structures have begun to be used in deeper waters where more wind resources exist.

Common environmental concerns associated with offshore wind developments include:&lt;ref name="Tethys.a" /&gt;
* The risk to [[seabirds]] being struck by wind turbine blades or being displaced from critical habitats;
* Underwater noise associated with the installation process of monopile turbines;
* The physical presence of offshore wind farms altering the behavior of [[marine mammal]]s, [[fish]], and seabirds by reasons of either attraction or avoidance;
* Potential disruption of the near-field and far-field marine environments from large offshore wind projects.

Germany restricts underwater noise during [[pile driver|pile driving]] to [[Sound exposure level|less than 160 dB]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.renewableenergyworld.com/articles/print/volume-18/issue-4/features/wind/did-you-hear-that-reducing-construction-noise-at-offshore-wind-farms.html |title=Did You Hear That?

Due to the landscape protection status of large areas of the [[Wadden Sea]], a major [[World Heritage Site]] with various national parks (e.g. [[Lower Saxon Wadden Sea National Park]]) German offshore installations are mostly restricted on areas outside the [[territorial waters]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.offshore-windenergie.net/windparks Internationales Wirtschaftsforum Regenerative Energien (IWR), German wind power industry Offshore windpark website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729045309/http://www.offshore-windenergie.net/windparks |date=2014-07-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Offshore capacity in Germany is therefore way behind the British or Danish near coast installments, which face much lower restrictions.

In January 2009, a comprehensive government environmental study of coastal waters in the [[United Kingdom]] concluded that there is scope for between 5,000 and 7,000 [[offshore wind turbine]]s to be installed without an adverse impact on the marine environment. The study—which forms part of the Department of Energy and Climate Change's Offshore Energy Strategic Environmental Assessment—is based on more than a year's research. It included analysis of seabed geology, as well as surveys of sea birds and marine mammals.&lt;ref name="BusinessGreen" /&gt;&lt;ref name="UKDOECC=2009.01" /&gt; There does not seem to have been much consideration however of the likely impact of displacement of fishing activities from traditional fishing grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johnson | first1 = M.L. | last2 = Rodmell | first2 = D.P. | year = 2009 | title = Fisheries, the environment and offshore wind farms: Location, location, location | url = | journal = Food Ethics | volume = 4 | issue = 1| pages = 23–24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study published in 2014 suggests that some seals prefer to hunt near turbines, likely due to the laid stones functioning as artificial reefs which attract invertebrates and fish.&lt;ref&gt;Warwicker, Michelle.

'''Evan Bevan''' (1803–1866) was a Welsh writer of satirical verse.

==Life and work==
Bevan was born into a poor family: his parents were William and Gwenllian Bevan of [[Llangynwyd]], [[Glamorgan]]. As a young adult he moved to [[Ystradfellte]], [[Brecknockshire]] and married there Ann Ifan, a butcher's daughter. He later moved to the [[Pontneddfechan|Pontneathvaughan]] area.&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt;

Bevan gained a mainly local reputation as a writer of satirical verse under the pseudonym Ianto'r Castell,&lt;ref name="DWB" /&gt; some of which is archived at the [[National Library of Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://archives.library.wales/index.php/letter-from-evans-john-at-swansea-2|title=D.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6043">'''Ezra Booth''' (February 14, 1792 – January 1873) was an early member of the [[Latter Day Saint movement]] who became an outspoken critic of [[Joseph Smith]] and [[Church of Christ (Latter Day Saints)|the church Smith founded]].

Booth was born in [[Newton, Connecticut]]. He had been a popular [[Methodist]] minister before going to [[Kirtland, Ohio]] with [[John Johnson (Latter Day Saints)|John and Elsa Johnson]] in 1831. After witnessing [[Joseph Smith]] heal Elsa's arm, Booth became a convert and was baptized and ordained  an [[Elder (Latter Day Saints)|elder]] in May 1831 and was ordained to be a [[high priest (Latter Day Saints)|high priest]] by [[Lyman Wight]] on June 3, 1831.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last=Johnson|first=Luke|editor1-last=Wells|editor1-first=Daniel H.|title= [[Millennial Star]]|series=No. 53|volume=26|year=1864|publisher=Latter-Day Saints' Book Depot|location=London|page=834|chapter=The History of Luke Johnson (by himself)|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=v1YoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA145 
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 6, 1831, Booth was called to go to [[Missouri]] with [[Isaac Morley]] and preach the word by the way."&lt;ref&gt;[[Doctrine and Covenants]] [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/52#23 52:23].&lt;/ref&gt; Booth began his mission by preaching the [[Book of Mormon]] to a large audience in Bates Corners, [[Norton Township, Summit County, Ohio|Norton Township, Ohio]] in June 1831. On August 4, 1831, Booth was one of fourteen elders attending the a "Special Conference" in Kaw township, [[Jackson County, Missouri]] called by Joseph Smith.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.saintswithouthalos.com/m/310804.phtml Special Conference held by special commandment of the Lord]. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071019074159/http://www.saintswithouthalos.com/m/310804.phtml |date=October 19, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 6, 1831, Booth was "silenced from preaching as an Elder" by Smith, [[Sidney Rigdon]], [[Oliver Cowdery]], and others. Smith stated that to be because of Booth's dissension towards the leaders of the church, and his apparent lack of humility.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Smith |first= Joseph |editor1-last= Roberts |editor1-first= B. H. |title= [[History of the Church (Joseph Smith)|History of Church]] |date= September 1, 2004 |publisher= Deseret Book |volume = 1|page= 216 |chapter= XVI. The Founding of Zion }}&lt;/ref&gt; Booth had apparently expected that he would convert people through the performance of miracles, as had been his experience with Smith. When no miracles were forthcoming, he became disillusioned.&lt;ref name = rowley/&gt; A [[revelation (Latter Day Saints)|revelation]] came to Smith a few days later, and stated that &lt;blockquote&gt;I, the Lord, was angry with him who was my servant Ezra Booth, and also my servant Isaac Morley, for they kept not the law, neither the commandment; they sought evil in their hearts.… They condemned for evil that thing in which there was no evil; nevertheless I have forgiven my servant Isaac Morley.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scriptures.lds.org/en/dc/64 Doctrine and Covenants 64:15–16].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Less than three days after being "silenced from preaching as an Elder" and after being a member for only five months, Booth renounced [[Mormonism]] in the first of nine letters to be published in the ''Ohio Star'', beginning in November 1831.&lt;ref name = rowley&gt;Dennis Rowley, [http://www.dialoguejournal.com/wp-content/uploads/sbi/articles/Dialogue_V16N03_135.pdf "The Ezra Booth Letters"], ''[[Dialogue: A Journal of Mormon Thought]]'' '''16'''(3) (Autumn 1983): 133–39.&lt;/ref&gt; Booth's letters focused on three main types of criticism:&lt;ref name = rowley/&gt; (1) inconsistencies he saw in Smith's revelations, (2) the "despotic" behavior of the church itself, and (3) the personal weaknesses in Smith and other church leaders. In Norton Township (the area to which Booth was sent on his mission), the effect of Booth's letters is such that "the public feeling was, that 'Mormonism' was overthrown"&lt;ref&gt;

Johnson]] arrived on a mission. Booth's letters were reprinted by [[E. D. Howe]] in his 1834 book ''[[Mormonism Unvailed]]''.&lt;ref name = rowley/&gt;

Information about Booth after 1831 is scarce. However, he married a couple in [[Mentor, Ohio]] on January 16, 1832, and later created the "Church of Christ." His Church of Christ adopted many principles from Mormonism and Restoration Christianity but taught that Smith was a false prophet and that the Book of Mormon was not true. The church had several meetings and soon disbanded. In 1865, Booth moved to [[Cuyahoga Falls, Ohio]].

Booth is buried in Oakwood Cemetery in Cuyahoga Falls, not far from the Johnson home in Hiram. He was buried on January 12, 1873, but the precise date of his death is unknown.

'''Sir Francis Drake''' ({{Circa|1540}}&amp;nbsp;– 28 January 1596&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Paris Profiles|location=Bibliothéque Nationale, Paris|pages=Portfolio 17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) was an English [[sea captain]], [[privateer]], [[slave trader]], [[Officer (armed forces)|naval officer]] and [[explorer]] of the [[Elizabethan era]]. Drake carried out the second [[circumnavigation]] of the world in a single expedition, from 1577 to 1580, and was the first to complete the voyage as captain while leading the expedition throughout the entire circumnavigation. With his incursion into the [[Pacific Ocean]], he claimed [[New Albion|what is now California]] for the English and inaugurated an era of conflict with the Spanish on the western coast of the Americas,&lt;ref name="Wallis1984"&gt;{{cite book|author=Helen Wallis|editor=Norman J.

[[Elizabeth I of England|Elizabeth I]] awarded Drake a [[knight]]hood in 1581 which he received on the [[Golden Hind]] in Deptford. As a [[Vice Admiral]], he was second-in-command of the English fleet in the battle against the [[Spanish Armada]] in 1588. He died of [[dysentery]] in January 1596,&lt;ref&gt;According to the English calendar then in use, Drake's date of death was 28 January 1595, as the new year began on 25 March.&lt;/ref&gt; after unsuccessfully attacking [[San Juan, Puerto Rico]]. Drake's exploits made him a hero to the English, but his [[privateer]]ing led the Spanish to brand him a [[pirate]], known to them as ''El Draque''.&lt;ref&gt;His name in [[List of Latinised names|Latinised]] form was ''Franciscus Draco'' ("Francis the Dragon"). See [http://bancroft.berkeley.edu/Exhibits/nativeamericans/13.html Theodor de Bry].&lt;/ref&gt; King [[Philip II of Spain|Philip II]] allegedly offered a reward for his capture or death of 20,000&amp;nbsp;[[ducat]]s,&lt;ref name="Cummins1997"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Cummins|title=Francis Drake: The Lives of a Hero|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YAcU-WA0X3QC&amp;pg=PA126|year=1997|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=978-0-312-16365-5|page=126}}&lt;/ref&gt; about £6 million (US$8 million) in modern currency.&lt;ref name="Hanna2015"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark G.

==Birth and early years==
[[File:sfdrake42.jpg|thumb|[[Portrait miniature]] by [[Nicholas Hilliard]], 1581, reverse of "Drake Jewel", inscribed ''Aetatis suae 42, An(n)o D(omi)ni 1581'' ("42 years of his age, 1581 AD")]]

Francis Drake was born in [[Tavistock, Devon]], England. Although his birth date is not formally recorded, it is known that he was born while the [[Six Articles (1539)|Six Articles]] were in force. His birth date is estimated from contemporary sources such as: "Drake was two and twenty when he obtained the command of the ''Judith''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Lives of the British Admirals and Naval History of Great Britain from the Time of Caesar to the Chinese War of 1841 Chiefly Abridged from the work of Dr. John Campbell |last=Campbell |first=John |authorlink=John Campbell (author) |date=1841 |publisher=Richard Griffin &amp; Co |location=Glasgow |isbn=9780665347566 |oclc=12129656 |page=104 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SD3M-bWc6a8C&amp;pg=PA104&amp;lpg=PA104|accessdate=30 August 2012}} Direct quote is followed by "this carries back his birth to 1544, at which time the six articles were in force, and Francis Russell was seventeen years of age."&lt;/ref&gt; (1566). This would date his birth to 1544. A date of c.1540 is suggested from two portraits: one a [[Portrait miniature|miniature]] painted by [[Nicholas Hilliard]] in 1581 when he was allegedly 42, so born circa 1539, while the other, painted in 1594 when he was said to be 53,&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;1921/22 edition of the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'', which quotes [[John Barrow (English statesman)|Barrow]]'s ''Life of Drake'' (1843) p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; would give a birth year of around 1541.

He was the oldest of the twelve sons&lt;ref name="ODNB04"&gt;Thomson, George Malcolm(1972), 'Sir Francis Drake', William Morrow &amp; Company Inc. {{ISBN|978-0-436-52049-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Edmund Drake (1518–1585), a [[Protestant]] farmer, and his wife Mary Mylwaye.  The first  son was alleged to have been named after his [[Godparent|godfather]] [[Francis Russell, 2nd Earl of Bedford]].&lt;ref name=tudorplace&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/FrancisDrake.htm |title=Francis Drake bio |publisher=Tudor Place |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=self published website; and Jorge H. Castelli is not an expert|date=January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Froude&gt;Froude, James Anthony, ''English Seamen in the Sixteenth Century'', London, 1896. Quote: "He told [[William Camden|Camden]] that he was of mean extraction. He meant merely that he was proud of his parents and made no idle pretensions to noble birth. His father was a tenant of the [[John Russell, 1st Earl of Bedford|Earl of Bedford]], and must have stood well with him, for Francis Russell, the heir of the earldom, was the boy's godfather."&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of religious persecution during the [[Prayer Book Rebellion]] in 1549, the Drake family fled from [[Devon]] to [[Kent]]. There Drake's father obtained an appointment to minister the men in the King's Navy.  He was ordained deacon and was made vicar of [[Upnor]] Church on the [[Medway]].&lt;ref name=Southey&gt;Southey, Robert. (1897). ''English Seamen&amp;nbsp;— Howard Clifford Hawkins Drake Cavendish'', Methuen and Co. 36 Essex Street WC London&lt;/ref&gt; Drake's father apprenticed him to his neighbour, the master of a [[barque]] used for coastal trade transporting merchandise to France.&lt;ref name="Southey"/&gt; The ship's master was so satisfied with the young Drake's conduct that, being unmarried and childless at his death, he bequeathed the barque to Drake. {{when|date=August 2017}} &lt;!-- when did the master die? when was drake apprenticed?, when did this end? --&gt;&lt;ref name="Southey"/&gt;

==Marriage and family==
Francis Drake married Mary Newman at [[St. Budeaux]] church, Plymouth, in July 1569.  She died 12 years later, in 1581.  In 1585, Drake married Elizabeth Sydenham—born circa 1562, the only child of Sir George Sydenham, of [[Combe Sydenham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Warren|first=Derrick|title=Curious Somerset|date=2005|publisher=Sutton Publishing|location=Stroud|isbn=978-0-7509-4057-3|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was the [[High Sheriff of Somerset]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Documents/sheriffs_of_somerset.htm | title=The Occupants of the ancient office of High Sheriff of Somerset | publisher=Tudor Court | accessdate=30 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Drake's death, the widow Elizabeth eventually married Sir [[William Courtenay (died 1630)|William Courtenay]] of [[Powderham]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tudorplace.com.ar/Bios/FrancisDrake.htm|title=Captain Sir Francis DRAKE|work=tudorplace.com.ar|accessdate=28 May 2008}}{{Unreliable source?|certain=y|reason=self published website; and Jorge H.

==Career at sea==
[[File:Drake Juwel.JPG|thumb|Drake Jewel, on loan at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London]]

At the age of eighteen he was [[purser]] of a ship which sailed to the [[Bay of Biscay]]. At twenty he made a voyage to the coast of [[Guinea]].&lt;ref name="James Mill"&gt;{{cite book|author=James Mill|title=The History of British India|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/titles/mill-the-history-of-british-india-6-vols-1826}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1563, Drake, aged 23, made his first voyage to the [[Americas]], sailing with his second cousin, Sir [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]], on one of a fleet of ships owned by his relatives, the Hawkins family of [[Plymouth]]. He made three voyages with this fleet, attacking [[Portugal|Portuguese]] towns and ships on the coast of [[West Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|3ukDAAAAMAAJ|Some historical account of Guinea: With an inquiry into the rise and progress of the slave trade|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They then sailed to the [[Mexico|Americas]] and sold the captured cargoes of slaves to Spanish [[plantations]].&lt;ref name="Sauer1975"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carl Ortwin Sauer|title=Sixteenth Century North America: The Land and the People as Seen by the Europeans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EWXU6sjN9ZUC&amp;pg=PA235|year=1975|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-02777-0|page=235}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Hawkins (naval commander)|John Hawkins]] is considered to have been the first English [[Atlantic slave trade|slave-trader]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=N|first1=A|title=The National Archives|url=http://www.nationalarchives.gov.uk/slavery/pdf/britain-and-the-trade.pdf|website=National Archives Website|publisher=National Archives|accessdate=28 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hawkins made three such expeditions, the first in 1563, second in 1564 and the third expedition ending in the ill-fated 1568 [[Battle of San Juan de Ulúa (1568)|incident at San Juan de Ulúa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ehr.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/pdf_extract/CXXI/490/226 |title=History of English Slave Trade |doi=10.1093/ehr/cej026 |publisher=Ehr.oxfordjournals.org |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Sir Francis Drake and the African Slaves| last = Vicary| first=Tim  |url=http://englishhistoryauthors.blogspot.co.uk/2012/10/sir-francis-drake-and-african-slaves-by.html|website=English Historical Fiction Authors| accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= England's first slave trader| website=bbc.co.uk| url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/devon/content/articles/2007/01/18/abolition_plymouth_slave_trade_feature.shtml| accessdate=17 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1568, Drake was on his third expedition with the Hawkins fleet when, whilst negotiating to resupply and repair at a Spanish port in [[Mexico]], the fleet was attacked by Spanish warships, with all but two of the English ships lost. He escaped along with John Hawkins, surviving the attack by swimming.

Drake's hostility towards the [[Spain|Spanish]] is said to have started with this incident. Following the [[Battle of San Juan de Ulúa (1568)|defeat at San Juan de Ulúa]], Drake vowed revenge.&lt;ref&gt;"Drake escaped during the attack and returned to England in command of a small vessel, the Judith, with an even greater determination to have his revenge upon Spain and the Spanish king, Philip II."—"[http://library.eb.co.uk/levels/high/article/31135 Sir Francis Drake]" article in online ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica|Britannica Library]]''. Accessed 14 January 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1570, his reputation enabled him to proceed to the [[West Indies]] with two vessels under his command. He renewed his visit the next year for the sole purpose of obtaining information.&lt;ref name="James Mill"/&gt;

In 1572, he embarked on his first major independent enterprise. He planned an attack on the [[Isthmus of Panama]], known to the Spanish as [[Tierra Firma|Tierra Firme]] and the English as the [[Spanish Main]].  This was the point at which the silver and gold treasure of [[Peru]] had to be landed and sent overland to the [[Caribbean Sea]], where galleons from [[Spain]] would pick it up at the town of [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]]. Drake left Plymouth on 24 May 1572, with a crew of 73 men in two small vessels, the ''Pascha'' (70 tons) and the ''Swan'' (25 tons), to capture Nombre de Dios.

His first raid was late in July 1572.  Drake and his men captured the town and its treasure.  When his men noticed that Drake was bleeding profusely from a wound, they insisted on withdrawing to save his life and left the treasure.  Drake stayed in the area for almost a year, raiding Spanish shipping and attempting to capture a treasure shipment.

The most celebrated of Drake's adventures along the [[Spanish Main]] was his capture of the Spanish Silver Train at [[Nombre de Dios, Colón|Nombre de Dios]] in March 1573. He raided the waters around [[Darién, Panama|Darien]] (in modern [[Panama]]) with a crew including many French privateers including [[Guillaume Le Testu]], a French buccaneer, and [[Maroon (people)|African slaves (Maroons)]] who had escaped the Spanish. Drake tracked the Silver Train to the nearby port of Nombre de Dios. After their attack on the richly laden mule train, Drake and his party found that they had captured around 20 tons of silver and gold. They buried much of the treasure, as it was too much for their party to carry, and made off with a fortune in gold.&lt;ref name="Marley2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Marley|title=Wars of the Americas: A Chronology of Armed Conflict in the Western Hemisphere, 1492 to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DkgGVTOr2EsC&amp;pg=PA103|year=2008|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-59884-100-8|pages=103–104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Konstam2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Angus Konstam|title=The Great Expedition: Sir Francis Drake on the Spanish Main 1585–86|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UKyHCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT29|date=20 December 2011|publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing|isbn=978-1-78096-233-7|page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; (An account of this may have given rise to subsequent stories of pirates and buried treasure.) Wounded, Le Testu was captured and later beheaded.  The small band of adventurers dragged as much gold and silver as they could carry back across some 18 miles of jungle-covered mountains to where they had left the raiding boats. When they got to the coast, the boats were gone. Drake and his men, downhearted, exhausted and hungry, had nowhere to go and the Spanish were not far behind.

At this point, Drake rallied his men, buried the treasure on the beach, and built a raft to sail with two volunteers ten miles along the surf-lashed coast to where they had left the flagship.  When Drake finally reached its deck, his men were alarmed at his bedraggled appearance.  Fearing the worst, they asked him how the raid had gone. Drake could not resist a joke and teased them by looking downhearted. Then he laughed, pulled a necklace of Spanish gold from around his neck and said "Our voyage is made, lads!" By 9 August 1573, he had returned to Plymouth.

It was during this expedition that he climbed a high tree in the central mountains of the [[Isthmus of Panama]] and thus became the first Englishman to see the Pacific Ocean. He remarked as he saw it that he hoped one day an Englishman would be able to sail it—which he would do years later as part of his circumnavigation of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Cummins 1997, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt;

When Drake returned to Plymouth after the raids, the government signed a temporary truce with King Philip II of Spain and so was unable to acknowledge Drake's accomplishment officially. Drake was considered a hero in England and a pirate in Spain for his raids.&lt;ref&gt;Cummins 1997, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

==Rathlin Island massacre==
Drake was present at the [[Rathlin Island massacre]] in 1575. Acting on the instructions of Sir Henry Sidney and the Earl of Essex, Sir John Norreys and Drake laid siege to [[Rathlin Castle]]. Despite their surrender, Norreys' troops killed all the 200 defenders and more than 400 civilian men, women and children of Clan MacDonnell.&lt;ref&gt;Sugden, John (1990). Sir Francis Drake. Barrie &amp; Jenkins.{{ISBN|9780712620383}}; Great Britain.

Therefore, the remaining leader of the Gaelic defense against English power, [[Sorley Boy MacDonnell]], was forced to stay on the mainland. Essex  wrote in his letter to Queen Elizabeth’s secretary, that following the attack Sorley Boy "was likely to have run mad for sorrow, tearing and tormenting himself and saying that he there lost all that he ever had." &lt;ref&gt;(Hugh Forde, Sketches Of Olden Days In Northern Ireland: Including Portrush, Dunluce Castle, Dunseverick Castle ... (Belfast, 1923))&lt;/ref&gt;

==Circumnavigation of the earth (1577–1580)==
[[File:DRAKE 1577-1580.png|thumb|500px|A map of Drake's route around the world. The northern limit of Drake's exploration of the Pacific coast of North America is still in dispute. [[Drake's Bay]] is south of [[Cape Mendocino]].]]

With the success of the Panama isthmus raid in 1577, [[Elizabeth I of England]] sent Drake to start an expedition against the Spanish along the [[Pacific]] coast of the Americas. Drake used the plans that Sir [[Richard Grenville]] had received the patent for in 1574 from Elizabeth, which was rescinded a year later after protests from Philip of Spain. He set out from Plymouth on 15 November 1577, but bad weather threatened him and his fleet.  They were forced to take refuge in [[Falmouth, Cornwall]], from where they returned to Plymouth for repair.

After this major setback, Drake set sail again on 13 December aboard ''[[Golden Hind|Pelican]]'' with four other ships and 164 men. He soon added a sixth ship, ''Mary'' (formerly ''Santa Maria''), a Portuguese merchant ship that had been captured off the coast of Africa near the [[Portuguese Cape Verde|Cape Verde Islands]]. He also added its captain, Nuno da Silva, a man with considerable experience navigating in South American waters.

Drake's fleet suffered great attrition; he scuttled both ''Christopher'' and the [[flyboat]] ''Swan'' due to loss of men on the Atlantic crossing. He made landfall at the gloomy bay of [[Puerto San Julián|San Julian]], in what is now [[Argentina]]. Ferdinand Magellan had called here half a century earlier, where he put to death some mutineers. Drake's men saw weathered and bleached skeletons on the grim Spanish [[gibbet]]s. Following Magellan's example, Drake tried and executed his own "mutineer" [[Thomas Doughty (explorer)|Thomas Doughty]]. The crew discovered that ''Mary'' had rotting timbers, so they burned the ship. Drake decided to remain the winter in San Julian before attempting the [[Strait of Magellan]].

===Execution of Thomas Doughty===
{{Main|Thomas Doughty (explorer)}}
[[File:DrakeStatueTavistock.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze statue in Tavistock, in the parish of which he was born, by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883.]]

On his voyage to interfere with Spanish treasure fleets, Drake had several quarrels with his co-commander Thomas Doughty and on 3 June 1578, accused him of witchcraft and charged him with [[mutiny]] and [[treason]] in a shipboard trial.&lt;ref name= Coote /&gt; Drake claimed to have a (never presented) commission from the Queen to carry out such acts and denied Doughty a trial in England. The main pieces of evidence against Doughty were the testimony of the ship's carpenter, Edward Bright, who after the trial was promoted to master of the ship ''Marigold'', and Doughty's admission of telling [[William Cecil, 1st Baron Burghley|Lord Burghley]], a vocal opponent of agitating the Spanish, of the intent of the voyage. Drake consented to his request of [[Eucharist|Communion]] and dined with him, of which [[Francis Fletcher (clergyman)|Francis Fletcher]] had this strange account:

{{quote|And after this holy repast, they dined also at the same table together, as cheerfully, in sobriety, as ever in their lives they had done aforetime, each cheering up the other, and taking their leave, by drinking each to other, as if some journey only had been in hand.}}

Drake had Thomas Doughty beheaded on 2 July 1578. When the ship's chaplain Francis Fletcher in a sermon suggested that the woes of the voyage in January 1580 were connected to the unjust demise of Doughty, Drake chained the clergyman to a hatch cover and pronounced him excommunicated.

===Entering the Pacific (1578)===
[[File:Sfec goldenhind02crop.jpg|thumb|A replica of the ''[[Golden Hind]]'']]

The three remaining ships of his convoy departed for the Magellan Strait at the southern tip of South America. A few weeks later (September 1578) Drake made it to the Pacific, but violent storms destroyed one of the three ships, the ''Marigold'' (captained by John Thomas) in the strait and caused another, the ''Elizabeth'' captained by [[John Wynter]], to return to England, leaving only the ''Pelican''. After this passage, the ''Pelican'' was pushed south and discovered an island that Drake called [[Elizabeth Island (Cape Horn)|Elizabeth Island]]. Drake, like navigators before him, probably reached a latitude of 55°S (according to astronomical data quoted in [[Richard Hakluyt|Hakluyt]]'s ''The Principall Navigations, Voiages and Discoveries of the English Nation'' of 1589) along the Chilean coast.&lt;ref name=Wagner&gt;Wagner, Henry R., ''Sir Francis Drake's Voyage Around the World: Its Aims and Achievements'', Kessinger Publishing, LLC, 2006, {{ISBN|1-4286-2255-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Magellan Strait Francis and his men engaged in skirmish with local indigenous people, becoming the first Europeans to kill indigenous peoples in southern Patagonia.&lt;ref name=Mateo&gt;{{cite book |last=Martinic |first=Mateo |author-link=Mateo Martinic |date=1977 |title=Historia del Estrecho de Magallanes |language=Spanish |url=http://www.memoriachilena.cl/602/w3-article-10441.html |location=Santiago |publisher=Andrés Bello |pages=67–68 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the stay in the strait, crew members discovered that an infusion made of the bark of ''[[Drimys winteri]]'' could be used as remedy against [[scurvy]]. Captain Wynter ordered the collection of great amounts of bark – hence the scientific name.&lt;ref name=Mateo/&gt;

Despite popular lore, it seems unlikely that Drake reached [[Cape Horn]] or the eponymous [[Drake Passage]],&lt;ref name=Wagner/&gt; because his descriptions do not fit the first and his shipmates denied having seen an open sea.  The first report of his discovery of an open channel south of [[Tierra del Fuego]] was written after the 1618 publication of the voyage of [[Willem Schouten]] and [[Jacob le Maire]] around Cape Horn in 1616.&lt;ref name=Kelsey&gt;Kelsey, Harry, ''Sir Francis Drake; The Queen's Pirate'', Yale University Press, New Haven, 1998, {{ISBN|0-300-07182-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Drake pushed onwards in his lone flagship, now renamed the ''[[Golden Hind]]'' in honour of Sir [[Christopher Hatton]] (after his [[coat of arms]]). The ''Golden Hind'' sailed north along the [[Pacific]] coast of South America, attacking Spanish ports and pillaging towns. Some Spanish ships were captured, and Drake used their more accurate charts. Before reaching the coast of [[Peru]], Drake visited [[Mocha Island]], where he was seriously injured by hostile [[Mapuche]]. Later he sacked the port of [[Valparaíso]] further north in [[Chile]], where he also captured a ship full of [[Chilean wine]].&lt;ref name=Orich&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cortés Olivares|first=Hernán F. |url=http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0718-23762005000200005&amp;script=sci_arttext&amp;tlng=es |title=El origen, producción y comercio del pisco chileno, 1546–1931 |doi=10.4067/S0718-23762005000200005 |journal=[[Revista Universum]] |publisher=Scielo.cl |date= |accessdate=25 October 2012 |language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capture of Spanish treasure ships===
Near [[Lima]], Drake captured a Spanish ship laden with 25,000&amp;nbsp;[[Spanish dollar|pesos]] of Peruvian gold, amounting in value to 37,000&amp;nbsp;[[ducat]]s of Spanish money (about £7m by modern standards). Drake also discovered news of another ship, ''[[Nuestra Señora de la Concepción]]'', which was sailing west towards [[Manila]]. It would come to be called the ''[[Nuestra Señora de la Concepción|Cacafuego]]''. Drake gave chase and eventually captured the treasure ship, which proved his most profitable capture.

Aboard ''Nuestra Señora de la Concepción'', Drake found {{convert|80|lb|abbr=on}} of gold, a golden [[crucifix]], [[gemstone|jewels]], 13&amp;nbsp;chests full of royals of plate and 26&amp;nbsp;tons of silver. Drake was naturally pleased at his good luck in capturing the galleon, and he showed it by dining with the captured ship's officers and gentleman passengers. He offloaded his captives a short time later, and gave each one gifts appropriate to their rank, as well as a letter of safe conduct.

===Coast of California: Nova Albion (1579)===
{{Main|New Albion}}
[[File:Drake CA 1590.jpg|thumb|250px|Drake's landing in California, engraving published 1590 by [[Theodor de Bry]]]]

After looting the Cacafuego, Drake turned north, hoping to meet another Spanish treasure ship coming south on its return from [[Manila galleon|Manila to Acapulco]]. Although he failed to find a treasure ship, Drake reputedly sailed as far north as the 38th parallel, landing on the coast of California on 17 June 1579. He found a good port, landed, repaired and restocked his vessels, then stayed for a time, keeping friendly relations with the [[Coast Miwok]] natives. He claimed the land in the name of the [[Trinity|Holy Trinity]] for the English Crown, called ''[[Nova Albion]]''—[[Latin]] for "New Britain". Assertions that he left some of his men behind as an embryo "colony" are founded on the reduced number who were with him in the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]].&lt;ref&gt;Dismissed by John Cummins, ''Francis Drake: The Lives of a Hero'' (1997) p. 118: "In view of the prominence given in different versions to the crowning of Drake it would be odd if the establishment of a colony had gone unrecorded."&lt;/ref&gt;

The precise location of the port was carefully guarded to keep it secret from the Spaniards, and several of Drake's maps may have been altered to this end.  All first-hand records from the voyage, including logs, paintings and charts, were lost when [[Whitehall Palace]] burned in 1698. A bronze plaque inscribed with Drake's claim to the new lands – [[Drake's Plate of Brass]] – fitting the description in his account, was discovered in [[Marin County]], California but was later declared a hoax. Now a [[National Historic Landmark]], the officially recognised location&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drakenavigatorsguild.org/press.html |title=Drake Navigator's Guild |publisher=Drakenavigatorsguild.org |date=17 October 2012 |accessdate=25 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Drake's [[New Albion]] is [[Drakes Bay]], California.

===Across the Pacific and around Africa===
Drake left the Pacific coast, heading southwest to catch the winds that would carry his ship across the Pacific, and a few months later reached the [[Maluku Islands|Moluccas]], a group of islands in the western Pacific, in eastern modern-day [[Indonesia]]. While there, ''Golden Hind'' became caught on a reef and was almost lost. After the sailors waited three days for convenient tides and had dumped cargo, they freed the barque. Befriending a sultan king of the Moluccas, Drake and his men became involved in some intrigues with the Portuguese there. He made multiple stops on his way toward the tip of Africa, eventually rounded the [[Cape of Good Hope]], and reached [[Sierra Leone]] by 22 July 1580.

===Return to Plymouth (1580)===

On 26 September, ''Golden Hind'' sailed into Plymouth with Drake and 59&amp;nbsp;remaining crew aboard, along with a rich cargo of spices and captured Spanish treasures. The Queen's half-share of the cargo surpassed the rest of the crown's income for that entire year. Drake was hailed as the first Englishman to circumnavigate the Earth (and the second such voyage arriving with at least one ship intact, after [[Juan Sebastián Elcano|Elcano]]'s in 1520).&lt;ref name="The Drake Jewel"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oieahc.wm.edu/uncommon/118/drake.cfm |title=The Drake Jewel |publisher=Oieahc.wm.edu |date= |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Queen declared that all written accounts of Drake's voyages were to become the Queen's secrets of the Realm,&lt;!--first publication date is needed here--&gt; and Drake and the other participants of his voyages on the pain of death sworn to their secrecy; she intended to keep Drake's activities away from the eyes of rival Spain. Drake presented the Queen with a jewel token commemorating the circumnavigation. Taken as a prize off the Pacific coast of Mexico, it was made of enamelled gold and bore an African diamond and a ship with an ebony hull.&lt;ref name="The Drake Jewel"/&gt;

For her part, the Queen gave Drake a jewel with her portrait, an unusual gift to bestow upon a commoner, and one that Drake sported proudly in his 1591 portrait by [[Marcus Gheeraerts the Younger|Marcus Gheeraerts]] now at the [[National Maritime Museum]], Greenwich. On one side is a state portrait of Elizabeth by the miniaturist [[Nicholas Hilliard]], on the other a [[sardonyx]] cameo of double portrait busts, a regal woman and an African male. The "Drake Jewel", as it is known today, is a rare documented survivor among sixteenth-century jewels; it is conserved at the [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London.&lt;ref name="The Drake Jewel"/&gt;

===Award of knighthood===

===Award of arms===

After receiving his knighthood Drake unilaterally adopted the [[Coat of arms|armorials]] of the ancient Devon family of Drake of [[Ash, Musbury|Ash]], near [[Musbury]], to whom he claimed a distant but unspecified kinship. These arms were: ''Argent, a [[wyvern]] wings displayed and tail nowed gules'',&lt;ref name="Vivian 1895, p.292"/&gt; and the crest, ''a dexter arm Proper grasping a battle axe Sable, headed Argent''. The head of that family, also a distinguished sailor, Sir [[Bernard Drake]] (d.1586), angrily refuted Sir Francis's claimed kinship and his right to bear his family's arms. That dispute led to "a box in the ear" being given to Sir Francis by Sir Bernard at court, as recorded by [[John Prince (Totnes)|John Prince]] in his "Worthies of Devon" (1697).&lt;ref&gt;[[John Prince (biographer)|Prince, John]], (1643–1723) The Worthies of Devon, 1810 edition, p.329&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Elizabeth, to assuage matters, awarded Sir Francis his own coat of arms, [[blazon]]ed as follows:

{{Quote|''Sable a fess wavy between two pole-stars [Arctic and Antarctic] argent;'' and for his crest, ''a ship on a globe under ruff, held by a cable with a hand out of the clouds;'' over it this motto, ''Auxilio Divino;'' underneath, ''Sic Parvis Magna;'' in the rigging whereof is hung up by the heels ''a wivern, gules,'' which was the arms of Sir Bernard Drake.&lt;ref name="Campbell1828"&gt;{{cite book|last=Campbell|first=John|title=The life of the celebrated Sir Francis Drake, the first english Circumnavigator: reprinted from The Biographia Britannica|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7Zc_AAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA50|accessdate=18 January 2013|date=1828|publisher=Longman, Rees, Orme, Brown and Green|location=London|pages=50–52 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The motto, ''Sic Parvis Magna'', translated literally, is: "Thus great things from small things (come)". The hand out of the clouds, labelled ''Auxilio Divino'', means "With Divine Help".  The full achievement is depicted in the form of a large coloured plaster overmantel in the Lifetimes Gallery at Buckland Abbey&lt;ref name=NationalTrust /&gt;

Nevertheless, Drake continued to [[Quartering (heraldry)|quarter]] his new arms with the wyvern gules.&lt;ref&gt;Drake, Charles E.F., [http://www.wyverngules.com/Documents/ArmsofSFD/arms_of_sir_francis_drake.htm The Arms of Sir Francis Drake] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120519122719/http://www.wyverngules.com/Documents/ArmsofSFD/arms_of_sir_francis_drake.htm |date=19 May 2012 }}, Quebec, 2008; [http://projectavalon.net/forum4/showthread.php?9157-Sir-Francis-Drake-and-dragons Article by str8thinker], Project Avalon Forum, Dec 2010, based on article of Charles Drake, 2008, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; The arms adopted by his nephew [[Sir Francis Drake, 1st Baronet]] (1588–1637) of [[Buckland Abbey|Buckland]] were the arms of Drake of Ash, but the wyvern without a "nowed" (knotted) tail.&lt;ref name="Vivian p.299"/&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Political career==
Drake was politically astute, and although known for his private and military endeavours, he was an influential figure in politics during the time he spent in Britain. Often abroad, there is little evidence to suggest he was active in Westminster, despite being a member of parliament on three occasions.

After returning from his voyage of circumnavigation, Drake became the Mayor of [[Plymouth]], in September 1581.&lt;ref name="ODNB04"/&gt; He became a member of parliament during a session of the 4th Parliament of [[Elizabeth I]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/parliament/1572|title = 1572| website=History of Parliament.|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; on 16 January 1581, for the constituency of [[Camelford]]. He did not actively participate at this point, and on 17 February 1581 he was granted leave of absence "for certain his necessary business in the service of her Majesty".&lt;ref name="fd_history_parl" /&gt;

Drake became a member of parliament again in 1584 for [[Bossiney (UK Parliament constituency)|Bossiney]]&lt;ref name="ODNB04"/&gt; on the forming of the 5th Parliament of Elizabeth I.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/parliament/1584|title=1584|website=History of Parliament  |accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served the duration of the parliament and was active in issues regarding the navy, fishing, early American colonisation, and issues related chiefly to [[Devon]]. He spent the time covered by the next two parliamentary terms engaged in other duties and an expedition to [[Portugal]].&lt;ref  name="fd_history_parl" /&gt;
He became a member of parliament for [[Plymouth (UK Parliament constituency)|Plymouth]] in 1593.&lt;ref name="fd_history_parl" /&gt; He was active in issues of interest to Plymouth as a whole, but also to emphasize defence against the Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.com/news/10-things-you-may-not-know-about-francis-drake|accessdate=28 July 2017| title= 10 Things You May Not Know About Francis Drake|last = Andrews| first =Evan | date= 4 April 2016| website=  [[History (U.S. TV network)|History]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="fd_history_parl"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hasler|first1=P W|title=DRAKE, Francis|url=http://www.historyofparliamentonline.org/volume/1558-1603/member/drake-francis-1540-96|website=History of Parliament |publisher=The History of Parliament Trust|accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Purchase of Buckland Abbey==
In 1580, Drake purchased [[Buckland Abbey]], a large manor house near Yelverton in Devon, via intermediaries from Sir Richard Greynvile. He lived there for fifteen years, until his final voyage, and it remained in his family for several generations. Buckland Abbey is now in the care of the [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] and a number of mementos of his life are displayed there.

==Great Expedition to America==
[[File:Boazio-Sir Francis Drakes West Indian Voyage.jpg|thumb|left|Map of Drake's Great Expedition in 1585 by [[Giovanni Battista Boazio]]]]

War had already been declared by Phillip II after the [[Treaty of Nonsuch]], so the Queen through [[Francis Walsingham]] ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish colonies in a kind of [[preemptive strike]]. An expedition left Plymouth in September 1585 with Drake in command of twenty-one ships with 1,800 soldiers under [[Christopher Carleill]]. He first attacked [[Vigo]] in Spain and held the place for two weeks ransoming supplies. He then [[Capture of Santiago (1585)|plundered Santiago]] in the Cape Verde islands after which the fleet then sailed across the Atlantic, [[Battle of Santo Domingo (1586)|sacked the port]] of [[Santo Domingo]], and [[Battle of Cartagena de Indias (1586)|captured the city]] of [[Cartagena de Indias]] in present-day Colombia. On 6 June 1586, during the return leg of the voyage, [[Raid on St. Augustine|he raided]] the Spanish fort of [[St. Augustine, Florida|San Augustín]] in [[Spanish Florida]].

After the raids he then went on to find Sir [[Walter Raleigh]]'s settlement much further north at [[Roanoke Colony|Roanoke]] which he replenished and also took back with him all of the original colonists before Sir Richard Greynvile arrived with supplies and more colonists. He finally reached England on 22 July, when he sailed into [[Portsmouth, England]] to a hero's welcome.

==Spanish Armada==
{{Main|Spanish Armada}}
Angered by these acts, Philip II ordered a planned invasion of England.

===Cádiz raid===
{{Main|Singeing the King of Spain's Beard}}
In another pre-emptive strike, Drake "singed the beard of the King of Spain" in 1587 by sailing a fleet into [[Cadiz]] and also [[A Coruña|Corunna]], two of Spain's main ports, and occupied the harbours.  He destroyed 37 naval and merchant ships. The attack delayed the Spanish invasion by a year.&lt;ref name="Thompson"&gt;Thompson, E. and Freeman, E. A. ''History of England'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; Over the next month, Drake patrolled the [[Iberian Peninsula|Iberian coasts]] between [[Lisbon]] and [[Cape St. Vincent]], intercepting and destroying ships on the Spanish supply lines. Drake estimated that he captured around 1600–1700 tons of barrel staves, enough to make 25,000 to {{convert|30000|oilbbl|m3}} for containing provisions.&lt;ref name=Kraus&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.loc.gov/rr/rarebook/catalog/drake/drake-home.html |title=Kraus, Hans. ''Sir Francis Drake: A Pictorial Biography'', 1970 |publisher=Loc.gov |date=13 October 2005 |accessdate=25 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defeat of the Spanish Armada===
[[File:DrakeMonumentTavistock.jpg|thumb|250px|Sir Francis Drake whilst playing bowls on Plymouth Hoe is informed of the approach of the Spanish Armada. Bronze plaque by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883, base of Drake statue, Tavistock]]
[[File:Loutherbourg-Spanish Armada.jpg|thumb|250px|The [[Spanish Armada]].]]

Drake was [[vice admiral]] in command of the English fleet (under [[Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham|Lord Howard of Effingham]],) when it overcame the [[Spanish Armada]] that was attempting to invade England in 1588. As the English fleet pursued the Armada up the English Channel in closing darkness, Drake broke off and captured the Spanish galleon ''Rosario'', along with Admiral Pedro de Valdés and all his crew. The Spanish ship was known to be carrying substantial funds to pay the Spanish Army in the Low Countries. Drake's ship had been leading the English pursuit of the Armada by means of a lantern. By extinguishing this for the capture, Drake put the fleet into disarray overnight.

On the night of 29 July, along with Howard, Drake organised [[Fire ship|fire-ships]], causing the majority of the Spanish captains to break formation and sail out of [[Calais]] into the open sea. The next day, Drake was present at the [[Naval battle of Gravelines|Battle of Gravelines]]. He wrote as follows to Admiral Henry Seymour after coming upon part of the Spanish Armada, whilst aboard ''[[English ship Revenge (1577)|Revenge]]'' on 31 July 1588 (21 July 1588 [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]):&lt;ref&gt;Letter to Admiral Henry Seymour written aboard ''Revenge'' on 31 July 1588 (21 July 1588 [[Old Style and New Style dates|O.S.]]) Turner, Sharon. ''The History of England from the Earliest Period to the Death of Elizabeth'', 1835.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Coming up to them, there has passed some common shot between some of our fleet and some of them; and as far as we perceive, they are determined to sell their lives with blows.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The most famous (but probably apocryphal) anecdote about Drake relates that, prior to the battle, he was playing a game of [[bowls]] on [[Plymouth Hoe]]. On being warned of the approach of the Spanish fleet, Drake is said to have remarked that there was plenty of time to finish the game and still beat the Spaniards. There is no known eyewitness account of this incident and the earliest retelling of it was printed 37 years later.&lt;ref name=Kelsey/&gt; Adverse winds and currents caused some delay in the launching of the English fleet as the Spanish drew nearer,&lt;ref name=Kelsey /&gt; perhaps prompting a popular myth of Drake's cavalier attitude to the Spanish threat.

===Drake–Norris Expedition===
{{Main|English Armada}}

In 1589, the year after defeating the Armada, Drake and [[John Norreys|Sir John Norreys]] were given three tasks: seek out and destroy the remaining ships, support the rebels in [[Lisbon]], Portugal against King Philip II (then king of Spain and Portugal), and take the [[Azores]] if possible. Drake and Norreys destroyed a few ships in the harbour of [[A Coruña]] in Spain but lost more than 12,000 lives and 20 ships.{{citation needed|date=March 2008}} This delayed Drake, and he was forced to forgo hunting the rest of the surviving ships and head on to Lisbon.&lt;ref name=Kraus /&gt;

==Defeats and death==
[[File:BurialOfDrakeTavistockMonument.jpg|thumb|Drake's burial at sea off [[Portobelo, Colón|Portobello]]. Bronze plaque by [[Joseph Boehm]], 1883, base of Drake statue, Tavistock.]]

Drake's seafaring career continued into his mid-fifties. In 1595, he [[Battle of Las Palmas|failed to conquer]] the port of Las Palmas, and following a disastrous campaign against Spanish America, where he suffered a number of defeats, he unsuccessfully attacked San Juan de Puerto Rico, eventually losing the [[Battle of San Juan (1595)|Battle of San Juan]].

The Spanish gunners from [[El Morro Castle]] shot a cannonball through the cabin of Drake's flagship, but he survived. He attempted to attack San Juan again, but a few weeks later, in January 1596, he died (aged about 56) of [[dysentery]], a common disease in the tropics at the time, while anchored off the coast of [[Portobelo]], [[Panama]], where some Spanish treasure ships had sought shelter. Following his death, the English fleet withdrew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepirateking.com/bios/drake_francis.htm|title=Sir Francis Drake | website=thepirateking.com |accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before dying, he asked to be dressed in his full armour. He was buried at sea in a sealed lead-lined coffin, near Portobelo, a few miles off the coastline. It is supposed that his final resting place is near the wrecks of two British ships, the ''Elizabeth'' and the ''Delight'', scuttled in Portobelo Bay. Divers continue to search for the coffin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sir Francis Drake's body 'close to being found off Panama'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-15447632|work=BBC News|accessdate=9 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/centralamericaandthecaribbean/panama/8847105/Sir-Francis-Drakes-final-fleet-discovered-off-the-coast-of-Panama.html|website=Telegraph Newspaper|title=Sir Francis Drake's final fleet 'discovered off the coast of Panama' |last1 = Henderson | first1 =Barney  |last2 = Swaine| first2=Jon  | date=24 October 2011 |accessdate=28 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Drake’s body has never been recovered.

In the UK there are various places named after him, especially in [[Plymouth]], Devon. Places there carrying his name include the naval base ([[HMS Drake]]), [[Drake's Island]] and a [[Drake Circus Shopping Centre|shopping centre]] and [[roundabout]] named [[Drake (ward)|Drake Circus]]. [[Plymouth Hoe]] is also home to a statue of Drake.

In the United States [[Drakes Bay]] and [[Sir Francis Drake Boulevard]] of [[Marin County, California]] are both named after him, as well as the high school in [[San Anselmo, California]]. The boulevard runs between Drakes Bay at [[Point Reyes]] to [[New Albion#Point San Quentin, San Francisco Bay, California|Point San Quentin]] on [[San Francisco Bay]]. A large hotel in [[Union Square, San Francisco]] also bears his name.  Additionally, the [[Sir Francis Drake Channel]] in the [[British Virgin Islands]] bears his name.

In [[British Columbia]], [[Canada]], where some theorize he may also have landed to the north of the usual site considered to be [[Nova Albion]], various mountains were named in the 1930s for him, or in connection with Elizabeth I or other figures of that era, including [[Mount Sir Francis Drake]], [[Mount Queen Bess]], and the [[Golden Hinde]], the highest mountain on [[Vancouver Island]].

Drake's will was the focus of a vast [[confidence scheme]] which [[Oscar Hartzell]] perpetrated in the 1920s and 1930s.  He convinced thousands of people, mostly in the American Midwest, that Drake's fortune was being held by the British government, and had compounded to a huge amount. If their last name was Drake they might be eligible for a share if they paid Hartzell to be their agent. The swindle continued until a copy of Drake's will was brought to Hartzell's mail fraud trial and he was convicted and imprisoned.&lt;ref name=Rayner-Richard&gt;Rayner, Richard (22 April 2002). "The Admiral and the Con Man". ''The New Yorker''. p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Drake's Drum]] has become an icon of [[English folklore]] with its variation of the classic [[king in the mountain]] story.

'''Gog''' is a [[fictional character]], a [[comic book]] [[supervillain]] appearing in [[American comic book]]s published by [[Marvel Comics]].

==Publication history==
Created by writer [[Roy Thomas]] and [[Gil Kane]], the character first appears in ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' #103.

==Fictional character biography==
While traveling through the [[Savage Land]], [[Kraven the Hunter]] finds a crashed space ship in [[quicksand]] and ventures inside. There, he finds the juvenile and minuscule Gog and another member of species, who had apparently died during the space ship crash landing. Deciding to save the young Gog from his sinking ship, Kraven takes him with him, names him Gog and decides to raise him as a pet; much to Kraven's surprise, Gog rapidly grows to gigantic size only days after being found by him.&lt;ref name = "BeautyBrute"&gt;{{Cite comic

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kraven, realizing how useful Gog can be, decides to use him in a plot to conquer the Savage Land. After kidnapping the visiting [[Gwen Stacy]] from a camp in the Savage Land, Kraven and Gog battle the heroes [[Ka-Zar (comics)|Ka-Zar]] and [[Spider-Man]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While Ka-Zar deals with Kraven, Spider-Man defeats Gog by luring him into a patch of quicksand, which he sinks to the bottom of.&lt;ref name = "BeautyBrute"/&gt;

Gog would later be saved from dying in the quicksand by the [[Plunderer (comics)|Plunderer]]. Having Gog (who created a device that allowed him to speak English) act as his servant, the Plunderer uses him in a plot to try to steal the super soldier serum in [[New York City]]. Followed to New York by Ka-Zar, Gog and the Plunderer battle him before Gog, using his teleportation bracelets, escapes, first to the [[Statue of Liberty]], then the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]] and finally, to another dimension.{{issue|date=August 2013}}

Gog is later found in the dimension he escaped to by [[Doctor Octopus]] and the [[Sinister Six]], who induct the creature into their group as the sixth and final member of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite comic

Gog later appeared on [[Monster Isle]] when [[Kitty Pryde|Shadowcat]] and [[Magik (comics)|Magik]] appeared to look for a mutant girl named Bo. Gog was among the monsters that attacked the three until Magik teleported herself, Shadowcat, and Bo to the [[X-Mansion|Jean Grey School for Higher Learning]].&lt;ref&gt;''Uncanny X-Men'' Vol. 3 #33&lt;/ref&gt;

==Powers and abilities==
Gog possesses superhuman strength. He also wears bracelets that are capable of granting him interdimensional teleportation.

'''Harold Jones''' (11 January 1906 &amp;ndash; 1971)&lt;ref&gt;''Exposing Jack the Stripper: A Biography of the Worst Serial Killer You've Probably Never Heard Of'' {{ISBN|978-1-492-21043-6}} p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[child murder]]er who committed the murder of two [[preadolescence|preadolescent]] girls in [[Monmouthshire (historic)|Monmouthshire]], [[Wales]] in 1921 when he himself was aged 15.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Every_Mother_s_Nightmare.html?id=0y9JXwAACAAJ|title=Every Mother's Nightmare: Abertillery in Mourning|last=Milkins|first=Neil|date=2016-11-26|publisher=Old Bakehouse Publications|isbn=9781905967117|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones was acquitted of the murder of his first victim, 8-year-old Freda Burnell,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1OFiCgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PT134&amp;dq=%22harold%20jones%22%20murder&amp;pg=PT134#v=onepage&amp;q=%22harold%20jones%22%20murder&amp;f=false|title=The Who's Who of British Crime|last=Morris|first=Jim|date=2015-05-15|publisher=Amberley Publishing Limited|isbn=9781445639352|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; at Monmouthshire Assizes on 21 June 1921. Just 17 days later, he murdered an 11-year-old neighbour named Florence Little. Jones pleaded guilty to Little's murder; also confessing to having murdered Freda Burnell at this second trial.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Owing to his being under 16 at the time he committed the murders, Jones escaped [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment]] for his crimes; instead being sentenced to be detained at [[At Her Majesty's pleasure|His Majesty's pleasure]] on 1 November 1921.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Jones was released from prison in 1941, later marrying and fathering a child.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He died of [[bone cancer]] in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.southwalesargus.co.uk/news/4206050.Gwent_author_s_new_theory_on_murders|title=Gwent Author's New Theory on Murders|access-date=29 September 2018|newspaper=South Wales Argus|date=16 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Harold Jones was born in the Welsh [[company town|colliery town]] of [[Abertillery]] in 1906, the eldest of four children born into a poor family. His father, Phillip,&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; worked as a coal miner, whereas his mother was a housewife.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; Jones and his siblings attended a local council school where he was regarded as a popular and exemplary student, showing a particular flair for sports, and holding aspirations to become a professional boxer.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; He is also known to have spent much of his free time reading, and to have occasionally played the [[Organ (music)#Church organs|organ]] at local church services.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones left school at 14 to obtain employment—largely as a means of supplementing his family's income. He found employment at a local oil and seed merchant named Mortimer's Stores. Here, he was known to be a punctual and trustworthy employee who was both capable of managing the shop without help, and popular with customers.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} pp. 86-87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders==
===Freda Burnell===
On the afternoon of 5 February 1921, an eight-year-old girl named Freda Burnell was reported missing by her parents. She had last been seen by her father, Fred,&lt;ref&gt;''The Who's Who of British Crime: In the Twentieth Century'' {{ISBN|978-1-445-63924-6}} p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; at approximately 9 a.m. that morning, having been sent on an errand from her home at 9 Earl Street to purchase poultry spice and grit from Mortimer's Stores in nearby Somerset Street to feed the family livestock, with her father promising her a [[penny]] upon her return.&lt;ref&gt;''The Who's Who of British Crime: In the Twentieth Century'' {{ISBN|978-1-445-63924-6}} p. 177&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45044159|title=Murdered Abertillery Girl's Niece Learnt About Tragedy in Book|access-date=8 September 2018|newspaper=BBC.co.uk|date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Freda had not returned home after an hour, her frantic parents began making inquiries, including at the store Freda had been sent to visit. The 15-year-old assistant at this store, Harold Jones, confirmed to Freda's father (and later the police) that Freda had visited the store at approximately 9:05 a.m. and that he had served her a bag of poultry spice, adding that she had also asked for a bag of poultry grit but he had informed her the store only had loose poultry grit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-747-23731-0}} p. 232&lt;/ref&gt; The child, he claimed, had left the store to ask her father whether loose poultry grit would suffice, and he had not seen her since.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; By 3 p.m., the Burnell family had informed police Freda was missing, and an exhaustive search for the child was launched.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

The following morning, Freda's body was found by a collier concealed in a sack in an alleyway just 300 yards from the store she had visited.{{refn|group=n|A workman would inform investigators he had passed the precise spot where Freda's body was discovered just 15 minutes before the collier had discovered her body, and was adamant the sack had not been there, thus making the most likely time the body had been deposited at this location sometime between 7:15 a.m. and 7:30 a.m.}} Her cause of death was certified as being a combination of [[blunt trauma]] to her head and [[strangulation]] evident via a cord still tied around her neck, with the time of death occurring between 9:30 a.m. and 1:00 p.m. on the date of her disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Murder of Freda Burnell |date=12 July 1921 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/63196040 |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Freda had been gagged, her elbows had been bound behind her back, and her ankles were knotted together. An attempt had also been made to rape the child.&lt;ref&gt;''The Who's Who of British Crime: In the Twentieth Century'' {{ISBN|978-1-445-63924-6}} p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; Traces of [[Husk|corn chaff]] were also found upon and around her body, and inside the sack in which she was discovered.&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-747-23731-0}} pp. 232-233&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|As per standard procedure, Abertillery Police contacted [[Scotland Yard]] to supervise the murder investigation. Detective [[Chief inspector#United Kingdom|Chief Inspector]] Albert Heldon and Detective Sergreant Alfred Soden arrived in the town on 7 February to supervise the investigation.}}

Investigators noted that a chicken run in the shed belonging to Harold Jones's employers located just a few hundred yards&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Murder of Freda Burnell |date=12 July 1921 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/63196040 |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au|accessdate=6 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; from where the body had been discovered had corn chaff extensively scattered upon the ground, and a handkerchief known to have been in Freda's possession at the time of her disappearance was also found on the ground in the shed. In addition, an axe handle determined to have caused the blunt trauma to Freda's head was discovered concealed beneath some sacking inside the shed. Aside from his employers, Jones was the only individual in possession of a key to the shed, and investigators established a clear time frame of between 9:15 and 9:40 a.m. when no witnesses had physically seen him inside the store.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

}}
A friend of Jones named Levi Meyrick also informed police Jones had actively dissuaded him and a friend from accompanying him to the storage shed at approximately 10:20 p.m. on 5 February; another [[witness]] also informed police he had heard a female child's screams emanating from this shed on the actual morning of Freda's disappearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Murder of Freda Burnell |date=12 July 1921 |url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/63196040 |publisher=Trove.nla.gov.au|accessdate=9 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; When questioned as to these facts, Jones insisted he had not been in the shed on the day of Freda's disappearance. Nonetheless, investigators were convinced otherwise, and he was held in detention at Abertillery Police Station to await the coutcome of the [[coroner#inquest|coroner's inquest]].{{refn|group=n|At the time of the statement in question, Levi Meyrick had accompanied Harold Jones as he walked to his employer's shed to retrieve a sack of potatoes scheduled to be delivered to a customer the following morning. When Meyrick and his friend asked Jones why he had not retrieved the potatoes from the shed Upon his return, Jones simply replied, "I'll pick them up in the morning."}}

The [[inquest]] into the death of Freda Burnell was formally opened on 7 March.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Jones was one of many individuals called to testify at this inquest. He performed poorly on the stand; repeatedly giving conflicting testimony as to his actions on the day of the murder and being forced to admit to lying about various aspects of his testimony (on one occasion prompting the [[coroner]] to scold him and insist he tell the truth).&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, despite there being little [[real evidence|physical evidence]] linking Jones to the murder, investigators believed enough [[circumstantial evidence]] existed to formally charge him with the crime. In response to this formal charge, Jones replied: "I know it looks black against me, but I never done it."&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; He was remanded in custody until 5 April when he appeared before magistrates. On this date, a decision to try Jones for the [[wilful murder]] of Freda Burnell was reached. Bail was refused, and he was detained at [[HM Prison Usk|Usk Prison]] to await trial.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Initial trial===
Jones was brought to trial for the murder of Freda Burnell at Monmouthshire Assizes on 21 June,&lt;ref&gt;''The Who's Who of British Crime: In the Twentieth Century'' {{ISBN|978-1-445-63924-6}} p. 177&lt;/ref&gt; the prosecution [[allegation|alleging]] that he had murdered Freda inside the shed belonging to his employers on the morning of 5 February before placing her body in a sack, and placing the body in an alley close to the shed that evening.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45044159|title=Murdered Abertillery Girl's Niece Learnt About Tragedy in Book|access-date=10 September 2018|newspaper=BBC.co.uk|date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} pp. 84-85&lt;/ref&gt; He pleaded [[Plea#Guilty and not guilty pleas|not guilty]] to the charge; insisting that he had last seen Freda when he had served her at approximately 9:05 a.m. before she had left the store.

Although Jones had contradicted himself on several occasions at the initial inquest, he remained calm when called to testify in his own defence at trial, also withstanding rigorous cross-examination. His employer, Herbert Henry Mortimer, provided him with an alibi; insisting he had heard Jones and his own son working in the store in the early morning of 5 February before the two had been sent to deliver a sack of potatoes to a customer at approximately 10 a.m., later returning to the store where they had continued to work for the rest of the day. Furthermore, on the third day of the trial Jones's own father challenged the prosecutor's contention his son had placed Freda's body in the alley on the evening of her murder; insisting his son had not left the family home between the time he had returned home from work and the following morning, and that he would likely have known so had this been the case. His testimony was [[corroborating evidence|corroborated]] by his wife, who also stressed her son had always exhibited "good behaviour" towards young girls.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;  

Despite the evidence presented at this trial clearly indicating that Freda had most likely been killed in the shed belonging to Jones's employers and only Harold and the Mortimer family having access to the key, after deliberating for over five hours,&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; the jury found Jones not guilty of Freda's murder, returning a unanimous verdict&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-747-23731-0}} pp. 232-233&lt;/ref&gt; of murder by person or persons unknown.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones walked free from the courtroom to a private and reportedly tearful reunion with his parents before being escorted to a local restaurant for a meal. At this service, Jones stood upon a table and addressed his numerous supporters&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; with a speech in which he stated: "I thank you all. I do not hold a grudge against the people of Abertillery for the horrendous ordeal I have been put through."&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 86&lt;/ref&gt; He subsequently returned to Abertillery in a [[charabanc]] adorned with flags and bunting to cheers from the local public, most of whom found the notion that a 15-year-old boy could sexually assault and kill a child simply inconceivable.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68StTYAvpn8C&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=%22harold%20jones%22%20murder&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=%22harold%20jones%22%20murder&amp;f=false|title=Foul Deeds and Suspicious Deaths in Newport|last=Underwood|first=Terry|date=2004-09-01|publisher=Casemate Publishers|isbn=9781903425596|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''A Question of Evidence: The Casebook of Great Forensic Controversies, from Napoleon to O.J.'' {{ISBN|0-471-44014-0}} p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; One of those to greet Jones upon his return was a neighbour named George Little, who greeted him with the statement: "Well done, lad.

===Florence Little===
Seventeen days after Jones's acquittal of Freda's murder, on 8 July, he observed a neighbour of his named Florence Little playing [[hopskotch]] with his own sister, Flossie, outside his home at 10 Darran Road.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; He lured Florence into his house on the pretext of asking her to perform an errand for his family. Inside Jones's home, Florence was instantly partially strangled and dragged into the kitchen,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=68StTYAvpn8C&amp;lpg=PA75&amp;dq=%22harold%20jones%22%20murder&amp;pg=PA75#v=onepage&amp;q=%22harold%20jones%22%20murder&amp;f=false|title=Foul Deeds and Suspicious Deaths in Newport|last=Underwood|first=Terry|date=2004-09-01|publisher=Casemate Publishers|isbn=9781903425596|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; where she was beaten across the head and temple with a plank of wood before Jones suspended her head and neck over his sink, grabbed her by the hair, and proceeded to cut her throat with his father's [[pocketknife]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-747-23731-0}} p. 233&lt;/ref&gt; He then wrapped Florence's head and neck in a grey army shirt before concealing her partially dressed body in the family attic. Having washed all the bloodstains he noted from the sink, walls, floor, and entrance hatch to the attic, Jones then proceeded to bathe himself.{{refn|group=n|Jones would subsequently inform his family that the reason he had washed his own clothes on the date of Florence's murder was because he had accidentally dropped them in the bath.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/28007232|title=A Welsh Horror. Two little Girls Murdered; A Boy's Confession|access-date=8 September 2018|newspaper=nla.gov.au|date=3 November 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Police were notified of Florence's disappearance at 11:15 p.m., and immediately conducted house-to-house searches. The simultaneous searches of nearby woodland and mountains would be assisted by hundreds of local volunteers including Harold Jones.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Questioned by police as to whether he had seen Florence on the day of her disappearance, Jones repeated the same lie he had earlier recited to Mrs. Little when she had called upon his house asking as to her daughter's whereabouts: that she had been at his front door, but had then simply "ran off."&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopedia of Serial Killers'' {{ISBN|978-0-747-23731-0}} p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Following Jones's acquittal of the murder of Freda Burnell, Florence Little had repeatedly informed Jones of her being convinced of his guilt of the crime, although whether she had merely been joking with him is unknown.}}

With Jones's father's consent, the local [[Superintendent (police)|superintendent]], Henry Lewis, and a constable searched Jones's home at 8:30 a.m. the following day as Harold discreetly exited the family home.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Noting the trap-door to the attic was bloodstained despite evident attempts to clean it, the constable conducting the search entered the attic where he discovered Florence's body outstretched across the rafters. Also discovered in the police search of Jones's home were the bloodstained knife Jones had used to murder Florence, a small egg-saucepan filled with a mixture of blood and water beneath the sink over which he had cut the child's throat, a bloodstained plank of wood measuring 19 inches in length concealed beneath the family boiler, and a bloodstained table close to the entrance to the attic in which Florence's body had been concealed.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 89&lt;/ref&gt;

Informed of the discovery in his attic, Phillip Jones left his property and performed a [[Citizen's arrest#United Kingdom|citizen's arrest]] on his son as he conversed with a friend in nearby Mitre Street. Jones then accompanied his father back to Darran Road, where he was placed under arrest.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Upon performing this [[Citizen's arrest#United Kingdom|citizen's arrest]] on his own son, Herbert Jones stated: "I've got no money; I can't help you this time" before escorting his son to the family home.}} 

When news of Jones's arrest for the suspected murder of a second young girl reached the local public, an irate crowd of approximately 500 people gathered outside the local police station, demanding his immediate release. In response, Superintendent Lewis addressed the crowd, stating: "I have found the body of the child in the attic of Harold Jones, foully murdered, and I have arrested Harold Jones. I think this is all I can tell you and it would help us if you disperse and go to your homes."&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 87&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second murder inquest==
On 11 July, an inquest into the death of Florence Little was formally opened. Again conducted by the deputy coroner for the district, the jury heard testimony on this date that Florence Little had effectively bled to death from the wound to her throat. Also to testify at the inquest was Florence's mother, Elsie, who stated that when she had knocked at the Jones residence on the date of her daughter's disappearance, it had taken Harold Jones (the sole occupant in the house at the time) a full two minutes to answer the door, with the explanation he had been bathing when she called. When she asked Jones whether he had seen her daughter, he had smiled before replying: "Florrie's been here, but went through the back way."

The inquest was adjourned until 23 July, with the jury subsequently reaching a unanimous verdict of wilful murder against Harold Jones after just 30 minutes' deliberation. When asked if he had anything to say in relation to this verdict and his being committed to again stand trial at Monmouthshire Assizes for a child murder, Jones—having taken copious notes of the court proceedings&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/28007232|title=A Welsh Horror. Two little Girls Murdered; A Boy's Confession|access-date=8 September 2018|newspaper=nla.gov.au|date=3 November 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;—reportedly jumped to his feet and proclaimed his innocence. He was again detained at Usk Prison to await trial.&lt;ref&gt;''The Who's Who of British Crime: In the Twentieth Century'' {{ISBN|978-1-445-63924-6}} p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=n|Following Jones's acquittal for the murder of Freda Burnell, public opinion had elevated him to a status of wronged hero. According to some [[criminologist]]s and authors, the public reception he had experienced following his accusal and acquittal of Freda's murder had nurtured such a degree of [[vanity]] in Jones that he had simply murdered Florence in order to experience the same public reception and legal acquittal.}}

While awaiting trial, Jones formally confessed to the murder of Florence Little via a written statement dated 17 September. In this statement, Jones described his [[Motive (law)|motive]] for the murder as being a "desire to kill".&lt;ref&gt;''The Who's Who of British Crime: In the Twentieth Century'' {{ISBN|978-1-445-63924-6}} p. 178&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trial and conviction==
The trial of Harold Jones for the murder of Florence Irene Little began at Monmouthshire Assizes on 1 November 1921. He was tried before Mr. Justice Bray, with the prosecution contending this murder had been primarily committed due to Jones having enjoyed being "a part of the public eye" due to the attention he had received following his arrest and acquittal of Freda's murder weeks earlier,&lt;ref&gt;''A Question of Evidence: The Casebook of Great Forensic Controversies, from Napoleon to O.J.'' {{ISBN|0-471-44014-0}} p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; adding that he had made evident attempts to conceal evidence of the crime within his home after the murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://trove.nla.gov.au/newspaper/article/28007232|title=A Welsh Horror. Two little Girls Murdered; A Boy's Confession|access-date=8 September 2018|newspaper=nla.gov.au|date=3 November 1921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trial lasted just one hour; Jones was ordered to be detained at [[At Her Majesty's pleasure|His Majesty's pleasure]] as because he was under 16 at the time of conviction, he could not be subjected to any form of [[Capital punishment in the United Kingdom|capital punishment]].{{refn|group=n|In 1921, a sentence of to be detained at [[At Her Majesty's pleasure|His Majesty's pleasure]] held a compulsory [[parole]] review every five years, although the judge at Jones's trial emphasised that in this instance, a parole hearing would only be held every 10 years.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Shortly after Jones was escorted to prison to begin his sentence, a second written statement was read aloud to the court. This statement—also penned prior to his trial—read: "I, Harold Jones, wilfully and deliberately murdered Freda Burnell in Mortimer's Shed on 5 February 1921. The reason for this act was a desire to kill."&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 78&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
Harold Jones served 20 years of his imposed sentence of [[life imprisonment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.kentonline.co.uk/dartford/news/i-know-who-killed-girl-158735/|title=Author Neil Milkins Says He Knows who Killed Girl in Wood in 1946|access-date=19 September 2018|newspaper=kentonline.co.uk|date=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Against the recommendations of a [[psychiatrist]],&lt;ref&gt;''Exposing Jack the Stripper: A Biography of the Worst Serial Killer You've Probably Never Heard Of'' {{ISBN|978-1-492-21043-6}} p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; he was released from prison on [[parole]] on 6 December 1941 at age 35, and subsequently joined the [[Merchant Navy#British Merchant Navy|Merchant Navy]]. At the conclusion of the [[World War II|Second World War]], Jones briefly resided in [[Newport, Wales|Newport]],&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; although by 1948, he is known to have relocated to [[Fulham]], using the alias Harry Stevens. He later married and fathered a child.&lt;ref&gt;''Exposing Jack the Stripper: A Biography of the Worst Serial Killer You've Probably Never Heard Of'' {{ISBN|978-1-492-21043-6}} p. 176&lt;/ref&gt;

Jones died of bone cancer in 1971.&lt;ref&gt;''The Who's Who of British Crime: In the Twentieth Century'' {{ISBN|978-1-445-63924-6}} pp. 177-179&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45044159|title=Murdered Abertillery Girl's Niece Learnt About Tragedy in Book|access-date=11 September 2018|newspaper=BBC.co.uk|date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of his death, he was employed as a night watchman and living under the alias of Harry Jones, although before he died, he told his wife the name Harold Jones should be placed upon his death certificate.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the murder of Florence Little, his employer, Herbert Mortimer, closed his shop and relocated with his family from Abertillery to an unknown location. Reportedly, this decision was made due to both a mixture of ostracization from locals regarding the false testimony he had delivered at Jones's trial for the murder of Freda Burnell, and his own guilt that this false testimony had enabled Jones to subsequently remain at liberty and kill again.&lt;ref&gt;''Dark Valleys: Foul Deeds Among the South Wales Valleys 1845 - 2016'' {{ISBN|978-1-473-86181-7}} p. 88&lt;/ref&gt;

Both Freda Burnell and Florence Little were buried in Brynithel Cemetery. Their graves fell into a state of disrepair over the decades, although a 2017 appeal initiated by a local author named Neil Milkins to restore their graves and headstones raised more than £4,000, he having been inspired to do so after speaking to relatives of both girls, who were upset by the state of disrepair of the graves. The girls' graves were subsequently restored in 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-45044159|title=Murdered Abertillery Girl's Niece Learnt About Tragedy in Book|access-date=8 September 2018|newspaper=BBC.co.uk|date=4 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Shulov2.jpg|left|150px|thumb|[[Aharon Shulov]] and his wife, Yocheved, holding a [[Pythonidae|python]].]]

The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo opened in September 1940 as a small "animal corner" on Rabbi Kook Street in central Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="sbl"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sbl-site.org/publications/article.aspx?articleId=579 |title=The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo |last=Greenbaum |first=Avraham |date=August 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=[[Society of Biblical Literature]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NY"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?sec=travel&amp;res=9B03EFD71639F935A35750C0A965948260 |title=Jerusalem's Modern Ark |last=Kammen |first=Michael |date=6 March 1983 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The zoo was founded by [[Aharon Shulov]], a professor of [[zoology]] at the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]], [[Mount Scopus]]. Among Shulov's goals were to provide a research facility for his students; to gather animals, reptiles and birds mentioned in the Bible;&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://books.google.com/?id=hW_fAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Aharon+Shulov&amp;dq=Aharon+Shulov |title=Christian Victory |volume=56 |year=1982 |publisher=The Company |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, as he wrote in 1951, to break down the "invisible wall" between the intellectuals on Mount Scopus and the general public.&lt;ref&gt;Shulov, Aharon (1980). ''The Leopard''. Jerusalem: The Jerusalem Zoo Educational Series, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early on, the zoo ran into several difficulties in its decision to focus on animals mentioned in the Bible. For one, the meaning of many names of animals, reptiles and birds in Scriptures is often uncertain; for example, ''nesher'' ({{lang-he|נשר}}), commonly translated as "eagle", could also mean "vulture".&lt;ref name="sbl" /&gt; More significantly, many of the animals mentioned in the Bible are now [[Extinction|extinct]] in Israel due to over-hunting, destruction of natural habitats by rapid construction and development, illegal poisoning by farmers, and low birth rate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/life/religion/7003569.html |title=Doing Noah Proud |last=Grooters |first=Sarah |date=13 May 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=[[Houston Chronicle]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zoo planners decided to branch beyond strictly biblical animals and include worldwide [[endangered species]] as well.&lt;ref name="sbl" /&gt;

===Complaints from the neighbors===
[[File:Jerusalem Biblical Zoo 1940s.jpg|thumb|The zoo in the 1940s, probably on [[Shmuel HaNavi Street]]]]

The presence of the animal corner generated many complaints from residents in adjoining buildings due to the smell and noise, as well as the perceived danger of animal escapes. Due to the complaints, the zoo relocated in 1941 to a {{convert|4.5|dunam|hectare|adj=on}} lot on [[Shmuel HaNavi Street]]. Here, too, complaints were heard from the neighbors, but the zoo remained at this site for the next six years.&lt;ref name="sbl" /&gt;

In 1947 the zoo, which by now had 122 animals,&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt; relocated to a plot of land on [[Mount Scopus]] provided by Hebrew University. It remained there from 1947 to 1950. Its occupancy coincided with the [[1948 Arab-Israeli War]] and the [[Siege of Jerusalem (1948)|siege of Jerusalem]], when food for the city's population was at a premium. Zookeepers resorted to hunting down stray dogs near garbage dumps in order to feed the [[carnivore|carnivorous]] animals. Many of the carnivores died anyway, and other, non-dangerous species had to be released.&lt;ref name="sbl" /&gt;

As part of the [[1949 Armistice Agreements#With Jordan|Israel-Jordan Armistice Agreements of 1949]], access to Mount Scopus was restricted. The [[United Nations]] helped the zoo relocate&lt;ref name="sbl" /&gt; to a {{convert|15|hectare|ha|adj=on}} lot&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Articles/Attractions/The+Tisch+Family+Biblical+Zoo.htm |title=The Tisch Family Biblical Zoo |publisher=Israel Ministry of Tourism |accessdate=28 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117182422/http://goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Articles/Attractions/The+Tisch+Family+Biblical+Zoo.htm |archive-date=17 November 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; in Givat Komuna, adjacent to the present-day neighborhoods of [[Romema]] and [[Ezrat Torah]]. According to Shulov, when the zoo arrived in Romema, only two [[Wolf|wolves]], one [[hyena]], one [[lion]] and one [[leopard]] were left.&lt;ref name="sbl" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Shulov, Aharon (1981). ''The Wolf Shall Dwell with the Lamb: 40 years of the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo'' (in Hebrew). Jerusalem: Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

The zoo remained in Romema from 1950 to 1991, becoming a beloved Jerusalem institution. About 30&amp;nbsp;percent of its attendance came from [[Haredi Judaism|Haredi]] families from northern Jerusalem and [[Muslim]] families from [[East Jerusalem]]—two population groups that normally do not participate in the city's cultural offerings.&lt;ref name="born" /&gt; The zoo grew to {{convert|28|acre|ha}} and more than 200 species, including most of the 130 animals mentioned in the Bible. Thanks to its [[Captive breeding|breeding]] program, 11 species that had disappeared from Israel were [[Reintroduction|reintroduced]] into nature reserves around the country, including the [[Syrian brown bear]], the [[addax]], and two types of [[fallow deer]]. Through gifts, trades with other zoos, and its success at breeding, the zoo's collection exceeded 500 animals by 1967. During the [[Six-Day War]], however, 110 animals were killed by [[Shrapnel shell|shrapnel]] and stray bullets.&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt;

The zoo was administered by a [[nonprofit]] corporation with representatives from Hebrew University, the Jerusalem Municipality, and the Israeli [[Israeli Ministry of Tourism|Ministries of Tourism]] and [[Israeli Ministry of Education|Education]]. From a financial standpoint, however, the zoo had little money. Shulov, who retired as director in 1983,&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt; often served as director without pay. The zoo was also considered inferior to the zoos of Tel Aviv and Haifa.&lt;ref name="sbl" /&gt;

[[File:Teddy Jerusalem Zoo.jpg|thumb|Teddy the [[Asian elephant|elephant]], named in honor of Jerusalem mayor and zoo fund-raiser [[Teddy Kollek]].]]
Jerusalem mayor [[Teddy Kollek]], who took office in 1965, became one of the zoo's main supporters and fund-raisers through his [[Jerusalem Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=112016 |title=The Zoo's No. 1 Friend |last=Doron |first=Shai |date=4 February 2007 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kollek promoted the idea of moving the zoo to a larger location and upgrading it to a state-of-the-art institution, as well as a tourist site that would appeal to secular and religious [[Jews|Jewish]] families and [[Arab]] families alike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://venetec.com/Israel/ |title=Israel |year=2010 |publisher=Price Family Charitable Fund |accessdate=28 November 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1990, under the auspices of the Jerusalem Foundation, the Tisch family of New York agreed to pay $5&amp;nbsp;million toward the $30&amp;nbsp;million cost of the project. Another $10&amp;nbsp;million was raised through sale of the lot in Romema, which was converted to housing. The Jerusalem municipality, the Israel Ministry of Tourism, the Jerusalem Foundation, and private sponsors also contributed.&lt;ref name="born" /&gt; The zoo closed its site in Romema in 1991 and reopened in the [[Malha]] valley, {{convert|7|km}} southwest of the city center,&lt;ref name="born" /&gt; in 1993.&lt;ref name="sbl" /&gt;

== The zoo today ==

The zoo, renamed the Tisch Family Zoological Gardens in Jerusalem, but still called the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo by the general public, opened for a preview period on 28 February 1993. It officially opened on 9 September 1993.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalemzoo.org.il/len/apage/11017.php |title=About the Zoo |publisher=Jerusalem Zoo |year=2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design and layout===
Designed by Miller-Blum &amp; Associates Landscape Architects, and constructed by the [[Moriah Jerusalem Development Corporation]],&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; the zoo sits on {{convert|62|acre|ha}} in a valley surrounded by the hillside neighborhoods of [[Malha]] and [[Givat Masua]].&lt;ref name="life" /&gt;  The park is landscaped with trees and shrubs native to Israel, many of which are mentioned in the Bible.

[[File:Jerusalem Zoo train.jpg|left|thumb|The zoo train]]
The zoo is built on two main levels. A motorized train takes visitors on a circular route from the lower level to the upper level. The entire park is [[wheelchair-accessible]]; each train can also accommodate one wheelchair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yadsarah.org/index.asp?id=162 |title=The Biblical Zoo in Jerusalem – An Exciting Experience for Everyone |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=[[Yad Sarah]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The centerpiece of the lower level is an [[artificial lake]] which includes two islands of monkey exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_sys/picture/atarim/site_form_atar_eng.asp?site_id=18&amp;pic_cat=4&amp;icon_cat=6&amp;york_cat=7 |title=Biblical Zoo – The Tisch Family Zoological Gardens |date=22 March 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=Jerusalem Municipality |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110106121612/http://www.jerusalem.muni.il/jer_sys/picture/atarim/site_form_atar_eng.asp?site_id=18&amp;pic_cat=4&amp;icon_cat=6&amp;york_cat=7 |archive-date=6 January 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The lake is fed by a series of pools and waterfalls,&lt;ref name="about" /&gt; beginning at an [[artificial waterfall]] called "Moses' Rock" (an allusion to the well of [[Miriam]] which provided water for the [[Israelites]] during their 40-year sojourn in the desert). Water is recycled and pumped back to Moses' Rock through an underground system.&lt;ref name="born" /&gt;

At the western end of the park stands a two-story, boat-shaped wooden visitor's center meant to resemble [[Noah's Ark]]. It contains an auditorium, an art gallery, a gift shop, a snack bar, and computer stations providing information on animals mentioned in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jposttravel.com/Christianity-in-Israel/Bible-animals.html |title=Bible Animals are Still Found in Israel |last=Hecht |first=Aaron |year=2009 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=The Jerusalem Post |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101124063034/http://jposttravel.com/Christianity-in-Israel/Bible-animals.html |archive-date=24 November 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zoo operates several snack bars and a coffee shop. Picnic tables and benches are situated throughout the park. There is also an animal-themed jungle gym for children and a sculpture garden containing 23&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://designistdream.com/page/11/ |title=Where the Wild Things Art |date=4 November 2007 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=designistdream.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110709014942/http://designistdream.com/page/11/ |archivedate=9 July 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; phantasmagorical animal sculptures decorated with stones, mirrors, and mosaics,&lt;ref name="crowne" /&gt; which double as climbing toys, designed by [[French people|French]] sculptor [[Niki de Saint Phalle]], together with an underground Noah's Ark sculpture designed by Swiss architect Mario Botta.&lt;ref name="born" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ci.escondido.ca.us/events/califia/chronology.pdf |title=Niki de Saint Phalle Chronology (1930–2002) |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=ci.escondido.ca.us |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117065506/http://www.ci.escondido.ca.us/events/califia/chronology.pdf |archivedate=17 November 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children can also view [[three dimensional|3D]] films of animals in a small theater near the entrance to the zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cruisecritic.com/ports/newport.cfm?ID=470 |title=Been There, Done That |year=2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=The Independent Traveler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal exhibits===
The traditional zoo infrastructure of bars and cages has been replaced by open areas separated from the public by trenches, [[moat]]s, bridges, and glass windows; outdoor exhibits also have an indoor shelter in case of bad weather.&lt;ref name="born"&gt;{{cite book |url= https://books.google.com/?id=bYsQvLkzRyoC&amp;pg=PA96&amp;dq=jerusalem+biblical+zoo+romema#v=onepage&amp;q=jerusalem%20biblical%20zoo%20romema&amp;f=false |title=Born Again |last=Oestermann |first=Richard |publisher=Gefen Books |date=June 1999 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |isbn= 978-965-229-214-8  |pages=94–98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only areas in which the public has direct contact with the animals are [[Lemur]] Land, the "petting pool" at the Wet Side Story aquatic exhibit, and the children's zoo, where children can pet and feed [[pygmy goat]]s, [[sheep]], [[rabbit]]s and [[guinea pig]]s.

[[File:Jerusalem Zoo Arabian oryx.jpg|thumb|[[Scimitar oryx]] roam in an open reserve.]]
Animals and birds reside in natural habitats, from an African savannah to a tropical rain forest to the underground world of mice and cockroaches. The [[lesser kestrel]] exhibit is designed as a house in Jerusalem's [[Musrara, Jerusalem|Morasha]] district, formerly a major nesting ground for these birds.&lt;ref name="Tisch2009" /&gt; Each animal or bird which is mentioned in the Bible has a biblical verse in [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]], [[Arabic language|Arabic]] and [[English language|English]] appended to its information sign.&lt;ref name="askmen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ie.askmen.com/top_10/travel_top_ten/44c_travel_top_ten.html  |title=Top 10: Zoos – Number 4: Jerusalem Biblical Zoo, Jerusalem, Israel |last=Marks |first=Harry |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=[[AskMen.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Behind the scenes, the zoo operates an animal medical center with surgery, recovery and treatment rooms, a laboratory, and a [[quarantine]] unit where incoming animals and zoo animals being sent to other zoos are tested for diseases. This medical center cares for all zoo animals except the elephants, giraffes, rhinoceroses, hippopotamus, and bison, which are treated in their own exhibits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalemzoo.org.il/len/apage/11019.php |title=Zoo Hospital |publisher=Jerusalem Zoo |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The parking lot accommodates 500 vehicles.&lt;ref name="born" /&gt; The city named the street astride the zoo Derech Aharon Shulov (Aharon Shulov Way) after the zoo's founder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.koogle.co.il/English/Businesses/Zoos--Animal-Farms |title=Zoos and Animal Farms |publisher=koogle.co.il |accessdate=28 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091009213241/http://www.koogle.co.il/English/Businesses/Zoos--Animal-Farms |archive-date=9 October 2009 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Animal species===
As of 2009, the zoo housed 2,200 animals representing 271 different species: 60 fish species, 68 mammal species, 28 reptile species, 11 amphibian species, and 104 bird species. Many species were introduced only in the last few years, as the collection numbered 208 species in 2007.&lt;ref name="attraction" /&gt;

===Food sources===
[[File:Jerusalem Zoo Nubian ibex.jpg|thumb|[[Nubian ibex]] at feeding time]]

The massive amount of fruits and vegetables consumed daily by the zoo's animals are acquired free of charge through an agreement Shulov worked out with Israeli companies that [[Terumat hamaaser|tithe]] their produce in accordance with [[Halakha|Jewish law]].&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt; During the days of the [[Temple in Jerusalem]], ''[[Heave offering|terumah]]'', a tithe on agricultural produce, was designated for the [[Kohen|kohanim]] (priests) and their animals. After the destruction of the Temple, the rabbis decreed that the tithed produce could not be used and had to be destroyed. The animals of the Biblical Zoo were symbolically sold to a [[Kohen]] so that this tithed produce could be given to them.&lt;ref name=ohr&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ohr.edu/judaism/nature-apikorsas/natur007.htm|title=The Torah Universe: Great Apes and Wild Men|last=Slifkin|first=Nosson|year=1999|publisher=[[Ohr Somayach, Jerusalem|Ohr Somayach International]]|access-date=28 November 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629133141/http://ohr.edu/judaism/nature-apikorsas/natur007.htm|archive-date=29 June 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jewishrootscx.netfirms.com/the_biblical_tithe.htm |title=The Biblical Tithe...Taught Correctly |last=Lyons |first=Craig |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=Jewish Roots |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101215161221/http://jewishrootscx.netfirms.com/the_biblical_tithe.htm |archive-date=15 December 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The animals of the Biblical Zoo receive nearly a ton of the choicest fruits and vegetables every day&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/pleasure-hunting/.premium-1.535221 |title=Animal attraction|first=Ronit|last=Vered|work=[[Haaretz]]|date=11 July 2013|accessdate=15 September 2013}}(subscription)&lt;/ref&gt; through a distribution handled by the local religious council.&lt;ref name=ohr/&gt; Meat consumed by the carnivores is furnished by [[kashrut|kosher]] butchers, [[veterinarian]]s, and [[fishermen]].&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt; Pruned branches from edible plants in the park, such as date palms, olive trees and carob trees, are also used for [[fodder]].&lt;ref name="green"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalemzoo.org.il/var/360/312287-104.pdf|title=Green Team |last=Kaufman |first=Dr. Elizabeth |date=June 2009 |publisher=Profile (newsletter of the Tisch Family Zoological Gardens in Jerusalem)|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zoo sees its primary goal as the conservation of [[endangered species]].&lt;ref name="reintro"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://jerusalemzoo.org.il/len/apage/11046.php |title=Animal Reintroductions |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=jerusalemzoo.org.il}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include animals mentioned in the Bible which are now extinct in Israel, such as the [[Asian lion]], the [[Syrian brown bear]], the [[Asiatic cheetah]], the [[Nile crocodile]], and the [[Persian fallow deer]].&lt;ref name="fodor"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fodors.com/world/africa-and-middle-east/israel/jerusalem/review-190726.html |title=Tisch Family Zoological Gardens |year=2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=[[Fodor's]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes endangered species worldwide, such as the [[Asian elephant]], rare species of [[macaw]],&lt;ref name="fodor" /&gt; the [[cockatiel]], the [[ibis]], and the [[golden lion tamarin]].

Towards that end, the zoo undertakes to [[Captive breeding|breed animals in captivity]] and, in some cases, reintroduce them to the wild. Through this program, the zoo has successfully increased the number of Persian fallow deer in Israel. This species was thought to be extinct in the 20th century until a small number of deer were located in [[Iran]] in 1956. In 1978, four of these deer were brought to Israel and have since increased to several hundred, with a major breeding colony at the Jerusalem Biblical Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aronheller.com/documents/articles/ap/ASAP/asap%20-%20biblical%20zoo.htm |title=At the Zoo, Two-By-Two |last=Heller |first=Aron |date=8 March 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=[[Associated Press]] |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707163112/http://www.aronheller.com/documents/articles/ap/ASAP/asap%20-%20biblical%20zoo.htm |archive-date=7 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A concurrent project to protect the [[Kleinmann's tortoise|Negev tortoise]] from extinction involves breeding from artificially-incubated eggs.&lt;ref name="Tisch2007" /&gt;

At the zoo's National Center for Artificial Incubation of Raptor Eggs, eggs of [[Bird of prey|raptor]]s that are either extinct or severely decimated in Israel are incubated from captive-breeding pairs.&lt;ref name="Tisch2007"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalemfoundation.org/uploads/%5Ccoexistence%5Cfrom%20arts%20to%20sports%5Ctisch%20zoological%20gardens%5CZoo%202007%20Annual%20Report.pdf |title=Hey Deer, Have You Heard About the Happenings at the Tisch Family Zoological Gardens in 2007? |year=2007 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=Jerusalem Foundation }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[griffon vulture]], an endangered species, is the subject of much research activity.

The zoo conducts a small ceremony each time it returns a bird to the wild. In 1996, for the release of a griffon vulture which it named "Freedom", the zoo invited the mother of captured [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[navigator]] [[Ron Arad (pilot)|Ron Arad]] to help release the bird.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sandiegojewishworld.com/israel/jerusalem/biblical_zoo/19981211-biblical_zoo.htm |title=Judaic Park: S.D.

[[File:Asian Elephant and Baby.JPG|left|thumb|The year-old [[Gabi (elephant)|Gabi]] (left) with his mother Tamar in the elephant enclosure, January 2007.]]
The zoo is considered a world leader and educator in reproductive intervention.&lt;ref name="protecting"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.israel21c.org/environment/jerusalem-biblical-zoo-a-world-leader-in-protecting-endangered-species |title=Jerusalem Biblical Zoo a World Leader in Protecting Endangered Species |last=Eisen |first=Sarah K. |date=28 June 2007 |publisher=Israel21c}}&lt;/ref&gt; It achieved a major success in December 2005 with the birth of [[Gabi (elephant)|Gabi]], the first [[elephant]] conceived in Israel through [[Artificial insemination#Artificial insemination in livestock and pets|artificial insemination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/International/Article.aspx?id=190086 |title=Israeli ‘aid ships’ carry 4-legged animals to Turkey |last=Lidman |first=Melanie |date=4 October 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conjunction with a team from the Reproduction Management Institute for Zoo Biology and Wildlife Research of Berlin, zoo veterinarians impregnated one of their female elephants, Tamar, with [[sperm]] obtained from Emmett, a bull elephant in the [[Whipsnade Zoo|Whipsnade Animal Park]], [[Bedfordshire]], [[England]].&lt;ref name="protecting" /&gt; On 10 December 2005, Gabi's six-hour birth was viewed by over 350,000 people in 108 countries via [[Streaming media|live streaming]] on the zoo's website.&lt;ref name="life" /&gt;

The zoo has also pioneered the use of animal birth control. It was the first to use a [[Tranquilliser gun|dart gun]] to implant a slow-release hormone into the thigh of a female giraffe; she is the daughter of the zoo's bull giraffe, and inbreeding is inadvisable. The zoo uses slow-release hormones to control its [[chimpanzee]] and [[mandrill]] populations, which are reproducing too quickly for the space they occupy; letting the animals multiply and sending family members to other zoos is unwise, according to veterinarians.&lt;ref name="protecting" /&gt;

Newborn animals that are threatened or ignored by their parents are raised by the veterinary staff. On 31 December 2008, for example, a newborn tiger cub ignored by its mother was taken home by a staff member to be bottle-fed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.zooborns.com/zooborns/jerusalem-biblical-zoo/ |title=One Big Kitten: Tiger cub at the Jerusalem Zoo |date=12 March 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=zooborns.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewere.com/blog/2009/02/27/week-in-photos-tiger-cub-pancake-race-more/ |title=Feb 27 Week in Photos: Tiger Cub, Pancake Race, More |year=2008 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=Interesting Things}}&lt;/ref&gt; A newborn leopard rejected by its mother spent its days at the zoo and nights at veterinarians' homes for its first three and a half months of life.&lt;ref name=kohn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jawscience.webs.com/aprdrelishevakaufman.htm |title=Dr. Elizabeth (Elisheva) Kaufman |year=2009 |publisher=Jewish Alliance for Women in Science |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zoo also provides medical treatment for animals and birds injured in the wild.&lt;ref name="Tisch2006"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalemfoundation.org/uploads/%5Ccoexistence%5Cfrom%20arts%20to%20sports%5Ctisch%20zoological%20gardens%5Cthe%20tisch%20family%20zoo%20-%202006%20report.pdf |title=Tisch Family Zoological Gardens – 2006 Report |publisher=Jerusalem Foundation |year=2006 |accessdate=28 November 2010 }}{{dead link|date=November 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The wildlife is either released back to their natural environment (if they are healthy enough) or placed in other zoos. In the late 2000s, an [[aviary]] was built for [[eagle owl]]s which the zoo is nursing back to health.&lt;ref name="Tisch2007" /&gt;

===Public education===
[[File:Jerusalem Zoo snake exhibit.jpg|left|thumb|Children view a [[snake]] behind protective glass.]]

Public education is another prime focus of the zoo. According to Shai Doron, director-general of the zoo since 1993,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/magazine/the-human-zoo-1.314357 |title=The Human Zoo |last=Saar |first=Yuval |date=17 September 2010 |publisher=Haaretz|accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Our moral right to exist comes from educating and raising the awareness of our visitors."&lt;ref name="life" /&gt;

Many [[Israelis]], both Jewish and Arab, are not familiar with zoos and get "overexcited" at seeing the animals on display.&lt;ref name="NY" /&gt; Dozens of zoo personnel man the displays during peak holiday times to stop visitors from throwing food and other items at the animals. The animals do have a preference for [[Bamba (snack)|Bamba]], the popular children's peanut-and-corn snack (though it gives the monkeys [[diarrhea]]); other common projectiles include bottles, plastic bags, and children's shoes.&lt;ref name="beastly"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.jpost.com/home/article.aspx?id=21496 |title=Beastly Behavior |last=Alexander-Hurst |first=Nina |date=11 May 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997 a [[toco toucan]] was found dead in its cage next to pieces of [[avocado]], a known bird [[toxin]].&lt;ref name="beastly" /&gt; In 2006 a [[hippopotamus]] died after swallowing a tennis ball tossed into its enclosure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jpost.com/Home/Article.aspx?id=20914 |title= Hippopotamus swallows ball, dies at Biblical Zoo |date=5 May 2006 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=The Jerusalem Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the past decade and a half, the zoo staff claims that public awareness has improved.&lt;ref name="beastly" /&gt;

Through visiting school groups, after-school groups, special-education groups and summer camps, children learn about and interact with the animals.&lt;ref name="born" /&gt; Educational activities for children, including the zoo's own youth movement, promote interracial encounters between Arab and Jewish youth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Articles/Attractions/The+Tisch+Family+Biblical+Zoo.htm |title=The Tisch Family Biblical Zoo |publisher=Israel Ministry of Tourism |accessdate=28 November 2010 |year=2005 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101117182422/http://goisrael.com/Tourism_Eng/Articles/Attractions/The+Tisch+Family+Biblical+Zoo.htm |archive-date=17 November 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The zoo also mounts a traveling workshop called the Zoomobile, which brings small animals in cages and a sound system carrying the sounds of larger animals to schools, hospitals, and other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.zoonews.co.uk/IZN/328/IZN-328.htm |title=The Itinerant Ark: Insights from the Wandering Zoo |last=Ben-David |first=Na'ama Y. |volume=50 |issue=7 |date=October–November 2003 |publisher=International Zoo News |accessdate=28 November 2010 |journal= |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120308105615/http://www.zoonews.co.uk/IZN/328/IZN-328.htm |archive-date=8 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Environmental awareness===
[[File:Jerusalem Zoo Wet Side Story.jpg|thumb|An animated water droplet projected onto a cascade of running water "talks" to visitors at the Wet Side Story aquatic exhibit.]]

The zoo teaches [[environmentalism]] both in its exhibits and by personal example. Since 1997&lt;ref&gt;Dedication plaque at entrance to ecological maze.&lt;/ref&gt; it has featured an "ecological maze"&lt;ref name="crowne" /&gt; &amp;ndash; a short path meandering through high bushes with signs that highlight ecological challenges in Israel. In spring 2010 it unveiled a $1.5&amp;nbsp;million aquatic exhibit called "Wet Side Story"&lt;ref name="beach"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.haaretz.com/print-edition/features/everything-but-the-beach-1.291620 |title=Everything but the beach |last=Lis |first=Jonathan |date=23 May 2010 |publisher=Haaretz |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; which stresses the importance of water conservation, ecology awareness, and water challenges in the [[Middle East]] and around the world.&lt;ref name="Tisch2009" /&gt; This exhibit displays rare and endangered marine life&lt;ref name="beach" /&gt; in 17 large [[aquarium]]s and three huge water tanks measuring 2 x 4 metres (7 x 14&amp;nbsp;ft). There is also an outdoor "petting pool" where visitors can touch and feed [[koi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.resistnet.com/group/istandwithisrael/forum/topics/if-pa-declares-state-israel?page=1&amp;commentId=2600775%3AComment%3A1799042&amp;x=1#2600775Comment1799042 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20110807162047/http://www.resistnet.com/group/istandwithisrael/forum/topics/if-pa-declares-state-israel?page=1&amp;commentId=2600775:Comment:1799042&amp;x=1%232600775Comment1799042#2600775Comment1799042 |dead-url=yes|title='Wet Side Story' Opens at Jerusalem Biblical Zoo |last=Julian |first=Hana Levi |date=17 November 2009 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=resistnet.com }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In keeping with its "green" policy, the zoo maintains its own [[sewage treatment]] system and uses [[Reclaimed water|recycled water]] to irrigate its gardens. Food and animal waste are mixed with plant material and placed in large [[compost]] piles; the compost is used to [[Fertilization|fertilize]] the trees and shrubs.&lt;ref name="Tisch2009" /&gt; The zoo sells its organic compost in the gift shop.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt; In 2006 receptacles for collecting used plastic drink bottles were installed next to each of the snack bars, and used batteries are collected at the gift shop.&lt;ref name="Tisch2006" /&gt; To reduce [[carbon emission]]s and traffic, the zoo schedules the use of delivery and security vehicles.&lt;ref name="green" /&gt;

==Research==
The Jerusalem Biblical Zoo participates in national and international research projects in the fields of zoology, biology, and environmental science, and publishes papers in journals and at scientific meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Feline Central Retinal Degeneration in Captive Cheetahs (Acinonyx Jubatus) |last1=Ofri |first1=Ron |last2=Barishak |first2=Robert Y. |last3=Eshkar |first3=Gabi |last4=Aizenberg |first4=Itzhak |journal=Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine |volume=27 |issue=1 |pages=101–108 |date=March 1996 |jstor=20095551}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.mivelle.hu/sambucol/Effect%20in%20Chimpanzees.pdf |title=The Effect of Sambucol on Flu-like Symptoms in Chimpanzees: Prophylactic and symptom-dependent treatment |last1=Burge |first1=Beverly |last2=Mumcuoglu |first2=Madeleine |last3=Simmons |first3=Tal |journal=International Zoo News |volume=46 |issue=1 |year=1999 |pages=16–19 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721111803/http://www.mivelle.hu/sambucol/Effect%20in%20Chimpanzees.pdf |archive-date=21 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://library.vetmed.fu-berlin.de/resources/global/contents/VET164623/EAZWV/Parijs%20PDF/Microsoft%20Word%20-%20Eshkar.pdf |title=Periodic Recurrent Keratitis in Asian Elephants |last1=Eshkar |first1=G. |last2=Avni-Magen |first2=N. |last3=Ofri |first3=R. |publisher=European Association of Zoo and Wildlife Veterinarians, Third Scientific Meeting |date=31 May – 4 June 2000 |accessdate=28 November 2010 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:18432106 |title=Use of a sustained release preparation of clotrimazole to treat dermatophytosis in a siamang (Hylobates syndactylus) |last1=Avni-Magen |first1=Nili |last2=Elad |first2=Daniel |last3=Friedman |first3=Michael |last4=Gati |first4=Irith |last5=Kaufman |first5=Elizabeth |last6=Lavy |first6=Eran |journal=Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine |date=March 2008 |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=115–117 |doi=10.1638/2007-0018.1 |pmid=18432106 |access-date=28 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314020546/http://lib.bioinfo.pl/pmid:18432106 |archive-date=14 March 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://zoowildlifejournal.com/doi/abs/10.1638/2010-0004.1 |last1=Bakal-Weiss |first1=Meytal |last2=Steinberg |first2=Doron |last3=Friedman |first3=Michael |last4=Gati |first4=Irith |last5=Avni-Magen |first5=Nili |last6=Kaufman |first6=Elizabeth |last7=Lavy |first7=Eran |date=June 2010 |title=Use of a Sustained Release Chlorhexidine Varnish as Treatment of Oral Necrobacillosis in Macropus spp | journal=Journal of Zoo and Wildlife Medicine |volume=41 |issue=2 |pages=371–373 |doi=10.1638/2010-0004.1 |pmid=20597238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through its Aharon Shulov Fund for the Study of Animals in Captivity, it also provides grants for research on animal welfare and husbandry, animal reintroduction, reproduction of endangered species, [[conservation genetics]], and exotic animal nutrition and medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalemzoo.org.il/len/apage/11400.php |title=List of research projects |publisher=Jerusalem Biblical Zoo |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fund is sponsored by Shulov's family, the Friends of the Zoo Association, and the Jerusalem Zoo.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jerusalemzoo.org.il/len/apage/11047.php |title=Shulov Fund |publisher=Jerusalem Zoo |accessdate=28 November 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131104100521/http://www.jerusalemzoo.org.il/len/apage/11047.php |archivedate= 4 November 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The zoo hosts academic seminars and student research at the Gabi Center, located in a {{convert|21|sqft|m2|adj=on}} facility inside the main entrance. The center was named in memory of Dr. Gabi Eshkar, deputy director-general and chief veterinarian of the zoo for over 17 years, who was killed in an automobile accident in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jerusalemzoo.org.il/len/apage/11020.php |title=Gabi Center |publisher=Jerusalem Zoo |accessdate=28 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Visitors and volunteers==
[[File:Jerusalem Zoo petting.jpg|thumb|A boy tries to pet the [[goat]]s at the children's petting zoo.]]

A record 738,000 people visited the zoo in 2009.&lt;ref name="attraction" /&gt; The zoo does a brisk business in tourist groups, school groups, and summer camps: over 120,000 visitors arrived in groups in 2009. Included in the total are 63 groups of [[special needs|special-needs]] children, both Jewish and Arab,&lt;ref name="Tisch2006" /&gt; who participate in weekly sessions of [[animal-assisted therapy]].&lt;ref name="Tisch2009" /&gt; Total capacity in the park is 11,000 visitors.&lt;ref name="crowne"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.afi-hotels.com/Crowne_Plaza_Jerusalem_Attractions |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707093526/http://www.afi-hotels.com/Crowne_Plaza_Jerusalem_Attractions |dead-url=yes |archive-date=7 July 2011 |title=Attractions in the Region: Jerusalem Biblical Zoo |accessdate=28 November 2010 |publisher=[[Crowne Plaza]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special events===
The zoo, which is open every day of the year except [[Yom Kippur]], [[Yom HaShoah]], and [[Yom Hazikaron]], schedules special activities on selected dates. Tree-planting activities are an annual [[Tu Bishvat]] tradition. On both days of [[Purim]] there is a parade, a family costume competition, and a [[tug of war]] between the entire [[Hapoel Jerusalem B.C.|Hapoel Jerusalem Basketball Team]] and one of the elephants (the elephant always wins). On Israel's [[Elections in Israel|Election Day]], zoo goers are encouraged to vote for their favorite animal.&lt;ref name="Tisch2006" /&gt; During the summer, the zoo conducts tours of [[Nocturnality|nocturnal]] animals in the wee hours of the night. It also schedules jazz concerts, juggling, and workshops during school vacations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.funinjerusalem.com/fun-list-categories/106-biblical-zoo.html49353-kids20with20sheep/?lang=en&amp;font-size=smaller |title=Biblical Zoo |publisher=funinjerusalem.com |date=23 February 2010 |accessdate=28 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110711054058/http://www.funinjerusalem.com/fun-list-categories/106-biblical-zoo.html49353-kids20with20sheep/?lang=en&amp;font-size=smaller |archive-date=11 July 2011 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Expansion plans==
The [[Strategic planning|master plan]] for expansion is drafted by the zoo's main planning body, the International Zoological Committee, which is staffed by professionals in wildlife conservation, zoo management, education, tourism and economics. This committee convened in 1993, before the reopening of the zoo, and again in 1996, when it drafted plans for adding additional animal exhibits and visitor attractions by 2010.&lt;ref name="life" /&gt;

New plans have been drawn up for an educational center and an exhibit called ''Yemei Bereishit'' (In the Days of Genesis) which replicates Biblical conditions and excludes all modern devices, including cell phones. The $30&amp;nbsp;million project will be paid for by private donations.&lt;ref name="life" /&gt;

[[File:Marciano Genérico.JPG|thumb|An artist's depiction of the "little green man" described in the novel ''[[Martians, Go Home]]'']]
'''Little green men''' is the [[stereotypical]] portrayal of [[extraterrestrials]] as little [[humanoid]]-like creatures with green skin and sometimes with antennae on their heads. The term is also sometimes used to describe [[gremlin]]s, mythical creatures known for causing problems in airplanes and mechanical devices. Today, these creatures are more commonly associated with an alleged alien species called [[Grey alien|greys]], whose skin color is described as not green, but grey.

During the reports of [[flying saucer]]s in the 1950s, the term "little green men" came into popular usage in reference to aliens. In one classic case, the [[Kelly-Hopkinsville encounter|Kelly-Hopkinsville sighting]] in 1955, two rural [[Kentucky]] men described a supposed encounter with metallic-silver, somewhat humanoid-looking aliens no more than {{convert|4|ft|sigfig=1}} in height. Employing journalistic licence and deviating from the witnesses' accounts, many newspaper articles used the term "little green men" in writing up the story.

==Extraterrestrial definition==
[[File:Fantastic Novels cover January 1951.jpg|thumb|Extraterrestrials in [[Arthur Leo Zagat]]'s novel ''Drink We Deep'' depicted as little green men on the cover of the January 1951 issue of ''[[Fantastic Novels]]'']]

Usage of the term clearly predates the 1955 incident; for example, in England reference to little green men or children dates back to the 12th century [[green children of Woolpit]], though exactly when the term was first applied to extraterrestrial aliens has been difficult to pin down. Folklore researcher Chris Aubeck has used electronic searches of old newspapers and found a number of instances dating from around the turn of the 20th century referring to green aliens. Aubeck found one story from 1899 in the ''[[Atlanta Constitution]]'', about a little green-skinned alien, in a tale called ''Green Boy From Hurrah'', "Hurrah" being another planet, perhaps Mars. [[Edgar Rice Burroughs]] referred to the "green men of Mars" and "green Martian women" in his first 1912 science fiction [[novel]] ''[[A Princess of Mars]]'',&lt;ref name="aubeck"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://caubeck.tripod.com/littlegreenmen/index.html|title=Chris Aubeck website summarizing search for early use of little green men term|author=Chris Aubeck|accessdate=2007-07-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; though at 10 to 12 feet tall, they were hardly "little". However, the first use of the specific phrase "little green man" in reference to extraterrestrials that Aubeck found dates to 1908 in the ''Daily Kennebec Journal'' (Augusta, Maine), in this case the aliens again being Martians.&lt;ref name="aubeck"/&gt; In 1910 (or 1915), a "little green man" was allegedly captured from his crashed spaceship in [[Apulia]], in south-east Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufoinfo.com/humanoid/humanoid1910.shtml |title=1910–1919 Humanoid Sighting Reports |publisher=Ufoinfo.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geocities.com/nmdecke/MysteriousWorld.html |title=Our Mysterious World-a collection of weirdness |publisher=[[Web.archive.org]] |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17 |deadurl=unfit |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071211005020/http://www.geocities.com/nmdecke/MysteriousWorld.html |archivedate=December 11, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Green aliens soon came to commonly portray extraterrestrials and adorned the covers of many of the 1920s to 1950s science fiction [[pulp magazine]]s with pictures of [[Buck Rogers]] and [[Flash Gordon]] battling green alien monsters. The first documented print example specifically linking "little green men" to extraterrestrial [[spacecraft|spaceship]]s is in a newspaper column satirizing the public panic following [[Orson Welles]]' famous [[The War of the Worlds (radio)|War of the Worlds]] [[Halloween]] broadcast of October 31, 1938. The column by reporter [https://web.archive.org/web/20090307075535/http://www.ap.org/cleartime/b.html Bill Barnard] in the [[Corpus Christi Caller-Times|Corpus Christi ''Times'']] the next day begins, "Thirteen little green men from Mercury stepped out of their space ship at Cliff Maus Field [local airport] late yesterday afternoon for a good-will visit to [[Corpus Christi, Texas|Corpus Christi]]" and ends with, "Then the 13 little green men got in their space ship and flew away."&lt;ref&gt;Corpus Christi ''Times'', November 1, 1938, page 1, available at electronic newspaper archives of [http://www.ancestry.com Ancestry.com]&lt;/ref&gt; The familiarity with which the term was used suggests that this probably was not the first instance where it was applied to extraterrestrials in spaceships.

In 1946, Harold M. Sherman published a pulp science fiction book entitled ''The Green Man: A Visitor From Space''. The cover illustration was of a normal-looking and proportioned human being, albeit with a green skin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ufopop.org/fullimgbk.php?cid=TheGreenManVisitorFromSpace1946.jpg |title=Cover illustration |publisher=Ufopop.org |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nationally syndicated columns by humorist Hal Boyle spoke of a green man from Mars in his flying saucer in early July 1947 during the height of the brand new flying saucer phenomenon in the U.S. that started June 24 after [[Kenneth Arnold Unidentified Flying Object Sighting|Kenneth Arnold's famous sighting]] and the [[Roswell UFO incident]]. However, Boyle did not describe his green Martian as "small".

In 1951, a science fiction book titled "The Case of the Little Green Men" was published by [[Mack Reynolds]], telling of a private detective hired to investigate disguised aliens living among the human population. As he was being hired, the detective referred derisively and familiarly to the aliens in the flying saucers being "little green men". The cover illustration is notable for depicting the LGM with the classic antennae sticking out of the head. Mack Reynolds would go on to write the first ''[[Star Trek]]'' novel in 1968 (''[[Mission to Horatius]]'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://ufopop.org/fullimgbk.php?cid=CaseOfTheLGM.jpg Cover illustration];[https://www.amazon.com/dp/1605431559 Excerpt of book &amp; author background]&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1950, stories began circulating in newspapers about little beings being recovered from flying saucer crashes. Though largely considered to be hoaxes, some of the stories from the sources about little aliens eventually made it into the popular 1950 book ''[[Behind the Flying Saucers]]'' by [[Variety (magazine)|Variety magazine]] columnist [[Frank Scully]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://scifipedia.scifi.com/index.php/Behind_the_Flying_Saucers Scifipedia: ''Behind the Flying Saucers''] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20071115042459/http://scifipedia.scifi.com/index.php/Behind_the_Flying_Saucers |date=2007-11-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A witness reporting a flying saucer sighting to a [[Wichita, Kansas]] newspaper in June 1950 stated that he saw "absolutely no little green men with egg on their whiskers".&lt;ref&gt;Wichita ''Eagle'', June 30, 1950, reproduced in USAF [[Project Blue Book]] report [http://bluebookarchive.org/page.aspx?PageCode=NARA-PBB90-1351]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="vs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufoupdateslist.com/2005/jan/m13-006.shtml |title=Re: 'Little Green Men'? |publisher=Ufoupdateslist.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, electronic searches show that "little green men" was specifically used in reference to science fiction and flying saucers by at least 1951 in the ''[[New York Times]]'' and ''[[Washington Post]]'' (in the ''Post'', a book review of a mystery/science fiction novel called ''The Little Green Man''), and 1952 in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' and the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' (the ''Tribune'' mocking flying saucer reports using a "little green man with pink polka dots"). The next example of the ''New York Times'' using the term dates from 1955 in a book review of a sci-fi satire called ''Martians, Go Home''. The Martians were obnoxious "little green men" whose appearance was "true to prophecy".

In a later example, following a nationally publicized flurry of UFO sightings in November 1957, syndicated Washington columnist Frederick Othman wrote: "New Flying Saucer Epidemic On. All over this land again are flying saucers ... No little green men have climbed out of these celestial vehicles so far, but in another couple of days I wouldn't be surprised&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref&gt;Example column in Austin (Texas) ''Statesman'', November 9, 1957; referenced at [http://www.ufoupdateslist.com/2004/feb/m29-008.shtml Ufoupdates]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins and other uses==
The term also shows up much earlier in other contexts. Movie gossip columnist [[Hedda Hopper]] used it in 1939 referring to small cast members of the [[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]], and admonished against drinking on the set. In 1942, the ''Los Angeles Times'' used the term in a pictorial on Marines training for jungle combat. In this case, "little green men" referred to [[camouflage]]d Japanese soldiers. The ''Washington Post'' in 1942 likewise used the term "little green man" in reference to a camouflaged Japanese [[sniper]] who nearly killed one of their war correspondents.

Before its more modern application to aliens, ''little green men'' was commonly used to describe various [[supernatural]] beings in old legends and folklore and in later fairy tales and children's books such as [[goblin]]s. Aubeck noted several examples of the latter in 19th and early 20th century literature. As an example, [[Rudyard Kipling]] had a "little green man" in ''Puck of Pook's Hill'' from 1906.

Another example, and the earliest use of ''little green man'' in the ''New York Times'' and ''Chicago Tribune'', dates from 1902, in a review of a children's book called ''The Gift of the Magic Staff'', where a supernatural "Little Green Man" is a boy's friend and helps him visit the cloudland fairies. The next use in the ''New York Times'' was in 1950, and references a planned movie by [[Walt Disney Corporation]] of a 1927 novel by poet/novelist [[Robert Nathan]] called ''The Woodcutter's House''. The only animated character in the picture was to be Nathan's "Little Green Man", a confidant of the woodland animals. (The movie was never made.)

In 1923, a serialized romance, ''When Hearts Command'' by Elizabeth York Miller, which appeared in newspapers such as the ''Chicago Tribune'' and ''Washington Post'', has a former mental patient who still sees "little green men" and who simultaneously comments that a fellow patient "conversed with the inhabitants of Mars".

Other instances of imaginary small green beings have been found in a newspaper column from 1936 sarcastically discussing doctors and their medical advice, saying these are the same people who have breakdowns in middle age and start hallucinating "a little green man with big ears". Syndicated columnist [[Sydney J. Harris]] used "little green man" in 1948 as a child's imaginary friend while condemning the age-old tradition of frightening children with stories of "[[bogeyman|boogeymen]]".

These examples illustrate that use of ''little green men'' was already deeply engrained in English [[vernacular]] long before the flying saucer era, used for a variety of supernatural, imaginary, or mythical beings. It also seems to have easily extended beyond the imaginary to real people, such as the reference to small actors in the ''Wizard of Oz'' or camouflaged Japanese soldiers. Similarly, Aubeck and others suspect that when flying saucers came along in 1947, with subsequent speculation about alien origins, the term naturally and quickly attached itself to the modern age equivalent. It is also clear that by the early 1950s, the term was already commonly used as a sarcastic reference to the occupants of flying saucers. By 1954, the image of little green men had become inscribed in the public's collective consciousness.

Further electronic searches suggest that the term became increasingly more common in the 1960s and always used in a derisive or humorous way. The ''Chicago Tribune'' in 1960 carried a front-page story on the speculations of a Harvard anthropologist about how aliens might look and alien sex. The article opens with the comment, "If there really are 'little green men' out there in space, there are probably also little green women–and sex." A cartoon was attached showing two amorous [[centaur]]-like male and female aliens with antennae sticking out of their heads. The article also enigmatically states, "The 'little green men' designation came from Dr. [[Otto Struve]], director of the national radio astronomy observatory, Green Bank, W. Va. He said that's what the possible outerspacers are called 'among themselves'."

The term even penetrated into the commentary of the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''. First use in the ''Journal'' was 1960 in an article on the [[Brookings Report]] commissioned by [[NASA]], studying the possible social effects of the discovery of extraterrestrial life. The ''Journal'' commented that they thought the report overly pessimistic, assuming that "the little green men with the wiggly antennae" would be hostile. Another ''Journal'' use of the term occurred in 1968 in an editorial on a planned Congressional investigation of [[UFO]]s. The writer sarcastically asked how they planned to [[subpoena]] "a little green man". In 1969, they commented that the [[Condon Committee]] UFO study commissioned by the Air Force was a waste of money. The editorial stated that even if they did prove that "UFOs were people with little green men", what were we supposed to do about it?&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ufoupdateslist.com/2004/feb/m29-008.shtml |title=More details on LGM quotes and other examples |publisher=Ufoupdateslist.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1965, a little green man had even appeared in ''[[The Flintstones]]'' as a recurring character. [[The Great Gazoo]] (introduced in Episode 145) typified the representation of a little green man with his short, green stature and helmet with antennae. However, the 1960s also marked a transition in the way people imagined a stereotypical alien. In [[Abduction Phenomenon|alien abduction]] stories they are often small but [[grey alien|grey being]]s and in [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) they are unseen.

Little green aliens and the term "little green men" have fallen out of general use in serious science fiction circles and are typically only used by the uninformed or to ridicule the notion that aliens may exist, with a few exceptions, such as [[Yoda]] in the [[Star Wars]] movie saga. A derisive usage can be seen in the [[Star Trek: The Original Series|original ''Star Trek'']] episode "[[Tomorrow Is Yesterday]]", set in 1969, as [[James T. Kirk|Captain Kirk]], captured by the US Air Force while attempting to steal film showing the ''Enterprise'' in Earth's atmosphere, calls himself a "little green man from [[Alpha Centauri]]" when interrogated by the base security officer. Earlier in the same episode, a rescued Air Force captain brought aboard the ''Enterprise'' tells Kirk he's never believed in little green men, immediately before meeting the greenish-tinged Mr. Spock (who replies, "Neither have I"). In the 1988 Doctor Who Serial ''[[Remembrance of the Daleks]]'', the line is parodied when the Doctor states that the Daleks are aliens. Group Captain Gilmore asks if he's fighting little green men, to which the Doctor says "no, little green blobs in bonded polycarbide armour".

Instead, the little green alien image seems to have migrated mainly to the world of children's media where it can still be found in abundance (e.g. the small, green "[[squeeze toy aliens]]" in the 1995 film ''[[Toy Story]]'' and its sequels).

The ''[[Pokémon]]'' species "[[Elgyem]]" is based on little green men ("LGM") in its design, characteristics, and name.

The Irkens from ''[[Invader Zim]]'' bear a similarity to green little men.

In the space-simulation game ''[[Kerbal Space Program]]'', Kerbals are the only species in the game and are portrayed as little green men with a large head compared to their bodies.

'''Dr. George  Ian Ogilvie Duncan''' (20 July 1930 – 10 May 1972) was an Australian law lecturer at the [[University of Adelaide]] who drowned on 10 May 1972 after being thrown into the [[River Torrens]] by a group of men believed to be police officers. Public outrage generated by the murder became the trigger for homosexual law reform which led to [[South Australia]] becoming the first Australian state to decriminalise homosexuality.

==Early life==
George Duncan was born on 20 July 1930 at [[Golders Green]], [[London]], the only child of [[New Zealand]]-born parents Ronald Ogilvie Duncan (d.1952) and his second wife Hazel Kerr [[née]] Martell (d.1944). Emigrating to [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]] in 1937, Duncan attended [[Melbourne Grammar School]], graduating [[Dux#Education|dux]] in 1947.

While taking an honours degree in classical [[philology]] at the [[University of Melbourne]], Duncan's studies were interrupted in 1950 after contracting [[tuberculosis]]. In 1957, Duncan entered [[St John's College, Cambridge]], where he was awarded a number of degrees including [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in 1960; a [[Bachelor of Laws]] in 1961; an [[Master of Arts (Oxbridge and Dublin)|M.A.]] in 1963 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1964. From 1966 to 1971, he taught law part-time at the [[University of Bristol]] and published his doctoral thesis in 1971.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

Relatively wealthy, Duncan returned to Australia on 25 March 1972 to take up a lectureship in law at the [[University of Adelaide]], moving into [[Lincoln College (University of Adelaide)|Lincoln College]] in [[North Adelaide]]. Six weeks later he was thrown from the southern bank of the [[River Torrens]], near Kintore Avenue, and drowned.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;

==Death==
As homosexuality was still illegal in South Australia at that time, the banks of the Torrens River, or "Number 1 [[Gay beat|beat]]" as it was then known, was a popular place for gay men to meet. Around 11.00 p.m. on 10 May 1972, Duncan and Roger James were both thrown into the river and Duncan drowned.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.com/news/world-australia-41964671 ''How the killing of a gay academic changed Australia'', BBCnews, 14 November 2017].&lt;/ref&gt; James suffered a broken ankle and after crawling to the road, was rescued by a passing driver, [[Bevan Spencer von Einem]], who then took him to the [[Royal Adelaide Hospital]]. By the time a television crew arrived, Duncan's body had already been pulled from the river by police. The body was returned to the river to allow the crew to film its recovery.&lt;ref name=SLSA/&gt;

George Duncan is buried in [[Centennial Park Cemetery]].

==Investigations and trial==
James declined to identify his attackers and the [[Premier of South Australia]], [[Don Dunstan]], offered government protection to witnesses after it was reported that they feared for their lives.&lt;ref name=Prest&gt;Wilfrid Prest ''Wakefield Companion to South Australian History'' [[Wakefield Press (Australia)|Wakefield Press]] 2001 Pg 153 {{ISBN|1-86254-558-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days of the murder it was suspected that the group of men who killed Duncan were three senior [[Vice unit|Vice Squad]] [[police]] officers. Witnesses claimed that the detectives were also accompanied by a tall civilian who was never identified. The detectives were called upon to give evidence at the Coronial Inquiry but they refused to answer any of the questions put to them and were subsequently suspended from duty and eventually resigned. The coroner returned an open finding on 5 July 1972. The subsequent police investigation, which called the incident "a frolic", failed to find sufficient evidence to prosecute any of the officers.

Public debate was so great that Premier Dunstan permitted police commissioner, Harold Salisbury, to call in detectives from [[Scotland Yard|New Scotland Yard]], London, to investigate the murder. Their report, which has never been made public, led to the crown solicitor announcing on 24 October 1972 that he had decided against proceeding with any prosecution.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Prest/&gt;

On 30 July 1985 former Vice Squad officer Mick O'Shea told ''[[The Advertiser (Australia)|The Advertiser]]'' newspaper that the group involved were Vice Squad officers and that there was a cover-up to protect them. On 5 February 1986 three former Vice Squad officers, Brian Hudson, Francis Cawley and Michael Clayton, were charged with the manslaughter of Dr. Duncan. Cawley and Clayton eventually went to trial in 1988 with both being acquitted of the charges on 30 September after refusing to testify.&lt;ref name=adb&gt;{{cite web| first=Tim | last=Reeves | title =Duncan, George Ian Ogilvie (1930 - 1972) | publisher =[[Australian National University]]| work=[[Australian Dictionary of Biography]]| url =http://www.adb.online.anu.edu.au/biogs/A140054b.htm| accessdate = 14 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=sam/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/7.30/content/2002/s552142.htm A look back at the Duncan murder] [[The 7.30 Report]] ABC 9 May 2002&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/stateline/sa/content/2005/s1367148.htm Duncan drowning witness talks] [[Stateline (TV program)|Stateline]] ABC 6 May 2005&lt;/ref&gt;  During the trial, O'Shea made specific allegations that it was a common practice for Vice Squad officers to throw homosexuals into the river, that certain members assaulted homosexuals and that on one occasion they had chased an individual while firing shots. A further allegation was later raised that there had been an attempt to influence a juror to find the two officers charged not guilty.&lt;ref name=SLSA&gt;[http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?c=2055&amp;mode=singleImage Duncan Report "Closed"] [[State Library of South Australia]] Scan of newspaper article May 1990 Pg 6.&lt;/ref&gt;  A police task force was set up, reporting to Parliament in 1990 that there was insufficient evidence to charge any person with the murder. Repeated calls for a Royal Commission have been ignored.&lt;ref name=Prest/&gt;

==Legal impact==
The murder attracted national media coverage and public outrage resulted in Duncan being held up as a martyr by the [[LGBT social movements|Gay Rights movement]].&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=Prest/&gt;&lt;ref name=sam/&gt;  As a result of the media attention, [[Murray Hill (politician)|Murray Hill]], a [[Liberal Party of Australia (South Australian Division)|Liberal Party]] member of the [[South Australian Legislative Council|Legislative Council]], introduced a bill on 26 July 1972 to amend the Criminal Law Consolidation Act (1935–1971) that criminalised homosexuality. The amendment was assented to on 9 November 1972, however, a further amendment weakened it to only allow a legal defence for homosexual acts committed in private. In 1973 the [[Australian Labor Party (South Australian Branch)|Labor]] Member for [[Elizabeth, South Australia|Elizabeth]], [[Peter Duncan (Australian politician)|Peter Duncan]], introduced the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Bill into Parliament which, although passed by the [[South Australian House of Assembly|Lower House]], was defeated twice in the Legislative Council. On 27 August 1975 the unaltered bill was again introduced, defeated, reintroduced, defeated, reintroduced a third time and passed, all on the same day, making South Australia the first Australian State to fully decriminalise homosexuality.&lt;ref name=adb/&gt;&lt;ref name=sam&gt;[http://www.samemory.sa.gov.au/site/page.cfm?u=648 Gay Rights: South Australian law reform 1859 to 1975] [[State Library of South Australia]]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorials==
On 10 May 2002, the 30th anniversary of Duncan's death, a memorial monument was erected near the site of the murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monumentaustralia.org.au/monument_display.php?id=50213&amp;image=0 Dr George Duncan] Monument Australia&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt;Memorial Inscription&amp;mdash;&lt;br /&gt;"In memory of Dr George Duncan, whose death by drowning on 10th May, 1972, near here, at the hands of persons unconvicted, precipitated homosexual law reform in South Australia, making it the first state in Australia in 1975 to decriminalise homosexual relations."&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Also on 10 May, [[Radio Adelaide]] broadcast a feature documentary ''The Killing of Dr George''. On 1 October, the South Australia Institute of Justice Studies awarded a special commendation to Radio Adelaide, praising the documentary for its historical significance and inclusion of comment from people who had been gay activists at the time of Duncan's death.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adelaide.edu.au/news/print425.html Duncan documentary wins media award] Media release [[University of Adelaide]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The National George Duncan Memorial Award was inaugurated in 2004. The award is presented for an outstanding piece of work contributing to legal reform and the betterment of the Australian lesbian, gay, queer, bisexual, transgender or intersex community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scu.edu.au/news/media.php?item_id=532&amp;action=show_item Homosexual rights book earns national prize] [[Southern Cross University]]&lt;/ref&gt;

RTÉ News. 2 May 2014; accessed 17 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; was a woman from [[Belfast|Belfast, Northern Ireland]], who was kidnapped and murdered by the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army]] (IRA) and illicitly buried in [[County Louth]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]] in 1972 after being wrongly accused by the IRA of passing information to British forces.&lt;ref name=lostlives&gt;McKittrick, David (2001), ''Lost Lives: The Stories of the Men, Women and Children who Died as a Result of the Northern Ireland Troubles''.

In 1999, the IRA acknowledged that it had killed McConville and eight others of the "[[Disappeared (Northern Ireland)|Disappeared]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-27234413 "Jean McConville: The Disappeared mother-of-ten"], BBC News, 1 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; It claimed she had been passing information about republicans to the [[British Army]] in exchange for money and that a transmitter had been found in her apartment.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-33005771&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Moloney2002"&gt;{{cite book|last=Moloney|first=Ed|year=2002|title=A Secret History of the IRA|publisher=W.W.

Before [[the Troubles]], the IRA had a policy of killing informers within its own ranks; however, from the start of the conflict the term informer was also used for civilians who were suspected of providing information on paramilitary organisations to the security forces. Other [[Irish republican]] and [[Ulster loyalism#Paramilitary and vigilante groups|loyalist]] paramilitaries also carried out such killings.&lt;ref name=melaugh&gt;Melaugh, Martin. [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/victims/gis/maps/gismaps-20.html Killings of Alleged Informers], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; As she was a widowed mother of ten, the McConville killing was particularly controversial. Her body was not found until 2003, and the crime has not been solved. The Police Ombudsman found that the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) did not begin to investigate the disappearance properly until 1995.

==Biography==
Jean Murray was born on 7 May 1934 to a [[Protestantism in Ireland|Protestant]] family in East Belfast but converted after marrying Arthur McConville, a Catholic former [[British Army]] soldier,&lt;ref&gt;[[Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland|Police Ombudsman]]: [http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/issues/police/ombudsman/po130806.pdf Report (2006) into complaint by James and Michael McConville regarding the police investigation into the abduction and murder of their mother, Mrs Jean McConville (Page 3)], cain.ulst.ac.uk; accessed 7 MAy 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; with whom she had ten children. After being intimidated out of a Protestant district by loyalists in 1969, the McConville family moved to West Belfast's [[Divis Flats]] in the Lower [[Falls Road, Belfast|Falls Road]].&lt;ref&gt;David McKittrick. ''The London Independent''. 25 September 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Arthur died from [[cancer]] in January 1972.&lt;ref name=lostlives/&gt;

At the time of her death, Jean McConville lived at 1A St Jude's Walk, which was part of the Divis Flats complex.&lt;ref&gt;Police Ombudsman's report (2006), p.2&lt;/ref&gt; This was an IRA stronghold, from which attacks were regularly launched against the British Army and RUC. Since the death of her husband, she had been raising their ten children, who were aged between six and twenty. Their son Robbie was a member of the [[Official Irish Republican Army|Official IRA]] and was [[Operation Demetrius|interned]] in [[Long Kesh]] at the time of her death; he would defect to the [[Irish National Liberation Army]] (INLA) in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hanley &amp; Millar|first=B&amp;S|title=The Lost Revolution: The story of the Official IRA and the Workers Party|year=2009| publisher=Penguin Ireland|location=Ireland|isbn=978-1-84488-120-8|page=285}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Killing===
In the months leading up to her death, tension and suspicion grew between McConville and her neighbours.&lt;ref name=GuardForeman&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2010/dec/05/amanda-foreman-jean-mcconville-ira|title=Sinn Fein should never be able to escape Jean McConville's ghost|author=Amanda Foreman|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=4 December 2010|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; One night shortly before her disappearance, she was allegedly attacked after leaving a [[bingo hall]] and warned to stop giving information to the British Army.&lt;ref name=ombudsman4&gt;Police Ombudsman's report (2006), p.4&lt;/ref&gt; According to police records, on 29 November 1972 a British Army unit found a distressed woman wandering in the street. She told them her name was McConville and that she had been attacked and warned to stop informing.&lt;ref name=ombudsman4/&gt; One of McConville's children claimed she was kidnapped the night after this incident, but others gave the date of the kidnapping as 7 December.&lt;ref name=ombudsman4/&gt;

On the night of her disappearance, four young women took McConville from her home at gunpoint,&lt;ref name=lostlives/&gt; and she was driven to an unknown location. [[Dolours Price]] claimed that she was one of those involved in driving her across the border.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/northernireland/9560123/IRA-bomber-says-Gerry-Adams-sanctioned-mainland-bombing-campaign.html|location=London, UK|work=The Daily Telegraph|first=Bob|last=Graham|title=IRA bomber says Gerry Adams sanctioned mainland bombing campaign|date=23 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConville was killed by a gunshot to the back of the head, there was no evidence of any other injuries to her body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Tests confirm identity of IRA victim McConville | url = http://www.independent.ie/irish-news/tests-confirm-identity-of-ira-victim-mcconville-25927294.html | publisher = ''[[Irish Independent]]'' | date = 21 October 2003 | accessdate = 23 June 2016| quote = The DNA tests were carried out in London after an earlier post-mortem examination at the Louth Co Hospital had concluded that Mrs McConville had been shot once in the back of the head. It ruled out suggestions that she had been mutilated and tortured before being murdered.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = McConville son says family endured 31 years of 'hell' | url = http://www.irishtimes.com/news/mcconville-son-says-family-endured-31-years-of-hell-1.975590 | publisher = ''[[Irish Times]]'' | date = 5 April 2004 | accessdate = 23 June 2016| quote = Dr Marie Cassidy, the State Pathologist, told the inquest Mrs McConville died from a single gunshot wound to the back of the head.  A flattened .22 calibre lead bullet was found in her nasal passage during post-mortem. Dr Cassidy said there was no pathological evidence to suggest if Mrs McConville was kneeling when she was shot. She also said there was no evidence on Mrs McConville's skeletal remains to suggest that she had suffered any other injuries prior to her death.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Her body was secretly buried across [[Republic of Ireland–United Kingdom border|the border]] on Shellinghill Beach (also known as Templetown Beach) on the [[Cooley Peninsula]] in the north of [[County Louth]], about 50 miles from her home. The place of her death is uncertain.

Although no group admitted responsibility for her disappearance, there were rumours that the IRA had killed her for being an informer.&lt;ref name=lostlives/&gt; Another rumour is that she was killed because neighbours claimed they saw her helping a badly wounded British soldier outside her home;&lt;ref name=lostlives/&gt; however, there is no record of such an incident.&lt;ref name=lostlives/&gt; McConville's children say they recall her helping a wounded British soldier some time before their father died in January 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Police Ombudsman's report (2006), p.7&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2014 interview published in the ''[[Sunday Life (newspaper)|Sunday Life]]'', former Irish republican Evelyn Gilroy claimed the person who had tended to the soldier was her [Gilroy's] sister.&lt;ref&gt;"My sister lived five doors from Jean McConville in Farset Walk in the flats. Weeks before Jean was killed, a soldier was hit on the head by a brick thrown by a local lad. My sister heard him crying. She was a very soft, warm woman and she brought him into the hallway and gave him a glass of water. "Her act of compassion didn't go down well with some. 'Touts Out' and 'Soldier Lover' was painted on her door. The incident was reported to the media. My sister gave an interview to Downtown Radio about her act of mercy and the intimidation that followed."&lt;br/&gt;'Arrest Gerry Adams now' - former republican prisoner breaks her silence on IRA murder of Jean McConville, [http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sunday-life/news/arrest-gerry-adams-now-former-republican-prisoner-breaks-her-silence-on-ira-murder-of-jean-mcconville-30213561.html Evelyn Gilroy interview], ''Sunday Life'', 24 April 2014; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The IRA did not admit involvement until after the signing of the [[Good Friday Agreement]]. It claimed she was killed because she was passing information about republicans to the British Army. Former IRA member [[Brendan Hughes]] claimed the IRA had searched her flat some time before her death and found a radio transmitter, which they confiscated.&lt;ref name=voices128&gt;Moloney, Ed. ''Voices from the Grave: Two Men's War in Ireland''. Faber and Faber, 2010. pp. 128-129&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; He and other former republicans interrogated her and claimed she admitted the British Army was paying her for information about republicans. Hughes claims that, because of her circumstances, they let her go with a warning. However, he claims when the IRA found she had resumed working for the British Army, it decided to "execute" her.&lt;ref name=voices128/&gt;

Usually the bodies of informers were left in public as a warning, but the IRA secretly buried McConville, apparently because she was a widowed mother-of-ten. The IRA had first done this two months earlier, when it killed and buried two IRA members who were found to be working undercover for the British [[Military Reaction Force]] (MRF).&lt;ref&gt;McKittrick, ''Lost Lives'', p. 275&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dillon, Martin (2012). ''The Dirty War''. Random House. pp. 49-51&lt;!-- ISBN needed --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aftermath===
After her disappearance, McConville's seven youngest children, including six-year-old twins, survived on their own in the flat, cared for by their 15-year-old sister Helen.&lt;ref name=GuardForeman/&gt; According to the family, after three weeks, the hungry family was visited by a stranger, who gave them Jean's purse, with 52&amp;nbsp;[[Penny (British decimal coin)|pence]] and her three rings in it.&lt;ref name=GuardForeman/&gt;

On 16 January 1973, the story of the abduction appeared on the front page of the ''[[Belfast Telegraph]]'', under the headline "Snatched mother missing a month".&lt;ref name=ombudsman5-6&gt;Police Ombudsman's report (2006), pp. 5-6&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, the children were interviewed on the [[BBC]] television programme ''Scene Around Six''.&lt;ref name=ombudsman5-6/&gt; The children reported to the [[social services]], and were immediately brought into local council care.&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/aug/15/northernireland.owenbowcott|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian|title=Belfast police sorry for failing woman's family|first=Owen|last=Bowcott|date=15 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family was split up by social services.&lt;ref name=GuardForeman/&gt; Among the consequences of the killing, Jean's orphaned son Billy was sent to De La Salle Boys' Home, Rubane House, [[Kircubbin]], [[County Down]], notorious for child abuse; he testified in 2014 to the [[Northern Ireland Historical Institutional Abuse Inquiry]], describing repeated sexual and physical abuse, and starvation, saying "Christians looking after young boys – maybe they were Christians, but to me they were devils disguised in that uniform."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u.tv/News/Jean-McConvilles-child-abused-at-Rubane/1d5cbbcd-4732-4dd2-b5ef-43b90f193f15 UTV:Jean McConville's child 'abused at Rubane', 6 November 2014] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402192654/http://www.u.tv/News/Jean-McConvilles-child-abused-at-Rubane/1d5cbbcd-4732-4dd2-b5ef-43b90f193f15 |date=2 April 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within two days of her kidnapping, one of her sons reported the incident to the [[Royal Ulster Constabulary]] (RUC) and the British Army. However, the Police Ombudsman did not find any trace of an investigation into the kidnapping during the 1970s or 1980s.&lt;ref name=ombudsman5-6/&gt; An officer told the Ombudsman that [[Criminal Investigation Department|CID]] investigations in that area of Belfast at that time were "restricted to the most serious cases".&lt;ref name=ombudsman5-6/&gt; On 2 January 1973, the RUC received two pieces of information stating: "it is rumoured that Jean McConville had been abducted by the [IRA] because she is an informer".&lt;ref name=ombudsman10&gt;Police Ombudsman's report (2006), p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1973, information was received from the British Army, saying the kidnapping was an elaborate hoax and that McConville had left of her own free will.&lt;ref name=ombudsman10/&gt; As a result, the RUC refused to accept that McConville was missing, preferring to believe an anonymous tip that she had absconded with a British soldier.&lt;ref name=GuardForeman/&gt; The first investigation into her kidnapping appears to have taken place in 1995, when a team of RUC detectives was established to review the cases of all those who were thought to have been kidnapped during the conflict.&lt;ref name=ombudsman5-6/&gt;

In 1999, the IRA gave information on the whereabouts of her body.&lt;ref name="rte.ie"&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0707/mcconvillej.html No evidence for McConville agent claim: O'Loan]; accessed 7 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted a prolonged search, co-ordinated by the [[Garda Síochána]], the Irish police service, but no body was found. On the night of 26 August 2003, a storm washed away part of the embankment supporting the west side of Shellinghill Beach car park, near the site of previous searches.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rte.ie/news/2003/1020/43412-mcconvillej "Body found was McConville: Gardaí"]; accessed 7 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; This exposed the body.&lt;ref name=GuardForeman/&gt; On 27 August, it was found by passersby while they were walking on Shellinghill Beach (also known as Templetown Beach) in [[County Louth]] at the eastern tip of the [[Cooley Peninsula]].&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2006/0707/mcconvillej.html|work=RTÉ News|title=No evidence for McConville as British agent claim: O'Loan|date=7 July 2006|accessdate=7 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; McConville was subsequently reburied beside her husband Arthur in Holy Trinity Graveyard in [[Lisburn]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emigrant.ie/article.asp?iCategoryID=177&amp;iArticleID=23388 "Jean McConville laid to rest after 31 years."]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050114091443/http://www.emigrant.ie/article.asp?iCategoryID=177&amp;iArticleID=23388 |date=14 January 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/Northern_Ireland/Story/0,2763,801533,00.html "Adams 'at heart' of IRA's most shameful killing campaign"], guardian.co.uk; accessed 7 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigation==
===Police Ombudsman's report===
In April 2004 the inquest into McConville's death returned a verdict of unlawful killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2004/0405/mcconvillej.html|work=RTÉ News|title=Unlawful killing of McConville: verdict|date=5 April 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 the [[Police Ombudsman for Northern Ireland]], [[Nuala O'Loan, Baroness O'Loan|Nuala O'Loan]], published a report about the police's investigation of the murder. It concluded that the RUC did not investigate the murder until 1995, when it carried out a minor investigation.&lt;ref name=ombudsman5-6/&gt; It found no evidence that she had been an informer, but recommended the [[British Government]] go against its long-standing policy regarding informers and reveal whether she was one.&lt;ref&gt;Police Ombudsman's report (2006), p.12&lt;/ref&gt; Journalist [[Ed Moloney]] called for the British Government to release [[War diary|war diaries]] relating to the Divis Flats area at the time. War diaries are usually released under the [[thirty-year rule]], but those relating to Divis at the time of McConville's death are embargoed for almost ninety years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thejournal.ie/could-british-war-diaries-help-solve-the-jean-mcconville-murder-992346-Jul2013 "Could British war diaries help solve the Jean McConville murder?"]. [[TheJournal.ie]]. 14 July 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The police have since apologised for its failure to investigate her abduction.&lt;ref name=GuardForeman/&gt; In January 2005, Sinn Féin party chairman [[Mitchel McLaughlin]] claimed that the killing of McConville was not a crime, saying that she had been executed as a spy in a war situation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4186887.stm "Resignation call rejected"]. BBC News.&lt;/ref&gt; This prompted Irish journalist [[Fintan O'Toole]] to write a rebuttal, arguing that the abduction and extrajudicial killing of McConville was clearly a "war crime by all accepted national and international standards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/opinion/analysis/the-murder-of-jean-mcconville-was-a-crime-by-any-standards-anywhere-463441.html|work=Irish Independent|first=Jim|last=Cusack|title=The murder of Jean McConville was a crime, by any standards anywhere|date=23 January 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IRA has since issued a general apology, saying it "regrets the suffering of all the families whose loved ones were killed and buried by the IRA".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cain.ulst.ac.uk/othelem/organ/ira/ira080706.htm|title=Statement on the Abduction and Killing of Mrs Jean McConville in December 1972|author=P. O'Neill|publisher=Irish Republican Publicity Bureau, Dublin|date=8 July 2006|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PSNI investigation and Boston College tapes===
In August 2006, the [[Chief Constable of Northern Ireland|Chief Constable]] of the [[Police Service of Northern Ireland]] (PSNI), [[Sir Hugh Orde]], stated that he was not hopeful anyone would be brought to justice over the murder, saying "[in] any case of that age, it is highly unlikely that a successful prosecution could be mounted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/northern_ireland/4792273.stm IRA murder prosecution 'unlikely'], BBC website, 14 August 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Boston College]] had launched an [[oral history]] project on the Troubles in 2001. It recorded interviews with republicans and loyalists about their involvement in the conflict, on the understanding that the tapes would not be released until after their deaths.&lt;ref name=bbcboston&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-27238797 "What are the Boston tapes?"]. BBC News, 1 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=devlinbarrett&gt;{{cite news|title=IRA History Project Snags U.S. School|author=Devlin Barret|date=9 January 2012|work=[[Wall Street Journal]]|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203436904577148850562108914?mod=WSJ_hp_editorsPicks_2|accessdate=9 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two of the republican interviewees, [[Brendan Hughes]] and [[Dolours Price]], both now deceased, admitted they were involved in McConville's kidnapping.&lt;ref name=bbcboston/&gt; Both became [[dissident republicans|diehard opponents]] of the Good Friday Agreement and Sinn Féin's support of it. They saw Sinn Féin president [[Gerry Adams]] as a traitor for negotiating the Agreement and persuading the IRA to end its campaign.

In 2010, after Hughes's death, some of his statements were published in the book ''Voices from the Grave''.&lt;ref name=voices128/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Taylor|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Taylor (Journalist)|title=Provos The IRA &amp; Sinn Féin|publisher=[[Bloomsbury Publishing]]|year=1997|pages=156–157|isbn=0-7475-3818-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed McConville had admitted being an informer, and that Adams &lt;!-- not SF President when the incident occurred --&gt; ordered her disappearance.&lt;ref name=voices128/&gt;&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2013/nov/03/gerry-adams-jean-mcconville "Gerry Adams ordered Jean McConville killing, says ex-IRA commander on tape"], ''The Guardian'', 3 November 2013; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2010 newspaper article, Price also claimed McConville was an informer and that Adams ordered her disappearance,&lt;ref&gt;[http://bostoncollegesubpoena.wordpress.com/supporting-documents/sunday-life Documents at Boston College by Irish republicans]; accessed 7 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; which has been strenuously denied by Ed Moloney.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thebrokenelbow.com/2011/11/14/boston-college-the-role-of-the-irish-news-sunday-life], thebrokenelbow.com; 14 November 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Price, who died in 2013,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2013/jan/24/old-bailey-bomber-dolours-price|title=Dolours Price dies|location=London, UK|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; said she gave the interviews as revenge against Adams.&lt;ref name="Graham"/&gt; Former republican prisoner Evelyn Gilroy, who lived near McConville, claimed Adams was an IRA commander and the only person who could have ordered the killing.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/sunday-life/news/arrest-gerry-adams-now-former-republican-prisoner-breaks-her-silence-on-ira-murder-of-jean-mcconville-30213561.html "'Arrest Gerry Adams now' - former republican prisoner breaks her silence on IRA murder of Jean McConville"], ''The Belfast Telegraph'', 24 April 2014; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Adams has denied any role in the death of McConville.&lt;ref name="theguardian.com"/&gt; He said "the killing of Jean McConville and the secret burial of her body was wrong and a grievous injustice to her and her family".&lt;ref name="BBC McConville"&gt;{{cite news|title=Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams held over Jean McConville murder|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27232731|accessdate=30 April 2014|newspaper=BBC News|date=30 April 2014|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the PSNI began a legal bid to gain access to the tapes.&lt;ref name=bbcboston/&gt; Acting on a request from the PSNI, the [[United States Justice Department]] tried to force Boston College to hand them over. Boston College had promised those interviewed that the tapes would not be released until after their deaths, and other interviewees said they feared retribution if the tapes were released.&lt;ref name="devlinbarrett"/&gt; Following a lengthy court battle, the PSNI was given transcripts of interviews by Hughes and Price.&lt;ref name=bbcboston/&gt;

===2014 arrests===
In March and April 2014, the PSNI arrested a number of people over the kidnapping and killing of Jean McConville. [[Ivor Bell]], former IRA Chief of Staff, was arrested in March 2014.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2014/mar/18/northern-ireland-arrest-disappeared-jean-mcconville "Man arrested in Northern Ireland over 1972 case of 'disappeared' mother"], ''The Guardian'', 18 March 2014; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, he was charged with aiding and abetting in her murder.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u.tv/News/Man-in-court-over-McConville-murder/73740313-9773-49b8-bce4-5b392741eca1 "Man in court over McConville murder"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140504213514/http://www.u.tv/News/Man-in-court-over-McConville-murder/73740313-9773-49b8-bce4-5b392741eca1 |date=4 May 2014 }}.

Following Bell's arrest in March, there was media speculation that police would want to question [[Gerry Adams]] due to the claims made by Hughes and Price. Adams maintained he was not involved,&lt;ref name="BBC McConville"/&gt; but had his solicitor contact the PSNI to find whether they wanted to question him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.u.tv/News/Adams-contacts-police-over-McConville/5f143228-23f2-4460-86b7-5b5dca35fe9d "Adams contacts police over McConville"] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20140504213455/http://www.u.tv/News/Adams-contacts-police-over-McConville/5f143228-23f2-4460-86b7-5b5dca35fe9d |date=4 May 2014 }}. UTV News, 24 March 2014; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; On 30 April, after being contacted by the PSNI, Adams voluntarily arranged to be interviewed at [[Antrim, County Antrim|Antrim]] PSNI Station. He was arrested and questioned for four days before being released without charge. A file was sent to the [[Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland|Public Prosecution Service]] (PPS) to decide whether further action should be taken,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-27278039 "Gerry Adams freed in Jean McConville murder inquiry"]. BBC News. 4 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; but there was "insufficient evidence" to charge him.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eveningecho.ie/national-news/reports-insufficient-evidence-on-adams/ "Reports: ‘Insufficient evidence’ on Adams"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150411213342/http://www.eveningecho.ie/national-news/reports-insufficient-evidence-on-adams/ |date=11 April 2015 }}. ''Evening Echo''. 6 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrest took place during an election campaign. Sinn Féin claimed that the timing of the arrest was politically motivated; an attempt to harm the party's chances in the upcoming elections. [[Alex Maskey]] said it was evidence of a "political agenda [...] a negative agenda" by elements of the PSNI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thetarge.co.uk/article/current-affairs/0258/sinn-fein-mla-adams-arrest-negative-psni-agenda|last=Beaton|first=Connor|title=SF MLA: Adams arrest ‘negative PSNI agenda’|date=30 April 2014|accessdate=30 April 2014|publisher=The Targe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jean McConville's family had campaigned for the arrest of Adams over the murder.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/gerry-adams-sinn-fein-leader-3480389 Sinn Fein leader Gerry Adams arrested over murder of widowed mother abducted in 1972]''&lt;/ref&gt; Her son Michael said "Me and the rest of my brothers and sisters are just glad to see the PSNI doing their job. We didn't think it would ever take place [Mr Adams' arrest], but we are quite glad that it is taking place."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-northern-ireland-27232731 "Sinn Féin leader Gerry Adams held over Jean McConville murder"], bbc.co.uk; accessed 5 May 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In a later interview on the ''[[Today (BBC Radio 4)|Today]]'' programme on [[BBC Radio 4]], he stated that he knew the names of those who had abducted and killed his mother, but that: "I wouldn't tell the police [PSNI]. If I told the police now a thing, me or one of my family members or one of my children would get shot by those [IRA] people. It's terrible that we know those people and we can't bring them to justice."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-27236414|title=Son says he knows killers|publisher=[[BBC News]]|date=1 May 2014|accessdate=5 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mutnedjmet as Nefertiti's Sister==
Some Egyptologists have speculated that Mutnedjemet is identical to [[Nefertiti]]'s sister '''[[Mutbenret]]'''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Tyldesley, Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt, 2006, Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt; This identification was partially based on the fact that Mutbenret's name used to be read as Mutnedjmet. Other Egyptologist such as Geoffrey Martin note that there is no definite evidence to prove this assertion.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey Martin, The Hidden Tombs of Memphis, Thames &amp; Hudson (1991), p.96&lt;/ref&gt; Martin writes that:
: ''The name Mutnodjmet was not particularly rare in the late Eighteenth Dynasty, and even if she were the sister of Nefertiti her marriage to Horemheb would have had no effect on Horemheb's legitimacy or candidacy since Mutnodjmet (who is depicted in the private tombs at El-Amarna) was not herself of royal blood. In any case whatever her antecedents Mutnodjmet could have been married to Horemheb a little before he became Pharaoh''.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, p.96&lt;/ref&gt;

==Monuments and Inscriptions==
Mutnedjmet is known from several object and inscriptions:
* A double statue of Horemheb and Mutnedjmet was found in Karnak, but is now in the Museo Egizio in Turin (1379). On Mutnedjmet's side of the throne she is depicted as a winged sphinx who adores her own cartouche. As Sphinx she is depicted wearing a flat topped crown topped with plant elements associated with the goddess Tefnut. The back of the statue records Horemheb's rise to power.&lt;ref&gt;J. Tyldesley, Chronicle of the Queens of Egypt, 2006, Thames &amp; Hudson&lt;/ref&gt;
* Horemheb and Mutnodjemet are depicted in the tomb of Roy (TT255) in Dra Abu el-Naga. The Royal couple are shown in an offering scene.&lt;ref&gt;Briant Bohleke, Amenemopet Panehsi, Direct Successor of the Chief Treasurer Maya, Journal of the American Research Center in Egypt, Vol. 39, (2002), pp. 157-172&lt;/ref&gt;
* One of the colossal statues in Karnak (north side of the 10th pylon) was made for [[Horemheb]] and depicted Mutnedjmet. The statue was later usurped and reinscribed for [[Ramesses II]] and [[Nefertari]].&lt;ref&gt;Maya Müller, Über die Büste 23725 in Berlin, Jahrbuch der Berliner Museen, Bd. 31, (1989), pp. 7-24&lt;/ref&gt;
* Mutnedjmet usurped several inscriptions of [[Ankhesenamun]] in [[Luxor]].&lt;ref&gt;Aidan Dodson &amp; Dyan Hilton: The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt. Thames &amp; Hudson, 2004, {{ISBN|0-500-05128-3}}, pg 156&lt;/ref&gt;
* Statues (fragments) and other items including alabaster fragments naming Mutnodjemet were found in [[Horemheb]]'s [[Saqqara]] tomb. Some items bear funerary texts.&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey T. Martin, Excavations at the Memphite Tomb of Ḥoremḥeb, 1977: Preliminary Report, The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 64, (1978), pp. 5-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death and Burial==
Mutnedjmet died soon after Year 13 of her husband's rule in her mid-40s based on a wine-jar docket found in a burial chamber of [[Horemheb]] [[Tomb of Horemheb (Memphis)|tomb]] at [[Saqqara]], in Memphis and a statue and other items of hers found here.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson &amp; Hilton, p.156&lt;/ref&gt; The mummy was found in King [[Horemheb]]'s unused Memphite tomb along with the mummy of a still-born, premature infant. She appears to have been buried in the Memphite tomb of Horemheb, alongside his first wife [[Amenia, Wife of Horemheb|Amenia]]. Mutnedjmet's mummy shows she had given birth several times, but the last King of the 18th dynasty did not have a living heir at the time of his demise. It has been suggested that she had a daughter who was simply not mentioned on any monuments. The presence of the infant along with Mutnedjmet in the tomb suggests that this queen died in childbirth. A canopic jar of the Queen is now located in the British Museum.&lt;ref&gt;Dodson &amp; Hilton, p.156&lt;/ref&gt;

It is possible that the tomb [https://sites.google.com/site/historyofancientegypt/valley-of-the-queens/qv33-princess-queen-tanedjemet QV33] in the [[Valley of the Queens]] was originally built for her. The tomb is known as the tomb of an otherwise unknown Tanedjmet, but both cartouches with her name are damaged and the similar hieroglyphs for ''ta'' and ''mut'' allow for this interpretation.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Thomas: ''Was Queen Mutnedjmet the Owner of Tomb 33 in the Valley of the Queens?'' in: The Journal of Egyptian Archaeology, Vol. 53, (Dec., 1967), pp. 161-163&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
* The South African artist [[Winifred Brunton]] painted a portrait of this queen during the 1920s.
* In [[Michelle Moran]]'s novel, ''[[Nefertiti: A Novel]]'', Mutnedjmet is the principal character as the younger sister of Queen [[Nefertiti]]. She is also referenced in Moran's second novel, ''[[The Heretic Queen]]'', as the mother of the principal character, Princess and later Queen [[Nefertari]].
* Mutnedjmet is one of two main characters in Kerry Greenwood's historical mystery, ''Out of the Black Land'' (2010)

In [[philosophy]], the '''natural order''' is the [[morality|moral]] source from which [[natural law]] seeks to derive its [[authority]].  Natural order encompasses the natural relations of beings to one another in the absence of [[law]], which natural law attempts to reinforce. This is related to [[Dharma]].

In contrast, [[divine law]] seeks authority from [[God]], and [[Jurisprudence|positive law]] seeks authority from [[government]].

The term is used by [[Hans-Hermann Hoppe]] in his book, ''[[Democracy: The God That Failed|Democracy: The God That Failed: The Economics and Politics of Monarchy, Democracy, and Natural Order]]'', to defend [[anarcho-capitalism]].

The term is used by [[Friedrich Hayek]] in his writings.

'''''Necessary But Not Sufficient''''' is a 2000 novel authored by Dr. [[Eliyahu Goldratt]] and co-authors Eli Schrangenheim and Carol A. Ptak and published by the [[North River Press]], which has previously published most of Goldratt's works. Necessary but not Sufficient is written as a "business novel" and shows the fictional application of the [[Theory of Constraints]] to [[Enterprise resource planning]] (ERP) and operations software and organizations using that software. The fourth of five published Goldratt business novels, this one does not share any of the settings or characters of the previous three novels (only ''[[The Goal]]'' and ''[[It's Not Luck]]'' shared the same characters).

[[File:Neural network example.svg|thumb|right|Simplified view of a [[Feedforward neural network|feedforward]] artificial neural network]]

A '''neural network''' is a [[biological neural network|network or circuit]] of [[neurons]], or in a modern sense, an [[artificial neural network]], composed of [[artificial neuron]]s or nodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first=J. J. |last=Hopfield |title=Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities |journal=Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A. |volume=79 |issue= 8|pages=2554–2558 |year=1982 |doi=10.1073/pnas.79.8.2554 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus a neural network is either a [[biological neural network]], made up of real biological neurons, or an artificial neural network, for solving [[artificial intelligence]] (AI) problems. The connections of the biological neuron are modeled as weights. A positive weight reflects an excitatory connection, while negative values mean inhibitory connections. All inputs are modified by a weight and summed. This activity is referred as a linear combination. Finally, an activation function controls the [[amplitude]] of the output. For example, an acceptable range of output is usually between 0 and 1, or it could be −1 and 1.

Unlike [[von Neumann model]] computations, artificial neural networks do not separate memory and processing and operate via the flow of signals through the net connections, somewhat akin to biological networks.

These artificial networks may be used for [[predictive modeling]], adaptive control and applications where they can be trained via a dataset. Self-learning resulting from experience can occur within networks, which can derive conclusions from a complex and seemingly unrelated set of information.&lt;ref&gt; Neural Net or Neural Network | Gartner IT Glossary [https://www.gartner.com/it-glossary/neural-net-or-neural-network]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Overview ==
A [[biological neural network]] is composed of a group or groups of chemically connected or functionally associated neurons. A single neuron may be connected to many other neurons and the total number of neurons and connections in a network may be extensive. Connections, called [[synapses]], are usually formed from [[axons]] to [[dendrites]], though [[dendrodendritic synapse]]s&lt;ref&gt;Arbib, p.666&lt;/ref&gt; and other connections are possible. Apart from the electrical signaling, there are other forms of signaling that arise from [[neurotransmitter]] diffusion.

Artificial intelligence, cognitive modelling, and neural networks are information processing paradigms inspired by the way biological neural systems process data. [[Artificial intelligence]] and [[cognitive modeling]] try to simulate some properties of biological neural networks. In the [[artificial intelligence]] field, artificial neural networks have been applied successfully to [[speech recognition]], [[image analysis]] and [[adaptive control]], in order to construct [[software agents]] (in [[Video game|computer and video games]]) or [[autonomous robot]]s.

Historically, digital computers evolved from the [[von Neumann model]], and operate via the execution of explicit instructions via access to memory by a number of processors. On the other hand, the origins of neural networks are based on efforts to model information processing in biological systems. Unlike the von Neumann model, neural network computing does not separate memory and processing.

Neural network theory has served both to better identify how the neurons in the brain function and to provide the basis for efforts to create artificial intelligence.

== History ==
The preliminary theoretical base for contemporary neural networks was independently proposed by [[Alexander Bain]]&lt;ref name="Bain 1873"&gt;{{cite book|last=Bain|title=Mind and Body: The Theories of Their Relation|year=1873|publisher=D. Appleton and Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1873) and [[William James]]&lt;ref name="James 1890"&gt;{{cite book|last=James|title=The Principles of Psychology|year=1890|publisher=H. Holt and Company|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1890). In their work, both thoughts and body activity resulted from interactions among neurons within the brain. 

[[File:Forest of synthetic pyramidal dendrites grown using Cajal's laws of neuronal branching.png|thumb|[[Computer simulation]] of the branching architecture of the [[dendrite]]s of [[pyramidal neuron]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title= Forest of synthetic pyramidal dendrites grown using Cajal's laws of neuronal branching |journal= PLoS Computational Biology Issue Image |volume= Vol. 6 |issue=8 |pages= ev06.i08 |date= August 2010 |doi= 10.1371/image.pcbi.v06.i08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
For Bain,&lt;ref name="Bain 1873"/&gt; every activity led to the firing of a certain set of neurons. When activities were repeated, the connections between those neurons strengthened. According to his theory, this repetition was what led to the formation of memory. The general scientific community at the time was skeptical of Bain’s&lt;ref name="Bain 1873"/&gt; theory because it required what appeared to be an inordinate number of neural connections within the brain. It is now apparent that the brain is exceedingly complex and that the same brain “wiring” can handle multiple problems and inputs.  

James’s&lt;ref name="James 1890"/&gt; theory was similar to Bain’s,&lt;ref name="Bain 1873"/&gt; however, he suggested that memories and actions resulted from electrical currents flowing among the neurons in the brain. His model, by focusing on the flow of electrical currents, did not require individual neural connections for each memory or action. 

[[Charles Scott Sherrington|C. S. Sherrington]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sherrington|first=C.S.|title=Experiments in Examination of the Peripheral Distribution of the Fibers of the Posterior Roots of Some Spinal Nerves|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society of London|volume=190|pages=45–186}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1898) conducted experiments to test James’s theory. He ran electrical currents down the spinal cords of rats. However, instead of demonstrating an increase in electrical current as projected by James, Sherrington found that the electrical current strength decreased as the testing continued over time. Importantly, this work led to the discovery of the concept of [[habituation]]. 
   
[[Warren McCulloch|McCulloch]] and [[Walter Pitts|Pitts]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= McCulloch |first=Warren |author2= Walter Pitts |title= A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity |journal= Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics |year=1943 |volume=5 |pages= 115–133 |doi= 10.1007/BF02478259 |issue=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  (1943) created a computational model for neural networks based on mathematics and algorithms. They called this model [[threshold logic]]. The model paved the way for neural network research to split into two distinct approaches. One approach focused on biological processes in the brain and the other focused on the application of neural networks to artificial intelligence. 

In the late 1940s psychologist [[Donald Hebb]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hebb|first=Donald|title=The Organization of Behavior|year=1949|publisher=Wiley|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  created a hypothesis of learning based on the mechanism of neural plasticity that is now known as [[Hebbian learning]]. Hebbian learning is considered to be a 'typical' [[unsupervised learning]] rule and its later variants were early models for [[long term potentiation]]. These ideas started being applied to computational models in 1948 with [[unorganized machine|Turing's B-type machines]].

Farley and Clark&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Farley |first=B. |author2= W.A. Clark |title= Simulation of Self-Organizing Systems by Digital Computer |journal= IRE Transactions on Information Theory |year=1954 |volume=4 |pages= 76–84 |doi= 10.1109/TIT.1954.1057468 |issue=4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1954) first used computational machines, then called calculators, to simulate a Hebbian network at MIT. Other neural network computational machines were created by Rochester, Holland, Habit, and Duda&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Rochester |first=N. |author2= J.H. Holland, L.H. Habit and W.L. Duda|title=Tests on a cell assembly theory of the action of the brain, using a large digital computer|journal=IRE Transactions on Information Theory |year=1956 |volume=2 |pages= 80–93 |doi= 10.1109/TIT.1956.1056810 |issue=3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1956).

[[Frank Rosenblatt|Rosenblatt]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rosenblatt|first=F.|title=The Perceptron: A Probalistic Model For Information Storage And Organization In The Brain|journal=Psychological Review|year=1958|volume=65|pages=386–408|doi=10.1037/h0042519|pmid=13602029|issue=6|citeseerx=10.1.1.588.3775}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1958) created the [[perceptron]], an algorithm for pattern recognition based on a two-layer learning computer network using simple addition and subtraction. With mathematical notation, Rosenblatt also described circuitry not in the basic perceptron, such as the [[exclusive-or]] circuit, a circuit whose mathematical computation could not be processed until after the [[backpropagation]] algorithm was created by Werbos&lt;ref name="Werbos 1975"&gt;{{cite book|last=Werbos|first=P.J.|title=Beyond Regression: New Tools for Prediction and Analysis in the Behavioral Sciences|year=1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; (1975).

Neural network research stagnated after the publication of machine learning research by [[Marvin Minsky|Minsky]] and Papert&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Minsky |first=M. |title=An Introduction to Computational Geometry |year=1969 |publisher= MIT Press|isbn=978-0-262-63022-1 |author2= S. Papert }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1969). They discovered two key issues with the computational machines that processed neural networks. The first issue was that single-layer neural networks were incapable of processing the exclusive-or circuit. The second significant issue was that computers were not sophisticated enough to effectively handle the long run time required by large neural networks. Neural network research slowed until computers achieved greater processing power. Also key in later advances was the [[backpropagation]] algorithm which effectively solved the exclusive-or problem (Werbos 1975).&lt;ref name="Werbos 1975"/&gt;

The [[connectionism|parallel distributed processing]] of the mid-1980s became popular under the name [[connectionism]]. The text by Rumelhart and McClelland&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Rumelhart |first=D.E. |title= Parallel Distributed Processing: Explorations in the Microstructure of Cognition |year=1986 |publisher= MIT Press |location= Cambridge |author2= James McClelland }}&lt;/ref&gt; (1986) provided a full exposition on the use of connectionism in computers to simulate neural processes.

Neural networks, as used in artificial intelligence, have traditionally been viewed as simplified models of [[neural processing]] in the brain, even though the relation between this model and brain biological architecture is debated, as it is not clear to what degree artificial neural networks mirror brain function.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last= Russell|first= Ingrid |title= Neural Networks Module |url= http://uhaweb.hartford.edu/compsci/neural-networks-definition.html|accessdate= 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neural networks and artificial intelligence==
{{Main|Artificial neural network}}
A ''neural network'' (NN), in the case of artificial neurons called ''artificial neural network'' (ANN) or ''simulated neural network'' (SNN), is an interconnected group of natural or [[artificial neuron]]s that uses a [[mathematical model|mathematical or computational model]] for [[information processing]] based on a [[connectionism|connectionistic]] approach to [[computation]]. In most cases an ANN is an [[adaptive system]] that changes its structure based on external or internal information that flows through the network.

In more practical terms neural networks are [[non-linear]] [[statistical]] [[data modeling]] or [[decision making]] tools. They can be used to model complex relationships between inputs and outputs or to [[Pattern recognition|find patterns]] in data.

An [[artificial neural network]] involves a network of simple processing elements ([[artificial neuron]]s) which can exhibit complex global behavior, determined by the connections between the processing elements and element parameters. Artificial neurons were first proposed in 1943 by [[Warren Sturgis McCulloch|Warren McCulloch]], a neurophysiologist, and [[Walter Pitts]], a logician, who first collaborated at the [[University of Chicago]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=McCulloch |first=Warren |last2=Pitts |first2=Walter |title=A Logical Calculus of Ideas Immanent in Nervous Activity |year=1943 |journal=Bulletin of Mathematical Biophysics |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=115–133 |doi=10.1007/BF02478259 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One classical type of artificial neural network is the [[recurrent neural network|recurrent]] [[Hopfield network]].

The concept of a neural network appears to have first been proposed by [[Alan Turing]] in his 1948 paper ''Intelligent Machinery'' in which called them "B-type unorganised machines".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Essential Turing |editor-first=B. Jack |editor-last=Copeland |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19-825080-7 |page=403 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The utility of artificial neural network models lies in the fact that they can be used to infer a function from observations and also to use it. Unsupervised neural networks can also be used to learn representations of the input that capture the salient characteristics of the input distribution, e.g., see the [[Boltzmann machine]] (1983), and more recently, [[deep learning]] algorithms, which can implicitly learn the distribution function of the observed data. Learning in neural networks is particularly useful in applications where the complexity of the data or task makes the design of such functions by hand impractical.

The tasks to which artificial neural networks are applied tend to fall within the following broad categories:
*[[Function approximation]], or [[regression analysis]], including [[time series prediction]] and modeling.
*[[Statistical classification|Classification]], including [[Pattern recognition|pattern]] and sequence recognition, novelty detection and sequential decision making.
*[[Data processing]], including filtering, clustering, [[blind signal separation]] and compression.

Application areas of ANNs include [[nonlinear system identification]] &lt;ref name="SAB1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Billings |first=S. A. |title=Nonlinear System Identification: NARMAX Methods in the Time, Frequency, and Spatio-Temporal Domains |publisher=Wiley |year=2013 |isbn=978-1-119-94359-4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and control (vehicle control, process control), game-playing and decision making (backgammon, chess, racing), pattern recognition (radar systems, face identification, object recognition), sequence recognition (gesture, speech, handwritten text recognition), medical diagnosis, financial applications, [[data mining]] (or knowledge discovery in databases, "KDD"), visualization and [[e-mail spam]] filtering.

==Neural networks and neuroscience==
Theoretical and [[computational neuroscience]] is the field concerned with the theoretical analysis and computational modeling of biological neural systems.
Since neural systems are intimately related to cognitive processes and behaviour, the field is closely related to cognitive and behavioural modeling.

The aim of the field is to create models of biological neural systems in order to understand how biological systems work. To gain this understanding, neuroscientists strive to make a link between observed biological processes (data), biologically plausible mechanisms for neural processing and learning ([[biological neural network]] models) and theory (statistical learning theory and [[information theory]]).

===Types of models===
Many models are used; defined at different levels of abstraction, and modeling different aspects of neural systems. They range from models of the short-term behaviour of [[biological neuron models|individual neurons]], through models of the dynamics of neural circuitry arising from interactions between individual neurons, to models of behaviour arising from abstract neural modules that represent complete subsystems. These include models of the long-term and short-term plasticity of neural systems and its relation to learning and memory, from the individual neuron to the system level.

==Criticism==
A common criticism of neural networks, particularly in robotics, is that they require a large diversity of training for real-world operation. This is not surprising, since any learning machine needs sufficient representative examples in order to capture the underlying structure that allows it to generalize to new cases. Dean Pomerleau, in his research presented in the paper "Knowledge-based Training of Artificial Neural Networks for Autonomous Robot Driving," uses a neural network to train a robotic vehicle to drive on multiple types of roads (single lane, multi-lane, dirt, etc.). A large amount of his research is devoted to (1) extrapolating multiple training scenarios from a single training experience, and (2) preserving past training diversity so that the system does not become overtrained (if, for example, it is presented with a series of right turns—it should not learn to always turn right). These issues are common in neural networks that must decide from amongst a wide variety of responses, but can be dealt with in several ways, for example by randomly shuffling the training examples, by using a numerical optimization algorithm that does not take too large steps when changing the network connections following an example, or by grouping examples in so-called mini-batches.

[[A. K. Dewdney]], a former ''[[Scientific American]]'' columnist, wrote in 1997, "Although neural nets do solve a few toy problems, their powers of computation are so limited that I am surprised anyone takes them seriously as a general problem-solving tool." (Dewdney, p.&amp;nbsp;82)

Arguments for Dewdney's position are that to implement large and effective software neural networks, much processing and storage resources need to be committed. While the brain has hardware tailored to the task of processing signals through a graph of neurons, simulating even a most simplified form on [[Von Neumann]] technology may compel a neural network designer to fill many millions of [[database]] rows for its connections—which can consume vast amounts of computer [[Random-access memory|memory]] and [[Hard drive|hard disk]] space. Furthermore, the designer of neural network systems will often need to simulate the transmission of signals through many of these connections and their associated neurons—which must often be matched with incredible amounts of [[CPU]] processing power and time. While neural networks often yield ''effective'' programs, they too often do so at the cost of ''efficiency'' (they tend to consume considerable amounts of time and money).

Arguments against Dewdney's position are that neural nets have been successfully used to solve many complex and diverse tasks, ranging from autonomously flying aircraft,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/centers/dryden/news/NewsReleases/2003/03-49.html&lt;/ref&gt; to detecting credit card fraud {{citation needed|date=August 2012}}.

Technology writer [[Roger Bridgman]] commented on Dewdney's statements about neural nets: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Neural networks, for instance, are in the dock not only because they have been hyped to high heaven, (what hasn't?) but also because you could create a successful net without understanding how it worked: the bunch of numbers that captures its behaviour would in all probability be "an opaque, unreadable table...valueless as a scientific resource".

In spite of his emphatic declaration that science is not technology, Dewdney seems here to pillory neural nets as bad science when most of those devising them are just trying to be good engineers. An unreadable table that a useful machine could read would still be well worth having.&lt;ref&gt;[http://members.fortunecity.com/templarseries/popper.html Roger Bridgman's defence of neural networks]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Although it is true that analyzing what has been learned by an artificial neural network is difficult, it is much easier to do so than to analyze what has been learned by a biological neural network. Furthermore, researchers involved in exploring learning algorithms for neural networks are gradually uncovering generic principles which allow a learning machine to be successful. For example, Bengio and LeCun (2007) wrote an article regarding local vs non-local learning, as well as shallow vs deep architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/~lisa/publications2/index.php/publications/show/4&lt;/ref&gt;

Some other criticisms came from believers of hybrid models (combining neural networks and symbolic approaches). They advocate the intermix of these two approaches and believe that hybrid models can better capture the mechanisms of the human mind (Sun and Bookman, 1990).

==Recent improvements==
{{Unreferenced section|date=June 2010}}
While initially research had been concerned mostly with the electrical characteristics of neurons, a particularly important part of the investigation in recent years has been the exploration of the role of [[neuromodulators]] such as [[dopamine]], [[acetylcholine]], and [[serotonin]] on behaviour and learning.

[[Biophysics|Biophysical]] models, such as [[BCM theory]], have been important in understanding mechanisms for [[synaptic plasticity]], and have had applications in both computer science and neuroscience. Research is ongoing in understanding the computational algorithms used in the brain, with some recent biological evidence for [[radial basis networks]] and [[neural backpropagation]] as mechanisms for processing data.

Computational devices have been created in CMOS for both biophysical simulation and [[neuromorphic computing]]. More recent efforts show promise for creating [[nanodevice]]s for very large scale [[principal component]]s analyses and [[convolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yang |first=J.

Between 2009 and 2012, the [[recurrent neural network]]s and deep [[feedforward neural network]]s developed in the research group of [[Jürgen Schmidhuber]] at the [[IDSIA|Swiss AI Lab IDSIA]] have won eight international competitions in [[pattern recognition]] and [[machine learning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kurzweilai.net/how-bio-inspired-deep-learning-keeps-winning-competitions |title=2012 Kurzweil AI Interview with Jürgen Schmidhuber on the eight competitions won by his Deep Learning team 2009–2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, multi-dimensional [[long short term memory]] (LSTM)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Graves |first=Alex |last2=Schmidhuber |first2=Jürgen |chapter=Offline Handwriting Recognition with Multidimensional Recurrent Neural Networks |editor-last=Bengio |editor-first=Yoshua |editor2-last=Schuurmans |editor2-first=Dale |editor3-last=Lafferty |editor3-first=John |editor4-last=Williams |editor4-first=Chris K.

'''Old Sorrel''', sometimes known as '''The Old Sorrel''', (1915–1945) was a [[American Quarter Horse|Quarter Horse]] [[stallion]] who was the foundation of the [[King Ranch]] [[linebreeding]] program for [[Quarter horse|Quarter Horse]]s, and the cornerstone of the King Ranch horse breeding program.&lt;ref name=DenhardtKing&gt;Denhardt ''King Ranch Quarter Horses'' pp. 87–153&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life==

Old Sorrel was foaled in 1915 and was sold that same year to the King Ranch of [[Texas]].&lt;ref name=Legends3&gt;Swan ''Legends 3'' pp. 15–26&lt;/ref&gt; He proved himself worth breeding through ranch work on the ranch, before being used as the foundation of the King Ranch Quarter Horse linebreeding program.&lt;ref name=Legends3/&gt; He died in 1945, with his last foal crop being in 1943.&lt;ref name=DenhardtKing/&gt; He was a [[Sorrel (horse)|sorrel]] [[stallion]] bred by George Clegg of [[Alice, Texas]] and sold by Clegg as a [[foal]] along with his [[Dam (disambiguation)|dam]] for $125 to the King Ranch. The King Ranch owned him until he died at the age of 31 in 1949.&lt;ref name=Beckman&gt;Beckman "El Alazan Viejo" ''Quarter Horse Journal'' pp. 36, 94, 102&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=AQHAHoF&gt;{{cite web |title=Old Sorrel |url=https://www.aqha.com/museum/hall-of-fame/horses/o/old-sorrel/ |work= AQHA Hall of Fame |author=American Quarter Horse Association (AQHA) |publisher=American Quarter Horse Association |accessdate=September 1, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

J. K. Northway, the [[veterinarian]] on the King Ranch, described Old Sorrel as &lt;blockquote&gt;I saw Richard Kleberg and George Clegg [[Team roping|rope]] off him and ride him all morning, and then race him in the afternoon. Although a stallion, and treated as such, his daily work consisted of regular ranch routine with the [[remuda]]. Bob had made him into a superior cow horse in every respect. You could rope, [[Cutting|cut]], or do any other ranch work on him, and he was not just adequate – he was superior in every respect.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Bob Kleberg, the Bob in the quote from Northway, who was one of the owners of the King Ranch and who managed it from the 1920s through to the 1950s, said that the Old Sorrel was "the best cow horse I ever rode, but he was also a good running horse. He had that well balanced look and the feel of a [[racehorse]]."&lt;ref name=Beckman/&gt;

When the [[American Quarter Horse Association]] (or AQHA) was founded in 1940, The Old Sorrel was already twenty-five years old, but the King Ranch registered him amongst the very first horses that the AQHA accepted for registration. He was given number 209 in the registry, and registered as bred by George Clegg of Alice, Texas. His sire was Hickory Bill by [[Peter McCue (horse)|Peter McCue]] and out of a Dr. Rose mare.&lt;ref name=StudBook&gt;AQHA ''Official Stud Book and Registry Combined 1–5'' p. 85&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Pedigree&gt;[http://www.allbreedpedigree.com/old+sorrel Old Sorrel Pedigree at All Breed Pedigree] retrieved on June 26, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Dam (disambiguation)|dam]] was a mare of [[Thoroughbred]] breeding that Clegg had bought from a Dr. Rose who was a dentist in Mexico as well as running a few ranches. Rose had bought some Thoroughbred mares in [[Kentucky]] to improve his horses, and eventually sold some of the mares to Clegg, without any breeding being attributed to any of them.&lt;ref name=Beckman/&gt;

The Old Sorrel sired 116 horses registered with the AQHA, but through the linebreeding program the King Ranch used, almost every horse the King Ranch registered from 1940 to the early 1960s was at least a descendant of Old Sorrel, and most were heavily [[inbred]] to him.&lt;ref name=Beckman/&gt;

Among his famous offspring were Cardinal, Solis, Little Richard P-17, Tomate Laureles P-19, Silver King, Macanudo and Hired Hand.&lt;ref name=Legends3/&gt; His grandsons included [[Wimpy P-1(horse)|Wimpy P-1]], Ranchero, Peppy, and Pep-Up.&lt;ref name=DenhardtKing/&gt; 

He was inducted into the [[American Quarter Horse Hall of Fame|AQHA Hall of Fame]] in 1990.&lt;ref name=AQHAHoF /&gt;

A '''Peshotanu''', meaning ''one who pays with his body'', according to [[Avesta]]n terminology, is a person who had either been condemned to or previously subjected to two hundred stripes with the ''Aspahe-astra'' and the ''Sraosho-karana''. Two hundred flogs with a whip was a [[capital punishment]] in Ancient Persia next only to death. A Peshotanu was also designated '''margarzan''' or  "worthy of death".

'''''Petz: Catz 2''''' and '''''Petz: Dogz 2''''' are video games for the [[Personal computer|PC]], [[Nintendo DS]], [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Wii]], the latter two are similar to ''[[The Dog Island]]''. Players can choose from 40 [[breed]]s of [[dog]]s or [[cat]]s, in Dogz most breeds have a choice of two fur colours. In the UK these games are titled ''Dogz'' and ''Catz''.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Petz Catz 2 screenshot.JPG|thumb|left|Using Sniffing in Dogz or "Whiskers Radar" in Catz, the player can find items both for completing quests or as collectables.]] --&gt;

==Wii and PS2 versions ==

Unlike the PC and DS versions, the Wii and PlayStation 2 versions of the games are actually adventure games, so instead of taking care of a virtual pet, the player plays as a dog or cat who lives in a town on a large island, and who goes on an adventure to stop an evil wolf from destroying the universe.
 
===Gameplay===
The game is based on the [[Role-playing game|role-playing]] ''The Dog Island'', in which the player controls a dog or cat through environments while completing tasks. Before the game starts, the player is asked to choose the animal's breed, sex, and finally, name, all of which have no bearing in the game itself. The player can walk, run, creep, and push rocks as locomotion. Throughout the game, the player faces a variety of hostile animals, such as snakes, gorillas, and bats, who will hurt the player if approached when they are in a hostile mood; their mood is indicated by a bubble above them. The player starts out at 3 [[Hit point|HP]], which is upgraded at certain points in the game up to 8; if all of them are depleted, the player has to start over from the last save point. The player can stun enemies by barking/meowing behind them, which can be held down for a longer effect (in the dog's case, it will turn their bark into a howl), or by throwing pebbles against them. Bubbles appear above friendly [[non-playable characters]] as well, mostly to indicate that they need the player's help for a task.

The player can explore 14 locales in the game, including the beach, lake, forest, and so on. Not all of them are open for the player at the start, requiring specific tasks to be completed first. While the player will visit every area at one point in the game, many parts are optional and can be opened by skills obtained later in the game. Once the player earns the Warp Ring from Arvin, they can warp between six locales for free through a magical stone normally used for saving. Each area has its own hazards independent from the hostile animals, such as a poisonous lake in Sky Heights, overheating in Inferno Cave, and tornadoes in Lonesome Park. Some areas host zoo animals that can be challenged for minigames, including soccer and sprint, to make them return to South Pawville's zoo, where the player can challenge them again. The game is tightly-knit as compared to ''The Dog Island''; South Pawville acts as a central hub that connects all branches of the island. Due to this, there is no traveler's inn or shop; every purchase and full healing through sleeping are therefore only conductible in South Pawville.

The game has a variety of obtainable items. Fruits, vegetables, and plot-related items are collected by sniffing and digging them (availability and location of the items are indicated in two circles that appear when the player are sniffing). The player can catch butterflies, insects, and fishes, each of which can be sold at the pawn shop in South Pawville for gold, or, in the case of fishes, sent to the aquarium for later viewing. Gold, the game's currency, is also received as reward for completing tasks and can be spent to buy healing items, accessories, and clothing.

The dog and cat editions of the game have virtually identical content, aside from the different animals populating them and certain theme naming (e.g. healing items in the game are named after meat for dogs, but tunas for cats).

===Plot===
The player is a dog or cat living in South Pawville, a town located on a large island. The player's father, Arvin, owns the Magic Hat, a family inheritance that contains a powerful magic, which can be used for good or evil. When the player's best friend Victor talks about an evil wolf named Ivlet jailed at North Pawville's police station, he invites the player to investigate. Sheriff Ada warns them against nearing Ivlet, who usually sleeps during the day. This gives Victor idea of visiting him at night.

When the two visit Ivlet that night, he tricks the player into giving him the Magic Hat. This empowers him with magic, which he uses to destroy both Pawvilles and make wild animals hostile. Ada jails the player, but is freed by Augusta, who says that the player should take responsibility by helping the townsfolk, while Victor decides to take the player's place as a compromise. Outside the police station, the player meets with Beat, the personification of the Magic Hat's good side, who asks for the player's help in retrieving back the hat.

After the player helps out all of the Pawvilles' townsfolk, they are instructed by Arvin to meet with and assist Theophilus, a wizard living in Sky Heights, in combating Ivlet. Theophilus says that the Magic Hat, normally colored blue, grows darker if always used for evil, and if it turns black, it will corrupt its user into a monster. Suppressing the hat's power requires the Magic Shield, made from three crystals: the Water, Earth, and Ice Crystals. Once the player collects them, Theophilus sends the player to rendezvous with his brother, Bartholomew, who travelled to Gongoro Peak but didn't return. The two wizards proceed to Sky Heights and plan the attack on Ivlet, who lives in an astral dimension, and invite the player to assist them. The three manage to defeat Ivlet and the dragon he summons.

Retrieving back the Magic Hat, Beat says that since his task is done, he will have to part ways with the player, before entering the Magic Hat and returning it back to its normal color. The player returns home and is welcomed by their parents, with Arvin deciding to pass the Magic Hat to the player.

==PC version==
{{Expand section|date=December 2009}}
The PC version of the game is not released in the UK. In this version, the player cares for a cat or dog, similar to the old [[Petz]] series.

==DS versions==
''Petz: Dogz 2'' and ''Petz: Catz 2'' on DS is a virtual pet game in some ways. However unlike the other platform versions, these versions for are quite different they are released in the US under those titles and are called ''Dogz 2'' and ''Catz 2'' in the UK.

In the dog version, the player can choose one of 11 breeds per game, but cannot give the pet an actual name. They can also change their pet. The pets do not need feeding, grooming or resting (although these can be done, they are not compulsory) and the main goal of the game is to furnish the player's house. The house gets larger as the player gets more items, which are acquired by playing a variety of minigames.

Along with the minigames, there is also a painting game which appears on the Main Menu after obtaining enough items. In this game the player is able to colour portraits of the breeds of the pet.

In the cat version, the player is able to adopt and name their cat, and it is required to feed, groom, and love your pet. The player can also dress up their cat, and allow it to play in various themed rooms, such as the "Safari Room"  and the "Castle Room". The player is also able to have three different loads, each with a different cat, and the main goal is to take care of the cat and gain its trust.

==GBA Version==
{{Expand section|date=March 2018}}
You take care of a dog or cat, whichever one you choose for version, will be kept with you.

'''Ronald Charles McKernan''' (September 8, 1945&amp;nbsp;– March 8, 1973), known as '''Pigpen''', was an American singer and musician. He was a founding member of the [[San Francisco Sound|San Francisco band]] the [[Grateful Dead]] and played in the group from 1965 to 1972.

McKernan grew up heavily influenced by [[African-American]] music, particularly the [[blues]], and enjoyed listening to his father's collection of records and taught himself how to play [[harmonica]] and [[piano]]. He began socializing around the [[San Francisco Bay Area]], becoming friends with [[Jerry Garcia]]. After the pair had played in various folk and jug bands, McKernan suggested they form an electric group, which became the Grateful Dead. He was the band's original frontman as well as playing harmonica and [[Electronic organ|electric organ]], but Garcia and bassist [[Phil Lesh]]'s influences on the band became increasingly stronger as they embraced [[psychedelic rock]]. McKernan struggled to keep up with the changing music, causing the group to hire keyboardist [[Tom Constanten]], with McKernan's contributions essentially limited to vocals, harmonica and percussion from November 1968 to January 1970. He continued to be a frontman in concert for some numbers, including covers of [[Bobby Bland]]'s "[[Turn On Your Love Light]]" and [[the Rascals]]' "[[Good Lovin']]".

Unlike the other members of the Grateful Dead, McKernan avoided [[psychedelic drugs]], preferring to drink [[Alcoholic drink|alcohol]] (namely [[whiskey]] and [[flavored fortified wine]]). By 1971, his health had been affected by [[alcoholism]] and [[hepatotoxicity|liver damage]] and doctors advised him to stop touring. Following a hiatus, he resumed touring with the group in December 1971 but was forced to retire from touring altogether in June 1972. McKernan was found dead of a [[gastrointestinal hemorrhage]] on March 8, 1973, aged  [[27 Club|27]], and is buried at [[Alta Mesa Memorial Park]] in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Ronald Charles McKernan was born on September 8, 1945, in [[San Bruno, California]].{{sfn|Stanton|2003|p=102}} He came from Irish ancestry, and his father, Phil McKernan, was an  [[Rhythm and blues|R&amp;B]] and [[blues]] [[disc jockey]], who had been one of the first white DJs on [[KDIA]], a black radio station.{{sfn|Scully|2001|p=24}}{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=260}} Ronald grew up with [[African American]] friends and enjoyed [[African American music|black music]] and [[African American culture|culture]].{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=185}} As a youth, he taught himself blues [[piano]], [[guitar]] and [[harmonica]]{{sfn|Lavezzoli|2006|p=83}} and developed a [[Outlaw motorcycle club|biker culture]] image. McKernan moved to Palo Alto, California, with his family, where he became friends with musician [[Jerry Garcia]] at the age of 14.{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=260}} He built up a substantial collection of old blues [[78 rpm|78s]] from labels such as [[Kent Records|Kent]] and [[Chess Records|Chess]].{{sfn|Scully|2001|p=26}}

McKernan began spending time around [[coffeehouse]]s and music stores, and worked at Dana Morgan's Music Store in Palo Alto with Garcia.{{sfn|Scully|2001|pp=23–24}} One night Garcia invited McKernan on stage to play harmonica and sing the blues. Garcia was impressed and McKernan became the blues singer in local [[jam session]]s. He was initially nicknamed "Blue Ron" before settling on "Pigpen".{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=260}} [[Onomastician]] [[Adrian Room]] has suggested McKernan was given the name due to his untidy and unclean habits{{sfn|Room|2010|p=380}} and band biographies say he got the nickname owing to his similarity to [[Pig-Pen]], the permanently-dirty character in the comic-strip ''[[Peanuts]]''.{{sfn|Hollow|2009|p=30}}

===Grateful Dead===
{{main article|Grateful Dead}}
Along with Garcia and second guitarist [[Bob Weir]], McKernan was a participant in the predecessor groups leading to the formation of the Grateful Dead, beginning with the Zodiacs and [[Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions (album)|Mother McCree's Uptown Jug Champions]].{{sfn|Malvinni|2013|p=1}} Drummer [[Bill Kreutzmann]] was added and the band evolved into the Warlocks. Around 1965, McKernan urged the rest of the Warlocks to switch to electric instruments. Bassist [[Phil Lesh]] joined soon after, and they became the [[Grateful Dead]]. The group were keen to involve McKernan in the band, as he was the group's original leader and was considered the best singer and frontman.{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=187}}{{sfn|Malvinni|2013|p=2}}

The Dead's early sets centered around blues and R&amp;B covers chosen by McKernan.{{sfn|Malvinni|2013|p=28}} By the end of 1966, Garcia had improved his musical skills and wanted to assert himself more as a leader and musical director, changing the band's direction and reducing McKernan's contributions.{{sfn|Malvinni|2013|p=42}}{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=188}} In 1967, drummer [[Mickey Hart]] joined the Grateful Dead, followed by classically trained keyboardist [[Tom Constanten]] in 1968, further changing the group's style. Constanten often replaced McKernan on keyboards in the studio, as McKernan found it difficult to adapt to the new material that Garcia and Lesh composed for the band.{{sfn|Scully|2001|pp=150,154,155}}

In October 1968, McKernan and Weir were nearly fired from the band after Garcia and Lesh believed their playing was holding the band back from lengthy and experimental jamming.{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=189}}  Garcia delegated the task of firing them to [[Rock Scully]], who said that McKernan "took it hard."{{sfn|Scully|2001|p=151}} Weir promised to improve, but McKernan was more stubborn.{{sfn|Jackson|1999|p=156}} According to Garcia biographer Blair Jackson, McKernan missed three Dead shows before vowing not to "be lazy" any more and rejoining, while Kreutzmann objected to replacing McKernan and said the event never happened.{{sfn|Jackson|1999|p=156}}{{sfn|Kreutzmann|Eisen|2015|p=95}} Following his discharge from the [[United States Air Force]] in November 1968, Constanten officially joined the band, having only worked in the studio while on leave up to that point. Road manager Jon McIntire commented that "Pigpen was relegated to the congas at that point and it was really humiliating and he was really hurt, but he couldn't show it, couldn't talk about it."{{sfn|Jackson|1999|p=157}} He began to take [[Hammond organ]] lessons and learned how to use the various [[Hammond organ#Drawbars|drawbars]] and controls.{{sfn|Scully|2001|p=155}}

After Constanten's departure in January 1970 over musical and lifestyle differences, McKernan nominally resumed keyboard duties. He contributed instrumentation to only two tracks ([[Hammond organ]] on "Black Peter" and [[harmonica]] on "Easy Wind", the latter as lead vocalist) on ''[[Workingman's Dead]]'' (1970), the band's breakthrough studio release.  On the follow-up album ''[[American Beauty (album)|American Beauty]]'', keyboard parts were handled by Garcia and Lesh, along with session musicians [[Howard Wales]] and [[Ned Lagin]].  The 1971 live album ''[[Grateful Dead (album)|Grateful Dead]]'' featured three overdubbed organ parts from [[Merl Saunders]] in addition to McKernan's contributions on "Big Railroad Blues", "The Other One", and "Me &amp; Bobby McGee".{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=151}} While Garcia expressed frustration at McKernan's missed rehearsals and his inability to keep up with new material,{{sfn|Scully|2001|p=208}} Lesh was more forgiving, opining that "it was okay for Pigpen to lay out... we kept wanting Pigpen to be there because he was 'one of us.'"{{sfn|Jackson|1999|p=226}}

While in the Grateful Dead, McKernan sang and played blues-influenced [[Electronic organ|organ]] and harmonica. He initially played an indeterminate [[Farfisa]] [[combo organ]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SiTGAQR-W3YC&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=pigpen+farfisa&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjEs7-RpPzcAhUKhOAKHSrPAn0Q6AEIJzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=farfisa&amp;f=false|title=Grateful Dead Gear: The Band's Instruments, Sound Systems, and Recording Sessions from 1965 to 1995|first=Blair|last=Jackson|date=November 21, 2018|publisher=Hal Leonard Corporation|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; before switching to the more elaborate [[Vox Continental]]{{sfn|Scully|2001|p=24}} in 1966. He began to alternate between the Vox Continental and the Hammond B-3 in June 1967, usually reserving the former instrument for outdoor and impromptu concerts, including the band's performance at the [[Columbia University protests of 1968]].&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadessays.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-vox-and-hammond-1967-1969.html|title=Grateful Dead Guide: The Vox and the Hammond, 1967-1969|first=Light Into|last=Ashes|date=February 29, 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During Tom Constanten's tenure with the group, McKernan occasionally played his bandmate's double-manual Vox Super Continental on select songs (most notably "Death Don't Have No Mercy") through May 1969.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; With the exception of select acoustic sets in 1970 in which he played acoustic piano&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/gd70-08-19.aud.cotsman.11797.sbeok.shnf|title=Grateful Dead Live at Fillmore West on 1970-08-19|first=|last=Grateful Dead|date=August 19, 1970|publisher=|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;, he used the Hammond exclusively thereafter.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

McKernan sang lead on several standards he wanted the Dead to cover, such as [[Otis Redding]]'s "Pain in My Heart" and [[Wilson Pickett]]'s "[[In the Midnight Hour]]", with the latter serving as one of the band's main improvisatory vehicles from 1966 to 1968.{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=192}}{{sfn|Malvinni|2013|p=17}}  Unlike fellow vocalists Garcia and Weir, he sang lead without playing any instrument except harmonica and actively interacted with the audience, occasionally walking out into the crowd.{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=185}}  During the band's first year when they played straightforward blues, McKernan performed the majority of lead vocals, attracting an early audience that came specifically to see him sing and play harmonica. He took on early management duties in the band, ensuring they would be paid and promoted properly for gigs.{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=260}}

Though McKernan's [[garage rock]] style was appropriate for their early recordings, it was less suited to the group's later psychedelic and jamming styles.{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=189}} He went from contributing to every song and singing lead on all of side two of 1968's ''[[Anthem of the Sun]]'' to little more than sporadic appearances on the following year's ''[[Aoxomoxoa]]''.{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=189}} He continued to front the band for long stretches during their live performances and suggested new material for the Dead's concert repertoire, including Redding's "[[Hard to Handle (song)|Hard to Handle]]" and [[James Brown]]'s "[[It's a Man's Man's Man's World]]."{{sfn|Malvinni|2013|pp=17, 44}}

McKernan achieved a new prominence in 1969 covering "[[Turn On Your Love Light]]"; initially introduced in 1967, the song gradually evolved into the band's show-stopping finale, often taking fifteen to thirty minutes to complete. He improvised lyrics over the band's accompaniment, using phrases he had heard from African American friends, such as "rider" (slang for "lover"), "she's got box-black nitties" (referring to female underwear) and "boar hog's eye".{{sfn|Malvinni|2013|p=57}} When the Grateful Dead appeared at [[Woodstock]], the band's set (which was marred by technical problems and general chaos and described as one of their worst shows) ended with "Turn On Your Love Light".{{sfn|Perone|2005|pp=120–121}} Even as his instrumental contributions waned, McKernan's vocal performances remained an integral part of the band's live set; by early 1971, their cover of [[the Rascals]]' "Good Lovin'" (initially performed by the group as early as 1966 and featured at shows at the [[Fillmore East]] later released as ''[[Ladies and Gentlemen... the Grateful Dead]]'') began to emerge as a secondary showcase of his improvisatory talents alongside "Love Light."{{sfn|Malvinni|2013|p=60}}{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=145}}

McKernan was not a prolific songwriter, preferring to concentrate on blues covers and improvised lyrics. He composed the infrequently performed "Operator" for 1970's ''American Beauty''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/american-beauty-mw0000192627|title=American Beauty – Grateful Dead|publisher=[[AllMusic]]|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several new songs emerged from a creatively fecund period coinciding with his health problems in 1971, most notably "Mr. Charlie", a collaboration with Dead lyricist [[Robert Hunter (lyricist)|Robert Hunter]]. The song appeared on the live album ''[[Europe '72]]'', his last with the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/europe-72-mw0000199230|title=Europe '72 – Grateful Dead|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tony Sclafani has compared McKernan's role in the band, initially strong and pivotal but gradually declining, to that of [[Brian Jones]] in [[the Rolling Stones]], particularly since both men were primarily influenced by the blues over rock 'n' roll and [[27 Club|died aged 27]]. In contrast, though, McKernan was always encouraged to sing material live and left the group due to ill health, while Jones was fired.{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=189}}

After McKernan's death, a number of recordings were found in his apartment, which have appeared as the [[bootleg recording]] ''The Apartment Tapes''. This included two songs recorded in 1964 with future [[Jefferson Airplane]] guitarist [[Jorma Kaukonen]]. On the bootleg, McKernan played [[acoustic guitar]] and [[piano]], instruments he seldom used with the Dead.{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|pp=191–192}}

==Personal life==
McKernan was close friends with American singer-songwriter [[Janis Joplin]] due to common musical influences and lifestyles, particularly a shared love of [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] over other drugs;{{sfn|Sounes|2013|p=95}} a poster from the early 1970s showed them together at 710 Ashbury.{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=191}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bonhams Auctioneers |url=http://www.bonhams.com/cgi-bin/public.sh/pubweb/publicSite.r?sContinent=USA&amp;screen=lotdetailsNoFlash&amp;iSaleItemNo=3507408&amp;iSaleNo=15537&amp;iSaleSectionNo=1 |title=Lot Details |publisher=Bonhams.com |date=May 8, 2007 |accessdate=March 22, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Joplin joined McKernan on stage at the [[Fillmore West]] on June 7, 1969, with the Grateful Dead to sing his signature "Turn On Your Love Light",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dead.net/show/june-07-1969|title=June 7, 1969|publisher=dead.net (Grateful Dead official website)|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; reprising this duet on July 16, 1970, at the Euphoria Ballroom in San Rafael, California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dead.net/show/july-16-1970|title=July 16, 1970|publisher=dead.net (Grateful Dead official website)|accessdate=July 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|By co-incidence, both died at the [[27 Club|age of 27]] - Joplin died of a [[heroin overdose]] in October 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/99/05/02/specials/joplin-obit.html|title=Obituary : Janis Joplin|work=New York Times|accessdate=13 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He developed a close friendship with fellow keyboardist [[Tom Constanten]] based on their mutual aversion to psychedelics{{sfn|Scully|2001|p=155}} and eventually served as best man at Constanten's first wedding.{{sfn|Conners|2013|p=91}} While his bandmates and friends were using [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]], [[LSD]], and other hallucinogenic drugs, McKernan preferred alcoholic beverages such as [[Thunderbird (wine)|Thunderbird]] and [[Southern Comfort]].{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=188}}{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=152}} Ironically, McKernan was arrested and fined after the cannabis bust on November 9, 1967, at 710 Ashbury Street, the Dead's communal home, even though he did not use the drug.{{sfn|Kreutzmann|Eisen|2015|p=79}} The event was covered in the first issue of ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', where the reporter noted McKernan had a substantial rifle collection&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/music/news/the-grateful-dead-did-get-it-reporters-and-cops-19671109|title=The Grateful Dead Did Get It: Reporters and Cops|work=Rolling Stone|number=1|date=November 9, 1967|accessdate=14 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and McKernan's picture appeared on a contemporary report in the ''[[San Francisco Chronicle]]''. Because neither took illegal drugs, McKernan and Constanten were the only members of the band not arrested in the January 31, 1970 police raid that inspired the lyrics of the band's song "[[Truckin']]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ultimateclassicrock.com/grateful-dead-truckin-drug-bust/|title=45 Years Ago: The Grateful Dead’s Infamous ‘Truckin’’ Drug Bust|first=Dave|last=Lifton|work=Classic Rock Magazine|date=January 31, 2015|accessdate=September 16, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years of the Grateful Dead, McKernan was easily recognisable by his biker image, making him a minor celebrity. In 1969, the band's record company, [[Warner Bros. Records|Warner Bros.]], ran a "Pigpen Look-Alike Contest".{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=191}}

==Health and death==
[[File:Pigpen gravestone.jpg|thumb|300px|McKernan's headstone in [[Alta Mesa Memorial Park]]. The inscription reads "Pigpen was and is now forever one of the Grateful Dead".]]
McKernan's alcohol abuse had begun to affect his health by his mid twenties.{{sfn|Sclafani|2013|p=188}}  By the early 1970s, he also began to experience symptoms of congenital [[primary biliary cholangitis]], a rare autoimmune disease which was unrelated to his use of alcohol. After being hospitalized in August 1971, doctors requested that he stop touring indefinitely.{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=261}} Pianist [[Keith Godchaux]] was subsequently hired and remained a regular member of the Grateful Dead until 1979.{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=142}} McKernan rejoined the band in December 1971{{sfn|Jackson|1999|p=226}} to supplement Godchaux on harmonica, percussion, and organ. Although manager Rock Scully alleged that McKernan passed out in front of his Hammond organ at one show during this period, Garcia biographer Blair Jackson has lauded the quality and frequency of his instrumental contributions on the ''[[Europe '72]]'' tour.{{sfn|Scully|2001|p=212}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dead.net/features/blair-jackson/blair%E2%80%99s-golden-road-blog-keyboardist-question|title=Blair’s Golden Road Blog - The Keyboardist Question - Grateful Dead|website=www.dead.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, his health soon deteriorated again to the point where he could no longer continue to perform. He made his final concert appearance on June 17, 1972 at the [[Hollywood Bowl]] in [[Los Angeles]].{{sfn|Stanton|2003|p=103}} He subsequently broke off all personal relationships with the band, explaining "I don't want you around when I die."{{sfn|Sounes|2013|p=96}}

On March 8, 1973, aged 27, he was found dead of a [[gastrointestinal hemorrhage]] at his home in [[Corte Madera, California]], by his landlady.{{sfn|Sounes|2013|p=96}} Though his contributions to the band had slowly diminished over the years, the other members were devastated at his death.{{sfn|Scully|2001|p=230}} McKernan was buried at the [[Alta Mesa Memorial Park]] in [[Palo Alto, California]].{{sfn|Stanton|2003|p=103}}{{efn|Plot: Hillview Section 16 Lot 374{{sfn|Stanton|2003|p=103}}}} Garcia spoke at his funeral, saying "After Pigpen's death we all knew this was the end of the original Grateful Dead".{{sfn|Scully|2001|p=230}}

==Legacy==
Despite his outward image, friends and band biographers have described McKernan as a quiet, kind and introspective person. Hart later said "Pigpen was the ''musician'' in the Grateful Dead."{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=260}} Kreutzmann said McKernan was "the sweetest guy anybody had ever met."{{sfn|Kreutzmann|Eisen|2015|p=58}}

Weir later became influenced by McKernan's ability to work a crowd and improvise lyrics. He took over ''de facto'' frontman duties in concert and began to reintroduce material originally chosen by McKernan into the Dead's live set after his death.{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=399}}{{sfn|Malvinni|2013|p=260}} Weir began singing "Good Lovin'" with the Dead in 1973, and the group recorded the song on 1978's ''[[Shakedown Street]]''.{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=145}} "Turn On Your Love Light" was revived in 1981, with Weir singing lead. He also revived the 1960s standard "Big Boy Pete", originally sung by McKernan, as a one-off in 1985.{{sfn|Trager|1997|pp=38, 378}} [[Jimmy Reed]]'s "[[Big Boss Man (song)|Big Boss Man]]", covered by the group on ''[[Grateful Dead (album)|Grateful Dead (Skull and Roses)]]'' with McKernan singing lead, was revived by Garcia and performed occasionally through the 1980s and 90s.{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=37}}

"He's Gone", originally appearing on the live album ''[[Europe '72]]'', subsequently became a eulogy to McKernan by his former bandmates. Hunter said "it became an anthem for Pigpen".{{sfn|Trager|1997|p=176}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20466">A series of uncoordinated mass stabbings, hammer attacks, and cleaver attacks in the [[People's Republic of China]] began in March 2010.  The spate of attacks left at least 25 dead and some 115 injured. As most cases had no known motive, analysts have blamed [[mental health]] problems caused by rapid social change for the rise in these kinds of [[mass murder]] and [[murder-suicide]] incidents.&lt;ref name="BBC 8670662"&gt;{{cite news

==Causes==
Prof. Joshua Miller, chair of Social Welfare Policy  at [[Smith College]], attributed the attacks to [[Stress (biological)|stress]] caused by  "rapid social change, mass migrations, increasing disparities in wealth and weakening of traditions."&lt;ref name="social stress"&gt;{{cite news

| title=  Experts attribute social stress to school attacks
| publisher=  china.org.cn/[[Xinhua]]
| date=  May 9, 2010
| accessdate= 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some [[sociologist]]s believe some of these attacks may be due to the [[PRC government]]'s failure to diagnose and treat [[mental illness]].&lt;ref name="Says 13 Hurt" /&gt; The perpetrators may feel victimized by [[Stress (biology)|stress]] due to the rapid [[social change]]s&lt;ref name="Says 13 Hurt" /&gt; in China during the last 10 years caused by the [[privatization]] and decreased [[social security]] of China's [[reform and opening]] period. During this time, more and more [[migrant worker]]s from rural areas have moved to cities such as [[Shanghai]] to find jobs. However, because they do not have social security (because of the [[hukou system]]), many of them do not have [[health insurance]]. Because of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2010]], some have lost their jobs, which is [[social stigma|stigmatized]] in China, and have had to return to their native villages jobless and [[unemployed]]. The choice of schools for most of the attacks means they could be [[copycat crimes]].&lt;ref name="Says 13 Hurt" /&gt;&lt;ref name="social stress" /&gt;

Another factor is China's male-based gender imbalance cause by the [[one child policy]], in which there are a lot of single men frustrated at the dating market in China and their low prospects. They are then more likely to resort to violence.&lt;ref&gt;http://thebrooklynink.com/2011/12/08/38794-millions-of-women-are-missing-but-does-anyone-notice/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction and response==
Since the recent spate of attacks, many parents are now worried about their children's safety in schools and have since asked local officials and school governors to step up security at the schools. The education ministry has formed an emergency panel to tackle the violence and some local police authorities have distributed such instruments as steel [[pitchfork]]s and [[pepper spray]] to security guards in schools. However, not all schools increased their security because of lack of funds to hire extra security. The state media has also been keeping news of these attacks quiet by [[Internet censorship in the People's Republic of China|deleting forum entries on the internet]] and releasing few facts on the incident for fear of [[copycat crimes]] and mass panic. In May 2010 [[Chinese Premier]] [[Wen Jiabao]] commented on the school attacks and said that the 'social tensions' in China must be addressed. He also said society was changing rapidly and that subsequent changes in policy were needed. Why these attacks have been specifically targeted at young school children is not entirely explicable, however.&lt;ref name="Social tensions behind China school attacks"&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the Chenpeng school attack, the Chinese government began posting security guards in schools throughout the country. It was planned that all schools have a security guard by 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thaindian.com/newsportal/world-news/china-to-deploy-more-security-guards-at-schools_100638848.html China to deploy more security guards at schools - Thaindian News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stella Hume''' (4 October 1882 – 3 January 1954) was an early figure in radio in [[South Australia]].

==Biography==
Stella Hume was born in Victoria. Not much is known of her life until she married Ernest James Hume (1869-1929), in [[Mosman, New South Wales|Mosman]], a suburb of [[Sydney]] in 1905 and moved with him to [[Adelaide, South Australia]]&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Robinson Whittle, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hume-stella-leonora-harriette-10571/text18775 'Hume, Stella Leonora Harriette (1882–1954)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 4 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; where Ernest Hume was developing a business with his brother [[Walter Reginald Hume]], manufacturing steel and pipes, and eventually inventing patented products.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Academy of Science.

Hume worked in several cultural industries in [[Adelaide, South Australia|Adelaide]] while raising her four children, including teaching elocution lessons.

In 1923, the Hume family, led by Stella's sons [[Jack Hume]] and Ernest Hume, Jr., became interested in the new technology of radio transmission and saw in the potential for cultural, social and education opportunities afforded by the technology.&lt;ref&gt;Nancy Robinson Whittle, [http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/hume-stella-leonora-harriette-10571/text18775 'Hume, Stella Leonora Harriette (1882–1954)'], ''Australian Dictionary of Biography'', National Centre of Biography, Australian National University, published in hardcopy 1996, accessed online 4 May 2014&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, they acquired equipment and established a radio studio in their home on Park Terrace (later Greenhill Road) at [[Parkside, South Australia|Parkside]], receiving a permit to broadcast from their home studio. The station became 5 Don N and later 5DN. The station became increasingly popular and went from broadcasting for a few hours per day to continuous broadcasting. Including broadcasting from their home, the family broadcast from the Elder Conservatorium of Music and the University of Adelaide.

In [[biology]], '''stolons''' (from [[Latin]] [[wikt:stolo|stolō]] "branch"), also known as runners, are horizontal connections between organisms. They may be part of the organism, or of its [[skeleton]]; typically, [[animal]] stolons are [[external skeleton]]s.

==In botany==
In [[botany]], stolons are [[plant stem|stem]]s which grow at the [[soil]] surface or just below ground that form [[adventitious roots]] at the [[Node (botany)|node]]s, and new plants from the [[bud]]s.&lt;ref name=Hickey&amp;King&gt;{{cite book|author1=Hickey, M. |author2=King, C. |year=2001 |title= The Cambridge Illustrated Glossary of Botanical Terms |publisher=Cambridge University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stolons are often called '''runners'''. [[Rhizome]]s, in contrast, are root-like stems that may either grow horizontally at the soil surface or in other orientations underground.&lt;ref name=Hickey&amp;King/&gt; Thus, not all horizontal stems are called stolons. Plants with stolons are called '''stoloniferous'''.

A stolon is a [[plant propagation]] strategy and the complex of individuals formed by a mother plant and all its [[Cloning|clones]] produced from stolons form a single genetic individual, a [[genet (biology)|genet]].

=== Morphology ===
[[File:Corm stolons5680.jpg|left|thumb|These stolons from the [[corm]] of a ''[[Crocosmia]]'' are stems that emerged from axillary buds at the nodes of the [[bulb|tunic leaves]].]]
Stolons may or may not have long [[internode (botany)|internode]]s. The leaves along the stolon are usually very small, but in a few cases such as ''[[Stachys sylvatica]]'' are normal in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Goebel, K.E.v. |origyear=1905|year=1969 |title= Organography of plants, especially of the Archegoniatae and Spermaphyta |publisher=Hofner publishing company |location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stolons arise from the base of the plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gleason| first=Henry A.| authorlink=Henry Gleason|title=The new Britton and Brown illustrated flora of the Northeastern United States and adjacent Canada, Volume 1| location=New York| publisher=Hafner Press| isbn=0-02-845240-2|year=1963| page=ixxiv}}&lt;/ref&gt; In strawberries the base is above the soil surface; in many bulb-forming species and plants with rhizomes, the stolons remain underground and form shoots that rise to the surface at the ends or from the nodes. The nodes of the stolons produce roots, often all around the node and hormones produced by the roots cause the stolon to initiate shoots with normal leaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Woolley| first=D. J.| author2=P. F. Wareing|date=March 1972| title=The role of roots, cytokinins and apical dominance in the control of lateral shoot form in ''Solanum andigena''|journal=Planta | volume=105| issue=1| pages=33–42 |doi=10.1007/BF00385161| pmid=24477700}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically after the formation of the new plant the stolon dies away&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Wijesinghe | first=Dushyantha K. | author2=Dennis F.

The horizontal growth of stolons results from the interplay of different hormones produced at the growing point and hormones from the main plant, with some studies showing that stolon and rhizome growth are affected by the amount of shady light the plant receives with increased production and branching from plants exposed to mixed shade and sun, while plants in all day sun or all shade produce fewer stolons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first= M.| last = Méthy| author2 = P.

A number of plants have soil-level or above-ground rhizomes, including ''[[Iris (plant)|Iris]]'' species and many [[orchid]] species.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
T. Holm (1929) restricted the term rhizome to a horizontal, usually subterranean, stem that produces roots from its lower surface and green leaves from its apex, developed directly from the plumule of the embryo. He recognized stolons as axillary, subterranean branches that do not bear green leaves but only membranaceous, scale-like ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last=Henderson| first=Norton C.| title=''Iris''|url= http://www.efloras.org/florataxon.aspx?flora_id=1&amp;taxon_id=116503| work=Flora of North America| publisher=eFloras.org| accessdate=2005-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some ''[[Cyperus]]'' species the stolons end with the growth of tubers; the tubers are swollen stolons that form new plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| last=Tucker| first=Gordon C.|author2=Brian G.

Some [[species]] of crawling plants can also sprout adventitious roots, but are not considered stoloniferous: a stolon is sprouted from an existing stem and can produce a full individual. Examples of plants that extend through stolons include some species from the [[Genus|genera]] ''[[Argentina (plant)|Argentina]]'' (silverweed), ''[[Cynodon]]'', ''[[strawberry|Fragaria]]'', and ''[[Pilosella]]'' (Hawkweeds), ''[[Zoysia]] japonica'', ''[[Ranunculus repens]]''.

Other plants with stolons below the soil surface include many grasses, ''[[Ajuga]]'', ''[[Mentha]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Aflatuni| first=Abbas|author2=J. Uusitalo |author3=S.

[[Lily-of-the-valley]] (''Convallaria majalis'') has rhizomes that grow stolon-like stems called stoloniferous rhizomes or leptomorph rhizomes. A number of plants have stoloniferous rhizomes including [[Aster (genus)|Asters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Jones |first=Almut G. |date=January 1978 |title=Observations on Reproduction and Phenology in Some Perennial Asters |journal=American Midland Naturalist |volume=99 |issue=1 |pages=184–97 |doi=10.2307/2424942 |jstor=2424942}}&lt;/ref&gt; These stolon-like rhizomes are long and thin, with long internodes and indeterminate growth with lateral buds at the node, which mostly remain dormant.

Since it is ''not'' a rhizome it does not generate roots, but the new stem growth that grows to the surface produces roots. See also [[BBCH-scale (potato)]]

''[[Erythronium]]'', commonly called Trout Lily, have white stolons growing from the bulb. Most run horizontally, either underground or along the surface of the ground under leaf litter. A number of [[bulb]]ous species produce stolons, such as ''[[Erythronium propullans]]''. Flowering plants often produce no stolons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=weakley| first=Alan S.| title=Flora of the Carolinas, Virginia, and Georgia, and Surrounding Areas, Part 6| url=http://www.herbarium.unc.edu/WeakleysFloraPart6.pdf| format=PDF| pages=808| accessdate=2005-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In studies on [[grass]] species, with plants that produce stolons or rhizomes and plants that produce both stolons and rhizomes, morphological and physiological differences were noticed. Stolons have longer internodes and function as means of seeking out light and are used for propagation of the plant, while rhizomes are used as storage organs for carbohydrates and the maintenance of meristem tissue to keep the parent plant alive from one year to the next.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pierdominici |first=Maria Grazia |author2=Ming Dong  |date=January 1995 |title= Morphology and growth of stolons and rhizomes in three clonal grasses, as affected by different light supply |journal=Plant Ecology |volume=116 |issue=1 |pages=25–32 |doi=10.1007/BF00045274|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p2672v2617k61473/| accessdate=2005-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In mycology==

In [[mycology]], a stolon is defined as an occasionally septate [[hypha]], which connects [[sporangiophore]]s&lt;!-- should this link to sporangium? --&gt; together. Root-like structures called [[rhizoid]]s may appear on the stolon as well, anchoring the hyphae to the [[Substrate (biology)|substrate]]. The stolon is commonly found in [[bread mold]]s, and are seen as horizontally expanding across the mold.

'''Stroke Belt''' or '''Stroke Alley''' is a name given to a region in the [[southeastern United States]] that has been recognized by public health authorities for having an unusually high incidence of [[stroke]] and other forms of [[cardiovascular disease]]. It is usually defined as a 9-state region consisting of [[Alabama]], [[Arkansas]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Kentucky]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], and [[Tennessee]].

Although many possible causes for the high stroke incidence have been investigated, the reasons for the phenomenon have not been determined.

==Geographic scope==
[[File:Stroke Death Rates 2002-2007 Adults 35+ by county US.png|thumb|350px|Stroke death rates 2002-2007, adults 35+ by US county.]]
The stroke belt is typically defined to include the [[U.S. state|state]]s of Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Kentucky, Louisiana, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.everydayhealth.com/stroke/stroke-risk-higher-in-southeastern-us.aspx&lt;/ref&gt; In 1980 these nine states had age-adjusted stroke [[mortality rate]]s more than 10% above the national average.&lt;ref name=Lessons&gt;[http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/other/sb_spec.pdf Stroke Belt Initiative: Project Accomplishments and Lessons Learned] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081001162318/http://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/health/prof/heart/other/sb_spec.pdf |date=2008-10-01 }}, National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute, National Institutes of Health; reports on a conference that occurred in 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Some investigators also consider [[North Florida]] to be a part of the stroke belt, based on a stroke mortality rate higher than several states included in the region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Siegel PZ, Wolfe LE, Wilcox D, Deeb LC |title=North Florida is part of the stroke belt |journal=Public Health Rep |volume=107 |issue=5 |pages=540–3 |year=1992 |pmid=1410234 |pmc=1403695 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[East Texas]] also is characterized as a stroke belt.&lt;ref&gt;Emily Ramshaw, [https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/14/us/14ttexpectancy.html East Texans’ Bad Health and Bad Habits Promote a ‘Stroke Belt’], ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 14, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of observations==
[[File:Lung cancer US distribution.gif|thumb|350px|High rates of lung cancer (indicated in this map by brown colors) are highly correlated with the Stroke Belt.]]
The stroke belt was first identified in 1962 by [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|Centers for Disease Control (CDC)]] researchers who noted a concentration of high stroke [[mortality rate|death rate]]s in the [[Atlantic coastal plain]] counties of [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]] and [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].&lt;ref name=friedfat&gt;[http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/02/14/health/main673897.shtml Combating Southern Fried Fat], CBS News, February 14, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Similar high stroke rates were later observed in the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain|Mississippi Delta]] region as well.&lt;ref name=friedfat/&gt;&lt;ref name=Casper&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Casper ML, Wing S, Anda RF, Knowles M, Pollard RA |title=The shifting stroke belt.

Analysis by the CDC of U.S. [[mortality rate|mortality statistics]] from the period 1991 to 1998 found that for both [[African American|blacks]] and [[White people|white]]s the [[U.S. county|counties]] with the highest stroke death rates were in the southeastern states and the [[Mississippi Delta]] region. Stroke death rates for states ranged from a high of 169 per 100,000 in South Carolina to a low of 89 per 100,000 in [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/od/oc/media/pressrel/r030220.htm CDC Releases Atlas of Stroke Mortality], Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Chronic Disease Prevention &amp; Health Promotion, February 20, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; While most observational studies have focused primarily on stroke incidence in adults, in 2004 researchers reported that children in the eleven stroke belt states also have an increased risk of death from [[stroke#Ischemic|ischemic]] and [[stroke#Hemorrhagic|hemorrhagic stroke]] compared with children in other states.&lt;ref name=Pediatric&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Fullerton HJ, Elkins JS, Johnston SC |title=Pediatric Stroke Belt: geographic variation in stroke mortality in US children |journal=Stroke |volume=35 |issue=7 |pages=1570–3 |date=Jul 2004 |pmid=15178830 |doi=10.1161/01.STR.0000130514.21773.95 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/abstract/35/7/1570}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses on causation==
[[File:Census2000 Percent Black Map.jpg|thumb|350px|Black percentage of the population, US Census 2000.]]
The causes of the elevated incidence of stroke in the stroke belt region have not been determined.&lt;ref name=Casper/&gt;&lt;ref name=WornChildhood&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Glymour MM, Avendaño M, Berkman LF |title=Is the 'stroke belt' worn from childhood?: risk of first stroke and state of residence in childhood and adulthood |journal=Stroke |volume=38 |issue=9 |pages=2415–21 |date=Sep 2007 |pmid=17673716 |doi=10.1161/STROKEAHA.107.482059 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/content/full/38/9/2415}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SBEI/&gt;&lt;ref name=Newsweek&gt;[http://www.newsweek.com/id/117733 Stroke Mystery], ''[[Newsweek]]'', November 8, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous possible contributing factors have been identified, including hypertension, low [[socioeconomic status]], diet, cultural lifestyle, quality of healthcare facilities, [[smoking]], and [[infection]]s.&lt;ref name=Nainggolan/&gt; Among the specific factors that have been proposed or studied are the following:

* It has been suggested that the higher stroke death rates in the stroke belt are due to the region's high [[African American]] population, because African Americans' stroke death rates are higher than the national average.&lt;ref&gt;African American males age 45 to 54 have a threefold greater risk of ischemic stroke than white males in the same age range.[http://www.strokecenter.org/patients/stats.htm]&lt;/ref&gt; However, because White people also have higher rates of stroke death in the stroke belt than in other parts of the country, the higher death rates in the stroke belt cannot be attributed solely to the region's higher proportion of African Americans.&lt;ref name=Lessons/&gt;
* In the early 1990s it was hypothesized that [[selenium]] deficiency in the [[soil]]s of the coastal plain might be a causative factor.&lt;ref&gt;Felicity Barringer, [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9E0CE0DD1431F93AA15754C0A964958260 Toward Solving the Mystery Of the American 'Stroke Belt' ], ''[[The New York Times]]'', July 29, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; The subsequent recognition of high stroke incidence in areas with different soil characteristics led researchers to reject this hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/DHDSP/library/maps/strokeatlas/02-introduction.htm Introduction], ''Atlas of Stroke Mortality: Racial, Ethnic, and Geographic Disparities in the United States'' (Casper ML, Barnett E, Williams GI Jr., Halverson JA, Braham VE, Greenlund KJ). Atlanta, GA: Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
*Some observers have assumed that more stroke belt residents suffer from untreated [[hypertension]]. However, researchers have found that residents of the [[southern United States]] are as likely to be aware of hypertension and receiving treatment as residents of other U.S. regions.&lt;ref name=Nainggolan&gt;Lisa Nainggolan, [http://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/538637 Hypertension may not be the whole story in the Stroke Belt], Medscape Medical News, February 9, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, researchers who documented the region's elevated incidence of pediatric stroke noted that "If the stroke belt is solely caused by regional differences in [[Stroke#Risk factors|atherosclerotic stroke risk factors]], it should not apply to children."&lt;ref name=Pediatric/&gt;
*It has been suggested that one cause of higher mortality may be the predominantly rural character of the region, which increases the distances that patients must travel to obtain emergency medical treatment.&lt;ref name=Newsweek/&gt; Regional differences in standards of medical care have also been suggested as a contributing factor. In one study, researchers found that patients discharged from hospitals in the stroke belt after suffering acute [[myocardial infarction]] were less likely to be treated with [[warfarin]] than patients in most other U.S. regions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m0BJI/is_/ai_63690758 Stroke Belt — A Standard of Care Phenomenon?], Family Practice News, June 1, 2000&lt;/ref&gt;
*Glymour et al. (2007) suggested that the higher stroke incidence in the stroke belt is related to experiences or exposures in childhood.&lt;ref name=WornChildhood/&gt;
*It has been proposed that [[poverty]] and [[malnutrition]] in previous generations, which resulted in poor maternal [[prenatal care|prenatal nutrition]] and [[low birth weight]]s, led to a predisposition to cardiovascular disease in adult life.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.obgyn.net/newsheadlines/womens_health-Stroke-20030714-32.asp Risk may be associated with mother's health] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081011205656/http://www.obgyn.net/newsheadlines/womens_health-Stroke-20030714-32.asp |date=2008-10-11 }}, Health &amp; Medicine Week, July 14, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Diet (nutrition)|Diet]]s high in [[fried foods|fried]] and high-[[fat]] foods (such as [[fried chicken]] or [[fried fish]]&lt;ref name=fish&gt;{{cite news|last=Bakalar|first=Nicholas|title=Diet: Fried Fish Is Seen as a ‘Stroke Belt’ Culprit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/01/04/health/research/04diet.html|accessdate=3 January 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=3 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;), which are prevalent in the region, are thought to contribute to higher risk.&lt;ref name=friedfat/&gt;
*The same geographical area also has a higher than national average incidence of [[lung cancer]], as it is where much of the [[tobacco]] in the United States is grown.

==Public health initiatives to reduce stroke incidence in the region==

The [[U.S. federal government]] has conducted [[public health]] programs specifically aimed at reducing stroke incidence and mortality in the stroke belt. In the 1990s the Stroke Belt Initiative operated in eleven stroke belt states, providing [[nutrition]] education, blood pressure screening, [[smoking cessation]] programs, [[weight loss]] programs, and other health promotion and public education initiatives targeted at [[Stroke#Risk factors|stroke risk factors]].&lt;ref name=Lessons/&gt;

In 2004, the Stroke Belt Elimination Initiative of the [[U.S. Department of Health and Human Services]] awarded [[grant (money)|grant]]s aimed at reducing the high incidence of stroke and high rates of stroke death and disability in the seven states with the highest rates of stroke (Alabama, Arkansas, Georgia, Mississippi, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Tennessee).&lt;ref name=SBEI&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040805.html |title=HHS Announces Initiative to Reduce the Incidence of Stroke in Stroke Belt States |type=press release |publisher=Department of Health and Human Services |date=August 5, 2004 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031175118/http://www.hhs.gov/news/press/2004pres/20040805.html |archivedate=October 31, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The term "stroke belt" is modeled after [[Belt regions of the United States|similar terms used for U.S. regions]] such as "[[snowbelt]]" and "[[Sun Belt]]",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wordspy.com/words/strokebelt.asp WordSpy website], posted on March 25, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which extend the analogy to the [[Belt (clothing)|belt as an article of clothing]].  The [[coastal plain]] counties of the Carolinas and Georgia &amp;mdash; where the stroke belt phenomenon was first described, and where stroke incidence is highest &amp;mdash; are sometimes called the "[[buckle]] of the stroke belt".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Howard G, Anderson R, Johnson NJ, Sorlie P, Russell G, Howard VJ |title=Evaluation of social status as a contributing factor to the stroke belt region of the United States |journal=Stroke |volume=28 |issue=5 |pages=936–40 |date=May 1997 |pmid=9158628 |url=http://stroke.ahajournals.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=9158628 |doi=10.1161/01.str.28.5.936}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Suicide sidebar}}
A '''suicide attempt''' is an attempt where a person tries to commit [[suicide]] but survives.&lt;ref name="Wasserman"&gt;{{cite book|author=Danuta Wasserman|title=Suicide: An unnecessary death|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0191026840|year=2016|page=63|accessdate=September 27, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qPIyCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT63}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be referred to as a '''failed suicide attempt''' or '''nonfatal suicide attempt''', but the latter terms are subject to debate among researchers.&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite book|authors=Rory C. O'Connor, Jane Pirkis|title=The International Handbook of Suicide Prevention|publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]]|isbn=1118903234|year=2016|pages=13–14|accessdate=September 27, 2017|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DzQWDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide attempts include parasuicide such as [[self-harm]] where there is no actual intention of killing oneself.

== Epidemiology ==
In the U.S., the [[National Institute of Mental Health|NIMH]] reports there are 11 nonfatal suicide attempts for every suicide death.&lt;ref&gt;Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Injury Prevention and Control. Web-based Injury Statistics Query and Reporting System (WISQARS): https://www.cdc.gov/ncipc/wisqars&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Association of Suicidology]] reports higher numbers, stating that there are 25 suicide attempts for every suicide completion.&lt;ref&gt;USA suicide 2006 Official final data: JL McIntosh for the American Association of Suicidology 2009. Many figures there taken from Reducing suicide: a national imperative, Goldsmith SK, Pellmar TC, Kleinman AM, Bunney WE, editors.&lt;/ref&gt; By these numbers, approximately 92–95% of suicide attempts end in survival.

In the [[United States]], ratio of suicide attempts to suicide death is about 25:1 in youths, compared to about 4:1 in elderly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Suicide Statistics — AFSP|url=https://afsp.org/about-suicide/suicide-statistics/|website=American Foundation for Suicide Prevention|accessdate=3 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast to suicide mortality, rates of nonfatal self harm are consistently higher among females.&lt;ref&gt;Nock et al. (2008). Suicide and suicide behavior. Epidemiologic Reviews, 30, 133–154. {{doi|10.1093/epirev/mxn002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Parasuicide and self-injury==
{{expand section|date=December 2016}}
{{main|Suicide terminology}}
Without commonly agreed-upon operational definitions, some [[suicidology]] researchers regard many suicide attempts as parasuicide or self-injurious behavior, rather than "true" suicide attempts, as in lacking suicide intent.

==Methods==
Some [[suicide method]]s have higher rates of [[lethality]] than others. The use of firearms results in death 90% of the time. Wrist-slashing has a much lower lethality rate, comparatively. 75% of all suicide attempts are by self-poisoning, a method that is often thwarted because the drug is nonlethal, or is used at a nonlethal dosage. These people survive 97% of the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.mentalhelp.net/poc/view_index.php?idx=119&amp;d=1&amp;w=5&amp;e=28649|title=Guns and Suicide|author=Schwartz, Allan N.|date=Apr 12, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Repetition ==

A nonfatal suicide attempt is the strongest known clinical predictor of eventual suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Harris  EC,  Barraclough  B:  Suicide  as an  outcome  for  mental disorders: a meta-analysis. Br J Psychiatry 1997; 170:205–228&lt;/ref&gt; Suicide risk among self-harm patients is hundreds of times higher than in the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Owens D, Horrocks J, House A: Fatal and non-fatal repetition of self-harm: systematic review. Br J Psychiatry 2002; 181:193–199&lt;/ref&gt; It is often estimated that about 10–15% of attempters eventually die by suicide.&lt;ref&gt;Suominen et al. (2004). Completed Suicide After a Suicide Attempt: A 37-Year Follow-Up Study. Am J Psychiatry, 161, 563–564.&lt;/ref&gt; The mortality risk is highest during the first months and years after the attempt: almost 1% of individuals who attempt suicide die within one year.&lt;ref&gt;Hawton K, Catalan J. Attempted suicide: a practical guide to its nature and management, 2nd ed. Oxford, Oxford University Press, 1987.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Outcomes ==
Nonfatal suicide attempts can result in serious injury. 700,000 (or more) Americans survive a suicide attempt each year. People who attempt hanging and survive or charcoal grill carbon monoxide poisoning can face permanent brain damage due to [[cerebral anoxia]]. People who take an overdose and survive can face severe organ damage (e.g., liver failure). Individuals who jump from a bridge and survive may face the rupture of multiple organs and severe damage to the spine.

While a majority sustain injuries that allow them to be released following [[emergency department]] treatment, a significant minority—about 116,000—are hospitalized, of whom 110,000 are eventually discharged alive. Their average hospital stay is 79 days. Some 89,000, (17%) of these people are permanently disabled, restricted in their ability to work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stone, Geo|title=Suicide and Attempted Suicide|publisher=Da Capo Press|isbn=0-7867-0940-5|date=September 1, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criminalization of attempted suicide ==
{{update|date=January 2014}}
{{anchor|Punishment for failed suicide attempts}}
{{main|Suicide legislation}}
Historically in the Christian church, people who attempted suicide were [[excommunication|excommunicated]] because of the religiously polarizing nature of the topic.&lt;ref name=McL2007/&gt; While previously criminally punishable, attempted suicide is no longer in most Western countries. It remains a criminal offense in most Islamic countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aggarwal|first=N|title=Rethinking suicide bombing.|journal=Crisis|year=2009|volume=30|issue=2|pages=94–7|pmid=19525169|doi=10.1027/0227-5910.30.2.94}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the late 19th century in Great Britain, attempted suicide was deemed to be equivalent to [[attempted murder]] and could be punished by hanging{{cn|date=January 2018}}. In the United States, suicide is not illegal and almost no country in Europe currently considers attempted suicide to be a crime.&lt;ref name=McL2007&gt;{{cite book|last=McLaughlin|first=Columba|title=Suicide-related behaviour understanding, caring and therapeutic responses|year=2007|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Chichester, England|isbn=978-0-470-51241-8|page=24|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=I2FJRbekdC8C&amp;pg=PA24}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases of completed suicide, the person’s property can be seized by the government and bills for treatment of the corpse can be sent to the person’s survivors or living family members.

In [[Penal Code (Singapore)|Singapore]], a person who attempts to commit suicide can be imprisoned for up to one year.&lt;ref&gt;Singapore Penal Code(Cap 224, Rev Ed 2008), s 309&lt;/ref&gt;

In India, attempted suicide was an offense punishable under the following Section 309 of the [[Indian Penal Code]] until December 2014, when it was repealed:&lt;ref&gt;http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/india/Government-decriminalizes-attempt-to-commit-suicide-removes-section-309/articleshow/45452253.cms&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://zeenews.india.com/news/india/govt-decides-to-repeal-section-309-from-ipc-attempt-to-suicide-no-longer-a-crime_1512479.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|Attempt to commit suicide.—Whoever attempts to commit suicide and does any act towards the commission of such offence, shall be punished with simple imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year or with fine, or with both.&lt;ref&gt;http://lawcommissionofindia.nic.in/reports/report210.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;{{update after|2014|1|14}}}}

'''Superhuman''' qualities are qualities that exceed those found in [[human]]s. 

The ''[[Übermensch]]'' or "Superman" was postulated by [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] as a type of supreme, ultra-[[aristocracy|aristocratic]] achievement which becomes possible in the transcendence of modernity, morals or nihilism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Nietzsche |first1=Friedrich |authorlink1=Friedrich Nietzsche |title=Ecce Homo: How One Becomes What One Is &amp; The Antichrist: A Curse on Christianity. |date=2007 |publisher=Algora Publishing |location=New York |isbn=9780875862835 |page=41 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xx6IfcqRvbwC&amp;pg=PA41#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |language=en |chapter=Why I Write Such Good Books |quote=The word "Superman" as the designation for a type of the highest successfulness as opposed to "modern" men, to "good" men, to Christians and other nihilists.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[transhumanism]] and [[futurology]], superhuman abilities are the technological aim either of [[human enhancement]] by [[Genetic engineering|genetic modification]] or [[Cyberware|cybernetic implants]] or of future [[Superintelligence|superhuman artificial intelligence]].

Speculation about human nature and the possibilities of both [[human enhancement]] and future [[human evolution]] have made superhumans a popular subject of [[science fiction]].

Superhuman abilities are also associated with the genre of [[superhero]]es. 

==Human enhancement and advancement==
{{Further|Human enhancement|Transhumanism|Posthuman}}
Human enhancement is an attempt to temporarily or permanently overcome the current limitations of the [[human body]] through natural or artificial means. Human enhancement may be through the use of technological means to select or alter human characteristics and capacities, whether or not the alteration results in characteristics and capacities that lie beyond the existing human range.

Some [[bioethicist]]s restrict the term to the non-therapeutic application of [[Human enhancement#Technologies|specific technologies]] — [[Neurotechnology|neuro-]], [[cyberware|cyber-]], [[gene therapy|gene-]] and [[nanomedicine|nano-technologies]] — to [[human biology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hughes |first1=James |authorlink1=James Hughes (sociologist) |title=Human Enhancement on the Agenda |journal=[[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]] |date=October 2004 |url=https://ieet.org/index.php/IEET2/more/hughes20041101 |accessdate=July 4, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moore |first1=Pete |authorlink1=Pete Moore (science writer) |title=Enhancing Me: The Hope and the Hype of Human Enhancement |date=2008 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location=[[Chichester]] |isbn=047069999X}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=July 2018}}

According to transhumanist thinkers, a [[posthuman]] is a hypothetical [[future]] being "''whose basic capacities so radically exceed those of present humans as to be no longer unambiguously [[human]] by our current standards.''"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author1=[[Nick Bostrom]] |title=The Transhumanist FAQ |url=http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/FAQv21.pdf |website=Humanity+ |accessdate=August 27, 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061231225013/http://www.transhumanism.org/resources/FAQv21.pdf |archivedate=December 31, 2006 |date=October 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''USS ''Herring'' (SS-233)''', a [[Gato class submarine|''Gato''-class submarine]], was the only ship of the [[United States Navy]] to be named for the [[herring]].

Her [[Keel laying|keel was laid down]] 14 July 1941 by the [[Portsmouth Naval Shipyard]] in [[Kittery, Maine]]. She was [[ship naming and launching|launched]] on 15 January 1942 (sponsored by Mrs. Emilie Spear (née Piollet), wife of Rear Admiral [[Ray Spear]], Chief of the [[Bureau of Supplies and Accounts]]), and [[ship commissioning|commissioned]] on 4 May 1942 with [[Lieutenant Commander (United States)|Lieutenant Commander]] [[Raymond W. Johnson]] ([[United States Naval Academy|Class]] of 1930) in command.

After shakedown, the new submarine was one of five sent to the [[Mediterranean Sea]] to take station off the [[North Africa]]n coast prior to [[Operation Torch]], the invasion of North Africa. Reaching her position off [[Casablanca]] on 5 November 1942, ''Herring'' remained there, spotting but not attacking several targets. On the morning of 8 November as the invasion was launched, the patient sub had her chance, sinking the 5,700&amp;nbsp;ton cargo ship ''Ville du Havre''. ''Herring'' returned to [[Rosneath]], [[Scotland]], on 25 November and departed for her second war patrol 16 December, but targets were scarce. The fourth war patrol, an antisubmarine sweep in [[Iceland]]ic waters, and fifth patrol, which took her back to the [[United States]] on 26 July 1943, netted ''Herring'' no more kills.

''Herring'' departed [[New London, Connecticut]], for the rich hunting grounds of the Pacific on 9 August 1943. After intensive training at [[Pearl Harbor]], she sailed 15 November 1943 on her sixth war patrol to join the ranks of the American submarines systematically decimating Japanese shipping and destroying the Japanese economy. She scored two kills, the 3,948&amp;nbsp;ton ''Hakozaki Maru'' on 14 December, and the 6,072&amp;nbsp;ton ''Nagoya Maru'' to celebrate [[New Year's Day]] 1944. ''Herring’''s next patrol was a frustrating one as on 24 March 1944 she stalked a large [[aircraft carrier]] but was detected and driven deep before she could attack.

Lieutenant Commander Johnson commanded Herring for five of her first six patrols, with the sole exception being March 1943 when John Corbus was in command. On her seventh and eight patrols she was captained by Lieutenant Commander David Zabriskie, Jr.

''Herring’''s eighth war patrol was to be both her most successful and her last. Topping off at [[Midway Island]] on 21 May 1944, ''Herring'' headed for the [[Kurile Islands]] patrol area. Ten days later she rendezvoused with {{USS|Barb|SS-220|3}}. ''Herring'' was never heard from or seen again. However, Japanese records prove that she sank two ships, ''Ishigaki'' and ''Hokuyo Maru'', on the night of 30 – 31 May. ''Ishigaki'' had been responsible for the sinking of {{USS|S-44|SS-155}} on 7 October 1943. ''Herring'''s exact manner of loss can also be determined from these records. Two more merchant ships, ''Hiburi Maru'' and ''Iwaki Maru'', were sunk while at anchor in [[Matsuwa Island]] on the morning of 1 June 1944. In a counter-attack, enemy shore batteries scored two direct hits on the submarine's conning tower and "bubbles covered an area about 5&amp;nbsp;meters wide, and heavy oil covered an area of approximately 15&amp;nbsp;miles." On her last patrol, ''Herring'' had sunk four Japanese ships for a total of 13,202&amp;nbsp;tons. In all she had sunk six ''maru''s totaling 19,959&amp;nbsp;tons, and a [[Vichy France|Vichy]] cargo ship.

''Herring'' received five [[battle star]]s for her service in [[World War II]].

==Legacy==
There is a memorial plaque at the [[Naval Weapons Station Seal Beach|Naval Weapons Station]] in [[Seal Beach, California]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waymarking.com/waymarks/WM6DKY_USS_Herring_SS_233_Seal_Beach_CA|title=USS Herring (SS 233) - Seal Beach, CA - World War II Memorials / Monuments on Waymarking.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and another one, along with the ship's bell, at [[Battleship Memorial Park]] in [[Mobile, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite sign|url=http://www.hmdb.org/marker.asp?marker=74810|title=Memorial to USS Herring (SS-233)|date=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2005, near the site of the sinking was established a memorial sign to the crew of the lost boats, which fought against the Japanese during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kurilstour.ru/english/|title=Tours in Kuril islands.

In 2016 the wreck of ''Herring'' was located near [[Matua (island)|Matua Island]] by a joint expedition of the [[Russian Geographical Society]] and [[Russian Defense Ministry]]. Aleksandr Kirillin, secretary of the academic board of Russia’s Military Historical Society, said that "Russian divers in cooperation with the Pacific Fleet sailors discovered the submarine at a depth of {{convert|104|m|disp=sqbr|sp=us}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rt.com/news/347834-us-submarine-found-wwii/|title=US submarine sunk by Japan in WWII found by Russian expedition|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walburga Ehrengarde Helena, Lady Paget''' (''née'' '''Countess von Hohenthal''';&lt;ref&gt;Packard, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; 1839–1929) was a diarist, writer and an intimate friend of [[Queen Victoria]].

==Biography==
{{unsourced|section|date=March 2016}}
Walburga Ehrengarde Helena, Countess von Hohenthal, was born in 1839 in [[Berlin]], [[Germany]]. She was the daughter of Charles Frederic Anthony, Count von Hohenthal. Before her marriage she was a [[lady-in-waiting]] to [[Victoria, Princess Royal]], who had married [[Frederick III, German Emperor|Prince Frederick William of Prussia]] in 1858.

In 1860, she married Sir [[Augustus Berkeley Paget]] (1823–1896), British [[ambassador]] in [[Copenhagen]], and later British Ambassador in  [[Vienna]], Portugal, Florence and [[Rome]]. After her husband's posting to Copenhagen, Lady Paget helped Queen Victoria to arrange the marriage of the Prince of Wales, afterwards [[Edward VII]], to Princess [[Alexandra of Denmark]]. The Pagets had three children:

* Victor Frederick William Augustus Paget (1861–1927), a [[Lieutenant Colonel]] 
* Alberta Victoria Sarah Caroline Paget (1863–1944), married [[Robert George Windsor-Clive, 1st Earl of Plymouth]], [[Order of the British Empire|GBE]], [[Order of the Bath|CB]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]] (1857–1923)
* [[Ralph Paget]] (1864–1940, later became ''Sir Ralph Paget'', [[Order of Saint Michael and Saint George|KCMG]], [[Royal Victorian Order|CVO]], [[Her Majesty's Most Honourable Privy Council|PC]])

[[File:Tardebigge Worcs cemetery Paget.jpg|thumb|Paget family plot in the cemetery of St Bartholomew's church, [[Tardebigge]], Worcestershire, with the graves of Sir [[Augustus Berkeley Paget]], GCB (1823 – 1896) and his wife Walburga Ehrengarde Helena (née Countess von Hohenthal, 1839 – 1929)]]
In 1867, her husband was posted to Florence, then the capital of the newly formed Italy. In 1870, when Rome became the capital, she arranged for the British embassy to be established at the Villa Torlonia. In 1884 she and her husband had to move to Vienna. In 1887, Lady Paget rented the Villa Caprini in [[Fiesole]], Florence; and in 1893, when her husband retired to Britain, she bought the Torre di Bellosguardo south of the city. When her husband died in 1897 she kept Bellosguardo as her main residence, devoting her time to campaigning – with [[Vernon Lee]], [[Augustus Hare]] and others – against the destruction of parts of old Florence by the Municipality, and developing her house and gardens. Queen Victoria visited her in 1893.

In 1913, amid rumors of war, Lady Paget returned to Britain. Bellosguardo was bought by an Austrian, baroness Marion von Hornstein. In 1929, at the age of ninety, she died of burns after falling asleep by the fire at Unlawater House, [[Newnham on Severn]] and was buried next to her husband at [[Tardebigge]], Worcestershire.

==Her views==
Lady Paget in her book ''Colloquies with an unseen friend'' (1907) was an early writer to mention the [[hollow earth]] theory; she claimed that cities exist beneath a desert, which is where the descendants of [[Atlantis]] moved to. She further claimed that an entrance will be discovered to this subterranean kingdom in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Paget Walburga, Colloquies with an unseen friend, William Rider &amp; Son., London., 1909, p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

Lady Paget was also a [[vegetarian]], and she explained her reasons as follows: &lt;blockquote&gt;I strongly condemn the practice, and do not eat flesh-food myself. Two or three years ago I had occasion to read up certain papers about the transport of cattle and [[Slaughterhouse|slaughter-houses]], and as I read the irresistible conviction came upon me that I must choose between giving up the eating of animal food and my peace of mind. These considerations were not the only ones that moved me. I do not think that anyone has a right to indulge in tastes which oblige others to follow a brutalizing and degrading occupation. When you call a man a butcher, it signifies that he is fond of bloodshed. Butchers often become murderers, and I have known cases where butchers have actually been hired to murder persons whom they did not even know...
