      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2145">'''Abu Hashim al-Hasan''' (died 1040) was an [[imam]] of the [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] state in [[Yemen]] who ruled part of the Yemeni highland in 1031-1040.

Abu Hashim al-Hasan was a fifth-generation descendant of al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860), the theological portal figure of [[Zaydiyyah]] [[Islam]].&lt;ref&gt;The filiation was: al-Qasim ar-Rassi - al-Husayn - Abdallah - Yahya - Abd ar-Rahman - Abu Hashim al-Hasan.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1031, the year after the violent death of the former imam [[al-Mu’id li-Din Illah]], he claimed the imamate.&lt;ref&gt;The beginning of his imamate is sometimes dated in 1027 or 1035.&lt;/ref&gt; He was able to seize [[San'a]]. One of the local grandees, Ibn Abi Hashid, fled, while another one, Nunsur bin Abi'l-Futuh, submitted. Abu Hashim's authority in San'a lasted until 1037, when he was expelled by the tribesmen of [[Hamdan]]. The Hamdanites later invited Ja'far, brother of the old imam [[al-Mahdi al-Husayn]], to rule the city as [[emir]]. The following years were filled with contests over San'a, and Abu Hashim was able to regain control over the commercially important place for a brief term. After he had lost the city for good, he withdrew to [[Sa'dah]] in the north, which was the old stronghold of the [[Zaydiyyah]].&lt;ref&gt;Cesare Ansaldi, ''Il Yemen nella storia e nella leggenda''. Roma 1933, p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; The hard pressed Abu Hashim died in 1040. A new pretender, [[Abu'l-Fath an-Nasir ad-Dailami]], arrived from [[Persia]], possibly before Abu Hashim's death.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Kay, ''Yaman; Its Early Medieval History''. London 1892, p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Having proclaimed his [[da'wa]] (call for the imamate), he proceeded to seize [[Sa'dah]] and San'a some years later, in 1046.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2102">'''Abū Jaʿfar Aḥmad ibn ʿAbd al-Malik Ibn Saʿīd''' (died 1163) is best known as a poet, and lover of [[Hafsa Bint al-Hajj al-Rukuniyya|Ḥafṣa bint al-Ḥājj ar-Rakūniyya]] (c. 1135-1191).

==Biography==
Abū Jaʿfar is said to have been taught by, amongst others, the twelfth-century poet [[Ibn Khafaja|Ibn Khafāja]]. He served as a prominent court secretary for the Almohad governor of [[Granada]], Abū Saʿid ʿUthmān. "Unfortunately for Abū Jaʿfar, his powerful boss also fell in love with Ḥafṣa, and our poet's position in the ensuing love triangle seems to have forced him to flee Granada." Joining Ibn Mardanīsh's rebellion against al-Muwaḥḥid rule in al-Andalus, Abū Jaʿfar was captured and in 1163 executed.&lt;ref&gt;Ross Brann, 'He Said, She Said: Reinscribing the Andalusi Arabic Love Lyric', in ''Studies in Arabic and Hebrew Letters: In Honor of Raymond P. Scheindlin'', ed. by Jonathan P. Decter and Michael Chaim Rand (Piscataway, NJ: Gorgias Press LLC, 2007), pp. 7-16 (at p. 8).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
An example of Abū Jaʿfar's poetry, as translated by [[Arthur John Arberry|A. J. Arberry]], is 'Wine, my Love':&lt;ref&gt;''Moorish Poetry: A Translation of ’The Pennants’, an Anthology Compiled in 1243 by the Andalusian Ibn Saʿid'', trans. by A. J. Arberry (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1953), p. 100. For the original see ''El libro de las banderas de los campeones, de Ibn Saʿid al-Magribī'', ed. by Emilio García Gómez (Madrid: Instituto de Valencia de Don Juan, 1942).&lt;/ref&gt;

:: Ho, bring her hither, happy boy,
:: For in her presence is my joy,
:: But (and does love need further proof?)
:: I grieve when she remains aloof.

:: I speak upon the wine: when she
:: Departs, the bowl weeps bitterly,
:: But when the glass beholds her near
:: It broadly smiles for the good cheer.

{{Map of legality surrounding assisted suicide in the US|align=right|size=400px}} 
[[Assisted suicide]] is defined as [[suicide]] committed with the aid of another person, sometimes a doctor. “Assisted suicide" has been used to describe what proponents refer to as  [[medical aid in dying]] in the United States for terminally ill adults who self-administer [[barbiturates]] if they feel that they are suffering significantly. The term is often used interchangeably with physician-assisted suicide (PAS), "physician-assisted dying", "physician-assisted death", "assisted death" and "aid in dying". 

Assisted suicide is similar to but distinct from euthanasia (sometimes called "mercy killing"). In cases of euthanasia another party acts to bring about the person's death in order to end ongoing suffering. In cases of assisted suicide a second person provides the means through which the individual is able to voluntarily end their own life, but they do not directly cause the individual's death.

Physician-assisted death or "aid in dying" is legal in eight jurisdictions: California, Colorado, District of Columbia, Hawaii, Montana, Oregon, Vermont, and Washington.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2017/feb/18/dc-physician-assisted-suicide-law-goes-effect/|title=D.C. physician-assisted suicide law goes into effect|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These laws (excluding Montana since there is no law) expressly state that, "actions taken in accordance with [the Act] shall not, for any purpose, constitute suicide, assisted suicide, mercy killing or homicide, under the law". This distinguishes the legal act of “medical aid in dying” from the act of suicide.

== History ==

===Early movements===

The first significant drive to legalize assisted suicide in the United States arose in the early years of the twentieth century. In a 2004 article in the ''[[Bulletin of the History of Medicine]]'', [[Brown University]] historian [[Jacob M. Appel]] documented extensive political debate over legislation to legalize physician-assisted death in both Iowa and Ohio in 1906. In Ohio, the legislation was inspired by the campaign of heiress [[Anna S. Hall]], whose mother had died a painful death from [[cancer]].&lt;ref name=Appel2004&gt;{{Cite journal

===''Glucksberg v. Washington''===
Dr. Harold Glucksberg, along with four other physicians, three terminally ill patients, and Compassion and Dying, brought a case against the state of Washington for banning assisted suicide. The case was filed in District Court in 1994.

Following a series of appeals, the U.S. Supreme Court decided in 1997 in a unanimous decision to uphold Washington's ban. They cited the Due Process Clause and argued that assisted suicide isn't guaranteed as a fundamental liberty protected by due process. The case allowed individual states to decide independently on the medical aid-in-dying issue. It set the stage for legislative efforts on the state level.

===Dr. Kevorkian===
{{main|Jack Kevorkian}}
Assisted suicide in the United States was brought to public attention in the 1990s with the highly publicized case of Dr. Jack Kevorkian.  Dr. Kevorkian assisted over 40 people in committing suicide in Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | year = 1997 | pmid = 8970940 | doi = 10.1056/NEJM199701023360108| url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199701023360108 | pages = 50–53 | issue = 1 | first1 = M. | title = The Supreme Court and Physician-Assisted Suicide — the Ultimate Right | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 336 | last1 = Angell}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His first public assisted suicide was in 1990, of Janet Adkins, a 54-year-old woman diagnosed with early-onset Alzheimer's disease in 1989.  He was charged with [[murder]], but charges were dropped on December 13, 1990 because there were no Michigan laws outlawing suicide or the medical assistance of it so he was not in violation of a law.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ascensionhealth.org/ethics/public/cases/case19.asp "People v. Kevorkian; Hobbins v. Attorney General"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030908034403/http://www.ascensionhealth.org/ethics/public/cases/case19.asp |date=2003-09-08 }}. Ascension Health. 2007. Ascension Health. 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Kevorkian crossed the line from assisting the patient to actively killing the patient himself.  Kevorkian videotaped himself giving a man a lethal injection and aired the tape on ''[[60 Minutes]]''.  He was found guilty of second-degree murder and served eight years of a 10–25 year sentence.  He was released in 2007, and died on June 3, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2007/US/law/12/17/court.archive.kevorkian8/index.html "Kevorkian Case: Kevorkian sentenced to 10 to 25 years"]. [[CNN]] 31 Dec 2007 1. 7 April 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brittany Maynard===
{{main|Brittany Maynard}}
In 2014, the death of Brittany Maynard,  an advocate for the legalization of [[aid in dying]], from [[brain cancer]] led to renewed debate in the United States over assisted suicide, and was cited as being responsible for bills in several states on the topic. Her home state of California, which she left to reside in Oregon to access its Death With Dignity Act, became the fifth state to authorize aid in dying, in 2015.

==Jurisdictions where assisted suicide is authorized==

===California===
{{main|California End of Life Option Act}}
In 1992, the group Californians against Human Suffering proposed Proposition 161 to allow patients with less than six months to live the right to receive assistance from physicians in dying.  This proposition offered more safeguards against abuse by physicians than Washington's Initiative 119, such as special protections for patients in [[nursing]] facilities.  This measure failed to pass with 46 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name="Death by Prescription"&gt;{{Cite journal| year = 1994| pmid = 7935680| doi = 10.1056/NEJM199411033311822| url = http://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJM199411033311822| pages = 1240–1243| issue = 18 | first1 = G.| title = Death by Prescription. The Oregon Initiative| journal = The New England Journal of Medicine| volume = 331| last1 = Annas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequent efforts were tried to pass assisted death legalization through the California State Legislature in 1999, 2005, and 2006, all of which failed. The California legislature passed the [[California End of Life Option Act]], a bill legalizing the practice in September 2015, and the bill was signed into law by [[Governor of California|Governor]] [[Jerry Brown]] on October 5, 2015, making California the fifth state to authorize [[medical aid in dying]] and the second to do so through the legislature. The Act began implementation on June 9, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/local/political/la-me-pc-gov-brown-end-of-life-bill-20151005-story.html|title=After struggling, Jerry Brown makes assisted suicide legal in California|first=Patrick|last=McGreevy|date=5 October 2015|publisher=|via=LA Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fox5sandiego.com/2015/10/05/gov-brown-signs-bill-legalizing-medically-assisted-suicide-for-terminal-patients/|title=Gov.

===Colorado===
Representatives [[Lois Court]] and [[Joann Ginal]] introduced assisted suicide legislation in 2015 in the Colorado House.  The bill was voted down in committee 8-5.

In April 2016, Julie Selsberg and Jaren Ducker filed an initiative with the secretary of state seeking to authorize medical aid in dying in November 2016 through the ballot process.

On November 8, 2016 Colorado voters passed Proposition 106 making assisted death legal among patients with terminal illness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denverpost.com/2016/11/08/colorado-aid-in-dying-proposition-106-election-results/|title=Colorado passes medical aid in dying, joining five other states|date=8 November 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===District of Columbia===
In January 2015, [[Council of the District of Columbia|D.C. Council]] member [[Mary Cheh|Mary M. Cheh]] introduced the Death with Dignity Act of 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/dc-politics/death-with-dignity-laws-are-proposed-bringing-national-debate-to-dc-and-md/2015/01/16/8354bba8-9d09-11e4-a7ee-526210d665b4_story.html|title='Death With Dignity' laws are proposed, bringing national debate to D.C. and Md.|last=DeBonis|first=Mike|date=16 January 2015|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=16 Jan 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 5, 2016, the D.C. Committee on Health and Human Services voted 3-2 for the Death with Dignity Act.  On November 1, 2016 the D.C. Council voted 11–2 to advance the Death with Dignity Act. It then went through another vote in the council and the Mayor's office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/oct/5/dc-weighs-physician-assisted-suicide-as-death-with/|title='Death With Dignity Act' clears first hurdle as D.C. weighs physician-assisted suicide|last=Richardson|first=Bradford|date=5 October 2016|newspaper=[[The Washington Times]]|access-date=8 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muriel Bowser|Mayor Bowser]]'s signed the bill on 23rd December, 2016. After the-30 day U.S. Congress review mandated by the federal Home Rule Act, and following the inability of Congressional Republicans to block the bill, the law went into effect on February 18, 2017, with D.C. becoming the seventh jurisdiction in the U.S. to legalize this.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

=== Hawaii ===
Starting January 1, 2019 [[Hawaii]] will legally allow assisted dying, based on the Oregon and Washington state models. Governor David Ige signed a medical aid-in-dying law on April 5, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/91a066e44af64b538eaa7472bf6a9cb2/Medically-assisted-suicide-becomes-legal-in-Hawaii|title=Medically assisted suicide becomes legal in Hawaii|date=5 April 2018|website=apnews.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407074751/https://www.apnews.com/91a066e44af64b538eaa7472bf6a9cb2/Medically-assisted-suicide-becomes-legal-in-Hawaii|archive-date=7 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law has safeguards to protect against abuse, including two health care providers being required to confirm a patient’s diagnosis, prognosis, his or her ability to make decisions, and that the patient's request is voluntary; as well as a counselor being required to determine that the patient isn’t suffering from conditions that may interfere with decision-making, such as a lack of treatment of depression. The law requires that the patient must make two oral requests for the life-ending medication, with a 20-day waiting period in between, and sign a written request witnessed by two people, one of whom cannot be a relative. Criminal penalties applies to anyone attempting to coerce people into obtaining life-ending medication or tampering with said patient's request.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.apnews.com/91a066e44af64b538eaa7472bf6a9cb2/Medically-assisted-suicide-becomes-legal-in-Hawaii|title=Medically assisted suicide becomes legal in Hawaii|date=5 April 2018|website=apnews.com|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407074751/https://www.apnews.com/91a066e44af64b538eaa7472bf6a9cb2/Medically-assisted-suicide-becomes-legal-in-Hawaii|archive-date=7 April 2018|dead-url=no|access-date=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Montana ===
[[Medical aid in dying|Aid in dying]] is legal in Montana through a state supreme court decision. In ''[[Baxter v. Montana]]'' (2009) the [[Montana Supreme Court]] ruled in a 5-2 decision that state law allows for terminally ill Montanans to request lethal medication from a physician under existing statutes, in 2008. The Attorney General of the state of Montana sought an appeal from the Montana Supreme Court, but the court, by a decision of five to two, affirmed the lower court's ruling on the state law.  The Court did, however, limit the scope of the decision by not determining if the state's constitution protected the right.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/dec/31/montana-high-court-state-allows-assisted-suicide/ |title=Mont. court: State law doesn't prevent assisted suicide |publisher=''[[The Spokesman-Review]]'' |date=2009-12-31 |accessdate=2009-12-31| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100103092317/http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2009/dec/31/montana-high-court-state-allows-assisted-suicide/| archivedate= 3 January 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Oregon===
{{main|Oregon Ballot Measure 16 (1994)}}
Oregon voters first approved the [[Oregon Ballot Measure 16 (1994)|Death with Dignity Act]] (DWDA) by general election in November 1994 by a margin of 51% to 49%. Ballot Measure 16, a citizen initiative sponsored by Oregon Right to Die Political Action Committee,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/googleScholar.qst?docId=5002204824 "Oregon's Fight over the Right to Die"]. Courtney S. Campbell; The Hastings Center Report, Vol. 24, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; asked if terminally ill patients with less than 6 months to live should be able to receive a [[Medical prescription|prescription]] for lethal drugs and included many provisions to protect against misuse, such as two oral requests and a written request from the patient.  The patient must also be referred to [[counseling]] if a mental illness is suspected. 

The law went into effect in October 1997 after an injunction delayed implementation. In November 1997, Measure 51 was placed on the general election ballot to repeal the Act. Voters chose to retain the Act by a margin of 60% to 40%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.oregon.gov/oha/ph/ProviderPartnerResources/EvaluationResearch/DeathwithDignityAct/Pages/index.aspx | title=Death with Dignity Act}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the law has been in effect, it has given Oregon residents and patients a full range of options when dealing with their illness. This law has allowed for patients to consult their doctors about this option (about 1 in 50), while then at least 1 in 6 patients go on to talk to their families about the matter (Quill &amp; Sussman, n.d.) URL:https://www.thehastingscenter.org/briefingbook/physician-assisted-death/. The law gives patients a full range of options when ultimately deciding the best route to help make their lives comfortable when coping with this illness.

====Challenges====

=====''Lee v. State of Oregon''=====
In December 1994, doctors and patients argued that the DWDA violated the U.S. Constitution's first and fourteenth amendments in ''Lee v. Oregon''. U.S. District Court Judge Michael Hogan placed a temporary injunction, that he later made permanent, on the Act.

In February 1997, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled to dismiss the challenge to the Death with Dignity Act.

=====Measure 51, Oregon Repeal of Death with Dignity =====
In 1997, Measure 51 was placed on the November ballot. It failed and 60% of Oregon voters, more than the original 1994 vote, expressed their support for the Death with Dignity Act.

=====''Oregon v. Ashcroft''=====
U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft  issued a directive in 2001 to prevent the Oregon Death With Dignity Act from being implemented. The state of Oregon successfully sued and proceeded with implementation.&lt;ref&gt;https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=1750729 3978677110948&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6&amp;as_vis=1&amp;oi=scholarr 11Oregon v.s Ashcoft, 368 F.3d 1118 (2004) https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=6864220915455 147792&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=6,38&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vermont===
In May 2013, the [[Vermont Legislature]] passed the Patient Choice and Control at End of Life Act. Governor [[Peter Shumlin]] signed it into law. The law is based on, but is less restrictive than, the Oregon model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2013/05/14/vermont-physician-assisted-death-bill/2157333/ |title=Vermont end-of-life bill heads to governor |first=Terri |last=Hallenbeck |location=[[Burlington, Vermont]] |newspaper=USA Today |date=May 14, 2013 |accessdate=May 14, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vermont was the first state to pass an aid in dying law through the legislative process. In January 2013 the act was introduced to the Senate, and in May 2013 it was passed by both the house and senate. 

Vermont residents 18 years old or older who are mentally capable adults with a terminal illness and a prognosis of 6 months or less to live can make an oral request and obtain medication from a physician. The bill requires a second opinion, written and oral requests, and other provisions. &lt;ref name=bfp130714&gt;{{Cite news | first=Terri | last=Hallenbeck | title=Vermont adjusts to new way of dying | url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation/2013/07/14/vermont-adjusts-to-new-way-of-dying/2514847/| work= | newspaper=[[The Burlington Free Press]] | location=[[Burlington, Vermont]] | pages= 6B-9B | date=July 14, 2013 | id= | accessdate=July 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!---hard and soft copy sources differ. They are identical articles---&gt;

===Washington===
In 1991, a ballot question asked if terminally ill adults should be allowed to receive physician aid-in-dying. The initiative failed, receiving 46 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name="Death by Prescription" /&gt;

Washington voters approved the [[Washington Death with Dignity Act|Death with Dignity Act]] by general election in November 2008 by a margin of 58% to 42%
"This measure would permit terminally ill, competent, adult Washington residents medically predicted to die within six months to request and self-administer lethal medication prescribed by a physician. The measure requires two oral and one written request, two physicians to diagnose the patient and determine the patient is competent, a waiting period, and physician verification of an informed patient decision. Physicians, patients and others acting in good faith compliance would have criminal and civil immunity."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.secstate.wa.gov/elections/initiatives/text/i1000.pdf The Washington Death with Dignity Act]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other jurisdictions==

===Alaska===
In 1999, two terminally ill patients, Kevin Sampson and Jane Doe, sued for an order to exempt their physicians from being charged with manslaughter for assisting them in dying.  The superior court ruled against them, and they appealed to the Alaska Supreme Court.  This court upheld the previous ruling with the reasoning that the Alaska Constitution's right to privacy and liberty does not allow terminally ill patients to be assisted by physicians in dying.&lt;ref name=marker/&gt;

===Arizona===
In Arizona, the city of [[Bisbee, Arizona|Bisbee]] became the first municipality in the state to approve an aid in dying resolution, although the vote is not legally binding.

The resolution states that the city of Bisbee:
* Respects the diversity of perspectives of its citizens,
* Supports equal protection within the diversity of perspectives on end-of-life decisions,
* Recognizes the practice of Aid in Dying as a legitimate individual liberty, 
* And, while not a legally enforceable document, urges prosecutorial discretion by the Cochise County Attorney in de-prioritizing cases involving prosecution of a person who has supported, been present, or facilitated a loved one to advance the time of his or her imminent death when facing intolerable suffering.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tucsonweekly.com/TheRange/archives/2015/09/02/bisbee-becomes-first-city-in-arizona-to-approve-an-aid-in-dying-resolution|title=Bisbee Becomes First City in Arizona to Approve an 'Aid in Dying' Resolution|first=María Inés|last=Taracena|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Connecticut===
Legislation to legalize assisted suicide received a public hearing by Connecticut's state legislature for three consecutive sessions in 2013, 2014, and 2015, but has failed to receive a committee vote. State representative Jonathan Steinberg introduced HB 6024, An Act Concerning Aid in Dying for Terminally Ill Patients, on January 19, 2017, with Representative Josh Elliott (D-88th District) co-sponsoring. The bill was referred to the Joint Committee on Public Health.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=9 April 2015|title=Aid-in-dying bill hasn't gained sufficient support|url=http://www.ctpost.com/local/article/For-3rd-time-aid-in-dying-bill-lacked-support-6190026.php|newspaper=[[Connecticut Post]]|access-date=2 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cga.ct.gov/asp/cgabillstatus/cgabillstatus.asp?selBillType=Bill&amp;bill_num=HB06024&amp;which_year=2017|title=Connecticut General Assembly|website=Connecticut General Assembly}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===
''Krischer v. McIver'' was a case brought to the Florida Supreme Court in 1997 by the Florida chapter of the Hemlock Society in an attempt to overturn the state's anti-assisted suicide law.  The question was if AIDS patient Charles Hall had this right, and the case was appealed to the Florida Supreme Court.  This court upheld the constitutionality of Florida's law against assisted suicide.&lt;ref name=marker&gt;Marker, Rita L. (2009).

In early 2015 Maryland lawmakers began debating a "Death With Dignity" bill, though governor [[Larry Hogan]] had suggested he would oppose it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Wiggins|first=Ovetta|date=6 March 2015|title=Maryland weighs 'Death With Dignity' legislation|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/local/md-politics/maryland-weighs-death-with-dignity-legislation/2015/03/06/187fa3b6-c3a0-11e4-9ec2-b418f57a4a99_story.html|newspaper=[[Washington Post]]|access-date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Massachusetts===
[[File:Physician-assisted suicide (Question 2) Massachusetts 2012 ballot measure voting results by municipality.svg|thumb|300px|Voting results for the 2012 [[Massachusetts Death with Dignity Initiative]]]]
The [[Massachusetts Death with Dignity Initiative]], a ballot measure to legalize aid in dying, was narrowly defeated in the [[Massachusetts general election, 2012|2012 general election]], with 51% of voters against the proposal.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

A poll taken by the Boston Globe and the University of New Hampshire between September 21 and September 27, 2012, found Massachusetts residents supporting Question 2 68%, with 20% opposed.  Another public poll by the University of Massachusetts and YouGov American found similar results as late as October 8 with 65% in support and 19% opposed.{{citation needed|date=June 2014}}

===New Jersey===
A [[New Jersey]] Assembly committee voted in favor of assisted suicide legislation, and the full state Assembly plans to vote on Assemblyman John Burzichelli's bill, known as A 2270, the New Jersey Death with Dignity Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2014/Bills/A2500/2270_I1.HTM|title=A2270|website=www.njleg.state.nj.us}}&lt;/ref&gt; on November 13, 2014, although the bill failed to receive a vote in the Senate. The bill would have required patients suffering from a terminal disease to first verbally request a prescription from their attending physician, followed by a second verbal request at least 15 days later and one request in writing signed by two witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.app.com/story/news/politics/capitolquickies/2014/06/05/assisted-suicide-bill-advances-in-new-jersey-assembly/10020099/|title=Assisted suicide bill advances in New Jersey Assembly|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the attending physician would have to offer the patient a chance to rescind their request. Governor [[Chris Christie]], at the time the bill was going through a legislative review and voting, vowed to veto any bills related to allowing assisted suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Malo|first1=Sebastien|title=New Jersey state Assembly approves assisted suicide bill|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2014/11/14/us-usa-newjersey-assistedsuicide-idUSKCN0IY01Z20141114|accessdate=13 November 2014|publisher=[[Reuters]]|date=13 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Ford|first=Andrew|date=4 March 2015|title=N.J. conflicted on aid in dying|url=http://www.courierpostonline.com/story/news/local/new-jersey/2015/03/03/new-jersey-fighting-die-christie-mum/24330561/|newspaper=[[Courier-Post]]|access-date=1 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nj.com/politics/index.ssf/2016/10/aid_in_dying_legislation_for_terminally_ill_assemb.html]&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, the State Senator, Nicolas Scutar, has recently introduced the Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.njleg.state.nj.us/2018/Bills/S1500/1072_I1.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; It is unknown if Governor [[Phil Murphy]] plans to support or veto any bills that may allow assisted suicides in New Jersey.

===New Mexico===
A New Mexico court legalized the practice in Bernalillo County in January 2014; this decision was overturned on August 11, 2015, which upheld the state's ban on assisted suicide.&lt;ref name="NM"&gt;{{cite news |date=11 August 2015|title=New Mexico Court of Appeals strikes down ruling that essentially allowed assisted suicides\url=http://www.lcsun-news.com/las_cruces-news/ci_28623731/new-mexico-court-appeals-strikes-down-right-die|newspaper=Las Cruces Sun-News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New York===
In 1994, a suit was filed in New York claiming that the anti-assisted suicide statute was a violation of equal protection and liberty guarantees of the Fourteenth Amendment.  This claim was rejected by the District Court on the basis that there is no right to assisted suicide given by the U.S. Constitution.  In 1996, the [[U.S. Court of Appeals]] overturned this ruling with the reasoning that the criminalization of assisted suicide violates the Equal Protection Clause.  However, the U.S. Supreme Court unanimously reversed the U.S. Court of Appeals decision in ''[[Vacco v. Quill]],'' 521 U.S. 793 (1997).

In February 2015, New York state senators [[Brad Hoylman]] and [[Diane Savino]] introduced a "Death With Dignity Act" to allow physician-assisted suicide in the state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Lovett|first=Kenneth|date=9 February 2015|title=Timothy Cardinal Dolan will fight efforts in New York to legalize physician-assisted suicide|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/timothy-cardinal-dolan-fight-bill-assisted-suicide-article-1.2107898|newspaper=[[Daily News (New York)]]|access-date=1 Apr 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On September 7, 2017, in ''Myers v. Schneiderman'', the New York Court of Appeals held that terminally-ill persons did not possess a right to physician-assisted suicide under the New York State Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.politico.com/states/new-york/albany/story/2017/09/07/court-of-appeals-rejects-right-to-aid-in-dying-114347|title= |last= Niedzwiadek|first= Nick|date= September 7, 2017|website= www.politico.com|publisher= |access-date= October 29, 2017|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Nevada===
In May 2017, a bill was passed by the [[Nevada Senate|state senate]], which sought to legalize physician-assisted suicide. The Nevada Assembly Committee on Health and Human Services chose not to advance the bill in the 2017 season. Supporters say that they intend to reintroduce the legislation at Nevada's next legislative session, which will not take place until 2019. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Richardson|first=Seth |date=23 May 2017|title=Senate passes bill permitting doctor-assisted suicide|url=http://www.rgj.com/story/news/politics/2017/05/23/senate-passes-bill-permitting-doctor-assisted-suicide/340294001/|work=Reno Gazette Journal|location= |access-date=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://freebeacon.com/issues/nv-assisted-suicide-bill-dead-committee/|title=NV Assisted Suicide Bill Dead in Committee: Becomes 16th state to reject legislation in 2017|date=2017-06-07|work=Washington Free Beacon|access-date=2017-10-18|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State power to allow and regulate==

States have the power to regulate, allow or prohibit assisted suicide.

In 1997, in the cases of ''[[Washington v. Glucksberg]]'' and ''[[Vacco v. Quill]]'', the U.S. Supreme Court ruled unanimously that there is no Constitutional right to assisted suicide, and that states therefore have the right to prohibit it. Advocates of assisted suicide saw this as opening the door for debate on the issue at the state level.&lt;ref name=marker/&gt;

''[[Gonzales v. Oregon]]'' was brought to the United States [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] in 2006. The court ruled that the United States Attorney General could not enforce the federal Controlled Substances Act against physicians who prescribed drugs, in compliance with Oregon state law, for the assisted suicide of the terminally ill.

"'''Barge of the Dead'''" is an episode of the American [[science fiction on television|science fiction television]] series ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''. It is the third episode of the [[List of Star Trek: Voyager episodes|sixth season]] and was first broadcast by [[UPN]] on October 6, 1999. "Barge of the Dead" was developed from a story by [[Ronald D. Moore]] and [[Bryan Fuller]], who wrote the teleplay, and was directed by [[Mike Vejar]]. Set in the 24th century, the series follows the adventures of the [[Starfleet]] and [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] crew of the starship [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] after they are stranded in the [[Delta Quadrant]], far from the rest of the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]].

In this episode, the half-[[Klingon]], half-human [[B'Elanna Torres]] ([[Roxann Dawson]]) has a [[near-death experience]] and is sent to the Klingon version of [[Hell]] known as [[Gre'Thor|Gre'thor]]. There she encounters her Klingon mother Miral ([[Karen Austin]]), who is damned because of Torres' refusal to fully accept her own identity as a Klingon. After being resuscitated by the ''Voyager'' crew, Torres becomes intent on revisiting Gre'thor to save her mother. The episode also guest stars [[Eric Pierpoint]] as [[Kortar]], who ferries the souls of the dishonored on the Barge of the Dead, and Sherman Augustus as the dead Klingon Hij'Qa.

Moore originally developed the episode as part of a pitch for the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "[[Soldiers of the Empire]]". The idea was initially rejected, but was revisited for ''Star Trek: Voyager''. Following the episode's completion, both Moore and Fuller left the series because of dissatisfaction with their lack of control over its direction, and the perceived absence of strong story arcs across multiple episodes. "Barge of the Dead" was one of several episodes that addressed Torres' strained relationship with her parents and her Klingon heritage. Scholars have offered a range of opinions on Gre'thor, with the setting and ideology compared to [[Norse mythology]], [[Greek mythology]], and [[Catholic theology]]. The episode received a [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen rating]] of 3.8/6 ratings share, meaning 3.8 percent of all households with a television viewed it and six percent of that number were actively watching it. It was a drop from the episode broadcast the previous week. Critical response to the episode was mixed; some [[television criticism|television critics]] praised the focus on Torres and Dawson's performance, while others were critical of the representation of Klingon spirituality.

==Plot==
While returning from an [[Away team (Star Trek term)|away mission]], [[B'Elanna Torres]] encounters interference from an [[Geomagnetic storm|ion storm]] which results in a [[concussion]]. Commander [[Chakotay]] finds a [[Klingon]] artifact lodged inside Torres' [[Shuttlecraft (Star Trek)|shuttlecraft]], and Torres sees this emitting blood and hears voices speaking in the [[Klingon language]]. Since the [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] has been stranded in the [[Delta Quadrant]], the crew is several thousand [[light-year]]s away from Klingon-controlled space. [[Morale]] officer [[Neelix]] plans a celebration of the discovery of the object, believing it originates from the [[Alpha Quadrant]] and thus proves that the USS ''Voyager'' is getting closer to home; Torres resists the proposal for a party. She consults with Security Chief [[Tuvok]], who believes her negative response to the object stems from her hatred of her Klingon heritage. Tuvok assaults Torres with a Klingon weapon called a [[bat'leth]], saying she is not a true Klingon before dismissing her as dishonored. While attending the festivities in the mess hall, Torres notices [[The Doctor (Star Trek: Voyager)|the Doctor]] and [[Seven of Nine]] singing Klingon drinking songs and [[Tom Paris]] eating Klingon cuisine. After witnessing several Klingon warriors killing the crew, she falls and finds herself aboard a boat. Torres discovers that she is being transported to [[Gre'Thor|Gre'thor]] on the Barge of the Dead, and learns that her mother Miral was placed aboard as a dishonored soul.

Torres, who was in a [[coma]] the entire time, is resuscitated by Paris and the Doctor; she had almost died from the accident in the ion storm. Chakotay believes that Torres' encounter with her mother was a hallucination prompted from her [[near-death experience]], but she believes that it was real. Torres believes that her mother is being punished because of her daughter's dishonor, stating that she must return to the Barge of the Dead to rescue her. Captain [[Kathryn Janeway]] permits Torres to put herself in an [[induced coma]], with the Doctor monitoring the procedure. After being placed in a coma, Torres successfully returns to the barge. She reunites with her mother, but they argue about whether or not she has truly embraced Klingon spirituality. Miral responds by telling her that she does not understand what it truly means to be a Klingon. After their conversation, Torres decides to take her mother's place on the barge; even though Miral resists the transference, she is allowed to move on [[Sto-vo-kor]] (a version of the [[afterlife]] similar to the [[Norse mythology|Norse]] [[Valhalla]]) while Torres is escorted into Gre'thor. She discovers that ''Voyager'' is her version of Gre'thor, and is confronted by alternate versions of the crew. Miral returns to explain that she cannot fully be released into Sto-vo-kor until Torres completes her journey. Tuvok attacks Torres again with a bat'leth, but she surrenders rather than fighting back. Miral identifies this as the first step in her path. She informs Torres that they will reunite either in Sto-vo-kor or when Torres returns home. Torres is resuscitated and embraced by Janeway.

==Production==
[[File:Ronald D Moore - Comic Con 2013.jpg|thumb|alt=A man with shoulder length hair is looking towards the camera.|[[Ronald D. Moore]] originally pitched the idea for "Barge of the Dead" as a ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode before it was produced for ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]''.]]

Moore only contributed to two episodes in ''Star Trek: Voyager'', with the other being "[[Survival Instinct (Star Trek: Voyager)|Survival Instinct]]", the immediate predecessor to "Barge of the Dead". Discussing why he left the series, he said that he wanted to further develop more of its story arcs and characters, particularly focusing on the "internal strife among people trapped aboard ship(s) without any reasonable hope of finding sanctuary anytime soon".&lt;ref name="TrappedAboardtheShip"&gt;[[#PankCaro2009|Pank &amp; Caro (2009)]]: p. 200.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuller also left ''Star Trek: Voyager'' after the completion of the episode, citing disappointment in his lack of control over the show's direction.&lt;ref name="Blastr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blastr.com/2016-2-29/every-bryan-fuller-star-trek-episode-ranked|title=Every Bryan Fuller Star Trek episode, ranked|last=Roth|first=Dany|date=February 29, 2016|publisher=[[Blastr]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170519142346/http://www.blastr.com/2016-2-29/every-bryan-fuller-star-trek-episode-ranked|archivedate=May 19, 2017|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that he "began to get itchy and wanting to tell stories with a little more emotional depth", and that he disliked how [[Broadcast syndication|syndication]] discouraged longer story arcs spanning multiple episodes.&lt;ref name="Blastr" /&gt; Fuller's episodes frequently focused on "character development through adversity".

== Analysis ==
[[File:Otto Brausewetter Die Barke des Charon.jpg|left|thumb|alt=A painting of a man guiding a group of people on a boat through a river.|Critics compared the episode's representation of Gre'thor to mythological views of the afterlife, such as the rainbow bridge [[Bifröst]] or the river [[Styx]] (''pictured'').]]

[[TrekNation|''TrekToday'']]'s Edward James Hines identified "Barge of the Dead" as the final part of a "probably unplanned 'Torres Trilogy'", which also included the episodes "[[Day of Honor]]" and "[[Extreme Risk (Star Trek: Voyager)|Extreme Risk]]". Each one was broadcast as the third episode of their respective seasons; Hines viewed each installment of the trilogy as being linked by Torres' fear of death. He wrote that the episode showed how Torres becomes "responsible to herself and to others - no matter the risk - while choosing to live".&lt;ref name="TrekNationStuff"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.trektoday.com/reviews/barge_of_the_dead.shtml|title=Barge of the Dead|last=Hines|first=Edward James|date=October 6, 1999|website=[[TrekNation|TrekToday]]|publisher=Christian Höhne Sparborth |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20170522023623/https://www.trektoday.com/reviews/barge_of_the_dead.shtml|archivedate=May 22, 2017 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writer [[Paul Ruditis]] viewed the emphasis on Torres' "duality of nature" as leading to the development of several episodes prominently showcasing her character, including "Barge of the Dead".&lt;ref name="FamilyRuditis"&gt;[[Barge of the Dead#ruditis2003|Ruditis (2003)]]: p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; Ruditis connected Torres' storyline to Seven of Nine's in "Survival Instinct", writing that they both "deal with issues of life and death, with dramatic results". He referred to "Barge of the Dead" and "Survival Instinct" as "equally dark episodes".&lt;ref name="DyingRuditis"&gt;[[Barge of the Dead#ruditis2003|Ruditis (2003)]]: p. 319.&lt;/ref&gt; "Barge of the Dead" was also one of three episodes that featured Torres' relationship with her parents, with the [[Star Trek: Voyager (season 7)|season seven]] episodes "[[Lineage (Star Trek: Voyager)|Lineage]]" and "[[Author, Author (Star Trek: Voyager)|Author, Author]]" resolving her estrangement from her father.&lt;ref name="FamilyRuditis" /&gt;&lt;ref name="DaddyRuditis"&gt;[[#ruditis2003|Ruditis (2003)]]: p. 315.&lt;/ref&gt;

"Barge of the Dead" was the first episode to provide a detailed account of Gre'thor, which was previously referenced only in ''Star Trek: The Next Generation''. The title was developed from "the Klingon belief that the dead travel to Gre'thor on a barge steered by a ferryman". [[Religious studies]] scholars Ross Kraemer, William Cassidy, and Susan L Schwartz interpreted the representation of Gre'thor and Klingon spirituality as borrowing from Norse and [[Greek mythology|Greek]] mythology, specifically the crossing of the rainbow bridge [[Bifröst]] or the river [[Styx]].&lt;ref name="Mythos"&gt;[[#KraemerCassidySchwartz2009|Kraemer, Cassidy, &amp; Schwartz (2009)]]&lt;/ref&gt; Exploring the influence of the Greek story of [[Odysseus]] (Latin: Ulysses) on ''Star Trek: Voyager'', the [[Classical philologist]] [[Otta Wenskus]] points to [[Siren (mythology)|Siren]]-like creatures who call out with the voices of those loved by those on the barge. Though the motif of a barge and ferryman is not present in [[Homer]]'s portrayal of the underworld in the ''[[Odyssey]]'', it was subsequently popularized by its use in [[Virgil]]'s ''[[Aeneid]]'' and [[Dante]]'s ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Wenskus2017|Wenskus (2017)]]: p. 455.&lt;/ref&gt; The pediatrician Victor Grech, in a paper on Klingon culture, interpreted Torres' belief in the Klingon mythological figure [[Fek'lhr]], who tortures the souls of the dishonored, as being in line with [[Catholic Church|Catholic]] views of [[Satan]].&lt;ref name="SatanGod1"&gt;[[#Grech2016|Grech (2016)]]: p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kraemer, Cassidy, and Schwartz argued that "Barge of the Dead" mirrored the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' [[Star Trek: The Next Generation (season 6)|season six]] episode "[[Rightful Heir]]" by not providing a clear answer whether Torres' experiences in the Klingon afterlife were real or part of a hallucination.&lt;ref name="Mythos"/&gt; The [[Native American studies]] scholar Sierra S. Adare was critical of the portrayal of Chakotay—a Native American character—as dismissive of Torres' sincere belief in her experiences, writing that "[n]o Native person would ever dismiss another's visions as hallucinations or tell them to ignore their religious beliefs". She cited it as one instance in which the series represented Chakotay as "the quintessential [[Tonto]] in outer space".&lt;ref name="TontoNo!"&gt;[[#Adare2009|Adare (2009)]]: p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Television criticism|Television critics]] responded positively to Dawson's performance and the episode's focus on Torres.

The episode's representation of Klingon mythology garnered negative reviews from critics.

When biological computation refers to using [[biology]] to build [[computer]]s, it is a subfield of [[computer science]] and is distinct from the [[interdisciplinary]] [[science]] of [[bioinformatics]] which simply uses computers to better understand biology.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1586">'''Brig of Dread''' or '''Bridge of Dread''' is a bridge to [[Purgatory]] that a dead [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] had to cross. [[Evil]] souls fall from the bridge into [[hell]]. This is a common [[afterlife]] theme found in some form or other in many cultures.

The "Brig o' Dread" is an important element in ''The [[Lyke-Wake Dirge]]'', an old Northern English [[Wake (ceremony)|waking]] song.

There is much in that song that seems [[Germanic polytheism|Germanic heathen]]. The "Brig o' Dread" probably being related to [[Bifröst]] (which probably means "trembling-way") or [[Gjallarbrú]] ("resounding-bridge" or "noisy-bridge" &lt;ref&gt;[[Hilda Ellis Davidson|Hilda Roderick Ellis Davidson]] (1964). ''Gods and Myths of Northern Europe''. Penguin Books. p. 231.&lt;/ref&gt;) &lt;ref&gt;''The New Encyclopædia Britannica, Part 3, Volume 5'', 1983. p. 533&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Doniger (1999).

Merriam-Webster. {{ISBN|0-87779-044-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87779-044-0}}. p. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; which may be the symbolism here rather than the Christian later folk-etymological explanation.&lt;ref&gt;[[John Christopher Atkinson]], J.

It is also mentioned in ''The Ballad of Judas Iscariot'' by [[Robert Williams Buchanan|Robert Buchanan]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2207">'''[[Capital punishment]]''' was abolished in '''[[Suriname]]''' in 2015.

The last execution took place in 1982. By signing the Treaty of San José in 1987, the death penalty had already been abolished ''de facto''.

==History==
Since [[Suriname]] was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] colony until 1975, it followed Dutch law, which did not permit capital punishment. From independence in 1975 to 1980, capital punishment was on the books, but no crimes committed were considered severe enough to warrant prosecution for it. From 1980 to 1987, during the period of [[military dictatorship]], the death penalty was used by the military government in the early years of its rule to get rid of political opponents. The last judicial execution in Suriname was that of [[Wilfred Hawker]], a sergeant-major in the Surinamese military who had staged two unsuccessful coup attempts to overthrow the military government. He was executed by firing squad on 13 March 1982. The government did carry out a series of [[extrajudicial execution]]s in December 1982, when 15 imprisoned opponents of the military regime were shot without trial. The events would become known as the [[December murders]].

==Law==
The death penalty had already been abolished ''[[de facto]]'' by signing the Treaty of San José in 1987, and in March 2015, the National Assembly approved legislation formally abolishing the death penalty in Suriname. But the legislators raised the highest prison term limits from 30 to 50 years in what is seen as a compromise to amending the Criminal code.

A '''chauffeur''', ([[French language|French]], "heater upper") was a type of French criminal active from the 18th to the 20th centuries. In gangs, they carried out [[Home invasion]]s on remote, rural dwellings, then tortured the householders into revealing the hiding places of savings or valuables. This was often done by burning victims' feet in the fireplace, which gave rise to the name for them.

A notable gang was the [[Chauffeurs de la Drome]] who were responsible for eighteen murders between 1905 and 1908.&lt;ref name="Anderson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Anderson|title=In Thrall to Political Change: Police and Gendarmerie in France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqKByxmueEC&amp;pg=PA53|date=25 August 2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969364-1|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These attacks continued after the Second World War. ''Le gang des Romanis'' was active in [[Bourgogne]]  and ''Le Gang d’Albert'' was active in [[Picardy]] until their leaders were separately captured and executed in 1952.&lt;ref name="BAUER2013"&gt;{{cite book|author=Alain BAUER|title=Dictionnaire amoureux du Crime|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wJ6hqz3ZVJoC&amp;pg=PT107|date=21 February 2013|publisher=edi8|isbn=978-2-259-22072-9|pages=104–107}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The submarine hull number '''No. 361''' named ''[[Great Wall|The Great Wall]] #61'' (长城61号) was a Chinese [[People's Liberation Army Navy]] Type-035AIP (ES5E variant) (NATO reporting name [[Ming class|Ming III]]) conventional diesel/electric [[submarine]]. In April 2003, during an exercise in the [[Yellow Sea]] between [[North Korea]] and China's [[Shandong]] Province, the vessel suffered a mechanical failure that killed all 70 crew members on board.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;&lt;ref name=youji/&gt; It was one of China's worst peacetime military disasters. The PLA Navy's Commander [[Shi Yunsheng]] and Political Commissar [[Yang Huaiqing]] were both dismissed as a result of the accident.&lt;ref name="dtic" /&gt;

==Background==
{{main|Type 035 submarine}}
No. 361 was part of the 12th Brigade of the [[North Sea Fleet]] of the PLAN based at [[Lüshunkou]] (formerly Port Arthur) in [[Liaoning]] Province. It was a Type-035AIP (Ming class) submarine.{{citation needed|date=February 2018}}

According to CNN, China was increasing training and exercises of its submarines in the east to carry out a policy of "sea denial" to counter the powerful U.S. Pacific fleet.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnn.com/2003/WORLD/asiapcf/east/05/02/china.submarine China says sub disaster killed 70]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fatal incident==
According to the official Chinese news agency [[Xinhua]], all 70 crew members died when the submarine's diesel engine used up all the oxygen (because it failed to shut down properly) while the boat was submerged on April 16, 2003. The submarine, which was commanded by [[Commodore (rank)|Commodore]] Cheng Fuming (程福明), had been taking part in naval exercises east of Inner [[Changshan Islands]] in the Yellow Sea off the coast of Northeastern China. Along with its normal complement, the crew also included 13 trainee cadets from the Chinese naval academy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2003-07/02/content_936853.htm |title=Foreign Ministry Spokesperson's Press Conference on May 8, 2003 |access-date=2005-09-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060308055609/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/2003-07/02/content_936853.htm |archive-date=2006-03-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At a press conference on May 8, 2003, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhang Qiyue stated that while on an exercise east of Changshan Islands, the No. 361 submarine was lost due to a mechanical problem and all 70 onboard perished. The submarine had been towed to a port as of the time of the press conference.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press release |title=2003年5月8日外交部发言人在记者招待会上答记者问 |date=2003-05-08 |publisher=[[Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the People's Republic of China]] |url=http://www.fmprc.gov.cn/web//fyrbt_673021/dhdw_673027/t24552.shtml |access-date=2018-05-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the disaster, the crippled submarine drifted for ten days because it was on a silent, no-contact exercise. The boat was discovered by Chinese fishermen who noticed its periscope sticking above the surface on April 25, 2003.  The submarine was initially towed to Yulin Harbor near [[Sanya]] on [[Hainan]] Island before being taken back to the northeast seaport of [[Dalian]] in [[Liaoning]] province.

==Aftermath==
On May 2, 2003, Central Military Commission chairman [[Jiang Zemin]] said in a condolence message to the families of the dead that "the officers and sailors of 361 remembered their sacred duty entrusted to them by the Party and the people. They died on duty, sacrificed themselves for the country, and they are great losses to the People’s Navy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.people.com.cn/GB/shizheng/16/20030502/983786.html |title=我海军一潜艇失事 70官兵遇难 江泽民发唁电 |access-date=2018-05-07 |agency=[[Xinhua News Agency]] |editor-last=Song |editor-first=Liyun |location=Beijing |publication-date=2003-05-02 |trans-title=A Navy submarine suffered accident, all 70 onboard lost, Jiang Zemin sent condolence.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CMC Vice-chairman [[Guo Boxiong]] led an enquiry into the incident, which resulted in the dismissal or demotion of five senior PLAN officers in June 2013: Navy Commander [[Shi Yunsheng]] (replaced by [[Zhang Dingfa]]) and Political Commissar [[Yang Huaiqing]]; North Sea Fleet Commander [[Ding Yiping]], Political Commissar Chen Xianfeng (陈先锋), and Chief of Staff Xiao Xinnian.&lt;ref name=dtic&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/docs/citations/ADA591531 |title=Behind the Periscope: Leadership in China's Navy |author1=Becker, Jeffrey |author2=Liebenberg, David |author3=Mackenzie, Peter |date=December 2013 |publisher=[[Defense Technical Information Center]] |page=81}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ding Yiping had been groomed to be the candidate for Navy Commander, but was removed from contention after the accident.

'''Claude Jones''' (February 11, 1901&amp;nbsp;– January 17, 1962) was an American [[jazz]] [[Trombone|trombonist]].

Born in [[Boley, Oklahoma]], Jones began on trombone at age 13, and studied at [[Wilberforce University|Wilberforce College]] before [[dropping out]] in 1922 to join the Synco Jazz Band. This group eventually evolved into [[McKinney's Cotton Pickers]],  where he would play intermittently until 1929. From there, Jones played in a variety of noted [[swing jazz]] ensembles, including those of  [[Fletcher Henderson]] (1929–31, 1933–34, 1941–42, 1950), [[Don Redman]] (1931–33, 1943), [[Alex Hill (musician)|Alex Hill]], [[Chick Webb]], and [[Cab Calloway]] (1934–40, 1943). He recorded with [[Jelly Roll Morton]] in 1939 and [[Louis Armstrong]]/[[Sidney Bechet]] in 1940. In the 1940s, he also played with [[Coleman Hawkins]], [[Zutty Singleton]], [[Joe Sullivan]], [[Benny Carter]], and [[Duke Ellington]] (1944–48, 1951).

After completing his second stint with Ellington, he became a [[Steward's assistant|mess steward]] on the ship [[S.S. United States]], and died at sea in 1962.

The '''Clemson–South Carolina football brawl''' was an on-[[American football field|field]] altercation during an [[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] game between [[American football|football]] players from the [[University of South Carolina]] and [[Clemson University]]. The incident took place on November 20, 2004 at the [[Memorial Stadium, Clemson|Memorial Stadium]] in [[Clemson, South Carolina]]. This [[riot|disturbance]] led to serious repercussions handed down for those involved from the [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] (South Carolina's conference) and the [[Atlantic Coast Conference|ACC]] (Clemson's conference). This took place the day after a notable brawl at an NBA game in Detroit, the "[[Malice at the Palace]]".

==The fight==
Prior to the contest, some South Carolina players congregated at the corner of the endzone near the bottom of "the Hill" at Memorial Stadium as Clemson made their traditional entrance to the field. Brief shoving ensued between Gamecock and Tiger players, but was broken up quickly.

The brawl resulted late in the game after USC quarterback Syvelle Newton was knocked to the ground after a shot to the helmet following an incomplete pass on 4th and 11 with 5:48 left to go in the fourth quarter, and Clemson players lay on top of him preventing him from getting up.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbcsports.msnbc.com/id/10057787/ Clemson, South Carolina Recall The Brawl]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/ncf/news/story?id=1929371 ESPN - Both teams were bowl eligible - College Football&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cstv.com/sports/m-footbl/stories/101906abn.html Clemson, South Carolina Reflect On Past Brawl :: Two teams had plenty of time off between games after ugly brawl&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Players on the field from both teams engaged in shoving and punching and both benches practically cleared as chaos erupted. The iconic image of the brawl was of Clemson's Yusef Kelly kicking a helmetless South Carolina player in the head as he lay face down, attempting to protect his head with his hands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thestate.com/2009/11/24/1042903_a1042887/usc-clemson-football-memorable.html USC-Clemson football, memorable moments]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://chronicle.augusta.com/latest-news/2010-11-25/south-carolina-clemson-rivalry-gets-kinder South Carolina-Clemson rivalry gets kinder]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbssports.com/collegefootball/story/7916916 Clemson, South Carolina to opt out of bowl games]&lt;/ref&gt; [[South Carolina Highway Patrol|State Troopers]], as well as other local law enforcement officers, entered the field to restore order. No fans ever entered the field. Play was suspended for six minutes.

The fight overshadowed the last game [[Lou Holtz]] participated in as South Carolina's head coach, as he retired at the end of the season. Holtz quoted that he "is going to be remembered along with former [[List of Ohio State Buckeyes head football coaches|Ohio State coach]] [[Woody Hayes]] for having a fight at the Clemson game," alluding to the [[1978 Gator Bowl]]. Holtz then handed the coaching reins to [[Steve Spurrier]]. Clemson won the game 29–7.

The following year (2005), in a showing of sportsmanship which was coordinated by both schools' athletic departments and administrations, both teams met at midfield at [[Williams-Brice Stadium]] at the University of South Carolina and shook hands.

==The consequences==

The ACC and SEC reviewed the tapes of both incidents before handing out proper punishments to players. However, both schools imposed a punishment of their own on November 22, by saying that neither team would be permitted to play in a bowl game because of the brawl.

Both the SEC and ACC suspended players from each school, with the SEC's penalties effective for South Carolina's first game of the 2005-06 season, against [[UCF Knights football|Central Florida]], while the ACC allowed Clemson to stagger the suspensions for their offending players at various games during the 2005-06 season.

The ACC's policy on players serving suspensions permitted Clemson to punish the players during the season, and not an immediate penalty during the Tigers' first game of 2005, against [[Texas A&amp;M Aggies football|Texas A&amp;M]].  Some of the offending players were involved in the crucial game, which resulted in a Tigers win in the final seconds. The penalties were served, based on a case-by-case basis, in midseason games against the winless [[Temple Owls football|Temple]] and one game winner [[Duke Blue Devils|Duke]].

'''Cleopatra Thea''' ({{lang-el|Κλεοπάτρα Θεά}}, which means "Cleopatra the Goddess"; c. 164 – 121 BC) surnamed '''Eueteria''' (i.e., "good-harvest/fruitful season") was the ruler of the [[Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid Empire]]. She was [[queen consort]] of Syria from 150 to about 125 BC as the wife of three [[Syria (region)|Syrian]] kings: [[Alexander Balas]], [[Demetrius II Nicator]], and [[Antiochus VII Sidetes]]. She ruled Syria from 125 BC after the death of Demetrius II Nicator, eventually in co-regency with her son [[Antiochus VIII Grypus]] until 121 or 120 BC.&lt;ref name="DH"&gt;Aidan Dodson, Dyan Hilton, The Complete Royal Families of Ancient Egypt, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CB"&gt;[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/Egypt/ptolemies/thea_fr.htm Cleopatra Thea] by Chris Bennett&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

===Childhood and first marriage===
Cleopatra Thea grew up in Egypt as the  daughter of [[Ptolemy VI]] and [[Cleopatra II]]. She was  probably born ca. 164 BC. She may have been engaged to her uncle Ptolemy VIII king of Cyrene in 154, but he eventually married her sister Cleopatra III. In 150 BC she married [[Alexander Balas]] in a sumptuous ceremony at [[Ptolemais Akko]].&lt;ref&gt;[[I Maccabees]] 10.48-10.58&lt;/ref&gt; The marriage produced a son named [[Antiochus VI Dionysus]].&lt;ref name="Maccabees11"/&gt;

===Divorce and later marriages ===
In 145 BC her father invaded Syria, defeated Alexander Balas in battle and remarried her to [[Demetrius II Nicator|Demetrius II]], only to die a few days later.&lt;ref name="Maccabees11"&gt;[[I Maccabees]] 11.1-11.19&lt;/ref&gt; Demetrius set himself up as co-ruler with the young boy Antiochus VI, but may have killed him in 142 BC.

In 139 BC Demetrius II was captured fighting against the [[Parthia]]ns and was held prisoner by them until 129 BC. After Demetrius was captured, his younger brother, [[Antiochus VII Sidetes]], who was raised in the city of Side in Pamphylia, came to Syria and took the throne, marrying Cleopatra Thea in 138 BC. Cleopatra Thea bore him at least one son, [[Antiochus IX Cyzicenus]]. The names of any other children are uncertain.

In 129 BC, the Parthians released Demetrius II, as a political manoeuvre against Sidetes, to claim his throne and his wife.

That same year Sidetes was killed fighting the Parthians. Cleopatra had taken the precaution of sending Antiochus IX (her son by Antiochus VII) to [[Cyzicus]] in [[Anatolia|Asia Minor]] (hence his surname). Demetrius returned home and regained his throne, taking Cleopatra Thea as his wife by his side.&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt;

In 132/131 BC Cleopatra Thea's mother, Cleopatra II of Egypt rebelled against her brother Ptolemy VIII Euergetes II Tryphon. In 127 BC Cleopatra II fled to her son-in-law Demetrius' court in Syria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/Egypt/ptolemies/ptolemy_viii_fr.htm Cleopatra II] by Chris Bennett&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years as co-regent===
[[File:Seleucidi, cleopatra tea e suo figlio antioco VIII, tetradracma, 121-120 ac.JPG|thumb|Coin of Cleopatra Thea and Antiochus VIII]]
Demetrius' elder son, Seleucus, became king with the name Seleucus V in 125 BC; however, his mother, Cleopatra Thea, had him murdered soon after. From 125 BC to 121 BC, Cleopatra ruled Syria and to legitimize her reign, she shared the throne with her son, [[Antiochus VIII Grypus]]. Antiochus VIII was married to Tryphaena, the daughter of Ptolemy VIII and Cleopatra III.&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tyndalehouse.com/Egypt/ptolemies/tryphaena_fr.htm Tryphanea] by Chris Bennett&lt;/ref&gt;

Grypus became less controllable as he grew up and in 121 BC Cleopatra Thea decided to eliminate him. As he returned from a hunt one day, she offered him a cup of wine. Since this was not common behavior for her, Grypus was suspicious and forced her to drink the wine, which killed her.&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt;

Grypus re-organised the state and for the next eight years he provided stability and financial recovery. This period would end ca. 114 BC, when Cleopatra Thea's other son, Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, returned to Syria to claim the throne and civil war started again.

==Family==
[[File:AlexanderIBalasAndCleopatraThea.jpg|thumb|Alexander Balas and Cleopatra Thea]]
Cleopatra Thea was a daughter of Ptolemy VI and Cleopatra II of Egypt. She had two brothers named Ptolemy Eupator and Ptolemy respectively. Her sister [[Cleopatra III]] was Queen of Egypt and married to [[Ptolemy VIII]], an uncle, who had been a former co-ruler of Cleopatra Thea’s parents. It is possible that Berenice, the fiancée of [[Attalus III]], king of [[Pergamum]] is another sister.&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt;

Cleopatra Thea married three times:
* She married Alexander Balas (Greek: Ἀλέξανδρος Βάλας) in about 150 BC. This union produced Antiochus VI Dionysus.&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt; Alexander Balas was neither popular, nor an efficient ruler. The marriage was dissolved by her father.&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt; Alexander Balas died in battle against Demetrius II of Syria in 145 BC.&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;
*Cleopatra Thea married Demetrius II Nicator (Greek: Δημήτριος Νικάτωρ) in 145 BC. Demetrius became a captive of the Parthians from 139-129 BC. He was assassinated in Tyre in 125 BC at the orders of his wife Cleopatra Thea.&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt; Demetrius and Cleopatra Thea had at least two sons–[[Seleucus V Philometor]], who was killed by his mother for taking the crown without her permission; and [[Antiochus VIII Grypus]], who eventually killed his mother in turn. They also had a daughter Laodice, whom [[Phraates II of Parthia]] captured and later married for her beauty.&lt;ref name="ogden-dinasties"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ogden|first1=Daniel|title=Polygamy Prostitutes and Death. The Hellenistic Dynasties|date=1999|publisher=Gerald Duckworth &amp; Co. Ltd.|location=London|isbn=07156 29301|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Cleopatra Thea married Demetrius' younger brother Antiochus VII Sidetes in 137 BC after Demetrius was captured by the Parthians. Cleopatra and Antiochus VII had at least one son: Antiochus IX Cyzicenus. They also likely had two other sons named Antiochus and Seleucus and one or two daughters named Laodice.&lt;ref name="DH"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CB"/&gt;

A '''cotyledon''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|k|ɒ|t|ᵻ|ˈ|l|iː|d|ən}}; "seed leaf" from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''cotyledon'',{{sfn|Short|George|2013|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=dFcKLxqEAj4C&amp;pg=PA15 p.&amp;nbsp;15]}} from [[Greek language|Greek]]: κοτυληδών ''kotylēdōn'', gen.: κοτυληδόνος ''kotylēdonos'', from κοτύλη [[Cotyla|''kotýlē'']] "cup, bowl") is a significant part of the [[embryo]] within the [[seed]] of a [[plant]], and is defined by the Oxford English Dictionary as "The primary leaf in the embryo of the higher plants (Phanerogams); the seed-leaf."{{sfn|OED|2015}} Upon [[germination]], the cotyledon may become the embryonic first [[leaf|leaves]] of a seedling. The number of cotyledons present is one characteristic used by botanists to classify the [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms). Species with one cotyledon are called [[monocotyledonous]] ("monocots"). Plants with two embryonic leaves are termed [[dicotyledonous]] ("dicots").

In the case of dicot seedlings whose cotyledons are photosynthetic, the cotyledons are functionally similar to leaves. However, true leaves and cotyledons are developmentally distinct. Cotyledons are formed during embryogenesis, along with the root and shoot meristems, and are therefore present in the seed prior to germination. True leaves, however, are formed post-embryonically (i.e. after germination) from the shoot apical meristem, which is responsible for generating subsequent aerial portions of the plant.

The cotyledon of [[Poaceae|grasses]] and many other monocotyledons is a highly modified leaf composed of a ''[[Scutellum (botany)|scutellum]]'' and a ''[[coleoptile]]''. The scutellum is a tissue within the seed that is specialized to absorb stored food from the adjacent [[endosperm]]. The coleoptile is a protective cap that covers the ''plumule'' (precursor to the stem and leaves of the plant).

[[Gymnosperm]] seedlings also have cotyledons, and these are often variable in number (multicotyledonous), with from 2 to 24 cotyledons forming a whorl at the top of the [[hypocotyl]] (the embryonic stem) surrounding the plumule. Within each species, there is often still some variation in cotyledon numbers, e.g. [[Monterey Pine|Monterey pine]] (''Pinus radiata'') seedlings have 5–9, and [[Jeffrey Pine|Jeffrey pine]] (''Pinus jeffreyi'') 7–13 (Mirov 1967), but other species are more fixed, with e.g. [[Cupressus sempervirens|Mediterranean cypress]] always having just two cotyledons. The highest number reported is for [[big-cone pinyon]] (''Pinus maximartinezii''), with 24 (Farjon &amp; Styles 1997).

The cotyledons may be ephemeral, lasting only days after emergence, or persistent, enduring at least a year on the plant. The cotyledons contain (or in the case of gymnosperms and monocotyledons, have access to) the stored food reserves of the [[seed]]. As these reserves are used up, the cotyledons may turn green and begin [[photosynthesis]], or may wither as the first true leaves take over food production for the seedling.&lt;ref name="Vines 1913"/&gt;

Cotyledons may be either [[epigeal germination|epigeal]], expanding on the germination of the seed, throwing off the seed shell, rising above the ground, and perhaps becoming photosynthetic; or [[hypogeal germination|hypogeal]], not expanding, remaining below ground and not becoming photosynthetic. The latter is typically the case where the cotyledons act as a storage organ, as in many [[nut (fruit)|nuts]] and [[acorn]]s.

Hypogeal plants have (on average) significantly larger seeds than epigeal ones. They are also capable of surviving if the seedling is clipped off, as [[meristem]] buds remain underground (with epigeal plants, the meristem is clipped off if the seedling is grazed). The tradeoff is whether the plant should produce a large number of small seeds, or a smaller number of seeds which are more likely to survive.&lt;ref name="tischler"&gt;{{citation | title = Response of Seedlings of Two Hypogeal Brush Species to CO2 Enrichment |author1=Charles R.

Related plants show a mixture of hypogeal and epigeal development, even within the same plant family.  Groups which contain both hypogeal and epigeal species include, for example, the [[Araucariaceae]] family of Southern Hemisphere conifers,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title = Phyloghuhenetic relationships within Araucariaceae based on rbcL gene sequences | url = http://www.amjbot.org/cgi/content/full/85/11/1507 |author1=Hiroaki Setoguchi |author2=Takeshi Asakawa Osawa |author3=Jean-Christophe Pintaud |author4=Tanguy Jaffré |author5=Jean-Marie Veillon | journal = American Journal of Botany | year = 1998 | volume = 85 | pages = 1507–1516 | doi = 10.2307/2446478 | jstor = 2446478 | issue = 11 | pmid = 21680310 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Fabaceae]] (pea family),&lt;ref name="tischler" /&gt; and the genus ''[[Lilium]]'' (see [[Lily seed germination types]]).  The frequently garden grown [[common bean]] - Phaseolus vulgaris - is epigeal while the closely related [[runner bean]] - Phaseolus coccineus - is hypogeal.

==History==
The term ''cotyledon'' was coined by [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628–1694).{{efn|The Oxford English Dictionary attributes it [[Linnaeus]] (1707–1778) "1751 Linnaeus ''Philos. Bot.'' 54. ''Cotyledon, corpus laterale seminis, bibulum, caducum''" {{sfn|Linnaeus|1751|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/philosophiabotan00linn#page/54/mode/2up p.&amp;nbsp;54]}} and 89, {{sfn|Linnaeus|1751|loc=[https://archive.org/stream/philosophiabotan00linn#page/89/mode/1up p.&amp;nbsp;89]}} by analogy with a similar structure of the same name in the [[Cotyledon (placenta)|placenta]].{{sfn|OED|2015}}}} [[John Ray]] was the first botanist to recognize that some plants have two and others only one, and eventually the first to recognize the immense importance of this fact to [[systematics]], in ''Methodus plantarum'' (1682).&lt;ref name="Vines 1913"&gt;{{Citation | author = [[Sydney Howard Vines|Vines, Sydney Howard]] | year = 1913 | chapter = Robert Morison 1620—1683 and John Ray 1627—1705 | pages = 8–43 | editor = [[Francis Wall Oliver|Oliver, Francis Wall]] | title = Makers of British botany | publisher = Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, E.

[[Theophrastus]] (3rd or 4th century BC) and [[Albertus Magnus]] (13th century) may also have recognized the distinction between the dicotyledons and monocotyledons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bioetymology.blogspot.com.br/2011/06/cotyledon-monocotyledon-plural-usually.html|title=BIOETYMOLOGY : ORIGIN IN BIOMEDICAL TERMS: cotyledon, monocotyledon (plural usually monocots), dicotyledons(plural usually dicots)|author=|date=|website=bioetymology.blogspot.com.br|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greene, E.

'''Cyberware''' is a relatively new and unknown field (a [[proto-science]], or more adequately a "proto-technology"). In [[science fiction]] circles, however, it is commonly known to mean the [[computer hardware|hardware]] or machine parts implanted in the human body and acting as an [[Interface (computing)|interface]] between the [[central nervous system]] and the computers or machinery connected to it.

More formally:
:''Cyberware is technology that attempts to create a working interface between machines/computers and the human nervous system, including the brain''.

Examples of potential cyberware cover a wide range, but current research tends to approach the field from one of two different angles: interfaces or prosthetics.

==Interfaces ("Headware")==
{{see also|Brain–computer interface}}
[[File:EEG Recording Cap.jpg|thumb]]
The first variety attempts to connect directly with the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Fromherz, Peter; "Neuroelectronic Interfacing: Semiconductor Chips with Ion Channels, Nerve Cells, and Brain"; ''Nanoelectronics and Information Technology'', pp. 781–810, Editor [[Rainer_Waser|R. Waser]], Wiley-VCH, Berlin, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The data-jack is probably the best-known, having heavily featured in works of fiction (even in mainstream productions such as ''[[Johnny Mnemonic]],'' the cartoon [[Exosquad]], and  ''[[The Matrix]]''). It is the most difficult object to implement, but it is also the most important in terms of interfacing directly with the [[mind]].&lt;ref&gt;Hooper, Simon (October 21, 2004) [http://edition.cnn.com/2004/TECH/10/20/explorers.braingate/ ''Brain chip offers hope for paralyzed''] CNN&lt;/ref&gt; In science fiction the data-jack is the envisioned [[Computer port (hardware)|I/O port]] for the brain. Its job is to translate thoughts into something meaningful to a computer, and to translate something from a computer into meaningful thoughts for humans. Once perfected, it would allow direct communication between computers and the human mind.

Large university laboratories conduct most of the experiments done in the area of direct neural interfaces. For ethical reasons, the tests are usually performed on animals or slices of brain tissue from donor brains. The mainstream research focuses on electrical impulse monitoring, recording and translating the many different electrical signals that the brain transmits. A number of companies are working on what is essentially a "hands-free" mouse or keyboard.&lt;ref&gt;Lusted, HS and Knapp, "RB Controlling Computers with Neural Signals". ''[[Scientific American]]'', October 1996&lt;/ref&gt; This technology uses these brain signals to control computer functions. These interfaces are sometimes called ''[[Brain–computer interface|brain-machine interfaces]]'' (BMI).

The more intense research, concerning full in-brain interfaces, is being studied, but is in its infancy. Few can afford the huge cost of such enterprises, and those who can find the work slow-going and very far from the ultimate goals. Research has reached the level where limited control over a computer is possible using thought commands alone.  After being implanted with a Massachusetts-based firm [[Cyberkinetics]] chip called [[BrainGate]], a quadriplegic man was able to compose and check email.&lt;ref&gt;Khamsi, R. (2004). Paralyzed man sends e-mail by thought ''News@nature'', doi:10.1038/news041011-9&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prosthetics ("Bodyware")==
[[File:Brain-Controlled Prosthetic Arm 2.jpg|thumb]]
The second variety of cyberware consists of a more modern form of the rather old field of [[prosthetics]]. Modern prostheses attempt to deliver a natural functionality and appearance. In the sub-field where prosthetics and cyberware cross over, experiments have been done where [[microprocessor]]s, capable of controlling the movements of an artificial [[Limb (anatomy)|limb]], are attached to the severed [[nerve]]-endings of the patient. The patient is then taught how to operate the prosthetic, trying to learn how to move it as though it were a natural limb.&lt;ref&gt;Houston, V. L., Mason, C. P., Beattie, A. C., LaBlanc, K. P., Garbarini, M., Lorenze, E. J., &amp; Thongpop, C. M. (1995). The VA-cyberware lower limb prosthetics-orthotics optical laser digitizer. Journal of Rehabilitation Research and Development, 32(1), 55.&lt;/ref&gt;

Crossing over between prostheses and interfaces are those pieces of equipment attempting to replace lost [[sense]]s. An early success in this field is the ''[[cochlear implant]]''. A tiny device inserted into the [[inner ear]], it replaces the functionality of damaged, or missing, [[hair cell]]s (the cells that, when stimulated, create the sensation of [[sound]]). This device comes firmly under the field of prosthetics, but experiments are also being performed to tap into the [[Human brain|brain]]. Coupled with a [[Speech processing|speech-processor]], this could be a direct link to the speech centres of the brain.&lt;ref&gt;Branwyn, Gareth "The desire to be wired". [[Wired_(magazine)|''Wired'']] Issue 1.04, October 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Chan Yuk-cheung''' ({{zh-t|陳毓祥}}; 14 October 1950 – 26 September 1996) was born in [[Chaoyang District, Shantou|Chaoyang]], Guangdong, China. He was a prominent leader of the [[Baodiao movement]] in Hong Kong. The movement advocates Chinese sovereignty over the [[Senkaku Islands|Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands]] in the [[Senkaku Islands dispute|Diaoyu/Senkaku Islands dispute between China and Japan]].

==Biography==
Being a high school graduate from [[King's College, Hong Kong]], David Chan Yuk-cheung obtained a bachelor's degree from the [[University of Hong Kong]] and a master's degree from the [[Chinese University of Hong Kong]].

He began participating in the Baodiao movement in 1970. He joined the protest staged by university students at the [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong|Victoria Park]] in 1971 when he was a secondary school student. When he studied in the University of Hong Kong, he served as chairman for the Movement for Defending Diaoyu Islands, an active subgroup of the [[Hong Kong Federation of Students]]. After graduation, he worked for the Hong Kong government's radio and TV station [[RTHK]] and the Cantonese broadcasting section of the [[BBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chan Y.C. working at BBC|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ukchina/simp/uk_life/culture_gap/110605_culturegap_bbcchinese_70_pt3.shtml|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was amongst the first generation of hosts for [[Phone-in]] programs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Phone-in program presented by Chan Y.C.|url=http://www.rthk.org.hk/classicschannel/main_radio_80_s2.htm|publisher=RTHK}}&lt;/ref&gt; and acquired notable fame as a TV presenter in Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=David Chan interviews singer Agnes Chan|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KmZMalRyxUw|publisher=Youtube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was selected as one of Hong Kong's [[Ten Outstanding Young Persons]] by [[Junior Chamber International]] Hong Kong (JCIHK) in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TOYP Award|url=http://www.jcihk.org/toyp/chief/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political life==
Chan was an independent candidate in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1991|1991 Hong Kong Legislative Council election]] for the [[Hong Kong Island (constituency)#1991 Constituencies|Hong Kong Island West]] Constituency. He gained 29,413 votes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hkjo.lib.hku.hk/archive/files/15b9002d3a793f305c3d69e88d2a7b67.pdf] Election results&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, he ran again in the [[Hong Kong legislative election, 1995|Legislative Council election]] and gained 10,514 votes in the [[Financing, Insurance, Real Estate and Business Services (constituency)|Financing, Insurance, Real Estate and Business Services]] constituency. He lost both elections.

==Death==
On 26 September 1996, activists on board the ship ''Baodiao'' arrived in the waters around the [[Diaoyu Islands]]. Chan Yuk-cheung, along with 5 fellow activists, jumped into the sea and swam to the island wearing life jackets. While swimming, Chan's feet were caught by wires and his head was injured. He passed out in the water and remained upside down for several minutes, possibly suffering from asphyxiation. After a long time, a Japanese patrol boat rescued him and sent him to [[Okinawa]] by helicopter, where he died. When his coffin arrived at the Hong Kong [[Kai Tak Airport]], it was covered with the Chinese national flag.

===Aftermath===
His death was mourned by tens of thousands of people in [[Victoria Park, Hong Kong]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thousands Mourn Drowned Protester|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1996-09-30/news/9609300156_1_hong-kong-pro-democracy-protest|newspaper=Chicago Tribune|date=30 September 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 6 October 1996, the memorial service for "Chan Yuk-cheung, hero for defending the Diaoyu Islands" was held in Hong Kong; more than 2,000 people including officials from [[mainland China]] and Hong Kong had attended the service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Diaoyu visit to show sovereign determination|url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/hkedition/2006-09/21/content_693485.htm|newspaper=China Daily}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chan's death greatly influenced the unification of the different factions within the Baodiao movement.

On 22 October 2006, activists of the [[Action Committee for Defending the Diaoyu Islands]] from Hong Kong, [[Macau]], and Taiwan attempted to approach the islands on board the fishing boat ''Baodiao II'', in memory of Chan Yuk-cheung on the 10th anniversary of his death. They were turned away from the islands by Japanese Coast Guard boats, but paid a public tribute to Chen Yuk-cheung at a position ten nautical miles from the islands.

==Books==
Chan wrote a number of books on Hong Kong society and politics during his lifetime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Books written by Chan Y.C.|url=https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=inauthor:%22%E9%99%B3%E6%AF%93%E7%A5%A5%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==
Chan's elder daughter, Chan On Yin, is a theater actress who graduated from the [[Hong Kong Academy for Performing Arts]]. His younger son, Brian, is an actor and host on Hong Kong's [[Now TV (China)|Now TV]] and [[ViuTV]] (both are owned by [[PCCW]], via its subsidiaries).

Born on 8 October 1970,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cross|first=Rod|title=Evidence for Murder: How Physics Convicted a Killer|year=2009|publisher=UNSW Press|isbn=1459603516|page=8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hsf7yZDEzJwC&amp;pg=PA8&amp;lpg=PA8&amp;dq=caroline+byrne+born+1970&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=pzraUARHUm&amp;sig=Wjn1qIz7hm0E4E6SWPF9XWj39uE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dbvHUd6QCsfDkwXgm4CYAw&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=caroline%20byrne%20born%201970&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Byrne had been in a relationship with Wood since 1992. She was a model but principally worked as a modelling instructor for Sydney deportment and etiquette educator [[June Dally-Watkins]]. On 7 June 1995, she failed to turn up for work and for an appointment with a psychiatrist. There were three claimed sightings of her near The Gap at [[Watsons Bay, New South Wales|Watsons Bay]] that afternoon and evening, in the company of two men, one of whom matched Wood's description. Two of the sightings – at 1 pm and 3 pm – were by local cafe owners, Craig Martin and Lance Melbourne. In 1998 John Doherty, an Irish artist who had been out of the country in the intervening years, came forward to say that around 8.30pm that evening he too had seen Byrne outside his studio window arguing with one man while another man stood nearby.&lt;ref name="Mystery born in a woman's dying cry"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/mystery-born-in-womans-final-scream/2006/04/04/1143916528022.html?page=fullpage#contentSwap1 |title=Mystery born in a woman's dying cry |first=Philip |last=Cornford |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=5 April 2006 |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood denied being present at Watsons Bay that afternoon. Evidence was sworn at both inquests by Wood's friends Brett Cochrane and Nic Samartis that they lunched with him briefly around 1:15 pm in [[Potts Point, New South Wales|Potts Point]] before he was called away after a call from Rivkin.&lt;ref name=Chenoweth&gt;{{cite book |first=Neil |last=Chenoweth |title=Packer's Lunch |publisher=Allen and Unwin |year=2007 |isbn=978-1-74175-323-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|206 }} Wood claimed that he was asked by Rivkin to chauffeur prominent lobbyist and ex-federal minister [[Graham Richardson]] to an appointment and then spent the afternoon doing regular chores for Rivkin before going home around 7 pm. The Richardson alibi was compromised by Richardson when he was interviewed by police in 2001, when he advised that he had lunched that day with rugby league administrator [[Peter Bullfrog Moore|Peter Moore]].&lt;ref name="Mystery born in a woman's dying cry"/&gt;

Wood's movements in the afternoon have never been reported prior to the late evening, when Wood said he awoke on his couch having fallen asleep in front of the television and was immediately alarmed that Byrne was still not home. Wood has said he did not know Byrne's whereabouts but was led by what he termed "[[telepathy|telepathic communication]]" to The Gap. He had first driven to the beachfront car-park at Bondi Beach where he and Byrne had spent much time and then to a favourite park at Camp Cove where they had often picnicked.  Heading back from Camp Cove he spotted Byrne's white Suzuki Vitara parked in a lane at The Gap. It was when running about the cliff-top and shouting her name that Wood encountered two rock fishermen who verified his appearance around midnight.

Wood then rang Tony Byrne and Caroline's brother Peter. He drove back into Sydney city and collected them and all three then went to the Gap and scoured the cliff-top. Peter Byrne later gave evidence that at about 1am Wood claimed to have spotted her body at the base of the cliff using torchlight. Byrne himself said he could see nothing and nor could the police who arrived soon after with police torches. The night was dark and the cliff misty. Peter Byrne claimed it was difficult to see the rocks below the cliff, let alone a body. The contention whether Wood had claimed he could see something in the darkness figured in much media speculation over the years and formed a key part of Crown evidence in the 2008 trial. In 2011 the Appeal Court felt that the Crown had presented speculation in this area posing as evidence. This was one of the grounds resulting in Wood's 2011 appeal being upheld.

The identity of the second man supposedly sighted by Melbourne and Martin with Wood in Watsons Bay earlier in the day has remained unclear. With evidence contradicting the likelihood that the man was either of those whom the police considered in investigation (Byrne's modelling agent Adam Leigh or Rivkin associate Gary Redding) the Crown chose to pose speculation without evidence on either during the trial and drew criticism from the trial judge and later the appellant judges.

==Media interest==
Byrne's death was accepted as a suicide by local Rose Bay Police and others. No photographs were taken of the location of her body's landing point.

In 1996, Byrne's father begin to agitate against the notion of suicide such that from 1997 onwards the case and circumstances of Byrne's death were regularly examined in Australia's national newspapers and reported as "one of Sydney's unsolved crimes". The death of a beautiful model at one of Sydney's notorious suicide spots, the connection to the flamboyant and newsworthy Rivkin, and a net of witnesses and commentators which included some prominent Sydney identities all added to the intrigue of the case.

===Offset Alpine speculation===
Attention was particularly heightened by the still unproven speculation of a connection with Rene Rivkin's financial activities.  The day before Byrne's death, Wood and Rivkin were interviewed by the [[Australian Securities and Investments Commission]] about the [[Offset Alpine fire]] of 1993 and the true ownership of share parcels traded in Offset Alpine owned by nominees related to [[Swiss bank]] accounts.&lt;ref name=Chenoweth /&gt;{{rp|203}} Tony Byrne claimed that Wood had indicated to his daughter that the fire was a set-up for insurance purposes.

Ultimately in 2001 Rivkin was charged with insider trading (of [[Qantas]] shares) and his eventual conviction in 2003 had a devastating effect on his mental stability, culminating in his 2005 suicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/Business/Pity-the-poor-man/2005/05/02/1114886315349.html |title=Pity the poor man |first=Ian |last=Verrender |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=3 May 2005 |accessdate=24 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; However the ASIC investigation into share trading in [[Offset Alpine]] and the true beneficiaries proved an epic that outlived Rivkin, commencing in 1995 and continuing from 2005  with a focus shifted to Graham Richardson and [[Trevor Kennedy]] until eventually closed without outcome by ASIC in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Moran, Susannah |title=ASIC gives up on Offset Alpine mystery |date=29 May 2010 |work=The Australian |url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/asic-gives-up-on-offset-alpine-mystery/story-e6frg6nf-1225872772227 |accessdate=8 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peripheral celebrities===
Adding to this intrigue was a list of celebrities with a peripheral involvement in the case. Byrne's medical doctor who had referred her to the psychiatric appointment she did not keep on 7 June was television celebrity [[physician]], Dr [[Cindy Pan]].&lt;ref name=Chenoweth /&gt;{{rp|205 }} [[Graham Richardson]]'s diarised luncheon appointment that day (which caused him to question whether he may have been chauffeured anywhere by Wood) was with [[rugby league]] identity [[Peter Bullfrog Moore]] at Sydney's [[Hilton Hotel]] and was set up to broker a peace deal in the [[Super League war]] which deeply divided Australian [[rugby league]] at that time. Wood always claimed that he had driven Moore from a noon meeting with Rivkin to what may well have been a lunch, though the press and (later) the Crown ignored this possibility. Moore died in July 2000 a year prior to the Strikeforce Irondale interview with Richardson, thus preventing corroboration of the luncheon timings and Rivkin too was dead before the trial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Let me see Caroline's breasts: Wood |author=Wainwright, Robert |date=27 June 2007 |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/let-me-see-her-breasts-asked-wood/2007/06/26/1182623909282.html |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrne's close friends included entertainer [[Tania Zaetta]] and actress [[Kylie Watson]], a ''[[Home and Away]]'' cast member. It was the amateur sleuthing around Watsons Bay armed with photographs of Byrne in the weeks after her death which had Dally-Watkins and Watson uncover the Martin/Melbourne sighting lead.&lt;ref name=Chenoweth /&gt;{{rp|206 }} Other celebrity witnesses who figured in the case at some point included businessman [[John Singleton (Australian entrepreneur)|John Singleton]],  journalist [[Paul Barry]] and paparazzo Jamie Fawcett.

==Inquests, investigation and trials==
Two [[inquest]]s were held into Byrne's death by [[Coroner's Court of New South Wales|New South Wales State coroner]] John Abernethy, with Wood claiming it was suicide.  The second inquest in 1998 delivered an open finding. That same year, Wood left Australia.

Police investigations continued from 2000 onwards as "Strikeforce Irondale" with hundreds of witnesses interviewed and resulting in a brief of evidence running to more than 350 pages. Caroline's father Tony Byrne continued to press for action from the investigation eventually enrolling the assistance of New South Wales politician [[Fred Nile]] who raised questions about the investigation in [[New South Wales Legislative Council|State Parliament]] up till 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.parliament.nsw.gov.au/Hansard/Pages/HansardResult.aspx#/docid/HANSARD-1820781676-58818 |title=Caroline Byrne Murder Investigation |author=Nile, Fred |authorlink=Fred Nile |work=Hansard transcript |publisher=Parliament of New South Wales |date=18 March 2004 |accessdate=8 April 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004 scientific reports relating to the physics of a body falling/jumping/being projected from the cliff produced by Professor [[Rod Cross]] were the principal elements of new evidence which encouraged the Crown to push for a trial of Gordon Wood.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"&gt;{{cite news |first=Robert |last=Wainwright |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/man-threw-girlfriend-like-a-spear/2007/06/12/1181414266163.html%7C |title=Man 'threw girlfriend like a spear' |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=12 June 2007 |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006 the New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions [[Nicholas Cowdery]] [[Queen's Counsel|QC]] agreed with police that there was enough evidence to charge Wood with Byrne's murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/worldtoday/content/2006/s1608237.htm |title=Police make breakthrough in high profile murder case |work=The World Today |location=Australia |date=4 April 2006 |format=transcript |author=Kennedy, Jane |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wood was detained in London in April 2006, [[extradition|extradited]] to Australia and released on bail by a [[Sydney]] court on 4 May. On 6 July 2007, Wood was committed to stand trial for the murder of Byrne.

The first trial started on 21 July 2008 with Mark Tedeschi QC appearing for the [[Crown Prosecutor (Australia)|Crown]] and Winston Terracini QC defending Wood. On 6 August 2008, Justice Graham Barr declared a mistrial because of the alleged contact that a member of the jury had with [[2GB]] radio host Jason Morrison. The juror, who remained anonymous, claimed that some of the jurors were planning a secret night visit to the crime scene (the Gap) being organised by a particular juror who was a "bully" and who had "already decided that Wood was guilty." Justice Barr ruled "I had to discharge the jury ... because some jurors disobeyed my instructions and misconducted themselves."&lt;ref name="Fresh jury sworn in for Wood trial"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24238802-12377,00.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20121215173925/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24238802-12377,00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2012-12-15 |title=Fresh jury sworn in for Wood trial |work=The Australian |date= |accessdate= |author= }} &lt;/ref&gt;

The second trial commenced on 25 August 2008 and for the first time in New South Wales court history a panel of 15 jurors was sworn in instead of the usual 12 to provide some contingency.

==Trial evidence==

===Presentation of the Crown case===
Following the aborted first trial Tedeschi, as Crown Prosecutor, presented the Crown case over a nine-week period from 26 August until 24 October 2008. Over 70 witnesses were called and the jury heard hours of audio and video evidence including taped interviews with Rivkin and Wood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Jennifer |last=Cooke |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/wood-to-face-murder-trial-over-girlfriends-death/2007/07/06/1183351454046.html |title=Twelve years on, Wood to face murder trial over girlfriend's death |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=7 July 2007 |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Witnesses called by the prosecution included Pan, Richardson, Watson, Zaetta, Singleton, Fawcett, [[Bob Hagan (rugby league)|Bob Hagan]] and sports journalist Phil Rothfield. Tony Byrne, Peter Byrne, Dally-Watkins and her daughter Carol Clifford appeared. Doherty and Cochrane gave evidence via video link up from overseas. Police witnesses included Tracey Smit and Paul Griffiths (officers on scene), Sgt Mark Powderly, Sgt Neville Greatorex (who gave evidence on police procedures), Snr Const Lisa Camwell (who retrieved the body) and the first investigating officer of the case Sgt Craig Woods of Rose Bay who had first dismissed the death as suicide and who gave evidence that in the first weeks Tony Byrne too accepted the suicide verdict and was explicitly against the idea of an inquest. Another ex-policeman to appear was Byrne's former boyfriend Andrew Blanchette. At one stage Justice Barr counselled Blanchette that he ought consider taking legal advice before answering a particular question. Sensationally on his second day in the witness box, Blanchette admitted that early that morning he had phoned another witness – Melinda Medich, his girlfriend and a minor at the time of Byrne's death – before she was due to give evidence later that day. Blanchette was reported to police by Medich who had not heard from him for a number of years. Blanchette denied that he had been attempting to influence her evidence. 

===Location of the body===
Retired [[University of Sydney]] physicist Associate Professor [[Rod Cross]] spent two days in the witness box. Over a six-year period Cross had produced six reports on the case - with his initial findings being quite different to the later findings presented in the trial.&lt;ref name="smh.com.au"/&gt; Although formally qualified in the field of [[plasma physics]], Cross had experience working with biomechanists regarding sports research and had published and refereed many papers on biomechanics;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Publications |author=Cross, Rod |authorlink=Rod Cross |publisher=Physics Department, The University of Sydney |url=http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~cross/publications.html |year=2012 |accessdate=8 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; he was therefore proposed by police investigators as a forensic expert in fall dynamics. Between 1998 and 2004 Cross' reports all concluded that Byrne could have jumped to her death, as he was told that Byrne's body had been found at a distance of {{convert|9|m}} from the cliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stephen Luntz|title=Forensics, Fossils and Fruitbats: A Field Guide to Australian Scientists|year=2011|page=161|isbn=9780643097452|url=https://books.google.com.tr/books?id=U4QUeLNTQMMC&amp;lpg=PA161&amp;ots=LA-4qJipap&amp;dq=byrne%20murder%20cross&amp;pg=PA161#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, when he was recontacted by the police that the position of the body was in fact farther away (({{convert|11.8|m}}), he conducted experiments which informed his speculation that Byrne could not have jumped that far and must have been thrown.&lt;ref name=Chenoweth /&gt;{{rp|210 }}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.physics.usyd.edu.au/~cross/FORENSIC-PHYSICS/FALLING-FATALITIES.htm |title=Never let the science get in the way of a good story |author=Cross, Rod |date=April 2009 |format=transcript of evidence |publisher=Physics Department, The University of Sydney |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The required launch speed, from the top of the {{convert|29|m}} high cliff, was 4.5&amp;nbsp;m/s (see [[range of a projectile]]&lt;ref&gt;Assuming 0.5m takeoff distance and a horizontal throw, the minimum speed, conservatively assuming no air resistance, is 4.64m/s. [http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=solve+11.8-0.5%3Dx*cos(t)%2Fg*(x*sin(t)%2Bsqrt((x*sin(t))%5E2%2B2g*29)),+g%3D9.8,+t%3D0]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rod Cross|journal=J Forensic Sci|title=Fatal Falls from a Height: Two Case Studies|doi=10.1111/j.1556-4029.2005.00026.x|year=2006|volume=51|page=93}}&lt;/ref&gt;), and the available runup distance was only {{convert|4|m}} – although appeal submissions in 2011 called this into question. Cross tested eleven females from the [[New South Wales Police Academy]] and found that they could dive and land head first (in a swimming pool) at about 3.5&amp;nbsp;m/s after a {{convert|4|m}} runup. A strong male could throw a {{convert|61|kg}} female at 4.8&amp;nbsp;m/s after a runup of only {{convert|2|m}} or {{convert|3|m}}.

During the trial the Court was told of some uncertainty regarding the actual location where the body was found. Senior Constable Lisa Camwell, one of the officers who retrieved Byrne's body in 1995 gave evidence that she had in 1996 participated in a video re-enactment in which she indicated the body's location. She gave evidence that in 2004 she was contacted by an officer in charge of the murder investigation (Sergeant Powderly) and told that the position of Ms Byrne's body had become a significant issue. She was told that the body position she had indicated on the video now appeared to be incorrect. Media reports during the second trial suggested the location of the body was an essential component to the Crown case that Ms Byrne was not pushed nor jumped, but was forcefully thrown to her death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=24 February 2012 |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24318148-2702,00.html |work=The Australian |title=Officer could not recall location of Caroline Byrne's body |date=9 September 2008 |agency=AAP }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Suicide history===
The court heard that Caroline's mother Andrea Byrne had committed suicide in March 1991 after she became depressed following a breast enlargement operation that went wrong.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Wood trial: Caroline's dad still in denial that she suicided |date=29 August 2008 |work=ABC News |location=Australia |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2008/08/29/2349986.htm |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Terracini also read to the court a letter Tony Byrne had previously provided to police in which he claimed that Caroline had made an attempt on her own life via overdose in 1992. In court Tony Byrne denied that Caroline had on that occasion intended to kill herself and instead was making "a cry for help". At another stage of the cross examination, he claimed to suppose that had Caroline wanted to kill herself she would have copied her mother's method rather than jumping from a cliff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theage.com.au/national/trial-told-rivkin-lavished-toy-boy-20080829-45rd.html |title=Trial told Rivkin lavished 'toy boy' |author=Coopes, Amy |work=The Age |date=30 August 2008 |accessdate=24 February 2012 |location=Melbourne}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byrne's [[general practitioner|doctor]], author and television personality [[Cindy Pan]], gave evidence that she had seen Byrne for two years before her death and had specifically discussed Byrne's depression with her in the weeks leading up to her death. Dr. Pan told the court Byrne said she had felt depressed for about a month and the condition had worsened in the week leading up to their appointment on 5 June 1995. Pan said the model told her she could not put a finger on what she was unhappy about.

"I was trying to explore with her what she might be depressed about, but she was not really able to identify any one specific thing," Pan told the court. She said Byrne told her she "had the same thing three years ago" and had been put on medication, which had helped. Pan said Byrne denied having thoughts of self-harm and she referred her to a psychiatrist, obtaining an appointment for 4 pm on 7 June.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0,25197,24364986-5006784,00.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919073543/http://www.theaustralian.news.com.au/story/0%2C25197%2C24364986-5006784%2C00.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 September 2008 |work=The Australian |title=Cindy Pan evidence |date= |author= |accessdate= |df=dmy-all }} &lt;/ref&gt;

===Presentation of the defence===
One defence witness, Prof John Hilton, a forensic pathologist, was called during the Prosecution case, due to his later unavailability. Otherwise Terracini commenced the defence case on 27 October 2008 calling another physics expert Prof Marcus Pandy, a biomechancial engineer who conducted experiments on running and jumping speeds of two females. Only a handful of defence witnesses were called – two forensic pathologists, one psychiatrist, Prof Pandy, a stunt diver, and Wood's sister Jacqueline Schmidt – and the defence case concluded within a week.

With the trial drawing to a close, the jury made a number of requests of Justice Barr that included a visit the Gap for a third time; for a transcript of Doherty's evidence; and for video footage of Pandy's running experiments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/wood-jury-asks-for-gap-visit/2008/10/28/1224956039712.html |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |title=Wood jury asks for Gap visit |author=McClymont, Kate |accessdate=24 February 2012 |date=29 October 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Deliberation and verdict===
For the first time in New South Wales court history, a ballot was used to select the three jurors who would stand down so that twelve of the sitting fifteen would deliberate to a verdict. After five full days of deliberation on 21 November 2008 they found Wood guilty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/gordon-wood-guilty/2008/11/21/1226770692840.html |title=Gordon Wood guilty of murdering Caroline Byrne |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=21 November 2008 |author=McClymont, Kate |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/asiapcf/11/21/australia.murdered.model/index.html?iref=werecommend |title=Ex-boyfriend convicted of Australian model's murder |work=CNN |author=Williams, Hugh |date=21 November 2008 |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 3 December 2008 Wood was sentenced to a custodial sentence of 17 years, with a minimum time in prison of 13 years. Wood lodged an appeal to the conviction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/national/gordon-wood-launches-appeal-against-murder-conviction/story-e6frf7l6-1226023976188 |title=Gordon Wood launches appeal against murder conviction |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=Australia |date=18 March 2011 |author=Davies, Lisa |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Appeal==
Wood's appeal hearing commenced on 22 August 2011 in the [[New South Wales Court of Appeal|Criminal Court of Appeal]] before [[Chief Justice|Chief Judge]] at Common Law [[Peter McClellan]], Justice Megan Latham, and Justice Stephen Rothman. Wood's barrister Tim Game [[Senior Counsel|SC]] submitted that the jury's verdict was unreasonable and not supported by the evidence. His submission spoke of nine grounds for appeal. One was that the trial miscarried by reason of the prejudice occasioned by the Tedeschi's closing address. Others related to criticisms of Barr's directions to the jury.

Early media reporting of the appeal focused on Game's submission that the scientific evidence used to convict Wood and presented by Associate Professor Cross was flawed. A photograph was presented in the trial and purported to be taken in 1996 showing that scrub near the fenceline had limited Byrne's possible run-up to the jump, supporting an argument that she would have needed to have been thrown to achieve the horizontal distance from the cliff wall that her body travelled. The appeal judges heard and the Crown acknowledged that the photo was in fact taken in 2003 and that photo's quality meant that a shadow might have appeared to be scrub. The appeal judges heard that a 1996 colour photo which showed that there was no scrub limiting the run-up was available to the Crown during the trial but that the Crown had chosen to introduce the blurrier, non-contemporaneous, more ambiguous image.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-nsw/appeal-on-gap-murder-of-caroline/story-e6freuzi-1226120022875 |title=Appeal on Gap murder of Caroline Byrne |work=Daily Telegraph |location=Australia |date=23 August 2011 |author=Davies, Lisa |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Game's submission, consistent with so much of the trial evidence, concerned matters relating to the exact positioning of Byrne's body at the base of the rocks and the orientation of her legs and torso and leading to questions regarding the contended launch point and the assumptions and assertions made by Cross in his pre-trial studies and reports and his trial evidence. Day two of Game's submission focused on the police's changed view between 1996 and 2005 as to Byrne's landing spot and specifically trial evidence given by Sergeant Mark Powderly used to justify the reconstruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/police-officer-lied-for-gordon-wood-inquest-hears/story-e6freuy9-1226121493044 |title=Police officer lied for Gordon Wood, inquest hears |work=Daily Telegraph |location=Australia |date=23 August 2011 |accessdate=24 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Criminal Court of Appeal delivered their opinion on 24 February 2012 acquitting Wood of Byrne's murder and ordering his release from jail.&lt;ref name=acquittal /&gt; The appellate judges delivered a unanimous decision that there was insufficient evidence beyond reasonable doubt that Wood murdered Byrne and that the jury's verdict was not supported. They dismissed the Crown evidence as being critically flawed and ruled that the possibility of her suicide ought not have been excluded.&lt;ref name=acquittal /&gt;&lt;ref name="2012 NSWCCA 21"/&gt;

Justice McClennan described Cross' experiments as "unsophisticated" and in the summation of his decision said that he was not satisfied by either of the two motives presented by the Crown.&lt;ref name=acquittal /&gt; Regarding the motive submitted by Tedeschi that Byrne had information about Rivkin's business dealings that Wood was trying to hide, McClennan said "The exploitation of public rumour and the use of mere innuendo to compensate for inadequate evidence of motive is not consistent with the obligations of a prosecutor to press the Crown case "to its legitimate strength" by reliance upon credible evidence".&lt;ref name="2012 NSWCCA 21"/&gt;{{rp|para 305}}  McLennan was also troubled that the notion Byrne may have been unconscious when she left the cliff top was introduced by the Crown late in the case.&lt;ref name="2012 NSWCCA 21"/&gt;{{rp|para 277}} He described Tedeschi's suggestion, first made in his closing address and mentioned at no other time in evidence, that a "shot-put" action was used to despatch Byrne as "an invention of the prosecutor...for which there was absolutely no support in evidence".&lt;ref name=tedeschi&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/state-prosecutors-reasoning-in-wood-trial-dangerous-20120224-1ttq9.html |title=State prosecutor's reasoning in Wood trial 'dangerous' |work=Sydney Morning Herald |first1=Louise |last1=Hall |first2=Geesche |last2=Jacobsen |date=25 February 2012|accessdate=25 February 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; McClennan also expressed some doubt as the reliability of evidence concerning the claimed sightings of Wood and Byrne at Watson's Bay on 7 June 1995 noting that some of these witnesses had come forward years after the event and the initial investigations; he raised concerns that the Melbourne/Martin first identification of Wood and Byrne was based on a specific photos shown to them by Dally-Watkins rather than from being picked from a selection. Tedeschi was criticised by McClellan for presenting reasoning that was "dangerous" and "entirely without foundation". Tedeschi contributed to the alleged miscarriage with his "50 killer questions" which took an "impermissible course" in asking the jury to consider rhetorical questions dealing with matters that had not been presented with in evidence.&lt;ref name=tedeschi /&gt; McClennan ruled that he was not persuaded that Sgt Powderly's evidence regarding the changed landing position of the body was entirely reliable.&lt;ref name="2012 NSWCCA 21"/&gt;{{rp|para 317}}

Wood was freed from prison on 24 February 2012; having served three years two months in [[Goulburn Correctional Centre]], following an initial month in [[Parklea Correctional Centre|Parklea prison]]. Three weeks later the new New South Wales Director of Public Prosecutions, [[Lloyd Babb]] SC, issued a press release simply announcing that "the OPDD will not appeal the Court of Criminal Appeal's judgement in the matter of R v Gordon Wood . No further comment will be issued".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/gordon-wood-will-not-face-further-court-challenge-dpp-20120316-1vabv.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Gordon Wood will not face further court challenge: DPP}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was 24 hours after meeting Tony Byrne and attending the  Gap with him – a meeting which Byrne described as 'fruitful'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/sydney-nsw/caroline-byrnes-fathers-mission-to-dpp-fruitful/story-e6freuzi-1226300935173 |title= Tony still bitter |work=Daily Telegraph |location=Australia |date=18 March 2012 |accessdate=18 March 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wood left Australia after his release from prison and spent time in the United States and Britain. In 2014 he brought defamation actions against the Sydney radio stations 2GB and 2UE, Channel Seven Sydney, and The Daily Telegraph&lt;ref&gt; [http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/gordon-wood-to-settle-defamation-case-out-of-court-20150210-13agmy.html Wood defamation action against News settled SMH 10feb2015]&lt;/ref&gt;which were all settled out of court in his favour for undisclosed sums.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/nation/outofwork-wood-lives-off-trust-fund-controlled-by-his-sister/news-story/bd2acf32636a9183c8c081e7e031d053 Out of work Wood lives off trust fund - The Australian 28feb2017]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14083">The '''ethics of care''' (alternatively '''care ethics''' or '''EoC''') is a [[normative ethics|normative]] [[ethics|ethical theory]] that holds that moral action centers on interpersonal relationships and care or benevolence as a virtue. EoC is one of a cluster of normative ethical theories that were developed by [[feminists]] in the second half of the twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;“Care Ethics” Maureen Sander-Staudt,  The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, ISSN 2161-0002, http://www.iep.utm.edu/, 22/3/2016.&lt;/ref&gt; While [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] and [[deontology|deontological]] ethical theories emphasize generalizable standards and impartiality, ethics of care emphasize the importance of response to the individual. The distinction between the general and the individual is reflected in their different moral questions: "what is just?" versus "how to respond?".&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, Carol. "Moral Orientation and Moral Development." The Feminist Philosophy Reader. By Alison Bailey and Chris J. Cuomo. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2008. N. pag. 469 Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilligan criticizes the application of generalized standards as "morally problematic, since it breeds [[moral blindness]] or indifference."&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, Carol. "Moral Orientation and Moral Development." The Feminist Philosophy Reader. By
on Bailey and Chris J. Cuomo. Boston: McGraw-Hill, 2008. N. pag. 471 Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some beliefs of the theory are basic:
# Persons are understood to have varying degrees of dependence and interdependence on one another. 
# Individuals impacted by the consequences of one's choices deserve consideration in proportion to their vulnerability.
# Details determine how to safeguard and promote the interests of those involved.

==Historical background==
===Carol Gilligan and ''In a Different Voice''===
The founder of Ethics of Care (EoC) was [[Carol Gilligan]], an American ethicist and psychologist. Gilligan was a student of developmental psychologist [[Lawrence Kohlberg]]. Gilligan developed EoC in contrast to her mentor's theory of [[Kohlberg's stages of moral development|stages of moral development]]. She held that measuring progress by Kohlberg's model resulted in boys being found to be more morally mature than girls, and this held for adult men and women as well (although when education is controlled for there are no gender differences).&lt;ref&gt;Walker, L.J. (1991). "Sex differences in moral reasoning.” In W.M. Kurtines and J. L. Gewirtz (eds.) ''Handbook of moral behavior and development'': Vol, 2. Research. Hillsdale, NJ: Erlbaum.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilligan further argued that Kohlberg's model was not an objective scale of moral development. Gilligan consider it as a masculine perspective on morality, founded on [[justice]] and abstract [[Duty|duties]] or obligations. Dana Ward has stated, in a paper that appears never to have been formally published for critical peer review, that the scale is [[psychometrics|psychometrically]] sound.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, Dana (2000). "Still Hearing Voice: The Persistent Myth of Gendered Judgment," Keynote address presented at the VIIIth Biennial conference of the International Society for Justice Research, Rishon LeZion, Israel.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilligan's ''[[In a Different Voice]]'' offered the perspective that men and women have tendencies to view morality in different terms. Her theory claimed women tended to emphasize empathy and compassion over the notions of morality that are privileged in Kohlberg's scale.&lt;ref&gt;Gilligan, Carol. ''In A Different Voice'', Cambridge: Harvard University Press (1982)&lt;/ref&gt; 
Subsequent research suggests that the discrepancy in being oriented towards care-based or justice-based ethical approaches may be based on gender differences, or on differences in actual current life situations of the genders.&lt;ref&gt;Ford and Lowery (1986). "Gender Differences in Moral Reasoning: A Comparison of the Use of Justice and Care Orientations". ''Journal of Personality and Social Psychology''. 50(4), 777-783; Rothbart, Hanley and Albert (1986). "Gender Differences in Moral Reasoning." ''Sex Roles''. 15 (11&amp;12), 645-653; and Krebs, D.L., Vermeulen, S.C., Denton, K., and Carpendale, J. I. (1994). "Gender and perspective differences in moral judgment and moral orientation". ''Journal of Moral Education''. 23, 17-26.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Relationship to traditional ethical positions==
Care ethics contrasts with more well-known ethical models, such as [[consequentialism|consequentialist]] theories (e.g. [[utilitarianism]]) and deontological theories (e.g. [[Kantian ethics]]) in that it seeks to incorporate traditionally feminized virtues and values which, proponents of care ethics contend, are absent in such traditional models of ethics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-ethics/#CarEthTheDifVoi|title=Feminist Ethics|last=Tong|first=Rosemarie|last2=Williams|first2=Nancy|date=May 4, 2009|website=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=The Metaphysics Research Lab|access-date=January 6, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Care ethics as feminist ethics==
While some feminists have criticized care-based ethics for reinforcing traditional stereotypes of a "good woman"&lt;ref name=Bartky&gt;{{cite book | last = Bartky | first = Sandra Lee | author-link = Sandra Bartky | title = Femininity and domination: studies in the phenomenology of oppression | pages = 104–105 | publisher = Routledge | location = New York | year = 1990 | isbn = 9780415901864 }}&lt;/ref&gt; others have embraced parts of this paradigm under the theoretical concept of care-focused feminism.&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosmarie page 162-165"&gt;Tong, Rosmarie: Feminist Thought: A More Comprehensive Introduction, page 162-165. Westview Press, Charlotte, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

Care-focused feminism is a branch of feminist thought, informed primarily by ethics of care as developed by [[Carol Gilligan]] and [[Nel Noddings]].&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosmarie page 162-165"/&gt; This body of theory is critical of how caring is socially engendered, being assigned to women and consequently devalued.  “Care-focused feminists regard women’s capacity for care as a human strength”&lt;ref name="Tong, Rosmarie page 162-165"/&gt; which can and should be taught to and expected of men as well as women.  Noddings proposes that ethical caring has the potential to be a more concrete evaluative model of moral dilemma, than an ethic of justice.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Caring: A Feminine Approach to Ethics and Moral Education, page 3-4. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1984.&lt;/ref&gt;  Noddings’ care-focused feminism requires practical application of [[Nel Noddings#Nel Noddings' relational ethics|relational ethics]], predicated on an ethic of care.&lt;ref&gt;Noddings, Nel: Women and Evil, page 222. University of California Press, Berkeley, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ethics of care is also a basis for care-focused feminist theorizing on maternal ethics. These theories recognize caring as an ethically relevant issue.&lt;ref&gt;Held, Virginia.  Ethics of Care, page 64. Oxford University Press, Oxford, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; Critical of how society engenders caring labor, theorists [[Sara Ruddick]], [[Virginia Held]], and [[Eva Feder Kittay]] suggest caring should be performed and care givers valued in both public and private spheres.&lt;ref&gt;Kittay, Eva Feder:  Love’s Labor: Essays on Women, Equality and Dependency, page 20. Routledge, New York, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;   This proposed paradigm shift in ethics encourages the view that an ethic of caring be the social responsibility of both men and women.

[[Joan Tronto]] argues that the definition of the term "ethic of care" is ambiguous due in part to the lack of a central role it plays in moral theory.&lt;ref name="Tronto"&gt;{{citation | last = Tronto | first = Joan C. | author-link = Joan Tronto | contribution = An ethic of care | editor-last1 = Cudd | editor-first1 = Ann E. | editor-last2 = Andreasen | editor-first2 = Robin O. | editor-link1 = Ann Cudd | title = Feminist theory: a philosophical anthology | pages = 251–263 | publisher = Blackwell Publishing | location = Oxford, UK Malden, Massachusetts | year = 2005 | isbn = 9781405116619 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; She argues that considering moral philosophy is engaged with human goodness, then care would appear to assume a significant role in this type of philosophy.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; However, this is not the case and Tronto further stresses the association between care and "naturalness". The latter term refers to the socially and culturally constructed gender roles where care is mainly assumed to be the role of the woman.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; As such, care loses the power to take a central role in moral theory.

Tronto states there are four ethical elements of care:

#'''Attentiveness''' &lt;br/&gt;Attentiveness is crucial to the ethics of care because care requires a recognition of others' needs in order to respond to them.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; The question which arises is the distinction between ignorance and inattentiveness.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; Tronto poses this question as such, "But when is ignorance simply ignorance, and when is it inattentiveness"?&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt;
#'''Responsibility''' &lt;br/&gt;In order to care, we must take it upon ourselves, thus responsibility.  The problem associated with this second ethical element of responsibility is the question of obligation.  Obligation is often, if not already, tied to pre-established societal and cultural norms and roles.  Tronto makes the effort to differentiate the terms "responsibility" and "obligation" with regards to the ethic of care.  Responsibility is ambiguous, whereas obligation refers to situations where action or reaction is due, such as the case of a legal contract.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; This ambiguity allows for ebb and flow in and between class structures and gender roles, and to other socially constructed roles that would bind responsibility to those only befitting of those roles.
#'''Competence''' &lt;br/&gt;To provide care also means competency.  One cannot simply acknowledge the need to care, accept the responsibility, but not follow through with enough adequacy - as such action would result in the need of care not being met.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt;
#'''Responsiveness''' &lt;br/&gt;This refers to the "responsiveness of the care receiver to the care".&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; Tronto states, "Responsiveness signals an important moral problem within care: by its nature, care is concerned with conditions of vulnerability and inequality".&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; She further argues responsiveness does not equal reciprocity.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt; Rather, it is another method to understand vulnerability and inequality by understanding what has been expressed by those in the vulnerable position, as opposed to re-imagining oneself in a similar situation.&lt;ref name="Tronto"/&gt;

'''Evolve 4.0''' is an open source, freeware [[artificial life]] simulator created by Ken Stauffer.  In its simulated 2D [[cellular automata]], each cell can behave independently as a [[unicellular]] organism or potentially as one cell in a [[multicellular]] [[digital organism]], growing, moving, eating, reproducing, and eventually even evolving over time.

Each cell runs its own program written in a custom [[programming language]] called KFORTH (portmanteau of "Ken's Forth"), based on the [[Forth programming language]].

Stauffer used the Evolve 4.0 environment in his "One Year of ALife" project, with the goal of running a simulation for an entire year. He finished the project on day 298.{{cn|date=December 2012}}

'''Extropianism''', also referred to as the philosophy of ''Extropy'', is an "evolving framework of values and standards for continuously improving the [[human condition]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document |url= http://www.extropy.org/principles.htm |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131015142449/http://extropy.org/principles.htm|archivedate= 2013-10-15|title= Principles of Extropy (Version 3.11) : An evolving framework of values and standards for continuously improving the human condition |year=2003 |author= Max More |publisher= Extropy Institute |postscript=&lt;!-- Bot inserted parameter.

Extropians believe that advances in science and technology will some day let people live indefinitely. An extropian may wish to contribute to this goal, e.g. by doing research and development or by volunteering to test new technology.

Originated by a set of principles developed by the philosopher [[Max More]], ''The Principles of Extropy'',&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; extropian thinking places strong emphasis on [[rational thinking]] and on practical [[optimism]]. According to More, these principles "do not specify particular beliefs, technologies, or policies". Extropians share an optimistic view of the [[future]], expecting considerable advances in computational power, [[life extension]], [[nanotechnology]] and the like.  Many{{quantify|date=February 2016}} extropians foresee the eventual realization of [[indefinite lifespan]]s, and the recovery, thanks to future advances in biomedical technology or [[mind uploading]], of those whose bodies/brains have been preserved by means of [[cryonics]].{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

==Extropy==

The term 'extropy', as an antonym to '[[entropy]]' was used in a 1967 academic volume discussing [[cryogenics]]&lt;ref&gt;''Cryogenics'', IPC Science and Technology Press, vol. 7, pg. 225 (1967)&lt;/ref&gt; and in a 1978 academic volume of [[cybernetics]].&lt;ref&gt;Proceedings of the Fourth International Congress of Cybernetics &amp; Systems: "Current Topics in Cybernetics and Systems", pg. 258 (1978)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Diane Duane]] was the first to use the term "extropy" to signify a potential transhuman destiny for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;Duane, Diane. "The Wounded Sky" (1983)&lt;/ref&gt; Also published in 1983 was [[J. Neil Schulman]]'s [[Prometheus Award]] winning novel, [[The Rainbow Cadenza]] which used the term "extropic" as a type of scale in visual music.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Schulman |first1=J. Neil |title=The Rainbow Cadenza |publisher=Pulpless.Com |isbn=978-1584451235 |page=211 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jNSbGhp9PqsC&amp;pg=PA211&amp;dq=extropic#v=onepage&amp;q=extropic&amp;f=false |accessdate=13 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 'Extropy' as coined by Tom Bell (T.O. Morrow) and defined by [[Max More]] in 1988, is "the extent of a living or organizational system's [[intelligence (trait)|intelligence]], functional order, vitality, [[energy]], [[life]], [[experience]], and capacity and drive for improvement and growth."{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} Extropy is not a rigorously defined technical term in philosophy or science; in a [[metaphor]]ical sense, it simply expresses the opposite of [[Information entropy|entropy]].

==The Extropy Institute==
In 1986 More joined [[Alcor Life Extension Foundation|Alcor]], a [[Cryonics]] company, and helped establish (along with Michael Price, Garret Smyth and Luigi Warren) the first European cryonics organization, Mizar Limited (later Alcor UK).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="The Alcor Team"|url=http://www.alcor.org/AboutAlcor/meetalcorstaff.html|accessdate=26 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1987, More moved to Los Angeles from [[Oxford University]] in England to work on his Ph.D. in philosophy at the [[University of Southern California]].

In 1988, ''Extropy: The Journal of Transhumanist Thought'' was first published. (For the first few issues, it was "Extropy: Vaccine for Future Shock".) This brought together thinkers with interests in [[artificial intelligence]], [[nanotechnology]], [[genetic engineering]], [[life extension]], [[mind transfer|mind uploading]], [[idea futures]], [[robotics]], [[space exploration]], [[memetics]], and the politics and economics of transhumanism. Alternative media organizations soon began reviewing the magazine, and it attracted interest from like-minded thinkers.  Later, More and Bell co-founded the Extropy Institute, a [[Non-profit organization|non-profit]] [[501(c)(3)]] educational organization.  "ExI" was formed as a transhumanist networking and information center to use current scientific understanding along with critical and creative thinking to define a small set of principles or values that could help make sense of new capabilities opening up to humanity.

The Extropy Institute's email list was launched in 1991 (and, as of April 2015, continues to exist as "Extropy-Chat"), and in 1992 the institute began producing the first conferences on transhumanism.{{cn|date=July 2017}} Affiliate members throughout the world began organizing their own transhumanist groups. Extro Conferences, meetings, parties, on-line debates, and documentaries continue to spread transhumanism to the public.

In 2006, the board of directors of the Extropy Institute made a decision to close the organisation, stating that its mission was "essentially completed."&lt;ref name="Extropy Institute 2006"&gt;{{cite journal| author = [[Extropy Institute]]| title = Next Steps|year=2006 | url = http://www.extropy.org/future.htm| accessdate=2006-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extropism==

'''Extropism''' is a modern derivation of the [[transhumanism|transhumanist]] philosophy of Extropianism. It follows the same tradition - hence the similarity in naming - but has been revised to better suit the perceived paradigms of the 21st century. As introduced in ''The Extropist Manifesto'',&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[http://extropism.tumblr.com/post/393563122/the-extropist-manifesto The Extropist Manifesto]. ''The Extropist Examiner'' (blog).&lt;/ref&gt; it promotes an [[optimism|optimistic]] [[futurist]]ic philosophy that can be summed up in the following five phrases, which [[Backronym|spell out]] the word "EXTROPISM":

*Endless eXtension
*Transcending Restriction
*Overcoming Property
*Intelligence
*Smart Machines

Extropists desire to prolong their life span to a near-[[physical immortality|immortal]] state and exist in a world where [[artificial intelligence]] and [[robotics]] have made work irrelevant. As in utilitarianism, the purpose of one's life should be to increase the overall [[happiness]] of all creatures on Earth through [[cooperation]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''The Extropist Manifesto'' was written by web entrepreneur [[Breki Tomasson]] and writer [[Hank Pellissier]] - both of whom have had a long transhuman interest - in January, 2010.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It details the ways in which Extropism has evolved away from Extropianism, while continuing to building upon its original tenets. For example, it moves away from the original Extropian Principles&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.maxmore.com/extprn3.htm|title=The Extropian Principles (Version 3.0) : A Transhumanist Declaration|first=Max|date=|year=1998|website=|publisher=Extropy Institute|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100114100426/http://www.maxmore.com/extprn3.htm|archive-date=2010-01-14|dead-url=yes|access-date=|author=More|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by placing a significant focus on the need to abolish and/or restrict the current use of [[surveillance]], [[copyright]] and [[patent]] laws.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Death in battle==

On 14 October 1758, the Austrians, commanded by Daun, surprised the Prussians with a pre-dawn assault on the sleeping camp.  [[James Francis Edward Keith|James Keith]], Frederick's friend and an able general, had organized a defense of the village while Frederick could withdraw from Hochkirch.  This successful action initially repulsed the Austrian advance, giving Frederick hope that the situation could be won.  Even after Keith himself was shot and killed, Frederick still thought the battle could be retrieved and returned to the rear echelons to take command.  Finding his infantry milling about in the village after Keith was killed, Frederick ordered the infantry to advance, sending reinforcements commanded by his brother-in-law with them.  As Francis approached the village, Austrian cannon-fire sheared his head off his shoulders. His troops, demoralized by this sight, faltered.&lt;ref name=Redman&gt;Herbert J.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6914">[[File:Giuliano e Pisciotta.jpg|thumb|right|Gaspare Pisciotta (left) and [[Salvatore Giuliano]]]]
'''Gaspare Pisciotta''' (Montelepre, March 5, 1924&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; Palermo, February 9, 1954) was a companion and first cousin of the [[Sicily|Sicilian]] [[bandit]] [[Salvatore Giuliano]], and considered to be the co-leader of his [[outlaw]] band.
He is also the [[Judas Iscariot|Judas]] in Giuliano's legend as he betrayed Giuliano and killed him.

== Origins ==

Gaspare Pisciotta, nicknamed '''Aspanu''' by friends, was born in [[Montelepre]] in Western [[Sicily]] in 1924. While Giuliano remained in Montelepre during the war, Pisciotta joined the army and was captured fighting against the Germans. He was released in 1945 and returned to Sicily, joining Giuliano’s separatist campaign and thus being one of the founding members of his band.

== Trial ==

Shortly after Giuliano's death on July 5, 1950, Pisciotta was captured and brought to trial for his crimes as a bandit. During the trial for the [[Portella della Ginestra massacre]] he made the startling revelation that it had been he who assassinated Giuliano in his sleep, a statement which contradicted the police account that Giuliano had been shot by [[Carabinieri]] captain [[Antonio Perenze]] in a gunfight in [[Castelvetrano]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,814775,00.html Executioner], Time, April 30, 1951&lt;/ref&gt; He claimed to have killed Giuliano on the instruction of [[Mario Scelba]], then Minister of the Interior, and to have had an arrangement with Colonel [[Ugo Luca]], the head of the anti-bandit force in Sicily, to collaborate on the condition that he should not be charged and that Luca would intervene in his favour if he were caught.

At the trial, Pisciotta said: "''Those who have made promises to us are called [[Bernardo Mattarella]], [[Prince Alliata]], the monarchist MP Marchesano and also Signor [[Mario Scelba|Scelba]], Minister for Home Affairs ... it was Marchesano, Prince Alliata and Bernardo Mattarella who ordered the massacre of Portella di Ginestra. Before the massacre they met Giuliano...''" However the MPs Mattarella, Alliata and Marchesano were declared innocent by the Court of Appeal of Palermo, at a trial which dealt with their alleged role in the event.&lt;ref&gt;Servadio, ''Mafioso'', p. 128-29&lt;/ref&gt; During his trial Pisciotta could not account for Giuliano’s documents in which he named the high-ranking government officials and [[Sicilian Mafia|mafiosi]] involved with Giuliano’s band.

Pisciotta was sentenced to life in imprisonment and forced labour; most of the other 70 bandits met the same fate. Others were at large, but one by one they all disappeared. When Pisciotta realized that he had been abandoned by all and was condemned, he declared that he was going to tell the whole truth, in particular who signed the letter which had been brought to Giuliano on April 27, 1947, which demanded the massacre at Portella delle Ginistra in exchange for liberty for us all and which Giuliano had destroyed immediately.&lt;ref name=ser135&gt;Servadio, ''Mafioso'', p. 135-37&lt;/ref&gt;

Giuliano's mother reportedly had suspected Pisciotta as a potential traitor before her son's death, although Giuliano had tried to convince her of his trust in his lieutenant in a letter: ''"...we respect each other as brothers' what he is I am, and what I am he is.''" If Gaspare Pisciotta’s testimony was true, Giuliano suspected nothing until the time of his death.

== Imprisonment and death ==

In prison, Pisciotta made it clear that he believed his life was in danger. He was reported to have said "''One of these days, they will kill me,''" and he refused to share a cell with anyone but his father, also serving a life sentence for involvement in Giuliano’s band. Gaspare even reportedly kept a tame sparrow to test his food for poison, and ate nothing but what his mother brought for him from home. However, on the morning of February 9, 1954, Gaspare took a vitamin preparation which he stirred into his coffee and drank. He almost immediately became violently ill, and despite being rushed to the prison infirmary, he was dead within forty minutes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://jcgi.pathfinder.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,860461,00.html The Big Mouth], Time Magazine, February 22, 1954&lt;/ref&gt; The cause of death, as revealed by the autopsy, was the ingestion of 20&amp;nbsp;mg of [[strychnine]].

Both the government and [[the Mafia]] were suggested as being behind the murder of Pisciotta, but no-one was ever brought to trial. Gaspare's mother Rosalia wrote a letter to the press on March 18, 1954, denouncing the governmental [[Political corruption|corruption]] and possible Mafia involvement in her son's death, stating: "''Yes, it is true that my son Gaspare will never open his mouth again, and already many people think they are safe; but who knows&amp;nbsp;– perhaps other things may speak.''" Gaspare Pisciotta had supposedly written an [[autobiography]] in prison, to which his mother may have been referring, and which his brother Pietro tried to sell. However, this document went missing and its contents remain unknown.

== Dramatisations ==
[[File:Scene from the opera Salvatore Giuliano by Lorenzo Ferrero.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Pisciotta (left) in a scene from the opera ''Salvatore Giuliano'', Staatstheater Kassel, 1996.]]
In [[Francesco Rosi]]'s 1961 film, ''[[Salvatore Giuliano (film)|Salvatore Giuliano]]'', Pisciotta was played by [[Frank Wolff (actor)|Frank Wolff]]. [[Mario Puzo]]'s 1984 novel ''[[The Sicilian]]'' is a dramatized version of Giuliano and Pisciotta's story, set in the universe of ''[[The Godfather (novel)|The Godfather]]''. The book was made into a film in 1987, directed by [[Michael Cimino]], starring [[Christopher Lambert]] as Giuliano, and [[John Turturro]] as Pisciotta. 

Gaspare Pisciotta is also a character in the [[opera]] ''[[Salvatore Giuliano (opera)|Salvatore Giuliano]]'', written by the Italian composer [[Lorenzo Ferrero]] in 1985.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2275">'''George Hamilton-Gordon, 6th Earl of Aberdeen''' (10 December 1841 – 27 January 1870), styled '''Lord Haddo''' from 1860 to 1864, was a [[Peerage of Scotland|Scottish peer]] and sailor.

Hamilton-Gordon settled for a time in [[Richmond, Maine]], where he took jobs cutting ice and clerking at a store (where it is reported he lost his temper at being fired and told his employer that he "could buy and sell him many times over" before storming out).&lt;ref&gt;"Nobleman in Disguise, or 'When the Earl of Aberdeen made Richmond his home'", Richmond Bee&lt;/ref&gt;  As a sailor, he often shipped out of Richmond, and at one time captained a small ship called the Walton (or Waltham).  His profession was not entirely a mystery to his family at home, as he wrote letters to his mother and brother on occasion.&lt;ref&gt;The Gordons of Methlic &amp; Haddo, http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/families/gordons_methlic.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  Travelling from Boston to [[Melbourne]] on the ''Hera'' in 1870, Lord Aberdeen was washed overboard during a violent storm and drowned.  It was reported he was swept away when attempting to take down the boom sail, which he could have ordered another man to do.&lt;ref&gt;The Richmond Bee&lt;/ref&gt;  His younger brother had been killed in a [[rifle]] accident two years earlier, so Aberdeen was succeeded by his next younger brother, [[John Hamilton-Gordon, 1st Marquess of Aberdeen and Temair|John]].

'''George VI''' (Albert Frederick Arthur George; 14 December 1895&amp;nbsp;– 6 February 1952) was [[King of the United Kingdom]] and the [[Dominion]]s of the [[British Commonwealth]] from 11 December 1936 until his death in 1952. He was the last [[Emperor of India]] and the first [[Head of the Commonwealth]].

Known publicly as Albert until his accession, and "Bertie" among his family and close friends, George VI was born in the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]], and was named after his great-grandfather [[Albert, Prince Consort]]. As the second son of [[King George V]], he was not expected to inherit the throne and spent his early life in the shadow of his elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]]. He attended naval college as a teenager, and served in the [[Royal Navy]] and [[Royal Air Force]] during the [[First World War]]. In 1920, he was made [[Duke of York]]. He married [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]] in 1923 and they had two daughters, [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]]. In the mid-1920s, he had [[speech therapy]] for a [[Stuttering|stammer]], which he never fully overcame.

George's elder brother ascended the throne as Edward VIII upon the death of their father in 1936. However, later that year Edward revealed his desire to marry divorced American socialite [[Wallis Simpson]]. British prime minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] advised Edward that for political and religious reasons he could not marry a divorced woman and remain king. [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|Edward abdicated to marry Simpson]], and George ascended the throne as the third monarch of the [[House of Windsor]].

During George's reign, the break-up of the [[British Empire]] and its transition into the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] accelerated. The parliament of the [[Irish Free State]] [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed]] direct mention of the monarch from [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|the country's constitution]] on the day of his accession. The following year, a [[Constitution of Ireland|new Irish constitution]] changed the name of the state to Ireland and established the office of [[President of Ireland|President]]. From 1939, the Empire and Commonwealth&amp;nbsp;– except Ireland&amp;nbsp;– was at [[World War II|war]] with [[Nazi Germany]]. War with [[Kingdom of Italy (1861–1946)|Italy]] and [[Empire of Japan|Japan]] followed in 1940 and 1941, respectively. Though [[Allies of World War II|Britain and its allies]] were ultimately victorious in 1945, the United States and the [[Soviet Union]] rose as pre-eminent [[superpower|world powers]] and the British Empire declined. After the [[Indian Independence Act 1947|independence of India and Pakistan]] in 1947, George remained king of both countries, but relinquished the title of ''Emperor of India'' in June 1948. Ireland [[Republic of Ireland Act 1948|formally declared itself a republic]] and left the Commonwealth in 1949, and India became a republic within the Commonwealth the following year. George adopted the new title of Head of the Commonwealth. He was beset by smoking-related health problems in the later years of his reign. He was succeeded by his elder daughter, [[Elizabeth II]].

==Early life==
[[File:Edward VII UK and successors.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Four kings: [[Edward VII]] (far right), his son George, Prince of Wales, later [[George V]] (far left), and grandsons Edward, later [[Edward VIII]] (rear), and Albert, later George VI (foreground), c. 1908]]

George was born at [[York Cottage]], on the [[Sandringham House|Sandringham Estate]] in Norfolk, during the reign of his great-grandmother [[Queen Victoria]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 90; Weir, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; His father was Prince George, Duke of York (later [[King George V]]), the second and eldest-surviving son of the Prince and Princess of Wales (later [[King Edward VII]] and [[Queen Alexandra]]). His mother was the Duchess of York (later [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]), the eldest child and only daughter of the [[Francis, Duke of Teck|Duke]] and [[Princess Mary Adelaide of Cambridge|Duchess of Teck]].&lt;ref&gt;Weir, pp. 322–323, 329&lt;/ref&gt;

His birthday, 14 December 1895, was the 34th anniversary of the death of his great-grandfather, [[Albert, Prince Consort]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 3; Rhodes James, p. 90; Townsend, p. 15; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Uncertain of how the Prince Consort's widow, Queen Victoria, would take the news of the birth, the Prince of Wales wrote to the Duke of York that the Queen had been "rather distressed". Two days later, he wrote again: "I really think it would gratify her if you yourself proposed the name ''Albert'' to her".&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 4–5; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Victoria was mollified by the proposal to name the new baby Albert, and wrote to the Duchess of York: "I am all impatience to see the ''new'' one, born on such a sad day but rather more dear to me, especially as he will be called by that dear name which is a byword for all that is great and good".&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 7–8&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, he was [[baptism|baptised]] "Albert Frederick Arthur George" at [[St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham|St. Mary Magdalene's Church]] near Sandringham three months later.{{efn|His godparents were: [[Queen Victoria]] (his great-grandmother, for whom his grandmother the [[Alexandra of Denmark|Princess of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Frederick William, Grand Duke of Mecklenburg|Grand Duke]] and [[Princess Augusta of Cambridge|Grand Duchess]] of Mecklenburg (his maternal great-aunt and great-uncle, for whom his grandfather the [[Francis, Duke of Teck|Duke of Teck]] and his paternal aunt [[Maud of Wales|Princess Maud of Wales]] stood proxy); [[Empress Frederick]] (his paternal great-aunt, for whom his paternal aunt [[Princess Victoria of the United Kingdom|Princess Victoria of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Frederick VIII of Denmark|Crown Prince of Denmark]] (his great-uncle, for whom his grandfather the [[Edward VII of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]] stood proxy); the [[Prince Arthur, Duke of Connaught and Strathearn|Duke of Connaught]] (his great-uncle); the [[Louise, Princess Royal and Duchess of Fife|Duchess of Fife]] (his paternal aunt); and [[Adolphus Cambridge, 1st Marquess of Cambridge|Prince Adolphus of Teck]] (his maternal uncle).&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', Tuesday 18 February 1896, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;}} Within the family, he was known informally as "Bertie".&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 6; Rhodes James, p. 90; Townsend, p. 15; Windsor, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandmother, the Duchess of Teck, did not like the first name the baby had been given, and she wrote prophetically that she hoped the last name "may supplant the less favoured one".&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; Albert was fourth in line to the throne at birth, after his grandfather, father and elder brother, [[Edward VIII|Edward]].

He often suffered from ill health and was described as "easily frightened and somewhat prone to tears".&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; His parents were generally removed from their children's day-to-day upbringing, as was the norm in aristocratic families of that era. He had a [[stutter|stammer]] that lasted for many years. Although naturally [[Left-handedness|left-handed]], he was forced to write with his right hand, as was common practice at the time. He suffered from chronic stomach problems as well as [[genu valgum|knock knees]], for which he was forced to wear painful corrective splints.&lt;ref name="matthew"&gt;{{citation|first=H. C. G.|last=Matthew|authorlink=Colin Matthew|title=George VI (1895–1952)|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Queen Victoria died on 22 January 1901, and the Prince of Wales succeeded her as King Edward VII. Prince Albert moved up to third in line to the throne, after his father and elder brother.

==Military career and education==
From 1909, Albert attended the [[Royal Naval College, Osborne]], as a naval [[cadet]]. In 1911 he came bottom of the class in the final examination, but despite this he progressed to the [[Britannia Royal Naval College|Royal Naval College, Dartmouth]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 41–45; Judd, pp. 21–24; Rhodes James, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; When his grandfather, Edward VII, died in 1910, Albert's father became King George V. Edward became Prince of Wales, with Albert second in line to the throne.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert spent the first six months of 1913 on the training ship {{HMS|Cumberland|1902|6}} in the [[West Indies]] and on the east coast of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 26&lt;/ref&gt; He was rated as a [[midshipman]] aboard {{HMS|Collingwood|1908|6}} on 15 September 1913, and spent three months in the [[Mediterranean]]. His fellow officers gave him the nickname "Mr. Johnson".&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; The First World War broke out a year after his commission. He was [[mentioned in despatches]] for his action as a turret officer aboard ''Collingwood'' in the [[Battle of Jutland]] (31 May – 1 June 1916), an indecisive engagement with the [[German Empire|German]] [[Imperial German Navy|navy]] that was the largest naval action of the war. He did not see further combat, largely because of ill health caused by a [[peptic ulcer|duodenal ulcer]], for which he had an operation in November 1917.&lt;ref name=Bradford55&gt;Bradford, pp. 55–76&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Prince Albert in RAF uniform.png|thumb|upright|Albert at an RAF dinner in 1919]]
In February 1918 he was appointed Officer in Charge of Boys at the [[Royal Naval Air Service]]'s training establishment at [[RAF Cranwell|Cranwell]].&lt;ref name=Bradford72&gt;Bradford, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; With the establishment of the [[Royal Air Force]] two months later and the reassignment of Cranwell from [[Admiralty]] to [[Air Ministry]] responsibility, Albert transferred from the Royal Navy to the Royal Air Force.&lt;ref name=Bradford72/&gt; He served as Officer Commanding Number 4 Squadron of the Boys' Wing at Cranwell until August 1918,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt; before reporting to the RAF's Cadet School at [[St Leonards-on-Sea]]. He completed a fortnight's training and took command of a squadron on the Cadet Wing.&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; He was the first member of the British royal family to be certified as a fully qualified pilot.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 45; Rhodes James, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert wanted to serve on the Continent while the war was still in progress and welcomed a posting to [[Hugh Trenchard, 1st Viscount Trenchard|General Trenchard's]] staff in France. On 23 October, he flew across the Channel to [[Autigny, Seine-Maritime|Autigny]].&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; For the closing weeks of the war, he served on the staff of the RAF's [[Independent Air Force]] at its headquarters in [[Nancy, France]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Boyle |first= Andrew |authorlink= Andrew Boyle |title= Trenchard Man of Vision |year= 1962 |publisher= Collins |location= St. James's Place London |page= 360|chapter= Chapter 13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following the disbanding of the Independent Air Force in November 1918 he remained on the Continent for two months as an RAF staff officer until posted back to Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; He accompanied the Belgian monarch [[Albert I of Belgium|King Albert I]] on his triumphal re-entry into Brussels on 22 November. Prince Albert qualified as an RAF pilot on 31 July 1919 and was promoted to [[squadron leader]] the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Heathcote |first= Tony |date= 2012 |title= The British Field Marshals: 1736–1997: A Biographical Dictionary |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=KAkkUN7s4TIC&amp;pg=PT226#v=onepage |location= |publisher= Casemate Publisher |page= |isbn= 978-1783461417}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1919, Albert went up to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]], where he studied history, economics and civics for a year,&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 47; Wheeler-Bennett, pp. 128–131&lt;/ref&gt; with the historian [[Reginald Vere Laurence|R. V. Laurence]] as his "official mentor".&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; On 4 June 1920 his father created him [[Duke of York]], [[Earl of Inverness]] and [[Baron Killarney]].&lt;ref&gt;Weir, p. 329&lt;/ref&gt; He began to take on more royal duties. He represented his father, and toured coal mines, factories, and railyards. Through such visits he acquired the nickname of the "Industrial Prince".&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1942'', p. 280; Judd, p. 72; Townsend, p. 59&lt;/ref&gt; His stammer, and his embarrassment over it, together with his tendency to shyness, caused him to appear much less impressive than his older brother, Edward. However, he was physically active and enjoyed playing tennis. He played at [[The Championships, Wimbledon|Wimbledon]] in the Men's [[Doubles (tennis)|Doubles]] with [[Louis Greig]] in 1926, losing in the first round.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; He developed an interest in working conditions, and was President of the [[The Work Foundation|Industrial Welfare Society]]. His series of annual summer camps for boys between 1921 and 1939 brought together boys from different social backgrounds.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 77–86; Rhodes James, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt;

==Marriage==
{{see also|Wedding of Prince Albert, Duke of York, and Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon}}

In a time when royalty were expected to marry fellow royalty, it was unusual that Albert had a great deal of freedom in choosing a prospective wife. An infatuation with the already-married Australian socialite [[Sheila Chisholm|Sheila, Lady Loughborough]], came to an end in April 1920 when the King, with the promise of the dukedom of York, persuaded Albert to stop seeing her.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/books/457107/Sheila-The-Australian-Ingenue-Who-Bewitched-British-Society-review| last=Henderson| first=Gerard| title=Sheila: The Australian Ingenue Who Bewitched British Society – review| date=31 January 2014| newspaper=Daily Express| accessdate=15 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/02/28/sheila-who-captured-londons-heart| author=Australian Associated Press| title=A Sheila who captured London's heart| date=28 February 2014| publisher=Special Broadcasting Service| accessdate=14 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; That year, he met for the first time since childhood [[Lady Elizabeth Bowes-Lyon]], the youngest daughter of the [[Claude Bowes-Lyon, 14th Earl of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Earl]] and [[Cecilia Bowes-Lyon, Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne|Countess of Strathmore and Kinghorne]]. He became determined to marry her.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, pp. 94–96; Vickers, pp. 31, 44&lt;/ref&gt; She rejected his proposal twice, in 1921 and 1922, reportedly because she was reluctant to make the sacrifices necessary to become a member of the royal family.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 106&lt;/ref&gt; In the words of Lady Elizabeth's mother, Albert would be "made or marred" by his choice of wife. After a protracted courtship, Elizabeth agreed to marry him.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 77; Judd, pp. 57–59&lt;/ref&gt;

They were married on 26 April 1923 in [[Westminster Abbey]]. Albert's marriage to someone not of royal birth was considered a modernising gesture.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Roberts |first=Andrew |editor=Antonia Fraser |title=The House of Windsor|publisher=Cassell &amp; Co. |location=London |year=2000 |isbn=978-0-304-35406-1 |pages=57–58|editorlink=Antonia Fraser}}&lt;/ref&gt; The newly formed [[British Broadcasting Company]] wished to record and broadcast the event on radio, but the Abbey [[Chapter (religion)|Chapter]] vetoed the idea (although the [[List of Deans of Westminster|Dean]], [[Herbert Edward Ryle]], was in favour).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Reith |first=John |authorlink=John Reith, 1st Baron Reith |title=Into the Wind |publisher=Hodder and Stoughton |location=London |year=1949 |page=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:StateLibQld 1 110084 Duke and Duchess of York at Eagle Farm Racecourse, Brisbane, 1927.jpg|thumb|The Duke and Duchess (centre, reading programmes) at [[Eagle Farm Racecourse]], [[Brisbane]], 1927]]

From December 1924 to April 1925, the Duke and Duchess toured [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]], [[Uganda Protectorate|Uganda]], and the [[Anglo-Egyptian Sudan|Sudan]], travelling via the [[Suez Canal]] and [[Aden]]. During the trip, they both went [[big game hunting]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 89–93&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of his stammer, Albert dreaded public speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; After his closing speech at the [[British Empire Exhibition]] at [[Wembley]] on 31 October 1925, one which was an ordeal for both him and his listeners,&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 93–97; Rhodes James, p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; he began to see [[Lionel Logue]], an Australian-born speech therapist. The Duke and Logue practised breathing exercises, and the Duchess rehearsed with him patiently.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 98; Rhodes James, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, he was able to speak with less hesitation.&lt;ref&gt;''Current Biography 1942'', pp. 294–295; Judd, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; With his delivery improved, the Duke opened the new [[Old Parliament House, Canberra|Parliament House]] in [[Canberra]], Australia, during a tour of the empire in 1927.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 106; Rhodes James, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; His journey by sea to Australia, New Zealand and Fiji took him via Jamaica, where Albert played doubles tennis partnered with a black man, Bertrand Clark, which was unusual at the time and taken locally as a display of equality between races.&lt;ref&gt;Shawcross, p. 273&lt;/ref&gt;

The Duke and Duchess of York had two children: [[Elizabeth II|Elizabeth]] (called "Lilibet" by the family) who was born in 1926, and [[Princess Margaret, Countess of Snowdon|Margaret]] who was born in 1930. The Duke and Duchess and their two daughters lived a relatively sheltered life at their London residence, 145 [[Piccadilly]]. They were a close and loving family.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 111, 225, 231&lt;/ref&gt; One of the few stirs arose when the [[Canadian Prime Minister]], [[R. B. Bennett]], considered the Duke for [[Governor General of Canada]] in 1931&amp;nbsp;– a proposal that King George V rejected on the advice of the [[Secretary of State for Dominion Affairs]], [[J. H. Thomas]].&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reluctant king==
{{Main|Edward VIII abdication crisis}}

King George V had severe reservations about Prince Edward, saying "After I am dead, the boy will ruin himself in twelve months" and "I pray God that my eldest son will never marry and that nothing will come between Bertie and Lilibet and the throne."&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 199&lt;/ref&gt; On 20 January 1936, George V died and Edward ascended the throne as King Edward VIII. In the [[Vigil of the Princes]], Prince Albert and his three brothers took a shift standing guard over their father's body as it [[Lying in state|lay in state]], in a closed casket, in [[Palace of Westminster#Westminster Hall|Westminster Hall]].

As Edward was unmarried and had no children, Albert was the [[heir presumptive]] to the throne. Less than a year later, on 11 December 1936, Edward [[Edward VIII abdication crisis|abdicated]] in order to marry his mistress, [[Wallis Simpson]], who was divorced from her first husband and divorcing her second. Edward had been advised by British prime minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] that he could not remain king and marry a divorced woman with two living ex-husbands. Edward chose abdication in preference to abandoning his marriage plans. Thus Albert became king, a position he was reluctant to accept.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 140&lt;/ref&gt; The day before the abdication, he went to London to see his mother, [[Mary of Teck|Queen Mary]]. He wrote in his diary, "When I told her what had happened, I broke down and sobbed like a child."&lt;ref&gt;Wheeler-Bennett, p. 286&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day of the abdication, the [[Oireachtas]], the parliament of the [[Irish Free State]], [[Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936|removed all direct mention of the monarch]] from the [[Constitution of the Irish Free State|Irish constitution]]. The next day, it passed the [[Executive Authority (External Relations) Act 1936|External Relations Act]], which gave the monarch limited authority (strictly on the advice of the government) to appoint diplomatic representatives for Ireland and to be involved in the making of foreign treaties. The two acts made the Irish Free State a republic in essence without removing its links to the Commonwealth.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Courtier and journalist Dermot Morrah alleged that there was brief speculation as to the desirability of bypassing Albert (and his children) and his brother, [[Prince Henry, Duke of Gloucester]], in favour of their younger brother [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]]. This seems to have been suggested on the grounds that Prince George was at that time the only brother with [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent|a son]].&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 63; Judd, p. 135&lt;/ref&gt;

Albert assumed the [[regnal name]] "George VI" to emphasise continuity with his father and restore confidence in the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 66; Judd, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; The beginning of George VI's reign was taken up by questions surrounding his predecessor and brother, whose titles, style and position were uncertain. He had been introduced as "His Royal Highness Prince Edward" for the abdication broadcast,&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 144; Sinclair, p. 224&lt;/ref&gt; but George VI felt that by abdicating and renouncing the succession, Edward had lost the right to bear royal titles, including "Royal Highness".&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, p. 143&lt;/ref&gt; In settling the issue, George's first act as king was to confer upon his brother the title "[[Duke of Windsor]]" with the style "Royal Highness", but the [[letters patent]] creating the dukedom prevented any wife or children from bearing royal styles. George VI was forced to buy from Edward the royal residences of [[Balmoral Castle]] and [[Sandringham House]], as these were private properties and did not pass to George VI automatically.&lt;ref&gt;Ziegler, p. 326&lt;/ref&gt; Three days after his accession, on his 41st birthday, he invested his wife, the new [[queen consort]], with the [[Order of the Garter]].&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George VI's coronation]] at Westminster Abbey took place on 12 May 1937, the date previously intended for Edward's coronation. In a break with tradition, Queen Mary attended the ceremony in a show of support for her son.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; There was no [[durbar (court)|Durbar]] held in [[Delhi]] for George VI, as had occurred for his father, as the cost would have been a burden to the [[British Raj|government of India]].&lt;ref&gt;Vickers, p. 175&lt;/ref&gt; Rising [[Indian independence movement|Indian nationalism]] made the welcome that the royal party would have received likely to be muted at best,&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 209&lt;/ref&gt; and a prolonged absence from Britain would have been undesirable in the tense period before the Second World War. Two overseas tours were undertaken, to France and to North America, both of which promised greater strategic advantages in the event of war.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 269, 281&lt;/ref&gt;

The growing likelihood of war in Europe dominated the early reign of George VI. The King was constitutionally bound to support Prime Minister [[Neville Chamberlain]]'s [[appeasement of Hitler]].&lt;ref name="matthew"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, p. 230&lt;/ref&gt; However, when the King and Queen greeted Chamberlain on his return from negotiating the [[Munich Agreement]] in 1938, they invited him to appear on the balcony of [[Buckingham Palace]] with them. This public association of the monarchy with a politician was exceptional, as balcony appearances were traditionally restricted to the royal family.&lt;ref name="matthew" /&gt; While broadly popular among the general public, Chamberlain's policy towards Hitler was the subject of some opposition in the [[British House of Commons|House of Commons]], which led historian [[John Grigg (writer)|John Grigg]] to describe the King's behaviour in associating himself so prominently with a politician as "the most unconstitutional act by a British sovereign in the present century".&lt;ref&gt;[[Christopher Hitchens|Hitchens, Christopher]] (1 April 2002), [https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/apr/01/queenmother.monarchy9 "Mourning will be brief"], ''The Guardian'', retrieved 1 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In May and June 1939, the [[1939 royal tour of Canada|King and Queen toured Canada]] and the United States. From [[Ottawa]], they were accompanied throughout by Canadian Prime Minister [[William Lyon Mackenzie King]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url=http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1070.06-e.html| last=Library and Archives Canada| authorlink=Library and Archives Canada| title=Biography and People &gt; A Real Companion and Friend &gt; Behind the Diary &gt; Politics, Themes, and Events from King's Life &gt; The Royal Tour of 1939| publisher=Queen's Printer for Canada| accessdate=12 December 2009| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091030064730/http://www.collectionscanada.gc.ca/king/023011-1070.06-e.html| archivedate=30 October 2009| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; to present themselves in North America as [[Monarchy of Canada|King and Queen of Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Bousfield| first=Arthur| author2=Toffoli, Garry| title=Royal Spring: The Royal Tour of 1939 and the Queen Mother in Canada| publisher=Dundurn Press| year=1989| location=Toronto| pages=60, 66| url=https://books.google.com/?id=1Go5p_CN8UQC&amp;printsec=frontcover| isbn=978-1-55002-065-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Lanctot| first=Gustave| authorlink=Gustave Lanctot| title=Royal Tour of King George VI and Queen Elizabeth in Canada and the United States of America 1939| publisher=E.P.

Both Governor General of Canada [[John Buchan, 1st Baron Tweedsmuir|Lord Tweedsmuir]] and Mackenzie King hoped that the King's presence in Canada would demonstrate the principles of the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]], which gave full sovereignty to the [[British Dominions]]. On 19 May, George VI personally accepted and approved the [[Letter of Credence]] of the new U.S. Ambassador to Canada, [[Daniel Calhoun Roper]]; gave [[Royal Assent]] to nine parliamentary bills; and ratified two international treaties with the [[Great Seal of Canada]]. The official royal tour historian, [[Gustave Lanctot]], wrote "the Statute of Westminster had assumed full reality" and George gave a speech emphasising "the free and equal association of the nations of the Commonwealth".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Galbraith| first=William| title=Fiftieth Anniversary of the 1939 Royal Visit| journal=Canadian Parliamentary Review| volume=12| issue=3| pages=7–9| year=1989| url=http://www.revparl.ca/english/issue.asp?art=820&amp;param=130| accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The trip was intended to soften the strong [[isolationist]] tendencies among the North American public with regard to the developing tensions in Europe. Although the aim of the tour was mainly political, to shore up Atlantic support for the United Kingdom in any future war, the King and Queen were enthusiastically received by the public.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 163–166; Rhodes James, pp. 154–168; Vickers, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt; The fear that George would be compared unfavourably to his predecessor, Edward VIII, was dispelled.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, pp. 298–299&lt;/ref&gt; They visited the [[1939 New York World's Fair]] and stayed with President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] at the [[White House]] and at [[Home of Franklin D. Roosevelt National Historic Site|his private estate]] at [[Hyde Park, New York]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' Monday, 12 June 1939 p. 12 col. A&lt;/ref&gt; A strong bond of friendship was forged between the King and Queen and the President during the tour, which had major significance in the relations between the United States and the United Kingdom through the ensuing war years.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Swift |first=Will |title=The Roosevelts and the Royals: Franklin and Eleanor, the King and Queen of England, and the Friendship that Changed History |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 189; Rhodes James, p. 344&lt;/ref&gt;

==Second World War==
In September 1939, Britain and the self-governing Dominions [[Irish neutrality during World War II|other than Ireland]] declared war on [[Nazi Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 171–172; Townsend, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; George VI and his wife resolved to stay in London, despite German [[The Blitz|bombing raids]]. They officially stayed in Buckingham Palace throughout the war, although they usually spent nights at [[Windsor Castle]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 183; Rhodes James, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; The first night of the Blitz on London, on 7 September 1940, killed about one thousand civilians, mostly in the [[East End]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Arnold-Forster|first=Mark|authorlink=Mark Arnold-Forster|year=1983|origyear=1973|title=The World at War|location=London|publisher=Thames Methuen|isbn=978-0-423-00680-3|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 13 September, the King and Queen narrowly avoided death when two German bombs exploded in a courtyard at Buckingham Palace while they were there.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Churchill |first=Winston |authorlink=Winston Churchill |title=The Second World War |publisher=Cassell and Co. Ltd |year=1949 |volume=II |page=334}}&lt;/ref&gt; In defiance, the Queen famously declared: "I am glad we have been bombed. It makes me feel we can look the East End in the face."&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 184; Rhodes James, pp. 211–212; Townsend, p. 111&lt;/ref&gt; The royal family were portrayed as sharing the same dangers and deprivations as the rest of the country. They were subject to [[Rationing in the United Kingdom|rationing restrictions]], and [[First Lady of the United States|U.S. First Lady]] [[Eleanor Roosevelt]] remarked on the rationed food served and the limited bathwater that was permitted during a stay at the unheated and boarded-up Palace.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Goodwin|first=Doris Kearns|authorlink=Doris Kearns Goodwin|title=No Ordinary Time: Franklin and Eleanor Roosevelt: The Home Front in World War II|location=New York|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|year=1994|page=380}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 1942, the King's brother, [[Prince George, Duke of Kent]], was killed on active service.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 187; Weir, p. 324&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:King George VI with Sir Bernard Montgomery.jpg|thumb|left|George VI (left) with [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]] (right), [[Holland]], October 1944]]

In 1940, [[Winston Churchill]] replaced [[Neville Chamberlain]] as [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], though personally George would have preferred to appoint [[Edward Wood, 1st Earl of Halifax|Lord Halifax]].&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 180&lt;/ref&gt; After the King's initial dismay over Churchill's appointment of [[Max Aitken, 1st Baron Beaverbrook|Lord Beaverbrook]] to the Cabinet, he and Churchill developed "the closest personal relationship in modern British history between a monarch and a Prime Minister".&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 195&lt;/ref&gt; Every Tuesday for four and a half years from September 1940, the two men met privately for lunch to discuss the war in secret and with frankness.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, pp. 202–210&lt;/ref&gt; The King has related much of what the two discussed in his diary, which is the only extant first-hand account of these conversations.&lt;ref&gt;Weisbrode, Kenneth (2013), ''Churchill and the King'', New York: Viking, pp. 107, 117–118, 148, 154–155, 166. {{ISBN|978-0670025763}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the war, the King and Queen provided morale-boosting visits throughout the United Kingdom, visiting bomb sites, munitions factories, and troops. The King visited military forces abroad in France in December 1939, North Africa and [[Malta]] in June 1943, [[Operation Overlord|Normandy]] in June 1944, southern Italy in July 1944, and the Low Countries in October 1944.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 176, 201–203, 207–208&lt;/ref&gt; Their high public profile and apparently indefatigable determination secured their place as symbols of national resistance.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 170&lt;/ref&gt; At a social function in 1944, the [[Chief of the General Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Imperial General Staff]], [[Field marshal (United Kingdom)|Field Marshal]] [[Alan Brooke, 1st Viscount Alanbrooke|Sir Alan Brooke]], revealed that every time he met Field Marshal [[Bernard Montgomery|Sir Bernard Montgomery]], he thought Montgomery was after his job. The King replied: "You should worry, when I meet him, I always think he's after mine!"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|author=Reagan, Geoffrey|year=1992|title=Military Anecdotes|page=25|publisher=Guinness|isbn=978-0-85112-519-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1945, crowds shouted "We want the King!" in front of Buckingham Palace during the [[Victory in Europe Day]] celebrations. In an echo of Chamberlain's appearance, the King invited Churchill to appear with the royal family on the balcony to public acclaim.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 210&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 1946, George addressed the [[United Nations General Assembly|United Nations]] at their first assembly, which was held in London, and reaffirmed "our faith in the equal rights of men and women and of nations great and small".&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 173&lt;/ref&gt;

==Empire to Commonwealth==
[[File:Attlee with GeorgeVI HU 59486.jpg|thumb|George VI (right) with British prime minister [[Clement Attlee]], July 1945]]

George VI's reign saw the acceleration of the dissolution of the [[British Empire]]. The [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] had already acknowledged the evolution of the [[Dominion]]s into separate [[sovereignty|sovereign]] states. The process of transformation from an empire to a voluntary association of independent states, known as the [[Commonwealth of Nations|Commonwealth]], gathered pace after the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 176&lt;/ref&gt; During the ministry of [[Clement Attlee]], [[British India]] became the two independent Dominions of [[Dominion of India|India]] and [[Dominion of Pakistan|Pakistan]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, pp. 229–232, 247–265&lt;/ref&gt; George relinquished the title of [[Emperor of India]], and became King of India and King of Pakistan instead. In 1950 he ceased to be King of India when it became a republic within the Commonwealth of Nations and recognised his new title of [[Head of the Commonwealth]]; he remained King of Pakistan until his death. Other countries left the Commonwealth, such as [[Burma]] in January 1948, [[Mandatory Palestine|Palestine]] (divided between [[Israel]] and the Arab states) in May 1948 and the Republic of Ireland in 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, pp. 267–270&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1947, the King and his family toured Southern Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, pp. 221–223&lt;/ref&gt; The Prime Minister of the [[Union of South Africa]], [[Jan Smuts]], was facing an election and hoped to make political capital out of the visit.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt; George was appalled, however, when instructed by the South African government to shake hands only with whites,&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 295&lt;/ref&gt; and referred to his South African bodyguards as "the [[Gestapo]]".&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 294; Shawcross, p. 618&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the tour, Smuts lost [[South African general election, 1948|the election the following year]], and the new government instituted a [[apartheid|strict policy of racial segregation]].

==Illness and death==
The stress of the war had taken its toll on the King's health,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|publisher=Official website of the British monarchy|title=King George VI|url=https://www.royal.uk/george-vi-r1936-1952|accessdate=18 April 2016|date=12 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 225; Townsend, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt; made worse by his heavy [[tobacco smoking|smoking]]&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 240&lt;/ref&gt; and subsequent development of [[lung cancer]] among other ailments, including [[arteriosclerosis]] and [[thromboangiitis obliterans|Buerger's disease]]. A planned tour of Australia and New Zealand was postponed after the King suffered an arterial blockage in his right leg, which threatened the loss of the leg and was treated with a right [[lumbar sympathectomy]] in March 1949.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, pp. 314–317&lt;/ref&gt;

His elder daughter Elizabeth, the heir presumptive, took on more royal duties as her father's health deteriorated. The delayed tour was re-organised, with Elizabeth and her husband, the [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh|Duke of Edinburgh]], taking the place of the King and Queen. The King was well enough to open the [[Festival of Britain]] in May 1951, but on 23 September 1951, his left [[pneumonectomy|lung was removed]] by [[Clement Price Thomas]] after a malignant tumour was found.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 454; Rhodes James, p. 330&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1951, Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh went on a month-long tour of Canada; the trip had been delayed for a week due to the King's illness. At the [[State Opening of Parliament]] in November, the King's [[speech from the throne]] was read for him by the [[Lord Chancellor]], [[Lord Simonds]].&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 331&lt;/ref&gt; His [[Royal Christmas Message|Christmas broadcast]] of 1951 was recorded in sections, and then edited together.&lt;ref&gt;Rhodes James, p. 334&lt;/ref&gt;

On 31 January 1952, despite advice from those close to him, the King went to [[London Heathrow Airport|London Airport]]{{efn|Renamed Heathrow Airport in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.heathrowairport.com/about-us/company-news-and-information/company-information/our-history|title=About Heathrow Airport: Heathrow's history|publisher=LHR Airports|accessdate=9 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} to see off Princess Elizabeth, who was going on her tour of Australia via [[Kenya Colony|Kenya]]. On the morning of 6 February at 07:30 [[GMT]], George VI was found dead in bed at [[Sandringham House]] in Norfolk.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/february/6/newsid_2711000/2711265.stm|title=1952: King George VI dies in his sleep|publisher=BBC|accessdate=29 May 2018|date=6 February 1952}}&lt;/ref&gt; He had died from a [[coronary thrombosis]] in his sleep at the age of 56.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 247–248&lt;/ref&gt; His daughter flew back to Britain from Kenya as Queen Elizabeth II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/1802079.stm|title=The day the King died|publisher=BBC|date=6 February 2002|accessdate=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 9 February for two days his coffin rested in [[St. Mary Magdalene Church, Sandringham]], before [[lying in state]] at [[Westminster Hall]] from 11 February.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Repose at Sandringham|work=Life|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dFQEAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA38|accessdate=26 December 2011|date=18 February 1952|publisher=Time Inc|page=38|issn=0024-3019}}&lt;/ref&gt; His funeral took place at [[St. George's Chapel, Windsor Castle]], on the 15th.&lt;ref&gt;Bradford, p. 462&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred initially in the Royal Vault until he was transferred to the King George VI Memorial Chapel inside St. George's on 26 March 1969.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/royal-connection/burial/burials-in-the-chapel-since-1805.html|title=Royal Burials in the Chapel since 1805|publisher=Dean &amp; Canons of Windsor|accessdate=15 February 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927024852/http://www.stgeorges-windsor.org/about-st-georges/royal-connection/burial/burials-in-the-chapel-since-1805.html|archivedate=27 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, fifty years after his death, the remains of his widow, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, and the ashes of his younger daughter Princess Margaret, who both died that year, were interred in the chapel alongside him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Mourners visit Queen Mother's vault|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1920360.stm|accessdate=2 March 2018|publisher=BBC News|date=10 April 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour]] [[Member of Parliament]] [[George Hardie (Labour politician)|George Hardie]], the abdication crisis of 1936 did "more for republicanism than fifty years of propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;Hardie in the British House of Commons, 11 December 1936, quoted in Rhodes James, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; George VI wrote to his brother Edward that in the aftermath of the abdication he had reluctantly assumed "a rocking throne" and tried "to make it steady again".&lt;ref&gt;Letter from George VI to the Duke of Windsor, quoted in Rhodes James, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; He became king at a point when public faith in the monarchy was at a low ebb. During his reign his people endured the hardships of war, and imperial power was eroded. However, as a dutiful family man and by showing personal courage, he succeeded in restoring the popularity of the monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Ashley|first=Mike|authorlink=Mike Ashley (writer)|year=1998|title=British Monarchs|publisher=Robinson|location=London|isbn=978-1-84119-096-9|pages=703–704}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judd, pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[George Cross]] and the [[George Medal]] were founded at the King's suggestion during the Second World War to recognise acts of exceptional civilian bravery.&lt;ref&gt;Judd, p. 186; Rhodes James, p. 216&lt;/ref&gt; He bestowed the George Cross on the entire "[[Siege of Malta (World War II)|island fortress of Malta]]" in 1943.&lt;ref&gt;Townsend, p. 137&lt;/ref&gt; He was posthumously awarded the [[Ordre de la Libération]] by the French government in 1960, one of only two people (the other being Churchill) to be awarded the medal after 1946.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url=http://www.ordredelaliberation.fr/fr_doc/liste_compagnons.pdf|publisher=Ordre de la Libération|accessdate=19 September 2009|format=PDF|title=List of Companions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of geographical features, roads, and institutions are named after George VI. These include [[King George Hospital, London|King George Hospital]] in London; [[King George VI Reservoir]] in Surrey, United Kingdom; [[British Columbia Highway 99A|King George VI Highway]] and [[King George Boulevard]] in [[Surrey, British Columbia]]; [[Kingsway (Edmonton)|Kingsway]] in [[Edmonton]]; [[George VI Sound]] in Antarctica; and the [[King George VI Chase]], a horse race in the United Kingdom.

[[Colin Firth]] won an [[Academy Award for Best Actor]] for his performance as George VI in ''[[The King's Speech]]'', a 2010 film that won the [[Academy Award for Best Picture]].

George held a number of titles throughout his life, as successively great-grandson, grandson and son of the monarch. As sovereign, he was referred to most often as simply ''The King'' or ''His Majesty''. In his position as sovereign, George automatically held the position of [[Commander-in-Chief]].

=== Arms ===
As Duke of York, George bore the [[royal arms of the United Kingdom]] differenced with a [[Label (heraldry)|label]] of three points [[argent]], the centre point bearing an anchor [[Azure (heraldry)|azure]]&amp;nbsp;– a difference earlier awarded to his father, George V, when he was Duke of York, and then later awarded to his grandson [[Prince Andrew, Duke of York]]. As king, he bore the royal arms undifferenced.&lt;ref&gt;Velde, François (19 April 2008), ''[http://www.heraldica.org/topics/britain/cadency.htm Marks of Cadency in the British Royal Family]'', Heraldica, retrieved 22 April 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

There was widespread belief in ''' ghosts in Polynesian culture''', some of which persists today.
After death, a person's [[ghost]] would normally travel to the sky world or the underworld, but some could stay on earth. In many [[Polynesian culture|Polynesian]] legends, ghosts were often involved in the affairs of the living. Ghosts might also cause sickness or even invade the body of ordinary people, to be driven out through strong medicines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Ghost spirit==

In the [[Linguistic reconstruction|reconstructed]] [[Proto-Polynesian language]], the word "*qaitu"&lt;ref&gt;*q in reconstructed Proto-Polynesian words indicates a [[glottal stop]].&lt;/ref&gt; refers to a ghost, the spirit of a dead person, while the word "*tupuqa" has a broader meaning including all supernatural beings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Some of the ancient [[Māui (mythology)|Māui]] legends that are common throughout the [[Polynesia]]n islands include the idea of a double soul inhabiting the body. One was the soul which never forsakes man, and the other the soul that could be separated or charmed away from the body by incantations was the "hau".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In some societies, the tattoo marks on the Polynesian's face indicated their cult. A spiral symbol meant that the man favoured the sky world,  but before ascending there on a whirlwind his ghost had to travel to his people's homeland, situated in the navel of the world. Different markings indicated that the ghost chose to live in the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The Hawaiians believed in "aumakua", ghosts who did not go down into Po, the land of King [[Lua-o-Milu|Milu]]. 
These ghosts remained in the land of the living, guarding their former families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Legends==

All Polynesian societies have many stories of ghosts or spirits who played a role in their traditional legends. [[William Drake Westervelt]] collected and published eighteen of them in ''Hawaiian Legends of Ghosts and Ghost-Gods'' (1915).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The legend of Pele, the [[Culture of Hawaii|Hawaiian]] goddess of volcanic fire, relates how she fell in love with a man, but found that he had died. She found his ghost as a thin presence in a cave, and with great difficulty used her magical powers to restore him to life. He was destroyed again, but his ghost was once more found, this time in the form of a bird flitting over the waters, and once more restored to life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Another Hawaiian legend tells of a young man who fell into the hands of the priests of a high temple who captured and sacrificed him to their god, and then planned to treat his bones dishonorably. The young man's ghost revealed the situation to his father through a dream, and aided his father to retrieve the bones through great exertions and to place them in his own secret burial cave. The ghost of the young man was then able to joyfully go down to the spirit world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

==Influence of ghosts==

[[Ghost sickness]] in Polynesia takes two forms: possession and bizarre behavior, where the victim often talks with the voice of a dead person, and retarded healing caused by a ghost or evil spirit. The patient is treated with strong-smelling plants such as beach pea, island rue or ti plant (''[[Cordyline fruticosa]]''), and in the case of possession through reasoning with the ghost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/ethnobotany/pdf/PolynesianHerbalMedicine.pdf |title=Polynesian Herbal Medicine |publisher=University of Hawai'i |accessdate=2010-03-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060902235946/http://www.botany.hawaii.edu/ethnobotany/pdf/PolynesianHerbalMedicine.pdf |archivedate=September 2, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the arts==

Of his 1892 Tahitian painting Manao Tupapau, [[Paul Gauguin]] said "according to Tahitian beliefs, the title Manao Tupapau has a double meaning . . . either she thinks of the ghost or the ghost thinks of her".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[Robert Louis Stevenson]] wrote about Polynesian beliefs and customs, including the belief in ghosts, in his last collection  of stories, ''[[Island Nights' Entertainments]]''. He wrote the book on [[Samoa]] in 1893 in a realistic style that was not well received by the critics, but the stories which dealt with false and real supernatural events are now considered among his best                   .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A '''global catastrophic risk''' is a hypothetical future event which could damage human well-being on a global scale,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| authorlink= Nick Bostrom| first= Nick| last= Bostrom| date= 2008| url= http://www.global-catastrophic-risks.com/docs/Chap01.pdf| title= Global Catastrophic Risks| volume=| publisher= Oxford University Press | page = 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; even crippling or destroying [[Modernity|modern civilization]].&lt;ref name="world"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ripple WJ, Wolf C, Newsome TM, Galetti M, Alamgir M, Crist E, Mahmoud MI, Laurance WF|title=World Scientists’ Warning to Humanity: A Second Notice|journal=BioScience|date=13 November 2017|volume=|doi=10.1093/biosci/bix125|url=https://academic.oup.com/bioscience/article/doi/10.1093/biosci/bix125/4605229}}&lt;/ref&gt; An event that could cause [[human extinction]] or permanently and drastically curtail humanity's potential is known as an '''existential risk'''.&lt;ref name="types"&gt;{{cite journal| authorlink=Nick Bostrom| first=Nick| last=Bostrom|date=March 2002| url= http://www.nickbostrom.com/existential/risks.html| title= Existential Risks: Analyzing Human Extinction Scenarios and Related Hazards| journal= [[Journal of Evolution and Technology]]| volume=9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potential global catastrophic risks include anthropogenic risks, caused by humans (technology, governance, climate change), and natural or external risks.&lt;ref name=world/&gt; Examples of technology risks are [[Existential risk from artificial general intelligence|hostile artificial intelligence]] and destructive [[biotechnology]] or [[Molecular nanotechnology#Risks|nanotechnology]]. Insufficient or malign [[global governance]] creates risks in the social and political domain, such as a [[World War III|global war]], including [[nuclear holocaust]], [[bioterrorism]] using [[genetically modified organism]]s, [[cyberterrorism]] destroying [[critical infrastructure]] like the [[electrical grid]]; or the failure to manage a natural [[pandemic]]. Problems and risks in the domain of [[earth system governance]] include [[global warming]], [[environmental degradation]], including [[extinction]] of species, [[famine]] as a result of [[Social development theory|non-equitable]] resource distribution, [[human overpopulation]], [[crop failures]] and non-[[sustainable agriculture]]. Examples of non-anthropogenic risks are an asteroid [[impact event]], a [[Supervolcano|supervolcanic]] [[types of volcanic eruptions|eruption]], a [[Gamma-ray burst#Hypothetical effects on Earth in the past|lethal gamma-ray burst]], a [[geomagnetic storm]] destroying electronic equipment, natural long-term [[climate change]], or hostile [[extraterrestrial life]].

==Classifications==
[[File:X-risk-chart-en-01a.svg|thumb|500px|Scope/intensity grid from Bostrom's paper "Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority"&lt;ref name = "priority"/&gt;]]

===Global catastrophic vs. existential===
Philosopher [[Nick Bostrom]] classifies risks according to their scope and intensity.&lt;ref name="priority" /&gt; A "global catastrophic risk" is any risk that is at least "global" in scope, and is not subjectively "imperceptible" in intensity. Those that are at least "trans-generational" (affecting all future generations) in scope and "terminal"{{clarify |date=April 2017 |reason= does "terminal" mean human extinction or not?|text= }} in intensity are classified as existential risks. While a global catastrophic risk may kill the vast majority of life on earth, humanity could still potentially recover. An existential risk, on the other hand, is one that either destroys humanity (and, presumably, all but the most rudimentary species of [[Animal|non-human lifeforms]] and/or [[Plants|plant life]]) entirely or at least prevents any chance of civilization recovering. Bostrom considers existential risks to be far more significant.&lt;ref name="waste" /&gt;

Similarly, in ''[[Catastrophe: Risk and Response]]'', [[Richard Posner]] singles out and groups together events that bring about "utter overthrow or ruin" on a global, rather than a "local or regional" scale. Posner singles out such events as worthy of special attention on [[cost-benefit]] grounds because they could directly or indirectly jeopardize the survival of the human race as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard A.|title=Catastrophe : risk and response|date=2006|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0195306477}}, Introduction, "What is Catastrophe?"&lt;/ref&gt; Posner's events include [[Impact event#Frequency and Risk|meteor impacts]], runaway [[global warming]], [[grey goo]], [[bioterrorism]], and [[Safety of high energy particle collision experiments|particle accelerator accidents]].

Researchers experience difficulty in studying near human extinction directly, since humanity has never been destroyed before.&lt;ref name="observation selection effects cirkovic"/&gt; While this does not mean that it will not be in the future, it does make modelling existential risks difficult, due in part to [[survivorship bias]].

=== Other classifications ===
Bostrom identifies four types of existential risk. "Bangs" are sudden catastrophes, which may be accidental or deliberate. He thinks the most likely sources of bangs are malicious use of [[nanotechnology]], [[nuclear warfare|nuclear war]], and [[simulation hypothesis|the possibility that the universe is a simulation]] that will end. "Crunches" are scenarios in which humanity survives but civilization is slowly destroyed. The most likely causes of this, he believes, are [[environmental degradation|exhaustion of natural resources]], a stable [[world government|global government]] that prevents technological progress, or [[dysgenics|dysgenic pressures]] that lower average intelligence. "Shrieks" are undesirable futures. For example, if a single mind enhances its powers by merging with a computer, it could dominate human civilization. Bostrom believes that this scenario is most likely, followed by flawed superintelligence and a repressive totalitarian regime. "Whimpers" are the gradual decline of human civilization or current values. He thinks the most likely cause would be evolution changing moral preference, followed by extraterrestrial invasion.&lt;ref name="types"/&gt;

Some risks, such as that from asteroid impact, with a one-in-a-million chance of causing humanity's extinction in the next century,&lt;ref name="Matheny xrisk"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matheny|first=Jason Gaverick|title=Reducing the Risk of Human Extinction|url=http://users.physics.harvard.edu/~wilson/pmpmta/Mahoney_extinction.pdf|journal=Risk Analysis|date=2007|volume=27|issue=5|doi=10.1111/j.1539-6924.2007.00960.x|pages=1335–1344|pmid=18076500}}&lt;/ref&gt; have had their probabilities predicted using straightforward, well-understood, and (in principle) precise methods (although even in cases like these, the exact rate of large impacts is contested).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Asher | first1 = D.J. | last2 = Bailey | first2 = M.E. | last3 = Emel'yanenko | first3 = V. | last4 = Napier | first4 = W.M. | year = 2005 | title = Earth in the cosmic shooting gallery | url = http://www.arm.ac.uk/preprints/455.pdf | format = PDF | journal = The Observatory | volume = 125 | issue = | pages = 319–322 |bibcode = 2005Obs...125..319A }}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the frequency of volcanic eruptions of sufficient magnitude to cause catastrophic climate change, similar to the [[Toba catastrophe theory|Toba Eruption]], which may have almost caused the extinction of the human race,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Ambrose|1998}}; {{Harvnb|Rampino|Ambrose|2000}}, pp. 71, 80.&lt;/ref&gt; has been estimated at about 1 in every 50,000 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Rampino | first1 = M.R. | last2 = Ambrose | first2 = S.H. | year = 2002 | title = Super eruptions as a threat to civilizations on Earth-like planets | url = http://www.eos.ubc.ca/~mjelline/website212/rampino02.pdf | journal = Icarus | volume = 156 | issue = 2| pages = 562–569 | doi = 10.1006/icar.2001.6808 | bibcode=2002Icar..156..562R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relative danger posed by other threats is much more difficult to calculate. Given the limitations of ordinary calculation and modeling, expert elicitation is frequently used instead to obtain probability estimates.&lt;ref name="probabilities and methodologies"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rowe |first1=Thomas |last2=Beard |first2=Simon |title=Probabilities, methodologies and the  evidence base in existential risk assessments |journal=Working paper, Centre for the Study of Existential Risk |date=2018 |url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/89506/1/Beard_Existential-Risk-Assessments_Accepted.pdf |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, an informal survey of experts on different global catastrophic risks at the Global Catastrophic Risk Conference at the [[University of Oxford]] suggested a 19% chance of human extinction by the year 2100. The conference report cautions that the results should be taken "with a grain of salt".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 2016 annual report by the [[Global Challenges Foundation]] estimates that an average American is more than five times more likely to die during a human-extinction event than in a car crash.&lt;ref name=gcf_atlantic&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2016/04/a-human-extinction-isnt-that-unlikely/480444/ |title=Human Extinction Isn't That Unlikely  |work=[[The Atlantic]] |author=Robinson Meyer |date=April 29, 2016 |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gcf_home&gt;{{cite web |url=http://globalchallenges.org |title=Global Challenges Foundation website |work=globalchallenges.org |date= |accessdate=April 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are significant methodological challenges in estimating these risks with precision. Most attention has been given to risks to human civilization over the next 100 years, but forecasting for this length of time is difficult. The types of threats posed by nature may prove relatively constant, though new risks could be discovered. Anthropogenic threats, however, are likely to change dramatically with the development of new technology; while volcanoes have been a threat throughout history, nuclear weapons have only been an issue since the 20th century. Historically, the ability of experts to predict the future over these timescales has proved very limited. Man-made threats such as nuclear war or [[nanotechnology]] are harder to predict than natural threats, due to the inherent methodological difficulties in the social sciences. In general, it is hard to estimate the magnitude of the risk from this or other dangers, especially as both international relations and technology can change rapidly.

Existential risks pose unique challenges to prediction, even more than other long-term events, because of [[Anthropic principle|observation selection effects]]. Unlike with most events, the failure of a complete [[extinction event]] to occur in the past is not evidence against their likelihood in the future, because every world that has experienced such an extinction event has no observers, so regardless of their frequency, no civilization observes existential risks in its history.&lt;ref name="observation selection effects cirkovic"&gt;[http://www.nickbostrom.com/papers/anthropicshadow.pdf "Observation Selection Effects and Global Catastrophic Risks"], Milan Cirkovic, 2008&lt;/ref&gt; These [[Anthropic principle|anthropic]] issues can be avoided by looking at evidence that does not have such selection effects, such as asteroid impact craters on the Moon, or directly evaluating the likely impact of new technology.&lt;ref name="priority"/&gt;

In addition to known and tangible risks, unforeseeable [[black swan theory|black swan]] extinction events may occur, presenting an additional methodological problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Jebari |first1=Karim |title=Existential Risks: Exploring a Robust Risk Reduction Strategy |journal=Science and Engineering Ethics |date=2014 |volume=21 |issue=3 |page=541-554 |url=https://philpapers.org/archive/JEBERE.pdf |accessdate=26 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Moral importance of existential risk==
Some scholars have strongly favored reducing existential risk on the grounds that it greatly benefits future generations. [[Derek Parfit]] argues that extinction would be a great loss because our descendants could potentially survive for four billion years before the [[Sun#After core hydrogen exhaustion|expansion of the Sun]] makes the Earth uninhabitable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Parfit|first=Derek|title=[[Reasons and Persons]]|date=1984|publisher=Oxford University Press|pages=453–454}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Carrington |first=Damian |date=21 February 2000 |title=Date set for desert Earth |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/sci/tech/specials/washington_2000/649913.stm |newspaper=BBC News Online |location= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nick Bostrom]] argues that there is even greater potential in colonizing space. If future humans colonize space, they may be able to support a very large number of people on other planets, potentially lasting for trillions of years.&lt;ref name="waste"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bostrom|first=Nick|title=Astronomical Waste: The opportunity cost of delayed technological development|journal=Utilitas|volume=15|issue=3|pages=308–314|doi=10.1017/s0953820800004076|url=http://www.nickbostrom.com/astronomical/waste.html|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, reducing existential risk by even a small amount would have a very significant impact on the expected number of people who will exist in the future.

[[Exponential discounting]] might make these future benefits much less significant. However, Jason Matheny has argued that such discounting is inappropriate when assessing the value of existential risk reduction.&lt;ref name="Matheny xrisk"/&gt;

Some economists have discussed the importance of global catastrophic risks, though not existential risks. Martin Weitzman argues that most of the expected economic damage from climate change may come from the small chance that warming greatly exceeds the mid-range expectations, resulting in catastrophic damage.&lt;ref name="weitzman1"&gt;{{cite journal|last= Weitzman|first= Martin|title= On modeling and interpreting the economics of catastrophic climate change |url=http://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/3693423/Weitzman_OnModeling.pdf|journal= The Review of Economics and Statistics|date= 2009|volume= 91|issue= 1|pages= 1–19|doi= 10.1162/rest.91.1.1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Posner]] has argued that we are doing far too little, in general, about small, hard-to-estimate risks of large-scale catastrophes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Posner|first=Richard|title=[[Catastrophe: Risk and Response]]|date=2004|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous [[cognitive biases]] can influence people's judgment of the importance of existential risks, including [[scope insensitivity]], [[hyperbolic discounting]], [[availability heuristic]], the [[conjunction fallacy]], the [[affect heuristic]], and the [[overconfidence effect]].&lt;ref name="Biases"/&gt;

Scope insensitivity influences how bad people consider the extinction of the human race to be. For example, when people are motivated to donate money to altruistic causes, the quantity they are willing to give does not increase linearly with the magnitude of the issue: people are roughly as concerned about 200,000 birds getting stuck in oil as they are about 2,000.&lt;ref&gt;Desvousges, W.H., Johnson, F.R., Dunford, R.W., Boyle, K.J., Hudson, S.P., and Wilson, N. 1993, Measuring natural resource damages with contingent valuation: tests of validity and reliability. In Hausman, J.A. (ed), ''Contingent Valuation:A Critical Assessment'', pp. 91−159 (Amsterdam: North Holland).&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, people are often more concerned about threats to individuals than to larger groups.&lt;ref name="Biases"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yudkowsky |first1=Eliezer |title=Cognitive Biases Potentially Affecting Judgment of Global Risks |journal=Global Catastrophic Risks |date=2008 |pages=91–119 |url=https://intelligence.org/files/CognitiveBiases.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are economic reasons that can explain why so little effort is going into existential risk reduction. It is a global good, so even if a large nation decreases it, that nation will only enjoy a small fraction of the benefit of doing so. Furthermore, the vast majority of the benefits may be enjoyed by far future generations, and though these quadrillions of future people would in theory perhaps be willing to pay massive sums for existential risk reduction, no mechanism for such a transaction exists.&lt;ref name="priority"&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.existential-risk.org/concept.pdf | title=Existential Risk Prevention as Global Priority  | last = Bostrom |first=Nick | journal=Global Policy | year=2013 | volume=4 | issue=1|publisher=Future of Humanity Institute|via=Existential Risk | pages=15–3| doi = 10.1111/1758-5899.12002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential sources of risk==
Some sources of catastrophic risk are natural, such as meteor impacts or supervolcanoes. Some of these have caused mass extinctions in the past. On the other hand, some risks are man-made, such as global warming,&lt;ref name="IPCC AR5 attribution"&gt;
IPCC (11 November 2013): D. "Understanding the Climate System and its Recent Changes", in: [https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_SPM_FINAL.pdf Summary for Policymakers (finalized version)], in: {{harvnb|IPCC AR5 WG1|2013|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; environmental degradation, engineered pandemics and nuclear war. 

===Anthropogenic===
The Cambridge Project at [[Cambridge University]] states that the "greatest threats" to the human species are man-made; they are artificial intelligence, global warming, nuclear war, and rogue biotechnology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/tech/2012/11/26/terminator-center-to-open-at-cambridge-university/ | work=Fox News | title='Terminator center' to open at Cambridge University | date=2012-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Future of Humanity Institute]] also states that human extinction is more likely to result from anthropogenic causes than natural causes.&lt;ref name="priority"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Frequently Asked Questions"&gt;

====Artificial intelligence====
{{Main|Existential risk from advanced artificial intelligence|AI takeover|Friendly artificial intelligence|Technological singularity}}
It has been suggested that [[Ethics of artificial intelligence#Unintended consequences|learning computers]] that rapidly become [[superintelligence|superintelligent]] may take unforeseen actions, or that [[Robot#Social impact|robots]] would out-compete humanity (one [[technological singularity]] scenario).&lt;ref name="billjoy"&gt;[[Bill Joy]], [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.04/joy_pr.html Why the future doesn't need us]. [[Wired magazine]].&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its exceptional scheduling and organizational capability and the range of novel technologies it could develop, it is possible that the first Earth superintelligence to emerge could rapidly become matchless and unrivaled: conceivably it would be able to bring about almost any possible outcome, and be able to foil virtually any attempt that threatened to prevent it achieving its objectives.&lt;ref name="Bostrom"&gt;[[Nick Bostrom]] 2002 [http://www.nickbostrom.com/ethics/ai.html "Ethical Issues in Advanced Artificial Intelligence"]&lt;/ref&gt; It could eliminate, wiping out if it chose, any other challenging rival intellects; alternatively it might manipulate or persuade them to change their behavior towards its own interests, or it may merely obstruct their attempts at interference.&lt;ref name="Bostrom" /&gt; In Bostrom's book, ''[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]]'', he defines this as the control problem.&lt;ref name="Bostrom2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Bostrom |first=Nick |date= |title=[[Superintelligence: Paths, Dangers, Strategies]] |url= |location= |publisher= |page= |isbn= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Physicist [[Stephen Hawking]], [[Microsoft]] founder [[Bill Gates]] and [[SpaceX]] founder [[Elon Musk]] have echoed these concerns, with Hawking theorizing that this could "spell the end of the human race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rawlinson|first1=Kevin|title=Microsoft's Bill Gates insists AI is a threat|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/31047780|publisher=[[BBC News]]|accessdate=30 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2009, the [[Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence]] (AAAI) hosted a conference to discuss whether computers and robots might be able to acquire any sort of [[autonomy]], and how much these abilities might pose a threat or hazard. They noted that some robots have acquired various forms of semi-autonomy, including being able to find power sources on their own and being able to independently choose targets to attack with weapons. They also noted that some computer viruses can evade elimination and have achieved "cockroach intelligence." They noted that self-awareness as depicted in science-fiction is probably unlikely, but that there were other potential hazards and pitfalls.&lt;ref name="nytimes july09"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2009/07/26/science/26robot.html?_r=1&amp;ref=todayspaper Scientists Worry Machines May Outsmart Man] By JOHN MARKOFF, NY Times, July 26, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Various media sources and scientific groups have noted separate trends in differing areas which might together result in greater robotic functionalities and autonomy, and which pose some inherent concerns.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2218834/ Gaming the Robot Revolution: A military technology expert weighs in on Terminator: Salvation]., By P.

A survey of AI experts estimated that the chance of human-level machine learning having an "extremely bad (e.g., human extinction)" long-term effect on humanity is 5%.&lt;ref name="AI survey"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Grace |first1=Katja |title=When Will AI Exceed Human Performance?

Since people base their judgments of artificial intelligence on their own experience, he claims that they underestimate the potential power of AI.&lt;ref name="Yudkowsky"&gt;{{cite web|last=Yudkowsky|first=Eliezer|title=Artificial Intelligence as a Positive and Negative Factor in Global Risk|url=http://yudkowsky.net/singularity/ai-risk|accessdate=26 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Biotechnology====
{{Main|Biotechnology risk}}
Biotechnology can pose a global catastrophic risk in the form of bioengineered organisms ([[virus]]es, [[bacteria]], [[fungi]], [[plant]]s or [[animal]]s). In many cases the organism will be a [[pathogen]] of humans, [[livestock]], crops or other organisms we depend upon (e.g. [[pollinator]]s or [[Gut flora|gut bacteria]]). However, any organism able to catastrophically disrupt [[ecosystem function]]s, e.g. highly competitive [[weed]]s, outcompeting essential crops, poses a biotechnology risk.

A biotechnology catastrophe may be caused by accidentally releasing a genetically engineered organism escaping from controlled environments, by the planned release of such an organism which then turns out to have unforeseen and catastrophic interactions with essential natural or agro-ecosystems, or by intentional usage of [[biological agent]]s in [[biological warfare]], [[bioterrorism]] attacks.&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" &gt;{{cite book|author1=Ali Noun|author2=Christopher F. Chyba|editor1-last=Bostrom|editor1-first=Nick|editor2-last=Cirkovic|editor2-first=Milan M.|title=Global Catastrophic Risks|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|chapter=Chapter 20: Biotechnology and biosecurity}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pathogens may be intentionally or unintentionally genetically modified to change virulence and other characteristics.&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" /&gt; For example, a group of Australian researchers unintentionally changed characteristics of the [[mousepox]] virus while trying to develop a virus to sterilize rodents.&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" /&gt; The modified virus became highly lethal even in vaccinated and naturally resistant mice.&lt;ref name = "Sandberg xrisk"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sandberg|first1=Anders|title=The five biggest threats to human existence|url=http://theconversation.com/the-five-biggest-threats-to-human-existence-27053|website=theconversation.com|accessdate=13 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="mousepoxstudy" &gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=Ronald J.|last2=Ramsay|first2=Alistair J.|last3=Christensen|first3=Carina D.|last4=Beaton|first4=Sandra|last5=Hall|first5=Diana F.|last6=Ramshaw|first6=Ian A.|title=Expression of Mouse Interleukin-4 by a Recombinant Ectromelia Virus Suppresses Cytolytic Lymphocyte Responses and Overcomes Genetic Resistance to Mousepox|journal=Journal of Virology|date=2001|volume=75|issue=3|pages=1205–1210|url=http://jvi.asm.org/content/75/3/1205.long|accessdate=13 July 2014|doi=10.1128/jvi.75.3.1205-1210.2001|pmid=11152493|pmc=114026}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technological means to genetically modify virus characteristics are likely to become more widely available in the future if not properly regulated.&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" /&gt;

[[terrorism|Terrorist]] applications of biotechnology have historically been infrequent. To what extent this is due to a lack of capabilities or motivation is not resolved.&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" /&gt; However, given current development, more risk from novel, engineered pathogens is to be expected in the future.&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" /&gt; Exponential growth has been observed in the [[biotechnology]] sector, and Noun and Chyba predict that this will lead to major increases in biotechnological capabilities in the coming decades.&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" /&gt; They argue that risks from [[biological warfare]] and [[bioterrorism]] are distinct from nuclear and chemical threats because biological pathogens are easier to mass-produce and their production is hard to control (especially as the technological capabilities are becoming available even to individual users).&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" /&gt; A survey by the Future of Humanity Institute estimated a 2% probability of extinction from engineered pandemics by 2100.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Noun and Chyba propose three categories of measures to reduce risks from biotechnology and natural pandemics: Regulation or prevention of potentially dangerous research, improved recognition of outbreaks and developing facilities to mitigate disease outbreaks (e.g. better and/or more widely distributed vaccines).&lt;ref name="GCRs bio-chapter" /&gt;

====Cyberattack====
{{Main|Cyberattack}}
Cyberattacks have the potential to destroy everything from personal data to electric grids. [[Christine Peterson]], co-founder and past president of the [[Foresight Institute]], believes a cyberattack on electric grids has the potential to be a catastrophic risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://newsroom.ucla.edu/stories/scholars-assess-existential-and-catastrophic-risks-to-humanity |title=Scholars assess threats to civilization, life on Earth |publisher=UCLA |author=UCLA Engineering |date=June 28, 2017 |accessdate=June 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global warming====
{{Main|Effects of global warming|Runaway climate change}}
[[Global warming]] refers to the warming caused by human technology since the 19th century or earlier.&lt;!--see Global_warming#Etymology--&gt; Projections of future climate change suggest further global warming, [[sea level rise]], and an increase in the frequency and severity of some extreme weather events and weather-related disasters. Effects of global warming include [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]], stresses to existing food-producing systems, increased spread of known infectious diseases such as malaria, and rapid mutation of [[microorganisms]]. In November 2017, a statement by 15,364 scientists from 184 countries indicated that increasing levels of greenhouse gases from use of fossil fuels, human population growth, deforestation, and overuse of land for agricultural production, particularly by farming [[ruminant]]s for meat consumption, are trending in ways that forecast an increase in human misery over coming decades.&lt;ref name=world/&gt;

URL accessed March 10, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[Western honeybee]]. As the bee plays a vital role in pollination, its extinction would severely disrupt the [[food chain]].

An October 2017 report published in [[The Lancet]] stated that toxic air, [[water pollution|water]], [[soil pollution|soils]], and workplaces were collectively responsible for 9 million deaths worldwide in 2015, particularly from [[air pollution]] which was linked to deaths by increasing susceptibility to non-infectious diseases, such as [[heart disease]], [[stroke]], and [[lung cancer]].&lt;ref name="carrington"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carrington|first1=Damian|title=Global pollution kills 9m a year and threatens 'survival of human societies'|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/oct/19/global-pollution-kills-millions-threatens-survival-human-societies|accessdate=20 October 2017|publisher=The Guardian|date=20 October 2017|location=London, UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; The report warned that the pollution crisis was exceeding "the envelope on the amount of pollution the Earth can carry" and “threatens the continuing survival of human societies”.&lt;ref name=carrington/&gt;

====Mineral resource exhaustion====
[[Romanian American]] economist [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen]], a [[List of people considered father or mother of a scientific field|progenitor]] in [[economics]] and the [[Paradigm shift#Kuhnian paradigm shifts|paradigm founder]] of [[ecological economics]], has argued that the [[Sustainability#Carrying capacity|carrying capacity]] of Earth — that is, Earth's capacity to sustain human populations and consumption levels — is bound to decrease sometime in the future as Earth's finite stock of [[Mineral|mineral resources]] is presently being extracted and put to use; and consequently, that the [[world economy]] as a whole is heading towards an [[Nicholas Georgescu-Roegen#Population pressure, mineral resource exhaustion and the end of mankind|inevitable future collapse, leading to the demise of human civilization itself]].&lt;ref name=ngr01/&gt;{{rp|303f}} Ecological economist and [[Steady-state economy#Herman Daly's concept of a steady-state economy|steady-state theorist]] [[Herman Daly]], a student of Georgescu-Roegen, has [[Steady-state economy#Daly's credo|propounded the same argument]] by asserting that "... all we can do is to avoid wasting the limited capacity of [[Genesis creation narrative|creation]] to support present and future life [on Earth]."&lt;ref name=hd01/&gt;{{rp|370}}

Ever since Georgescu-Roegen and Daly published these views, various scholars in the field have been discussing the existential impossibility of allocating earth's finite stock of mineral resources evenly among an unknown number of present and future generations. This number of generations is likely to remain unknown to us, as there is no way — or only little way — of knowing in advance if or when [[Human extinction|mankind will ultimately face extinction]]. In effect, ''any'' conceivable intertemporal allocation of the stock will inevitably end up with universal economic decline at some future point.&lt;ref name=jr01/&gt;{{rp|253–256}} &lt;ref name=kb01/&gt;{{rp|165}} &lt;ref name=jm01/&gt;{{rp|168–171}} &lt;ref name=jg01/&gt;{{rp|150–153}} &lt;ref name=js01/&gt;{{rp|106–109}} &lt;ref name=ck01/&gt;{{rp|546–549}} &lt;ref name=ap01/&gt;{{rp|142–145}}

[[Biotechnology]] could lead to the creation of a [[pandemic]], [[chemical warfare]] could be taken to an extreme, [[nanotechnology]] could lead to [[grey goo]] in which out-of-control [[self replication|self-replicating]] robots consume all living matter on earth while building more of themselves—in both cases, either deliberately or by accident.&lt;ref name="drexler"&gt;[[Eric Drexler]], [[Engines of Creation]], {{ISBN|0-385-19973-2}}, [http://www.foresight.org/EOC/ available online]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Nanotechnology====
{{See also|Grey goo|Potential risks of nanotechnology}}
Many nanoscale technologies are in development or currently in use.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Chris Phoenix|author2=Mike Treder|editor1-last=Bostrom|editor1-first=Nick|editor2-last=Cirkovic|editor2-first=Milan M.|title=Global catastrophic risks|date=2008|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-857050-9|chapter=Chapter 21: Nanotechnology as global catastrophic risk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only one that appears to pose a significant global catastrophic risk is [[molecular manufacturing]], a technique that would make it possible to build complex structures at atomic precision.&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"&gt;{{cite web|title=Frequently Asked Questions - Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.foresight.org/nano/whatismm.html|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Molecular manufacturing requires significant advances in nanotechnology, but once achieved could produce highly advanced products at low costs and in large quantities in nanofactories of desktop proportions.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Foresight nano FAQ"/&gt; When nanofactories gain the ability to produce other nanofactories, production may only be limited by relatively abundant factors such as input materials, energy and software.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

Molecular manufacturing could be used to cheaply produce, among many other products, highly advanced, durable weapons.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; Being equipped with compact computers and motors these could be increasingly autonomous and have a large range of capabilities.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

[[Chris Phoenix (nanotechnologist)|Chris Phoenix]] and Treder classify catastrophic risks posed by nanotechnology into three categories:
# From augmenting the development of other technologies such as AI and biotechnology.
# By enabling mass-production of potentially dangerous products that cause risk dynamics (such as arms races) depending on how they are used.
# From uncontrolled self-perpetuating processes with destructive effects.

Several researchers state that the bulk of risk from nanotechnology comes from the potential to lead to war, arms races and destructive global government.&lt;ref name ="Sandberg xrisk"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=A Dialog on Dangers|url=http://www.foresight.org/Updates/Background3.html#DangerDialog|website=foresight.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several reasons have been suggested why the availability of nanotech weaponry may with significant likelihood lead to unstable arms races (compared to e.g. nuclear arms races):
# A large number of players may be tempted to enter the race since the threshold for doing so is low;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;
# The ability to make weapons with molecular manufacturing will be cheap and easy to hide;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; 
# Therefore, lack of insight into the other parties' capabilities can tempt players to arm out of caution or to launch preemptive strikes;&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Drexler|first1=Eric|title=ENGINES OF DESTRUCTION (Chapter 11)|url=http://e-drexler.com/d/06/00/EOC/EOC_Chapter_11.html|website=e-drexler.com|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Molecular manufacturing may reduce dependency on international trade,&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; a potential peace-promoting factor;
# [[Wars of aggression]] may pose a smaller economic threat to the aggressor since manufacturing is cheap and humans may not be needed on the battlefield.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;

Since self-regulation by all state and non-state actors seems hard to achieve,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dangers of Molecular Manufacturing|url=http://www.crnano.org/dangers.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; measures to mitigate war-related risks have mainly been proposed in the area of [[Multilateralism|international cooperation]].&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "crnano int control"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Need for International Control|url=http://www.crnano.org/int_control.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; International infrastructure may be expanded giving more sovereignty to the international level. This could help coordinate efforts for arms control. International institutions dedicated specifically to nanotechnology (perhaps analogously to the International Atomic Energy Agency [[IAEA]]) or general arms control may also be designed.&lt;ref name = "crnano int control"/&gt; One may also jointly make [[Differential technological development|differential technological progress]] on defensive technologies, a policy that players should usually favour.&lt;ref name= "GCRs nano-chapter"/&gt; The Center for Responsible Nanotechnology also suggests some technical restrictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Restrictions May Make Nanotechnology Safer|url=http://www.crnano.org/restrictions.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Improved transparency regarding technological capabilities may be another important facilitator for arms-control.

[[Grey goo]] is another catastrophic scenario, which was proposed by [[K. Eric Drexler|Eric Drexler]] in his 1986 book ''[[Engines of Creation]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Apocalypse 2012 |last= Joseph |first= Lawrence E. |date= 2007 |publisher= Broadway |location= New York |isbn= 978-0-7679-2448-1 |page= 6 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and has been a theme in mainstream media and fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/3788673.stm| title=Nanotech guru turns back on 'goo'| publisher= BBC News|accessdate=2012-03-30|first=Paul|last=Rincon|date=2004-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hapgood |first=Fred |date=November 1986 |title=Nanotechnology: Molecular Machines that Mimic Life |url=http://metamodern.com/b/wp-content/uploads/docs/OMNI_TINYTECH.pdf |journal=Omni |accessdate=19 July 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This scenario involves tiny [[Self-replicating machine|self-replicating robots]] that consume the entire biosphere using it as a source of energy and building blocks. Nowadays, however, nanotech experts—including Drexler—discredit the scenario. According to Phoenix, a "so-called grey goo could only be the product of a deliberate and difficult engineering process, not an accident".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Leading nanotech experts put 'grey goo' in perspective|url=http://www.crnano.org/PR-IOP.htm|website=crnano.org|accessdate=19 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Warfare and mass destruction====

The scenarios that have been explored most frequently are nuclear warfare and [[doomsday device]]s. Although the probability of a [[nuclear war]] per year is slim, Professor [[Martin Hellman]] has described it as inevitable in the long run; unless the probability approaches zero, inevitably there will come a day when civilization's luck runs out.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-ee.stanford.edu/~hellman/opinion/inevitability.html "On the Probability of Nuclear War"] by Martin E. Hellman&lt;/ref&gt; During the Cuban missile crisis, U.S. president [[John F. Kennedy]] estimated the odds of nuclear war at "somewhere between one out of three and even".&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books |title=Nuclear Weapons and the Future of Humanity: The Fundamental Questions by Avner Cohen, Steven Lee |id=gYmPp6lZqtMC |page=237 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States and Russia have a combined [[arsenal]] of 14,700 [[nuclear weapons]],&lt;ref name=FASNukes /&gt; and there is an estimated total of 15,700 nuclear weapons in existence worldwide.&lt;ref name=FASNukes&gt;{{cite web|author1=Federation of American Scientists |title=Status of World Nuclear Forces |url=https://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/ |website=Federation of American Scientists |accessdate=4 June 2015 |date=28 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150618103342/http://fas.org/issues/nuclear-weapons/status-world-nuclear-forces/ |archivedate=18 June 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond nuclear, other military threats to humanity include [[biological warfare]] (BW). By contrast, [[chemical warfare]], while able to create multiple local catastrophes, is unlikely to create a global one.

Nuclear war could yield unprecedented human [[death tolls]] and [[habitat destruction]]. Detonating large numbers of nuclear weapons would have an immediate, short term and long-term effects on the climate, causing [[nuclear winter|cold weather]] and reduced sunlight and [[photosynthesis]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://climate.envsci.rutgers.edu/pdf/acp-7-1973-2007.pdf "Atmospheric effects and societal consequences of regional-scale nuclear conflicts and acts of individual nuclear terrorism"], [[Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics]]&lt;/ref&gt; that may generate significant upheaval in advanced civilizations.&lt;ref name="nuclearwinter"&gt;Bostrom 2002, section 4.2.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while popular perception sometimes takes nuclear war as "the end of the world", experts assign low probability to human extinction from nuclear war.&lt;ref name=Martin1982&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Martin|first1=Brian|title=Critique of nuclear extinction|journal=Journal of Peace Research|date=1982|volume=19|issue=4|pages=287–300|doi=10.1177/002234338201900401|url=http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/82jpr.html|accessdate=25 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Shulman2012&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shulman|first1=Carl|title=Nuclear winter and human extinction: Q&amp;A with Luke Oman|url=http://www.overcomingbias.com/2012/11/nuclear-winter-and-human-extinction-qa-with-luke-oman.html|website=Overcoming Bias|accessdate=25 October 2014|date=5 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1982, [[Brian Martin (social scientist)|Brian Martin]] estimated that a US–Soviet nuclear exchange might kill 400–450 million directly, mostly in the United States, Europe and Russia, and maybe several hundred million more through follow-up consequences in those same areas.&lt;ref name=Martin1982 /&gt; A survey by the Future of Humanity Institute estimated a 4% probability of extinction from warfare by 2100, with a 1% chance of extinction from nuclear warfare.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

====World population and agricultural crisis====

The 20th century saw a rapid increase in [[human population]] due to [[History of medicine#Modern medicine|medical developments]] and massive increases in agricultural productivity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/4994590.stm |title=The end of India's green revolution? |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-05-29 |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the [[Green Revolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=April 8th, 2000 by admin |url=http://www.foodfirst.org/media/opeds/2000/4-greenrev.html |title=Food First/Institute for Food and Development Policy |publisher=Foodfirst.org |date=2000-04-08 |accessdate=2012-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090714215036/http://www.foodfirst.org/media/opeds/2000/4-greenrev.html |archivedate=July 14, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1950 and 1984, as the Green Revolution transformed agriculture around the globe, world grain production increased by 250%. The Green Revolution in agriculture helped food production to keep pace with worldwide [[population growth]] or actually enabled population growth. The energy for the Green Revolution was provided by fossil fuels in the form of fertilizers (natural gas), pesticides (oil), and [[hydrocarbon]]-fueled [[irrigation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html |title=How peak oil could lead to starvation |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2009-05-27 |accessdate=2012-01-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090527161626/http://wolf.readinglitho.co.uk/mainpages/agriculture.html |archivedate=May 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; David Pimentel, professor of ecology and agriculture at [[Cornell University]], and Mario Giampietro, senior researcher at the National Research Institute on Food and Nutrition (INRAN), place in their 1994 study ''Food, Land, Population and the U.S. Economy'' the maximum U.S. population for a [[sustainability|sustainable economy]] at 200 million. To achieve a sustainable economy and avert disaster, the United States must reduce its population by at least one-third, and world population will have to be reduced by two-thirds, says the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.energybulletin.net/node/281 |title=Eating Fossil Fuels |publisher=EnergyBulletin.net |date=2003-10-02 |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors of this study believe that the mentioned agricultural crisis will begin to have an effect on the world after 2020, and will become critical after 2050. Geologist [[Dale Allen Pfeiffer]] claims that coming decades could see spiraling food prices without relief and massive starvation on a global level such as never experienced before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=The Oil Drum: Europe |url=http://europe.theoildrum.com/node/2225 |title=Agriculture Meets Peak Oil |publisher=Europe.theoildrum.com |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uncommonthought.com/mtblog/archives/2007/11/08/drawing-momentu.php "Drawing Momentum from the Crash"] by Dale Allen Pfeiffer&lt;/ref&gt;

Wheat is humanity's third-most-produced cereal.

Little or no treatment is possible and infection spreads on the wind. Should the world's large grain-producing areas become infected, the ensuing crisis in wheat availability would lead to price spikes and shortages in other food products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wheatrust.cornell.edu/about/ |title=Durable Rust Resistance in Wheat |publisher=Wheatrust.cornell.edu |accessdate=2012-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although evidence of alien life has never been documented, scientists such as [[Carl Sagan]] have postulated that the existence of extraterrestrial life is very likely. In 1969, the "[[Extra-Terrestrial Exposure Law]]" was added to the United States [[Code of Federal Regulations]] (Title 14, Section 1211) in response to the possibility of biological contamination resulting from the [[Apollo program|U.S. Apollo Space Program]]. It was removed in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snopes.com/legal/et.htm Urban Legends Reference Pages: Legal Affairs (E.T. Make Bail)]&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists consider such a scenario technically possible, but unlikely.&lt;ref name="aliensunlikely"&gt;Bostrom 2002, section 7.2&lt;/ref&gt;

An article in ''[[The New York Times]]'' discussed the possible threats for humanity of intentionally sending messages aimed at extraterrestrial life into the cosmos in the context of the [[Search for extraterrestrial intelligence|SETI]] efforts. Several renowned public figures such as Stephen Hawking and Elon Musk have argued against sending such messages on the grounds that extraterrestrial civilizations with technology are probably far more advanced than humanity and could pose an existential threat to humanity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/28/magazine/greetings-et-please-dont-murder-us.html|title=Greetings, E.T.

====Natural climate change====
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2018}}
[[Climate change]] refers to a lasting change in the Earth's climate. The climate has ranged from ice ages to warmer periods when palm trees grew in Antarctica. It has been hypothesized that there was also a period called "[[snowball Earth]]" when all the oceans were covered in a layer of ice. These global climatic changes occurred slowly, prior to the rise of human civilization about 10 thousand years ago near the end of the last [[Ice Age#Major Ice Ages|Major Ice Age]] when the climate became more stable. However, [[abrupt climate change]] on the decade time scale has occurred regionally. Since civilization originated during a period of stable climate, a natural variation into a new climate regime (colder or hotter) could pose a threat to civilization.

In the history of the Earth, many [[Ice Age|ice ages]] are known to have occurred. More ice ages will be possible at an interval of 40,000–100,000 years. An ice age would have a serious impact on civilization because vast areas of land (mainly in North America, Europe, and Asia) could become uninhabitable. It would still be possible to live in the tropical regions, but with possible loss of humidity and water. Currently, the world is in an [[Interglacial|interglacial period]] within a much older glacial event. The last glacial expansion ended about 10,000 years ago, and all civilizations evolved later than this. Scientists do not predict that a natural ice age will occur anytime soon. This may be due to manmade emissions potentially delaying the possible onset or another ice age for at least another 50,000 years.

====Cosmic threats====
A number of astronomical threats have been identified. Massive objects, e.g. a star, large planet or [[black hole]], could be catastrophic if a close encounter occurred in the Solar System. In April 2008, it was announced that two simulations of long-term planetary movement, one at the [[Paris Observatory]] and the other at the [[University of California, Santa Cruz]], indicate a 1% chance that [[Mercury (planet)|Mercury]]'s orbit could be made unstable by Jupiter's gravitational pull sometime during the lifespan of the Sun. Were this to happen, the simulations suggest a collision with Earth could be one of four possible outcomes (the others being Mercury colliding with the Sun, colliding with Venus, or being ejected from the Solar System altogether). If Mercury were to collide with Earth, all life on Earth could be obliterated entirely: an asteroid 15&amp;nbsp;km wide is believed to have caused the extinction of the non-avian dinosaurs, whereas Mercury is 4,879&amp;nbsp;km in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;Ken Croswell, [http://www.skyandtelescope.com/news/home/18103199.html Will Mercury Hit Earth Someday?], Skyandtelescope.com April 24, 2008, accessed April 26, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Another cosmic threat is a [[Gamma-ray burst#Rate of occurrence and potential effects on life on Earth|gamma-ray burst]], typically produced by a [[supernova]] when a star collapses inward on itself and then "bounces" outward in a massive explosion. Under certain circumstances, these events are thought to produce massive bursts of gamma radiation emanating outward from the axis of rotation of the star. If such an event were to occur oriented towards the Earth, the massive amounts of gamma radiation could significantly affect the Earth's atmosphere and pose an existential threat to all life. Such a gamma-ray burst may have been the cause of the [[Ordovician–Silurian extinction events]]. Neither this scenario nor the destabilization of Mercury's orbit are likely in the foreseeable future.&lt;ref name="unlikely"&gt;Bostrom 2002, section 4.7&lt;/ref&gt;

If the Solar System were to pass through a [[dark nebula]], a cloud of [[cosmic dust]], severe global climate change would occur.&lt;ref name="Galacticdust"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Fraser Cain| title=Local Galactic Dust is on the Rise | url=http://www.universetoday.com/2003/08/04/local-galactic-dust-is-on-the-rise/ | journal=Universe Today | date=2003-08-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A powerful [[solar flare]] or solar superstorm, which is a drastic and unusual decrease or increase in the Sun's power output, could have severe consequences for life on Earth.{{Cn|date=August 2018}}

If our universe lies within a [[false vacuum]], a bubble of lower-energy vacuum could come to exist by chance or otherwise in our universe, and catalyze the conversion of our universe to a lower energy state in a volume expanding at nearly the speed of light, destroying all that we know without forewarning.&lt;ref name="colemandeluccia"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Sidney |last1=Coleman |first2=Frank |last2=De Luccia |title=Gravitational effects on and of vacuum decay |url=http://www.sns.ias.edu/pitp2/2011files/PhysRevD.21.3305.pdf |journal=Physical Review D |date=1980-06-15 |volume=D21 |number=12 |pages=3305–3315 |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.21.3305 |bibcode=1980PhRvD..21.3305C }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Elucidate|date=July 2015}} Such an occurrence is called [[False_vacuum#Vacuum_decay|vacuum decay]].

====Geomagnetic reversal====
{{Main|Geomagnetic reversal}}
The magnetic poles of the Earth shifted many times in geologic history. The duration of such a shift is still debated. Theories exist that during such times, the [[Earth's magnetic field]] would be substantially weakened, threatening civilization by allowing radiation from the Sun, especially [[solar wind]], [[solar flare]]s or [[cosmic radiation]], to reach the surface. These theories have been somewhat discredited, as statistical analysis shows no evidence for a correlation between past reversals and past extinctions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plotnick|first=Roy E.|title=Relationship between biological extinctions and geomagnetic reversals|journal=Geology|date=1 January 1980|volume=8|issue=12|page=578|doi=10.1130/0091-7613(1980)8&lt;578:RBBEAG&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1980Geo.....8..578P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glassmeier2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glassmeier|first=Karl-Heinz|author2=Vogt, Joachim|title=Magnetic Polarity Transitions and Biospheric Effects|journal=Space Science Reviews|date=29 May 2010|volume=155|issue=1–4|pages=387–410|doi=10.1007/s11214-010-9659-6|bibcode = 2010SSRv..155..387G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Global pandemic====
{{Main|Pandemic}}
Numerous historical examples of pandemics&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.postapocalypticsurvival.com/apocalypse-causing-diseases/ |title=Near Apocalypse Causing Diseases, a Historical Look:|publisher=postapocalypticsurvival.com |accessdate=2012-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; had a devastating effect on a large number of people. The present, unprecedented scale and speed of human movement make it more difficult than ever to contain an epidemic through local [[quarantine]]s. A global pandemic has become a realistic threat to human civilization.

Naturally [[evolution|evolving]] pathogens will ultimately develop an upper limit to their virulence.&lt;ref name="Frank SA 1996 37–78"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Frank SA |title=Models of parasite virulence |url=http://sites.biology.duke.edu/rausher/Frank.pdf |journal=Q Rev Biol |volume=71 |issue=1 |pages=37–78 |date=March 1996 |pmid=8919665 |doi=10.1086/419267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pathogens with the highest virulence, quickly killing their hosts reduce their chances of spread the infection to new hosts or carriers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Brown NF, Wickham ME, Coombes BK, Finlay BB |title=Crossing the Line: Selection and Evolution of Virulence Traits |journal=[[PLoS Pathogens]] |volume=2 |issue=5 |pages=e42 |date=May 2006 |pmid=16733541 |pmc=1464392 |doi=10.1371/journal.ppat.0020042}}&lt;/ref&gt; This simple model predicts that - if [[virulence]] and transmission are not genetically linked - pathogens will evolve towards low virulence and rapid transmission. However, this is not necessarily a safeguard against a global catastrophe, for the following reasons:

1. The fitness advantage of limited virulence is primarily a function of a limited number of hosts. Any pathogen with a high virulence, high transmission rate and long incubation time may have already caused a catastrophic pandemic before ultimately virulence is limited through natural selection.
2. In models where virulence level and rate of transmission are related, high levels of virulence can evolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ebert D, Bull JJ |title=Challenging the trade-off model for the evolution of virulence: is virulence management feasible? |journal=Trends Microbiol. |volume=11 |issue=1 |pages=15–20 |date=January 2003 |pmid=12526850 |doi=10.1016/S0966-842X(02)00003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Virulence is instead limited by the existence of complex populations of hosts with different susceptibilities to infection, or by some hosts being geographically isolated.&lt;ref name="Frank SA 1996 37–78"/&gt; The size of the host population and competition between different strains of pathogens can also alter virulence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=André JB, Hochberg ME |title=Virulence evolution in emerging infectious diseases |journal=Evolution |volume=59 |issue=7 |pages=1406–12 |date=July 2005 |pmid=16153027 |doi=10.1554/05-111}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
3. A pathogen that infects humans as a secondary host and primarily infects another species (a [[zoonosis]]) has no constraints on its virulence in people, since the accidental secondary infections do not affect its evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gandon S |title=Evolution of multihost parasites |journal=Evolution |volume=58 |issue=3 |pages=455–69 |date=March 2004 |pmid=15119430 |doi=10.1111/j.0014-3820.2004.tb01669.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Volcanism====
{{Main|Supervolcano}}
A geological event such as massive [[flood basalt]], volcanism, or the eruption of a supervolcano&lt;ref name="supervolcano"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Kate Ravilious | title=What a way to go | url=https://www.theguardian.com/science/2005/apr/14/research.science2 | journal=The Guardian | date=2005-04-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; could lead to a so-called volcanic winter, similar to a [[nuclear winter]]. One such event, the [[Toba eruption]],&lt;ref name="Tobaeruption"&gt;{{cite journal|author=2012 Admin |title=Toba Supervolcano |url=http://www.2012finalfantasy.com/2008/toba-supervolcano.php |journal=2012 Final Fantasy |date=2008-02-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100822033436/http://www.2012finalfantasy.com/2008/toba-supervolcano.php |archivedate=2010-08-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; occurred in Indonesia about 71,500 years ago. According to the [[Toba catastrophe theory]],&lt;ref name="Tobacatastrophetheory"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Science Reference | title=Toba Catastrophe Theory | url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/articles/t/toba_catastrophe_theory.htm | journal=Science Daily }}&lt;/ref&gt; the event may have reduced human populations to only a few tens of thousands of individuals. [[Yellowstone Caldera]] is another such supervolcano, having undergone 142 or more [[caldera]]-forming eruptions in the past 17 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Breining|title=Super Volcano: The Ticking Time Bomb Beneath Yellowstone National Park|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YmD0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA9|date=10 November 2007|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-61673-898-3|chapter=The Next Big Blast}}&lt;/ref&gt;
A massive volcano eruption would eject extraordinary volumes of volcanic dust, toxic and greenhouse gases into the atmosphere with serious effects on global climate (towards extreme global cooling:  [[volcanic winter]] if short-term, and ice age if long-term) or [[global warming]] (if greenhouse gases were to prevail).

When the supervolcano at [[Yellowstone National Park|Yellowstone]] last erupted 640,000 years ago, the thinnest layers of the ash ejected from the [[Yellowstone Caldera|caldera]] spread over most of the United States west of the [[Mississippi River]] and part of northeastern Mexico. The [[magma]] covered much of what is now Yellowstone National Park and extended beyond, covering much of the ground from Yellowstone River in the east to the Idaho falls in the west, with some of the flows extending north beyond Mammoth Springs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Breining|title=Super Volcano: The Ticking Time Bomb Beneath Yellowstone National Park|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YmD0AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA14|date=10 November 2007|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-1-61673-898-3|chapter=Distant Death}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a recent study, if the Yellowstone caldera erupted again as a supervolcano, an ash layer one to three millimeters thick could be deposited as far away as New York, enough to "reduce traction on roads and runways, short out electrical transformers and cause respiratory problems". There would be centimeters of thickness over much of the U.S. Midwest, enough to disrupt crops and livestock, especially if it happened at a critical time in the growing season. The worst-affected city would likely be [[Billings, Montana]], population 109,000, which the model predicted would be covered with ash estimated as 1.03 to 1.8 meters thick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Modeling the Ash Distribution of a Yellowstone Supereruption|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/yellowstone/faqs_ash3d.html|publisher=USGS Volcanic Observatory}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main long-term effect is through global climate change, which reduces the temperature globally by about 5–15 degrees C for a decade, together with the direct effects of the deposits of ash on their crops. A large supervolcano like Toba would deposit one or two meters thickness of ash over an area of several million square kilometers.(1000 cubic kilometers is equivalent to a one-meter thickness of ash spread over a million square kilometers). If that happened in some densely populated agricultural area, such as India, it could destroy one or two seasons of crops for two billion people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Extreme Geohazards:  Reducing the Disaster Risk  and Increasing Resilience|url=https://hazdoc.colorado.edu/bitstream/handle/10590/4136/C024175.pdf|publisher=European Space Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Yellowstone shows no signs of a supereruption at present, and it is not certain that a future supereruption will occur there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Questions About Future Volcanic Activity at Yellowstone|url=https://volcanoes.usgs.gov/volcanoes/yellowstone/faqs_future_activity.html|website=USGA Volcanic Observatory FAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Steam Explosions, Earthquakes, and Volcanic Eruptions—What’s in Yellowstone’s Future?|url=https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2005/3024/|website=USGS Yellowstone Volcanic Observatory|quote=The USGS puts it like this:      “If another large caldera-forming eruption were to occur at Yellowstone, its effects would be worldwide. Thick ash deposits would bury vast areas of the United States, and injection of huge volumes of volcanic gases into the atmosphere could drastically affect global climate. Fortunately, the Yellowstone volcanic system shows no signs that it is headed toward such an eruption. The probability of a large caldera-forming eruption within the next few thousand years is exceedingly low.”}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Research published in 2011 finds evidence that massive volcanic eruptions caused massive coal combustion, supporting models for significant generation of greenhouse gases. Researchers have suggested that massive volcanic eruptions through coal beds in Siberia would generate significant greenhouse gases and cause a [[runaway greenhouse effect]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2011/01/110123131014.htm |title=World's biggest extinction event: Massive volcanic eruption, burning coal and accelerated greenhouse gas choked out life -- ScienceDaily |newspaper=Https: |date=  |author= |accessdate= 28 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Massive eruptions can also throw enough pyroclastic debris and other material into the atmosphere to partially block out the sun and cause a [[volcanic winter]], as happened on a smaller scale in 1816 following the eruption of [[Mount Tambora]], the so-called [[Year Without a Summer]]. Such an eruption might cause the immediate deaths of millions of people several hundred miles from the eruption, and perhaps billions of deaths&lt;ref name="Supervolcano"&gt;{{cite book|last=Breining|first=Greg|title=Super Volcano: The Ticking Time Bomb Beneath Yellowstone National Park|publisher=Voyageur Press|location=St. Paul, MN.|date=2007|chapter=The Next Big Blast|isbn=978-0-7603-2925-2|page=256 pg}}&lt;/ref&gt; worldwide, due to the failure of the [[monsoon]]{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}, resulting in major crop failures causing starvation on a profound scale.&lt;ref name="Supervolcano" /&gt;

A much more speculative concept is the [[verneshot]]: a hypothetical volcanic eruption caused by the buildup of gas deep underneath a [[craton]]. Such an event may be forceful enough to launch an extreme amount of material from the [[crust (geology)|crust]] and [[mantle (geology)|mantle]] into a [[sub-orbital]] trajectory.

==Proposed mitigation==
[[Planetary management]] and respecting [[planetary boundaries]] have been proposed as approaches to preventing ecological catastrophes. Within the scope of these approaches, the field of [[climate engineering|geoengineering]] encompasses the deliberate large-scale engineering and manipulation of the planetary environment to combat or counteract anthropogenic changes in atmospheric chemistry. [[Space colonization]] is a [[Space and survival|proposed alternative]] to improve the odds of surviving an extinction scenario.&lt;ref name=physorg20100809&gt;{{citation

More speculatively, if society continues to function and if the biosphere remains habitable, calorie needs for the present human population might in theory be met during an extended absence of sunlight, given sufficient advance planning.

=== Global catastrophic risks and global governance ===
Insufficient [[global governance]] creates risks in the social and political domain, but the governance mechanisms develop more slowly than technological and social change. There are concerns from governments, the private sector, as well as the general public about the lack of governance mechanisms to efficiently deal with risks, negotiate and adjudicate between diverse and conflicting interests. This is further underlined by an understanding of the interconnectedness of global systemic risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://globalchallenges.org/en/our-work/quarterly-reports/resetting-the-frame/understanding-global-systemic-risk|title=Global Challenges Foundation {{!}} Understanding Global Systemic Risk|website=globalchallenges.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-08-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizations==
The [[Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists]] (est. 1945) is one of the oldest global risk organizations, founded after the public became alarmed by the potential of atomic warfare in the aftermath of WWII. It studies risks associated with nuclear war and energy and famously maintains the [[Doomsday Clock]] established in 1947. The [[Foresight Institute]] (est. 1986) examines the risks of nanotechnology and its benefits. It was one of the earliest organizations to study the unintended consequences of otherwise harmless technology gone haywire at a global scale. It was founded by [[K. Eric Drexler]] who postulated "[[grey goo]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://metamodern.com/b/wp-content/uploads/docs/OMNI_TINYTECH.pdf |title=Nanotechnology: Molecular Machines that Mimic Life |work=[[Omni (magazine)|Omni]] |author=Fred Hapgood |date=November 1986 |accessdate=June 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1038/429591b |pmid=15190320 |title=Nanotech takes small step towards burying 'grey goo' |year=2004 |last1=Giles |first1=Jim |journal=Nature |volume=429 |issue=6992 |pages=591|bibcode = 2004Natur.429..591G }}&lt;/ref&gt;

University-based organizations include the [[Future of Humanity Institute]] (est. 2005) which researches the questions of humanity's long-term future, particularly existential risk. It was founded by [[Nick Bostrom]] and is based at Oxford University. The [[Centre for the Study of Existential Risk]] (est. 2012) is a Cambridge-based organization which studies four major technological risks: artificial intelligence, biotechnology, global warming and warfare. All are man-made risks, as [[Huw Price]] explained to the AFP news agency, "It seems a reasonable prediction that some time in this or the next century intelligence will escape from the constraints of biology". He added that when this happens "we're no longer the smartest things around," and will risk being at the mercy of "machines that are not malicious, but machines whose interests don't include us."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hui |first=Sylvia |title=Cambridge to study technology's risks to humans |url=http://bigstory.ap.org/article/cambridge-study-technologys-risk-humans |publisher=Associated Press |date=25 November 2012 |accessdate=30 January 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121201021050/http://bigstory.ap.org/article/cambridge-study-technologys-risk-humans |archivedate=1 December 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stephen Hawking]] was an acting adviser.

{{nihongo|'''''Grotesque'''''|グロテスク|Gurotesuku}} is a 2009 [[Cinema of Japan|Japanese]] [[Splatter film|splatter]] [[Horror film|horror]] and [[exploitation film]] written and directed by [[Kōji Shiraishi]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1352369/synopsis?ref_=ttpl_pl_syn&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
A young couple Aki and Kazuo are snatched off the street while having their first date as a romantic couple after a few years working in the same office. They wake up shackled in a basement that has plastic-covered walls. With no further explanation, a sadistic madman degrades, tortures and mutilates them. He punctures Kazuo's belly with a screwdriver and slices his tongue, drives nails into his scrotum, then sexually assaults the girl, forcing the other to watch. Sometimes, he stops the torture to provide medical assistance and cure the couple's wounds, so they can continue alive for a long period of time. This way, he cuts off all their fingers, makes collars with them, pops out Kazuo's right eye, removes the girl's nipples and cuts off her right arm. 

As the torture progresses, it is revealed he is simply doing it for sexual stimulation, and tells the couple he wants the two to survive. He finally castrates Kazuo, claiming he has found all the sexual relief he needs, so no longer needs the couple's "services". The couple is moved to a room which resembles a modern and clean hospital room, where the kidnapper takes care of the couple's wounds. It gradually becomes apparent that the man has professional medical training, refined manners, taste for classical music and good wines and dresses in expensive clothes when he is not in surgeon dress. He even mentions he is a wealthy man, which suggests he may be a reputable surgeon, not merely a violent sadist, looking for an extreme way to obtain satisfaction in his lonely life. The couple also notes the doctor has a particular rotting smell always present behind his clean and elegant appearance. 

After several days healing, the "doctor" simply tells the couple they will be free to go, he will turn himself to authorities and, as apology for all the suffering he inflicted to the couple, he will give them all his fortune which seems to be very large, as compensation. After all the horror, in a moment alone in the hospital room, Aki and Kazuo promise to support each other once they leave and become a couple. It is unclear if the madman is playing with the couple's hopes to survive; immediately after telling them they will be released, the couple is taken back to the basement. After being drugged, they are shackled again, exactly as they were the first time.
 
The "doctor" announces they must participate in one final test of love. He pulls out some of Kazuo's intestines and attaches them to a hook. If Kazuo is able to cross the room to the other side (pulling his entire intestine out of his body in the process), take scissors and cut Aki's ropes to release her, both will be freed. However, Kazuo fails due to blood loss (it is also revealed that the ropes restraining Aki have a metal wire running through them, rendering them impossible to cut with scissors; the task was therefore impossible). 

Aki begins to insult the doctor and says that despite his classy appearance, he has a skunk odor. Angered, the doctor cuts off Aki's head. The head lands on the doctor's neck; she bites him with her final breath. Kazuo, not dead yet, stabs him in the foot with the scissors as a supreme last action. The couple then dies facing each other. In the epilogue, the madman is revealed to have survived, although he cannot walk properly. He is in a quiet forest where he respectfully buries the couple next to each other in a traditional Japanese way, leaving the scissors on their tombs as a symbol. The next scene shows him in the same car he used to kidnap the couple, covering himself with lots of perfume to hide his skunk stench. A girl walks by, and the screen cuts to black as he goes after his next victim.

* Tsugumi Nagasawa as Aki
* Hiroaki Kawatsure as Kazuo
* Shigeo Ōsako as the unnamed doctor

==Release==
The [[British Board of Film Classification]] has refused to issue an 18 certificate to the unrated version of the film, banning its release in the [[United Kingdom]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/Showbiz-News/Japanese-Horror-Film-Grotesque-Banned-By-British-Censors-For-Extreme-Torture-With-Little-Narrative/Article/200908315365324?lpos=Showbiz_News_Top_Stories_Header_4&amp;lid=ARTICLE_15365324_Japanese_Horror_Film_Grotesque_Banned_By_British_Censors_For_Extreme_Torture_With_Little_Narrative|title=Grotesque! UK Bans 'Extreme Torture' Film |date=August 19, 2009|publisher=[[Sky News]]|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; BBFC director David Cook explained "Unlike other recent 'torture' themed horror works, such as the ''[[Saw (franchise)|Saw]]'' and ''[[Hostel (2005 film)|Hostel]]'' series, ''Grotesque'' features minimal narrative or character development and presents the audience with little more than an unrelenting and escalating scenario of humiliation, brutality and sadism. In spite of a vestigial attempt to 'explain' the killer's motivations at the very end of the film, the chief pleasure on offer is not related to understanding the motivations of any of the central characters. Rather, the chief pleasure on offer seems to be wallowing in the spectacle of sadism (including sexual sadism) for its own sake".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.bbfc.co.uk/news/press/20090819.html|title=BBFC rejects sexually violent Japanese horror DVD|date=August 19, 2009|publisher=[[British Board of Film Classification]]|accessdate=2009-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film's director and screenwriter, [[Koji Shiraishi]], responded that he was "delighted and flattered by this most expected reaction from the faraway country, since the film is an honest conscientious work, made sure to upset the so-called moralists."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.gigazine.net/index.php?/news/comments/20090820_grotesque_movie|title=Japanese Horror Flick "Grotesque" Banned in Britain - What the Director Has to Say?|date=August 21, 2009|publisher=Gigazine|accessdate=2009-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Home media==
The reception in Japan was initially less controversial, but after the notoriety of the UK ban, [[Amazon.com|Amazon Japan]] decided to remove the DVD of ''Grotesque'' from its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metropolis.co.jp/features/feature/bathed-in-blood/|title=Bathed in Blood: Director Koji Shiraishi’s torture-porn flick Grotesque gets banned in Britain—and ignites a debate about Japan’s splatter-film boom|date=September 24, 2009|publisher=Metropolis Magazine|accessdate=2009-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Incidentally, CDJapan, the international version of the Japanese retailer Neowing, does not sell the DVD since the controversy; although it is still readily available to Japanese residents via Neowing.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

The film was released on DVD in Austria and the Netherlands on July 31.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The DVD is a special edition limited to 1,000 copies.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} The DVD only contains German and Japanese language tracks and is only available in online stores related to the genre.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}
 
The film was released on a [[DVD]]/[[Blu-ray Disc|Blu-ray]] in the United States by [[Media Blasters]] on October 12, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.amazon.com/Grotesque-Blu-ray-Combo-Tsugumi-Nagasawa/dp/B003VL3UP2/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1322511296&amp;sr=8-1&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
{{expand section|date=July 2016}}
Derek Elley of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' had a lukewarm response to ''Grotesque'', offering kudos to aspects such as the acting and the production values, while criticizing others such as the inconsistent special effects, and opining that the "ridiculous" finale "blows any built-up tension and generates chuckles more than anything else".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = https://variety.com/2009/film/reviews/grotesque-1200478044/|title = Review: ''Grotesque''|last = Elley|first = Derek|publisher = ''Variety''|date = 1 December 2009|website = variety.com|accessdate = 11 June 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; Horror News praised the film, opening its review with, "''Grotesque'' is really a mix of emotions. Brilliant, disgusting, well written, sadistic and painful to your senses beyond belief" and concluding that it was "a solid effort" that deserves "an A for a great and outrageous ending".&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web|url = http://horrornews.net/7316/film-review-grotesque-aka-gurotesuku-2009-cat-iii/|title = Film Review: ''Grotesque'' (aka ''Gurotesuku'') (2009) – CAT III|last = |first = |publisher = Horror News|date = 26 August 2010|website = horrornews.net|accessdate = 11 June 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Cooke''' (c.1762 &amp;ndash; 21 October 1805) was an experienced and highly regarded officer of the [[Royal Navy]] during the [[American War of Independence]], the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] and the first years of the [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Cooke is best known for his death in hand-to-hand combat with French forces during the [[Battle of Trafalgar]] in 1805. During the action, his ship {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} was badly damaged and boarded by sailors and marines from the French [[ship of the line]] {{Ship|French ship|Aigle|1800|2}}. Cooke was killed in the ensuing melee, but his crew successfully drove off their opponents and ultimately forced the surrender of ''Aigle''.

Aside from his death, remarkably little is known of Cooke's circumstances. Even his date of birth is unclear, and unlike many of his fellow officers, Cooke was never a notable society figure. He was however well respected in his profession and following his death was the subject of tributes from officers who had served alongside him. Memorials to him were placed in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] and his local church in [[Wiltshire]].

==Early life==
John Cooke was baptised on 5 March 1762 at [[St. Mary, Whitechapel]], the second son of Francis Cooke, an [[Admiralty]] clerk, and his wife Margaret.&lt;ref name="Tracy95"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's Who in Nelson's Navy|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Ref label|A|a|none}} John Cooke first went to sea at the age of eleven aboard the [[cutter (boat)|cutter]] {{HMS|Greyhound|1763|6}} under Lieutenant [[John Bazely]], before going ashore to spend time at Mr Braken's naval academy at [[Greenwich]]. He was entered onto the books of one of the [[royal yacht]]s by [[Alexander Hood, 1st Viscount Bridport|Sir Alexander Hood]], who would become an enduring patron of Cooke's.&lt;ref name="Tracy95"/&gt; In 1776 he obtained a position as a [[midshipman]] on the [[ship of the line]] {{HMS|Eagle|1774|6}}, aged thirteen.&lt;ref name="CW48"/&gt; Cooke served aboard ''Eagle'', the flagship of the [[North American Station]], during the next three years, seeing extensive action along the eastern seaboard. Notable among these actions were the naval operations around the [[Battle of Rhode Island]] in 1778, when ''Eagle'' was closely engaged with American units ashore.&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;[http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/6171?docPos=9 Cooke, John], ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'', [[John Knox Laughton|J. K. Laughton]], Retrieved 18 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He distinguished himself in the assault, causing Admiral [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe]] to remark "Why, young man, you wish to become a Lieutenant before you are of sufficient age."&lt;ref name="Tracy95"/&gt; On 21 January 1779, Cooke was promoted to [[lieutenant]] and joined {{HMS|Superb|1760|6}} in the East Indies under [[Edward Hughes (Royal Navy officer)|Sir Edward Hughes]], but was forced to take a leave of absence due to ill-health.&lt;ref name="Tracy95"/&gt;

Cooke returned to England and then went to France to spend a year studying, before rejoining the navy in 1782 with an appointment to the 90-gun {{HMS|Duke|1777|6}} under Captain [[Alan Gardner, 1st Baron Gardner|Alan Gardner]].&lt;ref name="Tracy95"/&gt; Cooke saw action at the [[Battle of the Saintes]], at which ''Duke'' was heavily engaged. He remained with Gardner following the signing of the [[Treaty of Paris (1783)|Treaty of Paris]] in 1783, bringing an end to the American War of Independence, and served as his first-lieutenant aboard his next command, the 50-gun {{HMS|Europa|1783|6}}.&lt;ref name="Tracy95"/&gt; Gardner became commodore at [[Jamaica]], flying his [[broad pennant]] aboard ''Europa'' and retaining Cooke as his first-lieutenant until Cooke was injured in a bad fall and had to be invalided home.&lt;ref name="Tracy95"/&gt; He had recovered sufficiently by the time of the [[Spanish Armament]] in 1790 to be able to take up an appointment from his old patron, Sir Alexander Hood, to be third-lieutenant of his flagship, the 90-gun {{HMS|London|1766|6}}.&lt;ref name="Tracy95"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; When the crisis passed without breaking into open war, ''London'' was paid off and Cooke went ashore.&lt;ref name="Tracy95"/&gt;

==Frigate command==
With the outbreak of the [[French Revolutionary Wars]] in February 1793, Cooke rejoined Hood and became first-lieutenant of his new flagship, the 100-gun {{HMS|Royal George|1788|6}}, part of the [[Channel Fleet]]. On 21 February 1794, Cooke was promoted to [[commander]] and given his first independent command, the small [[fireship]] {{HMS|Incendiary|1782|6}}. Three months later, ''Incendiary'' was a signal repeater for the Channel Fleet during the [[Atlantic campaign of May 1794]], relaying [[Richard Howe, 1st Earl Howe|Lord Howe's]] signals to the fleet and operating as a scout in the search for the French fleet under [[Villaret de Joyeuse]]. On 1 June 1794, Cooke was a witness to the battle of the [[Glorious First of June]], although his tiny ship was far too small to engage in combat.&lt;ref name="WJ1:126"&gt;James, Vol. 1, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; In the action's aftermath, Cooke was included in the general promotions issued to the fleet, becoming a [[post captain]] on 23 July 1794. For a year, Cooke was stationed off [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]] as [[flag captain]] to [[James Wallace (Royal Navy officer)|Sir James Wallace]] aboard the 74-gun {{HMS|Monarch|1765|6}}, before returning to Britain and being offered command of the 28-gun {{HMS|Tourterelle|1795|6}}.&lt;ref name="Tracy96"&gt;{{cite book |last=Tracy |title=Who's Who in Nelson's Navy|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cooke accepted, but when he found out she was ordered to the West Indies, he resigned it, having been told by Gardner that further service in the West Indies would likely kill him.&lt;ref name="Tracy96"/&gt;

Instead in early 1796 he took command of the 36-gun [[frigate]] {{HMS|Nymphe|1780|6}}. ''Nymphe'' was employed in the blockade of the French Atlantic ports over the next year, and on 9 March 1797 was in company with {{HMS|St Fiorenzo|1794|6}} when they encountered the returning ships of a short-lived [[Battle of Fishguard|French invasion attempt]] of Britain that had been defeated at [[Fishguard]] in [[Wales]].&lt;ref name="WJ2:80"&gt;James, Vol. 2, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; The French ships attempted to escape into [[Brest, France|Brest]], but were hunted down by the British, who forced the surrender of [[French ship Résistance|''Résistance'']] and [[French ship Constance|''Constance'']] in turn after successive short engagements.&lt;ref name="JH45"&gt;Henderson, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; Neither of the British ships suffered a single casualty in the combat, and both French ships were subsequently purchased into the Royal Navy, bringing [[prize money]] to Cooke and his crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=14035|page=764|date=8 August 1797}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this success, Cooke was unpopular with his men due to the strict discipline he enforced aboard his ship. This was graphically demonstrated just two months after the action off Brest, when ''Nymphe'' became embroiled in the [[Spithead and Nore mutinies|Spithead mutiny]]. Cooke attempted to assist Admiral [[John Colpoys]] at the mutiny's outbreak, and was ordered ashore by his crew when he tried to return to his ship. Cooke was tactfully removed from command by the Admiralty following the mutiny, although he was returned to service two years later aboard the new frigate {{HMS|Amethyst|1799|6}} in preparation for the Anglo-Russian invasion of the [[Batavian Republic]].&lt;ref name="CW48"/&gt; During the invasion, ''Amethyst'' conveyed the [[Prince Frederick, Duke of York and Albany|Duke of York]] to the Netherlands and later participated in the evacuation of the force following the campaign's collapse.&lt;ref name="Tracy96"/&gt;

Cooke was involved in operations in [[Quiberon Bay]] during the remainder of 1799, and in 1800 participated in an abortive invasion of [[Ferrol, Spain|Ferrol]]. During this time, ''Amethyst'' captured six French merchant ships and small privateers.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15301|page=1176|date=11 October 1800}}&lt;/ref&gt; During 1801, Cooke participated in the capture of the {{Ship|French frigate|Dédaigneuse|1797|2|up=yes}} off [[Cape Finisterre]], helping [[Samuel Hood Linzee]] and [[Sir Richard King, 2nd Baronet|Richard King]] chase her down on 26 January. ''Amethyst'' was not heavily engaged with ''Dédaigneuse'' and received no damage, but aided in pursuing and trapping the French ship so that she could be seized. ''Dédaigneuse'' was later purchased into the Royal Navy as HMS ''Dedaigneuse''.&lt;ref name="WJ3:136"&gt;James, Vol. 3, p. 136&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly afterwards, Cooke captured the Spanish ship ''Carlotta'' and the French [[privateer]] ''Général Brune'' in the same area.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=15412|page=1203|date=29 September 1801}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trafalgar==
[[File:Trafalgar aufstellung.jpg|thumb|Battle of Trafalgar]]
With the [[Peace of Amiens]], Cooke briefly retired on half-pay before being recalled to the fleet at the outbreak of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1803. Cooke was requested as flag captain by Admiral [[William Young (1751–1821)|Sir William Young]] at [[Plymouth]], but Cooke tactfully refused, instead applying for active service. He received command of {{HMS|Bellerophon|1786|6}} on 25 April 1805. In May, after the large combined French and Spanish fleet, under Admiral [[Pierre-Charles Villeneuve]] escaped from [[Toulon]], beginning the [[Trafalgar Campaign]], Cooke was ordered to join a flying squadron under Vice-Admiral [[Cuthbert Collingwood, 1st Baron Collingwood|Cuthbert Collingwood]]. The squadron arrived off [[Cadiz]] on 9 June and Collingwood detached ''Bellerophon'' and three other ships to blockade [[Cartagena, Spain|Cartagena]] under Rear-Admiral [[Sir Richard Bickerton, 2nd Baronet|Sir Richard Bickerton]]. When the combined fleet entered Cadiz on 20 August, Collingwood recalled Bickerton's force and mounted a blockade of the port. Collingwood was reinforced with more ships, and was later superseded by Nelson. Cooke was heard to say at this time that "To be in a general engagement with [[Horatio Nelson|Nelson]] would crown all my military ambition".&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt; Nelson had Villeneuve's fleet trapped in Cadiz and was blockading the harbour awaiting their expected attempt to escape.

The Franco-Spanish fleet escaped Cadiz on 18 October 1805, but was soon chased down by Nelson and brought to battle on 21 October. Nelson formed his fleet into two divisions; the weather column would attack to the north under his direct command and the lee column would operate to the south under the command of Cuthbert Collingwood in {{HMS|Royal Sovereign|1786|6}}. Cooke was stationed fifth in Collingwood's line, and so was one of the first ships engaged in action with the combined fleet. Cooke took the unusual step of informing his first lieutenant [[William Pryce Cumby]] and his master Edward Overton of Nelson's orders, in case he should be killed.&lt;ref name="CW47"&gt;White, p. 47&lt;/ref&gt;

''Bellerophon'' was soon closely engaged with the French, breaking through the enemy line and closing with [[French ship Aigle (1800)|''Aigle'']]. As with the other French ships in the fleet, ''Aigle's'' rigging and mastheads were occupied by musketeers and grenadiers, who kept up a steady fire on ''Bellerophon'' and took a heavy toll of sailors exposed on the British ship's deck. Much of the fire was directed at the quarterdeck, where Cooke, Cumby and Overton stood. Cumby noted with surprise that Cooke was still wearing his uniform coat, which sported epaulettes that marked him out as the ship's captain to French snipers. Cooke had forgotten to remove the epaulettes and recognised the danger they represented, but replied "It is too late to take them off. I see my situation, but I will die like a man".&lt;ref name="CW48"/&gt;
[[File:Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke.jpg|left|thumb|alt=Coloured print of a naval battle between sailing ships. Four ships seen stern on in the right of the picture, obscured by clouds of smoke, a fifth ship seen bow on in the left.|''Situation of the Bellerophon at the moment of the death of her gallant commander Captn. Cooke'', early-nineteenth century aquatint by [[Thomas Whitcombe]], showing the ''Bellerophon'' surrounded by enemy ships at the moment of Cooke's death]]
As the action continued, the Captain Pierre-Paul Gourège of ''Aigle'' ordered his crew to board and seize ''Bellerophon'', hoping to use their superiority of numbers to overwhelm the British crew. Cooke sent Cumby below to make sure that the lower-deck guns continued to fire into the French ship as the battle continued overhead, and threw himself at the French sailors pouring onto ''Bellerophon's'' quarterdeck, shooting an enemy officer dead and engaging in hand-to-hand combat with the men behind him.&lt;ref name="CW48"/&gt; Within minutes Cumby had returned to the deck with reinforcements from below, passing the mortally wounded Overton on the ladder. The badly wounded ship's quartermaster was also present, and he informed Cumby that Cooke had fallen in the melee.&lt;ref name="WJ4:52"&gt;James, Vol. 4, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Cumby's charge cleared the French from the deck of ''Bellerophon'', and he found Cooke dead on the quarterdeck, two [[musket]] balls lodged in his chest. Cooke's last words had been "Let me lie quietly a minute. Tell Lieutenant Cumby never to strike."&lt;ref name="CW48"&gt;White, p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Cumby took charge of the battered ''Bellerophon'', directing her fire into ''Aigle'' and ultimately forcing the French ship's surrender after the arrival of other British vessels. ''Bellerophon'' had suffered grievously, losing 27 dead and 127 wounded.&lt;ref name="WJ4:52"/&gt; Although ''Aigle'' was lost in the chaotic storm which followed the battle, ''Bellerophon'' survived, primarily due to Cumby's leadership. He was later promoted to post captain for his services in the action.&lt;ref name="CW52"&gt;White, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Cooke's body was [[buried at sea]] the day after the battle with the other fatal casualties from ''Bellerophon''.&lt;ref name="ODNB"/&gt;

==Family and legacy==
[[File:Tomb of Horatio Nelson on Saint-Paul Cathedral.jpg|thumb|Tribute to Cooke on left in the crypt of St Pauls Cathedral]]
[[File:St Andrew's Church, Donhead St Andrew 16.JPG|thumb|left|upright|Memorial to Cooke in St&amp;nbsp;Andrew's Church, Donhead St&amp;nbsp;Andrew, in Wiltshire]]
Cooke's death, as with those of [[George Duff]] and Admiral Nelson himself, was widely mourned in Britain. Cooke's widow Louisa and their eight-year-old daughter were given numerous awards and presents, including the gold medal minted for the captains who had fought at the action, and a large silver vase presented by [[Lloyd's Patriotic Fund]]. At least some of the money the family received was spent on a large wall plaque mounted in St Andrew's Church in [[Donhead St Andrew]] in [[Wiltshire]], close to the family home.&lt;ref name="CW49"&gt;White, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; The plaque commemorates Cooke's life and death and also that of his wife. A memorial was also raised to him in [[St Paul's Cathedral]]. Tributes from fellow officers were also forthcoming, including from the future explorer [[John Franklin]], who had served on ''Bellerophon'' at Trafalgar and had said of Cooke that he was "very gentlemanly and active. I like his appearance very much."&lt;ref name="CW48"/&gt;  A number of letters that Cooke wrote to his brother prior to Trafalgar are held by the [[National Maritime Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{UK National Archives ID}}, Retrieved on 19 September 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Cooke had married Louisa, née Hardy, on 15 June 1790 at [[St Leonard's, Shoreditch]]. Louisa was the fourth daughter of [[Josiah Hardy]], the former Governor of New Jersey, and later consul at Cadiz.&lt;ref name="Tracy95"/&gt; They had a single daughter together, born on 26 January 1797 at [[Stoke Damerel]]. Louisa died at [[Cheltenham]] on 5 February 1853 aged 96.&lt;ref name="Tracy95"/&gt;

==Notes==
{{refbegin}}
'''a.''' {{Note label|A|a|none}} A number of sources, including T. A. Heathcote's ''Nelson's Trafalgar Captains and Their Battles'', [[Colin White (historian)|Colin White's]] ''The Trafalgar Captains'' and [[John Knox Laughton]]'s entry for Cooke in the ''[[Dictionary of National Biography]]'' give a birth year of 1763 and omit most information about Cooke's early life. Nicholas Tracy's entry in ''Who's Who in Nelson's Navy'' provides fuller coverage of Cooke's early life, and includes a specific baptism date.

In [[Peter F. Hamilton]]'s [[The Night's Dawn Trilogy]], the '''Ly-Cilph''' are an alien race that evolved on an unnamed [[moon]] orbiting a [[gas giant]] [[planet]]. The unstable nature of the Ly-Cilph's homeworld's orbit meant that every nine years, the moon was consumed by violent storms. Millennia of evolution meant that even while the Ly-Cilph's corporeal bodies were destroyed, they transcended to a state of higher existence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hamilton|first1=Peter|title=The Reality Dysfunction|date=1996|publisher=Macmillan|location=London|isbn=978-1-4472-0857-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biology==
The Ly-Cilph begin their lives in a fish-like form, swimming in the shallow pools of their homeworld. After three years in this form, they lose their tails, and develop a snail-like skirt. They emerge onto the land, and feed upon "nodes", biological time capsules left behind by previous generations of Ly-Cilph. When they consume these nodes, not only do they gain the vast understanding of their ancestors, but the telepathic centres of their brain are stimulated, allowing them to communicate with other Ly-Cilph. Prior to consuming these nodes, the Ly-Cilph do not possess [[sentience]].

When the orbit of the moon causes the nine-year cycle to end, and storms to begin spreading across the planet, the Ly-Cilph stop whatever they are doing, and anchor themselves to the ground. Nodes grow from their skin, and drop to the ground like fruit. A flash of radiation from the gas giant kills their corporeal bodies, but also provides their minds with enough energy to [[Transcendence (philosophy)|transcend]] and become non-corporeal. The freed Ly-Cilph minds drift up into orbit of their home, and then set out to discover the universe.

==Culture==
Due to the impermanent landscape of their home, the Ly-Cilph do not build structures or tools of any kind. Arts and Sciences such as [[architecture]] and [[engineering]] are practically unknown to them, as are pursuits that require tools, such as [[computer science]] and [[archaeology]]. On the other hand, sciences like [[mathematics]], [[physics]], and [[astronomy]] are quite highly developed.

The primary goal of the Ly-Cilph is to gain knowledge. For this reason, their entire lifetimes, as well as the time after their transcendence, are spent learning and exploring. After they transcend, most Ly-Cilph travel throughout the universe, observing other civilisations and phenomena. This is primarily a solitary exercise, as the Ly-Cilph are usually unable and uninterested in directly altering or affecting events in the universe. An exception to this was in 2611, when a Ly-Cilph inadvertently opened a [[transdimensional portal]] on the human [[colony]] world of Lalonde.

{{Nihongo|'''Monster X'''|モンスターエックス?|Monsutā Ekkusu}}, also known as {{Nihongo|'''Keizer Ghidorah'''|カイザーギドラ?|Kaizā Gidora}}, is a [[kaiju]] that first appeared in [[Toho]]'s ''[[Godzilla: Final Wars]]'' (2004). Although Monster X is a similar species to [[King Ghidorah]], the two are not the same and have separate trademarks, owing to the drastically different abilities between them.

==Overview==
Monster X is a powerful opponent capable of using various attacks to overpower his foes. He can fire destructive beams from his eyes, utilise [[telekinesis]] to levitate and throw enemies around, and summon vast amounts of energy to transform. As Keizer Ghidorah, he can fire gravity beams from all three of his heads, choke foes using his necks, and drain energy from his opponent by biting them. Keizer Ghidorah also displays very large amounts of durability, being capable of defending against Godzilla's attacks seemingly relentlessly, and only being defeated by the Keizer powers given to Godzilla by Ozaki (a Keizer-human mutant). On Keizer Ghidorah's level of power, Godzilla is able to take down his foe. Monster X is 120 meters tall and Keizer Ghidorah is 140 meters tall.&lt;ref&gt;''Toho Special Effects All Monster Encyclopedia; Godzilla: Final Wars''; Page 118&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muhammad ibn ‘Alī ibn Mūsā''' ([[Arabic]]: محمد ابن علی ابن موسی ) ([[circa]] April 12, 811 - c. November 29, 835) was the ninth of [[the Twelve Imams]] and a descendant of the [[Muhammad|Prophet Muhammad]]. He was also called '''Abu Ja'far''', '''Ibn al-Ridha''' ("the son of al-Ridha); '''al-Jawād''' ("the generous") and '''al-Taqī''' ("the pious"). His role is celebrated by the largest branch of [[Shia Islam]], the [[Twelver]] or ''Athnā‘ashariyyah'' branch. According to Shiite accounts, he was poisoned by his wife and died at age 25, the shortest-lived of the Twelve.&lt;ref name="shia islam"&gt;{{cite book|last = Tabatabaei|first = Sayyid Mohammad Hosayn|authorlink = Allameh Tabatabaei|title = Shi'ite Islam|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Be5DeNM8d1EC|page=258}}|year = 1975|isbn = 0-87395-390-8| others=Translated by [[Seyyed Hossein Nasr|Sayyid Hossein Nasr]]|publisher=State University of New York Press|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Publications"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=SRxXCAAAQBAJ|page=146}}|title=A Brief History of the Fourteen Infallibles|date=28 October 2014|publisher=Ansariyan Publications|isbn=978-1-312-48625-6|page=151|author=Ahlulbayt Organization}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Al-Jawad was born circa April 12, 811, in [[Medina]] (then part of the [[Abbasid Empire]]). He was born to his father, Ali al-Ridha and a mother whose name and background is not entirely known. According to [[Muhammad ibn Ya'qub al-Kulayni|Kulaini]], his mother was a bondmaid from [[Nubia]] named Habibi. However, some say that she was Khaizaran, a girl from the [[Byzantine Empire]]. Others believe she belonged to the household of [[Maria al-Qibtiyya]], who was the [[slave]] mother of [[Muhammad]]'s young son [[Ibrahim ibn Muhammad|Ibrahim]].&lt;ref name="shia islam"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Donaldson"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=ZpV7QwAACAAJ|page=190}}|title=The Shi'ite Religion: A History of Islam in Persia and Iraḳ|last=Donaldson|first=Dwight M.|publisher=AMS Press|year=1933|pages=190–197}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Al-Jawad's father, Ali al-Ridha, knew that his son should take the position of [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]] after him. When al-Jawad was four, his father received a summons from the [[Abbasid]] Caliph, [[al-Ma'mun]], asking him to be al-Ma'mun's successor. Al-Ridha left the four-year-old al-Jawad behind in Medina to respond to the summons. The Shiites questioned whether a child of that age could take on his father's responsibility as an Imamate if something happened to his father. In response, al-Ridha used to tell the story of [[Jesus]], who had become a [[prophet]] at a younger age.{{sfn|Sharif al-Qarashi|2005|p=53}}
[[File:Al-Kadhimiya Mosque, Kadhmain Shrine.jpg|300px|thumbnail|[[Al-Kadhimiya Mosque]] ]]

==Nicknamed ''al–Jawad''==
As a young child, Muhammad al-Jawad earned the name ''al-Jawad'' ("the generous"). When his father was away, people gathered by al-Jawad's door in hopes of gaining help. Al-Jawad's caregivers had him leave his house only through another exit to avoid them. Upon hearing this, his father wrote a letter to advising his son not to listen to those who told him not to use the house's main gate. He wrote that the other advice came from stinginess and a fear that someone else might receive goodness ([[alms]]) from al-Jawad. Al-Ridha wrote: "Whenever you want to go out, keep some gold and silver with you. No one should ask you for anything without your giving it to him. If one of your uncles asks you to be pious to him, do not give him less than fifty [[dinar]]s and you may give him more if you want. If one of your aunts asks you, do not give her less than twenty-five dinars and you may give her more if you want...."{{sfn||Sharif al-Qarashi|2005|p=52}}

==Imamate==
Al-Jawad's age at the time of his father's death in Korasan is unknown, although probably between seven and nine. With his father's death, al-Jawad became a young [[Imam]]. According to Shia beliefs, al-Jawad acted like an adult and possessed extraordinary knowledge. Shia beliefs liken this to [[Islamic view of Jesus|Jesus]], who was called to leadership and his prophetic mission while still a child.{{efn|[http://tanzil.net/#5:110 Quran, 5:110]}}&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

Accounts differ as to al-Ridha's death and subsequent events. One account states that al-Ma'mun poisoned al-Ridha,&lt;ref name= "madelung"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/ali-al-reza|title=ALĪ AL-REŻĀ, the eighth Imam of the Emāmī Shiʿites. |author=[[Wilferd Madelung|W. Madelung]]|date= 1 August 2011 |website=Iranicaonline.org |publisher= |accessdate= 18 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then summoned al-Jawad to [[Baghdad]] in order to marry his daughter, Ummul Fadhl. This apparently provoked strenuous objections by the [[Abbasid]]s. According to [[Ya'qubi]], al-Ma'mun gave al-Jawad one hundred thousand [[Dirham]] and said, "Surely I would like to be a grandfather in the line of the [[Muhammad|Apostle of God]] and of [[Ali|Ali ibn Abu Talib]]."&lt;ref name="Donaldson"/&gt;

Another account states that [[al-Mamun|al-Ma'mun's]] first meeting with al-Jawad was coincidental. According to this account, al-Ma'mun was hunting when he happened upon a group of boys including al-Jawad, who were playing. When al-Ma'mun's horsemen approached, the boys ran away, except al-Jawad. This prompted al-Ma'mun to stop his carriage and ask, "Boy, what kept you from running away with the others?" Al-Jawad replied, "The road was not so narrow that I should fear there would not be room for you to pass and I have not been guilty of any offence that I should be afraid and I considered that you were the sort of man who would not injure one who had done no wrong." 
Shia traditions say that the Caliph was delighted and after he traveling a short distance, one of his hunting birds brought him a small fish. Al-Ma'mun hid the fish in his fist, returned and asked al-Jawad: "What have I in my hand?" Al-Jawad responded: "The creator of living things has created in the sea a small fish that is fished by the falcons of the kings and caliphs to try with it the [[Offspring|progeny]] of [[Muhammad|al-Mustafa]].&lt;ref name="Donaldson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi 2005 206"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi|2005|p=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shiite tradition says that Al-Ma'mun was pleased with this answer and asked the child about his lineage. Soon after, the Caliph called a large gathering, during which al-Jawad was asked many questions and astonished everyone with his judgment and learning. After this, al-Ma'mun formally gave al-Jawad his daughter in marriage.&lt;ref name="Donaldson" /&gt;

According to beliefs, Yahya ibn Aktham, the Chief Justice of the Abbasid Empire, was present at al-Ma'mun's assembly and wanted to try al-Jawad in al-Ma'mun's presence. He did so by asking a question concerning atonement for a person who hunts [[game (food)|game]] while dressed in [[pilgrimage]] garb ([[Ihram]]). In response, al-Jawad asked first "whether the game killed was outside the sanctified area or inside it; whether the hunter was aware of his sin or did so in ignorance; did he kill the game on purpose or by mistake, was the hunter a slave or a free man, was he adult or minor, did he commit the [[sin]] for the first time or had he done so before, was the hunted game a bird or something else, was it a small animal or a big one, is the sinner sorry for the misdeed or does he insist on it, did he kill it secretly at night or openly during daylight, was he putting on the pilgrimage garb for [[Hajj]] or for the [[Umrah]]?..." This apparently astonished the Abbasid who were critical of al-Ma'mun's decision.&lt;ref name="Donaldson" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi|2005|pp=210–212}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the next annual pilgrimage ([[Hajj]]), prominent men from around the Islamic world came to Medina to see al-Jawad and another assembly was held. These men were skeptical of al-Jawad's youth and whether he truly was the [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imamate]]). Shiite belief holds that the boy eliminated their doubts. Kulaini recounted that the superintendent of the Shrine gave al-Jawad a test that "lasted for several days, in which he answered thirty thousand questions to their great amazement!"&lt;ref name="Donaldson" /&gt;

==Abbasid era==
Ma'mun had asked al-Jawad to marry his daughter because he had been the pioneer of his contemporary elites.&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi 2005 206" /&gt; One year after this marriage, al-Jawad came back to Medina with Ome Al Fazl, his wife, and devoted his life to teaching.&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Publications" /&gt; Al-Jawad also married Sumaneh,&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Publications" /&gt; who was from the [[Maghreb]] (Northwest Africa).&lt;ref name="Donaldson" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi 2005 206" /&gt; She bore him a son and a successor, [[Ali al-Hadi]], who would be the tenth Shiite [[Imamate (Twelver doctrine)|Imam]].

After al-Ma'mun's death in 833, his successor, [[Al-Mu'tasim]], became the new Caliph. Al-Mu'tasim did not like al-Jawad and in 835 called him to Baghdad. Al-Jawad left his son Ali-al-Hadi with his mother Sumaneh in [[Medina]] while his wife accompanied him to Baghdad. They lived there for a year before al-Jawad's wife, according to some sources, poisoned him, at the urging of the new Caliph Al-Mu'tasim.&lt;ref name="shia islam" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ansariyan Publications" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sharif al-Qarashi 2005 221"&gt;{{harvnb|Sharif al-Qarashi|2005|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All species of [[animal]]s, [[Embryophyte|land plants]] and most [[fungi]] are multicellular, as are many [[algae]], whereas a few organisms are partially uni- and partially multicellular, like [[slime mold]]s and social amoebae such as the genus ''[[Dictyostelium]]''.

Multicellular organisms arise in various ways, for example by [[cell division]] or by aggregation of many single cells.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite journal | author=S. M.

===Loss of multicellularity===
Loss of multicellularity occurred in some groups.&lt;ref&gt;Seravin L. N. (2001) The principle of counter-directional morphological

===Cancer===
Multicellular organisms, especially long-living animals, face the challenge of [[cancer]], which occurs when cells fail to regulate their growth within the normal program of development. Changes in tissue morphology can be observed during this process. Cancer in animals ([[metazoan]]s) has often been described as a loss of multicellularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Davies | first1 = P. C. W. | last2 = Lineweaver | first2 = C.

===Separation of somatic and germ cells===
In some multicellular groups, which are called [[Weismann barrier|Weismannists]], a separation between a sterile [[somatic cell]] line and a [[germ cell]] line evolved. However, Weismannist development is relatively rare (e.g. vertebrates, arthropods, ''[[Volvox]]''), as great part of species have the capacity for [[somatic embryogenesis]] (e.g. land plants, most algae, many invertebrates).&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 295-297.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Niklas, K. J. (2014) [http://www.amjbot.org/content/101/1/6.long The evolutionary-developmental origins of multicellularity].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hypotheses for origin==
[[File:The-Simplest-Integrated-Multicellular-Organism-Unveiled-pone.0081641.s003.ogv|thumb|''[[Tetrabaena socialis]]'' consists of four cells.]]
One hypothesis for the origin of multicellularity is that a group of function-specific cells aggregated into a slug-like mass called a [[Grex (biology)|grex]], which moved as a multicellular unit. This is essentially what [[slime mold]]s do. Another hypothesis is that a primitive cell underwent nucleus division, thereby becoming a [[coenocyte]]. A membrane would then form around each nucleus (and the cellular space and organelles occupied in the space), thereby resulting in a group of connected cells in one organism (this mechanism is observable in [[Drosophila]]). A third hypothesis is that as a unicellular organism divided, the daughter cells failed to separate, resulting in a conglomeration of identical cells in one organism, which could later develop specialized tissues. This is what plant and animal [[embryo]]s do as well as colonial [[choanoflagellate]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(10)01095-X?large_figure=true|title=Multicellular development in a choanoflagellate|first1=Stephen R.|last1=Fairclough|first2=Mark J.|last2=Dayel|first3=Nicole|last3=King|date=26 October 2010|journal=Current Biology|volume=20|issue=20|pages=R875–R876|accessdate=14 April 2018|doi=10.1016/j.cub.2010.09.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/14/science/14creatures.html?scp=1&amp;sq=In%20a%20Single-Cell%20Predator,%20Clues%20to%20the%20Animal%20Kingdom’s%20Birth&amp;st=cse In a Single-Cell Predator, Clues to the Animal Kingdom’s Birth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the first multicellular organisms were simple, soft organisms lacking bone, shell or other hard body parts, they are not well preserved in the fossil record.&lt;ref&gt;A H Knoll, 2003. ''Life on a Young Planet''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|0-691-00978-3}} (hardcover), {{ISBN|0-691-12029-3}} (paperback). An excellent book on the early history of life, very accessible to the non-specialist; includes extensive discussions of early signatures, fossilization, and organization of life.&lt;/ref&gt; One exception may be the [[demosponge]], which may have left a chemical signature in ancient rocks. The earliest fossils of multicellular organisms include the contested [[Grypania]] spiralis and the fossils of the black shales of the [[Palaeoproterozoic]] [[Francevillian Group Fossil]] B Formation in [[Gabon]] ([[Gabonionta]]).&lt;ref&gt;

Until recently, [[phylogenetic]] reconstruction has been through [[anatomy|anatomical]] (particularly [[embryology|embryological]]) similarities. This is inexact, as living multicellular organisms such as [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s are more than 500 million years removed from their single-cell ancestors. Such a passage of time allows both [[divergent evolution|divergent]] and [[convergent evolution|convergent]] evolution time to mimic similarities and accumulate differences between groups of modern and extinct ancestral species. Modern phylogenetics uses sophisticated techniques such as [[alloenzymes]], [[satellite DNA]] and other molecular markers to describe traits that are shared between distantly related lineages.{{cn|date=June 2018}}

The evolution of multicellularity could have occurred in a number of different ways, some of which are described below:

===The symbiotic theory===
This theory suggests that the first multicellular organisms occurred from [[symbiosis]] (cooperation) of different species of single-cell organisms, each with different roles. Over time these organisms would become so dependent on each other they would not be able to survive independently, eventually leading to the incorporation of their genomes into one multicellular organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

| url = https://www.questia.com/PM.qst?a=o&amp;d=96971657
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each respective organism would become a separate lineage of differentiated cells within the newly created species.

This kind of severely co-dependent symbiosis can be seen frequently, such as in the relationship between [[clown fish]] and [[Heteractis magnifica|Riterri sea anemones]]. In these cases, it is extremely doubtful whether either species would survive very long if the other became extinct. However, the problem with this theory is that it is still not known how each organism's DNA could be incorporated into one single [[genome]] to constitute them as a single species. Although such symbiosis is theorized to have occurred (e.g. [[mitochondria]] and [[chloroplasts]] in animal and plant cells—[[endosymbiosis]]), it has happened only extremely rarely and, even then, the genomes of the endosymbionts have retained an element of distinction, separately replicating their DNA during [[mitosis]] of the host species. For instance, the two or three symbiotic organisms forming the composite [[lichen]], although dependent on each other for survival, have to separately reproduce and then re-form to create one individual organism once more.

===The cellularization (syncytial) theory===
This theory states that a single unicellular organism, with multiple [[Cell nucleus|nuclei]], could have developed [[endomembrane|internal membrane]] partitions around each of its nuclei.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book

| page = 112
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many protists such as the [[ciliates]] or [[slime molds]] can have several nuclei, lending support to this [[hypothesis]]. However, the simple presence of multiple nuclei is not enough to support the theory. Multiple nuclei of ciliates are dissimilar and have clear differentiated functions. The [[macronucleus]] serves the organism's needs, whereas the [[micronucleus]] is used for sexual reproduction with exchange of genetic material. Slime molds [[syncytium|syncitia]] form from individual amoeboid cells, like syncitial tissues of some multicellular organisms, not the other way round. To be deemed valid, this theory needs a demonstrable example and mechanism of generation of a multicellular organism from a pre-existing syncytium.

===The colonial theory===
The Colonial Theory of [[Haeckel]], 1874, proposes that the symbiosis of many organisms of the same species (unlike the [[#The symbiotic theory|symbiotic theory]], which suggests the symbiosis of different species) led to a multicellular organism. At least some, it is presumed land-evolved, multicellularity occurs by cells separating and then rejoining (e.g. [[slime mould|cellular slime molds]]) whereas for the majority of multicellular types (those that evolved within aquatic environments), multicellularity occurs as a consequence of cells failing to separate following division.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism of this latter colony formation can be as simple as incomplete [[cytokinesis]], though multicellularity is also typically considered to involve [[cellular differentiation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:ColonialFlagellateHypothesis.png|thumb|650px]]
The advantage of the Colonial Theory hypothesis is that it has been seen to occur independently in 16 different protoctistan phyla. For instance, during food shortages the amoeba [[Dictyostelium]] groups together in a colony that moves as one to a new location. Some of these amoeba then slightly differentiate from each other. Other examples of colonial organisation in protista are [[Volvocaceae]], such as [[Eudorina]] and [[Volvox]], the latter of which consists of up to 500–50,000 cells (depending on the species), only a fraction of which reproduce.&lt;ref&gt;AlgaeBase. [http://www.algaebase.org/search/genus/detail/?genus_id=43497 Volvox Linnaeus, 1758: 820.]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in one species 25–35 cells reproduce, 8 asexually and around 15–25 sexually. However, it can often be hard to separate colonial [[protist]]s from true multicellular organisms, as the two concepts are not distinct; colonial protists have been dubbed "pluricellular" rather than "multicellular".&lt;ref name="Strickberger"/&gt;

===The Synzoospore theory===
Some authors suggest that the origin of multicellularity, at least in Metazoa, occurred due to a transition from temporal to spatial [[cell differentiation]], rather than through a gradual evolution of cell differentiation, as affirmed in [[Haeckel]]’s [[Gastraea|Gastraea theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Mikhailov K. V., Konstantinova A. V., Nikitin M. A., Troshin P. V., Rusin L., Lyubetsky V., Panchin Y., Mylnikov A. P., Moroz L. L., Kumar S. &amp; Aleoshin V. V. (2009). The origin of Metazoa: a transition from temporal to spatial cell differentiation. ''Bioessays'', 31(7), 758–768, [http://www.kumarlab.net/pdf_new/MikhailovAleoshin09.pdf].&lt;/ref&gt;

===The role of viruses===
Genes borrowed from viruses have recently been identified as playing a crucial role in the differentiation of multicellular tissues and organs and even in sexual reproduction, in the fusion of egg cell and sperm.  Such fused cells are also involved in metazoan membranes such as those that prevent chemicals crossing the placenta and the brain body separation.  Two viral components have been identified.  The first is syncytin, which came from a virus.  The second identified in 2007 is called EFF1, which helps form the skin of ''Caenorhabditis elegans'', part of a whole family of FF proteins.  Felix Rey, of the Pasteur Institute in Paris has constructed the 3D structure of the EFF1 protein&lt;ref&gt;Jamin, M, H Raveh-Barak, B Podbilewicz, FA Rey (2014) "Structural basis of eukaryotic cell-cell fusion" (Cell, Volume 157, Issue 2, 10 April 2014), Pages 407–419&lt;/ref&gt; and shown it does the work of linking one cell to another, in viral infections.  The fact that all known cell fusion molecules are viral in origin suggests that they have been vitally important to the inter-cellular communication systems that enabled multicellularity.  Without the ability of cellular fusion, colonies could have formed, but anything even as complex as a sponge would not have been possible.&lt;ref&gt;Slezak, Michael (2016), "No Viruses? No skin or bones either" (New Scientist, No. 2958, 1 March 2014) p.16&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages==
&lt;!--The reference Grosberg2007 has a good discussion of the advantages of multicellularity.--&gt;
Multicellularity allows an organism to exceed the size limits normally imposed by [[diffusion]]: single cells with increased size have a decreased surface-to-volume ratio and have difficulty absorbing sufficient nutrients and transporting them throughout the cell. Multicellular organisms thus have the [[Competition (biology)|competitive]] advantages of an increase in size without its limitations.  They can have longer lifespans as they can continue living when individual cells die. Multicellularity also permits increasing complexity by allowing [[Cellular differentiation|differentiation]] of cell types within one organism.

In 1656, a plague nearly eradicated the population of [[Naples]], [[Italy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scasciamacchia|first=Silvia|last2=Serrecchia|first2=Luigina|last3=Giangrossi|first3=Luigi|last4=Garofolo|first4=Giuliano|last5=Balestrucci|first5=Antonio|last6=Sammartino|first6=Gilberto|last7=Fasanella|first7=Antonio|title=Plague Epidemic in the Kingdom of Naples, 1656–1658|url=https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/1/11-0597_article|journal=Emerging Infectious Diseases|language=en-us|volume=18|issue=1|pages=186–188|doi=10.3201/eid1801.110597}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was prevented by forcible quarantine of the poorer districts, and the efforts of a [[Martinus Ludheim]], a visiting physician from [[Bavaria]], [[Germany]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sudden depolarisation of a nerve evokes propagated [[action potential]] by activating [[Voltage-gated ion channels|voltage-gated]] fast [[sodium channels]] incorporated in the [[cell membrane]] if the depolarisation is strong enough to reach threshold. The open sodium channels allow more [[sodium ion]]s to flow into the cell and resulting in further depolarisation, which will subsequently open even more sodium channels. At a certain moment this process becomes regenerative ([[vicious cycle]]) and results in the rapid ascending phase of action potential. In parallel with the depolarisation and sodium channel activation, the inactivation process of the sodium channels is also driven by depolarisation. Since inactivation is much slower than activation process, during the regenerative phase of action potential, inactivation is unable to prevent the "chain reaction"-like rapid increase in the membrane voltage.

During neuronal accommodation the slowly rising  depolarisation drives the activation and inactivation, as well as the potassium gates simultaneously and never evokes action potential. Failure to evoke action potential by ramp depolarisation of any strength had been a great puzzle until Hodgkin and Huxley created their physical model of action potential. Later in their life they received a Nobel Prize for their influential discoveries. Neuronal accommodation can be explained in two ways. "First, during the passage of a constant cathodal current through the membrane, the potassium conductance and the degree of inactivation will rise, both factors raising the threshold. Secondly, the steady state ionic current at all strengths of depolarization is outward, so that an applied cathodal current which rises sufficiently slowly will never evoke a regenerative response from the membrane, and excitation will not occur."&lt;ref name="HH"/&gt; (quote from Hodgkin and Huxley)

''In vivo'' physiologic condition accommodation breaks down, that is long-duration slowly rising current excites nerve fibers at a nearly constant intensity no matter how slowly this intensity is approached.&lt;ref name=HAA&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Nose tombs''' ({{Lang-ja|鼻の墓}} ''hana no haka''; {{Lang-ko|코 무덤}} ''ko mudeom'') are [[tombs]] that contain [[human nose]]s or other body parts that were brought back to [[Japan]] as trophies during the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–1598)|Japanese invasions of Korea]] in the late 16th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | last = Diamond | first = Jared | title = The Japanese Roots (Part 1) | publisher = Association for Asia Research | date = 2004-10-27 | url = http://www.asianresearch.org/articles/2348.html | accessdate = 2010-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[War trophies]] were a part of Japanese tradition at the time and [[samurai]] warriors were often paid according to how many they collected.

One such nose tomb was discovered in 1983 in [[Okayama]] near [[Osaka]].

As of September, 2017, Hill has been named inaugural Director of the [[Krembil Centre for Neuroinformatics]] at the [[Centre for Addiction and Mental Health]] in Toronto, Canada. The center will apply machine learning and artificial intelligence techniques, as well as multi scale modeling of the brain to the understanding of mental health disorders &lt;ref&gt;[https://beta.theglobeandmail.com/news/national/camh-donation-gives-mental-health-scientists-a-chance-to-a-harness-data-with-ai/article36192994/] "CAMH donation gives mental health scientists a chance to harness data with artificial intelligence", by Kelly Grant, Globe and Mail on September 7, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to this, Hill served as co-Director of Blue Brain, where he led the Neuroinformatics Division of Blue Brain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/whole-human-brain-mapped-in-3d/ "Whole Human Brain Mapped in 3-D"]. ''Scientific American'', By Helen Shen, Nature magazine on June 21, 2013 &lt;/ref&gt; In this role, he directed the development of [[Blue Brain Nexus]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://actu.epfl.ch/news/blue-brain-nexus-an-open-source-tool-for-data-driv/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://github.com/BlueBrain/nexus&lt;/ref&gt;, an open-source data integration, search and tracking platform adopted by both the [[Blue Brain Project]] and [[Human Brain Project]].

Hill has developed a number of large-scale brain models and simulations, including the first large-scale model of the visual thalamocortical system of the cat which accurately replicates multi-scale electrophysiological phenomena during wakefulness and sleep. He has also co-led the Blue Brain's efforts to create digital reconstructions of neocortical microcircuitry.

He serves on the advisory or management boards of several clinical and neuroinformatics initiatives including the Ontario Brain Institute and a large-scale traumatic brain injury study, CENTER-TBI.

Hill is author of more than 50 peer reviewed publications, multiple patents &lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=dnK5QYMAAAAJ&amp;hl=en Google Scholar report for Sean Hill.]&lt;/ref&gt;, and has given talks around the world on the topics of neuroinformatics, brain modeling and simulation, and on the cellular and synaptic mechanisms of conscious and unconscious brain states.&lt;ref name=sky /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isciencemag.co.uk/reviews/the-human-brain-project/ "The Human Brain Project"].

[[Beatification|Blessed]] '''Secondo Pollo''' (2 January 1908 - 26 December 1941) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] [[Roman Catholic Church|Roman Catholic]] [[priest]] and a chaplain who served in [[World War II]]. He died during a skirmish in 1941 in which a bullet struck him while he attended to a wounded comrade.&lt;ref name=SEB&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santiebeati.it/dettaglio/36250|title=Blessed Secondo Pollo|publisher=Santi e Beati|date=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pollo received beatification from [[Pope John Paul II]] in 1998 during the latter's apostolic visit to [[Vercelli]].

==Life==
Secondo Pollo was born in 1908 in [[Vercelli]]. He had an intense love for the [[Eucharist]] as a child and desired to become a [[priest]] during that time.&lt;ref name=EWTN&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/MARY/bios98.htm/|title=Biographies of New Blesseds - 1998|publisher=EWTN|date=|accessdate=19 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Institute of the Brothers of the Christian Schools]] oversaw his childhood education.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; At the age of eleven in 1919 he commenced his studies for the priesthood and remained there until the completion of his high school studies. He began his theological studies in [[Rome]] and in 1931 graduated in philosophical studies at the [[Pontifical Academy of St. Thomas Aquinas]] and in theological studies at the [[Pontifical Gregorian University]].&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt;&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt; Those around him considered him to be a model seminarian.

He received the minor orders and the diaconate around the late 1920s or the earliest of the 1930s for he was [[ordained]] as a priest on 15 August 1931. He received his ordination from the [[Archbishop of Vercelli]] Giacomo Montanelli.&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt; After Pollo's ordination he was tasked with teaching seminarians and from 1936 until 1940 moved seminaries. He was also made an archdiocesan assistant of the Italian section of [[Catholic Action]] in September 1936.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; He also served as a prison chaplain.&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt;

The outbreak of [[World War II]] saw him request to become a chaplain in the ranks of soldiers despite the slight vision impairment he had.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; Pollo was elevated as a lieutenant captain of the 3rd Battalion "Val Chisone" of the [[6th Alpine Division Alpi Graie]]. His peers and superiors regarded Pollo as a different kind of individual who was capable of distinguishing himself and held him in high regard.&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt;

On 26 December 1941 the battalion moved to [[Montenegro]] and then near [[Turin]] where he was struck when a bullet hit him as he tended to a wounded soldier.&lt;ref name=SEB/&gt; It hit his [[femoral artery]] which led to him bleeding to death.&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt; As he bled he said: "Look after the others; they're worse than I am". A comrade recorded Pollo's last words he whispered: "I am going to [[God]] who is so good".&lt;ref name=EWTN/&gt; Pollo bowed his head and died. He was buried and then reinterred in 1961 until he was placed in the [[Vercelli Cathedral]] in 1968.

==Beatification==
The beatification process commenced under [[Pope Pius XII]] in an informative diocesan process that commenced in 1955 and concluded its work in 1972. Theologians declared his writings to be in line with the faith and issued a decree on 29 November 1974 to affirm that the team had consulted his writings and approved them. The process was made valid on 8 November 1985 in order for the boxes of documentation from the process to be investigated in Rome.

The postulation submitted the [[Positio]] to the [[Congregation for the Causes of Saints]] in 1994 for assessment which resulted in Pollo being declared [[Venerable]] on 18 December 1997 after [[Pope John Paul II]] recognized the fact that Pollo had lived a life of the [[heroic virtue]].

The miracle needed for his beatification was investigated in the diocese of its origin and received validation from Roman officials on 17 March 1995. Full investigation into the miracle could not go ahead until Pollo was declared Venerable - this occurred in 1997. The medical board advising the C.C.S. approved it on 5 March 1998 while theologians voiced their approval also two weeks later on 20 March. The C.C.S. followed suit on 21 April 1998 and passed it to the pope for his approval around a week later.

John Paul II presided over the beatification of Pollo during his apostolic visit to the town of Vercelli on 23 May 1998.

[[File:Sexual cycle.svg|thumb|250px|right|In the first stage of sexual reproduction, "meiosis", the number of chromosomes is reduced from a [[diploid]] number (2n) to a [[haploid]] number (n). During "fertilization", haploid gametes come together to form a diploid zygote and the original number of chromosomes is restored.]]

'''Sexual reproduction''' is a kind of [[Biological life cycle|life cycle]] where generations alternate between cells with a single set of [[chromosome]]s ([[haploid]]) and cells with a double set of chromosomes ([[diploid]]).&lt;ref&gt;John Maynard Smith &amp; Eörz Szathmáry, The Major Transitions in Evolution, [[W. H. Freeman and Company]], 1995, p 149&lt;/ref&gt; ''Sexual reproduction'' is by far the most common life cycle in [[eukaryotes]], for example animals and plants. 

Diploid cells divide into haploid cells in a process called [[meiosis]]. Two haploid cells combine into one diploid cell in a process called [[fertilisation]]. Between fertilisation and meiosis there can be a large number of [[mitosis|cell division]]s without change of the number of chromosomes.  

[[Fertilization]] creates a single-celled [[zygote]] which includes genetic material from both gametes. In a process called [[genetic recombination]], genetic material ([[DNA]]) joins up so that [[homologous chromosome]] sequences are aligned with each other, and this is followed by exchange of genetic information. Two rounds of cell division then produce four daughter cells with half the number of chromosomes from each original parent cell, and the same number of chromosomes as both parents. For instance, in [[human reproduction]] each human cell contains 46 chromosomes in 23 pairs. Meiosis in the parents' gonads produce gamete cells which only contain 23 chromosomes each. When the gametes are combined via [[sexual intercourse]] to form a fertilized egg, the resulting child will have 23 chromosomes from each parent genetically recombined into 23 chromosome pairs or 46 total.

Cell division [[mitosis]] then initiates the development of a new individual [[organism]] in [[multicellular organism]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/fertilization | title = Fertilization | publisher = Merriam-Webster | accessdate = 2013-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[animal]]s and [[plant]]s, for the vast majority of whom this is the primary method of reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Otto|first1=Sarah P.|last2=Lenormand|first2=Thomas|title=EVOLUTION OF SEX: RESOLVING THE PARADOX OF SEX AND RECOMBINATION|journal=Nature Reviews Genetics|date=1 April 2002|volume=3|issue=4|pages=252–261|doi=10.1038/nrg761|pmid=11967550}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[evolution of sexual reproduction]] is a major puzzle because [[asexual reproduction]] should be able to outcompete it as every young organism created can bear its own young. This implies that an asexual population has an intrinsic capacity to grow more rapidly with each generation.&lt;ref name="maynard"&gt;[[John Maynard Smith]] ''The Evolution of Sex'' 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; This 50% cost is a [[fitness (biology)|fitness]] disadvantage of sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;Ridley M (2004) Evolution, 3rd edition. Blackwell Publishing, p. 314.&lt;/ref&gt; The two-fold cost of sex includes this cost and the fact that any organism can only pass on 50% of its own genes to its offspring. One definite advantage of sexual reproduction is that it prevents the accumulation of genetic [[mutation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1038/ng.3216 | pmid = 25685891 | laydate = 4 March 2015 | laysummary = http://www.oxfordtoday.ox.ac.uk/opinion/making-sense-sex | journal = Nature Genetics | title = Recombination affects accumulation of damaging and disease-associated mutations in human populations | year = 2015 | last1 = Hussin | first1 = Julie G | last2 = Hodgkinson | first2 = Alan | last3 = Idaghdour | first3 = Youssef | last4 = Grenier | first4 = Jean-Christophe | last5 = Goulet | first5 = Jean-Philippe| last6 = Gbeha | first6 = Elias | last7 = Hip-Ki | first7 = Elodie | last8 = Awadalla | first8 = Philip | volume=47 | issue = 4 | pages=400–404}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Sexual selection]] is a mode of [[natural selection]] in which some individuals out-reproduce others of a population because they are better at securing [[Mating|mates]] for sexual reproduction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biology: The Unity &amp; Diversity of Life|year=2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|page=281|author=Cecie Starr|edition=Ralph Taggart, Christine Evers, Lisa Starr}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="PHYS-20140129"&gt;{{cite news |last=Vogt |first=Yngve |title=Large testicles are linked to infidelity |url=http://phys.org/news/2014-01-large-testicles-linked-infidelity.html |date=January 29, 2014 |work=[[Phys.org]] |accessdate=January 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been described as "a powerful evolutionary force that does not exist in asexual populations."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=11395771|year=2001|author1=Agrawal|first1=A. F.|title=Sexual selection and the maintenance of sexual reproduction|journal=Nature|volume=411|issue=6838|pages=692–5|doi=10.1038/35079590}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Prokaryote]]s, whose initial cell has additional or transformed genetic material, reproduce through asexual reproduction but may,  in [[lateral gene transfer]], display processes such as [[bacterial conjugation]], [[transformation (genetics)|transformation]] and [[transduction (genetics)|transduction]], which are similar to sexual reproduction although they do not lead to reproduction.

==Evolution==
{{main|Evolution of sexual reproduction}}
The first [[fossil]]ized evidence of sexual reproduction in eukaryotes is from the [[Stenian]] period, about 1 to 1.2 billion years ago.&lt;ref name=dateref&gt;
{{cite journal | author = N.J. Buttefield | year = 2000 | title = Bangiomorpha pubescens n.  gen., n. sp.: implications for the evolution of sex, multicellularity,  and the Mesoproterozoic/Neoproterozoic radiation of eukaryotes | url = http://paleobiol.geoscienceworld.org/content/26/3/386.abstract | journal = [[Paleobiology (journal)|Paleobiology]] | volume = 26 | issue = 3 | pages = 386–404 | doi = 10.1666/0094-8373(2000)026&lt;0386:BPNGNS&gt;2.0.CO;2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biologists studying [[evolution]] propose several explanations for why sexual reproduction developed and why it is maintained. These reasons include reducing the likelihood of the [[Mullers ratchet|accumulation]] of deleterious mutations, increasing rate of [[red queen hypothesis|adaptation to changing environments]],&lt;ref name=Gray2012&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Gray | first1 = J. C. | last2 = Goddard | first2 = M. R. | title = Gene-flow between niches facilitates local adaptation in sexual populations | journal = Ecology Letters | volume = 15 | issue = 9 | pages =  955–962| year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc =  | doi = 10.1111/j.1461-0248.2012.01814.x | editor1-first = Michael | editor1-last = Bonsall }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[tangled bank hypothesis|dealing with competition]], and masking deleterious mutations.&lt;ref name="Michod"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Michod RE, Bernstein H, Nedelcu AM | title = Adaptive value of sex in microbial pathogens | journal = Infect. Genet. Evol. | volume = 8 | issue = 3 | pages = 267–85 |date=May 2008  | pmid = 18295550 | doi = 10.1016/j.meegid.2008.01.002 | url = http://www.hummingbirds.arizona.edu/Faculty/Michod/Downloads/IGE%20review%20sex.pdf | format=PDF| last2 = Bernstein | last3 = Nedelcu }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein2 "/&gt;  All of these ideas about why sexual reproduction has been maintained are generally supported, but ultimately the size of the population determines if sexual reproduction is entirely beneficial. Larger [[population]]s appear to respond more quickly to benefits obtained through sexual reproduction than do smaller population sizes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=12478292|year=2002|author1=Colegrave|first1=N|title=Sex releases the speed limit on evolution|journal=Nature|volume=420|issue=6916|pages=664–6|doi=10.1038/nature01191|bibcode=2002Natur.420..664C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maintenance of sexual reproduction has been explained by theories that work at several [[levels of selection]], though some of these models remain controversial.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} However, newer models presented in recent years suggest a basic advantage for sexual reproduction in slowly reproducing [[complex organism]]s.

Sexual reproduction allows these species to exhibit characteristics that depend on the specific [[Natural environment|environment]] that they inhabit, and the particular survival strategies that they employ.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s12064-009-0077-9|title=Diploidy and the selective advantage for sexual reproduction in unicellular organisms|year=2009|last1=Kleiman|first1=Maya|last2=Tannenbaum|first2=Emmanuel|journal=Theory in Biosciences|volume=128|issue=4|pages=249–85|pmid=19902285|arxiv=0901.1320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sexual selection==
{{main|Sexual selection}}
In order to sexually reproduce, both males and females need to find a [[mating|mate]]. Generally in animals [[mate choice]] is made by females while males compete to be chosen. This can lead [[organism]]s to extreme efforts in order to reproduce, such as combat and display, or produce extreme features caused by a [[positive feedback]] known as a [[Fisherian runaway]]. Thus sexual reproduction, as a form of [[natural selection]], has an effect on [[evolution]]. [[Sexual dimorphism]] is where the basic [[phenotypic trait]]s vary between males and females of the same [[species]]. Dimorphism is found in both [[sex organ]]s and in [[secondary sex characteristics]], body size, physical strength and morphology, [[biological ornament]]ation, [[behavior]] and other bodily traits. However, sexual selection is only implied over an extended period of time leading to sexual dimorphism.&lt;ref&gt;Dimijian, G. G. (2005). Evolution of sexuality: biology and behavior. Proceedings (Baylor University. Medical Center), 18, 244–258.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sex ratio==
Apart from some [[Eusociality|eusocial]] [[wasp]]s, organisms which reproduce sexually have a 1:1 [[sex ratio]] of male and female births. The English statistician and biologist [[Ronald Fisher]] outlined why this is so in what has come to be known as [[Fisher's principle]].&lt;ref name=Hamilton67&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1126/science.156.3774.477 | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = W.D. | year = 1967 | title = Extraordinary sex ratios | url = http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/refs/156/3774/477 | journal = Science | volume = 156 | issue = 3774| pages = 477–488 | pmid = 6021675 |bibcode = 1967Sci...156..477H }}&lt;/ref&gt; This essentially says the following:

:# Suppose male births are less common than female.
:# A newborn male then has better mating prospects than a newborn female, and therefore can expect to have more offspring.
:# Therefore parents genetically disposed to produce males tend to have more than average numbers of grandchildren born to them.
:# Therefore the genes for male-producing tendencies spread, and male births become more common.
:# As the 1:1 sex ratio is approached, the advantage associated with producing males dies away.
:# The same reasoning holds if females are substituted for males throughout. Therefore 1:1 is the equilibrium ratio.

===Insects===
{{further|Insect#Reproduction and development}}
[[File:Australian Emperor mating and laying.jpg|thumb|250px|[[Australian emperor]] laying egg, guarded by the male]]
Insect species make up more than two-thirds of all [[Extant taxon|extant]] animal species. Most insect species reproduce sexually, though some species are facultatively [[parthenogenetic]]. Many insects species have [[sexual dimorphism]], while in others the sexes look nearly identical. Typically they have two sexes with males producing spermatozoa and females ova. The ova develop into eggs that have a covering called the [[chorion]], which forms before internal fertilization. Insects have very diverse mating and reproductive strategies most often resulting in the male depositing [[spermatophore]] within the female, which she stores until she is ready for egg fertilization. After fertilization, and the formation of a zygote, and varying degrees of development, in many species the eggs are deposited outside the female; while in others, they develop further within the female and are born live.

{{main|Mammalian reproduction}}
{{See also|Human reproduction}}
There are three extant kinds of mammals: [[monotreme]]s, [[placental]]s and [[marsupial]]s, all with internal fertilization. In placental mammals, offspring are born as juveniles: complete animals with the [[sex organ]]s present although not reproductively functional. After several months or years, depending on the species, the sex organs develop further to maturity and the animal becomes [[Sexual maturity|sexually mature]].

===Fish===
{{further|Fish#Reproductive system}}
The vast majority of fish species lay eggs that are then fertilized by the male,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/bony-fish/reproduction.htm BONY FISHES - Reproduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; some species lay their eggs on a substrate like a rock or on plants, while others scatter their eggs and the eggs are fertilized as they drift or sink in the water column.

Some fish species use internal fertilization and then disperse the developing eggs or give birth to live offspring. Fish that have live-bearing offspring include the [[guppy]] and mollies or ''[[Poecilia]]''. Fishes that give birth to live young can be [[ovoviviparous]], where the eggs are fertilized within the female and the eggs simply hatch within the female body, or in [[seahorse]]s, the male carries the developing young within a pouch, and gives birth to live young.&lt;ref name=Cavendish2001&gt;

Some fish are [[hermaphrodite]]s, where a single fish is both male and female and can produce eggs and sperm. In hermaphroditic fish, some are male and female at the same time while in other fish they are serially hermaphroditic; starting as one sex and changing to the other. In at least one hermaphroditic species, self-fertilization occurs when the eggs and sperm are released together. Internal self-fertilization may occur in some other species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Orlando EF, Katsu Y, Miyagawa S, Iguchi T | year = 2006 | title = Cloning and differential  expression of estrogen receptor and aromatase genes in the self-fertilizing  hermaphrodite and male mangrove rivulus, Kryptolebias marmoratus | journal = [[Journal of Molecular Endocrinology]] | volume = 37 | issue = 2 | pages = 353–365 | doi = 10.1677/jme.1.02101 | pmid = 17032750 | last2 = Katsu | last3 = Miyagawa | last4 = Iguchi }}&lt;/ref&gt; One fish species does not reproduce by sexual reproduction but uses sex to produce offspring; ''[[Poecilia formosa]]'' is a unisex species that uses a form of [[parthenogenesis]] called [[gynogenesis]], where unfertilized eggs develop into embryos that produce female offspring. ''Poecilia formosa'' mate with males of other fish species that use internal fertilization, the sperm does not fertilize the eggs but stimulates the growth of the eggs which develops into embryos.&lt;ref&gt;

==Plants==
{{main|Plant reproduction}}
Animals typically produce gametes directly by meiosis. Male gametes are called sperm, and female gametes are called eggs or ova. In animals, fertilization follows immediately after meiosis. Plants on the other hand have mitosis occurring in spores, which are produced by meiosis. The spores germinate into the gametophyte phase. The gametophytes of different groups of plants vary in size; angiosperms have as few as three cells in pollen, and mosses and other so called primitive plants may have several million cells. Plants have an [[alternation of generations]] where the sporophyte phase is succeeded by the gametophyte phase. The sporophyte phase produces spores within the sporangium by meiosis.

===Flowering plants===
[[File:hosta3.jpg|thumb|right|Flowers are the sexual organs of flowering plants.]]
[[Flowering plant]]s are the dominant plant form on land and they reproduce either sexually or asexually. Often their most distinguishing feature is their reproductive organs, commonly called flowers.  The [[Stamen|anther]] produces [[pollen|pollen grains]] which contain the male [[gametophyte]]s (sperm). For pollination to occur, pollen grains must attach to the stigma of the female reproductive structure ([[carpel]]), where the female gametophytes (ovules) are located inside the [[ovary]]. After the pollen tube grows through the carpel's style, the [[sex]] cell nuclei from the pollen grain migrate into the ovule to fertilize the egg cell and endosperm nuclei within the female gametophyte in a process termed [[double fertilization]]. The resulting zygote develops into an embryo, while the triploid endosperm (one sperm cell plus two female cells) and female tissues of the ovule give rise to the surrounding tissues in the developing seed. The ovary, which produced the female gametophyte(s), then grows into a [[fruit]], which surrounds the seed(s). Plants may either [[Self-pollination|self-pollinate]] or [[pollination|cross-pollinate]].

Nonflowering plants like [[fern]]s, [[moss]] and [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s use other means of sexual reproduction.

In 2013, flowers dating from the [[Cretaceous]] (100 million years before present) were found encased in amber, the oldest evidence of sexual reproduction in a flowering plant. Microscopic images showed tubes growing out of pollen and penetrating the flower's stigma. The pollen was sticky, suggesting it was carried by insects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=George O |last=Poinar Jr. |first2=Kenton L |last2=Chambers |first3=Joerg |last3=Wunderlich |title=Micropetasos, a new genus of angiosperms from mid-Cretaceous Burmese amber |journal=J.

===Ferns===
Ferns mostly produce large diploid [[sporophyte]]s with [[rhizome]]s, roots and leaves; and on fertile leaves called [[sporangium]], [[spore]]s are produced. The spores are released and germinate to produce short, thin gametophytes that are typically heart shaped, small and green in color. The gametophytes or [[thallus]], produce both motile sperm in the [[antheridia]] and egg cells in separate [[archegonia]]. After rains or when dew deposits a film of water, the motile sperm are splashed away from the antheridia, which are normally produced on the top side of the thallus, and swim in the film of water to the archegonia where they fertilize the egg. To promote out crossing or cross fertilization the sperm are released before the eggs are receptive of the sperm, making it more likely that the sperm will fertilize the eggs of different thallus. A [[zygote]] is formed after fertilization, which grows into a new sporophytic plant. The condition of having separate sporephyte and gametophyte plants is called [[alternation of generation]]s. Other plants with similar reproductive means include the  ''[[Psilotum]]'', ''[[Lycopodium]]'', ''[[Selaginella]]'' and ''[[Equisetum]]''.

===Bryophytes===
The [[bryophyte]]s, which include [[Marchantiophyta|liverwort]]s, [[hornwort]]s and [[moss]]es, reproduce both sexually and [[Vegetative reproduction|vegetatively]]. They are small plants found growing in moist locations and like ferns, have motile sperm with [[flagella]] and need water to facilitate sexual reproduction. These plants start as a haploid spore that grows into the dominate form, which is a multicellular haploid body with leaf-like structures that [[photosynthesis|photosynthesize]]. Haploid gametes are produced in antherida and archegonia by mitosis. The sperm released from the antherida respond to chemicals released by ripe archegonia and swim to them in a film of water and fertilize the egg cells thus producing a zygote.  The [[zygote]] divides by mitotic division and grows into a sporophyte that is diploid.  The multicellular diploid sporophyte produces structures called spore capsules, which are connected by [[seta]] to the archegonia. The spore capsules produce spores by meiosis, when ripe the capsules burst open and the spores are released. Bryophytes show considerable variation in their breeding structures and the above is a basic outline. Also in some species each plant is one sex while other species produce both sexes on the same plant.&lt;ref&gt;

==Fungi==
{{Main|Mating in fungi}}
{{further|Fungus#Reproduction}}
[[File:Puffballs emitting spores.jpg|thumb|309x309px|Puffballs emitting spores]]
[[Fungi]] are classified by the methods of sexual reproduction they employ.  The outcome of sexual reproduction most often is the production of [[resting spore]]s that are used to survive inclement times and to spread. There are typically three phases in the sexual reproduction of fungi: [[plasmogamy]], [[karyogamy]] and [[meiosis]]. The cytoplasm of two parent cells fuse during plasmogamy and the nuclei fuse during karyogamy. New haploid gametes are formed during meiosis and develop into spores.

==Bacteria and archaea==
Three distinct processes in [[prokaryote]]s are regarded as similar to [[Origin and function of meiosis|eukaryotic sex]]: [[bacterial transformation]], which involves the incorporation of foreign DNA into the bacterial chromosome; [[bacterial conjugation]], which is a transfer of [[plasmid]] DNA between bacteria, but the plasmids are rarely incorporated into the bacterial chromosome; and [[Prokaryote#Gene transfer|gene transfer and genetic exchange in archaea]].

Bacterial transformation involves the [[genetic recombination|recombination of genetic material]] and its function is mainly associated with [[Sexual recombination#Recombinational repair|DNA repair]]. Bacterial transformation is a complex process encoded by numerous bacterial genes, and is a bacterial adaptation for DNA transfer.&lt;ref name="Michod" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bernstein1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1525/bio.2010.60.7.5|title=Evolutionary Origin of Recombination during Meiosis|year=2010|last1=Bernstein|first1=Harris|last2=Bernstein|first2=Carol|journal=BioScience|volume=60|issue=7|pages=498–505}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process occurs naturally in at least 40 bacterial species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=7968924|year=1994|last1=Lorenz|first1=MG|last2=Wackernagel|first2=W|title=Bacterial gene transfer by natural genetic transformation in the environment|volume=58|issue=3|pages=563–602|pmc=372978|journal=Microbiological Reviews}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a bacterium to bind, take up, and recombine exogenous DNA into its chromosome, it must enter a special physiological state referred to as competence (see [[Natural competence]]). Sexual reproduction in early single-celled eukaryotes may have evolved from bacterial transformation,&lt;ref name="Bernstein2"&gt;Bernstein H, Bernstein C, Michod RE. (2012) "[https://www.novapublishers.com/catalog/product_info.php?products_id=31918 DNA Repair as the Primary Adaptive Function of Sex in Bacteria and Eukaryotes]".

Open access for reading only. {{ISBN|978-1-62100-756-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; or from a similar process in archaea (see below).

On the other hand, bacterial conjugation is a type of direct transfer of DNA between two bacteria through an external appendage called the conjugation pilus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22986519|year=2012|last1=Lodé|first1=T|title=Have Sex or Not?

The infrequent integration of a plasmid into a host bacterial chromosome, and the subsequent transfer of a part of the host chromosome to another cell do not appear to be bacterial adaptations.&lt;ref name="Michod" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Krebs|first1=JE|last2=Goldstein|first2=ES|last3=Kilpatrick|first3=ST|year=2011|title=Lewin's GENES X|pages=289–292|publisher=Jones and Bartlett Publishers|location=Boston|isbn=9780763766320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Suzana Amaral Rezende''' (born March 28, 1928 in [[São Paulo (state)|São Paulo]]) better known as '''Suzana Amaral''' is a Brazilian film director and screenwriter. She is best known for the 1985 film ''A Hora da Estrela'' ([[Hour of the Star]]).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://enciclopedia.itaucultural.org.br/en/pessoa107480/suzana-amaral|title=Suzana Amaral|last=|first=|date=|website=Enciclopédia Itaú Cultural|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Amaral’s film career started at the age of 37 when she entered the [[University of São Paulo]] film school. After graduating, she taught at the University for three years and began working for Radio and Television Cultura. In her 14-year career at Radio and Television Cultura she produced approximately 50 documentaries, films, and plays for the station.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Michael T. New Latin America Cinema. Vol. 2. Detroit: Wayne State University Press, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1976 she moved to New York to pursue a degree in film from the [[Tisch School of the Arts]] at  [[New York University]]. She completed this degree and graduated in 1978.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==''A Hora da Estrela''==
Amara's first feature film and best known work, ''A Hora da Estrela'' ([[Hour of the Star]]) was released in 1985. Based on the novel of the same name by [[Clarice Lispector]],&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1987/01/18/movies/suzana-amaral-her-hour-has-come.html?pagewanted=2 "Suzana Amaral: Her 'Hour' Has Come" from The New York Times]&lt;/ref&gt; the film focuses on the life of a troubled young protagonist, Macabéa ([[Marcélia Cartaxo]]), living in São Paulo. According to film critic Nissa Torrents, "the film upsets many stereotypes in its presentation of the female protagonist, who is neither beautiful nor middle-class. An anti-heroine, starved of affection and respect, she wanders through life looking for an image she can adopt and adapt."&lt;ref&gt;Annette Kuhn and Susannah Radstone, eds., ''The Women’s Companion to International Film'' (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1994), 13.&lt;/ref&gt;
The film was well received at its release and was a [[List of submissions to the 59th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film|Submission to the 59th Academy Awards for Best Foreign Language Film]]. Additionally, it was entered into the [[36th Berlin International Film Festival]], where actress [[Marcelia Cartaxo]] won the [[Silver Bear for Best Actress]].&lt;ref name="Berlinale 1986"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1986/03_preistr_ger_1986/03_Preistraeger_1986.html |title=Berlinale: 1986 Prize Winners |accessdate=2011-01-14 |work=berlinale.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the 1985 Brasilia Film Festival the film won best picture and Amaral won best director. Additionally, the film also won best picture at the 1986 Havana Film Festival. Amaral was chosen as best director at the 1986 International Woman’s Film Festival. ''A Hora da Estrela'' was shot in four weeks on a budget of $150,000, 70% of which was funded by Embrafilme. The success of ''A Hora da Estrela'' led Amaral to immediate notoriety, though none of her other films have achieved such success.

==Personal life==
Amaral has nine children, one of which was born while she was pursuing her film studies in São Paulo. She has said that she was ""totally dedicated to motherhood" for 10 years" before deciding to pursue her dream of filmmaking.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; She is divorced.
Amaral is an avid follower of Bollywood films who says she wants Indian films to come to Brazil in a big way.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sify.com/movies/bollywood-should-come-to-brazil-suzana-amaral-news-bollywood-kkfr1Hejhgdsi.html Sify]&lt;/ref&gt; Amaral is a Buddhist.

From my mother's sleep I fell into the State,
And I hunched in its belly till my wet fur froze.
Six miles from earth, loosed from its dream of life,
I woke to black flak and the nightmare fighters.
When I died they washed me out of the turret with a hose.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
                  
Jarrell, who served in the [[United States Army Air Forces|Army Air Forces]], provided the following explanatory note:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
A [[ball turret]] was a [[Plexiglas]] sphere set into the belly of a [[B-17 Flying Fortress|B-17]] or [[B-24]], and inhabited by two .50 caliber machine guns and one man, a short small man. When this gunner tracked with his machine guns a fighter attacking his bomber from below, he revolved with the turret; hunched upside-down in his little sphere, he looked like the fetus in the womb [in fact, the ball-turret gunner sat upright, if in an uncomfortable position. In a real foetus he would be in a [[Breech birth|breech position]], even more vulnerable to the foetus]. The fighters which attacked him were armed with cannon firing explosive shells. The hose was a steam hose.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Reviewer Leven M. Dawson says that "The theme of Randall Jarrell's 'The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner' is that institutionalized violence, or war, creates moral paradox, a condition in which acts repugnant to human nature become appropriate."&lt;ref&gt;Leven M. Dawson. [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/jarrell/turret.htm from The Explicator 31.4 (December 1972)], Item #29.&lt;/ref&gt; Most commentators agree, calling the poem a condemnation of the dehumanizing powers of "the State", which are most graphically exhibited by the violence of war.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Horner. [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/jarrell/turret.htm from ''The Explicator'' 36.4 (Summer 1978)], pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

Due partly to its short length, "The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner" poem has been widely anthologized.  In fact, Jarrell came to fear that his reputation would come to rest on it alone.&lt;ref&gt;Charlotte H. Beck. [http://www.english.uiuc.edu/maps/poets/g_l/jarrell/turret.htm from ''Worlds and Lives: The Poetry of Randall Jarrell'']. 1983. Associated Faculty Press, Inc.&lt;/ref&gt;

The poem inspired the play, "The Death of the Ball Turret Gunner" by Anna Moench, which premiered in New York City at the New York International Fringe Festival in August 2008 and was extended to play at The Space in Long Island City. A nod to the poem can also be found in [[John Irving]]'s 1978 novel ''[[The World According to Garp]],'' in which the protagonist's father died from a "rather careless lobotomy" by enemy gunfire while serving as a ball-turret gunner in World War II.

[[File:William S. Gilbert (1878).jpg|right|thumb|300px|&lt;center&gt;W. S. Gilbert&lt;/center&gt;]]
'''Sir William Schwenck Gilbert'''{{refn|The name ''Gilbert'' is pronounced with a [[Hard and soft g#English|hard G]].|group= n}} (18 November 1836&amp;nbsp;– 29 May 1911) was an English [[dramatist]], [[libretto|librettist]], poet and illustrator best known for his [[Gilbert and Sullivan|collaboration]] with composer [[Arthur Sullivan]], which produced fourteen [[comic opera]]s.&lt;!--His and Sullivan's preferred term. The G&amp;S Project [[WP:G&amp;S]] uses this term for all of their works.--&gt; The most famous of these include ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'', ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' and one of the most frequently performed works in the history of musical theatre, ''[[The Mikado]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Kenrick, John. [http://www.musicals101.com/gilbert3.htm ''G&amp;S Story: Part III''], accessed 13 October 2006; and Powell, Jim. [http://www.libertystory.net/LSARTSGILBERT.htm ''William S. Gilbert's Wicked Wit for Liberty''] accessed 13 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The popularity of these works was supported for over a century by year-round performances of them, in Britain and abroad, by the repertory company that Gilbert, Sullivan and their producer [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]] founded, the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]. These [[Savoy opera]]s continue to be frequently performed in the English-speaking world and beyond.&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, Chapter 1 and ''passim''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert's creative output included over 75 plays and [[libretto|libretti]], and numerous short stories, poems and lyrics, both comic and serious. After brief careers as a government clerk and a lawyer, Gilbert began to focus, in the 1860s, on writing light verse, including his ''[[Bab Ballads]]'', short stories, theatre reviews and illustrations, often for ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'' magazine. He also began to write [[Victorian burlesque|burlesques]] and his first comic plays, developing a unique absurdist, inverted style that would later be known as his "topsy-turvy" style. He also developed a [[realism (arts)|realistic]] method of stage direction and a reputation as a strict theatre director. In the 1870s, Gilbert wrote 40 plays and libretti, including his [[German Reed Entertainments]], several blank-verse "fairy comedies", some serious plays, and his first five collaborations with Sullivan: ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis]], [[Trial by Jury]], [[The Sorcerer]], H.M.S. Pinafore'' and ''The Pirates of Penzance''. In the 1880s, Gilbert focused on the Savoy operas, including ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'', ''[[Iolanthe]]'', ''The Mikado'', ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' and ''[[The Gondoliers]]''.

In 1890, after this long and profitable creative partnership, Gilbert quarrelled with Sullivan and their producer, [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], concerning expenses at the Savoy Theatre; the dispute is referred to as the "carpet quarrel". Gilbert won the ensuing lawsuit, but the argument caused hurt feelings among the partnership. Although Gilbert and Sullivan were persuaded to collaborate on two last operas, they were not as successful as the previous ones. In later years, Gilbert wrote several plays, and a few operas with other collaborators. He retired, with his wife Lucy, and their ward, [[Nancy McIntosh]], to a country estate, [[Grim's Dyke]]. He was [[Knight bachelor|knight]]ed in 1907. Gilbert died of a heart attack while attempting to rescue a young woman to whom he was giving a swimming lesson in the lake at his home.

Gilbert's plays inspired other dramatists, including [[Oscar Wilde]] and [[George Bernard Shaw]],&lt;ref&gt;Feingold, Michael, [http://www.villagevoice.com/arts/engaging-the-past-7140486 "Engaging the Past"], ''The Village Voice'', 4 May 2004&lt;/ref&gt; and his comic operas with Sullivan inspired the later development of American [[musical theatre]], especially influencing Broadway librettists and lyricists. According to ''[[The Cambridge History of English and American Literature]]'', Gilbert's "lyrical facility and his mastery of metre raised the poetical quality of comic opera to a position that it had never reached before and has not reached since".&lt;ref name=CambridgeHistory&gt;[http://www.bartelby.net/223/0815.html ''The Cambridge History of English and American Literature''], Volume XIII, Chapter VIII, Section 15 (1907–21)&lt;/ref&gt;

Gilbert was born at 17 [[Southampton Street, London|Southampton Street]], [[Strand, London|Strand]], London. His father, also named [[William Gilbert (author)|William]], was briefly a [[ship's doctor|naval surgeon]], who later became a writer of novels and short stories, some of which were illustrated by his son. Gilbert's mother was the former Anne Mary Bye Morris (1812–1888), the daughter of Thomas Morris, an apothecary.&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Stedman, Jane W. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/33400 "Gilbert, Sir William Schwenck (1836–1911)"], ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004, online edition, May 2008, accessed 10 January 2010 {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert's parents were distant and stern, and he did not have a particularly close relationship with either of them.  They quarrelled increasingly, and following the break-up of their marriage in 1876, his relationships with them, especially his mother, became even more strained.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, pp. 16–17&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert had three younger sisters, two of whom were born outside England because of the family's travels during these years: Jane Morris (b. 1838 in [[Milan]], Italy – 1906), who married Alfred Weigall, a miniatures painter; Mary Florence (b. 1843 in [[Boulogne]], France – 1911); and Anne Maude (1845–1932). The younger two never married.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, family tree and pp. 15–19&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Eden, David. ''Gilbert: Appearance and Reality'', p. 44, Sir Arthur Sullivan Society (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; . Gilbert was nicknamed "Bab" as a baby, and then "Schwenck", after his father's godparents.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

As a child, Gilbert travelled to Italy in 1838 and then France for two years with his parents, who finally returned to settle in London in 1847. He was educated at [[Boulogne-sur-Mer|Boulogne]], France, from the age of seven (he later kept his diary in French so that the servants could not read it),&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Robert, [http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/gilbert/plays/fallen_fairies/article.html "The Controversy Surrounding Gilbert's Last Opera"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 2 August 2011, accessed 21 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; then at Western Grammar School, [[Brompton, Kensington|Brompton]], London, and then at the [[Great Ealing School]], where he became head boy and wrote plays for school performances and painted scenery. He then attended [[King's College London]], graduating in 1856. He intended to take the examinations for a commission in the [[Royal Artillery]], but with the end of the [[Crimean War]], fewer recruits were needed, and the only commission available to Gilbert would have been in a [[line regiment]]. Instead he joined the [[British Civil Service|Civil Service]]: he was an assistant clerk in the [[Privy Council Office (United Kingdom)|Privy Council]] Office for four years and hated it. In 1859 he joined the [[Volunteer Force (Great Britain)|Militia]], a part-time volunteer force formed for the defence of Britain, with which he served until 1878 (in between writing and other work), reaching the rank of Captain.&lt;ref&gt;Pearson, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|He first joined the 5th West Yorkshire Militia, and later the Royal Aberdeenshire Highlanders. On leaving the Militia, Gilbert was given an honorary promotion to Major.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996) p. 157 and Ainger, p. 154&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} In 1863 he received a bequest of [[pound sterling|£]]300 that he used to leave the civil service and take up a brief career as a [[barrister]] (he had already entered the [[Inner Temple]] as a student), but his legal practice was not successful, averaging just five clients a year.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W. S. ed. [[Peter Haining (author)|Peter Haining]] – Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Gentle Alice Brown.jpg|thumb|left|One of Gilbert's illustrations for his [[Bab Ballads|Bab Ballad]] "Gentle Alice Brown"]]
To supplement his income from 1861 on, Gilbert wrote a variety of stories, comic rants, grotesque illustrations, theatre reviews (many in the form of a parody of the play being reviewed),&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, Jane W. ''W. S. Gilbert's Theatrical Criticism''. London: The Society for Theatre Research, 2000. {{ISBN|0-85430-068-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and, under the pseudonym "Bab" (his childhood nickname), illustrated poems for several comic magazines, primarily ''[[Fun (magazine)|Fun]]'', started in 1861 by [[Henry James Byron|H. J. Byron]]. He published stories, articles, and reviews in papers such as the ''[[Cornhill Magazine]], London Society, Tinsley's Magazine'' and ''Temple Bar''. In addition, Gilbert was the London correspondent for ''L'Invalide Russe'' and a drama critic for the ''Illustrated London Times''. In the 1860s he also contributed to [[Tom Hood]]'s Christmas annuals, to ''Saturday Night'', the ''Comic News'' and the ''Savage Club Papers''. ''[[The Observer]]'' newspaper in 1870 sent him to France as a war correspondent reporting on the [[Franco-Prussian War]].&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

[[File:Gilberts1867.gif|upright|thumb|Gilbert and his wife, Lucy, in 1867]]
The poems, illustrated humorously by Gilbert, proved immensely popular and were reprinted in book form as the ''[[Bab Ballads]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996), pp. 26–29.&lt;/ref&gt; {{refn|See also the introduction to Gilbert, W. S. (1908), ''The Bab Ballads,'' etc., which details the history of the collections it was drawn from.|group= n}} He would later return to many of these as source material for his plays and comic operas. Gilbert and his colleagues from ''Fun'', including [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]], [[Tom Hood]], [[Clement Scott]] and [[F. C. Burnand]] (who defected to ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' in 1862) frequented the Arundel Club, the [[Savage Club]], and especially Evans's café, where they had a table in competition with the ''Punch'' 'Round table'.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996), pp. 16–18.&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|See also Tom Robertson's play ''[[Society (play)|Society]]'', which fictionalised the evenings in Evans's café in one scene.&lt;ref&gt;Robertson, Tom. [https://archive.org/stream/societyandcastee00robeuoft/societyandcastee00robeuoft_djvu.txt ''Society''], Act 2, Scene 1&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

After a relationship in the mid-1860s with the novelist [[Annie Hall Cudlip|Annie Thomas]],&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 52&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert married Lucy Agnes Turner, whom he called "Kitty", in 1867; she was 11 years his junior. He wrote many affectionate letters to her over the years. Gilbert and Lucy were socially active both in London and later at [[Grim's Dyke]], often holding dinner parties and being invited to others' homes for dinner, in contrast to the picture painted by fictionalisations such as the film ''[[Topsy-Turvy]]''. The Gilberts had no children, but they had many pets, including some exotic ones.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 148 and Stedman (1996), pp. 318–20. See also Bond, Jessie. [http://gsarchive.net/books/bond/016.html Reminiscences, Chapter 16] and McIntosh, Nancy. "The Late Sir W. S. Gilbert's Pets" in the ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', Brian Jones, ed. Vol. 2 No. 18: Winter 2005 (reprinted from ''Country Life'', 3 June 1911), pp.&amp;nbsp;548–56&lt;/ref&gt;

===First plays===
Gilbert wrote and directed a number of plays at school, but his first professionally produced play was ''Uncle Baby'', which ran for seven weeks in the autumn of 1863.{{refn|David Eden (in ''Gilbert and Sullivan: The Creative Conflict'' 1986) and Andrew Crowther both speculate that the play was written in collaboration with Gilbert's father.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther (2011), p. 45&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

[[File:Pantomimes of 1866 - Hush-a-Bye Baby.png|thumb|left|250px|''Hush-a-Bye Baby, On the Tree Top'' – an 1866 pantomime by Gilbert and [[Charles Millward]]]]
In 1865–66, Gilbert collaborated with Charles Millward on several [[pantomime]]s, including one called ''Hush-a-Bye, Baby, On the Tree Top, or, Harlequin Fortunia, King Frog of Frog Island, and the Magic Toys of Lowther Arcade'' (1866).&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996), pp. 34–35.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert's first solo success came a few days after ''Hush-a-Bye Baby'' premiered. His friend and mentor, Tom Robertson, was asked to write a pantomime but did not think he could do it in the two weeks available, and so he recommended Gilbert instead. Written and rushed to the stage in 10 days, ''[[Dulcamara, or the Little Duck and the Great Quack]]'', a [[Victorian burlesque|burlesque]] of [[Gaetano Donizetti]]'s ''[[L'elisir d'amore]]'', proved extremely popular. This led to a long series of further Gilbert opera burlesques, [[pantomime]]s and [[farce]]s, full of awful [[pun]]s (traditional in burlesques of the period),&lt;ref name=LaViv&gt;Gilbert, W. S. ''[[La Vivandière (Gilbert)|La Vivandière, or, True to the Corps!]]'' (a burlesque of Donizetti's ''[[The Daughter of the Regiment]]'')&lt;/ref&gt; though showing, at times, signs of the satire that would later be a defining part of Gilbert's work.&lt;ref name=CambridgeHistory/&gt;{{refn|The full quote refers to ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'' and reads: "The satire is shrewd, but not profound; the young author is apt to sneer, and he has by no means learned to make the best use of his curiously logical fancy. That he occasionally degrades high and beautiful themes is not surprising. To do so had been the regular proceeding in burlesque, and the age almost expected it; but Gilbert's is not the then usual hearty cockney vulgarity."|group= n}} For instance:

{{cquote|That men were monkeys once—to that I bow;&lt;br/&gt;''(looking at Lord Margate)'' I know one who's less man than monkey, now;&lt;br /&gt;That monkeys once were men, peers, statesmen, flunkies—&lt;br /&gt;That's rather hard on unoffending monkeys!&lt;ref name=LaViv/&gt;}}

This was followed by Gilbert's penultimate operatic parody, ''[[Robert the Devil (Gilbert)|Robert the Devil]]'', a burlesque of [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s opera, ''[[Robert le diable (opera)|Robert le diable]]'', which was part of a triple bill that opened the [[Gaiety Theatre, London]], in 1868. The piece was Gilbert's biggest success to date, running for over 100 nights and being frequently revived and played continuously in the provinces for three years thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996), p. 62&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- The quote from The Pretty Druidess where Gilbert announces his leaving behind of these derivative works would be useful here. --&gt;In Victorian theatre, "[to degrade] high and beautiful themes&amp;nbsp;... had been the regular proceeding in burlesque, and the age almost expected it"&lt;ref name=CambridgeHistory/&gt; However, Gilbert's burlesques were considered unusually tasteful compared to the others on the London stage. [[Isaac Goldberg]] wrote that these pieces "reveal how a playwright may begin by making burlesque of opera and end by making opera of burlesque."&lt;ref&gt;Goldberg (1931), p. xvii&lt;/ref&gt;  Gilbert would depart even further from the burlesque style from about 1869 with plays containing original plots and fewer puns.  His first full-length prose comedy was ''[[An Old Score]]'' (1869).&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Andrew. Introduction to script of "An Old Score", reprinted at [http://www.haddon-hall.com/GilbertBooks/AnOldScore.html the Haddon Hall website] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304061111/http://www.haddon-hall.com/GilbertBooks/AnOldScore.html |date=4 March 2016 }}, accessed 21 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Theatre, at the time Gilbert began writing, had fallen into disrepute. Badly translated and adapted French [[operetta]]s and poorly written, prurient [[Victorian burlesque]]s dominated the London stage. As [[Jessie Bond]] vividly described it, "stilted tragedy and vulgar farce were all the would-be playgoer had to choose from, and the theatre had become a place of evil repute to the righteous British householder."&lt;ref name=JessieBond&gt;Bond, Jessie, [http://gsarchive.net/books/bond/intro.html ''Reminiscences'', Introduction.]&lt;/ref&gt; Bond created the mezzo-soprano roles in most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, and is here leading into a description of Gilbert's role reforming the Victorian theatre. &lt;ref name=JessieBond/&gt;

From 1869 to 1875, Gilbert joined with one of the leading figures in theatrical reform, [[Thomas German Reed]] (and his wife [[Priscilla Horton|Priscilla]]), whose [[German Reed Entertainment|Gallery of Illustration]] sought to regain some of theatre's lost respectability by offering family entertainments in London.&lt;ref name=JessieBond/&gt;  So successful were they that by 1885 Gilbert stated that original British plays were appropriate for an innocent 15-year-old girl in the audience.{{refn|Gilbert gave a speech in 1885 at a dinner to benefit the Dramatic and Musical Sick Fund, which is reprinted in ''The Era'', 21 February 1885, p. 14, in which he said: "In&amp;nbsp;... the dress circle on the rare occasion of the first performance of an original English play sits a young lady of fifteen.  She is a very charming girl—gentle, modest, sensitive—carefully educated and delicately nurtured&amp;nbsp;... an excellent specimen of a well-bred young English gentlewoman; and it is with reference to its suitability to the eyes and ears of this young lady that the moral fitness of every original English play is gauged on the occasion of its production.  It must contain no allusions that cannot be fully and satisfactorily explained to this young lady; it must contain no incident, no dialogue, that can, by any chance, summon a blush to this young lady's innocent face.&amp;nbsp;... I happen to know that, on no account whatever, would she be permitted to be present at a première of M. [[Victorien Sardou]] or M. [[Alexandre Dumas]].&amp;nbsp;... the dramatists of France can only ring out threadbare variations of that dirty old theme—the cheated husband, the faithless wife, and the triumphant lover."|group= n}}  Three months before the opening of Gilbert's last burlesque (''The Pretty Druidess''), the first of his pieces for the Gallery of Illustration, ''[[No Cards]]'', was produced. Gilbert created six [[German Reed Entertainment|musical entertainments]] for the German Reeds, some with music composed by Thomas German Reed.&lt;ref name=PlayList&gt;[http://gsarchive.net/gilbert/plays/plays_home.html List of Gilbert's Plays] at the Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The environment of the German Reeds' intimate theatre allowed Gilbert quickly to develop a personal style and freedom to control all aspects of production, including set, costumes, direction and stage management.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther (2011), pp. 82–83&lt;/ref&gt; These works were a success,&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996), pp. 69–80.&lt;/ref&gt; with Gilbert's first big hit at the Gallery of Illustration, ''[[Ages Ago]]'', opening in 1869. ''Ages Ago'' was also the beginning of a collaboration with the composer [[Frederic Clay]] that would last seven years and produce four works.&lt;ref name=CrowtherAgesAgo&gt;Crowther, Andrew, [http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/gilbert/plays/ages_ago/crowther_analysis.html "''Ages Ago'' – Early Days"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 23 August 2011, accessed 21 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It was at a rehearsal for ''Ages Ago'' that Clay formally introduced Gilbert to his friend, Arthur Sullivan.&lt;ref name=CrowtherAgesAgo/&gt;{{refn|This rehearsal was probably for a second run of ''Ages Ago'' in 1870.|group= n}}&lt;ref&gt;Crowther (2011), p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; The Bab Ballads and Gilbert's many early musical works gave him much practice as a lyricist even before his collaboration with Sullivan.

[[File:Ages Ago.png|thumb|left|250px|''[[Ages Ago]]'', 1870]]
Many of the plot elements of the German Reed Entertainments (as well as some from his earlier plays and Bab Ballads) would be reused by Gilbert later in the [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas. These elements include paintings coming to life (''Ages Ago'', used again in ''[[Ruddigore]]''), a deaf nursemaid binding a respectable man's son to a "pirate" instead of to a "pilot" by mistake (''[[Our Island Home]]'', 1870, reused in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]''), and the forceful mature lady who is "an acquired taste" (''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'', 1875, reused in ''[[The Mikado]]'').&lt;ref&gt;Smith, J. Donald, ''[http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/reed_operas.htm W. S. Gilbert's Operas for the German Reeds]''&lt;/ref&gt; During this time, Gilbert perfected the 'topsy-turvy' style that he had been developing in his Bab Ballads, where the humour was derived by setting up a ridiculous premise and working out its logical consequences, however absurd.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther (2000), p. 35. See also Gilbert's play, ''[[Topsyturveydom]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mike Leigh]] describes the "Gilbertian" style as follows: "With great fluidity and freedom, [Gilbert] continually challenges our natural expectations. First, within the framework of the story, he makes bizarre things happen, and turns the world on its head. Thus the Learned Judge marries the Plaintiff, the soldiers metamorphose into aesthetes, and so on, and nearly every opera is resolved by a deft moving of the goalposts&amp;nbsp;... His genius is to fuse opposites with an imperceptible sleight of hand, to blend the surreal with the real, and the caricature with the natural. In other words, to tell a perfectly outrageous story in a completely deadpan way."&lt;ref name = "MikeLeigh"&gt;Leigh, Mike.

At the same time, Gilbert created several "fairy comedies" at the [[Haymarket Theatre]]. This series of plays was founded upon the idea of self-revelation by characters under the influence of some magic or some supernatural interference.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savoyoperas.org.uk/others/pygmalion.html "Miss Anderson as Galatea", ''The New-York Times'', 1883 January 23 32(9791): 5, col. 3 Amusements] Downloaded 15 October 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The first was ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' (1870), based partly on a story by [[Madame de Genlis]].  In 1871, with ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'', one of seven plays that he produced that year, Gilbert scored his greatest hit to date.  Together, these plays and their successors such as ''[[The Wicked World]]'' (1873), ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]'' (1874), and ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875), did for Gilbert on the dramatic stage what the German Reed entertainments had done for him on the musical stage: they established that his capabilities extended far beyond burlesque, won him artistic credentials, and demonstrated that he was a writer of wide range, as comfortable with human drama as with farcical humour. The success of these plays, especially ''Pygmalion and Galatea'', gave Gilbert a prestige that would be crucial to his later collaboration with as respected a musician as Sullivan.&lt;ref name=Wren&gt;Wren, p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt;

During this period, Gilbert also pushed the boundaries of how far satire could go in the theatre. He collaborated with [[Gilbert Arthur à Beckett]] on ''[[The Happy Land]]'' (1873), a political satire (in part, a parody of his own ''The Wicked World''), which was briefly banned because of its unflattering caricatures of [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]] and his ministers.&lt;ref&gt;Rees, Terence. "''The Happy Land'': its true and remarkable history" in ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'' vol. 1, no. 8 (1994), pp. 228–37&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, ''[[The Realm of Joy]]'' (1873) was set in the lobby of a theatre performing a scandalous play (implied to be the ''Happy Land''), with many jokes at the expense of the [[Lord Chamberlain]] (the "Lord High Disinfectant", as he's referred to in the play).&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Andrew.

Once he became established, Gilbert was the stage director for his plays and operas and had strong opinions on how they should best be performed.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; He was strongly influenced by the innovations in "stagecraft", now called stage direction, by the playwrights [[James Planché]] and especially [[Thomas William Robertson|Tom Robertson]].&lt;ref name=JessieBond /&gt; Gilbert attended rehearsals directed by Robertson to learn this art first-hand from the older director, and he began to apply it in some of his earliest plays.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther (2011), p. 74&lt;/ref&gt; He sought realism in acting, settings, costumes and movement, if not in content of his plays (although he did write a romantic comedy in the "naturalist" style, as a tribute to Robertson, ''[[Sweethearts (play)|Sweethearts]]''), shunned self-conscious interaction with the audience, and insisted on a style of portrayal in which the characters were never aware of their own absurdity, but were coherent internal wholes.&lt;ref&gt;Cox-Ife, ''passim''.

In Gilbert's 1874 burlesque, ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'', the character Hamlet, in his speech to the players, sums up Gilbert's theory of comic acting: "I hold that there is no such antick fellow as your bombastical hero who doth so earnestly spout forth his folly as to make his hearers believe that he is unconscious of all incongruity".&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W. S. ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'', Tableau III, 1874&lt;/ref&gt; Robertson "introduced Gilbert both to the revolutionary notion of disciplined rehearsals and to mise-en-scène or unity of style in the whole presentation – direction, design, music, acting."&lt;ref name = "MikeLeigh"/&gt; Like Robertson, Gilbert demanded discipline in his actors.  He required that his actors know their words perfectly, enunciate them clearly and obey his stage directions, which was something quite new to many actors of the day.&lt;ref name="Cox-Ife1"&gt;Cox-Ife, ''foreword''&lt;/ref&gt; A major innovation was the replacement of the star actor with the disciplined ensemble, "raising the director to a new position of dominance" in the theatre.&lt;ref name=utility&gt;Stedman, Jane W.

==Collaboration with Sullivan==
[[File:Sir Arthur Seymour Sullivan.jpg|upright|thumb|Sir Arthur Sullivan]]

===First collaborations amidst other works===
In 1871, John Hollingshead commissioned Gilbert to work with Sullivan on a holiday piece for Christmas, ''[[Thespis (opera)|Thespis, or The Gods Grown Old]]'', at the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]]. ''Thespis'' outran five of its nine competitors for the 1871 holiday season, and its run was extended beyond the length of a normal run at the Gaiety,&lt;ref&gt;Walters, Michael.  "Thespis: a reply",  ''W. S. Gilbert Society Journal'', Vol. 4, part 3, Issue 29.  Summer 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, nothing more came of it at that point, and Gilbert and Sullivan went their separate ways. Gilbert worked again with Clay on ''[[Happy Arcadia]]'' (1872), and with [[Alfred Cellier]] on ''[[Topsyturveydom]]'' (1874), as well as writing several farces, operetta libretti, [[extravaganza]]s, fairy comedies, adaptations from novels, translations from the French, and the dramas described above. Also in 1874, he published his last contribution for ''Fun'' magazine (''"Rosencrantz and Guildenstern"''), after a gap of three years, then resigned due to disapproval of the new owner's other publishing interests.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, John Bush, "W. S. Gilbert's Contributions to Fun, 1865–1874", published in the ''Bulletin of the New York Public Library'', vol 73 (April 1969), pp. 253–66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Thespis - Illustrated London News Jan 6 1872.png|thumb|left|Illustration of ''Thespis'' in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'', 6 January 1872]]
It would be nearly four years after ''Thespis'' was produced before the two men worked together again. In 1868, Gilbert had published a short comic sketch in ''Fun'' magazine titled "Trial by Jury: An Operetta". In 1873, Gilbert was asked by the theatrical manager, [[Carl Rosa]], to write a work for his planned 1874 season. Gilbert expanded ''Trial'' into a one-act libretto. However, Rosa's wife [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa]], a childhood friend of Gilbert's, died after an illness in 1874 and Rosa dropped the project.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 121&lt;/ref&gt; Later in 1874 Gilbert offered the libretto to [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]], but Carte could not use the piece at that time. By early 1875, Carte was managing the [[Royalty Theatre]], and he needed a short opera to be played as an afterpiece to [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]]'s ''[[La Périchole]]''. He contacted Gilbert, asked about the piece, and suggested Sullivan to set the work. Sullivan was enthusiastic, and ''[[Trial by Jury]]'' was composed in a matter of weeks. The little piece was a runaway hit, outlasting the run of ''La Périchole'' and being revived at another theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Walbrook, H. M. (1922), [http://gsarchive.net/books/walbrook/chap3.html ''Gilbert and Sullivan Opera, a History and Comment'' (Chapter 3)].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Richard Traubner quotes Sullivan's recollection of Gilbert reading the libretto of ''Trial by Jury'' to him: "As soon as he had come to the last word he closed up the manuscript violently, apparently unconscious of the fact that he had achieved his purpose so far as I was concerned, in as much as I was screaming with laughter the whole time."&lt;ref&gt;Traubner, Richard. ''Operetta: A Theatrical History'', p. 153, Taylor &amp; Francis (2003) {{ISBN|0203509021}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

[[File:W.S. Gilbert's burlesque comedy, Engaged.jpg|thumb|250px|''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), continues to be produced]]
Gilbert continued his quest to gain respect in and respectability for his profession. One thing that may have been holding dramatists back from respectability was that plays were not published in a form suitable for a "gentleman's library", as, at the time, they were generally cheaply and unattractively published for the use of actors rather than the home reader. To help rectify this, at least for himself, Gilbert arranged in late 1875 for publishers Chatto and Windus to print a volume of his plays in a format designed to appeal to the general reader, with an attractive binding and clear type, containing Gilbert's most respectable plays, including his most serious works, but mischievously capped off with ''Trial by Jury''.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert (1875), ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

After the success of ''Trial by Jury'', there were discussions towards reviving ''Thespis'', but Gilbert and Sullivan were not able to agree on terms with Carte and his backers. The score to ''Thespis'' was never published, and most of the music is now lost. It took some time for Carte to gather funds for another Gilbert and Sullivan opera, and in this gap Gilbert produced several works including ''[[Tom Cobb]]'' (1875), ''[[Eyes and No Eyes]]'' (1875, his last German Reed Entertainment), and ''[[Princess Toto]]'' (1876), his last and most ambitious work with Clay, a three-act comic opera with full orchestra, as opposed to the shorter works for much reduced accompaniment that came before. Gilbert also wrote two serious works during this time, ''[[Broken Hearts]]'' (1875) and ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876).&lt;ref name=PlayList/&gt;

Also during this period, Gilbert wrote, ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), which inspired [[Oscar Wilde]]'s ''[[The Importance of Being Earnest]]''. ''Engaged'' is a parody of romantic drama written in the "topsy-turvy" satiric style of many of Gilbert's Bab Ballads and the [[Savoy Opera]]s, with one character pledging his love, in the most poetic and romantic language, to every single woman in the play; the "innocent" Scottish rustics being revealed to be making a living through throwing trains off the lines and then charging the passengers for services, and, in general, romance being gladly thrown over in favour of monetary gain. The ''New York Times'' reviewer wrote in 1879, "Mr Gilbert, in his best work, has always shown a tendency to present improbabilities from a probable point of view, and in one sense, therefore, he can lay claim to originality; fortunately this merit in his case is supported by a really poetic imagination. In [''Engaged''] the author gives full swing to his humor, and the result, although exceedingly ephemeral, is a very amusing combination of characters – or caricatures – and mock-heroic incidents."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1879/02/18/archives/dramtic-and-musical-park-theatre.html "Dramatic and Musical"], ''[[The New York Times]]'', 18 February 1879, p. 5 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Engaged'' continues to be performed today by both professional and amateur companies.&lt;ref&gt;Corry, John.

Carte finally assembled a syndicate in 1877 and formed the Comedy Opera Company to launch a series of original English comic operas, beginning with a third collaboration between Gilbert and Sullivan, ''[[The Sorcerer]]'', in November 1877. This work was a modest success,&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 147–52&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' followed in May 1878. Despite a slow start, mainly due to a scorching summer, ''Pinafore'' became a red-hot favourite by autumn. After a dispute with Carte over the division of profits, the other Comedy Opera Company partners hired thugs to storm the theatre one night to steal the sets and costumes, intending to mount a rival production. The attempt was repelled by stagehands and others at the theatre loyal to Carte, and Carte continued as sole impresario of the newly renamed [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]].&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Jessie, [http://gsarchive.net/books/bond/004.html Chapter 4].&lt;/ref&gt; Indeed, ''Pinafore'' was so successful that over a hundred unauthorised productions sprang up in America alone. Gilbert, Sullivan and Carte tried for many years to control the American performance copyrights over their operas, without success.&lt;ref&gt;Rosen, Zvi S.

For the next decade, the [[Savoy opera|Savoy Operas]] (as the series came to be known, after the [[Savoy Theatre|theatre]] Carte later built to house them) were Gilbert's principal activity. The successful comic operas with Sullivan continued to appear every year or two, several of them being among the longest-running productions up to that point in the history of the musical stage.&lt;ref name=beauty&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-longr.html List of longest running London shows through 1920].&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|''Pinafore'', ''Patience'' and ''The Mikado'' each held the position of second longest-running musical theatre production in history for a time (after adjusting Pinafore's initial run down to 571 performances), and ''The Gondoliers'' was not far behind.&lt;ref name=beauty/&gt;|group= n}} After ''Pinafore'' came ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' (1879), ''[[Patience (opera)|Patience]]'' (1881), ''[[Iolanthe]]'' (1882), ''[[Princess Ida]]'' (1884, based on Gilbert's earlier farce, ''[[The Princess (play)|The Princess]]''), ''[[The Mikado]]'' (1885), ''[[Ruddigore]]'' (1887), ''[[The Yeomen of the Guard]]'' (1888) and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889). Gilbert not only directed and oversaw all aspects of production for these works, but he actually ''designed'' the costumes himself for ''Patience'', ''Iolanthe'', ''Princess Ida'', and ''Ruddigore''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gsarchive.net/whowaswho/G/GilbertWS.htm  Profile of W.

During this time, Gilbert and Sullivan also collaborated on one other major work, the oratorio ''[[The Martyr of Antioch]]'', premiered at the Leeds music festival in October 1880. Gilbert arranged the original epic poem by [[Henry Hart Milman]] into a libretto suitable for the music, and it contains some original work. During this period, also, Gilbert occasionally wrote plays to be performed elsewhere–both serious dramas (for example ''[[The Ne'er-Do-Weel]]'', 1878; and [[Gretchen (play)|Gretchen]], 1879) and humorous works (for example ''[[Foggerty's Fairy]]'', 1881). However, he no longer needed to turn out multiple plays each year, as he had done before. Indeed, during the more than nine years that separated ''The Pirates of Penzance'' and ''The Gondoliers'', he wrote just three plays outside of the partnership with Sullivan.&lt;ref name=PlayList/&gt; Only one of these works, ''Comedy and Tragedy'', proved successful.&lt;ref&gt;''Foggerty's Fairy'': Crowther, Andrew.

With respect to ''[[Brantinghame Hall]]'', Stedman writes, "It was a failure, the worst failure of Gilbert's career."&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996), p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1878, Gilbert realised a lifelong dream to play [[Harlequinade|Harlequin]], which he did at the Gaiety Theatre as part of an amateur charity production of ''[[The Forty Thieves]]'', partly written by himself.   Gilbert trained for Harlequin's stylised dancing with his friend [[John D'Auban]], who had arranged the dances for some of his plays and would choreograph most of the Gilbert and Sullivan operas.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;"Mr. D'Auban's 'Startrap' Jumps".

===Carpet quarrel and end of the collaboration===
Gilbert sometimes had a strained working relationship with Sullivan, partly because each man saw himself allowing his work to be subjugated to the other's, and partly due to their opposing personalities.  Gilbert was often confrontational and notoriously thin-skinned, though prone to acts of extraordinary kindness, while Sullivan eschewed conflict.&lt;ref name=Carpet&gt;Crowther, Andrew, [http://www.gilbertandsullivanarchive.org/articles/html/quarrel.html "The Carpet Quarrel Explained"], The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, 28 June 1997, accessed 22 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Gilbert imbued his libretti with "topsy-turvy" situations in which the social order was turned upside down. After a time, these subjects were often at odds with Sullivan's desire for realism and emotional content.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. Ainger, p. 288, or Wolfson, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Gilbert's political satire often poked fun at those in the circles of privilege, while Sullivan was eager to socialise among the wealthy and titled people who would become his friends and patrons.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g. Jacobs (1992); Crowther (2011); and Bond, Jessie.

Throughout their collaboration, Gilbert and Sullivan disagreed several times over the choice of a subject. After both ''Princess Ida'' and ''Ruddigore'', which were less successful than the seven other operas from ''H.M.S. Pinafore'' to ''The Gondoliers'', Sullivan asked to leave the partnership, saying that he found Gilbert's plots repetitive and that the operas were not artistically satisfying to him. While the two artists worked out their differences, Carte kept the Savoy open with revivals of their earlier works. On each occasion, after a few months' pause, Gilbert responded with a libretto that met Sullivan's objections, and the partnership continued successfully.&lt;ref name=Carpet/&gt;

In April 1890, during the run of ''The Gondoliers'', however, Gilbert challenged Carte over the expenses of the production. Among other items to which Gilbert objected, Carte had charged the cost of a new carpet for the Savoy Theatre lobby to the partnership.&lt;ref name=Ford&gt;Ford, Tom. [http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Article/259962,gs-the-lennonmccartney-of-the-19th-century.aspx "G&amp;S: the Lennon/McCartney of the 19th century"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130215051057/http://www.limelightmagazine.com.au/Article/259962,gs-the-lennonmccartney-of-the-19th-century.aspx |date=15 February 2013 }}. ''Limelight Magazine'', Haymarket Media Ltd., 8 June 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert believed that this was a maintenance expense that should be charged to Carte alone. Gilbert confronted Carte, who refused to reconsider the accounts. Gilbert stormed out and wrote to Sullivan that "I left him with the remark that it was a mistake to kick down the ladder by which he had risen".&lt;ref name=Carpet/&gt; [[Helen Carte]] wrote that Gilbert had addressed Carte "in a way that I should not have thought you would have used to an offending menial."&lt;ref&gt;Stedman, p. 270&lt;/ref&gt; As the scholar Andrew Crowther has commented:

:After all, the carpet was only one of a number of disputed items, and the real issue lay not in the mere money value of these things, but in whether Carte could be trusted with the financial affairs of Gilbert and Sullivan. Gilbert contended that Carte had at best made a series of serious blunders in the accounts, and at worst deliberately attempted to swindle the others. It is not easy to settle the rights and wrongs of the issue at this distance, but it does seem fairly clear that there was something very wrong with the accounts at this time. Gilbert wrote to Sullivan on 28 May 1891, a year after the end of the "Quarrel", that Carte had admitted "an unintentional overcharge of nearly £1,000 in the electric lighting accounts alone."&lt;ref name=Carpet/&gt;

Gilbert brought suit, and after ''The Gondoliers'' closed in 1891, he withdrew the performance rights to his libretti, vowing to write no more operas for the Savoy.&lt;ref name=vowed&gt;Shepherd, Marc. [http://gsarchive.net/grand_duke/html/index.html "Introduction: Historical Context"], ''The Grand Duke'', p. vii, New York: Oakapple Press, 2009.  Linked at ''The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive'', accessed 7 July 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert next wrote ''[[The Mountebanks (opera)|The Mountebanks]]'' with [[Alfred Cellier]] and the flop ''[[Haste to the Wedding]]'' with [[George Grossmith]],&lt;ref name=PlayList/&gt; and Sullivan wrote ''[[Haddon Hall (opera)|Haddon Hall]]'' with [[Sydney Grundy]]. Gilbert eventually won the lawsuit and felt vindicated, but his actions and statements had been hurtful to his partners. Nevertheless, the partnership had been so profitable that, after the financial failure of the [[Royal English Opera House]], Carte and his wife sought to reunite the author and composer.&lt;ref name=vowed/&gt;

[[File:Utopia Limited Poster.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The Drawing Room Scene from ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'']]
In 1891, after many failed attempts at reconciliation by the pair, [[Chappell &amp; Co.|Tom Chappell]], the music publisher responsible for printing the Gilbert and Sullivan operas, stepped in to mediate between two of his most profitable artists, and within two weeks had succeeded.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Two more operas resulted: ''[[Utopia, Limited]]'' (1893) and ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896). Gilbert also offered a third libretto to Sullivan (''[[His Excellency (opera)|His Excellency]]'', 1894), but Gilbert's insistence on casting [[Nancy McIntosh]], his protegée from ''Utopia'', led to Sullivan's refusal.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, pp. 61–65.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Utopia'', concerning an attempt to "anglicise" a south Pacific island kingdom, was only a modest success, and ''The Grand Duke'', in which a theatrical troupe, by means of a "statutory duel" and a conspiracy, takes political control of a grand duchy, was an outright failure. After that, the partnership ended for good.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, passim&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan continued to compose comic opera with other librettists but died four years later. In 1904, Gilbert would write, "...&amp;nbsp;Savoy opera was snuffed out by the deplorable death of my distinguished collaborator, Sir Arthur Sullivan. When that event occurred, I saw no one with whom I felt that I could work with satisfaction and success, and so I discontinued to write ''libretti''."&lt;ref&gt;Letter to the Editor, ''The Times'', 12 March 1904; p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Gilbert announced a retirement from the theatre after the short run of his last work with Sullivan, ''[[The Grand Duke]]'' (1896) and the poor reception of his 1897 play ''[[The Fortune Hunter]]'', he produced at least three more plays over the last dozen years of his life, including an unsuccessful opera, ''[[Fallen Fairies]]'' (1909), with [[Edward German]].&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, pp. 102–03.&lt;/ref&gt; Gilbert also continued to supervise the various revivals of his works by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, including its London Repertory seasons in 1906–09.&lt;ref&gt;Wolfson, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; His last play, ''[[The Hooligan]]'', produced just four months before his death, is a study of a young condemned thug in a prison cell.  Gilbert shows sympathy for his protagonist, the son of a thief who, brought up among thieves, kills his girlfriend.  As in some earlier work, the playwright displays "his conviction that nurture rather than nature often accounted for criminal behaviour".&lt;ref name=Bradley100&gt;Bradley, Ian.

''History Today'', Vol. 61, Issue 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;  The grim and powerful piece became one of Gilbert's most successful serious dramas, and experts conclude that, in those last months of Gilbert's life, he was developing a new style, a "mixture of irony, of social theme, and of grubby realism,"&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996), p. 343.&lt;/ref&gt; to replace the old "Gilbertianism" of which he had grown weary.&lt;ref&gt;Crowther, Andrew.

Pinafore]]'' and ''[[The Mikado]]'' giving, in some cases, backstory that is not found in the librettos.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996), p. 331&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W. S.

Gilbert was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] on 15 July 1907 in recognition of his contributions to drama.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 417–18&lt;/ref&gt; Sullivan had been knighted for his contributions to music almost a quarter of a century earlier, in 1883. Gilbert was, however, the first British writer ever to receive a knighthood for his plays alone—earlier dramatist knights, such as [[Sir William Davenant]] and [[Sir John Vanbrugh]], were knighted for political and other services.&lt;ref&gt;Stedman (1996), p. 328.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personality==
Gilbert was known for being sometimes prickly.  Aware of this general impression, he claimed that "If you give me your attention",&lt;ref&gt;Howarth, Paul and Feldman, A. [http://gsarchive.net/princess_ida/webop/pi_06.html "If you give me your attention"], Gilbert and Sullivan Archive, accessed 29 May 2011&lt;/ref&gt; the [[misanthrope]]'s song from ''[[Princess Ida]]'', was a satiric self-reference, saying: "I thought it my duty to live up to my reputation."&lt;ref name=Prickly&gt;Grossmith, George. "Recollections of Sir W. S. Gilbert", ''The Bookman'', vol. 40, no. 238, July 1911, p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; However, many people have defended him, often citing his generosity.  Actress [[May Fortescue]] recalled, "His kindness was extraordinary.  On wet nights and when rehearsals were late and the last buses were gone, he would pay the cab-fares of the girls whether they were pretty or not, instead of letting them trudge home on foot&amp;nbsp;... He was just as large-hearted when he was poor as when he was rich and successful.  For money as money he cared less than nothing.  Gilbert was no plaster saint, but he was an ideal friend."&lt;ref&gt;Dark and Grey, pp. 157–58&lt;/ref&gt; The journalist Frank M. Boyd wrote:

{{quote |I fancy that seldom was a man more generally given credit for a personality quite other than his own, than was the case with Sir W. S. Gilbert&amp;nbsp;... Till one actually came to know the man, one shared the opinion held by so many, that he was a gruff, disagreeable person; but nothing could be less true of the really great humorist. He had rather a severe appearance&amp;nbsp;... and like many other clever people, he had precious little use for fools of either sex, but he was at heart as kindly and lovable a man as you could wish to meet.&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, Frank M. [https://archive.org/stream/pelicanstalefift00boydrich/pelicanstalefift00boydrich_djvu.txt ''A Pelican's Tale, Fifty Years of London and Elsewhere''], p. 195, London: [[Herbert Jenkins Ltd]] (1919)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:WSGilbert by Spy.jpg|thumb|upright|Gilbert by the cartoonist [[Leslie Ward|'Spy']], 1880s]]
[[Jessie Bond]] wrote that Gilbert "was quick-tempered, often unreasonable, and he could not bear to be thwarted, but how anyone could call him unamiable I cannot understand."&lt;ref&gt;Bond, Jessie, [http://gsarchive.net/books/bond/016.html Chapter 16]&lt;/ref&gt; George Grossmith wrote to ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' that, although Gilbert had been described as an autocrat at rehearsals, "That was really only his manner when he was playing the part of stage director at rehearsals. As a matter of fact, he was a generous, kind true gentleman, and I use the word in the purest and original sense."&lt;ref name=GG1911&gt;George Grossmith's tribute to Gilbert in ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 7 June 1911&lt;/ref&gt;

Aside from his occasional creative disagreements with, and eventual rift from, Sullivan, Gilbert's temper led to the loss of friendships with a number of people. For instance, he quarrelled with his old associate [[C. H. Workman]], over the firing of Nancy McIntosh from the production of ''Fallen Fairies'', and with actress [[Henrietta Hodson]]. He also saw his friendship with theatre critic [[Clement Scott]] turn bitter.  However, Gilbert could be extraordinarily kind. During Scott's final illness in 1904, for instance, Gilbert donated to a fund for him, visited nearly every day, and assisted Scott's wife,&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Mrs. Clement, ''Old Days in Bohemian London'' (c.1910). New York: Frederick A. Stokes Company. pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt; despite having not been on friendly terms with him for the previous sixteen years.&lt;ref&gt;See Stedman (1996), pp. 254–56, 323–24&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Gilbert had written several plays at the behest of comic actor [[Edward Askew Sothern|Ned Sothern]]. However, Sothern died before he could perform the last of these, ''Foggerty's Fairy''.  Gilbert purchased the play back from his grateful widow.&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, pp. 193–94.&lt;/ref&gt;  According to one London society lady:

{{quote|[Gilbert]'s wit was innate, and his rapier-like retorts slipped out with instantaneous ease.  His mind was naturally fastidious and clean; he never asserted himself, never tried to make an effect.  He was great-hearted and most understanding, with an underlying poetry of fancy that made him the most delicious companion.  They spoke of his quick temper, but that was entirely free from malice or guile.  He was soft-hearted as a babe, but there was nothing of the hypocrite about him.  What he thought he said on the instant, and though by people of sensitive vanity this might on occasion be resented, to a sensitiveness of a finer kind it was an added link, binding one to a faithful, valued friend.&lt;ref&gt;''Anonymous'' 1871–1935, p. 238, London: John Murray (1936)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As the writings about Gilbert by husband and wife [[Seymour Hicks]] and [[Ellaline Terriss]] (frequent guests at his home) vividly illustrate, Gilbert's relationships with women were generally more successful than his relationships with men.&lt;ref&gt;Hicks, Seymour and Terriss, Ellaline [http://gasdisc.oakapplepress.com/mdpemberton-wsg.htm ''Views of W. S. Gilbert''], reproduced at Gilbert and Sullivan Discography, accessed 22 July 2016&lt;/ref&gt;  According to [[George Grossmith]], Gilbert "was to those who knew him a courteous and amiable gentleman – a gentleman without veneer."&lt;ref name=Prickly/&gt;  Grossmith and many others wrote of how Gilbert loved to amuse children:

{{quote|During my dangerous illness, Mr. Gilbert never failed a day to come up and enquire after me&amp;nbsp;... and kept me in roars of laughter the whole time&amp;nbsp;... But to see Gilbert at his best, is to see him at one of his juvenile parties. Though he has no children of his own, he loves them, and there is nothing he would not do to please them. I was never so astonished as when on one occasion he put off some of his own friends to come with Mrs. Gilbert to a juvenile party at my own house.&lt;ref&gt;Grossmith, p. 190&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Gilbert's niece Mary Carter confirmed, "...&amp;nbsp;he loved children very much and lost no opportunity of making them happy&amp;nbsp;... [He was] the kindest and most human of uncles."&lt;ref&gt;Carter, Mary. Letter to the editor of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', 6 January 1956&lt;/ref&gt;  Grossmith quoted Gilbert as saying, "[[Deer-stalking]] would be a very fine sport if only the deer had guns."&lt;ref name=GG1911/&gt;

==Legacy==
{{details|Cultural influence of Gilbert and Sullivan}}
In 1957, a review in ''The Times'' explained "the continued vitality of the Savoy operas" as follows:
{{quote|[T]hey were never really contemporary in their idiom&amp;nbsp;... Gilbert and Sullivan's [world], from the first moment was obviously not the audience's world, [it was] an artificial world, with a neatly controlled and shapely precision which has not gone out of fashion – because it was never in fashion in the sense of using the fleeting conventions and ways of thought of contemporary human society&amp;nbsp;... The neat articulation of incredibilities in Gilbert's plots is perfectly matched by his language&amp;nbsp;... His dialogue, with its primly mocking formality, satisfies both the ear and the intelligence.  His verses show an unequalled and very delicate gift for creating a comic effect by the contrast between poetic form and prosaic thought and wording&amp;nbsp;... How deliciously [his lines] prick the bubble of sentiment.  Gilbert had many imitators, but no equals, at this sort of thing&amp;nbsp;... [Of] equal importance&amp;nbsp;... Gilbert's lyrics almost invariably take on extra point and sparkle when set to Sullivan's music&amp;nbsp;... The two men together remain endlessly and incomparably delightful&amp;nbsp;... Light, and even trifling, though [the operas] may seem upon grave consideration, they yet have the shapeliness and elegance that can make a trifle into a work of art.&lt;ref&gt;"The Lasting Charm of Gilbert and Sullivan: Operas of an Artificial World", ''The Times'', 14 February 1957, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Gilbert-library.jpg|thumb|left|Gilbert in his library]]
Gilbert's legacy, aside from building the [[Garrick Theatre]] and writing the Savoy Operas and other works that are still being performed or in print nearly 150 years after their creation, is felt perhaps most strongly today through his influence on the American and British musical theatre. The innovations in content and form of the works that he and Sullivan developed, and in Gilbert's theories of acting and stage direction, directly influenced the development of the modern musical throughout the 20th century.&lt;ref name=PeterDowns&gt;Downs, Peter.

Ian Bradley, in connection with the 100th anniversary of Gilbert's death in 2011 wrote:
{{quote|There has been much discussion about Gilbert's proper place in British literary and dramatic history.

Its leading exponents lampoon and send up the major institutions and public figures of the day, wielding the weapon of grave and temperate irony with devastating effect, while themselves remaining firmly within the Establishment and displaying a deep underlying affection for the objects of their often merciless attacks. It is a combination that remains a continuing enigma.&lt;ref name=Bradley100/&gt;}}

'''William Rice Mulliner''' (11 June 1834 – 25 July 1863) was a [[British Empire|British]] officer who was the acting governor of the [[Lagos Colony]] in 1863.

On 1 September 1854 Mulliner obtained a commission by purchase as Ensign with the 3rd West India regiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

He visited [[Abeokuta]] in May 1863, travelling by gunboat to the mouth of the Aghoe creek, and then by canoe, accompanied by Commodore Wilmot of the British navy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He met the Bashorun of [[Abeokuta]], who told him that the recent robberies of traders' property were due to the war with [[Ibadan]]. It was the custom to suppress trading so as to force the men to war, and the plunder would cease when the war was over. In the meantime, traders should not travel to Abeokuta since their safety could not be guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

He was replaced as Acting Governor by [[John Hawley Glover]].&lt;ref name=Geary1965/&gt;

William was the fourth and youngest son of Northampton Coach Maker and Coach Master, [[Mulliner Northampton coach maker and harness maker|Francis Mulliner]] (1789–1841) and his wife née Jane Manton (1796–1875).&lt;ref name=PR/&gt; His three elder brothers spread their father's coach building businesses across the Midlands to Liverpool and down to London.

'''Zeno the [[Isauria]]n''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|z|iː|n|oʊ}}; {{lang-la|Flavius Zeno Augustus}}; {{lang-grc-gre|Ζήνων}}; c. 425 – 9 April 491), originally named '''Tarasis Kodisa Rousombladadiotes'''&lt;ref name="Tarasis"&gt;The sources call him "Tarasicodissa Rousombladadiotes", and for this reason it was thought his name was Tarasicodissa. However, it has been demonstrated that this name actually means "Tarasis, son of Kodisa, [coming from] Rusumblada", and that "Tarasis" was a common name in Isauria (R.M. Harrison, "The Emperor Zeno's Real Name", ''[[Byzantinische Zeitschrift]]'' 74 (1981) 27–28).&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|æ|r|ə|s|ᵻ|s}}, was [[Eastern Roman Emperor]] from 474 to 475 and again from 476 to 491. Domestic revolts and religious dissension plagued his reign, which nevertheless succeeded to some extent in foreign issues. His reign saw the end of the [[Western Roman Empire]] following the deposition of [[Romulus Augustus]] and the death of [[Julius Nepos]], but he contributed much to stabilising the Eastern Empire.

In ecclesiastical history, Zeno is associated with the ''[[Henotikon]]'' or "instrument of union", promulgated by him and signed by all the Eastern bishops, with the design of solving the [[Monophysitism|monophysite]] controversy.

==== Early life ====
[[File:Piatto di ardaburio, argento fuso, 434 d.c. (found in 1769) 03.JPG|thumb|A detail of the ''Missorium of Aspar'', depicting the powerful ''magister militum'' [[Aspar]] and his elder son [[Ardabur]] (434 circa). Zeno caused Ardabur's fall, producing treacherous letters that linked him to the Sassanid King; Ardabur later bribed some of Zeno's soldiers into trying to kill him.]]

Zeno's original name was Tarasis, and more accurately ''Tarasikodissa'' in his native [[Isaurian language]] ({{lang-la|Trascalissaeus}}).&lt;ref name="Tarasis" /&gt; Tarasis was born in [[Isauria]], at Rusumblada, later renamed [[Zenopolis, Isauria|Zenonopolis]] in Zeno's honour.&lt;ref name="Mitchell_114"&gt;Stephen Mitchell, ''A history of the later Roman Empire, AD 284–641: the transformation of the ancient world'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4051-0856-8}}, p. 114.&lt;/ref&gt; His father was called Kodisa (as attested by his patronymic "Tarasicodissa"), his mother Lallis, his brother [[Longinus (consul 486)|Longinus]]. Tarasis had a wife, Arcadia, whose name indicates a relationship with the Constantinopolitan aristocracy, and whose statue was erected near the [[Baths of Arcadius]], along the steps that led to [[Topo (climbing)|Topoi]].&lt;ref name="Croke_160"&gt;Croke, pp. 160–161.&lt;/ref&gt;  Near Eastern and other Christian traditions maintain that Zeno had two daughters, [[Hilaria (monk)|Hilaria]] and Theopiste, who followed a religious life,&lt;ref&gt;Terry G. Wilfong, ''Women of Jeme: lives in a Coptic town in late antique Egypt'', University of Michigan Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-472-06612-9}}, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt; but historical sources attest the existence of only one son by Arcadia, called Zenon.&lt;ref name="zenon4" /&gt; According to ancient sources, [[Zeno (consul 448)|Zeno]]'s prestigious career--he had fought against [[Attila]] in 447 to defend [[Constantinople]] and been consul the following year--was the reason why another Isaurian officer, Tarasis, chose the Greek name Zeno when he married into the Imperial family, thus being known as Zeno when he rose to the throne.&lt;ref name=jordanes&gt;Jordanes, 333; Evagrius, ii.15.&lt;/ref&gt; Some modern historians suggest that the Isaurian general Zeno was the father of the emperor,&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mitchell, ''A history of the later Roman Empire, AD 284–641: the transformation of the ancient world'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4051-0857-6}}, pp. 114–115.&lt;/ref&gt; but there is no consensus about this, and other sources suggest that Tarasis was a member of Zeno's entourage.

The Isaurians were a people who lived inland from the Mediterranean coast of [[Anatolia]], in the core of the [[Mount Taurus|Taurus Mountains]] (generally what is now the [[Konya]]/[[Bozkir]] area of [[Turkey]]). Like most borderland tribes, they were looked upon as [[barbarians]] by the Romans even though they had been Roman subjects for more than five centuries. However, being Orthodox Christians rather than [[Arianism|Arians]], as the Goths and other Germanic tribes were, they were not formally barred from the throne.&lt;ref name="Mitchell_114" /&gt;

According to some scholars, in the mid-460s, the Eastern Roman Emperor, [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]], wanted to balance the weight of the Germanic component of the army, whose leader was the [[Alans|Alan]] ''[[magister militum]]'' [[Aspar]]. He thought that Tarasis and his Isaurians could be that counterweight, and called him, with many Isaurians, to [[Constantinople]]. This interpretation, however, has been contested.&lt;ref name="Croke_166"&gt;Croke, pp. 166–168.&lt;/ref&gt; By the mid-460s, Arcadia and Zeno had been living at Constantinople for some time,&lt;ref name="Croke_160" /&gt; where Lallis and Longinus also lived, the latter married to a Valeria, possibly a woman of aristocrat rank.&lt;ref name="Croke_166" /&gt;

According to ancient sources, the earliest reference to Tarasis dates back to 464, when he put his hands on some letters written by Aspar's son, [[Ardabur]], which proved that the son of the ''magister militum'' had incited the Sassanid King to invade Roman territory, promising to support the invasion. Through these letters, which Tarasis gave to Leo, the Emperor could dismiss Ardabur, who at the time was ''magister militum per Orientem'' and ''[[patrikios|patricius]]'', thus reducing Aspar's influence and ambition. As reward for his loyalty, which Leo praised to [[Daniel the Stylite]],&lt;ref&gt;''Life of Daniel the Stylite'', 55, cited in Croke, p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt; Tarasis was appointed ''[[comes domesticorum]]'', an office of great influence and prestige.&lt;ref name="Croke_160" /&gt; This appointment could mean that Tarasis had been a ''protector domesticus'', either at Leo's court in Constantinople, or attached at Ardabur's staff in [[Antioch]].&lt;ref name="Croke_166" /&gt;

In 465, Leo and Aspar quarreled about the appointment of consuls for the following year; it was on this occasion that Tarasis' position was strengthened, as he became friend and ally of the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;The source is [[Photius]]'s epitome of the first book of [[Hugh Candidus|Candidus]]' chronicle (Croke, p. 161).&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Son-in-law of Leo I ====

[[File:KHM Wien Kaiserin Ariadne X 39.jpg|thumb|Relief of [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]], elder daughter of Emperor [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] and wife of Zeno.]]

To make himself more acceptable to the Roman hierarchy and the population of Constantinople, Tarasis adopted the Greek name of Zeno and used it for the rest of his life. In mid-late 466, Zeno married [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]], elder daughter of [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] and [[Verina]]; as there is no reference to him divorcing Arcadia, she likely died prior to this. The next year their son was born, and Zeno became father of the [[heir apparent]] to the throne, as the only son of Leo I had died in his infancy; to stress his claim to the throne, the boy was called [[Leo II (emperor)|Leo]].&lt;ref name="Croke_172"&gt;Croke, pp. 172–173.&lt;/ref&gt; Zeno, however, was not present at the birth of his son, as in 467, he participated in a military campaign against the Goths.&lt;ref name="Croke_166" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Croke_178"&gt;Croke, pp. 178–179.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Leo I Louvre Ma1012 n2.jpg|thumb|[[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]], father-in-law of Zeno, Eastern Roman Emperor from 457 to 474.]]

Zeno, as member of the ''protectores domestici'', did not take part in the disastrous expedition against the [[Vandals]], led in 468 by Leo's brother-in-law [[Basiliscus]]. The following year, during which he held the honour of the consulate, he was appointed ''[[magister militum]] per Thracias'' and led an expedition in [[Thrace]]. The sources do not clearly state what enemy he fought there, and historians had proposed either Goths or Huns, or the rebels of [[Anagastes]]. Either way, before leaving, Leo and Zeno asked for [[Daniel the Stylite]]'s opinion about the campaign, and Daniel answered that Zeno would be the target of a conspiracy but would escape unharmed. Indeed, Leo sent some of his personal soldiers with Zeno to protect him, but they were bribed by [[Aspar]] to capture him instead. Zeno was informed of their intention and fled to [[Serdica]], and, because of this episode, Leo grew even more suspicious of Aspar.&lt;ref name="Croke_185"&gt;Croke, pp. 185–186.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the attack, Zeno did not return to [[Constantinople]], where Aspar and [[Ardabur]] were, still with considerable power. Instead, he moved to the "Long Wall" (the [[Long Wall (Thracian Chersonese)|Long Wall]] of the [[Thracian Chersonese]] or, less probably, the [[Anastasian Wall]]), then to [[Pylai]] and from there to [[Chalcedon]]. While waiting here for an opportunity to return to the capital, he was appointed ''[[magister militum]] per Orientem''. He took the monk [[Peter the Fuller]] with him and left for [[Antioch]], his office's see, passing through [[Isauria]], where he put down the rebellion of Indacus. Zeno stayed at Antioch for two years.&lt;ref name="Croke_188"&gt;Croke, pp. 188–190.&lt;/ref&gt;

While living in Antioch with his family, Zeno sympathised with the [[Monophysite]] views of Peter the Fuller, and supported him against his opponent, the [[Chalcedonian]] bishop [[Martyrius of Antioch|Martyrius]]. Zeno allowed the arrival in Antioch of monks from nearby monasteries who increased the number of Peter's followers, and did not effectively repress their violence. Martyrius went to Constantinople to ask Leo for help, but, on returning to Antioch, he was informed that Peter had been elected bishop, and resigned (470). Leo reacted by ordering Peter into exile and addressing to Zeno a law that forbade the monks from leaving their monasteries or fomenting rebellion (1 June 471).&lt;ref&gt;The law is contained in the ''[[Justinian Code]]'' (1.3.29).&lt;/ref&gt; In 470/471, Zeno had also to deal with an invasion of [[Tzanni]], who attacked Roman [[Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Croke, p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Zeno far from Constantinople, Aspar had increased his influence by having his son [[Patricius (Caesar)|Patricius]] appointed ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]'' and married to Leo I's younger daughter, [[Leontia (daughter of Leo I)|Leontia]] (470). Sources are contradictory on the causes, but clearly state that in 471, Leo I had Aspar and Ardabur treacherously killed.  This certainly occurred with Zeno's and Basiliscus' approval, as, on the eve of the murders, the two generals had moved closer to Constantinople (Zeno was at Chalcedon). Thereafter, Zeno returned to Constantinople and was appointed ''magister militum praesentalis''.&lt;ref&gt;Croke, p. 198.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reign ===

==== First reign and Basiliscus' revolt (475–476) ====

[[File:Leo (474)-coin.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Leo II (emperor)|Leo II]], minted in the name of "Leo and Zeno perpetual ''Augusti''"; it belongs to the period when both Zeno and his son were joint emperors, between 9 February and 17 November 474.]]

On 25 October 473, Leo I appointed as ''Caesar'' his grandson Leo II, the son of Zeno and [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]]. On 18 January 474, Leo I died; if Leo II had not already been proclaimed co-emperor by his grandfather, he would have become ''Augustus'' on that occasion. Since Leo II was seven years old (too young to rule himself) Ariadne and her mother [[Verina]] prevailed upon him to crown Zeno, his father, as co-emperor, which he did on 9 February 474. When Leo II became ill and died, Zeno became sole emperor.

Zeno had to settle matters with the [[Vandals|Vandal]] King, [[Genseric]], who was conducting raids against the Empire's coastal cities, threatening key commercial sea routes. Zeno sent Genseric a high-ranking officer as ambassador, Severus, who succeeded in stipulating an "eternal" peace between the Vandals and the Empire, which allowed the Romans to pay ransoms for the prisoners in Vandal hands and which ended the Vandal persecution of Orthodox Christians in their territory.&lt;ref name="Williams181"&gt;Williams and Friell, pp. 181–183.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite this success, Zeno continued to be unpopular with the people and Senate because of his [[barbarian]] origins; his right to the throne was limited to his marriage with Ariadne and his relationship to Verina, the dowager Empress. Therefore, he chose to draw support from the Isaurian component of the army, in particular, the Isaurian generals [[Illus]] and [[Trocundes]], both brothers. However, Verina decided to overthrow her son-in-law Zeno and replace him with her lover, the ex-''magister officiorum'' Patricius, with the help of her brother [[Basiliscus]]. The conspirators fomented riots in the capital against the Isaurian emperor; Basiliscus succeeded also in convincing Illus, Trocundes and the Ostrogothic general [[Theodoric Strabo]] to join the plot.&lt;ref name="Williams181" /&gt;

[[File:Solidus Basiliscus-RIC 1003.jpg|thumb|Coin of [[Basiliscus]], who revolted against Zeno in January 475 and held power until Zeno's return in August 476. Basiliscus was [[Verina]]'s brother; he took power after having Zeno flee from Constantinople, but alienated the people of Constantinople and was captured and put to death by Zeno.]]

In January 475, Zeno was forced to flee Constantinople to Isauria with his wife and mother,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last = Hussey  | first = Joan  | authorlink = Joan M. Hussey  | title = The Cambridge medieval history, Volume 4  | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]]  | year = 1966  | page = 473}}&lt;/ref&gt; some Isaurian fellows and the Imperial treasure. Illus and Trocundes were sent to chase him, and Zeno was compelled to shut himself up in a fortress, where Illus besieged him, capturing also Zeno's brother, [[Longinus (consul 486)|Longinus]] and keeping him as an hostage.&lt;ref name="Williams181" /&gt;

However, the conspirators quickly fell in conflict with each other. Basiliscus took the throne for himself, putting to death Verina's lover and candidate, Patricius. He also allowed the mob to kill all of the Isaurians left in Constantinople, an episode that damaged relations with the Isaurian generals Illus and Trocundes. Basiliscus appointed his nephew [[Armatus]] ''magister militum'', thus alienating Theodoric Strabo. Since Zeno had left no money, Basiliscus was forced to levy heavy taxes. Finally, he alienated the Church by supporting the [[Monophysites]]. The people of Constantinople also put the blame on him for a great fire that burned several parts of the city. With the secret support of the Senate, and bribes paid by Zeno, Illus agreed to switch sides and united his army with Zeno's, marching on Constantinople. Basiliscus tried to recover popular support and sent another army against Zeno, under his nephew Armatus' command. Zeno succeeded in bribing Armatus too, promising to confirm his rank of ''magister militum praesentalis'' for life and promoting his son (also called Basiliscus) to the rank of ''[[Caesar (title)|Caesar]]''; Armatus' army failed to intercept Zeno's troops during their march on Constantinople, and, without Theodoric Strabo and his army, Basiliscus fled with his family to the church of [[Hagia Sophia]].&lt;ref name="Williams181" /&gt;

In August 476, Zeno besieged Constantinople. The Senate opened the gates of the city to the Isaurian, allowing the deposed emperor to resume the throne. Basiliscus fled to sanctuary in a church, but he was betrayed by the [[Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople|Patriarch Acacius]] and surrendered himself and his family after extracting a solemn promise from Zeno not to shed their blood. Basiliscus and his family were sent to a fortress in [[Cappadocia]], where Zeno had them enclosed in a dry cistern, to die from exposure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Elton | first = Hugh | title = Flavius Basiliscus (AD 475–476) | work = [[De Imperatoribus Romanis]] | date = 10 June 1998 | url = http://www.roman-emperors.org/basilis.htm | accessdate = 23 August 2006 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060822181056/http://www.roman-emperors.org/basilis.htm | archive-date = 2006-08-22 | dead-url = no | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his restoration, Zeno fulfilled his promises, letting Armatus keep his title of ''magister militum praesentalis'' (possibly even raising him to the rank of ''[[patrikios|patricius]]'') and appointing his son [[Basiliscus (Caesar)|Basiliscus]] ''Caesar'' in [[Nicaea]].&lt;ref&gt;There exist some [[solidus (coin)|solidi]] and [[tremissis|tremisses]] in the name of "Zeno and Leo nob[ilissimus] caes[ar]". They have been attributed to Zeno as emperor and to Armatus' son as ''Caesar''; in this case Armatus' son would have changed his name from Basiliscus, the name of the usurper, to Leo, the dynastic name of Zeno's house (Philip Grierson, Melinda Mays, ''Catalogue of late Roman coins in the Dumbarton Oaks Collection and in the Whittemore Collection: from Arcadius and Honorius to the accession of Anastasius'', Dumbarton Oaks, 1992, {{ISBN|0-88402-193-9}}, pp. 181–182).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 477, however, Zeno changed his mind, probably at Illus' instigation, as the latter stood to gain from the fall of Armatus, and ordered Armatus' death. Zeno confiscated all of Armatus' properties, deposed his son Basiliscus, and had him ordained as a priest.&lt;ref name="evagrius"&gt;[[Evagrius Scholasticus]], ''Historia Ecclesiae'', 3.xxiv. Evagrius reports that Basiliscus, the son of Armatus, later became bishop of [[Cyzicus]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="armatios"&gt;''[[Suda]]'', s.v. "Ἁρμάτιος".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="martindale"&gt;{{cite book |last=Martindale |first=J.R. |title=The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire |year=1980 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-20159-9 |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0521201594&amp;id=QCIaBQTCg0IC&amp;pg=PA148&amp;lpg=PA148&amp;sig=mOQLDMcv_o3wEWAHsre0Hm2S6CQ&amp;hl=en pp. 148–149] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====The End of the Western Empire====

[[File:Solidus-Odoacer-ZenoRIC 3657cf.jpg|thumb|This [[solidus (coin)|solidus]] was minted by [[Odoacer]] in the name of Zeno. Odoacer ruled Italy under the formal patronage of the Eastern Emperor.]]

The western emperor [[Olybrius]] died in the autumn of 472. [[Gundobad]], the western ''magister militum'' then proclaimed [[Glycerius]], the ''[[comes domesticorum]]'' (commander of the Imperial guard) as western emperor in Ravenna. [[Leo I (emperor)|Leo I]] refused to endorse Glycerius and elevated his nephew [[Julius Nepos]] to co-emperor for the west in 473. Expecting resistance, Nepos was forced by bad winter weather to delay his voyage until the next year; it was therefore left to Zeno, as Leo's successor, to support Julius Nepos' installation in Ravenna. Nepos arrived in Italy, quickly deposed Glycerius who offered no resistance, and was proclaimed Emperor by the [[Roman Senate]] in June 474. Julius was on good terms with Zeno, and he even minted coins in the names of Zeno, Leo II and himself.&lt;ref name="Mathisen_Nepos"&gt;Ralph W. Mathisen, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/nepos.htm "Julius Nepos (19/24 June 474 – &lt;nowiki&gt;[28 August 475]&lt;/nowiki&gt; – 25 April/9 May/22 June 480)"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304030920/http://www.roman-emperors.org/nepos.htm |date=2010-03-04 }}, ''De Imperatoribus Romanis''&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 475, during [[Basiliscus]]' reign, while Zeno was in Isauria blocked by [[Illus]]' army, [[Orestes (father of Romulus Augustulus)|Orestes]], the western ''magister militum'', revolted, forcing Nepos to flee Italy for Dalmatia; Orestes proclaimed his own son [[Romulus Augustus]] emperor, but was unable to gain the allegiance of the remnants of the Western Empire outside of Italy.&lt;ref name="Mathisen_Nepos" /&gt; One year later, while Zeno was entering [[Constantinople]] to end Basiliscus' brief usurpation, Romulus and Orestes were overthrown by the Chieftain [[Odoacer]]. With the support of Odoacer, the Roman Senate sent an envoy to present the imperial insignia to the restored Zeno. They asked Zeno to dissolve the separation of the empire and rule as sole Emperor; also, to appoint Odoacer both ''[[patrikios|patricius]]'' and official imperial governor of Italy. At the same time, Zeno received another embassy, sent by Julius Nepos, who asked Zeno to give him the money and the army he needed to resume his control of Italy. Zeno answered that the Roman Senate should welcome back Julius Nepos, their rightful Emperor, and that Odoacer should properly receive the patriciate from Nepos, although he allowed that he would also grant it.&lt;ref&gt;Malchus, fragment 10, cited in Ralph W. Mathisen, [http://www.roman-emperors.org/auggiero.htm "Romulus Augustulus (475–476 A.D.)--Two Views"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100304031407/http://www.roman-emperors.org/auggiero.htm |date=2010-03-04 }}, ''De Imperatoribus Romanis''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Odoacer was officially recognised and left in possession of Italy, while Nepos kept his title and the other fragments of the empire's western holdings, but no army.

Perhaps in deference to Zeno, Odoacer recognised Nepos' ''de jure'' reign in Italy until his death, ruling and even minting coins in his name, but he never allowed his return. After Nepos' assassination in 480, Odoacer invaded Dalmatia to pursue and punish the assassins (and also to take Dalmatia for himself). Zeno legitimised Odoacer's authority in Dalmatia; Odoacer recognised Zeno as sole Emperor of the again unitary Empire, but increasingly started using the title ''[[King|Rex]]'' ("King") for himself.&lt;ref&gt;Williams and Friell, p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Revolt of Marcian (479) ====

[[Marcian (usurper)|Marcian]] was the son of the Western Roman Emperor [[Anthemius]] (467–472) and a grandson of Emperor [[Marcian]] (450–457). He had married [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]]'s sister [[Leontia (daughter of Leo I)|Leontia]], and was therefore Zeno's brother-in-law; he was twice consul, in 467 and 472.

In 479 Marcian tried to overthrow Zeno and claim the throne for himself. With the help of his brothers [[Procopius Anthemius]] and [[Romulus (son of Anthemius)|Romulus]], he gathered in [[Constantinople]] troops composed of both citizens and foreigners in the house of a Caesarius, south of the [[Forum of Theodosius]], and from there they marched at the same time on the imperial palace and on the house of [[Illus]], who was a supporter of Zeno. The emperor almost fell into the hands of the rebels, who, during the day, overwhelmed the imperial troops, who were also attacked by citizens from the roofs of their houses. During the night, however, Illus moved an Isaurian unit, quartered in nearby [[Chalcedonia]], into Constantinople and also corrupted Marcian's soldiers, who allowed Zeno to flee. The following morning, Marcian, understanding that his situation was desperate and that reinforcements from [[Theodoric Strabo]] would not arrive in time, took refuge in the [[church of the Holy Apostles]], but was arrested with his brothers.&lt;ref name="Bury_Marcian"&gt;John Bagnall Bury, "X.2 The Revolts of Marcian and Illus (A.D. 479‑488)", in ''History of the Later Roman Empire'', Dover Books [1923], 1958. pp. 395, 397–398.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeno sent Marcian and his brothers to [[Caesarea in Cappadocia]]. They tried to flee, but Marcian was captured and obliged to become a monk in [[Tarsus, Mersin|Tarsus]] (Cilicia),&lt;ref&gt;[[Evagrius Scholasticus]], ''Historia ecclesiastica'', 3.26..&lt;/ref&gt; or imprisoned in Isauria, in the fortress of [[Papurius]]. He tried to escape a second time, and this time he succeeded, but, after gathering new troops and attacking [[Ancyra]], he was defeated and captured by [[Trocundus]], Illus' brother.&lt;ref name="Bury_Marcian" /&gt;

==== Revolt of Illus (484–488) ====
{{refimprove section|date=February 2011}}
The commanding position and popular favour of Illus rendered him an object of suspicion, and Zeno in various ways sought to rid himself of him. Also [[Verina]], the dowager Empress, plotted against his life. Verina's attempt was unsuccessful, and Zeno, equally jealous of her and of Illus, banished her at the suggestion of the latter, confining her in the fort of [[Papurius]]. There is some doubt as to the timing of these events. [[Hugh Candidus|Candidus]] places the banishment of Verina before the revolt of Marcian, and [[Theodore Lector]] assigns as the cause of it her share in the revolt of Basiliscus. It is not unlikely, indeed, that this turbulent woman was twice banished, once before Marcian's revolt, for her connection with Basiliscus, and again after Marcian's revolt, for her plot against Illus.

From her prison she managed to persuade her daughter Ariadne, the wife of Zeno, to attempt to obtain her release, first from Zeno, and then from Illus, to whom the Emperor referred her. Illus refused her request. Ariadne, like her mother, attempted to assassinate Illus. [[Jordanes]] ascribes her hatred to another cause: he says that Illus had infused jealous suspicions into Zeno's mind which had led Zeno to attempt to end her life, and that her knowledge of these things stimulated her to revenge. The assassin whom she employed only wounded Illus; the assassin was taken prisoner and Zeno, who appears to have been privy to the affair, was unable to prevent his execution.

Illus — with his friend [[Pamprepius]], [[Leontius (usurper)|Leontius]] and his brother [[Trocundus]] — now retired from court. They first went to [[Nicaea]] and then, on pretence of change of air and of procuring a cure for his wound, into the East where he was made ''magister militum''. Having traversed Asia Minor, they raised the standard of revolt in 484, when Illus declared Leontius Emperor. Zeno sent an army to fight them, but Illus won, obtained possession of [[Papurius]], released Verina, and induced her to crown Leontius at Tarsus.

In 485 Zeno sent against the rebels a fresh army, said to consist of [[Macedonia (Roman province)|Macedonians]] and [[Scythians]] (Tillemont conjectures, not unreasonably, that these were [[Ostrogoths]]) under [[John the Hunchback]], or, more probably, [[John the Scythian]], and [[Theoderic the Great|Theoderic the Amal]], who was at this time consul. John defeated the rebels near Seleucia and drove them into the fort of Papurius where he blockaded them. After a few months Trocundus died; the fort was taken only after four years of siege, by the treachery of Trocundus's brother-in-law, who had been sent for the purpose from Constantinople by Zeno.  Illus and Leontius were beheaded (488) and their heads sent to the Emperor.&lt;ref&gt;William Smith, ''[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]'', volume 2, p. 570.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Affairs with the Goths (474–487) ====

[[File:Theodoric bronze weight inlaid with silver issued by prefect Catulinus Rome 493 526.jpg|thumb|left|Bronze weight with the name of [[Theoderic the Great]], King of the [[Ostrogoths]] and ruler of Italy. Theoderic served under Zeno, fighting against his opponent [[Theodoric Strabo]] (476–481), and then was the leader of the army that besieged the fort of [[Papurius]] and captured and killed [[Illus]]' brother, Trocundus (484).]]

The aggressions of the two [[Ostrogoth]]ic leaders, Theoderic the Amal ([[Theoderic the Great]]), the son of [[Theodemir]] and leader of the [[Moesia]]n Ostrogoths, and [[Theodoric Strabo]], the leader of the [[Thracia]]n Ostrogoths, had been a constant source of danger since 472. Although Zeno at times contrived to play them off against each other, they in turn were able to profit by his dynastic rivalries. It was only by offering them pay and high command that he kept them from attacking Constantinople itself.

At the death of [[Leo II (emperor)|Leo II]], Theodoric Strabo rebelled against Zeno. His support was instrumental in overthrowing Zeno and raising [[Basiliscus]] to the Byzantine throne (475), but Theodoric and Basiliscus had a falling-out, so when Zeno returned to [[Constantinople]] in 476 and defeated Basiliscus, Strabo was reported to have not defended the city.&lt;ref name="martindale 2"&gt;{{cite book |last=Martindale |first=J.R. |title=The Prosopography of the Later Roman Empire |year=1980 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-20159-9 |pages= 1073–74 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zeno had become allied in this occasion with Theoderic the Amal, whose Goths had moved to attack the Empire. It has been suggested that Constantinople was defenceless during Zeno's siege because the ''magister militum'' Strabo had moved to the north to counter this menace. See {{cite book |last=Heather |first=Peter |title=Goths |date=May 1998 |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |isbn=978-0-631-20932-4 |pages=158–159 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 476/477, Zeno allied himself with Strabo's rival, Theoderic the Amal, and ordered him to attack Strabo. The leader of the Thracian Goths sent an embassy to the Emperor, offering peace and blaming the Moesian Theodoric. Zeno understood that this offering was hiding further conspiracies, and convinced the Senate and army to declare Strabo a public enemy.&lt;ref name="martindale"/&gt;

Zeno's plan was to have the two Theoderics attack each other. He sent the Amal against Strabo, who supported the revolt of [[Marcian (usurper)|Marcian]], with the promise of a huge [[Eastern Roman Empire|Roman]] force as reinforcement (478). When Theoderic the Amal arrived through the mountains at [[Mount Soundis]], he did not find the Roman reinforcement army he expected, but instead Theodoric Strabo's army, in a strongly fortified camp. The two Theoderics agreed to put forward a joint request to the Emperor, in order to extend to the south the settlement territory of the Ostrogoths in Moesia.&lt;ref name="wolfram"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wolfram |first=Herwig |title=History of the Goths |year=1979|edition= 1990 reprint|publisher=University of California Press |isbn=978-0-520-06983-1 |pages= 32, 270–276 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeno tried to divide the two Theoderics by bribing the Amal, but he refused the bribe. The Imperial army obtained some initial successes, but Zeno did not press his advantage, and allowed the Amal to move westward in Thrace, plundering territories as he went. With the Amal far away, Strabo accepted an agreement with Zeno: Strabo was to be given back his wealth, money to pay 13,000 soldiers, the command of two ''[[palatina]]e'' units, and the title once more of ''magister militum''.&lt;ref name="wolfram"/&gt; However, the army of Theodoric Strabo, 30,000-men strong was still a menace for Zeno, who convinced the [[Bulgars]] to attack the Thracian Goths in their own base. Strabo defeated the Bulgars in 480/481, and moved towards Constantinople, but he had to deal with problems with his own men, so he could not capitalise upon his victory and was forced to return to Greece. On his way back, he died in an accident.&lt;ref name="wolfram"/&gt;

After Theodoric Strabo died in 481, the future Theoderic the Great became king of the entire Ostrogoth nation and continued to be a source of trouble in the [[Balkan peninsula]]. Zeno allied to Theoderic, whom he appointed ''[[magister militum]] praesentalis'' and even consul for the year 484, the first time a barbarian who was not a citizen of the Empire reached such a high distinction. Zeno had Theoderic fight against [[Illus]] and the usurper [[Leontius (usurper)|Leontius]], besieging them at [[Papurius]] in 484–488. However, in 486 Theoderic revolted again and attacked Constantinople, severing the city's water supply. Zeno bought a peace and agreed with Theoderic that the Ostrogoths should have gone to invade Italy to fight [[Odoacer]], who had allegedly supported Leontius, and to establish his new kingdom there (487). This all but eliminated the Germanic presence in the east.&lt;ref&gt;Stephen Mitchell, ''A history of the later Roman Empire, AD 284–641: the transformation of the ancient world'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2007, {{ISBN|1-4051-0856-8}}, pp. 118–119&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Promulgation of the ''Henotikon'' (482) ====

In religious matters, Zeno is famous for his ''[[Henotikon]]'', or "Act of Union", issued in 482 to mediate between [[Chalcedonian]] and [[Miaphysitism|Miaphysite]] views about the [[Christology|nature of Christ]]. The Chalcedonians recognised two natures (''[[physis]]'') in Christ, the Miaphysites only one; the [[Council of Chalcedon]] (451) had issued the [[Chalcedonian Creed]] and condemned the Miaphysite position, but the Miaphysites were still strong, especially in the Eastern provinces of the Empire, and the [[Patriarch of Alexandria]], [[Peter Mongus]], was a Miaphysite. Supporting the Miaphysites was one of the mistakes made by [[Basiliscus]], as the people of [[Constantinople]] were Chalcedonian, but Zeno needed the support of the Miaphysite provinces--Egypt, Syria, Palestine and Asia Minor; also, the [[Ecumenical Patriarch of Constantinople|Patriarch of Constantinople]], [[Patriarch Acacius of Constantinople|Acacius]], was interested in reducing the distance between the two positions.

Therefore, in 482 Zeno issued the ''Henotikon'', a document he had developed with the support of Acacius and addressed to the factions in Egypt. The edict affirmed the [[Nicene-Constantinopolitan Creed]] (i.e., the Creed of Nicaea completed at Constantinople) as affording a common, final and united symbol or expression of faith. All other symbola or mathemata were excluded; [[Eutyches]] and [[Nestorius]] were unmistakably condemned in an [[anathema]], while the twelve chapters of [[Cyril of Alexandria]]  were accepted. The teaching of Chalcedon was not so much repudiated as passed over in silence; Jesus Christ was described as the "only-begotten Son of God [...] one and not two" and there was no explicit reference to the two natures.&lt;ref&gt;Evagrius Scholasticus, ''Historia Ecclesiastica'' III. 14.&lt;/ref&gt;

The bishop of Rome, [[Pope Felix III]], refused to accept the document and excommunicated Acacius (484), thus beginning the [[Acacian schism]], which lasted until 519.&lt;ref name="vasiliev"&gt;Alexander A. Vasiliev, ''History of the Byzantine Empire, 324–1453'', Volume 1, University of Wisconsin Press, 1958, {{ISBN|0-299-80925-0}}, pp. 107–109.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 488 the patriarch of Antioch, [[Peter the Fuller]], came to Constantinople to have his right to the [[Church of Cyprus]] confirmed. Zeno called the bishop of Cyprus, Anthemius, to answer the accusations. The bishop claimed that before his departure, he had had a vision of St. [[Barnabas]], in which the position of the tomb of the apostle had been revealed to him. In the tomb, Anthemius had found the relics of the apostle and a copy of the ''[[Gospel of Matthew]]'' written in Hebrew by Barnabas himself. Zeno received the relics and the manuscript, and in exchange he proclaimed the autonomy of the Church of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Runciman, Elizabeth Jeffreys, ''Byzantine style, religion and civilization: in honour of Sir Steven Runciman'', Cambridge University Press, 2006, {{ISBN|0-521-83445-7}}, p. 400.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 489 Zeno closed the Persian school of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia]], by request of bishop [[Cyrus II of Edessa]], because it promoted [[Nestorianism|Nestorian]] teachings, and built a church in its place. The school relocated to its original home of [[Nisibis]], becoming again the [[School of Nisibis]], and leading to a wave of Nestorian immigration into [[Persia]].&lt;ref&gt;J.B. Segal, ''Edessa, the Blessed City'', Gorgias Press LLC, 2005, {{ISBN|1-59333-059-6}}, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Suppressing the Samaritan revolt (484) ====

[[File:Gerizim.jpg|thumb|[[Mount Gerizim]], where [[Samaritan]] sources have Zeno buried.]]

According to [[Samaritan]] sources, Zeno (whom the sources call "Zait the King of Edom") persecuted the Samaritans. The Emperor went to [[Sichem]] (''Neapolis''), gathered the elders and asked them to convert; when they refused, Zeno had many Samaritans killed, and converted the synagogue to a church. Zeno then took for himself [[Mount Gerizim]], where the Samaritans worshipped God, and built several edifices, among which a tomb for his recently deceased son, on which he put a cross, so that the Samaritans, worshipping God, would prostrate in front of the tomb. According to these same sources, Zeno was buried on Mount Gerizim.

Later, in 484, the Samaritans revolted. The rebels attacked Sichem, burnt five churches built on Samaritan holy places and cut off the fingers of bishop Terebinthus, who was officiating the ceremony of [[Whitsun]]. They elected a [[Justa (rebel)|Justa]] (or Justasa/Justasus) as their king and moved to [[Caesarea]], where a significant Samaritan community lived. Here several Christians were killed and the church of St. Sebastian was destroyed. Justa celebrated the victory with games in the circus. According to [[John Malalas]], the ''[[dux]] [[Palaestina Prima|Palestinae]]'' Asclepiades, whose troops were reinforced by the Caesarea-based [[Arcadiani]] of Rheges, defeated Justa, killed him  and sent his head to Zeno.&lt;ref&gt;Malalas, 15.&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Procopius of Caesarea]], Terebinthus went to Zeno to ask for revenge; the Emperor personally went to Samaria to quell the rebellion.&lt;ref&gt;Procopius, 5.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern historians believe that the order of the facts preserved by Samaritan sources should be inverted, as the persecution of Zeno was a consequence of the rebellion rather than its cause, and should have happened after 484, around 489. Zeno rebuilt the church of [[Procopius of Scythopolis|St. Procopius]] in Neapolis (Sichem) and the Samaritans were banned from Mount Gerizim, on whose top a signalling tower was built to alert in case of civil unrest.&lt;ref&gt;Alan David Crown, ''The Samaritans'', Mohr Siebeck, 1989, {{ISBN|3-16-145237-2}}, pp. 72–73.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death and succession ===
Zeno died on 9 April 491,&lt;ref&gt;Theophanes the Confessor, 135,31–136,5. Cited in Michael Whitby, ''The ecclesiastical history of Evagrius Scholasticus'', Liverpool University Press, 2000, {{ISBN|0-85323-605-4}}, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt; of [[dysentery]]&lt;ref&gt;Malalas, 391.1–4. Cited in Whitby, ''ibidem''.&lt;/ref&gt; or of [[epilepsy]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Evagrius Scholasticus]], 3.29.&lt;/ref&gt; after ruling for 17 years and 2 months. No sons were to succeed him: Leo had died in 474, Zenon, the first son, in his youth, while living at court.&lt;ref name="zenon4"&gt;Martindale, "Zenon 4", p. 1198.&lt;/ref&gt; Ariadne then chose a favoured member of the Imperial court, [[Anastasius I (emperor)|Anastasius]], to succeed Zeno, whose brother [[Longinus (consul 486)|Longinus]] revolted, starting the [[Isaurian War]].

According to a popular legend recorded by two ancient historians, Zeno was [[buried alive]] after becoming insensible due to drinking or an illness; he called for help, but [[Ariadne (empress)|Ariadne]] did not allow anyone to open the sarcophagus.&lt;ref&gt;[[Cedrenus]], I; Joannes Zonaras, 14.2.31–35. Cited in Whitby, ''ibidem''. [[Michael Psellus]], 68.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Tabula - boardgame - Zeno game.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|A game of [[tabula (game)|τάβλη (tabula)]] played by Zeno in 480 and recorded by [[Agathias]] in ''circa''  530 because of a very unlucky dice result for Zeno. The game is similar to [[backgammon]]; Zeno (red) threw 2, 5 and 6 and was forced to leave eight pieces alone and thus exposed to capture. See "Zeno's Game of τάβλη".&lt;ref name="austin-zeno"&gt;Austin, Roland G. "Zeno's Game of τάβλη", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 54:2, 1934. pp 202–205.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Zeno was a player of ''[[Tabula (game)|τάβλη (tabula)]]'', a game nearly identical to modern [[backgammon]].&lt;ref name="austin-zeno"&gt;Austin, Roland G. "Zeno's Game of τάβλη", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 54:2, 1934. pp 202–205.&lt;/ref&gt; (Τάβλη is still used to refer to backgammon in Greece.) In 480 he had a hand that was so unlucky that he wrote an epigram to record it; [[Agathias]] reproduced it half a century later and this allowed the game to be reconstructed in the 19th century. Zeno, who was white, had a stack of seven checkers, three stacks of two checkers and two ''blots'', checkers that stand alone on a point and are therefore in danger of being put outside the board by an incoming opponent checker. Zeno threw the three dice with which the game was played and obtained 2, 5 and 6. As in backgammon, Zeno could not move to a space occupied by two opponent (black) pieces. The white and black checkers were so distributed on the points that the only way to use all of the three results, as required by the game rules, was to break the three stacks of two checkers into blots, thus exposing them to capture and ruining the game for Zeno.&lt;ref name="austin-zeno"&gt;Austin, Roland G. "Zeno's Game of τάβλη", ''The Journal of Hellenic Studies'' 54:2, 1934. pp 202–205.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;Robert Charles Bell, ''Board and table games from many civilisations'', Courier Dover Publications, 1979, {{ISBN|0-486-23855-5}}, pp. 33–35.&lt;/ref&gt;

Zeno is the protagonist of a theatrical drama in Latin, called ''Zeno'', composed c. 1641 by the Jesuit playwright [[Joseph Simons]] and performed in 1643 in [[Rome]] at the Jesuit [[English College, Rome|English College]].&lt;ref&gt;James A. Parente, ''Religious drama and the humanist tradition: Christian theater in Germany and in the Netherlands, 1500–1680'', BRILL, 1987, {{ISBN|90-04-08094-5}}, pp. 177–178.&lt;/ref&gt; An anonymous Greek drama is modelled on this Latin ''Zeno'', belonging to the so-called [[Cretan Theatre]]. This version was written and performed at [[Zakynthos]] in 1682–83 and has Zeno buried alive and his brother [[Longinus (consul 486)|Longinus]] executed.&lt;ref&gt;Frederick W. Norris, "Henotikon", in ''Encyclopedia of early Christianity'', Everett Ferguson, Michael P. McHugh, Frederick W. Norris, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1998, {{ISBN|0-8153-3319-6}}. Bruce Merry, ''Encyclopedia of modern Greek literature'', Greenwood Publishing Group, 2004, {{ISBN|0-313-30813-6}}, p. 419.&lt;/ref&gt;

The play ''[[Romulus the Great]]'' (1950), by [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], has Zeno as one of its characters. The plot is loosely based on history; here Zeno flees to Italy and tries to convince [[Romulus Augustulus]] to unite their forces and fight together, but his plan fails. Dürrenmatt's Zeno is an Emperor oppressed by the Byzantine ceremonial.
