The '''1953 Chatham Cup''' was the 26th annual nationwide knockout [[association football|football]] competition in [[New Zealand]].

The competition was run on a regional basis, with regional associations each holding separate qualifying rounds.

Teams taking part in the final rounds are known to have included [[Eastern Suburbs AFC|Eastern Suburbs]] (Auckland), [[Huntly Thistle]], [[Eastern Union]] (Gisborne), [[New Plymouth City]], [[Napier Rovers]], [[Wanganui United]], [[St. Andrews FC|St. Andrews]] (Manawatu), [[Seatoun (soccer)|Seatoun]] (Wellington), [[Woodbourne (soccer)|Woodbourne]] (Marlborough), [[Riccarton (soccer)|Riccarton]], [[Northern (soccer)|Northern]] (Dunedin), and [[Invercargill Thistle]].

==The 1953 final==
The final was a repeat of the 1951 final, with Eastern Suburbs again beating Dunedin's Northern. Reg King added two further goals to his three from 1951, equalling the aggregate record of five final goals. The game was a thrilling one according to contemporary accounts, with Northern letting in a soft goal very early on and the game opening up with frequent chances at both ends. Suburbs clinched the match with the winning goal late on in the second half. Scorers were Reg King (2), [[Ken Fleet]], and Murray Anderson for Eastern Suburbs, while Trevor McFarlane gained a brace for Northern and Bill Boardman also scored for the Dunedin side.

The '''BBC Sports Unsung Hero Award'''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/stories/2007/08_august/28/unsung.shtml|title=Nominate your BBC Sports Unsung Hero|date=28 August 2007 |work=BBC Press Office|publisher=BBC|accessdate=6 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an award given annually as part of the [[BBC Sports Personality of the Year]] ceremony each December. The award is given to the sportsperson who has made a substantive yet unrecognised contribution to sport. Sportspeople are nominated by the public, and must be aged 16&amp;nbsp;years or over on 1 January that year. Nominees may not put themselves forward or be nominated by a member of their [[immediate family]]. A nominee must actively help others participate in a sport at any level on a voluntary basis. The work they do must not be part of their job or take part within their places of work, and they must not be a participant in the sporting group they are helping. Previous winners of the award are ineligible for nomination. One winner is selected from each of the twelve [[BBC English Regions]], and the three national regions: [[BBC Scotland]], [[BBC Wales]], and [[BBC Northern Ireland]]. A judging panel then chooses the Unsung Hero winner from the fifteen regional winners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/7735134.stm|title=Sports Personality voting &amp; judging: Terms &amp; conditions|date=18 November 2008|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=12 January 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090118025110/http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_of_the_year/7735134.stm| archivedate= 18 January 2009 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural winner in 2003 was 63-year-old Nobby Woodcock, for "his unstinting work with grassroots football in Wales".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/tv_and_radio/sports_personality_2003/3310001.stm|title=Nobby named unsung hero|date=14 December 2003|publisher=[[BBC Sport]]|accessdate=12 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the fourteen recipients to date, four were chosen for their contributions to [[Association football|football]]; the other recipients contributed towards [[boxing]], [[basketball]], [[athletics (sport)|athletics]], swimming, and the [[Special Olympics]]. Three of the fourteen winners have each been put forward from the [[BBC East Midlands]] and [[BBC South]] regions and two from the [[BBC East]] region.  The other winners came from the [[BBC London]], [[BBC North West]], [[BBC Northern Ireland]], [[BBC Scotland]], [[BBC West Midlands]] and [[BBC Wales]] regions. The most recent award was presented in 2017 to Denise Larrad.

The '''Bicentennial Test''' was a single [[Test cricket]] match played between [[Australian cricket team|Australia]] and [[English cricket team|England]] at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] in celebration of the [[Australian Bicentenary|bicentenary]] of permanent colonial settlement in Australia. The match took place from 29 January to 2 February 1988 and was drawn. It did not count as part of [[The Ashes]] series, in the same way as the [[Centenary Test]]s in 1977 and 1980 also were excluded from the Ashes lists.

The match was played in the middle of an [[English cricket team in New Zealand in 1987-88|England tour]] to [[New Zealand cricket team|New Zealand]], where the team later played three Test matches, all of them also drawn. Previously the same winter, the England team had toured [[Pakistani cricket team|Pakistan]], and Australia had hosted Tests and [[One Day International]]s against New Zealand and [[Sri Lankan cricket team|Sri Lanka]] (the single Test against Sri Lanka came after the Bicentennial Test, but all other matches were before it).

==The teams==

Sydney's reputation for favouring spin bowling led both sides to pick two specialist spin bowlers and to favour medium-pace or fast-medium bowling over out-and-out speed.

England were captained by [[Mike Gatting]], fresh from his finger-wagging confrontation with [[umpire (cricket)|umpire]] [[Shakoor Rana]], and lacked several of the big name players of recent years, such as [[Graham Gooch]], [[David Gower]], [[Allan Lamb]], and [[Ian Botham]].

The team was, in batting order: 
* [[Chris Broad]]
* [[Martyn Moxon]]
* [[Tim Robinson (cricketer)|Tim Robinson]]
* [[Mike Gatting]] (captain)
* [[Bill Athey]]
* [[David Capel]]
* [[John Emburey]]
* [[Bruce French (cricketer)|Bruce French]] (wicketkeeper)
* [[Neil Foster]]
* [[Eddie Hemmings (cricketer)|Eddie Hemmings]]
* [[Graham Dilley]].

Australia were captained by [[Allan Border]]. The team, in batting order, was:
* [[Geoff Marsh]]
* [[David Boon]]
* [[Dean Jones (cricketer)|Dean Jones]]
* [[Allan Border]] (captain)
* [[Mike Veletta]]
* [[Steve Waugh]]
* [[Peter Sleep]]
* [[Greg Dyer]] (wicketkeeper)
* [[Peter Taylor (Australian cricketer)|Peter Taylor]]
* [[Tony Dodemaide]]
* [[Craig McDermott]].

==The match==

England won the toss and batted. Broad shared stands of 93 with Moxon, who made 40, and 99 with Robinson, who made 43, on his way to a century on the first day. Wickets fell more steadily across the second day, including Broad for 139. Broad reacted angrily to his dismissal, and flattened the leg stump with his bat as he departed: he was fined the maximum permitted (£500) by the tour manager. England's final total of 425 contained no other scores of more than 50: the next highest after Broad was French with 47.

On the third day, Australia batted poorly and lost wickets regularly to shots more suited to one-day cricket. Jones made 56, but when bad light ended play two hours early, the side was 164 for seven wickets, 62 runs short of the follow-on. In tense cricket on the fourth morning, they failed to reach that figure by 12 runs, and Gatting enforced the follow-on. With the pitch getting slower and easier, Marsh and Boon put up a first-wicket partnership of 162 and after Marsh went for 56, Boon batted on and on across the final day, eventually reaching 184 not out, his then-highest Test score, as Australia got to 328 for two to save the match. They were helped by the loss of more play to bad light (when Gatting recalled fast bowler Dilley to the attack), injuries to both Dilley and Foster and lack of penetration among the other England bowlers. 

The match was watched by 103,831 people, well below the forecast figure.

A '''blue''' is an award earned by athletes at a university and some schools for competition at the highest level. The awarding of blues began at [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] and [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]] universities in England. It is awarded at [[United Kingdom|British]], and some [[Canada|Canadian]], [[Australia]]n and [[New Zealand]] universities.

==History==
The first sporting contest between the universities of Oxford and Cambridge was held on 4 June 1827, when a two-day [[cricket]] match at [[Lord's]], organized by Charles Wordsworth, nephew of the poet [[William Wordsworth|William]], resulted in a draw. There is no record of any university "colours" being worn during the game.&lt;ref name=cam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/documents/en/his/history.pdf |title=Blues and the Blues Committee: Some historical notes |publisher=Cambridge University Blues Committee |author=Christopher Thorne |date=10 July 1996 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110716024827/http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/documents/en/his/history.pdf |archivedate=16 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/0/440.html|title=Oxford University v Cambridge University, University Match 1827|publisher=cricketarchive.co.uk|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121020114333/http://www.cricketarchive.co.uk/Archive/Scorecards/0/440.html|archivedate=20 October 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the first [[The Boat Race|Boat Race]] in 1829, the Oxford crew was dominated by students of [[Christ Church, Oxford|Christ Church]], whose college colours were dark blue. They wore white shirts with dark blue stripes, while Cambridge wore white with a pink or scarlet sash. At the second race, in 1836, a light blue ribbon was attached to the front of the Cambridge boat, probably as it was the colour of [[Eton College|Eton]]. These colours — light blue for Cambridge, and dark blue for Oxford — became the official colours of the two boat clubs, and through the rivalry of the Boat Race, the colours became inextricably linked with the universities and contests between the two.&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;&lt;ref name=oxf&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vincents.org/history/theoxfordblue/ |title=The Oxford Blue |author=[[Norris McWhirter]] |publisher=Vincent's Club |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090530175302/http://www.vincents.org/history/theoxfordblue/ |archivedate=30 May 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athletes at the [[University of Cambridge]] may be awarded a '''full blue''' (or simply a '''blue'''), '''half blue''', '''first team colours''' or '''second team colours''' for competing at the highest level of university sport, which must include being in a varsity match or race against the [[University of Oxford]]. A full blue is the highest honour that may be bestowed on a Cambridge athlete, and is a much-coveted and prestigious prize. In general, the full blue standard is approximately that of being successful at a national level of student competition, and the half blue standard is that of being successful at county or regional level.

=== History ===
Once light blue had been chosen as the colour of Cambridge's Boat Club, the other university sport clubs followed suit, though out of courtesy would request permission from the Boat Club before awarding such a "blue". In the 1860s the three senior sports — rowing, cricket and athletics — were awarding blues, and the presidents of each formed an informal "Blues Committee" to oversee such awards. By 1880 a number of smaller clubs involved in [[varsity match]]es had successfully requested the right to award "half blues".&lt;ref name=cam/&gt;

=== Awarding process ===
The criteria for awarding blues are different for men and women. Awards are made at the discretion of the men's and women's Blues Committees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/committees/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-01-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060110021421/http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/committees/index.html |archivedate=10 January 2006 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Men's Blues Committee is formed from one representative of each of the full blue sports, and the Women's from one representative of each of the full blue and half blue sports. Each committee meets to discuss issues relating to Cambridge sport.

In some sports with full blue status, the varsity match second team is awarded '''second team colours'''.

The awarding of a full blue often requires a person to fulfill a number of requirements in the same academic year, particularly in sports with discretionary full blue status. If, for whatever reason, an exceptional athlete is of or above full blue standard but does not fulfill all the requirements for the 'automatic' award of a full blue in any given year, the committee has the authority to grant an '''extraordinary full blue''' to that person subject to scrutiny of the particular case. The individual's case must be presented to the Blues Committee in person and must be backed up by substantial evidence and references. The award is unlikely to be made unless the person is of world-class or at least international standard.

Each sport has specific criteria for each award; the general categorisation of men's and women's sports is laid out below, though the status of each sport is subject to frequent review.

=== Regalia ===
[[Image:Cambridge-half-blue-blazer.jpg|right|thumb|200px|[[University of Cambridge|Cambridge University]] Half Blue blazer and bow tie.]]

The winner of a blue or half blue is entitled to wear a blues blazer, which is one of the most recognisable and distinctive garments associated with Cambridge University. Full blue blazers are completely coloured [[Cambridge Blue (colour)|Cambridge Blue]]. Half blue blazers have a number of different designs, depending on the wearer's sport; a typical design is an off-white blazer with Cambridge blue lapels and trimmings. There is a variety of other blue and half blue paraphernalia, including scarves, ties, pullovers, bow ties, caps and squares.  Such items are worn with pride.

{{As of|2011|5}}, the colour recognised officially by the University as Cambridge Blue actually has a slight green tint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cam.ac.uk/system/files/identity_guidelines.pdf |title=Identity guidelines - fifth edition |date=25 March 2012 |publisher=University of Cambridge |accessdate=3 May 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161220071050/https://www.cam.ac.uk/system/files/identity_guidelines.pdf |archivedate=20 December 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008 in Cambridge an alumna launched Oxbridge Blues Jewellery &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxbridgebluesjewellery.com/cambridge/|title=Cambridge Blue &amp; Half Blue - Oxbridge Blues Jewellery|website=www.oxbridgebluesjewellery.com|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924062824/http://www.oxbridgebluesjewellery.com/cambridge/|archivedate=24 September 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; specifically for women's blues and half blues at the two Universities. These are the only blues item to have been licensed by the University of Cambridge.

=== Hawks' Club/Ospreys ===
Men holding blues, half blues or second team colours in a Full blue sport are eligible to join the [[Hawks' Club]]. Women holding any of these awards are eligible to join The Ospreys, which was founded in 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/ospreys/about.html |title=About the Ospreys |publisher=Cambridge University Women's Sports Club |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090828063601/http://www.sport.cam.ac.uk/ospreys/about.html |archivedate=28 August 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== University of Oxford ==
{{Redirect|Oxford Blue|the colour|Oxford Blue (colour)|the cheese variety|Oxford Blue (cheese)}}

===Administration===
At the [[University of Oxford]], the committees for awarding blues and half blues work on much the same principles as the Cambridge committees. The principal difference between the two men's committees is that, at Oxford, all Captains, regardless of their status as full, discretionary, or half blue must attend meetings of the Committee. Until recently, the voting was broken up according to blues status with full blue captains being allowed to vote on all matters while all the other captains could only vote on matters directly relating to half blue sports. In Michaelmas Term 2006, the committee finally allowed discretionary full blue captains the right to vote on matters directly relating to discretionary full blue sports. This has ended many years of inequality for discretionary full blue status captains and was largely welcomed by the committee.

The committees are administered by an elected president, secretary and treasurer who serve one year. Unlike at Cambridge, where the president of Cambridge University Boat Club holds the position, at Oxford, any captain can be elected president, regardless of sport or status.

The role of the president is to call and serve as chair of any meeting of the committee, of which there are normally 3 per year (6 for the women).  They also serve as the representative of the committee and sit on the University Sports Strategy Committee and the Executive Committee of the Sports Federation.  Both Presidents along with the Director of Sport represent Oxford at any meetings of a Joint Blues Committee held with Cambridge.  The purpose of the Joint Blues Committee is to discuss issues of eligibility for the varsity match and to settle any disputes between the sporting communities of the two universities.

===Costume===
The colour of an Oxford full blue blazer is dark blue. The Oxford half blue blazer can be one of two designs. Either it is composed of thick vertical stripes of dark blue and off-white, as in the adjacent image, or it can be dark blue, as the full blue blazer, with two white stripes above the club badge on the left breast.

The range is the same as the Cambridge design except that the semi-precious stones are navy blue and white.

===Clubs===
The club associated with the Oxford blue is [[Vincent’s Club]], although its membership is not restricted to blues, and there are wider criteria for election. ''[[Atalantas]]'' is a club for sportswomen at Oxford, and also is not restricted to blues.

The [[Sport at the University of Adelaide|Adelaide University Sports Association]] at the [[University of Adelaide]] in [[Adelaide]], [[South Australia]] awards a blue and a half blue for outstanding sporting achievement, and a club letters for both sporting achievement and service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AWARDS |url=http://unione.theblacks.com.au/Common/ContentWM.aspx?CID=13 |publisher=The Adelaide University Sports Association |accessdate=10 February 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130409084809/http://unione.theblacks.com.au/Common/ContentWM.aspx?CID=13 |archivedate=9 April 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== La Trobe University ===
[[La Trobe University]] has awarded blues and half blues since its early years, with the first blues being awarded in 1968. The annual Blues and Sports Awards Night recognises the elite sports men and women who have represented La Trobe via the university's clubs, intervarsity sporting competitions and the World University games.  There are also awards for Outstanding Service which recognise the outstanding service to sports clubs by members of the La Trobe Community.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.latrobe.edu.au/unisport/clubs/honour-board|title=Life Members and Honour Board|last=University|first=La Trobe|website=www.latrobe.edu.au|access-date=2016-04-12|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160422001250/http://www.latrobe.edu.au/unisport/clubs/honour-board|archivedate=22 April 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Melbourne ===
The Melbourne University Sports Association (originally known as the 'Sports Union') awards blues and half blues at the [[University of Melbourne]], for outstanding performance in inter-university events (primarily through the [[Australian University Games]] and Australian University Championships). A 'distinguished service award' may be made (including to non-students) for outstanding service to a sporting club (or clubs), the Sports Association, and/or sport at the university generally.

Blues were first awarded in 1904, as one of the first items of business of the newly formed Sports Union, with retrospective awards made back as early as 1870. Initially, awards were made automatically to all participants in an intervarsity contest, with the level (full or half blue) dependant on the sport. In 1911, this model was replaced with the formation of a 'Blues Advisory Board' to determine the awards based on an individual's performance. The BAB continues to serve this role today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Senyard | first = June E. | year = 2004 | title = The Ties That Bind: A History of Sport at the University of Melbourne | publisher = Walla Walla Press | location = Petersham, NSW}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== University of Queensland ===
Blues and half-blues have been awarded at the University of Queensland since 1912. Blues have been awarded for outstanding performances in club fixtures, representative games, and inter-university competitions as well as for international representation whilst studying at the University. The University of Queensland blue is the highest sporting accolade an athlete can receive from the university. In recent years, UQ Sport through its Blues Advisory Committee, has developed a selection method and criteria to ensure that blues and half blues at the university are of the highest standard. Each year these awards are presented at the UQ Sport Blues Awards Dinner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uqsport.com.au/content/uq-blues-awards|title=UQ BLUES AWARDS|publisher=University of Queensland|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151022192217/http://www.uqsport.com.au/content/uq-blues-awards|archivedate=22 October 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 'Blues' in New Zealand ==
Since 1919 the New Zealand Universities Blue has been awarded to [[NZ University]] students who have achieved excellence both on and off the field of play. Currently [[University Sport New Zealand]] is responsible for presenting this award&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.universitysport.org.nz/nzu-blues|title=NZU Blues - Student Life &amp; Sport|publisher=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130528015531/http://www.universitysport.org.nz/nzu-blues|archivedate=28 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, individual universities will award their own blues. For example, [[University of Otago]] blues date from 1907,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ousa.org.nz/recreation/blues-and-golds-awards/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130522130102/http://www.ousa.org.nz/recreation/blues-and-golds-awards/ |archivedate=22 May 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore pre-dating the New Zealand Universities blue.

'''El Gran Luchadore''' is the name of a masked [[Lucha libre|Mexican professional wrestling]] character in [[World Wrestling Entertainment]], seen on its [[WWE Friday Night SmackDown|SmackDown!]] brand in 2004. El Gran Luchadore (loosely translated from [[Spanish language|Spanish]] to "The Great Fighter/Wrestler," "Luchadore" is also an incorrect spelling, ''luchador'' is the correct spelling) was mainly used as a [[Job (professional wrestling)#Jobbers|jobber]] [[Gimmick (professional wrestling)|gimmick]] to [[Glossary of professional wrestling terms#Put over|put over]] other wrestlers.

The first WWE wrestler to wrestle as the El Gran Luchadore was [[Paul London]] on April 22, 2004 in a [[Squash (professional wrestling)|squash]] match against [[John Bradshaw Layfield]] (JBL), [[Paul Heyman]] convinced Bradshaw to accept a match with the "Mexican Heavyweight Champion" after hearing that El Gran Luchadore punked out Bradshaw at an airport.

Next up was [[Shannon Moore]] on July 8, 2004, billed as the "champion of [[Mexico]]", would face [[WWE Championship|WWE Champion]] JBL in a ''champion vs. champion match'' (no titles on the line). A second squash match for JBL took an unexpected turn when El Gran Luchadore pulled a switcharoo with [[Eddie Guerrero]] (in El Gran's costume) who came back fighting. When JBL finally clued that it was Guerrero, he ran away from the ring getting counted out in the process, allowing El Gran Luchadore to pick up his first victory.

The next appearance of El Gran Luchadore was on July 15, 2004 edition of ''SmackDown!''. During a Steel Cage match between Guerrero and JBL which saw both men sat on top of the Cage, exchanging punches until El Gran Luchadore ran down and climbed into the cage. This El Gran Luchadore held Eddie Guerrero's leg, allowing Bradshaw to climb down the side of the cage to win. After the match El Gran Luchadore tried to get out of the locked door, but then decided to climb out the way he came in.  Eddie Guerrero got to his feet and climbed up the cage struggling to get him back into the cage. Luchadore was able to get away, but in the struggle Guerrero pulled the mask off of him, revealing him to be the supposedly injured [[Kurt Angle]].

'''Estadio Defensores del Chaco''' is a [[multi-purpose stadium]] in [[Asunción]], [[Paraguay]].  It is currently used mostly for [[football (soccer)|football]] matches.  The stadium once had a 50,000+ capacity, however over the years the stadium has undergone remodeling, dropping the capacity to 42,354.&lt;ref name="worldstadiums.com"/&gt; The stadium was again renovated in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.5dias.com.py/40331-estiman-que-obra-del-defensores-superara-los-us-2-5-millones ]{{dead link|date=September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The stadium was opened in 1917 and its first name was "Estadio de Puerto Sajonia" because it was located in the [[Sajonia (Asunción)|Sajonia]] neighbourhood in Asunción. After Uruguay won the Olympic gold medal in football in [[Football at the 1924 Summer Olympics|1924]], the Paraguayan Football Association decided to rename the stadium "Uruguay" to honor the South American Nation. Later, the name was reverted to Estadio Puerto Sajonia.

During the [[Chaco War]], the stadium was used as a munitions depot and troop meeting arena. After the war, it was renamed with the current name "Defensores del Chaco" (Defenders of the Chaco) in honour of the triumphant soldiers that took part in the [[Chaco War]] between [[Paraguay]] and [[Bolivia]]. It underwent renovations during 1939, 1996 and 2007.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apf.cerocinco.net/insta_defensores.php Asociación Paraguaya de Fútbol&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080107073220/http://apf.cerocinco.net/insta_defensores.php |date=2008-01-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stadium is not owned by a team (it is a [[List of national stadiums|national stadium]]) and it is used primarily to host the home games of the [[Paraguay national football team]] and for international football club tournament games such as the [[Copa Libertadores]] and the [[Copa Sudamericana]]. It also held important matches during the 1999 [[Copa América]], including the final in which [[Brazil national football team|Brazil]] defeated [[Uruguay national football team|Uruguay]].

==Tenants==
The [[Paraguay national football team]] plays their home fixtures at the stadium during FIFA World Cup qualifiers and international friendlies.

Local clubs such as [[Club Olimpia]], [[Club Nacional]] and [[Club Guaraní]] often play their home games at the stadium for [[Primera División Paraguaya]], [[Copa Libertadores]] and [[Copa Sudamericana]] fixtures.

==Accidents and incidents==
*1 February 2009; two anti-riot police officers were killed and five injured when they were struck by a [[cement]] block that was part of the stadium.

'''Fifth Third Arena''' is a 12,012-seat basketball [[arena]] in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]], United States. The number of seats in the arena were reduced from the initial 13,176 seat design to 12,012 in honor of the number 12 jersey of Hall of Famer Oscar Robertson.  The arena opened in 1989 and is located on the campus of the [[University of Cincinnati]]. It primarily serves as the home venue for the [[Cincinnati Bearcats men's basketball]], women's basketball, and women's volleyball teams and hosts other events. It is located in the '''Myrl H. Shoemaker Center''', which was also the name of the arena until 2005, when it was [[naming rights|named]] for Cincinnati-based [[Fifth Third Bank]])
[[File:FifthThird Arena Big East.jpg|left|thumb|249x249px|Fifth Third Arena Big East Era]]
The facility hosted the 1994 [[Great Midwest Conference]] men's and women's basketball tournaments, the 1998 [[Conference USA]] men's basketball &amp; volleyball tournaments, the 1999 NCAA Mideast Women's Basketball Regional, the 2003 NCAA West Women's Basketball Subregional, and the 2006 Big East volleyball championship.

As of March 2, 2017, the Bearcats are 392–77 (.836) all-time at Fifth Third Arena, including a 42-game win streak from 1997 to 2000. In the 1999–2000 season, every Bearcat home game was sold out.  During the [[Bob Huggins]] era, it was known as one of the most hostile arenas in the nation due to the high decibel levels typical of his tenure.{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

A new basketball court was installed prior to the 2003–2004 season. It is a similar floor to ones used in the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]].  Like its predecessor, it is named [[Ed Jucker]] court, in honor of the coach who led the Bearcats to their two national championships.

The building housing the arena is named for [[Myrl Shoemaker|Myrl H. Shoemaker]], the former lieutenant governor of the state of Ohio. Prior to the building of The Shoe, the Bearcats played off-campus at [[U.S. Bank Arena|Riverfront Coliseum]] (now [[U.S. Bank Arena]]) and the [[Cincinnati Gardens]]. Their previous on-campus arena, [[Armory Fieldhouse]], has been renovated for recreational use, and is located adjacent to the arena to the north.

==2018 Renovation==
On October 31, 2014 [[WLWT]] reported that the arena, could be in line for a $70 million facelift. The project would reduce the amount of seating, but improve visibility in the arena. It would also upgrade club areas, restrooms, and even add a new roof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UC proposes $70M renovation of Fifth Third Arena|url=http://www.wlwt.com/news/uc-proposes-70m-renovation-of-fifth-third-arena/29452304|website=wlwt.com|accessdate=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 23, 2015, [[WXIX-TV]] reported the price rose to $80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hawley|first1=Brad|title=UC attempting $80 million renovation of Fifth Third Arena|url=http://www.fox19.com/story/29390542/uc-attempting-80-renovation-of-fifth-third-arena-swipe-for-renderings-of-the-potential-renovations?clienttype=generic|website=Fox19.com|publisher=WorldNow|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new capacity would be 10,818. Per the [http://ofcc.ohio.gov/Portals/0/Documents/OhioReg/2015/05272015%20RFQ%20UCN-15074A.pdf Fifth Third Arena RFQ (Ohio Facilities Construction Commission)] Construction was scheduled to start in March 2016 with completion by September 2017. The Bearcats would play games off campus during the 2016–17 season during renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Groeschen|first1=Tom|title=Gardens among options when UC renovates Fifth Third|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/ucathleticsblog/2015/06/15/cincinnati-gardens-among-options-when-uc-renovates-fifth-third/71250100/|accessdate=24 June 2015|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer|date=17 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 25, 2015, The university officially kicked off the multimillion-dollar fundraising campaign for the renovation. The UC Board of Trustees approved an interim $2.2-million funding request to allow for completion of documents in the design development phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifth Third Arena Renovation Campaign Revealed|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/082515aaa.html|website=GoBearcats.com|publisher=CBSi Andvanced Media|accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; $15 million has been raised toward the project, an additional $25 million must be raised before the board gives full approval in December. UC teams under the renovation plan would vacate Fifth Third Arena for the 2016–17 season. UC Athletic Director Mike Bohn said that [[U.S. Bank Arena]], [[Cincinnati Gardens]], [[Cintas Center]] or [[BB&amp;T Arena]] are possibilities as a temporary home. No timetable was provided on when a decision would be made on where events will be held.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Groeschen|first1=Tom|title=UC Board of Trustees approves next phase of Fifth Third Arena renovation|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/college/university-of-cincinnati/2015/08/25/uc-board--trustees-approves-fifth-third-arena-renovation/32316051/|accessdate=25 August 2015|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer|date=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On June 16, 2016, the Port of Greater Cincinnati Development Authority approved a contract to acquire the [[Cincinnati Gardens]] for $1.75 million. The arena will be demolished and the 19-acre site will be repurposed for future light manufacturing. The sale and imminent demolition of the Cincinnati Gardens eliminated the possibility of the facility being used as a temporary home arena during the renovations of Fifth Third Arena&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Engel|first1=Liz|title=Port Authority buys Cincinnati Gardens with plans to demolish arena to make way for manufacturing|url=http://www.wcpo.com/news/local-news/hamilton-county/cincinnati/port-authority-buys-cincinnati-gardens-with-plans-to-demolish-arena-to-make-way-for-manufacturing|website=WCPO.com|publisher=E.W.

[[File:Renovated Fifth Third Arena Interior 3.jpg|left|thumb|249x249px|Renovated Fifth Third Arena ]]
On December 15, 2015, the UC Board of Trustees approved an $87-million, privately funded renovation of Fifth Third Arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fifth Third Arena Project Receives Board Approval|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/121515aaa.html|website=GoBearcats.com|publisher=CBSi|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proposed improvements to the facility, include the creation of a 360-degree seating bowl, new HD scoreboard, ribbon boards, sound system, an LED lighting system which will allow for enhanced gameday presentation, new restroom and concession facilities, a new upper-level concourse with its own fan amenities, expanded food and beverage options and a new main entrance and plaza with centralized ticketing and guest services. The renovated arena also would feature upgraded locker room spaces, expanded premium seating options, including a courtside club, arena club and concourse club as well as enclosed suites, loge seating, a new Bearcats Lounge and super suites.  During the meeting, trustee Rob Richardson Jr. said the upgraded facility would support the university's objective to join a power athletic conference and in student-athlete recruitment. Construction was set to begin in April 2017 and be completed in fall 2018. Construction was originally scheduled to start in March 2016 with completion by September 2017, but the timeframe was pushed as a result of the project's complexity and pace of fundraising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tweh|first1=Bowdeya|title=UC pushes back Fifth Third Arena renovation|url=http://www.cincinnati.com/story/sports/2015/12/15/fifth-third-arena-renovation/77348790/|website=Cincinnati.com|publisher=Cincinnati Enquirer|accessdate=16 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lesson's learned from the renovation of nearby Nippert Stadium drove a desire not to rush the renovation of 5/3rd Arena, given the uniquely tight quarters of UC's campus. 
[[File:Fifth Third Arean Renovated Interior 2.jpg|left|thumb|248x248px|Renovated Fifth Third Arena Interior]]
A first phase of the renovation was completed prior to the start of the 2016-2017 season, adding four 18-seat luxury suites on the sixth floor of the arena behind the north baseline of the court, which formerly housed the UCATS Club. Each suite features granite countertops, a flat-screen television, along with custom cabinets and furniture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sixth Floor Suites Coming To Fifth Third Arena For 2016–17 Season|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/m-baskbl/spec-rel/081516aaa.html|website=GoBearcats.com|publisher=CBSi|accessdate=28 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These suites were used during the 2016-2017 season. Men's and women's basketball and volleyball home events would be conducted off campus during the 2017–18 season while the rest of the renovation was performed. Major renovation work began after the 2016–17 season and is set to be completed by November 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usa.skanska.com/News--Press/Display-news/?nid=MoBapmTT|title=Skanska renovates Fifth Third Arena at the University of Cincinnati, USA, for USD 50M|website=Skanska|publisher=Skanska|accessdate=29 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On February 10, 2017, the university announced that home men's basketball games would be moved to [[BB&amp;T Arena]] on the campus of [[Northern Kentucky University]] in [[Highland Heights, Kentucky]] during the renovations of Fifth Third Arena.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/cincinnati/news/2017/02/10/uc-picks-temporary-basketball-home-for-fifth-third.html|title=UC picks temporary basketball home for Fifth Third Arena renovation|last=Watkins|first=Steve|website=''bizjournals.com''|access-date=2017-04-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2017, the university announced that the women's basketball and volleyball teams will play their home games in the [[St. Ursula Academy (Cincinnati, Ohio)|St. Ursula Academy]] Gymnasium &amp; Convocation Center near campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gobearcats.com/sports/w-baskbl/spec-rel/040317aaa.html|title=Athletics Announces 2017–18 Playing Site For WBB &amp; VB|website=GoBearcats.com|publisher=CBS Interactive|accessdate=14 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Main-concourse-the-armory-bar.jpg|thumb|379x379px|Renovated Fifth Third Arena Armory Bar Rendering]]
On October 2nd, 2018, UC announced the array of new concession options for the renovated Fifth Third Arena. This selection included local staple eateries such as Skyline Chili, Taste of Belgium, and Frisch's Big Boy as well as local craft brewery selections at their new in arena bars including Rhinegeist and Madtree Brewing. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gobearcats.com/news/2018/10/1/mens-basketball-cincinnati-favorites-will-highlight-fifth-third-arena-concessions-options.aspx|title=Cincinnati Favorites Highlight Fifth Third Arena Concessions Options - University of Cincinnati|website=University of Cincinnati|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 24th, 2018, ahead of the home opener for the renovated Fifth Third Arena, the University of Cincinnati announced record breaking season ticket sales for the upcoming 2018-2019 season, surpassing the previous record set in the Bob Huggins era with a new benchmark of just under 9000 season tickets sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://gobearcats.com/news/2018/10/24/mens-basketball-season-tickets-sold-out-behind-record-sales.aspx|title=Men’s Basketball Season Tickets Sold Out Behind Record Sales - University of Cincinnati|website=University of Cincinnati|language=en|access-date=2018-10-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is played between two teams of 15 players on a rectangular grass pitch. The objective of the sport is to score by kicking or punching the ball into the other team's [[Goal (sport)|goals]] (3 points) or between two upright posts above the goals and over a crossbar {{convert|2.5|m|ft}} above the ground (1 point).

Players advance the football, a spherical leather ball, up the field with a combination of carrying, bouncing, kicking, hand-passing, and soloing (dropping the ball and then toe-kicking the ball upward into the hands). In the game, two types of scores are possible: points and goals. A point is awarded for kicking or hand-passing the ball over the crossbar, signalled by the umpire raising a white flag. A goal is awarded for kicking the ball under the crossbar into the net, signalled by the umpire raising a green flag. [[Gaelic football, hurling and camogie positions|Positions in Gaelic football]] are similar to that in other football codes, and comprise one [[goalkeeper]], six backs, two midfielders, and six forwards, with a variable number of substitutes.

Gaelic football is one of four sports (collectively referred to as the "[[Gaelic games]]") controlled by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA), the largest sporting organisation in [[Ireland]]. Along with [[hurling]] and [[camogie]], Gaelic football is one of the few remaining strictly amateur sports in the world, with players, coaches, and managers prohibited from receiving any form of payment. Gaelic football is mainly played on the island of Ireland, although units of the Association exist in other areas such as Great Britain, North America and Australia.

The final of the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Senior Championship]], held annually at [[Croke Park]], [[Dublin]], draws crowds of more than 80,000 people. Outside Ireland, football is mainly played among members of the [[Irish diaspora]]. [[Gaelic Park]] in New York City is the largest purpose-built Gaelic sports venue outside Ireland. Three major football competitions operate throughout the year: the [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] and the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship|All-Ireland Senior Championship]] operate on an [[Gaelic Athletic Association county|inter-county]] basis, while the [[All-Ireland Senior Club Football Championship|All-Ireland Club Championship]] is contested by individual clubs. The All-Ireland Senior Championship is considered the most prestigious event in Gaelic football.

Under the auspices of the GAA, Gaelic football is a male-only sport; however, the related sport of [[ladies' Gaelic football]] is governed by the [[Ladies' Gaelic Football Association]]. [[Comparison of Australian rules football and Gaelic football|Similarities]] between Gaelic football and [[Australian rules football]] have allowed the development of [[international rules football]], a [[Hybrid sports|hybrid sport]], and a [[International Rules Series|series of Test matches]] has been held regularly since 1998.

While Gaelic football as it is known today dates back to the late 19th century, various kinds of football were played in Ireland before this time. The first legal reference to football in Ireland was in 1308, when John McCrocan, a spectator at a football game at ''Novum Castrum de Leuan'' (the New Castle of the Lyons or Newcastle) was charged with accidentally stabbing a player named William Bernard. A field near [[Newcastle, South Dublin]] is still known as the football field.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gaelic.com/irish-gaelic-football.html "Irish Gaelic Football"].

By the 17th century, the situation had changed considerably. The games had grown in popularity and were widely played.&lt;ref name="orejan"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Orejan|first1=Jaime|title=The History of Gaelic Football and the Gaelic Athletic Association|journal=Sport Management and Related Topic Journal|date=Spring 2006|volume=2|issue=2|page=46|url=http://thesmartjournal.com/GAA.pdf|accessdate=3 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the patronage of the gentry.{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} Now instead of opposing the games it was the gentry and the ruling class who were serving as patrons of the games. Games were organised between landlords with each team comprising 20 or more tenants. Wagers were commonplace with purses of up to 100 [[Guinea (British coin)|guineas]] (Prior, 1997).

The earliest record of a recognised precursor to the modern game date from a match in County Meath in 1670, in which catching and kicking the ball was permitted.&lt;ref name="orejan"/&gt;

However even "foot-ball" was banned &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/news/football-history-and-evolution/|title=Football - History and Evolution|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the severe [[List of Acts of the Parliament of Ireland to 1700|Sunday Observance Act of 1695]], which imposed a fine of one [[shilling]] (a substantial amount at the time) for those caught playing sports. It proved difficult, if not impossible, for the authorities to enforce the Act and the earliest recorded inter-county match in Ireland was one between [[County Louth|Louth]] and [[County Meath|Meath]], at [[Slane]], in 1712, about which the poet James Dall McCuairt wrote a poem of 88 verses beginning "Ba haigeanta".

A six-a-side version was played in Dublin in the early 18th century, and 100 years later there were accounts of games played between County sides (Prior, 1997).

By the early 19th century, various football games, referred to collectively as ''caid'', were popular in [[County Kerry|Kerry]], especially the [[Dingle Peninsula]]. Father W. Ferris described two forms of ''caid'': the "field game" in which the object was to put the ball through arch-like goals, formed from the boughs of two trees, and; the epic "cross-country game", which lasted the whole of a Sunday (after [[mass (religion)|mass]]) and was won by taking the ball across a parish boundary. "Wrestling", "holding" opposing players, and carrying the ball were all allowed.

During the 1860s and 1870s, [[rugby football]] started to become popular in Ireland. [[Trinity College, Dublin]] was an early stronghold of rugby, and the rules of the [[(English) Football Association]] were codified in 1863 and distributed widely. By this time, according to Gaelic football historian Jack Mahon, even in the Irish countryside, ''caid'' had begun to give way to a "rough-and-tumble game", which even allowed tripping. Association football started to take hold, especially in [[Ulster]], in the 1880s.

Limerick was the stronghold of the native game around this time, and the Commercials Club, founded by employees of Cannock's Drapery Store, was one of the first to impose a set of rules, which was adapted by other clubs in the city. Of all the Irish pastimes the GAA set out to preserve and promote, it is fair to say that Gaelic football was in the worst shape at the time of the association's foundation (GAA Museum, 2001).&lt;ref name="orejan"/&gt;

Irish forms of football were not formally arranged into an organised playing code by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]] (GAA) until 1887. The GAA sought to promote traditional Irish sports, such as hurling and to reject "foreign" (particularly English) imports. The first Gaelic football rules, showing the influence of hurling and a desire to differentiate from association football—for example in their lack of an [[Offside (association football)|offside rule]]—were drawn up by [[Maurice Davin]] and published in the ''United Ireland'' magazine on 7 February 1887. The rules of the aforementioned Commercials Club became the basis for these official (Gaelic Football) rules who, unsurprisingly, won the inaugural All-Ireland Senior Football Final (representing County Limerick). The very first game of Gaelic Football under GAA rules (developed by Maurice Davin) was played near Callan, Co Kilkenny in February 1885.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ceim.gaa.ie/files/8%20pupil%20SEN.pdf |title=Pupil Worksheets SEN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080719171629/http://www.ceim.gaa.ie/files/8%20pupil%20SEN.pdf|archivedate=2008-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On [[Bloody Sunday (1920)|Bloody Sunday in 1920]], during the [[Anglo-Irish War]], a football match at [[Croke Park]] was attacked by [[Black and Tans|British]] forces. 14 people were killed and 65 were injured. Among the dead was Tipperary footballer [[Michael Hogan (Gaelic footballer)|Michael Hogan]], for whom the Hogan Stand at Croke Park (completed in 1924) was named.

By 1958, [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|Wembley Stadium]] hosted annual exhibition games of Gaelic football in England, before tens of thousands of spectators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.com/sport/get-inspired/23158413|title=Get Inspired: How to get into Gaelic football|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=19 July 2013|accessdate=19 July 2013|quote=...By 1958, Wembley Stadium was being used to host annual exhibition games of Gaelic football in England—more than 40,000 spectators came to watch in 1962...}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ladies' Gaelic football]] has become increasingly popular with women since the 1970s.{{Citation needed|date=May 2008}}

The [[relationship between Gaelic football and Australian rules football]] and the question of whether they have shared origins has been debated. What is known is that in 1967, Australian journalist, broadcaster and [[Victorian Football League|VFL]] umpire [[Harry Beitzel]], inspired by watching the 1966 All-Ireland senior football final on television, sent an Australian team known as the "Galahs" to play an Irish team, which was the first recorded major interaction between the two codes. 

What then followed is the current [[International Rules Series]] between players of both codes and utilizing rules from both codes, which also gives them a chance to represent their country. The GAA chooses the team to represent Ireland, while the [[Australian Football League|AFL]] chooses the team to represent Australia. The two countries take turns hosting the series, and both countries' and sports' respective most prestigious venues – Croke Park and the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne Cricket Ground (MCG)]] – have hosted series Tests. What is known as the [[Irish experiment]] also occurred, with Australian rules football clubs recruiting Gaelic football players. Irishmen who have distinguished themselves in both codes include Dublin's [[Jim Stynes]] – a 1984 minor All-Ireland football champion who became the 1991 [[Brownlow Medal|Brownlow Medallist]], a recipient of the [[Medal of the Order of Australia]] and a member of [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne]]'s Team of the Century – and Kerry's [[Tadhg Kennelly]], the first man to become both a senior All-Ireland football champion (2009) and an AFL Premiership player (2005 with [[Sydney Swans|Sydney]], the Swans' first flag in 72 years).

==Rules==

===Playing field===
[[File:Gaelic football pitch diagram.svg|thumb|right|Diagram of a Gaelic football pitch]]
A Gaelic pitch is similar in some respects to a [[rugby football|rugby]] pitch but larger. The grass pitch is rectangular, stretching {{convert|130|-|145|m|yd|sigfig=3|abbr=off}} long and {{convert|80|-|90|m|yd|sigfig=2|abbr=on}} wide. There are H-shaped goalposts at each end, formed by two posts, which are usually {{convert|6|-|7|m|ft|abbr=off}} high, set {{convert|6.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} apart, and connected {{convert|2.5|m|ft|abbr=on}} above the ground by a crossbar. A net extending behind the goal is attached to the crossbar and lower goal posts. The same pitch is used for hurling; the GAA, which organises both sports, decided this to facilitate dual usage. Lines are marked at distances of 13 metres, 20 metres, and 45 metres (65 m in hurling) from each end-line. Shorter pitches and smaller goals are used by youth teams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport2/hi/northern_ireland/gaelic_games/4293130.stm|title=GAA pitch size|accessdate=18 September 2009 | publisher=BBC Sport NI | date=11 October 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duration===
&lt;!-- Do not change this: 99% of football games last for 60 minutes so 60 should come first.--&gt;
The majority of adult football and all minor and under-21 matches last for 60 minutes, divided into two halves of 30 minutes, with the exception of senior inter-county games, which last for 70 minutes (two halves of 35 minutes). Draws are decided by replays or by playing 20 minutes of extra time (two halves of 10 minutes). Juniors have a half of 20 minutes or 25 minutes in some cases. Half-time lasts for about 5 or 10 minutes.

===Teams===
Teams consist of fifteen players&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.gaa.ie/mm//Document/TheGAA/RulesandRegulations/12/66/56/2016OfficialGuide-Part2_English.pdf|publisher=[[Gaelic Athletic Association]]|title=GAA Official Guide – Part 2|year=2009|page=8|quote=A team shall consist of fifteen players.|access-date=26 August 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160531220641/http://www.gaa.ie/mm//Document/TheGAA/RulesandRegulations/12/66/56/2016OfficialGuide-Part2_English.pdf|archive-date=31 May 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a goalkeeper, two corner backs, a full back, two wing backs, a centre back, two mid fielders, two wing forwards, a centre forward, two corner forwards and a full forward) plus up to fifteen [[Substitution (sport)|substitutes]], of which six may be used. As for younger teams or teams that do not have enough players for fifteen aside, it is not uncommon to play thirteen aside (the same [[Gaelic football, hurling and camogie positions|positions]] except without the full back and the full forward). Each player is numbered 1–15, starting with the [[goalkeeper]], who must wear a jersey colour different from that of his or her teammates. Up to 15 substitutes may be named on the team sheet, number 16 usually being the reserve goalkeeper.

===Positions===
{{Further|Gaelic football, hurling and camogie positions}}

===Ball===
[[File:Gaelic football ball on pitch.jpg|thumb|right|150px|The ball used for a match, made by Irish company [[O'Neills]]]]
The game is played with a round leather [[football (ball)|football]] made of 18 stitched leather panels, similar in appearance to a traditional [[volleyball (ball)|volleyball]] (but larger), with a circumference of {{convert|68|-|70|cm|abbr=on|in}}, weighing between {{convert|480|-|500|g|abbr=on|oz}} when dry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/mm/Document/TheGAA/RulesandRegulations/12/66/56/2016OfficialGuide-Part2_English.pdf|title=GAA Official Guide 2016, Part 2, Rule 4.4 ii (p.16)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be kicked or ''hand passed''. A hand pass is not a punch but rather a strike of the ball with the side of the closed fist, using the knuckle of the thumb.

====Mark====
In 2017, the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] introduced the 'mark' across the board in Gaelic football. Similar to the [[Mark (Australian rules football)|mark in Australian rules football]], a player who catches the ball from a kick-out is awarded a free kick. The rule in full states: "When a player catches the ball cleanly from a Kick-Out without it touching the ground, on or past the 45&amp;nbsp;m line nearest the Kick Out point, he shall be awarded 'a Mark' by the Referee. The player awarded a 'Mark' shall have the options of (a) Taking a free kick or (b) Playing on immediately."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-games/gaelic-football/gaa-have-announced-that-the-mark-will-be-introduced-across-the-board-on-january-1-35233092.html|title=GAA have announced that the 'mark' will be introduced across the board on January 1|work=Irish Independent|date=30 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In comparison, the Australian rules equivalent requires the ball not to have touched the ground and for the kick to have travelled at least 15 metres.

=== Types of fouls ===
There are three main types of fouls in Gaelic Football, which can result in the ball being given to the other team, a player being cautioned, a player being removed from the field, or even the game being terminated.

==== Technical fouls ====
The following are considered technical fouls ("fouling the ball"):
* Going five steps without releasing, bouncing or soloing the ball (soloing involves kicking the ball into one's own hands)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/page/all_about_football.html |title=All About Football |accessdate=18 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090204082354/http://www.gaa.ie/page/all_about_football.html |archivedate=4 February 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Bouncing the ball twice in a row (It may be soloed continuously)
* Changing hands: Throwing the ball from your right hand to left or vice versa (legal in the ladies' game)
* Throwing the ball (it may be "hand-passed" by striking with the fist).
* Hand passing a goal. To hand pass a ball with an open palm there must be a clear striking action (the ball may be punched over the bar from up in the air, but not into the goal).
* Picking the ball directly off the ground (it must be scooped up into the hands by the foot). However, in [[Ladies' Gaelic football#Differences from men's football|ladies' Gaelic football]] the ball may be picked up directly.
* Square ball is an often controversial rule: "If, at the moment the ball enters the small square, there is already an attacking player inside the small rectangle, then a free out is awarded." As of 2012 square balls are only counted if the player is inside the square when the ball is kicked from a free or set piece. An opposing player is allowed in the square during open play.

==== Aggressive fouls ====
Aggressive fouls are physical or verbal fouls committed by a player against an opponent or the referee. The player can be cautioned (shown a [[Penalty card#Yellow card|yellow card]]), ordered off the pitch without a substitute ([[Penalty card#Red card|red card]]),&lt;ref name="GAA Rules 2012, p. 74–81, Rule 5"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/content/documents/publications/official_guides/Official_Guide_2012_Part2.pdf |title=Official Guide – Part 2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502173622/http://gaa.ie/content/documents/publications/official_guides/Official_Guide_2012_Part2.pdf |archivedate= 2 May 2013 |df= }}GAA Rules 2012, p. 74–81, Rule 5&lt;/ref&gt; or (beginning 1 January 2014) ordered off the pitch with a substitution ([[Penalty card#Black card|black card]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.independent.ie/sport/gaelic-football/gaa-pass-controversial-black-card-rule-29150028.html|date=23 March 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=[[Irish Independent]]|title=GAA pass controversial 'black card' rule}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{triple image|right|Yellow card.svg|60|Red card.svg|60|Black card.svg|60|
Players are cautioned by a yellow card, ordered off the pitch without a substitute by a red card, or  ordered off the pitch with a substitution by a black card.}}

==== Dissent ====
A dissent foul is a foul where a player fails to comply with the officials' judgment and/or instructions. The player can be cautioned (shown a yellow card), ordered off the pitch without a substitute (red card), the free kick placement moved 13&amp;nbsp;m further down-field, or in certain circumstances, the game can be terminated. The following are considered dissent fouls:
* To challenge the authority of a referee, umpire, linesman or sideline official.
* To fail to comply with a referee's instruction to use a mouth guard.
* To refuse to leave the field of play, on the instruction of the referee, for attention, after an injury involving bleeding.
* To show dissent with the referee's decision to award a free kick to the opposing team.
* To refuse to leave the field of play when ordered off (red card) or rejoin the game after being ordered off.
* A team or player(s) leaving the field without the referee's permission or refusing to continue playing.&lt;ref name="GAA Rules 2012, p. 82-83, Rule 6"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gaa.ie/content/documents/publications/official_guides/Official_Guide_2012_Part2.pdf |title=Official Guide – Part 2 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130502173622/http://gaa.ie/content/documents/publications/official_guides/Official_Guide_2012_Part2.pdf |archivedate= 2 May 2013 |df= }} GAA Rules 2012, pp. 82–83, Rule 6&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scoring===
{{Main|Scoring in Gaelic games}}
[[File:Durham Gaelic football club player shoots.jpg|thumb|right|170px|A player from a [[Canada GAA]] club shoots for goal]]
If the ball goes over the crossbar, a ''point'' is scored and a white flag is raised by an umpire. A point is scored by either kicking the ball over the crossbar, or fisting it over, in which case the hand must be closed while striking the ball. If the ball goes below the crossbar, a ''goal'', worth three points, is scored, and a green flag is raised by an umpire. A goal is scored by kicking the ball into the net, not by fist passing the ball into it. However, a player can strike the ball into the net with a closed fist if the ball was played to him by another player or came in contact with the post/crossbar/ground prior to connection. The goal is guarded by a goalkeeper. Scores are recorded in the format Goal Total-Point Total. To determine the score-line goals must be converted to points and added to the other points. For example, in a match with a final score of Team A 0–21 Team B 4–8, Team A is the winner with 21 points, as Team B scored only 20 points (4 times 3, plus 8).

===Tackling===
The level of tackling allowed is less robust than in [[rugby football|rugby]].

Shoulder to shoulder contact and slapping the ball out of an opponent's hand are permitted, but the following are all fouls:
* Blocking a shot with the foot
* Pulling an opponent's jersey
* Pushing an opponent
* Sliding tackles
* Striking an opponent
* Touching the goalkeeper when he/she is inside the small rectangle
* Tripping
* Using both hands to tackle
* Wrestling the ball from an opponent's hands

===Restarting play===
* A match begins with the [[referee]] throwing the ball up between the four mid fielders.
* After an attacker has put the ball wide of the goals or scored a point or a goal, the goalkeeper may take a '''kick out''' from the ground at the 13&amp;nbsp;m line. All players must be beyond the 20&amp;nbsp;m line.
* After a defender has put the ball wide of the goals, an attacker may take a "'''45'''" from the ground on the 45&amp;nbsp;m line, level with where the ball went wide.
* After a player has put the ball over the sideline, the other team may take a '''sideline kick''' at the point where the ball left the pitch. It may be kicked from the ground or the hands. The player who is taking the sideline kick must not pass the boundary line while taking.
* After a player has committed a foul, the other team may take a '''free kick''' (usually shortened to "free" in reports/commentaries) at the point where the foul was committed. It may be kicked from the ground or the hands.
* If a player has been fouled while passing the ball, the free may be taken from the point where the ball landed.
* {{anchor|Penalty}}&lt;!-- [[Penalty kick (Gaelic football)]] redirects here--&gt;After a defender has committed a foul inside the large rectangle, the other team may take a '''penalty kick''' from the ground from the centre of the 11&amp;nbsp;m line. Only the goalkeeper may guard the goals.
* If many players are struggling for the ball and it is not clear who was fouled first, the referee may choose to throw the ball up between two opposing players.

===Officials===
A football match is overseen by up to eight officials:

* The referee
* Two linesmen
* Sideline official/Standby linesman (often referred to as "fourth official"; inter-county games only)
* Four umpires (two at each goal)

The referee is responsible for starting and stopping play, recording the score, awarding frees and booking and sending off players.

Linesmen are responsible for indicating the direction of line balls to the referee.

The fourth official is responsible for overseeing substitutions, and also indicating the amount of stoppage time (signalled to him by the referee) and the players substituted using an electronic board.

The umpires are responsible for judging the scoring. They indicate to the referee whether a shot was: wide (spread both arms), a 45&amp;nbsp;m kick (raise one arm), a point (wave white flag), square ball (cross arms) or a goal (wave green flag). A disallowed score is indicated by crossing the green and white flags.

Other officials are not obliged to indicate any misdemeanours to the referee; they are only permitted to inform the referee of violent conduct they have witnessed that has occurred without the referee's knowledge. A linesman/umpire is not permitted to inform the referee of technical fouls such as a "double bounce" or an illegal pick-up of the ball. Such decisions can only be made at the discretion of the referee.

==Team of the Century==
'''The Team of the Century''' was nominated in 1984 by ''[[Sunday Independent (Ireland)|Sunday Independent]]'' readers and selected by a panel of experts including journalists and former players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first=Eoghan| last=Corry| title=The GAA Book of Lists| publisher=Hodder Headline Ireland| year=2005| page=238}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was not chosen as part of the [[Gaelic Athletic Association]]'s centenary year celebrations. The goal was to single out the best ever 15 players who had played the game in their respective positions. Naturally many of the selections were hotly debated by fans around the country.

==Team of the Millennium==
'''The Team of the Millennium''' was a team chosen in 1999 by a panel of GAA past presidents and journalists. The goal was to single out the best ever 15 players who had played the game in their respective positions, since the foundation of the GAA in 1884 up to the [[Millennium]] year, 2000. Naturally many of the selections were hotly debated by fans around the country.

==Competition structure==
[[Image:Children playing Gaelic football Ajax Ontario.jpg|thumb|Children participating in a game of Gaelic football]]
Gaelic sports at all levels are amateur, in the sense that the athletes even those playing at elite level do not receive payment for their performance

The main competitions at all levels of Gaelic football are the '''League''' and the '''Championship'''. Of these it is the Championship (a knock-out tournament) that tends to attain the most prestige.

The basic unit of each game is organised at the club level, which is usually arranged on a [[Parish (administrative division)|parochial]] basis. Local clubs compete against other clubs in their county with the intention of winning the '''County Club Championship''' at senior, junior or intermediate levels (for adults) or under-21, minor or under-age levels (for children). A club may field more than one team, for example a club may field a team at senior level and a "seconds" team at junior or intermediate level. This format is laid out in the table below:

{| class="wikitable"
|+Adult levels
!Name
!Description
|-
|Senior
|Contested by the top adult teams
|-
|Junior
|Contested by the weak adult teams, often from smaller communities
|-
|Intermediate
|Contested by the remainder of the teams as a link between Senior and Junior
|-
|}

{| class="wikitable"
|+Non-adult levels
!Name
!Description
|-
|Under-21
|Contested by players under the age of 21
|-
|Minor
|Contested by players under the age of 18
|-
|Under-age
|Contested by players of all ages between under-17 and under-6
|}

Clubs may come together in districts for the '''County Championship''' or compete on their own.

Though the island of Ireland was [[Partition of Ireland|partitioned]] between two states by the British parliament in 1920, the organisation of Gaelic games (like that of most cultural organisations and religions) continues on an All-Ireland basis. At the national level, Ireland's Gaelic games are organised in 32 [[GAA county|GAA counties]], most of which are identical in name and extent to the 32 [[Counties of Ireland|administrative counties]] on which local government throughout the island was based until the late 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;The administrative counties have been rearranged in the 20th century. [[Northern Ireland]]'s original six counties are now divided into 26 local government districts, while the [[Republic of Ireland]]'s 26 counties have been redrawn, leading to a modern local governmental unit total of 33. The GAA's 32 counties are mainly named for the administrative counties as they existed when the Association was formed, with some exceptions (such as [[Derry GAA|Derry]] and [[Laois GAA|Laois]]). While the former administrative county borders are generally respected, a GAA county may occasionally open its competitions to clubs that are wholly or partly based in neighbouring counties.&lt;/ref&gt; The term "county" is also used for some overseas GAA places, such as [[London GAA|London]] and [[New York GAA|New York]]. Clubs are also located throughout the world, in other parts of the [[North American GAA|United States]], in [[British GAA|Britain]], in [[Canada GAA|Canada]], in [[Asian GAA|Asia]], in [[Australasia GAA|Australasia]] and in continental [[Europe GAA|Europe]].

The level at which county teams compete against each other is referred to as '''inter-county''' (i.e. similar to international). A county panel—a team of 15 players, plus a similar number of substitutes—is formed from the best players playing at club level in each county. The most prestigious inter-county competition in Gaelic football is the '''All-Ireland Championship'''. The highest level national championship is called the [[All-Ireland Senior Football Championship]]. Nearly all counties contest this tournament on an annual basis, with crowds of people thronging venues the length and breadth of Ireland—the most famous of these stadiums being [[Croke Park]]—to support their local county team, a team comprising players selected from the clubs in that county. These modified knock-out games start as provincial championships contested by counties against other counties in their respective province, the four Irish provinces of [[Ulster GAA|Ulster]], [[Munster GAA|Munster]], [[Leinster GAA|Leinster]] and [[Connacht GAA|Connacht]]. The four victors in these then progress automatically to the All-Ireland series.

In the past, the team winning each provincial championship would play one of the others, at a stage known as the All-Ireland semi-finals, with the winning team from each game playing each other in the famed All-Ireland Final to determine the outright winner. A recent (1990s/2000s) re-organisation created a "back door" method of qualifying, with teams knocked out during the provincial rounds of the All-Ireland Championship now acquiring a second chance at glory. Now the four victorious teams at provincial level enter the recently created All-Ireland quarter-finals instead, where they compete against the four remaining teams from the All-Ireland Qualifiers to progress to the All-Ireland semi-finals and then the All-Ireland Final. This re-organisation means that one team may defeat another team in an early stage of the championship, yet be defeated and knocked out of the tournament by the same team at a later stage. It also means a team may be defeated in an early stage of the championship, yet be crowned All-Ireland champions—as [[Tyrone GAA|Tyrone]] were in 2005 and 2008.

The secondary competition at inter-county level is the '''National League'''. The [[National Football League (Ireland)|National Football League]] is held every spring and groups counties in four divisions according to their relative strength. As at local (county) levels of Gaelic football, the League at national level is less prestigious than the Championship—however, in recent years attendances have grown, as has interest from the public and from players. This is due in part to the 2002 adoption of a February–April timetable, in place of the former November start, as well as the provision of Division 2 final stages. Live matches are aired on the international channel [[Setanta Sports]] and the Irish language channel [[TG4]], with highlights shown on [[RTÉ Two]].

There are also All-Ireland championships for county teams at [[All-Ireland Junior Football Championship|Junior]], [[All-Ireland Under 21 Football Championship|Under-21]] and [[All-Ireland Minor Football Championship|Minor]] levels, and provincial and national club championships, contested by the teams that win their respective county championships.

'''Gavlevallen''' is an [[association football]] stadium in [[Gävle]], Sweden. The project was initiated by [[Allsvenskan]] side [[Gefle IF]] and [[Gävle Municipality]] to build a new 6,500 capacity stadium in the Sätraåsen area of [[Gävle]], [[Sweden]].&lt;ref name="Press release"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gefleiffotboll.se/2013/05/30/pressmeddelande-forenat-framtidsfokus-for-fotbollen/ | title=Pressmeddelande: Förenat framtidsfokus för fotbollen! | publisher=Gefle IF | work=gefleiffotboll.se | date=30 May 2013 | accessdate=30 May 2013 | language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
A new stadium in [[Gävle]] had been discussed for four years prior to the announcement that [[Gefle IF]] and [[Gävle Municipality]] had agreed. The main reason for building a new stadium is the new stadium criteria by the [[Swedish Football Association]] which went into effect in 2014.&lt;ref name="Press release" /&gt; The new stadium will replace [[Strömvallen]]. The stadium was given its name on 30 November 2014 after a public vote initiated by Gävle Municipality had taken place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.gd.se/gastrikland/gavle/har-ar-namnet-pa-gefle-if-s-nya-fotbollsarena | title=Här är namnet på Gefle IF:s nya fotbollsarena | publisher=Gefle Dagblad | work=gd.se | date=30 November 2014 | accessdate=30 November 2014 | language=Swedish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first game at Gavlevallen was played on May 20, 2015 when [[Gefle IF]] won against [[GIF Sundsvall]] (3–1).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.svenskafans.com/fotboll/gefle/premiarvinst-pa-gavlevallen-531953.aspx&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hurst Park Racecourse''' was a [[racecourse]] at [[Moulsey Hurst]], [[West Molesey]], [[Surrey]]. It was first laid out in 1890. The racecourse was the scene of an arson attack by [[Kitty Marion]] and Clara Elizabeth Giveen. The two suffragettes were establishing a revenge attack following the death of [[Emily Davison]] at the Derby in 1913.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.npg.org.uk/collections/search/person/mp58990/clara-elizabeth-giveen|title=Clara Elizabeth Giveen - Person - National Portrait Gallery|website=www.npg.org.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Triumph Hurdle]] was run here from 1939 until the course closed. The last race to be held here was the Byfleet Stakes, the 4.30 on Wednesday 10 October 1962, was won by the 11/8 favourite Anassa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moleseyhistory.co.uk/books/molesey/tm/tm_19.htm|title=Thameside Molesey - Hurst Park|website=www.moleseyhistory.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mansfield Town F.C.]] bought one of the grandstands for later use as the West Stand at [[Field Mill]] and [[Ascot Racecourse]] purchased 20 acres of turf which was used to lay down Ascot's new [[National Hunt racing]] course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dennis |first1=Steve |title=Desert Orchid thriller the highlight of 50 years of jump racing at Ascot |url=https://www.racingpost.com/news/desert-orchid-thriller-the-highlight-of-50-years-of-jump-racing-at-ascot/8769 |website=Racing Post |date=24 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 1941 "A" Company of the 70th Bn. The [[Middlesex Regiment]] D.C.O moved into Hurst Park Racecourse for several months before moving to [[Cavalry Barracks, Hounslow|Hounslow Barracks]] with the rest of the Battalion.

Some of it was kept as public access to the riverside Hurst Park, with the remainder sold for the building of the present varied height residential housing in 1962. In the summer of 2018 the site of the course's pre-parade ring became temporarily visible due to the dry conditions caused by the [[2018 British Isles heat wave]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Baxter |first1=David |title=Hurst parch: racecourse returns as pre-parade ring is revealed in heatwave |url=https://www.racingpost.com/news/latest/hurst-parch-racecourse-returns-as-pre-parade-ring-is-revealed-in-heatwave/339736 |website=Racing Post |date=21 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Baron '''Ignatz von Kolisch''' (6 April 1837 – 30 April 1889), also Baron '''Ignaz von Kolisch''' ([[German language|German]]) or báró '''Kolisch Ignác''' ([[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]), was a [[merchant]], [[journalist]] and [[chess master]] with [[Jew|Jewish roots]].

Kolisch was born into a Jewish family in Pressburg. Both in business and as a chess player he was eminently successful. In his early years he moved to Vienna, then spent a year in Italy. In 1859 he arrived in Paris and in 1860-62 mostly sojourned in London. In summer 1862 he accompanied the Russian [[Grigory Kushelev-Bezborodko|Count Kushelev-Bezborodko]] to St. Petersburg, where he won a match against Shumov. Later he moved to [[Paris]] and in 1869 to [[Vienna]]. He became involved in banking and became a millionaire and chess patron, organizing and sponsoring important chess tournaments in the 1870s and 1880s. He founded the ''Wiener Börse-Syndikatskasse'' in 1869, and in 1873 established a commission house in [[Paris]]; and by prudent management he acquired considerable wealth. In 1881 he received the title of baron from [[Georg II, Duke of Saxe-Meiningen]].

As a chess player, Kolisch soon became known for his brilliant and aggressive style, but he was not a frequent participant in tournaments. In 1860 he won the first prize at the international tournament held at [[Cambridge]], [[England]]. In 1861 he lost a match to [[Adolf Anderssen]], the strongest player of the day, by a score of 5–4.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chessarch.com/archive/1861.07.23_Anderssen-Kolisch/index.shtml 1861 Anderssen-Kolisch, London Match] Chess Archaeology Accessed 01 December 2014&lt;/ref&gt;  The same year, he drew a match with [[Louis Paulsen]]. In 1867 at the [[Paris 1867 chess tournament|Paris tournament]] he secured first place, defeating both [[Szymon Winawer]] and [[Wilhelm Steinitz]].

Kolisch was the founder and editor-in-chief of the ''Wiener Allgemeine Zeitung'', to which, under the pseudonym "Ideka",&lt;ref&gt;Székely Dávid: Magyak irók álnevei a multban és jelenben [http://mek.oszk.hu/07000/07004/07004.pdf] p.18 (Budapest, 1904)&lt;/ref&gt; he contributed many [[feuilleton]]s. The protagonist in the short story "The chessbaron" (A sakkbáró) by [[Ferenc Móra]] is based on him. He died of kidney failure in 1889.

The '''Estadio Alberto J. Armando''' (formerly the "Estadio Camilo Cichero") is an [[association football]] [[stadium]] located in [[La Boca]] district of [[Buenos Aires]]. Widely known as '''''La Bombonera''''' ({{IPA-es|la βomboˈneɾa}}; {{lang-en|The chocolate box}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theage.com.au/travel/blogs/the-backpacker/want-to-get-to-know-a-country-head-for-the-stadium-20100920-15j2h.html|title=Want to get to know a country?

The stadium is owned by [[Boca Juniors]], one of [[Argentina]]'s top [[Association football|football]] clubs. The unusual shape of the stadium has led to it having excellent acoustics and the Boca support being nicknamed "La Doce ([[12th man (football)|The 12th man]]").&lt;ref name="midfielddynamo"/&gt; The pitch at La Bombonera is the minimum size required under [[FIFA]] regulations - 105m x 68m.

==History==

===Background===
[[File:Estadio_Boca_Juniors_1929.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The old Boca Juniors stadium in Brandsen and Del Crucero, where Boca Juniors played from 1924 to 1938.]]
Previous to ''La Bombonera'', Boca Juniors had used several locations before settling on their current ground on Brandsen. Club's first ground had been located in ''Dársena Sur''&lt;ref name=cien&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KxBNr-TWTZ0C&amp;pg=PA39&amp;lpg=PA39&amp;dq=boca+juniors+darsena+sur&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=H4VPZ8fTBc&amp;sig=tNUU7S3kdtAO9gE3LxmcEvfk4Yo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=lp2iVIjzC87wggThzoOABw&amp;ved=0CCQQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=boca%20juniors%20darsena%20sur&amp;f=false ''Cien años de multitud: El período amateur (1905–1930)'' by Horacio D. Rosatti&amp;nbsp;– Ed. Galerna, 2008]&amp;nbsp;– {{ISBN|9789505565405}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the old Buenos Aires port (currently [[Puerto Madero]]) and ''Isla Demarchi''&lt;ref name=lanac&gt;[http://blogs.lanacion.com.ar/historia-argentina/personalidades/breve-historia-de-la-isla-demarchi/ "Breve historia de la isla Demarchi" on ''La Nación''], 30 Ago 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lapasiondeboca.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lapasiondeboca.com/la-bombonera-la-cancha-de-boca |title=La Pasion Boca-Boca and their stadiums |language=Spanish |publisher=Lapasiondeboca.com |accessdate=5 May 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305104937/http://www.lapasiondeboca.com/la-bombonera-la-cancha-de-boca |archivedate=5 March 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; before moving to Brandsen and Del Crucero (currently Del Valle Iberlucea) streets in 1924. The club built a stadium there.&lt;ref name=planeta&gt;[http://www.planetabocajuniors.com.ar/institucion/estadio/ "La Bombonera" on Planeta Boca Juniors]&lt;/ref&gt; This would be used as home venue until the construction of ''La Bombonera'' on the same location.

In [[1931 in Argentine football|1931]], the Boca Juniors' steering committee (led by president Ruperto Molfino) acquired the lands to the Municipality of Buenos Aires for [[Argentine Peso|A$]] 2,200,000. Three years later the club published a call for tenders to built its new stadium.&lt;ref&gt;[http://biblioteca.afa.org.ar/libros/libro_52/ Memoria y balance de la AFA 1934 - Pág. 101]&lt;/ref&gt; The project was finally granted to the Delpini-Sulcic-Bes architectural office.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/3-143667-2010-04-11.html El arquitecto olvidado], ''Página/12'', 11 Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt; which would be also design the [[Abasto Shopping]] in the 1990s.

The old stadium (still with wooden grandstands) was used for the last time on April 10, 1938, then being demolished to build the new stadium on the same location. While ''La Bombonera'' was under construction, Boca Juniors played their home games at [[Estadio Arquitecto Ricardo Etcheverri|Ferro Carril Oeste stadium]].

=== Opening and later refurbishments ===
[[File:La_Bombonera_en_construcci%C3%B3n.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The stadium under construction.]]

The stadium finally opened on May 25, 1940, with a [[Exhibition game|friendly match]] between Boca and [[Club Atlético San Lorenzo de Almagro|San Lorenzo]], which the home side won 2-0 with both goals scored by [[:es:Ricardo Alarc%C3%B3n (futbolista)|Ricardo Alarcón]]. Due to the fact that the stadium did not have a [[lighting]] system, the game only lasted 70' (two halves of 35' each).

The first official game at the new stadium was on June 2, [[1940 Argentine Primera División|1940]], when Boca Juniors beat [[Newell's Old Boys]] by 2–0. Ricardo Alarcón (who had scored in the opening game v. San Lorenzo) scored the first official goal in the new venue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historiadeboca.com.ar/partido.asp?tfAnioPartido=1940&amp;tfTipoTorneo=7&amp;CodigoPartido=319|título=Boca Juniors 2 - Newell's 0] on Historia de Boca&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Placa sanlorenzo boca.jpg|thumb|right|200px| Placque donated by San Lorenzo de Almagro on the occasion of the inauguration of ''La Bombonera'', May 1940.]]
After the stadium was inaugurated, the club continued to introduce refurbishments to expand its capacity. As a result, on November 16, 1941, a second tier was opened on the north side of the stadium, near Casa Amarilla train station. The grandstand was named "[[Natalio Pescia]]" in honour of one of the key players in Boca Juniors' history.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.museoboquense.com/recuerdos_ver.php?id=000000055 El León de la defensa] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090216134622/http://museoboquense.com/recuerdos_ver.php?id=000000055 |date=2009-02-16 }} on Museo Boquense&lt;/ref&gt; In 1949 the club decided to add a third tier, adding also a lighting system. All of those works were completed in 1953;&lt;ref name="boca-bombonera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bocajuniors.com.ar/english/elclub_bombonera.php|title=The Stadium|publisher=[[Club Atlético Boca Juniors]]|accessdate=2008-11-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080704130830/http://www.bocajuniors.com.ar/english/elclub_bombonera.php |archivedate=2008-07-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; this third tier gave the stadium its enduring nickname: ''La Bombonera''.&lt;ref name="midfielddynamo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.midfielddynamo.com/stadia/intimidating.htm|title=10 Intimidating Stadiums (Worldwide)|publisher=mifielddynamo.com|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Boca Juniors celebrated with a friendly match v. [[Croatia]]n club [[HNK Hajduk Split]], which ended 1–1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historiadeboca.com.ar/partido.asp?tfAnioPartido=1953&amp;tfTipoTorneo=2024&amp;CodigoPartido=4096 Boca Juniors 1 - Hajduk Split (cro.)] on Historia de Boca&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:La Bombonera.jpg|thumb|left|200px|''La Bombonera'' during a night game v. [[Colo Colo]], with the refurbished boxes at right, March 2008.]]
The stadium was named on April 20, 1986, by team President [[Antonio Alegre]] in honor of Camilo Cichero, a former team president under whose tenure work on ''La Bombonera'' began. It was renamed on December 27, 2000, by team President [[Mauricio Macri]] in honor of [[Alberto Armando]], team president during its resurgence during the 1960s as well as a former business partner of his father [[Francisco Macri]]. The stadium was expanded and modernized during Macri's tenure, notably with the addition in 1996 of a fourth tier; and a wing housing a press area, VIP boxes, a museum, and offices. The stadium's exterior was later decorated with works by painters [[Rómulo Macció]] and [[Pérez Celis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bocajuniors.com.ar/la-bombonera/historia |title=Boca Juniors y sus estadios |work=Club Atlético Boca Juniors |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130318072252/http://www.bocajuniors.com.ar/la-bombonera/historia |archivedate=2013-03-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, ''La Bombonera'' was not remodeled until 1996 when the presidency of [[Mauricio Macri]] decided to expand its capacity to 57,500 spectators. Works included the demolition of the lateral boxes on Del Valle Iberlucea street, replacing them by a small stand and new and modern boxes (with metallic structure) placed over there. The "new" Bombonera was reinaugurated with a friendly match v. [[Club Universidad de Chile]] won by Boca Juniors by 3–1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historiadeboca.com.ar/partido.asp?tfAnioPartido=1996&amp;tfTipoTorneo=2996&amp;CodigoPartido=3589 Boca Juniors 3 –– Universidad (Chi) 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

An electronic screen was installed in 2008,&lt;ref&gt;[http://edant.ole.com.ar/notas/2008/01/29/01595690.html Lo miran por TV] by Horacio García on ''Olé'', 21 Jan 2008&lt;/ref&gt; therefore Boca Juniors stadium became the third venue with this technology after Vélez Sársfield and River Plate. At the beginning of 2012, more than 500 seats were replaced and other 500 were added, apart of building four additional boxes.

==Origin of the name==
The stadium is popularly known as ''La Bombonera''. It is said that the nickname came along the project of [[Viktor Sulčič]] during the process of development. On occasion of Sulčič's birthday, a friend gave him a box of chocolates as a gift. After that, Sulčič used to go with the box at meetings with engineer Delpine and other persons that collaborated with the project to show them that the box shape was very like the one of the stadium they were designing.

Since then, the stadium would be known as ''La Bombonera'' ("box of chocolates" in [[Spanish language|Spanish]]) and that name has remained to present days. In fact, the opening day (May 25, 1940) the stadium was named that way even by the club executives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pagina12.com.ar/diario/sociedad/subnotas/143667-46175-2010-04-11.html Una caja de bombones de regalo], ''Página/12'', 26 Apr 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, there are other stories or myths about the origin of the nickname. One of them tells that Delpini projected the stands with a highly vertical grade of inclination to host 100,000 persons (which was the first project). The shape of the stands looked like the carts used to collect horses dung in the streets of Buenos Aires. Other version credits journalist Hugo Marini or broadcaster Joaquín Carballo Serantes (aka) "Fioravanti" for the ''Bombonera'' nickname.&lt;ref&gt;''La vida color de Boca, 100 años de una pasión argentina'', vol. 1, [http://www.lanacion.com.ar/691785-la-vida-color-de-boca published by ''La Nación''], March 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite its distinguished nickname, the first official denomination came on April 20, 1986, when it was named "Camilo Cichero" in commemoration of the president under whose tenure the stadium was projected and built.&lt;ref&gt;[http://conexion2000.com.ar/bomboneraabbatangelo.htm LA BOMBONERA. UNA HISTORIA DE IDENTIDAD Y MISTICA] by Arq. Pablo F. Abbátangelo on Conexion2000.com.ar&lt;/ref&gt; That same day Boca Juniors defeated [[Talleres de Córdoba]] by 4–2. Nevertheless, president Mauricio Macri decided to change the stadium's name to "[[Alberto Armando|Alberto J. Armando]]", honoring long-time president of the club during two periods (1954–55, 1960–80).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.infobae.com/2015/11/23/1771739-los-momentos-mauricio-macri-boca-que-marcaron-su-perfil-politico/ Los momentos de Mauricio Macri en Boca que marcaron su perfil político], Infobae.com, 23 Nov 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

La Bombonera currently has a capacity of around 48,000 and the club's popularity make tickets hard to find, especially for the [[Superclásico]] [[Local derby|derby]] against [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]].&lt;ref name="independent2187963"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.independent.co.uk/americas/article2187963.ece|title=Buenos Aires: In a liga of its own|date=27 January 2007|publisher=[[The Independent]]|accessdate=2008-11-07|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080118151545/http://travel.independent.co.uk/americas/article2187963.ece |archivedate=2008-01-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Out of its capacity of 49,000, there are 37,538 seats, 2780 are boxes and 8,682 standing. Both its interior and exterior are lined with a number of [[mural]]s painted by the artist [[Pérez Celis]] depicting many of the club's legendary players and aspects of the district's culture, such as the life of Italian immigrants.&lt;ref name="bocacampeon2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bocampeonweb.com.ar/english/bombonera2.htm|title=Fochada de la Bombonera|publisher=Bocacampeonweb|accessdate=2008-11-08}} {{Dead link|date=September 2010|bot=H3llBot}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 a small stand was built on the 4th side, which had been largely open until then, except for some VIP boxes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stadiumguide.com/bombonera/|title=La Bombonera|publisher=The Stadium Guide|accessdate=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Diego Maradona]], who played for and supports Boca Juniors, has his own executive box at the stadium.&lt;ref name="independent2187963"/&gt;

There are three parking lots at the stadium for members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.agrupacionnuevoboca.com.ar/Club/Estadio/Default.asp|title=El Estadio: Alberto J.

==Argentina national team on La Bombonera==
The [[Argentina national football team|national team]] has played several games in La Bombonera, including qualifying matches to the [[FIFA World Cup]]. The squad played the most games since the 1920s to the mid-1970s. Since the [[Estadio Antonio Vespucio Liberti|''Estadio Monumental'']] of [[Club Atlético River Plate|River Plate]] was completely refurbished for the [[1978 FIFA World Cup|1978 WC]], the [[Argentine Football Association]] fixtured the majority of Argentina's home games at that venue. That decision was based on the ''Monumental'' higher capacity and modern facilities in comparison with La Bombonera.

Playing at Boca Juniors stadium, Argentina was only defeated in two games, having played a total of 27 matches, winning 18 and losing 2 with 7 ties. The squad scored 67 goals and only conceded 27.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rsssf.com/tablesa/arg-intres.html ARGENTINA NATIONAL TEAM ARCHIVE] by Héctor D. Pelayes on [[RSSSF]]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the official and friendly games played by Argentina at the stadium (as of 29 May 2018) are listed below:

==Boca Museum==

The Passion of Boca Juniors Museum ({{lang-es|Museo de la Pasión Boquense}}) was opened in 2001 during the Mauricio Macri's administration.&lt;ref name="usatoday010508"&gt;{{cite web|last=Neumann|first=Jeannette|url=https://www.usatoday.com/sports/soccer/2008-05-01-554712659_x.htm|title=In Argentina, fans go wild for Boca Juniors|date=1 May 2008|publisher=[[USA Today]]|accessdate=2008-11-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/central-and-south-america/argentina/buenos-aires/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654620587 |title=Buenos Aires Attractions - Boca Juniors Stadium and Museum |publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=2008-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070224011103/http://travel.nytimes.com/travel/guides/central-and-south-america/argentina/buenos-aires/attraction-detail.html?vid=1154654620587 |archivedate=February 24, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located within the stadium, just below the grandstands. The Museum was built on two floors and chronicles the club's rise from [[1905 in Argentine football|1905]] (the year the club was established) to the present day.

One of the exhibits in the museum is a giant football with 360-degree footage of the club's fans and players at a match. The museum also includes a [[Hall of fame]] and a large mural of Diego Maradona. Also included are non-football items such as the specially commissioned blue and gold guitar played by Lenny Kravitz when he performed at La Bombonera in 2005.&lt;ref name="fodors193396"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fodors.com/world/south-america/argentina/buenos-aires/review-193396.html|title=Estadio Boca Juniors Review|publisher=[[Fodor's]]|accessdate=2008-11-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="museoboquense"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museoboquense.com/home.php |title=El Museo de la Pasión Bocquense |publisher=[[Club Atlético Boca Juniors]] |language=Spanish |accessdate=2008-11-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081109055733/http://www.museoboquense.com/home.php |archivedate=2008-11-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A giant statue of Boca Juniors' all-time topscorer, [[Martín Palermo]], was unveiled in 2011. Other former players who have their statues honoring them are [[Diego Maradona]] and [[Román Riquelme]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larazon.com.ar/deportes/Palermo-estatua-gigante_0_269700091.html "Palermo ya tiene su estatua gigante"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304202830/http://www.larazon.com.ar/deportes/Palermo-estatua-gigante_0_269700091.html |date=2016-03-04 }} ''Diario La Razón'', Fecha: 20/08/2011&lt;/ref&gt; A total of seven Boca Juniors idols have been honored by the club with their respective monuments, they are [[Guillermo Barros Schelotto]], [[Angel Clemente Rojas]], [[Silvio Marzolini]] and [[Antonio Rattín]], apart from Maradona, Palermo and Riquelme.

[[Carlos Bianchi]] was the first Boca Juniors manager to be honored with a statue, when a monument of his figure was unveiled in October 2016. Bianchi won 9 titles during his two tenures on the club (1998–2003), becoming the most winning manager in Boca Juniors' history. Under Bianchi's coaching, the team also set a record of 40 matches unbeaten, the biggest since Argentine football became professional in [[1931 Argentine Primera División|1931]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lanacion.com.ar/1945044-la-estatua-de-bianchi-la-manera-mas-simbolica-de-inmortalizarse-en-la-familia-xeneize El DT más ganador de la historia de Boca fue homenajeado con una pieza que se ubicará en el Museo del club; además, se llevó una réplica en miniatura] by Patricio Insúa, ''La Nación'', 7 Oct 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Redevelopment==
There are planned improvements for the stadium, including measures to ease crowd congestion, use of new technology in the stadium and improved corporate facilities. These include:&lt;ref name="boca-iso9001"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bocajuniors.com.ar/english/elclub_iso9001.php |title=First in the World - Processes that have been certified with the maximum distinction |publisher=[[Club Atlético Boca Juniors]] |accessdate=2008-11-07 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080528190403/http://www.bocajuniors.com.ar/english/elclub_iso9001.php |archivedate=2008-05-28 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Main gate, museum and megastore''': Work is planned to be done on the main access to the stadium at 805 Brandsen which will include the construction of a [[megastore]], and to then connect the main access with the store and the club's museum.
*'''Third tier''':Remodelling work to install further seating and improve spectator comfort.
*'''Stadium gates''': Building work to improve access and prevent crowd congestion is underway. The first phase focuses on improving access to the executive boxes and premium seats. In addition, new software and hardware will improve access control with regard to safety and quickness to prevent crowd congestion.
*'''Creation of a corporate area''': Businesses will have an area in the stadium with VIP service. One section in the second tier, is being re-designed with two executive boxes and more comfortable seating. The service will also provide businesses with [[season ticket]]s to allow them to invite clients. It also includes transportation, museum visits and catering services.

==In film==
*Some scenes of the 1969 film ''[[Invasión]]'' were shot in the deserted stadium.
*The Danish film ''[[SuperClásico]]'', has a part filmed in the stadium.

== Nordic combined ==
{{main|Nordic combined at the 1924 Winter Olympics}}

Events:
* 18&amp;nbsp;km cross-country skiing
* normal hill ski jumping

The cross-country skiing part of this event was combined with the [[Cross-country skiing at the 1924 Winter Olympics|main medal event]] of cross-country skiing. Those results can be found above in this article in the cross-country skiing section. Some athletes (but not all) entered in both the cross-country skiing and Nordic combined event, their time on the 18&amp;nbsp;km was used for both events. One would expect that athletes competing at the Nordic combined event, would participate in the cross-country skiing event as well, as they would have the opportunity to win more than one medal. This was not always the case due to the maximum number of athletes (here: 4) could represent a country per event.

The ski jumping (normal hill) event was held separate from the main medal event of ski jumping, results can be found in the table below.

'''Prestonfield''' is a [[association football|football]] stadium in the [[royal burgh]] of [[Linlithgow]], [[West Lothian]], Scotland. It is the home stadium of [[Linlithgow Rose F.C.|Linlithgow Rose]] of the [[East of Scotland Football League]].

The stadium was opened in 1949 and currently consists of a covered and seated stand opposite a covered enclosure with the rest of the ground being concrete terracing. The current capacity is 2,264 of whom 301 can be seated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.linlithgowrose.co.uk/health--safety|title=Linlithgow Rose - Health and Safety, retrieved August 2018|last=|first=|date=1 August 2018|website=Linlithgow Rose|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2018, [[Livingston F.C.]] confirmed that their home ties in the [[2018–19 Scottish League Cup]] Group stage would be held at Prestonfield, due to delays with the installation of a new [[artificial turf]] pitch at their own [[Almondvale Stadium]], situated about {{convert|7|mi|km|0}} from Linlithgow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/football/44791100|title=Pitch installation delay forces Livingston to move League Cup ties to Prestonfield|work=[[BBC Sport]]|date=11 July 2018|accessdate=11 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''RUM Natatorium''' or ''Natatorio'' is a swimming complex on the [[University of Puerto Rico, Mayagüez Campus]].  The facility has three pools, the first is a 50-meter "Olympic" pool, a 25x25 meter warm up pool, and a diving pool which measures 25x35 meters that has dive platforms structures.&lt;ref name="10x10.upr.edu"&gt;http://10x10.upr.edu/?cat=23&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The original Colegio pool ''Piscina Alumni'' (the "Alumni Pool") was located in the same site; it was demolished to make way for the new one. It was named for CAAM Alumni who provided funding for its construction. The ''Piscina Alumni'' was designed by [[Henry Klumb]] and it was inaugurated in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.uprm.edu/oiip/building.php?id=31&amp;lang=2&lt;/ref&gt;

The new complex was designed by the local firm '''Fuster + Partners – Architects'''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fusterpartners.com/porfolio/natatorio.htm&lt;/ref&gt;  The new natatorium cost $34 millions,  which was paid by the "Autoridad para el Financiamiento de Infraestructura (AFI)".&lt;ref name="10x10.upr.edu"/&gt;  The pool will be used for the Swimming Events such as [[Swimming at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games|swimming]], [[Diving at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games|diving]], [[Synchronized swimming at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games|synchronized swimming]], and [[Water polo at the 2010 Central American and Caribbean Games|water polo]] at the [[2010 Central American and Caribbean Games]], and afterward they will pass to the University.&lt;ref name="mayaguez2010.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="10x10.upr.edu"/&gt;

This pool served as the main venue for the 2011 [[CCCAN]].

'''Rays''', formerly called '''Ray's Outdoors''' is an [[Australia|Australian]] [[chain store|chain]] of retail stores with 15 locations across Australia, selling camping, hiking and kayaking equipment and outdoor clothing and footwear. It was founded in 1958 as a single camping store in [[Geelong]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.superretailgroup.com.au/about-us/our-journey/&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been part of [[Super Retail Group]] since 2010&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sbs.com.au/news/refreshed-super-retail-lifts-fy-profit-62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.superretailgroup.com.au/about-us/rays-outdoors/&lt;/ref&gt;.

In about April 2018 several Rays began to be liquidated, with the remainder stores planned to be merged with its recently acquired, New Zealand chain [[Macpac]]. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.thecourier.com.au/story/5346516/rays-outdoors-to-close-its-ballarat-store/&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6269">'''Regional football federations of Ukraine''' is associated members of [[Football Federation of Ukraine]] in [[regions of Ukraine]].

In 2000 Football Federation of Ukraine created Council of Regions for the development of football in the regions throughout the country. It was dissolved in 2010.

== Description ==
There are 24 active members, while membership of other 3 association is suspended due to the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine. Each region conducts its own championship, while most of them has also the second and the third tiers of league competitions. Each region also conducts a regional cup competitions as well as some additional regional tournaments. Along with it each regional federation has several smaller regional federations of its own (raion and city federations). Note that the Sevastopol City Football Federation cooperates with the Crimean Republican Football Federation and often teams from [[Sevastopol]] compete in the championship of the peninsula.

Due to the 2014 Russian invasion of Ukraine, several regions were forced to suspend all sports competition due to war conditions. Republican Crimean Football Federation was raided and under the UEFA Special Commission mediation transferred to the [[Russian Football Union]]. Later it was renamed as Crimean Football Union. In 2016 Football Federation of Ukraine revived the Football Federation of Crimea in [[Kherson]].

Football competitions in [[Luhansk Oblast]] were conducted under auspices of pro-Russian separatist administration ([[Luhansk People's Republic]]), while in [[Donetsk Oblast]] competitions were resumed under united championship of Donbas.

{{About|the sporting term|the film production concept|Set piece (film production)}}
The term '''set piece''' or '''set play''' is used in [[association football]] and [[rugby football]] to refer to a situation when the ball is returned to open play, for example following a [[Dead ball (association football)|stoppage]], particularly in a forward area of the pitch. In the case of association football the term is normally used to refer to [[Direct free kick|free kick]]s and [[corner kick|corner]]s, but sometimes [[throw-in]]s. Many goals result from such positions, whether scored directly or indirectly. Thus defending set pieces is an important skill for [[Defender (association football)|defenders]],&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/rules_and_equipment/4685580.stm |title=Set-piece marking |publisher=BBC Sport |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attacking players spend much time practicing them; set pieces are one area where tactics and routines can be worked out in training in advance of matches. Some players specialize in set pieces.&lt;ref name="fantasy"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sportinglybetter.com/2012/08/fantasy-football-tips-2012-set-piece-takers/ |title=Fantasy Football Tips 2012 – Set Piece Takers |publisher=sportinglybetter.com |accessdate=16 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''South African Table Tennis Board''' ('''SATTB''') is the national governing body responsible for [[table tennis]] in [[South Africa]]. The organisation has been affiliated to both the [[International Table Tennis Federation|ITTF (International Table Tennis Federation)]] since 1950, and the [[African Table Tennis Federation]]. SATTB is based in Pretoria.

==History== 
The unification between the then South African Table Tennis Union (SATTU) founded in 1939 and the South African Table Tennis Board (SATTB) established in 1948 occurred in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tabletennis.co.za/index.php/about-us/our-history Our History], SATTB, accessed 21 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; SATTU got affiliated to South African National Olympic Committee (SANOC) and the Confederation of South African Sports (COSAS), while SATTB got affiliated to the [[International Table Tennis Federation]] (ITTF), [[African Table Tennis Federation]] (ATTF), and National Olympic Sports Congress (NOSC). SATTB was a member of both the ITTF and ATTF during the apartheid-era period of  isolation.

Subsequent to unification, South Africa received two wild cards to the [[South Africa at the 1992 Summer Olympics|1992 Summer Olympics]] with Louis Boha (SATTU) and Cheryl Roberts (SATTB) as representatives.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sports-reference.com/olympics/countries/RSA/summer/1992/TTN/ South Africa Table Tennis at the 1992 Barcelona Summer Games], Sports Reference, accessed 21 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; SATTB is registered with [[SASCOC]] as the officially recognised governing body.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sascoc.co.za/2014/01/21/table-tennis-board-of-southern-africa South African Table Tennis Board], [[SASCOC]], accessed 21 September 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6033">[[File:Donald R. Deskins.png|thumb|[[Donald R. Deskins]] in a three-point stance.]]
'''Stance''' is the position an [[American football]] player adopts when a play begins. There are three common stances used by [[Lineman (American football)|linemen]]: two-point, three-point, and four-point. The stance names reference the number of points where a player's body is touching the ground while down in the stance. Each technique has its own strengths and weaknesses; therefore, each one is used accordingly in different situations. Furthermore, stances are taught and used differently depending on the level of competition (little league football, high school football, college football, etc.).

==Overview==
In the [[National Football League]] (NFL), the average amount of plays per game is over 60 per team.&lt;ref name=NFLS&gt;[http://www.teamrankings.com/nfl/stat/plays-per-game Rankings, Predictions, Picks and Odds for NBA, NCAAB, NFL, NCAAF and MLB], TeamRankings.com, 26 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; This means that, in one game, a lineman playing the entire time could enter a stance more than 60 times. However, it is not likely to be the same stance every time. Furthermore, it is important to remember that the offensive team must remain still for one second prior to the ball being snapped. This means that once an offensive player has become set in a stance, he must stay in it until the ball is snapped and the play begins. Additional motion can result in a [[false start]] penalty.&lt;ref name=NFLP&gt;[http://www.nfl.com/rulebook/positionofplayers Rule Book: Position of Players at Snap], NFL.com, 26 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Defensive players, on the other hand, are permitted to shift as much as they want before a play. It is possible for a [[defensive lineman]] to line up in one stance and then change to another just before the play begins. He can even shift his body to another place.

==Variations==
Commonly used stances are the two-point, [[Three-point stance|three-point]], and four-point.

==Two-point stance==
The two-point variation is the most upright stance. Another name for the stance is the universal stance. The two-point is used by [[offensive linemen]] to facilitate better pass blocking because it increases their initial field of vision and gives more reaction time (to stay in front of a rushing player). Consequently, it is usually only used in a situation that will require passing.&lt;ref name=3SOL&gt;Hutchison, Coach. [http://www.active.com/football/Articles/The_3_Stances_of_Offensive_Linemen.htm "The 3 Stances of Offensive Linemen"], 24 January 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Some defensive linemen employ this stance to pass rush because they naturally obtain more quickness and agility out of it (particularly the [[defensive end]]s).

===Technique===
The "two-points" on the ground in this stance are just the feet. They are placed shoulder width apart pointing forward. One of the feet is staggered back, for an o-lineman this will be the foot away from the ball; for a d-lineman it will be the foot towards the ball. While in this stance the player's center of gravity will be slightly lowered by bending at the knees and waist. Weight is kept away from the heels to promote quickness and agility out of the stance in any direction.&lt;ref name="3SOL"/&gt;

==Three-point stance==
The most common variation is the [[three-point stance]]. The purpose of this stance is to give the player leverage and allow more of their legs' power to be used. This is the offensive lineman's most used stance. It allows them to easily stay low and move in any direction at the snap of the ball. The interior defensive lineman use this stance for the same reason; however, it is usually slightly adjusted.

===Technique===
The added "point" is the player's strong hand on the ground (the down-hand). In higher divisions of play, ambidexterity between down-hands is required. A player entering the stance begins in a two-point stance; the player's staggered foot will be on the same side as the down-hand. The player then bends the knees and waist until the thighs and back are nearly parallel to the ground. The down-hand is merely an anchoring point for offensive linemen; typically, very little weight is put onto it. Offensive linemen may have to move in any direction so it is counterproductive to put weight on their down-hand (this only facilitates forward movement.) However, defensive players usually put more weight on their down-hand to have a more explosive start as they almost always go forward. This gives them the power of their legs coupled with forward momentum for a stronger push.

==Four-point stance==
The least common variation is the four-point stance. This stance is used for maximum explosion and leverage in one direction (straight ahead of the player). Offensive linemen will typically only use it if they need to force the line forward only inches. Interior defensive lineman will use it to keep this push from happening.&lt;ref name="3SOL"/&gt;

===Technique===
The added "point" in this stance is the other arm. It is simply a three-point with the other hand put down. However, the hands in this case are allowed as much of the body's weight as the feet.&lt;ref name="3SOL"/&gt;

==Proposed bans==
The three-point stance has become a staple in every football game. However, this has drawn attention to the danger it puts players in. The NFL has gained bad reputation because of the players' long-term and sometimes life-threatening complications brought about by head injuries. The NFL's commissioner, [[Roger Goodell]], has stated the possibility of banning the three-point stance because it makes linemen more likely to initiate head-to-head contact.&lt;ref name=3PSB&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.bostonherald.com/sports/football/other_nfl/view.bg?articleid=1231381 |agency= Associated Press |title= Roger Goodell: Ban on 3-point Stance Possible |newspaper= [[Boston Herald]] |date= 8 February 2010 |accessdate= 24 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Women's World Chess Championship]] was held from 16 March to 7 April 2015 in [[Sochi]], [[Russia]]. It was a 64-player [[knockout tournament]]. It was originally scheduled from 11 to 31 October 2014 but problems in finding a sponsor and host city eventually forced international chess organisation [[FIDE]] to announce the postponement of the Championship on 24 September 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/8293-womens-world-championship-2014.html |title=Women's World Championship 2014 |publisher=FIDE |date=2014-09-24 |accessdate=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; scheduling it for early 2015 in Sochi.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Women's World Championship to Take Place in Sochi|url=http://chess-news.ru/node/17444|publisher=chess-news.ru|accessdate=27 November 2014|date=25 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The unclear state of the tournament was highly criticised by the [[Association of Chess Professionals]] (ACP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Open Letter to FIDE President Mr.Kirsan Ilyumzhinov |url=http://www.chessprofessionals.org/content/open-letter-fide-president-mrkirsan-ilyumzhinov|publisher=chessprofessionals.org|accessdate=27 August 2014|date=26 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final, Ukrainian [[Mariya Muzychuk]], seeded 8th, defeated Russian [[Natalia Pogonina]], seeded 31st. As a result of this victory, Muzychuk was awarded the title of [[Grandmaster (chess)|Grandmaster]] (GM), qualified for the [[Chess World Cup 2015|FIDE World Cup 2015]], and earned the right to defend her title in a [[Women's World Chess Championship 2016|2016 match]] against the winner of the [[FIDE Women's Grand Prix 2013–14|Women's FIDE Grand Prix Series 2013-14]], [[Hou Yifan]].

==Participants==
[[File:Natalia Pogonina.jpg|thumb|180px|[[Natalia Pogonina]], finalist of the championship]]
The players were selected through national chess championships, zonal tournaments and continental chess championships. 51 players from women's continental and zonal qualifiers:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fide.com/FIDE/handbook/regulationsWWCC.pdf Fide.com] - Regulations of the WWCC Cycle&lt;/ref&gt; Europe 28,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/images/stories/NEWS_2013/FIDE/Congress/Annexes/Annex_35.pdf |format=PDF |title=List of competitors : 2012 &amp; 2013 |publisher=FIDE |accessdate=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Asia 12, Americas 8 and Africa 3.

The qualified players were announced on 22 January 2015, subject to signing the contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/8512-womens-world-championship-2015-players-contract.html |title=Women's World Championship 2015: Player's Contract |publisher=FIDE |date=2015-01-22 |accessdate=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably, women's world number one and defending champion Hou Yifan from [[China]] opted not to play, because of a prior commitment to a chess tournament in [[Hawaii]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourgibraltartv.com/society/8519-feb-05-hou-yifan-won-t-defend-world-champion-title-in-2015 |title=Feb 05 - Hou Yifan Won't Defend World Champion Title in 2015 |publisher=Yourgibraltartv.com |date=2015-02-05 |accessdate=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chess.com/blog/hawaiichessfestival/challenge-hou-yifan-gareev-and-shankland-in-hawaii |title=Challenge Hou Yifan, Timur Gareev and Sam Shankland in Hawaii! |publisher=Chess.com |date=2015-01-25 |accessdate=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also absent from the world top-10 were [[Nana Dzagnidze]] and [[Kateryna Lagno]] (they were replaced by two spots from E13).

The participating players were seeded by their March 2015 [[FIDE rating]] (shown after the players below). 

Three former world champions were in the field: [[Alexandra Kosteniuk]] seeded 5th, [[Antoaneta Stefanova]] 9th and [[Anna Ushenina]] 15th.

The final was the only match of the tournament which consisted of four classical games (from 2 to 5 April 2015), played on consecutive days with a rest-day between the semi-final tie-breaks and match 1. Eventual tie-breaks, if needed, were scheduled to play on 6 April 2015, in the same manner as the whole tournament: two rapid games (25+10), i.e. 25 minutes for the whole game plus 10 seconds increment, the two rapid games (10+10), two blitz games (5+3) and an [[Armageddon chess|armageddon]] decider.

Pogonina had the white pieces in the first game. Before the final they had met only once, in the 2007 [[European Individual Chess Championship]], which ended in a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chessgames.com/perl/chess.pl?yearcomp=exactly&amp;year=&amp;playercomp=either&amp;pid=&amp;player=pogonina&amp;pid2=&amp;player2=mariya+muzychuk&amp;movescomp=exactly&amp;moves=&amp;opening=&amp;eco=&amp;result= |title=* Chess game search engine |publisher=Chessgames.com |date= |accessdate=2015-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the final game 4, white pieces belonged to Muzychuk, who opened the game with her favorite 1.е4.&lt;ref name="fide"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.fide.com/component/content/article/1-fide-news/8617-womens-world-championship-2015-round-4-tie-breaks.html|title=Mariya Muzychuk is Women's World Chess Champion |publisher=FIDE| date=5 April 2015| accessdate =7 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pogonina responded with her favorite 1…е5.&lt;ref name="fide"/&gt; In the [[Scotch Four Knights Game]] she tried to avoid the main variations by putting the bishop to b4 via c5.&lt;ref name="fide"/&gt; The idea allowed Black to duck the home preparation of Muzychuk.&lt;ref name="fide"/&gt; White, however, achieved a spatial advantage and overall more favorable game after the opening.&lt;ref name="fide"/&gt; Later White decided to advance kingside pawns, weakening own king.&lt;ref name="fide"/&gt; The Black also had pawn weaknesses and a sharp and dynamically balanced position emerged. On the move 41 Muzychuk carried out a simplifying combination, transposing to an [[Chess endgame|endgame]] with two strong [[passed pawn]]s against a knight.&lt;ref name="fide"/&gt; Pogonina was left with no winning chances, and the game ended in a [[Draw (chess)|draw]] on the move 56 after the move repetition.&lt;ref name="fide"/&gt;
