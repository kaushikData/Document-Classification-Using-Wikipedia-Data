'''4D Sports Boxing''' is a [[3D computer graphics|3D]] [[boxing]] [[video game|computer game]] of the 4D Sports series, with motion capture animation, developed by [[Distinctive Software|Distinctive Software, Inc.]] (DSI) from [[Vancouver]].

==Development==
Its first version, 1.0, was published by [[Mindscape (software publisher)|Mindscape]] in June 1991. The game was released for [[IBM PC|PC]], [[Apple Macintosh]], [[Atari ST]], [[Amiga]] and [[Fujitsu FM Towns Marty]]. The Macintosh version has slightly improved graphics, but a smaller screen size.

==Gameplay==
[[Image:4D Sports Boxing.png|250px]]

The game features stylized boxers in polygon-based graphics, composed of triangles, some with names suggestive of non-fictional people. All opponent boxers have different fighting styles — some prefer to attack, some to counter-attack. Some (like Smokin' Joe Blow) have great punching power, some have amazing speed; The Champ has nearly perfect attributes. The game is regarded as one of earliest, and possibly first, examples of a 3D head-to-head fighting game. During the game, the player can choose which attributes to improve in his avatar: speed, power or stamina. While fighting, different tactics and strategies can be used, like all-out attacks, counter-attacks, dodging, etc. Sometimes fights end in a unanimous decision, even 15 round fights. Draws and disqualifications are also possibilities.

A second version, 2.0, was published in February 1992. Version 2.0 was the "Electronic Arts" version which had different music, introductions, and pupils added to the boxers' eyes. The FM Towns Marty version was based on Version 2 but with higher quality sound.

==Reception==
''[[Computer Gaming World]]'' stated that the polygon graphics were strange-looking but very accurately modeled boxers' bodies and punches. The magazine concluded that "''4D Boxing'' is an excellent and thoroughly enjoyable game with an effective representation of boxing skills ... a welcome and often-played addition to any sports game library".{{r|poulter199201}} That year the magazine named it one of the year's best sports games.&lt;ref name="cgwgoty199211"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.cgwmuseum.org/galleries/index.php?year=1992&amp;pub=2&amp;id=100 | title=CGW Salutes The Games of the Year | work=Computer Gaming World | date=November 1992 | accessdate=4 July 2014 | pages=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, ''[[PC Gamer US]]'' named ''4D Boxing'' the 47th best computer game ever.&lt;ref name=pcgamerustop40&gt;{{cite journal | author=Staff | journal=[[PC Gamer US]] | title=''PC Gamer'' Top 40: The Best Games of All Time; The Ten Best Games that Almost Made the Top 40 |date=August 1994 | issue=3 | pages=42 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''A Chorus Line''''' is a 1985 American [[Musical film|musical]] [[Drama (modern genre)|drama film]] directed by [[Richard Attenborough]] and starring [[Michael Douglas]]. The [[screenplay]] by [[Arnold Schulman]] is based on the [[Libretto|book]] of the 1975 [[A Chorus Line|stage production of the same name]] by [[James Kirkwood Jr.]] and [[Nicholas Dante]]. The songs were composed by [[Marvin Hamlisch]] and [[Edward Kleban]].

The film was released theatrically on December 13, 1985 by [[Columbia Pictures]]. It received mixed to negative reviews from critics and was a [[box office bomb]], grossing only $14 million from a $25 million budget.

==Plot==
{{More plot|date=December 2017}}
A group of dancers congregate on the stage of a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] [[theatre (structure)|theatre]] to audition for a new [[musical theatre|musical]] production directed by Zach ([[Michael Douglas]]). After the initial eliminations, sixteen hopefuls remain. Arriving late is former lead dancer Cassie ([[Alyson Reed]]) who once had a tempestuous romantic relationship with Zach but left him to take a job in Hollywood. Now she hasn't worked in over a year, and is desperate enough for work to even just be part of the [[chorus line]]. Whether he's willing to let professionalism overcome his personal feelings about their past remains to be seen.

As the film unfolds, the backstory of each of the dancers is revealed. Some are funny, some ironic, some heartbreaking. No matter what their background, however, they all have one thing in common: a passion for dance.

==Cast==
* [[Michael Douglas]] as Zach, choreographer
* [[Alyson Reed]] as Cassie
* [[Terrence Mann]] as Larry, assistant choreographer

# "[[I Hope I Get It]]" - Entire cast—Contains new sections of music not in the original stage version
# "Who Am I Anyway?" - Paul—his solo, originally part of "I Hope I Get It"
# "[[I Can Do That (A Chorus Line song)|I Can Do That]]" - Mike
# "[[At the Ballet]]" - Sheila, Bebe and Maggie—the soundtrack contains an extended version not heard in the film
# "Surprise, Surprise" - Richie and dancers—replaces "[[Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love]]" and "Gimme the Ball", although one verse of the song is heard in the film. The monologues of Mark, Connie, Judy, and Greg which are part of this number are performed in other parts of the film without music.
# "[[Nothing (A Chorus Line song)|Nothing]]" - Diana
# "[[Dance: Ten; Looks: Three]]" - Val

# "[[One (A Chorus Line song)|One]]" (rehearsal) - entire cast
# "[[What I Did for Love (A Chorus Line)|What I Did for Love]]" - Cassie—sung counterpoint to the Tap Combination. In the stage version, the company performs the number, with Diana leading.
# "One" (Finale) - entire cast (8 [[kickline]]s of 17 dancers each)

The songs "And...", "[[Sing! (song)|Sing!]]", and "The Tap Combination" from the stage version are eliminated in the film, as well as most of "The Montage" ("Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love")

==Production==
{{refimprove section|date=July 2018}}
Before the show had premiered, Hollywood producers expressed interest in a motion picture version of the musical. [[Universal Pictures]] acquired the rights for $5.5 million plus 20% of the distributor's gross rentals above $30 million&lt;ref name="VarietyFeb2890"&gt;{{cite news|title='A Chorus Line' to Tune Out March 31 After 15 Years|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|date=February 28, 1990|page=53}}&lt;/ref&gt; with the stage musical's director [[Michael Bennett (theater)|Michael Bennett]] hired as producer and director.  Bennett declined to participate when his proposal to present the film as an audition to cast the movie version of the stage play, instead of a literal translation of the play, was rejected. Many directors turned down the project, insisting that not only was ''A Chorus Line'' too beloved, but it would not translate well to the screen. When Attenborough accepted the project in 1984,&lt;ref name="AFI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/moviedetails/57367|title=A Chorus Line|work=[[AFI Catalog]]|accessdate=April 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; there was some apprehension as to the treatment the British director would give the musical's quintessentially American story.

Universal sold the rights to [[PolyGram]] for $7.8 million in 1982 and in 1983 [[Embassy Pictures]] joined as co-producers.&lt;ref name="AFI"/&gt;

In February 1984, according to Attenborough, the singer [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]] auditioned at the [[Royale Theatre]] on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]] for a dance role in the movie using her birth name of Ciccone. He rejected her.&lt;ref&gt;''Entirely Up To You, Darling'' by Diana Hawkins &amp; Richard Attenborough; page 133; paperback; Arrow Books; published 2009. {{ISBN|978-0-099-50304-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The decision to tamper with the score disappointed fans of the show. "Hello Twelve, Hello Thirteen, Hello Love," "Sing!," and "The Music and the Mirror" were deleted (the first was touched on briefly) and new songs "Surprise, Surprise" and "Let Me Dance For You" were added. The show's breakout tune, "What I Did for Love," was originally performed by Diana as a [[paean]] to dancers and their dedication to their craft, but in the film it becomes a wistful love song by Cassie about Zach as she leaves the stage.

The stage musical was one of the first productions to address the subject of gay actors within the theatre. The film version opted instead to make a more "family friendly" film by dealing less with the experiences of gay actors. 
 
The dance numbers were choreographed by [[Jeffrey Hornaday]].

[[Audrey Landers]] could move well but was not a trained dancer as was the rest of the cast. Attenborough cast her in the film despite her lack of formal dance training. She is absent from some of the more difficult choreographed dance numbers.

==Critical reception==
The film received mixed reviews from critics. In his review in ''[[The New York Times]]'', [[Vincent Canby]] observed, "Though it was generally agreed that ''[[Hair (film)|Hair]]'' would not work as a film, [[Miloš Forman]] transformed it into one of the most original pieces of musical cinema of the last 20 years. Then they said that ''A Chorus Line'' couldn't be done—and this time they were right...Mr. Attenborough has elected to make a more or less straightforward film version that is fatally halfhearted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = A Chorus Line (1985) review |first = Vincent |last = Canby |authorlink = Vincent Canby |url = https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9F01E5DB173BF933A25751C1A963948260 |newspaper = [[The New York Times]] |date = December 10, 1985 |access-date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' stated, "The result may not please purists who want a film record of what they saw on stage, but this is one of the most intelligent and compelling movie musicals in a long time—and the most grown up, since it isn't limited, as so many contemporary musicals are, to the celebration of the survival qualities of geriatric actresses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Chorus Line review |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19851220/REVIEWS/512200301/1023 |newspaper=[[Chicago Sun-Times]] |date=December 20, 1985 |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6mW8Ca1?url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F19851220%2FREVIEWS%2F512200301%2F1023 |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said, "''Chorus'' often seems static and confined, rarely venturing beyond the immediate. Attenborough merely films the stage show as best he could. Nonetheless, the director and lenser Ronnie Taylor have done an excellent job working within the limitations, using every trick they could think of to keep the picture moving. More importantly, they have a fine cast, good music and a great, popular show to work with. So if all they did was get it on film, that's not so bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|date=December 31, 1984 |title=A Chorus Line review |journal=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117789892 |accessdate=December 20, 2010 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5v6ml3986?url=http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117789892?refcatid=31 |archivedate=December 20, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Time Out London]]'' says, "The grit and drive of the original have been dissipated into studiously unkempt glitz as empty as plasticised pop ... It's too corny and unbelievable for words."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title = Time Out Film Guide |last = R. |first = A |year =  |publisher = [[Time Out (company)|Time Out]] |location = London, UK |ISBN =  |page =  |url = http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/69214/a_chorus_line.html |accessdate = December 20, 2010 |archiveurl = https://www.webcitation.org/5v6nsS7NQ?url=http://www.timeout.com/film/reviews/69214/a_chorus_line.html |archivedate = December 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kelly Bishop]], the original stage Sheila, noted, "It was appalling when director Richard Attenborough went on a talk show and said 'this is a story about kids trying to break into show business.' I almost tossed my TV out the window; I mean what an idiot! It's about veteran dancers looking for one last job before it's too late for them to dance anymore. No wonder the film sucked!"{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

{{As of|August 2017}} ''A Chorus Line'' currently holds a 39% rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=A Chorus Line (1985) |url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/chorus_line/ |website=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |access-date=August 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==
===Sales===
''Alien Nations'' was a commercial hit in the German market. ''[[Der Spiegel]]''{{'}}s Frank Patalong noted that it was one of the [[construction and management simulation]]s that "dominated the German sales charts for years", alongside ''[[Anno 1602]]'' and the ''[[The Settlers|Settlers]]'' series.&lt;ref name=spiegel&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=http://archive.is/brlik | url=http://www.spiegel.de/netzwelt/web/anno-1503-wuselige-zeitreise-a-220745.html | title=Wuselige Zeitreise | date=January 11, 2002| author=Patalong, Frank | work=[[Der Spiegel]] | archivedate=November 30, 2018 | deadurl=no | language=[[German language|German]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; In German-speaking countries, it sold 150,000 units by June 2000. At the time, ''[[Der Standard]]'' reported that this made it "the best-selling computer game in the German-speaking world this year."&lt;ref name=150k&gt;{{cite web | url=https://derstandard.at/247922/Oesterreichische-Computerspiele-im-internationalen-Rampenlicht | title=Österreichische Computerspiele im internationalen Rampenlicht | date=June 8, 2000 | author=Isenegger, Peter | work=[[Der Standard]] | language=[[German language|German]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also a success in Russia, with sales of 80,000 units by April 2001.&lt;ref name=80k&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181202032438/https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/jowood-in-russland,1336864.html| url=https://www.gamestar.de/artikel/jowood-in-russland,1336864.html | title=JoWood in Russland | author=''GameStar'' Editors | date=April 20, 2001 | archivedate=December 2, 2018 | work=[[GameStar]] | language=[[German language|German]] | deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Alien Nations'' ultimately sold "just under a million copies" by 2016, according to Micharl Furtenbach of [[Red Bull]].&lt;ref name=redbull&gt;{{cite web | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20181202033039/https://www.redbull.com/at-de/games-aus-oesterreich-teil-1 | url=https://www.redbull.com/at-de/games-aus-oesterreich-teil-1 | title=Heimat bist du großer Spieleentwickler!

===Critical reviews===
Oleg Hazhinskiy of [[Game.EXE]] gave the game 4.1/5 and noted its strong similarities with ''[[The Settlers]]'' series. Among differences, he praised the marketing system, but also mentioned lacking combat.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |script-title=ru:Наследники по прямой |trans-title=Direct Heirs |url= |first=Олег |last=Хажинский |date=September 2001 |volume=9 |pages=58–59 |magazine=[[Game.EXE]] |publisher=Computerra |location=Moscow |language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Am Sklavenmarkt''' (German: "at the [[slavery|slave market]]")''  is a [[Short film|short]] [[1907 in film|1907]] [[Austria]]n [[pornographic film]] [[Film director|directed]] by [[Johann Schwarzer]] (1880-1914) at his studio [[:de:Saturn-Film|Saturn-Film]] company. The film is {{convert|50|m|ft}} long. It is possibly the first [[Cinema of Austria|Austrian film]] ever made and one of the earliest films to use [[eroticism|erotic]] elements in Austrian films.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The first image is taken from ''Am Sklavenmarkt''.&lt;ref&gt;''Im Kino erlebe ich die Welt - 100 Jahre Kino und Film in Österreich'' (1996) by Walter Fritz Vienna, p.146, {{ISBN|978-3-85447-661-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Story==
A [[pasha]] sits on a mat on the grass in front of a round tent, smoking from his water-pipe, ready to buy some new slave girls. His servant calls the seller and his two [[henchmen]], who bring forth four girls in patterned [[burnoose]]s. The first is totally undressed and sent into the tent; the next girl gets [[Toplessness|topless]] and is also sent into the tent; the third is forced to undress by the henchmen and also sent inside. The fourth, apparently a younger girl, is dismissed by the [[Arab]] after showing her small, firm breasts, and she goes back with the henchmen. After a customary argument over the price, the slave master goes away happy.

'''Andean new-age music''' is a fusion genre of [[new-age music]] with [[Peru]]vian [[flute]] and/or [[Paraguay]]an [[harp]] music. The Peruvian roots stem from the [[Inca]] (Inka) influence circa 1200–1532 [[Common Era|CE]]. In Peru, two important flutes are used: The ''[[quena]]'', a flute much like the common recorder; and the ''[[zampoña]]'', a [[pan flute]]. The [[Paracas culture]], located south of [[Lima]], created this pan flute some time between 200 BCE and 300 CE. The Paraguayan harp is similar both in looks and sound to the [[Irish folk music|Irish]] [[Celtic harp]]. Although the genres of both Peruvian and Paraguayan traditional music have a new-age sound to some Westerners, they are actually very ancient forms of music.

The 2008 Awards were held on 7th March 2008 at the National Institute of Dramatic Arts (NIDA).]]

AIMIA is best known for its annual awards that recognise the best digital work in Australia. Now approaching their 20th year, the AIMIA Awards are the longest running and most prestigious awards in Australia's digital industry.

The AIMIA Awards are the peak awards for the digital industry in Australia, and year after year continue to deliver a strong and innovative showcase of award winning digital creations.

==History of AIMIA==
AIMIA was founded by Richard Heale the CEO of the Perth-based New Media company Interactive Logic and a group of other invited CEO's from companies in Sydney, Melbourne and Brisbane.

The idea for AIMIA came from a conversation between Richard and Michael Gale who at the time was the CEO of the Authorware distributorship in Australia. Michael's commercial network afforded the opportunity to invite interested parties to an initial meeting in Sydney. Michael Gale also provided the initial funding and sponsorship for the organization. At this meeting Richard Heale brought a Perth lawyer, Martin Haas of Murie Edward, to draft an initial constitution and AIMIA was born.

Richard Heale was the first AIMIA President, a position he held for the first two years of the organizations life. Paul Campbell of ICE Media in Brisbane was elected Treasurer and John Caitlin of Applied Learning in Sydney its Vice-President, other board members included Stephen Schwalger, Marius Coomans &amp; Kevin Karp.

AIMIA's initial primary focus was not on creating awards and their associated ceremonies but on creating federal government support for the fledgling New Media industry. AIMIA did organize awards and ceremonies the first taking place in Perth in 1992. However, at the time the AIMIA board realized that New Media had a significant role to play in Australia's mixed economy. New Media had both export potential and the opportunity to make certain aspects of the economy more efficient and effective.

In 1994 the AIMIA board gained funding from the Department of Industry and Technology to appoint the organizations first permanent national CEO and subsequently state based officers. Interviews were conducted in Sydney &amp; Melbourne, by federal government and AIMIA officials, and from a strong list of candidates Stephen Schwalger was appointed.

The appointment of Stephen Schwalger (CEO 1994-1997), who had been a member of AIMIA's first national board, gave AIMIA the everyday horsepower it needed to develop appropriate foundations for the New Media industry in Australia.

After considerable lobbying of the federal government by the AIMIA board &amp; CEO, significant funds were allocated to AIMIA and the New Media industry as part of the ''''Creative Nation'''' initiative from the Keating labour government. Creative Nation was launched in each Australian capital city in 1994 by the Hon Simon Crean and Richard Heale AIMIA's president.

Significant components of the Creative Nation initiative included:

'''The Multimedia Enterprise''' - A funding bank for the creation of CD titles (there was no internet at that time for content commercialization)
'''Australia on CD''' - Where Australian cultural institutions and New Media companies were encouraged to collaborate and bid for a pool of funds to create CD titles that reflected Australian history and culture.

Over the next three (1994 - 1997) years AIMIA grew from a membership of 40 companies to over 800, set up State and federal structure for the association and negotiated state federal funding for industry development staff in 4 states, developed and managed a three-year export strategy in conjunction with Austrade which resulted in Australian companies entering markets in UK, USA, Europe, Canada, Japan, Korea and Taiwan. Exports generated in this period exceeded $250 million on Austrade figures and introduced the AIMIA national conference program and the annual industry awards for excellence.

'''Bad girl art''' is the name for the [[superhero]]ine art trend that emerged during the 1990s.

==History==
{{Expand section|1=a mention of the decline of the trend during the late 1990s and early 2000s &amp; more examples of '''notable''' bad girl characters|date=December 2015|small=no}}
The term "bad girl art" was coined in the 1990s as an allusion – and contrast – to the "[[good girl art]]" movement that started in the 1940s, and is used to refer to the trend of [[femme fatale]] heroines that started in 1993.&lt;ref name="Conroy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Conroy|first1=Mike|title=500 Great Comic Book Action Heroes|date=2004|publisher=Collins &amp; Brown|location=London|isbn=9781844110049|pages=198-199}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabilliet"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gabilliet|first1=Jean-Paul|last2=Beaty|first2=Bart|last3=Nguyen|first3=Nick|title=Of Comics and Men: A Cultural History of American Comic Books|date=2010|publisher=University Press of Mississippi|location=Jackson|isbn=9781604732672|pages=102-103|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "bad girl" art trend was derived from the exaggerated visual styles of the male and female form first used in the late 80s by artists such as [[Rob Liefeld]] and [[Jim Lee]]. The precursors to the trend were ''[[Vampirella]]'', created by publisher James Warren in 1969, and [[Marvel Comics]]' ''[[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]]'', created by [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]] in 1981.&lt;ref name="Conroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabilliet"/&gt;

Notable "bad girl" characters in the 1990s include the [[Harris Publications#Harris Comics|Harris Comics]] revival of ''Vampirella''; ''[[Lady Death]]'', created by writer [[Brian Pulido]] and artist [[Steven Hughes]] in 1992; ''[[Razor (character)|Razor]]'', created by Everett Hartsoe in 1992; ''[[Shi (comics)|Shi]]'', created by [[William Tucci|Billy Tucci]] in 1993; ''[[Angela (comics)|Angela]]'', created by [[Neil Gaiman]] in 1993; ''[[Glory (comics)|Glory]]'' and ''[[Avengelyne]]'', created by [[Rob Liefeld]] in 1993 and 1995 respectively, and ''[[Witchblade]]'', created by [[Marc Silvestri]] in 1995.&lt;ref name="Conroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabilliet"/&gt;

"Bad girl" characters dress in revealing costumes, possess shapely physiques, are morally ambiguous, wield supernatural powers or are of a supernatural nature, and have no compunction about killing their enemies.&lt;ref name="Conroy"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gabilliet"/&gt;

'''''Ballet Mécanique''''' (1923–24) is a [[Dadaism|Dadaist]] post-[[Cubism|Cubist]] art film conceived, written, and co-directed by the artist [[Fernand Léger]] in collaboration with the filmmaker [[Dudley Murphy]] (with cinematographic input from [[Man Ray]]).&lt;ref name="autogenerated400"&gt;Chilvers, Ian &amp; Glaves-Smith, John eds., Dictionary of Modern and Contemporary Art, Oxford: [[Oxford University Press]], 2009. p. 400&lt;/ref&gt; It has a musical score by the American composer [[George Antheil]]. However, the film premiered in a silent version on 24 September 1924 at the Internationale Ausstellung neuer Theatertechnik (International Exposition for New Theater Technique) in Vienna presented by [[Frederick Kiesler]]. It is considered one of the masterpieces of early [[experimental film]]making.

==Film credit and history==
In her book ''Dudley Murphy: Hollywood Wild Card'', film historian Susan Delson argues that Murphy was the film's driving force but that Léger was more successful at promoting the film as his own creation. However, after fighting at the front in [[World War I]] and spending the year of 1917 in a hospital after being gassed there, Fernand Léger exclusively made the dazzling effects of mechanical technology the subject of his art, and it is clear that he conceived of the film himself.&lt;ref name="autogenerated400"/&gt;

Léger's experiences in World War I had a significant effect on all of his work. Mobilized in August 1914 for service in the [[French army]], he spent two years at the front in [[Forest of Argonne|Argonne]]. He produced many sketches of artillery pieces, airplanes, and fellow soldiers while in the trenches, and painted ''Soldier with a Pipe'' (1916) while on furlough. In September 1916 he almost died after a [[mustard gas]] attack by the [[German Empire|German]] troops at [[Verdun]]. During a period of convalescence in [[Villepinte, Seine-Saint-Denis|Villepinte]] he painted ''The Card Players'' (1917), a canvas whose robot-like, monstrous figures reflect the ambivalence of his experience of war. As he explained:&lt;blockquote&gt;... I was stunned by the sight of the breech of a 75 millimeter in the sunlight. It was the magic of light on the white metal. That's all it took for me to forget the abstract art of 1912–1913. The crudeness, variety, humor, and downright perfection of certain men around me, their precise sense of utilitarian reality and its application in the midst of the life-and-death drama we were in ... made me want to paint in slang with all its color and mobility.&lt;ref&gt;Néret 1993, p. 66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; ''The Card Players'' marked the beginning of his "mechanical period" of which ''Ballet Mécanique'' is a part, an artistic technique that combined the dynamic abstraction of [[Constructivism (art)|constructivism]] with the absurd and unruly qualities of [[Dada]]. We see this trend in the film from beginning to end.

However, a photo of a Dada sculpture with the name ''Ballet Mécanique'' had been previously featured in [[391 (magazine)|391]], a periodical created and edited by the Dadaist [[Francis Picabia]] that first appeared in January 1917, and continued to be published until 1924. But it is not known if Fernand Léger was aware of it or not.

== Visual puns ==
In its original release, the film's French title was ''"Charlot présente le ballet mécanique"'' (as seen on the original print), referring to [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s [[Little Tramp]] character as he was known in France. The image of a [[Cubist]]-style paper puppet of Charlot, by Leger, appears several times in the film. It is only the first of many visual puns in the film—a seeming display of the film's sheer visual modernity, as intended by its creators from the get-go.

== ''Ballet Mécanique'' as a score ==
George Antheil's  ''Ballet Mécanique'' (1924) was originally conceived as an accompaniment for the film and was scheduled to be premiered at the Internationale Ausstellung neuer Theatertechnik.  However before completion, director and composer agreed to go their different ways{{vague|date=January 2017}}. The musical work runs close to 30 minutes, while the film is about 19 minutes long.

Antheil's music for ''Ballet Mécanique'' became a concert piece, premiered by Antheil himself in Paris in 1926. Antheil assiduously promoted the work, and even engineered his supposed "disappearance" while on a visit to Africa so as to get media attention for a preview concert.&lt;ref name=f1923&gt;{{Harvnb|Fitch|1985|pp=192–93}}&lt;/ref&gt; The official Paris première in June 1926 was sponsored by an American patroness who at the end of the concert was tossed in a blanket by three baronesses and a duke.&lt;ref name="greene"&gt;{{Citation|last=Greene |first=David Mason|title=Greene's biographical encyclopedia of composers |publisher=Reproducing Piano Roll Fnd.,|year=1985|pages=1297–98|isbn=978-0-385-14278-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=m3S7PIxe0mwC&amp;pg=PA1297}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work enraged some of the concert-goers, whose objections were drowned out by the cacophonous music,&lt;ref name=rodriguez&gt;Suzanne Rodriguez ''Wild Heart: A Life: Natalie Clifford Barney and the Decadence of Literary Paris'' (New York: HarperCollins, 2002): 249. {{ISBN|0-06-093780-7}}.&lt;/ref&gt; while others vocally supported the work. After the concert, there were some fights in the street. Antheil tried to replicate this scandal at Carnegie Hall by hiring provocateurs, but they were largely ignored.&lt;ref&gt;Key, Susan, Larry Rothe, and Thomas M. Tilson. ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=vu3O9-Yk8E4C&amp;lpg=PA53&amp;vq=antheil&amp;pg=PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false American Mavericks]''. San Francisco, Calif: San Francisco Symphony, 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the film was intended to use Antheil's score as a soundtrack, the two parts were not brought together until the 1990s. In 2000, Paul Lehrman produced a married print of the film.&lt;ref name="Antheil.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.antheil.org |title=Paul Lehrman's website devoted to the film and music '&amp;#39;Ballet Mecanique'&amp;#39; |publisher=Antheil.org |date= |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the film was included in the DVD collection ''Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894–1941'' released in October 2005.

As a composition, ''Ballet Mécanique'' is Antheil's best known and most enduring work. It remains famous for its radical repetitive style and instrumentation, as well as its storied history. Antheil himself was not a Dadaist, though he had many friends and supporters in that community.

In concert performance, the ''Ballet Mécanique'' is not a show of human dancers but of mechanical instruments. Among these, [[player piano]]s, [[propeller|airplane propellers]], and [[electric bell]]s stand prominently onstage, moving as machines do, and providing the visual side of the ballet. As the bizarre instrumentation may suggest, this was no ordinary piece of music. It was loud and percussive – a medley of noises, much as the Italian [[Futurism (music)|Futurists]] envisioned new music of the 20th century.

In 1927, Antheil arranged the first part of the Ballet for [[Welte-Mignon]]. This [[Piano roll|piano-roll]] was performed on 16 July 1927 at the "Deutsche Kammermusik [[Baden-Baden]] 1927". Unfortunately, these piano rolls are now thought to be lost.

The original orchestration called for 16 [[player piano]]s (or pianolas) in four parts, 2 regular pianos, 3 [[xylophone]]s, at least 7 [[electric bell]]s, 3 [[propeller]]s, [[Siren (noisemaker)|siren]], 4 [[bass drum]]s, and 1 [[tam-tam]]. As it turned out, there was no way to keep so many [[pianola]]s synchronized, so early performances combined the four parts into a single set of pianola rolls and augmented the two human-played pianos with 6 or more additional instruments.

In 1953, Antheil wrote a shortened (and much tamer) version for four pianos, four xylophones, two electric bells, two propellers, [[timpani]], [[glockenspiel]], and other percussion. The original orchestration was first realized in 1992 by Maurice Peress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title=Ballet Mécanique|year=1992|publisher=MusicMasters|id=01612-67094-2|type=CD liner notes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999, the [[University of Massachusetts Lowell]] Percussion Ensemble presented the first performance of the original score (without the film) using 16 player pianos and live players. The player pianos were Yamaha Disklaviers, controlled via MIDI using the Macintosh software program Opcode StudioVision.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.antheil.org&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the film was premiered with a new score by [[Michael Nyman]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Michael_Nyman.aspx Encyclopedia listing for Nyman, Michael 1944–]&lt;/ref&gt;

The score and film were successfully combined in 2000 by Paul Lehrman, who used an edited version of the original orchestration in which he used player pianos recorded after the Lowell performance, with the rest of the instruments played electronically. This version is available in the DVD set ''Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894–1941'' released in October 2005 and also in the DVD set ''Bad Boy Made Good'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://badboymadegood.com |title=Bad Boy Made Good |publisher=Bad Boy Made Good |date= |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which also contains Lehrman's documentary film about Antheil and the Ballet mécanique, which was released in April 2006. The featured film print is the original version, premiered in Vienna on 24 September 1924 by [[Frederick Kiesler]].

In November 2002, a version of the score for live ensemble (which required further editing, since live players couldn't play it as fast as electronic instruments) was premiered in [[Columbus, Ohio]] by an ensemble from the [[Peabody Conservatory of Music]], conducted by [[Julian Pellicano]]. The performance, with the newly-realized soundtrack and the 1952 version of Ballet mécanique, was repeated at the Friedberg Concert Hall at Peabody Conservatory on February 17, 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lehrman |first1=Paul |title=Another premiere, this time with live musicians performing while the film plays… |url=http://antheil.org/columbus.html |website=The Ballet Mecanique Page |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work was then performed in Montreal at the Montréal/Nouvelles Musiques festival, conducted by Walter Boudreau.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lehrman |first1=Paul |title=All the bells and whistles Weird 1926 piece resonates at festival |url=http://antheil.org/Montreal/montreal.html |website=The Ballet Mecanique Page |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version was then performed a dozen times in Europe by the [[London Sinfonietta]] in 2004 and 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lehrman |first1=Paul |title=TheLondon Sinfonietta tours the Ballet mécanique – music by Antheil, film by Léger/Murphy |url=http://antheil.org/london.html |website=The Ballet Mecanique Page |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, the [[National Gallery of Art]] in Washington, DC commissioned Lehrman and the League of Electronic Musical Urban Robots (LEMUR), Eric Singer, director, to create a computer-driven robotic ensemble to play the Ballet mécanique. This installation was at the Gallery from 12 March to 7 May 2006. It was installed in December 2007 at the Wolfsonian Museum in Miami Beach, FL, and again at 3-Legged Dog in New York City, where it was used to accompany a play about Antheil and Hedy Lamarr, and their invention of spread-spectrum technology, called "Frequency Hopping."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hourglassgroup.org/frequency.html |title=Frequency Hopping |publisher=Hourglassgroup.org |date= |accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the run of the play, the Léger/Murphy film was shown, with the robotic orchestra performing the score, at two special "after-concerts."

=== A musical analysis ===
The Ballet is hard to surmise from just looking at the score—one must hear it to get a real sense of its chaos. It moves frighteningly quickly, up to 32nd notes at tempo (quarter = 152). It sounds like an onslaught of confusing chords, punctuated by random rings, wails, or pauses. The meter rarely stays the same for more than three measures, distracting from the larger form of the music and instead highlighting the driving rhythms. However, the piece is definitely structured in a [[sonata rondo]].

The sonata rondo form follows an [AB] [A'C] [A'’B'’] [Coda] pattern, where A is a first theme, B is a second theme, and C is a middle section loosely related to A and B:

A – Theme 1 starts at the beginning of the piece. It is easily identified by the oscillating melody in the xylophones. It moves through rhythmic and intervallic variations until a bridge into the next theme (measure 38 in the original scoring).

B – Theme 2 (m77) features the pianolas, supported by drums. The melody is mostly built from parallel series of consonant chords, sometimes sounding pentatonic but often making no tonal sense at all. Antheil uses pianolas for things that would be difficult for human players (a 7-note chord at m142, for example).

A' – Xylophones return in triple meter to recall Theme 1 (m187). This is not strictly a repeat of Theme 1 but another variation and development upon it. This section descends into increasing chaos (starting m283) which signals a transition into part C (m328).

C – The xylophones and pianolas play a new tune. They stay in better rhythmic agreement here and give a more ordered feel to this section. The xylophones eventually cut out to make way for a serene pianola passage.

A'’B'’ – The xylophones return (m403) with the theme from the beginning. There are differences from the original AB part, including new bitonal passage (m530) and miniature round (m622) between xylophones and pianolas. The pentatonic melody, hinted in part B, returns (m649) and gets developed in the context of the round.

Coda – A startling change occurs when all instruments cut out except for a lone bell (m1134). This signals the beginning of a very long and thinly textured coda. It alternates between irregular measures of complete silence and pianola with percussion. The measures of silence get longer until the listener begins to wonder whether the piece is already over. Finally, there is a crescendo of pianola, a flurry of percussion and a bang to mark the real ending. The score indicates the last measure of the piece to be ended with the pianos and drums only, but modern performances have the xylophones joining back in and doubling the melody of the pianolas to create a more firm, solid, and recognizable ending.

=== The mechanics of the ballet ===
The mechanical pianos keep the tempo strictly at (quarter = 152). All longer rests in the pianola part are notated in 8th rests, as if to suggest the exactness of the instrument. At this rate, the 1920s pianola played 8.5 feet per minute of paper rolls over three rolls. This logistical nightmare has been described by some scholars as being an error, and that Antheil's suggested tempo was actually half that (quarter = 76), but in fact Antheil's 1953 ''Ballet Mécanique'' score indicates a tempo of 144–160.&lt;ref&gt;Prefatory material from the score of ''Ballet Mécanique'' published by [[G. Schirmer]] (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

The airplane propellers were actually large [[electric fan]]s, into which musicians would insert object such as wooden poles or leather straps to create sound, since the fans don't make much noise. In the Paris performances, beginning in June 1926, the fans were pointed up at the ceiling. However, at the [[Carnegie Hall]] premiere on 10 April 1927, the fans were positioned to blow into the audience, upsetting the patrons.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Blackwell (undated).

==''Ballet Mécanique'' as synchronized film==

Nevertheless, with respect to the original synchronized film, and despite the quality of last sound performance and its consistent reliability with Antheil's original plans for its concert (made by Lehrman himself and endorsed by the Schirmer publisher for the DVD ''Unseen Cinema: Early American Avant Garde Film 1894–1941'', 2005),&lt;ref name="Antheil.org"/&gt; its timing with the film  it is still in full debate today.

New points of view offers [[Ortiz Morales]], in his thesis '' El ballet mécanique y el Synchro-ciné '', already in 2008.&lt;ref name="synchrocine"&gt;{{cite web |surname=Ortiz Morales, J.M | title=El ballet mécanique y el Synchro-Ciné|url=http://ortizmorales.info/Publicaciones/Le_Ballet_Mecanique_y_el_Synchrocine.pdf |year=2008|publisher=Tesina COM/CAP.[[University of Málaga]] 2008. RPI: 2009/99900744172}}&lt;/ref&gt; He refutes all the points of view that have given origin to the realization of Lehrman and proposes other alternatives within what he calls ''the state of confusion'' around the film. Among others, the score of 30 minutes and 16 synchronized pianolas so laboriously obtained is not really the original musical idea for the film, but a subsequent ''expansion'' of the original idea, which was carried out by Antheil as a '' spectacular '' and independent concert, once proved that it could not synchronize its music together with the images of Léger.  The true film score must have been much simpler and more precise, and possibly the one that would end up orchestrating in 1953. It argues, therefore, that the problem of ''original synchronization'' was never in the 16 synchronized pianolas of the giant score,&lt;ref name="synchrocine" /&gt; but the problem with the simple version (for the film) must have been in the device that had to synchronize it ''mechanically'' : the [[Synchro-Ciné]] of the inventor [[Charles Delacommune]], possibly the first [[audio-visual]] mixing table of the story and with which it is known that they were desperately trying for a while (there is documented) the material for that film, signed by Léger and Delacommune).&lt;ref name="synchrocine" /&gt; According to technical studies on documentation (the apparatus as such was lost in II World War ) , it seems that the synchro-ciné was a '' [[synchronizer (film editing)|synchronizer]] '' capable of good audio-video simultaneities in standard measures, but the fleeting and devilish rhythm of the work far exceeded its possibilities: especially the amalgamated ones, of 7 and 5, very used in the work and impossible to obtain with a such precarious device. With a more restrained and square music, they could have been tuned and synchronized mechanically, which was what Léger promised to the press after talking to Delacommune (but before having tried it in practice with the music of Antheil).

This thesis, and the implications that it originates, has been greatly reinforced in 2016 with the publication of the original reconstruction of [[kinematic]] [[synchronism]] according to it in the so-called ''Canonical version''. This version, made with the collaboration of the [[Ensemble Modern]], and from the few truly reliable and objective data that have reached today, searches through [[algorithm]]s computer the exact copy of the film&lt;ref name="synchrocine" /&gt; and the correct Antheil score, which they both joined together in 1935 (the only time they know that proper 'timing' occurred, according to themselves). Since the various copies that have come to us from the Ballet Mecanique are different from each other (some a lot), because it seems that Léger was, little by little replacing the original images of [[Man Ray]] and Dudley Murphy until almost the end of his lifetime. Thus, in each period, a slightly different copy of the Ballet has circulated: no two are alike. That is to say, that the film was going from [[dadaist]] to [[cubist]], gradually, which explains, in part, doubts about its ascription to a certain [[aesthetic]].&lt;ref name="synchrocine" /&gt;

The '''Bibliothèque de Genève''' ('''BGE''', English: Geneva Library, Library of Geneva), founded in 1559, was known as ''Bibliothèque publique et universitaire'' (BPU, English: Public and University Library) from 1907 to 2006.

It occupies different buildings around the city: the main site in Parc des Bastions, the [[Institut et Musée Voltaire|Musée Voltaire]], {{ill|La Musicale|fr|Bibliothèque musicale de de la bibliothèque de Genève}} and the {{ill|Centre d’iconographie|fr|Centre d’iconographie de la bibliothèque de Genève}}. It also manages the library in Villa La Grange.&lt;ref&gt;[http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/en/bge/get-to-know-la-bibliotheque/sites/la-grange/introduction/ Introduction to the library of Villa La Grange]&lt;/ref&gt;

It focuses on the humanities and the social sciences with special emphasis on the [[Reformation]], the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] and ''Genevensia'' (i.e. anything published in Geneva or whose author or subject is connected to [[Geneva]]).

== History ==

Geneva has one of the oldest [[legal deposit]] systems in the world, dating from 1539, with all Genevan publications originally being deposited with a ''Chambre des comptes''. [[John Calvin]] created the library twenty years later to serve the [[University of Geneva|Académie]] in what is now [[Collège Calvin]]. The earliest mention of the library goes back to 1562.&lt;ref name="hist"&gt;[http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/en/bge/get-to-know-la-bibliotheque/la-bibliotheque/history/ History of the Bibliothèque de Genève]&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1720, the Genevan theologian Ami Lullin acquired the [[Paul Petau|Petau]] collection of illuminated manuscripts and left it to the library in 1756. 

In 1872, the library moved to its current building in Parc des Bastions alongside [[University of Geneva #Uni Bastions|Uni Bastions]]. 

The Institut et Musée Voltaire was founded in 1954, Geneva's music library, now called La Musicale, in 1962, and the Centre d'iconographie in 1993.

In 1999, the library was added to the [[Swiss Inventory of Cultural Property of National and Regional Significance]]. In 2011, its [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]] collections were included, jointly with those of the {{ill|Bibliothèque publique et universitaire de Neuchâtel|fr}}, in the [[Memory of the World Programme|Unesco Memory of the World Register]].

== The main site (Bastions) ==

=== Books ===
In 2014, there were more that two million print volumes in the library's collections.&lt;ref&gt;[http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/en/bge/get-to-know-la-bibliotheque/la-bibliotheque/the-library-today/ Collection information]&lt;/ref&gt; Since the 20th century, the library has focused on the humanities and social sciences. Many of its [[incunabula|incunable]] and other [[Early modern period|early modern]] books are available on [[e-rara.ch]].

=== Manuscripts ===
As well as 1,500 papyri and 380 medieval manuscripts, the Bibliothèque de Genève holds the papers of such Geneva personalities as [[John Calvin]], [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], [[Horace-Bénédict de Saussure]], [[Édouard Naville]], [[Emile Jaques-Dalcroze]] and [[Nicolas Bouvier]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/en/bge/collections/manuscripts-and-archives/introduction/ Introduction to the manuscripts collection]&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these manuscripts are available on [https://www.e-codices.unifr.ch/en e-codices.ch].

&lt;/gallery&gt;

=== Maps ===
The map collection was begun in 1893, when the Genevan cartographer {{ill|Charles Perron|fr|Charles Perron (cartographe)}}, who drew most of the maps for [[Élisée Reclus]]'s ''Nouvelle Géographie universelle'', gave approximately 7,000 items to the library. It now has about 45,000 maps, dating from the 16th to the mid-20th century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/en/bge/collections/maps/introduction/ Introduction to the map collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

Maps of the city and canton of Geneva are kept at the Centre d'iconographie. The evolution of Geneva over the centuries can be seen on the [http://www.ge200.ch/carto/ GE200.ch] website using some of these maps.

=== Posters ===
The library began collecting posters in 1851 and now has about 130,000. The collection documents life in Geneva, focusing on advertising, culture, social life, tourism and politics, including the struggles of the 1930s and protests from the 1960s and 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://institutions.ville-geneve.ch/en/bge/collections/posters/introduction/ Introduction to the poster collection]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Birth of America''''' is a [[Wargame (video games)|wargame]] by SEP BOA, a development team at [[AGEOD]].

==Gameplay==
In ''Birth of America'', the player controls one of the major contenders of the [[French and Indian War]] or the [[American War of Independence]], trying to achieve military and political victory.

The scope of the game covers all of North America, from [[Florida]] to [[Quebec]] and [[New England]] to [[Mississippi]], from 1755 to 1783. The game map is divided into more than 700 provinces, with a great diversity of terrain, climates and civilization levels.

There are two nations fighting each other in all of the game's ten scenarios. [[Turn-based strategy|Game turns]] correspond to one month of historical time. Scenarios vary from a few months to almost 9 years. Players control mostly the military action of their nation. This includes such activities as drafting forces, building forts and depots, sieges and blockades, raiding enemy settlements and battles, both on land and at sea.

''Birth of America'' has two wars, [[the French and Indian War]] and the [[American Revolution]]. The object of the game is to attack and capture objectives, strategic towns, and manage strategies in order to win battles thus gaining edge. Real political events, such as the battle of Bunker Hill and the signing of the Declaration of Independence, will also influence the outcome of morale throughout the game.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13563">The '''Blue Blouse''' ({{lang-ru|Синяя блуза, Sinyaya Bluza}}) was an influential [[agitprop]] [[theatre]] [[collective]] in the early [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Drain|1995|pp=181–183}}. Members of the troupe were called Синеблузники, ''sinebluzniki''.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Boris Yuzhanin]] created the first Blue Blouse troupe under the auspices of the [[Moscow Institute of Journalism]] in 1923.&lt;ref name="Drain_183"&gt;{{harvp|Drain|1995|p=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their example encouraged similar workers' theatre companies across the country and worldwide; by 1927 there were more than 5,000 Blue Blouse troupes in the Soviet Union with more than 100,000 members.&lt;ref name="Drain_183"/&gt; In the autumn of that year, the original troupe began a tour in [[Erwin Piscator]]'s theatre in [[Berlin]] that provoked a rapid growth of agitprop troupes across [[Weimar Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Erwin Piscator]]'s ''[[Red Revue]]'', staged three years before the ''Blue Blouse'' tour, had provided a similar model for imitation to these groups.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvp|Piscator|1980|pp=78–84}}, {{harvp|Willett|1996|p=110}}, {{harvp|Bradby|McCormick|1978}} and {{harvp|Stourac|McCreery|1986}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The blue workers' [[uniforms]], in which the actors performed, gave the troupe its name, under which they also published a magazine, which contained scripts and detailed descriptions of staging, costumes, and the troupe's other theatrical techniques, along with news reports and current affairs. Its variety style made many demands on its performers, requiring "a young deft man trained in [[physical culture]], trained in the striking word, in the cheerful, bold and hard-hitting song and couplet, in the contemporary rhythm of the grotesque and simplistic," its magazine explained.

The rehearsal process was extremely rigorous, requiring actors to stay physically and mentally alert through a strict exercise program and by keeping up with the political topics of the day. The year 1927 marked the end of the Blue Blouse organisation, when it was forced to merge with the more orthodox [[Workers' Youth Theatre]] (TRAM).&lt;ref name="Drain_183"/&gt;

==Characteristics of performances==
Blue Blouse theatre combined many stylistic elements and art forms and imbued them with socio-political meaning with the intent of reaching the Soviet people. In the early years of the Soviet Union, multiple small form amateur theatre groups arose. Blue Blouse became one of the most popular because of its dynamic performances that were able to use entertainment and comedy to connect with the people on a personal level about daily life and news. Each performance, though enjoyable, had a political message, which expressed the opinions of the Soviet regime to the common people, targeting the [[working class]].

Blue Blouse theatre had specific requirements when it came to basic features of performance, such as outfits, props, and setting. They even published a [[manifesto]] with details on the specific characteristics of what to wear, how to act, and what music to use. The most basic component of their outfit, and where they got their name, was the blue workers shirt as well as black trousers or a skirt.&lt;ref name="Drain_181"&gt;{{harvp|Drain|1995|p=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actors used workers garments to help connect to the populace. Other clothing also made it easy to switch characters. The clothing was often embellished with props to distinguish the role of the performer, a [[capitalist]] often being defined by a [[top hat]] or a bureaucrat by a red pencil.&lt;ref name="Mally_66"&gt;{{harvp|Mally|2000|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; The only time the actors did not wear workers clothing was during acrobatic or gymnastic performances.&lt;ref name="Deak_39"&gt;{{harvp|Deak|1973|p=39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performances were meant to be practical and accessible as well as enjoyable.

The performances took place in clubs, cafeterias, factory floors, and outside.&lt;ref name="Mally_66"/&gt; Tables and stools were sometimes used as props if they served a purpose but were otherwise thought to "slow down the tempo of movement and obstruct access to the stage."&lt;ref name="Drain_181"/&gt; The Blue Blouse collective wrote a document where they state that they "are against bright beauty and realistic sets and decoration."&lt;ref name="Drain_181"/&gt; Blue Blouse was very particular about all aspects of performance having a specific purpose to convey a specific message.

Blue Blouse theatre incorporated a myriad of different artistic mediums of performance as well as talents such as dancing and singing to create dynamic performances with identifiable acts. Blue Blouse continued with the tradition of [[living newspaper]], which involved presenting the important news stories of the day to the people. This originally stemmed from high illiteracy rates, so somebody would read the newspaper out loud. This practice evolved to the paper being acted out with visual assistance, providing an effective way to get news across and speak to the workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Deak|1973|p=40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blue Blouse used the living newspaper technique through "satirical songs, lively posters, dances, and pantomime."&lt;ref name="Mally_66"/&gt;

The performances were made to be interesting for the audience and used a variety of techniques. One technique was dramatic form, which included monologue, dialogue, and singing. Other forms were those derived from dance and gymnastics, such as acrobatics. Blue Blouse made use of posters, as well as musical numbers, and even some film.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Deak|1973|pp=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was an incredible amount of variety. Due to all the different techniques used the actors needed to be versatile and have the ability to sing, be athletic, and "transform," meaning to be able to easily adjust from act to act.&lt;ref name="Deak_39"/&gt; Actors were also not supposed to show any emotion.&lt;ref name="Drain_181"/&gt; The performance would begin with a parade of headliners and continue with 8-10 vignettes on topics ranging from international affairs to local ones.&lt;ref name="Mally_66"/&gt; The performance would end with a parade as well as a recap of the performance, with special attention on the political message.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Deak|1973|p=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the performances were meant to be fun, they were also meant to help the Soviet regime. Blue Blouse drew on folk theatre as well as urban culture to help appeal to the populace.&lt;ref name="Mally_69_70"&gt;{{harvp|Mally|2000|pp=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt; The people were familiar with folk theatre so aspects were intertwined with Blue Blouse, such as a "rupor" whose role was to present the scene and tie skits together.&lt;ref name="Mally_69_70"/&gt; As urban culture grew it was also incorporated, Blue Blouse theatre trying to stay in touch with their audience. As for the actual dialogue of Blue Blouse performances, it was supposed to be taken from the Blue Blouse newspaper that was published and tied in with local themes, using materials from papers and magazines.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Drain|1995|pp=182–183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Information was to be kept relevant to the lives of those watching the performances.

==Blue Blouse as political propaganda==
The history behind Blue Blouse serves as an explanation for how the theatre group emerged as a means of political [[propaganda in the Soviet Union]]. Shortly after the beginning of the Soviet Union, the government put the [[New Economic Policy]] into action, which helped stabilize the country economically.&lt;ref name="Deak_36"&gt;{{harvp|Deak|1973|p=36}}&lt;/ref&gt; Funds were still tight but the Soviet regime saw the benefit of beginning a cultural campaign to turn the populace to the communist way of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mally|2000|p=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theatre revival had already begun after the revolution and so the Soviets wanted to use this as a means to reach the people, and one that proved to be effective. Blue Blouse in particular became very popular along with other small forms because of their lack of funds and resources and their intimacy with the audience.&lt;ref name="Mally_48"&gt;{{harvp|Mally|2000|p=48}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Soviet regime saw that they could use theatre as a means of speaking to and manipulating the population.

Though Blue Blouse was very entertaining, it had political content and a specific agenda to get across. By the summer of 1924 all living newspapers gained backing as a "method of agitation and propaganda serving the political, productive, and domestic tasks of the [[proletariat]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mally|2000|p=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those who were enemies of the Soviets were satirized, and those who were heroes were put on a pedestal. Blue Blouse was used to "impart lessons on how Soviet citizens should live, what books they should read, what their hygienic habits should be, and how they should relate to the Soviet regime."&lt;ref name="Mally_48"/&gt; Whatever topics were relevant to the politics of the time were incorporated into Blue Blouse theatre.

Common characters that emerged in Blue Blouse for political commentary were capitalist, banker, premier, [[NEPman]], [[Kulak]], [[Menshevik]], Social Revolutionary, General, Lady, Female Worker, Female [[Komsomol]], [[Red Army]] Man, the Peasant, and the Worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Drain|1995|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of these characters were extremely pertinent at the time and carried strong political messages. In a time of industrialization the worker was a very relevant character and one that was targeted in the performances. The [[Russian Revolution]] had happened recently in 1917 and was still fresh in everyone’s minds. The NEP was currently underway as Blue Blouse prospered, making it a very pertinent topic, especially since it involved restricted capitalism and the revolution was against this. Blue Blouse frequently used these characters, and always to the advantage and opinions of the regime. Asides from characters, Blue Blouse included important political topics such as industrialization. There was one skit done called "Industrialization" which involved the actors wearing symbols which made clear they were supposed to be factories and other items relevant to industrialization. They ended by standing on each other’s backs to represent the finished system.&lt;ref name="Deak_36"/&gt; It was very abstract and humorous yet imbued with meaning.

Blue Blouse was an important theatre movement and political tool in the Soviet Union. Critics of Blue Blouse thought it was theatre for the workers but not by the workers or wasn’t educational because it was so entertaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Mally|2000|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall though, it was influential and received a positive response, becoming extremely popular, very fast, due to its relevancy and ability to be entertaining. Due to Blue Blouse serving as political propaganda for the Soviet Union, it serves as a way of looking at the Soviet agenda and influence through theatre.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2456">The '''Cabaret Cornichon''' (Gherkin cabaret) was a Swiss cabaret company.

It existed from 1934 to 1951 and was founded by Otto Weissert, [[Walter Lesch]], [[Emil Hegetschweiler]] and [[Alois Carigiet]].  They were later joined by, among others, Max Werner Lenz, [[Elsie Attenhofer]], Voli Geiler, [[Margrit Rainer]], [[Ruedi Walter]], [[Heinrich Gretler]], [[Zarli Carigiet]], Karl Meier and [[Alfred Rasser]]. The musical director was the pianist, [[Nico Kaufmann]]. From autumn 1950 to spring of 1951, [[Margrit Läubli]] appeared in the last programs of Cabaret Cornichon.

The Cabaret Cornichon was essentially an entertainment cabaret but, inspired by the ideals of what later became known as 'Geistige Landesverteidigung' ('national' [[spiritual defence]]), it also opposed [[fascism]] and [[Nazism]]. The term "Geistige Landesverteidigung" refers to the strong and widespread political will of the Swiss to defend the country’s independence and democratic constitution against the Nazis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://history-switzerland.geschichte-schweiz.ch/spiritual-defense-world-war-ii.html | title = Spiritual Defense against Nazism 1933–1945 | accessdate = 2010-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.hls-dhs-dss.ch/textes/d/D17426.php | title = Dictionnaire historique de la Suisse | accessdate = 2010-11-11 | language = French, German, Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cabaret was established in opposition to the right-wing organization known as the ‘Frontenbewegung’, whose views mirrored those of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist Party]] in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = Die widerspenstige Patriotin | journal = Die Weltwoche | date = 2010-10-14 | first = Daniele | last = Muscionico |author2=Arifé Aksoy | issue = 41 | pages = 56–57| id = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the [[Second World War]], the cabaret split up amid the political tensions of the [[Cold War]].  While some of its members sided with the political left, those in opposition founded the Cabaret Fédéral in 1949.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4037">[[File:The Eden Musee.jpg|thumb|right|Eden Musée]]
The '''Eden Musée''' was an amusement center in [[New York City]] that featured a large [[Wax museum|waxworks]] collection, musical concerts and a changing selection of specialty entertainment, such as [[magic lantern]] shows and [[marionettes]].  It was opened on March 28, 1884.  It featured a collection of paintings and became an early exhibitor of [[motion pictures]].  Located on 55 West 23rd Street in [[Manhattan]] in an imposing stone building.  The building featured several halls with different themes.  It was particularly known for its Chamber of Horrors, which was kept in the museum basement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stulman Dennett|first1=Andrea|title=Weird and Wonderful: The Dime Museum in America|publisher=NYU Press|isbn=978-0814718865|page=50|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NUCExzuXyV4C&amp;pg=PA172&amp;dq=eden+musee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rrTeU_uhDdGGigLKjoDADw&amp;ved=0CCEQuwUwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=eden%20musee&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Film Exhibition ==
On December 18, 1896, the [[Auguste and Louis Lumière|Lumiere]] [[cinematographe]] films were presented for two months in the Winter Garden, which had a 2000-seat capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Musser|first1=Charles|title=Before the Nickelodeon: Edwin S.

It became the first venue in the United States to make motion pictures a standard part of programming until it closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Abel|first1=Richard|title=Encyclopedia of Early Cinema|date=February 22, 2010|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415778565|page=187|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hFxwX-dM008C&amp;pg=PA187&amp;dq=eden+musee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6J7iU8KXHYH7oASiyILIDg&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAzgK#v=onepage&amp;q=eden%20musee&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1897, film pioneer [[Edwin S. Porter]], an electrician by training, assisted in the building of a custom film projector, to replace one destroyed by fire. In 1887 he returned with a job programming short films for exhibition, after the Eden Musee became Thomas Edison's first motion picture licensee. On February 1, 1898 the Eden Musee released its first self-produced film, The Passion Play of Oberammergau. This was billed as film actually shot in Oberammergau, Germany, when it was actually shot on the roof of the original [[Grand Central Palace]] in New York City, a fact that was quickly uncovered by the press. The presentation included 19 minutes of film interspersed with [[lantern slides]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ramsaye|first1=Terry|title=A Million and One Nights: A History of the Motion Picture|date=May 1986|publisher=Touchstone Books|isbn=978-0671624040|page=373|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaDD7RlLbEsC&amp;pg=PA373&amp;dq=eden+musee&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=6J7iU8KXHYH7oASiyILIDg&amp;ved=0CB8Q6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=eden%20musee&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
After the Eden Musee went bankrupt and closed in 1915, the name and select wax figure groupings, including those from the Chamber of Horrors, were purchased at auction and exhibited in [[Coney Island]]. The Coney Island Eden Musee was destroyed by fire in 1928.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Immerso|first1=Michael|title=Coney Island: The People's Playground|date=October 21, 2002|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=978-0813531380|page=135|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4POVzmwY9cC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=coney+island+eden+musee+fire&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rb-1-emr5o&amp;sig=4Uw_TjT6d73injbdgineRBt0W6s&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=rp3iU_ieKo3_oQT5o4HQDw&amp;ved=0CCIQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=coney%20island%20eden%20musee%20fire&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Evolutions Television''', commonly known as '''Evolutions''' (or more simply '''Evos'''), is a television [[post-production]] company in London, England. It has three sites across [[Soho]]: Great Pulteney Street, Sheraton Street, and a design facility on Wells Street called Earth. Evolutions has been used for programmes including ''[[The Apprentice (UK TV series)|The Apprentice]]'', ''[[The F Word (TV series)|The F Word]]'', and ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''. The company won the 2007 ''[[Broadcast (magazine)|Broadcast]]'' Award for Post House of the Year,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/technology/evolutions-to-launch-commercials-studio/5007435.article&lt;/ref&gt; and in 2010, it was ranked ninth on ''Televisual'' magazine's "Facilities 50" list.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.televisual.com/read-reports-surveys/5/44/Facilities-1-10.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Evolutions had a building in [[Soho Square]] that it vacated in 2011, around the same time that its senior management team bought out Albion Ventures' stake in the company.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.evolutions.tv/news/kanjee-leads-evolutions-management-buyout&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Federal Theatre Project''' ('''FTP'''; 1935–39) was a [[New Deal]] program to fund [[theatre]] and other live artistic performances and entertainment programs in the [[United States]] during the [[Great Depression in the United States|Great Depression]]. It was one of five [[Federal Project Number One]] projects sponsored by the [[Works Progress Administration]]. It was created not as a cultural activity but as a relief measure to employ artists, writers, directors and theater workers. It was shaped by national director [[Hallie Flanagan]] into a federation of regional theatres that created relevant art, encouraged experimentation in new forms and techniques, and made it possible for millions of Americans to see live theatre for the first time. The Federal Theatre Project ended when its funding was canceled after strong Congressional objections to the left-wing political tone of a small percentage of its productions.

Part of the Works Progress Administration, the Federal Theatre Project was a New Deal program established August 27, 1935,&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|29}} funded under the [[Emergency Relief Appropriation Act of 1935]]. Of the [[United States Dollar|$]]4.88 billion allocated to the WPA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.presidency.ucsb.edu/ws/?pid=14926 |title=Letter on Allocation of Work Relief Funds |last=Roosevelt |first=Franklin D.  |authorlink=Franklin Delano Roosevelt |date=August 26, 1935 |website=The American Presidency Project |publisher=Online by Gerhard Peters and John T. Woolley |access-date=2015-03-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; $27 million was approved for the employment of [[Federal Art Project|artists]], [[Federal Music Project|musicians]], [[Federal Writers' Project|writers]] and actors under the WPA's [[Federal Project Number One]].&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|44}}

Government relief efforts through the [[Federal Emergency Relief Administration]] and [[Civil Works Administration]] in the two preceding years were amateur experiments regarded as charity, not a theatre program. The Federal Theatre Project was a new approach to unemployment in the theatre profession. Only those certified as employable could be offered work, and that work was to be within the individual's defined skills and trades.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|15–16}}

"For the first time in the relief experiments of this country the preservation of the skill of the worker, and hence the preservation of his self-respect, became important," wrote [[Hallie Flanagan]], director of the Federal Theatre Project.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|17}} A theater professor at [[Vassar College]] who had studied the operation of government-sponsored theatre abroad for the [[John Simon Guggenheim Memorial Foundation|Guggenheim Foundation]],&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|9}} Flanagan was chosen to head the Federal Theatre Project by WPA head [[Harry Hopkins]],&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|20}} a former classmate at Grinnell College.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|7}} Roosevelt and Hopkins selected her despite considerable pressure to choose someone from the commercial theatre; they believed the project should be led by someone with academic credentials and a national perspective.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;{{Rp|39}}

Flanagan was given the daunting task of building a nationwide theater program to employ thousands of unemployed artists in as little time as possible. The problems of the theatre preceded the financial collapse of 1929. By that time it was already threatened with extinction due to the growing popularity of films and radio, but the commercial theatre was reluctant to adapt its practices.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;{{Rp|38}} Many actors, technicians and stagehands had suffered since [[1914 in film|1914]], when movies began to replace [[Repertory theatre|stock]], [[vaudeville]] and other live stage performances nationwide. [[Sound film#Triumph of the "talkies"|Sound motion pictures]] displaced 30,000 musicians. In the [[Great Depression]], people who had no money for entertainment found an entire evening of entertainment at the movies for 25 cents, while commercial theatre charged $1.10 to $2.20 admission to cover the cost of theater rental, advertising and fees to performers and union technicians. Unemployed directors, actors, designers, musicians and stagecrew took any kind of work they were able to find, whatever it paid, and charity was often their only recourse.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|13–14}}

"This is a tough job we're asking you to do," Hopkins told Flanagan at their first meeting in May 1935. "I don't know why I still hang on to the idea that unemployed actors get just as hungry as anybody else."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|7–9}}

Hopkins promised "a free, adult, uncensored theatre"&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|28}} — something Flanagan spent the next four years trying to build.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|29}} She emphasized the development of local and regional theatre, "to lay the foundation for the development of a truly creative theatre in the United States with outstanding producing centers in each of those regions which have common interests as a result of geography, language origins, history, tradition, custom, occupations of the people."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|22–23}}

==Operation==
On October 24, 1935, Flanagan prefaced her instructions on the Federal Theatre's operation with a statement of purpose:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The primary aim of the Federal Theatre Project is the reemployment of theatre workers now on public relief rolls: actors, directors, playwrights, designers, vaudeville artists, stage technicians, and other workers in the theatre field. The far reaching purpose is the establishment of theatres so vital to community life that they will continue to function after the program of this Federal Project is completed.&lt;ref name="Instructions"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://memory.loc.gov/cgi-bin/ampage?collId=ftscript&amp;fileName=farbf/00010002/ftscript.db&amp;recNum=2 |title=Instructions for Federal Theatre Projects of the Works Progress Administration |last=Flanagan |first=Hallie |date=October 24, 1935 |website=New Deal Stage |publisher=Library of Congress |access-date=2015-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Within a year the Federal Theatre Project employed 15,000 men and women,&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"/&gt;{{Rp|174}} paying them $23.86 a week.&lt;ref name="NYT New Deal doc"&gt;{{cite news |last=Dunning |first=Jennifer  |authorlink=Jennifer Dunning |date=July 5, 1981 |title='New Deal' Artists Star in a TV Documentary |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/07/05/arts/new-deal-artists-star-in-a-tv-documentary.html |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |location= |access-date=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; During its nearly four years of existence it played to 30 million people in more than 200 theaters nationwide&lt;ref name="Houseman RT"&gt;{{cite book |last=Houseman |first=John |authorlink=John Houseman |title=Run-Through: A Memoir |publisher=[[Simon &amp; Schuster]] |location=New York |date=1972 |isbn=0-671-21034-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|174}} — renting many that had been shuttered — as well as parks, schools, churches, clubs, factories, hospitals and closed-off streets.&lt;ref name="Ross"/&gt;{{Rp|40}} Its productions totalled approximately 1,200, not including its radio programs.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|432}} Because the Federal Theatre was created to employ and train people, not to generate revenue, no provision was made for the receipt of money when the project began. At its conclusion, 65 percent of its productions were still presented free of charge.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434}} The total cost of the Federal Theatre Project was $46 million.&lt;ref name="Ross"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ross|first=Ronald|date=January 1974|title=The Role of Blacks in the Federal Theatre, 1935–1939|url=|journal=The Journal of Negro History|publisher=|volume=59|issue=1|pages=38–50|jstor=2717139}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|40}}

"In any consideration of the cost of the Federal Theatre," Flanagan wrote, "it should be borne in mind that the funds were allotted, according to the terms of the Relief Act of 1935, to pay wages to unemployed people. Therefore, when Federal Theatre was criticized for spending money, it was criticized for doing what it was set up to do."&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|34–35}}

The Federal Theatre Project established five regional centers in [[New York, New York]], [[Boston]] (Northeast), [[Chicago]] (Midwest), [[Los Angeles]] (West), and [[New Orleans]] (South).&lt;ref&gt;[https://drum.lib.umd.edu/bitstream/handle/1903/6858/umi-umd-4347.pdf?sequence=1&amp;isAllowed=y UMD ]- Retrieved 2018-05-02&lt;/ref&gt; The FTP did not operate in every state, since many lacked a sufficient number of unemployed people in the theatre profession.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434}} The project in Alabama was closed in January 1937 when its personnel were transferred to a new unit in Georgia. Only one event was presented in Arkansas. Units created in Minnesota, Missouri and Wisconsin were closed in 1936; projects in Indiana, Nebraska, Rhode Island and Texas were discontinued in 1937; and the Iowa project was closed in 1938.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434–436}}

Many of the notable artists of the time participated in the Federal Theatre Project, including [[Susan Glaspell]] who served as Midwest bureau director.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|266}} The legacy of the Federal Theatre Project can also be found in beginning the careers of a new generation of theater artists. [[Arthur Miller]], [[Orson Welles]], [[John Houseman]], [[Martin Ritt]], [[Elia Kazan]], [[Joseph Losey]], [[Marc Blitzstein]] and [[Abe Feder]] are among those who became established, in part, through their work in the Federal Theatre.  Blitzstein, Houseman, Welles and Feder collaborated on the controversial production, ''[[The Cradle Will Rock]]''.

The Federal Theatre Project was the most costly of the Federal One projects, consuming 29.1 percent of Federal One's budget, which was itself less than three-fourths of one percent of the total WPA budget.

On June 30, 1939, the Federal Theatre Project ended when its funding was canceled, largely due to strong Congressional objections to the overtly left-wing political tones of less than 10 percent of the Federal Theatre Project productions.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|361–363}}

==Living Newspaper==
{{main|Living Newspaper}}
[[Living Newspaper]]s were plays written by teams of researchers-turned-playwrights. These men and women clipped articles from newspapers about current events, often hot button issues like [[farm]] policy, [[syphilis]] testing, the [[Tennessee Valley Authority]], and housing inequity. These newspaper clippings were adapted into plays intended to inform audiences, often with [[progressivism|progressive]] or left-wing themes. ''Triple-A Plowed Under'', for instance, attacked the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]] for killing an aid agency for farmers.  These politically themed plays quickly drew criticism from members of [[United States Congress|Congress]].

Although the undisguised political invective in the Living Newspapers sparked controversy, they also proved popular with audiences.  As an art form, the Living Newspaper is perhaps the Federal Theatre's most well-known work.

Problems with the Federal Theatre Project and Congress intensified when the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] objected to the first Living Newspaper, ''Ethiopia'', about [[Haile Selassie]] and his nation's struggles against [[Benito Mussolini]]'s [[Second Italo-Ethiopian War|invading Italian forces]]. The U.S. government soon mandated that the Federal Theatre Project, a government agency, could not depict foreign heads of state on the stage for fear of diplomatic backlash. Playwright and director [[Elmer Rice]], head of the New York office of the FTP, resigned in protest and was succeeded by his assistant, Philip W. Barber.

The Negro Theatre Unit was part of the Federal Theatre Project and had units that were set up in cities throughout the United States. The units were located in four different geographical regions of the country. In the West, units were located in Seattle, Washington, and Los Angeles, California. In the East, units were located in New York City, New York, Boston, Massachusetts, Hartford, Connecticut, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and Newark, New Jersey. In the South, there were units in Raleigh, North Carolina, Durham, North Carolina, and Birmingham, Alabama. In the Midwest, units were located in Chicago, Illinois, Peoria, Illinois, and Cleveland, Ohio. The project provided employment and apprenticeships to black playwrights, directors, actors, and technicians. The project offered a much needed source of assistance for African-American theatre from 1935 to 1939. The project's inspiring purposes further influenced the founding within a year of the [[American Negro Theater]], 1940 – 1949.

The Negro Theatre Unit of New York City was the best known. It was headquartered at the [[Lafayette Theatre (Harlem)|Lafayette Theatre]] in Harlem, where some 30 plays were presented. The first was [[Frank H. Wilson]]'s folk drama, ''Walk Together Chillun'' (1936), about the deportation of 100 African-Americans from the South to the North to work for low wages. The second was ''Conjur' Man Dies'' (1936), a comedy-mystery adapted by [[Arna Bontemps]] and [[Countee Cullen]] from [[Rudolph Fisher]]'s novel. The most popular production was the third, which came to be called the ''[[Voodoo Macbeth]]'' (1936), director [[Orson Welles]]'s adaptation of Shakespeare's play set on a mythical island suggesting the Haitian court of King [[Henri Christophe]].&lt;ref name="A to Z"&gt;{{cite book |last=Hill |first=Anthony D.  |date=2009 |title=The A to Z of African American Theater|url= |location=Lanham |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield Publishing Group |isbn=9780810870611}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|179–180}}

==Radio==
The Federal Theatre of the Air began weekly broadcasts March 15, 1936. For three years the radio division of the Federal Theatre Project presented an average of 3,000 programs annually on commercial stations and the NBC, Mutual and CBS networks. The major programs originated in New York; radio divisions were also created in 11 states.&lt;ref name="Arena"&gt;{{cite book |last=Flanagan |first=Hallie  |authorlink=Hallie Flanagan |date=1965 |title=Arena: The History of the Federal Theatre |url= |location=New York |publisher=Benjamin Blom, reprint edition [1940] |oclc=855945294}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|267–268, 397}}

Series included ''Professional Parade'', hosted by [[Fred Niblo]]; ''Experiments in Symphonic Drama'', original stories written for classical music; ''Gilbert and Sullivan Light Opera'', the complete works performed by Federal Theatre actors and recordings by [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company|D'Oyly Carte]]; ''Ibsen's Plays'', performances of 12 major plays; ''Repertory Theatre of the Air'', presenting literary classics; ''Contemporary Theatre'', presenting plays by modern authors; and the interview program, ''Exploring the Arts and Sciences''.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|268}}

The radio division presented a wide range of programs on health and safety, art, music and history. The American Legion sponsored [[James Truslow Adams]]'s ''Epic of America''. The children's program, ''Once Upon a Time'', and [[Paul de Kruif]]'s ''Men Against Death'' were both honored by the National Committee for Education by Radio. In March 1939, at the invitation of the BBC, Flanagan broadcast the story of the Federal Theatre Project to Britain. Asked to expand the program to encompass the entire WPA, the radio division produced ''No Help Wanted'', a dramatization by [[William N. Robson]] with music by [[Leith Stevens]]. ''[[The Times]]'' called it "the best broadcast ever sent us from the Americas".&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|268–269}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://radiogoldindex.com/cgi-local/p2.cgi?ProgramName=No%20Help%20Wanted |title=No Help Wanted  |publisher=RadioGOLDINdex |accessdate=2015-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Productions criticized by Congress==
A total of 81 of the Federal Theatre Project's 830 major titles were criticized by members of Congress for their content in public statements, committee hearings, on the floor of the Senate or House, or in testimony before Congressional committees. Only 29 were original productions of the Federal Theatre Project. The others included 32 revivals or stock productions; seven plays that were initiated by community groups; five that were never produced by the project; two works of Americana; two classics; one children's play; one Italian translation; and one Yiddish play.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|432–433}}

The Living Newspapers that drew criticism were ''Injunction Granted'', a history of American labor relations; ''[[One-Third of a Nation]]'', about housing conditions in New York; ''Power'',&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}} about energy from the consumer's point of view;&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|184–185}} and ''Triple A Plowed Under'', on farming problems in America.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}} Another that was criticized, on the history of medicine, was not completed.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|434}}

Dramas criticized by Congress were ''American Holiday'', about a small-town murder trial; ''Around the Corner'', a Depression-era comedy; ''Chalk Dust'', about an urban high school; ''Class of '29'', the Depression years as seen through young college graduates; ''Created Equal'', a review of American life since colonial times; ''[[It Can't Happen Here]]'', [[Sinclair Lewis]]'s parable of democracy and dictatorship; ''No More Peace'', [[Ernst Toller]]'s satire on dictatorships; ''Professor Mamlock'', about Nazi persecution of Jews; ''Prologue to Glory'', about the early life of Abraham Lincoln; ''The Sun and I'', about [[Joseph (patriarch)|Joseph]] in Egypt; and ''Woman of Destiny'', about a female President who works for peace.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Negro Theatre Unit productions that drew criticism were ''The Case of Philip Lawrence'', a portrait of life in Harlem; ''Did Adam Sin?'', a review of black folklore with music; and ''Haiti'', a play about [[Toussaint Louverture]].&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Also criticized for their content were the dance dramas ''Candide'', from Voltaire; ''How Long Brethren'', featuring songs by future [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] recipient [[Lawrence Gellert]]; and ''Trojan Incident'', a translation of Euripides with a prologue from Homer.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

''Help Yourself'', a satire on high-pressure business tactics, was among the comedies criticized by Congress. Others were ''Machine Age'', about mass production; ''On the Rocks'' by [[George Bernard Shaw]]; and ''The Tailor Becomes a Storekeeper''.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

Children's plays singled out were ''Mother Goose Goes to Town'', and ''[[Revolt of the Beavers]]'', which the ''[[New York Journal-American|New York American]]'' called a "pleasing fantasy for children".&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

The musical ''Sing for Your Supper'' also met with Congressional criticism, although its patriotic finale, "[[Ballad for Americans]]", was chosen as the theme song of the 1940 Republican National Convention.&lt;ref name="Arena"/&gt;{{Rp|433}}

==Cultural references==

"'''Future Legend'''" is the opening track of [[David Bowie]]'s 1974 album ''[[Diamond Dogs]]''. Its spoken narrative introduces the album's setting in a "glitter apocalypse".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carr|first=Roy|authorlink=Roy Carr|author2=Murray, Charles Shaar |authorlink2=Charles Shaar Murray  |year=1981|title=Bowie: An Illustrated Record|publisher=Avon|isbn=0-380-77966-8|page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music and lyrics==
Barely a minute in length, "Future Legend" begins with a distorted howl and features Bowie's spoken-word vision of a post-apocalyptic [[Manhattan]], now renamed Hunger City. He describes "fleas the size of rats" and "rats the size of cats", and compares the humanoid inhabitants to "packs of dogs". 

Halfway through the narration, the [[Richard Rodgers]]' tune "[[Bewitched, Bothered and Bewildered]]" strikes up (the song and its composer appear on the track list of the original vinyl album but this credit is omitted on CD releases). "Future Legend" then morphs into the album's [[Diamond Dogs (song)|title track]], with the cry "This Ain't Rock and Roll, This Is Genocide!".

The narrative has been compared to the writings of [[William S. Burroughs|William Burroughs]], particularly such phrases as "a baying pack of people" in ''[[Naked Lunch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Buckley|first=David|year=1999|title=Strange Fascination: David Bowie - The Definitive Story|publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=0-7535-0457-X|page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other uses==
A backing tape of the track was played as the lead-in to "Diamond Dogs" at some performances on Bowie's North American tour in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pegg|first=Nicholas|title=The Complete David Bowie|year=2000|isbn=1-903111-73-0|page=80|publisher=Reynolds &amp; Hearn Ltd}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Inna Naumovna Solomonik''' (7 August 1932, [[Moscow]] – 14 July 2009, Moscow) was a Soviet and Russian specialist on [[puppet theatre]]. She graduated from the [[Moscow State Linguistic University|Moscow State Pedagogical Institute of Foreign Languages]] in 1973 (first degree, diploma of French teacher) and got her PhD at the [[Institute of Oriental Studies of the Russian Academy of Sciences|Institute of Oriental Studies]] under the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] (Moscow) in 1981 (thesis: Javanese [[Wayang Purwa]] performance as a [[semiotic]] system under the supervision of Dr. Vladimir I. Braginsky).&lt;ref&gt;Ревуненкова Е.В. Инна Наумовна Соломоник (7.08.1932 — 14.07.2009) и театр кукол Востока // Австралия, Океания и Индонезия в пространстве времени и истории.

Inna Solomonik has been studying the history of the puppet theatre for over 40 years. From 1961 till 1991 she was a research fellow with the Museum of Puppets under the State Academic Central Puppet Theatre led by [[Sergey Obraztsov]]. She began her research career by investigating folk puppet shows in [[pre-revolutionary Russia]], then in [[Europe]] and the [[Americas]]&lt;ref&gt;Solomonik, Inna Naumovna // Victor Pogadaev. Wajah-wajah sarjana pengajian Melayu Rusia. Kuala Lumpur: DBP, 2015, hlm. 140&lt;/ref&gt;.. By the late 1960s she prepared some volume of documents, descriptions, and so on (about 3000 typed pages) on the history of the Russian folk puppet theatre. In 1993 a small part of this work was printed in the book ''Puppets come in the stage''. Beginning in the mid-1970s, Inna Solomonik turned to studies of oriental puppet performances. In 1980 she was ready with her PhD thesis. The kernel of this research was a semiotic analysis of the silhouettes of Wayang Purwa figures. Later Inna Solomonik continued to study the Asian puppet theatre, and published two monographs on the subject (1983, 1992). In 2001 she published the book-album on Javanese [[Wayang Beber]]. She was an active member of the [[Nusantara Society]].

'''Jazz piano''' is a collective term for the techniques pianists use when playing [[jazz]]. The piano has been an integral part of the jazz idiom since its inception, in both solo and ensemble settings. Its role is multifaceted due largely to the instrument's combined melodic and harmonic capabilities. For this reason it is an important tool of jazz musicians and composers for teaching and learning jazz theory and set arrangement, regardless of their main instrument. (By extension the phrase 'jazz piano' can refer to similar techniques on any keyboard instrument.)

Along with the [[jazz guitar|guitar]], [[vibraphone]], and other keyboard instruments, the piano is one of the instruments in a jazz combo that can play both single notes and [[chord (music)|chord]]s rather than only single notes as does the [[saxophone]] or [[trumpet]].

==Beginning==
A new style known as “stride” or “Harlem stride” emerged during the 1920s, predominantly in New York. [[James P. Johnson]] was a prominent adherent. The left hand was used to establish rhythm while the right hand improvised melodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Jazz Piano Roots: A Short History of Early Jazz Piano - Part I|last=Lees|first=Gene|publisher=|year=2006|isbn=|location=Katonah, NY|pages=Pg. 24|quote=|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
===Learning jazz piano===

[[File:Bill Evans.jpg|thumb|right|200px| [[Bill Evans]] performing at the Montreux Jazz Festival.]]
Mastering the various chord voicings—simple to advanced—is the first building block of learning jazz piano.  Jazz piano technique uses all the chords found in Western art music, such as major, minor, augmented, diminished, seventh, diminished seventh, sixth, minor seventh, major seventh, suspended fourth, and so on.  A second key skill is learning to play with a [[swing (jazz performance style)|swing]] rhythm and "feel". In jazz, the roots are usually omitted from keyboard voicings, as this task is left to the [[double bass]] player. Jazz pianists also make extensive use of chord "extensions", such as adding the ninth, eleventh or thirteenth scale degree to the chord. In some cases, these extensions may be "altered" i.e. sharpened or flattened, as in the case of a "sharp 11" chord.

The next step is learning to improvise melodic lines using scales and chord tones. This ability is perfected after long experience, including much practice, which internalizes the physical skills of playing and the technical elements of harmony, and it requires a great natural 'ear' for extemporaneous music-making. When jazz pianists [[improvisation|improvise]], they use the scales, modes, and arpeggios associated with the chords in a tune's chord progression. The approach to improvising has changed since the earliest eras of jazz piano. During the Swing era, many soloists improvised "by ear" by embellishing the melody with ornaments and passing notes. However, during the bebop era, the rapid tempo and complicated chord progressions made it increasingly harder to play "by ear." Along with other improvisers, such as saxes and guitar players, bebop-era jazz pianists began to improvise over the chord changes using scales (whole tone scale, chromatic scale, etc.) and arpeggios.&lt;ref&gt;''Jazzology: The Encyclopedia of Jazz Theory for All Musicians'', by Robert Rawlins, Nor Eddine Bahha, Barrett Tagliarino. Hal Leonard Corporation, 2005 {{ISBN|0-634-08678-2}}, {{ISBN|978-0-634-08678-6}}. Page 141&lt;/ref&gt;

===Styles===
Jazz piano (the technique) and the instrument itself offer soloists an exhaustive number of choices. One may play the bass register in an [[ostinato]] pattern, popular in  [[boogie-woogie]] style, where the left hand repeats a phrase numerous times throughout a song, as performed by Rob Agerbeek in "Boogie Woogie Stomp." The left hand can also be played as a melodic counterline that emulates the walking of an [[upright bass]]. In [[stride piano]], (similar to the earlier [[ragtime]]) the left hand rapidly plays alternate positions between notes in the bass register and chords in the tenor register, while the right hand plays melody and improvises, as performed in George Gershwin's "Liza".  The right hand may play melodic lines, or harmonic content, chordally or in octaves. It may also be played in lockstep with the left hand, using a double melody [[block chord]] called "locked-hand" [[voicing (music)|voicing]], or [[Shearing voicing]]—a technique popularized, though not invented, by the pianist and set leader [[George Shearing]].

===Ensemble role===
[[File:ODJBcard.JPG|thumb|right|200px|The Original Dixieland Jazz Band, with Henry Ragas on piano.]]
Jazz piano has played a leading role in developing the sound of jazz.  Early on, black jazz musicians created [[ragtime]] on the piano.  As the genre progressed the piano was usually featured in the rhythm section of a band, which was typically configured as one or more of piano, guitar, bass, or drums, or other instruments, such as the vibraphone.

Over time, playing piano-accompaniment in ensemble sets, and then bands, changed from primarily time-keeping (consisting of repetitive left-hand figures) to a more flexible role. Ultimately, the skilled pianist was free both to lead and to answer the instrumental soloist, using both short and sustained, chordal and melodic, fragments—a technique known as '[[comping]]'. Good comping musicians were capable of many and different chord voicings, so to match the various moods the different soloists were aiming for. In the early days not all leading pianists were concerned to provide comping. Others—notably [[Duke Ellington]], who became famous during the [[Harlem Renaissance]] at the [[Cotton Club]]—earned great esteem among band members as well as other musicians. Ellington comped enthusiastically in support of the soloist and did much to develop the technique.

Jazz piano moved away from playing lead melody to providing foundation for song sets; soon, skilled jazz pianists were performing as soloists. In the 1940s and 1950s, a number of great piano players emerged. Pianists like [[Thelonious Monk]] and [[Bud Powell]] helped create and establish the sound of [[bebop]]. [[Bill Evans]] built upon the style of Bud Powell while adding a distinct classical influence to his playing while [[Oscar Peterson]] pushed rhythmic variations and was influenced by the style of [[Art Tatum]], [[Teddy Wilson]] and [[Nat King Cole]]. [[Wynton Kelly]], [[Red Garland]], [[Herbie Hancock]], and [[Keith Jarrett]] were also exceptional pianists who played with [[Miles Davis]].  [[Tommy Flanagan]] was featured by [[John Coltrane]] on his hit album ''[[Giant Steps]]''. [[McCoy Tyner]] is also an influential player who played with Coltrane.

[[Image:3 point lighting.svg|thumb|A typical three-point setup with a shoulder or back-side lamp to create contrast between the background and center object so as to give a three-dimensional appearance]]
The '''key light''' is the first and usually most important light that a [[photographer]], [[cinematographer]], lighting cameraman, or other scene composer will use in a lighting setup. The purpose of the key light is to highlight the form and dimension of the subject. The key light is not a rigid requirement; omitting the key light can result in a [[silhouette]] effect. Many key lights may be placed in a scene to illuminate a moving subject at opportune moments.

==Position of camera==
The key light can be "hard" (focused) or "soft" (diffused), and depending on the desired setup can be placed at different angles relative to the subject. When part of the most common setup—[[three-point lighting]]—the key light is placed at a 30–60° angle (with the [[camera]] marking 0 degrees). In addition to the horizontal angle, the key light can be placed high or low producing different effects. The most common vertical position for the key light is at a 30° angle (i.e. slightly above the eye line; the nose should not cast a shadow on the lips).

A key light positioned low appears to distort the actor's features, since most natural or [[Available light|ambient light]] is normally overhead. A dramatic effect used in horror or comedy [[cinematography]] is a key light illuminating the face from below. A high key light will result in more prominent cheek bones and long nose shadows. [[Marlene Dietrich]] was famous for insisting that her key light be placed high.

==Lighting a scene==
Using just a key light results in a high-contrast scene, especially if the background is not illuminated. A [[fill light]] decreases contrast and adds more details to the dark areas of an image. An alternative to the fill light is to reflect existing light or to illuminate other objects in the scene (which in turn further illuminate the subject).

In addition to a key light, a [[back light]] may be added to "separate" the subject from the background. When the subject and/or camera are moving or turning around, the key light and back light may change roles.

The key light does not have to directly illuminate the subject: it may pass through various filters, screens, or reflectors. Light passing through tree leaves, window panes, and other obstacles can make a scene more visually interesting, as well as cue the audience to the location of the subject. The key light also does not have to be white light—a colored key (especially when used with fill/back lighting of other colors) can add more emotional depth to a scene than full white alone. In mixed indoor/outdoor daytime scenes, sunlight may appear to be a "warm" white, and indoor lighting to be a "neutral" or artificially-toned white. By contrast, moonlight appears to be "cooler" than indoor lighting.

==Lighting choices==
In many cases, the key light is a [[stage light]] for indoor scenes, or [[sunlight]] for outdoors. A lighting instrument may also be used outdoors to supplement sunlight or as the primary light source with sunlight or skylight serving as fill lighting. Actual [[Lamp (electrical component)|lamps]], lighting fixtures, can serve as key lights, provided they are of sufficient brightness. They may also appear within the scene as props&amp;nbsp;— in which case they are called "practicals." Similarly, [[fire]], candles and other natural sources of light can be used

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7796">A '''liminal deity''' is a god or goddess in [[mythology]] who presides over thresholds, gates, or doorways; "a crosser of boundaries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=THE GREEK PANTHEON: HERMES|url=http://faculty.unlv.edu/jmstitt/Eng426B/hermes.html|work=English Mythology Class Notes|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a technical note, dying-and-rising and vegetation gods and deities who descend into the underworld could be seen as specific types of liminal deities. They by their very nature must cross the boundary of life and death, probably the most important boundary there is, to be classified as such. Vegetation gods in particular must die and revive every year to mimic the dying and returning of plant life after winter, making them fairly permanent liminal deities. Dying-and-rising gods and those deities that descend into the underworld (typically to save a dead god and bring them back, thus hoping to make the deceased into a dying-and-rising god) are usually one-time ordeals, making these two categories "lesser types" of the liminal deity and the gods that take part in them temporary liminal deities.

==Etymology==
The word "liminal", first attested to in English in 1884, comes from the Latin word "limen", meaning "threshold".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harper|first=Douglas|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=liminal&amp;searchmode=none|work=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Liminality" is a term given currency in twentieth century anthropology by Victor Turner of the University of Chicago.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="166563">The following is a partial list of '''''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' commercial parodies'''. On ''Saturday Night Live'' (''SNL''), a [[parody advertisement]] is commonly shown after the host's opening monologue. Many of the parodies were produced by [[James Signorelli]]. [[Fast food]], [[beer]], [[feminine hygiene]] products, [[toy]]s, medications, financial institutions, and [[automobile]]s have been frequent targets.

The commercial parodies have even targeted the ''SNL'' producers. A self-parody commercial featured "The Best of the First 20 Minutes", a parody of [[Broadway Video]]'s [[List of Saturday Night Live compilation albums and videos|series of ''SNL'' compilation videos]]. It offered a compilation of bits from the [[Saturday Night Live season 24|Cameron Diaz/Smashing Pumpkins September 1998 episode]] before that episode had even finished.

In 1991, [[Kevin Nealon]] and [[Victoria Jackson]] hosted a [[clip show]] featuring many commercials entitled ''Saturday Night Live Goes Commercial''. In early 1999, [[Will Ferrell]] hosted a follow-up special. In late 2005 and in March 2009, the special was updated, featuring commercials created since the airing of the original special.

* ''16 and Pregnant'' Spinoffs — A November 2010 ad finds [[MTV]] cashing in with spinoffs inspired by ''[[16 and Pregnant]]'' and ''[[Teen Mom]]'', such as ''My Super Sweet 16 and Pregnant'', ''America's Best Pregnant Dance Crew'', ''Wild n Out with a Special Guest: A Baby'', an edition of ''Cribs'' that feature baby cribs, and ''I'm Snooki and Pregnant''.  At the end, the MTV logo comes on with MTV: Maternity Television.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/193064#s-p37-sr-i4  |title=Saturday Night Live 16 and Pregnant Spinoffs |accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In an odd case of satirical prophecy, Snooki announced to ''US Magazine'' in March 2012 that yes, she was pregnant and engaged.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/snooki-yes-im-pregnant-and-engaged-201273  |title=Cover Story: Snooki: Yes, I'm Pregnant and Engaged! |accessdate=5 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[1-800-Flowers]] — [[Kristen Wiig]] promotes the floral retailer as a way to show love for the mother ([[Kate McKinnon]]) who's always been there for her... even when Mom's at her most annoying.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=88TuOd6QNAA ''SNL'': "1-800-Flowers"] on YouTube (accessed 5/11/2018)&lt;/ref&gt;
* 24-Hour Energy for Dating Actresses — Having an actress for a girlfriend, and dealing with their quirks, can leave a man drained and exhausted.

The English word "[[pimples]]", however, is confused in the sketch with "pimplen", a strong German slang word with the same meaning as the English "[[fuck]]" (in the sexual sense). As a result, the commercial tagline ("mach das pimplen kaput") implies that Clearasil will destroy one's sex life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.toadstoolblog.com/2007/09/toads-summer-faves.html |title=Toads' Summer Faves  |accessdate=31 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charles Rocket]] demonstrates it, getting punched repeatedly by a number of boxing gloves, and slamming his hand with a mallet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/264052/saturday-night-live-tortu-matic |title=Saturday Night Live Tortu-Matic    |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Totino's]] [[Pizza Rolls]] - a series of commercials airing over three straight [[Super Bowl]] weekends in the mid-2010s focusing on a dutiful housewife ([[Vanessa Bayer]]) serving Pizza Rolls to "my hungry guys" watching the big game in the living room.
**The first ad, from 2015, promotes the "Totino's Super Bowl Activity Pack," featuring games and toys specifically made "for grown women ages 5 and up" (e.g. puzzles, play money, miniature top) that the wife can play to keep herself occupied in the kitchen while the hubby (episode host [[J. K. Simmons]]) and the guys watch the game.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A8WIBv3erj8 Totino's Super Bowl Commercial parody] (accessed 2/4/2015)&lt;/ref&gt;
**The second ad, from 2016, is a straight-up Pizza Rolls ad that takes a strange turn: The "hungry guys" (episode host [[Larry David]] among them) are reacting to the big game in unison.  But when the wife discovers that they're shouting at a blank TV screen and grabs a pair of scissors for self-defense, the guys turn around all at once, revealing icy stares with solid black eyes.  The end-of-ad twist: It's actually a promotion for the [[The X-Files (season 10)|recently revived]] TV series ''[[The X-Files]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3dzOLoOEToc Totino's ad parody] (accessed 2/7/2016)&lt;/ref&gt;
**The third ad, from 2017, gets really steamy: When a sister of one of the guys (played by episode host [[Kristen Stewart]]) comes into the kitchen to help, the wife finds herself attracted to the woman, and the two engage in torrid intercourse, using the Pizza Rolls on their bodies and speaking in French, thus giving real meaning when the husband asks if they're "making out" in the kitchen.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ew.com/tv/2017/02/05/snl-kristen-stewart-pizza-rolls-sketch/ Kristen Stewart, Vanessa Bayer flirt over pizza rolls in SNL sketch] from ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' (accessed 2/5/2017)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Tressant Suprème – [[Kelly Ripa]] spoofs the numerous hair coloring ads in which she has appeared. In this parody, Ripa prefers Tressant Suprème because it contains "just a ''little'' bit of [[crack cocaine]]", thus explaining her well-known "peppy" persona.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/2334/saturday-night-live-tressant-supreme |title=Saturday Night Live Tressant Supreme |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Triopenin — Airing during the first ''[[Weekend Update]]'', this ad promotes an [[arthritis]] medication in a bottle that's virtually impossible to open.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75atriopenin.phtml |title=Triopenin |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FirstWeekendUpdate/&gt;
* Triple Trac Razor – a razor with three blades because the consumer is gullible enough to believe what he sees on TV commercials (this was written in the years before razors had progressed past two blades).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75atriple.phtml |title=Triple-Trac  |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Turlington's Lower Back [[Tattoo]] Remover – a product that, "when applied once every hour for 72 straight hours", slowly burns away unwanted lower back tattoos. "That tingling means it's working!" Tagline: "Because it won't be cool forever".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/61336/saturday-night-live-turlingtons-lower-back-tattoo-remover |title=Saturday Night Live Turlington's Lower Back Tattoo Remover   |accessdate=26 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Tylenol (brand)|Tylenol]] [[Bowel Movement|B.M.]] – a [[laxative]] product shown to cause you to [[Defecation|defecate]] while you sleep.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/1597/saturday-night-live-tylenol-bm#s-p63-sr-i4 |title=Saturday Night Live Tylenol BM |accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Uncle Jemima's Pure Mash Liquor — With references to [[Uncle Remus]] in [[Walt Disney Feature Animation|Disney]]'s ''[[Song of the South]]'', this not not-so-subtle barb at products that perpetuate [[racial stereotype]]s finds [[Aunt Jemima]]'s husband ([[Tracy Morgan]]) promoting liquor that's "more fun than pancakes" thanks to its 95% alcohol content by volume ("That means you get f***** up for less money!").&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nbc.com/saturday-night-live/video/uncle-jemimas-pure-mash-liquor/n11301 ''SNL'': "Uncle Jemima's Pure Mash Liquor"] on NBC.com (accessed 5/18/2018)&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under Underground Rock Festival – A series of commercials which poke fun at the crazy promotions at alternative concerts, crazy special guests, as well as the extremes people will go to defy conformity.

* [[United Way of America|United Way]] with [[Peyton Manning]] – Manning (as himself) appears in this 2007 spoof of self-serving philanthropic public-service ads by popular athletes.  Documentary-style, Manning is shown "mentoring" children; what ensues is Manning physically and verbally abusing the kids during a football game (hitting kids in the back of the head with a football and sending one of them to sit in a Port-A-Let for messing up a play), and afterwards teaching his charges how to break into an SUV, exploiting a little girl to get a date with an attractive woman, showing kids a tabloid magazine featuring [[Angelina Jolie]], drinking beer in front of them, and admitting that he would kill anyone who snitches on him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/1603/saturday-night-live-snl-digital-short-united-way |title=Saturday Night Live SNL Digital Short United Way |accessdate=18 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* University of Westfield — An ad for an [[Distance education|online college]] that teaches students how to avoid discussing going to an online college. As one student (portrayed by [[Nasim Pedrad]]) states, Westfield taught her "that going to an Internet college is not a thing that would make people want to hire me."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I9yqbrHssQQ ''SNL'': University of Westfield] on YouTube (accessed 7/13/2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

* Uvula Public Service Spot – [[Chevy Chase]] as a physician urging [[Gilda Radner]] and the audience to take proper care of the [[uvula]], without ever saying what the uvula actually is. (It is a small piece of flesh that hangs down from the rear portion of the soft palate and requires little, if any, maintenance.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/75/75vuvula.phtml |title=Babs' Uvula

* [[Veritas Software|Veritas]] [[Ultrasound]] HD – Instead of a tiny monitor, the ultrasound is displayed on a widescreen HD television. It even has options to display a football helmet on the fetus (for dads-to-be missing a Sunday football because they're accompanying the wife to see the ultrasound).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://snltranscripts.jt.org/07/07bveritas.phtml |title=Veritas Ultrasound HD

Also featuring [[Chris Parnell]] as Wade's brother/associate and the human simulating bad canine behavior in the ad's dramatizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mC-LEQqNC1s ''SNL'': Wade Blasingame] on YouTube (accessed 6/14/2018)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Use mdy dates|date=September 2017}}
[[File:Marvel Studios New Logo And Fanfare July 2016.webm|thumbtime=30|thumb|right|alt=|Marvel Studios logo animation (2016-present), featuring the Marvel Studios fanfare by [[Michael Giacchino]] (0:37).]]
The '''music of the [[Marvel Cinematic Universe]]''' ('''MCU''') is the [[Film score|film and television scores]] composed by various composers for the [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films|films]] and [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series]] of that franchise. [[Ramin Djawadi]] provided the first MCU music with his original score for ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' in 2008. [[Alan Silvestri]] was the first composer to work on multiple MCU films after he transitioned from scoring ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' (2011) to ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]'' (2012), while [[Brian Tyler]] was the first composer to reference the work of another MCU composer when he quoted Silvestri's "Captain America March" in his score for ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' (2013). Silvestri has scored three MCU films, the most for any composer in the franchise, in addition to his contributions being referenced in multiple other films. 

Original music has also been composed for the [[Marvel One-Shots]] short film series, and other related projects of the MCU, including the fanfares for the two [[Marvel Studios]] logos, composed by Tyler and [[Michael Giacchino]], respectively. Additionally, original songs have been created specifically for use in the franchise, including "[[#"Make Way For Tomorrow, Today"|Make Way For Tomorrow, Today]]" by [[Richard M. Sherman]] and "[[#"Star Spangled Man"|Star Spangled Man]]" by [[Alan Menken]] and [[David Zippel]], both of which have been used in multiple MCU projects. The scores for every MCU film and television series have received album releases, and several compilation albums featuring existing songs used in the films have also been released.

Critical response to the MCU's music has been mixed, with focus placed on a lack of memorable, identifiable themes that are comparable to other large media franchises, and on the lack of continuity between works. Despite this, some critics have shown appreciation for the individual work of some of the more traditional composers like Silvestri, and for Tyler's efforts in attempting to establish a consistent tone for the franchise and some thematic continuity between his scores and Silvestri's work.

===''Iron Man''===
[[File:Ramin Djawadi.jpg|thumb|alt=Ramin Djawadi|upright|left|Ramin Djawadi is the composer of the first MCU film.]]
[[Ramin Djawadi]] had been a fan of the character [[Iron Man]] as a child, saying that he always liked superheroes "that actually don’t have any superpowers". After ''[[Iron Man (2008 film)|Iron Man]]'' director [[Jon Favreau]]'s previous collaborator [[John Debney]] was unavailable to score the film,&lt;ref name="DebneyIM1" /&gt; Djawadi sought out the role himself.&lt;ref name="DjawadiComicus" /&gt; Filming on ''Iron Man'' had already been completed by the time Djawadi joined the production,&lt;ref name="DjawadiDoG" /&gt; and rather than wait until he could see the completed film, as he usually would, Djawadi began "playing with ideas" as soon as he saw the first trailer.&lt;ref name="DjawadiComicus" /&gt; Due to time constraints and the final cut of the film changing until "the last possible minute", Djawadi had help with arrangements and additional cues from [[Hans Zimmer]] and [[Remote Control Productions]].&lt;ref name="DjawadiComicus" /&gt; [[Rage Against the Machine]] guitarist [[Tom Morello]], who makes a [[cameo appearance]] in the film, contributed guitar performances to the score.&lt;ref name="Morello" /&gt;

Favreau had a clear vision of [[heavy metal music]] and guitars for the project,&lt;ref name="DjawadiComicus" /&gt; saying that Tony Stark was more of a rock star than a traditional superhero, and "there’s ''[[Spider-Man in film|Spider-man]]'', ''[[Batman in film|Batman]]'' and all these superhero movies. This superhero movie’s different. I want to do something completely different, instead of going down the orchestral route. I want to do more rock and roll."&lt;ref name="DjawadiDoG" /&gt; Djawadi subsequently composed most of the film's score on guitar, before arranging it for orchestra. Djawadi composed several themes for the character of Tony Stark, representing his different moods and attitudes, all inspired by [[Robert Downey, Jr.]]'s performance. Other themes for the film are "not so much character based, but rather plot based that carry you through the movie".&lt;ref name="DjawadiComicus" /&gt; Musicians John O'Brien and [[Rick Boston]], frequent collaborators with Favreau, provided a [[big band]]-style [[arrangement]] of the Iron Man theme song from the 1966 cartoon ''[[The Marvel Super Heroes]]'' for a scene where Stark attends a casino.&lt;ref name="O'BrienBostonIM" /&gt;

===''The Incredible Hulk''===
Director [[Louis Leterrier]]'s first choice for composer on ''[[The Incredible Hulk (film)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' was [[Craig Armstrong (composer)|Craig Armstrong]], once the arranger for [[Massive Attack]], a band Leterrier was fond of and had collaborated with on the 2005 film ''[[Unleashed (film)|Unleashed]]''; this choice had surprised Marvel, who often had directors asking for the likes of [[John Williams]] or [[Danny Elfman]], and the studio was hesitant due to Armstrong's lack of experience writing for action films. Leterrier listened to Armstrong's previous music while planning and editing the film,&lt;ref name="MftMLeterrier" /&gt; and music editor [[Peter Myles]] used Armstrong's work and similar music by others in the film's [[temp track|temp score]]. Armstrong chose not to listen to the temp, or watch [[Ang Lee]]'s ''[[Hulk (2003 film)|Hulk]]'', before composing the score, which he begun in his home in [[Glasgow]], Scotland, before moving to Remote Control in Los Angeles to be closer to the production. The score was recorded in four days, resulting in little time for adjustments on the day, forcing Armstrong to "create very specific demos" that were "completely accurate" for Matt Dunkley to [[wikt:orchestrate|orchestrate]]. Leterrier favored an orchestral sound over electronics, "because he didn’t want the work to sound dated so quickly", though Armstrong did electronically enhance a lot of the orchestral recordings. Additionally, "about half the score" features various ethnic instruments performed by [[Pete Lockett]].&lt;ref name="MftMArmstrong" /&gt;

When Armstrong first began working in Glasgow, he did so with three sequences which he called "the keys to opening up" the score: the [[Abomination (comics)|Abomination]] and the [[Hulk (comics)|Hulk]]'s alley fight, "which was complex because of its choreography"; Bruce Banner and [[Betty Ross]]' reunion, "the romantic element of the score"; and the Hulk and Betty in the cave, which "combines The Hulk Theme and when Hulk and Betty are together, so the Bruce and Betty Theme was totally different than my music for The Hulk and Betty". For the Hulk's theme, Armstrong compared it to Williams' main theme for ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', with "simple notation" that "summed up the complete concept". The theme features a bass [[C (musical note)|C note]], with string [[glissando]]s up an octave and then back down to the original note. Other themes include Bruce Banner's theme, for "when he’s alone and searching for the cure"; two theme's for the Abomination, a dark one for the soldier Emil Blonsky and a more aggressive one for when he becomes a monster himself (the latter is combined with the Hulk theme when those character's fight); the love theme for Banner and Betty Ross; and a scientific theme, for "when they are trying to crack the codes of the Hulk". [[Joe Harnell]]'s "The Lonely Man" theme for the 1978 ''[[The Incredible Hulk (1978 TV series)|The Incredible Hulk]]'' television series is briefly quoted in the cue "Bruce Goes Home", with Armstrong playing the piano for the piece himself.&lt;ref name="MftMArmstrong" /&gt;

===''Iron Man 2''===
For the sequel to ''Iron Man'', Debney returned to work with Favreau, replacing Djawadi as composer.&lt;ref name="Debney" /&gt; Debney called his score for ''[[Iron Man 2]]'' "quite different in many ways from the last score. This score while employing much guitar and more contemporary elements, it is also much bigger and darker in tone and scope."&lt;ref name="DebneyMorello" /&gt; He described his music as "[[Led Zeppelin]] with an orchestra",&lt;ref name="DebneySK" /&gt; and elaborated that "The two scores share a common pedigree [of rock-and-roll and electric guitar] but are generally different. They are different scores with different results."&lt;ref name="DebneyIM1" /&gt; Debney was not influenced by the [[AC/DC]] [[Iron Man 2 (soundtrack)|soundtrack for the film]], feeling that "the songs and score play two very different roles in the film", and unlike the previous score he used a large choir for some of the film's more dramatic moments. Morello returned to again contribute guitar performances for the film, this time collaborating with Debney to write some of the music itself, with Debney first composing the score, and then working with Morello on the guitar parts and "textures".&lt;ref name="DebneyMorello" /&gt;

Debney called ''Iron Man 2'' "odd in that there were not a lot of places where a true superhero theme could be played. Tony Stark is uber cool even as Iron Man, so, musically, we couldn’t state a full-blown superhero theme. The strains of Iron Man’s theme are heard only in a few spots by design. I’m hoping with future films, Iron Man might get his full-blown theme played aggressively."&lt;ref name="DebneyIM1" /&gt; For instance, Debney recorded several different versions of the score for scenes where Stark puts on the Iron Man suit, each with "different portions of the theme fleshed out or left out". What was ultimately chosen "was less thematic. It was sort of a groove with a little bit of French horn. Maybe that was the right choice, but it was a difficult decision. It was difficult to find the areas in the movie where we could let Tony be a superhero." He continued, "There were moments where I wanted to play a scene broadly or make a love scene out of it but we were never able to go there", such as for the end of the film where "Tony finally kisses Pepper ... there were a couple of versions I did that were really gorgeous and lush but it just didn't fit. It's a different kind of movie because they kiss and then all of a sudden the mood is broken. It's just the nature of this character." Debney felt that this process led to the score being "watered down and mashed up a little bit" from what he originally intended. However, Debney did not feel the same about his music for the villain, [[Ivan Vanko]], which he described as a personal "joy". He said that Favreau "gave me a great opportunity to get into [the opening] scene and learn [Vanko]'s circumstances and to play sincerely sad music for him and the relationship he had with his father. Jon gave me the opportunity to morph that and turn it into something really dark and twisted. For me that was the most satisfactory part of the score and the film".&lt;ref name="DebneySK" /&gt; For Vanko's theme, the choir sang in Russian to "capture the dark Russian soul" of the character.&lt;ref name="DebneyMorello" /&gt;

===''Thor''===
Director [[Kenneth Branagh]]'s frequent composing collaborator [[Patrick Doyle]] called ''[[Thor (film)|Thor]]'' "the most commercially high profile film I have done since ''[[Mary Shelley's Frankenstein (film)|Frankenstein]]''", and noted that "[[Marvel Studios]] have a brand in ''Thor''. Their interest, like mine, was for strong thematic material that would capture the essence of that brand." Branagh and Doyle wanted the score to have a contemporary feel, while Doyle "was also eager for the score to contain a strong sense of melody, which [Branagh] responds to in my work. He was keen, as indeed I was, that the grand images were not in any way hyperbolized, and that there would be a balance between playing with, and against the images." To distinguish between the realms of [[Asgard (Marvel Comics)|Asgard]] and Earth musically, Doyle used "broader orchestral strokes and thicker orchestration" to depict the grandeur and beauty of Asgard, and more "contemporary, electronic and percussion driven" music for the Earth scenes, incorporating the then-popular [[ostinato]] technique "in a symphonic way whenever appropriate".&lt;ref name="Doyle" /&gt;

Doyle took inspiration for the score from his own [[Celts|Celtic]] background, which he described as "very intertwined" with the [[Norse mythology]] that ''Thor'' is based on, as well as the works of [[Richard Wagner]]. He found the main challenge of the score to be composing a "superhero theme" for the titular character, and a second main theme representing Asgard, the latter of which Doyle wanted "to come across as an old folk song from a Celtic world". He noted that the Asgard theme develops throughout the film to also represent traveling, action, and fighting. Of the other themes he composed for the film, Doyle also noted a theme for [[Jotunheim]], another world visited in the film. On specific instrumentation for the character of Thor, Doyle jokingly noted that a [[piccolo]] would be inappropriate, and that a character with such a big personality and physicality required "a slightly more robust set of musical instruments: horns, low brass, slow strings etc." To represent the character's longing for home after he is banished from Asgard to Earth, Doyle used a [[cor anglais]], which he felt also captured Thor's pathos and nobility.&lt;ref name="Doyle" /&gt;

===''Captain America: The First Avenger''===
[[File:Alan Silvestri 2009.jpg|thumb|upright|right|Alan Silvestri served as composer for ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', ''Marvel's The Avengers'', and ''Avengers: Infinity War'' and has announced that he will return for the fourth ''Avengers'' film.]]
By February 2011, Marvel chose [[Alan Silvestri]] to provide the score for ''[[Captain America: The First Avenger]]'' after composing the "iconic scores" for ''[[Back to the Future]]'' and ''[[Forrest Gump]]'', over a number of other composers including [[Michael Giacchino]], [[John Powell (film composer)|John Powell]], and [[Henry Jackman]].&lt;ref name="SilvestriCapHired" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JackmanWScbcmusic" /&gt; Silvestri then met with director [[Joe Johnston]] to spot the film, and had seven and a half weeks to compose the score. Johnston wanted a full orchestral score "to allow for movement" between the film's two genres: a period piece and a futuristic, high-tech sci-fi film. Silvestri noted the appropriateness of the fact that his style of music, which he describes as "romantically heroic", is often described by others as "patriotic", as well as his tendency to use brass instruments, which can "compete sonically and give the music some kind of presence where it might not have any", something necessary during the film's action sequences.&lt;ref name="SilvestriCap" /&gt;

In Silvestri's first meeting with Johnston, the latter raised his desire for a central theme. On this, Silvestri said, "To have some kind of musical signature either for a character or some aspect of the film, truly holds the score together. A theme makes the music feel like one piece in a sense." For this central theme, a fanfare for [[Captain America]], Silvestri did not look to any past film scores in particular, instead looking to "certain kinds of elements that we have, over time, associated with that kind of heroic statement", such as the percussive elements, intervals, and brass instrumentation of [[Aaron Copland]]'s "[[Fanfare for the Common Man]]". He noted that Captain America is a "very bold and bombastic idea, so you don’t need to inflate that in any way. But that doesn’t mean you have to play those elements down either", adding that he felt Captain America was fleshed out more as a character simply by facing "a really bad guy" in the [[Red Skull (comics)|Red Skull]] in a similar way to [[Luke Skywalker]]'s development in the presence of [[Darth Vader]]. On the Red Skull himself, Silvestri looked to take the character seriously and "play him as bad", but allowed for more compassion for the character when he talks about his tortured past.&lt;ref name="SilvestriCap" /&gt; He also introduced a theme for the Tesseract, Red Skull's energy source.&lt;ref name="SilvestriAvengersThemes" /&gt;

===''The Avengers''===
In November 2011, Marvel announced that Silvestri would return to compose the score for the [[crossover (fiction)|crossover]] film ''[[The Avengers (2012 film)|Marvel's The Avengers]]''. Silvestri found it helpful to have already been part of the "Marvel process", which gave him a "sense of how Marvel treats their characters, cares for them, and a bit of what that Marvel post-production process feels like".&lt;ref name="SilvestriAvengersAnnounce" /&gt; Director [[Joss Whedon]] preferred an "old-school ... old-fashioned" score to using pre-existing songs, which he felt makes "the moment [become] about the song". He called Silvestri "letter perfect for this movie because he can give you the heightened emotion ... but he can also be extraordinarily cue and character specific, which I love."&lt;ref name="WhedonAvengersScore" /&gt; Silvestri did not want the score to have the same "military" feeling as ''Captain America: The First Avengers''{{'}}s, as Stark says in the film "We’re not soldiers." However, Whedon did want aspects of the film to resemble a [[war film]], and "there are times where [the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]] are] absolutely functioning as this paramilitary unit", so Silvestri did add some "military seasoning" in places. Both Whedon and Silvestri wanted the score to build throughout the film, to climax in the final battle. For the aftermath of that fight, Silvestri uses a simple guitar piece to give the audience a rest with a "complete sonic break" from what comes before in the film. He then segues back into the full orchestra for the end of the film. For a sequence where the villain [[Loki (comics)|Loki]] attacks while a string quartet plays [[Franz Schubert]]'s [[String Quartet No. 13 (Schubert)|String Quartet No. 13 in A minor]], the editors had already overlaid the piece with a temp track for when Loki "starts to do his thing". Silvestri expanded on this for the final score, having the music transition from the onscreen quartet to the entire orchestra playing the same piece when the fighting begins.&lt;ref name="SilvestriAvengers" /&gt;

On composing for a film with such a large cast, Silvestri said, "I’ve worked on films where there have been a number of stars and certainly worked on films where there have been characters of equal weight in terms of their level of importance and profile in the film, but this one is somewhat extreme in that regard because each of these characters has their own world ... the film is really about the coming together of these characters, which implies that there is this entity called the Avengers which really has to be representative of all of them together."&lt;ref name="SilvestriAvengersAnnounce" /&gt; Later elaborating on this, Silvestri said, "We knew that if we were to have a theme for every character in this movie, the music would get very clunky and intrusive. So I stayed away from all of that." Instead, Marvel and Whedon wanted a central, definable "Avengers" theme for the film, which Silvestri wanted to have a heroic aspect and a grandness, but also be "generated from that scene when they’re all gathering for the last great battle ... the interesting thing about it as the 'big moment; of the score is that they’re not doing anything. They’re standing there, which allowed me to move away from the idea of it being an action moment."&lt;ref name="SilvestriAvengers" /&gt; Silvestri did ultimately use some other themes in the score: he developed a [[Motif (music)|motif]] for Loki as the central villain of the film, a "low, ominous sequence of chords, [used] when his presence is either visible or implied"; he reprised his Captain America theme, for when that character "makes his entrance, or when he’s in the middle of a fight scene ... yet not using it fully" as "a little of his theme goes a long, long way", and his Tesseract theme, including over the opening logos of the film; and midway through Silvestri's work writing the score, Whedon had seen some completed scenes featuring the [[Black Widow (Natasha Romanova)|Black Widow]] and "wanted to explore music that was a bit more thematic for her", so Silvestri introduced "a lonely, plucked theme with an [[Eastern Europe]]an flavor" to define the character.&lt;ref name="SilvestriAvengersThemes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SilvestriAvengers" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AvengersDescription" /&gt; For the other major characters, Silvestri used instrumentation to differentiate their scenes, for instance Iron Man "always has the more contemporary, rhythmic component to a lot of his music."&lt;ref name="SilvestriAvengersThemes" /&gt;

===''Iron Man 3''===
With ''[[Iron Man 3]]'' featuring a post-''Avengers'' Tony Stark, Marvel and incoming director [[Shane Black]] wanted to move away from the rock sound of the previous ''Iron Man'' films,&lt;ref name="TylerIM3Podcast" /&gt; and towards "a score that echoed the classics of super hero film history",&lt;ref name="TylerIM3" /&gt; for which they approached [[Brian Tyler (composer)|Brian Tyler]], a Marvel fan whose previous music had often been used in temp scores for other films by the studio. Tyler stated that Marvel was interested in him for his more thematic work from the likes of ''[[The Greatest Game Ever Played]]'', ''[[Annapolis]]'', and ''[[Partition (2007 film)|Partition]]'', rather than his "modern" action music such as that for ''[[The Fast and the Furious]]'' films and ''[[Battle: Los Angeles]]'', and wanted him to combine the energy of the latter with the sensibilities of the former. In addition to the classic orchestra, Tyler recorded metallic sounds such as anvils being hit to add an element of "iron" to the score. As a nod to the previous ''Iron Man'' composer's use of guitars, Tyler added instances of the orchestra performing [[Black Sabbath]]-like [[riff]]s throughout the film.&lt;ref name="TylerIM3Podcast" /&gt;

Marvel specifically asked Tyler for a new and different, "really identifiable" theme for Iron Man to represent his "serious" new role in the MCU as a "legitimate superhero", which Tyler described as a thematic [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]]. To create a "bigger and grander" sound than the previous ''Iron Man'' scores, Tyler took influence from the works of John Williams, [[Alex North]], and [[John Barry (composer)|John Barry]], among others. Tyler composed the new theme on piano, but always intended it to be a "march and anthem" with a large brass component. Tyler also used the same theme played on a harp to represent Stark's sad emotional state after he is stranded without the Iron Man suit,&lt;ref name="TylerIM3Podcast" /&gt; and created a "wild 1960s style" arrangement of it for the film's main titles which had reminded Tyler of a typical police series from that era.&lt;ref name="TylerIM3" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TylerThor2Podcast" /&gt; For the [[Extremis]] technology, Tyler wanted a motif with a magical quality as he felt that it was technology so futuristic that it seemed like magic, and so looked to Williams' "The Well of the Souls" cue from ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark (soundtrack)|Raiders of the Lost Ark]]'' for inspiration, giving the motif a spiritual feel. The idea of spirituality also extends to the [[Mandarin (comics)|Mandarin]]'s theme; Tyler noted the ambiguity of the character in terms of ethnicity and culture, and how he appears in the film as a "be-all" terrorist, as well as his role as a fanatical, "quasi-religious leader" comparable to [[Jim Jones]].&lt;ref name="TylerIM3Podcast" /&gt; The theme ultimately combines religious music from multiple cultures—including [[Monasticism|Monastic]], Gothic, and Christian chants and choirs, and sounds from the Middle-East and Asia—and was primarily played on the [[bansuri]] and [[bazantar]].&lt;ref name="TylerIM3Podcast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TylerThor2Podcast" /&gt;

===''Thor: The Dark World''===
[[File:Brian Tyler.JPG|thumb|upright|right|Brian Tyler has composed the most for the MCU, scoring or co-scoring three feature films, a One-Shot, an MCU television special and Marvel Studios' initial fanfare]]
Branagh chose not to return for the sequel to ''Thor'',&lt;ref name="BranaghLeaves" /&gt; and was replaced as director by [[Alan Taylor (director)|Alan Taylor]].&lt;ref name="TaylorThor" /&gt; By August 2012, Doyle had discussed potentially returning to score the film with Taylor,&lt;ref name="Doyle2" /&gt; however, Taylor's first choice for composer was [[Carter Burwell]],&lt;ref name="FeigeThorComposers" /&gt; who signed on to ''[[Thor: The Dark World]]'' by April 2013.&lt;ref name="Burwell" /&gt; A month later, Burwell left the film in what Marvel described as a "creative split",&lt;ref name="BurwellLeaves" /&gt; and Tyler signed on to replace him that June.&lt;ref name="TylerThor2" /&gt; President of Marvel Studios [[Kevin Feige]] later explained that Marvel had approved of Taylor's choice based on Burwell's collaborations with the [[Coen brothers]], but the studio ultimately felt that Burwell was not the right fit for the film, and had to make an early decision to replace the composer due to the relatively short time left for post-production on the film; Feige admitted that if there was "time for trial and error, it might have worked" out. Tyler was chosen by Marvel to replace Burwell based on the positive experience the company had working with him on ''Iron Man 3''.&lt;ref name="FeigeThorComposers" /&gt;

On differentiating his scores for ''Iron Man 3'' and ''The Dark World'', Tyler said that they were at the opposite ends of the "superhero spectrum", and so even though he used full orchestras for both, "the actual writing of the notes and the harmonies and all that was different."&lt;ref name="TylerThorBMI" /&gt; He later elaborated that "The feel of Thor is a very different than Iron Man. Yet they live in the same universe. For me, it’s like somehow [[Indiana Jones]] showed up on the [[Starship Enterprise|Enterprise]], or something."&lt;ref name="TylerThorHuffLive" /&gt; Tyler described ''The Dark World'' as "science fiction meeting classic medieval war",&lt;ref name="TylerThorBMI" /&gt; and saw it as a cross between ''[[Star Wars]]'' and ''[[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|The Lord of the Rings]]''—"there’s spaceships and lasers ... but within it they wear capes and fight with swords and ride horses ... those were not elements really present as much in the first one. So it required something different. I think my score for ''Thor: The Dark World'' would have been out of place in the first film and vice versa."&lt;ref name="TylerThorHuff" /&gt; [[Azam Ali]], who collaborated with Tyler on ''[[Frank Herbert's Children of Dune|Children of Dune]]'', and Tori Letzler are featured vocalists for the score; Tyler felt that their contributions provided "something emotional" to the score.&lt;ref name="AliThor" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Letzler" /&gt;

Rather than have Tyler reprise Doyle's themes from the first film, Marvel wanted Tyler to create a new, post-''Avengers'' Thor theme as he did for Tony Stark in ''Iron Man 3''.&lt;ref name="TylerIM3Podcast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TylerThorHuff" /&gt; Tyler described his new theme as mature, regal, and epic, and noted that the romantic elements with the character [[Jane Foster (comics)|Jane Foster]] become "kind of melancholy" for the sequel, "because she’s this mortal that he’s fallen for, which could not be further from his side of the train tracks".&lt;ref name="TylerThorHuff" /&gt; The theme for Thor evolved from a more "pageant"-like theme that represents Asgard in the film,&lt;ref name="TylerThorFeaturette" /&gt; which has a much more lived-in feeling than it did in the first film. Tyler also introduced a new theme for post-''Avengers'' Loki to reflect his increasingly complicated personality and storyline,&lt;ref name="TylerThor2Podcast" /&gt; performed on a harp to play against expectations.&lt;ref name="TylerLoki" /&gt; Despite not reprising Doyle's themes, Tyler looked to pay homage to his general style and sound from the first film during quieter moments like dialogue scenes.&lt;ref name="TylerThor2Podcast" /&gt; He also quotes Silvestri's Captain America theme when that character makes a brief cameo appearance.&lt;ref name="TylerThor2Podcast" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Thor2Cap" /&gt;

===''Captain America: The Winter Soldier''===
When Henry Jackman was in the running to score ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', he had written "a full-on traditional symphonic, Americana score" as proof-of-concept for Marvel, which he looked to return to when Marvel asked him to score the sequel, ''[[Captain America: The Winter Soldier]]''. He felt that Silvestri had used that same style to great effect in the first film, but found that the second film "could not have been more different, and the score was not suitable, so I had to rewrite it".&lt;ref name="JackmanWScbcmusic" /&gt; Jackman said of his work on the film, "it’s 50% production and all the tricks I’ve learnt from spending years in the record industry but then it’s also got the kind of injection of symphonic, thematic, heroic music that all kind of merges into one musical, and hopefully coherent piece".&lt;ref name="JackmanWSheyu" /&gt; He described the film as aesthetically "way closer to something like ''[[The Dark Knight Rises|Dark Knight Rises]]'' than it is to say the [[Richard Donner]]'s ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'', or the traditional, nostalgic superhero film."&lt;ref name="JackmanWScbcmusic" /&gt; Some of Silvestri's work from the first film is tracked into the opening of the sequel, which Jackman said "reminds everyone where we left off. This character is about to get hurled into a completely different environment, so it’s a nice way to tie the two films together."&lt;ref name="JackmanWSwamg" /&gt;

Jackman first created three pieces of music for directors [[Russo brothers|Anthony and Joe Russo]]: a modern Captain America theme; a six-to-seven minute suite for the Winter Soldier; and a track representing [[Hydra (comics)|Hydra]].&lt;ref name="JackmanWSheyu" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JackmanWScollider" /&gt; Concerning Captain America, Jackman struggled to balance having "enough theme so that you’ve got something heroic to cling onto, but not so much that it’s just becoming nostalgic and irrelevant", and stated that in the third act "the more melodic, the more lyrical, the more thematic element [starts] to come through". The one note Feige gave Jackman on the score was asking him to embrace "those moments that are emotional or historical or nostalgic", such as when the character visits his own [[Smithsonian]] exhibit. For those, Jackman took some inspiration from the works of Aaron Copland.&lt;ref name="JackmanWScollider" /&gt; Jackman described the [[Bucky (Marvel Comics)|Winter Soldier]] as "a mechanized, violent, relentless, nihilistic beast that just destroys everything in its path", so approaching the character in a Wagnerian way would be "inappropriate ... instead [I decided] to embrace it and start exploiting all these other tricks I've learned in working in the record industry and making drum and bass records."&lt;ref name="JackmanWScbcmusic" /&gt; In the Winter Soldier suite, "the strings only show up for the last minute. It is violent—it's got screaming and banging and it's dystopian and dysfunctional. Much closer to a modern electronic thing than anything orchestral."&lt;ref name="JackmanWScbcmusic" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JackmanWSheyu" /&gt; Jackman spent ten days just processing vocal recordings to give the theme a sense of "tortured, time-stretched human cries of someone who has been so processed that it's become mechanized at the same time but you can still hear the human in there". He also tried to give the piece an arc, where the human elements get more "revealed toward the end of the film" as Captain America and the audience come to learn who the Winter Soldier is and care about him.&lt;ref name="JackmanWScb" /&gt; When Jackman played the suite for the directors, they loved the unique and non-film music sound, and asked that Jackman not sanitize or water it down for the film—Joe said, "I really want to hear that in the movie and not just 20% of" it.&lt;ref name="JackmanWSheyu" /&gt; For Hydra, Jackman wanted to move away from the "Wagnerian symphonic baddie music" of the first film, and "come up with a sinister tonality that didn’t feel like the muhahahaha of an arch villain, because the sinister nature of the neo-fascist within the film is modern, credible and politically contemporary."&lt;ref name="JackmanWScollider" /&gt; Jackman also introduces a motif for the [[Falcon (comics)|Falcon]].&lt;ref name="AntManRefs" /&gt;

===''Guardians of the Galaxy''===
As he did on his previous films, director [[James Gunn (filmmaker)|James Gunn]] brought his composer [[Tyler Bates]] onto ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]'' in pre-production so Bates could write music ahead of time for Gunn to film to.&lt;ref name="GunnBatesFB" /&gt; Gunn provided material such as "pre-video sequences" for Bates to use while writing the music,&lt;ref name="BatesHF" /&gt; and then "during action scenes and huge dramatic moments we blare the score on set so that the cast, crew, and camera can move in harmony with the music. Music is often an afterthought in film, but never for us."&lt;ref name="GunnBatesFB" /&gt; Bates then re-wrote most of the score once the film was being edited. Bates found the score to be his "most demanding", and explained that "at least half the cues in the movie have more than 500 tracks of audio", consisting of multiple orchestral passes, choirs, overdubs, and other instrumentation.&lt;ref name="BatesHF" /&gt; On working in with all of the songs that Gunn put in the film's soundtrack, Bates said, "The music is literally a different personality in the movie, has a different function than the songs. It exists more, not only to be propulsive in the action sequences and to set up some of the comedic moments, but really to underscore the emotional depth of the characters."&lt;ref name="BatesWAMG" /&gt;

Bates said on using themes and motifs in the score, "Very few movies that are made these days are fantastical enough to sustain huge, bold identifiable themes. Even with the majority of the comic-book films, they have a tendency to be steeped in a realism that would be disturbed or interrupted by highly emotive, melodic themes, and it seems like a lot of the stuff going in these films is propulsive and somewhat cold emotionally." He felt that ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' did not fit this model, and "unabashedly embraced leitmotifs for the array of cosmic characters" that appear in it.&lt;ref name="GunnBatesThemes" /&gt; Bates described creating a new main theme for a Marvel franchise as "the most rewarding aspect of stepping into a movie like this".&lt;ref name="BatesWAMG" /&gt; Gunn asked for "something kickass that a 4-year-old would remember", and Bates came up with the theme by "noodling" on an electric guitar.&lt;ref name="GunnBatesThemes" /&gt; The villain [[Ronan the Accuser|Ronan]]'s theme is quoted in full only once in the film, as Bates and Gunn wanted him to be more serious and scary which they felt would be undermined by a loud, melodic theme.&lt;ref name="BatesPodcast" /&gt; His presence is generally represented with tones "chock full of low-brass" and [[synthesizer|synths]].&lt;ref name="GunnBatesThemes" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BatesPodcast" /&gt; Bates has "some spongy synthesizers pulsing through" the motif for [[Groot]], which he developed in pre-production. Bates said that he would have infused the score with more of those electronic elements if it was not for the "frenetic working process" on the film.&lt;ref name="BatesWAMG" /&gt;

===''Avengers: Age of Ultron''===
After scoring both ''Iron Man 3'' and ''Thor: The Dark World'', Brian Tyler was rumored for several months to be scoring ''The Avengers'' sequel ''[[Avengers: Age of Ultron]]'', before officially signing on to the film in March 2014.&lt;ref name="AgeofUltron" /&gt; He said that his template for the film was game changing scores such as those for ''Star Wars'', ''Superman'', and ''Raiders of the Lost Ark'', feeling that "You have to build in nostalgia and do it upfront so you can relate to it."&lt;ref name="TylerAoUNostalgia" /&gt; In February 2015, Danny Elfman was revealed to have composed additional music for the score,&lt;ref name="Elfman" /&gt; ultimately receiving co-composer credit.&lt;ref name="ElfmanCredit" /&gt; On working with Elfman, Tyler said, "The movie is such a large canvas that there were parts that really benefited from his kind of voice. But also, it needed to all fit together and hang together seamlessly, and that was something we worked really hard on doing."&lt;ref name="TylerAoUIconic" /&gt; Tyler and Elfman strove to orchestrate, record, and mix their music similarly.&lt;ref name="TylerAoUPodcast2" /&gt; Tyler wrote much more quiet and emotional music for ''Age of Ultron'' "than you would've thought ... you can go deeper in a second movie because in the first movie you really have to set everyone up". He gave Hulk's farewell to Black Widow, [[Quicksilver (comics)|Quicksilver]]'s sacrifice, and the time spent at [[Hawkeye (comics)|Hawkeye]]'s farm as examples of this.&lt;ref name="TylerAoUNewThemes" /&gt;

Tyler stated that his usual approach to taking over a franchise from another composer is to "try to take from what's before me and also forge ahead".&lt;ref name="TylerAoUIconic" /&gt; So, though Tyler "was really married to" the idea of reprising Silvestri's Avengers theme from the first film in the sequel and wanted to keep in-line with "the language of what Alan had done in ''The Avengers''",&lt;ref name="TylerAoUNewThemes" /&gt; he instead began by composing a "classic, epic" suite of his own for the film. Titled "Rise Together", Tyler said that it "is much more about pageantry and a march, and there's a slight militaristic aspect. I tend to stay away from that, but I felt that that, combined with a choir, would make them feel larger than life. And certainly, this is when they're 'rising together,' so you need to have that unifying heroic theme with them."&lt;ref name="TylerAoUIconic" /&gt; Elfman then took Silvestri's theme and "pulled it into" the new material for the sequel to make a "kind of a hybrid" theme for the film.&lt;ref name="ElfmanHybrid" /&gt; Tyler also looked to reference his own Iron Man and Thor themes in the score, as well as previous Captain America material, "in order to create a similar musical universe",&lt;ref name="TylerAoUNostalgia" /&gt; especially since those character's post-''Avengers'' solo films "set up" ''Age of Ultron''.&lt;ref name="TylerAoUNewThemes" /&gt;

Tyler composed several other new themes for the film, to represent the titular villain [[Ultron]]; the relationship that develops between Black Widow and the Hulk; and the new Avenger [[Vision (Marvel Comics)|Vision]].&lt;ref name="TylerAoUNewThemes" /&gt; Tyler wanted Ultron's theme to sound "almost heroic", since Ultron thinks he is saving the world, "but dissonant and tweaky enough" to reflect that "he doesn't quite have it right" and is still a villain. The melody is simple so that it is easy to remember, but starts [[Flat (music)|flat]] by one note to make the theme sound slightly "off", is played on two pianos with one of them out of tune, and when the main phrase is repeated the last note is played "ahead by a beat" the second time; "not only out of tune, but out of time." The theme also features an artificially distorted guitar to give it a machine-like tone.&lt;ref name="TylerAoUPodcast" /&gt; Tyler described the Black Widow/Hulk relationship as an "unrequited romance and this kind of sad situation" with "the curse of the Hulk being a barrier between [the two characters] and what they really want. And so that melody, that had to be almost like a lullaby, but broken."&lt;ref name="TylerAoUNewThemes" /&gt; Tyler wrote the "lullaby" to be understated, and it is often played on piano or cello.&lt;ref name="TylerAoUPodcast2" /&gt; For the Vision's theme, Tyler "wanted to go for something that was underneath and delicate, and had kind of a wispy nature to it, in a sense—and almost towards the romantic".&lt;ref name="TylerAoUIconic" /&gt; He tried to reflect the character's role as a [[messianism|messianic]] figure of sorts, and Ultron's intended redemption for Earth,&lt;ref name="TylerAoUPodcast2" /&gt; and said, "you don’t really know what side he’s on. You have this guy who’s literally two minutes old and is born in this movie with this knowledge of humanity. It’s Machiavellian in a way." The theme is an adagio that is "not your typical bombast, look how muscley this guy is; it’s more of a mystery."&lt;ref name="WonderCon2016" /&gt; To represent the character's youth and questions about himself, it features string glissandos that constantly change between chords during his introduction, and often momentarily settle on uncertain notes and sounds.&lt;ref name="TylerAoUPodcast2" /&gt; Tyler constantly instructed the orchestra to play quieter, "trying to say more with less for Vision".&lt;ref name="TylerAoUIconic" /&gt; The music for the visions that the [[Scarlet Witch]] gives the Avengers pays homage to scores from the 1950s, with Tyler using a "randomly played" [[vibraphone]] and strings such as a harp to create a "dreaminess" and "hypnotic effect".&lt;ref name="TylerAoUPodcast2" /&gt;

===''Ant-Man''===
[[Steven Price (composer)|Steven Price]] was announced as the composer for ''[[Ant-Man (film)|Ant-Man]]'' by director [[Edgar Wright]], who he had previously worked with, in February 2014,&lt;ref name="Price1" /&gt; but they both left the film that March.&lt;ref name="Price2" /&gt; In January 2015, [[Christophe Beck]] was hired to score the film, having previously worked with the new director, [[Peyton Reed]].&lt;ref name="Beck" /&gt; Beck and Reed began experimenting with "high concept" electronic music to create a "glitched out, digital, electronic, skittery score" that could represent the insect and technology aspects of the film, but it was ultimately "too weird and quirky ... almost weird for its own sake". Feige asked that they instead take "the classic symphonic approach with big themes and bold brass",&lt;ref name="BeckCollider" /&gt; which Beck did with the unique twist of "a sneaky sense of fun since it is, after all, not only a superhero movie, but also a heist comedy."&lt;ref name="BeckWAMG" /&gt; That heist genre gave Beck "a little latitude to use a rhythm section and something a little bit more funky and jazzy and groovy that I wouldn’t otherwise have been able to get away with."&lt;ref name="BeckCollider" /&gt;

Beck composed two main themes for the film: the Ant-Man superhero theme and a theme for family. In addition to using the traditional brass for the Ant-Man theme, Beck used an alto flute and violas, which he felt had "a little bit of the sound world of the heist movie and the spy movie, the old [[James Bond]] sound." For a sequence where Ant-Man surfs down a water pipe on a raft made of ants, Beck began arranging the theme as a "regular action cue" but found it "a little too intense for the scene". Reed wanted it to have more of a sense of fun, and Beck eventually wrote a piece evoking the "classic guitar surf music", but with the orchestra rather than a guitar. The family theme represents the film's two father-daughter relationships, between [[Ant-Man (Scott Lang)|Scott Lang]] and his daughter Cassie, and between [[Hank Pym]] and his daughter [[Hope Pym|Hope van Dyne]].&lt;ref name="BeckCollider" /&gt; Beck also intended for it to "signify the emergence of Hope as something of a hero herself". Additionally, the villainous [[Yellowjacket (comics)|Yellowjacket]] has "a more traditional theme, presented in traditional fashion, but augmented with processed electronics to convey the crazed and obsessed nature of the character". Of the many ant species featured in the film, Reed and Beck felt that the [[Paraponera clavata|bullet ants]] deserved their "own identity"; since the species is primarily indigenous to South America, Beck used ancient Aztec drums and tribal flutes to give them a "regional flavor".&lt;ref name="BeckFMM" /&gt; For a scene where Ant-Man infiltrates the Avengers headquarters, Beck quotes Silvestri's Avengers theme and Jackman's Falcon motif from ''Winter Soldier''.&lt;ref name="AntManRefs" /&gt;&lt;ref name="BeckFMM" /&gt;

===''Captain America: Civil War''===
The Russo brothers confirmed in August 2014 that Jackman would return to score ''[[Captain America: Civil War]]''.&lt;ref name="JackmanCW" /&gt; In July 2015, Jackman noted the industrial elements of his Winter Soldier suite from the previous film was an indication of what the new score would sound like, but did caution that "it's just a jumping off point since the Russos are looking for something new—similar with a twist."&lt;ref name="JackmanPixels" /&gt; Once Jackman read the script for the film, he realized that the "movie tonally was so different to the second one ... it’s sort of half Captain America, half an ''Avengers'' film in a way" and so Jackman ultimately wrote a much more symphonic and orchestral score than he did for ''Winter Soldier''. This culminates in the final fight between Captain America, Winter Soldier, and Iron Man, the music for which Jackman described as "somewhat operatic and ... almost classical in its style ... some of the harmony and the orchestration really does get quite classical."&lt;ref name="JackmanCWcollider" /&gt;

Concerning the central conflict of the film, Jackman found that he was in "constant danger of tipping it too much" and pushing the audience to one side or the other, so he composed a new main theme for the film to represent that Civil War, which he called "a generic theme to balance everything out",&lt;ref name="JackmanCWbsp" /&gt; and "a narrative theme toward which all the characters can gravitate. It wrapped them all up and it helped to bind the movie together rather than do endless disparate themes."&lt;ref name="JackmanCWbelief" /&gt; The second major theme in the film is a thriller theme, that appears whenever the central mystery surrounding several character's pasts and [[Baron Zemo|Zemo]]'s plan is teased or explored. It consists of a flute motif tied to the Winter Soldier's Russian handlers and a rising adagio that represents Zemo's twisted determination, and was inspired by the works of [[Jerry Goldsmith]].&lt;ref name="JackmanCWsw" /&gt; Of the character themes from previous films that Jackman did use, "where appropriate",&lt;ref name="JackmanCWbelief" /&gt; he evolved them to fit the tone and style of the new score. Captain America's theme could not be too prominent or heroic, as that would suggest that he was the hero of the film when the Russos were trying to create an ambiguity surrounding the main conflict—this does change throughout the film though, becoming more heroic when Captain America "turns out to be right all along". For the Winter Soldier, Jackman took a "rising string rhyme" that was buried underneath "the chaos and the industrial stuff" in the end of the character's suite from ''The Winter Soldier'', and developed that into a much more symphonic theme for the character, in keeping with his much more human portrayal in this film.&lt;ref name="JackmanCWsw" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JackmanCWblackfilm" /&gt;

Jackman also wrote motifs for the major characters introduced in the film: [[Spider-Man]], [[Black Panther (comics)|Black Panther]], and Zemo.&lt;ref name="JackmanCWcollider" /&gt; Spider-Man's motif has a small arc to match that character's few appearances, being introduced very gently as the "somewhat confused, slightly tender" Peter Parker first appears, followed by "the seed of his heroism" when he is recruited for the Avengers, and finally a "full-blown version" plays when he fights alongside the other heroes.&lt;ref name="JackmanCWd23" /&gt; For Black Panther, Jackman used a combination of African woodwind instruments whenever the character talks about his ancestors, while muted trombones "brought his character into the grandeur of the symphony orchestra, but there’s a slightly vengeful, serrated sound to muted trombones if you pick the right kind of mood". Zemo's personal theme was performed on "a lot of these rather unusual tuned bells" that gave him an "otherly sound", as well as a [[cimbalon]] to represent his Eastern European roots.&lt;ref name="JackmanCWcollider" /&gt;

===''Doctor Strange''===
Having known Kevin Feige for some time, Michael Giacchino spent years working with him on potentially scoring one of Marvel's films. When he heard of development on ''[[Doctor Strange (2016 film)|Doctor Strange]]'', Giacchino was particularly interested in working on the film, feeling that it would have more of an [[independent film]] feel than other Marvel films. He contacted Feige, "and that ball just rolled very quickly downhill, and I was on" the film.&lt;ref name="GiacchinoTHR" /&gt; Giacchino revealed his involvement with ''Doctor Strange'' in May 2016.&lt;ref name="Giacchino" /&gt; Director [[Scott Derrickson]] called the score "magic in the literal sense of the word" and said that Giacchino "is doing what good scorers do, which is he is not just creating music that supports the images, he's adding a third thing to the movie. It becomes something new with his music in there that it didn't have with temp music."&lt;ref name="DerricksonMagic" /&gt;

For the score, Giacchino felt no pressure to align his music with the style or tone of previous MCU films, and "in fact they encouraged me to go in my direction, so there were never any handcuffs put on me." In regards to the title character, Giacchino felt the key "was getting inside of him—not worrying so much about the magic stuff, more just thinking about who he was as a person, what he lost and then how that loss affected him. For me it's a very sad story, and a lot of the music has this very melancholy feel to it."&lt;ref name="GiacchinoTHR" /&gt; To particularly differentiate the score, and help create a "mystical mood", Giacchino used a [[harpsichord]] and an [[electric sitar]].&lt;ref name="GiacchinoVariety" /&gt;

===''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2''===
Bates was confirmed to be returning for the second ''Guardians'' film, ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2]]'', in August 2015,&lt;ref name="Bates2" /&gt; and began composing by that December for Gunn to once again film to.&lt;ref name="BatesPre2" /&gt; On using this technique again on the sequel, Bates said, "We’ve gone even further down that road ... I would rather establish the DNA of our music prior to post-production when everything’s so frenetic so that we can work on themes and establish melodies that are original to the film."&lt;ref name="WonderCon2016" /&gt;

===''Spider-Man: Homecoming''===
While promoting ''Doctor Strange'' in early November 2016, Feige accidentally revealed that Giacchino would be returning to compose the score for ''[[Spider-Man: Homecoming]]''. Giacchino soon confirmed this himself.&lt;ref name="GiacchinoSM" /&gt;

===''Thor: Ragnarok''===
By August 2016, [[Mark Mothersbaugh]] was set to score the [[Thor: Ragnarok|third ''Thor'' film]].&lt;ref name="Mothersbaugh" /&gt;

===''Black Panther''===
Wanting to put a "personal stamp" on ''[[Black Panther (film)|Black Panther]]'' and differentiate it from other MCU films, director [[Ryan Coogler]] looked to bring back several of his previous collaborators to work on the film, including composer [[Ludwig Göransson]], whom he had worked with on ''[[Fruitvale Station]]'' and ''[[Creed (film)|Creed]]''.&lt;ref name="Göransson" /&gt;

===''Avengers: Infinity War''===
Silvestri announced in June 2016 that he would be returning to score ''[[Avengers: Infinity War]]''.&lt;ref name="SilvestriIW" /&gt;

===''Ant-Man and the Wasp''===
In June 2017, Reed confirmed that Beck would be returning to score ''[[Ant-Man and the Wasp]]''.&lt;ref name="BeckAntManWasp" /&gt;

===''Captain Marvel''===
In June 2018, [[Pinar Toprak]] announced that she would score ''[[Captain Marvel (film)|Captain Marvel]]'', the first female composer for the MCU.&lt;ref name="Toprak" /&gt;

===Sequel to ''Avengers: Infinity War''===
Silvestri announced in June 2016 that he would be returning to score [[Untitled Avengers film|the sequel to ''Avengers: Infinity War'']].&lt;ref name="SilvestriIW" /&gt;

===''Spider-Man: Far From Home''===
In October 2018, Giacchino was confirmed to return to score ''[[Spider-Man: Far From Home]]''.&lt;ref name="GiacchinoSMFFH" /&gt;

==Short films==
Marvel's first two [[Marvel One-Shot]] short films, ''The Consultant'' and ''A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to Thor's Hammer'', were both scored by DJ [[Paul Oakenfold]].&lt;ref name="Oakenfold" /&gt;

===''Item 47''===
The third One-Shot, ''[[Item 47]]'', had a bigger scope and budget than the previous shorts. Marvel approached [[Christopher Lennertz]] to provide a "big and fun and funny" score; Lennertz described the One-Shots as "a little quirkier than the movies, in terms of making sure that they’re fast and they usually have a little bit more of a comedic bent to it". Lennertz' score for the short is "rock-based", with a lot of electronics and guitars. For the opening bank robbery, "We had a big twangy low guitar theme, almost like a [[Jack White]] kind of a thing on guitar". At the end of the short, when money 'rains down', Lennertz paid homage to [[Ennio Morricone]] with vocals in a "classic spoofy" way.&lt;ref name="LennertzShorts" /&gt;

===''Agent Carter''===
Lennertz, who returned to score the One-Shot, and D'Esposito, the director, wanted a more traditional, orchestral score for ''[[Agent Carter (film)|Agent Carter]]'',&lt;ref name="LennertzShorts" /&gt; with D'Esposito wanting to balance the period setting and modern Marvel superhero feel. D'Esposito referenced [[Johnny Rivers]]' "[[Secret Agent Man (Johnny Rivers song)|Secret Agent Man]]", "even though it was in the 60's" as inspiration. Lennertz felt D'Esposito "did a terrific job getting that [feeling with the One-Shot] and reaching that" while having "a [[James Bond]] secret agent sentiment to it too."&lt;ref name="D'EspositoAC" /&gt; To create the score, Lennertz "put together a big band, combined it with an orchestra, and added modern electronic and dub-step elements", to represent the 40s setting, the Marvel feeling, and the advanced technology, respectively.&lt;ref name="LennertzShorts" /&gt;

===''All Hail the King''===
With ''[[All Hail the King]]'' serving as a spin-off/sequel to ''Iron Man 3'', many crew members from the film worked on the short alongside returning actor [[Ben Kingsley]], including composer Brian Tyler.&lt;ref name="CagedHeatMW" /&gt; He described his music for ''All Hail the King''—which features a title sequence inspired by ''[[Dr. No (film)|Dr. No]]'', ''[[Charade (1963 film)|Charade]]'', and ''[[Iron Monkey (1993 film)|Iron Monkey]]'', as well as other [[exploitation films]] "ranging from obscure Kung Fu to funky Italian Horror"—as "retro vibed".&lt;ref name="TylerAHtK" /&gt;&lt;ref name="AHtKPerception" /&gt;

==Television series==
===''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.''===
[[File:McCrearyHeadshot2009.jpg|thumb|right|upright|Bear McCreary, the composer for ''Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.'', has expanded and contracted his orchestra section throughout the series to reflect the changes each season]]
For Marvel's first [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe television series|television series set in the MCU]], the Whedon-created ''[[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.]]'', frequent genre television series composer [[Bear McCreary]] signed on to compose the score. "The series centers on the behind-the-scenes people, their heroism and their quirks," McCreary explained, "As such, the music I wrote is heroic and, at times, quirky and offbeat." McCreary spoke at length with Whedon "about the challenge of creating a score that is big enough in its orchestral presence that it feels cinematic and feels at home in the Marvel Cinematic Universe. It also must capture the intimate human characteristics that define this series. In editorial, it became clear that simply tracking in typical big 'superhero movie' music wasn’t going to work. So Joss helped guide me to find a sound that lives a little in both worlds."&lt;ref name="McCreary" /&gt; McCreary worked with several soloists throughout the series, including [[Oingo Boingo]] guitarist [[Steve Bartek]];&lt;ref name="McCreary101" /&gt; vocalist Raya Yarbrough;&lt;ref name="McCreary111" /&gt; composer [[Jeremy Zuckerman]] playing the [[gu zheng]] for "[[Girl in the Flower Dress]]";&lt;ref name="McCreary105" /&gt; and cellist [[Calder Quartet|Eric Buyers]] for when "the cellist" character [[List of Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. characters#Guest characters|Audrey]] performs in "[[The Only Light in the Darkness]]".&lt;ref name="McCreary119" /&gt;

In addition to his orchestral music for the series, McCreary intertwined "these intricate symphonic layers ... with complex synthesizer programming, giving the score a modern edge."&lt;ref name="McCreary101" /&gt; He described this programming as "clean", with "warm, round tones, built from simple sine waves with rudimentary reverb, delay and filters added for personality." With the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 2)|second season]], McCreary permanently expanded the brass section and "thinned out" the woodwinds section to give the orchestra "more weight in the lower frequencies", matching the darker look and tone of the season. He also cut back on his use of electric guitar, which was often used for [[Daisy Johnson|Skye]] before she became an official agent; McCreary felt that "a common instrument that stood out from the epic orchestral texture associated with our true S.H.I.E.L.D. agents" had felt more natural for the then "lovable hacker, a relatable outsider from our world". He also evolved his synthesizer use, making them "mangled under heavy distortion, mutilated beneath waves of noise".&lt;ref name="McCreary201" /&gt; After the introduction of the [[Inhumans]], McCreary expanded the sound of the score "in a big way" for the [[Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. (season 3)|third season]], adding larger percussion, and many more trombones than previously, which required the recording space to be reconfigured.&lt;ref name="McCreary301" /&gt; For "[[Maveth]]", McCreary used a 90-piece orchestra rather than the series' typical 50 or 70 players.&lt;ref name="McCreary310" /&gt;

McCreary saw his main theme for the series, which also represents the central team of agents, as primarily being a theme for [[Phil Coulson]].&lt;ref name="McCreary101" /&gt;&lt;ref name="McCrearyDoG" /&gt; McCreary noted that "in one of the movies that would be inappropriate. You wouldn't do that for Coulson when Thor or Captain America are in the same story. But here Coulson is the hero ... It's all about him."&lt;ref name="McCrearyDoG" /&gt; McCreary initially wrote the theme in F major, "giving it a very triumphant sound", with one instance in [[Pilot (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|the pilot]] diminishing it to F minor. Executive producer [[Jed Whedon]] "astutely pointed out that the minor version was more satisfying than the major version", and so McCreary 'tweaked' the theme permanently into F minor.&lt;ref name="McCreary101" /&gt; [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] and Marvel allowed McCreary to use a full symphonic orchestra for every episode, and so there is "a full section of brass that's pounding out his theme when he comes out in his heroic moments." McCreary had to work harder than usual to make the theme heard, given that the show does not have a traditional [[title sequence]].&lt;ref name="McCrearyDoG" /&gt; To accompany the main theme, McCreary wrote an ostinato "that doesn’t draw as much attention to itself as a full-blown melody. I use this catchy little riff to build up steam before sweeping statements of the Main Theme."&lt;ref name="McCreary101" /&gt;

[[Deathlok|Mike Peterson]]'s theme is most commonly performed on a solo electric guitar—McCreary felt that "the image of a single guitar player trying to hold his own against a 90-piece orchestra is a nice metaphor for how Mike must feel"—which is "consumed by distorted synthesizers and low brass" whenever the darker or more unstable sides of the character's superpowers are shown. McCreary also introduced a theme for the mysterious Centipede group in the pilot. "To imply the centipede-nature of the theme," McCreary "used ten notes, divided into two groups of 5. Played on delicate bells and de-tuned piano, the percussive nature of the notes evokes two rows of tiny insect feet crawling across a string."&lt;ref name="McCreary101" /&gt; This theme also comes to represent the group's leader, the Clairvoyant.&lt;ref name="McCreary116" /&gt; The emotional bond between the central characters is represented by "The Agents" theme, a much more intimate and accessible idea than the main theme. McCreary described the theme as unfolding "essentially like a pop-song, with a simple A-B-A-A structure".&lt;ref name="McCreary102" /&gt; The Skye theme is most clearly heard in emotional moments dealing with that character's backstory, but also appears in many other variations, including brief, romantic statements to highlight her early relationship with Grant Ward.&lt;ref name="McCreary103" /&gt; Fitz and Simmons' theme is " less melodic than the other themes, and more motivic. It’s essentially an ostinato that rolls over itself again and again, evolving into subtly different variations with each turn through the pattern. This musically emulates their speaking pattern, where they are constantly stumbling over one another and saying the same thing in slightly different ways."&lt;ref name="McCreary106" /&gt; "[[The Hub (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|The Hub]]" introduces the audience (and Skye) to "Big S.H.I.E.L.D.", as opposed to Coulson's small team, which McCreary gave its own, more militaristic theme.&lt;ref name="McCreary107" /&gt; The theme for [[John Garrett (comics)|John Garrett]] has two parts, an ostinato and a melody, and "represents his adventurous personality, designed to be fun, bouncy and as far away from ominous as possible".&lt;ref name="McCreary116" /&gt;

The episode "[[Turn, Turn, Turn (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.)|Turn, Turn, Turn]]" reveals to the series' characters that Hydra has infiltrated S.H.I.E.L.D. For much of the episode, they believe that Agent [[Victoria Hand]], who was introduced in "The Hub", is a Hydra agent, and so the Big S.H.I.E.L.D. theme functions as the series' Hydra theme. Once John Garrett is revealed to be the traitor, and the Clairvoyant, the Centipede became the new Hydra theme, though McCreary continued to use his Garrett theme rather than outright replace it with the Hydra theme as [[Bill Paxton]]'s "performance after being revealed as the Clairvoyant is even more fun and energetic. So, his theme still fits him perfectly, it just shows us a different side of his personality."&lt;ref name="McCreary106" /&gt; With the second season came new Hydra characters, and their new [[MacGuffin]], the [[Terrigen Mist|Obelisk]], for which McCreary wanted to use a Hydra theme. Feeling that his previous themes had become too complicated during the first season, and were too tied to that season's narrative, McCreary composed a new Hydra theme, which "in true bad-guy-theme fashion ... is constructed from distantly related minor chords, and contains lots of close intervals."&lt;ref name="McCreary201" /&gt;

McCreary created his own theme for the Tesseract, "an ominous melodic line that shifts between two distantly related minor chords",&lt;ref name="McCreary102" /&gt; and for Asgard, "like an old fanfare, a melody that capture[s] the majesty of Asgardian nobility" though it is generally performed as a "smaller version" since the series is still "rooted in reality".&lt;ref name="McCreary108" /&gt; However, when [[Peggy Carter]] makes guest appearances on the series through flashbacks, McCreary quotes Christopher Lennertz's ''Agent Carter'' theme. McCreary said on this, "I was excited for the opportunity to incorporate his music into my S.H.I.E.L.D. score, because it further cements the Marvel [Cinematic] Universe together as a coherent whole ... Chris was thrilled and sent me his scores for reference."&lt;ref name="McCreary201" /&gt;

In June 2014, after [[Agent Carter (TV series)|a television series extension]] of the One-Shot ''Agent Carter'' was ordered by ABC, the short's composer Christopher Lennertz talked about the possibility of him being involved with the series saying Louis D'Esposito, the One-Shot director also involved with the series, wanted Lennertz involved,&lt;ref name="LennertzTV1" /&gt; before officially signing on to compose for the series that September.&lt;ref name="LennertzTV2" /&gt; On his music for the series, Lennertz said, "I get to mix a lot of things that don’t often get to go together in terms of period, music, jazz, trumpet, mixed with orchestra, mixed with electronics and brushes on a drum set and things." He researched "what was going on between '46 and 1950 and what it was that would be part of that era ... I knew [[Count Basie]]. I knew [[Glenn Miller]], all those things were happening at the time, but then we also figured out that it was sort of changing from big band to smaller jazz ensembles." This led to Lennertz focusing a lot on trumpets for [[Peggy Carter]]'s sound, "which makes a lot of sense because it’s also very sneaky, and it lends itself to espionage and that kind of thing".&lt;ref name="StarSpangledManAC" /&gt; Lennertz introduced a folk choral piece performed by a Russian men's choir during "[[The Iron Ceiling]]".&lt;ref name="LennertzTV3" /&gt;

===''Daredevil''===
[[John Paesano]] sought out the composer role for the first Marvel/[[Netflix]] series, ''[[Daredevil (TV series)|Daredevil]]'', after he had previously worked with [[showrunner]] [[Steven S. DeKnight]] on a proof of concept. After successfully auditioning for the job, Paesano joined the series several weeks into post-production, and had to provide around 25–30 minutes of music per episode. He averaged "around an episode every four or five days". DeKnight "had a very clear vision of what he wanted. He wanted to really keep the show grounded and he wanted to make it feel real and not so fantastical like some of the other Marvel properties were. He wanted music you could feel and not necessarily hear. We cut the score to be minimalistic." Once [[Daredevil (Marvel Comics character)|Daredevil]] gets his superhero costume at the end of the [[Daredevil (season 1)|first season]], "the music starts to change color and we start to get more in to that Marvel universe."&lt;ref name="PaesanoFOW" /&gt; Due to his schedule and the style of the score, Paesano ultimately used mostly electronic sounds and music, but did try to add acoustic instruments, such as cellos, where possible to have more of a hybrid sound, often using these in non-traditional ways.&lt;ref name="PaesanoDoG" /&gt; Instead of more traditional percussion, Paesano used a low pulse throughout the series, emulating a heartbeat since the titular character often listens to people's heartbeats with his heightened senses.&lt;ref name="PaesanoFOW" /&gt; Paesano took inspiration from [[James Newton Howard]]'s ''[[Michael Clayton (film)|Michael Clayton]]'' score for the series' lawyer-oriented scenes.&lt;ref name="PaesanoPaste" /&gt;

On returning for the series' [[Daredevil (season 2)|second season]], with new showrunners [[Douglas Petrie]] and Marco Ramirez (who had worked with DeKnight on the first season), Paesano felt that the two "really were true to what we were trying to do" with the first season, but the score still changed to reflect the new elements of season two "that we had to acknowledge. Obviously we have two characters being introduced, we have the [[Punisher]] and [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra]], and they both have their own backstories, their own interactions with Matt Murdock, so there are way more branches in this season than there were last season ... we just had to broaden the score to handle some of these different stories." Paesano continued, "even though there are these new stories, it’s still in the same [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell’s Kitchen]] atmosphere that we’re creating. So there’s definitely differences, but it’s not like we all of the sudden went into John Williams territory ... it’s definitely a very grounded show but it definitely jumps up a couple levels." Paesano worked closely with the series' sound design team, spotting episodes with them to coordinate where "we were going to hit what" and "maintain that definable aspect of New York" and its sound.&lt;ref name="PaesanoCollider" /&gt;

For his audition, Paesano created a demo which included a simple piano motif. Though this material would usually not be used in the final score, in this instance Paesano took the motif and converted it into a main theme for the series, which becomes the theme for Daredevil in the show.&lt;ref name="PaesanoFOW" /&gt; The final theme was co-composed by Braden Kimball.&lt;ref name="DDSoundtrack" /&gt; The first episode ends with a montage that the editors originally temped with a song, but DeKnight wanted to use original music instead. Paesano subsequently wrote a more "songish" version of the main theme for the sequence, with a basic verse-chorus-verse structure, and instrumentation such as guitars and a drum kit to retain the feel and energy of the originally chosen song.&lt;ref name="PaesanoDoG" /&gt; Besides the main theme, Paesano tended to focus more on "a feel and a tone and a sound" rather than ''Star Wars''-style motifs and "heavy, thematic, melodic elements".&lt;ref name="PaesanoGoD" /&gt; The approach for villain [[Kingpin (comics)|Wilson Fisk]] was to juxtapose "this big bullish threatening character" with "light and sparse and elegant" classical music. For when his "evil twisted side" shows through, Paesano "took classical pieces of music and I twisted them up and played them backwards or redid some of the harmony or put them through distortion and created a classical vibe but really mangled and twisted".&lt;ref name="PaesanoSCNS" /&gt; For [[Stick (comics)|Stick]], Paesano used a cello bow on the neck of the cello, a technique called [[col legno]], to replicate the sound of the blind man's cane.&lt;ref name="PaesanoDoG" /&gt; Paesano described his "themes" for Punisher and Elektra in the second season as "angry" and "mystical" sounding, respectively.&lt;ref name="PaesanoGoD" /&gt;

===''Jessica Jones''===
At a San Diego Comic-Con panel in 2015, [[Sean Callery]] revealed that he would be composing the score for ''[[Jessica Jones (TV series)|Jessica Jones]]''.&lt;ref name="CalleryJJ" /&gt; The series' showrunner, [[Melissa Rosenberg]], asked for Callery based on his work for ''[[Homeland (TV series)|Homeland]]'', which she felt sounded like it could serve ''Jessica Jones'' well. However, Callery's music for the latter ultimately became "something so completely and wonderfully different" once he started exploring the tone and "color" of ''Jessica Jones''. Callery found that the more intimate and organic his music, the more it "clicked with the series".&lt;ref name="CalleryGold" /&gt; To match the series' psychological thriller and neo-noir tone, Callery used a "smaller ensemble, it's almost like a jazz score, but there's some very weird, gooey sound design elements that kind of come in". Callery was influenced by the style and works of [[Bill Evans]] for the score. Rosenberg often asked Callery to have the music "do less",&lt;ref name="CalleryPremiere" /&gt; such as when he scored a fight sequence as a big, percussive superhero scene, and Rosenberg felt that even then the series should feel intimate; she suggested Callery just use a regular drum kit for the fights instead.&lt;ref name="CalleryGold" /&gt; Callery's assistant Jamie Forsyth also contributed to the music for the series.&lt;ref name="CalleryGold" /&gt;&lt;ref name="JJSoundtrack" /&gt;

Callery did not begin composing the series' main theme until after reading two or three scripts, and did not see the opening graphics until after the second episode, at which point he had "a framework for a theme that [he] hoped would work". At this time, Callery said he started "fooling around" with ideas for the theme, and eventually settled on one that he felt had a "sneaky and fun" quality, adding, Jessica Jones "has dry humor, a real edge to her. But there was something to this character that had a little whisker of playfulness in there, like a cat or something." After creating the theme, Callery expanded it, adding a "fun" rhythmic quality, and eventually fully orchestrating it to include a piano, which he played himself, as well as instruments such as the acoustic bass, and additional sound design. Regarding the electric guitar's entrance, Callery pointed out that it got "bigger there because as I looked at the graphics, the lights got a little more strobe-y. So that's when I decided the electric guitar might be a kind of neat add there so that the whole piece will arc a little more."&lt;ref name="CalleryVariety" /&gt;

Jessica Jones has several personal themes that Callery "wove throughout the series", which he found to be most effective when played on solo instruments—"Whether they were guitar or solo piano, we always found that when the textures and the orchestration were minimal, soloistic, and expressive it just hit the right tone." One theme for the character represents "a light inside of her that is untouched by the cruelties that have befallen her. I stopped short of saying that it’s a happy theme, but it’s about her untouched pure self that she can trust in and is truly hers; it’s one of compassion and of caring." Another is more inline with her outward appearance and personality, which Callery described as tough and resilient, and "something that she totally owns". For the villainous [[Purple Man|Kilgrave]], who is not seen in some of the series' early episodes, Callery "had to suggest his presence without actually seeing him. So initially he had a moody tone to him, which eventually started morphing into a darker theme" as the character physically appears and begins to play a larger role in the series.&lt;ref name="CallerySoundtrax" /&gt;

===''Luke Cage''===
In April 2016, showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker revealed that [[Adrian Younge]] and [[Ali Shaheed Muhammad]] were composing the music for ''[[Luke Cage (TV series)|Luke Cage]]'', with "a '90s hip-hop vibe".&lt;ref name="CokerApril2016" /&gt; Coker had contacted Younge and Muhammad separately, asking if they would like to work together on the series, not knowing that the pair were already working together on an album.&lt;ref name="LCSpin" /&gt; Younge and Muhammad composed the score as if they were creating 13 albums, one for each episode,&lt;ref name="StreetLevelMusicTVGuide" /&gt; with the music inspired by [[Wu-Tang Clan]], [[Ennio Morricone]], and Muhammad's group [[A Tribe Called Quest]].&lt;ref name="StreetLevelMusic/Film" /&gt; Muhammad felt that the music was "about getting that hip-hop foundation and making sure those drums were as big as day",&lt;ref name="StreetLevelMusicNerdist" /&gt; while Younge said, "we wanted to make something great. Not just for black people or minorities, just something great that just happens to be based on our culture."&lt;ref name="StreetLevelMusic/Film" /&gt; The duo composed around twenty minutes of music for each episode, composing the entire season's score in nine months.&lt;ref name="LCSpin" /&gt;

Younge and Muhammad looked at all of the different sounds of Harlem, including hip-hop, jazz, blues, and psychedelic rock, to give each character "their own theme and their own sound" that was all still representative of the culture. For Luke Cage specifically, Coker noted that he is a character who understands the roots of the modern culture, and understands where modern Harlem and hip-hop sensibilities originated, so Younge and Muhammad looked to the beginnings of modern hip-hop for his sound.&lt;ref name="LCUrbanDaily" /&gt; For Cage's more dramatic or emotional moments, vocalist Loren Oden was used as "kind of like [Cage's] inner voice". For the character of [[Diamondback (Willis Stryker)|Diamondback]], opera singer Brooke deRosa, whom Younge had often worked with before, was used. To reflect the character [[Cottonmouth (Cornell Cottonmouth)|Cottonmouth]]'s status in the series as a musician who primarily plays the [[Fender Rhodes]], the composers "pretty much exclusively use Fender Rhodes keyboards for him. That is who he is." The most difficult episode for the composers was the fourth, which features flashbacks to Cage's time in prison. They felt that the episode's temp music was "all over the place, and it didn’t feel cohesive", and were unsure whether to illustrate the idea of an incarcerated black man using "old slave-blues-type" music, to go with a "[[Bernard Herrmann]]–[[Alfred Hitchcock]]-type scary vibe", or to stick with "straight hip-hop, '90s stuff". Younge offered that there was "some intense thinking, but it wasn’t necessarily difficult to execute once we figured it out."&lt;ref name="LCVulture" /&gt;

===''Iron Fist''===
[[Trevor Morris (musician)|Trevor Morris]] was revealed to be composing the music for the first season of ''[[Iron Fist (TV series)|Iron Fist]]'' in late October 2016.&lt;ref name="Morris" /&gt; The producers of the series wanted a "modern" sounding score, so Morris focused on synthesizer sounds and made a rule that traditional orchestral instruments, such as strings and horns, would not be used for the series. He said that by "taking those heavy-hitters off the table, it leaves you to find a unique way to solve these problems. That sound is also very fashionable right now, which I think is great." Some of the synthesizer sounds were intended to acknowledge the title character's childhood iPod on which he listens to music from the 1990s. In terms of Asian influences on the score, Morris attempted to use several instruments to represent Asian culture, particularly for scenes set in a dojo or featuring Kung Fu, but "the producers didn’t like it. They thought it was too traditional." He ultimately used some Japanese flutes throughout the show, but after they were "heavily affected" digitally.&lt;ref name="MorrisAD" /&gt; Robert Lydecker replaced Morris as composer for the second season.&lt;ref name="Lydecker" /&gt;

===''The Defenders''===
In February 2017, Paesano was announced as returning to compose for the miniseries ''[[The Defenders (miniseries)|The Defenders]]''.&lt;ref name="PaesanoTD" /&gt;

===''Inhumans''===
At the 2017 [[San Diego Comic-Con]], Loeb announced Sean Callery as the composer for ''[[Inhumans (TV series)|Inhumans]]''.&lt;ref name="CalleryInhumans" /&gt;

===''The Punisher''===
In April 2017, Tyler Bates was announced as the composer for ''[[The Punisher (TV series)|The Punisher]]''.&lt;ref name="BatesPunisher" /&gt;

===''Runaways''===
In May 2017, [[Siddhartha Khosla]] was hired to compose the music for ''[[Runaways (TV series)|Runaways]]''.&lt;ref name="Khosla" /&gt;

===''Cloak &amp; Dagger''===
[[Mark Isham]] announced in May 2017 that he would compose the music for ''[[Cloak &amp; Dagger (TV series)|Cloak &amp; Dagger]]''.&lt;ref name="Isham" /&gt;

==Other==
===Marvel Studios fanfares===
After Marvel Entertainment was bought by the [[Walt Disney Company]] and Marvel Studios became its "own entity", without other companies working with them as distribution companies, the studio commissioned a new [[production logo]] for their films and television series starting with ''Thor: The Dark World'', the first film to feature solely the Marvel logo. Feige explained that "We didn’t want to re-invent the wheel [from the previous logo], but we wanted it to feel bigger, to feel more substantial, [and] like all great studio logos, you need a fanfare, and we’d never had that before." Therefore, Marvel commissioned Brian Tyler, who had just scored ''Iron Man 3'' and ''The Dark World'' for them, to compose a new "spectacular" fanfare to accompany the logo.&lt;ref name="Fanfare" /&gt;

When approaching the fanfare, Tyler looked not just at the films, but "Marvel as a whole...going all the way back from [[Human Torch (android)|The Human Torch]] through" the comics.&lt;ref name="TylerFanfare" /&gt; Because "there was very little time for the listener or the viewer to really hone in on what's there musically", Tyler "needed something that could be played a little bit more simply as a melody. Then all the orchestration—you know, I wrote these string lines that are actually, have kind of a fantastical, more complex nature to it. That just supports a melody that is more of [[Earworm|a whistler]]." Marvel agreed with this approach and worked with Tyler to hone the orchestration; "as the graphics were being done we really wanted to hit little moments with some sparkly shimmer and get it more specific." The main melody remained unchanged from Tyler's initial composition.&lt;ref name="TylerAoUIconic" /&gt;

In July 2016, Marvel introduced a new logo focusing on the film studio and featuring imagery from the MCU, rather than Marvel in general and its history in comic books. To accompany the new logo, first seen on ''Doctor Strange'', Michael Giacchino, the composer for ''Doctor Strange'', composed a new Marvel Studios fanfare.&lt;ref name="NewFanfare" /&gt; For ''Spider-Man: Homecoming'', the fanfare introduced with ''Doctor Strange'' was replaced by "[[Spider-Man (theme song)|Theme from Spider-Man (Original Television Series)]]", Giacchino's version of the theme from the [[Spider-Man (1967 TV series)|1967 cartoon series]].&lt;ref name="HomecomingIntro" /&gt;

===''Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe''===
Tyler composed for Marvel Studios once again in March 2014, by providing the music for the television special ''[[Marvel Cinematic Universe#Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe|Marvel Studios: Assembling a Universe]]''.&lt;ref name="AgeofUltron" /&gt;

===''A Mini Marvel''===
In February 2016, a commercial for [[Coca-Cola]] mini cans starring Ant-Man and the Hulk aired during [[Super Bowl 50]]. It was created through a partnership with Marvel, and directed by the Russo brothers.&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SuperBowl50Coke2" /&gt; The ad was scored by ''Ant-Man'' composer Christophe Beck and Jeff Morrow, who had contributed additional material to ''Ant-Man''.&lt;ref name="BeckFMM" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CokeBeck" /&gt;

===Original songs===
===="Make Way For Tomorrow, Today"====
''Iron Man 2'' introduces the 1974 Stark Expo, based on the [[1964 New York World's Fair]].&lt;ref name="FavreauExpo" /&gt; [[Richard M. Sherman]], who wrote many Disney songs with his brother [[Robert B. Sherman|Robert]], wrote the original song "Make Way For Tomorrow, Today" to serve as the in-universe theme for the Stark Expo. Sherman described [[Howard Stark]], the character who created the Expo, as "a cross between [[Walt Disney]] and [[Howard Hughes]]", noting that Disney was himself involved in the creation of the 1964 World's Fair. He continued, "The filmmakers wanted a Disney-esque song to be the theme song of the Stark Expo," admitting that the song was inspired by his own "[[There's a Great Big Beautiful Tomorrow]]", which was written for the [[Carousel of Progress]] attraction that Disney created for the World's Fair.&lt;ref name="Sherman" /&gt; "Make Way For Tomorrow, Today" is heard again in ''Captain America: The First Avenger'', when an earlier version of the Stark Expo appears, with Sherman noting of the reprisal, "different style, same song".&lt;ref name="FavreauExpo" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sherman" /&gt;

===="Star Spangled Man"====
''Captain America: The First Avenger'' features a montage of the titular character and a [[chorus line]] touring the U.S., performing a song-and-dance number to the patriotic song "Star Spangled Man".&lt;ref name="StarSpangledManMenken" /&gt; The song was written for the film by [[Alan Menken]] and lyricist [[David Zippel]], and recorded by the [[Metro Voices]].&lt;ref name="StarSpangledManRelease" /&gt; Menken had wanted to provide the score for the film as well, but was unable to due to scheduling conflicts, so they wrote the song before the film began [[principal photography]] (a process Menken would use on an animated film), and hoped that it would mesh with Alan Silvestri's score. Menken said the song "screamed out for [[Irving Berlin]], in the sense of "[[This Is the Army|This Is The Army, Mr. Jones]]" or "[[God Bless America]]". It should be patriotic and it should be fun. The goal was to come up with orchestration that felt authentic to the ‘40s, [[USO]] [experience]."&lt;ref name="StarSpangledManMenken" /&gt; Christopher Lennertz conducted a new arrangement of the song for the first season of ''Agent Carter'', where it is used as the theme music of a 1940s Captain America radio drama.&lt;ref name="StarSpangledManAC" /&gt;

===="Theme from ''Caged Heat'' 1985"====
For ''All Hail the King'', [[Drew Pearce]] created a fictional [[CBS]] 1980s [[television pilot]] titled ''Caged Heat'' (starring Ben Kingsley's [[Trevor Slattery]] character),&lt;ref name="CagedHeatCBR"/&gt; and Feige encouraged him "to go off. The whole purpose of Trevor is to go off the rails." Feige and Marvel subsequently suggested that Pearce create a full title sequence for the pilot.&lt;ref name="CagedHeatMW" /&gt; Feige's love of film soundtracks "started when I had a little tape recorder and I would tape the themes to ''[[Simon and Simon]]'' and ''[[The A-Team]]'' and play it back, and those were all [[Mike Post]]",&lt;ref name="CagedHeatCBR" /&gt; so Pearce contacted Post about using one of his old themes for the sequence. Because Post had sold the rights to all of the themes he had written, and felt that none of them fit the "Russian ''[[Magnum P.I.]]''" tone that Pearce was aiming for anyway, he offered to write a new theme specifically for the project. Post recorded the theme music on the same equipment he used for his iconic 1980s series' themes.&lt;ref name="CagedHeatMW" /&gt;

===="Watcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)"====
The ''Agent Carter'' episode "[[A Little Song and Dance]]" begins with a dream sequence that begins in black and white, before transitioning to color in "true ''[[The Wizard of Oz (1939 film)|Wizard of Oz]]'' fashion" for a [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]-style dance number featuring an original song from composer Christopher Lennertz and lyricist David Zippel, in conjunction with series executive producers Tara Butters and Michele Fazekas.&lt;ref name="ACSongReveal" /&gt;&lt;ref name="ACSongRelease" /&gt; Titled "Watcha Gonna Do (It's Up to You)", the song was performed by actors [[Enver Gjokaj]] and [[Hayley Atwell]].&lt;ref name="ACSongRelease" /&gt; On working with Zippel, Lennertz said, "It was such a thrill to collaborate on a song with David. His musical style blended well with the jazzy musical tone we were going for, especially on this episode."&lt;ref name="LennertzSong" /&gt;

===="Bulletproof Love"====
The first season of ''Luke Cage'' sees [[Method Man]] make a guest appearance in the episode "[[Luke Cage (TV series)#ep12|Soliloquy of Chaos]]",&lt;ref name="LC112" /&gt; in which he witnesses the heroics of the title character. The artist then goes on to make an original rap song in the episode titled "Bulletproof Love", which he performs himself.&lt;ref name="BulletproofLove" /&gt; The actual track was arranged by the series' composers, Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad, for Method Man, and includes much of the socio-political commentary that showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker wished to convey throughout the series. It is accompanied in the episode by a montage of "black men walking the streets in Cage’s signature 'bulletproof' hoodie".&lt;ref name="BulletproofLove" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LC112" /&gt;

===="Guardians Inferno"====
''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' features an original song in the film's credits. Co-written by the film's writer and director [[James Gunn]] and score composer [[Tyler Bates]], it was "meant as a sort of ''Guardians'' take on [[Meco]]'s disco ''[[Star Wars]]'' theme ["[[Star Wars Theme/Cantina Band]]"]."&lt;ref name="AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate" /&gt; [[David Hasselhoff]] was chosen as the vocalist because he is one of [[Star-Lord|Peter Quill]]'s childhood heroes, and Gunn was a fan of Hasselhoff when he starred on ''[[Knight Rider (1982 TV series)|Knight Rider]]''.&lt;ref name="AwesomeMixVol2ReleaseDate" /&gt;&lt;ref name="HasselhoffET" /&gt;

===="I Want Your Cray Cray"====
In a flashback during the second season of ''Jessica Jones'', former child star [[Patsy Walker|Trish Walker]] is shown to have had a brief pop-star career, during which she released a song titled "I Want Your Cray Cray". Performed by [[Rachael Taylor]], who portrays Walker in the series, and Kandi Marks, the song was described as "sufficiently addictive" by Taylor, who noted that the sequence was explaining why Walker is "going in a number of different directions ... She's been made to feel in her life that she was not respected. She was [a drug] addict. It emotionally explains a lot about what season two is".&lt;ref name="JJS2Soundtrack" /&gt;&lt;ref name="CrayCray" /&gt;

====Vinyl releases====
In July 2016, ''Luke Cage'' showrunner Cheo Hodari Coker revealed plans for a vinyl soundtrack album for the series, to be produced by composers Adrian Younge and Ali Shaheed Muhammad.&lt;ref name="CokerTCA2016" /&gt; The vinyl release was made available from Mondo on October 7, 2016, pressed on yellow vinyl and with collectible artwork by Matthew Woodson.&lt;ref name="VinylRelease" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MondoRelease" /&gt; On October 8, Mondo announced that its entire initial pressing of the release had already been sold out, with further orders to begin shipping in late November.&lt;ref name="MondoTweet" /&gt; On November 7, vinyl releases for the soundtracks to ''Daredevil'' season one and ''Jessica Jones'' season one were announced by Mondo, pressed on red and purple vinyl, respectively. Each release was limited to 3000 copies, also comes with collectible artwork by Woodson, and was made available on November 9 both online and at the [[Alamo Drafthouse Cinema]] in [[Brooklyn, New York]]. The latter is "the first theater in the Alamo Drafthouse chain to include a permanent record rack inside the theater’s bar where select Mondo vinyl releases will be available on the same day they are released online." To celebrate the release of the new soundtracks, Mondo held an event at the House of Wax bar in Brooklyn on November 9, selling copies of all three albums to a live DJ set by Younge.&lt;ref name="MondoDDJJ" /&gt; Additionally, Mondo released posters of Woodson's art on November 10, [[screen printing|screen prints]] "featuring a layer of spot varnish to bring different elements of the illustration to life."&lt;ref name="MondoPosters" /&gt; Mondo released the ''Iron Fist'' season one soundtrack on both green and black vinyl on August 18, 2017. The release once again included original art by Woodson, which was additionally released as a poster.&lt;ref name="MondoIF" /&gt;&lt;/noinclude&gt;

;''AC/DC: Iron Man 2'' : Director Jon Favreau had used songs from [[hard rock]] band [[AC/DC]] in the first ''Iron Man'' film, and had been inspired at an AC/DC concert to introduce Iron Man in the sequel during a concert-like event. Favreau said on the band, "What’s fun about them is they were the full-on real deal of heavy metal when I was in high school. They were as real deal as it got. They made some people nervous—people questioned whether they were devil worshipers or not. And now these days they put on the same show...and there’s a sense of humor about the whole thing....there’s even a strange gentleness to the music to me now, even though at the time it was as edgy as you get. It’s celebrating immaturity and youth" in a similar way to the character of Tony Stark.&lt;ref name="FavreauACDC" /&gt; In January 2010, Marvel announced that AC/DC's music would be featured heavily in ''Iron Man 2'' in a collaboration with Columbia Records, who released a soundtrack album for the film featuring 15 classic AC/DC songs.&lt;ref name="MarvelACDC" /&gt;
;''Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' : In February 2014, director James Gunn revealed that ''Guardians of the Galaxy'' would incorporate songs from the 1960s and 1970s, such as "[[Hooked on a Feeling]]", on a [[mixtape]] in protagonist [[Peter Quill]]'s [[Walkman]], which acts as a way for him to stay connected to the Earth, home, and family he lost.&lt;ref name="TotalFilmTrailer6" /&gt; When choosing the songs, Gunn read the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' charts for all of the top hits of the 1970s, downloading "a few hundred" songs that were "semi-familiar—ones you recognize but might not be able to name off the top of your head" and creating a playlist for all the songs that would fit the film tonally. Gunn then chose the songs for the film by listening to the playlist and being "inspired to create a scene around a song", or by having "a scene that needed music and I would listen through the playlist, visualizing various songs, figuring out which would work the best." Many of the chosen songs were played on set to help "the actors and the camera operators find the perfect groove for the shot", with [[David Bowie]]'s "[[Moonage Daydream]]" the only song chosen and added during post-production.&lt;ref name="VultureMusic" /&gt; In addition to the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' album, Hollywood Records released a cassette version of the soundtrack on November 28, 2014, as an exclusive to [[Record Store Day]] participants. The cassette was the first from [[Disney Music Group]] since 2003.&lt;ref name="AwesomeMixCassette" /&gt;
;''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2: Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' : Gunn said he felt "a little pressure" in creating the ''Awesome Mix Vol. 2'' mixtape for ''Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2'' "because so many people loved [the first film's soundtrack] and we went platinum and all that other stuff. But I feel like the soundtrack in the second one is better,"&lt;ref name="SoundtrackFeelings" /&gt; with all of the songs chosen and built into the script by June 2015.&lt;ref name="GunnVol2June2015" /&gt; In January 2016, Gunn revealed that he had chosen an additional Bowie song to appear in the film, but had cut the original scene it was featured in. The inclusion would have made Bowie the only artist to be featured on both mixtapes. With Bowie's death that month, Gunn hoped to find a way to include the chosen song elsewhere in the film as a "fair and appropriate" way to honor him, as Bowie was one of Gunn's idols.&lt;ref name="Vol2Bowie" /&gt; Gunn described the soundtrack as "more diverse" than that for the first ''Guardians'', which had "a bunch of songs that maybe you heard but didn’t know the name of the song–you didn’t know the name of the singer. In this one, we have some really incredibly famous songs and then some songs that people have never heard."&lt;ref name="GunnVol2Dec2016" /&gt;
[[File:Kendrick Lamar Pitchfork 2012.jpg|thumb|alt=Kendrick Lamar|upright|right|Kendrick Lamar produced and curated ''Black Panther: The Album''.]]
;''Black Panther: The Album'' : [[Kendrick Lamar]] produced the film's curated soundtrack, along with [[Top Dawg Entertainment]] founder Anthony Tiffith. It was the first MCU soundtrack to "integrate multiple original recordings created specifically for the film".&lt;ref name="BPSoundtrack" /&gt; ''Black Panther: The Album'' was released on February 9, 2018.&lt;ref name="BPAlbumReleaseDate" /&gt;

==Reception==
===Charts and certifications===
''AC/DC: Iron Man 2'' debuted on the [[Billboard 200|''Billboard'' 200]] chart at number four.&lt;ref name="ACDCChart" /&gt; On February 14, 2012, the album was [[RIAA certification|certified Gold]] by the [[Recording Industry Association of America|RIAA]], for selling over 500,000 copies.&lt;ref name="ACDCGold" /&gt; In August 2014, ''Guardians of the Galaxy: Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' had reached the top of the ''Billboard'' 200 chart in its second week of release, becoming the first soundtrack album in history consisting entirely of previously released songs to top the chart.&lt;ref name="AwesomeMixChart" /&gt; Eight weeks after its release in September 2014, ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' was certified Gold by the RIAA,&lt;ref name="Vol1Gold" /&gt; and in January 2015, it was certified Platinum for selling over 1 million copies.&lt;ref name="Vol1Platinum" /&gt; ''Awesome Mix Vol. 1'' also peaked at number one on the ''Billboard'' Top Soundtracks,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Grein|first1=Paul|title=Chart Watch: J.J.

===Analysis===
In October 2014, John Coggin looked back on the music of the Marvel Cinematic Universe so far for ''[[International Policy Digest]]''. He felt that the music was a major failing of the shared universe, especially in comparison to other major franchises such as ''Star Wars'' and ''The Lord of the Rings'', because of a lack of "strong fanfares" for the films' heroes and a lack of continuity between the different scores. He felt that Patrick Doyle's ''Thor'' was the best in terms of "thematic strength and unity", while other films did not develop their own musical themes in a memorable way, and found it "remarkable" that Brian Tyler completely discarded all of Doyle's themes. Coggin ended his piece by noting that the MCU was "still young", and "in time, Marvel can and should develop bolder themes for its individual heroes. It should establish some thematic continuity between films."&lt;ref name="CogginReview" /&gt; Emily Asher-Perrin, writing for ''[[Tor.com]]'', discussed the issue of musical continuity further. She pointed out how continuity between films was such an important aspect of the MCU for Marvel, and therefore found it confusing that the "same consistency wasn’t applied to their soundtracks". Raising numerous examples of other franchises recalling thematic material to great effect, Asher-Perrin opined that the lack of continuity in the scores was not only "off-putting", but a missed opportunity for Marvel and the cohesiveness of the franchise.&lt;ref name="AsherPerrinReview" /&gt;

{{Listen
| filename    = Alan Silvestri MCU Themes.ogg

| description = Alan Silvestri's "Captain America March" (0:00 - 0:17) and "The Avengers" (0:17 - 0:33) are considered some of the more memorable themes from the MCU.&lt;ref name="FilmtracksAoU" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SlashSilvestri" /&gt;
| pos         = left
}}
Christian Clemmenson of [[Filmtracks.com]] agreed that the scores for the Marvel films "always struggled to form any kind of cohesive identity". He felt that Silvestri had been the most successful composer at creating memorable themes, and saw Tyler's work for ''Iron Man 3'' and ''Thor: The Dark World'' as strong in establishing an appropriate tone for the franchise by "combining the masculinity of the Hans Zimmer blockbuster expectations from the studio with the Jerry Goldsmith rhythmic flair that actually (still) works".&lt;ref name="FilmtracksAoU" /&gt; Clemmenson did criticize Tyler's work on ''The Dark World'' for his "inexplicable" replacing of Doyle's themes with his own "generic" ones,&lt;ref name="FilmtracksTDW" /&gt; and subsequently praised the composer's efforts on ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' to maintain the sound that he previously established while reusing Silvestri's previous themes as well as his own. He also highlighted the way that Danny Elfman adapted and evolved Silvestri's Avengers theme for that film, "rather than simply arranging it for regurgitation". Despite this praise, Clemmenson ultimately only called the ''Age of Ultron'' score "functional", and felt that the way the music was edited and used in the film was "an absolute mess", an issue he saw with many of the MCU scores.&lt;ref name="FilmtracksAoU" /&gt;

At Flickering Myth, Simon Columb responded to a description of Tyler's scores for ''Iron Man 3'' and ''Thor: The Dark World'' as "alright" with an opinion piece titled "The Forgettable Soundtrack to Marvel’s Movies". He argued that film music is such a "core element" that the scores deserve more criticism than a dismissive "alright"; he felt that all MCU scores were "consistently below par ... the soundtracks have always felt unclear, confused and inconsistent." He also touched on the lack of continuity, lamenting the missed opportunity to "use the themes and music to carve out a consistent harmonic atmosphere".&lt;ref name="ColumbReview" /&gt; [[/Film]]'s Jacob Hall focused on the quality of the MCU's music, describing it as "the musical equivalent of vanilla pudding. No single MCU movie features identifiable music and that’s a shame." Hall hoped that the hiring of Michael Giacchino, whom he called "one of the most talented and celebrated modern composers of music for film and television", and the rehiring of Silvestri, who he felt had composed the only memorable and recognizable theme with his "Captain America March", during Marvel's [[List of Marvel Cinematic Universe films#Phase Three|Phase Three]] slate of films would change this trend, particularly hoping that Giacchino could "bring some much-needed magic to the MCU".&lt;ref name="SlashGiacchino" /&gt;&lt;ref name="SlashSilvestri" /&gt;

In September 2016, the YouTube channel Every Frame a Painting, which analyzes films and the filmmaking process, posted a video essay discussing the music of the MCU. The video also highlights the lack of memorability for general audience members compared to franchises such as ''Star Wars'' and ''James Bond'', and proposes several reasons for why this is: the tendency for the music to be background noise, or to be "hidden" behind other sounds such as voiceovers; how it closely reflects the events on screen, and so does not stand out or surprise the audience; and how it is often similar to other music, which the video blames on the temp process and filmmakers editing the film to the temp music before bringing in the composer, or asking composers to imitate the temp tracks. Saying that the music is not bad, just "bland and inoffensive", the video states that Marvel could improve their music by simply taking more risks with it, like putting more emphasis on the music without any other sound effects, or mismatching it with the visuals—for example, playing "emotional" music during an otherwise "humorous" scene to give more impact to the underlying feelings of the characters rather than their surface actions.&lt;ref name="MSUessay" /&gt;

'''Musopen''' Inc. is a [[501(c)(3) organization|501(c)(3)]] non-profit organization located in [[Tarzana, California]], launched by Aaron Dunn in 2005. It aims to "set music [[free content|free]]" by providing music to the public free of charge, without copyright restrictions.

Some content is available free of charge with limitations and registration is required.

== Mission and charitable activities ==

Musopen provides an online library of [[public domain]] music recordings and sheet music.  It also raises money to finance classical music recordings which are released into the public domain.

In 2008, Musopen released newly commissioned recordings of the 32 [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]] piano sonatas into the public domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://arstechnica.com/old/content/2008/05/musopen-puts-classical-recordings-scores-in-public-domain.ars |title=Musopen puts classical recordings, scores in public domain |publisher=Ars Technica |date=22 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, the site organized a fundraiser via [[Kickstarter]] to commission recordings of a larger repertoire,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://entertainment.slashdot.org/story/10/09/12/1350202/Orchestra-To-Turn-Copyright-Free-Classical-Scores-Into-Copyright-Free-Music |title=Orchestra To Turn Copyright Free Classical Scores Into Copyright Free Music |publisher=Slashdot |date=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising a total of $68,359, more than six times their initial target of $11,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Musopen/record-and-release-free-music-without-copyrights |title=Musopen: Record and release free music without copyrights. |author=Dunn, Aaron |publisher=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2012, Musopen announced that the editing of the recordings was finished,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Musopen/record-and-release-free-music-without-copyrights/posts/266390 |title=Done! |author=Dunn, Aaron |date=13 July 2012 |publisher=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt; after which the audio files were uploaded to its website and [[Archive.org]]. The final list of music was announced in August 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Musopen/record-and-release-free-music-without-copyrights/posts/288525 |title=Done and Done |author=Dunn, Aaron |date=15 August 2012 |publisher=Kickstarter}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2013, a new Kickstarter fundraiser was launched by Musopen to record the complete works of [[Frédéric Chopin]]. The fundraiser was successful, exceeding the funding goal of $75,000 by over $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/Musopen/set-chopin-free | title=Set Chopin Free | publisher=Aaron Dunn/Kickstarter | accessdate=11 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All recording for this project has been finished and editing was completed in April 2015.

== Online music library ==
Musopen operates under a [[freemium]] model, in that some content is available free of charge, but premium downloads (HD) require a subscription. Sheet music is available for download to all for free, and recordings can be played using an [[HTML5]] or [[Adobe Flash|Flash]] player. Non-paying users can download music recordings but are restricted to 5 downloads per day; members paying $55 per year receive unlimited downloads of losslessly encoded music; and "benefactors" paying $240 per year may in addition request recordings (as of October 2018).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://musopen.org/page/signup/|title=Sign Up|author=Musopen Inc.|accessdate=1 Jan 2014}} ([https://www.webcitation.org/6MJCf5hIU archived])&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Oleg Konstantinovich Popov''' ({{lang-ru|Олег Константинович Попoв}}, 31 July 1930 – 2 November 2016) was a Soviet and Russian [[clown]] and [[circus]] artist. [[People's Artist of the USSR]] (1969).

==Early life==
Popov was born on 31 July 1930, the son of a clock-repairman. At age 12, he began working as an apprentice typographer for the newspaper ''Pravda'', and he later joined ''Pravda'''s Athletic Club. There, in 1945, someone suggested that he apply for Moscow's State College of Circus and Variety Arts (better known as the "Moscow Circus School"). He was accepted and studied acrobatics, juggling, and other circus skills there, graduating in 1949. He made his debut at the [[Tbilisi Circus]] in the [[Georgian SSR]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borrero|first1=Mauricio|title=Russia: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present|date=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=0816074755|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, he continued his career at the [[Moscow Circus on Tsvetnoy Boulevard]] (today Circus Nikulin).

In 1955, Popov performed abroad for the first time, in Warsaw, and the following year, he toured with the [[Moscow Circus]] in France, Belgium, and England, and was immediately noticed by the press, which made him a circus star. The Soviet regime quickly built on his success abroad and transformed him into a goodwill ambassador for the Soviet Union. He appeared in 1958 at the Brussels World Fair, and in 1957, he was broadcast from Moscow on American television. He toured the United States in 1963 and 1972 with the Moscow Circus. In 1969, Popov was honored with the title of [[People's Artist of the USSR]]. He toured extensively around the world in subsequent years with the Moscow Circus. In Australia, he was named ''[[Moomba|King of Moomba]]'' (1971).&lt;ref&gt;Craig Bellamy, Gordon Chisholm, Hilary Eriksen (17 February 2006) [http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/Moomba/History%20of%20Moomba.pdf ''Moomba: A festival for the people.''] pp. 17–22 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091028203816/http://www.melbourne.vic.gov.au/rsrc/PDFs/Moomba/History%20of%20Moomba.pdf |date=28 October 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
[[File:Oleg Popov 1979d.jpg|thumb|235px|Oleg Popov in Amsterdam in 1979|left]]Popov performed as a [[clown]], combining his talents as a [[Mime artist|mime]], a [[Tightrope walking|tightrope walker]], and a [[Juggling|juggler]]. At the 8th [[International Circus Festival of Monte-Carlo]] in 1981, he received the coveted Gold Clown award as a tribute to his stellar career.&lt;ref name="ОП"&gt;[http://www.newsru.com/cinema/01jul2015/mastersochi.html Первую международную цирковую премию «Мастер» вручили в Сочи артистам из России, Италии, Германии и Китая]&lt;/ref&gt; His clown character followed the tradition of the Russian folk character "Ivanushka," who fools other people and who is teased himself.&lt;ref name="ОП"/&gt;

In the early 1990s, at the fall of the Soviet Union, he began touring for a few years with a unit of the Moscow Circus in Germany, where he eventually resettled. He later performed extensively in Germany, in circus shows, on television, or with his own touring show. He married Gabriela Lehmann, a German circus performer, in 1991, she is 32 years younger than her husband. In 2006, Popov was invited to perform at the 30th anniversary of the International Circus Festival of Monte Carlo. Aged 75 years of age, he received a standing ovation.&lt;ref name="ОП"/&gt;

In 2015, he returned for the first time to Russia after 28 years of living in Germany; it was at the First "Master" gala event (the Russian circus equivalent of the [[Academy Awards|Oscars]] ceremony) at the State Circus of [[Sochi]], where he was greeted with a long standing ovation. The Russian Minister of Culture, [[Vladimir Medinsky]] read a welcoming message from President [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name="ОП"/&gt; In December 2015 he was back to Russia again – now to become one of the judges at the final show of “The Blue Bird” contest – a young talent competition on [[Russia-1|Russia 1]] TV channel. He also [http://russia.tv/video/show/brand_id/59588/episode_id/1258123/video_id/1419124/ teamed up with Artem Shilo] – a young pianist and one of the contestants – to support him in the competition.&lt;ref name="ОП"/&gt;

Popov appeared in four films, ''Арена Смелых'' (''[[Ring of Daring]]'', 1953), ''Ma-ma'' (1977), ''The Blue Bird'' (1976) and ''Ritzar bez bronya'' (Poland, 1966). He published a book of memoirs in 1967, which has been widely translated into numerous languages including English (as "Russian Clown", 1970). From a first marriage with a violinist, Alexandra, Oleg Popov had a daughter, Olga (b. 1953).

Popov died on 2 November 2016, from a cardiac arrest while on tour, at a hotel in [[Rostov-on-Don]] at the age of 86.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url =https://ria.ru/culture/20161103/1480579224.html|title=Причиной смерти клоуна Олега Попова стала остановка сердца|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]| language=Russian| accessdate =3 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Oriental riff''', also known as the '''East Asian riff''', is a musical [[riff]] or [[Phrase (music)|phrase]] that has often been used in Western culture as a [[trope (literature)|trope]] or [[stereotype]] of [[orientalism]] to represent the idea of Mainland China, Japan, Korea, or Taiwan or a generic East Asian theme. The riff is sometimes accompanied by the sound of a [[gong]].

== History ==
The Oriental riff is a [[Western culture#Music|Western]] invention,&lt;ref name="chinoiserie.atspace.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Musical Cliché Figure Signifying the Far East|url=http://chinoiserie.atspace.com/}}&lt;/ref&gt; dating back to the "Aladdin Quick Step" used in an ''[[Aladdin]]'' stage show, ''The Grand Chinese Spectacle of Aladdin or The Wonderful Lamp'', in 1847.&lt;ref name="Hyphen"&gt;{{cite web|title=Interrogasian: Hyphen’s sensei of sensibility answers your questions about Asian culture|work=[[Hyphen (magazine)|Hyphen]]|issue=19|url=http://www.hyphenmagazine.com/magazine/issue-19-trailblazing/interrogasian|accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radio: Light Programme|date=7 June 2010|author=Lisa Martland|work=[[The Stage]]|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/28494/radio-light-programme|accessdate=2011-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notes used in the riff are part of a [[Pentatonic scale#Major pentatonic scale|pentatonic scale]] and often harmonized with parallel open fourths, which makes the riff sound like [[East Asian music]] to a typical Western listener.

== Uses ==
The Oriental riff and interpretations of the Oriental riff have been included as part of numerous musical works in Western music. Examples of its use include "[[Kung Fu Fighting]]" by [[Carl Douglas]] and [[Biddu]] (1974),&lt;ref name="Adoption"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyphen"/&gt; [[The Vapors]]' "[[Turning Japanese]]",&lt;ref name="Hyphen" /&gt; and [[Rush (band)|Rush]]'s "[[A Passage to Bangkok]]".&lt;ref name="Hyphen"/&gt; The Oriental riff has also been adapted for use as video game ''[[Yie Ar Kung-Fu]]''{{'}}s main theme, the Chai Kingdom theme in ''[[Super Mario Land]]'' and the fighting theme of  the Kung-Fu chapter in ''[[Live A Live]]''.

The riff was also used in an Eastern series, the Japanese anime ''[[The Super Dimension Fortress Macross]]''. The song Shao Pai Long depicts a Chinese hero.

In [[game theory]], an '''outcome''' is a situation which results from a combination of player's strategies. Every combination of strategies (one for each player) is an outcome of the game. A primary purpose of game theory is to determine which outcomes are stable according to a solution concept (e.g. [[Nash equilibria]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gametheory.net/dictionary/Outcome.html|title=Outcome - Game Theory .net|first=Mike|last=Shor|website=www.gametheory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a game where chance or a random event is involved, the outcome is not known from only the set of strategies, but is only realized when the random event(s) are [[Realization (probability)|realized]].

A set of payoffs can be considered a set of N-tuples, where ''N'' is the number of players in the game, and the cardinality of the set is equal to the total number of possible outcomes when the strategies of the players are varied.  The payoff set can thus be [[Partially ordered set|partially ordered]], where the partial ordering comes from the value of each entry in the N-tuple.  How players interact to allocate the payoffs among themselves is a fundamental aspect of [[economics]].

==Choosing among outcomes==

Many different concepts exist to express how players might interact.  An optimal interaction may be one in which no player's payoff can be made greater, without making any other player's payoff lesser.  Such a payoff is described as [[Pareto efficiency|Pareto efficient]], and the set of such payoffs is called the Pareto frontier.

Many economists study the ways in which payoffs are in some sort of [[economic equilibrium]].  One example of such an equilibrium is the [[Nash equilibrium]], where each player plays a strategy such that their payoff is maximized given the strategy of the other players.

==Applications==

Equilibria are not always Pareto efficient, and a number of game theorists design ways to enforce Pareto efficient play, or play that satisfies some other sort of social optimality.  The theory of this is called [[implementation theory]].  Other economists seek to design games based on a certain set of outcomes, an effort which goes under the name of [[mechanism design]].

'''Quinze''', ''Quince'', also known as Ace-low, is a 17th-century French [[card game]] of Spanish origin that was much patronized in some parts of Europe. It is considered a forerunner of the French [[Vingt-et-un]], a game very popular at the court of [[Louis XV]],&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Dictionary of Card Games, David Parlett, p.218 - Oxford University Press {{ISBN|0-19-869173-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and also a two-player simplification of the modern game of [[Blackjack]].&lt;ref&gt;Scarne on Card Games, p. 196, John Scane, Dover Publications, NY 2004 {{ISBN|0-486-43603-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The game ==

Quinze is generally admired for its simplicity and fairness, depending entirely upon chance, and not requiring the attention of most other games on the cards, and therefore calculated for those who love to sport upon an equal hazard.&lt;ref&gt;Hoyle, Edmund; and L. Dawson. ''Hoyle's Card Games'', Routledge, 1979, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; It is a card game of chance in which players compete with each other to acquire a hand of 15 points or as close to 15 as possible, hence the game is also known as Fifteen.&lt;ref&gt;Webster's Revised Unabridged Dictionary, published 1913 by C. &amp; G. Merriam Co.&lt;/ref&gt; It is usually played by two persons only, with a full pack of 52 cards.

== The play ==

The cards are shuffled by both players and when they have it cut for deal, which falls to the lot of that who cuts the lowest card, being Ace low and King high, the dealer is then free to shuffle them again. When this is done, the adversary cuts them, after which the dealer gives one card to his opponent and one to himself.&lt;ref&gt;The Modern Pocket Hoyle, p. 190, William Brisbane Dick - Dick &amp; Fitzgerald, NY 1868&lt;/ref&gt;

Should the dealer's adversary not approve of his card, he is entitled to have as many cards given to him, one after the other, as will make fifteen, or come nearest to that number, which are usually given from the top of the pack. That is, if the player is dealt a Two and then a Five, which amounts to seven, he must continue going on in expectation of coming nearer to fifteen. If he is dealt an Eight, which will make just fifteen, he, as having the best hand, is sure of winning the game. But if he is overdealt and makes more than fifteen, he loses, unless the dealer should do the same, in which case it is a drawn game, and the players double their stakes thus going on until one of them has won the game by being exactly fifteen or by standing as closest to this.&lt;ref&gt;The Dictionary of Gambling and Gaming, p. 171 - Thomas L. Clark - 1988 - 263 str.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the conclusion of each game, the cards are put up and shuffled and the players cut again for deal, and the elder then taken on the advantage of dealing the cards.

'''''Robot Wars''''' is a [[robot combat]] competition that was broadcast on [[British television]] from 1998 to 2004 and again from 2016 to 2018. The series, centred on the sport of robot combat, involves teams of amateur and professional roboteers operating their own constructed [[remote control]]led robots to fight against each other, whilst also avoiding arena hazards and more powerful "House Robots", which were not bound by the same weight or weapon limits as the contestants. Earlier series included assault and trial courses for competing robots before they were ceased from the first "Extreme" series onwards.

The show was first broadcast on [[BBC Two]] from 20 February 1998 to 23 February 2001, on [[BBC Choice]] from 8 October 2001 to 7 February 2003 (later repeated on BBC Two), on [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] from 2 November 2003 to 28 March 2004 before being revived in 2016 and broadcast on BBC Two from 24 July 2016 to 7 January 2018. To date, the show has been broadcast as 10 main series each centred around a single competition, two "Extreme" series with several unconnected events and several special episodes.

[[Jeremy Clarkson]] presented the first series, with "Master of Mayhem" [[Craig Charles]] taking over for the second to seventh series. [[Philippa Forrester]] co-hosted the first three series, the fifth and Extreme 2. Forrester also hosted the spin-off series ''Robot Wars Revealed'' from 1998 to 1999. The fourth series and Extreme 1 were co-hosted by [[Julia Reed]] and the seventh by [[Jayne Middlemiss]]. [[Jonathan Pearce]] provided commentary for all series. The revived series were hosted by [[Dara Ó Briain]] and [[Angela Scanlon]].

Additional series were filmed at the UK venue for specific sectors of the global market, including two series of ''Robot Wars Extreme Warriors'' with [[United States|American]] competitors for the [[Spike TV|TNN network]] (hosted by [[Mick Foley]] with [[Rebecca Grant (American actress)|Rebecca Grant]] serving as pit reporter), two of ''Dutch Robot Wars'' for distribution in the [[Netherlands]] and a single series for Germany. The fourth series of the UK ''Robot Wars'' was shown in the US on TNN as ''Robot Wars: Grand Champions'' in 2002 and hosted by [[Chyna|Joanie Laurer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tv.com/robot-wars-grand-champions/show/11245/summary.html |title=Robot Wars: Grand Champions |publisher=TV.com |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Its merchandising was commercially successful, being one of the most popular selling toy ranges in 2002. It included a mini arena, pullback, friction and ripcord toys and radio-controlled versions of the House Robots.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/pressoffice/bbcworldwide/worldwidestories/pressreleases/2002/05_may/robot_wars_xbox.shtml |title=Robot Wars Activated on Xbox |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, the roboteers themselves formed ''The Fighting Robot Association'' and with their associated event organizers, carry on participating in competitions for new audiences. In 2013, Roaming Robots purchased the rights to the ''Robot Wars'' brand from Robot Wars LLC and operated their travelling robotic combat show under that name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.roamingrobots.co.uk/newsrobotwars |title=Home - Robot Wars |website=Roamingrobots.co.uk |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The use of the name ''Robot Wars'' for live shows ceased in early 2017, being renamed ''Extreme Robots''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.extremerobots.co.uk/history |title=History |publisher=Extreme Robots |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With a peak audience of six million viewers in the UK during the late 1990s, the format went on to become a worldwide success, showing in 45 countries including the US, Australia, Canada, China, India, Germany and Italy. In March 2003, it was dropped by [[BBC Two]] after eight series and [[Mentorn]] announced it was making 22 episodes for Channel 5,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/tv_and_radio/2883697.stm|title=Entertainment - Robot Wars leaves BBC|publisher=BBC|date=25 March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; concluding with The Third World Championships broadcast in March 2004. Channel 5 later axed the show after one series due to low ratings.

In July 2016, the show returned to BBC Two with a new arena, house robots and presenters. The first episode was well received becoming the top trending topic on [[Twitter]] that evening and having two million viewers, more than the last episode of the 23rd series of ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]'' in the same 8pm Sunday slot just a few weeks earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=John Plunkett |url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2016/jul/25/bbc2s-robot-wars-more-viewers-than-top-gear-reboot-finale |title=BBC2's Robot Wars attracts more viewers than Top Gear reboot finale &amp;#124; Media |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revived show ran for three series, before it ended in March 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2018/03/16/robot-wars-cancelled-bbc-three-series-7393630/|title=Robot Wars has been cancelled by the BBC after three series|date=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
===US Robot Wars events===
''Robot Wars'' was the brainchild of Marc Thorpe, a designer working for the LucasToys division of [[Lucasfilm]].&lt;ref name=marcthorpe&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.marcthorpe.com/robot.html |title=Robot Wars History |accessdate=2006-11-19 |work=Marc Thorpe}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992, Thorpe had the initial idea for robot combat sport after unsuccessfully attempting to create a radio-controlled vacuum cleaner.&lt;ref name=robotcombat&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.robotcombat.com/history.html |title=Robot Wars History |accessdate=2006-11-19 |work=RobotCombat.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Marc Thorpe created ''Robot Wars'' and held the first competition at the [[Fort Mason Center]] in [[San Francisco]]. Approximately one month prior to the event, Thorpe formed a partnership with New York-based record company Sm:)e Communications, later [[Profile Records]], who provided additional funding.&lt;ref name=marcthorpe /&gt;

Between 1995 and 1997, three further ''Robot Wars'' events took place in America and in 1995, Profile Records partnered with production company Mentorn to produce and televise a ''Robot Wars'' event in the UK. Mentorn acquired the worldwide television rights from Profile in 1995 after [[Tom Gutteridge]] (the head of Mentorn) had seen an amateur tape of a San Francisco event.

===Original television series===
[[File:Robot Wars.jpg|thumb|right|Original ''Robot Wars'' logo from 1997 to 2004]]
[[File:Razer side-on view.jpg|thumb|Razer, one of the most successful robots in the original series. It had the ability to puncture competitors.]]
Gutteridge and one of his producers Steve Carsey created a television format based on the ''Robot Wars'' concept. They produced a live event opposite [[BBC Television Centre]] in [[Wood Lane]], [[Shepherd's Bush]], London and hired Derek Foxwell to build 3 combat robots, 2 of which were named The Mouse and Grunt who would eventually take part in the first UK series of ''Robot Wars'', to take on three American robots, Thor, La Machine and The Master, all of which were veterans of the original American competition. The Controller of BBC Two, [[Michael Jackson (TV executive)|Michael Jackson]], attended the event, which was not filmed and he promised to commission a series. However, it was not until 1998 that a subsequent Controller of BBC Two, [[Mark Thompson (media executive)|Mark Thompson]], fulfilled Jackson's promise and actually commissioned 6 episodes. Gutteridge and Carsey were producers and Foxwell was the technical supervisor and senior technical consultant. He drafted the rules and regulations and was in charge of the pit area and the technical team, which scrutinised the robots, got them on and off stage and helped the contestants prepare and repair their robots. [[Mat Irvine]], initially a member of the technical team, served as a member of the judging panel in 2002 and 2003.

The three person judging panel consisted of [[Noel Sharkey]] (head judge on every series: 1998–2003, 2016–), Eric Dickinson (1998), Adam Harper (1998–99), [[Martin Smith (academic)|Martin Smith]] (1999–2003), [[Myra Wilson]] (2000–01), [[Mat Irvine]] (2001–03), [[Sethu Vijayakumar]] (2016–) and [http://lucyrogers.com/ Lucy Rogers] (2016–).

{{Quote|text=On the first day, I was in the dressing room and looking in the mirror and looking down at the arena. And they were pulling the robots into the arena on an invisible twine because nothing was working. And I was thinking: "Oh my God, what have I done with my career?" And you know, within the blink of an eye, it was the most watched show on BBC2.

Profile sought no input or consent from Thorpe before doing this and this aggravated the already troubled relationship between Thorpe and Profile Records and indirectly spurred legal disagreements surrounding the ownership of the ''Robot Wars'' concept. The legal proceedings surrounding these would last until 6 February 2002.&lt;ref name=robotcombat /&gt; Mentorn used Thorpe as a Consultant on the series, however and the initial series of ''Robot Wars'' in the UK was broadcast over six weeks in February and March 1998. It was an immediate hit, with more than two million viewers and a further 18 episodes were commissioned by the BBC that year. 155 episodes were produced in total and the show was seen in 26 countries. Two series were produced in the US for [[Paramount Network#The National Network, the New TNN and WWE (2000–2003)|The National Network]] (now [[Paramount Network]]) and a version was also shown on [[Nickelodeon]]. Series were also produced in many European countries. Although the series had various directors and producers, all were produced in the UK by Mentorn and executive produced by [[Tom Gutteridge]] and Steve Carsey. The initial series were staged in various film studios around London but the stage and pit area became too large to fit into any of the conventional studios, so filming was later moved to an aircraft hangar at [[RAF Newton]].

Viewing figures dropped significantly in the early 2000s, reaching only 1.2 million in the sixth series - the final to be broadcast on BBC Two. Following its move to Channel 5 in November 2003, the show first began airing in a new Sunday night slot and launched with one million viewers; however ratings fell quickly to 800,000 resulting in the show moving to Saturday nights after just three episodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/nov/21/broadcasting.channel5|title=Saturday night switch for Robot Wars|work=The Guardian|date=21 November 2003|accessdate=30 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revival===
[[File:Robot Wars Carbide (cropped).jpg|thumb|Carbide, the winning robot in the second rebooted series. A fast-spinning bar is its primary weapon.]]
On 13 January 2016, the BBC confirmed that it would be rebooting the show for a six-part series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/mediacentre/latestnews/2016/robot-wars-returns | title= Robot Wars rebooted for BBC Two |publisher= BBC |accessdate=2016-01-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The revived series was hosted by [[Dara Ó Briain]] and [[Angela Scanlon]] with Jonathan Pearce returning as commentator.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/bbcpress/status/694815721843474432|title=BBC Press Office on Twitter|work=Twitter}}{{Primary source inline|date=March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first episode was broadcast on 24 July at 8pm, the same slot as ''[[Top Gear (2002 TV series)|Top Gear]]''. Some robots from the original series returned, including Behemoth and Storm II, as well as four of the original [[House Robots]], which were upgraded to be heavier, faster, better armed and with new looks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Graeme Virtue |url=https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2016/jul/16/the-return-of-tv-show-robot-wars |title=There will be shrapnel: the return of Robot Wars &amp;#124; Television &amp; radio |newspaper=[[The Guardian]] |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 2016 series was filmed in a warehouse at Westway Park in [[Renfrew]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=VIDEO: Robot Wars set to return to our screens ... filmed in a warehouse in Renfrew°|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/14259156.VIDEO__Robot_Wars_set_to_return_to_our_screens_____filmed_in_a_warehouse_in_Renfrew/|newspaper=The Herald|location=Glasgow|date=7 February 2016|accessdate=2016-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first episode received about two million viewers and was the top trending topic on [[Twitter]] with over 20,000 tweets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theweek.co.uk/69657/robot-wars-2016-the-machines-battling-it-out-in-episode-two |title=Robot Wars 2017: Is new series winning over critics? &amp;#124; The Week UK |website=Theweek.co.uk |date=2017-03-06 |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A second rebooted series was commissioned with a first celebrity special in 16 years, in which celebrities, such as Olympians [[Kadeena Cox]] and [[Alistair Brownlee]] and [[Jonny Brownlee]], TV presenters [[Suzi Perry]], [[Neil Oliver]] and [[Maggie Aderin-Pocock]], singer [[Rizzle Kicks|Jordan Stevens]] and radio presenters [[Scott Mills]] and [[Robbie Savage]] had bespoke robots designed for them by eight major roboteers, who mentored them during the specials.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harrison |first=Ellie |url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-12-02/robbie-savage-suzi-perry-and-the-brownlee-brothers-join-robot-wars-battle-of-the-stars-line-up |title=Robot Wars: Battle of the Stars line-up: Robbie Savage and the Brownlee brothers join Christmas show |website=Radio Times |date=2016-12-02 |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its original airing, the first rebooted series was sometimes referred to as 'Series 1', presenting itself as a completely new show. Starting in 2017, however, the BBC began referring to it as Series 8, with the following second series appropriately dubbed Series 9, acknowledging itself as a continuation of the original show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b0873k9n/episodes/guide |title=BBC Two - Robot Wars - Episode guide |publisher=BBC |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p04sj8td |title=BBC Two - Robot Wars, Series 9: Teaser |publisher=BBC |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Battle rules==
A robot could lose a match in several ways during the knockout format of the show:
*'''Immobilisation''': A robot that is unable to move is counted out. In the original series 30 seconds of immobility were necessary, in later series this was reduced to 10 seconds.
*'''Pit''': One of the arena hazards is the ''pit of oblivion'', a large square hole in the arena. A robot that falls or is pushed into this is eliminated.
*'''Removal from arena''': If a robot is ejected from the arena — typically by the flipper of an opponent, it is eliminated. In the original series the perimeter of the arena was a short barrier, in later series the wall was higher, making this type of elimination harder. In the rebooted series, only certain areas of the arena were not fully walled off. This meant that removal from the arena was only practical in certain areas.
* If none of the above conditions were satisfied, a panel of three judges (listed [[#Transmissions|below]]) scored the competitors on style, control, damage and aggression.
:The judges' decisions are based on the following categories: 
:*'''Aggression:''' The extent to which the robot was on the 'front foot' against the opposing robot as opposed to staying out of trouble.
:*'''Damage:''' The amount of damage inflicted on the opposing robot.
:*'''Control:''' The ability of the driver to push opposing robots, avoiding the arena hazards and if they're attacking how they're meant to. 
:*'''Style''' (original series only): The extent to which the robot demonstrated its abilities such as self-righting. For the revived series, the style category was omitted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robotwars.tv/the-show/|title=The Show - Robot Wars|website=Robotwars.tv|access-date=2016-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:In the original series, the Aggression, Damage, Control and Style points were weighted 3:4:2:1 respectively. In the 2016 series the weightings for Aggression, Damage and Control were 3:2:1,&lt;ref name="PressPack"&gt;{{cite web|title=Robot Wars Press Pack|url=https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/28463935/Robot%20Wars%20Press%20Pack.pdf?dl=1|publisher=BBC Two|accessdate=12 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; with "Style" no longer a judged criterion.

Although the format changed several times over the years, these rules remained the same across all series and competitions.

The first series of ''Robot Wars'' was presented by [[Jeremy Clarkson]] and co-hosted by [[Philippa Forrester]]. In keeping with his edgy persona established on ''[[Top Gear (2002 series)|Top Gear]]'', Clarkson frequently made tongue-in-cheek jokes about competitors and their robots, such as remarking that a contestant robot called "Skarab" looked like "cheese on toast".&lt;ref name=SphereTV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spheretv.com/site/television/game-show/robot-wars.html |title=Robot Wars |accessdate=2006-11-18 |publisher=SphereTV |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205043836/http://www.spheretv.com/site/television/game-show/robot-wars.html |archivedate=5 December 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarkson left ''Robot Wars'' after the first series and was replaced with [[Craig Charles]].&lt;ref name=robotsrule&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fightingrobots.co.uk/robotsrule/presenters.htm |title=The Presenters |accessdate=2006-11-18 |work=Robots Rule}}&lt;/ref&gt; Charles, well known as playing the character [[Dave Lister]] in the [[science fiction]]-themed [[sitcom]] ''[[Red Dwarf]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sadgeezer.com/RedDwarf/lister.htm |title=Dave Lister Biography |accessdate=2006-11-19 |work=The SadGeezers Guide |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20061021020427/http://www.sadgeezer.com/RedDwarf/lister.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2006-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; was seen as taking the programme and its contestants more seriously than Clarkson and was more enthusiastic while presenting it.&lt;ref name=SphereTV /&gt; Charles would close each episode with a four line poem ending with the words "''Robot Wars''". Charles presented ''Robot Wars'' until it ceased production in 2004.

{{Quote|"My son, Jack, was a fan of the first series and said I should get involved. So I made a few phone calls and the rest is history."|source=[[Craig Charles]] speaking on how he got involved with ''Robot Wars''.}}

In comparison to Charles' background in science fiction, Philippa Forrester was best known as co-host of the [[science]] and [[technology]] programme ''[[Tomorrow's World]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/bristol/content/articles/2006/01/12/forester_feature.shtml |title=Philippa Forrester |accessdate=2006-11-19 |work=BBC Radio Bristol}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her role on ''Robot Wars'' was as the pit reporter&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0286741/ |title=Philippa Forrester |accessdate=2006-11-19 |publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; who would speak to contestants about their robots before and after battles. Forrester was pit reporter for six of the show's nine series; [[Julia Reed]] took the role for Series 4 and Extreme 1 since Forrester was unable to participate in the programme due to [[pregnancy]], but Forrester returned for Series 5, Series 6 and Extreme 2. When the programme moved to [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] for the seventh series, Forrester did not return for unknown reasons, so [[Jayne Middlemiss]] took over the pit reporter duties.&lt;ref name=robotsrule /&gt;

[[Jonathan Pearce]] was the show's commentator throughout its entire run. He commentated in the same loud and enthusiastic manner as his [[association football|football]] commentaries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2009/10/27/jonathan-pearce-635833/ |title=Jonathan Pearce &amp;#124; Metro News |work=Metro|location=UK |date=2009-10-27 |accessdate=2013-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programme was well known for phrases such as "Roboteers, stand by", "3. 2. 1. Activate" and "Cease!". These phrases were announced by the director, Stuart McDonald and became a recognisable part of the series for the entire duration of its run.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robot Wars is Finally Coming Back to BBC After 12 Years |url=http://screenrant.com/robot-wars-returns-bbc/ |work=screenrant.com |date=13 January 2016 |accessdate=2016-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, [[Dara Ó Briain]] and [[Angela Scanlon]] were announced as the hosts of the eighth series, with Jonathan Pearce returning as commentator. They reprised their roles in the ninth and tenth series.

==House robots==
Throughout the series, house robots acted as obstacles to competing robots in battles and challenges. House robots were permitted to attack robots that were in the Corner Patrol Zones at the corners of the arena or upon the submission of a competing robot. The house robots were an intrinsic part of the programme's success and merchandising of these robots was highly successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Robot Wars returns: How well do you remember the House Robots? |url=http://metro.co.uk/2016/01/14/robot-wars-returns-how-well-do-you-remember-the-house-robots-5622838/ |work=Metro |date=14 January 2016 |accessdate=2016-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, the house robots were not subject to the {{Convert|100|kg|4=0|abbr=on}} weight limit or weapon rules that contestant robots had to adhere to, the most notable example of this was Sergeant Bash's [[flamethrower]].

From the Fourth Wars, a non-competitive "Refbot" was present during fights. This robot conveyed officiating signals (such as counting out immobile competitors) on the arena, gave occasional nudges to help battles along and could deploy a fire extinguisher where necessary.

For Series 8, new versions of Matilda, Shunt, Dead Metal and Sir Killalot were constructed. They are considerably heavier with improved weaponry. All the house robots are over {{Convert|300|kg|4=0|abbr=on}} in weight and Sir Killalot now weighs {{Convert|741|kg|abbr=on}}. Visually, all four look similar to their predecessors, but with significant differences: Dead Metal's head has been enlarged with glowing eyes, Matilda's back-mounted fins have been replaced with smaller crocodilian scales, spikes appear on her frill, her eyes are now red and her whole head section now flips up; Shunt has enlarged wheel protectors and metal chimneys replacing the smokestack; and Sir Killalot's armour and helmet has been entirely redesigned. This was said to be to show the actual shape of Sir Killalot's head, rather than the helmet he is wearing. The other house robots did not return for this series.&lt;ref name="Gill"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2016-06-23/this-is-the-first-proper-look-at-the-upgraded-robot-wars-2016-house-robots|title=The first proper look at the upgraded 2016 Robot Wars House Robots|last=Gill|first=James|date=23 June 2016|work=Radio Times|accessdate=12 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bold text''' indicates house robots that returned for the new series.

==Arena and hazards==
===Arenas===
[[File:Robot Wars Arena.jpg|thumb|The Renfrew arena used for the rebooted series]]
There were numerous arena incarnations used during the original run of ''Robot Wars'' on the BBC. These arenas were also used by international versions such as ''Robot Wars: Extreme Warriors'' in the United States. The arena was approximately {{Convert|32|by|48|ft}}. For Series 1 to 3 the arena was not enclosed as such, as the audience were raised above the arena. The increasing sophistication of weaponry from contestant robots - most notably demonstrated by [[Hypno-Disc]] in Series 3 - as well as arena hazards prompted producers to enclose the arena entirely in a perspex box {{Convert|20|ft}} high from Series 4 onwards, to protect the audience and production team from debris.{{Citation needed|date=September 2016}}

In early 2004, the Robot Wars arena was purchased from the television production firm Mentorn by a company called Robot Arenas Ltd., based in the UK, an organization set up by a past competitor in Robot Wars to continue the sport of robot combat in the UK. The arena - valued originally at £11,000 - was sold for scrap in 2005 for £250 by the new owners of the former [[RAF Newton]] air base, where the arena was housed. A suit filed against RAF Newton by Robot Arenas Ltd. found that RAF Newton had acted reasonably in the matter and owed no compensation to Robot Arenas Ltd.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/7187699/Robot-wars-battle-arena-case-decided.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Robot wars battle arena case decided | date=8 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a new arena was constructed in a warehouse in [[Renfrew]], on the outskirts of [[Glasgow]], for use in the rebooted series. This arena is {{Convert|15|m}} square, with a {{Convert|6|mm|abbr=on}} steel floor&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fightingrobots.co.uk/threads/12907-bbc-robot-wars?p=460519&amp;viewfull=1#post460519 |title=BBC Robot Wars - Page 9 |website=Fightingrobots.co.uk |accessdate=2017-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and higher bulletproof walls, making it harder for robots to be thrown out of the arena.

===Hazards===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}
Throughout Robot Wars' run, arena hazards were introduced and amended. Generally, hazards which proved ineffective were omitted in later series, however some hazards proved to be a success (such as the Pit of Oblivion, Floor Flipper and the Drop Zone) and were retained. The assorted hazards in the arena that changed from one series the next included:

*'''Arena Sidebars''' - The First Wars Only - These were parts of the arena side fence that were on the floor. These trapped robots and potentially immobilised them if they could not drive off.
*'''The Patrol Zone/PZ''' - The First Wars only - Four large squares in the corners of the arena marked with striped tape, each occupied by one House Robot and a hazard. Once a competitor robot entered one of these zones, it was open to attack by the House Robot within. The Patrol Zones were much like the CPZ's that appeared in later series but were much larger.
*'''Floor grilles''' - The First Wars Only - Grille floor panels that, like the arena sidebars mentioned above, were designed to trap robots and not allow them to drive off. Proved much more effective than the sidebars.
*'''Floor spikes''' - The First Wars to The Third Wars and Series 8 onwards - These were pneumatic spikes located in several positions on the arena floor that came up whenever a robot drove over them. They trapped robots and on occasion flipped them. They were removed for Series 4 after causing many upsets during The Third Wars, where robots currently winning battles would be overturned and then lose. This most notably happened during Heat B when Behemoth was flipped, could not self-right and its opponent Pitbull won by default. For Series 8, a group of five large spikes forms one of the four main hazards of the arena. They are powerful and large enough to lift and trap robots for a brief moment (as happened to Bonk in the opening episode), but are not as fast as their predecessors. In theory, this will avoid the sort of upsets seen in Series 3. One spike 'hole' is capable of emitting sparks.
*'''The Perimeter Patrol Zone (commonly known as PPZs)''' - The Second Wars only – A narrow band around the perimeter of the arena that replaced the Patrol Zones. A competitor robot that entered this area was open to attack by any or all of the House Robots stationed there.
*'''The Pit of Oblivion''' - The Second Wars onwards - Arguably the arena's most iconic feature, this was a {{Convert|4|ft|adj=on}} square hole in the arena floor, painted black on the inside and partially filled with old tyres. If a robot drove, fell, or was pushed into the Pit, it would be instantly eliminated. In The Second Wars, pits were added to both lanes of The Gauntlet. For The Third Wars the Pit was open during the first two rounds of each heat, then covered during the heat final and following matches. In The Fourth Wars, the Pit was redesigned, with a yellow-and-black [[Chevron (insignia)|chevron]]-tape outline and was covered until halfway into a battle, whereupon it would "descend". From its very first appearance in The Second Wars, the Pit included a small [[pyrotechnic]] "explosion" that formed a large ball of white smoke. This would activate when a robot fell into the Pit, primarily used to show that a competitor had fallen in. This was changed to a small firework explosion for The Third Wars but the smoke returned for The Fourth Wars and remained until the end. From Extreme 1 onwards there was a device on the arena wall that competitor or house robots could use to activate the pit opening. In Extreme and The Fifth Wars that device was a tyre. For The Sixth Wars the tyre was replaced by a metal bumper. The tyre returned in Extreme 2 and remained for the remainder of the shows' run. The pit was enlarged and given an LED decoration on the inside for the eighth series, with the pyrotechnic no longer used. Since Series 9, the pyrotechnics have been added back to the Pit.
*'''Flame Pit''' - The Second Wars onwards - A large square grill located close to the right bottom corner of the arena. Used to set fire to flammable robots and damage electronics. For the eighth series, this was moved to the upper left corner of the arena.
*'''The Corner Patrol Zones (commonly known as CPZs)''' - The Third Wars onwards - the House Robots were now confined to the four corners of the arena much like in The First Wars. Which house robot was used in which battle was defined by a rota system but would also sometimes depend on if a house robot was being repaired. In The Fourth Wars, the house robots switched to a rota system of Shunt, Matilda, Sgt. Bash and Dead Metal. Sir Killalot consistently appeared every round excepting battles 3 &amp; 4 of the War of Independence. From The Fifth Wars and Extreme 1 onwards only two house robots were allowed in the arena at a time and this moved in a rota through all of the machines. However some House Robots did not appear in a show or on some occasions missed several shows before making an appearance. For Series 8, the CPZs are larger and L-shaped. The house robots no longer attack competitors who enter any CPZ, but stick to guarding their own.
*'''The Floor Flipper''' - The Third Wars onwards - A powerful pneumatic flipper set into the floor, capable of throwing a robot across the arena. It was generally only used on robots that had already been defeated, but was occasionally fired during events such as the House Robot Rebellion. When originally introduced, it just looked like a part of the arena floor. For The Fourth Wars the flipper was given a yellow/black paint scheme similar to the redesigned Pit of Oblivion. For Extreme 1/Series 5 the power of the flipper increased, allowing it to hurl even the heaviest robots into the air and flip featherweight robots out of the arena. For Series 8, this is no longer used as a coup de grace for defeated robots, but fires independently during a fight. It is positioned diagonally on the floor and is capable not only of launching robots into the air but also trapping robots as it closes.
*'''Angle Grinders''' - The Third Wars and Extreme 1 to The Seventh Wars - Abrasive grinding wheels built into the arena railings. The grinders were replaced with small pneumatic spikes in The Fourth Wars but brought back from Extreme 1 onwards.
*'''Pneumatic Spikes''' - The Fourth Wars only - As mentioned above, they replaced the Angle Grinders but proved ineffective so were omitted after one series.
*'''[[Carbon Dioxide|CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;]] geysers''' - The Fifth Wars and Extreme 1 onwards - High pressure CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; outlets designed to cause internal damage to robots, but were more useful for extinguishing fires.
*'''The Drop Zone''' - The Fifth Wars and Extreme 1 to The Seventh Wars - A square on the arena floor where heavy objects (television sets, ocean buoys, refrigerators, washing machines, etc.) fell from the top of the arena. Like the Floor Flipper, it was only used robots that were already immobile. It first appeared in Series 6 and Extreme 2, although the spot where the object would fall, a black square with a yellow 'X' shape across it, first appeared in The Fifth Wars and Extreme 1. Viewers did not know the purpose of this at the time. It is believed it was due to be used in Extreme 1 but technical difficulties meant it was abandoned.
*'''The Disc of Doom''' - The Sixth Wars and Extreme 2 only - A circular spinning panel set into the arena floor activated by a buffer similar to the pit release.  This hazard was used to disrupt a robot's driving and worked well on lighter competitors, but proved ineffective against Heavyweight robots. It first appeared in both The Sixth Wars and Extreme 2 but was removed for The Seventh Wars to be replaced by The Dial of Doom in the near future.
*'''The Dial of Doom/Doom Dial''' - Introduced in The Ninth Wars. A dial that will activate when the arena tyre is pressed. If the dial swings left, it will open up the pit and if the dial swings right it will activate "Rogue House Robot" which allows a house robot to leave the CPZ and attack a competitor robot for up to 10 seconds. Additionally, from the Tenth Wars, swinging right may trigger "The Fog of War" in which the arena is filled with CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; for 10 seconds, obscuring the robots from view.

==Merchandise==
===Toys===
[[File:Sir Killalot spear.jpg|thumb|A Sir Killalot toy]] 
Pullback and friction toys were made of all the House Robots, with the exception of Cassius Chrome as the toys had stopped production when it was introduced for The Seventh Wars and the toys would have resumed production by Series 10 but this did not happen until [[Hexbug]] did so rather late in 2018. There were also pullback and ripcord toys of Chaos 2, Dantomkia, Firestorm, Hypno-Disc, Panic Attack, Pussycat, Razer, Stinger, Tornado, Wheely Big Cheese and X-Terminator 2. Each came with an accessory.

There were remote controlled versions of Shunt, Matilda, Sir Killalot and Growler. There were also smaller remote control battlers, which had "immobilisation spots" on the rear of the toy. Sgt. Bash and the competitor robot Tornado were the only two made. These were smaller than the other remote control robots mentioned above.

There were customisable kit toys of the House Robot Matilda and competitors [[Hypno-Disc]] and [[Panic Attack (robot)|Panic Attack]]. A Sergeant Bash pitstop kit was prototyped but never released.

Minibots were a series of small die-cast replica robots. The range included all of the Series 5 House Robots along with competitor robots Chaos 2, Dominator 2, Firestorm III, Gemini, Hypno-Disc, Mega Morg, Panic Attack, Plunderbird 5, Pussycat, Razer, Suicidal Tendencies, Tornado, Wheely Big Cheese, Wild Thing and X-Terminator 2. They had an interactive replica arena and two additional playsets.

===Home media===
Several [[VHS]] videos were released of the show. These included "The First Great War" a look at the making of Series 1, "The First World Championship" which was released exclusively on video at the time and the "Ultimate Warrior Collection" featuring exclusive access to the teams of [[Chaos 2]], [[Hypno-Disc]] and [[Razer (robot)|Razer]], along with footage of their battles. Along the same lines an "Ultimate Archive Collection" was released showing exclusive footage of the House Robots and their operators along with some of their greatest battles and most embarrassing moments.

The Ultimate Warrior Collection, Ultimate Archive Collection and First Great War were also released on [[DVD]]. The footage and content remained the same as the VHS releases. Series 8 was released on DVD and Blu-ray on 29 August 2016, making it the first full series of ''Robot Wars'' to be released on home media. It was later released digitally. Series 9 and 10, along with the "Battle of the Stars" specials, were released on 11 December 2017 as a 5-disc DVD box set.

===Video games===
''[[Robot Wars: Metal Mayhem]]'' is the first game based on the show, released on [[Game Boy Color]] in 2000. It was followed in 2001 by ''[[Robot Wars: Arenas of Destruction]]'' on [[PlayStation 2]] and [[Microsoft Windows]] and ''[[Robot Wars: Advanced Destruction]]'' on [[Game Boy Advance]]. After the first three titles sold over 250,000 copies, a fourth and final game, released on [[Game Boy Advance]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Xbox]] in 2002 was called ''[[Robot Wars: Extreme Destruction]]''.&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"/&gt;

===Other===
A huge array of other merchandise was produced due to the success of the show. Items available included mugs, glasses, mobile phone covers, toiletries, stationery, clocks, watches, bedding, curtains and clothing. The show even produced an unsuccessful single, which peaked at number 51 in the UK singles charts in December 2000, called "Sir Killalot Vs. Robo Babe - Robot Wars (Android Love)".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://binarytradingclub.com/binary-options-robot/|title=Trading Robot|work=Trading Club|access-date=2017-05-13|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; A custom made game officially licensed under Robot Wars LLC was started on in October 2013, using the [[Robot Arena 2: Design and Destroy|Robot Arena 2]] video game as the base engine. It featured many robots from the TV series as well as robots competing in the newer live events. It also included the original Robot Wars arena and various live arenas. It was released to the public in September 2015 and an updated version which included more robots was released in February 2016. A smaller update was released in January 2017, adding two new robots. Another update came in August 2017 which added the new Robot Wars arena from the current series and another new arena as well as some unreleased robots from the beta and robots that were due to be released in a cancelled expansion. It is only available for [[Microsoft Windows]].

[[Image:Botticelli - Adoration of the Magi (Zanobi Altar) - Uffizi.jpg|thumb|[[Sandro Botticelli]]'s painting of the ''[[Adoration of the Magi of 1475 (Botticelli)|Adoration of the Magi]]'' has an inserted self-portrait at the far right: the position in the corner and the gaze out to the viewer are very typical of such self-portraits.]]
'''Self-insertion''' is a literary device in which a [[fictional character]], who represents the real author of a work of fiction, appears as an idealized character within that fiction, either overtly or in disguise.&lt;ref name="Goetz2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Goetz|first=Sharon K.|title=Terminus: Collected Papers on Harry Potter, 7-11 August 2008|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nffbAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA516|accessdate=22 September 2014|date=2010-04-01|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9780982680704|pages=516–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In art, the equivalent is the '''inserted self-portrait''', where the artist includes a [[self-portrait]] in a painting of a narrative subject. This has been a common artistic device since at least the [[European Renaissance]].

==Related concepts==
This literary device should not be confused with a [[first-person narrator]], an [[author surrogate]], or a character somewhat based on the author, whether the author included it intentionally or not. Many characters have been described as ''unintentional'' self-insertions, implying that their author is unconsciously using them as an author surrogate.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

'''''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine – Crossroads of Time''''' is a 1995 [[action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[video game]] for the [[Sega Genesis|Genesis]] and [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] platforms, based on the television series ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. Critics praised the game's authentic recreation of the look and feel of the TV series, but often criticized its gameplay as repetitive and clunky.

== Gameplay ==
In the game, the player controls a member of the Deep Space Nine's crew, mostly captain [[Benjamin Sisko]], also doctor [[Julian Bashir]], major [[Kira Nerys]] and [[Odo (Star Trek)|Odo]]. Most of the game's levels are [[cinematic platformer]]s, one is a [[scrolling shooter|horizontal-scrolling shooter]]. Platformer levels are of two types: 'adventure' levels and 'action' levels. In 'adventure' levels, the player character moves around the Deep Space Nine, talking with [[Non-player character|NPCs]] and ultimately reaching a certain point in the plot. In 'action' levels, the player wanders the level in the cinematic platformer style, climbing ledges, fighting enemies with a [[Phaser Array|phaser]], finding and using items, with an ultimate goal to fulfill a certain mission, sometimes within a given time limit.

}}

Reviewing the Genesis version, ''[[GamePro]]'' summarized "Despite DS9's remarkable graphics and authentic Trekkie atmosphere, its simple, repetitive action will attract only puzzle fiends and devotees of the TV show." They elaborated that the puzzles are time-consuming, every conflict can be won just by crouching and shooting, and that players must view the same conversations every time their character dies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Crossroads of Time|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=81|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1995|page=52}}&lt;/ref&gt; A different ''GamePro'' critic reviewed the SNES version. He criticized that the controls are clunky and that the levels are repetitive and similar-looking to each other, but also remarked that the authentic Deep Space Nine look and spirit would make the game enjoyable for fans of the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Crossroads of Time|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=81|publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=June 1995|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reviewer for ''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' complimented the game's story and faithfulness to the source material, but concluded that the slow pace, unclear objectives, and muddy graphics make it "Recommended only for undiscriminating fans."&lt;ref name="NGen6"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Star Trek Deep Space Nine: Crossroads of Time|journal=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=6|publisher=[[Imagine Media]]|date=June 1995|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt; The four reviewers of ''[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]'' gave the game a positive review. Two of them criticized that the pace is too slow, but all four praised the backgrounds and character sprites as reproducing the look of the TV show with great attention to detail, and they emphasized that fans of the show should try the game. Though they remarked that the graphics are not as good in the Genesis version, all four reviewers gave the two versions identical scores.&lt;ref name="EGM72"&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=Review Crew: Star Trek: Deep Space Nine|journal=[[Electronic Gaming Monthly]]|issue=72|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|date=July 1995|pages=35-36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]'' reviewed the Genesis version of the game, and stated that "This game is boring and will only be of minor interest to ''Deep Space Nine'' freaks."&lt;ref name="NG8"&gt;{{cite magazine|last=|first=|title=Finals|magazine=[[Next Generation (magazine)|Next Generation]]|issue=8|publisher=[[Future US|Imagine Media]]|date=August 1995|page=75}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Super Saturday''' or '''Panic Saturday''' is the last [[Saturday]] before [[Christmas Eve]] or [[Christmas]] in [[Poland]], a major day of revenue for American [[retail]]ers, marking the end of the shopping season they and many customers believe begins on [[Black Friday (shopping)|Black Friday]]. Super Saturday targets last-minute shoppers. Typically the day is ridden with one-day [[Discounts and allowances|sales]] in an effort to accrue more revenue than any other day in the [[Christmas and holiday season]].&lt;ref name="WETM"&gt;{{cite web|title=Holiday Shoppers Pack Stores on Super Saturday|url=http://www.aolnews.com/videos/video/main/holiday-shoppers-pack-stores-on-super-saturday/563623070|author=Nick Natario|accessdate=16 June 2010|publisher=WETM TV}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; The date in Poland is always the second to last Saturday in December and is slightly more likely to fall on December 22, December 19, December 17, or December 24 (in Poland) (58 in 400 years each), than on December 21 or December 20 (57), and slightly less likely to occur on December 23 or December 18 (56).

==Sales==
Super Saturday typically nets approximately $15 billion in retail sales.&lt;ref name="ABC"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Business/winter-storm-threatens-retailers-bottom-line/story?id=9382072|title=Will Blizzard Blow Away Sales?|last1=Sy|first1=Stephanie|last2=Herman|first2=Charles|last3=Francescani|first3=Chris|publisher=ABC News|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; To compete with each other, stores offer significant discounts and extend store hours in an attempt to attract customers and drive [[impulse buying]].&lt;ref name="Dallas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dallasnews.com/sharedcontent/dws/bus/stories/DN-ShopTalk_19bus.ART.State.Edition1.29e4b8f.html|title=Black Friday returns today for procrastinators|publisher=The Dallas Morning News|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Super Saturday accounts for a significant portion of the holiday sales for retail stores. In 2006, a study determined that sales between December 21 and 24 accounted for 13.6 percent of holiday sales.&lt;ref name="Reuters"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSN2057514820071221|title=Stores desperately seeking shoppers on Super Saturday|publisher=Reuters|author=Nicole Maestri|accessdate=20 December 2009 | date=21 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In 2006, Super Saturday fell on December 23.) Some businesses do as much as 60 percent of their sales on this day.&lt;ref name="Business Insider"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/winter-storm-threatens-to-bury-super-saturday-2009-12|title=Winter Storm Threatens to Bury "Super Saturday"|author=John Carney|publisher=Business Insider|accessdate=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an effort to attract customers, stores often extend their hours during these crucial days of the retail season. Some stores go as far as to leave their stores open all day long until [[Christmas Eve]] in hopes that customers will take the extra time during off-peak hours to both review alternative options and to spread out workloads for [[cashiers]].&lt;ref name="Reuters" /&gt; Because stores predict double or triple their typical customer turnout on Super Saturday, many increase their staffing during these critical days to be able to handle the demand.&lt;ref name="MyFox" /&gt;

==Shoppers==
The day typically nets a significant amount of revenue for retailers because of the demand by shoppers. 2009 reports indicated that by the middle of December, more than half of all shoppers in the United States still had more holiday shopping to do.&lt;ref name="KFBB"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kfbb.com/news/local/79735807.html|title=Super Saturday Shopping|author=The KFBB News Team|accessdate=20 December 2009|publisher=KFBB News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713145256/http://www.kfbb.com/news/local/79735807.html|archivedate=13 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some experts predicted that approximately 40% of consumers hadn't started their holiday shopping by Super Saturday in 2009, with some customers citing full-time jobs as impeding their access to stores earlier in the year.&lt;ref name="MyFox"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxtampabay.com/dpp/news/local/super-saturday-121909|title=Super Saturday|author=Alcides Segui|accessdate=16 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cathy Bergh from The Christmas House notes that the day is significant because it is "the last chance [for shoppers] to get out and do their shopping."&lt;ref name="WETM" /&gt;

Some shoppers, however, intentionally wait for Super Saturday to finish their shopping due to the availability of discounts. Alternative reasons for waiting until the final Saturday to make holiday purchases include ensuring that purchases are within budget. Other customers choose to do their shopping early in an attempt to avoid the long lines and large crowds associated with the retail holiday.&lt;ref name="KFBB" /&gt;

Unlike Black Friday, [[online]] shopping does not typically infringe upon retail stores' access to customers. Due to Super Saturday's proximity to [[Christmas]], shoppers are typically reluctant to venture online for deals, as purchases may not be able to arrive in time for the holiday.&lt;ref name="ABC" /&gt; However, this is not always the case. If customers are unable to gain access to the stores, like what happened during the [[North American blizzard of 2009]], customers who have little time left to buy their gifts may be forced online.&lt;ref name="WSJ"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052748704376704574605820236262190?mod=rss_Today's_Most_Popular|title=Snowstorm Threatens 'Super Saturday' Sales|last1=Dodes|first1=Rachel|last2=Zimmerman|first2=Ann|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=20 December 2009 | date=20 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other usages==
Super Saturday can also be used for any Saturday where a large number of related events are held. In the context of the [[Eurovision Song Contest]] for example, the Saturday on which most broadcasters organize their national final is often declared as Super Saturday.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mark it down: Super Saturday is this weekend|url=http://www.eurovision.tv/page/news?id=26073&amp;_t=mark_it_down_super_saturday_this_weekend}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The final Saturday of the [[US Open (tennis)|US Open]] in tennis is called "Super Saturday". If the tournament is running to schedule and has not been delayed by inclement weather or similar, both the men's semi-finals and the women's final are played on this day, with the men's semi-finals in the afternoon, then the women's final at night.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}}

The phrase was also used (mainly by the [[United Kingdom|British]] media) to refer to the middle Saturday of the [[2012 Summer Olympics]] (4 August) where [[Team GB]] athletes [[Jessica Ennis]], [[Mo Farah]], [[Greg Rutherford]], [[Danielle King]], [[Laura Trott]], [[Joanna Rowsell]], [[Tom James]], [[Pete Reed]], [[Andrew Triggs Hodge]], [[Alex Gregory]], [[Katherine Copeland]] and [[Sophie Hosking]] all won gold medals.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1223">'''Telestreet''' is an Italian movement that set up free TV stations in several metropolitan areas in Italy. The movement started in [[Bologna]] with a small transmitting station, '''OrfeoTv,''' which was founded by media theorist and activist [[Franco Berardi|Franco "Bifo" Berardi]]. Since June 2002, this micro-TV station has been broadcasting for a few hours a day within a range of 200 metres.

There are now nearly one hundred mini TV stations across Italy. Their transmitting hardware contains slightly modified receiver electronics.

The telestreet are usually promoted by organizations, groups or individuals who use the facility for television and social uses for group benefit, with the aim of making television a free communication tool like a newspaper or a website.

'''Tetragrammaton Records''' was an American [[record label]] founded in 1968 by music industry executives Roy Silver, Bruce Post Campbell, Marvin Deane, and comedian [[Bill Cosby]]. Silver, at the time, was also Cosby's manager. The term "Tetragrammaton" refers to the unspeakable Hebrew [[tetragrammaton|name of God]].&lt;ref name="Dead"&gt;[http://www.thedeadrockstarsclub.com/2010b.html Thedeadrockstarsclub.com] - accessed August 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The label's most successful act was the rock band [[Deep Purple]].

Tetragrammaton was also responsible for releasing the controversial 1968 [[Apple Records]] album, ''[[Unfinished Music No. 1: Two Virgins]]'' in the United States. This avant-garde album was recorded by [[John Lennon]] and [[Yoko Ono]] and featured nude photos of the pair on the front and back cover. Tetragrammaton stepped in as distributor after [[Capitol Records]], the usual US distributor for Apple and the [[Beatles]], refused the album, citing a possible negative response from retailers. 

The Lennon/Ono album was also declared to be pornography by some authorities. Tetragrammaton quickly fell into financial difficulties related in part to their distribution of this album. Approximately 30,000 copies of the record were seized by police at a warehouse in New Jersey. The records were held as evidence in a court case, which made it impossible for the label to sell them at the time.

Bill Cosby's 1969 stand-up comedy album, ''[[8:15 12:15]]'', was also released by the label, as were two albums by comedian [[Murray Roman]], ''You Can't Beat People  Up &amp; Have Them Say I Love You'' and ''A Blind Man's Movie''.

A number of the label's projects were left unissued. Among these were a second album by singer songwriter Elyse Weinberg, and an album by [[Memphis, Tennessee|Memphis]] musician Captain Milk (real name, Edwin Hubbard) who described himself as a "flute picker". Tetragrammaton did however release a single of the Lennon/McCartney song ''[[Hey Jude]]'' from the Captain Milk recording sessions. An English rock band named [[Bodast]] also recorded an unreleased album for Tetragrammaton in 1968. The group featured guitarist [[Steve Howe (musician)|Steve Howe]], later a member of [[Yes (band)|Yes]]. The Bodast recordings were first released in 1981 by another label. 

Despite having several popular artists on its roster, Tetragrammaton permanently closed its doors after declaring [[bankruptcy]] in 1971. In 1972, Deep Purple's new label, [[Warner Bros. Records]] (also Cosby's former label), reissued various tracks from the group's first three Tetragrammaton albums on one compilation album entitled ''[[Purple Passages]]''. In Canada, some of Tetragrammaton's releases were manufactured and distributed by the Canadian division of [[Polydor Records]], which also issued several Canada-only Deep Purple compilations after Tetragrammaton's demise.

Tetragrammaton's co-founder, Marvin Deane, died of [[heart failure]] on August 16, 2010, in Los Angeles, California.&lt;ref name="Dead"/&gt;

'''''The Bigs 2''''' (known in Europe and Australia as '''''The Bigs 2 Baseball''''') is a [[baseball]] [[sports video game]] developed by [[Blue Castle Games]] and published by [[2K Sports]] for the [[Xbox 360]], [[PlayStation 3]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[Wii]], and [[PlayStation Portable]]. The game performs as the direct sequel to [[The Bigs]].&lt;ref name="The BIGS 2 IGN"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/958/958652p1.html|title=The Bigs 2 this Summer|last=Goldstein|first=Hilary |date=March 3, 2009|publisher=IGN|page=1|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 3, 2009, the first trailer for the game was released revealing that players like [[Ozzie Smith]], [[Wade Boggs]], [[Roberto Clemente]], and [[Reggie Jackson]] and a number of other [[Baseball Hall of Fame|Hall of Famers]] would be playable in the game.&lt;ref name="Announcement trailer"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/dor/objects/14326302/the-bigs-2/videos/bigs2_trl_030209_first_teaser_trailer.html|title=The Bigs 2 Xbox 360Trailer - Announcement Trailer|publisher=IGN|page=1|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; On April 7, 2009, the [[Milwaukee Brewers]] All-Star first baseman [[Prince Fielder]] was announced as the cover athlete chosen by 2K Sports. For the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii editions of the game, play-by-play is announced in English by Damon Bruce and in Japanese by Kasey Ryne Mazak. &lt;ref&gt;"The BIGS 2 on IMDb" https://www.imdb.com/title/tt4242988/&lt;/ref&gt; It was released on July 7, 2009.&lt;ref name="Cover athlete"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/970/970378p1.html|title=Prince Fielder Named Cover Athlete For The Bigs 2|date=April 7, 2009|publisher=IGN|page=1|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
''The BIGS 2'' features an over-the-top playing style, like the first game established. Unlike the first game, The BIGS 2 allows players to play through the full 162 game season and will allow the player to act both as [[general manager]] and as the players on the field by allowing the player to trade, draft, and manage other front office activities. The game also, includes new game stats called ''Power'', ''Glove'', and ''Contact''. The Bigs 2 does not support the [[Wii MotionPlus]] for improving control precision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video |title=Zunecast: Special Edition (The Bigs 2 Developer Call)|url=http://www.the10k.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1895:zunecast-special-edition-the-bigs-2-developer-call&amp;catid=66:the-10k-zunecast&amp;Itemid=83|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090701021718/http://www.the10k.com/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=1895:zunecast-special-edition-the-bigs-2-developer-call&amp;catid=66:the-10k-zunecast&amp;Itemid=83 |archivedate=2009-07-01 |work=The 10k Zunecast|publisher=The10k.com|format=MP3|people=Rob Nelson, Damon Perdue|medium=podcast|time=33:23|accessdate=2009-11-05|date=2009-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At bat, the game also gives the player a new hitting system that consists of a "wheelhouse". Pitches thrown into the wheelhouse can be hit more efficiently by the batter or gain more turbo if taken for a strike. Strikes in the wheelhouse also shrink the radius of the wheelhouse. For some hitters, the circle will be bigger based on stats. For example, Alex Rodriguez possesses very high hitting stats. His wheelhouse radius covers nearly the entire strike zone, excluding the four corners.

The game also include real-time sequences where the player can quickly tap a button to catch a ball speeding quickly past a fielder's head. Like the original game, each button simply like (X) will stand for a different base. When the button is pressed, the ball would be thrown to the selected base.

The new "Big Slam" mechanic allows the player to bring four consecutive batters up. If the first batter makes contact a single will automatically register. This will continue until the 4th batter is reached. If the first three players reached base by making contact, the 4th batter, upon making contact, will automatically hit a [[Grand slam (baseball)|grand slam]].

Become a Legend is a mode where the player creates a character who is recovering from an injury in the Mexican League, is picked up by a Major League team, and then tries to reach "Legendary Status".&lt;ref name="BIGS Hands On"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/978/978515p1.html|title=The Bigs 2 Hands-on|last=Ahearn|first=Nate|date=April 30, 2009|publisher=IGN|page=1|accessdate=2009-05-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A demo for the game has been released in the [[PlayStation Store]] and [[Xbox Live Marketplace]], but the only playable teams are the NL and AL All Star Teams. The games only last 3 innings. Also, an intro to the mini game "Home run pinball" is included.

The Bigs 2 was released in the UK on 17 July 2009. It was the first baseball game to be released in the UK on Xbox 360. It was released as a budget game with many retailers listing the pre-order for less than £20.00.

The Bigs 2 was released for the Nintendo DS on September 8, 2009.

'''The Media Equation''' is a general [[communication theory]] that claims that people tend to treat [[Personal computer|computers]] and other [[Broadcast media|media]] as if they were either [[interpersonal communication|real people]] or real places.  The effects of this phenomenon on people experiencing these media are often profound, leading them to behave and to respond to these experiences in unexpected ways, most of which they are completely unaware of.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves and Nass, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally based on the research of [[Clifford Nass]] and [http://www.stanford.edu/~reeves Byron Reeves] at [[Stanford University]], the theory explains that people tend to respond to media as they would either to another person (by being polite, cooperative, attributing personality characteristics such as aggressiveness, humor, expertise, and even gender) – or to places and phenomena in the physical world – depending on the cues they receive from the media. Numerous studies that have evolved from the research in [[psychology]], [[social science]] and other fields indicate that this type of reaction is automatic, unavoidable, and happens more often than people realize. Reeves and Nass (1996) argue that, “Individuals’ interactions with computers, television, and new media are fundamentally social and natural, just like interactions in real life,” (p. 5).

==The Media Equation Test (1996)==
Reeves and Nass established two rules before the test- when a computer asks a user about itself, the user will give more positive responses than when a different computer asks the same questions. They expected people to be less variable with their responses when they took a test and then answered a questionnaire on the same computer. They wanted to see that computers, although not human, can implement social responses. The independent variable was the computer (there are 2 in the test), and the dependent variable was the evaluation responses. The control was a pen-and-paper questionnaire.

	Reeves and Nass designed an experiment in which 22 people come to a laboratory and told them they would be working with a computer to learn about random facts of American pop culture. At the end of the session they would ask them to evaluate the computer that they used. They would have to tell Reeves and Nass how they felt about that computer and how well it performed. 20 facts were presented in each session, and participants would answer if they knew “a great deal, somewhat, or very little” about the statement. After the session, participants were tested on the material and told which questions they had answered correctly or incorrectly. This computer, computer #1, then made a statement of its own performance, always stating that it “did a good job”.

	Participants were then divided into 2 groups to evaluate the computer’s performance and participants were asked to describe this performance from the choice of about 20 adjectives. Half of the participants were assigned to evaluate on computer #1, the computer that praised its own work. The other half were sent to another computer across the room to evaluate computer#1’s performance.

	The conclusion resulted in evaluations done on computer #1 after testing on computer #1 yielded much more positive responses about the session. Evaluations completed on the other computer after testing on computer #1 resulted in much more varied and more negative responses about the session. For the control, the pen-and-paper questionnaire, the evaluations had similar results to that of evaluations done on computer #2. Respondents felt more comfortable being honest when a different computer or paper asked about the sessions completed on computer #1. It is as if participants were talking behind the computer 1’s back- not being honest to it, but then expressing more honesty to a third party evaluator. Reeves and Nass found that participants had automatic social reactions during the test.

	Reeves and Nass ran the test again but added a voice speaker to both computers that would verbally communicate information to make the human-social theme more explicit. The test resulted in almost exactly the same results. They concluded that people are polite to computers in both verbal and textual scenarios. The respondents did not need much of a cue to respond socially to the computers. The experiment proves that social rules can apply to media and computers can be social initiators. Participants denied being intentionally polite to the computer, but the results suggest differently.

==Propositions==
The media equation relies on eight propositions derived from the research:&lt;ref&gt;Reeves and Nass, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

#Everyone responds socially and naturally to media – The media equation applies to everyone regardless of their experience, education level, age, technology proficiency, or cultures.
#Media are more similar than different – Psychologically speaking, a computer is not much different from a television and a sophisticated version of a technology is remarkably similar to a simpler version of the technology. As Reeves and Nass (1996) say, “social and natural responses come from people, not from media themselves,” (p.&amp;nbsp;252). In other words, the media does not make people react the way they do.
#The media equation is automatic – Since the media equation assumes that responses are “social and natural” then these reactions occur automatically without conscious effort. This can occur with minimal prompting.
#Many different responses characterize the media equation – The media equation occurs even with the most passive uses of media. When using any type of media, a person is likely to assign it a personality, pay extra attention to it, or even assess its personality.
#What seems true is more important than what is true – Perception of reality is far more influential than the actual objective reality. A person can know that a computer is a box made of wires and processors but can still assign a personality to it. The important point to remember is that these responses are just part of being human and participating in a communication event.
#People respond to what is present – Despite knowing that the media merely provide a symbolic version of the world, people still tend to respond to what the media ''appears to be'' as if it were real and immediately present. For the most part, people are more concerned with the interpretation of cues or messages they receive, rather than trying to determine the original intention of the message's creators.
#People like simplicity – The need for simplicity and to reduce complexity is an innate human need. People are comfortable with simple. Simplicity indicates a level of predictability that makes people more comfortable.
#Social and natural is easy – When interacting with media, Reeves and Nass (1996) argue, “people should be able to use what comes naturally – rules for social relationships and rules for navigating the physical world,” (p.&amp;nbsp;255). People already know how to function in the natural world (be polite, how to handle difficult personalities) so designers should take these reactions and phenomena into consideration when designing new media.

==Research-based findings==
The assumptions and conclusions of the media equation are based on a rigorous research agenda that relies on objective empirical data using reliable social science research methods. As Reeves and Nass (1996) explain, “Our strategy for learning about media was to go to the social science section of the library, find theories and experiments about human-human interaction – and then borrow…Take out a pen, cross out ‘human’ or ‘environment’ and substitute media. When we did this, all of the predictions and experiments led to the media equation: People’s responses to media are fundamentally social and natural,” (p.&amp;nbsp;251). 
The empirical data to support the media equation is thorough and expansive. Studies have tested a wide variety of communication characteristics with the media – manners, personality, emotion, social roles and form. Below are explanations of some of the more interesting findings that support the media equation.

===Politeness===
Politeness is one measure that researchers have used to study [[human-computer interaction]]. Being polite is an automatic response in most interpersonal interactions. When a person asks a question about themselves, most people will give a positive response, even if it may be a dishonest answer, to avoid hurting the other person’s feelings. To test this idea with human-computer interaction, researchers designed an experiment in which participants would work with a computer on a tutoring exercise.&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Moon, and Carney, 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The computer would provide them with a fact about American culture and then provide supplemental information. The computer then prompted participants to take a test to evaluate what they have learned. After completing the tests participants were asked to evaluate the computer’s performance. The participants were assigned to one of three conditions – a pencil and paper evaluation, an evaluation on a different computer, or an evaluation on the same computer. The results indicate that participants who were asked to evaluate the same computer gave the computer more positive feedback than the other two conditions. To learn more about this experiment, see Nass, Moon, &amp; Carney, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Moon, and Carney, 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

===Negativity===
In psychology there is a law of hedonic asymmetry that says evaluations of good and bad are important but not the same; negative experiences tend to dominate. In other words, people tend to dwell on the negative more than the positive.&lt;ref&gt;Reeves and Nass, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; Responses to negative situations are automatic and require more attention to process than positive experiences. Allocating more resources to process negative information takes away from resources available to process positive information, thus impeding one’s ability to remember events preceding the negative event. The media equation suggests that people have a similar experience when they encounter a negative experience with media. A study was developed to examine the idea that “negative images retroactively inhibit memory for material that precedes them, while they proactively enhance memory for material that follows them,” (Newhagen &amp; Reeves, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;25). In other words, will watching negative images on the news prevent someone from remembering information that they learned just prior to viewing the negative material? And conversely, will they better remember information they received just after viewing the negative material?

In the study,&lt;ref&gt;Newhagen and Reeves, 1992&lt;/ref&gt; researchers created two versions of the same news story – one with compelling negative images and one without. Participants were asked to watch a 20-minute news video (half of the participants saw the negative images and the other half did not) and an additional ten-minute video. They were instructed to pay attention because they would be tested afterwards. A follow up survey was sent 6 to 7 weeks later to measure memory and recall from the news video. The results support the idea that people better remember information that comes after a negative event. Respondents who viewed the negative images better remembered the second half of the newscast than the part preceding the negative images. The findings of this study further support the media equation assumption that mediated experiences are the same as natural experiences.

For a more in depth look at this study, see Newhagen &amp; Reeves, 1992.&lt;ref&gt;Newhagen and Reeves, 1992&lt;/ref&gt;

===Teammates===
Psychology has demonstrated that being a part of a team has a direct influence on attitude and behavior of team members. Members of a team think they are more similar to each other than people on the outside. There are two main characteristics that define team interactions – identity and interdependence. For a group to become a team the members must identify with each other and exhibit some degree of interdependence on each other. These two characteristics were tested to determine if a computer can be a teammate.

In this study,&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Fogg, Moon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; participants were assigned to one of two conditions. In the first condition they would be paired with a computer and would become the blue team. The computer had a blue sticker and the human wore a blue wristband to signify that they were in fact a team. The second condition was blue individual, in which a person would use a computer but they were not considered teammates, rather the computer was just a resource. The task was to complete a “Desert Survival Guide” activity in which participants rank items they deem most important if they were left on a deserted island. Human participants initially completed the activity on their own and then completed it using a computer (either as a teammate where both the computer and human were evaluated or just using the computer as a resource). Finally, the participants were allowed to revise their rankings, if they wished to do so. The results of this study indicated that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate viewed the computer as more like them, worked in a similar style to their own, was more cooperative and friendlier than people who worked individually. Another finding of this study showed that participants who worked with the computer as a teammate were more likely to change their behavior and conform to the group ideal even when the teammate was a computer. This study supports the notion that developing a sense of interdependency is the key to establishing team affiliation.
For a more detailed account of this study, see Nass, Fogg, &amp; Moon, 1996.&lt;ref&gt;Nass, Fogg, Moon, 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

These are just a few of the many studies that support the media equation. For more in depth reading on this subject and past studies, see the “Further Reading” section at the end of this article.

==Alternative explanations==
Some alternative explanations for the media equation have been proposed.  But, as Nass and Moon (2000)&lt;ref&gt;Nass and Moon, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; argue, these explanations do not add up to the body of empirical evidence that supports media equation.  One explanation is that people attribute human characteristics to computers, also known as [[anthropomorphism]]. Nass and Moon (2000) refute this claim, saying, “Participants in our experiment were adult, [[experienced computer user]]s. When debriefed, they insisted that they would never respond socially to a computer, and vehemently denied the specific behavior they had in fact exhibited during the experiments,” (p.&amp;nbsp;93). A second argument against media equation is that participants are actually responding to the programmers behind the computer. Nass and Moon (2000) refute this argument by citing that studies involving multiple computers generally found differences in interactions from computer to computer. If a person was interacting with the programmer behind the computer, then there would be no difference in interaction between computers. Critics have also argued that the way the experiments and questionnaires were designed in the Stanford research may have predisposed their subjects to interact socially with technology. Nass and Moon (2000) counter-argued by saying that the experiments were not misleading. None of the computers used in the experiments were personalized; the computer never referred to itself as “I” and participants interacted with simple text on a screen.

===Grice's Maxims===
Reeves and Nass explain that [[Paul Grice|H. Paul Grice’s]] [[Cooperative principle|maxims for politeness]] are perhaps the most generally accepted rules on politeness communication and that Grice's rules are a vital basis to explaining the media equation. The four principles consist of Quality, Quantity, Clarity, and Relevance. Reeves and Nass used these principles to help explain how they believed computers could be social actors. Quality refers to how information presented in a conversation should have value, truth, and importance. Quantity refers to how speakers in interaction should present just the right amount of information to make the conversation as useful as possible. Too much or too little information may damage value of information. Reeves and Nass argue that quantity is not something social media executed very well; they feel it causes frustration because computers display too much or too little information to humans when trying to communicate. Relevance refers to the content of information being translated into an interaction- this information should be both relevant and on-topic. Reeves and Nass argue that computers should be customizable so the user has control over relevance, and they observed how computers struggle to respond to wishes or goals of the user.

	Reeves and Nass argue that Grice’s maxims are vital guidelines to the media equation because violations of these rules have a social significance. If one side of social interaction violates a rule, it may come off to the other party as a lack of attention being paid, or a diminishing of the importance of the conversation; in other words, they get offended. This leads to a negative consequence for both the party that violated a rule and to the value of conversation.

The '''ancient Greek drama''' was a [[Theatre|theatrical]] [[culture]] that flourished in [[ancient Greece]] from 700 BC. The [[Polis|city-state]] of [[Classical Athens|Athens]], which became a significant cultural, political, and military power during this period, was its center, where it was [[institution]]alised as part of a [[festival]] called the [[Dionysia]], which honored the god [[Dionysus]]. [[Greek tragedy|Tragedy]] (late 500 BC), [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] (490 BC), and the [[satyr play]] were the three [[drama]]tic [[genre]]s to emerge there. Athens exported the festival to its numerous colonies.

==Etymology==
The word τραγῳδία ('tragodia'), from which the word "[[tragedy]]" is derived, is a [[compound (linguistics)|compound]] of two [[Greek language|Greek]] words: τράγος (''tragos'') or "goat" and ᾠδή (''[[ode]]'') meaning "song", from ἀείδειν (''aeidein''), "to sing".&lt;ref&gt;[http://m-w.com/dictionary/tragedy Merriam-Webster definition of tragedy]&lt;/ref&gt;
This etymology indicates a link with the practices of the ancient [[Cult of Dionysus|Dionysian cults]]. It is impossible, however, to know with certainty how these [[Fertility rite|fertility rituals]] became the basis for tragedy and [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]].&lt;ref name="Redgeway"&gt;{{harvp|Ridgeway|1910|p=83}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

The classical Greek valued the power of spoken word, and it was their main method of communication and storytelling. Bahn and Bahn write, "To Greeks the spoken word was a living thing and infinitely preferable to the dead symbols of a written language." [[Socrates]] himself believed that once something has been written down, it lost its ability for change and growth. For these reasons, among many others, oral storytelling flourished in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = A History of Oral Interpretation|author1=Bahn, Eugene  |author2=Margaret L. Bahn |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher = Burgess Publishing Company|year = 1970|location = Minneapolis, MN|pages = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek tragedy as we know it was created in Athens around the time of 532 BC, when [[Thespis]] was the earliest recorded actor. Being a winner of the first theatrical contest held in Athens, he was the ''exarchon'', or leader,&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle, '[[Poetics]]'&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[dithyramb]]s performed in and around Attica, especially at the rural [[Dionysia]]. By Thespis' time, the dithyramb had evolved far away from its cult roots. Under the influence of heroic epic, Doric choral lyric and the innovations of the poet Arion, it had become a narrative, ballad-like genre. Because of these, Thespis is often called the "Father of Tragedy"; however, his importance is disputed, and Thespis is sometimes listed as late as 16th in the chronological order of Greek tragedians; the statesman [[Solon]], for example, is credited with creating poems in which characters speak with their own voice, and spoken performances of [[Homer]]'s epics by [[rhapsode]]s were popular in festivals prior to 534 BC.&lt;ref name="Brockett"&gt;{{harvp|Brockett|1999|pp=16–17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, Thespis's true contribution to drama is unclear at best, but his name has been given a longer life, in English, as a common term for performer — i.e., a "thespian."

The dramatic performances were important to the Athenians – this is made clear by the creation of a tragedy competition and festival in the City Dionysia. This was organized possibly to foster loyalty among the tribes of Attica (recently created by [[Cleisthenes]]). The festival was created roughly around 508 BC. While no drama texts exist from the sixth century BC, we do know the names of three competitors besides Thespis: Choerilus, Pratinas, and [[Phrynichus (tragic poet)|Phrynichus]]. Each is credited with different innovations in the field.

More is known about Phrynichus. He won his first competition between 511 BC and 508 BC. He produced tragedies on themes and subjects later exploited in the golden age such as the ''Danaids'', ''Phoenician Women'' and ''Alcestis''. He was the first poet we know of to use a historical subject – his ''Fall of Miletus'', produced in 493-2, chronicled the fate of the town of Miletus after it was conquered by the Persians. Herodotus reports that "the Athenians made clear their deep grief for the taking of Miletus in many ways, but especially in this: when Phrynichus wrote a play entitled "The Fall of Miletus" and produced it, the whole theatre fell to weeping; they fined Phrynichus a thousand drachmas for bringing to mind a calamity that affected them so personally and forbade the performance of that play forever."&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus:text:1999.01.0126:book=6:chapter=21 Herodotus, ''Histories'', 6/21]{{Dead link|date=July 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is also thought to be the first to use female characters (though not female performers).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brockett|1999|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the [[Hellenistic civilization|Hellenistic period]], all tragedies were unique pieces written in honour of Dionysus and played only once, so that today we primarily have the pieces that were still remembered well enough to have been repeated when the repetition of old tragedies became fashionable (the accidents of survival, as well as the subjective tastes of the Hellenistic librarians later in Greek history, also played a role in what survived from this period).

==New inventions during the classical period==
[[File:Theater of Dionysius, Athens, Greece. (2826099154).jpg|thumbnail|left|Theater of Dionysus, Athens, Greece. Brooklyn Museum Archives, Goodyear Archival Collection]]
After the Great Destruction of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] by the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian Empire]] in 480 BCE, the town and acropolis were rebuilt, and theatre became formalized and an even greater part of Athenian culture and civic pride. This century is normally regarded as the [[Age of Pericles|Golden Age]] of Greek drama. The centre-piece of the annual Dionysia, which took place once in winter and once in spring, was a competition between three tragic playwrights at the [[Theatre of Dionysus]]. Each submitted three tragedies, plus a satyr play (a comic, [[burlesque]] version of a mythological subject). Beginning in a first competition in 486 BC each playwright submitted a comedy.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kuritz|1988|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Aristotle]] claimed that [[Aeschylus]] added the second actor ([[deuteragonist]]), and that [[Sophocles]] introduced the third ([[tritagonist]]). Apparently the Greek playwrights never used more than three actors based on what is known about Greek theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Kuritz|1988|p=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Greek Tragedy|Tragedy]] and [[Ancient Greek comedy|comedy]] were viewed as completely separate genres, and no plays ever merged aspects of the two. [[Satyr play]]s dealt with the mythological subject matter of the tragedies, but in a purely comedic manner.

==Hellenistic period==

[[File:Relief with Menander and New Comedy Masks - Princeton Art Museum.jpg|thumb|left|Roman, [[Roman Republic|Republican]] or [[Roman Empire|Early Imperial]], ''Relief of a seated poet ([[Menander]]) with masks of New Comedy'', 1st century B.C. – early 1st century A.D., [[Princeton University Art Museum]]]]

The power of Athens declined following its defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]] against the Spartans. From that time on, the theatre started performing old tragedies again. Although its theatrical traditions seem to have lost their vitality, Greek theatre continued into the [[Hellenistic]] period (the period following [[Alexander the Great]]'s conquests in the fourth century BCE). However, the primary Hellenistic theatrical form was not tragedy but '[[Greek comedy#New Comedy|New Comedy]]', comic episodes about the lives of ordinary citizens. The only extant playwright from the period is [[Menander]]. One of New Comedy's most important contributions was its influence on Roman comedy, an influence that can be seen in the surviving works of [[Plautus]] and [[Terence]].

==Characteristics of the buildings==
[[File:Ancient Greek theatre in Delos 01.jpg|thumb|Ancient Greek theatre in [[Delos]]]]
[[File:Delphi Composite.jpg|thumb|The Ancient Theatre of [[Delphi]].]]
The plays had a chorus from 12 to 15&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Jansen|2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; people, who performed the plays in verse accompanied by music, beginning in the morning and lasting until the evening. The performance space was a simple circular space, the ''orchestra'', where the chorus danced and sang. The orchestra, which had an average diameter of 78 feet, was situated on a flattened terrace at the foot of a hill, the slope of which produced a natural ''theatron'', literally "seeing place". Later, the term "theatre" came to be applied to the whole area of theatron, orchestra, and skené. The ''[[coryphaeus]]'' was the head chorus member who could enter the story as a character able to interact with the characters of a play.

[[File:GriechTheater2.PNG|thumb|right|A drawing of an ancient theatre. Terms are in [[Greek language]] and [[Latin letters]].]]
The theatres were originally built on a very large scale to accommodate the large number of people on stage, as well as the large number of people in the audience, up to fourteen thousand. Mathematics played a large role in the construction of these theatres, as their designers had to be able to create [[acoustics]] in them such that the actors' voices could be heard throughout the theatre, including the very top row of seats. The Greek's understanding of acoustics compares very favourably with the current state of the art. The first seats in Greek theatres (other than just sitting on the ground) were wooden, but around 499 BCE the practice of inlaying stone blocks into the side of the hill to create permanent, stable seating became more common. They were called the "prohedria" and reserved for priests and a few most respected citizens.

In 465 BCE, the playwrights began using a backdrop or scenic wall, which hung or stood behind the orchestra, which also served as an area where actors could change their costumes. It was known as the ''[[Skene (theatre)|skênê]]'' (from which the word "[[Scene (drama)|scene]]" derives). The death of a character was always heard behind the ''skênê'', for it was considered inappropriate to show a killing in view of the audience.{{Citation needed|date=January 2013}} Conversely, there are scholarly arguments that death in Greek tragedy was portrayed off stage primarily because of dramatic considerations, and not prudishness or sensitivity of the audience.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Pathmanathan|1965}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 425 BC a stone scene wall, called a paraskenia, became a common supplement to ''skênê'' in the theatres. A paraskenia was a long wall with projecting sides, which may have had doorways for entrances and exits. Just behind the paraskenia was the proskenion. The proskenion ("in front of the scene") was beautiful, and was similar to the modern day [[proscenium]].

Greek theatres also had tall arched entrances called [[parodos|parodoi]] or [[eisodos|eisodoi]], through which actors and chorus members entered and exited the orchestra. By the end of the 5th century BC, around the time of the Peloponnesian War, the ''skênê'', the back wall, was two stories high. The upper story was called the episkenion. Some theatres also had a raised speaking place on the orchestra called the logeion.

===Scenic elements===
There were several scenic elements commonly used in Greek theatre:

* ''[[mechane]]'', a [[Crane (machine)|crane]] that gave the impression of a flying actor (thus, ''[[deus ex machina]]'')
* ''[[Ekkyklema|ekkyklêma]]'', a wheeled platform often used to bring dead characters into view for the audience
* ''[[Pinax|pinakes]]'', pictures hung to create scenery
* ''thyromata'', more complex pictures built into the second-level scene (3rd level from ground)
* [[phallic]] props were used for [[satyr plays]], symbolizing [[fertility]] in honour of [[Dionysus]].

==Masks==

===Masks===
[[File:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|Tragic Comic Masks [[Hadrian's Villa]] mosaic]]

The Ancient Greek term for a [[mask]] is ''prosopon'' (lit., "face"),&lt;ref&gt;[http://perseus.uchicago.edu/cgi-bin/philologic/getobject.pl?c.62:2:190.LSJ Liddell &amp; Scott via Perseus @ UChicago]&lt;/ref&gt; and was a significant element in the worship of [[Dionysus]] at [[Athens]], likely used in ceremonial rites and celebrations. Most of the evidence comes from only a few vase paintings of the 5th century BC, such as one showing a mask of the god suspended from a tree with decorated robe hanging below it and dancing and the ''Pronomos'' vase,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/image?lookup=1993.01.0669 Tufts.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; which depicts actors preparing for a [[Satyr play]].&lt;ref name="Vervain 2004. p.255"&gt;{{harvp|Vervain|Wiles|2004|p=255}}&lt;/ref&gt; No physical evidence remains available to us, as the masks were made of organic materials and not considered permanent objects, ultimately being dedicated at the altar of Dionysus after performances. Nevertheless, the mask is known to have been used since the time of [[Aeschylus]] and considered to be one of the iconic conventions of classical Greek theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Varakis|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Masks were also made for members of the chorus, who play some part in the action and provide a commentary on the events in which they are caught up. Although there are twelve or fifteen members of the tragic chorus they all wear the same mask because they are considered to be representing one character.

===Mask details ===
[[File:3304 - Athens - Stoà of Attalus Museum - Theatre mask - Photo by Giovanni Dall'Orto, Nov 9 2009.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Mask dating from the 4th/3rd century BC, [[Stoa of Attalos]]]]

Illustrations of theatrical masks from 5th century display helmet-like masks, covering the entire face and head, with holes for the eyes and a small aperture for the mouth, as well as an integrated wig. These paintings never show actual masks on the actors in performance; they are most often shown being handled by the actors before or after a performance, that liminal space between the audience and the stage, between myth and reality.&lt;ref name="Vervain vjdivimcl
way in which the mask was to 'melt' into the face and allow the actor to vanish into the role.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Vervain|Wiles|2004|p=256}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effectively, the mask transformed the actor as much as memorization of the text. Therefore, performance in ancient Greece did not distinguish the masked actor from the theatrical character.

The mask-makers were called ''skeuopoios'' or "maker of the properties," thus suggesting that their role encompassed multiple duties and tasks. The masks were most likely made out of light weight, organic materials like stiffened linen, leather, wood, or cork, with the wig consisting of human or animal hair.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brooke|1962|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the visual restrictions imposed by these masks, it was imperative that the actors hear in order to orient and balance themselves. Thus, it is believed that the ears were covered by substantial amounts of hair and not the helmet-mask itself. The mouth opening was relatively small, preventing the mouth to be seen during performances. Vervain and Wiles posit that this small size discourages the idea that the mask functioned as a megaphone, as originally presented in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Vervain 2004. p.255"/&gt; Greek mask-maker, Thanos Vovolis, suggests that the mask serves as a resonator for the head, thus enhancing vocal acoustics and altering its quality. This leads to increased energy and presence, allowing for the more complete metamorphosis of the actor into his character.&lt;ref name="Vovolis"&gt;{{harvp|Vovolis|Zamboulakis|2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mask functions===
[[File:Theatre mask mosaic MAN Napoli Inv9994.jpg|thumb|left|Mosaic detail from the [[House of the Faun]]]]
In a large open-air theatre, like the [[Theatre of Dionysus]] in [[Athens]], the classical masks were able to create a sense of dread in the audience creating large scale panic, especially since they had intensely exaggerated facial features and expressions.&lt;ref name="Vovolis"/&gt; They enabled an actor to appear and reappear in several different roles, thus preventing the audience from identifying the actor to one specific character. Their variations help the audience to distinguish sex, age, and social status, in addition to revealing a change in a particular character's appearance, e.g. Oedipus after blinding himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Brockett|Ball|2000|p=70}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unique masks were also created for specific characters and events in a play, such as [[The Furies]] in [[Aeschylus]]' ''[[Oresteia|Eumenides]]'' and [[Pentheus]] and [[Cadmus]] in [[Euripides]]' ''[[The Bacchae]]''. Worn by the chorus, the masks created a sense of unity and uniformity, while representing a multi-voiced persona or single organism and simultaneously encouraged interdependency and a heightened sensitivity between each individual of the group. Only 2-3 actors were allowed on the stage at one time, and masks permitted quick transitions from one character to another. There were only male actors, but masks allowed them to play female characters.

===Other costume details===
[[File:Comedy and tragedy masks.svg|thumb|Comedy and tragedy masks]]
{{see also|Sock and buskin}}
The actors in these plays that had tragic roles wore boots called ''cothurni'' that elevated them above the other actors. The actors with comedic roles only wore a thin soled shoe called a [[sock]]. For this reason, dramatic art is sometimes alluded to as "Sock and Buskin."

[[Melpomene]] is the [[muse]] of tragedy and is often depicted holding the tragic mask and wearing cothurni. [[Thalia (muse)|Thalia]] is the muse of comedy and is similarly associated with the mask of comedy and the comedic "socks".

Male actors playing female roles would wear a wooden structure on their chests (posterneda) to imitate the look of breasts and another structure on their stomachs (progastreda) to make them appear softer and more lady like. They would also wear white body stockings under their costumes to make their skin appear fairer.

Most costuming detail comes from pottery paintings from that time as costumes and masks were fabricated out of disposable material, so there are little to no remains of any costume from that time. The biggest source of information is the Pronomos Vase where actors are painted at a show's after party.

Costuming would give off a sense of character, as in gender, age, social status, and class. For example, characters of higher class would be dressed in nicer clothing, although everyone was dressed fairly nicely. Contrary to popular belief, they did not dress in only rags and sandals, as they wanted to impress. Some examples of Greek theatre costuming include long robes called the chiton that reached the floor for actors playing gods, heroes, and old men. Actors playing Goddesses and women characters that held a lot of power wore purples and golds. Actors playing Queens and Princesses wore long cloaks that dragged on the ground and were decorated with gold stars and other jewels, and warriors were dressed in a variety of armor and wore helmets adorned with plumes. Costumes were supposed to be colourful and obvious to be easily seen by every seat in the audience.

'''''Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear''''' is a [[tactical shooter|tactical]] [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] [[video game developer|developed]] and [[video game publisher|published]] in 1999 by [[Ubi Soft Milan]] and [[Red Storm Entertainment]]. It is the sequel to 1998's ''[[Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six (video game)|Rainbow Six]]'' game based on the [[Tom Clancy]] [[Rainbow Six (novel)|novel]] of the same name.

''Rogue Spear'' is based on the same game engine and features gameplay and presentation similar to that of the original ''Rainbow Six''. The game pits the [[counter-terrorist]] unit, Rainbow, against global terrorist organizations that in some cases have taken hostages or have armed themselves with [[weapons of mass destruction]]. ''Rogue Spear'' focuses on realism, planning, strategy, and teamwork. ''Tom Clancy's Rainbow Six: Rogue Spear'' was released for [[Microsoft Windows]] on August 31, 1999, with versions for the [[Mac OS]] (2000), [[Dreamcast]] (2000), [[PlayStation (console)|PlayStation]] (2001), and [[Game Boy Advance]] (2002) released later. A [[PlayStation 2]] port was also announced at the time, but it was later canceled.

==Plot==
Following the collapse of the [[Soviet Union]] in 1991, the economic situation in Russia and the former Eastern Europe falls into chaos. Terrorism in the region is commonplace as people fight a seemingly endless stream of battles for supplies and other necessities. In this power vacuum though a dangerous a situation arises: the [[Russian mafia]] has begun buying up surplus military equipment with the assistance of current members of the [[Russian Army]]. During one such arms deal Rainbow forces raid the meeting grounds and recover [[weapons grade plutonium]], tracing the missile material to an Arctic naval base. As it turns out, one boss in the Oil Mafia has been supplying arms and intel to various small-time terrorist groups whose international attacks Rainbow has had to deal with: A hostage situation at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art|Met]] in New York City, the attempted bombing of a tanker in the Sea of Japan, an airline hijacking in Brussels, and the neofascist takeover of a London TV station. But after the hijacking, an anonymous informant who has seen that this terror campaign has gone too far supplies information to Rainbow on who's behind the attacks and where his men will strike next.

A subsequent investigation reveals that the plutonium deals are part of a plan between a Russian organized crime boss named Maxim Kutkin and Azeri arms dealer Samed Vezirzade. These two men intend to use the plutonium purchased from the military to create suitcase sized nuclear weapons through the use of abandoned Russian military facilities, then distribute these weapons to terrorists on the [[black market]]. To prevent any instance of nuclear terrorism, Rainbow mobilizes against both parties, raiding the nuclear weapons production facility and intercepting two separate meetings between the mob and potential buyers with the aid of a dissident group of the Russian mob.

In the final two missions Rainbow zeros in Vezirzade's base of operations, raiding his fortress and killing him after an attempt to bring him in alive fails. In the aftermath of Vezirzade's death, Kutkin realizes that the overall plan to manufacture and sell nuclear weapons has failed, and seeks vengeance for the collapse of the arms deals. With the assistance of a small number of men loyal to him, Kutkin seizes control of a commercial [[nuclear power plant]] and threatens to shut off the cooling system for the reactors, which would result in a [[nuclear meltdown]]. To prevent a potential repeat of the [[Chernobyl disaster]], Rainbow forces storm the plant and manage to recapture the facility intact.

In the final debriefing, Kutkin is confirmed to have been killed in the raid. His mansion in Russia is acquired by the "Russian Godfather", whose assistance had been vital during Rainbow's operations (it turns out he was the anonymous informant, and Kutkin was his own insane son-in-law). After arriving at the mansion, the Russian Godfather makes a short speech which is picked up by surveillance bugs planted during an earlier Rainbow intelligence operation. The godfather then shoots the bug, preventing any further monitoring of the mafia from the mansion.

The term "Rogue Spear" was invented by Clancy and refers to the possession of nuclear weapons by a non-state entity, equivalent to the official terminology [[United States military nuclear incident terminology|Pinnacle-Empty Quiver]].

==Multiplayer== 
Rogue Spear’s [[online multiplayer]] consists of two modes: cooperative and adversarial. In cooperative mode, individuals team up with other players to complete missions against the computer AI in formats similar to the single-player missions. Adversarial mode pits players against one another with Survival, a mode similar to [[Deathmatch]], and Team Survival, similar to [[Team Deathmatch]] garnering the vast majority of play. Rogue Spear does not support [[Game server#Dedicated server|dedicated servers]], with games being limited to sixteen players per server. An active competitive scene has surrounded the game, with players forming [[Clan (video games)|clans]] and participating in [[Ladder tournament|ladder play]].

==Add-ons==

===Urban Operations===
''Rogue Spear Mission Pack: Urban Operations'', released on April 4, 2000, was the first expansion for ''Rogue Spear''. It was developed and published by Red Storm Entertainment. It added eight new maps and five classic ''Rainbow Six'' maps from the original game, as well as three new weapons.

''Urban Operations'' was re-released by KAMA Digital Entertainment in South Korea - this new edition included two exclusive missions and two new weapons.

===Mod system===
With the release of ''Urban Operations'', a built-in mod system was added to manage user-made "[[Mod (computer gaming)|mods]]" or modifications.

===Covert Ops Essentials===
''Rainbow Six: Covert Ops'' is a stand-alone expansion pack of ''Rogue Spear''. The training simulator was developed by Magic Lantern Playware, six of the levels were done by [[Zombie Studios]] and three of the levels were done by Red Storm Entertainment. It was published by Red Storm Entertainment. It was released on September 28, 2000. It included nine new missions, because the product was primarily developed as an educational program on real life counter-terrorism history and tactics.

The training simulator developed by Magic Lantern Playware was actually a Computer Based Training program. "Recruits" would create a profile, and then read educational materials such as actual military Field Manuals, view video interviews from anti-terrorist experts, take multiple-choice tests to progress in rank, and see live-fire demonstrations of the weapons included in the game. For the live-fire videos, Sergeant Anthony Levatino (now Deputy Chief) from the [[Santa Ana, California]] Police Department was contracted to provide content expertise for the educational material and for the on-camera demonstrations. Having access to all the weapons included in the game, and being a SWAT Team Leader/Sniper and SWAT Academy instructor, Sergeant Levatino provided brief weapon introductions and live-fire demonstrations.

===Black Thorn===
''Rogue Spear: Black Thorn'' was developed by Red Storm Entertainment, published by [[Ubisoft]], and released as a stand-alone add-on on December 15, 2001, featuring new singleplayer and multiplayer maps, along with new weapons and a new multiplayer game mode. The singleplayer plot features a mentally disturbed ex-SAS operative challenging Team Rainbow with reenactments of real-life terrorist attacks, such as the [[Entebbe Operation]] and the [[Japanese embassy hostage crisis]].

'''''Vera Blanc''''' is an Italian mystery [[visual novel]] video game series for the [[Android (operating system)|Android]], [[iOS]], [[Linux]], [[Mac OS]], and [[Microsoft Windows]] platforms, with art in the [[comic]] style. The games were developed and published by [[Winter Wolves]]. The first game ''Vera Blanc: Full Moon'' was released on June 30, 2010 and the sequel ''Vera Blanc: Ghost In The Castle'' on September 1, 2010. There are currently no plans for another sequel of the series.

The first game was ported for iOS on October 13, 2010 and for Android on February 2, 2011. The second game was ported for iOS on November 30, 2010.

==Gameplay==
The player reads through the story and makes decisions at some points. Furthermore, the player has to solve some mysteries with minigames; the protagonist, Vera, for example can sometimes read the minds of other characters, so the player has to guess letters in the style of [[Hangman (game)|Hangman]] to complete the thoughts of them. The player can also disable the minigames and just read the story without them.

==Plot==

===Vera Blanc: Full Moon===
Vera Blanc, the daughter of Emmanuel Blanc, can read other people's minds. She leaves her life of luxury to use her powers to work alongside paranormal detective Brandon Mackey. Vera travels to a mysterious town in Germany deep in the Black Forest. A serial killer is on the loose, and all leads point to a werewolf as the culprit.

===Vera Blanc: Ghost In The Castle===
Vera travels to a small village in central Italy. The town's legendary ghost seems like nothing more than a quaint story, but a string of murders and suicides all point to the castle's ghost, and locals are getting scared.

==Reception==
The first game got 4 out of 5 stars on ''[[Gamezebo]]'' with reviewer Mike Rose writing: "Vera Blanc: Full Moon is well worth a play, and will keep you hooked right through to the end."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezebo.com/games/vera-blanc-episode-1-full-moon/review|author=Mike Rose|title=Vera Blanc - Episode 1: Full Moon Review|publisher =[[Gamezebo]]|date=8 July 2010|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It also got a score of  91/100 on ''Technologytell'' with reviewer Jenni Lada writing: "Overall, Vera Blanc: Full Moon is an appealing new mystery visual novel. It stands out due to its unorthodox presentation and its supernatural mystery. While the character of Vera may seem a bit too good to be true, the story that players get to investigate is quite intriguing, especially since your choices effect what kind of ending and result you’ll find."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.technologytell.com/gaming/58307/gamertell-review-vera-blanc-full-moon-for-windows-pc-mac-and-linux/|author=Jenni Lada|title=Gamertell Review: Vera Blanc: Full Moon for Windows, Mac and Linux|date=7 July 2010|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second game got 3,5 out of 5 stars on ''Gamezebo'' with reviewer Mike Rose writing: "Vera Blanc: Ghost in the Castle isn't as well produced as the original, but there's still plenty of fun to be had, and those who played Full Moon will no doubt want to see how Vera's story progresses."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamezebo.com/games/vera-blanc-episode-2-ghost-castle/review|author=Mike Rose|title=Vera Blanc - Episode 2: Ghost in the Castle Review|publisher =[[Gamezebo]]|date=7 September 2010|accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Walt Disney Parks and Resorts''', officially '''Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide, Inc.''' and informally known as '''Disney Parks''', was one of [[The Walt Disney Company]]'s four major business segments and a subsidiary.&lt;ref name=sbz&gt;{{cite web|title=Detail by Entity Name: Walt Disney Parks and Resorts Worldwide, Inc.|url=http://search.sunbiz.org/Inquiry/CorporationSearch/SearchResultDetail?inquirytype=EntityName&amp;directionType=ForwardList&amp;searchNameOrder=WALTDISNEYPARKSRESORTSWORLDWID%20F090000012040&amp;aggregateId=forp-f09000001204-dfbb7cc6-7dee-4d8b-bbef-3244c551d808&amp;searchTerm=Walt%20Disney%20Parks%20and%20Resorts%20Worldwide&amp;listNameOrder=WALTDISNEYPARKSRESORTSWORLDWID%20F090000012040|website=SunBiz.org|publisher=Florida Department of State Division of Corporations|accessdate=October 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded in 1971, following the opening of [[Magic Kingdom]] at [[Walt Disney World]] in Florida.

Originally, the company was known as '''Walt Disney Outdoor Recreation Division''' and later as '''Walt Disney Attractions'''.

==Background==
{{main|Disneyland, Inc.}}
In 1949, [[Ice Capades]] added a Disney segment to its performances. Costumes from those shows were used at the opening of Disneyland in 1955 with some performers hired away for Disney.&lt;ref name=jhm&gt;{{cite news|last1=Korkis|first1=Jim|title=Wednesdays with Wade: 25 years of "Disney on Ice"|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/alumni1/b/wade_sampson/archive/2005/09/14/1278.aspx|accessdate=July 30, 2015|work=JimHillMedia|date=September 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally, entry into the theme park and travel business was a side project of Walt Disney himself. As the Disneylandia project started to become a reality, [[The Walt Disney Company|Walt Disney Productions]] at Walt's request set up Disneyland, Inc. (DLI) in 1951 and agreed to a design deal in March 1953 with [[Retlaw Enterprises|WED Enterprises (WED)]], [[Walt Disney|Walt]]'s personal corporation, which then included what would now be called [[Walt Disney Imagineering|Disney Imagineering]].&lt;ref name=hwrg&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aberdeen|first1=J.

With a need for the [[Disneyland Hotel (California)|Disneyland Hotel]] nearby and no funding available for Disney to build it, Walt Disney approached [[Jack Wrather]] to build the hotel who agreed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Kimler|first1=Forest|title=Jack Built More Than a House|url=http://2.bp.blogspot.com/_OYARMoeQUr4/TH_wXKWs_pI/AAAAAAAABnU/XnEcgWwEtwk/s1600/1978+newspaper+2aa.JPG |accessdate=August 28, 2015 |work=Orange County Register|date=September 11, 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Beginning in 1958 with the contracting of Economics Research Associates (ERA) to find a location for another Disney resort, Disney Productions moved beyond a single park. ERA recommended Florida; another study in 1961 named [[Ocala, Florida|Ocala]] or [[Orlando]] in Florida as possible locations. In {{dts|1963|11}}, Walt Disney made a trip to Florida for final site selection.&lt;ref name=p48 group=CDW&gt;Walt Disney - An American Original, by Bob Thomas, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;sup&gt;:333, 334&lt;/sup&gt; In 1962, Disney Productions purchased [[Celebrity Sports Center]] (opened on September 17, 1960, in Denver, Colorado) from its owners, including Walt Disney, [[Art Linkletter]], and [[John Payne (actor)|John Payne]], to use as a staff training center for its second resort.&lt;ref name=d23a&gt;{{cite web|title=Celebrity Sports Center|url=https://d23.com/a-to-z/celebrity-sports-center/|website=D23.com|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|accessdate=October 6, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963, Roy made plans to buy from {{convert|5,000|to|10,000|acre}}, which was carried out in 1964, amassing {{convert|27,443|acre}} by {{dts|1965|10}}.&lt;ref group=CDW&gt;Building a Company - Roy O.

Disney expanded into attractions at the [[1964 New York World's Fair]] with [[It's a Small World]]&lt;ref name=gma/&gt; and costumed character appearances. When the characters proved a hit at the 1964 World's Fair, Walt wanted another outlet for "live" characters; thus, Disneyland put on ''Disney on Parade'', a self-produced live arena show starting in 1969.&lt;ref name=jhm/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Live Disney Characters in Traveling Arena Show|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=rDwwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ySoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3905%2C4281044|accessdate=July 30, 2015|work=The News and the Eastern Townships Advocate|issue=Vol. 123 No. 45|publisher=E.R.

In 1965, Walt Disney won a bid with the [[US Forest Service]] to develop [[Mineral King]] as a ski resort. The [[Sierra Club]] sued in {{dts|1969|6}} to stop the development, which was granted by the federal district judge. The Forest Service appealed and won at the appeal and the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court ruling left open to the Club the possibility of refiling. In the next round of lawsuits, the same district judge blocked the redevelopment. The injunction and the passage of the [[National Environmental Policy Act]] led to Disney backing out.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hcn.org/wotr/the-saga-of-mineral-king |title=The saga of Mineral King |date=February 2, 2009 |newspaper=High Country News |accessdate=September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

$40 million worth of Walt Disney Productions Convertible [[Debenture]]s were sold in {{dts|1968|1}} to fund Disney World (WDW). The next year in February, an agreement was made with multiple labor unions, in which the unions exchanged the right to strike for regular pay increases during the first building phase.&lt;ref group=CDW&gt;{{cite news|work=U.S. News &amp; World Report|last1=Cooper|first1=M|last2=Friedman|first2=D|title=Empire of the Sun|date=May 28, 1990|page=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1971, chairman of the Park Operations Committee and vice president of park operations Dick Nunis was appointed executive vice president of Disneyland and Walt Disney World.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Disney Legend: Dick Nunis|url=https://d23.com/walt-disney-legend/dick-nunis/|website=d23|publisher=The Walt Disney Company|accessdate=October 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walt Disney World]] began operation on {{dts|1971|10|1}}, with the [[Magic Kingdom]] park at a cost of $400 million. The Magic Kingdom had six themed lands: Main Street, Adventureland, Fantasyland, Frontierland, Liberty Square, and Tomorrowland.&lt;ref group=CDW&gt;{{cite book|title=Birnbaum's Walt Disney World 1997|date=1996|publisher=Hearst Business Publishing|page=15|accessdate=September 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, Disney's Fort Wilderness Resort campground and two hotels, Disney's Contemporary Resort and Disney's Polynesian Village Resort, also opened.&lt;ref group=CDW&gt;{{cite book| last1=Smith|first1=Dave |title=Disney A to Z - The Official Encyclopedia|date=1996|accessdate=September 22, 2015|page=103,191,397}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disneyland expanded in 1972 with a seventh themed land, [[Bear Country (Disneyland)|Bear Country]], replacing the Indian Village of Frontierland, and later renamed Critter Country.

==Training==
Founded by Walt Disney in 1955, each new employee at a Disney theme park is trained at a Disney University.  Before classes and on-the-job training specific to the job they will be performing in the park, each employee attends the "Disney Traditions" course where they learn of the philosophies and history of Disney's guest services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yearout|first1=Steve|last2=Weil|first2=Gerry Miles, with Richard Koonce ; foreword by Audrey|title=Growing leaders : a leader-builder handbook for HRD and training professionals, business executives and managers, executive coaches|date=2001|publisher=ASTD|location=Alexandria, VA|isbn=1562862898|page=193}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lipp|first1=Doug|title=Disney U : how Disney University develops the world's most engaged, loyal, and customer-centric employees|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0071808078}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abandoned and misreported concepts==
Disney had plans to build [[Walt Disney's Riverfront Square]] in [[St. Louis]]. In July 1965, Disney canceled the project.

In the 1960s, Disney initiated a plan for a ski resort at [[Mineral King]] in California. Opposition from environmental groups led by the [[Sierra Club]] led to a temporary court injunction in 1969 and legal battles through the 1970s. The project's planning and scale changed multiple times, and in 1978, Mineral King was annexed into [[Sequoia National Park]], ending any possibility of developing a ski resort.&lt;ref name="ski"&gt;{{cite book|title=Challenge of the Big Trees|last=Dilsaver|first=L.M.|author2=Tweed, W.C. |chapter=New Directions and a Second Century (1972–1990)|year=1990|publisher=Sequoia Natural History Association |chapterurl= http://www.nps.gov/history/history/online_books/dilsaver-tweed/chap9c.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney reportedly had plans to build a park named [[Disney's America]]. The park was to have been located in [[Haymarket, Virginia]], but local opposition to the idea persuaded Disney to abandon the idea in 1994. On September 28, 1994, [[Michael Eisner]] announced that Disney was canceling its plans to build Disney's America after a bruising national media fight with Protect Historic America and aggressive local opposition in Virginia from Protect Prince William and other citizen groups.

Disney had plans to build a Disneyland in Sydney, Australia, between 2007 and 2008 with the proposed name "Disney Wharf at Sydney Harbour", but the concept was abandoned due to mixed responses in the [[Government of New South Wales|New South Wales Government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/walt-disney-company-proposed-a-disney-resort-in-sydney-20140111-30nfk.html|title=Walt Disney Company proposed a Disney Resort in Sydney|work=The Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=October 4, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In early January 2011, conflicting reports emerged regarding Disney's involvement in a proposed entertainment complex in Haifa, Israel, whose plans include a small (30,000 square meter) amusement park scheduled to open in 2013. The project will be partially funded by [[Shamrock Holdings]], a Disney-affiliated investment firm. In the wake of reports from Israeli business newspaper ''[[Globes]]'' and industry newswire ''Amusement Management'' that Disney itself would be involved in the project's development, a spokesperson for Walt Disney Parks and Resorts clarified to ''[[Fast Company (magazine)|Fast Company]]'' that Disney did not have any plans to involve itself in the building of the park.&lt;ref&gt;Ungerleider, Neal.

==Future projects==

It was reported in August 2014 that beginning in 2015, Disney planned to expand the presence of ''[[Star Wars]]'' throughout their theme parks (though it was initially unclear which parks) and could also create an entire theme park area dedicated to the film franchise. Disney Chairman and CEO [[Bob Iger]] indicated that plans were to match what [[Universal Orlando Resort|Universal Orlando]] did when they expanded and added a [[Harry Potter]] themed section to two of their theme parks. In 2012, Disney acquired [[Lucasfilm]], which includes the rights to the ''Star Wars'' franchise and ''[[Indiana Jones]]'' franchise (which is also expected to see an increase in presence at the theme parks), and in December 2015, Disney released ''[[Star Wars: The Force Awakens]]'', the first of a new trilogy of films.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/disney-bring-more-star-wars-attractions-theme-parks-111904441.html|title=Disney to bring more 'Star Wars' attractions to its theme parks|publisher=Yahoo.com|date=August 6, 2015|accessdate=August 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=not the original source, AFP Relaxnews, and Yahoo will drop the page at some point|date=October 2015}} [[Star Wars: Galaxy's Edge]] was announced on August 15, 2015 as Star Wars Land, and is currently under construction at the Disneyland Resort in California and Disney's Hollywood Studios in Florida. Both lands are set to open in 2019. At D23 Expo 2017, Disney Parks chairman Bob Chapek revealed Galaxy's Edge as the area's official name, announcing an attraction set inside the hangar bay of a First Order Star Destroyer. The Disneyland version of Galaxy's Edge is currently slated to open first, with the Walt Disney World version following later in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2017/07/star-wars-galaxys-edge-announced-as-name-for-star-wars-lands-at-disney-parks/|title=Star Wars: Galaxy’s Edge Announced as Name for Star Wars Lands at Disney Parks|publisher=disneyparks.disney.go.com|date=July 15, 2017|accessdate=August 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, it was announced that a Star Wars-themed hotel and resort are planned for Walt Disney World; the company aims for guest experiences to be "100% immersive", with Chapek claiming that each guest's stay will "culminate in a unique journey".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bevil|first1=Dewayne|title=Disney's 'Star Wars' hotel would escalate immersion trend, experts say|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/travel/attractions/the-daily-disney/os-bz-disney-star-wars-hotel-immersive-20170725-story.html|accessdate=January 9, 2018|work=Orlando Sentinel|date=July 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2011, Walt Disney Parks and Resorts announced plans to partner with filmmaker [[James Cameron]] and his [[Lightstorm Entertainment]] production company, along with [[20th Century Fox]], to develop theme park attractions based on Cameron's ''[[Avatar (2009 film)|Avatar]]'' film franchise, with the first installation planned for [[Disney's Animal Kingdom]] at [[Walt Disney World]], in the form of [[Pandora – The World of Avatar|a themed land]]. The expansion, named "Pandora&amp;mdash;The World of Avatar", opened on May 27, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2015/biz/news/disney-pushing-boundaries-with-avatar-land-at-animal-kingdom-theme-park-1201442369/|title=Disney Provides Update of ‘Avatar’ Land at Animal Kingdom - Variety|author=Marc Graser|work=Variety}}&lt;/ref&gt; Future Avatar-themed lands could be built for the other Disney Resorts, including the locations in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

Both Hong Kong Disneyland Resort and Disneyland Paris Resort have room for future expansion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Disney in talks to open theme park in Shanghai – report | url=https://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2006/02/07/afx2507986.html | work=[[AFX News Limited]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080918213515/http://www.forbes.com/markets/feeds/afx/2006/02/07/afx2507986.html|archivedate=September 18, 2008 |date=February 7, 2006 | accessdate=November 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; CEO [[Robert Iger]] frequently has cited international expansion as one of the company's three strategic priorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Top Executive Profiles - Robert A.

==Properties outside Disney parks==
Due to its acquisitions of [[Marvel Entertainment]] in 2009 and [[Lucasfilm]] in 2012, some Disney-owned franchises are represented in its competitors' parks. [[Marvel Super Hero Island]], a themed land featuring characters and settings from [[Marvel Comics]], has operated at [[Universal Orlando]] Resort's [[Islands of Adventure]] park since 1999, as well as the Islands of Adventure cloned ride ''[[The Amazing Adventures of Spider-Man]]'' at [[Universal Studios Japan]] since 2004. Under Marvel's 1994 agreement with [[Universal Parks &amp; Resorts]] in regional terms, none of the Marvel characters and other persons related to such characters (e.g., side characters, team members, and the villains associated with the [[Avengers (comics)|Avengers]], [[Fantastic Four]], [[X-Men]], [[Spider-Man]], etc.) connected with Islands of Adventure and Universal Studios Japan can be used at Walt Disney World and Tokyo Disney Resort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Munarriz|first1=Rick|title=Disney is Taking Too Long to Add Marvel to Disneyland and Disney World|url=http://www.fool.com/investing/general/2015/10/18/disney-is-taking-too-long-to-add-marvel-to-disney.aspx|website=The Motley Fool|accessdate=January 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Disneyland Resort]], Walt Disney World, and Tokyo Disney also cannot use the Marvel name as part of an attraction or marketing and the Marvel-themed [[simulator ride]].&lt;ref name="Marvel Contract"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1262449/000119312510008732/dex1057.htm|title=Marvel Agreement between MCA Inc. and Marvel Entertainment Group|publisher=[[U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission]]|website=sec.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This clause has allowed Walt Disney World to have meet and greets with Marvel characters not associated with the ones at Islands of Adventure, such as [[Star-Lord]] and [[Gamora]] from ''[[Guardians of the Galaxy (film)|Guardians of the Galaxy]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.insidethemagic.net/2014/08/guardians-of-the-galaxy-theme-park-characters-appear-for-first-time-as-walt-disney-world-welcomes-marvel/|title=Guardians of the Galaxy theme park characters appear for first time as Walt Disney World welcomes Marvel|work=Inside the Magic}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2014/07/exclusive-guardians-of-the-galaxy-sneak-peek-debuts-july-4-at-disney-parks/|title=Exclusive ‘Guardians of the Galaxy’ Sneak Peek Debuts July 4 at Disney Parks|work=Disney Parks Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[Baymax]] and [[Hiro Takachiho|Hiro]] from ''[[Big Hero 6 (film)|Big Hero 6]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://disneyparks.disney.go.com/blog/2014/11/the-stars-of-big-hero-6-are-ready-for-their-disney-parks-debut/|title=The Stars of ‘Big Hero 6′ Are Ready for Their Disney Parks Debut|work=Disney Parks Blog}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hong Kong Disneyland, Shanghai Disneyland, and Disneyland Paris either have or planned to incorporate meet and greets as well as attractions relating to the Marvel characters, as well as using the Marvel name and the Marvel simulator ride.

A ''[[Star Wars]]''-themed section of [[Legoland California]]'s [[Legoland California#Miniland USA|Miniland USA]] opened in 2011, with a similar version opening at [[Legoland Florida]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://florida.legoland.com/map-explore/land-views/miniland/attractions/lego-star-wars/|title=LEGO® STAR WARS™|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; in November 2012, just weeks after Disney's acquisition of Lucasfilm and the ''Star Wars'' franchise.

[[IMG Worlds of Adventure]] in [[Dubai]] has a Marvel-themed section.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imgworlds.com/language/en/#&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==
While Disney Parks generally adapt movies into rides, some Disney theme park attractions have been adapted into or have served inspiration for films,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Verrier|first1=Richard|title=Movies Imitate Disney's Parks|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2002/may/15/business/fi-disney15|accessdate=April 1, 2017|work=Los Angeles Times|date=May 15, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;!-- notability source &amp; need to mine for more info --&gt; books,&lt;ref name=kr/&gt; comic books,&lt;ref name=spi/&gt; and [[television pilot]]s. Disney entered the television field with a network TV show named after [[Walt Disney anthology television series|Disneyland]] (which was then its only park, and was being built at the time), in order to fund the park. In this series, some episodes featured the park or a park attraction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Griffin|first1=Sean|title=Encyclopedia of Television|publisher=The Museum of Broadcast Communications|url=http://www.museum.tv/eotv/waltdisneyp.htm|accessdate=April 1, 2017|chapter=Walt Disney Programs}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Walt Disney Company pioneered and is the only film company and theme park company to have converted theme park attractions to film productions.

At first, Disney had merely dabbled with this type of film. [[Walt Disney Television#Disney Telefilms|Disney Telefilms]] made the first movie-based-on-ride, [[Tower of Terror (1997 film)|Tower of Terror]], for the [[Walt Disney anthology television series|Wonderful World of Disney]] anthology television series in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disney Sets ABC Pix|url=https://variety.com/1997/scene/vpage/disney-sets-abc-pix-1117342089/|accessdate=December 30, 2015|work=Variety|date=May 1, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, [[Touchstone Pictures]] made ''[[Mission to Mars]]'' based on the [[Mission to Mars (attraction)|closed ride of the same name]].&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Schwarzbaum|first1=Lisa|title=Mission to Mars|url=http://ew.com/article/2000/03/17/mission-mars-4/|accessdate=March 28, 2017|work=Entertainment Weekly|date=March 17, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Walt Disney Pictures]] took the [[Country Bear Jamboree]] attraction and made it into ''[[The Country Bears]]'' in 2002. In 2003, Walt Disney Pictures issued two ride-based films in ''[[Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl]]'' and ''[[The Haunted Mansion (film)|The Haunted Mansion]]''. ''Pirates of the Caribbean'' launched [[Pirates of the Caribbean (film series)|a film series and a franchise]].&lt;ref name="ew"/&gt; After four Pirates sequels, the franchise took in more than $5.4 billion worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McNary |first1=Dave |last2=Graser |first2=Marc |url=https://variety.com/2013/biz/news/end-of-an-era-disney-and-jerry-bruckheimer-part-ways-1200652789/ |title=End of an Era: Disney and Jerry Bruckheimer Part Ways |date=September 19, 2013  |work=Variety |publisher= |accessdate=March 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Disney Publishing Worldwide]] started mining Disney Parks with its [[The Kingdom Keepers]] series. The first novel of the series, ''Disney after Dark'', was released in 2005.&lt;ref name=kr&gt;{{cite web|title=The Kingdom Keepers (review)|url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/book-reviews/ridley-pearson/the-kingdom-keepers/|publisher=Kirkus Reviews|date=August 15, 2005|accessdate=April 9, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A five-book series was laid out by Pearson, but was extended to seven with the first book's success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hill|first1=Jim|title=Keeping up with Disney's "Kingdom Keepers" : Ridley Pearson talks about all the research that goes into this popular book series|url=http://jimhillmedia.com/editor_in_chief1/b/jim_hill/archive/2011/04/03/keeping-up-with-disney-s-quot-kingdom-keepers-quot-ridley-pearson-talks-about-all-the-research-he-does-for-this-popular-book-series.aspx|accessdate=May 1, 2017|work=jimhillmedia.com|date=April 3, 2011|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
