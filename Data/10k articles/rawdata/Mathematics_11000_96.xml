'''157''' ('''one hundred [and] fifty-seven''') is the number following [[156 (number)|156]] and preceding [[158 (number)|158]].

==In mathematics==
'''157''' is:

* the 37th [[prime number]]. The next prime is 163 and the previous prime is 151, with which 157 forms a [[prime]] triplet.
* a [[balanced prime]], because the arithmetic mean of those primes yields 157.
* an [[emirp]].
* a [[Chen prime]].
* the largest known prime ''p'' which &lt;math&gt;\frac{p^p+1}{p+1}&lt;/math&gt; is also prime. (see {{oeis|id=A056826}}).
* the least [[irregular prime]] with index 2.
* a [[palindromic number]] in bases 7 (313&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;) and 12 (111&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;).
* a [[repunit]] in [[Duodecimal|base 12]], so it is a [[unique prime]] in the same base.

In base 10, 157&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 24649, and 158&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is 24964, which uses the same digits. Numbers having this property are listed in {{oeis|id=A072841}}. The previous entry is [[13 (number)|13]], and the next entry after 157 is [[913 (number)|913]].

The simplest right angle triangle with rational sides that has area 157 has the longest side with a denominator of 45 digits.

{{General geometry |branches}}

'''Algebraic geometry''' is a branch of [[mathematics]], classically studying [[zero of a function|zeros]] of [[multivariate polynomial]]s. Modern algebraic geometry is based on the use of abstract algebraic techniques, mainly from [[commutative algebra]], for solving  [[geometry|geometrical problems]] about these sets of zeros.

The fundamental objects of study in algebraic geometry are [[algebraic variety|algebraic varieties]], which are geometric manifestations of [[solution set|solutions]] of [[systems of polynomial equations]]. Examples of the most studied classes of algebraic varieties are: [[plane algebraic curve]]s, which include [[line (geometry)|lines]], [[circle]]s, [[parabola]]s, [[ellipse]]s, [[hyperbola]]s, [[cubic curve]]s like [[elliptic curve]]s, and quartic curves like [[lemniscate of Bernoulli|lemniscate]]s and [[Cassini oval]]s. A point of the plane belongs to an algebraic curve if its coordinates satisfy a given [[polynomial equation]]. Basic questions involve the study of the points of special interest like the [[singular point of a curve|singular point]]s, the [[inflection point]]s and the [[point at infinity|points at infinity]]. More advanced questions involve the [[topology]] of the curve and relations between the curves given by different equations.

Algebraic geometry occupies a central place in modern mathematics and has multiple conceptual connections with such diverse fields as [[complex analysis]], [[topology]] and [[number theory]]. Initially a study of [[systems of polynomial equations]] in several variables, the subject of algebraic geometry starts where [[equation solving]] leaves off, and it becomes even more important to understand the intrinsic properties of the totality of solutions of a system of equations, than to find a specific solution; this leads into some of the deepest areas in all of mathematics, both conceptually and in terms of technique.
&lt;!-- this paragraph is misplaced in the lead. May be in the history section?

[[Descartes]]'s idea of [[coordinates]] is central to algebraic geometry, because a '''point''' of an algebraic variety is a point whose coordinates are a solution of the equations defining the variety. However it has undergone a series of remarkable transformations beginning in the early 19th century. Before then, the coordinates were assumed to be [[tuple]]s of [[real number]]s, but this changed when first [[complex number]]s, and then elements of an arbitrary [[field (mathematics)|field]] became acceptable. [[Homogeneous coordinates]] of [[projective geometry]] offered an extension of the notion of coordinate system in a different direction, and enriched the scope of algebraic geometry. --&gt;

In the 20th century, algebraic geometry split into several subareas.
* The mainstream of algebraic geometry is devoted to the study of the complex points of the algebraic varieties and more generally to the points with coordinates in an [[algebraically closed field]].
* The study of the points of an algebraic variety with coordinates in the field of the [[rational number]]s or in a [[number field]] became [[arithmetic geometry]] (or more classically Diophantine geometry), a subfield of [[algebraic number theory]].
* The study of the real points of an algebraic variety is the subject of [[real algebraic geometry]].
* A large part of [[singularity theory]] is devoted to the singularities of algebraic varieties.
* With the rise of the computers, a [[#Computational algebraic geometry|computational algebraic geometry]] area has emerged, which lies at the intersection of algebraic geometry and [[computer algebra]]. It consists essentially in developing [[algorithm]]s and [[software]] for studying and finding the properties of explicitly given algebraic varieties.

Much of the development of the mainstream of algebraic geometry in the 20th century occurred within an abstract algebraic framework, with increasing emphasis being placed on "intrinsic" properties of algebraic varieties not dependent on any particular way of embedding the variety in an ambient coordinate space; this parallels developments in [[topology]], [[differential geometry|differential]] and [[complex geometry]]. One key achievement of this abstract algebraic geometry is [[Grothendieck]]'s [[scheme theory]] which allows one to use [[sheaf theory]] to study algebraic varieties in a way which is very similar to its use in the study of [[differential manifold|differential]] and [[complex manifold|analytic manifolds]]. This is obtained by extending the notion of point: In classical algebraic geometry, a point of an affine variety may be identified, through [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]], with a [[maximal ideal]] of the [[coordinate ring]], while the points of the corresponding affine scheme are all prime ideals of this ring. This means that a point of such a scheme may be either a usual point or a subvariety. This approach also enables a unification of the language and the tools of classical algebraic geometry, mainly concerned with complex points, and of algebraic number theory. [[Wiles's proof of Fermat's Last Theorem|Wiles's proof]] of the longstanding conjecture called [[Fermat's last theorem]] is an example of the power of this approach.

==Basic notions==
{{Further|Algebraic variety}}

=== Zeros of simultaneous polynomials ===
[[File:Slanted circle.png|thumb|right|Sphere and slanted circle]]
In classical algebraic geometry, the main objects of interest are the vanishing sets of collections of [[polynomial]]s, meaning the set of all points that simultaneously satisfy one or more [[systems of polynomial equations|polynomial equations]]. For instance, the [[N-sphere|two-dimensional]] [[sphere]] of radius 1 in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; could be defined as the set of all points (''x'',''y'',''z'') with

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2-1=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

A "slanted" circle in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; can be defined as the set of all points (''x'',''y'',''z'') which satisfy the two polynomial equations

:&lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2+z^2-1=0,\,&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;x+y+z=0.\,&lt;/math&gt;

=== Affine varieties ===
{{main|Affine variety}}

First we start with a [[field (mathematics)|field]] ''k''. In classical algebraic geometry, this field was always the complex numbers '''C''', but many of the same results are true if we assume only that ''k'' is [[algebraically closed field|algebraically closed]]. We consider the [[affine space]] of dimension ''n'' over ''k'', denoted '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(''k'') (or more simply '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, when ''k'' is clear from the context). When one fixes a coordinate system, one may identify '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;(''k'') with ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The purpose of not working with ''k''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is to emphasize that one "forgets" the vector space structure that ''k''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; carries.

A function ''f'' : '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; → '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; is said to be ''polynomial'' (or ''regular'') if it can be written as a polynomial, that is, if there is a polynomial ''p'' in ''k''[''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;] such that ''f''(''M'') = ''p''(''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) for every point ''M'' with coordinates (''t''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''t''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. The property of a function to be polynomial (or regular) does not depend on the choice of a coordinate system in '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

When a coordinate system is chosen, the regular functions on the affine ''n''-space may be identified with the ring of [[polynomial function]]s in ''n'' variables over ''k''. Therefore, the set of the regular functions on '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is a ring, which is denoted ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;].

We say that a polynomial ''vanishes'' at a point if evaluating it at that point gives zero. Let ''S'' be a set of polynomials in ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;]. The ''vanishing set of S'' (or ''vanishing locus'' or ''zero set'') is the set ''V''(''S'') of all points in '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; where every polynomial in ''S'' vanishes. Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;V(S) = \{(t_1,\dots,t_n)|\forall p\in S, p(t_1,\dots,t_n) = 0\}.\,&lt;/math&gt;

A subset of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; which is ''V''(''S''), for some ''S'', is called an ''algebraic set''. The ''V'' stands for ''variety'' (a specific type of algebraic set to be defined below).

Given a subset ''U'' of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, can one recover the set of polynomials which generate it? If ''U'' is ''any'' subset of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, define ''I''(''U'') to be the set of all polynomials whose vanishing set contains ''U''. The ''I'' stands for [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]]: if two polynomials ''f'' and ''g'' both vanish on ''U'', then ''f''+''g'' vanishes on ''U'', and if ''h'' is any polynomial, then ''hf'' vanishes on ''U'', so ''I''(''U'') is always an ideal of the polynomial ring ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;].

Two natural questions to ask are:
* Given a subset ''U'' of '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, when is ''U'' = ''V''(''I''(''U''))?
* Given a set ''S'' of polynomials, when is ''S'' = ''I''(''V''(''S''))?

The answer to the first question is provided by introducing the [[Zariski topology]], a topology on '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; whose closed sets are the algebraic sets, and which directly reflects the algebraic structure of ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;]. Then ''U'' = ''V''(''I''(''U'')) if and only if ''U'' is an algebraic set or equivalently a Zariski-closed set. The answer to the second question is given by [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]]. In one of its forms, it says that ''I''(''V''(''S'')) is the [[radical of an ideal|radical]] of the ideal generated by ''S''. In more abstract language, there is a [[Galois connection]], giving rise to two [[closure operator]]s; they can be identified, and naturally play a basic role in the theory; the [[Galois connection#Examples|example]] is elaborated at Galois connection.

For various reasons we may not always want to work with the entire ideal corresponding to an algebraic set ''U''. [[Hilbert's basis theorem]] implies that ideals in ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;] are always finitely generated.

An algebraic set is called ''[[irreducible component|irreducible]]'' if it cannot be written as the union of two smaller algebraic sets. Any algebraic set is a finite union of irreducible algebraic sets and this decomposition is unique. Thus its elements are called the ''irreducible components'' of the algebraic set. An irreducible algebraic set is also called a ''[[algebraic variety|variety]]''. It turns out that an algebraic set is a variety if and only if it may be defined as the vanishing set of a [[prime ideal]] of the polynomial ring.

Some authors do not make a clear distinction between algebraic sets and varieties and use ''irreducible variety'' to make the distinction when needed.

=== Regular functions ===
{{main|Regular function}}

Just as [[continuous function]]s are the natural maps on [[topological space]]s and [[smooth function]]s are the natural maps on [[differentiable manifold]]s, there is a natural class of functions on an algebraic set, called ''regular functions'' or ''polynomial functions''. A regular function on an algebraic set ''V'' contained in '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is the restriction to ''V'' of a regular function on '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. For an algebraic set defined on the field of the complex numbers, the regular functions are smooth and even [[analytic function|analytic]].

It may seem unnaturally restrictive to require that a regular function always extend to the ambient space, but it is very similar to the situation in a [[normal space|normal]] [[topological space]], where the [[Tietze extension theorem]] guarantees that a continuous function on a closed subset always extends to the ambient topological space.

Just as with the regular functions on affine space, the regular functions on ''V'' form a ring, which we denote by ''k''[''V'']. This ring is called the ''[[coordinate ring]] of V''.

Since regular functions on V come from regular functions on '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, there is a relationship between the coordinate rings. Specifically, if a regular function on ''V'' is the restriction of two functions ''f'' and ''g'' in ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;], then ''f''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''g'' is a polynomial function which is null on ''V'' and thus belongs to ''I''(''V''). Thus ''k''[''V''] may be identified with ''k''['''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;]/''I''(''V'').

=== Morphism of affine varieties ===
Using regular functions from an affine variety to '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;, we can define [[morphism of algebraic varieties|regular map]]s from one affine variety to another. First we will define a regular map from a variety into affine space: Let ''V'' be a variety contained in '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. Choose ''m'' regular functions on ''V'', and call them ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;. We define a ''regular map'' ''f'' from ''V'' to '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt; by letting {{nowrap|1=''f'' = (''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''m''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}. In other words, each ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; determines one coordinate of the [[image (mathematics)|range]] of ''f''.

If ''V''′ is a variety contained in '''A'''&lt;sup&gt;''m''&lt;/sup&gt;, we say that ''f'' is a ''regular map'' from ''V'' to ''V''′ if the range of ''f'' is contained in ''V''′.

The definition of the regular maps apply also to algebraic sets.
The regular maps are also called ''morphisms'', as they make the collection of all affine algebraic sets into a [[category theory|category]], where the objects are the affine algebraic sets and the [[morphism]]s are the regular maps. The affine varieties is a subcategory of the category of the algebraic sets.

Given a regular map ''g'' from ''V'' to ''V''′ and a regular function ''f'' of ''k''[''V''′], then {{nowrap|''f'' ∘ ''g'' ∈ ''k''[''V'']}}. The map {{nowrap|''f'' → ''f'' ∘ ''g''}} is a [[ring homomorphism]] from ''k''[''V''′] to ''k''[''V'']. Conversely, every ring homomorphism from ''k''[''V''′] to ''k''[''V''] defines a regular map from ''V'' to ''V''′. This defines an [[equivalence of categories]] between the category of algebraic sets and the [[dual (category theory)|opposite category]] of the finitely generated [[reduced ring|reduced]] ''k''-algebras. This equivalence is one of the starting points of [[scheme theory]].

=== Rational function and birational equivalence ===
{{main|Rational mapping}}
In contrast to the preceding sections, this section concerns only varieties and not algebraic sets. On the other hand, the definitions extend naturally to projective varieties (next section), as an affine variety and its projective completion have the same field of functions.

If ''V'' is an affine variety, its coordinate ring is an [[integral domain]] and has thus a [[field of fractions]] which is denoted ''k''(''V'') and called the ''field of the rational functions'' on ''V'' or, shortly, the ''[[function field of an algebraic variety|function field]]'' of ''V''. Its elements are the restrictions to ''V'' of the [[rational function]]s over the affine space containing ''V''. The [[domain of a function|domain]] of a rational function ''f'' is not ''V'' but the [[complement (set theory)|complement]] of the subvariety (a hypersurface) where the denominator of ''f'' vanishes.

As with regular maps, one may define a ''rational map'' from a variety ''V'' to a variety ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;. As with the regular maps, the rational maps from ''V'' to ''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; may be identified to the [[ring homomorphism|field homomorphism]]s from ''k''(''V''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;) to ''k''(''V'').

Two affine varieties are ''birationally equivalent'' if there are two rational functions between them which are [[function inverse|inverse]] one to the other in the regions where both are defined. Equivalently, they are birationally equivalent if their function fields are isomorphic.

An affine variety is a ''[[rational variety]]'' if it is birationally equivalent to an affine space. This means that the variety admits a rational parameterization. For example, the circle of equation &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2-1=0&lt;/math&gt; is a rational curve, as it has the parameterization
:&lt;math&gt;x=\frac{2\,t}{1+t^2}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y=\frac{1-t^2}{1+t^2}\,,&lt;/math&gt;
which may also be viewed as a rational map from the line to the circle.

The problem of [[resolution of singularities]] is to know if every algebraic variety is birationally equivalent to a variety whose projective completion is nonsingular (see also [[smooth completion]]). It was solved in the affirmative in characteristic 0 by [[Heisuke Hironaka]] in 1964 and is yet unsolved in finite characteristic.

=== Projective variety ===
{{Main|Algebraic geometry of projective spaces}}

[[File:Parabola &amp; cubic curve in projective space.png|thumb|Parabola ({{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, red) and cubic ({{nowrap|1=''y'' = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}, blue) in projective space]]
Just as the formulas for the roots of second, third, and fourth degree polynomials suggest extending real numbers to the more algebraically complete setting of the complex numbers, many properties of algebraic varieties suggest extending affine space to a more geometrically complete projective space. Whereas the complex numbers are obtained by adding the number ''i'', a root of the polynomial {{nowrap|''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + 1}}, projective space is obtained by adding in appropriate points "at infinity", points where parallel lines may meet.

To see how this might come about, consider the variety {{nowrap|''V''(''y'' &amp;minus; ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. If we draw it, we get a [[parabola]]. As ''x'' goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) also goes to positive infinity. As ''x'' goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to negative infinity.

Compare this to the variety ''V''(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;). This is a [[cubic curve]]. As ''x'' goes to positive infinity, the slope of the line from the origin to the point (''x'',&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) goes to positive infinity just as before. But unlike before, as ''x'' goes to negative infinity, the slope of the same line goes to positive infinity as well; the exact opposite of the parabola. So the behavior "at infinity" of ''V''(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) is different from the behavior "at infinity" of ''V''(''y''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

The consideration of the ''projective completion'' of the two curves, which is their prolongation "at infinity" in the [[projective plane]], allows us to quantify this difference: the point at infinity of the parabola is a [[regular point of an algebraic variety|regular point]], whose tangent is the [[line at infinity]], while the point at infinity of the cubic curve is a [[cusp (singularity)|cusp]]. Also, both curves are rational, as they are parameterized by ''x'', and the [[Riemann-Roch theorem for algebraic curves|Riemann-Roch theorem]] implies that the cubic curve must have a singularity, which must be at infinity, as all its points in the affine space are regular.

Thus many of the properties of algebraic varieties, including birational equivalence and all the topological properties, depend on the behavior "at infinity" and so it is natural to study the varieties in projective space. Furthermore, the introduction of projective techniques made many theorems in algebraic geometry simpler and sharper: For example, [[Bézout's theorem]] on the number of intersection points between two varieties can be stated in its sharpest form only in projective space. For these reasons, projective space plays a fundamental role in algebraic geometry.

Nowadays, the ''[[projective space]]'' '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; of dimension ''n'' is usually defined as the set of the lines passing through a point, considered as the origin, in the affine space of dimension {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}, or equivalently to the set of the vector lines in a vector space of dimension {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}. When a coordinate system has been chosen in the space of dimension {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}}, all the points of a line have the same set of coordinates, up to the multiplication by an element of ''k''. This defines the [[homogeneous coordinates]] of a point of '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as a sequence of {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} elements of the base field ''k'', defined up to the multiplication by a nonzero element of ''k'' (the same for the whole sequence).

A polynomial in {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} variables vanishes at all points of a line passing through the origin if and only if it is [[Homogeneous polynomial|homogeneous]]. In this case, one says that the polynomial ''vanishes'' at the corresponding point of '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;. This allows us to define a ''projective algebraic set'' in '''P'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; as the set {{nowrap|''V''(''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;)}}, where a finite set of homogeneous polynomials {{nowrap|{''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ..., ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;} }} vanishes. Like for affine algebraic sets, there is a bijection between the projective algebraic sets and the reduced [[homogeneous ideal]]s which define them. The ''projective varieties'' are the projective algebraic sets whose defining ideal is prime. In other words, a projective variety is a projective algebraic set, whose [[homogeneous coordinate ring]] is an [[integral domain]], the ''projective coordinates ring'' being defined as the quotient of the graded ring or the polynomials in {{nowrap|''n'' + 1}} variables by the homogeneous (reduced) ideal defining the variety. Every projective algebraic set may be uniquely decomposed into a finite union of projective varieties.

The only regular functions which may be defined properly on a projective variety are the constant functions. Thus this notion is not used in projective situations. On the other hand, the ''field of the rational functions'' or ''function field '' is a useful notion, which, similarly to the affine case, is defined as the set of the quotients of two homogeneous elements of the same degree in the homogeneous coordinate ring.

==Real algebraic geometry==
{{main|Real algebraic geometry}}

Real algebraic geometry is the study of the real points of algebraic geometry.

The fact that the field of the real numbers is an [[ordered field]] cannot be ignored in such a study. For example, the curve of equation &lt;math&gt;x^2+y^2-a=0&lt;/math&gt; is a circle if &lt;math&gt; a&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;, but does not have any real point if &lt;math&gt; a&lt;0&lt;/math&gt;. It follows that real algebraic geometry is not only the study of the real algebraic varieties, but has been generalized to the study of the ''semi-algebraic sets'', which are the solutions of systems of polynomial equations and polynomial inequalities. For example, a branch of the [[hyperbola]] of equation &lt;math&gt;x y-1 = 0&lt;/math&gt; is not an algebraic variety, but is a semi-algebraic set defined by &lt;math&gt;x y-1=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x&gt;0&lt;/math&gt; or by &lt;math&gt;x y-1=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;x+y&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;.

One of the challenging problems of real algebraic geometry is the unsolved [[Hilbert's sixteenth problem]]: Decide which respective positions are possible for the ovals of a nonsingular plane curve of degree 8.

== Computational algebraic geometry ==
One may date the origin of computational algebraic geometry to meeting EUROSAM'79 (International Symposium on Symbolic and Algebraic Manipulation) held at [[Marseille]], France in June 1979. At this meeting,
* Dennis S. Arnon showed that [[George E. Collins]]'s [[Cylindrical algebraic decomposition]] (CAD) allows the computation of the topology of semi-algebraic sets,
* [[Bruno Buchberger]] presented the [[Gröbner basis|Gröbner bases]] and his algorithm to compute them,
* [[Daniel Lazard]] presented a new algorithm for solving systems of homogeneous polynomial equations with a [[computational complexity]] which is essentially polynomial in the expected number of solutions and thus simply exponential in the number of the unknowns. This algorithm is strongly related with [[Francis Sowerby Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s [[Resultant|multivariate resultant]].

Since then, most results in this area are related to one or several of these items either by using or improving one of these algorithms, or by finding algorithms whose complexity is simply exponential in the number of the variables.

A body of mathematical theory complementary to symbolic methods called [[numerical algebraic geometry]] has been developed over the last several decades.  The main computational method is [[homotopy continuation]].  This supports, for example, a model of [[floating point]] computation for solving problems of algebraic geometry.

===Gröbner basis===

{{main|Gröbner basis}}

A [[Gröbner basis]] is a system of [[Ideal (ring theory)#Ideal generated by a set|generators]] of a polynomial [[ideal (ring theory)|ideal]] whose computation allows the deduction of many properties of the affine algebraic variety defined by the ideal.

Given an ideal ''I'' defining an algebraic set ''V'':
* ''V'' is empty (over an algebraically closed extension of the basis field), if and only if the Gröbner basis for any [[monomial order]]ing is reduced to {1}.
* By means of the [[Hilbert series]] one may compute the [[dimension of an algebraic variety|dimension]] and the [[degree of an algebraic variety|degree]] of ''V'' from any Gröbner basis of ''I'' for a monomial ordering refining the total degree.
* If the dimension of ''V'' is 0, one may compute the points (finite in number) of ''V'' from any Gröbner basis of ''I'' (see [[Systems of polynomial equations]]).
* A Gröbner basis computation allows one to remove from ''V'' all irreducible components which are contained in a given hyper-surface.
* A Gröbner basis computation allows one to compute the Zariski closure of the image of ''V'' by the projection on the ''k'' first coordinates, and the subset of the image where the projection is not proper.
* More generally Gröbner basis computations allow one to compute the Zariski closure of the image and the [[critical point (mathematics)|critical point]]s of a rational function of ''V'' into another affine variety.

Gröbner basis computations do not allow one to compute directly the primary decomposition of ''I'' nor the prime ideals defining the irreducible components of ''V'', but most algorithms for this involve Gröbner basis computation. The algorithms which are not based on Gröbner bases use [[regular chain]]s but may need Gröbner bases in some exceptional situations.

Gröbner bases are deemed to be difficult to compute. In fact they may contain, in the worst case, polynomials whose degree is doubly exponential in the number of variables and a number of polynomials which is also doubly exponential. However, this is only a worst case complexity, and the complexity bound of Lazard's algorithm of 1979 may frequently apply. [[Faugère F5 algorithm]] realizes this complexity, as it may be viewed as an improvement of Lazard's 1979 algorithm. It follows that the best implementations allow one to compute almost routinely with algebraic sets of degree more than 100. This means that, presently, the difficulty of computing a Gröbner basis is strongly related to the intrinsic difficulty of the problem.

===Cylindrical algebraic decomposition (CAD)===
CAD is an algorithm which was introduced in 1973 by G. Collins to implement with an acceptable complexity the [[Tarski–Seidenberg theorem]] on [[quantifier elimination]] over the real numbers.

This theorem concerns the formulas of the [[first-order logic]] whose [[atomic formula]]s are polynomial equalities or inequalities between polynomials with real coefficients. These formulas are thus the formulas which may be constructed from the atomic formulas by the logical operators ''and'' (∧), ''or'' (∨), ''not'' (¬), ''for all'' (∀) and ''exists'' (∃). Tarski's theorem asserts that, from such a formula, one may compute an equivalent formula without quantifier (∀, ∃).

The complexity of CAD is doubly exponential in the number of variables. This means that CAD allows, in theory, to solve every problem of real algebraic geometry which may be expressed by such a formula, that is almost every problem concerning explicitly given varieties and semi-algebraic sets.

While Gröbner basis computation has doubly exponential complexity only in rare cases, CAD has almost always this high complexity. This implies that, unless if most polynomials appearing in the input are linear, it may not solve problems with more than four variables.

Since 1973, most of the research on this subject is devoted either to improve CAD or to find alternative algorithms in special cases of general interest.

As an example of the state of art, there are efficient algorithms to find at least a point in every connected component of a semi-algebraic set, and thus to test if a semi-algebraic set is empty. On the other hand, CAD is yet, in practice, the best algorithm to count the number of connected components.

=== Asymptotic complexity vs. practical efficiency ===
The basic general algorithms of computational geometry have a double exponential worst case [[Computational complexity theory|complexity]]. More precisely, if ''d'' is the maximal degree of the input polynomials and ''n'' the number of variables, their complexity is at most &lt;math&gt;d^{2^{c n}}&lt;/math&gt; for some constant ''c'', and, for some inputs, the complexity is at least &lt;math&gt;d^{2^{c' n}}&lt;/math&gt; for another constant ''c''′.

During the last 20 years of 20th century, various algorithms have been introduced to solve specific subproblems with a better complexity. Most of these algorithms have a complexity &lt;math&gt;d^{O(n^2)}&lt;/math&gt;.{{Citation needed|reason=both the most claim and the order need substantiation|date=November 2018}}

Among these algorithms which solve a sub problem of the problems solved by Gröbner bases, one may cite ''testing if an affine variety is empty'' and ''solving nonhomogeneous polynomial systems which have a finite number of solutions.'' Such algorithms are rarely implemented because, on most entries [[Faugère's F4 and F5 algorithms]] have a better practical efficiency and probably a similar or better complexity (''probably'' because the evaluation of the complexity of Gröbner basis algorithms on a particular class of entries is a difficult task which has been done only in a few special cases).

The main algorithms of real algebraic geometry which solve a problem solved by CAD are related to the topology of semi-algebraic sets. One may cite ''counting the number of connected components'', ''testing if two points are in the same components'' or ''computing a [[Whitney stratification]] of a real algebraic set''. They have a complexity of
&lt;math&gt;d^{O(n^2)}&lt;/math&gt;, but the constant involved by ''O'' notation is so high that using them to solve any nontrivial problem effectively solved by CAD, is impossible even if one could use all the existing computing power in the world. Therefore, these algorithms have never been implemented and this is an active research area to search for algorithms with have together a good asymptotic complexity and a good practical efficiency.

== Abstract modern viewpoint ==
The modern approaches to algebraic geometry redefine and effectively extend the range of basic objects in various levels of generality to schemes, [[formal scheme]]s, [[ind-scheme]]s, [[algebraic space]]s, [[algebraic stack]]s and so on. The need for this arises already from the useful ideas within theory of varieties, e.g. the formal functions of Zariski can be accommodated by introducing nilpotent elements in structure rings; considering spaces of loops and arcs, constructing quotients by group actions and developing formal grounds for natural intersection theory and deformation theory lead to some of the further extensions.

Most remarkably, in late 1950s, algebraic varieties were subsumed into [[Alexander Grothendieck]]'s concept of a [[scheme (mathematics)|scheme]]. Their local objects are affine schemes or prime spectra which are locally ringed spaces which form a category which is antiequivalent to the category of commutative unital rings, extending the duality between the category of affine algebraic varieties over a field ''k'', and the category of finitely generated reduced ''k''-algebras. The gluing is along Zariski topology; one can glue within the category of locally ringed spaces, but also, using the Yoneda embedding, within the more abstract category of presheaves of sets over the category of affine schemes. The Zariski topology in the set theoretic sense is then replaced by a [[Grothendieck topology]]. Grothendieck introduced Grothendieck topologies having in mind more exotic but geometrically finer and more sensitive examples than the crude Zariski topology, namely the [[étale topology]], and the two flat Grothendieck topologies: fppf and fpqc; nowadays some other examples became prominent including [[Nisnevich topology]]. Sheaves can be furthermore generalized to stacks in the sense of Grothendieck, usually with some additional representability conditions leading to Artin stacks and, even finer, [[Deligne-Mumford stack]]s, both often called algebraic stacks.

Sometimes other algebraic sites replace the category of affine schemes. For example, [[Nikolai Durov]] has introduced commutative algebraic monads as a generalization of local objects in a generalized algebraic geometry. Versions of a [[tropical geometry]], of an [[absolute geometry]] over a field of one element and an algebraic analogue of [[Arakelov's geometry]] were realized in this setup.

Another formal generalization is possible to [[universal algebraic geometry]] in which every [[Variety (universal algebra)|variety of algebras]] has its own algebraic geometry. The term ''variety of algebras'' should not be confused with ''algebraic variety''.

The language of schemes, stacks and generalizations has proved to be a valuable way of dealing with geometric concepts and became cornerstones of modern algebraic geometry.

Algebraic stacks can be further generalized and for many practical questions like deformation theory and intersection theory, this is often the most natural approach. One can extend the [[Grothendieck site]] of affine schemes to a [[higher category theory|higher categorical]] site of [[derived affine scheme]]s, by replacing the commutative rings with an infinity category of [[differential graded commutative algebra]]s, or of simplicial commutative rings or a similar category with an appropriate variant of a Grothendieck topology. One can also replace presheaves of sets by presheaves of simplicial sets (or of infinity groupoids). Then, in presence of an appropriate homotopic machinery one can develop a notion of derived stack as such a presheaf on the infinity category of derived affine schemes, which is satisfying certain infinite categorical version of a sheaf axiom (and to be algebraic, inductively a sequence of representability conditions). [[Quillen model category|Quillen model categories]], Segal categories and [[quasicategory|quasicategories]] are some of the most often used tools to formalize this yielding the ''[[derived algebraic geometry]]'', introduced by the school of [[Carlos Simpson]], including Andre Hirschowitz, [[Bertrand Toën]], Gabrielle Vezzosi, Michel Vaquié and others; and developed further by [[Jacob Lurie]], [[Bertrand Toën]], and [[Gabrielle Vezzosi]]. Another (noncommutative) version of derived algebraic geometry, using A-infinity categories has been developed from early 1990s by [[Maxim Kontsevich]] and followers.

== History ==

===Before the 16th century===
Some of the roots of algebraic geometry date back to the work of the [[Hellenistic Greece|Hellenistic Greeks]] from the 5th century BC. The [[Delian problem]], for instance, was to construct a length ''x'' so that the cube of side ''x'' contained the same volume as the rectangular box ''a''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''b'' for given sides ''a'' and ''b''. [[Menaechmus]] (circa 350 BC) considered the problem geometrically by intersecting the pair of plane conics ''ay''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and ''xy''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''ab''.&lt;ref name="Dieudonné"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Dieudonné |first=Jean |authorlink=Jean Dieudonné |title=The historical development of algebraic geometry |journal=The American Mathematical Monthly |volume=79 |issue=8 |year=1972 |pages=827–866 |doi=10.2307/2317664 |jstor=2317664 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The later work, in the 3rd century BC, of [[Archimedes]] and [[Apollonius of Perga|Apollonius]] studied more systematically problems on [[conic sections]],&lt;ref&gt;Kline, M. (1972) ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (Volume 1). Oxford University Press. pp. 108, 90.&lt;/ref&gt; and also involved the use of coordinates.&lt;ref name="Dieudonné"/&gt; The [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|Arab mathematicians]] were able to solve by purely algebraic means certain cubic equations, and then to interpret the results geometrically. This was done, for instance, by [[Ibn al-Haytham]] in the 10th century AD.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, M. (1972) ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (Volume 1). Oxford University Press. p. 193.&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, [[Persian people|Persian]] mathematician [[Omar Khayyám]] (born 1048 A.D.) discovered a method for solving [[cubic equation]]s by intersecting a parabola with a circle&lt;ref&gt;Kline, M. (1972) ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (Volume 1). Oxford University Press. pp. 193&amp;ndash;195.&lt;/ref&gt; and seems to have been the first to conceive a general theory of cubic equations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Khayyam.html/ St Andrews] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171112123436/http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Khayyam.html# |date=2017-11-12 }} "Khayyam himself seems to have been the first to conceive a general theory of cubic equations."&lt;/ref&gt;
A few years after Omar Khayyám, [[Sharaf al-Din al-Tusi]]'s "Treatise on equations" has been described as inaugurating the beginning of algebraic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Rashed ([[#CITEREFRashed1994|1994]], pp.[https://archive.org/stream/RoshdiRashedauth.TheDevelopmentOfArabicMathematicsBetweenArithmeticAndAlgebraSpringerNetherlands1994/Roshdi%20Rashed%20%28auth.%29-The%20Development%20of%20Arabic%20Mathematics_%20Between%20Arithmetic%20and%20Algebra-Springer%20Netherlands%20%281994%29#page/n111/mode/1up 102-3])&lt;/ref&gt;

===Renaissance===

Such techniques of applying geometrical constructions to algebraic problems were also adopted by a number of [[Renaissance]] mathematicians such as [[Gerolamo Cardano]] and [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Niccolò Fontana "Tartaglia"]] on their studies of the cubic equation. The geometrical approach to construction problems, rather than the algebraic one, was favored by most 16th and 17th century mathematicians, notably [[Blaise Pascal]] who argued against the use of algebraic and analytical methods in geometry.&lt;ref&gt;Kline, M. (1972) ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'' (Volume 1). Oxford University Press. p. 279.&lt;/ref&gt; The French mathematicians [[Franciscus Vieta]] and later [[René Descartes]] and [[Pierre de Fermat]] revolutionized the conventional way of thinking about construction problems through the introduction of [[coordinate geometry]]. They were interested primarily in the properties of ''algebraic curves'', such as those defined by [[Diophantine equations]] (in the case of Fermat), and the algebraic reformulation of the classical Greek works on conics and cubics (in the case of Descartes).

During the same period, Blaise Pascal and [[Gérard Desargues]] approached geometry from a different perspective, developing the [[synthetic geometry|synthetic]] notions of [[projective geometry]]. Pascal and Desargues also studied curves, but from the purely geometrical point of view: the analog of the Greek ''ruler and compass construction''. Ultimately, the [[analytic geometry]] of Descartes and Fermat won out, for it supplied the 18th century mathematicians with concrete quantitative tools needed to study physical problems using the new calculus of [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]]. However, by the end of the 18th century, most of the algebraic character of coordinate geometry was subsumed by the ''calculus of infinitesimals'' of [[Joseph Louis Lagrange|Lagrange]] and [[Leonhard Euler|Euler]].

===19th and early 20th century===
It took the simultaneous 19th century developments of [[non-Euclidean geometry]] and [[Abelian integral]]s in order to bring the old algebraic ideas back into the geometrical fold. The first of these new developments was seized up by [[Edmond Laguerre]] and [[Arthur Cayley]], who attempted to ascertain the generalized metric properties of projective space. Cayley introduced the idea of ''homogeneous polynomial forms'', and more specifically [[quadratic form]]s, on projective space. Subsequently, [[Felix Klein]] studied projective geometry (along with other types of geometry) from the viewpoint that the geometry on a space is encoded in a certain class of [[transformation group|transformations]] on the space. By the end of the 19th century, projective geometers were studying more general kinds of transformations on figures in projective space. Rather than the projective linear transformations which were normally regarded as giving the fundamental [[Kleinian geometry]] on projective space, they concerned themselves also with the higher degree [[birational transformation]]s. This weaker notion of congruence would later lead members of the 20th century [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]] to classify [[algebraic surface]]s up to [[birational isomorphism]].

The second early 19th century development, that of Abelian integrals, would lead [[Bernhard Riemann]] to the development of [[Riemann surface]]s.

In the same period began the algebraization of the algebraic geometry through [[commutative algebra]]. The prominent results in this direction are [[Hilbert's basis theorem]] and [[Hilbert's Nullstellensatz]], which are the basis of the connexion between algebraic geometry and commutative algebra, and [[Francis Sowerby Macaulay|Macaulay]]'s [[multivariate resultant]], which is the basis of [[elimination theory]]. Probably because of the size of the computation which is implied by multivariate resultants, elimination theory was forgotten during the middle of the 20th century until it was renewed by [[singularity theory]] and computational algebraic geometry.&lt;ref&gt;
A witness of this oblivion is the fact that [[Van der Waerden]] removed the chapter on elimination theory from the third edition (and all the subsequent ones) of his treatise ''Moderne algebra'' (in German).&lt;/ref&gt;

===20th century===
[[B. L. van der Waerden]], [[Oscar Zariski]] and [[André Weil]] developed a foundation for algebraic geometry based on contemporary [[commutative algebra]], including [[valuation theory]] and the theory of [[ideal (ring theory)|ideals]]. One of the goals was to give a rigorous framework for proving the results of [[Italian school of algebraic geometry]]. In particular, this school used systematically the notion of [[generic point]] without any precise definition, which was first given by these authors during the 1930s.

In the 1950s and 1960s, [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] and [[Alexander Grothendieck]] recast the foundations making use of [[sheaf theory]]. Later, from about 1960, and largely led by Grothendieck, the idea of [[scheme (mathematics)|schemes]] was worked out, in conjunction with a very refined apparatus of [[homological algebra|homological techniques]]. After a decade of rapid development the field stabilized in the 1970s, and new applications were made, both to [[number theory]] and to more classical geometric questions on algebraic varieties, [[singularity theory|singularities]] and [[moduli space|moduli]].

An important class of varieties, not easily understood directly from their defining equations, are the [[abelian variety|abelian varieties]], which are the projective varieties whose points form an abelian [[group (mathematics)|group]]. The prototypical examples are the [[elliptic curve]]s, which have a rich theory. They were instrumental in the proof of [[Fermat's last theorem]] and are also used in [[elliptic-curve cryptography]].

In parallel with the abstract trend of the algebraic geometry, which is concerned with general statements about varieties, methods for effective computation with concretely-given varieties have also been developed, which lead to the new area of computational algebraic geometry. One of the founding methods of this area is the theory of [[Gröbner basis|Gröbner bases]], introduced by [[Bruno Buchberger]] in 1965. Another founding method, more specially devoted to real algebraic geometry, is the [[cylindrical algebraic decomposition]], introduced by [[George E. Collins]] in 1973.

See also: [[derived algebraic geometry]].&lt;!-- related to this, we really should mention more recent stuff like moduli of curves, connection to theoretical physics, etc.--&gt;

==Analytic geometry==
An '''[[analytic variety]]''' is defined locally as the set of common solutions of several equations involving [[analytic function]]s. It is analogous to the included concept of real or complex [[algebraic variety]]. Any [[complex manifold]] is an analytic variety. Since analytic varieties may have [[Mathematical singularity|singular points]], not all analytic varieties are manifolds.

Modern analytic geometry is essentially equivalent to real and complex algebraic geometry, as has been shown by [[Jean-Pierre Serre]] in his paper ''[[GAGA]]'', the name of which is French for ''Algebraic geometry and analytic geometry''. Nevertheless, the two fields remain distinct, as the methods of proof are quite different and algebraic geometry includes also geometry in finite [[Characteristic (algebra)|characteristic]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="24755">In [[mathematics]], the term "'''almost all'''" means "all but a negligible amount". More precisely, if &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; is a [[set (mathematics)|set]], "almost all elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;" means "all elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; but those in a [[negligible set|negligible]] [[subset]] of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;". The meaning of "negligible" depends on the mathematical context; for instance, it can mean [[finite set|finite]], [[countable set|countable]], or [[null set|null]].

In contrast, "'''almost no'''" means "a negligible amount"; that is, "almost no elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;" means "the elements of some negligible subset of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;".

==Meanings in areas of mathematics==
===Prevalent meaning===
{{further|Cofinite set}}
Throughout mathematics, "almost all" is sometimes used to mean "all (elements of an [[infinite set]]) but [[finite set|finite]]ly many".{{r|Cahen1|Cahen2|Halmos}} This use occurs in philosophy as well.{{r|Gardenfors}} Similarly, "almost all" can mean "all (elements of an [[uncountable set]]) but [[countable set|countably]] many".{{r|Schwartzman|group=sec}}

Examples:
* Almost all positive integers are greater than 1,000,000,000,000.{{r|Courant|page=293}}
* Almost all [[prime number]]s are odd, as 2 is the only exception.
* Almost all [[polyhedra]] are [[regular polyhedron#The regular polyhedra|irregular]], as there are only nine exceptions: the five [[platonic solid]]s and the four [[Kepler-Poinsot polyhedra]].
* If &lt;var&gt;P&lt;/var&gt; is a [[zero polynomial|nonzero]] polynomial, &lt;var&gt;P(x)&lt;/var&gt;&amp;ne;0 for almost all &lt;var&gt;x&lt;/var&gt;.

===Meaning in measure theory===
{{further|Almost everywhere}}
[[File:CantorEscalier.svg|thumb|right|250px| The Cantor function]]

When speaking about the [[real number|reals]], sometimes "almost all" means "all reals but a [[null set]]".{{r|Korevaar|Natanson}}{{r|Clapham|group=sec}} Similarly, if &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; is some set of reals, "almost all numbers in &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;" can mean "all numbers in &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; but those in a null set".{{r|Sohrab}} The [[real line]] can be thought of as a one-dimensional [[Euclidean space]]. In the more general case of an &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;-dimensional space (where &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; is a positive integer), these definitions can be [[generalised]] to "all points but those in a null set"{{r|James|group=sec}} or "all points in &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; but those in a null set" (this time, &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; is a set of points in the space).{{r|Helmberg}} Even more generally, "almost all" is sometimes used in the sense of "[[almost everywhere]]" in [[measure theory]],{{r|Vestrup|Billingsley}}{{r|Bityutskov|group=sec}} or in the closely related sense of "[[almost surely]]" in [[probability theory]].{{r|Billingsley}}{{r|Ito2|group=sec}}

Examples:
* In a [[measure space]], such as the real line, countable sets are null. The set of [[rational number]]s is countable, and thus almost all real numbers are irrational.{{r|Niven}}
* As [[Georg Cantor]] proved in [[Georg Cantor's first set theory article|his first set theory article]], the set of [[algebraic number]]s is countable as well, so almost all reals are [[transcendental number|transcendental]].{{r|Baker}}
* Almost all reals are [[normal number|normal]].{{r|Granville}}
* The [[Cantor set]] is null as well. Thus, almost all reals are not members of it even though it is uncountable.{{r|Korevaar}}
* The derivative of the [[Cantor function]] is 0 for almost all numbers in the [[unit interval]].{{r|Burk}} It follows from the previous example because the Cantor function is [[locally constant function|locally constant]]&amp;mdash;and thus with derivative 0&amp;mdash;outside the Cantor set.

===Meaning in number theory===
{{further|Asymptotically almost surely}}
In [[number theory]], "almost all positive integers" can mean "the positive integers in a set whose [[natural density]] is 1". That is, if &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; is a set of positive integers, and if the proportion of positive integers below &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; that are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; (out of all positive integers below &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) [[limit of a sequence|tends to]] 1 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to infinity, then almost all positive integers are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;.{{r|Hardy1|Hardy2}}{{r|Weisstein|group=sec}} More generally, let &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; be an infinite set of positive integers, such as the set of even positive numbers or of [[prime number|primes]]. If &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; is a subset of &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt;, and if the proportion of elements of &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; below &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; that are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; (out of all elements of &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; below &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;) tends to 1 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to infinity, then it can be said that almost all elements of &lt;var&gt;S&lt;/var&gt; are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;.

Examples:
* The natural density of [[cofinite set]]s of positive integers is 1, so each of them contains almost all positive integers.
* Almost all positive integers are [[composite number|composite]].{{r|Weisstein|group=sec}}{{refn |group=proof |According to the [[prime number theorem]], the number of primes less than or equal to &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; is asymptotically equal to &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;/ln(&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;). Therefore, the proportion of primes is roughly ln(&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;)/&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;, which tends to 0 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to [[infinity]], so the proportion of composite numbers less than or equal to &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to 1 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to [[infinity]].{{r|Hardy2}}}}
* Almost all even positive numbers can be expressed as the sum of two primes.{{r|Courant|page=489}}
* Almost all primes are [[twin prime#Isolated prime|isolated]]. Moreover, for every positive integer &lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt;, almost all primes have [[prime gap]]s of more than &lt;var&gt;g&lt;/var&gt; both to their left and to their right (no other primes between &lt;var&gt;p+g&lt;/var&gt; and &lt;var&gt;p-g)&lt;/var&gt;.{{r|Prachar}}

===Meaning in graph theory===
In [[graph theory]], if &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; is a set of (finite [[graph labeling|labelled]]) [[graph (discrete mathematics)|graph]]s, it can be said to contain almost all graphs if the proportion of graphs with &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; vertices that are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; tends to 1 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to infinity.{{r|Babai}} However, it is sometimes easier to work with probabilities,{{r|Spencer}} so the definition is reformulated as follows. The proportion of graphs with &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; vertices that are in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; equals the probability that a random graph with &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; vertices (chosen with the [[discrete uniform distribution|uniform distribution]]) is in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt;, and choosing a graph in this way has the same outcome as generating a graph by flipping a coin for each pair of vertices to decide whether to connect them.{{r|Bollobas}} Therefore, equivalently to the preceding definition, &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; contains almost all graphs if the probability that a coin flip-generated graph with &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; vertices is in &lt;var&gt;A&lt;/var&gt; tends to 1 as &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; tends to infinity.{{r|Spencer|Gradel}} Sometimes the latter definition is modified so that the graph is chosen randomly in some [[random graph#Models|other way]], where not all graphs with &lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt; vertices have the same probability,{{r|Bollobas}} and those modified definitions are not always equivalent to the main one.

The use of the term "almost all" in graph theory is not standard; the term "[[asymptotically almost surely]]" is more commonly used for this concept.{{r|Spencer}}

Example:
* Almost all graphs are [[asymmetric graph|asymmetric]].{{r|Babai}}
* Almost all graphs have [[diameter (graph theory)|diameter]] 2.{{r|Buckley}}

===Meaning in topology===
In [[topology]]{{r|Oxtoby}} and especially [[dynamical systems theory]]{{r|Baratchart|Broer|Sharkovsky}} (including applications in economics),{{r|Yuan}} "almost all" of a [[topological space]]'s points can mean "all of the space's points but those in a [[meagre set]]". Some use a more limited definition, where a subset only contains almost all of the space's points if it contains some [[open set|open]] [[dense set]].{{r|Broer|Albertini|Fuente}}

Example:
* Given an [[hyperconnected space|irreducible]] [[algebraic variety]], the [[property (mathematics)|properties]] that hold for almost all points in the variety are exactly the [[generic property|generic properties]].{{r|Ito1|group=sec}} It is because in an irreducible algebraic variety equipped with the [[Zariski topology]], all nonempty open sets are dense.

===Meaning in algebra===
In [[abstract algebra]] and [[mathematical logic]], if &lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt; is an [[ultrafilter#Special case: ultrafilter on the powerset of a set|ultrafilter]] on a set &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;, "almost all elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;" sometimes means "the elements of some ''element'' of &lt;var&gt;U&lt;/var&gt;".{{r|Komjath|Salzmann|Schoutens|Rautenberg}} For any [[partition of a set|partition]] of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; into two [[disjoint sets|disjoint]] sets, one of them necessarily contains almost all elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt;. It is possible to think of the elements of a [[filter (mathematics)#Filter on a set|filter]] on &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; as containing almost all elements of &lt;var&gt;X&lt;/var&gt; even if it isn't an ultrafilter.{{r|Rautenberg}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13874">Throughout history, [[angle]]s have been [[measure (mathematics)|measured]] in many different [[unit (measurement)|units]]. The most contemporary units are the [[degree (angle)|degree]] ( ° ) and [[radian]]  (rad), but many others have been used throughout [[History of Mathematics|history]]. The purpose of this page is to aggregate other concepts pertaining to the '''angular unit''', where additional explanation can be provided.

==Angle measurement in general==
The size of a geometric angle is usually characterized by the magnitude of the smallest rotation that maps one of the rays into the other. Angles that have the same size are said to be ''equal'' or ''congruent'' or ''equal in measure''.

In some contexts, such as identifying a point on a circle or describing the ''orientation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by an exact multiple of a full [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] are effectively equivalent.  In other contexts, such as identifying a point on a [[spiral]] curve or describing the ''cumulative rotation'' of an object in two dimensions relative to a reference orientation, angles that differ by a non-zero multiple of a full turn are not equivalent.

In order to measure an angle &lt;var&gt;[[theta|θ]]&lt;/var&gt;, a [[circular arc]] centered at the vertex of the angle is drawn, e.g. with a pair of [[Compasses (drafting)|compasses]]. The ratio of the length &lt;var&gt;s&lt;/var&gt; of the arc by the radius &lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt; of the circle is the measure of the angle in [[radian]]s.

The measure of the angle in another angular unit is then obtained by multiplying its measure in radians by the scaling factor {{sfrac|''k''|2{{pi}}}}, where ''k'' is the measure of a complete turn in the chosen unit (for example 360 for [[degree (angle)|degrees]] or 400 for [[gradian]]s):

:&lt;math&gt; \theta = k \frac{s}{2\pi r}. &lt;/math&gt;

The value of &lt;var&gt;θ&lt;/var&gt; thus defined is independent of the size of the circle: if the length of the radius is changed then the arc length changes in the same proportion, so the ratio ''s''/''r'' is unaltered. (Proof. The formula above can be rewritten as {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''θr''|''s''}}.}} One turn, for which {{nowrap|1 = ''θ'' = ''n''}} units, corresponds to an arc equal in length to the circle's [[circumference]], which is 2{{math|π}}''r'', so {{nowrap|1 = ''s'' = 2{{math|π}}''r''}}. Substituting ''n'' for ''θ'' and 2{{math|π}}''r'' for ''s'' in the formula, results in {{nowrap|1 = ''k'' = {{sfrac|''nr''|2{{math|π}}''r''}} = {{sfrac|''n''|2{{math|π}}}}.}}) {{refn|group=Note|This approach requires however an additional proof that the measure of the angle does not change with changing radius &lt;var&gt;r&lt;/var&gt;, in addition to the issue of "measurement units chosen." A smoother approach is to measure the angle by the length of the corresponding unit circle arc. Here "unit" can be chosen to be dimensionless in the sense that it is the real number 1 associated with the unit segment on the real line. See R. Dimitric for instance.&lt;ref&gt;R. Dimitric: [http://elib.mi.sanu.ac.rs/files/journals/tm/29/tm1525.pdf On angles and angle measurements]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Angle addition postulate===

The angle addition postulate states that if B is in the interior of angle AOC, then

&lt;math&gt; m\angle AOC = m\angle AOB + m\angle BOC &lt;/math&gt;

The measure of the angle AOC is the sum of the measure of angle AOB and the measure of angle BOC.
In this postulate it does not matter in which [[Units of measurement|unit]] the angle is measured as long as each angle is measured in the same unit.

[[Image:Angle radian.svg|right|thumb|150 px|Definition of 1 radian]]

One ''[[radian]]'' is the angle subtended by an arc of a circle that has the same length as the circle's radius. The radian is the derived quantity of angular measurement in the [[SI]] system. By definition, it is [[dimensionless]], though it may be specified as ''rad'' to avoid ambiguity. Angles measured in [[degree symbol|degree]]s, are shown with the symbol °. Subdivisions of the degree are [[Minute and second of arc|minute]] (symbol ', 1' = 1/60°) and [[Minute and second of arc|second]] {symbol ", 1" = 1/3600°}. An angle of 360° corresponds to the angle subtended by a full circle, and is equal to 2π radians, or 400 gradians.

Other units used to represent angles are listed in the following table. These units are defined such that the number of [[Turn (geometry)|turn]]s is equivalent to a full circle.

!name !!turns!!rotation angle !!description
|-
|[[turn (geometry)|Turn]]||1||360° || The ''turn'', also ''cycle'', ''full circle'', ''revolution'', and ''rotation'', is complete circular movement or measure (as to return to the same point) with circle or ellipse.  A turn is abbreviated {{mvar|&amp;tau;}}, ''cyc'', ''rev'', or ''rot'' depending on the application.. The symbol {{mvar|&amp;tau;}} can also be used as a [[mathematical constant]] to represent 2{{pi}} radians.

|[[circular sector|Quadrant]]||4||90°||One ''quadrant'' is also known as a ''[[right angle]]''. The quadrant is the unit used in [[Euclid's Elements]]. In German the symbol &lt;sup&gt;∟&lt;/sup&gt; has been used to denote a quadrant.

=== Other descriptors ===
* [[Tau]], sometimes used to represent two radians (τ = 2π = 2×3.14 = 6.283).

* Chi, an old Chinese angle measurement.{{citation needed|date=December 2017}}

* Diameter part (''n''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;376.99...): The ''diameter part'' (occasionally used in Islamic mathematics) is {{sfrac|60}} radian. One "diameter part" is approximately 0.95493°. There are about 376.991 diameter parts per turn.

* [[Milliradian]] and derived definitions: The true milliradian is defined a thousandth of a radian, which means that a rotation of one [[Turn (geometry)|turn]] would equal exactly 2000π mil (or approximately 6283.185 mil), and almost all [[Telescopic sight|scope sights]] for [[firearm]]s are calibrated to this definition. In addition there are three other derived definitions used for artillery and navigation which are ''approximately'' equal to a milliradian. Under these three other definitions one turn makes up for exactly 6000, 6300 or 6400 mils, which equals spanning the range from 0.05625 to 0.06 degrees (3.375 to 3.6 minutes). In comparison, the true milliradian is approximately 0.05729578 degrees (3.43775 minutes). One "[[NATO]] mil" is defined as {{sfrac|6400}} of a circle. Just like with the true milliradian, each of the other definitions exploits the mil's handby property of subtensions, i.e. that the value of one milliradian approximately equals the angle subtended by a width of 1 meter as seen from 1&amp;nbsp;km away ({{sfrac|2{{pi}}|6400}} = 0.0009817… ≈ {{sfrac|1000}}).

==Positive and negative angles==
Although the definition of the measurement of an angle does not support the concept of a negative angle, it is frequently useful to impose a convention that allows positive and negative angular values to represent orientations and/or rotations in opposite directions relative to some reference.

In a two-dimensional [[Cartesian coordinate system]], an angle is typically defined by its two sides, with its vertex at the origin. The ''initial side'' is on the positive [[x-axis]], while the other side or ''terminal side'' is defined by the measure from the initial side in radians, degrees, or turns. With ''positive angles'' representing rotations toward the positive [[y-axis]] and ''negative angles'' representing rotations toward the negative y-axis.  When Cartesian coordinates are represented by ''standard position'', defined by the x-axis rightward and the y-axis upward, positive rotations are [[anticlockwise]] and negative rotations are [[clockwise]].

In many contexts, an angle of −''θ'' is effectively equivalent to an angle of "one full turn minus ''θ''". For example, an orientation represented as &amp;nbsp;−45° is effectively equivalent to an orientation represented as 360°&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;45° or 315°.  However, a rotation of &amp;nbsp;−45° would not be the same as a rotation of 315°.

In three-dimensional geometry, "clockwise" and "anticlockwise" have no absolute meaning, so the direction of positive and negative angles must be defined relative to some reference, which is typically a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] passing through the angle's vertex and perpendicular to the plane in which the rays of the angle lie.

In [[navigation]], [[bearing (navigation)|bearings]] are measured relative to north.  By convention, viewed from above, bearing angle are positive clockwise, so a bearing of 45° corresponds to a north-east orientation. Negative bearings are not used in navigation, so a north-west orientation corresponds to a bearing of 315°.

==Alternative ways of measuring the size of an angle==
There are several alternatives to measuring the size of an angle by the corresponding angle of rotation.
The ''[[grade (slope)|grade of a slope]]'', or ''gradient'' is equal to the [[tangent (trigonometric function)|tangent]] of the angle, or sometimes (rarely) the [[sine]]. Gradients are often expressed as a percentage. For very small values (less than 5%), the grade of a slope is approximately the measure of an angle in radians.

In [[rational geometry]] the ''spread'' between two lines is defined at the square of sine of the angle between the lines. Since the sine of an angle and the sine of its supplementary angle are the same any angle of rotation that maps one of the lines into the other leads to the same value of the spread between the lines.

===Astronomical approximations===
Astronomers measure angular separation of objects in degrees from their point of observation.
* 0.5° is approximately the width of the sun or moon.
* 1° is approximately the width of a little finger at arm's length.
* 10° is approximately the width of a closed fist at arm's length.
* 20° is approximately the width of a handspan at arm's length.

These measurements clearly depend on the individual subject, and the above should be treated as rough [[rule of thumb]] approximations only.

==Measurements that are not angular units==

Not all angle measurements are angular units, for an angular measurement it is definitional that the [[angle addition postulate]] holds.

Some angle measurements where the [[angle addition postulate]] does not holds.

* [[Trigonometric functions]]
* [[slope]]

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11775">In [[mathematics]], an '''autonomous system''' or '''autonomous differential equation''' is a [[simultaneous equations|system]] of [[ordinary differential equation]]s which does not explicitly depend on the [[independent variable]]. When the variable is time, they are also called [[time-invariant system]]s.

Many laws in [[physics]], where the independent variable is usually assumed to be [[time]], are expressed as autonomous systems because it is assumed the [[Physical law|laws of nature]] which hold now are identical to those for any point in the past or future.

Autonomous systems are closely related to [[dynamical system]]s. Any autonomous system can be transformed into a dynamical system{{Citation needed|reason=Aren't they already dynamical systems?|date=February 2018}} and, using very weak assumptions{{Citation needed|reason=What assumptions?|date=February 2018}}, a dynamical system can be transformed into an autonomous system{{Citation needed|reason=How?|date=February 2018}}.

== Definition ==

An '''autonomous system''' is a [[system of ordinary differential equation]]s of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}x(t)=f(x(t))&lt;/math&gt;
where ''x'' takes values in ''n''-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] and ''t'' is usually time.

It is distinguished from systems of differential equations of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}x(t)=g(x(t),t)&lt;/math&gt;
in which the law governing the rate of motion of a particle depends not only on the particle's location, but also on time; such systems are not autonomous.

== Properties ==
Let &lt;math&gt;x_1(t)&lt;/math&gt; be a unique solution of the 
[[initial value problem]] for an autonomous system 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}x(t)=f(x(t)) \, \mathrm{,} \quad x(0)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;.
Then &lt;math&gt;x_2(t)=x_1(t-t_0)&lt;/math&gt; solves
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}x(t)=f(x(t)) \, \mathrm{,} \quad x(t_0)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;.
Indeed, denoting &lt;math&gt;s=t-t_0&lt;/math&gt; we have &lt;math&gt;x_1(s)=x_2(t)&lt;/math&gt; 
and &lt;math&gt;ds=dt&lt;/math&gt;, thus 
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}x_2(t)=\frac{d}{dt}x_1(t-t_0)=\frac{d}{ds}x_1(s)=
f(x_1(s))=f(x_2(t))&lt;/math&gt;.
For the initial condition, the verification is trivial,
:&lt;math&gt;x_2(t_0)=x_1(t_0-t_0)=x_1(0)=x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
The equation &lt;math&gt;y'=(2-y)y&lt;/math&gt; is autonomous, since the independent variable, 
let us call it &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;, does not explicitly appear in the equation. 
To plot the [[slope field]] and [[isocline]] for this equation, one can use the following 
code in [[GNU Octave]]/[[MATLAB]]
&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
Ffun = @(X,Y)(2-Y).*Y;           % function f(x,y)=(2-y)y
[X,Y]=meshgrid(0:.2:6,-1:.2:3);  % choose the plot sizes
DY=Ffun(X,Y); DX=ones(size(DY)); % generate the plot values 
quiver(X,Y,DX,DY, 'k');          % plot the direction field in black
hold on;
contour(X,Y,DY,[0 1 2], 'g');    % add the isoclines(0 1 2) in green
title('Slope field and isoclines for f(x,y)=(2-y)y')
&lt;/source&gt;
One can observe from the plot that the function &lt;math&gt;(2-y)y&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;-invariant, and so is the shape of the solution, i.e. &lt;math&gt;y(x)=y(x-x_0)&lt;/math&gt; for any shift &lt;math&gt;x_0&lt;/math&gt;.

Solving the equation symbolically in [[MATLAB]], by running 
&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
y=dsolve('Dy=(2-y)*y','x'); % solve the equation symbolically 
&lt;/source&gt;
we obtain two [[Equilibrium point|equilibrium]] solutions, &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;y=2&lt;/math&gt;, 
and a third solution involving an unknown constant &lt;math&gt;C_3&lt;/math&gt;,
&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
y(3)=-2/(exp(C3 - 2*x) - 1)
&lt;/source&gt;
Picking up some specific values for the [[initial condition]], we can add the plot of several solutions
&lt;source lang="matlab"&gt;
y1=dsolve('Dy=(2-y)*y','y(1)=1','x'); % solve the initial value problem symbolically 
y2=dsolve('Dy=(2-y)*y','y(2)=1','x'); % for different initial conditions 
y3=dsolve('Dy=(2-y)*y','y(3)=1','x'); y4=dsolve('Dy=(2-y)*y','y(1)=3','x'); 
y5=dsolve('Dy=(2-y)*y','y(2)=3','x'); y6=dsolve('Dy=(2-y)*y','y(3)=3','x');
ezplot(y1, [0 6]); ezplot(y2, [0 6]); % plot the solutions
ezplot(y3, [0 6]); ezplot(y4, [0 6]); ezplot(y5, [0 6]); ezplot(y6, [0 6]);

== Qualitative analysis ==
Autonomous systems can be analyzed qualitatively using the [[phase space]]; in the one-variable case, this is the [[phase line (mathematics)|phase line]].

== Solution techniques ==

The following techniques apply to one-dimensional autonomous differential equations. Any one-dimensional equation of order &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to an &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional first-order system (as described in [[Ordinary differential equation#Reduction to a first order system]]), but not necessarily vice versa.

=== First order ===
The first-order autonomous equation
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;
is [[Examples of differential equations#Separable first order linear ordinary differential equations|separable]], so it can easily be solved by rearranging it into the integral form
:&lt;math&gt;t + C = \int \frac{dx}{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

=== Second order ===

The second-order autonomous equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = f(x, x')&lt;/math&gt;

is more difficult, but it can be solved&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Boyce |first=William E. |author2=Richard C. DiPrima |title=Elementary Differential Equations and Boundary Volume Problems |edition=8th |year=2005 |publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons |isbn=0-471-43338-1 |pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; by introducing the new variable

:&lt;math&gt;v = \frac{dx}{dt}&lt;/math&gt;

and expressing the [[second derivative]] of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; (via the [[chain rule]]) as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2x}{dt^2} = \frac{dv}{dt} = \frac{dx}{dt}\frac{dv}{dx} = v\frac{dv}{dx}&lt;/math&gt;

so that the original equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;v\frac{dv}{dx} = f(x, v)&lt;/math&gt;

which is a first order equation containing no reference to the independent variable &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; and if solved provides &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; as a function of &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. Then, recalling the definition of &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dx}{dt} = v(x)  \quad \Rightarrow \quad t + C = \int \frac{d x}{v(x)} &lt;/math&gt;

which is an implicit solution.

====Special case: ''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; = ''f''(''x'')====

The special case where &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; is independent of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

benefits from separate treatment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/en/solutions/ode/ode0301.pdf Second order autonomous equation] at [[eqworld]].&lt;/ref&gt; These types of equations are very common in [[classical mechanics]] because they are always [[Hamiltonian system]]s.

The idea is to make use of the identity (barring [[division by zero]] issues)

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d x}{d t} = \left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-1}&lt;/math&gt;

which follows from the [[chain rule]]. Note aside then that by inverting both sides of a first order autonomous system, one can immediately integrate with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d x}{d t} = f(x) \quad \Rightarrow \quad \frac{d t}{d x} = \frac{1}{f(x)} \quad \Rightarrow \quad t + C = \int \frac{dx}{f(x)}&lt;/math&gt;

which is another way to view the separation of variables technique. A natural question is then: can we do something like this with higher order equations? The answer is yes for second order equations, but there's more work to do. The second derivative must be expressed as a derivative with respect to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; instead of &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} &amp;= \frac{d}{d t}\left(\frac{d x}{d t}\right) = 
\frac{d}{d x}\left(\frac{d x}{d t}\right) \frac{d x}{d t} = 
\frac{d}{d x}\left(\left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-1}\right) \left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-1} = \\

&amp; = - \left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-2} \frac{d^2 t}{d x^2} \left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-1} =
- \left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-3} \frac{d^2 t}{d x^2} = \\

&amp; = \frac{d}{d x}\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-2}\right)
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

To reemphasize: what's been accomplished is that the second derivative in &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; has been expressed as a derivative in &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt;. The original second order equation may then finally be integrated:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d x}\left(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-2}\right) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-2} = 2 \int f(x) dx + C_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d t}{d x} = \pm \frac{1}{\sqrt{2 \int f(x) dx + C_1}}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t + C_2 = \pm \int \frac{dx}{\sqrt{2 \int f(x) dx + C_1}}&lt;/math&gt;

This is an implicit solution, and beyond that the greatest potential problem is inability to simplify the integrals, which implies difficulty or impossibility in evaluating the integration constants.

====Special case: ''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;''&lt;/nowiki&gt; = ''x''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; ''f''(''x'')====

Using the above mentality, we can extend the technique to the more general equation

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d^2 x}{d t^2} = \left(\frac{d x}{d t}\right)^n f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is some parameter not equal to two. This will work since the second derivative can be written in a form involving a power of &lt;math&gt;x'&lt;/math&gt;. Rewriting the second derivative, rearranging, and expressing the left side as a derivative:

:&lt;math&gt;- \left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-3} \frac{d^2 t}{d x^2} = \left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-n} f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;- \left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{n - 3} \frac{d^2 t}{d x^2} = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{d x}\left(\frac{1}{2 - n}\left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{n - 2}\right) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{n - 2} = (2 - n) \int f(x) dx + C_1&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t + C_2 = \int \left((2 - n) \int f(x) dx + C_1\right)^{\frac{1}{n - 2}} dx&lt;/math&gt;

The right will carry +/- if &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; is even. The treatment must be different if &lt;math&gt;n = 2&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;- \left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)^{-1} \frac{d^2 t}{d x^2} = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;-\frac{d}{d x}\left(\ln\left(\frac{d t}{d x}\right)\right) = f(x)&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d t}{d x} = C_1 e^{-\int f(x) dx}&lt;/math&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;t + C_2 = C_1 \int e^{-\int f(x) dx} dx&lt;/math&gt;

=== Higher orders ===

There is no analogous method for solving third- or higher-order autonomous equations. Such equations can only be solved exactly if they happen to have some other simplifying property, for instance [[linear differential equation|linearity]] or dependence of the right side of the equation on the dependent variable only&lt;ref&gt;[http://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/en/solutions/ode/ode0503.pdf Third order autonomous equation] at [[eqworld]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://eqworld.ipmnet.ru/en/solutions/ode/ode0506.pdf Fourth order autonomous equation] at [[eqworld]].&lt;/ref&gt; (i.e., not its derivatives). This should not be surprising, considering that nonlinear autonomous systems in three dimensions can produce truly [[chaos theory|chaotic]] behavior such as the [[Lorenz attractor]] and the [[Rössler attractor]].

With this mentality, it also isn't too surprising that general non-autonomous equations of second order can't be solved explicitly, since these can also be chaotic (an example of this is a periodically forced pendulum&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''Bibhutibhushan Datta''' (also Bibhuti Bhusan Datta; [[Bengali language|Bengali]] : বিভূতিভূষণ দত্ত, Bibhūtibhūṣaṇ Datta) (28 June 1888 – 6 October 1958) was a historian of [[Indian mathematics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=R.

Datta came from a poor Bengali family. He was a student of [[Ganesh Prasad]], studied at [[University of Calcutta]] and secured the master's degree in mathematics in 1914 and doctorate degree in 1920 in applied mathematics. He taught at Calcutta University where he was Lecturer at University Science College, and during 1924–1929 he was  Rhashbehari Ghosh Professor of Applied Mathematics. During the 1920s and 1930s he created a reputation as an authority on the history of  Indian mathematics. He was also deeply interested in Indian philosophy and religion. In 1929 he retired from his professorship and left the University in 1933, and became a ''[[sannyasin]]'' (an ascetic, a person who has renounced worldly pleasures)  in 1938 under the name Swami Vidyaranya.

'''Body Shape Index''' ('''BSI''') is a metric for assessing the health implications of a given human body height, mass and waist circumference. The inclusion of the latter is believed to make the BSI a better indicator of the health risks from excess weight than the standard [[body mass index|Body Mass Index]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Doctors expose BMI shortcomings | date = 2006-01-18 | publisher = Evening Standard Limited | url = https://www.standard.co.uk/news/doctors-expose-bmi-shortcomings-7084995.html | work = London Evening Standard | accessdate = 2013-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title = A New Body Shape Index Predicts Mortality Hazard Independently of Body Mass Index | journal = PLOS ONE | date = 2012-07-18 | first = Nir Y. | last = Krakauer |author2=Jesse C.

According to the original article the formula for calculating aBSI is : &lt;math&gt;ABSI = {WC \over {BMI^{2\over 3} \times Height^{1\over 2}}}&lt;/math&gt;
&lt;br/&gt; ''Here WC (Waist circumference) and Height are measured in meters.''

The finding of the paper is that the BSI above 0.083 (when expressed in metric units) is indicative of a higher relative hazard. A value of 0.091 corresponds to the doubling 
of the relative hazard rate.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3893">In [[mathematics]], the '''Borell–Brascamp–Lieb inequality''' is an [[integral]] [[inequality (mathematics)|inequality]] due to many different mathematicians but named after [[Christer Borell]], [[Herm Jan Brascamp]] and [[Elliott Lieb]].

The result was proved for ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt;&amp;nbsp;0 by Henstock and Macbeath in 1953. The case ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0 is known as the [[Prékopa–Leindler inequality]] and was re-discovered by Brascamp and Lieb in 1976, when they proved the general version below; working independently, Borell had done the same in 1975. The nomenclature of "Borell–Brascamp–Lieb inequality" is due to Cordero-Erausquin, McCann and Schmuckenschläger, who in 2001 generalized the result to [[Riemannian manifold]]s such as the [[sphere]] and [[hyperbolic space]].

==Statement of the inequality in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;==

Let 0&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;''λ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;lt;&amp;nbsp;1, let &amp;minus;1&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''n''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;≤&amp;nbsp;+∞, and let ''f'', ''g'', ''h''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;[0,&amp;nbsp;+∞) be integrable functions such that, for all ''x'' and ''y'' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;h \left( (1 - \lambda) x + \lambda y \right) \geq M_{p} \left( f(x), g(y), \lambda \right),&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
M_{p} (a, b, \lambda) =
\begin{cases}
 &amp;\left( (1 - \lambda) a^{p} + \lambda b^{p} \right)^{1/p} \; \quad \text{if} \quad ab\neq 0\\
&amp;0  \quad \text{if} \quad ab=0
\end{cases}
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;
and &lt;math&gt;M_{0}(a,b,\lambda) = a^{1-\lambda}b^{\lambda}&lt;/math&gt;.

Then

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} h(x) \, \mathrm{d} x \geq M_{p / (n p + 1)} \left( \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} f(x) \, \mathrm{d} x, \int_{\mathbb{R}^{n}} g(x) \, \mathrm{d} x, \lambda \right).&lt;/math&gt;

(When ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;1&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''n'', the convention is to take ''p''&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;(''n''&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1) to be &amp;minus;∞; when ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;+∞, it is taken to be 1&amp;nbsp;/&amp;nbsp;''n''.)

In [[mathematics]], '''Brauer's theorem''', named for [[Richard Brauer]], is a result on the representability of 0 by forms over certain [[field (mathematics)|fields]] in sufficiently many variables.&lt;ref&gt;R. Brauer, ''A note on systems of homogeneous algebraic equations'', Bulletin of the American Mathematical Society, '''51''', pages 749-755 (1945)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Statement of Brauer's theorem==
Let ''K'' be a field such that for every integer ''r'' &gt; 0 there exists an integer ψ(''r'') such that for ''n'' ≥ ψ(r) every equation

:&lt;math&gt;(*)\qquad a_1x_1^r+\cdots+a_nx_n^r=0,\quad a_i\in K,\quad i=1,\ldots,n&lt;/math&gt;

has a non-trivial (i.e. not all ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are equal to 0) solution in ''K''.
Then, given homogeneous polynomials ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; of degrees ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; respectively with coefficients in ''K'', for every set of positive integers ''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; and every non-negative integer ''l'', there exists a number ω(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,''l'') such that for ''n'' ≥ ω(''r''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''r''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt;,''l'') there exists an ''l''-dimensional [[affine subspace]] ''M'' of ''K&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;'' (regarded as a vector space over ''K'') satisfying

:&lt;math&gt;f_1(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=\cdots=f_k(x_1,\ldots,x_n)=0,\quad\forall(x_1,\ldots,x_n)\in M.&lt;/math&gt;

==An application to the field of p-adic numbers==
Letting ''K'' be the field of [[p-adic number]]s in the theorem, the equation (*) is satisfied, since &lt;math&gt;\mathbb{Q}_p^*/\left(\mathbb{Q}_p^*\right)^b&lt;/math&gt;, ''b'' a natural number, is finite. Choosing ''k'' = 1, one obtains the following corollary:

:A homogeneous equation ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,...,''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = 0 of degree ''r'' in the field of p-adic numbers has a non-trivial solution if ''n'' is sufficiently large.

One can show that if ''n'' is sufficiently large according to the above corollary, then ''n'' is greater than ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Indeed, [[Emil Artin]] conjectured&lt;ref&gt;''Collected papers of Emil Artin'', page&amp;nbsp;x, Addison–Wesley, Reading, Mass., 1965&lt;/ref&gt; that every homogeneous polynomial of degree ''r'' over '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt; in more than ''r''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; variables represents 0. This is obviously true for ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1, and it is well known that the conjecture is true for ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;2 (see, for example, J.-P. Serre, ''A Course in Arithmetic'', Chapter IV, Theorem 6). See [[quasi-algebraic closure]] for further context.

In 1950 Demyanov&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Demyanov | first=V. B. | year=1950 |title=На кубических форм дискретных линейных нормированных полей |trans-title=On cubic forms over discrete normed fields | journal=[[Doklady Akademii Nauk SSSR]] | volume=74 | pages=889–891}}&lt;/ref&gt; verified the conjecture for ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 and ''p''&amp;nbsp;≠&amp;nbsp;3, and in 1952 [[D. J. Lewis]]&lt;ref&gt;D. J. Lewis, ''Cubic homogeneous polynomials over p-adic number fields'', Annals of Mathematics, '''56''', pages 473–478, (1952)&lt;/ref&gt; independently proved the case ''r''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 for all primes&amp;nbsp;''p''. But in 1966 [[Guy Terjanian]] constructed a homogeneous polynomial of degree 4 over '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; in 18 variables that has no non-trivial zero.&lt;ref&gt;Guy Terjanian, ''Un contre-exemple à une conjecture d'Artin'', C. R. Acad. Sci. Paris Sér. A–B, '''262''', A612, (1966)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, the [[Ax–Kochen theorem]] shows that for any fixed degree Artin's conjecture is true for all but finitely many '''Q'''&lt;sub&gt;''p''&lt;/sub&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7719">'''Burnside's lemma''', sometimes also called '''Burnside's counting theorem''', the '''Cauchy–Frobenius lemma''','''orbit-counting theorem''', or '''The Lemma that is not Burnsides' ''', is a result in [[group theory]] which is often  useful in taking account of [[symmetry]] when counting mathematical objects.  Its various eponyms are based on [[William Burnside]], [[George Pólya]], [[Augustin Louis Cauchy]], and [[Ferdinand Georg Frobenius]]. The result is not due to Burnside himself, who merely quotes it in his book 'On the Theory of Groups of Finite Order', attributing it instead to {{harvtxt|Frobenius|1887}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Burnside|1897|loc=§119}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following, let ''G'' be a [[finite set|finite]] [[group (mathematics)|group]] that [[Group action|acts]] on a [[Set (mathematics)|set]] ''X''. For each ''g'' in ''G'' let ''X&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' denote the set of [[element (mathematics)|element]]s in ''X'' that are [[fixed point (mathematics)|fixed by]] ''g'' (also said to be left [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] by ''g''), i.e. ''X&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;'' = { ''x'' ∈ ''X'' | ''g''.''x'' = ''x'' }. Burnside's lemma asserts the following formula for the number of [[orbit (group theory)|orbit]]s, denoted |''X''/''G''|:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Rotman|1995|loc=Chapter 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;|X/G| = \frac{1}{|G|}\sum_{g \in G}|X^g|.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus the number of orbits (a [[natural number]] or [[Extended real number line|+∞]]) is equal to the [[mean|average]] number of points fixed by an element of ''G'' (which is also a natural number or infinity). If ''G'' is infinite, the division by |''G''| may not be well-defined; in this case the following statement in [[cardinal arithmetic]] holds:

:&lt;math&gt;|G| |X/G| = \sum_{g \in G}|X^g|.&lt;/math&gt;

== Example application ==
The number of rotationally distinct colourings of the faces of a [[Cube (geometry)|cube]] using three colours can be determined from this formula as follows.

Let ''X'' be the set of 3&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; possible face colour combinations that can be applied to a cube in one particular orientation, and let the rotation group ''G'' of the cube act on ''X'' in the natural manner. Then two elements of ''X'' belong to the same orbit precisely when one is simply a rotation of the other. The number of rotationally distinct colourings is thus the same as the number of orbits and can be found by counting the sizes of the [[fixed set]]s for the 24 elements of ''G''.

[[Image:Face colored cube.png|thumb|Cube with coloured faces]]
* one  identity element which leaves all 3&lt;sup&gt;6&lt;/sup&gt; elements of ''X'' unchanged
* six  90-degree face rotations, each of which leaves 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of the elements of ''X'' unchanged
* three  180-degree face rotations, each of which leaves 3&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; of the elements of ''X'' unchanged
* eight  120-degree vertex rotations, each of which leaves 3&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the elements of ''X'' unchanged
* six  180-degree edge rotations, each of which leaves 3&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of the elements of ''X'' unchanged

A detailed examination of these automorphisms may be found
[[Cycle index#The cycle index of the face permutations of a cube|here]].

The average fix size is thus

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{24}\left(3^6+6\cdot 3^3 + 3 \cdot 3^4 + 8 \cdot 3^2 + 6 \cdot 3^3 \right) = 57. &lt;/math&gt;

Hence there are 57 rotationally distinct colourings of the faces of a cube in three colours. In general, the number of rotationally distinct colorings of the faces of a cube in ''n'' colors is given by

: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{24}\left(n^6+3n^4 + 12n^3 + 8n^2\right). &lt;/math&gt;

== Proof ==

The first step in the proof of the lemma is to re-express the sum over the group elements ''g''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''G'' as an equivalent sum over the set of elements ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'':

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{g \in G}|X^g| = |\{(g,x)\in G\times X \mid g \cdot x = x\}| = \sum_{x \in X} |G_x|.&lt;/math&gt;

(Here ''X&lt;sup&gt;g&lt;/sup&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''g.x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''} is the subset of all points of ''X'' fixed by ''g''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''G'', whereas ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''g''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''G''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''g.x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''x''} is the [[Orbit-stabilizer theorem#Orbits and stabilizers|stabilizer subgroup]] of G that fixes the point ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X''.)

The [[Orbit-stabilizer theorem#Orbits and stabilizers|orbit-stabilizer theorem]] says that there is a natural [[bijection]] for each ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' between the orbit of ''x'', ''G.x''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;{''g.x''&amp;nbsp;|&amp;nbsp;''g''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''G''}&amp;nbsp;⊆&amp;nbsp;''X'', and the set of left cosets ''G/G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' of its stabilizer subgroup ''G&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''. With [[Lagrange's theorem (group theory)|Lagrange's theorem]] this implies

:&lt;math&gt;|G \cdot x| = [G\,:\,G_x] = |G| / |G_x|.&lt;/math&gt;

Our sum over the set ''X'' may therefore be rewritten as

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x \in X} |G_x| = \sum_{x \in X} \frac{|G|}{|G \cdot x|} = |G| \sum_{x \in X}\frac{1}{|G \cdot x|}.&lt;/math&gt;

Finally, notice that ''X'' is the disjoint union of all its orbits in ''X/G'', which means the sum over ''X'' may be broken up into separate sums over each individual orbit.

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{x \in X}\frac{1}{|G \cdot x|} = \sum_{A\in X/G} \sum_{x\in A} \frac{1}{|A|} = \sum_{A\in X/G} 1 = |X/G|.&lt;/math&gt;

Putting everything together gives the desired result:

:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{g \in G}|X^g| = |G| \cdot |X/G|.&lt;/math&gt;

This proof is essentially also the proof of the [[class equation]] formula, simply by taking the action of ''G'' on itself (''X'' = ''G'') to be by conjugation, ''g''.''x'' = ''gxg''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;, in which case ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; instantiates to the centralizer of ''x'' in ''G''.

==History: the lemma that is not Burnside's==
[[William Burnside]] stated and proved this lemma, attributing it to {{harvnb|Frobenius|1887}}, in his 1897 book on finite groups.  But, even prior to Frobenius, the formula was known to [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy|Cauchy]] in 1845. In fact, the lemma was apparently so well known that Burnside simply omitted to attribute it to Cauchy. Consequently, this lemma is sometimes referred to as '''the lemma that is not Burnside's'''&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Neumann|1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; (see also [[Stigler's law of eponymy]]). This is less ambiguous than it may seem: Burnside contributed many lemmas to this field.{{cn|date=May 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2502">In mathematics, a '''Chevalley basis''' for a [[Simple Lie group|simple]] [[complex number|complex]] [[Lie algebra]] is a [[Basis (linear algebra)|basis]] constructed by [[Claude Chevalley]] with the property that all [[Algebra_over_a_field#Structure_coefficients|structure constants]] are integers. Chevalley used these bases to construct analogues of [[Lie group]]s over [[finite field]]s, called [[Chevalley group]]s.  The Chevalley basis is the '''Cartan-Weyl''' basis, but with a different normalization.

The generators of a Lie group are split into the generators ''H'' and ''E'' indexed by simple [[Root_system|roots]] and their negatives &lt;math&gt;\pm\alpha_i&lt;/math&gt;. The Cartan-Weyl basis may be written as
:&lt;math&gt;[H_i,H_j]=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[H_i,E_\alpha]=\alpha_i E_\alpha&lt;/math&gt;

Defining the '''dual root''' or '''coroot''' of &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; as
:&lt;math&gt;\alpha^\vee = \frac{2\alpha}{(\alpha,\alpha)}&lt;/math&gt;

One may perform a change of basis to define
:&lt;math&gt;H_{\alpha_i}=(\alpha_i^\vee, H)&lt;/math&gt;

The [[Cartan matrix|Cartan integers]] are
:&lt;math&gt;A_{ij}=(\alpha_i,\alpha_j^\vee)&lt;/math&gt;
 
The resulting relations among the generators are the following:

:&lt;math&gt;[H_{\alpha_i},H_{\alpha_j}]=0&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[H_{\alpha_i},E_{\alpha_j}]=A_{ji} E_{\alpha_j}&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[E_{-\alpha_i},E_{\alpha_i}] = H_{\alpha_i} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;[E_{\beta},E_{\gamma}]=\pm(p+1)E_{\beta+\gamma}&lt;/math&gt;
where in the last relation &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt; is the greatest positive integer such that &lt;math&gt;\gamma -p\beta&lt;/math&gt; is a root and we consider &lt;math&gt;E_{\beta + \gamma} = 0&lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt;\beta + \gamma&lt;/math&gt; is not a root.

For determining the sign in the last relation one fixes an ordering of roots which respects addition, i.e., if &lt;math&gt;\beta \prec \gamma&lt;/math&gt; then &lt;math&gt;\beta + \alpha \prec \gamma + \alpha&lt;/math&gt; provided that all four are roots.  We then call &lt;math&gt;(\beta, \gamma)&lt;/math&gt; an '''extraspecial pair''' of roots if they are both positive and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; is minimal among all &lt;math&gt;\beta_0&lt;/math&gt; that occur in pairs of positive roots &lt;math&gt;(\beta_0, \gamma_0)&lt;/math&gt; satisfying &lt;math&gt;\beta_0 + \gamma_0 = \beta + \gamma&lt;/math&gt;.  The sign in the last relation can be chosen arbitrarily whenever &lt;math&gt;(\beta, \gamma)&lt;/math&gt; is an extraspecial pair of roots.  This then determines the signs for all remaining pairs of roots.

The most common concentration ratios are the CR&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; and the CR&lt;sub&gt;8&lt;/sub&gt;, which means the market share of the four and the eight largest firms. Concentration ratios are usually used to show the extent of market control of the largest firms in the industry and to illustrate the degree to which an industry is [[oligopolistic]].&lt;ref name="amos"&gt;[http://www.amosweb.com Concentration Ratios], 16 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The standard tools of competition economists and competition authorities to measure market concentration are the [[Herfindahl-Hirschman index]] (HHI) and the concentration ratios (CR(n)).&lt;ref name="DG report"&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/competition/sectors/energy/inquiry/index.html London economics in association with global energy decisions: ''Structure and Performance of Six European Wholesale Electricity Markets in 2003, 2004 and 2005'', presented to DG Comp 26 February 2007], page 52 and page 8&lt;/ref&gt; These two are known as the traditional structural measures of market concentration (based on market shares). The concentration of firms in an industry is of interest to economists, business strategists and government agencies.&lt;ref name="quick"&gt;[http://www.quickmba.com/econ/micro/indcon.shtml Industry Concentration], 20 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

== Two common ratios ==
* The Four-Firm Concentration Ratio measures the total [[market share]] of the four largest firms in an industry.
* The Eight-Firm Concentration Ratio measures the total market share of the eight largest firms in an industry.

Usually, these two common ratios are comparable from industry to industry, while concentration ratios for other numbers of firms can be also calculated.&lt;ref name="amos"/&gt;

== Measurement ==
N-firm concentration ratio is a common measure of market structure and shows the combined market share of the N largest firms in the market. For example, the 5-firm concentration ratio in the UK pesticide industry is 0.75, which indicates that the combined market share of the five largest pesticide sellers in the UK is about 75%. 
N-firm concentration ratio does not reflect changes in the size of the largest firms. 
The [[Herfindahl index]] avoids this problem. &lt;ref name="besanko"&gt;Besanko, D., Dranove, D., Shanley, M., &amp; Schaefer, S. (2009). Economics of strategy. John Wiley &amp; Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Concentration levels ==
Concentration ratios range from 0 to 100 percent. The levels reach from ''no, low'' or ''medium'' to ''high'' to "total" concentration.&lt;br /&gt;

;Perfect competition: If there are ''N'' firms in an industry and we are looking at the top ''n'' of them, equal market share for all of them means that CR&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; = ''n/N''. All other possible values will be greater than this.
;No concentration: If CR&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt; is close to 0%, (which is only possible for quite a large number of firms in the industry ''N'') this means [[perfect competition]] or at the very least [[monopolistic competition]]. If for example CR&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;=0 %, the four largest firm in the industry would not have any significant market share.
;Low concentration: 0% to 40%.&lt;ref name="IBIS World"&gt;[https://www.ibisworld.com/about/glossary/ IBIS World]&lt;/ref&gt; This category ranges from perfect competition to an oligopoly.
;Medium concentration: 40% to 70%.&lt;ref name="IBIS World"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; An industry in this range is likely an oligopoly.
;High concentration: 70% to 100%.&lt;ref name="IBIS World"&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; This category ranges from an oligopoly to monopoly.
;Total concentration: 100% means an extremely concentrated [[oligopoly]]. If for example CR&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;= 100%, there is a [[monopoly]].

== Problems ==
The definition of the concentration ratio does not use the market shares of all the firms in the industry and does not provide the distribution of firm size. It also does not provide a lot of detail about competitiveness of the industry. The concentration ratios just provide a sign of the oligopolistic nature of an industry and indicate the degree of competition.&lt;ref name="amos"/&gt;&lt;ref name="quick"/&gt;
The [[Herfindahl index]] provides a more complete picture of industry concentration than does the concentration ratio.

== Concentration ratios in United Kingdom ==

UK industries with the highest five-firm concentration ratios (CR&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) include the following:&lt;ref name="statistics.gov.uk"&gt;[http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/elmr/economic-trends--discontinued-/no--635--october-2006/concentration-ratios-for-businesses-by-industry-in-2004.pdf National Statistics Economic Trends: Concentration Ratios 2004, pages 26 and 42-44].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sugar: 99%
* Tobacco products: 99%
* Gas distribution: 82%
* Oils and fats: 88%
* Confectionery: 81%
* Man-made fibres: 79%
* Coal extraction: 79%
* Soft drinks and mineral waters: 75%
* Pesticides: 75%
* Weapons and ammunition: 77%

UK industries with the lowest five-firm concentration ratios include the following:&lt;ref name="statistics.gov.uk"/&gt;
* Metal forging, pressing etc.: 4%
* Plastic products: 4%
* Furniture: 5%
* Construction: 5%
* Structural metal products: 6%
* Wholesale distributions: 6%
* General purpose machinery: 8%
* Wood and wood products: 9%

== Electricity specific measures ==
As to account for the specificities of electricity markets the specific structural measures are calculated. The Herfindahl index and the concentration ratios focus on the market shares of companies, but these measures identify the "pivotalness" of companies to meeting the demand on the system. A company that is very pivotal can be said to have a high market power.&lt;ref name="DG report"/&gt;

===Pivotal Supplier Index (PSI)===
The Pivotal Supplier Index considers the demand in addition to the supply side. At the most basic level, the PSI answers the question if a particular supplier, the "pivotal supplier", is needed to supply the demand: would it be possible to supply the prevalent demand also without this supplier or is he mandatory?&lt;ref name="lang"&gt;Lang, C:''Marktmacht und Marktmachtmessung im deutschen Großhandelsmarkt für Strom'', Deutscher Universitätsverlag/GWF Fachverlag Gmbh, Wiesbaden 2007, S.8, S.9 - 11&lt;/ref&gt;

The Pivotal Supplier Index is expressed as the following:

PSI = I[C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; &gt; Σ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;i=I&lt;/sub&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - Total Consumption] &lt;br /&gt;
where C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is the capacity of the potential pivotal supplier and the sum of C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; the capacity of all suppliers.
The function I[.] is the indicator function, which takes the value 1 if the expression "." contained in it is true.

An equivalent expression is the following:

PSI = I[Total consumption &gt; Σ&lt;sub&gt;i≠x&lt;/sub&gt;C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; ] &lt;br /&gt;
where the sum of capacities is taken over all suppliers apart from x.

The PSI is a binary indicator that can be calculated hourly. If the supplier C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is needed to supply the demand, it is pivotal and the index takes the value "1". If he is not pivotal, it takes the value "0".&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;

===Residual Supply Index (RSI)===
The Residual Supply Index is a simple and effective tool in monitoring market power. It is the non-binary alternative to the PSI.&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The Residual Supply Index is expressed as:

RSI = (Σ&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; - C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;)/Last&lt;br /&gt;
where C&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt; is the capacity of the analysed supplier and the sum of C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; the capacity of all suppliers.

Receiving a result bigger than 100% is an indication that the supplier x should have little influence on the price. With a RSI smaller than 100%. the supplier x could easily practise market power. The RSI has the advantage over the PSI to be not binary and for this reason it can better indicate the increase of the structural market power.&lt;ref name="lang"/&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''continuous function''' is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] for which sufficiently small changes in the input result in arbitrarily small changes in the output. Otherwise, a function is said to be a ''discontinuous'' function. A continuous function with a continuous [[inverse function]] is called a [[homeomorphism]].

Continuity of functions is one of the core concepts of [[topology]], which is treated in full generality below. The introductory portion of this article focuses on the special case where the inputs and outputs of functions are [[real number]]s.  A stronger form of continuity is [[uniform continuity]]. In addition, this article discusses the definition for the more general case of functions between two [[metric space]]s. In [[order theory]], especially in [[domain theory]], one considers a notion of continuity known as [[Scott continuity]]. Other forms of continuity do exist but they are not discussed in this article.

As an example, consider the function ''h''(''t''), which describes the [[height]] of a growing flower at time ''t''. This function is continuous. By contrast, if ''M''(''t'') denotes the amount of money in a bank account at time ''t'', then the function jumps at each point in time when money is deposited or withdrawn, so the function ''M''(''t'') is discontinuous.

==History==

A form of the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|epsilon–delta definition]] of continuity was first given by [[Bernard Bolzano]] in 1817. [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]] defined continuity of &lt;math&gt;y=f(x)&lt;/math&gt; as follows: an infinitely small increment &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of the independent variable ''x'' always produces an infinitely small change &lt;math&gt;f(x+\alpha)-f(x)&lt;/math&gt; of the dependent variable ''y'' (see e.g. ''[[Cours d'Analyse]]'', p.&amp;nbsp;34). Cauchy defined infinitely small quantities in terms of variable quantities, and his definition of continuity closely parallels the infinitesimal definition used today (see [[microcontinuity]]). The formal definition and the distinction between pointwise continuity and [[uniform continuity]] were first given by Bolzano in the 1830s but the work wasn't published until the 1930s. Like Bolzano,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Bolzano|first1=Bernard|title=Rein analytischer Beweis des Lehrsatzes dass zwischen je zwey Werthen, die ein entgegengesetztes Resultat gewaehren, wenigstens eine reele Wurzel der Gleichung liege|publisher=Haase|location=Prague|date=1817}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Karl Weierstrass]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Dugac | first1=Pierre | title=Eléments d'Analyse de Karl Weierstrass | journal=Archive for History of Exact Sciences | year=1973 | volume=10 | pages=41–176 | doi=10.1007/bf00343406}}&lt;/ref&gt; denied continuity of a function at a point ''c'' unless it was defined at and on both sides of ''c'', but [[Édouard Goursat]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Goursat | first1=E. | title=A course in mathematical analysis | publisher=Ginn | location=Boston | year=1904 | page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed the function to be defined only at and on one side of ''c'', and [[Camille Jordan]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Jordan | first1=M.C. | title=Cours d'analyse de l'École polytechnique | publisher=Gauthier-Villars | location=Paris | edition=2nd |year=1893 | volume=1|page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt; allowed it even if the function was defined only at ''c''. All three of those nonequivalent definitions of pointwise continuity are still in use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last1=Harper|first1=J.F.|title=Defining continuity of real functions of real variables|journal=BSHM Bulletin: Journal of the British Society for the History of Mathematics|year=2016|doi=10.1080/17498430.2015.1116053|pages=1–16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Eduard Heine]] provided the first published definition of uniform continuity in 1872, but based these ideas on lectures given by [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]] in 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Rusnock|first1=P.|last2=Kerr-Lawson|first2=A.|title=Bolzano and uniform continuity|journal=Historia Mathematica|volume=32|year=2005|pages=303–311|issue=3|doi=10.1016/j.hm.2004.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real functions==

===Definition===
[[File:Function-1 x.svg|thumb|The function &lt;math&gt;f(x)=\tfrac 1x&lt;/math&gt; is continuous on the domain &lt;math&gt;\R\smallsetminus \{0\}&lt;/math&gt;, but is not continuous over the domain &lt;math&gt;\R&lt;/math&gt; because it is undefined at &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt;]]

A [[real function]], that is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] from [[real number]]s to real numbers can be represented by a [[graph of a function|graph]] in the [[Cartesian coordinate system|Cartesian plane]]; such a function is continuous if, roughly speaking, the graph is a single unbroken [[curve]] whose [[domain (math)|domain]] is the entire real line.  A more mathematically rigorous definition is given below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://math.mit.edu/~jspeck/18.01_Fall%202014/Supplementary%20notes/01c.pdf | title=Continuity and Discontinuity | last1=Speck | first1=Jared | year=2014 | page=3 | access-date=2016-09-02 | website=MIT Math | quote=Example 5. The function 1/''x'' is continuous on (0, ∞) and on (−∞, 0), i.e., for ''x'' &gt; 0 and for ''x'' &lt; 0, in other words, at every point in its domain. However, it is not a continuous function since its domain is not an interval. It has a single point of discontinuity, namely ''x'' = 0, and it has an infinite discontinuity there.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A rigorous definition of continuity of real functions is usually given in a first course in calculus in terms of the idea of a [[limit (mathematics)|limit]]. First, a function {{math|''f''}} with variable {{mvar|x}} is said to be continuous ''at the point'' {{math|c}} on the real line, if the limit of {{math|''f''(''x'')}}, as {{mvar|x}} approaches that point {{math|c}}, is equal to the value {{math|''f''(c)}}; and second, the ''function (as a whole)'' is said to be ''continuous'', if it is continuous at every point. A function is said to be ''discontinuous'' (or to have a ''discontinuity'') at some point when it is not continuous there. These points themselves are also addressed as ''discontinuities''.

There are several different definitions of continuity of a function.  Sometimes a function is said to be continuous if it is continuous at every point in its domain.  In this case, the function {{math|''f''(''x'')&amp;thinsp;{{=}}&amp;thinsp;tan(''x'')}}, with the domain of all real {{math|''x'' ≠ (2''n''+1)π/2}}, {{math|''n''}}&amp;nbsp;any integer, is continuous. Sometimes an exception is made for boundaries of the domain. For example, the graph of the function {{math|''f''(''x'')&amp;thinsp;{{=}}&amp;thinsp;{{sqrt|''x''}}}}, with the domain of all non-negative reals, has a ''left-hand'' endpoint. In this case only the limit from the ''right'' is required to equal the value of the function. Under this definition ''f'' is continuous at the boundary {{math|''x'' {{=}} 0}} and so for all non-negative arguments. The most common and restrictive definition is that a function is continuous if it is continuous at all real numbers.  In this case, the previous two examples are not continuous, but every [[polynomial]] function is continuous, as are the [[sine]], [[cosine]], and [[exponential functions]].  Care should be exercised in using the word ''continuous'', so that it is clear from the context which meaning of the word is intended.

Using mathematical notation, there are several ways to define continuous functions in each of the three senses mentioned above.

Let
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon D \rightarrow \mathbf R \quad&lt;/math&gt; be a function defined on a [[subset]] &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; of the set &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt; of real numbers.

This subset &lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; is the [[domain of a function|domain]] of ''f''. Some possible choices include 
:&lt;math&gt;D = \mathbf R \quad &lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; is the whole set of real numbers), or, for ''a'' and ''b'' real numbers,
:&lt;math&gt;D = [a, b] = \{x \in \mathbf R \,|\, a \leq x \leq b \} \quad &lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; is a [[closed interval]]), or
:&lt;math&gt;D = (a, b) = \{x \in \mathbf R \,|\, a &lt; x &lt; b \} \quad &lt;/math&gt; (&lt;math&gt; D &lt;/math&gt; is an [[open interval]]).

In case of the domain &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt; being defined as an open interval, &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; are no boundaries in the above sense and the values of &lt;math&gt;f(a)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;f(b)&lt;/math&gt; do not matter for continuity on &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.

====Definition in terms of limits of functions====
The function ''f'' is ''continuous at some point'' ''c'' of its domain if the [[limit of a function|limit]] of ''f''(''x''), as ''x'' approaches ''c'' through the domain of ''f'',  exists and is equal to ''f''(''c'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Lang | first1=Serge | author1-link=Serge Lang | title=Undergraduate analysis | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | edition=2nd | series=[[Undergraduate Texts in Mathematics]] | isbn=978-0-387-94841-6 | year=1997}}, section II.4&lt;/ref&gt; In mathematical notation, this is written as
:&lt;math&gt;\lim_{x \to c}{f(x)} = f(c).&lt;/math&gt;
In detail this means three conditions: first, ''f'' has to be defined at ''c'' (guaranteed by the requirement that ''c'' is in the domain of ''f''). Second, the limit on the left hand side of that equation has to exist.  Third, the value of this limit must equal ''f''(''c'').

(We have here assumed that the domain of ''f'' does not have any [[isolated point]]s.  For example, an interval or union of intervals has no isolated points.)

====Definition in terms of neighborhoods====
A [[neighborhood (mathematics)|neighborhood]] of a point ''c'' is a set that contains all points of the domain within some fixed distance of ''c''.  Intuitively, a function is continuous at a point ''c'' if the range of the restriction of ''f'' to a neighborhood of ''c'' shrinks to a single point ''f''(''c'') as the width of the neighborhood around ''c'' shrinks to zero.  More precisely, a function ''f'' is continuous at a point ''c'' of its domain if, for any neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N_1(f(c))&lt;/math&gt; there is a neighborhood &lt;math&gt;N_2(c)&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x)\in N_1(f(c))&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;x\in N_2(c)&lt;/math&gt;.

This definition only requires that the domain and the codomain are topological spaces and is thus the most general definition.  It follows from this definition that a function ''f'' is automatically continuous at every [[isolated point]] of its domain.  As a specific example, every real valued function on the set of integers is continuous.

====Definition in terms of limits of sequences====
[[File:Continuity of the Exponential at 0.svg|thumb|The sequence exp(1/''n'') converges to exp(0)]]
One can instead require that for any [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]] &lt;math&gt;(x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; of points in the domain which [[convergent sequence|converges]] to ''c'', the corresponding sequence &lt;math&gt;\left(f(x_n)\right)_{n\in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; converges to ''f''(''c'').  In mathematical notation, &lt;math&gt;\forall (x_n)_{n\in\mathbb{N}} \subset D:\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n=c \Rightarrow \lim_{n\to\infty} f(x_n)=f(c)\,.&lt;/math&gt;

====Weierstrass and Jordan definitions (epsilon–delta) of continuous functions====
[[File:Example of continuous function.svg|right|thumb|Illustration of the ε-δ-definition: for ε=0.5, c=2, the value δ=0.5 satisfies the condition of the definition.]]
Explicitly including the definition of the limit of a function, we obtain a self-contained definition:
Given a function  ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''R'' as above and an element ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; of the domain ''D'', ''f'' is said to be continuous at the point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; when the following holds: For any number ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0, however small, there exists some number ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for all ''x'' in the domain of ''f'' with ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''δ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''δ'', the value of ''f''(''x'') satisfies

:&lt;math&gt; f(x_0) - \varepsilon &lt; f(x) &lt; f(x_0) + \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively written, continuity of ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''R'' at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''D'' means that for every&amp;nbsp;''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 there exists a ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;:

:&lt;math&gt;| x - x_0 | &lt; \delta \Rightarrow | f(x) - f(x_0) | &lt; \varepsilon. &lt;/math&gt;

More intuitively, we can say that if we want to get all the ''f''(''x'') values to stay in some small [[topological neighbourhood|neighborhood]] around ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;), we simply need to choose a small enough neighborhood for the ''x'' values around ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;. If we can do that no matter how small the ''f''(''x'') neighborhood is, then ''f'' is continuous at&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;.

In modern terms, this is generalized by the definition of continuity of a function with respect to a [[basis (topology)|basis for the topology]], here the [[metric topology]].

Weierstrass had required that the interval ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;''δ''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''δ'' be entirely within the domain ''D'', but Jordan removed that restriction.

====Definition in terms of control of the remainder====
In proofs and numerical analysis we often need to know how fast limits are converging, or in other words, control of the remainder. We can formalise this to a definition of continuity. 
A function &lt;math&gt;C: [0,\infty) \to [0,\infty]&lt;/math&gt; is called a control function if
* ''C'' is non decreasing
*&lt;math&gt; \inf_{\delta &gt; 0} C(\delta) = 0&lt;/math&gt;

A function ''f''&amp;nbsp;:&amp;nbsp;''D''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''R''  is ''C''-continuous at ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if 
::  &lt;math&gt;| f(x) - f(x_0)| \le C(|x- x_0|)&lt;/math&gt;  for all &lt;math&gt; x \in D &lt;/math&gt;

A function is continuous in ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if it is ''C''-continuous for some control function ''C''.

This approach leads naturally to refining the notion of  continuity by restricting the set of admissible control functions. For a given set of control functions &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt; a function is &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;-continuous if it is &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;-continuous for some &lt;math&gt; C \in \mathcal{C}&lt;/math&gt;. For example the [[Lipschitz continuity|Lipschitz]] and [[Hölder continuous function]]s of exponent &amp;alpha;  below are defined by the set of control functions 
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_{\mathrm{Lipschitz}} = \{C |  C(\delta) = K|\delta| ,\  K &gt; 0\} &lt;/math&gt; 
respectively  
::&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{C}_{\text{Hölder}-\alpha} =&lt;/math&gt;&lt;math&gt; \{C | C(\delta)  = K |\delta|^\alpha, \ K &gt; 0\} &lt;/math&gt;.

====Definition using oscillation====
[[File:Rapid Oscillation.svg|thumb|The failure of a function to be continuous at a point is quantified by its [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]].]]
Continuity can also be defined in terms of [[Oscillation (mathematics)|oscillation]]: a function ''f'' is continuous at a point ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; if and only if its oscillation at that point is zero;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/texts/TRENCH_REAL_ANALYSIS.PDF Introduction to Real Analysis],'' updated April 2010, William F. Trench, Theorem 3.5.2, p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; in symbols, &lt;math&gt;\omega_f(x_0) = 0.&lt;/math&gt; A benefit of this definition is that it ''quantifies'' discontinuity: the oscillation gives how ''much'' the function is discontinuous at a point.

This definition is useful in [[descriptive set theory]] to study the set of discontinuities and continuous points – the continuous points are the intersection of the sets where the oscillation is less than ''ε'' (hence a [[G-delta set|G&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; set]]) – and gives a very quick proof of one direction of the [[Lebesgue integrability condition]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://ramanujan.math.trinity.edu/wtrench/texts/TRENCH_REAL_ANALYSIS.PDF Introduction to Real Analysis],'' updated April 2010, William F. Trench, 3.5 "A More Advanced Look at the Existence of the Proper Riemann Integral", pp. 171–177&lt;/ref&gt;

The oscillation is equivalent to the ''ε''-''δ'' definition by a simple re-arrangement, and by using a limit ([[lim sup]], [[lim inf]]) to define oscillation: if (at a given point) for a given ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; there is no ''δ'' that satisfies the ''ε''-''δ'' definition, then the oscillation is at least ''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, and conversely if for every ''ε'' there is a desired ''δ,'' the oscillation is 0. The oscillation definition can be naturally generalized to maps from a topological space to a metric space.

====Definition using the hyperreals====
[[Cauchy]] defined continuity of a function in the following intuitive terms: an [[infinitesimal]] change in the independent variable corresponds to an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable (see ''Cours d'analyse'', page 34). [[Non-standard analysis]] is a way of making this mathematically rigorous. The real line is augmented by the addition of infinite and infinitesimal numbers to form the [[hyperreal numbers]].  In nonstandard analysis, continuity can be defined as follows.

:A real-valued function ''f'' is continuous at ''x'' if its natural extension to the hyperreals has the property that for all infinitesimal ''dx'', {{nowrap|''f''(''x''+''dx'') − ''f''(''x'')}} is infinitesimal&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.wisc.edu/~keisler/calc.html|title=Elementary Calculus|work=wisc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

(see [[microcontinuity]]).  In other words, an infinitesimal increment of the independent variable always produces to an infinitesimal change of the dependent variable, giving a modern expression to [[Augustin-Louis Cauchy]]'s definition of continuity.

===Construction of continuous functions===
[[File:Brent method example.svg|right|thumb|The graph of a [[cubic function]] has no jumps or holes. The function is continuous.]]

Checking the continuity of a given function can be simplified by checking one of the above defining properties for the building blocks of the given function. It is straightforward to show that the sum of two functions, continuous on some domain, is also continuous on this domain. Given
:&lt;math&gt;f, g\colon D \rightarrow \mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;,

then the ''sum of continuous functions''
:&lt;math&gt;s = f + g&lt;/math&gt; 
(defined  by &lt;math&gt;s(x) = f(x) + g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x\in D&lt;/math&gt;)
is continuous in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.

The same holds for the ''product of continuous functions,''
:&lt;math&gt;p = f \cdot g&lt;/math&gt;
(defined by &lt;math&gt;p(x) = f(x) \cdot g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in D&lt;/math&gt;)
is continuous in &lt;math&gt;D&lt;/math&gt;.

Combining the above preservations of continuity and the continuity of [[constant function]]s and of the [[identity function]] &lt;math&gt;I(x) = x&lt;/math&gt; {{nowrap|on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;,}} one arrives at the continuity of all [[polynomial|polynomial function]]s {{nowrap|on &lt;math&gt;\mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;,}} such as
:{{math|1=''f''(''x'') = ''x''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; + ''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; - 5''x'' + 3}}
(pictured on the right).

[[File:Homografia.svg|right|thumb|The graph of a continuous [[rational function]]. The function is not defined for ''x''=−2. The vertical and horizontal lines are [[asymptote]]s.]]

In the same way it can be shown that the ''reciprocal of a continuous function'' 
:&lt;math&gt;r = 1/f&lt;/math&gt;
(defined by &lt;math&gt;r(x) = 1/f(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in D&lt;/math&gt; such that &lt;math&gt;f(x) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;)
is continuous in &lt;math&gt;D\smallsetminus \{x:f(x) = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

This implies that, excluding the roots of &lt;math&gt;g&lt;/math&gt;, the ''quotient of continuous functions'' 
:&lt;math&gt;q = f/g&lt;/math&gt;
(defined by &lt;math&gt;q(x) = f(x)/g(x)&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;x \in D&lt;/math&gt;, such that &lt;math&gt;g(x) \ne 0&lt;/math&gt;)
is also continuous on &lt;math&gt;D\smallsetminus \{x:g(x) = 0\}&lt;/math&gt;.

For example, the function (pictured)
:&lt;math&gt;y(x) = \frac {2x-1} {x+2}&lt;/math&gt;

is defined for all real numbers {{nowrap|''x'' ≠ −2}} and is continuous at every such point. Thus it is a continuous function. The question of continuity at {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} −2}} does not arise, since  {{nowrap|''x'' {{=}} −2}} is not in the domain of ''y''. There is no continuous function ''F'': '''R''' → '''R''' that agrees with ''y''(''x'') for all {{nowrap|''x'' ≠ −2}}.

[[File:Si cos.svg|thumb|The sinc and the cos functions]]

Since the function [[sine]] is continuous on all reals, the [[sinc function]] ''G''(''x'') = sin&amp;nbsp;''x''/''x'', is defined and continuous for all real ''x'' ≠ 0. However, unlike the previous example, ''G'' ''can'' be extended to a continuous function on ''all'' real numbers, by ''defining'' the value ''G''(0) to be 1, which is the limit of ''G''(''x''), when ''x'' approaches 0, i.e.,
: &lt;math&gt;G(0) = \lim_{x\rightarrow 0}\frac{\sin x}{x} = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus, by setting
:&lt;math&gt;
G(x) = 
\begin{cases}
\frac {\sin (x)}x &amp; \text{ if }x \ne 0\\
1 &amp; \text{ if }x = 0,
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

the sinc-function becomes a continuous function on all real numbers. The term ''[[removable singularity]]'' is used in such cases, when (re)defining values of a function to coincide with the appropriate limits make a function continuous at specific points.

A more involved construction of continuous functions is the [[function composition]]. Given two continuous functions
:&lt;math&gt;\quad g\colon D_g \subseteq \mathbf R \rightarrow R_g \subseteq\mathbf R\quad\text{and}\quad f\colon D_f \subseteq \mathbf R\rightarrow R_f\subseteq D_g,&lt;/math&gt; 
their composition, denoted as
&lt;math&gt;c = g \circ f \colon D_f \rightarrow \mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;, and defined by &lt;math&gt;c(x) = g(f(x)),&lt;/math&gt; is continuous.

This construction allows stating, for example, that
: &lt;math&gt;e^{\sin(\ln x)}&lt;/math&gt; is continuous for all &lt;math&gt;x &gt; 0.&lt;/math&gt;

===Examples of discontinuous functions===
[[File:Discontinuity of the sign function at 0.svg|thumb|300px|Plot of the signum function. It shows that &lt;math&gt;\lim_{n\to\infty} \sgn\left(\tfrac 1n\right) \neq\sgn\left(\lim_{n\to\infty} \tfrac 1n\right)&lt;/math&gt;. Thus, the signum function is discontinuous at 0 for point 2.1.3.]]
An example of a discontinuous function is the [[Heaviside step function]] &lt;math&gt;H&lt;/math&gt;, defined by

:&lt;math&gt;H(x) = \begin{cases}
1 &amp; \text{ if } x \ge 0\\
0 &amp; \text{ if } x &lt; 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

Pick for instance &lt;math&gt;\varepsilon = 1/2&lt;/math&gt;. Then there is no {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhood}} around &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. no open interval &lt;math&gt;(-\delta,\;\delta)&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\delta &gt; 0,&lt;/math&gt; that will force all the &lt;math&gt;H(x)&lt;/math&gt; values to be within the {{nowrap|&lt;math&gt;\varepsilon&lt;/math&gt;-neighborhood}} of &lt;math&gt;H(0)&lt;/math&gt;, i.e. within &lt;math&gt;(1/2,\;3/2)&lt;/math&gt;. Intuitively we can think of this type of discontinuity as a sudden [[Jump discontinuity|jump]] in function values.

Similarly, the [[sign function|signum]] or sign function
:&lt;math&gt;
\sgn(x) = \begin{cases}
\;\;\ 1 &amp; \text{ if }x &gt; 0\\
\;\;\ 0 &amp; \text{ if }x = 0\\
-1 &amp; \text{ if }x &lt; 0
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;
is discontinuous at &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt; but continuous everywhere else. Yet another example: the function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{cases}
  \sin\left(x^{-2}\right)&amp;\text{ if }x \ne 0\\
   0&amp;\text{ if }x = 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
is continuous everywhere apart from &lt;math&gt;x = 0&lt;/math&gt;.

[[File:Thomae function (0,1).svg|200px|right|thumb|Point plot of Thomae's function on the interval (0,1). The topmost point in the middle shows f(1/2) = 1/2.]]
Besides plausible continuities and discontinuities like above, there are also functions with a behavior, often coined [[Pathological (mathematics)|pathological]], for example, [[Thomae's function]],
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\begin{cases}
1   &amp;\text{ if }x=0\\
\frac{1}{q}&amp;\text{ if }x=\frac{p}{q}\text{(in lowest terms) is a rational number}\\
  0&amp;\text{ if }x\text{ is irrational}.
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
is continuous at all irrational numbers and discontinuous at all rational numbers. In a similar vein, [[Dirichlet's function]], the [[indicator function]] for the set of rational numbers,
:&lt;math&gt;D(x)=\begin{cases}
  0&amp;\text{ if }x\text{  is irrational } (\in \mathbb{R} \smallsetminus \mathbb{Q})\\
  1&amp;\text{ if }x\text{ is rational } (\in \mathbb{Q})
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
is nowhere continuous.

===Properties===

====Intermediate value theorem====
The [[intermediate value theorem]] is an [[existence theorem]], based on the real number property of [[Real number#Completeness|completeness]], and states:

: If the real-valued function ''f'' is continuous on the [[interval (mathematics)|closed interval]] [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] and ''k'' is some number between ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b''), then there is some number ''c'' in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] such that ''f''(''c'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''k''.

For example, if a child grows from 1&amp;nbsp;m to 1.5&amp;nbsp;m between the ages of two and six years, then, at some time between two and six years of age, the child's height must have been 1.25&amp;nbsp;m.

As a consequence, if ''f'' is continuous on [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''] and ''f''(''a'') and ''f''(''b'') differ in [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]], then, at some point ''c'' in [''a'',&amp;nbsp;''b''], ''f''(''c'') must equal [[0 (number)|zero]].

====Extreme value theorem====
The [[extreme value theorem]] states that if a function ''f'' is defined on a closed interval [''a'',''b''] (or any closed and bounded set) and is continuous there, then the function attains its maximum, i.e. there exists ''c''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[''a'',''b''] with ''f''(''c'') ≥ ''f''(''x'') for all ''x''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;[''a'',''b'']. The same is true of the minimum of ''f''. These statements are not, in general, true if the function is defined on an open interval (''a'',''b'') (or any set that is not both closed and bounded), as, for example, the continuous function ''f''(''x'') = 1/''x'', defined on the open interval (0,1), does not attain a maximum, being unbounded above.

====Relation to differentiability and integrability====
Every [[differentiable function]]
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon (a, b) \rightarrow \mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;
is continuous, as can be shown. The [[Theorem#Converse|converse]]  does not hold: for example, the [[absolute value]] function
:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=|x| = \begin{cases}
  \;\;\ x &amp; \text{ if }x \geq 0\\
  -x &amp; \text{ if }x &lt; 0
\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;
is everywhere continuous. However, it is not differentiable at ''x'' = 0 (but is so everywhere else). [[Weierstrass function|Weierstrass's function]] is also everywhere continuous but nowhere differentiable.

The [[derivative]] ''f′''(''x'') of a differentiable function ''f''(''x'') need not be continuous. If ''f′''(''x'') is continuous, ''f''(''x'') is said to be continuously differentiable. The set of such functions is denoted ''C''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;({{open-open|''a'', ''b''}}). More generally, the set of functions
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon \Omega \rightarrow \mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;
(from an open interval (or [[open subset]] of '''R''') Ω to the reals) such that ''f'' is ''n'' times differentiable and such that the ''n''-th derivative of ''f'' is continuous is denoted ''C''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω). See [[differentiability class]]. In the field of computer graphics, these three levels are sometimes called ''G''&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt; (continuity of position), ''G''&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt; (continuity of tangency), and ''G''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (continuity of curvature).

Every continuous function
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon [a, b] \rightarrow \mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;
is [[integrable function|integrable]] (for example in the sense of the [[Riemann integral]]). The converse does not hold, as the (integrable, but discontinuous) [[sign function]] shows.

====Pointwise and uniform limits====
[[File:Uniform continuity animation.gif|A sequence of continuous functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') whose (pointwise) limit function ''f''(''x'') is discontinuous. The convergence is not uniform.|right|thumb]]
Given a [[sequence (mathematics)|sequence]]
:&lt;math&gt;f_1, f_2, \dotsc \colon I \rightarrow \mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;
of functions such that the limit
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) := \lim_{n \rightarrow \infty} f_n(x)&lt;/math&gt;
exists for all ''x'' in ''D'', the resulting function ''f''(''x'') is referred to as the [[pointwise convergence|pointwise limit]] of the sequence of functions (''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;''n''∈'''N'''&lt;/sub&gt;. The pointwise limit function need not be continuous, even if all functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are continuous, as the animation at the right shows. However, ''f'' is continuous if all functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; are continuous and the sequence [[uniform convergence|converges uniformly]], by the [[uniform convergence theorem]]. This theorem can be used to show that the [[exponential function]]s, [[logarithm]]s, [[square root]] function, [[trigonometric function]]s are continuous.

===Directional and semi-continuity===
&lt;div style="float:right;"&gt;
&lt;gallery&gt;Image:Right-continuous.svg|A right-continuous function
Image:Left-continuous.svg|A left-continuous function&lt;/gallery&gt;&lt;/div&gt;
Discontinuous functions may be discontinuous in a restricted way, giving rise to the concept of directional continuity (or right and left continuous functions) and [[semi-continuity]]. Roughly speaking, a function is ''right-continuous'' if no jump occurs when the limit point is approached from the right. Formally, ''f'' is said to be right-continuous at the point ''c'' if the following holds: For any number ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; 0 however small, there exists some number ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; 0 such that for all ''x'' in the domain with {{nowrap|''c'' &amp;lt; ''x'' &amp;lt; ''c'' + ''δ''}}, the value of ''f''(''x'') will satisfy

:&lt;math&gt; |f(x) - f(c)| &lt; \varepsilon.&lt;/math&gt;

This is the same condition as for continuous functions, except that it is required to hold for ''x'' strictly larger than ''c'' only. Requiring it instead for all ''x'' with {{nowrap|''c'' − ''δ'' &amp;lt; ''x'' &amp;lt; ''c''}} yields the notion of ''left-continuous'' functions. A function is continuous if and only if it is both right-continuous and left-continuous.

A function ''f'' is ''[[Semi-continuity|lower semi-continuous]]'' if, roughly, any jumps that might occur only go down, but not up. That is, for any ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; 0, there exists some number ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&amp;gt; 0 such that for all ''x'' in the domain with {{nowrap|{{abs|x − c}} &lt; ''δ''}}, the value of ''f''(''x'') satisfies
:&lt;math&gt;f(x) \geq f(c) - \epsilon.&lt;/math&gt;
The reverse condition is ''[[Semi-continuity|upper semi-continuity]]''.

==Continuous functions between metric spaces== &lt;!--This section is linked from [[F-space]]--&gt;

The concept of continuous real-valued functions can be generalized to functions between [[metric space]]s. A metric space is a set ''X'' equipped with a function (called [[metric (mathematics)|metric]]) ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;, that can be thought of as a measurement of the distance of any two elements in ''X''. Formally, the metric is a function
:&lt;math&gt;d_X \colon X \times X \rightarrow \mathbf R&lt;/math&gt;
that satisfies a number of requirements, notably the [[triangle inequality]]. Given two metric spaces (''X'', d&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''Y'', d&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;) and a function
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
then ''f'' is continuous at the point ''c'' in ''X'' (with respect to the given metrics) if for any positive real number ε, there exists a positive real number δ such that all ''x'' in ''X'' satisfying d&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'', ''c'') &lt; δ will also satisfy d&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''(''x''), ''f''(''c'')) &lt; ε. As in the case of real functions above, this is equivalent to the condition that for every sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''X'' with limit lim ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''c'', we have lim ''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) = ''f''(''c''). The latter condition can be weakened as follows: ''f'' is continuous at the point ''c'' if and only if for every convergent sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''X'' with limit ''c'', the sequence (''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) is a [[Cauchy sequence]], and ''c'' is in the domain of ''f''.

The set of points at which a function between metric spaces is continuous is a [[Gδ set|G&lt;sub&gt;δ&lt;/sub&gt; set]]&amp;nbsp;– this follows from the ε-δ definition of continuity.

This notion of continuity is applied, for example, in [[functional analysis]]. A key statement in this area says that a [[linear operator]]
:&lt;math&gt;T\colon V \rightarrow W&lt;/math&gt;
between [[normed vector space]]s ''V'' and ''W'' (which are [[vector spaces]] equipped with a compatible [[norm (mathematics)|norm]], denoted ||''x''||)
is continuous if and only if it is [[Bounded linear operator|bounded]], that is, there is a constant ''K'' such that
:&lt;math&gt;\|T(x)\| \leq K \|x\|&lt;/math&gt;
for all ''x'' in ''V''.

===Uniform, Hölder and Lipschitz continuity===
[[File:Lipschitz continuity.png|thumb|For a Lipschitz continuous function, there is a double cone (shown in white) whose vertex can be translated along the graph, so that the graph always remains entirely outside the cone.]]
The concept of continuity for functions between metric spaces can be strengthened in various ways by limiting the way δ depends on ε and ''c'' in the definition above. Intuitively, a function ''f'' as above is [[uniformly continuous]] if the δ does
not depend on the point ''c''. More precisely, it is required that for every [[real number]] ''ε''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 there exists ''δ''&amp;nbsp;&gt;&amp;nbsp;0 such that for every ''c'',&amp;nbsp;''b''&amp;nbsp;∈&amp;nbsp;''X'' with ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt;(''b'',&amp;nbsp;''c'')&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''δ'', we have that ''d''&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt;(''f''(''b''),&amp;nbsp;''f''(''c''))&amp;nbsp;&lt;&amp;nbsp;''ε''. Thus, any uniformly continuous function is continuous. The converse does not hold in general, but holds when the domain space ''X'' is [[compact topological space|compact]]. Uniformly continuous maps can be defined in the more general situation of [[uniform space]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Gaal | first1=Steven A. | title=Point set topology | publisher=[[Dover Publications]] | location=New York | isbn=978-0-486-47222-5 | year=2009}}, section IV.10&lt;/ref&gt;

A function is [[Hölder continuity|Hölder continuous]] with exponent α (a real number) if there is a constant ''K'' such that for all ''b'' and ''c'' in ''X'', the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;d_Y (f(b), f(c)) \leq K \cdot (d_X (b, c))^\alpha&lt;/math&gt;
holds. Any Hölder continuous function is uniformly continuous. The particular case {{nowrap|α {{=}} 1}} is referred to as [[Lipschitz continuity]]. That is, a function is Lipschitz continuous if there is a constant ''K'' such that the inequality
:&lt;math&gt;d_Y (f(b), f(c)) \leq K \cdot d_X (b, c)&lt;/math&gt;
holds for any ''b'', ''c'' in ''X''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last1=Searcóid | first1=Mícheál Ó | title=Metric spaces | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aP37I4QWFRcC | publisher=[[Springer-Verlag]] | location=Berlin, New York | series=Springer undergraduate mathematics series | isbn=978-1-84628-369-7 | year=2006}}, section 9.4&lt;/ref&gt; The Lipschitz condition occurs, for example, in the [[Picard–Lindelöf theorem]] concerning the solutions of [[ordinary differential equation]]s.

=={{anchor|Continuous map (topology)}}Continuous functions between topological spaces==
&lt;!--Linked from [[Preference (economics)]] and [[Continuity (topology)]]--&gt;

Another, more abstract, notion of continuity is continuity of functions between [[topological space]]s in which there generally is no formal notion of distance, as there is in the case of [[metric space]]s. A topological space is a set ''X'' together with a topology on ''X'', which is a set of [[subset]]s of ''X'' satisfying a few requirements with respect to their unions and intersections that generalize the properties of the [[open ball]]s in metric spaces while still allowing to talk about the [[neighbourhood (mathematics)|neighbourhoods]] of a given point. The elements of a topology are called [[open subset]]s of ''X'' (with respect to the topology).

A function
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt;
between two topological spaces ''X'' and ''Y'' is continuous if for every open set ''V'' ⊆ ''Y'', the [[Image (mathematics)#Inverse image|inverse image]]
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(V) = \{x \in X \; | \; f(x) \in V \}&lt;/math&gt;
is an open subset of ''X''. That is, ''f'' is a function between the sets ''X'' and ''Y'' (not on the elements of the topology ''T&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;''), but the continuity of ''f'' depends on the topologies used on ''X'' and ''Y''.

This is equivalent to the condition that the [[Image (mathematics)#Inverse image|preimages]] of the [[closed set]]s (which are the complements of the open subsets) in ''Y'' are closed in ''X''.

An extreme example: if a set ''X'' is given the [[discrete topology]] (in which every subset is open), all functions
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \rightarrow T&lt;/math&gt;
to any topological space ''T'' are continuous. On the other hand, if ''X'' is equipped with the [[indiscrete topology]] (in which the only open subsets are the empty set and ''X'') and the space ''T'' set is at least [[T0 space|T&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;]], then the only continuous functions are the constant functions. Conversely, any function whose range is indiscrete is continuous.

===Continuity at a point===
[[File:continuity topology.svg|300px|right|frame|Continuity at a point: For every neighborhood ''V'' of ''f''(''x''), there is a neighborhood ''U'' of ''x'' such that ''f''(''U'') ⊆ ''V'']]
The translation in the language of neighborhoods of the [[(ε, δ)-definition of limit|(ε, δ)-definition of continuity]] leads to the following definition of the continuity at a point:
{{Quote frame|A function &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if for any neighborhood {{mvar|V}} of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; in {{mvar|Y}}, there is a neighborhood {{mvar|U}} of {{mvar|x}} such that {{math|1=''f''(''U'') ⊆ ''V''}}.}}

This definition is equivalent to the same statement with neighborhoods restricted to open neighborhoods and can be restated in several ways by using [[preimage]]s rather than images.

Also, as every set that contains a neighborhood is also a neighborhood, and &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is the largest subset {{mvar|U}} of {{mvar|X}} such that {{math|''f''(''U'') ⊆ ''V''}}, this definition may be simplified into:
{{Quote frame|A function &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at a point &lt;math&gt;x\in X&lt;/math&gt; if and only if &lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(V)&lt;/math&gt; is a neighborhood of {{mvar|x}} for every neighborhood {{mvar|V}} of &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; in {{mvar|Y}}.}}

As an open set is a set that is a neighborhood of all its points, a function &lt;math&gt;f:X\rightarrow Y&lt;/math&gt; is continuous at every point of {{mvar|''X''}} if and only if it is a continuous function.

If ''X'' and ''Y'' are metric spaces, it is equivalent to consider the [[neighborhood system]] of [[open ball]]s centered at ''x'' and ''f''(''x'') instead of all neighborhoods. This gives back the above δ-ε definition of continuity in the context of metric spaces.  In general topological spaces, there is no notion of nearness or distance. If however the target space is a [[Hausdorff space]], it is still true that ''f'' is continuous at ''a'' if and only if the limit of ''f'' as ''x'' approaches ''a'' is ''f''(''a''). At an isolated point, every function is continuous.

===Alternative definitions===
Several [[Characterizations of the category of topological spaces|equivalent definitions for a topological structure]] exist and thus there are several equivalent ways to define a continuous function.

====Sequences and nets {{anchor|Heine definition of continuity}}====
In several contexts, the topology of a space is conveniently  specified in terms of [[limit points]].  In many instances, this is accomplished by specifying when a point is the [[limit of a sequence]], but for some spaces that are too large in some sense, one specifies also when a point is the limit of more general sets of points indexed by a [[directed set]], known as [[net (mathematics)|nets]].  A function is (Heine-)continuous only if it takes limits of sequences to limits of sequences.  In the former case, preservation of limits is also sufficient; in the latter, a function may preserve all limits of sequences yet still fail to be continuous, and preservation of nets is a necessary and sufficient condition.

In detail, a function ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' is '''sequentially continuous''' if whenever a sequence (''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;) in ''X'' converges to a limit ''x'', the sequence (''f''(''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;)) converges to ''f''(''x'').  Thus sequentially continuous functions "preserve sequential limits".  Every continuous function is sequentially continuous.  If ''X'' is a [[first-countable space]] and [[Axiom of countable choice|countable choice]] holds, then the converse also holds: any function preserving sequential limits is continuous.  In particular, if ''X'' is a metric space, sequential continuity and continuity are equivalent.  For non first-countable spaces, sequential continuity might be strictly weaker than continuity. (The spaces for which the two properties are equivalent are called [[sequential space]]s.) This motivates the consideration of nets instead of sequences in general topological spaces.  Continuous functions preserve limits of nets, and in fact this property characterizes continuous functions.

====Closure operator definition====
Instead of specifying the open subsets of a topological space, the topology can also be determined by a [[Kuratowski closure operator|closure operator]] (denoted cl) which assigns to any subset ''A'' ⊆ ''X'' its [[closure (topology)|closure]], or an [[interior operator]] (denoted int), which assigns to any subset ''A'' of ''X'' its [[interior (topology)|interior]]. In these terms, a function
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon (X,\mathrm{cl}) \to (X' ,\mathrm{cl}')&lt;/math&gt;
between topological spaces is continuous in the sense above if and only if for all subsets ''A'' of ''X''
:&lt;math&gt;f(\mathrm{cl}(A)) \subseteq \mathrm{cl}'(f(A)).&lt;/math&gt;
That is to say, given any element ''x'' of ''X'' that is in the closure of any subset ''A'', ''f''(''x'') belongs to the closure of ''f''(''A''). This is equivalent to the requirement that for all subsets ''A''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt; of ''X''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\mathrm{cl}'(A')) \supseteq \mathrm{cl}(f^{-1}(A')).&lt;/math&gt;
Moreover,
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon (X,\mathrm{int}) \to (X' ,\mathrm{int}') &lt;/math&gt;
is continuous if and only if
:&lt;math&gt;f^{-1}(\mathrm{int}'(A')) \subseteq \mathrm{int}(f^{-1}(A'))&lt;/math&gt;
for any subset ''A''' of ''Y''.

===Properties===
If ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' and ''g'': ''Y'' → ''Z'' are continuous, then so is the composition ''g'' ∘ ''f'': ''X'' → ''Z''. If ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' is continuous and
* ''X'' is [[Compact space|compact]], then ''f''(''X'') is compact.
* ''X'' is [[Connected space|connected]], then ''f''(''X'') is connected.
* ''X'' is [[path-connected]], then ''f''(''X'') is path-connected.
* ''X'' is [[Lindelöf space|Lindelöf]], then ''f''(''X'') is Lindelöf.
* ''X'' is [[separable space|separable]], then ''f''(''X'') is separable.

The possible topologies on a fixed set ''X'' are [[partial ordering|partially ordered]]: a topology τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is said to be [[comparison of topologies|coarser]] than another topology τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (notation: τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) if every open subset with respect to τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; is also open with respect to τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Then, the [[identity function|identity map]]
:id&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt;: (''X'', τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) → (''X'', τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)
is continuous if and only if τ&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ⊆ τ&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (see also [[comparison of topologies]]). More generally, a continuous function
:&lt;math&gt;(X, \tau_X) \rightarrow (Y, \tau_Y)&lt;/math&gt;
stays continuous if the topology τ&lt;sub&gt;''Y''&lt;/sub&gt; is replaced by a [[Comparison of topologies|coarser topology]] and/or τ&lt;sub&gt;''X''&lt;/sub&gt; is replaced by a [[Comparison of topologies|finer topology]].

===Homeomorphisms===
Symmetric to the concept of a continuous map is an [[open map]], for which ''images'' of open sets are open. In fact, if an open map ''f'' has an [[inverse function]], that inverse is continuous, and if a continuous map ''g'' has an inverse, that inverse is open. Given a [[bijective]] function ''f'' between two topological spaces, the inverse function ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; need not be continuous. A bijective continuous function with continuous inverse function is called a ''[[homeomorphism]]''.

If a continuous bijection has as its [[Domain of a function|domain]] a [[compact space]] and its [[codomain]] is [[Hausdorff space|Hausdorff]], then it is a homeomorphism.

===Defining topologies via continuous functions===
Given a function
:&lt;math&gt;f\colon X \rightarrow S, &lt;/math&gt;
where ''X'' is a topological space and ''S'' is a set (without a specified topology), the [[final topology]] on ''S'' is defined by letting the open sets of ''S'' be those subsets ''A'' of ''S'' for which ''f''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''A'') is open in ''X''. If ''S'' has an existing topology, ''f'' is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is [[Comparison of topologies|coarser]] than the final topology on ''S''.  Thus the final topology can be characterized as the finest topology on ''S'' that makes ''f'' continuous.  If ''f'' is [[surjective]], this topology is canonically identified with the [[quotient topology]] under the [[equivalence relation]] defined by ''f''.

Dually, for a function ''f'' from a set ''S'' to a topological space ''X'', the [[initial topology]] on ''S'' is defined by designating as an open set every subset ''A'' of ''S'' such that &lt;math&gt;A = f^{-1}(U)&lt;/math&gt; for some open subset ''U'' of ''X''.  If ''S'' has an existing topology, ''f'' is continuous with respect to this topology if and only if the existing topology is finer than the initial topology on ''S''.  Thus the initial topology can be characterized as the coarsest topology on ''S'' that makes ''f'' continuous.  If ''f'' is injective, this topology is canonically identified with the [[subspace topology]] of ''S'', viewed as a subset of ''X''.

A topology on a set ''S'' is uniquely determined by the class of all continuous functions &lt;math&gt;S \rightarrow X&lt;/math&gt; into all topological spaces ''X''. [[Duality (mathematics)|Dually]], a similar idea can be applied to maps &lt;math&gt;X \rightarrow S.&lt;/math&gt;

==Related notions==

Various other mathematical domains use the concept of continuity in different, but related meanings. For example, in [[order theory]], an order-preserving function ''f'': ''X'' → ''Y'' between particular types of [[partially ordered set]]s ''X'' and ''Y'' is [[Scott continuity|continuous]] if for each directed subset ''A'' of ''X'', we have sup(''f''(''A'')) = ''f''(sup(''A'')). Here sup is the [[supremum]] with respect to the orderings in ''X'' and ''Y'', respectively. This notion of continuity is the same as topological continuity when the partially ordered sets are given the [[Scott topology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Goubault-Larrecq |first=Jean |title=Non-Hausdorff Topology and Domain Theory: Selected Topics in Point-Set Topology |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |year=2013 |ISBN=1107034132}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Gierz |first1=G. |last2=Hofmann |first2=K.

In [[category theory]], a [[functor]]
:&lt;math&gt;F\colon \mathcal C \rightarrow \mathcal D&lt;/math&gt;
between two [[category (mathematics)|categories]] is called ''[[continuous functor|continuous]]'', if it commutes with small [[limit (category theory)|limits]]. That is to say,
:&lt;math&gt;\varprojlim_{i \in I} F(C_i) \cong F \left(\varprojlim_{i \in I} C_i \right)&lt;/math&gt;
for any small (i.e., indexed by a set ''I'', as opposed to a [[class (mathematics)|class]]) diagram of objects in &lt;math&gt;\mathcal C&lt;/math&gt;.

In [[first-order logic]] with equality, counting quantifiers can be defined in terms of ordinary quantifiers, so in this context they are a notational shorthand.
However, they are interesting in the context of logics such as [[two-variable logic with counting]] that restrict the number of variables in formulas.
Also, generalized counting quantifiers that say "there exists infinitely many" are not expressible using a finite number of formulas in first-order logic.

Let ''n'' = ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; … ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; where the ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct primes, then φ(''n'') = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; − 1)(''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; − 1)...(''p''&lt;sub&gt;''k''&lt;/sub&gt; – 1). If no ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; divides any (''p''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; – 1), then ''n'' and φ(''n'') have no common (prime) divisor, and ''n'' is cyclic.

The first cyclic numbers are 1, 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 23, 29, 31, 33, 35, 37, 41, 43, 47, 51, 53, 59, 61, 65, 67, 69, 71, 73, 77, 79, 83, 85, 87, 89, 91, 95, 97, 101, 103, 107, 109, 113, 115, 119, 123, 127, 131, 133, 137, 139, 141, 143, 145, 149, ... {{OEIS|A003277}}.

A '''differentiable neural computer''' ('''DNC''') is a [[recurrent neural network|recurrent]] [[artificial neural network]] architecture with an [[autoassociative memory]]. The model was published in 2016 by [[Alex Graves (computer scientist)|Alex Graves]] et al. of [[DeepMind]].&lt;ref name="DNCnature2016"/&gt;

== Applications ==

So far, DNCs have only been demonstrated to handle relatively simple tasks, which could have been easily solved using conventional computer programming decades ago. But DNCs don't need to be programmed for each problem they are applied to, but can instead be trained. This attention span allows the user to feed complex [[data structure]]s such as [[Graph (abstract data type)|graphs]] sequentially, and recall them during later use. Furthermore, they can learn some aspects of [[Symbolic Reasoning|symbolic reasoning]] and apply it to the use of working memory. Some experts see promise that they can be trained to perform complex, structured tasks&lt;ref name="DNCnature2016"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Graves|first=Alex|last2=Wayne|first2=Greg|last3=Reynolds|first3=Malcolm|last4=Harley|first4=Tim|last5=Danihelka|first5=Ivo|last6=Grabska-Barwińska|first6=Agnieszka|last7=Colmenarejo|first7=Sergio Gómez|last8=Grefenstette|first8=Edward|last9=Ramalho|first9=Tiago|date=2016-10-12|title=Hybrid computing using a neural network with dynamic external memory|url=http://www.nature.com/articles/nature20101.epdf?author_access_token=ImTXBI8aWbYxYQ51Plys8NRgN0jAjWel9jnR3ZoTv0MggmpDmwljGswxVdeocYSurJ3hxupzWuRNeGvvXnoO8o4jTJcnAyhGuZzXJ1GEaD-Z7E6X_a9R-xqJ9TfJWBqz|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=538|issue=7626|doi=10.1038/nature20101|issn=1476-4687|pages=471–476|pmid=27732574|bibcode=2016Natur.538..471G}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://deepmind.com/blog/differentiable-neural-computers/|title=Differentiable neural computers {{!}} DeepMind|website=DeepMind|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and address big-data applications that require some sort of rational reasoning, such as generating video commentaries or semantic text analysis.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jaeger|first=Herbert|date=2016-10-12|title=Artificial intelligence: Deep neural reasoning|url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/vaop/ncurrent/full/nature19477.html|journal=Nature|language=en|volume=538|issue=7626|doi=10.1038/nature19477|issn=1476-4687|pages=467–468|pmid=27732576|bibcode=2016Natur.538..467J}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DNC can be trained to navigate a variety of [[rapid transit]] systems, and then what the DNC learns can be applied, for example, to get around on the [[London Underground]]. A neural network without memory would typically have to learn about each different transit system from scratch. On graph traversal and sequence-processing tasks with [[supervised learning]], DNCs performed better than alternatives such as [[long short-term memory]] or a neural turing machine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; With a [[reinforcement learning]] approach to a block puzzle problem inspired by [[SHRDLU]], DNC was trained via curriculum learning, and learned to make a [[Automated planning and scheduling|plan]]. It performed better than a traditional [[recurrent neural network]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Architecture ==

[[File:Differentiable Neural Computer.png|thumb|DNC system diagram.]]

DNC networks were introduced as an extension of the [[Neural Turing Machine]] (NTM), with the addition of memory attention mechanisms that control where the memory is stored, and temporal attention that records the order of events. This structure allows DNCs to be more robust and abstract than a NTM, and still perform tasks that have longer-term dependencies than some of its predecessors such as the [[Long short-term memory|LSTM]] network. The memory, which is simply a matrix, can be allocated dynamically and accessed indefinitely. The DNC is [[Differentiable function|differentiable]] end-to-end (each subcomponent of the model is differentiable, therefore so is the whole model). This makes it possible to optimize them efficiently using [[gradient descent]]. It learns how to store and retrieve the information such that it satisfies the task execution.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wired.co.uk/article/deepmind-ai-tube-london-underground|title=DeepMind's AI learned to ride the London Underground using human-like reason and memory|last=Burgess|first=Matt|newspaper=WIRED UK|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.pcmag.com/news/348701/deepmind-ai-learns-to-navigate-london-tube|title=DeepMind AI 'Learns' to Navigate London Tube|newspaper=PCMAG|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://techcrunch.com/2016/10/13/__trashed-2/|title=DeepMind's differentiable neural computer helps you navigate the subway with its memory|last=Mannes|first=John|website=TechCrunch|access-date=2016-10-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The DNC model is similar to the [[Von Neumann architecture]], and because of the resizability of memory, it is [[Turing complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=steioHoiEms?t=721|title=RNN Symposium 2016: Alex Graves - Differentiable Neural Computer}}&lt;/ref&gt; Differentiable Neural Computers were inspired by the mammalian [[hippocampus]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.i-programmer.info/news/105-artificial-intelligence/10174-deepminds-differential-nn-thinks-deeply.html|title=DeepMind's Differentiable Neural Network Thinks Deeply|last=James|first=Mike|date=|website=www.i-programmer.info|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Extensions ===
Refinements to the model have been published since the original paper's release. Sparse memory addressing results in a time and space complexity reduction of thousands of times. This can be achieved by using an approximate nearest neighbors algorithm, such as [[Locality-sensitive hashing]], or a random [[k-d tree]] like the Fast Library for Approximate Nearest Neighbors from [[University of British Columbia|UBC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1610.09027|title=Scaling Memory-Augmented Neural Networks with Sparse Reads and Writes|author1=Jack W Rae|author2=Jonathan J Hunt|last3=Harley|first3=Tim|last4=Danihelka|first4=Ivo|last5=Senior|first5=Andrew|last6=Wayne|first6=Greg|last7=Graves|first7=Alex|author8=Timothy P Lillicrap|class=cs.LG|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adding Adaptive Computation Time (ACT) separates computation time from data time, which uses the fact that problem length and problem difficulty are not always the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1603.08983|title=Adaptive Computation Time for Recurrent Neural Networks|last1=Graves|first1=Alex|class=cs.NE|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Training using synthetic gradients performs considerably better than [[Backpropagation through time]] (BPTT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1608.05343|title=Decoupled Neural Interfaces using Synthetic Gradients|last1=Jaderberg|first1=Max|author2=Wojciech Marian Czarnecki|last3=Osindero|first3=Simon|last4=Vinyals|first4=Oriol|last5=Graves|first5=Alex|last6=Silver|first6=David|last7=Kavukcuoglu|first7=Koray|class=cs.LG|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another training improvement in terms of robustness can be achieved with use of DNA normalization and a Bypass Dropout as regularization. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite arxiv|eprint=1807.02658|title=Robust and Scalable Differentiable Neural Computer for Question Answering|last1=Franke|first1=Jörg|last2=Niehues|first2=Jan|last3=Waibel|first3=Alex|class=cs.CL|year=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Emil Artin''' ({{IPA-de|ˈaɐ̯tiːn|lang}}; March 3, 1898 – December 20, 1962) was an Austrian [[mathematician]] of Armenian descent. Artin was one of the leading mathematicians of the twentieth century. He is best known for his work on [[algebraic number theory]], contributing largely to [[class field theory]] and a new construction of [[L-function]]s. He also contributed to the pure theories of rings, groups and fields.

==Early life and education==

===Parents===
Emil Artin was born in Vienna to parents Emma Maria, née Laura (stage name Clarus), a [[soubrette]] on the operetta stages of [[Austria]] and [[Germany]], and Emil Hadochadus Maria Artin,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} Austrian-born of mixed [[Austrians|Austrian]] and [[Armenian people|Armenian]] descent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://reporter.am/index.cfm?objectid=59BE5ED5-E7DA-11E0-8E3F0003FF3452C2 Armenia honors mathematician Dmitry Mirimanoff] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121124044728/http://reporter.am/index.cfm?objectid=59BE5ED5-E7DA-11E0-8E3F0003FF3452C2 |date=2012-11-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ben Yandell, [https://books.google.com/books?id=XQXoG4pL1-kC&amp;printsec= The honors class: Hilbert’s problems and their solvers], A K Peters, Ltd., 2002, {{ISBN|1568812167}}, 9781568812168&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AMS"&gt;[http://www.ams.org/notices/200204/comm-steeleprz.pdf Notices of the AMS. Vol. 49, # 4, April 2002, pp. 469–470]&lt;/ref&gt; Several documents, including Emil’s birth certificate,{{Citation needed|date=November 2010}} list the father’s occupation as “opera singer” though others list it as “art dealer.” It seems at least plausible that he and Emma had met as colleagues in the theater. They were married in St. Stephen's Parish on July 24, 1895.

===Early education===
Artin entered school in September 1904, presumably in Vienna. By then, his father was already suffering symptoms of advanced [[syphilis]], among them increasing mental instability, and was eventually institutionalized at the recently established (and imperially sponsored) [[insane asylum]] at Mauer Öhling, 125 kilometers west of Vienna.  It is notable that neither wife nor child contracted this highly infectious disease. Artin's father died there July 20, 1906.  Young Artin was eight.

On July 15, 1907, Artin’s mother remarried to a man named Rudolf Hübner: a prosperous manufacturing entrepreneur in the German-speaking city then called Reichenberg, Bohemia (currently known as [[Liberec]], in the Czech Republic). Documentary evidence suggests that Emma had already been a resident in Reichenberg the previous year, and in deference to her new husband, she had abandoned her vocal career. Hübner deemed a life in the theater unseemly unfit for the wife of a man of his position.

In September, 1907, Artin entered the Volksschule in Strobnitz, a small town in southern Czechoslovakia near the Austrian border. For that year, he lived away from home, boarding on a local farm.  The following year, he returned to the home of his mother and stepfather, and entered the Realschule in Reichenberg, where he pursued his secondary education until June, 1916.

In Reichenberg, Artin formed a lifelong friendship with a young neighbor, Arthur Baer, who became an astronomer, teaching for many years at Cambridge University.  Astronomy was an interest the two boys shared already at this time. They each had telescopes. They also rigged a telegraph between their houses, over which once Baer excitedly reported to his friend an astronomical discovery he thought he had made—perhaps a supernova, he thought—and told Artin where in the sky to look. Artin tapped back the terse reply “A-N-D-R-O-M-E-D-A N-E-B-E-L.” ([[Andromeda Galaxy|Andromeda nebula]])

Artin’s academic performance in the first years at the Realschule was spotty. Up to the end of the 1911–1912 school year, for instance, his grade in mathematics was merely “genügend,” (satisfactory). Of his mathematical inclinations at this early period he later wrote, “Meine eigene Vorliebe zur Mathematik zeigte sich erst im sechzehnten Lebensjahr, während vorher von irgendeiner Anlage dazu überhaupt nicht die Rede sein konnte.” (“My own predilection for mathematics manifested itself only in my sixteenth year; before that, one could certainly not speak of any particular aptitude for it.”) His grade in French for 1912 was actually “nicht genügend” (unsatisfactory). He did rather better work in physics and chemistry. But from 1910 to 1912, his grade for “Comportment” was “nicht genügend.”

Artin spent the school year 1912–1913 away from home, in [[France]], a period he spoke of later as one of the happiest of his life. He lived that year with the family of Edmond Fritz, in the vicinity of Paris, and attended a school there. When he returned from France to Reichenberg, his academic work markedly improved, and he began consistently receiving grades of “gut” or “sehr gut” (good or very good) in virtually all subjects—including French and “Comportment.” By the time he completed studies at the Realschule in June, 1916, he was awarded the Reifezeugnis (diploma—not to be confused with the Abitur) that affirmed him “reif mit Auszeichnung” (qualified with distinction) for graduation to a technical university.

===University education===
Now that it was time to move on to university studies, Artin was no doubt content but to leave Reichenberg, for relations with his stepfather were clouded. According to him, Hübner reproached him “day and night” with being a financial burden, and even when Artin became a university lecturer and then a professor, Hübner deprecated his academic career as self-indulgent and belittled its paltry emolument.

In October, 1916, Artin matriculated at the [[University of Vienna]], having focused by now on mathematics. He studied there with [[Philipp Furtwängler]], and also took courses in [[astrophysics]] and [[Latin]].

Studies at Vienna were interrupted when Artin was drafted in June, 1918 into the Austrian army (his Army photo ID is dated July 1, 1918). Assigned to the K.u. K. 44th Infantry Regiment, he was stationed northwest of Venice at Primolano, on the [[Italy|Italian]] front in the foothills of the [[Dolomites]].  To his great relief, Artin managed to avoid combat by volunteering for service as a translator—his ignorance of Italian notwithstanding. He did know French, of course, and some Latin, was generally a quick study, and was motivated by a highly rational fear in a theater of that war that had often proven a meat-grinder. In his scramble to learn at least some Italian, Artin had recourse to an encyclopedia, which he once consulted for help in dealing with the cockroaches that infested the Austrian barracks. At some length, the article described a variety of technical methods, concluding finally with—Artin laughingly recalled in later years—“la caccia diretta" ("the direct hunt"). Indeed, “la caccia diretta” was the straightforward method he and his fellow infantrymen adopted.

Artin survived both war and vermin on the Italian front, and returned late in 1918 to the University of Vienna, where he remained through Easter of the following year.

By June 1919, he had moved to Leipzig and matriculated at the University there as a "Class 2 Auditor" ("Hörer zweiter Ordnung").  Late the same year, Artin undertook the formality of standing for a qualifying examination by an academic board of the Oberrealschule in [[Leipzig]], which he passed with the grade of “gut” (good), receiving for the second time the Reifezeugnis (diploma attesting the equivalence of satisfactory completion of 6 years at a Realschule). How this Leipzig Reifezeugnis differed technically from the one he had been granted at Reichenberg is unclear from the document, but it apparently qualified him for regular matriculation as a student at the University, which normally required the Abitur.

From 1919 to June 1921, Artin pursued mostly mathematical studies at Leipzig.  His principal teacher and dissertation advisor was [[Gustav Herglotz]]. Additionally, Artin took courses in chemistry and various fields of [[physics]], including [[mechanics]], [[atomic theory]], [[quantum mechanics|quantum theory]], [[Maxwell's equations|Maxwellian theory]], [[radioactivity]], and [[astrophysics]]. In June, 1921 he was awarded the Doctor of Philosophy degree, based on his “excellent” dissertation, “Quadratische Körper im Gebiete der höheren Kongruenzen“ ("On the Arithmetic of Quadratic Function Fields over Finite Fields"), and the oral examination which—his diploma affirms—he had passed three days earlier “with extraordinary success.”

In the fall of 1921, Artin moved to the [[University of Göttingen]], considered the "Mecca" of mathematics at the time, where he pursued one year of post-doctoral studies in mathematics and mathematical physics with [[Richard Courant]] and [[David Hilbert]]. While at Göttingen, he worked closely with [[Emmy Noether]] and [[Helmut Hasse]].

Aside from consistently good school grades in singing, the first documentary evidence of Artin’s deep and lifelong engagement with music comes from the year in Göttingen, where he was regularly invited to join in the chamber music sessions hosted by [[Richard Courant]]. He played all the keyboard instruments, and was an especially accomplished flautist, although it is not known exactly by what instruction he had achieved proficiency on these instruments. He became especially devoted to the music of [[Johann Sebastian Bach]].

==Career==

===Professorship at Hamburg===
Courant arranged for Artin to receive a stipend for the summer of 1922 in Göttingen, which occasioned his declining a position offered him at the [[University of Kiel]]. The following October, however, he accepted an equivalent position at [[Hamburg]], where in 1923, he completed the Habilitation thesis (required of aspirants to a professorship in Germany), and on July 24 advanced to the rank of [[Privatdozent]].

On April 1, 1925, Artin was promoted to Associate Professor (außerordentlicher Professor). In this year also, Artin applied for and was granted German citizenship. He was promoted to full Professor (ordentlicher Professor) on October 15, 1926.

Early in the summer of 1925, Artin attended the Congress of the Wandervogel youth movement at Wilhelmshausen near [[Kassel]] with the intention of gathering a congenial group to undertake a trek through [[Iceland]] later that summer. Iceland (before the transforming presence of American and British forces stationed there during [[World War II]]) was still a primitive country in 1925, with a thinly scattered population and little transportation infrastructure.  Artin succeeded in finding six young men to join him in this adventure. In the second half of August, 1925, the group set out by steamer from Hamburg, first to [[Norway]], where they boarded a second steamer that took them to Iceland, stopping at several of the small east fjord ports before arriving at their destination, [[Húsavík]] in the north of the island.  Here the Wandervogel group disembarked, their initial goal, trekking down the Laxá River to Lake Mývatn.  They made a circuit of the large, irregular lake, staying in farm houses, barns, and occasionally a tent as they went. When they slept in barns, it was often on piles of wet straw or hay. On those lucky occasions when they slept in beds, it could be nearly as damp on account of the rain trickling through the sod roofs. The tent leaked as well.

Artin kept a meticulous journal of this trip, making daily entries in a neat, minuscule hand. He and several of the young men had brought cameras, so that the trek is documented also by nearly 200 small photographs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Odefey, Alexander |year=2011 |title=Emil Artins Islandreise im Sommer 1925 |journal=Mitt. Math. Ges. Hamb.  |volume=30 |pages=127–180}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Artin’s journal attests to his overarching interest in the geology of this mid-Atlantic island, situated over the boundary of two tectonic plates whose shifting relation makes it geologically hyperactive.

In keeping with the Wandervogel ethos, Artin and his companions carried music with them wherever they visited. The young men had packed guitars and violins, and Artin played the harmoniums common in the isolated farmsteads where they found lodging. The group regularly entertained their Icelandic hosts, not in full exchange for board and lodging, to be sure, but for goodwill certainly, and sometimes for a little extra on their plates, or a modestly discounted tariff.

From Lake Mývatn, Artin and his companions headed west towards Akureyri, passing the large waterfall Goðafoss on the way. From Akureyri, they trekked west down the Öxnadalur (Ox Valley) intending to rent pack horses and cross the high and barren interior by foot to [[Reykjavík]]. By the time they reached the lower end of Skagafjörður, however, they were persuaded by a local farmer from whom they had hoped to rent the horses that a cross-country trek was by then impracticable; with the approach of winter, highland routes were already snow-bound and impassable.  Instead of turning south, then, they turned north to Siglufjörður, where they boarded another steamer that took them around the western peninsula and down the coast to Reykjavík.  From Reykjavík, they returned via Norway to Hamburg. By Artin's calculation the distance they had covered on foot through Iceland totaled 450 kilometers.

Early in 1926, the [[University of Münster]] offered Artin a professorial position; however, Hamburg matched the offer financially, and (as noted above) promoted him to full professor, making him (along with his young colleague Helmut Hasse) one of the two youngest professors of mathematics in Germany.

It was in this period that he acquired his lifelong nickname, “Ma,” short for mathematics, which he came to prefer to his given name, and which virtually everyone who knew him well used. Although the nickname might seem to imply a narrow intellectual focus, quite the reverse was true of Artin. Even his teaching at the University of Hamburg went beyond the strict boundaries of mathematics to include mechanics and relativity theory. He kept up on a serious level with advances in astronomy, chemistry and biology (he owned and used a fine microscope), and the circle of his friends in Hamburg attests to the catholicity of his interests. It included the painter Heinrich Stegemann, and the author and organ-builder Hans Henny Jahn. Stegemann was a particularly close friend, and made portraits of Artin, his wife [[Natascha Artin Brunswick | Natascha]], and their two Hamburg-born children. Music continued to play a central role in his life; he acquired a Neupert double manual [[harpsichord]], and a [[clavichord]] made by the Hamburg builder Walter Ebeloe, as well as a silver [[flute]] made in Hamburg by  G. Urban. Chamber music gatherings became a regular event at the Artin apartment as they had been at the Courants in Göttingen.

On August 15, 1929, Artin married Natalia Naumovna Jasny (Natascha), a young [[Russians|Russian]] émigré who had been a student in several of his classes. One of their shared interests was photography, and when Artin bought a [[Leica Camera|Leica]] for their joint use (a Leica A, the first commercial model of this legendary camera), Natascha began chronicling the life of the family, as well as the city of Hamburg. For the next decade, she made a series of artful and expressive portraits of Artin that remain by far the best images of him taken at any age. Artin, in turn, took many fine and evocative portraits of Natascha.  Lacking access to a professional darkroom, their films and prints had to be developed in a makeshift darkroom set up each time (and then dismantled again) in the small bathroom of whatever apartment they were occupying.  The makeshift darkroom notwithstanding, the high artistic level of the resulting photographic prints is attested to by the exhibit of Natascha’s photographs mounted in 2001 by the [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg]], and its accompanying catalogue, “Hamburg—Wie Ich Es Sah.”

In 1930, Artin was offered a professorship at [[ETH Zurich|ETH (Eidgenössische Technische Hochschule) in Zürich]], to replace [[Hermann Weyl]], who had moved to Göttingen. He chose to remain at Hamburg, however.  Two years later, in 1932, for contributions leading to the advancement of mathematics, Artin was honored—jointly with [[Emmy Noether]]—with the [[Ackermann–Teubner Memorial Award]], which carried a grant of 500 marks.

===Nazi period===
In January 1933, Natascha gave birth to their first child, Karin. A year and a half later, in the summer of 1934, son [[Michael Artin|Michael]] was born. The political climate at Hamburg was not so poisonous as that at Göttingen, where by 1935 the mathematics department had been purged of [[Jewish]] and dissident professors. Still, Artin's situation became increasingly precarious, not only because Natascha was half Jewish, but also because Artin made no secret of his distaste for the Hitler regime.  At one point, [[Wilhelm Blaschke]], by then a [[Nazi Party]] member, but nonetheless solicitous of the Artins’ well-being, warned Artin discreetly to close his classroom door so his frankly anti-Nazi comments could not be heard by passersby in the hallway.

Natascha recalled going down to the newsstand on the corner one day and being warned in hushed tones by the man from whom she and Artin bought their paper that a man had daily been watching their apartment from across the street. Once tipped off, she and Artin became very aware of the watcher (Natascha liked to refer to him as their “spy”), and even rather enjoyed the idea of his being forced to follow them on the long walks they loved taking in the afternoons to a café far out in the countryside.

Toying with their watcher on a fine autumn afternoon was one thing, but the atmosphere was in fact growing inexorably serious. Natascha’s Jewish father and her sister, seeing the handwriting on the wall, had already left for the U.S. in the summer of 1933. As half-Jewish, Natascha’s status was, if not ultimately quite hopeless, certainly not good. Hasse, like Blaschke a nationalistic supporter of the regime, had applied for Party membership, but was nonetheless no anti-Semite. Besides he was a long-time friend and colleague of Artin's. He suggested that the two Artin children—only one quarter Jewish, or in Nazi terminology, “[[Mischling]]e zweiten Grades”—might, if a few strategic strings could be pulled, be officially “aryanized.” Hasse offered to exert his influence with the Ministry of Education (Kultur- und Schulbehörde, Hochschulwesen), and Artin—not daring to leave any stone unturned, especially with respect to the safety of his children—went along with this effort. He asked his father-in-law, by then resident in [[Washington D.C.]], to draft and have notarized an affidavit attesting to the Christian lineage of his late wife, Natascha’s mother. Artin submitted this affidavit to the Ministry of Education, but to no avail.

By this time, to be precise, on July 15, 1937, because of Natascha’s status as “Mischling ersten Grades,” Artin had lost his post at the University—technically, compelled into early retirement—on the grounds of paragraph 6 of the Act to Restore the Professional Civil Service (Gesetz zur Wiederherstellung des Berufsbeamtentums) of April 7, 1933. Ironically, he had applied only some months earlier, on February 8, 1937, for a leave of absence from the University in order to accept a position offered him at Stanford.  On March 15, 1937, the response had come back denying his application for leave on the grounds that his services to the University were indispensable (“Da die Tätigkeit des Professors Dr. Artin an der Universität Hamburg nicht entbehrt werden kann. . .”).

By July, when he was summarily “retired,” (“in Ruhestand versetzt”) the position at [[Stanford University]] had been filled. However, through the efforts of [[Richard Courant]] (by then at [[New York University]]), and Solomon Lefschetz at [[Princeton University]], a position was found for him at the [[University of Notre Dame]] in [[South Bend, Indiana]].

===Emigration to the U.S.===
The family must have worked feverishly to prepare for emigration to the United States, for this entailed among other things packing their entire household for shipment.  Since German law forbade emigrants taking more than a token sum of money out of the country, the Artins sank all the funds at their disposal into shipping their entire household, from beds, tables, chairs and double-manual harpsichord down to the last kitchen knife, cucumber slicer, and potato masher to their new home. This is why each of their residences in the United States bore such a striking resemblance to the rooms photographed so beautifully by Natascha in their Hamburg apartment (see Natascha A. Brunswick, “Hamburg:  Wie Ich Es Sah,” Dokumente der Photographie 6, [[Museum für Kunst und Gewerbe Hamburg]], 2001, pp.&amp;nbsp;48–53) .

On the morning they were to board the [[Hamburg-Amerika]] line ship in [[Bremerhaven]], October 21, 1937, daughter Karin woke with a high temperature. Terrified that should this opportunity be missed, the window of escape from [[Nazi Germany]] might close forever, Artin and Natascha chose to risk somehow getting Karin past emigration and customs officials without their noticing her condition. They managed to conceal Karin’s feverish state, and without incident boarded the ship, as many left behind were tragically never able to do. When they landed a week later at [[Hoboken, New Jersey]], Richard Courant and Natascha’s father, the Russian agronomist Naum Jasny (then working for the U.S. Department of Agriculture) were on the dock to welcome the family to the United States.

===Bloomington years===
It was early November, 1937 by the time they arrived in South Bend, where Artin joined the faculty at Notre Dame, and taught for the rest of that academic year.  He was offered a permanent position the following year 170 miles to the south at Indiana University, in Bloomington. Shortly after the family resettled there, a second son, Thomas, was born on November 12, 1938.

After moving to Bloomington, Artin quickly acquired a piano, and soon after that a [[Hammond Organ]], a recently invented electronic instrument that simulated the sound of a pipe organ. He wanted this instrument in order primarily to play the works of J. S. Bach, and because the pedal set that came with the production model had a range of only two octaves (not quite wide enough for all the Bach pieces), he set about extending its range. Music was a constant presence in the Artin household.  Karin played the cello, and then the piano as well, and Michael played the violin. As in Hamburg, the Artin living room was regularly the venue for amateur chamber music performances.

The circle of the Artins’ University friends reflected Artin's wide cultural and intellectual interests. Notable among them were [[Alfred Kinsey]] and his wife of the Psychology Department, as well as prominent members of the Fine Arts, Art History, Anthropology, German Literature, and Music Departments. For several summer semesters, Artin accepted teaching positions at other universities, viz., Stanford in 1939 and 1940, The [[University of Michigan]] at Ann Arbor in 1941 and 1951, and The University of Colorado, in Boulder, in 1953. On each of these occasions, the family accompanied him.

Artin insisted that only German be spoken in the house. Even Tom, born in the U.S., spoke German as his  first language, acquiring English only from his siblings and his playmates in the neighborhood; for the first four or five years of his life, he spoke English with a pronounced German accent. Consistent with his program of maintaining the family’s German cultural heritage, Artin gave high priority to regularly reading German literature aloud to the children.  The text was frequently from Goethe's autobiographical "Dichtung und Wahrheit," or his poems, "Erlkönig," for instance.  Occasionally, he would read from an English text.  Favorites were [[Mark Twain]]'s "Tom Sawyer," [[Charles Dickens]]’s “[[A Christmas Carol]],” and [[Oscar Wilde]]’s “The Canterville Ghost.”  For the Artin children, these readings replaced radio entertainment, which was strictly banned from the house.  There was a radio, but (with the notable exception of Sunday morning broadcasts by [[E. Power Biggs]] from the organ at the Busch-Reisinger Museum in Cambridge, to which Artin and Natascha listened still lounging in bed) it was switched on only to hear news of the war.  Similarly, the Artin household would never in years to come harbor a television set.  Once the war had ended, the radio was retired to the rear of a dark closet.

As German citizens, Artin and Natascha were technically classified as [[enemy aliens]] for the duration of the war. On April 12, 1945, with the end of the war in Europe only weeks away, they applied for naturalization as American citizens. American citizenship was granted them on February 7, 1946.

On the orders of a Hamburg doctor whom he had consulted about a chronic cough, Artin had given up smoking years before. He had vowed not to smoke so long as [[Adolf Hitler]] remained in power.  On May 8, 1945, at the news of [[Surrender of Germany|Germany’s surrender]] and the fall of the Third Reich, Natascha made the mistake of reminding him of this vow, and in lieu of a champagne toast, he indulged in what was intended to be the smoking of a single, celebratory cigarette. Unfortunately, the single cigarette led to a second, and another after that.  Artin returned to heavy smoking for the rest of his life.

===Princeton years===
If Göttingen had been the “Mecca” of mathematics in the 1920s and early ‘30s, Princeton, following the decimation of German mathematics under the Nazis, had become the center of the mathematical world in the 1940s. In April, 1946, Artin was appointed Professor at Princeton, at a yearly salary of $8,000. The family moved there in the fall of 1946.

Notable among his graduate students at Princeton are Serge Lang, John Tate, Harold N. Shapiro, and Timothy O’Meara. Emil chose also to teach the honors section of Freshman calculus each year.  He was renowned for the elegance of his teaching.  Frei and Roquette write that Artin’s “main medium of communication was teaching and conversation:  in groups, seminars and in smaller circles.  We have many statements of people near to him describing his unpretentious way of communicating with everybody, demanding quick grasp of the essentials but never tired of explaining the necessary. He was open to all kinds of suggestions, and distributed joyfully what he knew.  He liked to teach, also to young students, and his excellent lectures, always well prepared but without written notes, were hailed for their clarity and beauty.”  (Emil Artin and Helmut Hasse:  Their Correspondence 1923–1934, Introduction.)

Whenever he was asked whether mathematics was a science, Artin would reply unhesitatingly, “No. An art.” His elegant elaboration of this idea is often cited, and worth repeating here: “We all believe that mathematics is an art. The author of a book, the lecturer in a classroom tries to convey the structural beauty of mathematics to his readers, to his listeners.  In this attempt, he must always fail. Mathematics is logical to be sure, each conclusion is drawn from previously derived statements.  Yet the whole of it, the real piece of art, is not linear; worse than that, its perception should be instantaneous.  We have all experienced on some rare occasion the feeling of elation in realizing that we have enabled our listeners to see at a glance the whole architecture and all its ramifications.”

It has even been said—only half in jest—that his lectures could be too perfect, lulling a hearer into believing he had understood and assimilated an idea or a proof which, on waking the following day might seem as remote and chimerical as ever.

During the Princeton years, Artin built a {{convert|6|in|cm|adj=on}} reflecting telescope to plans he found in the magazine ''Sky and Telescope'', which he subscribed to. He spent weeks in the basement attempting to grind the mirror to specifications, without success, and his continued failure to get it right led to increasing frustration.  Then, in California to give a talk, he made a side trip to the Mt. Wilson Observatory, where he discussed his project with the astronomers. Whether it was their technical advice, or Natascha’s intuitive suggestion that it might be too cold in the basement, and that he should try the procedure upstairs in the warmth of his study (which he did), he completed the grinding of the mirror in a matter of days.  With this telescope, he surveyed the night skies over Princeton.

In September 1955, Artin accepted an invitation to visit [[Japan]]. From his letters, it is clear he was treated like royalty by the Japanese mathematical community, and was charmed by the country. He was interested in learning about the diverse threads of [[Buddhism]], and visiting its holy sites.  In a letter home he describes his visit to the temples at Nara. “Then we were driven to a place nearby, Horiuji [Horyu-ji] where a very beautiful Buddhist temple is. We were received by the abbot, and a priest translated into English. We obtained the first sensible explanation about modern Buddhism. The difficulty of obtaining such an explanation is enormous.  To begin with most Japanese do not know and do not understand our questions. All this is made more complicated by the fact that there are numerous sects and each one has another theory. Since you get your information only piece wise, you cannot put it together.  This results in an absurd picture. I am talking of the present day, not of its original form.”

His letter goes on to outline at length the general [[eschatological]] framework of Buddhist belief.  Then he adds, “By the way, a problem given by the [[Zen]]s for meditation is the following: If you clap your hands, does the sound come from the left hand or from the right?”

==Return to Hamburg and personal life==
The following year, Artin took a leave of absence to return to Germany for the first time since emigration, nearly twenty years earlier. He spent the fall semester at Göttingen, and the next at Hamburg.  For the Christmas holidays, he travelled to his birthplace, Vienna, to visit his mother, Vienna being a city he had not seen in decades.  In a letter home he described the experience of his return in a single, oddly laconic sentence:  “It is kind of amusing to walk through Vienna again.” In 1957, an honorary doctorate was conferred on Artin by the [[University of Freiburg]].  That fall, he returned to Princeton for what would be his final academic year at that institution. He was elected a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]] in 1957.&lt;ref name=AAAS&gt;{{cite web|title=Book of Members, 1780-2010: Chapter A|url=https://www.amacad.org/multimedia/pdfs/publications/bookofmembers/ChapterA.pdf|page=19|accessdate=25 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Artin's marriage to Natascha had by this time seriously frayed. Though nominally still husband and wife, resident in the same house, they were for all intents and purposes living separate lives. Artin was offered a professorship at Hamburg, and at the conclusion of Princeton's spring semester, 1958, he moved permanently to Germany.  His decision to leave Princeton University and the United States was complicated, based on multiple factors, prominent among them Princeton's (then operative) mandatory retirement age of 65. Artin had no wish to retire from teaching and direct involvement with students.  Hamburg's offer was open-ended.

Artin and Natascha were divorced in 1959. In Hamburg, Artin had taken an apartment, but soon gave it over to his mother whom he had brought from Vienna to live near him in Hamburg. He in turn moved into the apartment of the mathematician [[Hel Braun]] in the same neighborhood; though they never married, their relationship was equivalent to marriage. On January 4, 1961, he was granted German citizenship. In June, 1962, on the occasion of the 300th anniversary of the death of [[Blaise Pascal]], the [[University of Clermont-Ferrand]] conferred an honorary doctorate on him. On December 20 of the same year, Artin died at home in Hamburg, aged 64, of a heart attack.

The University of Hamburg honored his memory on April 26, 2005 by naming one of its newly renovated lecture halls The Emil Artin Lecture Hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hup.sub.uni-hamburg.de/opus/volltexte/2008/57/pdf/HamburgUP_HUR09_Artin.pdf Zum Gedenken an Emil Artin (1898–1962)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and work==
Artin was one of the leading algebraists of the century, with an influence larger than might be guessed from the one volume of his ''Collected Papers'' edited by  [[Serge Lang]] and [[John Tate]]. He worked in [[algebraic number theory]], contributing largely to [[class field theory]] and a new construction of [[L-function]]s. He also contributed to the pure theories of [[ring (mathematics)|rings]], [[group (mathematics)|groups]] and [[field (mathematics)|fields]]. The influential treatment of [[abstract algebra]] by [[Bartel Leendert van der Waerden|van der Waerden]] is said to derive in part from Artin's ideas, as well as those of [[Emmy Noether]]. Artin solved [[Hilbert's seventeenth problem]] in 1927. He also developed the [[Braid theory|theory of braids]]{{sfn|Artin|1947}} as a branch of [[algebraic topology]].

In 1955 Artin was teaching [[foundations of geometry]] at New York University. He used his notes to publish [[Geometric Algebra]] in 1957, where he extended the material to include [[symplectic geometry]].

Artin was also an important expositor of [[Galois theory]], and of the [[group cohomology]] approach to class ring theory{{sfn|Artin|Tate|2009}} (with [[John Tate]]), to mention two theories where his formulations became standard.

==Conjectures==

He left two conjectures, both known as '''Artin's conjecture'''. The [[Artin conjecture (L-functions)|first]] concerns [[Artin L-function]]s for a [[linear representation]] of a [[Galois group]]; and the [[Artin's conjecture on primitive roots|second]] the frequency with which a given integer ''a'' is a [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root]] modulo primes ''p'', when ''a'' is fixed and ''p'' varies. These are unproven; in 1967, [[Christopher Hooley|Hooley]] published a [[conditional proof]] for the second conjecture, assuming certain cases of the [[Generalized Riemann hypothesis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hooley, Christopher |year=1967 |title=On Artin's conjecture |journal=J. Reine Angew. Math. |volume=225 |pages=209–220}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Supervision of research==
Artin advised over thirty doctoral students, including [[Bernard Dwork]], [[Serge Lang]], [[Kollagunta Gopalaiyer Ramanathan|K. G. Ramanathan]], [[John Tate]], Harold N. Shapiro,&lt;ref name=HNShapiroThesis/&gt; [[Hans Zassenhaus]] and [[Max August Zorn|Max Zorn]].  A more complete list of his students can be found at the Mathematics Genealogy Project website (see "External Links," below).

==Family==
In 1932 he married [[Natascha Artin Brunswick|Natascha Jasny]], born in Russia to mixed parentage (her mother was Christian, her father, Jewish).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memorial2u.com/Biography/id/64/Natascha_Artin-Brunswick,_née_Jasny Natascha Artin–Brunswick, née Jasny | Memorial2U.com]&lt;/ref&gt; Artin was not himself Jewish, but, on account of his wife's racial status in Nazi Germany, was dismissed from his university position in 1937. They had three children, one of whom is [[Michael Artin]], an American algebraist currently at the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="23188">In [[geometry]], a '''Euclidean plane isometry''' is an [[isometry]] of the [[Euclidean plane]], or more informally, a way of transforming the plane that preserves geometrical properties such as length. There are four types: [[Translation (mathematics)|translations]], [[Coordinate rotation|rotations]], [[Reflection (mathematics)|reflections]], and [[glide reflection]]s (see below under [[Euclidean plane isometry#Classification of Euclidean plane isometries|classification of Euclidean plane isometries]]).

The set of Euclidean plane isometries forms a [[group (mathematics)|group]] under [[function composition|composition]]: the [[Euclidean group]] in two dimensions.  It is generated by reflections in lines, and every element of the Euclidean group is the composite of at most three distinct reflections.

==Informal discussion==

Informally, a Euclidean plane isometry is any way of transforming the plane without "deforming" it. For example, suppose that the Euclidean plane is represented by a sheet of transparent plastic sitting on a desk. Examples of isometries include:
* Shifting the sheet one inch to the right.
* Rotating the sheet by ten degrees around some marked point (which remains motionless).
* Turning the sheet over to look at it from behind. Notice that if a picture is drawn on one side of the sheet, then after turning the sheet over, we see the [[mirror image]] of the picture.

These are examples of [[translation (mathematics)|translation]]s, [[coordinate rotation|rotation]]s, and [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]]s respectively. There is one further type of isometry, called a [[glide reflection]] (see below under [[Euclidean plane isometry#Classification of Euclidean plane isometries|classification of Euclidean plane isometries]]).

However, folding, cutting, or melting the sheet are not considered isometries. Neither are less drastic alterations like bending, stretching, or twisting.

==Formal definition==

An '''isometry''' of the Euclidean plane is a distance-preserving transformation of the plane. That is, it is a [[map (mathematics)|map]]
:&lt;math&gt; M : \textbf{R}^2 \to \textbf{R}^2 &lt;/math&gt;
such that for any points ''p'' and ''q'' in the plane,
:&lt;math&gt;d(p, q) = d(M(p), M(q)),&lt;/math&gt;
where ''d''(''p'', ''q'') is the usual [[Euclidean distance]] between ''p'' and ''q''.

==Classification of Euclidean plane isometries==

It can be shown that there are four types of Euclidean plane isometries. ('''Note''': the notations for the types of isometries listed below are not completely standardised.)
=== Reflections===
[[Image:Euclidean plane isometry reflection.png|right|frame|Reflection]] 
'''[[Reflection (mathematics)|Reflection]]s''', or '''mirror isometries''', denoted by ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''c'',''v''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''c'' is a point in the plane and ''v'' is a [[unit vector]] in  '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. (''F'' is for "flip".) have the effect of reflecting the point ''p'' in the line ''L'' that is perpendicular to ''v'' and that passes through ''c''. The line ''L'' is called the '''reflection axis''' or the associated '''mirror'''. To find a formula for ''F''&lt;sub&gt;''c'',''v''&lt;/sub&gt;, we first use the [[dot product]] to find the component ''t'' of ''p'' &amp;minus; ''c'' in the ''v'' direction,
:&lt;math&gt;t = (p-c) \cdot v = (p_x - c_x)v_x + (p_y - c_y)v_y,&lt;/math&gt;
:and then we obtain the reflection of ''p'' by subtraction,
:&lt;math&gt;F_{c,v}(p) = p - 2tv.&lt;/math&gt;

The combination of rotations about the origin and reflections about a line through the origin is obtained with all orthogonal matrices (i.e. with determinant 1 and &amp;minus;1) forming orthogonal group ''O''(2). In the case of a determinant of &amp;minus;1 we have:
::&lt;math&gt;R_{0,\theta}(p) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta &amp; \sin\theta \\ \sin\theta &amp; -\cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} p_x \\ p_y \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
which is a reflection in the ''x''-axis followed by a rotation by an angle θ, or equivalently, a reflection in a line making an angle of θ/2 with the ''x''-axis. Reflection in a parallel line corresponds to adding a vector perpendicular to it.

=== Translations===
[[Image:Euclidean plane isometry translation.png|right|frame|Translation]] 
'''[[Translation (mathematics)|Translation]]s''', denoted by ''T''&lt;sub&gt;''v''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''v'' is a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; have the effect of shifting the plane in the direction of ''v''. That is, for any point ''p'' in the plane,
::&lt;math&gt;T_v(p) = p + v,&lt;/math&gt;
:or in terms of (''x'', ''y'') coordinates, 
::&lt;math&gt; T_v(p) = \begin{bmatrix} p_x + v_x \\ p_y + v_y \end{bmatrix}. &lt;/math&gt;

A translation can be seen as a composite of two parallel reflections.

=== Rotations===
[[Image:Euclidean plane isometry rotation.png|right|frame|Rotation]] 
'''[[Rotation (mathematics)|Rotations]]''', denoted by ''R''&lt;sub&gt;c,θ&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''c'' is a point in the plane (the centre of rotation), and θ is the angle of rotation. In terms of coordinates, rotations are most easily expressed by breaking them up into two operations. First, a rotation around the origin is given by

::&lt;math&gt;R_{0,\theta}(p) = \begin{pmatrix} \cos\theta &amp; -\sin\theta \\ \sin\theta &amp; \cos\theta \end{pmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix} p_x \\ p_y \end{bmatrix}.&lt;/math&gt;
:These  matrices are the [[orthogonal matrix|orthogonal matrices]] (i.e. each is a [[square matrix]] &lt;var&gt;G&lt;/var&gt; whose [[transpose]] is its [[inverse matrix|inverse]], i.e. &lt;math&gt;GG^T=G^T G=I_2.&lt;/math&gt;), with determinant 1 (the other possibility for orthogonal matrices is &amp;minus;1, which gives a mirror image, see below). They form the special [[orthogonal group]] SO(2).

:A rotation around ''c'' can be accomplished by first translating ''c'' to the origin, then performing the rotation around the origin, and finally translating the origin back to ''c''. That is,
::&lt;math&gt;R_{c,\theta} = T_c \circ R_{0,\theta} \circ T_{-c},&lt;/math&gt;
:or in other words,
::&lt;math&gt;R_{c,\theta}(p) = c + R_{0,\theta}(p - c).&lt;/math&gt;

:Alternatively, a rotation around the origin is performed, followed by a  translation:
::&lt;math&gt;R_{c,\theta}(p) = R_{0,\theta}p + v.&lt;/math&gt;

The set of translations and rotations together form the '''rigid motions''' or '''displacements'''. This set forms a [[Group (mathematics)|group]] under composition, the ''group of rigid motions'', a subgroup of the full group of Euclidean isometries.

A rotation can be seen as a composite of two non-parallel reflections.

=== Glide reflections===
[[Image:Euclidean plane isometry glide reflection.png|right|frame|Glide reflection]] 
'''[[Glide reflection]]s''', denoted by ''G''&lt;sub&gt;''c'',''v'',''w''&lt;/sub&gt;, where ''c'' is a point in the plane, ''v'' is a unit vector in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, and ''w'' is non-null a vector perpendicular to ''v'' are a combination of a reflection in the line described by ''c'' and ''v'', followed by a translation along ''w''. That is,
::&lt;math&gt;G_{c,v,w} = T_w \circ F_{c,v},&lt;/math&gt;
:or in other words,
::&lt;math&gt;G_{c,v,w}(p) = w + F_{c,v}(p).&lt;/math&gt;
:(It is also true that
::&lt;math&gt;G_{c,v,w}(p) = F_{c,v}(p + w);&lt;/math&gt;
:that is, we obtain the same result if we do the translation and the reflection in the opposite order.)

:Alternatively we multiply by an orthogonal matrix with determinant &amp;minus;1 (corresponding to a reflection in a line through the origin), followed by a translation. This is a glide reflection, except in the special case that the translation is perpendicular to the line of reflection, in which case the combination is itself just a reflection in a parallel line.

The [[identity (mathematics)|identity]] isometry, defined by ''I''(''p'') = ''p'' for all points ''p'' is a special case of a translation, and also a special case of a rotation. It is the only isometry which belongs to more than one of the types described above.

In all cases we multiply the position vector by an orthogonal matrix and add a vector; if the determinant is 1 we have a rotation, a translation, or the identity, and if it is &amp;minus;1 we have a glide reflection or a reflection.

A "random" isometry, like taking a sheet of paper from a table and randomly laying it back, "[[almost surely]]" is a rotation or a glide reflection (they have three [[degrees of freedom (physics and chemistry)|degrees of freedom]]). This applies regardless of the details of the [[probability distribution]], as long as θ and the direction of the added vector are [[Statistical independence|independent]] and [[Uniform distribution (continuous)|uniformly distributed]] and the length of the added vector has a continuous distribution. A pure translation and a pure reflection are special cases with only two degrees of freedom, while the identity is even more special, with no degrees of freedom.

==Isometries as reflection group==

Reflections, or mirror isometries, can be combined to produce any isometry. Thus isometries are an example of a [[reflection group]].

=== Mirror combinations ===

In the Euclidean plane, we have the following possibilities.

[[Image:Mirrors make isometries 2005-07-08.png|right|320px|Isometries as mirrors]]
*; [&lt;span style="color:gray;"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt; &amp;nbsp;] Identity
:Two reflections in the same mirror restore each point to its original position. All points are left fixed. Any pair of identical mirrors has the same effect.
*; [&lt;span style="color:gray;"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;b&lt;/span&gt;] Reflection
:As Alice found [[Through the Looking-glass|through the looking-glass]], a single mirror causes left and right hands to switch. (In formal terms, topological orientation is reversed.) Points on the mirror are left fixed. Each mirror has a unique effect.
*; [&lt;span style="color:gray;"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;p&lt;/span&gt;] Rotation
:Two distinct intersecting mirrors have a single point in common, which remains fixed. All other points rotate around it by twice the angle between the mirrors. Any two mirrors with the same fixed point and same angle give the same rotation, so long as they are used in the correct order.
*; [&lt;span style="color:gray;"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;] Translation
:Two distinct mirrors that do not intersect must be parallel. Every point moves the same amount, twice the distance between the mirrors, and in the same direction. No points are left fixed. Any two mirrors with the same parallel direction and the same distance apart give the same translation, so long as they are used in the correct order.
*; [&lt;span style="color:gray;"&gt;d&lt;/span&gt;&lt;span style="color:green;"&gt;q&lt;/span&gt;] Glide reflection
:Three mirrors. If they are all parallel, the effect is the same as a single mirror (slide a pair to cancel the third). Otherwise we can find an equivalent arrangement where two are parallel and the third is perpendicular to them. The effect is a reflection combined with a translation parallel to the mirror. No points are left fixed.

=== Three mirrors suffice ===

Adding more mirrors does not add more possibilities (in the plane), because they can always be rearranged to cause cancellation.

:'''Proof'''. An isometry is completely determined by its effect on three independent (not collinear) points. So suppose ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; map to ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;; we can generate a sequence of mirrors to achieve this as follows. If ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; are distinct, choose their perpendicular bisector as mirror. Now ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; maps to ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;; and we will pass all further mirrors through ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, leaving it fixed. Call the images of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; under this reflection ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;. If ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; is distinct from ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;, bisect the angle at ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; with a new mirror. With ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; now in place, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime;&amp;prime;; and if it is not in place, a final mirror through ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; will flip it to ''q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. Thus at most three reflections suffice to reproduce any plane isometry. ∎

=== Recognition ===

We can recognize which of these isometries we have according to whether it preserves hands or swaps them, and whether it has at least one fixed point or not, as shown in the following table (omitting the identity).

! rowspan="2" | Fixed point?
| align="right" | ''Yes'' || Rotation || Reflection
|- align="center"
| align="right" | ''No'' || &amp;nbsp; Translation &amp;nbsp; || Glide reflection
|}

=== Group structure ===

Isometries requiring an odd number of mirrors — reflection and glide reflection — always reverse left and right. The even isometries — identity, rotation, and translation — never do; they correspond to ''rigid motions'', and form a [[normal subgroup]] of the full [[Euclidean group]] of isometries. Neither the full group nor the even subgroup are [[abelian group|abelian]]; for example, reversing the order of composition of two parallel mirrors reverses the direction of the translation they produce.

:'''Proof'''. The identity is an isometry; nothing changes, so distance cannot change. And if one isometry cannot change distance, neither can two (or three, or more) in succession; thus the composition of two isometries is again an isometry, and the set of isometries is closed under composition. The identity isometry is also an identity for composition, and composition is [[associative]]; therefore isometries satisfy the axioms for a [[semigroup]]. For a [[group (mathematics)|group]], we must also have an inverse for every element. To cancel a reflection, we merely compose it with itself. (Reflections are [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]]s.) And since every isometry can be expressed as a sequence of reflections, its inverse can be expressed as that sequence reversed. Notice that the cancellation of a pair of identical reflections reduces the number of reflections by an even number, preserving the parity of the sequence; also notice that the identity has even parity. Therefore all isometries form a group, and even isometries a subgroup. (Odd isometries do not include the identity, so are not a subgroup.) This subgroup is a normal subgroup, because sandwiching an even isometry between two odd ones yields an even isometry. ∎

Since the even subgroup is normal, it is the [[kernel (algebra)|kernel]] of a [[homomorphism]] to a [[quotient group]], where the quotient is isomorphic to a group consisting of a reflection and the identity. However the full group is not a [[direct product of groups|direct product]], but only a [[semidirect product]], of the even subgroup and the quotient group.

=== Composition ===

Composition of isometries mixes kinds in assorted ways. We can think of the identity as either two mirrors or none; either way, it has no effect in composition. And two reflections give either a translation or a rotation, or the identity (which is both, in a trivial way). Reflection composed with either of these could cancel down to a single reflection; otherwise it gives the only available three-mirror isometry, a glide reflection. A pair of translations always reduces to a single translation; so the challenging cases involve rotations. We know a rotation composed with either a rotation or a translation must produce an even isometry. Composition with translation produces another rotation (by the same amount, with shifted fixed point), but composition with rotation can yield either translation or rotation. It is often said that composition of two rotations produces a rotation, and [[Euler]] proved a theorem to that effect in 3D; however, this is only true for rotations sharing a fixed point.

=== Translation, rotation, and orthogonal subgroups ===

We thus have two new kinds of isometry subgroups: all translations, and rotations sharing a fixed point. Both are subgroups of the even subgroup, within which translations are normal. Because translations are a normal subgroup, we can factor them out leaving the subgroup of isometries with a fixed point, the [[orthogonal group]].

[[Image:Translations combine as mirrors 2005-07-08.png|right|400px|Translation addition with mirrors]]
:'''Proof'''. If two rotations share a fixed point, then we can swivel the mirror pair of the second rotation to cancel the inner mirrors of the sequence of four (two and two), leaving just the outer pair. Thus the composition of two rotations with a common fixed point produces a rotation by the sum of the angles about the same fixed point.
:If two translations are parallel, we can slide the mirror pair of the second translation to cancel the inner mirror of the sequence of four, much as in the rotation case. Thus the composition of two parallel translations produces a translation by the sum of the distances in the same direction. Now suppose the translations are not parallel, and that the mirror sequence is A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the first translation) followed by B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (the second). Then A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; must cross, say at ''c''; and, reassociating, we are free to pivot this inner pair around ''c''. If we pivot 90°, an interesting thing happens: now A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and A&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime; intersect at a 90° angle, say at ''p'', and so do B&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;prime; and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, say at ''q''. Again reassociating, we pivot the first pair around ''p'' to make B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;Prime; pass through ''q'', and pivot the second pair around ''q'' to make A&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;Prime; pass through ''p''. The inner mirrors now coincide and cancel, and the outer mirrors are left parallel. Thus the composition of two non-parallel translations also produces a translation. Also, the three pivot points form a triangle whose edges give the head-to-tail rule of [[vector addition]]: 2(''p'' ''c'') + 2(''c'' ''q'') = 2(''p'' ''q''). ∎
{{clear}}

=== Nested group construction ===

The subgroup structure suggests another way to compose an arbitrary isometry:
: Pick a fixed point, and a mirror through it.
# If the isometry is odd, use the mirror; otherwise do not.
# If necessary, rotate around the fixed point.
# If necessary, translate.

This works because translations are a normal subgroup of the full group of isometries, with quotient the orthogonal group; and rotations about a fixed point are a normal subgroup of the orthogonal group, with quotient a single reflection.

=== Discrete subgroups ===

[[Image:Pentagon symmetry as mirrors 2005-07-08.png|right|140px|Dihedral group of regular pentagon symmetries]]

The subgroups discussed so far are not only infinite, they are also continuous ([[Lie group]]s). Any subgroup containing at least one non-zero translation must be infinite, but subgroups of the orthogonal group can be finite. For example, the [[symmetry|symmetries]] of a regular [[pentagon]] consist of rotations by integer multiples of 72° (360° / 5), along with reflections in the five mirrors which perpendicularly bisect the edges. This is a group, D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, with 10 elements. It has a subgroup, C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, of half the size, omitting the reflections. These two groups are members of two families, D&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; and C&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, for any ''n'' &gt; 1. Together, these families constitute the [[point group|rosette group]]s.

Translations do not fold back on themselves, but we can take integer multiples of any finite translation, or sums of multiples of two such independent translations, as a subgroup. These generate the [[lattice (group)|lattice]] of a periodic [[Tessellation|tiling]] of the plane.

We can also combine these two kinds of discrete groups — the discrete rotations and reflections around a fixed point and the discrete translations — to generate the [[frieze group]]s and [[wallpaper group]]s. Curiously, only a few of the fixed-point groups are found to be [[crystallographic restriction theorem|compatible]] with discrete translations. In fact, lattice compatibility imposes such a severe restriction that, up to [[isomorphism]], we have only 7 distinct frieze groups and 17 distinct wallpaper groups. For example, the pentagon symmetries, D&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;, are incompatible with a discrete lattice of translations. (Each higher dimension also has only a finite number of such [[crystallographic group]]s, but the number grows rapidly; for example, 3D has 230 groups and 4D has 4783.)

==Isometries in the complex plane==
In terms of [[complex numbers]], the isometries of the plane are either of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ccc}\mathbb{C}&amp;\longrightarrow&amp;\mathbb{C}\\ z&amp;\mapsto&amp;a+\omega z\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
or of the form
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{ccc}\mathbb{C}&amp;\longrightarrow&amp;\mathbb{C}\\ z&amp;\mapsto&amp;a+\omega\overline z\mbox{,}\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
for some complex numbers ''a'' and ω with |ω|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. This is easy to prove: if ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(0) and ω&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''f''(1)&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;''f''(0) and if one defines
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{array}{rccc}g\colon&amp;\mathbb{C}&amp;\longrightarrow&amp;\mathbb{C}\\ &amp;z&amp;\mapsto&amp;\frac{f(z)-a}{\omega}\mbox{,}\end{array}&lt;/math&gt;
then ''g'' is an isometry, ''g''(0)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;0, and ''g''(1)&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1. It is then easy to see that ''g'' is either the identity or the conjugation, and the statement being proved follows from this and from the fact that ''f''(''z'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;ω''g''(''z'').

This is obviously related to the previous classification of plane isometries, since:
* functions of the type ''z''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;''a''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;''z'' are translations;
* functions of the type ''z''&amp;nbsp;→&amp;nbsp;ω''z'' are rotations (when |ω|&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1);
* the conjugation is a reflection.

Note that a rotation about complex point ''p'' is obtained by complex arithmetic with
:&lt;math&gt;z \mapsto \omega (z - p) + p = \omega z + p(1 - \omega)&lt;/math&gt;
where the last expression shows the mapping equivalent to rotation at 0 and a translation.
Therefore, given direct isometry &lt;math&gt;z \mapsto \omega z + a,&lt;/math&gt; one can solve
&lt;math&gt;p(1 - \omega) = a&lt;/math&gt; to obtain &lt;math&gt;p = a/(1 - \omega)&lt;/math&gt; as the center for an equivalent rotation, provided that &lt;math&gt;\omega \ne 1&lt;/math&gt;, that is, provided the direct isometry is not a pure translation. As stated by Cederberg (page 151), "A direct isometry is either a rotation or a translation."

In [[mathematics]], an '''evasive Boolean function''' ''&amp;fnof;'' (of ''n'' variables) is a [[Boolean function]] for which every [[Decision tree model|decision tree algorithm]] has running time of exactly&amp;nbsp;''n''.  Consequently, every [[Decision tree model|decision tree algorithm]] that represents the function has, at worst case, a running time of&amp;nbsp;''n''.

== Examples ==

=== An example for a non-evasive boolean function ===
The following is a Boolean function on the three variables ''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y'',&amp;nbsp;''z'':

{| style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|-
|&lt;math&gt;~f(x,y,z)~&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;~=~&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;~(x \land y)~&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;~\lor~&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;~(\neg x \land z)~&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[File:Venn 0001 1011.svg|50px]]
|&lt;math&gt;~=~&lt;/math&gt;
|[[File:Venn 0001 0001.svg|50px]]
|&lt;math&gt;~\lor~&lt;/math&gt;
|[[File:Venn 0000 1010.svg|50px]]
|}

(where &lt;math&gt;\land&lt;/math&gt; is the bitwise "and", &lt;math&gt;\lor&lt;/math&gt; is the bitwise "or", and &lt;math&gt;\neg &lt;/math&gt; is the bitwise "not").

This function is not evasive, because there is a decision tree that solves it by checking exactly two variables:  The algorithm first checks the value of&amp;nbsp;''x''. If ''x'' is true, the algorithm checks the value of ''y'' and returns it.

:( &amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&lt;math&gt;(\neg x = \text{false}) ~~\Rightarrow~~ ((\neg x \land z) = \text{false})&lt;/math&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; )

If ''x'' is false, the algorithm checks the value of ''z'' and returns it.

=== A simple example for an evasive boolean function ===

Consider this simple "and" function on three variables:

{| style="text-align: center; border: 1px solid darkgray;"
|-
|&lt;math&gt;~f(x,y,z)~&lt;/math&gt;
|&lt;math&gt;~= (x \wedge y \wedge z)~&lt;/math&gt;
|-
|[[File:Venn 0000 0001.svg|50px]]
|
|}

A worst-case input (for every algorithm) is&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1,&amp;nbsp;1. In every order we choose to check the variables, we have to check all of them. (Note that in general there could be a different worst-case input for every decision tree algorithm.)  Hence the functions: "and", "or" (on ''n'' variables) are evasive.

== Binary zero-sum games  ==

For the case of binary [[zero-sum game]]s, every [[evaluation function]] is evasive.

In every zero-sum game, the value of the game is achieved by the [[minimax]] algorithm (player 1 tries to maximize the profit, and player 2 tries to minimize the cost).

In the binary case, the max function equals the bitwise&amp;nbsp;"or", and the min function equals the bitwise&amp;nbsp;"and".

A decision tree for this game will be of this form:
* every leaf will have value in {0,&amp;nbsp;1}.
* every node is connected to one of {"and",&amp;nbsp;"or"}

For every such tree with ''n'' leaves, the running time in the worst case is ''n'' (meaning that the algorithm must check all the leaves):

We will exhibit an [[Adversary (online algorithm)|adversary]] that produces a worst-case input &amp;ndash; for every leaf that the algorithm checks, the adversary will answer 0 if the leaf's parent is an Or node, and 1 if the parent is an And node.

This input (0 for all Or nodes' children, and 1 for all And nodes' children) forces the algorithm to check all nodes:

As in the second example
* in order to calculate the ''Or'' result, if all children are 0 we must check them all. 
* In order to calculate the ''And'' result, if all children are 1 we must check them all.

'''Hermann Minkowski''' ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ŋ|ˈ|k|ɔː|f|s|k|i|,_|-|ˈ|k|ɒ|f|-}};&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/minkowski"Minkowski"]. ''[[Random House Webster's Unabridged Dictionary]]''.&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA-de|mɪŋˈkɔfski|lang}}; 22 June 1864 – 12 January 1909) was a [[German people|German]] [[mathematician]] and professor at [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]], [[University of Zürich|Zürich]] and [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]]. He created and developed the [[geometry of numbers]] and used geometrical methods to solve problems in [[number theory]], [[mathematical physics]], and the [[theory of relativity]].

Minkowski is perhaps best known for his work in relativity, in which he showed in 1907 that his former student [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[special theory of relativity]] (1905) could  be understood geometrically as a theory of four-dimensional space–time, since known as the "[[Minkowski spacetime]]".

==Personal life and family==
Hermann Minkowski was born in [[Aleksotas]], a village in the [[Kovno Governorate]] of the [[Russian Empire]] (now incorporated into the city of [[Kaunas]], [[Lithuania]]) to Lewin Boruch Minkowski, a merchant who subsidized the building of the [[Kaunas Synagogue|choral synagogue in Kovno]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.berkovich-zametki.com/Nomer16/Chaesh1.htm А.

Hermann was a younger brother of the medical researcher, [[Oskar Minkowski|Oskar]] (born 1858).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.diabetologia-journal.org/webpages/covers/2005/august.html Oskar Minkowski (1858–1931)].

To escape [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|persecution in Russia]] the family moved to Königsberg in 1872,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hormones.gr/165/article/article.html|title=Hormones.gr|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; where the father became involved in rag export and later in manufacture of mechanical clockwork tin toys (he operated his firm ''Lewin Minkowski &amp; Son'' with his eldest son Max).&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lVjOAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA183&amp;lpg=RA1-PA183&amp;dq Report of the Federal Security Agency (p. 183)];

[http://www.nasonline.org/publications/biographical-memoirs/memoir-pdfs/minkowski-rudolph.pdf Rudolph Leo Bernhard Minkowski: A Biographical Memoir]&lt;/ref&gt;

Minkowski studied in Königsberg and taught in [[Bonn]] (1887–1894), Königsberg (1894–1896) and [[Zurich]] (1896–1902), and finally in [[Göttingen]] from 1902 until his premature death in 1909.  He married Auguste Adler in 1897 with whom he had two daughters; the electrical engineer and inventor [[Reinhold Rudenberg]] was his son-in-law.

Minkowski died suddenly of [[appendicitis]] in Göttingen on 12 January 1909. [[David Hilbert]]'s obituary of Minkowski illustrates the deep friendship between the two mathematicians (translated):
:Since my student years Minkowski was my best, most dependable friend who supported me with all the depth and loyalty that was so characteristic of him.  Our science, which we loved above all else, brought us together; it seemed to us a garden full of flowers.  In it, we enjoyed looking for hidden pathways and discovered many a new perspective that appealed to our sense of beauty, and when one of us showed it to the other and we marveled over it together, our joy was complete.  He was for me a rare gift from heaven and I must be grateful to have possessed that gift for so long.  Now death has suddenly torn him from our midst.  However, what death cannot take away is his noble image in our hearts and the knowledge that his spirit continues to be active in us.

[[Max Born]] delivered the obituary on behalf of the mathematics students at Göttingen.{{sfn|Greenspan|2005|pp=42–43}}

The main-belt [[asteroid]] [[12493 Minkowski]] and [[M-matrix|M-matrices]] are named in Minkowski's honor.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

==Education and career==
[[File:Hermann Minkowski.png|thumb|upright|Minkowski in 1883, at the time of being awarded the Mathematics Prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]]]]
Minkowski was educated in [[East Prussia]] at the ''Albertina'' [[University of Königsberg]], where he earned his doctorate in 1885 under the direction of [[Ferdinand von Lindemann]]. In 1883, while still a student at Königsberg, he was awarded the Mathematics Prize of the [[French Academy of Sciences]] for his manuscript on the theory of [[quadratic form]]s. He also became a friend of another renowned mathematician, [[David Hilbert]]. His brother, [[Oskar Minkowski]] (1858–1931), was a well-known physician and researcher.

Minkowski taught at the universities of [[University of Bonn|Bonn]], [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]], [[University of Königsberg|Königsberg]], and [[University of Zürich|Zürich]]. At the [[Federal Polytechnic Institute|''Eidgenössische Polytechnikum'']], today the [[ETH Zurich]], he was one of [[Albert Einstein|Einstein]]'s teachers.

Minkowski explored the arithmetic of [[quadratic form]]s, especially concerning ''n'' variables, and his research into that topic led him to consider certain geometric properties in a space of ''n'' [[dimension]]s. In 1896, he presented his ''[[geometry of numbers]]'', a geometrical method that solved problems in [[number theory]]. He is also the creator of the Minkowski Sausage and the Minkowski cover of a curve.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=minkowski+sausage&amp;a=*C.minkowski+sausage-_*MathWorld-&amp;f2=3&amp;f=MinkowskiSausage.n%5Cu005f3 "Minkowski Sausage"], ''[[WolframAlpha]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, he joined the Mathematics Department of [[University of Göttingen|Göttingen]] and became a close colleague of [[David Hilbert]], whom he first met at university in Königsberg.  [[Constantin Carathéodory]] was one of his students there.

==Work on relativity==

By 1907 Minkowski realized that the [[special theory of relativity]], introduced by his former student [[Albert Einstein]] in 1905 and based on the previous work of [[Hendrik Lorentz|Lorentz]] and [[Henri Poincaré|Poincaré]], could best be understood in a four-dimensional space, since known as the "[[Minkowski spacetime]]", in which [[time]] and [[space]] are not separated entities but intermingled in a four-dimensional [[space–time]], and in which the [[Lorentz transformation|Lorentz geometry]] of special relativity can be effectively represented using the invariant interval &lt;math&gt;x^2 + y^2 + z^2 - c^2 t^2&lt;/math&gt; (see [[History of special relativity]]).

The mathematical basis of Minkowski space can also be found in the [[hyperboloid model]] of [[hyperbolic space]] already known in the 19th century, because isometries (or motions) in hyperbolic space can be related to [[Lorentz transformations]], which included contributions of [[Wilhelm Killing]] (1880, 1885), [[Henri Poincaré]] (1881), [[Homersham Cox (mathematician)|Homersham Cox]] (1881), [[Alexander Macfarlane]] (1894) and others (see [[History of Lorentz transformations]]).

The beginning part of his address called "Space and Time" delivered at the 80th ''Assembly of German Natural Scientists and Physicians'' (21 September 1908) is now famous:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The views of space and time which I wish to lay before you have sprung from the soil of experimental physics, and therein lies their strength. They are radical. Henceforth space by itself, and time by itself, are doomed to fade away into mere shadows, and only a kind of union of the two will preserve an independent reality.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In [[mathematics]], a '''highly abundant number''' is a [[natural number]] with the property that the sum of its divisors (including itself) is greater than the sum of the divisors of any smaller natural number.

Highly abundant numbers and several similar classes of numbers were first introduced by {{harvs|authorlink=Subbayya Sivasankaranarayana Pillai|last=Pillai|year=1943|txt}}, and early work on the subject was done by {{harvs|author1-link=Leonidas Alaoglu|last1=Alaoglu|author2-link=Paul Erdős|last2=Erdős|year=1944|txt}}. Alaoglu and Erdős tabulated all highly abundant numbers up to 10&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;, and showed that the number of highly abundant numbers less than any ''N'' is at least proportional to log&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ''N''.

== Formal definition and examples ==

Formally, a natural number ''n'' is called highly abundant [[if and only if]] for all natural numbers ''m'' &amp;lt; ''n'',

:&lt;math&gt;\sigma(n) &gt; \sigma(m)&lt;/math&gt;

where σ denotes the [[divisor function|sum-of-divisors function]]. The first few highly abundant numbers are
:[[1 (number)|1]], [[2 (number)|2]], [[3 (number)|3]], [[4 (number)|4]], [[6 (number)|6]], [[8 (number)|8]], [[10 (number)|10]], [[12 (number)|12]], [[16 (number)|16]], [[18 (number)|18]], [[20 (number)|20]], [[24 (number)|24]], [[30 (number)|30]], [[36 (number)|36]], [[42 (number)|42]], [[48 (number)|48]], [[60 (number)|60]], ... {{OEIS|id=A002093}}.

For instance, 5 is not highly abundant because σ(5) = 5+1 = 6 is smaller than σ(4) = 4 + 2 + 1 = 7, while 8 is highly abundant because σ(8) = 8 + 4 + 2 + 1 = 15 is larger than all previous values of σ.

The only odd highly abundant numbers are 1 and 3.&lt;ref&gt;See {{harvtxt|Alaoglu|Erdős|1944}}, p.&amp;nbsp;466. Alaoglu and Erdős claim more strongly that all highly abundant numbers greater than 210 are divisible by 4, but this is not true: 630 is highly abundant, and is not divisible by 4. (In fact, 630 is the only [[counterexample]]; all larger highly abundant numbers are divisible by 12.)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Relations with other sets of numbers ==

Although the first eight [[factorial]]s are highly abundant, not all factorials are highly abundant. For example,
:&amp;sigma;(9!) = &amp;sigma;(362880) = 1481040,
but there is a smaller number with larger sum of divisors,
:&amp;sigma;(360360) = 1572480,
so 9! is not highly abundant.

Alaoglu and Erdős noted that all [[superabundant number]]s are highly abundant, and asked whether there are infinitely many highly abundant numbers that are not superabundant. This question was answered affirmatively by {{harvs|authorlink=Jean-Louis Nicolas|first=Jean-Louis|last=Nicolas|year=1969|txt}}.

Despite the terminology, not all highly abundant numbers are [[abundant number]]s.  In particular, none of the first seven highly abundant numbers is abundant.

7200 is the largest [[powerful number]] that is also highly abundant: all larger highly abundant numbers have a prime factor that divides them only once. Therefore, 7200 is also the largest highly abundant number with an odd sum of divisors.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvtxt|Alaoglu|Erdős|1944}}, pp. 464–466.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[number theory]], '''Hurwitz's theorem''', named after [[Adolf Hurwitz]], gives a [[upper bound|bound]] on a [[Diophantine approximation]]. The theorem states that for every [[irrational number]] ''&amp;xi;'' there are infinitely many [[coprime integers|relatively prime]] integers ''m'', ''n'' such that

:&lt;math&gt;\left |\xi-\frac{m}{n}\right |&lt;\frac{1}{\sqrt{5}\, n^2}.&lt;/math&gt;

The hypothesis that ''ξ'' is irrational cannot be omitted. Moreover the constant &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt; is the best possible; if we replace &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt; by any number &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle A &gt; \sqrt{5}&lt;/math&gt; and we let &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle \xi=(1+\sqrt{5})/2&lt;/math&gt; (the [[golden ratio]]) then there exist only ''finitely'' many relatively prime integers ''m'', ''n'' such that the formula above holds.

In [[voting system]]s, the '''Landau set''' (or '''uncovered set''', or '''[[Peter Fishburn|Fishburn]] set''') is the set of candidates &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; such that for every other candidate &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;, there is some candidate &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; (possibly the same as &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt;) such that &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt; is not preferred to &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; is not preferred to &lt;math&gt;y&lt;/math&gt;.  In notation, &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; is in the Landau set if 
&lt;math&gt;\forall \,z&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\exists \,y&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;x \ge y \ge z&lt;/math&gt;.

The Landau set is a nonempty subset of the [[Smith set]].  It was discovered by Nicholas Miller.

'''Lie sphere geometry''' is a [[geometry|geometrical]] theory of [[plane geometry|planar]] or [[spatial geometry]] in which the fundamental concept is the [[circle]] or [[sphere]]. It was introduced by [[Sophus Lie]] in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;The definitive modern textbook on Lie sphere geometry is {{Harvnb|Cecil|1992}}. Almost all the material in this article can be found there.&lt;/ref&gt; The main idea which leads to Lie sphere geometry is that lines (or planes) should be regarded as circles (or spheres) of infinite radius and that points in the plane (or space) should be regarded as circles (or spheres) of zero radius.

The space of circles in the plane (or spheres in space), including points and lines (or planes) turns out to be a [[manifold]] known as the [[Lie quadric]] (a [[quadric hypersurface]] in [[projective space]]). Lie sphere geometry is the geometry of the Lie quadric and the Lie transformations which preserve it. This geometry can be difficult to visualize because Lie transformations do not preserve points in general: points can be transformed into circles (or spheres).

To handle this, curves in the plane and surfaces in space are studied using their '''contact lifts''', which are determined by their [[tangent space]]s. This provides a natural realisation of the [[osculating circle]] to a curve, and the [[curvature sphere]]s of a surface. It also allows for a natural treatment of [[Dupin cyclide]]s and a conceptual solution of the [[Apollonius problem|problem of Apollonius]].

Lie sphere geometry can be defined in any dimension, but the case of the plane and 3-dimensional space are the most important. In the latter case, Lie noticed a remarkable similarity between the Lie quadric of spheres in 3-dimensions, and the space of lines in 3-dimensional projective space, which is also a quadric hypersurface in a 5-dimensional projective space, called the Plücker or [[Klein quadric]].  This similarity led Lie to his famous "line-sphere correspondence" between the space of lines and the space of spheres in 3-dimensional space.&lt;ref name=line-sphere&gt;Lie was particularly pleased with this achievement: see {{Harvnb|Helgason|1994|p=7}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Basic concepts==

The key observation that leads to Lie sphere geometry is that theorems of [[Euclidean geometry]] in the plane (resp. in space) which only depend on the concepts of circles (resp. spheres) and their [[tangent]]ial [[contact (geometry)|contact]] have a more natural formulation in a more general context in which circles, [[Line (geometry)|line]]s and [[point (geometry)|points]] (resp. spheres, [[plane (mathematics)|planes]] and points) are treated on an equal footing. This is achieved in three steps. First an ideal [[point at infinity]] is added to Euclidean space so that lines (or planes) can be regarded as circles (or spheres) passing through the point at infinity (i.e., having infinite [[radius]]). This extension is known as [[Inversive geometry#Inversion in higher dimensions|inversive geometry]] with automorphisms known as "Mobius transformations". Second, points are regarded as circles (or spheres) of zero radius. Finally, for technical reasons, the circles (or spheres), including the lines (or planes) are given [[orientation (mathematics)|orientations]].

These objects, i.e., the points, oriented circles and oriented lines in the plane, or the points, oriented spheres and oriented planes in space, are sometimes called cycles or Lie cycles. It turns out that they form a [[quadric hypersurface]] in a [[projective space]] of dimension 4 or 5, which is known as the Lie quadric. The natural [[symmetry (mathematics)|symmetries]] of this quadric form a [[transformation group|group of transformations]] known as the Lie transformations. These transformations do not preserve points in general: they are transforms of the Lie quadric, ''not'' of the plane/sphere plus point at infinity. The point-preserving transformations are precisely the Möbius transformations. The Lie transformations which fix the ideal point at infinity are the [[Edmond Laguerre|Laguerre]] transformations of [[Laguerre geometry]]. These two subgroups generate the group of Lie transformations, and their intersection are the Möbius transforms that fix the ideal point at infinity, namely the affine conformal maps.

These groups also have a direct physical interpretation: As pointed out by [[Harry Bateman]], the Lie sphere transformations are identical with the [[spherical wave transformation]]s that leave the form of [[Maxwell's equations]] invariant. In addition, [[Élie Cartan]], [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Wilhelm Blaschke]] pointed out that the Laguerre group is simply isomorphic to the [[Lorentz group]] of [[special relativity]] (see [[Spherical wave transformation#Laguerre group isomorphic to Lorentz group|Laguerre group isomorphic to Lorentz group]]). Eventually, there is also an isomorphism between the Möbius group and the Lorentz group (see [[Möbius group#Lorentz transformation]]).

==Lie sphere geometry in the plane==

===The Lie quadric===

The Lie quadric of the plane is defined as follows. Let '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3,2&lt;/sup&gt; denote the space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; of 5-tuples of real numbers, equipped with the [[symmetric bilinear form|signature]] (3,2) [[symmetric bilinear form]] defined by
:&lt;math&gt; (x_0,x_1,x_2,x_3,x_4)\cdot (y_0,y_1,y_2,y_3,y_4) = - x_0 y_0 + x_1 y_1 + x_2 y_2 + x_3 y_4 + x_4 y_3.&lt;/math&gt;
[[File:Ruled hyperboloid.jpg|thumb|right|A ruled [[hyperboloid]] is a 2-dimensional analogue of the Lie quadric.]]
The projective space '''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; is the space of lines through the [[origin (mathematics)|origin]] in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; and is the space of nonzero vectors '''x''' in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; up to scale, where '''x'''= (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). The planar Lie quadric ''Q'' consists of the points ['''x'''] in projective space represented by vectors '''x''' with '''x''' · '''x''' = 0.

To relate this to planar geometry it is necessary to fix an oriented [[timelike]] line. The chosen coordinates suggest using the point [1,0,0,0,0] ∈ '''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;. Any point in the Lie quadric ''Q'' can then be represented by a vector '''x''' = λ(1,0,0,0,0) + '''v''', where '''v''' is [[orthogonal]] to (1,0,0,0,0). Since ['''x'''] ∈ ''Q'', '''v''' · '''v''' = ''λ''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ≥ 0.

The orthogonal space to (1,0,0,0,0), intersected with the Lie quadric, is the two dimensional [[celestial sphere]] ''S'' in [[Minkowski space-time]]. This is the Euclidean plane with an ideal point at infinity, which we take to be [0,0,0,0,1]: the finite points (''x'',''y'') in the plane are then represented by the points ['''v'''] = [0,''x'',''y'', &amp;minus;1, (''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;+''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/2]; note that '''v''' · '''v''' = 0, '''v''' · (1,0,0,0,0) = 0 and '''v''' · (0,0,0,0,1) = &amp;minus;1.

Hence points  '''x''' = ''λ''(1,0,0,0,0) + '''v''' on the Lie quadric with ''λ'' = 0 correspond to points in the Euclidean plane with an ideal point at infinity. On the other hand, points '''x''' with ''λ'' nonzero correspond to oriented circles (or oriented lines, which are circles through infinity) in the Euclidean plane. This is easier to see in terms of the [[celestial sphere]] ''S'': the circle corresponding to [''λ''(1,0,0,0,0) + '''v'''] ∈ ''Q'' (with ''λ'' ≠ 0) is the set of points '''y''' ∈ ''S'' with '''y''' · '''v''' = 0. The circle is oriented because '''v'''/''λ'' has a definite sign; [&amp;minus;''λ''(1,0,0,0,0) + '''v'''] represents the same circle with the opposite orientation. Thus the [[isometry|isometric]] reflection map '''x''' → '''x''' + 2 ('''x''' · (1,0,0,0,0)) (1,0,0,0,0) induces an [[Involution (mathematics)|involution]] ''ρ'' of the Lie quadric which reverses the orientation of circles and lines, and fixes the points of the
plane (including infinity).

To summarize: there is a one-to-one correspondence between points on the Lie quadric and ''cycles'' in the plane, where a cycle is either an oriented circle (or straight line) or a point in the plane (or the point at infinity); the points can be thought of as circles of radius zero, but they are not oriented.

===Incidence of cycles===

Suppose two cycles are represented by points ['''x'''], ['''y'''] ∈ ''Q''. Then '''x''' · '''y''' = 0 if and only if the corresponding cycles "kiss", that is they meet each other with oriented first order [[contact (mathematics)|contact]]. If ['''x'''] ∈ ''S'' ≅ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; ∪ {∞}, then this just means that ['''x'''] lies on the circle corresponding to ['''y''']; this case is immediate from the definition of this circle (if ['''y'''] corresponds to a point circle then '''x''' · '''y''' = 0 if and only if ['''x'''] = ['''y''']).

It therefore remains to consider the case that neither ['''x'''] nor ['''y'''] are in ''S''. Without loss of generality, we can then take '''x'''= (1,0,0,0,0) + '''v''' and '''y''' = (1,0,0,0,0) + '''w''', where '''v''' and '''w''' are [[spacelike]] unit vectors in (1,0,0,0,0)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;. Thus 
'''v'''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ (1,0,0,0,0)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; and '''w'''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; ∩ (1,0,0,0,0)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt; are signature (2,1) subspaces of (1,0,0,0,0)&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;. They therefore either coincide or intersect in a 2-dimensional subspace. In the latter case, the 2-dimensional subspace can either have signature (2,0), (1,0), (1,1), in which case the corresponding two circles in ''S'' intersect in zero, one or two points respectively. Hence they have first order contact if and only if the 2-dimensional subspace is degenerate (signature (1,0)), which holds if and only if the span of '''v''' and '''w''' is degenerate. By [[Lagrange's identity]], this holds if and only if ('''v''' · '''w''')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = ('''v''' · '''v''')('''w''' · '''w''') = 1, i.e., if and only if '''v''' · '''w''' = ± 1, i.e., '''x''' · '''y''' = 1 ± 1. The contact is oriented if and only if '''v''' · '''w''' = – 1, i.e., '''x''' · '''y''' = 0.

===The problem of Apollonius===
[[File:Apollonius all solutions.png|300px|thumb|right|The eight solutions of the generic Apollonian problem. The three given circles are labeled C1, C2 and C3 and colored red, green and blue, respectively. The solutions are arranged in four pairs, with one pink and one black solution circle each, labeled as 1A/1B, 2A/2B, 3A/3B, and 4A/4B. Each pair makes oriented contact with C1, C2, and C3, for a suitable choice of orientations; there are four such choices up to an overall orientation reversal.]]
The incidence of cycles in Lie sphere geometry provides a simple solution to the [[problem of Apollonius]].&lt;ref&gt;The Lie sphere approach is discussed in {{Harvnb|Zlobec|Mramor Kosta|2001}}; for a classification of solutions using Laguerre geometry, see {{Harvnb|Knight|2005}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This problem concerns a configuration of three distinct circles (which may be points or lines): the aim is to find every other circle (including points or lines) which is tangent to all three of the original circles. For a generic configuration of circles, there are at most eight such tangent circles.

The solution, using Lie sphere geometry, proceeds as follows. Choose an orientation for each of the three circles (there are eight ways to do this, but there are only four up to reversing the orientation of all three). This defines three points ['''x'''], ['''y'''], ['''z'''] on the Lie quadric ''Q''. By the incidence of cycles, a solution to the Apollonian problem compatible with the chosen orientations is given by a point ['''q'''] ∈ ''Q'' such that '''q''' is orthogonal to '''x''', '''y''' and '''z'''. If these three vectors are [[linear dependence|linearly dependent]], then the corresponding points ['''x'''], ['''y'''], ['''z'''] lie on a line in projective space. Since a nontrivial quadratic equation has at most two solutions, this line actually lies in the Lie quadric, and any point ['''q'''] on this line defines a cycle incident with ['''x'''], ['''y'''] and ['''z''']. Thus there are infinitely many solutions in this case.

If instead '''x''', '''y''' and '''z''' are linearly independent then the [[vector subspace|subspace]] ''V'' orthogonal to all three is 2-dimensional. It can have signature (2,0), (1,0), or (1,1), in which case there are zero, one or two solutions for ['''q'''] respectively. (The signature cannot be (0,1) or (0,2) because it is orthogonal to a space containing more than one null line.) In the case that the subspace has signature (1,0), the unique solution '''q''' lies in the span of '''x''', '''y''' and '''z'''.

The general solution to the Apollonian problem is obtained by reversing orientations of some of the circles, or equivalently, by considering the triples ('''x''',''ρ''('''y'''),'''z'''),  ('''x''','''y''',''ρ''('''z''')) and ('''x''',''ρ''('''y'''),''ρ''('''z''')).

Note that the triple (''ρ''('''x'''),''ρ''('''y'''),''ρ''('''z''')) yields the same solutions as ('''x''','''y''','''z'''), but with an overall reversal of orientation. Thus there are at most 8 solution circles to the Apollonian problem unless all three circles meet tangentially at a single point, when there are infinitely many solutions.

===Lie transformations===

Any element of the [[group (mathematics)|group]] O(3,2) of [[indefinite orthogonal group|orthogonal transformations]] of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3,2&lt;/sup&gt; maps any one-dimensional subspace of [[null vector]]s in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3,2&lt;/sup&gt; to another such subspace. Hence the group O(3,2) [[group action|acts]] on the Lie quadric. These transformations of cycles are called "Lie transformations". They preserve the incidence relation between cycles. The action is [[Transitive action|transitive]] and so all cycles are Lie equivalent. In particular, points are not preserved by general Lie transformations. The subgroup of Lie transformations preserving the point cycles is essentially the subgroup of orthogonal transformations which preserve the chosen timelike direction. This subgroup is [[isomorphic]] to the group O(3,1) of [[Möbius transformation]]s of the sphere. It can also be characterized as the [[centralizer]] of the involution ''ρ'', which is itself a Lie transformation.

Lie transformations can often be used to simplify a geometrical problem, by transforming circles into lines or points.

===Contact elements and contact lifts===

The fact that Lie transformations do not preserve points in general can also be a hindrance to understanding Lie sphere geometry. In particular, the notion of a curve is not Lie invariant. This difficulty can be mitigated by the observation that there is a Lie invariant notion of [[contact (mathematics)|contact element]].

An oriented contact element in the plane is a pair consisting of a point and an [[orientation (mathematics)|oriented]] (i.e., directed) line through that point. The point and the line are incident cycles. The key observation is that the set of all cycles incident with both the point and the line is a Lie invariant object: in addition to the point and the line, it consists of all the circles which make oriented contact with the line at the given point. It is called a ''[[pencil (mathematics)|pencil]] of Lie cycles'', or simply a ''contact element''.

Note that the cycles are all incident with each other as well. In terms of the Lie quadric, this means that a pencil of cycles is a (projective) line lying entirely on the Lie quadric, i.e., it is the projectivization of a totally null two dimensional subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3,2&lt;/sup&gt;: the representative vectors for the cycles in the pencil are all orthogonal to each other.

The set of all lines on the Lie quadric is a 3-dimensional [[manifold]] called the space of contact elements ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. The Lie transformations preserve the contact elements, and act transitively on ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. For a given choice of point cycles (the points orthogonal to a chosen timelike vector '''v'''), every contact element contains a unique point. This defines a map from ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; to the 2-sphere ''S''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; whose fibres are circles. This map is not Lie invariant, as points are not Lie invariant.

Let ''γ'':[''a'',''b''] → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; be an oriented curve. Then ''γ'' determines a map ''λ'' from the interval [''a'',''b''] to ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; by sending ''t'' to the contact element corresponding to the point ''γ''(''t'') and the oriented line tangent to the curve at that point (the line in the direction ''γ'' '(''t'')). This map ''λ'' is called the ''contact lift'' of ''γ''.

In fact ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is a [[contact manifold]], and the contact structure is Lie invariant. It follows that oriented curves can be studied in a Lie invariant way via their contact lifts, which may be characterized, generically as [[Legendrian submanifold|Legendrian curves]] in ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;. More precisely, the tangent space to ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; at the point corresponding to a null 2-dimensional subspace ''π'' of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3,2&lt;/sup&gt; is the subspace of those [[linear map]]s (A mod ''π''):''π'' → '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3,2&lt;/sup&gt;/''π'' with
: ''A''('''x''') · '''y''' + '''x''' · ''A''('''y''') = 0
and the [[contact manifold|contact distribution]] is the subspace Hom(''π'',''π''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;/''π'') of this tangent space in the space Hom(''π'','''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3,2&lt;/sup&gt;/''π'') of linear maps.

It follows that an [[immersion (mathematics)|immersed]] Legendrian curve ''λ'' in ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; has a preferred Lie cycle associated to each point on the curve: the derivative of the immersion at ''t'' is a 1-dimensional subspace of Hom(''π'',''π''&lt;sup&gt;⊥&lt;/sup&gt;/''π'') where ''π''=''λ''(''t''); the kernel of any nonzero element of this subspace is a well defined 1-dimensional subspace of ''π'', i.e., a point on the Lie quadric.

In more familiar terms, if ''λ'' is the contact lift of a curve ''γ'' in the plane, then the preferred cycle at each point is the [[osculating circle]]. In other words, after taking contact lifts, much of the basic theory of curves in the plane is Lie invariant.

==Lie sphere geometry in space and higher dimensions==

===General theory===
Lie sphere geometry in ''n''-dimensions is obtained by replacing '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3,2&lt;/sup&gt; (corresponding to the Lie quadric in ''n'' = 2 dimensions) by '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n'' + 1, 2&lt;/sup&gt;. This is '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;n + 3 &lt;/sup&gt; equipped with the symmetric bilinear form
:&lt;math&gt; (x_0,x_1,\ldots x_n,x_{n+1},x_{n+2})\cdot (y_0,y_1,\ldots y_n,y_{n+1},y_{n+2})&lt;/math&gt;
::&lt;math&gt; = - x_0 y_0 + x_1 y_1 + \cdots + x_n y_n + x_{n+1} y_{n+2} + x_{n+2} y_{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;
The Lie quadric ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is again defined as the set of ['''x'''] ∈ '''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;''n''+2&lt;/sup&gt; = P('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1,2&lt;/sup&gt;) with '''x''' · '''x''' = 0. The quadric parameterizes oriented [[hypersphere|(''n'' – 1)-spheres]] in ''n''-dimensional space, including [[hyperplane]]s and point spheres as limiting cases. Note that ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; is an (n + 1)-dimensional manifold (spheres are parameterized by their center and radius).

The incidence relation carries over without change: the spheres corresponding to points ['''x'''], ['''y'''] ∈ ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; have oriented first order contact if and only if '''x''' · '''y''' = 0. The group of Lie transformations is now O(n + 1, 2) and the Lie transformations preserve incidence of Lie cycles.

The space of contact elements is a (2''n'' – 1)-dimensional contact manifold ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;2''n'' – 1&lt;/sup&gt;: in terms of the given choice of point spheres, these contact elements correspond to pairs consisting of a point in ''n''-dimensional space (which may be the point at infinity) together with an oriented [[hyperplane]] passing through that point. The space ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;2''n'' – 1&lt;/sup&gt; is therefore isomorphic to the projectivized [[cotangent bundle]] of the ''n''-sphere. This identification is not invariant under Lie transformations: in Lie invariant terms, ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;2''n'' – 1&lt;/sup&gt; is the space of (projective) lines on the Lie quadric.

Any immersed oriented hypersurface in ''n''-dimensional space has a contact lift to ''Z''&lt;sup&gt;2''n'' – 1&lt;/sup&gt; determined by its oriented [[tangent space]]s. There is no longer a preferred Lie cycle associated to each point: instead, there are ''n'' – 1 such cycles, corresponding to the curvature spheres in Euclidean geometry.

The problem of Apollonius has a natural generalization involving ''n'' + 1 hyperspheres in ''n'' dimensions.&lt;ref&gt;This problem and its solution is discussed by {{Harvnb|Zlobec|Mramor Kosta|2001}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Three dimensions and the line-sphere correspondence===

In the case ''n''=3, the quadric ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;''3''&lt;/sub&gt; in P('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4,2&lt;/sup&gt;) describes the (Lie) geometry of spheres in Euclidean 3-space. Lie noticed a remarkable similarity with the [[Klein correspondence]] for lines in 3-dimensional space (more precisely in '''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;).&lt;ref name=line-sphere/&gt;

Suppose ['''x'''], ['''y'''] ∈ '''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;, with [[homogeneous coordinates]] (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''y''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''y''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;The following discussion is based on {{Harvnb|Helgason|1994|pp=4&amp;ndash;5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Put ''p''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt; - ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;''y''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;. These are the homogeneous coordinates of the [[projective line]] joining ''x'' and ''y''. There are six independent coordinates and they satisfy a single relation, the [[Plücker coordinates|Plücker relation]]
:''p''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; + ''p''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt; ''p''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = 0.
It follows that there is a one-to-one correspondence between lines in '''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; and points on the [[Klein quadric]], which is the quadric hypersurface of points [''p''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt;] in '''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt; satisfying the Plücker relation.

The [[quadratic form]] defining the Plücker relation comes from a symmetric bilinear form of signature (3,3). In other words, the space of lines in '''R'''P&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; is the quadric in P('''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3,3&lt;/sup&gt;). Although this is not the same as the Lie quadric, a "correspondence" can be defined between lines and spheres using the [[complex number]]s: if '''x''' = (''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) is a point on the (complexified) Lie quadric (i.e., the ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; are taken to be complex numbers), then
: ''p''&lt;sub&gt;01&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;23&lt;/sub&gt; = –''x''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; + ''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
: ''p''&lt;sub&gt;02&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + i''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;31&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; – i''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;
: ''p''&lt;sub&gt;03&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; , ''p''&lt;sub&gt;12&lt;/sub&gt; = ''x''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;
defines a point on the complexified Klein quadric (where i&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = –1).

===Dupin cyclides===
[[File:Cyclide.png|right|200px|thumb|A Dupin cyclide.]]
Lie sphere geometry provides a natural description of [[Dupin cyclide]]s. These are characterized as the common envelope of two one parameter families of spheres ''S''(''s'') and ''T''(''t''), where ''S'' and ''T'' are maps from intervals into the Lie quadric. In order for a common envelope to exist, ''S''(''s'') and ''T''(''t'') must be incident for all ''s'' and ''t'', i.e., their representative vectors must span a null 2-dimensional subspace of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4,2&lt;/sup&gt;. Hence they define a map into the space of contact elements '''Z'''&lt;sup&gt;5&lt;/sup&gt;. This map is Legendrian if and only if the derivatives of ''S'' (or ''T'') are orthogonal to ''T'' (or ''S''), i.e., if and only if there is an orthogonal decomposition of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4,2&lt;/sup&gt; into a direct sum of 3-dimensional subspaces ''σ'' and ''τ'' of signature (2,1), such that ''S'' takes values in ''σ'' and ''T'' takes values in ''τ''. Conversely such a decomposition uniquely determines a contact lift of a surface which envelops two one parameter families of spheres; the image of this contact lift is given by the null 2-dimensional subspaces which intersect ''σ'' and ''τ'' in a pair of null lines.

Such a decomposition is equivalently given, up to a sign choice, by a symmetric endomorphism of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4,2&lt;/sup&gt; whose square is the identity and whose ±1 eigenspaces are ''σ'' and ''τ''. Using the inner product on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4,2&lt;/sup&gt;, this is determined by a quadratic form on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4,2&lt;/sup&gt;.

To summarize, Dupin cyclides are determined by quadratic forms on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4,2&lt;/sup&gt; such that the associated symmetric endomorphism has square equal to the identity and eigenspaces of signature (2,1).

This provides one way to see that Dupin cyclides are cyclides, in the sense that they are zero-sets of quartics of a particular form. For this, note that as in the planar case, 3-dimensional Euclidean space embeds into the Lie quadric ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; as the set of point spheres apart from the ideal point at infinity. Explicitly, the point (x,y,z) in Euclidean space corresponds to the point
:[0, ''x'', ''y'', ''z'', –1, (''x''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''y''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; + ''z''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)/2]
in ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. A cyclide consists of the points [0,''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;,''x''&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;] ∈ ''Q''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; which satisfy an additional quadratic relation
:&lt;math&gt;\sum_{i,j=1}^5 a_{ij}  x_i x_j =0&lt;/math&gt;
for some symmetric 5 ×; 5 matrix ''A'' = (''a''&lt;sub&gt;''ij''&lt;/sub&gt;). The class of cyclides is a natural family of surfaces in Lie sphere geometry, and the Dupin cyclides form a natural subfamily.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6610">'''[[Formal logic]] in [[China]]''' has a special place in the [[history of logic]] due to its repression and abandonment—in contrast to the strong ancient adoption and continued development of the study of [[logic]] in [[Europe]], India, and the [[Islamic world]].

==Mohist logic==
{{History of science and technology in China}}
In China, a contemporary of [[Confucius]], [[Mozi]], "Master Mo", is credited with founding the [[Mohist]] school,
whose canons dealt with issues relating to valid inference and the conditions of correct conclusions.  However, they were nonproductive and not integrated into Chinese science or mathematics.

The Mohist school of [[Chinese philosophy]] contained an approach to [[logic]] and [[argumentation]] that stresses  rhetorical analogies over mathematical reasoning, and is based on the ''three fa'', or methods of drawing distinctions between kinds of things.

One of the schools that grew out of [[Mohism]], the [[School of Names|Logicians]], are credited by some scholars for their early investigation of [[formal logic]].

==The repression of the study of logic==
During the subsequent [[Qin Dynasty]], the rule of [[Legalism (philosophy)|Legalism]] repressed this Mohist line of investigation, which has been said to have disappeared in China until the introduction of [[Indian philosophy]] and [[Indian logic]] by [[Buddhism|Buddhists]].&lt;ref&gt;Hajime Nakamura, Philip P. Wiener (1964). ''Ways of Thinking of Eastern Peoples: India-China-Tibet-Japan''. University of Hawaii Press. {{ISBN|0-8248-0078-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  A prominent scholar suggests that the version assembled for the Imperial Library of the Han Dynasty would probably have been as disorganised as the current extant text, and thus would have only been 'intermittently intelligible', as it is for current readers who do not consult a critical edition.&lt;ref&gt;A C Graham: Later Mohist Logic, Ethics and Science, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; Disagreeing with Hajime Nakamura, Graham argues the school of [[Neo-Taoism]] maintained some interest in the Canons, although they may already have some of the terminology difficult to understand.&lt;ref&gt;A C Graham: Later Mohist Logics, Ethics and Science, p 66.&lt;/ref&gt;  Before the end of the [[Sui Dynasty]], a shortened version of Mozi appeared, which appears to have replaced the Han edition.&lt;ref&gt;A C Graham 2003: Later Mohist Logics, Ethics and Science, p 68&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the original Mozi had been preserved in the Taoist, and became known once more in the 1552 Lu edition and 1553 Tang edition,&lt;ref&gt;A C Graham 2003: Later Mohist Logics, Ethics and Science, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; the damage was done: the dialectical chapters (as well as the military chapters) were considered incomprehensible.&lt;ref&gt;A C Graham 2003: Later Mohist Logic, Ethics and Science, p. 69-70.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, with the rise of Chinese critical textual scholarship, the book benefited from explanatory and critical commentaries: first, by Bi Yuan, and his assistant, Sun Xingyan; another commentary by Wang Chong, which has not survived; 'the first special study',&lt;ref name="Graham_70"&gt;A C Graham 2003: Later Mohist Logic, Ethics and Science, p. 70&lt;/ref&gt; by Zhang Huiyan; a republication of Part B by Wu Rulun.  However, the summit of this late Imperial scholarship, according to Graham, was the 'magnificent' commentary of Sun Yirang, which 'threw open the sanctum of the Canons to all comers.&lt;ref name="Graham_70"/&gt;  Graham summarises the arduous textual history of the Canons by arguing that the Canons were neglected throughout most of China's history; but he attributes this fact to 'bibliographical' accidents, rather than political repression, like Nakamura.&lt;ref&gt;A C Graham 2003: Later Mohist Logic, Ethics and Science, p. 72.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Buddhist logic==
{{main|Buddhist logic}}

The study of logic in China was revived following the transmission of [[Buddhism in China]], which introduced the [[Buddhist logic]]al tradition that began in [[Indian logic]]. Buddhist logic has been often misunderstood by scholars of Chinese Buddhism because they lack the necessary background in [[Indian logic]].&lt;ref&gt;See Eli Franco, "Xuanzang's proof of idealism." Horin 11 (2004): 199-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3210">'''Lot quality assurance sampling (LQAS)''' is a [[random sampling]] methodology, originally developed in the 1920s &lt;ref name="DodgeRomig1929"&gt;Dodge, H.F., &amp; Romig, H.G. (1929). [https://archive.org/details/bstj8-4-613 "A method of sampling inspection."] ''Bell System Technical Journal'' 8: 613–31.&lt;/ref&gt; as a method of [[quality control]] in industrial production. Compared to similar sampling techniques like [[stratified sampling|stratified]] and [[cluster sampling]], LQAS provides less information but often requires substantially smaller sample sizes.

==Summary==
LQAS, sometimes called "acceptance sampling",&lt;ref name="LemeshowTaber1991"&gt;Lemeshow, S. &amp; Taber, S. (1991). Lot quality assurance sampling: single- and double-sampling plans". ''World Health Statistics Quarterly'', 44(3), 115-32. {{PMID|1949879}}&lt;/ref&gt; involves taking a small [[random sample]] from each set of items in the population, and testing each sampled item to determine whether it meets a predetermined standard of quality. LQAS is functionally identical to [[stratified sampling]] (where each lot is a single stratum), but requires smaller samples because it does not attempt to construct a precise estimate of population parameters. Instead, after sampling, a researcher using LQAS performs a [[Statistical inference|hypothesis test]] to determine whether the number of elements of interest in each lot (e.g. defective units in manufacturing, or persons with a particular medical condition in epidemiology) is likely to be greater than a predetermined threshold.

==Use==
LQAS was originally designed for use in manufacturing, where it provided a way to perform statistically valid quality-assurance testing at minimum cost. In the context of modern research, LQAS has become an accepted sampling method in the fields of public health and international development. For example, in 1996 the [[World Health Organization]] issued a document&lt;ref name="WHO1996"&gt;Robertson, S. (1996). [http://extranet.who.int/ivb_docs/documents/1049 ''Monitoring immunization services using the Lot Quality Technique.''] World Health Organization: Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt; describing LQAS, and recommended it for use in surveys to determine the number of children immunized against disease.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16095">The [[art]] of  [[origami]] or paper folding has received a considerable amount of [[mathematics|mathematical]] study. Fields of interest include a given paper model's flat-foldability (whether the model can be flattened without damaging it) and the use of paper folds to solve [[equation|mathematical equations]].

==History==
In 1893, Indian mathematician [[T. Sundara Rao]] published "Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding" which used paper folding to demonstrate proofs of geometrical constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Geometric Exercises in Paper Folding |author= T. Sundara Rao |url=http://name.umdl.umich.edu/ACV5060.0001.001  |publisher=Addison |year=1893}}&lt;/ref&gt; This work was inspired by the use of origami in the [[kindergarten]] system. This book had an approximate trisection of angles and implied construction of a cube root was impossible. In 1936 [[Margherita Piazzola Beloch|Margharita P. Beloch]] showed that use of the 'Beloch fold', later used in the sixth of the [[Huzita–Hatori axioms]], allowed the general cubic equation to be solved using origami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Huzita ed. (1989), pp. 251–261.&lt;/ref&gt; but were overlooked until the first six were rediscovered by [[Humiaki Huzita]] in 1991. The first International Meeting of Origami Science and Technology (now known as the International Conference on Origami in Science, Math, and Education) was held in 1989 in Ferrara, Italy.

===Flat folding===
[[Image:Maekawas Theorem.svg|thumb|100px|Mountain-valley counting]]
[[Image:Lang rule one.png|thumb|100px|Two-colorability]]
[[Image:Lang rule three.png|thumb|100px|Angles around a vertex]]

The construction of origami models is sometimes shown as crease patterns. The major question about such crease patterns is whether a given crease pattern can be folded to a flat model, and if so, how to fold them; this is an [[NP complete|NP-complete problem]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |year=2002 |publisher=AK Peters |isbn=978-1-56881-181-9
|chapterurl=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1307.1065.pdf
|title=The Proceedings of the Third International Meeting of Origami Science, Mathematics, and Education
|author=Thomas C. Hull |chapter=The Combinatorics of Flat Folds: a Survey
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related problems when the creases are orthogonal are called [[map folding]] problems. There are three mathematical rules for producing flat-foldable origami [[crease pattern]]s:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ted.com/index.php/talks/robert_lang_folds_way_new_origami.html | title=Robert Lang folds way-new origami}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Maekawa's theorem]]: at any vertex the number of valley and mountain folds always differ by two.
#: It follows from this that every vertex has an even number of creases, and therefore also the regions between the creases can be colored with two colors.
# [[Kawasaki's theorem]]: at any vertex, the sum of all the odd angles adds up to 180 degrees, as do the even.
# A sheet can never penetrate a fold.

Paper exhibits zero [[Gaussian curvature]] at all points on its surface, and only folds naturally along lines of zero curvature.  Curved surfaces that can't be flattened can be produced using a non-folded crease in the paper, as is easily done with wet paper or a fingernail.

Assigning a crease pattern mountain and valley folds in order to produce a flat model has been proven by [[Marshall Bern]] and [[Barry Hayes]] to be [[NP-complete]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference

===Huzita–Hatori axioms===
{{main article|Huzita–Hatori axioms}}

Some [[Compass and straightedge constructions#Impossible constructions|classical construction problems of geometry]] — namely [[trisecting an arbitrary angle]] or [[doubling the cube]] — are proven to be unsolvable using [[compass and straightedge]], but can be solved using only a few paper folds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/omfiles/geoconst.html |title=Origami and Geometric Constructions |author=Tom Hull}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paper fold strips can be constructed to solve equations up to degree 4. The Huzita–Hatori axioms are an important contribution to this field of study. These describe what can be constructed using a sequence of creases with at most two point or line alignments at once. Complete methods for solving all equations up to degree 4 by applying methods satisfying these axioms are discussed in detail in ''Geometric Origami''.&lt;ref name="GO-Geretsch"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Constructions==

As a result of origami study through the application of geometric principles, methods such as Haga's theorem have allowed paperfolders to accurately fold the side of a square into thirds, fifths, sevenths, and ninths. Other theorems and methods have allowed paperfolders to get other shapes from a square, such as equilateral [[triangles]], [[pentagons]], [[hexagons]], and special rectangles such as the [[golden rectangle]] and the [[silver rectangle]]. Methods for folding most regular polygons up to and including the regular 19-gon have been developed.&lt;ref name="GO-Geretsch"/&gt; A regular ''n''-gon can be constructed by paper folding if and only if &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt;(''n'') is 3-[[smooth number|smooth]], where &lt;math&gt;\varphi&lt;/math&gt; is [[Euler's totient function]].

===Haga's theorems===
[[File:Haga theorem 1.svg|thumb|200px|BQ is always a rational if AP is.]]
The side of a square can be divided at an arbitrary rational fraction in a variety of ways. Haga's theorems say that a particular set of constructions can be used for such divisions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://origami.gr.jp/Archives/People/CAGE_/divide/02-e.html
|title=How to Divide the Side of Square Paper
|author=Koshiro |publisher=Japan Origami Academic Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surprisingly few folds are necessary to generate large odd fractions. For instance {{Frac|1|5}} can be generated with three folds; first halve a side, then use Haga's theorem twice to produce first {{Frac|2|3}} and then {{Frac|1|5}}.

The accompanying diagram shows Haga's first theorem:

:&lt;math&gt;BQ = \frac{2 AP}{1 + AP}.&lt;/math&gt;

The function changing the length ''AP'' to ''QC'' is [[Involution (mathematics)|self inverse]]. Let ''x'' be ''AP'' then a number of other lengths are also rational  functions of ''x''. For example:

{| class="wikitable" border="1" style="text-align:center; width:200px; height:200px" border="1"
|+Haga's first theorem
|-
! AP !! BQ !! QC !! AR !! PQ

| &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{2 x}{1+x}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{1-x}{1+x}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{1-x^2}{2}&lt;/math&gt; || &lt;math&gt;\frac{1+x^2}{1+x}&lt;/math&gt;

===Doubling the cube===
[[Image:Delian origami.svg|thumb|200px|Doubling the cube: PB/PA = cube root of 2]]
The classical problem of [[doubling the cube]] can be solved using origami. This construction is due to Peter Messer:&lt;ref name="lang2008"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://static.usenix.org/event/usenix08/tech/slides/lang.pdf |title=From Flapping Birds to Space Telescopes: The Modern Science of Origami  |last=Lang |first=Robert J |year=2008 |publisher=Usenix Conference, Boston, MA}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A square of paper is first creased into three equal strips as shown in the diagram. Then the bottom edge is positioned so the corner point P is on the top edge and the crease mark on the edge meets the other crease mark Q. The length PB will then be the cube root of 2 times the length of AP.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter Messer|title=Problem 1054|journal=[[Crux Mathematicorum]]|volume=12|issue=10|year=1986|pages=284–285.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The edge with the crease mark is considered a marked straightedge, something which is not allowed in [[compass and straightedge constructions]].  Using a marked straightedge in this way is called a [[neusis construction]] in geometry.
{{clear}}

===Trisecting an angle===
[[File:Origami Trisection of an angle.svg|thumb|200px|Trisecting the angle CAB]]
[[Angle trisection]] is another of the classical problems that cannot be solved using a compass and unmarked ruler but can be solved using origami. This construction is due to Hisashi Abe.&lt;ref name="lang2008" /&gt;  The angle CAB is trisected by making  folds PP' and QQ' parallel to the base with QQ' halfway in between. Then point P is folded over to lie on line AC and at the same time point A is made to lie on line QQ' at A'. The angle A'AB is one third of the original angle CAB. This is because PAQ, A'AQ and A'AR are three [[Congruence (geometry)#Congruence of triangles|congruent]] triangles. Aligning the two points on the two lines is another neusis construction as in the solution to doubling the cube.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Origami 5 |chapter=Hands-on Geometry with Origami |author1= Michael J Winckler |author2=Kathrin D Wold |author3=Hans Georg Bock |page=225 |isbn=978-1-56881-714-9 |year=2011 |publisher=CRC Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Related problems==

The problem of [[rigid origami]], treating the folds as hinges joining two flat, rigid surfaces, such as [[sheet metal]], has great practical importance. For example, the [[Miura map fold]] is a rigid fold that has been used to deploy large solar panel arrays for space satellites.

The [[napkin folding problem]] is the problem of whether a square or rectangle of paper can be folded so the perimeter of the flat figure is greater than that of the original square.

Curved origami also poses a (very different) set of mathematical challenges.&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.siggraph.org/s2008/attendees/design/22.php Siggraph: "Curved Origami"]
&lt;/ref&gt;
Curved origami allows the paper to form [[developable surface]]s that are not flat.

[[Wet-folding]] origami allows an even greater range of shapes.

The maximum number of times an incompressible material can be folded has been derived. With each fold a certain amount of paper is lost to potential folding.  The [[loss function]] for folding paper in half in a single direction was given to be &lt;math&gt;L=\tfrac{\pi t}{6} (2^n + 4)(2^n - 1)&lt;/math&gt;, where ''L'' is the minimum length of the paper (or other material), ''t'' is the material's thickness, and ''n'' is the number of folds possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Korpal|first1=Gaurish|title=Folding Paper in Half|journal=At Right Angles|date=25 November 2015|volume=4|issue=3|pages=20–23|url=http://teachersofindia.org/en/ebook/folding-paper-half}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The distances ''L'' and ''t'' must be expressed in the same units, such as inches. This result was derived by [[Britney Gallivan|Gallivan]] in 2001, who also folded a sheet of paper in half 12 times, contrary to the popular belief that paper of any size could be folded at most eight times. She also derived the equation for folding in alternate directions.&lt;ref name="Mathworld"&gt;
{{MathWorld | title = Folding | urlname = Folding}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[fold-and-cut problem]] asks what shapes can be obtained by folding a piece of paper flat, and making a single straight complete cut. The solution, known as the fold-and-cut theorem, states that any shape with straight sides can be obtained.

A practical problem is how to fold a map so that it may be manipulated with minimal effort or movements. The [[Miura fold]] is a solution to the problem, and several others have been proposed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|jstor = 25678354|title = In search of a practical map fold|last = Hull|first = Thomas|date = 2002|journal = Math Horizons|doi = |pmid = |pages = 22–24|volume = 3|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8578">In [[mathematics]], in the areas of [[order theory]] and [[combinatorics]], '''Mirsky's theorem''' characterizes the height of any finite [[partially ordered set]] in terms of a partition of the order into a minimum number of [[antichain]]s. It is named for {{harvs|first=Leon|last=Mirsky|authorlink=Leon Mirsky|year=1971|txt}} and is closely related to [[Dilworth's theorem]] on the widths of partial orders, to the [[perfect graph|perfection]] of [[comparability graph]]s, to the [[Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem]] relating [[longest path problem|longest paths]] and [[graph coloring|colorings]] in graphs, and to the [[Erdős–Szekeres theorem]] on monotonic subsequences.

==The theorem==
The height of a partially ordered set is defined to be the maximum cardinality of a [[antichain|chain]], a [[total order|totally ordered]] subset of the given partial order. For instance, in the set of positive integers from 1 to ''N'', ordered by [[divisibility]], one of the largest chains consists of the [[power of two|powers of two]] that lie within that range, from which it follows that the height of this partial order is &lt;math&gt;1+\lfloor\log_2 N\rfloor&lt;/math&gt;.

Mirsky's theorem states that, for every finite partially ordered set, the height also equals the minimum number of antichains (subsets in which no pair of elements are ordered) into which the set may be partitioned. In such a partition, every two elements of the longest chain must go into two different antichains, so the number of antichains is always greater than or equal to the height; another formulation of Mirsky's theorem is that there always exists a partition for which the number of antichains equals the height. Again, in the example of positive integers ordered by divisibility, the numbers can be partitioned into the antichains {1}, {2,3}, {4,5,6,7}, etc. There are &lt;math&gt;1+\lfloor\log_2 N\rfloor&lt;/math&gt; sets in this partition, and within each of these sets, every pair of numbers forms a ratio less than two, so no two numbers within one of these sets can be divisible.

To prove the existence of a partition into a small number of antichains for an arbitrary finite partially ordered set, consider for every element ''x'' the chains that have ''x'' as their largest element, and let ''N''(''x'') denote the size of the largest of these ''x''-maximal chains. Then each set ''N''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''i''), consisting of elements that have equal values of ''N'', is an antichain, and these antichains partition the partial order into a number of antichains equal to the size of the largest chain. In his original proof, Mirsky constructs the same partition inductively, by choosing an antichain of the maximal elements of longest chains, and showing that the length of the longest chain among the remaining elements is reduced by one.

==Related results==
===Dilworth's theorem===
Mirsky was inspired by [[Dilworth's theorem]], stating that, for every partially ordered set, the maximum size of an antichain equals the minimum number of chains in a partition of the set into chains. For sets of [[order dimension]] two, the two theorems coincide (a chain in the [[majorization]] ordering of points in general position in the plane is an antichain in the set of points formed by a 90° rotation from the original set, and vice versa) but for more general partial orders the two theorems differ, and (as Mirsky observes) Dilworth's theorem is more difficult to prove.

Mirsky's theorem and Dilworth's theorem are also related to each other through the theory of [[perfect graph]]s. An undirected graph is [[Perfect graph|perfect]] if, in every [[induced subgraph]], the [[chromatic number]] equals the size of the largest clique. In the [[comparability graph]] of a partially ordered set, a clique represents a chain and a coloring represents a partition into antichains, and induced subgraphs of comparability graphs are themselves comparability graphs, so Mirsky's theorem states that comparability graphs are perfect. Analogously, Dilworth's theorem states that every [[complement graph]] of a comparability graph is perfect. The [[perfect graph theorem]] of {{harvtxt|Lovász|1972}} states that the complements of perfect graphs are always perfect, and can be used to deduce Dilworth's theorem from Mirsky's theorem and vice versa {{harv|Golumbic|1980}}.

===Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem===
Mirsky's theorem can be restated in terms of [[directed acyclic graph]]s (representing a partially ordered set by [[reachability]] of their vertices), as the statement that there exists a [[graph homomorphism]] from a given directed acyclic graph ''G'' to a ''k''-vertex [[Tournament (graph theory)|transitive tournament]] if and only if there does not exist a homomorphism from a (''k''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1)-vertex [[path graph]] to ''G''. For, the largest path graph that has a homomorphism to ''G'' gives the longest chain in the reachability ordering, and the sets of vertices with the same image in a homomorphism to a transitive tournament form a partition into antichains. This statement generalizes to the case that ''G'' is not acyclic, and is a form of the [[Gallai–Hasse–Roy–Vitaver theorem]] on [[graph coloring]]s and [[Orientation (graph theory)|orientations]] {{harv|Nešetřil|Ossona de Mendez|2012}}.

===Erdős–Szekeres theorem===
It follows from either Dilworth's theorem or Mirsky's theorem that, in every partially ordered set of ''rs''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 elements, there must exist either a chain of ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 elements or an antichain of ''s''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 elements. {{harvtxt|Mirsky|1971}} uses this observation, applied to a partial order of order dimension two, to prove the [[Erdős–Szekeres theorem]] that in every sequence of ''rs''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 totally ordered elements there must exist either a monotonically increasing subsequence of ''r''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 elements or a monotonically decreasing subsequence of ''s''&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1 elements.

==Extensions==
Mirsky's theorem extends immediately to infinite partially ordered sets with finite height. However, the relation between the length of a chain and the number of antichains in a partition into antichains does not extend to infinite cardinalities: for every infinite [[cardinal number]] &amp;kappa;, there exist partially ordered sets that have no infinite chain and that do not have an antichain partition with &amp;kappa; or fewer antichains {{harv|Schmerl|2002}}.

[[Simply connected space]]s and [[simple space]]s are (trivial) examples of nilpotent spaces, other examples are connected loop spaces. The homotopy fibre of 
any map between nilpotent spaces is a disjoint union of nilpotent spaces, the null component of the pointed mapping space Map_*(''K'',''X'') where ''K'' is a pointed  finite dimensional CW complex and ''X'' is any pointed space, is a nilpotent space. The odd-dimensional real projective spaces are nilpotent spaces, while the projective plane is not.  A basic theorem about nilpotent spaces &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Dror|first=Emmanuel|date=1971|title=A generalization of whitehead theorem|url=|publisher=Springer|series=Lecture Notes in Mathematics|volume=249|issue=|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;states  that any  map that induces an integral homology isomorphism between two nilpotent space is a weak homotopy equivalence.   Nilpotent spaces are of great interest in [[rational homotopy theory]], because most constructions applicable to simply connected spaces can be extended to nilpotent spaces.  The Bousfield Kan nilpotent completion of a space associates with any connected pointed space ''X'' a universal space  ''X''^  through which any map of ''X'' to a nilpotent space ''N'' factors uniquely up to contractible space of choices, often however, ''X''^ itself is not nilpotent but only an inverse limit of  a tower of nilpotent spaces.  This tower, as a pro-space, always models the homology type of the given pointed space ''X''. Nilpotent spaces admit a good arithmetic localization theory in the sense of Bousfield and Kan cited above, and the unstable Adams spectral sequence strongly converges 
for any such space. 

Let ''X'' be a nilpotent space  and let ''h'' be a reduced generalized homology theory, such as K-theory.
If ''h''(''X'')=0, then ''h'' vanishes on any Postnikov section of ''X''. This follows from a theorem that states that
any such section is ''X''-cellular.

      <model>wikitext</model>

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5081">{{refimprove|date=September 2012}}
In [[mathematics]], a '''nowhere continuous function''', also called an '''everywhere discontinuous function''', is a [[function (mathematics)|function]] that is not [[continuous function|continuous]] at any point of its [[domain of a function|domain]]. If ''f'' is a function from [[real number]]s to real numbers, then ''f'' is nowhere continuous if for each point ''x'' there is an {{nowrap|''ε'' &gt; 0}} such that for each {{nowrap|''δ'' &gt; 0}} we can find a point ''y'' such that {{nowrap|0 &lt; {{abs|''x'' &amp;minus; ''y''}} &lt; ''δ''}} and {{nowrap|{{abs|''f''(''x'') &amp;minus; ''f''(''y'')}} ≥ ''ε''}}. Therefore, no matter how close we get to any fixed point, there are even closer points at which the function takes not-nearby values.

More general definitions of this kind of function can be obtained, by replacing the [[absolute value]] by the distance function in a [[metric space]], or by using the definition of continuity in a [[topological space]].

==Dirichlet function==
One example of such a function is the [[indicator function]] of the [[rational number]]s, also known as the '''Dirichlet function''', named after German mathematician [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].&lt;ref&gt;Lejeune Dirichlet, P. G. (1829) "Sur la convergence des séries trigonométriques qui servent à répresenter une fonction arbitraire entre des limites donées" [On the convergence of trigonometric series which serve to represent an arbitrary function between given limits], ''Journal für reine und angewandte Mathematik'' [Journal for pure and applied mathematics (also known as ''Crelle's Journal'')], vol. 4, pages 157–169.&lt;/ref&gt;  This function is denoted as ''I''&lt;sub&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/sub&gt; and has [[domain of a function|domain]] and [[codomain]] both equal to the [[real number]]s.  ''I''&lt;sub&gt;'''Q'''&lt;/sub&gt;(''x'') equals 1 if ''x'' is a [[rational number]] and 0 if ''x'' is not rational.  If we look at this function in the vicinity of some number ''y'', there are two cases: 
*If ''y'' is rational, then {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 1}}. To show the function is not continuous at ''y'', we need to find an ''ε'' such that no matter how small we choose ''δ'', there will be points ''z'' within ''δ'' of ''y'' such that ''f''(''z'') is not within ''ε'' of {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 1}}.  In fact, 1/2 is such an ''ε''.  Because the [[irrational number]]s are [[dense set|dense]] in the reals, no matter what ''δ'' we choose we can always find an irrational ''z'' within ''δ'' of ''y'', and {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') = 0}} is at least 1/2 away from 1. 
*If ''y'' is irrational, then {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 0}}. Again, we can take {{nowrap|1=''ε'' = 1/2}}, and this time, because the rational numbers are dense in the reals, we can pick ''z'' to be a rational number as close to ''y'' as is required. Again, {{nowrap|1=''f''(''z'') = 1}} is more than 1/2 away from {{nowrap|1=''f''(''y'') = 0}}.
In less rigorous terms, between any two irrationals, there is a rational, and vice versa.

The Dirichlet function can be constructed as the double pointwise limit of a sequence of continuous functions, as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;f(x)=\lim_{k\to\infty}\left(\lim_{j\to\infty}\left(\cos(k!\pi x)\right)^{2j}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

for integer ''j'' and ''k''.

This shows that the Dirichlet function is a [[Baire function|Baire class]] 2 function. It cannot be a Baire class 1 function because a Baire class 1 function can only be discontinuous on a [[meagre set]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In general, if ''E'' is any subset of a [[topological space]] ''X'' such that both ''E'' and the complement of ''E'' are dense in ''X'', then the real-valued function which takes the value 1 on ''E'' and 0 on the complement of ''E'' will be nowhere continuous. Functions of this type were originally investigated by [[Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet]].

==Hyperreal characterisation==
A real function ''f'' is nowhere continuous if its natural [[Hyperreal number|hyperreal]] extension has the property that every ''x'' is infinitely close to a ''y'' such that the difference {{nowrap|''f''(''x'') − ''f''(''y'')}} is appreciable (i.e., not [[infinitesimal]]).

'''Paul Richard Halmos''' ({{lang-hu|Halmos Pál}}; March 3, 1916 – October 2, 2006) was a [[Hungarian-Jewish]]-born [[United States|American]] [[mathematician]] who made fundamental advances in the areas of [[mathematical logic]], [[probability theory]], [[statistics]], [[operator theory]], [[ergodic theory]], and [[functional analysis]] (in particular, [[Hilbert space]]s). He was also recognized as a great mathematical expositor. According to [[György Marx]], Halmos was one of [[The Martians (scientists)|The Martians]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://fizikaiszemle.hu/archivum/fsz9703/marsl.html A marslakók legendája - [[György Marx]] ]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and education==
Halmos arrived in the U.S. at 13 years of age. He obtained his B.A. from the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]], majoring in mathematics, but fulfilling the requirements for both a math and philosophy degree. He took only three years to obtain the degree, and was only 19 when he graduated. He then began a Ph.D. in philosophy, still at the [[Champaign-Urbana]] campus; but, after failing his masters' oral exams,&lt;ref&gt;The Legend of John Von Neumann. P. R. Halmos. The American Mathematical Monthly, Vol. 80, No. 4. (Apr., 1973), pp.&amp;nbsp;382–394.&lt;/ref&gt; he shifted to mathematics, graduating in 1938. [[Joseph L. Doob]] supervised his dissertation, titled ''Invariants of Certain Stochastic Transformations: The Mathematical Theory of Gambling Systems''.&lt;ref&gt;Halmos, Paul R. [http://projecteuclid.org/euclid.dmj/1077491241 "Invariants of certain stochastic transformations: The mathematical theory of gambling systems."] Duke Mathematical Journal 5, no. 2 (1939): 461–478.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Shortly after his graduation, Halmos left for the [[Institute for Advanced Study]], lacking both job and grant money. Six months later, he was working under [[John von Neumann]], which proved a decisive experience. While at the Institute, Halmos wrote his first book, ''Finite Dimensional Vector Spaces'', which immediately established his reputation as a fine expositor of mathematics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Paul Halmos: Maverick Mathologist | first=Donald J. | last=Albers | journal=[[Two-Year College Mathematics Journal]] | volume=13 | number=4 | year=1982 | pages=226–242 | publisher=[[Mathematical Association of America]] | jstor=3027125 | doi=10.2307/3027125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Halmos taught at [[Syracuse University]], the [[University of Chicago]] (1946–60), the [[University of Michigan]] (~1961–67), the [[University of California at Santa Barbara]] (1976–78), the [[University of Hawaii]], and [[Indiana University]]. From his 1985 retirement from Indiana until his death, he was affiliated with the Mathematics department at [[Santa Clara University]].

==Accomplishments==
In a series of papers reprinted in his 1962 ''Algebraic Logic'', Halmos devised [[polyadic algebra]]s, an algebraic version of [[first-order logic]] differing from the better known [[cylindric algebra]]s of [[Alfred Tarski]] and his students. An elementary version of polyadic algebra is described in [[monadic Boolean algebra]].

In addition to his original contributions to mathematics, Halmos was an unusually clear and engaging expositor of university mathematics. He won the [[Lester R. Ford Award]] in 1971&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Halmos, Paul R.|title=Finite-dimensional Hilbert spaces|journal=Amer. Math. Monthly|volume=77|year=1970|pages=457–464|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/finite-dimensional-hilbert-spaces|doi=10.2307/2317378}}&lt;/ref&gt; and again in 1977 (shared with W. P. Ziemer, W. H. Wheeler, S. H. Moolgavkar, J. H. Ewing and W. H. Gustafson).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ziemer, William P.|author2=Wheeler, William H.|author3=Moolgavkar|author4=Halmos, Paul R.|author5=Ewing, John H.|author6=Gustafson, William H.|title=American mathematics from 1940 to the day before yesterday|journal=Amer.

Monthly|volume=83|year=1976|pages=503–516|url=http://www.maa.org/programs/maa-awards/writing-awards/american-mathematics-from-1940-to-the-day-before-yesterday|doi=10.2307/2319347}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halmos chaired the [[American Mathematical Society]] committee that wrote the AMS style guide for academic mathematics, published in 1973. In 1983, he received the AMS's Steele Prize for exposition.

In the ''American Scientist'' 56(4): 375–389, Halmos argued that mathematics is a creative art, and that mathematicians should be seen as artists, not number crunchers. He discussed the division of the field into mathology and mathophysics, further arguing that mathematicians and painters think and work in related ways.

Halmos's 1985 "automathography" ''I Want to Be a Mathematician'' is an account of what it was like to be an academic mathematician in 20th century America.  He called the book "automathography" rather than "autobiography", because its focus is almost entirely on his life as a mathematician, not his personal life.  The book contains the following quote on Halmos' view of what doing mathematics means:

{{quote|Don't just read it; fight it! Ask your own questions, look for your own examples, discover your own proofs. Is the hypothesis necessary? Is the converse true? What happens in the classical special case? What about the degenerate cases? Where does the proof use the hypothesis?}}

{{quote box

|quote=What does it take to be [a mathematician]? I think I know the answer: you have to be born right, you must continually strive to become perfect, you must love mathematics more than anything else, you must work at it hard and without stop, and you must never give up.
|source= — Paul Halmos, 1985
}}

In these memoirs, Halmos claims to have invented the "iff" notation for the words "[[if and only if]]" and to have been the first to use the [[tombstone (typography)|"tombstone"]] notation to signify the [[Q.E.D.|end of a proof]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

The tombstone symbol ∎ ([[Unicode]] U+220E) is sometimes called a ''halmos''.&lt;ref&gt;"The symbol is definitely not my invention&amp;nbsp;— it appeared in popular magazines (not mathematical ones) before I adopted it, but, once again, I seem to have introduced it into mathematics.

It is most frequently called the 'tombstone', but at least one generous author referred to it as the 'halmos'.", Halmos (1985) p. 403.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Halmos and his wife Virginia funded the [[Euler Book Prize]], an annual award given by the [[Mathematical Association of America]] for a book that is likely to improve the view of mathematics among the public. The first prize was given in 2007, the 300th anniversary of [[Leonhard Euler]]'s birth, to [[John Derbyshire]] for his book about [[Bernhard Riemann]] and the [[Riemann hypothesis]]: [[Prime Obsession]].&lt;ref name="maa"&gt;[http://www.maa.org/awards/eulerbook.html The Mathematical Association of America's Euler Book Prize], retrieved 2011-02-01.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computational geometry]], a '''polyhedral terrain''' in three-dimensional [[Euclidean space]] is a [[polyhedral surface]] that intersects every line parallel to some particular line in a connected set (i.e., a point or a [[line segment]]) or the empty set.&lt;ref name=ks&gt;Richard Cole, [[Micha Sharir]], "Visibility problems for polyhedral terrains" 1989, {{doi|10.1016/S0747-7171(89)80003-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Without loss of generality]], we may assume that the line in question is the ''z''-axis of the Cartesian coordinate system. Then a polyhedral terrain is the image of a [[piecewise-linear function]] in ''x'' and ''y'' variables.&lt;ref name=SaUr&gt;''Handbook in Computational Geometry'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=uZdAqAWB3BcC&amp;pg=PA352 p. 352 ]&lt;/ref&gt;

The polyhedral terrain is a generalization of the two-dimensional geometric object, the [[monotone polygonal chain]].

As the name may suggest, a major application area of polyhedral terrains include [[geographic information systems]] to model real-world [[terrain]]s.&lt;ref name=SaUr/&gt;

==Representation==

A polyhedral model may be represented in terms of the partition of the plane into polygonal regions, each region being associated with a plane patch which is the image of points of the region under the piecewise-linear function in question.&lt;ref name=SaUr/&gt;

==Problems==
There are a number of problems in computational geometry which involve polyhedral terrains.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1855">In [[type theory]], a [[type system]] is said to have the '''principal type''' property if, given a term and an environment, there exists a '''principal type''' for this term in this environment, i.e. a type such that all other types for this term in this environment are an [[instance (type theory)|instance]] of the principal type.

The principal type property is a desirable one for a type system, as it provides a way to type expressions in a given environment with a type which encompasses all of the expressions' possible types, instead of having several incomparable possible types. [[Type inference]] for systems with the principal type property will usually attempt to infer the principal type.

For instance, the [[ML (programming language)|ML]] system has the principal type property and principal types for an expression can be computed by [[Robinson's unification algorithm]], which is used by the [[Hindley&amp;ndash;Milner type inference]] algorithm. However, many extensions to the type system of ML, such as [[polymorphic recursion]], can make the inference of the principal type undecidable. Other extensions, such as [[Haskell (programming language)|Haskell]]'s [[generalized algebraic data type]]s, destroy the principal type property of the language, requiring the use of [[type annotation]]s or the compiler to "guess" the intended type from among several options.

The principal type property should not be confused with the '''principal typing''' property which requires that, given a term, there exist a typing (i.e. a pair with a context and a type) which is an instance of all possible typings of the term.&lt;ref&gt;[http://trevorjim.com/papers/principal-typings.ps.gz  Trevor Jim (1995), "Principal typings" MIT memorandum]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3135">'''Provability logic''' is a [[modal logic]], in which the box (or "necessity") operator is interpreted as 'it is provable that'. The point is to capture the notion of a proof predicate of a reasonably rich [[theory (mathematical logic)|formal theory]], such as [[Peano arithmetic]]. 

==Examples==
There are a number of provability logics, some of which are covered in the literature mentioned in the References section. The basic system is generally referred to as GL (for [[Kurt Gödel|Gödel]]-[[Martin Hugo Löb|Löb]]) or L or K4W. It can be obtained by adding the modal version of [[Löb's theorem]] to the logic K (or K4). 

Namely, the '''axioms''' of GL are all tautologies of classical propositional logic plus all formulas of one of the following forms: 
* '''Distribution Axiom''': {{math|□(''p'' → ''q'') → (□''p'' → □''q'');}}
* '''Löb's Axiom''': {{math|□(□''p'' → ''p'') → □''p''.}}
And the '''rules of inference''' are:
* '''Modus Ponens''': From ''p'' → ''q'' and ''p'' conclude ''q'';
* '''Necessitation''': From &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; ''p'' conclude &lt;math&gt;\vdash&lt;/math&gt; {{math|□''p''}}.

==History==
The GL model was pioneered by [[Robert M. Solovay]] in 1976. Since then, until his death in 1996, the prime inspirer of the field was [[George Boolos]]. Significant contributions to the field have been made by [[Sergei N. Artemov]], Lev Beklemishev, [[Giorgi Japaridze]], [[Dick de Jongh]], Franco Montagna, Giovanni Sambin, Vladimir Shavrukov, Albert Visser and others.

==Generalizations==
[[Interpretability logic]]s and [[Japaridze's polymodal logic]] present natural extensions of provability logic.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5333">In mathematics, a '''multisection''' of a power series is a new [[power series]] composed of equally spaced terms extracted unaltered from the original series. Formally, if one is given a power series

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=-\infty}^\infty a_n\cdot z^n&lt;/math&gt;

then its multisection is a power series of the form

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=-\infty}^\infty a_{qm+p}\cdot z^{qm+p}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''p'', ''q'' are integers, with 0 ≤ ''p'' &lt; ''q''.

== Multisection of analytic functions ==
A multisection of the series of an [[analytic function]]

: &lt;math&gt;f(z) = \sum_{n=0}^\infty a_n\cdot z^n&lt;/math&gt;

has a [[closed-form expression]] in terms of the function &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty a_{qm+p}\cdot z^{qm+p} = \frac{1}{q}\cdot \sum_{k=0}^{q-1} \omega^{-kp}\cdot f(\omega^k\cdot z),&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\omega = e^{\frac{2\pi i}{q}}&lt;/math&gt; is a [[Primitive nth root of unity|primitive ''q''-th root of unity]].  This solution was first discovered by [[Thomas Simpson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Simpson |first1=Thomas |date=1757 |title=CIII. The invention of a general method for determining the sum of every 2d, 3d, 4th, or 5th, &amp;c. term of a series, taken in order; the sum of the whole series being known |url= |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London |volume=51 |pages=757-759 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1757.0104}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This expression is especially useful in that it can convert an infinite sum into a finite sum.  It is used, for example, in a key step of a standard proof of [[Gauss's digamma theorem]], which gives a closed-form solution to the digamma function evaluated at rational values ''p''/''q''.

== Examples ==

===Bisection===
In general, the bisections of a series are the [[even and odd functions|even and odd]] parts of the series.

===Geometric series===
Consider the [[geometric series]]

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} z^n=\frac{1}{1-z} \quad\text{ for }|z| &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

By setting &lt;math&gt;z \rightarrow z^q&lt;/math&gt; in the above series, its multisections are easily seen to be

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^{\infty} z^{qm+p} = \frac{z^p}{1-z^q} \quad\text{ for }|z| &lt; 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Remembering that the sum of the multisections must equal the original series, we recover the familiar identity

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{p=0}^{q-1} z^p = \frac{1-z^q}{1-z}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Exponential function===
The exponential function

: &lt;math&gt;e^z=\sum_{n=0}^{\infty} {z^n \over n!}&lt;/math&gt;

by means of the above formula for analytic functions separates into

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty {z^{qm+p} \over (qm+p)!} = \frac{1}{q}\cdot \sum_{k=0}^{q-1} \omega^{-kp} e^{\omega^k z}.&lt;/math&gt;

The bisections are trivially the [[hyperbolic function]]s:

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty {z^{2m} \over (2m)!} = \frac{1}{2}\left(e^z+e^{-z}\right) = \cosh{z}&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty {z^{2m+1} \over (2m+1)!} = \frac{1}{2}\left(e^z-e^{-z}\right) = \sinh{z}.&lt;/math&gt;

Higher order multisections are found by noting that all such series must be real-valued along the real line.  By taking the real part and using standard trigonometric identities, the formulas may be written in explicitly real form as

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty {z^{qm+p} \over (qm+p)!} = \frac{1}{q}\cdot \sum_{k=0}^{q-1} e^{z\cos(2\pi k/q)}\cos{\left(z\sin{\left(\frac{2\pi k}{q}\right)}-\frac{2\pi kp}{q}\right)}.&lt;/math&gt;

These can be seen as solutions to the [[linear differential equation]] &lt;math&gt;f^{(q)}(z)=f(z)&lt;/math&gt; with [[boundary conditions]] &lt;math&gt;f^{(k)}(0)=\delta_{k,p}&lt;/math&gt;, using [[Kronecker delta]] notation.  In particular, the trisections are

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty {z^{3m} \over (3m)!} = \frac{1}{3}\left(e^z+2e^{-z/2}\cos{\frac{\sqrt{3}z}{2}}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty {z^{3m+1} \over (3m+1)!} = \frac{1}{3}\left(e^z-e^{-z/2}\left(\cos{\frac{\sqrt{3}z}{2}}-\sqrt{3}\sin{\frac{\sqrt{3}z}{2}}\right)\right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty {z^{3m+2} \over (3m+2)!} = \frac{1}{3}\left(e^z-e^{-z/2}\left(\cos{\frac{\sqrt{3}z}{2}}+\sqrt{3}\sin{\frac{\sqrt{3}z}{2}}\right)\right),&lt;/math&gt;

and the quadrusections are

: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty {z^{4m} \over (4m)!} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\cosh{z}+\cos{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty {z^{4m+1} \over (4m+1)!} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sinh{z}+\sin{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty {z^{4m+2} \over (4m+2)!} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\cosh{z}-\cos{z}\right)&lt;/math&gt;
: &lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^\infty {z^{4m+3} \over (4m+3)!} = \frac{1}{2}\left(\sinh{z}-\sin{z}\right).&lt;/math&gt;

===Binomial theorem===
Multisection of a [[binomial expansion]]

: &lt;math&gt;(1+x)^n = {n\choose 0} x^0 + {n\choose 1} x + {n\choose 2} x^2 + \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

at ''x'' = 1 gives the following identity for the sum of [[binomial coefficients]] with step ''q'':

: &lt;math&gt;{n\choose p} + {n\choose p+q} + {n\choose p+2q} + \cdots = \frac{1}{q}\cdot \sum_{k=0}^{q-1} \left(2 \cos\frac{\pi k}{q}\right )^n\cdot \cos \frac{\pi(n-2p)k}{q}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9980">In [[numerical analysis]], the '''Shanks transformation''' is a [[non-linear]] [[series acceleration]] method to increase the [[rate of convergence]] of a [[sequence]]. This method is named after [[Daniel Shanks]], who rediscovered this sequence transformation in 1955. It was first derived and published by R. Schmidt in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;Weniger (2003).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote box
 | quote=One can calculate only a few terms of a [[perturbation theory|perturbation expansion]], usually no more than two or three, and almost never more than seven. The resulting series is often slowly convergent, or even divergent. Yet those few terms contain a remarkable amount of information, which the investigator should do his best to extract.&lt;br&gt; This viewpoint has been persuasively set forth in a delightful paper by Shanks (1955), who displays a number of amazing examples, including several from [[fluid mechanics]].

==Formulation==

For a sequence &lt;math&gt;\left\{a_m\right\}_{m\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; the series

:&lt;math&gt;A = \sum_{m=0}^\infty a_m\,&lt;/math&gt;

is to be determined. First, the partial sum &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is defined as:

:&lt;math&gt;A_n = \sum_{m=0}^n a_m\,&lt;/math&gt;

and forms a new sequence &lt;math&gt;\left\{A_n\right\}_{n\in\mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;. Provided the series converges, &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; will also approach the limit &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; as &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
The Shanks transformation &lt;math&gt;S(A_n)&lt;/math&gt; of the sequence &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; is the new sequence defined by&lt;ref name=BenderOrszag368&gt;Bender &amp; Orszag (1999), pp. 368–375.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=VanDyke&gt;Van Dyke (1975), pp. 202–205.&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;S(A_n) = \frac{A_{n+1}\, A_{n-1}\, -\, A_n^2}{A_{n+1}-2A_n+A_{n-1}} = A_{n+1} - \frac{(A_{n+1}-A_{n})^2}{(A_{n+1}-A_{n})-(A_{n}-A_{n-1})}&lt;/math&gt;

where this sequence &lt;math&gt;S(A_n)&lt;/math&gt; often converges more rapidly than the sequence &lt;math&gt;A_n.&lt;/math&gt;   
Further speed-up may be obtained by repeated use of the Shanks transformation, by computing &lt;math&gt;S^2(A_n)=S(S(A_n)),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;S^3(A_n)=S(S(S(A_n))),&lt;/math&gt; etc.

Note that the non-linear transformation as used in the Shanks transformation is essentially the same as used in [[Aitken's delta-squared process]] so that as with Aitken's method, the right-most expression in &lt;math&gt;S(A_n)&lt;/math&gt;'s definition (i.e. &lt;math&gt;S(A_n) = A_{n+1} - \frac{(A_{n+1}-A_{n})^2}{(A_{n+1}-A_{n})-(A_{n}-A_{n-1})}&lt;/math&gt;) is more numerically stable than the expression to its left (i.e. &lt;math&gt;S(A_n) = \frac{A_{n+1}\, A_{n-1}\, -\, A_n^2}{A_{n+1}-2A_n+A_{n-1}}&lt;/math&gt;). Both  Aitken's method and the Shanks transformation operate on a sequence, but the sequence the Shanks transformation operates on is usually thought of as being a sequence of partial sums, although any sequence may be viewed as a sequence of partial sums.

==Example==

[[Image:Shanks transformation.svg|thumb|400px|right|Absolute error as a function of &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; in the partial sums &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; and after applying the Shanks transformation once or several times: &lt;math&gt;S(A_n),&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;S^2(A_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^3(A_n).&lt;/math&gt; The series used is &lt;math&gt;\scriptstyle 4\left(1-\frac13+\frac15-\frac17+\frac19-\cdots\right),&lt;/math&gt; which has the exact sum &lt;math&gt;\pi.&lt;/math&gt;]]
As an example, consider the slowly convergent series&lt;ref name=VanDyke/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; 4 \sum_{k=0}^\infty (-1)^k \frac{1}{2k+1} = 4 \left( 1 - \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{5} - \frac{1}{7} + \cdots \right) &lt;/math&gt;

which has the exact sum ''π''&amp;nbsp;≈&amp;nbsp;3.14159265. The partial sum &lt;math&gt;A_6&lt;/math&gt; has only one digit accuracy, while six-figure accuracy requires summing about 400,000 terms.

In the table below, the partial sums &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt;, the Shanks transformation &lt;math&gt;S(A_n)&lt;/math&gt; on them, as well as the repeated Shanks transformations &lt;math&gt;S^2(A_n)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;S^3(A_n)&lt;/math&gt; are given for &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; up to 12. The figure to the right shows the absolute error for the partial sums and Shanks transformation results, clearly showing the improved accuracy and convergence rate.

The Shanks transformation &lt;math&gt;S(A_1)&lt;/math&gt; already has two-digit accuracy, while the original partial sums only establish the same accuracy at &lt;math&gt;A_{24}.&lt;/math&gt; Remarkably, &lt;math&gt;S^3(A_3)&lt;/math&gt; has six digits accuracy, obtained from repeated Shank transformations applied to the first seven terms &lt;math&gt;A_0, \ldots, A_6.&lt;/math&gt; As said before, &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; only obtains 6-digit accuracy after about summing 400,000 terms.

==Motivation==

The Shanks transformation is motivated by the observation that — for larger &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; — the partial sum &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; quite often behaves approximately as&lt;ref name=BenderOrszag368/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A_n = A + \alpha q^n, \,&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;|q|&lt;1&lt;/math&gt; so that the sequence converges [[transient (oscillation)|transient]]ly to the series result &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; for &lt;math&gt;n\to\infty.&lt;/math&gt;
So for &lt;math&gt;n-1,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;n+1&lt;/math&gt; the respective partial sums are:

:&lt;math&gt;A_{n-1} = A + \alpha q^{n-1} \quad , \qquad A_n = A + \alpha q^n \qquad \text{and} \qquad A_{n+1} = A + \alpha q^{n+1}.&lt;/math&gt;

These three equations contain three unknowns: &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;q.&lt;/math&gt; Solving for &lt;math&gt;A&lt;/math&gt; gives&lt;ref name=BenderOrszag368/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;A = \frac{A_{n+1}\, A_{n-1}\, -\, A_n^2}{A_{n+1}-2A_n+A_{n-1}}.&lt;/math&gt;

In the (exceptional) case that the denominator is equal to zero: then &lt;math&gt;A_n=A&lt;/math&gt; for all &lt;math&gt;n.&lt;/math&gt;

==Generalized Shanks transformation==

The generalized ''k''th-order Shanks transformation is given as the ratio of the [[determinant]]s:&lt;ref name=BenderOrszag389&gt;Bender &amp; Orszag (1999), pp. 389–392.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;
  S_k(A_n) 
  = \frac{
      \begin{vmatrix}
        A_{n-k}          &amp; \cdots &amp; A_{n-1}          &amp; A_n              \\
        \Delta A_{n-k}   &amp; \cdots &amp; \Delta A_{n-1}   &amp; \Delta A_{n}     \\
        \Delta A_{n-k+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \Delta A_{n}     &amp; \Delta A_{n+1}   \\
        \vdots           &amp;        &amp; \vdots           &amp; \vdots           \\
        \Delta A_{n-1}   &amp; \cdots &amp; \Delta A_{n+k-2} &amp; \Delta A_{n+k-1} \\
      \end{vmatrix}
    }{
      \begin{vmatrix}
        1                &amp; \cdots &amp; 1                &amp; 1                \\
        \Delta A_{n-k}   &amp; \cdots &amp; \Delta A_{n-1}   &amp; \Delta A_{n}     \\
        \Delta A_{n-k+1} &amp; \cdots &amp; \Delta A_{n}     &amp; \Delta A_{n+1}   \\
        \vdots           &amp;        &amp; \vdots           &amp; \vdots           \\
        \Delta A_{n-1}   &amp; \cdots &amp; \Delta A_{n+k-2} &amp; \Delta A_{n+k-1} \\
      \end{vmatrix}
    },
&lt;/math&gt;
with &lt;math&gt;\Delta A_p = A_{p+1} - A_p.&lt;/math&gt; It is the solution of a model for the convergence behaviour of the partial sums &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; distinct transients:

:&lt;math&gt;A_n = A + \sum_{p=1}^k \alpha_p q_p^n.&lt;/math&gt;

This model for the convergence behaviour contains &lt;math&gt;2k+1&lt;/math&gt; unknowns. By evaluating the above equation at the elements &lt;math&gt;A_{n-k}, A_{n-k+1}, \ldots, A_{n+k}&lt;/math&gt; and solving for &lt;math&gt;A,&lt;/math&gt; the above expression for the ''k''th-order Shanks transformation is obtained. The first-order generalized Shanks transformation is equal to the ordinary Shanks transformation: &lt;math&gt;S_1(A_n)=S(A_n).&lt;/math&gt;

The generalized Shanks transformation is closely related to [[Padé approximant]]s and [[Padé table]]s.&lt;ref name=BenderOrszag389/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="59114">In [[mathematics]], '''Sobolev spaces for planar domains''' are one of the principal techniques used in the theory of [[partial differential equation]]s for solving the [[Dirichlet boundary condition|Dirichlet]] and [[Neumann boundary condition|Neumann]] boundary value problems for the Laplacian in a bounded domain in the plane with smooth boundary. The methods use the theory of [[bounded operator]]s on [[Hilbert space]]. They can be used to deduce regularity properties of solutions and to solve the corresponding eigenvalue problems.

==Sobolev spaces with boundary conditions==
Let {{math|Ω ⊂ '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} be a bounded domain with smooth boundary. Since {{math|Ω}} is contained in a large square in {{math|'''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}, it can be regarded as a domain in {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} by identifying opposite sides of the square. The theory of Sobolev spaces on {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be found in {{harvtxt|Bers|John|Schechter|1979}}, an account which is followed in several later textbooks such as {{harvtxt|Warner|1983}} and {{harvtxt|Griffiths|Harris|1994}}.

For {{mvar|k}} an integer, the (restricted) '''Sobolev space''' {{math|H{{su|p=''k''|b=0}}(Ω)}} is defined as the closure of {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}} in the standard [[Sobolev space]] {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

* {{math|H{{su|p=0|b=0}}(Ω) {{=}} L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}.
*'''Vanishing properties on boundary:''' For {{math|''k'' &gt; 0}} the elements of {{math|H{{su|p=''k''|b=0}}(Ω)}} are referred to as "{{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} functions on {{math|Ω}} which vanish with their first {{math|''k'' − 1}} derivatives on {{math|∂Ω}}."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bers|John|Schechter|1979|pp=192–193}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact if {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; ∈ C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;({{overline|Ω}})}} agrees with a function in {{math|H{{su|p=''k''|b=0}}(Ω)}}, then {{math|''g'' {{=}} ∂&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is in {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Let {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∈ C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}} be such that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''f''&amp;thinsp;}} in the Sobolev norm, and set {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ∂&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;}}. Thus {{math|''g&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ''g''}} in {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}}. Hence for {{math|''h'' ∈ C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|''D'' {{=}} ''a''∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''b''∂&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}},

::&lt;math&gt;\iint_\Omega \left (g (Dh) + (Dg) h \right ) \, dx \, dy = \lim_{n\to 0} \iint_\Omega \left (g (Dh_n) + (Dg) h_n \right ) \, dx \, dy =0.&lt;/math&gt;

:By [[Green's theorem]] this implies

::&lt;math&gt;\int_{\partial\Omega} gk =0,&lt;/math&gt;

:where

::&lt;math&gt; k = h \cos \left (\mathbf{n} \cdot (a, b) \right ),&lt;/math&gt;

:with {{math|'''n'''}} the unit normal to the boundary. Since such {{mvar|k}} form a dense subspace of {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, it follows that {{math|''g'' {{=}} 0}} on {{math|∂Ω}}.

*'''Support properties:''' Let {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;}} be the complement of {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}} and define restricted Sobolev spaces analogously for {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Both sets of spaces have a natural pairing with {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. The Sobolev space for {{math|Ω}} is the annihilator in the Sobolev space for {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} of {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and that for {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is the annihilator of {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chazarain|Piriou|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact this is proved by locally applying a small translation to move the domain inside itself and then smoothing by a smooth convolution operator.

:Suppose {{mvar|g}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} annihilates {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. By compactness, there are finitely many opens {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;, ''U''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ... , ''U&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt;''}} covering {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}} such that the closure of {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is disjoint from {{math|∂Ω}} and each {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is an open disc about a boundary point {{math|''z&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} such that in {{math|''U&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} small translations in the direction of the normal vector {{math|''n&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} carry {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}} into {{math|Ω}}. Add an open {{math|''U''&lt;sub&gt;''N''+1&lt;/sub&gt;}} with closure in {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;}} to produce a cover of {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and let {{math|''ψ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be a [[partition of unity]] subordinate to this cover. If translation by {{mvar|n}} is denoted by {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, then the functions

::&lt;math&gt;g_t=\psi_0 g +\sum_{i=1}^N \psi_n \lambda_{tn_i} g &lt;/math&gt;

:tend to {{mvar|g}} as {{mvar|t}} decreases to {{math|0}} and still lie in the annihilator, indeed they are in the annihilator for a larger domain than {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, the complement of which lies in {{math|Ω}}. Convolving by smooth functions of small support produces smooth approximations in the annihilator of a slightly smaller domain still with complement in {{math|Ω}}. These are necessarily smooth functions of compact support in {{math|Ω}}.

*'''Further vanishing properties on the boundary:''' The characterization in terms of annihilators shows that   {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; ∈ C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;({{overline|Ω}})}} lies in {{math|H{{su|p=&amp;thinsp;''k''|b=0}}(Ω)}} if (and only if) it and its derivatives of order less than {{mvar|k}} vanish on {{math|∂Ω}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Folland|1995|p=226}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} can be extended to {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} by setting it to be {{math|0}} on {{math|Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. This extension {{mvar|F}} defines an element in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} using the formula for the norm

::&lt;math&gt;\|h\|_{(k)}^2=\sum_{j=0}^k {k\choose j} \left  \|\partial_x^j\partial_y^{k-j} h \right\|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

:Moreover {{math|''F''}} satisfies {{math|(''F'', ''g'') {{=}} 0}} for ''g'' in {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.

*'''Duality:''' For {{math|''k'' ≥ 0}}, define {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} to be the orthogonal complement of {{math|H{{su|p=−''k''|b=0}}(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Let {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} be the orthogonal projection onto {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, so that {{math|''Q&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''I'' − ''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is the orthogonal projection onto {{math|H{{su|p=−''k''|b=0}}(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. When {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}}, this just gives {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) {{=}} L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. If {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; ∈ H{{su|p=''k''|b=0}}(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|''g'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, then

::&lt;math&gt;(f,g)= (f, P_kg).&lt;/math&gt;

:This implies that under the pairing between {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, {{math|H{{su|p=''k''|b=0}}(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} are each other's duals.

*'''Approximation by smooth functions:''' The image of {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}} is dense in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} for {{math|''k'' ≤ 0}}. This is obvious for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}} since the sum {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}} + {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is dense in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Density for {{math|''k'' &lt; 0}} follows because the image of {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} is dense in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{math|''P&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} annihilates {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.
*'''Canonical isometries:''' The operator {{math|(''I'' + ∆)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} gives an isometry of {{math|H{{su|p=&amp;thinsp;2''k''|b=0}}(Ω)}} into {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} and of {{math|H{{su|p=&amp;thinsp;''k''|b=0}}(Ω)}} onto {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. In fact the first statement follows because it is true on {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. That {{math|(''I'' + ∆)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is an isometry on {{math|H{{su|p=&amp;thinsp;''k''|b=0}}(Ω)}} follows using the density of {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}: for {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f'', ''g'' ∈ C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}} we have:

::&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left \|P_k (I+\Delta)^k f \right \|_{(-k)} &amp;= \sup_{\|g\|_{(-k)}=1} \left|\left ((I+\Delta)^kf,g \right )_{(-k)} \right | \\
&amp;= \sup_{\|g\|_{(-k)}=1} |(f,g)| \\
&amp;=\|f\|_{(k)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

:Since the adjoint map between the duals can by identified with this map, it follows that {{math|(''I'' + ∆)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} is a unitary map.

==Application to Dirichlet problem==
{{see also|Dirichlet problem}}

===Invertibility of {{math|∆}}=== 
The operator {{math|∆}} defines an isomorphism between {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}} and {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. In fact it is a Fredholm operator of index {{math|0}}. The kernel of {{math|∆}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} consists of constant functions and none of these except zero vanish on the boundary of {{math|Ω}}. Hence the kernel of {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}} is {{math|(0)}} and {{math|∆}} is invertible.

In particular the equation {{math|∆''f'' {{=}} ''g''}} has a unique solution in {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}} for {{mvar|g}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}.

===Eigenvalue problem=== 
Let {{mvar|T}} be the operator on {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} defined by

:&lt;math&gt;T = R_1\Delta^{-1}R_0,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the inclusion of {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} and {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} of {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}} in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, both compact operators by Rellich's theorem. The operator {{mvar|T}} is compact and self-adjoint with {{math|(''Tf'', ''f''&amp;thinsp;) &gt; 0}} for all {{mvar|f}}. By the [[spectral theorem]], there is a complete orthonormal set of eigenfunctions {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} with

:&lt;math&gt;Tf_n = \mu_nf_n, \qquad \mu_n &gt;0, \mu_n \to 0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &gt; 0}}, {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} lies in {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}}. Setting {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''μ''&lt;sub&gt;−''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}}, the {{math|''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are eigenfunctions of the Laplacian:

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f_n = \lambda_n f_n,\qquad \lambda_n&gt;0, \lambda_n\to \infty.&lt;/math&gt;

==Sobolev spaces without boundary condition==
To determine the regularity properties of the eigenfunctions {{math|&amp;nbsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;nbsp;}} and solutions of

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta f =u,\qquad u\in H^{-1}(\Omega), f\in H^1_0(\Omega),&lt;/math&gt;

enlargements of the Sobolev spaces {{math|H{{su|p=''k''|b=0}}(Ω)}} have to be considered. Let {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}} be the space of smooth functions on {{math|Ω}} which with their derivatives extend continuously to {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}}. By [[Borel's lemma]], these are precisely the restrictions of smooth functions on {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The Sobolev space {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} is defined to the Hilbert space completion of this space for the norm

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{(k)}^2 = \sum_{j=0}^k {k\choose j} \left \|\partial_x^j\partial_y^{k-j}f \right\|^2.&lt;/math&gt;

This norm agrees with the Sobolev norm on {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}} so that {{math|H{{su|p=''k''|b=0}}(Ω)}} can be regarded as a closed subspace of {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. Unlike {{math|H{{su|p=''k''|b=0}}(Ω)}}, {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} is not naturally a subspace of {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, but the map restricting smooth functions from {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} to {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}} is continuous for the Sobolev norm so extends by continuity to a map {{math|''ρ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' : H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) → H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}.
*'''Invariance under diffeomorphism:''' Any diffeomorphism between the closures of two smooth domains induces an isomorphism between the Sobolev space. This is a simple consequence of the chain rule for derivatives.
*'''Extension theorem:''' The restriction of {{math|''ρ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to the orthogonal complement of its kernel defines an isomorphism onto {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. The extension map {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is defined to be the inverse of this map: it is an isomorphism (not necessarily norm preserving) of {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} onto the orthogonal complement of {{math|H{{su|p=''k''|b=0}}(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)}} such that {{math|''ρ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' ∘ ''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''I''}}. On {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}}, it agrees with the natural inclusion map. Bounded extension maps {{math|''E&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of this kind from {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} to {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} were constructed first constructed by Hestenes and Lions. For smooth curves the [[Seeley extension theorem]] provides an extension which is continuous in all the Sobolev norms. A version of the extension which applies in the case where the boundary is just a Lipschitz curve was constructed by [[Alberto Calderón|Calderón]] using [[Singular integral operators of convolution type|singular integral operators]] and generalized by {{harvtxt|Stein|1970}}.

:It is sufficient to construct an extension {{mvar|E}} for a neighbourhood of a closed annulus, since a collar around the boundary is diffeomorphic to an annulus {{math|''I'' × '''T'''}} with {{mvar|''I''}} a closed interval in {{math|'''T'''}}. Taking a smooth bump function {{mvar|ψ}} with {{math|0 ≤ ''ψ'' ≤ 1}}, equal to 1 near the boundary and 0 outside the collar, {{math|''E''(''ψf''&amp;thinsp;) + (1 − ''ψ'')&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} will provide an extension on {{math|Ω}}. On the annulus, the problem reduces to finding an extension for {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(&amp;thinsp;''I''&amp;thinsp;)}} in {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''')}}. Using a partition of unity the task of extending reduces to a neighbourhood of the end points of {{mvar|I}}. Assuming 0 is the left end point, an extension is given locally by

::&lt;math&gt;E(f) = \sum_{m=0}^k a_m f \left (-\frac{x}{m+1} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

:Matching the first derivatives of order ''k'' or less at 0, gives

::&lt;math&gt;\sum_{m=0}^k (-m-1)^{-k} a_m =1.&lt;/math&gt;

:This matrix equation is solvable because the determinant is non-zero by [[Vandermonde determinant|Vandermonde's formula]]. It is straightforward to check that the formula for {{math|''E''(&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;)}}, when appropriately modified with bump functions, leads to an extension which is continuous in the above Sobolev norm.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Folland|1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Restriction theorem:''' The restriction map {{math|''ρ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}} is surjective with {{math|ker ''ρ&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} H{{su|p=''k''|b=0}}(Ω&lt;sup&gt;''c''&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. This is an immediate consequence of the extension theorem and the support properties for Sobolev spaces with boundary condition.
*'''Duality:''' {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} is naturally the dual of H&lt;sup&gt;−''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;(Ω). Again this is an immediate consequence of the restriction theorem. Thus the Sobolev spaces form a chain:

::&lt;math&gt;\cdots \subset H^2(\Omega) \subset H^1(\Omega) \subset H^0(\Omega) \subset H^{-1}_0(\Omega) \subset H^{-2}_0(\Omega) \subset \cdots&lt;/math&gt;

:The differentiation operators {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;, ∂&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} carry each Sobolev space into the larger one with index 1 less.

*'''Sobolev embedding theorem:''' {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} is contained in {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. This is an immediate consequence of the extension theorem and the Sobolev embedding theorem for {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.
*'''Characterization:''' {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} consists of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) {{=}} H&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} such that all the derivatives ∂&lt;sup&gt;α&lt;/sup&gt;''f'' lie in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} for |α| ≤ ''k''.Here the derivatives are taken within the chain of Sobolev spaces above.&lt;ref&gt;See:
*{{harvnb|Agmon|2010}}
*{{harvnb|Folland|1995|pp=219–223}}
*{{harvnb|Chazarain|Piriou|1982|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}} is weakly dense in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, this condition is equivalent to the existence of {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} functions ''f''&lt;sub&gt;α&lt;/sub&gt; such that

::&lt;math&gt;\left(f_\alpha,\varphi \right)=(-1)^{|\alpha|} \left (f, \partial^\alpha \varphi \right ), \qquad |\alpha| \leq k, \varphi \in C^{\infty}_c(\Omega).&lt;/math&gt;
 
:To prove the characterization, note that if {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, then {{math|∂&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} lies in H&lt;sup&gt;''k''−|α|&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) and hence in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;0&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) {{=}} L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. Conversely the result is well known for the Sobolev spaces {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}: the assumption implies that the {{math|(∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; − ''i''∂&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and the corresponding condition on the Fourier coefficients of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} shows that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} lies in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Similarly the result an be proved directly for an annulus {{math|[−''δ'', ''δ''] × '''T'''}}. In fact by the argument on {{math|'''T'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} the restriction of {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} to any smaller annulus [−δ',δ'] × '''T''' lies in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}: equivalently the restriction of the function {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;''&amp;thinsp;(''x'', ''y'') {{=}} ''f''&amp;thinsp;(''Rx'', ''y'')}} lies in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} for {{math|''R'' &gt; 1}}. On the other hand {{math|∂&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;R&lt;/sub&gt;'' → ∂&lt;sup&gt;''α''&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;''f''}} in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} as {{math|''R'' → 1}}, so that {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} must lie in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. The case for a general domain {{math|Ω}} reduces to these two cases since {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} can be written as {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f'' {{=}} ''ψf'' + (1 − ''ψ'')&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} with ψ a bump function supported in {{math|Ω}} such that {{math|1 − ''ψ''}} is supported in a collar of the boundary.

*'''Regularity theorem:''' If {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} has both derivatives {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''f''}} and {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''f''}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} then {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} lies in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. This is an immediate consequence of the characterization of {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} above. In fact if this is true even when satisfied at the level of distributions: if there are functions ''g'', ''h'' in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} such that (''g'',φ) = (''f'', φ&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''h'',φ) = (''f'',φ&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;) for φ in {{math|C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}}, then {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}.
*'''Rotations on an annulus:''' For an annulus {{math|''I'' × '''T'''}}, the extension map to {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} is by construction equivariant with respect to rotations in the second variable,

::&lt;math&gt;R_t f(x,y)=f(x,y+t).&lt;/math&gt;

:On {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} it is known that if {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} is in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}, then the ''difference quotient'' {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;f'' {{=}} ''h''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;(''R&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;f'' − ''f''&amp;thinsp;) → ∂&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sup&gt;}}; if the difference quotients are bounded in ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; then ∂&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;''f'' lies in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}}. Both assertions are consequences of the formula:

::&lt;math&gt;\widehat{\delta_h f}(m,n) = h^{-1}(e^{-ihn}-1)\widehat{f}(m,n)=-\int_0^1 in e^{-inht}\, dt \,\,\widehat{f}(m,n).&lt;/math&gt;

:These results on {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} imply analogous results on the annulus using the extension.

If {{math|∆''u'' {{=}} ''f''}} with {{mvar|u}} in {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}} and {{mvar|f}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} with {{math|''k'' ≥ 0}}, then {{mvar|u}} lies in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}.

Take a decomposition {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''ψu'' + (1 − ''ψ'')''u''}} with {{mvar|ψ}} supported in {{math|Ω}} and {{math|1 − ''ψ''}} supported in a collar of the boundary. Standard Sobolev theory for {{math|'''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} can be applied to {{math|''ψu''}}: elliptic regularity implies that it lies in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and hence {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. {{math|''v'' {{=}} (1 − ''ψ'')''u''}} lies in {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}}} of a collar, diffeomorphic to an annulus, so it suffices to prove the result with {{math|Ω}} a collar and {{math|∆}} replaced by

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\Delta_1 &amp;= \Delta -[\Delta,\psi] \\
         &amp;=\Delta + \left(p\partial_x + q\partial_y - \Delta \psi \right) \\
         &amp;=\Delta +X.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The proof&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; proceeds by induction on {{mvar|k}}, proving simultaneously the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{(k+1)} \le C\|\Delta_1 u\|_{(k-1)} + C \|u\|_{(k)},&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant {{mvar|C}} depending only on {{mvar|k}}. It is straightforward to establish this inequality for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}}, where by density {{mvar|u}} can be taken to be smooth of compact support in {{math|Ω}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|u\|_{(1)}^2 &amp;= |(\Delta u, u)| \\
&amp;\le |(\Delta_1 u,u)| +|(Xu,u)| \\
&amp;\le \|\Delta_1 u\|_{(-1)}\|u\|_{(1)} +C^\prime \|u\|_{(1)}\|u\|_{(0)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The collar is diffeomorphic to an annulus. The rotational flow {{math|''R&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}} on the annulus induces a flow {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}} on the collar with corresponding vector field {{math|''Y'' {{=}} ''r''∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''s''∂&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. Thus {{mvar|Y}} corresponds to the vector field {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''θ''&lt;/sub&gt;}}. The radial vector field on the annulus {{math|''r''∂&lt;sub&gt;''r''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a commuting vector field which on the collar gives a vector field {{math|''Z'' {{=}} ''p''∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt; + ''q''∂&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;}} proportional to the normal vector field. The vector fields {{mvar|Y}} and {{mvar|Z}} commute.

The difference quotients {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;u''}} can be formed for the flow {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. The commutators {{math|[''δ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', ∆&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;]}} are second order differential operators from {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} to {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''−1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. Their operators norms are uniformly bounded for {{mvar|h}} near {{math|0}}; for the computation can be carried out on the annulus where the commutator just replaces the coefficients of {{math|∆&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} by their difference quotients composed with {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. On the other hand, {{math|''v'' {{=}} ''δ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;u''}} lies in {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}}, so the inequalities for {{mvar|u}} apply equally well for {{mvar|v}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|\delta_h u\|_{(k+1)} &amp;\le C\|\Delta_1 \delta_h u\|_{(k-1)} + C \|\delta_h u\|_{(k)} \\
&amp;\le C \|\delta_h \Delta_1 u\|_{(k-1)} + C\|[\delta_h,\Delta_1] u\|_{(k-1)} + C \|\delta_h u\|_{(k)} \\
&amp;\le C\|\Delta_1 u\|_{(k)} + C^\prime \|u\|_{(k+1)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The uniform boundedness of the difference quotients {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;u''}} implies that {{math|''Yu''}} lies in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} with

:&lt;math&gt;\|Y u\|_{(k+1)} \le C \|\Delta_1 u\|_{(k)} + C^\prime \|u\|_{(k+1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that {{math|''Vu''}} lies in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} where {{mvar|V}} is the vector field

:&lt;math&gt;V = \frac{Y}{\sqrt{r^2+s^2}} = a\partial_x + b\partial_y, \qquad a^2 + b^2 = 1.&lt;/math&gt;

Moreover, {{math|''Vu''}} satisfies a similar inequality to {{math|''Yu''}}.

:&lt;math&gt;\|V u\|_{(k+1)} \le C^{\prime\prime} \left (\|\Delta_1 u\|_{(k)} + \|u\|_{(k+1)} \right).&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{mvar|W}} be the orthogonal vector field

:&lt;math&gt;W=-b\partial_x + a\partial_y.&lt;/math&gt;

It can also be written as {{math|''ξZ''}} for some smooth nowhere vanishing function {{mvar|ξ}} on a neighbourhood of the collar.

It suffices to show that {{math|''Wu''}} lies in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. For then

:&lt;math&gt;(V \pm iW)u =(a \mp i b) \left (\partial_x \pm i \partial_y \right)u,&lt;/math&gt;

so that {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''x''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''}} and {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''y''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''}} lie in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} and {{mvar|u}} must lie in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}.

To check the result on {{math|''Wu''}}, it is enough to show that {{math|''VWu''}} and {{math|''W''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''u''}} lie in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. Note that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;=\Delta - V^2 - W^2, \\
B &amp;=[V,W],
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

are vector fields. But then

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
W^2u &amp;=\Delta u - V^2u - Au, \\
VWu &amp;= WVu + Bu,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

with all terms on the right hand side in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. Moreover, the inequalities for {{math|''Vu''}} show that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|Wu\|_{(k+1)}  &amp;\le C \left (\|VWu\|_{(k)} + \left \|W^2u \right \|_{(k)} \right ) \\
&amp;\le C \left \| \left (\Delta - V^2 -A \right )u \right \|_{(k)} + C \|(WV+B)u\|_{(k)} \\
&amp;\le C_1 \|\Delta_1 u\|_{(k)} + C_1 \|u\|_{(k+1)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|u\|_{(k+2)} &amp;\le C \left (\|Vu\|_{(k+1)} + \|Wu\|_{(k+1)} \right ) \\
&amp;\le C^\prime \|\Delta_1 u\|_{(k)} + C^\prime \|u\|_{(k+1)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

===Smoothness of eigenfunctions=== 
It follows by induction from the regularity theorem for the dual Dirichlet problem that the eigenfunctions of {{math|∆}} in {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}} lie in {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Moreover, any solution of {{math|∆''u'' {{=}} ''f''}} with {{mvar|f}} in {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{mvar|u}} in {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}} must have {{mvar|u}} in {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. In both cases by the vanishing properties, the eigenfunctions and {{mvar|u}} vanish on the boundary of {{math|Ω}}.

===Solving the Dirichlet problem=== 
The dual Dirichlet problem can be used to solve the Dirichlet problem:

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{cases}\Delta f|_\Omega = 0 \\ f|_{\partial\Omega} =g &amp; g \in C^{\infty}(\partial \Omega)\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

By Borel's lemma {{mvar|g}} is the restriction of a function {{mvar|G}} in {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Let {{mvar|F}} be the smooth solution of {{math|∆''F'' {{=}} ∆''G''}} with {{math|''F'' {{=}} 0}} on {{math|∂Ω}}. Then {{math|''f'' {{=}} ''G'' − ''F''}} solves the Dirichlet problem. By the [[maximal principle]], the solution is unique.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Folland|1995|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Application to smooth Riemann mapping theorem==
The solution to the Dirichlet problem can be used to prove a strong form of the [[Riemann mapping theorem]] for simply connected domains with smooth boundary. The method also applies to a region diffeomorphic to an annulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2011|pp=323–325}}&lt;/ref&gt; For multiply connected regions with smooth boundary {{harvtxt|Schiffer|Hawley|1962}} have given a method for mapping the region onto a disc with circular holes. Their method involves solving the Dirichlet problem with a non-linear boundary condition. They construct a function {{mvar|g}} such that:

* {{mvar|g}} is harmonic in the interior of {{math|Ω}};
* On {{math|∂Ω}} we have: {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''g'' {{=}} ''κ'' − ''Ke&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, where {{mvar|κ}} is the curvature of the boundary curve, {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the derivative in the direction normal to {{math|∂Ω}} and {{mvar|K}} is constant on each boundary component.

{{harvtxt|Taylor|2011}} gives a proof of the Riemann mapping theorem for a simply connected domain {{math|Ω}} with smooth boundary. Translating if necessary, it can be assumed that {{math|0 ∈ Ω}}. The solution of the Dirichlet problem shows that there is a unique smooth function {{math|''U''(''z'')}} on {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}} which is harmonic in {{math|Ω}} and equals {{math|−log{{!}}''z''{{!}}}} on {{math|∂Ω}}. Define the [[Green's function]] by {{math|''G''(''z'') {{=}} log{{!}}''z''{{!}}  + ''U''(''z'')}}. It vanishes on {{math|∂Ω}} and is harmonic on {{math|Ω}} away from {{math|0}}. The [[harmonic conjugate]] {{mvar|V}} of {{mvar|U}} is the unique real function on {{math|Ω}} such that {{math|''U'' + ''iV''}} is holomorphic. As such it must satisfy the [[Cauchy–Riemann equations]]:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
U_x &amp;= -V_y, \\ 
U_y &amp;= V_x.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The solution is given by

:&lt;math&gt;V(z)=\int_0^z -U_y dx + V_x dy,&lt;/math&gt;

where the integral is taken over any path in {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}}. It is easily verified that {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and {{math|''V&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;''}} exist and are given by the corresponding derivatives of {{mvar|U}}. Thus {{mvar|V}} is a smooth function on {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}}, vanishing at {{math|0}}. By the Cauchy-Riemann {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f'' {{=}} ''U'' + ''iV''}} is smooth on {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}}, holomorphic on {{math|Ω}} and {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;(0) {{=}} 0}}. The function {{math|''H'' {{=}} arg ''z'' + ''V''(''z'')}} is only defined up to multiples of {{math|2''π''}}, but the function

:&lt;math&gt;F(z) =e^{G(z)+iH(z)}= z e^{f(z)}&lt;/math&gt;

is a holomorphic on {{math|Ω}} and smooth on {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}}. By construction, {{math|''F''(0) {{=}} 0}} and {{math|{{!}}''F''(''z''){{!}} {{=}} 1}} for {{math|''z'' ∈ ∂Ω}}. Since {{mvar|z}} has [[winding number]] {{math|1}}, so too does {{math|''F''(''z'')}}. On the other hand, {{math|''F''(''z'') {{=}} 0}} only for {{math|''z'' {{=}} 0}} where there is a simple zero. So by the [[argument principle]] {{mvar|F}} assumes every value in the unit disc, {{math|'''D'''}}, exactly once and {{math|''F′''}} does not vanish inside {{math|Ω}}. To check that the derivative on the boundary curve is non-zero amounts to computing the derivative of {{math|''e&lt;sup&gt;iH&lt;/sup&gt;''}}, i.e. the derivative of {{mvar|H}} should not vanish on the boundary curve. By the Cauchy-Riemann equations these tangential derivative are up to a sign the [[directional derivative]] in the direction of the normal to the boundary. But {{mvar|G}} vanishes on the boundary and is strictly negative in {{math|Ω}} since {{math|{{!}}''F''{{!}} {{=}} ''e&lt;sup&gt;G&lt;/sup&gt;''}}. The [[Hopf lemma]] implies that the directional derivative of {{mvar|G}} in the direction of the outward normal is strictly positive. So on the boundary curve, {{mvar|F}} has nowhere vanishing derivative. Since the boundary curve has winding number one, {{mvar|F}} defines a diffeomorphism of the boundary curve onto the unit circle. Accordingly, {{math|''F'' : {{overline|Ω}} → {{overline|'''D'''}}}} is a smooth diffeomorphism, which restricts to a holomorphic map {{math|Ω → '''D'''}} and a smooth diffeomorphism between the boundaries.

Similar arguments can be applied to prove the Riemann mapping theorem for a doubly connected domain {{math|Ω}} bounded by simple smooth curves {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (the inner curve) and {{math|''C&lt;sub&gt;o&lt;/sub&gt;''}} (the outer curve). By translating we can assume 1 lies on the outer boundary. Let {{mvar|u}} be the smooth solution of the Dirichlet problem with {{math|''U'' {{=}} 0}} on the outer curve and {{math|−1}} on the inner curve. By the [[maximum principle]] {{math|0 &lt; ''u''(''z'') &lt; 1}} for {{mvar|z}} in {{math|Ω}} and so by the [[Hopf lemma]] the normal derivatives of {{mvar|u}} are negative on the outer curve and positive on the inner curve. The integral of {{math|−''u&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;dx'' + ''u&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;dx''}} over the boundary is zero by Stoke's theorem so the contributions from the boundary curves cancel. On the other hand, on each boundary curve the contribution is the integral of the normal derivative along the boundary. So there is a constant {{math|''c'' &gt; 0}} such that {{math|''U'' {{=}} ''cu''}} satisfies

:&lt;math&gt;\int_{C} \left (-U_y \,dx + U_x \, dy \right ) = 2\pi&lt;/math&gt;

on each boundary curve. The harmonic conjugate {{mvar|V}} of {{mvar|U}} can again be defined by

:&lt;math&gt;V(z)=\int_1^z -u_y \,dx + u_x \, dy&lt;/math&gt;

and is well-defined up to multiples of {{math|2''π''}}. The function

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{F(z)=e^{U(z) + i V(z)}}&lt;/math&gt;

is smooth on {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}} and holomorphic in {{math|Ω}}. On the outer curve {{math|{{!}}''F''{{!}} {{=}} 1}} and on the inner curve {{math|{{!}}''F''{{!}} {{=}} ''e''&lt;sup&gt;−''c''&lt;/sup&gt; {{=}} ''r'' &lt; 1}}. The tangential derivatives on the outer curves are nowhere vanishing by the Cauchy-Riemann equations, since the normal derivatives are nowhere vanishing. The normalization of the integrals implies that {{mvar|F}} restricts to a diffeomorphism between the boundary curves and the two concentric circles. Since the images of outer and inner curve have winding number {{math|1}} and {{math|0}} about any point in the annulus, an application of the argument principle implies that {{mvar|F}} assumes every value within the annulus {{math|''r'' &lt; {{!}}''z''{{!}} &lt; 1}} exactly once; since that includes multiplicities, the complex derivative of {{mvar|F}} is nowhere vanishing in {{math|Ω}}. This {{mvar|F}} is a smooth diffeomorphism of {{math|{{overline|Ω}}}} onto the closed annulus {{math|''r'' ≤ {{!}}''z''{{!}} ≤ 1}}, restricting to a holomorphic map in the interior and a smooth diffeomorphism on both boundary curves.

==Trace map==
The restriction map {{math|''τ'' : C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) → C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') {{=}} C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(1 × '''T''')}} extends to a continuous map {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) → H&lt;sup&gt;''k'' − ½&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''')}} for {{math|''k'' ≥ 1}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chazarain|Piriou|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact 
 
:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{\widehat{\tau f}(n)=\sum_m \widehat{f}(m,n),}&lt;/math&gt;

so the [[Cauchy–Schwarz inequality]] yields

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\left |\widehat{\tau f}(n) \right|^2 \left (1+n^2 \right )^{k-\frac{1}{2}} &amp;\le \left(\sum_m \frac{\left (1+n^2 \right)^{k-\frac{1}{2}}}{\left (1+m^2+n^2 \right )^{k}}\right) \left(\sum_m \left |\widehat{f}(m,n) \right |^2 \left (1+m^2+n^2 \right )^k\right) \\
&amp;\le C_k \sum_m \left |\widehat{f}(m,n) \right |^2 \left (1+m^2+n^2 \right )^k,
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where, by the [[integral test]],

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
C_k &amp;= \sup_n \sum_m \frac{\left (1+n^2 \right )^{k-\frac{1}{2}}}{\left (1+m^2 +n^2 \right )^k} &lt; \infty, \\ 
c_k &amp;= \inf_n \sum_m \frac{\left (1+n^2 \right )^{k-\frac{1}{2}}}{\left (1+m^2 +n^2 \right )^k} &gt; 0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The map {{mvar|τ}} is onto since a continuous extension map {{mvar|E}} can be constructed from {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k'' − ½&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''')}} to {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2011|p=275}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renardy|Rogers|2004|214-218}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact set

:&lt;math&gt;\widehat{Eg}(m,n)=\lambda_{n}^{-1} \widehat{g}(n) \frac{\left (1+n^2 \right )^{k-\frac{1}{2}}}{\left (1+n^2+m^2 \right )^k},&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_n=  \sum_m \frac{\left (1+n^2 \right )^{k-\frac{1}{2}}}{\left (1+m^2+n^2 \right )^k}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus {{math|''c&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' &lt; ''C&lt;sub&gt;k&lt;/sub&gt;''}}. If ''g'' is smooth, then by construction ''Eg'' restricts to ''g'' on 1 × '''T'''. Moreover, ''E'' is a bounded linear map since

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|Eg\|_{(k)}^2 &amp;= \sum_{m,n} \left |\widehat{Eg}(m,n) \right |^2 \left (1+m^2+n^2 \right ) \\
&amp;\le c_k^{-2} \sum_{m,n} \left | \widehat{g}(n) \right |^2 \frac{\left (1+n^2 \right )^{2k-1}}{ \left (1+m^2+n^2 \right )^k} \\
&amp;\le c_k^{-2} C_k \| g \|_{k-\frac{1}{2}}^2.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that there is a trace map τ of H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) onto H&lt;sup&gt;''k'' − ½&lt;/sup&gt;(∂Ω). Indeed, take a tubular neighbourhood of the boundary and a smooth function ψ supported in the collar and equal to 1 near the boundary. Multiplication by ψ carries functions into H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; of the collar, which can be identified with H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt; of an annulus for which there is a trace map. The invariance under diffeomorphims (or coordinate change) of the half-integer Sobolev spaces on the circle follows from the fact that an equivalent norm on ''H''&lt;sup&gt;''k'' + ½&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') is given by&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hörmander|1990|pp=240–241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\|f\|_{[k+\frac{1}{2}]}^2 = \|f\|_{(k)}^2 + \int_0^{2\pi}\int_0^{2\pi} \frac{\left |f^{(k)}(s)-f^{(k)}(t) \right |^2}{\left |e^{is} -e^{it} \right|^2} \,ds\, dt.&lt;/math&gt;

It is also a consequence of the properties of τ and ''E'' (the "trace theorem").&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renardy|Rogers|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In fact any diffeomorphism ''f'' of '''T''' induces a diffeomorphism ''F'' of '''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; by acting only on the second factor. Invariance of H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) under the induced map ''F''* therefore implies invariance of H&lt;sup&gt;''k'' − ½&lt;/sup&gt;('''T''') under ''f''*, since ''f''* = τ ∘ ''F''* ∘ ''E''.

Further consequences of the trace theorem are the two exact sequences&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Chazarain|Piriou|1982}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Renardy|Rogers|2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;(0) \to H^1_0(\Omega) \to H^1(\Omega) \to H^{\frac{1}{2}} (\partial\Omega) \to (0)&lt;/math&gt;
 
and

:&lt;math&gt;(0) \to H^2_0(\Omega) \to H^2(\Omega) \to H^{\frac{3}{2}} (\partial\Omega) \oplus H^{\frac{1}{2}}(\partial\Omega) \to (0),&lt;/math&gt;

where the last map takes ''f'' in H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) to ''f''|&lt;sub&gt;∂Ω&lt;/sub&gt; and ∂&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''f''|&lt;sub&gt;∂Ω&lt;/sub&gt;. There are generalizations of these sequences to H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) involving higher powers of the normal derivative in the trace map:

:&lt;math&gt;(0)\to H^k_0(\Omega) \to H^k(\Omega) \to \bigoplus_{j=1}^k H^{j-\frac{1}{2}}(\partial\Omega) \to (0).&lt;/math&gt;

The trace map to {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;''j'' − ½&lt;/sup&gt;(∂Ω)}} takes ''f'' to {{math|∂{{su|b=''n''|p=''k'' − ''j''}}''f''&amp;thinsp;{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;∂Ω&lt;/sub&gt;}}

==Abstract formulation of boundary value problems==
The Sobolev space approach to the Neumann problem cannot be phrased quite as directly as that for the Dirichlet problem. The main reason is that for a function {{mvar|f}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, the normal derivative {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''f''&amp;thinsp;{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;∂Ω&lt;/sub&gt;}} cannot be a priori defined at the level of Sobolev spaces. Instead an alternative formulation of boundary value problems for the Laplacian {{math|Δ}} on a bounded region {{math|Ω}} in the plane is used. It employs '''[[Dirichlet form]]s''', sesqulinear bilinear forms on {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}} or an intermediate closed subspace. Integration over the boundary is not involved in defining the Dirichlet form. Instead, if the Dirichlet form satisfies a certain positivity condition, termed '''coerciveness''', solution can be shown to exist in a weak sense, so-called "weak solutions". A general regularity theorem than implies that the solutions of the boundary value problem must lie in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, so that they are strong solutions and satisfy boundary conditions involving the restriction of a function and its normal derivative to the boundary. The Dirichlet problem can equally well be phrased in these terms, but because the trace map {{math|''f''&amp;thinsp;{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;∂Ω&lt;/sub&gt;}} is already defined on {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, Dirichlet forms do not need to be mentioned explicitly and the operator formulation is more direct. A unified discussion is given in {{harvtxt|Folland|1995}} and briefly summarised below. It is explained how the Dirichlet problem, as discussed above, fits into this framework. Then a detailed treatment of the Neumann problem from this point of view is given following {{harvtxt|Taylor|2011}}.

The Hilbert space formulation of boundary value problems for the Laplacian {{math|Δ}} on a bounded region {{math|Ω}} in the plane proceeds from the following data:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Folland|1995|pp=231–248}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* A closed subspace {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω) ⊆ ''H'' ⊆ H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}.
* A Dirichlet form for {{math|Δ}} given by a bounded Hermitian bilinear form {{math|''D''(&amp;thinsp;''f'', ''g'')}} defined for {{math|''f'', ''g'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} such that {{math|''D''(&amp;thinsp;''f'', ''g'') {{=}} (∆''f'', ''g'')}} for {{math|''f'', ''g'' ∈ H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}}.
* {{mvar|D}} is coercive, i.e. there is a positive constant {{mvar|C}} and a non-negative constant {{mvar|λ}} such that {{math|''D''(&amp;thinsp;''f'', ''f''&amp;thinsp;) ≥ ''C'' (&amp;thinsp;''f'', ''f''&amp;thinsp;)&lt;sub&gt;(1)&lt;/sub&gt; − ''λ''(&amp;thinsp;''f'', ''f''&amp;thinsp;)}}.

A '''weak solution''' of the boundary value problem given initial data {{mvar|f}} in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} is a function ''u'' satisfying

:&lt;math&gt; D(f,g)=(u,g)&lt;/math&gt;

for all ''g''. 

For both the Dirichlet and Neumann problem

:&lt;math&gt;D(f,g) = \left (f_x, g_x \right ) + \left (f_y, g_y \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

For the Dirichlet problem {{math|''H'' {{=}} H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω)}}. In this case

:&lt;math&gt;D(f,g) = (\Delta f,g), \qquad f, g \in H.&lt;/math&gt;

By the trace theorem the solution satisfies {{math|''u''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;Ω&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt;(∂Ω)}}.

For the Neumann problem {{mvar|H}} is taken to be {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}.

==Application to Neumann problem==
The classical Neumann problem on {{math|Ω}} consists in solving the boundary value problem

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases}
\Delta u =f, &amp; f, u \in C^{\infty}(\Omega^-),\\
\partial_n u =0 &amp; \text{on } \partial \Omega
\end{cases}
&lt;/math&gt;

[[Green's theorem]] implies that for {{math|''u'', ''v'' ∈ C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}}

:&lt;math&gt;(\Delta u,v)= (u_x,v_x) + (u_y,v_y) - (\partial_n u,v)_{\partial \Omega}.&lt;/math&gt;

Thus if {{math|Δ''u'' {{=}} 0}} in {{math|Ω}} and satisfies the Neumann boundary conditions, {{math|''u&lt;sub&gt;x&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} ''u&lt;sub&gt;y&lt;/sub&gt;'' {{=}} 0}}, and so {{mvar|u}} is constant in {{math|Ω}}.

Hence the Neumann problem has a unique solution up to adding constants.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Consider the Hermitian form on {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} defined by

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{D(f,g)=(u_x,v_x) + (u_y,v_y).}&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} is in duality with {{math|H{{su|p=−1|b=0}}(Ω)}}, there is a unique element {{math|''Lu''}} in {{math|H{{su|p=−1|b=0}}(Ω)}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{D(u,v) =(Lu,v).}&lt;/math&gt;

The map {{math|''I'' + ''L''}} is an isometry of {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} onto {{math|H{{su|p=−1|b=0}}(Ω)}}, so in particular {{mvar|L}} is bounded.

In fact

:&lt;math&gt;((L+I)u,v)=(u,v)_{(1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

So

:&lt;math&gt;\|(L+I)u\|_{(-1)} =\sup_{\|v\|_{(1)}=1} |((L+I)u,v)|= \sup_{\|v\|_{(1)}=1} |(u,v)_{(1)}|=\|u\|_{(1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

On the other hand, any {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} in {{math|H{{su|p=−1|b=0}}(Ω)}} defines a bounded conjugate-linear form on {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} sending {{mvar|v}} to {{math|(&amp;thinsp;''f'', ''v'')}}. By the [[Riesz–Fischer theorem]], there exists {{math|''u'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} such that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{(f,v)=(u,v)_{(1)}.}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence {{math|(''L'' + ''I'')''u'' {{=}} ''f''&amp;thinsp;}} and so {{math|''L'' + ''I''}} is surjective. Define a bounded linear operator {{mvar|T}} on {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} by

:&lt;math&gt;T=R_1(I+L)^{-1} R_0,&lt;/math&gt;

where {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the map {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) → L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, a compact operator, and {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the map {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω) → H{{su|p=−1|b=0}}(Ω)}}, its adjoint, so also compact.

The operator {{mvar|T}} has the following properties:

*{{mvar|T}} is a contraction since it is a composition of contractions
*{{mvar|T}} is compact, since {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} and {{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} are compact by Rellich's theorem
*{{mvar|T}} is self-adjoint, since if {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f'', ''g'' ∈ L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, they can be written {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f'' {{=}} (''L'' + ''I'')''u'', ''g'' {{=}} (''L'' + ''I'')''v''}} with {{math|''u'', ''v'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} so

::&lt;math&gt;(Tf,g)=(u,(I+L)v)=(u,v)_{(1)}=((I+L)u,v)= (f,Tg).&lt;/math&gt;

*{{mvar|T}} has positive spectrum and kernel {{math|(0)}}, for

::&lt;math&gt;(Tf,f)=(u,u)_{(1)}\ge 0,&lt;/math&gt;

:and {{math|''Tf'' {{=}} 0}} implies {{math|''u'' {{=}} 0}} and hence {{math|''f'' {{=}} 0}}.

*There is a complete orthonormal basis {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} of {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} consisting of eigenfunctions of {{mvar|T}}. Thus

::&lt;math&gt;Tf_n=\mu_nf_n&lt;/math&gt;

:with {{math|0 &lt; ''μ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' ≤ 1}} and {{math|''μ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} decreasing to {{math|0}}.

*The eigenfunctions all lie in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} since the image of {{mvar|T}} lies in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}.
*The {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are eigenfunctions of {{mvar|L}} with

::&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{Lf_n=\lambda_nf_n, \qquad \lambda_n=\mu_n^{-1} -1.}&lt;/math&gt;

:Thus {{math|''λ&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;''}} are non-negative and increase to {{math|∞}}.

*The eigenvalue {{math|0}} occurs with multiplicity one and corresponds to the constant function. For if {{math|''u'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} satisfies {{math|''Lu'' {{=}} 0}}, then

::&lt;math&gt;(u_x,u_x) + (u_y,u_y) = (Lu,u) = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

:so {{mvar|u}} is constant.

==Regularity for Neumann problem==

===Weak solutions are strong solutions===
The first main regularity result shows that a weak solution expressed in terms of the operator {{mvar|L}} and the Dirichlet form {{mvar|D}} is a strong solution in the classical sense, expressed in terms of the Laplacian {{math|Δ}} and the Neumann boundary conditions. Thus if {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''Tf''&amp;thinsp;}} with {{math|''u'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω), &amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; ∈ L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, then {{math|''u'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, satisfies {{math|Δ''u'' + ''u'' {{=}} ''f''&amp;thinsp;}} and {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;∂Ω&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}. Moreover, for some constant {{mvar|C}} independent of {{mvar|u}},

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{(2)} \le C\|\Delta u\|_{(0)} + C \|u\|_{(1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Note that

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{(1)} \le \|L u\|_{(-1)} +  \|u\|_{(0)},&lt;/math&gt;

since

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|u\|_{(1)}^2 &amp;=|(L u, u)| +\|u\|^2_{(0)}  \\
&amp;\le \|L u\|_{(-1)} \|u\|_{(1)} + \|u\|_{(0)} \|u\|_{(1)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Take a decomposition {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''ψu'' + (1 − ''ψ'')''u''}} with {{mvar|ψ}} supported in {{math|Ω}} and {{math|1 − ''ψ''}} supported in a collar of the boundary.

The operator {{mvar|L}} is characterized by

:&lt;math&gt;(Lf,g)= \left (f_x, g_x \right )+ \left (f_y, g_y \right )= (\Delta f, g)_\Omega - \left (\partial_n f, g \right )_{\partial\Omega}, \qquad f,g \in C^{\infty}(\Omega^-).&lt;/math&gt;

Then

:&lt;math&gt;([L,\psi]f,g)=([\Delta,\psi]f,g),&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle{[L,\psi]=-[L,1-\psi]=\Delta\psi +2\psi_x\partial_x + 2\psi_y\partial_y.}&lt;/math&gt;

The function {{math|''v'' {{=}} ''ψu''}} and {{math|''w'' {{=}} (1 − ''ψ'')''u''}} are treated separately, {{mvar|v}} being essentially subject to usual elliptic regularity considerations for interior points while {{mvar|w}} requires special treatment near the boundary using difference quotients. Once the strong properties are established in terms of {{math|∆}} and the Neumann boundary conditions, the "bootstrap" regularity results can be proved exactly as for the Dirichlet problem.

====Interior estimates==== 
The function {{math|''v'' {{=}} ''ψu''}} lies in {{math|H{{su|p=1|b=0}}(Ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;)}} where {{math|Ω&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;}} is a region with closure in {{math|Ω}}. If {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp; ∈ C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}} and {{math|''g'' ∈ C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}}

:&lt;math&gt;(Lf,g) = (\Delta f,g)_\Omega.&lt;/math&gt;

By continuity the same holds with {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} replaced by {{mvar|v}} and hence {{math|''Lv'' {{=}} ∆''v''}}. So

:&lt;math&gt;\Delta v= Lv=L(\psi u) =\psi Lu +[L,\psi]u=\psi(f-u) +[\Delta,\psi]u.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence regarding {{mvar|v}} as an element of {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}, {{math|∆''v'' ∈ L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Hence {{math|''v'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;('''T'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Since {{math|''v'' {{=}} ''φv''}} for {{math|''φ'' ∈ C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}}, we have {{math|''v'' ∈ H{{su|p=2|b=0}}(Ω)}}. Moreover,

:&lt;math&gt;\|v\|_{(2)}^2 = \|\Delta v\|^2 + 2\|v\|_{(1)}^2,&lt;/math&gt;

so that

:&lt;math&gt;\|v\|_{(2)} \le C \left ( \|\Delta(v)\|+  \|v\|_{(1)} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

====Boundary estimates==== 
The function {{math|''w'' {{=}} (1 − ''ψ'')''u''}} is supported in a collar contained in a tubular neighbourhood of the boundary. The difference quotients {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;w''}} can be formed for the flow {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}} and lie in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, so the first inequality is applicable:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|\delta_h w\|_{(1)} &amp;\le \|L \delta_h w\|_{(-1)} +  \|\delta_h w\|_{(0)} \\
&amp;\le \|[L, \delta_h] w\|_{(-1)} +\|\delta_h Lw\|_{(-1)} + \| \delta_h w\|_{(0)} \\
&amp;\le\|[L, \delta_h] w\|_{(-1)} +C\|Lw\|_{(0)}  +  C\| w\|_{(1)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The commutators {{math|[''L'', ''δ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'']}} are uniformly bounded as operators from {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} to {{math|H{{su|p=−1|b=0}}(Ω)}}. This is equivalent to checking the inequality

:&lt;math&gt;\left| \left( \left [L,\delta_h \right] g,h\right)\right| \le A\|g\|_{(1)}\|h\|_{(1)},&lt;/math&gt;

for {{mvar|g}}, {{mvar|h}} smooth functions on a collar. This can be checked directly on an annulus, using invariance of Sobolev spaces under dffeomorphisms and the fact that for the annulus the commutator of {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''}} with a differential operator is obtained by applying the difference operator to the coefficients after having applied {{math|''R&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;''}} to the function:&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Folland|1995|pp=255–260}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\left [ \delta^h, \sum a_\alpha \partial^\alpha \right ] = \left (\delta^h(a_\alpha)\circ R_h \right ) \partial^\alpha.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the difference quotients {{math|''δ&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;w''}} are uniformly bounded, and therefore {{math|''Yw'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} with

:&lt;math&gt;\|Y w\|_{(1)} \le C\|L w\|_{(0)} + C^\prime \|w\|_{(1)}.&lt;/math&gt;

Hence {{math|''Vw'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} and {{math|''Vw''}} satisfies a similar inequality to {{math|''Yw''}}:

:&lt;math&gt;\|V w\|_{(1)} \le C^{\prime\prime} \left ( \|L w\|_{(0)} + \|w\|_{(1)} \right ).&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{mvar|W}} be the orthogonal vector field. As for the Dirichlet problem, to show that {{math|''w'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, it suffices to show that {{math|''Ww'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}.

To check this, it is enough to show that {{math|''VWw'', ''W''&lt;sup&gt;&amp;thinsp;2&lt;/sup&gt;''u'' ∈ L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. As before

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
A &amp;= \Delta - V^2 - W^2\\ 
B &amp;= [V,W]
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

are vector fields. On the other hand, {{math|(''Lw'', ''φ'') {{=}} (∆''w'', ''φ'')}} for {{math|''φ'' ∈ C{{su|p=∞|b=''c''}}(Ω)}}, so that {{math|''Lw''}} and {{math|∆''w''}} define the same distribution on {{math|Ω}}. Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align} 
\left (W^2w, \varphi \right ) &amp;= \left (L w - V^2w - Au,\varphi \right ),\\
(VWw,\varphi) &amp;=(WVw + Bw,\varphi).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Since the terms on the right hand side are pairings with functions in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, the regularity criterion shows that {{math|''Ww'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. Hence {{math|''Lw'' {{=}} ∆''w''}} since both terms lie in {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} and have the same inner products with {{mvar|φ}}'s.

Moreover, the inequalities for {{math|''Vw''}} show that

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|Ww\|_{(1)} &amp; \le C \left (\|VWw\|_{(0)} + \left \|W^2w \right \|_{(0)} \right ) \\
&amp;\le C \left \| \left ( \Delta - V^2 -A \right )w \right \|_{(0)} + C \|(WV+B)w\|_{(0)} \\
&amp;\le C_1 \|L w\|_{(0)} + C_1 \|w\|_{(1)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|w\|_{(2)} &amp;\le C \left ( \|V w\|_{(1)} + \|W w\|_{(1)} \right ) \\
&amp;\le C^\prime \|\Delta w \|_{(0)} + C^\prime \| w \|_{(1)}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

It follows that {{math|''u'' {{=}} ''v'' + ''w'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}. Moreover,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\|u\|_{(2)} &amp;\le C \left ( \|\Delta v\| +\|\Delta w\| + \|v\|_{(1)} + \|w\|_{(1)} \right ) \\
&amp;\le C^\prime \left ( \|\psi\Delta u\| + \|(1-\psi)\Delta u\| + 2\|[\Delta, \psi] u\| +\|u\|_{(1)} \right ) \\
&amp;\le C^{\prime\prime} \left (\|\Delta u\| + \|u\|_{(1)} \right ).
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

====Neumann boundary conditions==== 
Since {{math|''u'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}}, Green's theorem is applicable by continuity. Thus for {{math|''v'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}},

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
(f,v) &amp;= (Lu,v) + (u,v) \\
&amp;= (u_x,v_x) + (u_y,v_y) +(u,v) \\
&amp;= ((\Delta+I)u,v) +(\partial_{n} u,v)_{\partial\Omega} \\
&amp;= (f,v) + (\partial_{n} u,v)_{\partial\Omega}.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Hence the Neumann boundary conditions are satisfied:

:&lt;math&gt;\partial_n u|_{\partial \Omega} = 0,&lt;/math&gt;

where the left hand side is regarded as an element of {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;½&lt;/sup&gt;(∂Ω)}} and hence {{math|L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;(∂Ω)}}.

===Regularity of strong solutions===
The main result here states that if {{math|''u'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+1&lt;/sup&gt; (''k'' ≥ 1), ∆''u'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;''k''&lt;/sup&gt;}} and {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''u''{{!}}&lt;sub&gt;∂Ω&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}}, then {{math|''u'' ∈ H&lt;sup&gt;''k''+2&lt;/sup&gt;}} and

:&lt;math&gt;\|u\|_{(k+2)} \le C\|\Delta u\|_{(k)} + C \|u\|_{(k+1)},&lt;/math&gt;

for some constant independent of {{mvar|u}}.

Like the corresponding result for the Dirichlet problem, this is proved by induction on {{math|''k'' ≥ 1}}. For {{math|''k'' {{=}} 1}}, {{mvar|u}} is also a weak solution of the Neumann problem so satisfies the estimate above for {{math|''k'' {{=}} 0}}. The Neumann boundary condition can be written

:&lt;math&gt;Zu|_{\partial\Omega}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{mvar|Z}} commutes with the vector field {{mvar|Y}} corresponding to the period flow {{math|''S&lt;sub&gt;t&lt;/sub&gt;''}}, the inductive method of proof used for the Dirichlet problem works equally well in this case: for the difference quotients {{math|''δ&lt;sup&gt;h&lt;/sup&gt;''}} preserve the boundary condition when expressed in terms of {{mvar|Z}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taylor|2011|p=348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Smoothness of eigenfunctions==== 
It follows by induction from the regularity theorem for the Neumann problem that the eigenfunctions of {{mvar|D}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} lie in {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Moreover, any solution of {{math|''Du'' {{=}} ''f''&amp;thinsp;}} with {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f''&amp;thinsp;}} in {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}} and {{mvar|u}} in {{math|H&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω)}} must have {{mvar|u}} in {{math|C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. In both cases by the vanishing properties, the normal derivatives of the eigenfunctions and {{mvar|u}} vanish on {{math|∂Ω}}.

====Solving the associated Neumann problem==== 
The method above can be used to solve the associated Neumann boundary value problem:

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{cases} \Delta f|_\Omega = 0 \\ \partial_n f|_{\partial\Omega} = g &amp; g \in C^{\infty}(\partial \Omega)\end{cases}&lt;/math&gt;

By Borel's lemma {{mvar|g}} is the restriction of a function {{math|''G'' ∈ C&lt;sup&gt;∞&lt;/sup&gt;(Ω&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;)}}. Let {{mvar|F}} be a smooth function such that {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''F'' {{=}} ''G''}} near the boundary. Let {{mvar|u}} be the solution of {{math|∆''u'' {{=}} −∆''F''}} with {{math|∂&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;''u'' {{=}} 0}}. Then {{math|&amp;thinsp;''f'' {{=}} ''u'' + ''F''}} solves the boundary value problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Folland|1995|p=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[mathematics]], '''transformation geometry''' (or '''transformational geometry''') is the name of a mathematical and [[pedagogic]] take on the study of [[geometry]] by focusing on [[group (mathematics)|groups]] of [[geometric transformation]]s, and properties that are [[invariant (mathematics)|invariant]] under them.  It is opposed to the classical [[synthetic geometry]] approach of [[Euclidean geometry]], that focuses on proving [[theorem]]s.

For example, within transformation geometry, the properties of an isosceles triangle are deduced from the fact that it is mapped to itself by a [[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] about a certain line. This contrasts with the classical proofs by the criteria for [[triangle congruence|congruence of triangles]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/Ulis/cgi-bin/ulis.pl?catno=68221&amp;set=4F331370_2_173&amp;database=g Georges Glaeser – The crisis of geometry teaching]&lt;/ref&gt;

The first systematic effort to use transformations as the foundation of geometry was made by [[Felix Klein]] in the 19th century, under the name [[Erlangen programme]].  For nearly a century this approach remained confined to mathematics research circles.   In the 20th century efforts were made to exploit it for [[mathematical education]].  [[Andrei Kolmogorov]] included  this approach (together with [[set theory]]) as part of a proposal for geometry teaching reform in [[Russia]].&lt;ref name="russianedu"/&gt;  These efforts culminated in the 1960s with the general reform of mathematics teaching known as the [[New Math]] movement.

== Pedagogy ==
An exploration of transformation geometry often begins with a study of [[reflection symmetry]] as found in daily life. The first real transformation is ''[[reflection (mathematics)|reflection]] in a line'' or ''reflection against an axis''. The [[composition (mathematics)|composition]] of two reflections results in a [[rotation]] when the lines intersect, or a [[translation (mathematics)|translation]] when they are parallel. Thus through transformations students learn about [[Euclidean plane isometry]]. For instance, consider reflection in a vertical line and a line inclined at 45° to the horizontal. One can observe that one composition yields a counter-clockwise quarter-turn (90°) while the reverse composition yields a clockwise quarter-turn. Such results show that transformation geometry includes [[non-commutative]] processes.

An entertaining application of reflection in a line occurs in a proof of the [[one-seventh area triangle]] found in any triangle.

Another transformation introduced to young students is the [[homothetic transformation|dilation]]. However, the [[inversive geometry#reflection in a circle|reflection in a circle]] transformation seems inappropriate for lower grades. Thus [[inversive geometry]], a larger study than grade school transformation geometry, is usually reserved for college students.

Experiments with concrete [[symmetry group]]s make way for abstract [[group theory]]. Other concrete activities use computations with [[complex number]]s, [[hypercomplex number]]s, or [[matrix (mathematics)|matrices]] to express transformation geometry.
Such transformation geometry lessons present an alternate view that contrasts with classical [[synthetic geometry]]. When students then encounter [[analytic geometry]], the ideas of [[coordinate rotations and reflections]] follow easily. All these concepts prepare for [[linear algebra]] where the [[reflection (linear algebra)|reflection concept]] is expanded.

Educators have shown some interest and described projects and experiences with transformation geometry for children from kindergarten to high school. In the case of very young age children, in order to avoid introducing new terminology and to make links with students' everyday experience with concrete objects, it was sometimes recommended to use words they are familiar with, like "flips" for line reflections, "slides" for translations, and "turns" for rotations, although these are not precise mathematical language. In some proposals, students start by performing with concrete objects before they perform the abstract transformations via their definitions of a mapping of each point of the figure.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/2319962 R.S. Millman – Kleinian transformation geometry, Amer. Math. Monthly 84 (1977)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001365/136586eo.pdf UNESCO - New trends in mathematics teaching, v.3, 1972 / pg. 8]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://scholarcommons.usf.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=4616&amp;context=etd Barbara Zorin – Geometric Transformations in Middle School Mathematics Textbooks]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0012/001248/124809eo.pdf UNESCO - Studies in mathematics education. Teaching of geometry]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an attempt to restructure the courses of geometry in Russia, Kolmogorov suggested presenting it under the point of view of transformations, so the geometry courses were structured based on [[set theory]]. This led to the appearance of the term "congruent" in schools, for figures that were before called "equal": since a figure was seen as a set of points, it could only be equal to itself, and two triangles that could be overlapped by isometries were said to be [[Congruence (geometry)|congruent]].&lt;ref name="russianedu"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=qwyBPybT4oMC&amp;printsec=frontcover Alexander Karp &amp; Bruce R. Vogeli – Russian Mathematics Education: Programs and Practices, Volume 5], pgs. 100–102&lt;/ref&gt;

One author expressed the importance of [[group theory]] to transformation geometry as follows:
:I have gone to some trouble to develop from first principles all the group theory that I need, with the intention that my book can serve as a first introduction to transformation groups, and the notions of abstract group theory if you have never seen these.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miles Reid]] &amp; Balázs Szendröi (2005) ''Geometry and Topology'', pg. xvii, [[Cambridge University Press]], {{isbn|0-521-61325-6}}, {{MathSciNet|id=2194744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18167">In [[computational complexity theory]], the language '''TQBF''' is a [[formal language]] consisting of the '''true quantified Boolean formulas'''.  A (fully) quantified Boolean formula is a formula in [[Quantification (logic)|quantified]] [[propositional logic]] where every variable is quantified (or [[Bound variable|bound]]), using either [[existential quantification|existential]] or [[universal quantification|universal]] quantifiers, at the beginning of the sentence. Such a formula is equivalent to either true or false (since there are no [[Bound variable|free]] variables). If such a formula evaluates to true, then that formula is in the language TQBF. It is also known as '''QSAT''' (Quantified [[Boolean satisfiability problem|SAT]]).

==Overview==
In computational complexity theory, the '''quantified Boolean formula problem''' ('''QBF''') is a generalization of the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]] in which both [[existential quantification|existential quantifiers]] and [[universal quantification|universal quantifiers]] can be applied to each variable. Put another way, it asks whether a quantified sentential form over a set of Boolean variables is true or false. For example, the following is an instance of QBF:

: &lt;math&gt;\forall x\  \exists y\  \exists z\  ((x  \lor z) \land y)&lt;/math&gt;

QBF is the canonical [[complete problem]] for [[PSPACE]], the class of problems solvable by a deterministic or nondeterministic [[Turing machine]] in polynomial space and unlimited time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=M. Garey  |author2=D. Johnson  |lastauthoramp=yes | title = [[Computers and Intractability: A Guide to the Theory of NP-Completeness]] | publisher = W. H. Freeman, San Francisco, California | year = 1979 | isbn = 0-7167-1045-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Given the formula in the form of an [[abstract syntax tree]], the problem can be solved easily by a set of mutually recursive procedures which evaluate the formula. Such an algorithm uses space proportional to the height of the tree, which is linear in the worst case, but uses time exponential in the number of quantifiers.

Provided that [[MA (complexity)|MA]] ⊊ PSPACE, which is widely believed, QBF cannot be solved, nor can a given solution even be verified, in either deterministic or [[probabilistic Turing machine|probabilistic]] polynomial time (in fact, unlike the satisfiability problem, there's no known way to specify a solution succinctly). It can be solved using an [[alternating Turing machine]] in linear time, since [[AP (complexity)|AP]] = PSPACE, where AP is the class of problems alternating machines can solve in polynomial time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = A. Chandra, D. Kozen, and [[Larry Stockmeyer|L. Stockmeyer]] | url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=322243 | title = Alternation | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 114&amp;ndash;133 | year = 1981 | doi = 10.1145/322234.322243}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the seminal result [[IP (complexity)|IP]] = PSPACE was shown (see [[interactive proof system]]), it was done by exhibiting an interactive proof system that could solve QBF by solving a particular arithmetization of the problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Adi Shamir| url = http://portal.acm.org/citation.cfm?doid=146585.146609 | title = Ip = Pspace | journal = Journal of the ACM | volume = 39 | issue = 4 | pages = 869&amp;ndash;877 | year = 1992 | doi = 10.1145/146585.146609}}&lt;/ref&gt;

QBF formulas have a number of useful canonical forms. For example, it can be shown that there is a [[polynomial-time many-one reduction]] that will move all quantifiers to the front of the formula and make them alternate between universal and existential quantifiers. There is another reduction that proved useful in the IP = PSPACE proof where no more than one universal quantifier is placed between each variable's use and the quantifier binding that variable. This was critical in limiting the number of products in certain subexpressions of the arithmetization.

== Prenex normal form ==

A fully quantified Boolean formula can be assumed to have a very specific form, called [[prenex normal form]]. It has two basic parts: a portion containing only quantifiers and a portion containing an unquantified Boolean formula usually denoted as &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle \phi&lt;/math&gt;. If there are &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle n&lt;/math&gt; Boolean variables, the entire formula can be written as

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  \exists x_1 \forall x_2 \exists x_3 \cdots Q_n x_n \phi(x_1, x_2, x_3, \dots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;

where every variable falls within the [[Free variables and bound variables|scope]] of some quantifier. By introducing dummy variables, any formula in prenex normal form can be converted into a sentence where existential and universal quantifiers alternate. Using the dummy variable &lt;math&gt;\displaystyle y_1&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\displaystyle  \exists x_1 \exists x_2 \phi(x_1, x_2) \quad \mapsto \quad
\exists x_1 \forall y_1 \exists x_2 \phi(x_1, x_2)&lt;/math&gt;

The second sentence has the same [[truth value]] but follows the restricted syntax. Assuming fully quantified Boolean formulas to be in prenex normal form is a frequent feature of proofs.

== Solving ==

There is a simple recursive algorithm for determining whether a QBF is in TQBF (i.e. is true).  Given some QBF

:&lt;math&gt;Q_1 x_1 Q_2 x_2 \cdots Q_n x_n \phi(x_1, x_2, \dots, x_n).&lt;/math&gt;

If the formula contains no quantifiers, we can just return the formula. Otherwise, we take off the first quantifier and check both possible values for the first variable:

:&lt;math&gt;A = Q_2 x_2 \cdots Q_n x_n \phi(0, x_2, \dots, x_n),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;B = Q_2 x_2 \cdots Q_n x_n \phi(1, x_2, \dots, x_n).&lt;/math&gt;

If &lt;math&gt;Q_1 = \exists&lt;/math&gt;, then return &lt;math&gt;A \lor B&lt;/math&gt;. If &lt;math&gt;Q_1 = \forall&lt;/math&gt;, then return &lt;math&gt;A \land B&lt;/math&gt;.

How fast does this algorithm run?
For every quantifier in the initial QBF, the algorithm makes two recursive calls on only a linearly smaller subproblem. This gives the algorithm an exponential runtime [[Big O notation|O(2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;)]].

How much space does this algorithm use?
Within each invocation of the algorithm, it needs to store the intermediate results of computing A and B.  Every recursive call takes off one quantifier, so the total recursive depth is linear in the number of quantifiers.  Formulas that lack quantifiers can be evaluated in space logarithmic in the number of variables. The initial QBF was fully quantified, so there are at least as many quantifiers as variables.  Thus, this algorithm uses ''O''(''n'' + log ''n'') = ''O''(''n'') space. This makes the TQBF language part of the [[PSPACE]] [[complexity class]].

== PSPACE-completeness ==

The TQBF language serves in [[computational complexity theory|complexity theory]] as the canonical [[PSPACE-complete]] problem. Being PSPACE-complete means that a language is in PSPACE and that the language is also [[PSPACE-hard]].  The algorithm above shows that TQBF is in PSPACE.
Showing that TQBF is PSPACE-hard requires showing that any language in the complexity class PSPACE can be reduced to TQBF in polynomial time. I.e.,

:&lt;math&gt;\forall L\in \mathsf{PSPACE}, L\leq_p \mathrm{TQBF}.&lt;/math&gt;

This means that, for a PSPACE language L, whether an input {{mvar|x}} is in L can be decided by checking whether &lt;math&gt;f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is in TQBF, for some function {{mvar|f}} that is required to run in polynomial time (relative to the length of the input) Symbolically,

:&lt;math&gt;x\in L\iff f(x)\in \mathrm{TQBF}.&lt;/math&gt;

Proving that TQBF is PSPACE-hard, requires specification of {{mvar|f}}.

So, suppose that L is a PSPACE language. This means that L can be decided by a polynomial space deterministic [[Turing machine]] (DTM). This is very important for the reduction of L to TQBF, because the configurations of any such Turing Machine can be represented as Boolean formulas, with Boolean variables representing the state of the machine as well as the contents of each cell on the Turing Machine tape, with the position of the Turing Machine head encoded in the formula by the formula's ordering. In particular, our reduction will use the variables &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt;, which represent two possible configurations of the DTM for L, and a natural number t, in constructing a QBF &lt;math&gt;\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}&lt;/math&gt; which is true if and only if the DTM for L can go from the configuration encoded in &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; to the configuration encoded in &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; in no more than t steps. The function {{mvar|f}}, then, will construct from the DTM for L a QBF &lt;math&gt;\phi_{c_{start},c_{accept},T}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c_{start}&lt;/math&gt; is the DTM's starting configuration, &lt;math&gt;c_{accept}&lt;/math&gt; is the DTM's accepting configuration, and T is the maximum number of steps the DTM could need to move from one configuration to the other. We know that ''T'' = [[Big-o notation|''O''(exp(''n''))]], where n is the length of the input, because this bounds the total number of possible configurations of the relevant DTM. Of course, it cannot take the DTM more steps than there are possible configurations to reach &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm{accept}&lt;/math&gt; unless it enters a loop, in which case it will never reach &lt;math&gt;c_\mathrm{accept}&lt;/math&gt; anyway.

At this stage of the proof, we have already reduced the question of whether an input formula {{mvar|w}} (encoded, of course, in &lt;math&gt;c_{start}&lt;/math&gt;) is in L to the question of whether the QBF &lt;math&gt;\phi_{c_{start},c_{accept},T}&lt;/math&gt;, i.e., &lt;math&gt;f(w)&lt;/math&gt;, is in TQBF. The remainder of this proof proves that {{mvar|f}} can be computed in polynomial time.

For &lt;math&gt;t=1&lt;/math&gt;, computation of &lt;math&gt;\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}&lt;/math&gt; is straightforward—either one of the configurations changes to the other in one step or it does not. Since the Turing Machine that our formula represents is deterministic, this presents no problem.

For &lt;math&gt;t&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;, computation of &lt;math&gt;\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}&lt;/math&gt; involves a recursive evaluation, looking for a so-called "middle point" &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt;. In this case, we rewrite the formula as follows:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}=\exists m_1(\phi_{c_1,m_1,\lceil t/2\rceil}\wedge\phi_{m_1,c_2,\lceil t/2\rceil}).&lt;/math&gt;

This converts the question of whether &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; can reach &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; in t steps to the question of whether &lt;math&gt;c_1&lt;/math&gt; reaches a middle point &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;t/2&lt;/math&gt; steps, which itself reaches &lt;math&gt;c_2&lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt;t/2&lt;/math&gt; steps. The answer to the latter question of course gives the answer to the former.

Now, t is only bounded by T, which is exponential (and so not polynomial) in the length of the input. Additionally, each recursive layer virtually doubles the length of the formula. (The variable &lt;math&gt;m_1&lt;/math&gt; is only one midpoint—for greater t, there are more stops along the way, so to speak.) So the time required to recursively evaluate &lt;math&gt;\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}&lt;/math&gt; in this manner could be exponential as well, simply because the formula could become exponentially large. This problem is solved by universally quantifying using variables &lt;math&gt;c_3&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;c_4&lt;/math&gt; over the configuration pairs (e.g., &lt;math&gt;\{ (c_1,m_1),(m_1,c_2)\}&lt;/math&gt;), which prevents the length of the formula from expanding due to recursive layers. This yields the following interpretation of &lt;math&gt;\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}=\exists m_1\forall (c_3,c_4)\in \{ (c_1,m_1),(m_1,c_2)\}(\phi_{c_3,c_4,\lceil t/2\rceil}).&lt;/math&gt;

This version of the formula can indeed be computed in polynomial time, since any one instance of it can be computed in polynomial time. The universally quantified ordered pair simply tells us that whichever choice of &lt;math&gt;(c_3,c_4)&lt;/math&gt; is made, &lt;math&gt;\phi_{c_1,c_2,t}\iff\phi_{c_3,c_4,\lceil t/2\rceil}&lt;/math&gt;.

Thus, &lt;math&gt;\forall L\in \mathsf{PSPACE}, L\leq_p \mathrm{TQBF}&lt;/math&gt;, so TQBF is PSPACE-hard. Together with the above result that TQBF is in PSPACE, this completes the proof that TQBF is a PSPACE-complete language.

(This proof follows Sipser 2006 pp.&amp;nbsp;310–313 in all essentials. Papadimitriou 1994 also includes a proof.)

==Miscellany==

*One important subproblem in TQBF is the [[Boolean satisfiability problem]].  In this problem, you wish to know whether a given Boolean formula &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; can be made true with some assignment of variables.  This is equivalent to the TQBF using only existential quantifiers:

:: &lt;math&gt;\exists x_1 \cdots \exists x_n \phi(x_1, \ldots, x_n)&lt;/math&gt;

:This is also an example of the larger result NP &lt;math&gt;\subseteq&lt;/math&gt; PSPACE which follows directly from the observation that a polynomial time   verifier for a proof of a language accepted by a NTM ([[Non-deterministic Turing machine]]) requires polynomial space to store the proof.
*Any class in the [[polynomial hierarchy]] ([[PH (complexity)|PH]]) has TQBF as a hard problem. In other words, for the class comprising all languages L for which there exists a poly-time TM V, a verifier, such that for all input x and some constant i,

:: &lt;math&gt;x \in L \Leftrightarrow \exists y_1 \forall y_2 \cdots Q_i y_i \  V(x,y_1,y_2,\dots,y_i)\ =\ 1&lt;/math&gt;

: which has a specific QBF formulation that is given as

:: &lt;math&gt;\exists \phi&lt;/math&gt;  such that &lt;math&gt;\exists \vec{x_1} \forall \vec{x_2} \cdots Q_i \vec{x_i}\  \phi(\vec{x_1},\vec{x_2},\dots,\vec{x_i})\ =\ 1&lt;/math&gt;

:where the &lt;math&gt;\vec{x_i}&lt;/math&gt;'s are vectors of Boolean variables.
*It is important to note that while TQBF the language is defined as the collection of true quantified Boolean formulas, the abbreviation TQBF is often used (even in this article) to stand for a totally quantified Boolean formula, often simply called a QBF (quantified Boolean formula, understood as "fully" or "totally" quantified). It is important to distinguish contextually between the two uses of the abbreviation TQBF in reading the literature.
*A TQBF can be thought of as a game played between two players, with alternating moves. Existentially quantified variables are equivalent to the notion that a move is available to a player at a turn. Universally quantified variables mean that the outcome of the game does not depend on what move a player makes at that turn. Also, a TQBF whose first quantifier is existential corresponds to a [[formula game]] in which the first player has a winning strategy.
*A TQBF for which the quantified formula is in [[conjunctive normal form|2-CNF]] may be solved in [[linear time]], by an algorithm involving [[strongly connected component|strong connectivity analysis]] of its [[implication graph]]. The [[2-satisfiability]] problem is a special case of TQBF for these formulas, in which every quantifier is existential.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

Representing a joint distribution as univariate margins plus copulas allows the separation of the problems of estimating univariate distributions from the problems of estimating dependence. This is handy in as much as univariate distributions in many cases can be adequately estimated from data, whereas dependence information is rough known, involving summary indicators and judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

Although the number of parametric multivariate copula families with flexible dependence is limited, there are many parametric families of bivariate copulas. Regular vines owe their increasing popularity to the fact that they leverage from bivariate copulas and enable extensions to arbitrary dimensions.

== Historical origins ==
The first regular vine, avant la lettre, was introduced by Harry Joe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

The motive was to extend parametric bivariate extreme value copula families to higher dimensions. To this end he introduced what would later be called the ''D-vine''. Joe

was interested in a class of n-variate distributions with given one dimensional margins, and ''n''(''n'' − 1) dependence parameters, whereby ''n'' − 1 parameters correspond to bivariate margins, and the others correspond to conditional bivariate margins. In the case of multivariate normal distributions, the parameters would be ''n'' − 1 correlations and (''n'' − 1)(''n'' − 2)/2 [[partial correlation]]s, which were noted to be algebraically independent in (−1,&amp;nbsp;1).

An entirely different motivation underlay the first formal definition of vines in Cooke.&lt;ref name="Cooke 1997"&gt;{{cite conference

Dependence information for such studies had been captured with ''Markov trees'',

which are trees constructed with nodes as univariate random variables and edges as bivariate copulas. For ''n'' variables, there are at most ''n'' − 1 edges for which dependence can be specified. New techniques at that time involved obtaining uncertainty distributions on modeling parameters by eliciting experts' uncertainties on other variables which are predicted by the models. These uncertainty distributions are pulled back onto the model's parameters by a process known as probabilistic inversion.
&lt;ref name="Kurowicka&amp;Cooke 2006" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Gossens 2000" /&gt;
The resulting distributions often displayed a dependence structure that could not be captured as a Markov tree.

[[Graphical model]]s called ''vines'' were introduced in

&lt;ref name="Kurowicka&amp;Cooke 2006" /&gt;
&lt;ref name="Cooke 1997" /&gt; An important feature of vines is that they can add conditional dependencies among variables on top of a Markov tree which is generally too parsimonious to summarize the dependence among variables.

[[File:C-Vine on 4 variables.png|thumb|upright=1.2|C-vine on 4 variables]]
[[File:D-Vine on 4 variables.png|thumb|upright=1.2|D-vine on 4 variables]]
[[File:Regular vine on 5 variables.png|thumb|upright=1.2|R-vine on 5 variables]]
A vine {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''V'''&lt;/var&gt;}} on ''n'' variables is a nested set of connected trees where the edges in the first tree are the nodes of the second tree, the edges of the second tree are the nodes of the third tree, etc. 
A ''regular vine'' or ''R-vine'' on ''n'' variables is a vine in which two edges in tree {{math|&lt;var&gt;j&lt;/var&gt;}} are joined by an edge in tree ''j'' + 1 only if these edges share a common node, ''j'' = 1, &amp;hellip;, ''n'' &amp;minus; 2. The nodes in the first tree are univariate random variables. The edges are constraints or conditional constraints explained as follows.

Recall that an edge in a tree is an unordered set of two nodes.  Each edge in a vine is associated with a ''constraint set'', being the set of variables (nodes in first tree) reachable by the set membership relation. For each edge, the constraint set is the union of  the constraint sets of the edge's two members called its component constraint sets  (for an edge in the first tree, the component  constraint sets are empty).  The constraint associated with each edge is now the symmetric difference of its component constraint sets conditional on the intersection of its constraint sets. One can show that for a regular vine, the symmetric difference of the component constraint sets is always a doubleton and that each pair of variables occurs exactly once as constrained variables. In other words, all constraints are bivariate or conditional bivariate.

The degree of a node is the number of edges attaching to it. The simplest regular vines have the simplest degree structure; the D-Vine assigns every node degree 1 or 2, the C-Vine assigns one node in each tree the maximal degree. For large vines, it is clearer to draw each tree separately.

The number of regular vines on ''n'' variables grows rapidly in ''n'': there are 2&lt;sup&gt;''n''&amp;minus;3&lt;/sup&gt; ways of extending a regular vine with one additional variable, and there are ''n''(''n'' &amp;minus; 1)(''n'' &amp;minus; 2)!2&lt;sup&gt;(''n'' &amp;minus; 2)(''n'' &amp;minus; 3)/2&lt;/sup&gt;/2 labeled regular vines on ''n'' variables

The constraints on a regular vine may be associated with ''partial correlations'' or with ''conditional bivariate copula''.  In the former case, we speak of a ''partial correlation vine'', and in the latter case of a ''vine copula''.

=== Partial correlation vines ===
Bedford and Cooke &lt;ref name="Bedford&amp;Cooke 2002" /&gt; show that any assignment of values in the open interval (−1,&amp;nbsp;1) to the edges in any partial correlation vine is consistent, the assignments are algebraically independent, and there is a one-to-one relation between all such assignments and the set of correlation matrices. In other words, partial correlation vines provide an algebraically independent parametrization of the set of correlation matrices, whose terms have an intuitive interpretation.  Moreover, the determinant of the correlation matrix is the product over the edges of (1 &amp;minus; ''&amp;rho;''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;sub&gt;''ik'';''D''(''ik'')&lt;/sub&gt;) where ''&amp;rho;''&lt;sub&gt;''ik'';''D''(''ik'')&lt;/sub&gt; is the partial correlation assigned to the edge with conditioned variables ''i'',''k'' and conditioning variables ''D''(''ik''). A similar decomposition characterizes the [[mutual information]], which generalizes the determinant of the correlation matrix.&lt;ref name="Cooke 1997" /&gt;  These features have been used in constrained sampling of correlation matrices,&lt;ref name="Lewandowski 2009" /&gt; building non-parametric continuous Bayesian networks &lt;ref name="Hanea 2008" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hanea 2010" /&gt; and addressing the problem of extending partially specified matrices to positive definite matrices

=== Vine copulas or pair-copula construction ===
Under suitable differentiability conditions, any multivariate density ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&amp;hellip;''n''&lt;/sub&gt; on ''n'' variables, with univariate densities ''f''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;,&amp;hellip;,''f''&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;, may be represented in closed form as a product of univariate densities and (conditional) copula densities on any R-vine {{math|&lt;var&gt;'''V'''&lt;/var&gt;}}

When the conditional copulas do not depend on the values of the conditioning variables, one speaks of the ''simplifying assumption'' of constant conditional copulas. Though most applications invoke this assumption, exploring the modelling freedom gained by discharging this assumption has begun

Vine researchers have developed algorithms for maximum likelihood estimation and simulation of vine copulas, finding truncated vines that summarize the dependence in the data, enumerating through vines, etc. Chapter 6 of ''Dependence Modeling with Copulas''&lt;ref name="Joe 2014"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; summarizes these algorithms in pseudocode.

== Parameter estimation ==
For parametric vine copulas, with a bivariate copula family on each edge of a vine, algorithms and software are available for maximum likelihood estimation of copula parameters, assuming data have been transformed to uniform scores after fitting univariate margins. There are also available algorithms (e.g., 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
  |last1 = Brechmann |first1 = E.C.
  |last2 = Czado |first2 = C.
  |last3 = Aas |first3 = K.
  |title = Truncated regular vines in high dimensions with application to financial data

  |doi=10.1002/cjs.10141
}}&lt;/ref&gt;) 
for choosing good truncated regular vines where edges of high-level trees are taken as conditional independence. These algorithms assign variables with strong dependence or strong conditional dependence to low order trees in order that higher order trees have weak conditional dependence or conditional independence. Hence parsimonious truncated vines are obtained for a large number of variables. Software with a user interface in R are available (e.g., 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 |last1 = Schepsmeier |first1 = U.
 |last2 = Stoeber |first2 = J.
 |last3 = Brechmann |first3 = E.C.
 |last4 = Graeler |first4 = B.

 |year = 2014
 |url = http://artax.karlin.mff.cuni.cz/r-help/library/VineCopula/html/VineCopula-package.html
}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

== Sampling and conditionalizing ==
A sampling order for {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} variables is a sequence of conditional densities in which the first density is unconditional, and the densities for other variables are conditioned on the preceding variables in the ordering. A sampling order is ''implied by a regular-vine'' representation of the density if each conditional density can be written as a product of copula densities in the vine and one dimensional margins.&lt;ref name="Cooke 2015" /&gt;
 
An implied sampling order is generated by a nested sequence of subvines where each sub-vine in the sequence contains one new variable not present in the preceding sub-vine. For any regular vine on {{math|&lt;var&gt;n&lt;/var&gt;}} variables there are {{math|&lt;var&gt;2&lt;sup&gt;n&amp;minus;1&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/var&gt;}} implied sampling orders. Implied sampling orders are a small
subset of all {{math|&lt;var&gt;n!&lt;/var&gt;}} orders but they greatly facilitate sampling. Conditionalizing a regular vine on values of an arbitrary subset of variables is a complex operation. However, conditionalizing on an initial sequence of an implied sampling order is trivial, one simply plugs in the initial conditional values and proceeds with the sampling. A general theory of conditionalization does not exist at present.

A '''Wilson prime''', named after [[English people|English]] mathematician [[John Wilson (mathematician)|John Wilson]], is a [[prime number]] ''p'' such that ''p''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; [[divides]] (''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)!&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1, where "!" denotes the [[factorial function]]; compare this with [[Wilson's theorem]], which states that every prime ''p'' divides (''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1)!&amp;nbsp;+&amp;nbsp;1.

The only known Wilson primes are [[5 (number)|5]], [[13 (number)|13]], and [[563 (number)|563]] {{OEIS|id=A007540}}; if any others exist, they must be greater than 2{{e|13}}.&lt;ref name="Search"&gt;[https://arxiv.org/pdf/1209.3436v2.pdf A Search for Wilson primes] Retrieved on November 2, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been [[conjecture]]d that infinitely many Wilson primes exist, and that the number of Wilson primes in an interval [''x'',&amp;nbsp;''y''] is about log(log(''y'')/log(''x'')).&lt;ref&gt;[http://primes.utm.edu/glossary/page.php?sort=WilsonPrime The Prime Glossary: Wilson prime]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generalizations==

===Wilson primes of order {{mvar|n}} ===
Wilson's theorem can be expressed in general as &lt;math&gt;(n-1)!(p-n)!\equiv(-1)^n\ \bmod p&lt;/math&gt; for every integer &lt;math&gt;n \ge 1&lt;/math&gt; and prime &lt;math&gt;p \ge n&lt;/math&gt;. Generalized Wilson primes of order {{mvar|n}} are the primes {{mvar|p}} such that &lt;math&gt;p^2&lt;/math&gt; divides &lt;math&gt;(n-1)!(p-n)! - (-1)^n&lt;/math&gt;.

It was conjectured that for every natural number {{mvar|n}}, there are infinitely many Wilson primes of order {{mvar|n}}.

A '''Wilson number''' is a natural number ''n'' such that ''W''(''n'') ≡ 0 (mod ''n''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), where &lt;math&gt;W(n) = \prod_\stackrel{1 \le k \le n}{\gcd(k,n)=1}{k}+e&lt;/math&gt;, the constant ''e'' = 1 [[if and only if]] ''n'' have a [[primitive root modulo n|primitive root]], otherwise, ''e'' = -1&lt;ref&gt;see [[Wilson's theorem#Gauss.27s generalization|Gauss's generalization of Wilson's theorem]]&lt;/ref&gt; For every natural number ''n'', ''W''(''n'') is divisible by ''n'', and the quotients (called generalized [[Wilson quotient]]s) are listed in {{oeis|id=A157249}}. The Wilson numbers are
:1, 5, 13, 563, 5971, 558771, 1964215, 8121909, 12326713, 23025711, 26921605, 341569806, 399292158, ... {{OEIS|id=A157250}}

If a Wilson number ''n'' is prime, then ''n'' is a Wilson prime. There are 13 Wilson numbers up to 5{{e|8}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1090/S0025-5718-98-00951-X |  first1 = Takashi | last1 = Agoh | first2 = Karl | last2 = Dilcher | first3 = Ladislav | last3 = Skula | authorlink3 = Ladislav Skula| title=Wilson quotients for composite moduli | journal=Math.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5698">In [[number theory]], '''Zolotarev's lemma''' states that the [[Legendre symbol]]

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{p}\right)&lt;/math&gt;

for an integer ''a'' [[modular arithmetic|modulo]] an odd [[prime number]] ''p'', where ''p'' does not divide ''a'', can be computed as the sign of a permutation:

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{p}\right) = \varepsilon(\pi_a)&lt;/math&gt;

where ε denotes the [[signature of a permutation]] and π&lt;sub&gt;''a''&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[permutation]] of the nonzero [[residue class]]es mod ''p'' induced by [[modular multiplication|multiplication]] by ''a''.

For example, take ''a'' = 2 and ''p'' = 7. The nonzero squares mod 7 are 1, 2, and 4, so (2|7) =&amp;nbsp;1 and (6|7) =&amp;nbsp;−1. Multiplication by 2 on the nonzero numbers mod 7 has the cycle decomposition (1,2,4)(3,6,5), so the sign of this permutation is 1, which is (2|7). Multiplication by 6 on the nonzero numbers mod 7 has cycle decomposition (1,6)(2,5)(3,4), whose sign is −1, which is (6|7).

==Proof==
In general, for any [[finite group]] ''G'' of order ''n'', it is straightforward to determine the signature of the permutation π&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; made by left-multiplication by the element ''g'' of ''G''. The permutation π&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; will be even, unless there are an odd number of [[orbit (group theory)|orbits]] of even size. Assuming ''n'' even, therefore, the condition for π&lt;sub&gt;''g''&lt;/sub&gt; to be an odd permutation, when ''g'' has order ''k'', is that ''n''/''k'' should be odd, or that the subgroup &lt;''g''&gt; generated by ''g'' should have odd [[Index of a subgroup|index]].

We will apply this to the group of nonzero numbers mod ''p'', which is a [[cyclic group]] of order ''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1. The ''j''th power of a [[primitive root modulo p]] will by [[index calculus]] have index the [[greatest common divisor]]

:''i'' = (''j'', ''p'' &amp;minus; 1).

The condition for a nonzero number mod ''p'' to be an [[quadratic non-residue]] is to be an odd power of a primitive root.
The lemma therefore comes down to saying that ''i'' is odd when ''j'' is odd, which is true ''a fortiori'', and ''j'' is odd when ''i'' is odd, which is true because ''p''&amp;nbsp;&amp;minus;&amp;nbsp;1 is even (''p'' is odd).

==Another proof==
Zolotarev's lemma can be deduced easily from [[Gauss's lemma (number theory)|Gauss's lemma]] and ''vice versa''. The example
:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{3}{11}\right)&lt;/math&gt;,
i.e. the Legendre symbol (''a''/''p'') with ''a''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;3 and ''p''&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;11, will illustrate how the proof goes. Start with the set {1,&amp;nbsp;2,&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;''p''&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;1} arranged as a matrix of two rows such that the sum of the two elements in any column is zero mod&amp;nbsp;''p'', say:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 1
| 2
| 3
| 4
| 5
|-
| 10
| 9
| 8
| 7
| 6
|}
Apply the permutation &lt;math&gt;U: x\mapsto ax\pmod p&lt;/math&gt;:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 3
| 6
| 9
| 1
| 4
|-
| 8
| 5
| 2
| 10
| 7
|}
The columns still have the property that the sum of two elements in one column is zero mod ''p''. Now apply a permutation ''V'' which swaps any pairs in which the upper member was originally a lower member:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 3
| 5
| 2
| 1
| 4
|-
| 8
| 6
| 9
| 10
| 7
|}
Finally, apply a permutation W which gets back the original matrix:
{| class="wikitable"
|-
| 1
| 2
| 3
| 4
| 5
|-
| 10
| 9
| 8
| 7
| 6
|}
We have ''W''&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;''VU''. Zolotarev's lemma says (''a''/''p'')&amp;nbsp;=&amp;nbsp;1 if and only if the permutation ''U'' is even. Gauss's lemma says (''a/p'') =&amp;nbsp;1 iff ''V'' is even. But ''W'' is even, so the two lemmas are equivalent for the given (but arbitrary) ''a'' and&amp;nbsp;''p''.

==Jacobi symbol==

This interpretation of the Legendre symbol as the sign of a permutation can be extended to the [[Jacobi symbol]]

:&lt;math&gt;\left(\frac{a}{n}\right),&lt;/math&gt;

where ''a'' and ''n'' are relatively prime odd integers with ''n'' &gt; 0: ''a'' is invertible mod ''n'', so multiplication by ''a'' on '''Z'''/''n'''''Z''' is a permutation and a generalization of Zolotarev's lemma is that the Jacobi symbol above is the sign of this permutation.

For example, multiplication by 2 on '''Z'''/21'''Z''' has cycle decomposition (0)(1,2,4,8,16,11)(3,6,12)(5,10,20,19,17,13)(7,14)(9,18,15), so the sign of this permutation is (1)(−1)(1)(−1)(−1)(1) = −1 and the Jacobi symbol (2|21) is&amp;nbsp;−1.  (Note that multiplication by 2 on the units mod 21 is a product of two 6-cycles, so its sign is 1. Thus it's important to use ''all'' integers mod ''n'' and not just the units mod ''n'' to define the right permutation.)

When ''n'' = ''p'' is an odd prime and ''a'' is not divisible by ''p'', multiplication by ''a'' fixes 0 mod ''p'', so the sign of multiplication by ''a'' on all numbers mod ''p'' and on the units mod ''p'' have the same sign. But for composite ''n'' that is not the case, as we see in the example above.

==History==
This lemma was introduced by [[Yegor Ivanovich Zolotarev]] in an 1872 proof of [[quadratic reciprocity]].
