'''Adrianne Wadewitz''' (January 6, 1977&amp;nbsp;– April 8, 2014) was an American [[feminist]] scholar of 18th-century [[British literature]], and a noted [[Wikipedian]] and commenter upon [[Wikipedia]], particularly focusing on gender issues. In April 2014, Wadewitz died from head injuries from a fall while [[rock climbing]].

==Early life==

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Academic career==

===Education===
Wadewitz graduated ''[[magna cum laude]]'' from [[Columbia University]], and later received her [[Master's degree|masters]] and [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctoral]] degrees in British literature with a minor in 18th-century studies from [[Indiana University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She completed both a [[master's thesis]], ''Doubting Thomas': The Failure of Religious Appropriation in The Age of Reason'' (2003),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her [[doctoral dissertation]], '''Spare the Sympathy, Spoil the Child:' Sensibility, Selfhood, and the Maturing Reader, 1775–1815'' (2011).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation

  | publisher = ProQuest Dissertations and Theses
  | place     = Ann Arbor, MI
  }}. Order Number 3466388. Indiana University.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her dissertation combined her research interests in archival work, children's literature, and gender studies. In it, Wadewitz studied the use of language and discursive strategies such as embedded narratives in children's books by [[Mary Wollstonecraft]], [[Anna Laetitia Barbauld]], [[Charlotte Turner Smith|Charlotte Smith]], [[Maria Edgeworth]], and others. She argued that through such reading, the child was supported in the construction of a "sympathetic self" that was "collective, benevolent, and imaginative."&lt;ref name="Wadewitz 2011 vi"&gt;Wadewitz (2011), p. vi&lt;/ref&gt; She also argued that the kinds of subjectivity displayed in late eighteenth-century children's literature challenged "the dominant Lockean model" by drawing upon "Rousseau's theory of education and the discourse of sensibility to construct a 'sympathetic self.' [...] Significantly, this 'sympathetic self' was available to both sexes and to children. Unlike other versions of the self based on sensibility, it was not predicated upon femininity. Moreover, maturation did not depend on age, but rather on one's state of mind; any person educated through this sympathetic literature could be an adult and participate in civic society through, for example, charitable acts."&lt;ref name="Wadewitz 2011 vi"/&gt; Moreover, through its analysis of "how childhood reading informed the reading of 'adult' novels by [[Jane Austen]]," it argued that "contemporary readers of Austen would have read her novels 'didactically' and followed the structural patterns of the children's literature they grew up reading rather than seeing the irony we value today."&lt;ref&gt;Wadewitz (2011), p. vii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Digital humanities===
In 2009, Wadewitz began putting ''[[The New England Primer]]'' online, culminating in a permanent online exhibit in 2012, with text and annotated transcriptions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cdlrsandbox.org/neprimer/index.html New England Primer] exhibit and analysis, 2012. Retrieved April 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

She published on topics including 18th-century children's literature, ambiguity in historical scholarship, and use of Wikipedia in the classroom.&lt;ref name=works&gt;[http://works.bepress.com/adrianne_wadewitz/doctype.html Selected Works of Adrianne Wadewitz], [http://scholar.oxy.edu/ OxyScholar Digital Repository], Occidental College. Retrieved April 21, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing about the use of Wikipedia in education, she argued that in addition to traditional writing and research skills, students should develop skills in media and technological literacy. Reflecting on the construction of knowledge, she emphasized the need to assess sources; distinguish between fact-based and persuasive writing; and be aware of authority and legitimacy. She promoted the development of curricula that included collaborative writing, development of writing skills in the context of a "community of practice", and writing for a global readership.&lt;ref name=works/&gt;

==Wikipedia editing and advocacy==
[[File:The Impact of Wikipedia Adrianne Wadewitz.webm|thumb|350px|Wadewitz's video, "The Impact of Wikipedia"]]
Wadewitz made her first edit on Wikipedia in 2004,&lt;ref name=corriere&gt;{{cite web

  | archivedate=April 27, 2014
}}&lt;/ref&gt; and went on to create articles on female writers and scholars, several of them becoming [[Wikipedia:Featured articles|featured articles]]. She originally edited anonymously for several years before revealing her gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; She made nearly 50,000 edits in all.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

As a major promoter of getting more women to edit Wikipedia to help end [[systematic bias]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; she said, "We need more female editors, more feminists (who can be editors of any gender), and more editors willing to work on content related to women. The single most [[underrepresented group]] on Wikipedia is married women of color with children."&lt;ref name=college&gt;{{cite web
  | work        = [[USA Today]]

  | deadurl     = no
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She increasingly became seen as an authority on Wikipedia, and particularly on the encyclopedia's gender issues, and was cited as such by organizations such as the [[BBC]].&lt;ref name=bbc&gt;{{cite news
  | date        = April 7, 2014

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wadewitz also served on the board of the [[Wikipedia:Wiki Education Foundation|Wiki Education Foundation]].&lt;ref name=bbc/&gt;

==Climbing==
Wadewitz enjoyed [[rock climbing]], which she described in 2013 as enabling "a new narrative about herself beyond that of a bookish, piano-playing Wikipedia contributor":&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;&lt;ref name="worststudent"&gt;{{cite web
  | url         = https://www.hastac.org/blogs/wadewitz/2013/08/12/what-i-learned-worst-student-class
  | last        = Wadewitz
  | first       = Adrianne
  | title       = What I learned as the worst student in the class
  | publisher   = HASTAC

  | deadurl     = no
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{bq|"For me, one of the most empowering outcomes of my year of climbing has been the new narrative I can tell about myself. I am no longer 'Adrianne: scholar, book lover, pianist, and Wikipedian'. I am now 'Adrianne: scholar, book lover, pianist, Wikipedian, and rock climber'. This was brought home most vividly to me one day when I was climbing outdoors here in Los Angeles and people on the beach were marveling at those of us climbing. Suddenly I realized, I used to be the person saying how crazy or impossible such feats were and now I was the one doing them. I had radically switched subject positions in a way I did not think possible for myself. That, I realized, is what I want my students to experience—that radical switch and growth. It is an enormous goal and I would love to hear how others work at achieving it with their students."&lt;ref name="worststudent" /&gt;}}

== Concept ==
'''Agrihoods''' are based around the concept of integrating farms and gardens into neighborhoods, or vice versa.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This integration in turn allows for communities to supply themselves with food. Most of this food production is heavily influenced by [[Organic architecture|organic]] and [[sustainable agriculture]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://theplate.nationalgeographic.com/2014/06/23/its-a-beautiful-day-in-the-agrihood/|title=It’s a Beautiful Day in the Agrihood|date=2014-06-23|work=The Plate|access-date=2018-01-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:What Alcohol Does to Your Body.webm|thumb|upright=1.3|Effects of alcohol on the body]]

===Early signs===
The risk of alcohol dependence begins at low levels of drinking and increases directly with both the volume of alcohol consumed and a pattern of [[Binge drinking|drinking larger amounts on an occasion]], to the point of intoxication, which is sometimes called "binge drinking". Young adults are particularly at risk of engaging in binge drinking.{{citation needed|date=March 2018}}

===Long-term misuse===
[[File:Possible long-term effects of ethanol.svg|thumb|upright=1.3|Some of the possible [[long-term effects of ethanol]] an individual may develop. Additionally, in pregnant women, alcohol can cause [[fetal alcohol syndrome]].]]
Alcoholism is characterised by an increased [[Alcohol tolerance|tolerance]] to alcohol–which means that an individual can consume more alcohol–and [[physical dependence]] on alcohol, which makes it hard for an individual to control their consumption. The physical dependency caused by alcohol can lead to an affected individual having a very strong urge to drink alcohol. These characteristics play a role in decreasing an alcoholic's ability to stop drinking.&lt;ref name="Hoffman-1996"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Hoffman |first=PL |last2=Tabakoff |first2=B | title = Alcohol dependence: a commentary on mechanisms | journal = Alcohol and Alcoholism | volume = 31 | issue = 4 | pages = 333–40 | date = July 1996 | pmid = 8879279 | doi = 10.1093/oxfordjournals.alcalc.a008159 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism can have adverse effects on mental health, causing psychiatric disorders and increasing the risk of suicide.

=== Warning signs ===
Warning signs of alcoholism include the consumption of increasing amounts of alcohol and frequent intoxication, preoccupation with drinking to the exclusion of other activities, promises to quit drinking and failure to keep those promises, the inability to remember what was said or done while drinking (colloquially known as "blackouts"), personality changes associated with drinking, denial or the making of excuses for drinking, the refusal to admit excessive drinking, dysfunction or other problems at work or school, the loss of interest in personal appearance or hygiene, marital and economic problems, and the complaint of poor health, with loss of appetite, respiratory infections, or increased anxiety.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Volume Library|publisher=The Southwestern Company|chapter-url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=RE9OwGtvDMACf}}|year=2009|isbn=978-0-87197-208-8|volume=1|location=Nashville, Tennessee |pages=29|chapter=Biology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Physical====

=====Short-term effects=====
{{Main|Short-term effects of alcohol}}

Drinking enough to cause a [[blood alcohol concentration]] (BAC) of 0.03–0.12% typically causes an overall improvement in mood and possible [[euphoria]] (a "happy" feeling), increased self-confidence and sociability, decreased anxiety, a [[Alcohol flush reaction|flushed, red appearance in the face]] and impaired judgment and fine muscle coordination. A BAC of 0.09% to 0.25% causes [[lethargy]], [[sedation]], balance problems and blurred vision. A BAC of 0.18% to 0.30% causes profound confusion, impaired speech (e.g. slurred speech), staggering, dizziness and vomiting. A BAC from 0.25% to 0.40% causes [[stupor]], unconsciousness, [[anterograde amnesia]], vomiting (death may occur due to inhalation of vomit ([[pulmonary aspiration]]) while unconscious) and [[respiratory depression]] (potentially life-threatening). A BAC from 0.35% to 0.80% causes a [[coma]] (unconsciousness), life-threatening respiratory depression and possibly fatal [[alcohol poisoning]]. With all alcoholic beverages, [[drinking and driving|drinking while driving]], operating an aircraft or heavy machinery increases the risk of an accident; many countries have penalties for drunk driving.

Women develop long-term complications of alcohol dependence more rapidly than do men. Additionally, women have a higher mortality rate from alcoholism than men.&lt;ref name="Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870"/&gt; Examples of long-term complications include brain, heart, and liver damage&lt;ref name="Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K., Hertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003 253–268" /&gt; and an [[alcohol and breast cancer|increased risk of breast cancer]]. Additionally, heavy drinking over time has been found to have a negative effect on reproductive functioning in women. This results in reproductive dysfunction such as [[anovulation]], decreased ovarian mass, problems or irregularity of the [[menstrual cycle]], and early [[menopause]].&lt;ref name="Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870" /&gt; Alcoholic [[ketoacidosis]] can occur in individuals who chronically abuse alcohol and have a recent history of [[binge drinking]].&lt;ref name="Mihai-"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Mihai |first1=B |last2=Lăcătuşu |first2=C |last3=Graur |first3=M | title = [Alcoholic ketoacidosis] | journal = Rev Med Chir Soc Med Nat Iasi | volume = 112 | issue = 2 | pages = 321–6 | date = April–June 2008 | pmid = 19294998 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sibaï-2005"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Sibaï |first1=K |last2=Eggimann|first2= P | title = [Alcoholic ketoacidosis: not rare cause of metabolic acidosis] | journal = Rev Med Suisse | volume = 1 | issue = 32 | pages = 2106, 2108–10, 2112–5 | date = September 2005 | pmid = 16238232 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of alcohol that can be biologically processed and its effects differ between sexes.

====Social effects====
{{See also|Drug-related crime}}

Serious social problems arise from alcoholism; these dilemmas are caused by the pathological changes in the brain and the intoxicating effects of alcohol.&lt;ref name="aamaibnc"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Jessica Kingsley Publishers"/&gt; Alcohol abuse is associated with an increased risk of committing criminal offences, including [[child abuse]], [[domestic violence]], [[rape]], [[burglary]] and [[assault]].&lt;ref name="drug_use_a_reference_handbook"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Isralowitz | first1 = Richard | title = Drug use: a reference handbook | url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=X0mxxfbIbp4C}} | year = 2004 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | location = Santa Barbara, Calif. | isbn = 978-1-57607-708-5 | pages = 122–123}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcoholism is associated with [[termination of employment|loss of employment]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Langdana | first1 = Farrokh K. | title = Macroeconomic Policy: Demystifying Monetary and Fiscal Policy | url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=GCYWQn79JYwC}} | date = 27 March 2009 | publisher = Springer | edition = 2nd | isbn = 978-0-387-77665-1 | page = 81 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which can lead to financial problems. Drinking at inappropriate times and behavior caused by reduced judgment can lead to legal consequences, such as criminal charges for [[drunk driving]]&lt;ref name="abd2009"&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Gifford | first1 = Maria | title = Alcoholism (Biographies of Disease) | date = 22 October 2009 | publisher = Greenwood Press | url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=2OJV12astRUC|page=89}} | isbn = 978-0-313-35908-8 | pages = 89–91 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or public disorder, or civil penalties for [[tort]]ious behavior, and may lead to a criminal sentence. An alcoholic's behavior and mental impairment while drunk can profoundly affect those surrounding him and lead to isolation from family and friends. This isolation can lead to [[relational disorder|marital conflict]] and [[divorce]], or contribute to [[domestic violence]]. Alcoholism can also lead to [[child neglect]], with subsequent lasting damage to the emotional development of the alcoholic's children.&lt;ref name="tcemh2006"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Schadé |first1=Johannes Petrus |title=The Complete Encyclopedia of Medicine and Health |date=October 2006 |publisher=Foreign Media Books |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=j8DuEHxSCU4C|page=132}} |isbn=978-1-60136-001-4 |pages=132–133 }}&lt;/ref&gt; For this reason, children of alcoholic parents can develop a number of emotional problems. For example, they can become afraid of their parents, because of their unstable mood behaviors. In addition, they can develop considerable amount of shame over their inadequacy to liberate their parents from alcoholism. As a result of this failure, they develop wretched self-images, which can lead to depression.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Gold |first=Mark |title=Children of Alcoholics |url=http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/children-of-alcoholics/ |publisher=Psych Central |accessdate=27 November 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111116010950/http://psychcentral.com/lib/2006/children-of-alcoholics/ |archivedate=16 November 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As with similar substances with a sedative-hypnotic mechanism, such as [[barbiturates]] and [[benzodiazepines]], withdrawal from alcohol dependence can be fatal if it is not properly managed.&lt;ref name="Jessica Kingsley Publishers"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Galanter |first1=Marc |last2=Kleber |first2=Herbert D. |title=The American Psychiatric Publishing Textbook of Substance Abuse Treatment |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=6wdJgejlQzYC|page=58}} |edition=4th |date=1 July 2008 |publisher=American Psychiatric Publishing Inc |location=United States of America |isbn=978-1-58562-276-4 |page=58 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Alcohol's primary effect is the increase in stimulation of the [[GABAA receptor|GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor]], promoting [[central nervous system]] depression. With repeated heavy consumption of alcohol, these receptors are desensitized and reduced in number, resulting in [[drug tolerance|tolerance]] and [[physical dependence]]. When alcohol consumption is stopped too abruptly, the person's nervous system suffers from uncontrolled [[synapse]] firing. This can result in symptoms that include [[anxiety (mood)|anxiety]], life-threatening [[seizure]]s, [[delirium tremens]], hallucinations, shakes and possible [[heart failure]].&lt;ref name="Medical toxicology"&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Dart |first1=Richard C. |title=Medical Toxicology |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=qDf3AO8nILoC|page=139}} |edition=3rd |date=1 December 2003 |publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins |location=USA |isbn=978-0-7817-2845-4 |pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Idemudia |first1=SO |last2=Bhadra |first2=S |last3=Lal |first3=H | title = The pentylenetetrazol-like interoceptive stimulus produced by ethanol withdrawal is potentiated by bicuculline and picrotoxinin | journal = Neuropsychopharmacology | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 115–22 | date = June 1989 | pmid = 2742726 | doi = 10.1016/0893-133X(89)90014-6 | url = | type = | issn = 0893-133X }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other neurotransmitter systems are also involved, especially [[dopamine]], [[NMDA]] and [[glutamate]].&lt;ref name="Hoffman-1996"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Chastain |first1=G | title = Alcohol, neurotransmitter systems, and behavior | journal = The Journal of General Psychology | volume = 133 | issue = 4 | pages = 329–35 | date = October 2006 | pmid = 17128954 | doi = 10.3200/GENP.133.4.329-335 | issn = 0022-1309 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Severe acute withdrawal symptoms such as [[delirium tremens]] and seizures rarely occur after 1-week post cessation of alcohol. The acute withdrawal phase can be defined as lasting between one and three weeks. In the period of 3–6 weeks following cessation increased anxiety, depression, as well as sleep disturbance, is common;&lt;ref name="pmid20148778"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Heilig |first1=M |last2=Egli |first2=M |last3=Crabbe |first3=JC |last4=Becker |first4=HC | title = Acute withdrawal, protracted abstinence and negative affect in alcoholism: are they linked? | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 15 | issue = 2 | pages = 169–84 | date = April 2010 | pmid = 20148778 | pmc = 3268458 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2009.00194.x }}&lt;/ref&gt; fatigue and tension can persist for up to 5 weeks as part of the [[post-acute withdrawal syndrome]]; about a quarter of alcoholics experience anxiety and depression for up to 2 years.

Individuals who have had multiple withdrawal episodes are more likely to develop seizures and experience more severe anxiety during withdrawal from alcohol than alcohol-dependent individuals without a history of past alcohol withdrawal episodes. The kindling effect leads to persistent functional changes in brain neural circuits as well as to [[gene expression]].&lt;ref name="Breese-2011"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Breese |first1=GR |last2=Sinha |first2=R |last3=Heilig |first3=M | title = Chronic alcohol neuroadaptation and stress contribute to susceptibility for alcohol craving and relapse | journal = Pharmacol Ther | volume = 129 | issue = 2 | pages = 149–71 | date = February 2011 | pmid = 20951730 | pmc = 3026093 | doi = 10.1016/j.pharmthera.2010.09.007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kindling also results in the intensification of psychological symptoms of alcohol withdrawal.&lt;ref name="pmid20148778" /&gt; There are decision tools and questionnaires which help guide physicians in evaluating alcohol withdrawal.

===Gender difference===
Based on combined data from [[Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|SAMHSA]]'s 2004–2005 National Surveys on Drug Use &amp; Health, the rate of past-year alcohol dependence or abuse among persons aged 12 or older varied by level of alcohol use: 44.7% of past month heavy drinkers, 18.5% binge drinkers, 3.8% past month non-binge drinkers, and 1.3% of those who did not drink alcohol in the past month met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year. Males had higher rates than females for all measures of drinking in the past month: any alcohol use (57.5% vs. 45%), binge drinking (30.8% vs. 15.1%), and heavy alcohol use (10.5% vs. 3.3%), and males were twice as likely as females to have met the criteria for alcohol dependence or abuse in the past year (10.5% vs. 5.1%).&lt;ref&gt;"Gender differences in alcohol use and alcohol dependence or abuse: 2004 or 2005."

===Genetic variation===
{{See also|Addiction#Genetic factors}}

[[Human genetic variation|Genetic differences]] that exist between different racial groups affect the risk of developing alcohol dependence. For example, there are differences between African, East Asian and Indo-racial groups in how they metabolize alcohol. These genetic factors partially explain the differing rates of [[alcohol dependence]] among racial groups.&lt;ref name="Moore-2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Moore |first1=S |last2=Montane-Jaime |first2=LK |last3=Carr |first3=LG |last4=Ehlers |first4=CL | title = Variations in alcohol-metabolizing enzymes in people of East Indian and African descent from Trinidad and Tobago | journal = Alcohol Res Health | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 28–30 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17718398 | pmc = 3860431 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Eng-2007"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Eng |first1=MY |last2=Luczak |first2=SE |last3=Wall |first3=TL | title = ALDH2, ADH1B, and ADH1C genotypes in Asians: a literature review | journal = Alcohol Res Health | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 22–7 | year = 2007 | pmid = 17718397 | pmc = 3860439 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] allele ADH1 B*3 causes a more rapid metabolism of alcohol.

A [[genome-wide association study]] of more than 100,000 human individuals identified variants of the gene ''KLB'', which encodes the [[transmembrane protein]] β-[[Klotho (biology)|Klotho]], as highly associated with alcohol consumption.

According to the NIAAA, men may be at risk for alcohol-related problems if their alcohol consumption exceeds 14 [[standard drink]]s per week or 4 drinks per day, and women may be at risk if they have more than 7 standard drinks per week or 3 drinks per day. It defines a standard drink as one 12-ounce bottle of beer, one 5-ounce glass of wine, or 1.5&amp;nbsp;ounces of distilled spirits.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |date=April 2006 |title=Young Adult Drinking |url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa68/aa68.htm |dead-url=no |journal=Alcohol Alert |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130213205702/http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa68/aa68.htm |archive-date=13 February 2013 |access-date=2013-02-18 |df=dmy-all |number=68}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this risk, a 2014 report in the National Survey on Drug Use and Health found that only 10% of either "heavy drinkers" or "binge drinkers" defined according to the above criteria also met the criteria for alcohol dependence, while only 1.3% of non-binge drinkers met the criteria.

====Alcoholism====
The term ''alcoholism'' is commonly used amongst laypeople, but the word is poorly defined. The WHO calls ''alcoholism'' "a term of long-standing use and variable meaning", and use of the term was disfavored by a 1979 WHO expert committee. ''[[The Big Book (Alcoholics Anonymous)|The Big Book]]'' (from [[Alcoholics Anonymous]]) states that once a person is an alcoholic, they are always an alcoholic, but does not define what is meant by the term ''alcoholic'' in this context. In 1960, [[Bill W.]], co-founder of Alcoholics Anonymous (AA), said:
:We have never called alcoholism a [[disease]] because, technically speaking, it is not a disease entity. For example, there is no such thing as [[heart disease]]. Instead there are many separate heart ailments, or combinations of them. It is something like that with alcoholism. We did not wish to get in wrong with the medical profession by pronouncing alcoholism a disease entity. We always called it an [[illness]], or a [[malady]]—a far safer term for us to use.&lt;ref name="McGovernWhite2003"&gt;{{Cite book|first1=Thomas F.|last1= McGovern|first2=William L. |last2=White|title=Alcohol Problems in the United States: Twenty Years of Treatment Perspective|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=3gRwmYohuooC|page=7}}|accessdate=17 April 2010|date=20 May 2003|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-7890-2049-9|pages=7–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In professional and research contexts, the term "alcoholism" sometimes encompasses both alcohol abuse and alcohol dependence,&lt;ref&gt;{{DorlandsDict|one/000002709|alcoholism}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sometimes is considered equivalent to alcohol dependence. Talbot (1989) observes that alcoholism in the classical disease model follows a progressive course: if a person continues to drink, their condition will worsen. This will lead to harmful consequences in their life, physically, mentally, emotionally and socially.&lt;ref name=Thomb1999&gt;{{cite book|last=Thombs|first=Dennis L|title=Introduction To Addictive Behaviors 2ed|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=Aze4azm9XkQCIntroduction}}|year=1999|publisher=The Guildford Press|location=London|pages=64–65}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson (1980) explores the emotional progression of the addict's response to alcohol. He looks at this in four phases. The first two are considered "normal" drinking and the last two are viewed as "typical" alcoholic drinking.&lt;ref name=Thomb1999/&gt; Johnson's four phases consist of:
# Learning the mood swing. A person is introduced to alcohol (in some cultures this can happen at a relatively young age), and the person enjoys the happy feeling it produces.  At this stage, there is no emotional cost.
# Seeking the mood swing. A person will drink to regain that feeling of euphoria experienced in phase 1; the drinking will increase as more intoxication is required to achieve the same effect. Again at this stage, there are no significant consequences.
# At the third stage there are physical and social consequences, i.e., hangovers, family problems, work problems, etc. A person will continue to drink excessively, disregarding the problems.
# The fourth stage can be detrimental, as Johnson cites it as a risk for premature death. As a person now drinks to feel normal, they block out the feelings of overwhelming guilt, remorse, anxiety, and shame they experience when sober.&lt;ref name=Thomb1999/&gt;

====Milam &amp; Ketcham's physical deterioration stages====
Other theorists such as Milam &amp; Ketcham (1983) focus on the physical deterioration that alcohol consumption causes. They describe the process in three stages:
# Adaptive stage – The person will not experience any negative symptoms, and they believe they have the capacity for drinking alcohol without problems. Physiological changes are happening with the increase in tolerance, but this will not be noticeable to the drinker or others.
# Dependent stage – At this stage, symptoms build up gradually. [[Hangover]] symptoms from excessive drinking may be confused with withdrawal symptoms. Many addicts will maintain their drinking to avoid withdrawal sickness, drinking small amounts frequently. They will try to hide their drinking problem from others and will avoid gross intoxication.
# Deterioration stage – Various organs are damaged due to long-term drinking. Medical treatment in a rehabilitation center will be required; otherwise, the pathological changes will cause death.

====DSM and ICD====
In psychology and psychiatry, the DSM is the most common global standard, while in medicine, the standard is ICD. The terms they recommend are similar but not identical.

The [[DSM-IV]] diagnosis of alcohol dependence represents one approach to the definition of alcoholism. In part, this is to assist in the development of research protocols in which findings can be compared to one another. According to the DSM-IV, an alcohol dependence diagnosis is: "maladaptive alcohol use with clinically significant impairment as manifested by at least three of the following within any one-year period: tolerance; withdrawal; taken in greater amounts or over longer time course than intended; desire or unsuccessful attempts to cut down or control use; great deal of time spent obtaining, using, or recovering from use; social, occupational, or recreational activities given up or reduced; continued use despite knowledge of physical or psychological [[sequela]]e."&lt;ref name="DSMIV"&gt;{{Cite book| title = Diagnostic and statistical manual of mental disorders: DSM-IV | url = {{google books |plainurl=y |id=W-BGAAAAMAAJ}} | date = 31 July 1994 | publisher = American Psychiatric Association | location = Washington, DC | isbn = 978-0-89042-025-6 | pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the imprecision inherent in the term, there have been attempts to define how the word ''alcoholism'' should be interpreted when encountered. In 1992, it was defined by the [[National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence]] (NCADD) and [[American Society of Addiction Medicine|ASAM]] as "a primary, chronic disease characterized by impaired control over drinking, preoccupation with the drug alcohol, use of alcohol despite adverse consequences, and distortions in thinking."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Morse |first1=RM |last2=Flavin |first2=DK | title = The definition of alcoholism.

===Social barriers===
Attitudes and social stereotypes can create barriers to the detection and treatment of alcohol abuse. This is more of a barrier for women than men. Fear of stigmatization may lead women to deny that they are suffering from a medical condition, to hide their drinking, and to drink alone. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be less likely to suspect that a woman they know is an alcoholic.&lt;ref name="Blume Laura N., Nielson Nancy H., Riggs Joseph A., et all 1998 861–870" &gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Blum | first1 = Laura N. | last2 = Nielsen | first2 = Nancy H. | last3 = Riggs | first3 = Joseph A. | last4 = Council on Scientific Affairs, American Medical Association | author-link4 = American Medical Association | title = Alcoholism and alcohol abuse among women: report of the council on scientific affairs | journal = [[Journal of Women's Health]] | volume = 7 | issue = 7 | pages = 861–870 | doi = 10.1089/jwh.1998.7.861 | date = September 1998 | ref = harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, reduced fear of stigma may lead men to admit that they are suffering from a medical condition, to display their drinking publicly, and to drink in groups. This pattern, in turn, leads family, physicians, and others to be more likely to suspect that a man they know is an alcoholic.&lt;ref name="Karrol Brad R. 2002 337–356" /&gt;

===Screening===
Several tools may be used to detect a loss of control of alcohol use. These tools are mostly [[self report study|self-reports]] in questionnaire form.

The [[CAGE questionnaire]], named for its four questions, is one such example that may be used to screen patients quickly in a doctor's office.

{{Quotation|Two "yes" responses indicate that the respondent should be investigated further.

The questionnaire asks the following questions:

# Have you ever felt you needed to '''C'''ut down on your drinking?
# Have people '''A'''nnoyed you by criticizing your drinking?
# Have you ever felt '''G'''uilty about drinking?
# Have you ever felt you needed a drink first thing in the morning ('''E'''ye-opener) to steady your nerves or to get rid of a hangover?&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ewing |first=JA |title=Detecting alcoholism.

Other tests are sometimes used for the detection of alcohol dependence, such as the [[Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire]], which is a more sensitive diagnostic test than the [[CAGE questionnaire]]. It helps distinguish a diagnosis of alcohol dependence from one of heavy alcohol use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index3556EN.html |title=Alcohol Dependence Data Questionnaire (SADD) |last1=Raistrick |first1=D. |last2=Dunbar|first2= G. |last3=Davidson |first3=R. |year=1983 |publisher=European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160721101929/http://www.emcdda.europa.eu/html.cfm/index3556EN.html |archivedate=21 July 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Michigan Alcohol Screening Test]] (MAST) is a screening tool for alcoholism widely used by courts to determine the appropriate sentencing for people convicted of alcohol-related offenses,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ncadd-sfv.org/symptoms/mast_test.html |title=Michigan Alcohol Screening Test |publisher=The National Council on Alcoholism and Drug Dependence |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060906123532/http://www.ncadd-sfv.org/symptoms/mast_test.html |archivedate=6 September 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[driving under the influence]] being the most common. The [[Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test]] (AUDIT), a screening questionnaire developed by the [[World Health Organization]], is unique in that it has been validated in six countries and is used internationally. Like the CAGE questionnaire, it uses a simple set of questions – a high score earning a deeper investigation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_MSD_MSB_01.6a.pdf |title=The Alcohol Use Disorders Identification Test; Guidelines for Use in Primary Care |first1=Thomas F. |last1=Babor |first2=John C. |last2=Higgins-Biddle |first3=John B. |last3=Saunders |first4=Maristela G. |last4=Monteiro |year=2001 |publisher=World Health Organization |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060502132711/http://whqlibdoc.who.int/hq/2001/WHO_MSD_MSB_01.6a.pdf |archivedate=2 May 2006 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Paddington Alcohol Test]] (PAT) was designed to screen for alcohol-related problems amongst those attending [[Accident and Emergency department]]s.

===Urine and blood tests===
There are reliable tests for the actual use of alcohol, one common test being that of [[blood alcohol content]] (BAC).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last= Jones |first=AW | title = Urine as a biological specimen for forensic analysis of alcohol and variability in the urine-to-blood relationship | journal = Toxicol Rev | volume = 25 | issue = 1 | pages = 15–35 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16856767 | doi = 10.2165/00139709-200625010-00002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These tests do not differentiate alcoholics from non-alcoholics; however, long-term heavy drinking does have a few recognizable effects on the body, including:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Das |first1=SK |last2= Dhanya |first2=L |last3=Vasudevan |first3=DM | title = Biomarkers of alcoholism: an updated review | journal = Scand J Clin Lab Invest | volume = 68 | issue = 2 | pages = 81–92 | year = 2008 | pmid = 17852805 | doi = 10.1080/00365510701532662 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Macrocytosis]] (enlarged [[Mean corpuscular volume|MCV]])
* Elevated [[Gamma glutamyl transpeptidase|GGT]]
* Moderate elevation of [[Aspartate transaminase|AST]] and [[Alanine transaminase|ALT]] and an AST: ALT ratio of 2:1
* High [[carbohydrate deficient transferrin]] (CDT)

With regard to alcoholism, BAC is useful to judge [[alcohol tolerance]], which in turn is a sign of alcoholism.&lt;ref name=DSM5/&gt; Electrolyte and acid-base abnormalities including [[hypokalemia]], [[hypomagnesemia]], [[hyponatremia]], [[hyperuricemia]], [[metabolic acidosis]], and [[respiratory alkalosis]] are common in alcoholics.&lt;ref name="NIHHx" /&gt;

However, none of these blood tests for biological markers is as sensitive as screening questionnaires.

==Prevention==
{{further|Alcohol education}}
The [[World Health Organization]], the [[European Union]] and other regional bodies, national governments and parliaments have formed alcohol policies in order to reduce the harm of alcoholism.&lt;ref name="alchwho2010"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.who.int/topics/alcohol_drinking/en/ |title=Alcohol |author=World Health Organization |year=2010 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100226094205/http://www.who.int/topics/alcohol_drinking/en/ |archivedate=26 February 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="apitwhoer"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.euro.who.int/document/mediacentre/fs1005e.pdf |title=Alcohol policy in the WHO European Region: current status and the way forward |date=12 September 2005 |publisher=World Health Organization |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100123105252/http://www.euro.who.int/document/mediacentre/fs1005e.pdf |archivedate=23 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Targeting adolescents and young adults is regarded as an important step to reduce the harm of alcohol abuse. Increasing the age at which licit drugs of abuse such as alcohol can be purchased, the banning or restricting advertising of alcohol has been recommended as additional ways of reducing the harm of alcohol dependence and abuse. Credible, [[evidence based]] educational campaigns in the mass media about the consequences of alcohol abuse have been recommended. Guidelines for parents to prevent alcohol abuse amongst adolescents, and for helping young people with mental health problems have also been suggested.&lt;ref name="acdacpovfa"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Crews |first1=F |last2=He |first2=J |last3=Hodge |first3=C | title = Adolescent cortical development: a critical period of vulnerability for addiction | journal = Pharmacol Biochem Behav | volume = 86 | issue = 2 | pages = 189–99 | date = February 2007 | pmid = 17222895 | doi = 10.1016/j.pbb.2006.12.001 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==
Treatments are varied because there are multiple perspectives of alcoholism. Those who approach alcoholism as a medical condition or disease recommend differing treatments from, for instance, those who approach the condition as one of social choice. Most treatments focus on helping people discontinue their alcohol intake, followed up with life training and/or social support to help them resist a return to alcohol use. Since alcoholism involves multiple factors which encourage a person to continue drinking, they must all be addressed to successfully prevent a relapse. An example of this kind of treatment is detoxification followed by a combination of supportive therapy, attendance at self-help groups, and ongoing development of coping mechanisms. The treatment community for alcoholism typically supports an abstinence-based [[zero tolerance]] approach; however, some prefer a [[Harm reduction|harm-reduction]] approach.&lt;ref name="Gabbard"/&gt;

===Detoxification===
{{Main|Alcohol detoxification}}
[[Alcohol detoxification]] or 'detox' for alcoholics is an abrupt stop of alcohol drinking coupled with the substitution of drugs, such as [[benzodiazepines]], that have similar effects to prevent [[Alcohol withdrawal syndrome|alcohol withdrawal]]. Individuals who are only at risk of mild to moderate withdrawal symptoms can be detoxified as outpatients. Individuals at risk of a severe withdrawal syndrome as well as those who have significant or acute comorbid conditions are generally treated as inpatients. Detoxification does not actually treat alcoholism, and it is necessary to follow up detoxification with an appropriate treatment program for alcohol dependence or abuse to reduce the risk of relapse.&lt;ref name="Blondell-2005"/&gt; Some symptoms of alcohol withdrawal such as depressed mood and anxiety typically take weeks or months to abate while other symptoms persist longer due to persisting neuroadaptations.&lt;ref name="pmid20148778" /&gt; Alcoholism has serious adverse effects on brain function; on average it takes one year of abstinence to recover from the cognitive deficits incurred by chronic alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name="Stavro-2012"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Stavro |first1=K |last2=Pelletier |first2=J |last3=Potvin |first3=S | title = Widespread and sustained cognitive deficits in alcoholism: a meta-analysis | journal = Addict Biol | volume = 18 | issue = 2 | pages = 203–13 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 22264351 | doi = 10.1111/j.1369-1600.2011.00418.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Psychological===
[[File:Alcoholics Anonymous Regional Service Center by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|A regional service center for [[Alcoholics Anonymous]].]]

Various forms of [[group therapy]] or [[psychotherapy]] can be used to deal with underlying psychological issues that are related to alcohol addiction, as well as provide relapse prevention skills. The mutual-help group-counseling approach is one of the most common ways of helping alcoholics maintain sobriety.&lt;ref name="Morgan-Lopez-2006"/&gt; [[Alcoholics Anonymous]] was one of the first organizations formed to provide mutual, nonprofessional counseling, and it is still the largest. Others include [[LifeRing Secular Recovery]], [[SMART Recovery]], [[Women For Sobriety]], and [[Secular Organizations for Sobriety]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.helpguide.org/articles/addiction/self-help-groups-for-alcohol-addiction.htm|title=Self-Help Groups for Alcohol Addiction|last=Smith, M.A.|first=Melinda|last2=Saisan, M.S.W.|first2=Joanna|date=2016|website=|publisher=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150521163926/http://www.helpguide.org/articles/addiction/self-help-groups-for-alcohol-addiction.htm|archivedate=21 May 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rationing and moderation programs such as [[Moderation Management]] and DrinkWise do not mandate complete abstinence. While most alcoholics are unable to limit their drinking in this way, some return to moderate drinking. A 2002 US study by the [[National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism]] (NIAAA) showed that 17.7 percent of individuals diagnosed as alcohol dependent more than one year prior returned to low-risk drinking. This group, however, showed fewer initial symptoms of dependency.&lt;ref name="DAWSON2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Dawson |first1=DA |last2=Grant|first2= BF |last3=Stinson |first3=FS |last4=Chou |first4=PS |last5=Huang |first5=B |last6=Ruan |first6=WJ | title = Recovery from DSM-IV alcohol dependence: United States, 2001–2002 | journal = Addiction | volume = 100 | issue = 3 | pages = 281–92 | year = 2005 | pmid = 15733237 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.2004.00964.x | url = http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh29-2/131-142.htm | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110719104620/http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/arh29-2/131-142.htm | archivedate = 19 July 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A follow-up study, using the same subjects that were judged to be in remission in 2001–2002, examined the rates of return to problem drinking in 2004–2005.

===Medications===
In the United States there are four approved medications for alcoholism: [[acamprosate]], two methods of using [[naltrexone]] and [[disulfiram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Alcohol and Other Drugs|url=http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/AA76/AA76.htm |dead-url=no |publisher=National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130728134244/http://pubs.niaaa.nih.gov/publications/aa76/aa76.htm |archive-date=28 July 2013 |access-date=2013-07-11 |df=dmy-all|number=76|date=July 2008|journal=Alcohol Alert}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* [[Naltrexone]] is a [[competitive antagonist]] for opioid receptors, effectively blocking the effects of [[endorphin]]s and [[opioid]]s. Naltrexone is used to decrease cravings for alcohol and encourage abstinence. Alcohol causes the body to release endorphins, which in turn release dopamine and activate the reward pathways; hence in the body reduces the pleasurable effects from consuming alcohol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Soyka |first1=M |last2=Rösner |first2=S | title = Opioid antagonists for pharmacological treatment of alcohol dependence – a critical review | journal = Curr Drug Abuse Rev | volume = 1 | issue = 3 | pages = 280–91 | date = November 2008 | pmid = 19630726 | doi = 10.2174/1874473710801030280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Evidence supports a reduced risk of relapse among alcohol-dependent persons and a decrease in excessive drinking.&lt;ref name=JAMA2014/&gt; [[Nalmefene]] also appears effective and works in a similar manner.&lt;ref name=JAMA2014/&gt;

* [[Disulfiram]] prevents the elimination of [[acetaldehyde]], a chemical the body produces when breaking down ethanol. Acetaldehyde itself is the cause of many [[hangover]] symptoms from alcohol use. The overall effect is discomfort when alcohol is ingested: an extremely fast-acting and long-lasting uncomfortable hangover.

Several other drugs are also used and many are under investigation.
* [[Benzodiazepines]], while useful in the management of acute alcohol withdrawal, if used long-term can cause a worse outcome in alcoholism. Alcoholics on chronic benzodiazepines have a lower rate of achieving abstinence from alcohol than those not taking benzodiazepines. This class of drugs is commonly prescribed to alcoholics for insomnia or anxiety management.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-first=S.J.E. |editor1-last=Lindsay |editor2-first=Graham E. |editor2-last=Powell |title=The Handbook of Clinical Adult Psychology |url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=a6A9AAAAIAAJ|page=380}} |edition=2nd |date=28 July 1998 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-0-415-07215-1 |page=402 |chapter= |chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiating prescriptions of benzodiazepines or sedative-hypnotics in individuals in recovery has a high rate of relapse with one author reporting more than a quarter of people relapsed after being prescribed sedative-hypnotics.

===Dual addictions and dependences===
Alcoholics may also require treatment for other psychotropic [[drug addiction]]s and [[drug dependence]]s. The most common dual dependence syndrome with alcohol dependence is [[benzodiazepine dependence]], with studies showing 10–20 percent of alcohol-dependent individuals had problems of dependence and/or misuse problems of benzodiazepine drugs such as [[valium]] or [[clonazopam]]. These drugs are, like alcohol, [[depressant]]s. Benzodiazepines may be used legally, if they are prescribed by doctors for anxiety problems or other mood disorders, or they may be purchased as [[illegal drugs]].  Benzodiazepine use increases cravings for alcohol and the volume of alcohol consumed by problem drinkers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poulos |first1=CX |last2=Zack |first2=M | title = Low-dose diazepam primes motivation for alcohol and alcohol-related semantic networks in problem drinkers | journal = Behav Pharmacol | volume = 15 | issue = 7 | pages = 503–12 | date = November 2004 | pmid = 15472572 | doi = 10.1097/00008877-200411000-00006 | url = | issn = 0955-8810 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Benzodiazepine dependency requires careful reduction in dosage to avoid [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] and other health consequences. Dependence on other sedative-hypnotics such as [[zolpidem]] and [[zopiclone]] as well as [[opiate]]s and illegal drugs is common in alcoholics. Alcohol itself is a sedative-hypnotic and is cross-tolerant with other sedative-hypnotics such as [[barbiturate]]s, benzodiazepines and [[nonbenzodiazepine]]s. Dependence upon and withdrawal from sedative-hypnotics can be medically severe and, as with alcohol withdrawal, there is a risk of [[psychosis]] or [[seizure]]s if not properly managed.&lt;ref name="dolpdaa"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Johansson |first1=BA |last2=Berglund |first2=M |last3=Hanson |first3=M |last4=Pöhlén |first4=C |last5=Persson |first5=I | title = Dependence on legal psychotropic drugs among alcoholics | journal = Alcohol and Alcoholism. | volume = 38 | issue = 6 | pages = 613–8 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14633651 | doi = 10.1093/alcalc/agg123 | url = http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/6/613 | format = PDF | issn = 0735-0414 | deadurl = no | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090220090248/http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/38/6/613 | archivedate = 20 February 2009 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within the medical and scientific communities, there is a broad consensus regarding alcoholism as a disease state. For example, the American Medical Association considers alcohol a drug and states that "drug addiction is a chronic, relapsing brain disease characterized by compulsive drug seeking and use despite often devastating consequences. It results from a complex interplay of biological vulnerability, environmental exposure, and developmental factors (e.g., stage of brain maturity)."&lt;ref name="autogenerated1" /&gt; Alcoholism has a higher prevalence among men, though, in recent decades, the proportion of female alcoholics has increased.&lt;ref name="Walter H., Gutierrez K., Ramskogler K., Hertling I., Dvorak A., Lesch O.M., et al. 2003 253–268"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Walter |first1=H|last2= Gutierrez |first2=K |last3=Ramskogler |first3=K|last4= Hertling |first4=I |last5=Dvorak |first5=A |last6=Lesch |first6=OM | title = Gender-specific differences in alcoholism: implications for treatment | journal = Archives of Women's Mental Health | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 253–8 | date = November 2003 | pmid = 14628177 | doi = 10.1007/s00737-003-0014-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Current evidence indicates that in both men and women, alcoholism is 50–60 percent genetically determined, leaving 40–50 percent for environmental influences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dick |first1=DM |last2=Bierut |first2=LJ | title = The genetics of alcohol dependence | journal = Current Psychiatry Reports | volume = 8 | issue = 2 | pages = 151–7 | date = April 2006 | pmid = 16539893 | doi = 10.1007/s11920-006-0015-1 | url = | issn = 1523-3812 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most alcoholics develop alcoholism during adolescence or young adulthood.&lt;ref name="Enoch-2006"/&gt; 31 percent of college students show signs of alcohol abuse, while six percent are dependent on alcohol.

Alcohol has a long history of use and misuse throughout recorded history. Biblical, Egyptian and Babylonian sources record the history of abuse and dependence on alcohol. In some ancient cultures alcohol was worshiped and in others, its abuse was condemned. Excessive alcohol misuse and drunkenness were recognized as causing social problems even thousands of years ago. However, the defining of habitual drunkenness as it was then known as and its adverse consequences were not well established medically until the 18th century. In 1647 a Greek monk named Agapios was the first to document that chronic alcohol misuse was associated with toxicity to the nervous system and body which resulted in a range of medical disorders such as seizures, paralysis, and internal bleeding. In 1920 the effects of alcohol abuse and chronic drunkenness boosted membership of the [[temperance movement]] and led to the [[Prohibition in the United States|prohibition of alcohol in the United States]], a nationwide constitutional ban on the production, importation, transportation, and sale of alcoholic beverages that remained in place until 1933; this policy resulted in the decline of death rates from cirrhosis and alcoholism.&lt;ref name="Blocker2006"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Blocker |first1=Jack S. |title=Did Prohibition Really Work?

Referendum results in the immediate post-Volstead period showed widespread support, and the Supreme Court quickly fended off challenges to the new law.

==Society and culture==

The various health problems associated with long-term alcohol consumption are generally perceived as detrimental to society, for example, money due to lost labor-hours, medical costs due to injuries due to drunkenness and organ damage from long-term use, and secondary treatment costs, such as the costs of rehabilitation facilities and detoxification centers. Alcohol use is a major contributing factor for [[head injury|head injuries]], [[motor vehicle accident]]s (due to [[drunk driving]]), [[domestic violence]], and assaults. Beyond the financial costs that alcohol consumption imposes, there are also significant social costs to both the alcoholic and their family and friends.&lt;ref name="Jessica Kingsley Publishers"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=McCully |first1=Chris |title=Goodbye Mr. Wonderful.

Evidence suggests that topiramate antagonizes excitatory glutamate receptors, inhibits dopamine release, and enhances inhibitory gamma-aminobutyric acid function. A 2008 review of the effectiveness of topiramate concluded that the results of published trials are promising, however, as of 2008, data was insufficient to support using topiramate in conjunction with brief weekly compliance counseling as a first-line agent for alcohol dependence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Olmsted |first1=CL |last2=Kockler |first2=DR | title = Topiramate for alcohol dependence | journal = Ann Pharmacother | volume = 42 | issue = 10 | pages = 1475–80 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 18698008 | doi = 10.1345/aph.1L157 | issn = 1060-0280 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2010 review found that topiramate may be superior to existing alcohol pharmacotherapeutic options. Topiramate effectively reduces craving and alcohol withdrawal severity as well as improving quality-of-life-ratings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kenna |first1=GA |last2=Lomastro |first2=TL |last3=Schiesl |first3=A |last4=Leggio |first4=L |last5=Swift |first5=RM | title = Review of topiramate: an antiepileptic for the treatment of alcohol dependence | journal = Curr Drug Abuse Rev | volume = 2 | issue = 2 | pages = 135–42 | date = May 2009 | pmid = 19630744 | doi = 10.2174/1874473710902020135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baclofen===
[[Baclofen]], a [[GABAB receptor]] agonist, is under study for the treatment of alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Leggio |first1=L |last2=Garbutt |first2=JC |last3=Addolorato |first3=G | title = Effectiveness and safety of baclofen in the treatment of alcohol dependent patients | journal = CNS &amp; Neurological Disorders Drug Targets | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 33–44 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20201813 | doi = 10.2174/187152710790966614 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2017 systematic review concluded that there is insufficient evidence to draw any conclusions about the safety and efficacy because the evidence is of low quality and insufficient.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Liu|first=Jia|last2=Wang|first2=Lu-Ning|date=20 August 2017|title=Baclofen for alcohol withdrawal|journal=The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=8|pages=CD008502|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD008502.pub5|issn=1469-493X|pmid=28822350}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ondansetron===
[[Ondansetron]], a 5HT3 antagonist, appears to have promise as a treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1= Kenna |first1=GA | title = Medications acting on the serotonergic system for the treatment of alcohol dependent patients | journal = Current Pharmaceutical Design | volume = 16 | issue = 19 | pages = 2126–35 | year = 2010 | pmid = 20482508 | doi = 10.2174/138161210791516396 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===LSD===

According to a retrospective analysis of six studies from the 1960s and 1970s [[Psychedelic therapy|LSD-assisted psychotherapy]] has potential as a treatment for alcoholism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Frood|first=Arran|date=2012-03-09|title=LSD helps to treat alcoholism|url=https://www.nature.com/news/lsd-helps-to-treat-alcoholism-1.10200|journal=Nature|language=en|doi=10.1038/nature.2012.10200|issn=1744-7933}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the linguist|the Buddhist scholar|Alfred Bloom (Buddhist)}}

'''Alfred H. Bloom''' is an [[United States|American]] [[psychology|psychologist]] and [[linguistics|linguist]] and vice chancellor of [[New York University Abu Dhabi]]. 

== Life ==
{{Advert section|date=November 2018}}
{{Unreferenced section|date=November 2018}}
Bloom joined NYU Abu Dhabi from [[Swarthmore College]], where he completed an 18-year tenure as president in 2009. Under Bloom, Swarthmore assumed a position of broadly recognized leadership in American liberal arts education. During Bloom’s tenure, the College revitalized its academically rigorous Honors Program, undertook extensive renovation and creation of academic buildings, broadened its multicultural curriculum, expanded foreign study, and established the Eugene M. Lang Center for Civic and Social Responsibility.

During the Bloom presidency, the College dramatically increased its diversity, with the proportion of students of color in the entering class rising from 16 percent to 39 percent.  The College also achieved a significant increase in admissions applications and selectivity, most recently with more than 6,200 applications of extraordinary quality for approximately 375 places in the Class of 2012.  Swarthmore's endowment grew from $400 million in 1991 to $1.4 billion in 2009. In addition, the College raised more than $362 million in gifts during that period. The College also expanded its commitment to financial aid, eliminating loans from students' financial aid packages, and ensuring that aid covered all foreign study.  In 2000, Bloom and Swarthmore's Board of Managers, in a controversial decision, eliminated the College's football program.

Prior to assuming the presidency at Swarthmore, Bloom served as executive vice president of [[Pitzer College]] in [[Claremont, California]].  Previously, he was vice president of academic affairs and dean of faculty at Pitzer. He was appointed as an assistant professor of psychology and linguistics at Swarthmore in 1974, and named associate provost in 1985.

In 1967, Bloom received his [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]], ''[[summa cum laude]]'' in [[Romance languages]] and [[Europe]]an [[civilization]] from [[Princeton University]]. That year, he studied in [[France]] as a Fulbright-Hays fellow. In 1974, he received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in psychology and [[social relations]] from [[Harvard University]]. The concept of "ethical intelligence,” which has gained currency within and outside of higher education, was introduced by Bloom who first expressed it in his inaugural address as president of Swarthmore in 1991 and has since amplified its meaning in numerous writings and speeches.

Bloom's research brings together psychology and linguistics, particularly with respect to how they help us to understand cross-cultural continuities and differences in thought and moral understanding and the reciprocal impact of language on thought and thought on language. He is the author of "The Linguistic Shaping of Thought: A Study of the Impact of Language on Thinking in China and the West" (Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 1981) and Moral Behavior in Chinese Society (Praeger Publishers, 1981) as well as numerous articles including "The Privileging of Experience in Chinese Practical Reasoning," Journal of Chinese Philosophy; "Psychological Ingredients of High-Level Moral Thinking: A Critique of the Kohlberg-Gilligan Paradigm," Journal for the Theory of Social Behavior; and "Caution - The words you use may affect what you say," Cognition.

Bloom is the recipient of honorary doctorates from the [[University of Richmond]] and Swarthmore College.

== Research ==
Bloom's research has focused on the comparative study of languages, especially between [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] and [[English language|English]]. Bloom has argued for a weak version of the so-called [[linguistic relativity hypothesis]], which postulates an influence of language on the way  speakers conceptualize and arrange the [[reality]]; he has tried to show this through his most widely known experiment. He selected two different groups of subjects, one composed of native English speakers and the other composed of Chinese speakers; the subjects were shown a text written in their own respective languages, and their task was to read that text and, afterwards, give an answer to the question whether or not what it told had actually happened. The text, which had been initially written in English and later on translated into Chinese in a literal way, reported a set of counterfactual events that were told by using the [[subjunctive]], a verb tense that is nowhere found in the [[Sinitic languages]]. In the end, Chinese speakers gave a much higher percentage of wrong answers than the English group. Therefore, Bloom's conclusion was the impossibility to translate literally between languages: Chinese and English express different thoughts, even when they are telling the same story.

This experiment has been disputed by several authors. Au, for example, conducted an extended version of the same experiment: he used different versions of the Chinese text. In those cases in which the translation was not too literal, the text became more intelligible to its readers, and therefore they were able to understand what it reported. [[Pinker]], following Au, has also criticized Bloom's results.

'''Carina Isabel Vance Mafla''' (born 1977) is a former Minister for Public Health of [[Ecuador]]. Vance was born in [[Oakland, California]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://andes.info.ec/perfiles/0000-carolina-vance-activista-politica-musica-y-apasionada-133833.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709184433/http://andes.info.ec/perfiles/0000-carolina-vance-activista-politica-musica-y-apasionada-133833.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=9 July 2012 |agency=ANDES |date=21 January 2012 |title=Carina Vance es activista política, música y apasionada por el respeto |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She went to high school in Ecuador and attended university in the United States.

Vance is openly [[lesbian]].&lt;ref name="Pink"/&gt; She spent time in Europe as a girl, where, at the age of thirteen, she and her first girlfriend were attacked by [[Homophobia|homophobic]] youths. Vance had already begun to understand and accept her identity as a lesbian, but said that this incident "was not only a discovery of my homosexuality, but also society's reaction to it."&lt;ref name="Cosas"&gt;{{Cite news |work=Cosas |title=Ricky Martin: Soy gay ¿Y qué? |url=http://www.cosas.com.ec/614-Ricky_Martin.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120121023852/http://www.cosas.com.ec/614-Ricky_Martin.html |archivedate=2012-01-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She subsequently worked as a lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender (LGBT) rights activist and was the executive director of Fundacion Causana, a lesbian rights organization.&lt;ref name="Pink"&gt;{{Cite news |work=Pink News |date=24 January 2012 |url=http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2012/01/24/ecuadors-new-lesbian-health-minister-to-close-cure-clinics/ |title=Ecuador’s new lesbian health minister to close ‘gay cure clinics’ |first=Joseph |last=McCormick}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vance was appointed to the Cabinet by President [[Rafael Correa]] in January 2012, after her predecessor David Chiriboga resigned amid concerns that he was unable to fix the problems in Ecuador's national healthcare system.&lt;ref name="Advocate"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2012/01/23/Ecuador_Lesbian_Activist_Appointed_to_Presidential_Cabinet/ |work=The Advocate |date=24 January 2012 |title=Ecuador: Lesbian Activist Appointed to Presidential Cabinet |first=Michelle |last=Garcia |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716215340/http://www.advocate.com/News/Daily_News/2012/01/23/Ecuador_Lesbian_Activist_Appointed_to_Presidential_Cabinet/ |archivedate=2012-07-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vance announced her intent to shut down a system of religious "clinics" which said they could [[Ex-gay movement|"cure" gays and particularly lesbians of their homosexuality]] and which had been reported to torture inmates physically and psychologically and to hold them against their will.&lt;ref name="Blade"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pink"/&gt; Fundacion Causana had been working to close these sorts of institutions for ten years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.radiosucre.com.ec/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=21700:ecuador-clinicas-ecuatorianas-de-tortura-homosexual-son-allanadas-y-cerradas&amp;catid=3:sucesos&amp;Itemid=77 |publisher=Radio Sucre |title=Ecuador: Clínicas ecuatorianas de tortura homosexual son allanadas y cerradas |date=January 25, 2012 |first=Cristhian |last=Reyes Hidalgo}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a network of almost 200 such illegal "clinics" was discovered four years earlier, Vance's organization and other LGBT rights and progressive organizations pressured Correa's government to shut them down. This led to the closure of thirty such clinics in September 2011&lt;ref name="Advocate"/&gt; and a plan, presented by Chiriboga before his resignation, to continue the work.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt; Soon after Vance was appointed to the Cabinet, the ministry raided three of the "torture clinics" near [[Quito]] and rescued dozens of women.&lt;ref name="MSNBC"&gt;{{Cite news |publisher=MSNBC |date=25 January 2012 |url=http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/01/25/10237126-rights-groups-hail-ecuadors-crackdown-on-lesbian-torture-clinics |title=Rights groups hail Ecuador's crackdown on lesbian 'torture clinics' |access-date=2012-01-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120610071713/http://worldnews.msnbc.msn.com/_news/2012/01/25/10237126-rights-groups-hail-ecuadors-crackdown-on-lesbian-torture-clinics# |archive-date=2012-06-10 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; She also discussed plans to reform the administration of the country's hospitals.&lt;ref name="Comercio"/&gt;

In [[psychiatry]], '''confabulation''' (verb: '''confabulate''') is a [[memory error]] defined as the production of fabricated, distorted, or misinterpreted memories about oneself or the world, without the conscious intention to deceive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Fotopoulou A. |author2=Conway M. A. |author3=Solms M. | year = 2007 | title = Confabulation: Motivated reality monitoring | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 45 | issue = 10| pages = 2180–90 | doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2007.03.003|pmid=17428509 }}&lt;/ref&gt; People who confabulate present incorrect memories ranging from "subtle alterations to bizarre fabrications",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorylossonline.com/pastissues/summer2000/confabulation.html|title=Truth about Confabulation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are generally very confident about their recollections, despite contradictory evidence.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{cite book|last=Nalbantian|first=edited by Suzanne|title=The memory process : neuroscientific and humanistic perspectives|year=2010|publisher=MIT Press|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-01457-1 |author2=Matthews, Paul M. |author3=McClelland, James L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

Confabulation is distinguished from [[Lie|lying]] as there is no intent to deceive and the person is unaware the information is false.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch"&gt;Moscovitch M. 1995. "Confabulation". In (Eds. Schacter D.L., Coyle J.T., Fischbach G.D., Mesulum M.M. &amp; Sullivan L.G.), ''Memory Distortion''. pp. 226–51. Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Although individuals can present blatantly false information, confabulation can also seem to be coherent, internally consistent, and relatively normal.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch" /&gt;

Most known cases of confabulation are symptomatic of brain damage or dementias, such as [[aneurysm]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], or [[Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome]] (a common manifestation of [[thiamine]] deficiency caused by [[alcoholism]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |pmid=23887463 | volume=113 | issue=6 Pt 2 | title=[Wernicke encephalopathy and Korsakoff's psychosis: clinical-pathophysiological correlation, diagnostics and treatment] | year=2013 | journal=Zh Nevrol Psikhiatr Im S S Korsakova | pages=20–26 | author = Sivolap IuP Damulin IV}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally confabulation often occurs in people who are suffering from anticholinergic [[toxidrome]] when interrogated about bizarre or irrational behaviour.

Confabulated memories of all types most often occur in [[autobiographical memory]] and are indicative of a complicated and intricate process that can be led astray at any point during [[Encoding (memory)|encoding]], [[Storage (memory)|storage]], or [[Recall (memory)|recall]] of a memory.&lt;ref name=book/&gt; This type of confabulation is commonly seen in [[Korsakoff's syndrome]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Korsakoff Syndrome: Clinical Aspects, Psychology and Treatment|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism |volume=44|issue=2|pages=148–54|doi=10.1093/alcalc/agn118|url=http://alcalc.oxfordjournals.org/content/44/2/148.full|pmid=19151162 |year=2009|author1=Kopelman |first1=M. D. |last2=Thomson |first2=A. D. |last3=Guerrini |first3=I |last4=Marshall |first4=E. J. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Distinctions ===
Two types of confabulation are often distinguished:
* '''Provoked''' (momentary, or secondary) confabulations represent a normal response to a faulty memory, are common in both amnesia and dementia,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; and can become apparent during memory tests.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt;
* '''Spontaneous''' (or primary) confabulations do not occur in response to a cue&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt; and seem to be involuntary.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gilboa|first=A.|title=Mechanisms of spontaneous confabulations: a strategic retrieval account|journal=Brain|date=13 April 2006|volume=129|issue=6|pages=1399–1414|doi=10.1093/brain/awl093|pmid=16638795}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are relatively rare, more common in cases of dementia, and may result from the interaction between frontal lobe pathology and organic amnesia.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=3694207|pmc=1032561|year=1987|author1=Kopelman|first1=M. D.|title=Two types of confabulation|journal=Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery, and Psychiatry|volume=50|issue=11|pages=1482–87|doi=10.1136/jnnp.50.11.1482}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another distinction is that between:&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt;
* '''Verbal''' confabulations, spoken false memories are more common, and 
* '''Behavioral''' confabulations, occur when an individual acts on their false memories.

== Signs and symptoms ==
Confabulation is associated with several characteristics:
# Typically verbal statements but can also be non-verbal gestures or actions.
# Can include autobiographical and non-personal information, such as historical facts, fairy-tales, or other aspects of semantic memory.
# The account can be fantastic or coherent.
# Both the premise and the details of the account can be false.
# The account is usually drawn from the patient's memory of actual experiences, including past and current thoughts.
# The patient is unaware of the accounts' distortions or inappropriateness, and is not concerned when errors are pointed out.
# There is no hidden motivation behind the account.
# The patient's personality structure may play a role in his/her readiness to confabulate.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch" /&gt;

==Theories==
Theories of confabulation range in emphasis.&lt;ref&gt;Berrios G.E. (1998) Confabulation: a conceptual history. ''Journal of the History of the Neurosciences'' 7: 225-241. &lt;/ref&gt; Some theories propose that confabulations represent a way for memory-disabled people to maintain their self-identity.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Metcalf|first=Kasey |author2=Langdon, Robyn |author3=Coltheart, Max|title=Models of confabulation: A critical review and a new framework|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=1 February 2007|volume=24|issue=1|pages=23–47|doi=10.1080/02643290600694901|pmid=18416482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other theories use neurocognitive links to explain the process of confabulation.&lt;ref name="Spontaneous and Fantastic Review"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Glowinski|first=Remy |author2=Payman, Vahid |author3=Frencham, Kate|title=Confabulation: a spontaneous and fantastic review|journal=Australian and New Zealand Journal of Psychiatry|date=2008|volume=42|issue=11|pages=932–40|doi=10.1080/00048670802415335|pmid=18941957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still other theories frame confabulation around the more familiar concept of delusion.&lt;ref name="varieties of confabulation and delusion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopelman|first=Michael D.|title=Varieties of confabulation and delusion|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=2010|volume=15|issue=1–3|pages=14–37|doi=10.1080/13546800902732830}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other researchers frame confabulation within the [[fuzzy-trace theory]].&lt;ref name="fuzzy trace theory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brainerd|first=C.J.|author2=Reyna, V.F.|title=Fuzzy-Trace Theory and Children's False Memories|journal=Journal of Experimental Child Psychology|date=1 November 1998|volume=71|issue=2|pages=81–129|doi=10.1006/jecp.1998.2464|pmid=9843617}}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, some researchers call for theories that rely less on neurocognitive explanations and more on [[epistemic]] accounts.&lt;ref name="faultless ignorance"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bortolotti|first=Lisa|author2=Cox, Rochelle E.|title='Faultless' ignorance: Strengths and limitations of epistemic definitions of confabulation|journal=Consciousness and Cognition|date=1 December 2009|volume=18|issue=4|pages=952–65|doi=10.1016/j.concog.2009.08.011|pmid=19773185}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Neuropsychological theories===
The most popular theories of confabulation come from the field of neuropsychology or cognitive neuroscience.&lt;ref name="Spontaneous and Fantastic Review"/&gt; Research suggests that confabulation is associated with dysfunction of cognitive processes that control the retrieval from long-term memory. Frontal lobe damage often disrupts this process, preventing the retrieval of information and the evaluation of its output.&lt;ref name=Baddeley1986&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1017/CBO9780511558313.020|chapter=Amnesia, autobiographical memory, and confabulation|title=Autobiographical Memory|pages=225–52|year=1986|last1=Baddeley|first1=Alan|last2=Wilson|first2=Barbara|isbn=9780511558313|editor-last1= Rubin |editor-first1=David C.|location=Cambridge|publisher=Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Moscovitch M. |author2=Melo B. | year = 1997 | title = Strategic retrieval and the frontal lobes: evidence from confabulation and amnesia | url = | journal = Neuropsychologia | volume = 35 | issue = 7| pages = 1017–34 | doi=10.1016/s0028-3932(97)00028-6|pmid=9226662 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, researchers argue that confabulation is a disorder resulting from failed "reality monitoring/source monitoring" (i.e. deciding whether a memory is based on an actual event or whether it is imagined).&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, M.K. (1991). Reality monitoring: Evidence from confabulation in organic brain disease patients. In G.P. Prigatano &amp; D.L. Schacter (Eds.), Awareness of deficit after brain injury. pp. 176–97. New York: Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt; Some neuropsychologists suggest that errors in retrieval of information from long-term memory that are made by normal subjects involve different components of control processes than errors made by confabulators.&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=8817460|year=1996|author1=Burgess|first1=P. W.|title=Confabulation and the control of recollection|journal=Memory|volume=4|issue=4|pages=359–411|last2=Shallice|first2=T|doi=10.1080/096582196388906}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emil Kraepelin|Kraepelin]] distinguished two subtypes of confabulation, one of which he called simple confabulation, caused partly by errors in the temporal ordering of real events. The other variety he called fantastic confabulation, which was bizarre and patently impossible statements not rooted in true memory. Simple confabulation may result from damage to memory systems in the medial temporal lobe. Fantastic confabulations reveal a dysfunction of the Supervisory System,&lt;ref&gt;Norman, D.A., &amp; Shallice, T. (1980). Attention to action. Willed and automatic control of behavior. University of California San Diego CHIP Report 99. Later published as: {{cite book|doi=10.1007/978-1-4757-0629-1_1|chapter=Attention to Action: Willed and Automatic Control of Behavior|title=Consciousness and Self-Regulation|pages=1–18|year=1986|last1=Norman|first1=Donald A.|last2=Shallice|first2=Tim|isbn=978-1-4757-0631-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is believed to be a function of the frontal cortex.

===Self-identity theory===
Some argue confabulations have a self-serving, emotional component in those with memory deficits that aids to maintain a coherent self-concept.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt; In other words, people who confabulate are motivated to do so, because they have gaps in their memory that they want to fill in and cover up.

===Temporality theory===
Support for the temporality account suggests that confabulations occur when an individual is unable to place events properly in time.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt; Thus, an individual might correctly state an action he/she performed, but say he/she did it yesterday, when he/she did it weeks ago. In the Memory, Consciousness, and Temporality Theory, confabulation occurs because of a deficit in temporal consciousness or awareness.&lt;ref name="temporal theory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dalla Barba|first=Gianfranco|author2=Boissé, Marie-Françoise|title=Temporal consciousness and confabulation: Is the medial temporal lobe "temporal"?|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=2010|volume=15|issue=1–3|pages=95–117|doi=10.1080/13546800902758017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monitoring theory===
Along a similar notion are the theories of reality and source monitoring theories.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; In these theories, confabulation occurs when individuals incorrectly attribute memories as reality, or incorrectly attribute memories to a certain source. Thus, an individual might claim an imagined event happened in reality, or that a friend told him/her about an event he/she actually heard about on television.

===Strategic retrieval account theory===
Supporters of the strategic retrieval account suggest that confabulations occur when an individual cannot actively monitor a memory for truthfulness after its retrieval.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; An individual recalls a memory, but there is some deficit after recall that interferes with the person establishing its falseness.

===Executive control theory===
Still others propose that all types of false memories, including confabulation, fit into a general memory and executive function model.&lt;ref name="varieties of false memory"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kopelman|first=Michael D.|title=Varieties of False Memory|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychology|date=1 May 1999|volume=16|issue=3–5|pages=197–214|doi=10.1080/026432999380762}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, a framework for confabulation was proposed that stated confabulation is the result of two things: Problems with executive control and problems with evaluation. In the executive control deficit, the incorrect memory is retrieved from the brain. In the evaluative deficit, the memory will be accepted as a truth due to an inability to distinguish a belief from an actual memory.&lt;ref name="models of confabulation" /&gt;

===In the context of delusion theories===
Recent models of confabulation have attempted to build upon the link between [[delusion]] and confabulation.&lt;ref name="varieties of confabulation and delusion"/&gt; More recently, a monitoring account for delusion, applied to confabulation, proposed both the inclusion of conscious and unconscious processing. The claim was that by encompassing the notion of both processes, spontaneous versus provoked confabulations could be better explained. In other words, there are two ways to confabulate. One is the unconscious, spontaneous way in which a memory goes through no logical, explanatory processing. The other is the conscious, provoked way in which a memory is recalled intentionally by the individual to explain something confusing or unusual.&lt;ref name="confabulation and delusion"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Martha|author2=Coltheart, Max|title=Confabulation and delusion: A common monitoring framework|journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry|date=2010|volume=15|issue=1–3|pages=346–76|doi=10.1080/13546800903441902}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fuzzy-trace theory===
[[Fuzzy-trace theory]], or FTT, is a concept more commonly applied to the explanation of judgement decisions.&lt;ref name="fuzzy trace theory" /&gt; According to this theory, memories are encoded generally (gist), as well as specifically (verbatim). Thus, a confabulation could result from recalling the incorrect verbatim memory or from being able to recall the gist portion, but not the verbatim portion, of a memory.

FTT uses a set of five principles to explain false-memory phenomena. Principle 1 suggests that subjects store verbatim information and gist information parallel to one another. Both forms of storage involve the surface content of an experience. Principle 2 shares factors of retrieval of gist and verbatim traces. Principle 3 is based on dual-opponent processes in [[false memory]]. Generally, gist retrieval supports false memory, while verbatim retrieval suppresses it. Developmental variability is the topic of Principle 4. As a child develops into an adult, there is obvious improvement in the acquisition, retention, and retrieval of both verbatim and gist memory. However, during late adulthood, there will be a decline in these abilities. Finally, Principle 5 explains that verbatim and gist processing cause vivid remembering. Fuzzy-trace Theory, governed by these 5 principles, has proved useful in explaining false memory and generating new predictions about it.&lt;ref name="Fuzzy-Trace Theory and False Memory"&gt;Brainerd, C. J., &amp; Reyna, V. F. (2002). Fuzzy-Trace Theory and False Memory. Current Directions In Psychological Science (Wiley–Blackwell), 11(5), 164–69.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Epistemic theory===
However, not all accounts are so embedded in the neurocognitive aspects of confabulation. Some attribute confabulation to epistemic accounts.&lt;ref name="faultless ignorance"/&gt; In 2009, theories underlying the causation and mechanisms for confabulation were criticized for their focus on neural processes, which are somewhat unclear, as well as their emphasis on the negativity of false remembering. Researchers proposed that an epistemic account of confabulation would be more encompassing of both the advantages and disadvantages of the process.

==Presentation==

===Associated neurological and psychological conditions===
Confabulations are often symptoms of various syndromes and psychopathologies in the adult population including: [[Korsakoff's syndrome]], [[Alzheimer's disease]], [[schizophrenia]], and [[traumatic brain injury]].

[[Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome]] is a neurological disorder typically characterized by years of chronic alcohol abuse and a nutritional thiamine deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=10487391|year=1999|author1=Homewood|first1=J|title=Thiamin deficiency and Korsakoff's syndrome: Failure to find memory impairments following nonalcoholic Wernicke's encephalopathy|journal=Alcohol |location=Fayetteville, N.Y.|volume=19|issue=1|pages=75–84|last2=Bond|first2=N. W.|doi=10.1016/s0741-8329(99)00027-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Confabulation is one salient symptom of this syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Dalla Barba G. |author2=Cipolotti L. |author3=Denes G. | year = 1990 | title = Autobiographical memory loss and confabulation in Korsakoff's syndrome: A case report | url = | journal = Cortex | volume = 26 | issue = 4| pages = 525–34 | doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(13)80302-4|pmid=2081390 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kessels RP, Kortrijk HE, Wester AJ, Nys GM. Confabulation behavior and false memories in Korsakoff's syndrome: role of source memory and executive functioning. Psychiatry Clin Neurosci. 2008 Apr; 62(2) 220–25.&lt;/ref&gt; A study on confabulation in Korsakoff’s patients found that they are subject to provoked confabulation when prompted with questions pertaining to [[episodic memory]], not [[semantic memory]], and when prompted with questions where the appropriate response would be "I don’t know."&lt;ref name="Korsakoff's"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Damme|first=Ilse|author2=d'Ydewalle, Géry|title=Confabulation versus experimentally induced false memories in Korsakoff patients|journal=Journal of Neuropsychology|year=2010|volume=4|issue=2|pages=211–30|doi=10.1348/174866409X478231}}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that confabulation in these patients is "domain-specific." Korsakoff’s patients who confabulate are more likely than healthy adults to falsely recognize [[Negative priming#Distractor inhibition model|distractor]] words, suggesting that false recognition is a "confabulatory behavior."

[[Alzheimer's disease]] is a condition with both neurological and psychological components. It is a form of dementia associated with severe frontal lobe dysfunction. Confabulation in individuals with Alzheimer's is often more spontaneous than it is in other conditions, especially in the advanced stages of the disease. Alzheimer's patients demonstrate comparable abilities to encode information as healthy elderly adults, suggesting that impairments in encoding are not associated with confabulation.&lt;ref name=Alzheimer&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cooper|first=Janine M.|author2=Shanks, Michael F. |author3=Venneri, Annalena |title=Provoked confabulations in Alzheimer's disease|journal=Neuropsychologia|date=11 May 2006|volume=44|issue=10|pages=1697–1707|doi=10.1016/j.neuropsychologia.2006.03.029|pmid=16697019}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, as seen in Korsakoff's patients, confabulation in Alzheimer's patients is higher when prompted with questions investigating episodic memory. Researchers suggest this is due to damage in the posterior cortical regions of the brain, which is a symptom characteristic of Alzheimer's Disease.

[[Schizophrenia]] is a psychological disorder in which confabulation is sometimes observed. Although confabulation is usually coherent in its presentation, confabulations of schizophrenic patients are often delusional&lt;ref&gt;Wing, J. K., Cooper, J. E., [[Norman Sartorius|Sartorius, N.]] 1974. The description and classification of psychiatric symptoms: An instruction manual for the PSE and catego system. London: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have noted that these patients tend to make up delusions on the spot which are often fantastic and become increasingly elaborate with questioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=17506924|year=2007|author1=Lorente-Rovira|first1=E|title=Confabulation in schizophrenia and its relationship to clinical and neuropsychological features of the disorder|journal=Psychological Medicine|volume=37|issue=10|pages=1403–12|last2=Pomarol-Clotet|first2=E|last3=McCarthy|first3=R. A.|last4=Berrios|first4=G. E.|last5=McKenna|first5=P. J.|doi=10.1017/S0033291707000566}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike patients with Korsakoff's and Alzheimer's, patients with schizophrenia are more likely to confabulate when prompted with questions regarding their semantic memories, as opposed to episodic memory prompting.&lt;ref name=schizophrenia&gt;{{cite journal|title=Confabulation in schizophrenia: A neuropsychological study|journal=Journal of the International Neuropsychological Society|date=1 November 2010|volume=16|issue=6|pages=1018–26|doi=10.1017/S1355617710000718|pmid=20630120|author1=Lorente-Rovira|first1=E|last2=Santos-Gómez|first2=J. L.|last3=Moro|first3=M|last4=Villagrán|first4=J. M.|last5=McKenna|first5=P. J.}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, confabulation does not appear to be related to any memory deficit in schizophrenic patients. This is contrary to most forms of confabulation. Also, confabulations made by schizophrenic patients often do not involve the creation of new information, but instead involve an attempt by the patient to reconstruct actual details of a past event.

[[Traumatic brain injury]] (TBI) can also result in confabulation. Research has shown that patients with damage to the inferior medial frontal lobe confabulate significantly more than patients with damage to the posterior area and healthy controls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Turner|first=Martha S. |author2=Cipolotti, Lisa |author3=Yousry, Tarek A. |author4=Shallice, Tim|title=Confabulation: Damage to a specific inferior medial prefrontal system|journal=Cortex|date=1 June 2008|volume=44|issue=6|pages=637–48|doi=10.1016/j.cortex.2007.01.002|pmid=18472034 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This suggests that this region is key in producing confabulatory responses, and that memory deficit is important but not necessary in confabulation. Additionally, research suggests that confabulation can be seen in patients with frontal lobe syndrome, which involves an insult to the frontal lobe as a result of disease or traumatic brain injury (TBI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1988 | title = Frontal amnesia and the dysexecutive syndrome | url = | journal = Brain and Cognition | volume = 7 | issue = 2| pages = 212–30 | doi=10.1016/0278-2626(88)90031-0|pmid=3377900 | author1 = Baddeley | first1 = A | last2 = Wilson | first2 = B }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year = 1997 | title = Confabulation in a dysexecutive patient: Implications for models of retrieval | url = | journal = Cortex | volume = 33 | issue = 4| pages = 743–52 | doi=10.1016/s0010-9452(08)70731-7|pmid=9444475 | author1 = Papagno | first1 = C | last2 = Baddeley | first2 = A }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  | year = 1996 | title = Exploring the Central Executive | url = | journal = Quarterly Journal of Experimental Psychology | volume = 49A | issue = 1| pages = 5–28 |doi=10.1080/713755608| last1 = Baddeley | first1 = Alan }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, rupture of the anterior or posterior communicating artery, subarachnoid hemorrhage, and encephalitis are also possible causes of confabulation.&lt;ref name=Baddeley1986/&gt;&lt;ref name="DallaBarba1993a"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Dalla Barba G | year = 1993 | title = Confabulation: knowledge and recollective experience | url = | journal = Cognitive Neuropsychology | volume = 10 | issue = 1| pages = 1–20 | doi=10.1080/02643299308253454}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Location of brain lesions===
Confabulation is believed to be a result of damage to the right frontal lobe of the brain.&lt;ref name="Moscovitch"/&gt; In particular, damage can be localized to the ventromedial frontal lobes and other structures fed by the anterior communicating artery (ACoA), including the basal forebrain, septum, fornix, cingulate gyrus, cingulum, anterior hypothalamus, and head of the caudate nucleus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=6539437 |year=1984 |author1=Alexander |first1=M. P. |title=Amnesia after anterior communicating artery aneurysm rupture |journal=Neurology |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=752–57 |last2=Freedman |first2=M |doi=10.1212/wnl.34.6.752}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid= 1596082 |year= 1992 |author1= Irle |first1= E |title= Memory disturbances following anterior communicating artery rupture |journal= Annals of Neurology |volume= 31 |issue= 5 |pages= 473–80 |last2= Wowra |first2= B |last3= Kunert |first3= H. J. |last4= Hampl |first4= J |last5= Kunze |first5= S |doi= 10.1002/ana.410310503 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Developmental differences===
While some recent literature has suggested that older adults may be more susceptible than their younger counterparts to have false memories, the majority of research on forced confabulation centers around children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brainerd |first=C. J. |author2=Reyna, V. F. |author3=Ceci, S. J.  |title=Developmental reversals in false memory: A review of data and theory |journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2008|volume=134|issue=3|pages=343–82|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.134.3.343|pmid=18444700 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are particularly susceptible to forced confabulations based on their high suggestibility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Lauren R. |author2=Purdy, Telisa L. |title=Suggestibility and source monitoring errors: blame the interview style, interviewer consistency, and the child's personality|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=489–506 |doi=10.1002/acp.1093}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Shapiro |first=Lauren R. |author2=Blackford, Cheryl |author3=Chen, Chiung-Fen |title=Eyewitness memory for a simulated misdemeanor crime: the role of age and temperament in suggestibility |journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |year=2005 |volume=19 |issue=3|pages=267–89 |doi=10.1002/acp.1089}}&lt;/ref&gt; When forced to recall confabulated events, children are less likely to remember that they had previously confabulated these situations, and they are more likely than their adult counterparts to come to remember these confabulations as real events that transpired.&lt;ref name="Children"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ackil |first=Jennifer K. |author2=Zaragoza, Maria S. |title=Memorial consequences of forced confabulation: Age differences in susceptibility to false memories |journal=Developmental Psychology |date=1 November 1998 |volume=34 |issue=6 |pages=1358–72 |doi=10.1037/0012-1649.34.6.1358|pmid=9823517 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Research suggests that this inability to distinguish between past confabulatory and real events is centered on developmental differences in source monitoring. Due to underdeveloped encoding and critical reasoning skills, children's ability to distinguish real memories from false memories may be impaired. It may also be that younger children lack the meta-memory processes required to remember confabulated versus non-confabulated events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghetti |first=Simona |author2=Castelli, Paola |author3=Lyons, Kristen E. |title=Knowing about not remembering: developmental dissociations in lack-of-memory monitoring |journal=Developmental Science |year=2010 |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=611–21 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-7687.2009.00908.x|pmid=20590725 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children's meta-memory processes may also be influenced by expectancies or biases, in that they believe that highly plausible false scenarios are not confabulated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ghetti |first=Simona |author2=Alexander, Kristen Weede|title="If It Happened, I Would Remember It": Strategic Use of Event Memorability in the Rejection of False Autobiographical Events |journal=Child Development |year=2004 |volume=75 |issue=2 |pages=542–61 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00692.x|pmid=15056205 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, when knowingly being tested for accuracy, children are more likely to respond, "I don’t know" at a rate comparable to adults for unanswerable questions than they are to confabulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Roebers |first=Claudia |author2=Fernandez, Olivia |title=The Effects of Accuracy Motivation on Children's and Adults' Event Recall, Suggestibility, and Their Answers to Unanswerable Questions |journal=Journal of Cognition and Development |year=2002 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=415–43 |doi=10.1207/S15327647JCD3,4-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scoboria|first=Alan |author2=Mazzoni, Giuliana |author3=Kirsch, Irving|title="Don't know" responding to answerable and unanswerable questions during misleading and hypnotic interviews |journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Applied |year=2008 |volume=14 |issue=3 |pages=255–65 |doi=10.1037/1076-898X.14.3.255}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, misinformation effects can be minimized by tailoring individual interviews to the specific developmental stage, often based on age, of the participant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Holliday |first=Robyn E. |author2=Albon, Amanda J. |title=Minimising misinformation effects in young children with cognitive interview mnemonics |journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology |year=2004 |volume=18 |issue=3 |pages=263–81 |doi=10.1002/acp.973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Provoked versus spontaneous confabulations===
There is evidence to support different cognitive mechanisms for provoked and spontaneous confabulation.&lt;ref name="Provoked Versus Spontaneous"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Schnider|first=Armin |author2=von Däniken, Christine |author3=Gutbrod, Klemens|title=The mechanisms of spontaneous and provoked confabulations|journal=Brain|date=19 February 1996|volume=119|issue=4|pages=1365–75|doi=10.1093/brain/119.4.1365}}&lt;/ref&gt; One study suggested that spontaneous confabulation may be a result of an amnesic patient’s inability to distinguish the chronological order of events in their memory. In contrast, provoked confabulation may be a compensatory mechanism, in which the patient tries to make up for their memory deficiency by attempting to demonstrate competency in recollection.

===Confidence in false memories===
Confabulation of events or situations may lead to an eventual acceptance of the confabulated information as true.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pickel|first=Kerri|title=When a lie becomes the truth: The effects of self-generated misinformation on eyewitness memory|journal=Memory|year=2004|volume=12|issue=1|pages=14–26|doi=10.1080/09658210244000072|pmid=15098618}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, people who knowingly lie about a situation may eventually come to believe that their lies are truthful with time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Polage|first=Danielle C.|title=Fabrication deflation? The mixed effects of lying on memory|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|issue=4|pages=455–65|doi=10.1002/acp.995}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview setting, people are more likely to confabulate in situations in which they are presented false information by another person, as opposed to when they self-generate these falsehoods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pezdek|first=Kathy|author2=Lam, Shirley T. |author3=Sperry, Kathryn |title=Forced confabulation more strongly influences event memory if suggestions are other-generated than self-generated|journal=Legal and Criminological Psychology|year=2009|volume=14|issue=2|pages=241–52|doi=10.1348/135532508X344773}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, people are more likely to accept false information as true when they are interviewed at a later time (after the event in question) than those who are interviewed immediately or soon after the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Melnyk|first=Laura|author2=Bruck, Maggie|title=Timing moderates the effects of repeated suggestive interviewing on children's eyewitness memory|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|issue=5|pages=613–31|doi=10.1002/acp.1013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Affirmative feedback for confabulated responses is also shown to increase the confabulator’s confidence in their response.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hafstad|first=Gertrud Sofie |author2=Memon, Amina |author3=Logie, Robert|title=Post-identification feedback, confidence and recollections of witnessing conditions in child witnesses|journal=Applied Cognitive Psychology|year=2004|volume=18|issue=7|pages=901–12|doi=10.1002/acp.1037}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in culprit identification, if a witness falsely identifies a member of a line-up, he will be more confident in his identification if the interviewer provides affirmative feedback. This effect of confirmatory feedback appears to last over time, as witnesses will even remember the confabulated information months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zaragoza|first=M. S.|author2=Payment, K. E. |author3=Ackil, J. K. |author4=Drivdahl, S. B. |author5=Beck, M. |title=Interviewing Witnesses: Forced Confabulation and Confirmatory Feedback Increase False Memories|journal=Psychological Science|year=2001|volume=12|issue=6|pages=473–77|doi=10.1111/1467-9280.00388|pmid=11760134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Among normal subjects===
On rare occasions, confabulation can also be seen in normal subjects.&lt;ref name="Burgess"/&gt; It is currently unclear how completely healthy individuals produce confabulations. It is possible that these individuals are in the process of developing some type of organic condition that is causing their confabulation symptoms. It is not uncommon, however, for the general population to display some very mild symptoms of provoked confabulations. Subtle distortions and intrusions in memory are commonly produced by normal subjects when they remember something poorly.

==Diagnosis and treatment==
Spontaneous confabulations, due to their involuntary nature, cannot be manipulated in a laboratory setting.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; However, provoked confabulations can be researched in various theoretical contexts. The mechanisms found to underlie provoked confabulations can be applied to spontaneous confabulation mechanisms. The basic premise of researching confabulation comprises finding errors and distortions in memory tests of an individual.

===Deese–Roediger–McDermott lists===
Confabulations can be detected in the context of the [[Deese–Roediger–McDermott paradigm]] by using the Deese–Roediger–McDermott lists.&lt;ref name="True and False"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Howe|first=Mark L. |author2=Cicchetti, Dante |author3=[[Sheree Toth|Toth, Sheree L.]] |author4=Cerrito, Beth M.|title=True and False Memories in Maltreated Children|journal=Child Development|date=1 September 2004|volume=75|issue=5|pages=1402–17|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8624.2004.00748.x|pmid=15369522 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Participants listen to audio recordings of several lists of words centered around a theme, known as the critical word. The participants are later asked to recall the words on their list. If the participant recalls the critical word, which was never explicitly stated in the list, it is considered a confabulation. Participants often have a false memory for the critical word.

===Recognition tasks===
Confabulations can also be researched by using continuous recognition tasks.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; These tasks are often used in conjunction with confidence ratings. Generally, in a recognition task, participants are rapidly presented with pictures. Some of these pictures are shown once; others are shown multiple times. Participants press a key if they have seen the picture previously. Following a period of time, participants repeat the task. More errors on the second task, versus the first, are indicative of confusion, representing false memories.

===Free recall tasks===
Confabulations can also be detected using a free recall task, such as a self-narrative task.&lt;ref name="mechanisms of spontaneous confabulation" /&gt; Participants are asked to recall stories ([[Semantic memory|semantic]] or [[Autobiographical memory|autobiographical]]) that are highly familiar to them. The stories recalled are encoded for errors that could be classified as distortions in memory. Distortions could include falsifying true story elements or including details from a completely different story. Errors such as these would be indicative of confabulations.

===Treatment===
Treatment for confabulation is somewhat dependent on the cause or source, if identifiable. For example, treatment of Wernicke–Korsakoff syndrome involves large doses of vitamin B in order to reverse the thiamine deficiency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=3140893|year=2011|author1=Spiegel|first1=D. R.|title=A Case of Probable Korsakoff's Syndrome: A Syndrome of Frontal Lobe and Diencephalic Structural Pathogenesis and a Comparison with Medial Temporal Lobe Dementias|journal=Innovations in Clinical Neuroscience|volume=8|issue=6|pages=15–19|last2=Lim|first2=K. J.|pmid=21779537}}&lt;/ref&gt; If there is no known physiological cause, more general cognitive techniques may be used to treat confabulation. A case study published in 2000 showed that [[Self-Monitoring Training]] (SMT)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/096020100411998|title=Treatment of stable delusional confabulations using self-monitoring training|journal=Neuropsychological Rehabilitation|volume=10|issue=4|pages=415–27|year=2000|last1=Dayus|first1=B.|last2=Van Den Broek|first2=M.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt; reduced delusional confabulations. Furthermore, improvements were maintained at a three-month follow-up and were found to generalize to everyday settings. Although this treatment seems promising, more rigorous research is necessary to determine the efficacy of SMT in the general confabulation population.

==Research==
Although significant gains have been made in the understanding of confabulation in recent years, there is still much to be learned. One group of researchers in particular has laid-out several important questions for future-study. They suggest more information is needed regarding the neural-systems that support the different cognitive processes necessary for normal source-monitoring. They also proposed the idea of developing a standard neuro-psychological test battery able to discriminate between the different types of confabulations. And there is a considerable amount of debate regarding the best approach to organizing and combining neuro-imaging, pharmacological, and cognitive/behavioral approaches to understand confabulation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1016/S1364-6613(98)01152-8|pmid=21227110|title=False memories and confabulation|journal=Trends in Cognitive Sciences|volume=2|issue=4|pages=137–45|year=1998|last1=Johnson|first1=M|last2=Raye|first2=C. L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent review article, another group of researchers contemplate issues concerning the distinctions between delusions and confabulation. They question whether delusions and confabulation should be considered distinct or overlapping disorders and, if overlapping, to what degree? They also discuss the role of unconscious processes in confabulation. Some researchers suggest that unconscious emotional and motivational processes are potentially just as important as cognitive and memory problems. Finally, they raise the question of where to draw the line between the pathological and the nonpathological. Delusion-like beliefs and confabulation-like fabrications are commonly seen in healthy individuals. What are the important differences between patients with similar etiology who do and do not confabulate? Since the line between pathological and nonpathological is likely blurry, should we take a more dimensional approach to confabulation? Research suggests that confabulation occurs along a continuum of implausibility, bizarreness, content, conviction, preoccupation, and distress, and impact on daily life.&lt;ref name=LangdonTurne2010&gt;{{citation |date=2010 |author1=Langdon, R.  |author2=Turner, M |title=Delusion and confabulation: Overlapping or distinct distortions in reality? |journal=Cognitive Neuropsychiatry |volume= 15 |issue=1 |pages= 1–13 |pmid=20043251|doi=10.1080/13546800903519095}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Congenital epulis''' is a proliferation of cells most frequently occurring on the alveolar ridge of the [[maxilla|upper jaw]] at birth.  Less frequently the mass may arise from the mandibular alveolus.  Rare cases can arise from the tongue.  This lesion is more commonly found in female babies, suggesting hormonal involvement during embryonic development.  The cause of this type of [[epulis]] is unknown.  Also known as congenital granular cell tumor or Neumann's tumor; historically referred to as granular cell myoblastoma.

Multiple lesions occur in 10% of affected neonates.  The tumor is typically pedunculated and varies in maximum size from 0.5 cm to 9 cm.  The lesion is typically painless and does not increase in size after discovery.  Some small lesions may regress over time.  Treatment is surgical excision.  Recurrence is extremely rare even after incomplete excision.

{{food safety}}
'''Critical Control Point''' (CCP) is the point where the failure of Standard Operation Procedure (SOP) could cause harm to customers and to the business, or even loss of the business itself. It is a point, step or procedure at which controls can be applied and a food safety hazard can be prevented, eliminated or reduced to acceptable (critical) levels. The most common CCP is cooking, where food safety managers designate critical limits. CCP identification is also an important step in risk and reliability analysis for water treatment processes.

== Food in cooking ==
In the United States, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) establishes minimum internal temperatures for cooked foods.  It is important to remember that these values can be superseded by state or local health code requirements, but they cannot be below the FDA limits.  Temperatures should be measured with a probe thermometer in the thickest part of meats, or the center of other dishes, avoiding bones and container sides. Minimum internal temperatures are set as follows:

'''165°F (74°C) for 15 seconds'''
*[[Poultry]] (such as whole or ground chicken, turkey, or duck)
*
*Stuffed meats, fish, poultry, and pasta
*Any previously cooked foods that are reheated from a temperature below 135°F (57°C), provided they have been refrigerated or warm less than 2 hours
*Any [[Potentially Hazardous Food|potentially hazardous foods]] cooked in a microwave, such as poultry, meat, fish, or eggs

'''155°F (68°C) for 15 seconds'''
*[[Ground meat]]s (such as [[ground beef|beef]] or pork)
*Injected meats (such as flavor-injected roasts or brined hams)
*Ground or minced fish
*[[Eggs (food)|Eggs]] that will be held for a length of time before eaten

'''145°F (63°C) for 15 seconds'''
*Steaks and chops such as beef, pork, veal, and lamb
*Fish
*Eggs cooked for immediate service

'''145°F (63°C) for 4 minutes'''
*Roasts (can be cooked to lower temperatures for increased lengths of time)

'''135°F (57°C) for 15 seconds'''
*Cooked fruits or vegetables that will be held for a length of time before eaten
*Any commercially processed, ready-to-eat foods that will be held for a length of time before eaten

In addition, hot food must be held at a minimum interval of 135°F (57°C) if it is not immediately consumed. The temperature must be checked every 4 hours or else labeled with a discard time. Although monitored hot food can be held indefinitely in this way without a food safety concern, the nutritional value, flavor, and quality can suffer over long periods.

'''Dietary indiscretion''' is the tendency of certain animal of eating unusual items.   These are frequently relatively small items not encountered in a natural habitat and thus sampled because of mistaken identity, a familiar flavor, or simple curiosity. This includes modern manufactured items such as shiny metal foil or plastic objects, as well as foods harmful to health. Domesticated animals such as [[dog]]s and [[goat]]s, and even circus animals like [[Ostrich]]es are even more prone to the effect due to their contact with people. The dietary indiscretion of fish, especially [[Shark]]s, may occur when the mouth is the major organ of detection and processing.

'''Distribution''' in [[pharmacology]] is a branch of [[pharmacokinetics]] which describes the reversible transfer of a drug from one location to another within the body.

Once a drug enters into systemic circulation by absorption or direct administration, it must be distributed into interstitial and intracellular fluids. Each organ or tissue can receive different doses of the drug and the drug can remain in the different organs or tissues for a varying amount of time.&lt;ref name="Carmine"&gt;Carmine Pascuzzo Lima. ''Farmacocinética III:Distribución'' Available on [http://www.geocities.com/carminepascuzzolima/FC_Distrib.PDF] (in Spanish). Visited 10 January 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The distribution of a drug between tissues is dependent on [[vascular permeability]], regional blood flow, cardiac output and [[perfusion]] rate of the tissue and the ability of the drug to bind tissue and [[plasma protein]]s and its lipid solubility. [[pH partition]] plays a major role as well. The drug is easily distributed in highly perfused organs such as the liver, heart and kidney. It is distributed in small quantities through less perfused tissues like muscle, fat and peripheral organs. The drug can be moved from the plasma to the tissue until the equilibrium is established (for unbound drug present in plasma).

The concept of compartmentalization of an organism must be considered when discussing a drug’s distribution. This concept is used in pharmacokinetic modelling.

== Factors that affect distribution ==
There are many factors that affect a drug's distribution throughout an organism, but Pascuzzo&lt;ref name="Carmine" /&gt; considers that the most important ones are the following: an organism's physical volume, the removal rate and the degree to which a drug binds with plasma proteins and / or tissues.

=== Physical volume of an organism ===
This concept is related to multi-compartmentalization. Any drugs within an organism will act as a [[Solution|solute]] and the organism's tissues will act as [[solvents]]. The differing specificities of different tissues will give rise to different concentrations of the drug within each group. Therefore, the chemical characteristics of a drug will determine its distribution within an organism. For example, a liposoluble drug will tend to accumulate in body fat and water-soluble drugs will tend to accumulate in extracellular fluids.  The [[volume of distribution]] (V&lt;sub&gt;D&lt;/sub&gt;) of a drug is a property that quantifies the extent of its distribution. It can be defined as the theoretical volume that a drug would have to occupy (if it were uniformly distributed), to provide the same concentration as it currently is in blood plasma. It can be determined from the following formula:
&lt;math&gt;Vd = \frac {Ab}{Cp}\,&lt;/math&gt;
Where: &lt;math&gt;Ab&lt;/math&gt; is total amount of the drug in the body and &lt;math&gt;Cp&lt;/math&gt; is the drug's plasma concentration.

As the value for &lt;math&gt;Ab&lt;/math&gt; is equivalent to the dose of the drug that has been administered the formula shows us that there is an inversely proportional relationship between &lt;math&gt;Vd&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Cp&lt;/math&gt;. That is, that the greater &lt;math&gt;Cp&lt;/math&gt; is the lower &lt;math&gt;Vd&lt;/math&gt; will be and vice versa. It therefore follows that the factors that increase &lt;math&gt;Cp&lt;/math&gt; will decrease &lt;math&gt;Vd&lt;/math&gt;. This gives an indication of the importance of knowledge relating to the drug's plasma concentration and the factors that modify it.

If this formula is applied to the concepts relating to bioavailability, we can calculate the amount of drug to administer in order to obtain a required concentration of the drug in the organism ('''loading dose''):

&lt;math&gt;Dc = \frac {Vd . Cp}{Da . B}&lt;/math&gt;

This concept is of clinical interest as it is sometimes necessary to reach a certain concentration of a drug that is known to be optimal in order for it to have the required effects on the organism (as occurs if a patient is to be scanned).

=== Removal rate ===
A drug's removal rate will be determined by the proportion of the drug that is removed from circulation by each organ once the drug has been delivered to the organ by the circulating blood supply.&lt;ref name="Carmine" /&gt; 
This new concept builds on earlier ideas and it depends on a number of distinct factors:
* The drugs characteristics, including its pKa.
* Redistribution through an organism's tissues: Some drugs are distributed rapidly in some tissues until they reach equilibrium with the plasma concentration. However, other tissues with a slower rate of distribution will continue to absorb the drug from the plasma over a longer period. This will mean that the drug concentration in the first tissue will be greater than the plasma concentration and the drug will move from the tissue back into the plasma. This phenomenon will continue until the drug has reached equilibrium over the whole organism. The most sensitive tissue will therefore experience two different drug concentrations: an initial higher concentration and a later lower concentration as a consequence of tissue redistribution.
* Concentration differential between tissues.
* Exchange surface.
* Presence of natural barriers. These are obstacles to a drug's diffusion similar to those encountered during its absorption. The most interesting are:
** Capillary bed permeability, which varies between tissues.
** Blood-brain barrier: this is located between the blood plasma in the cerebral blood vessels and the brain's extracellular space. The presence of this barrier makes it hard for a drug to reach the brain.
** Placental barrier: this prevents high concentrations of a potentially toxic drug from reaching the foetus.

=== Plasma protein binding ===
{{Main | Plasma protein binding}}
Some drugs have the capacity to bind with certain types of proteins that are carried in blood plasma. This is important as only drugs that are present in the plasma in their free form can be transported to the tissues. Drugs that are bound to plasma proteins therefore act as a reservoir of the drug within the organism and this binding reduces the drug's final concentration in the tissues. The binding between a drug and plasma protein is rarely specific and is usually [[labile]] and reversible. The binding generally involves [[ionic bond]]s, [[hydrogen bond]]s, [[Van der Waals force]]s and, less often, [[covalent bond]]s. This means that the bond between a drug and a protein can be broken and the drug can be replaced by another substance (or another drug) and that, regardless of this, the protein binding is subject to [[Saturation (chemistry)|saturation]]. An equilibrium also exists between the free drug in the blood plasma and that bound to proteins, meaning that the proportion of the drug bound to plasma proteins will be stable, independent of its total concentration in the plasma.

In vitro studies carried out under optimum conditions have shown that the equilibrium between a drug's plasmatic concentration and its tissue concentration is only significantly altered at binding rates to plasma proteins of greater than 90%. Above these levels the drug is "sequestered", which decreases its presence in tissues by up to 50%. This is important when considering pharmacological interactions: the tissue concentration of a drug with a plasma protein binding rate of less than 90% is not going to significantly increase if that drug is displaced from its union with a protein by another substance.  On the other hand, at binding rates of greater than 95% small changes can cause important modifications in a drug's tissue concentration. This will, in turn, increase the risk of the drug having a toxic effect on tissues.

Perhaps the most important plasma proteins are the [[albumin]]s as they are present in relatively high concentrations and they readily bind to other substances. Other important proteins include the [[glycoprotein]]s, the [[lipoprotein]]s and to a lesser degree the [[globulin]]s.

It is therefore easy to see that clinical conditions that modify the levels of plasma proteins (for example, [[hypoalbuminemia]]s brought on by renal dysfunction) may affect the effect and toxicity of a drug that has a binding rate with plasma proteins of above 90%.

==Redistribution==
Highly lipid-soluble drugs given by intravenous or inhalation routes are initially distributed to organs with high blood flow. Later, less vascular but more bulky tissues (such as muscle and fat) take up the drug—plasma concentration falls and the drug is withdrawn from these sites. If the site of action of the drug was in one of the highly perfused organs, redistribution results in termination of the drug action. The greater the lipid solubility of the drug, the faster its redistribution will be. For example, the anaesthetic action of thiopentone is terminated in a few minutes due to redistribution. However, when the same drug is given repeatedly or continuously over long periods, the low-perfusion and high-capacity sites are progressively filled up and the drug becomes longer-acting.

It is reversible process of moving drug of sites of highly perfused to systemic circulation,FMAS

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5177">The '''Empiric school''' of [[medicine]] (''Empirics'', ''Empiricists'', or ''Empirici'', {{lang-el|Ἐμπειρικοί}}) was an ancient school of medicine in [[Ancient Greek medicine|ancient Greece]] and [[Medicine in ancient Rome|Rome]]. They were so called from the word ''empeiria'' (ἐμπειρία "experience") because they professed to derive their knowledge from ''experiences'' only, and in doing so set themselves in opposition to the [[Dogmatic school]]. [[Serapion of Alexandria]], and [[Philinus of Cos]], are regarded as the founders of this school in the 3rd century BC. Other physicians who belonged to this sect were: [[Apollonius of Citium]], [[Glaucias (physician)|Glaucias]], [[Heraclides of Tarentum|Heraclides]], [[Bacchius of Tanagra|Bacchius]], [[Zeuxis of Tarentum|Zeuxis]], [[Menodotus of Nicomedia|Menodotus]], [[Theodas of Laodicea|Theodas]], [[Herodotus (physician)|Herodotus of Tarsus]], [[Aeschrion of Pergamon|Aeschrion]], [[Sextus Empiricus]], and [[Marcellus Empiricus]]. The sect survived a long time, as Marcellus lived in the 4th century. The doctrines of this school are described by [[Aulus Cornelius Celsus]] in the introduction to his ''[[De Medicina]]''.

The Empiric school of medicine had substantial overlap with the Greek philosophical school of [[Pyrrhonism]]. [[Galen]] noted that the Empirics approached medicine exactly as the Pyrrhonists approached the whole of life.&lt;ref&gt;Galen, "An Outline of Empiricism" sections 43 and 82.&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the well-known Empirics were also Pyrrhonist teachers, including: [[Sextus Empiricus]], [[Herodotus (physician)|Herodotus of Tarsus]], [[Heraclides of Tarentum|Heraclides]], [[Theodas of Laodicea|Theodas]], and [[Menodotus of Nicomedia|Menodotus]].

==Doctrines==
The Empiric school said that it was necessary to understand the ''evident causes'' of disease, but considered the inquiry after the ''hidden causes'' and ''natural actions'' to be fruitless, because [[Nature]] is incomprehensible. That these things cannot be understood appears from the controversies among [[philosopher]]s and [[physician]]s, and in the way in which the methods of practice differed from place to place, one method being used in [[Rome]], another in [[Egypt]], and another in [[Gaul]]. Often too, the causes are evident; as in a [[wound]], and if the evident cause does not suggest a method of curing, then much less so other obscure methods. This being the case, it is much better to seek relief from things certain and tried; that is, from remedies as learned from experience.

They said that medicine, in its infancy, was deduced from [[experiment]]s; for the sick, in a time when there were no physicians, had either taken [[food]] in the first days of their illness, or had abstained, and that the illness was more quickly alleviated in one group than the other. This and other instances occurring daily were observed by people diligent enough to realize which method was best to cure particular conditions, and hence the art of medicine arose. Medicine was not invented in consequence of [[reason]]ing, but that [[theory]] was sought after the discovery of medicine.

They asked, too, whether reason prescribed the same as experience, or something different: if the same, then it is not necessary; if different, then mischievous. Initially there was a necessity to examine [[cure|remedies]] with the greatest accuracy, but now they are sufficiently ascertained; there are no new diseases, and hence no need for any novel methods of healing. If a patient had an unknown type of [[illness]], the physician would not recourse to obscure knowledge, but would see what type of illness was most nearly allied, and to make a trial of the medicines used to treat the allied condition.

What matters is not what causes, but what cures the condition. It does not matter why a concoction works, only that it does work. Nor is it necessary to know how we [[breathing|breathe]], but what relieves difficult breathing. Likewise we should not seek the cause of motion in the [[arteries]], but what each kind of motion indicates. These things are known by experience and [[epilogism|epilogistic]] reasoning. There is no value in [[dissect]]ing dead bodies, since the state of the organs are very different in dead bodies compared to living ones.

They supported their opinions in favour of experience with the famous "''Tripod of Medicine''":
*'''Observation''': The observations which the [[patient]] had made in the course of the illness concerning the course of the disease and results of any treatments.
*'''History''': A written collection of observations made by others.
*'''Analogy''': When treating a new illness, selecting a plan of treatment by comparing it with a known disease which most resembled it.

The top six ingredients are water, corn [[maltodextrin]], sugar, [[milk protein concentrate]], [[canola oil]], and [[soy protein]] isolate.&lt;ref&gt;[https://ensure.com/nutrition-products/ensure-original "Ensure® Original Milk Chocolate Nutrition Shake"], ensure.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1903, Harry C. Moores and Stanley M. Ross launched the "Moores &amp; Ross Milk Company", which specialized in bottling milk for home delivery for the first few years.&lt;ref name=Ohio&gt;{{cite web|title=Ross  Laboratories|url=http://www.ohiohistorycentral.org/w/Ross_Laboratories|website=Ohio History Central|accessdate=25 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964, however, the company merged with Abbott Laboratories. A drink called Ensure was first marketed by Ross Laboratories in 1973.&lt;ref name=Ohio/&gt;

In the 1990s, Ensure and other nutritional drink products like [[Mead Johnson]]'s Sustacal and [[Nestlé]]'s Boost and Resource brands were fiercely competing to capture market share among healthy adults.&lt;ref name=NYT1997/&gt; In 1996, Ensure had sales of about $300 million and accounted for 80% of protein supplement sales; Abbott spent $45.4 million to advertise Ensure during the first nine months of 1996, around 70% more than it spent during the same period of 1995.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gellene|first1=Denise|title=Ensure Maker Settles Ad Charges|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-01-03/business/fi-14929_1_ensure-protein|work=Los Angeles Times|date=3 January 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] said that ads for Ensure were "the most misleading food ad" of that year.&lt;ref name=NYT1997/&gt; In 1997, Abbott settled charges from the [[Federal Trade Commission]] that it was falsely marketing Ensure as having a similar amount of vitamins as multivitamin supplements, as being recommended by doctors more than any other nutritional supplement, and as being recommended by doctors as a way to stay healthy and active for people who were otherwise healthy.&lt;ref name=NYT1997&gt;{{cite news|last1=Burros|first1=Marian|title=Eating Well|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/01/08/garden/eating-well.html|work=The New York Times|date=8 January 1997 |accessdate=9 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Docket No. C-3745: In the Matter of Abbot Laboratories, a corporation.|url=https://www.ftc.gov/sites/default/files/documents/cases/1997/06/c3745cmp.pdf|publisher=FTC|date=May 30, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Products==
When Abbott split off its pharmaceuticals division, [[Abbvie]], in 2013, the Ensure product line remained with Abbott with the other nutritional products.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Marbury|first1=Donna|title=As Abbott and AbbVie move toward split-up, Wall Street waits|url=http://newsarchive.medill.northwestern.edu/chicago/news-211938.html|accessdate=26 October 2016|publisher=Medill Reports|date=November 29, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2182">'''Euthymia''' ({{lang-el|εὐθυμία}}, "gladness, good mood, [[tranquillity|serenity]]", literally "good [[thumos]]") is a term used by [[Democritus]] to refer to one of the root aspects of human life's goal.

[[Diogenes Laërtius]] records Democritus' position as "The chief good he asserts to be cheerfulness (euthymia); which, however, he does not consider the same as pleasure; as some people, who have misunderstood him, have fancied that he meant; but he understands by cheerfulness, a condition according to which the soul lives calmly and steadily, being disturbed by no fear, or superstition, or other [[Passions (philosophy)|passion]]."&lt;ref&gt;http://classicpersuasion.org/pw/diogenes/dldemocritus.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]]’s [[De Tranquillitate Animi|essay on tranquility]], he uses the Greek word ''euthymia'', which he defines as “believing in yourself and trusting that you are on the right path, and not being in doubt by following the myriad footpaths of those wandering in every direction.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=iPDUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT32&amp;lpg=PT32&amp;dq=believing+in+yourself+and+trusting+that+you+are+on+the+right+path,+and+not+being+in+doubt+by+following+the+myriad+footpaths+of+those+wandering+in+every+direction.&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Je4s_cM6X6&amp;sig=EGNvhD50W_iyC5DhFDzHf7HM3G8&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwju0KSEnbrUAhXCl5QKHVjwAo8Q6AEIMTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=believing%20in%20yourself%20and%20trusting%20that%20you%20are%20on%20the%20right%20path,%20and%20not%20being%20in%20doubt%20by%20following%20the%20myriad%20footpaths%20of%20those%20wandering%20in%20every%20direction.&amp;f=false|title=The Daily Stoic: 366 Meditations on Wisdom, Perseverance, and the Art of Living: Featuring new translations of Seneca, Epictetus, and Marcus Aurelius|last=Holiday|first=Ryan|last2=Hanselman|first2=Stephen|date=2016-10-27|publisher=Profile Books|isbn=9781782833178|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Extrapyramidal symptoms''' ('''EPS'''), also known as '''extrapyramidal side effects''' ('''EPSE'''), are drug-induced movement disorders that include [[Acute (medicine)|acute]] and tardive symptoms.  These symptoms include [[dystonia]] (continuous spasms and muscle contractions), [[akathisia]] (motor restlessness), [[parkinsonism]] (characteristic symptoms such as rigidity), [[Hypokinesia|bradykinesia]] (slowness of movement), [[tremor]], and [[tardive dyskinesia]] (irregular, jerky movements).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pierre, JM|title=Extrapyramidal symptoms with atypical antipsychotics: incidence, prevention and management|journal=Drug Safety|year=2005|volume=28|issue=3|pages=191–208|pmid=15733025|doi=10.2165/00002018-200528030-00002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antipsychotics are often discontinued due to inefficacy and intolerable side effects such as extrapyramidal symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Effectiveness of Antipsychotic Drugs in Patients with Chronic Schizophrenia|author=Jeffrey A. Lieberman, M.D.|author2=((T. Scott Stroup, M.D., M.P.H.))|author3=Joseph P. McEvoy, M.D.|author4=Marvin S. Swartz, M.D.|author5=Robert A. Rosenheck, M.D.|author6=((Diana O.

Since it is difficult to measure extrapyramidal symptoms, rating scales are commonly used to assess the severity of movement disorders. The Simpson-Angus Scale (SAS), Barnes Akathisia Rating Scale (BARS), Abnormal Involuntary Movement Scale (AIMS), and Extrapyramidal Symptom Rating Scale (ESRS) are rating scales frequently used for such assessment and are not weighted for diagnostic purposes;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; these scales can help physicians weigh the benefit/expected benefit of a medication against the degree of distress which the side effects are causing the patient, aiding in the decision to maintain, reduce, or discontinue the causative medication/s.

==Name==
The [[extrapyramidal system]] regulates posture and skeletal muscle tone.  Extrapyramidal symptoms (also called extrapyramidal side effects) get their name because they are symptoms of disorders in this system.

==Causes==

Extrapyramidal symptoms are most commonly caused by [[typical antipsychotic]] drugs that antagonize dopamine D2 receptors.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; The most common [[typical antipsychotics]] associated with EPS are [[haloperidol]] and [[fluphenazine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Nevena Divac|author2=Milica Prostran|author3=Igor Jakovcevski|author4=Natasa Cerovac|last-author-amp=yes|title=Second-Generation Antipsychotics and Extrapyramidal Adverse Effects|journal=BioMed Research International|volume=2014|pages=6 pages|year=2014|doi=10.1155/2014/656370|url=http://www.hindawi.com/journals/bmri/2014/656370/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Atypical antipsychotics have lower D2 receptor affinity or higher serotonin 5-HT2A receptor affinity which lead to lower rates of EPS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Correll C|title=Mechanism of Action of Antipsychotic Medications|journal=J Clin Psychiatry|year=2014|volume=75|issue=9|page=e23|doi=10.4088/jcp.13078tx4c}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some research has shown that [[atypical antipsychotics]] are just as likely as conventional antipsychotics to cause EPS, when used at high doses.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Other anti-dopaminergic drugs, like the antiemetic [[metoclopramide]], can also result in extrapyramidal side effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Moos, DD.|author2=Hansen, DJ.|title=Metoclopramide and Extrapyramidal Symptoms: A Case Report|journal=Journal of PeriAnesthesia Nursing|volume=23|issue=5|date=October 2008|pages=292–299|doi=10.1016/j.jopan.2008.07.006|pmid=18926476}}&lt;/ref&gt; Short and long-term use of antidepressants such as [[selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors]] (SSRI), [[serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors]] (SNRI), and [[norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitors]] (NDRI) have also resulted in EPS.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Madhusoodanan S, Alexeenko L, Sanders R, Brenner R|title=Extrapyramidal symptoms associated with antidepressants—A review of the literature and an analysis of spontaneous reports|journal=Annals of Clinical Psychiatry|year=2010|volume=22|issue=3|pages=148–156|pmid=20680187|url=https://www.aacp.com/pdf%2F0810%2F0810ACP_Madhusoodanan.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, [[duloxetine]], [[sertraline]], [[escitalopram]], [[fluoxetine]], and [[bupropion]] have been linked to the induction of EPS.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; Other causes of extrapyramidal symptoms can include brain damage and meningitis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Ori Scott|author2=Simona Hasal|author3=Helly R.

Anaesth.|year=2000|volume=85|issue=1|pages=129–135|doi=10.1093/bja/85.1.129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conditions===

* [[dystonia|Acute dystonic reactions]]: muscular spasms of neck, jaw, back, extremities, eyes, throat, and tongue; highest risk in young men&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* [[Akathisia]]: A feeling of internal motor restlessness that can present as tension, nervousness, or anxiety&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;
* [[Pseudoparkinsonism]]: drug-induced [[parkinsonism]] (rigidity, [[bradykinesia]], tremor, masked [[facies (medical)]], shuffling [[gait]], stooped posture, [[sialorrhoea]], and [[seborrhoea]]; greater risk in the elderly).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Although [[Parkinson's disease]] is primarily a disease of the [[nigrostriatal pathway]] and not the extrapyramidal system, loss of dopaminergic neurons in the [[substantia nigra]] leads to dysregulation of the extrapyramidal system. Since this system regulates posture and skeletal muscle tone, a result is the characteristic [[bradykinesia]] of Parkinson's.
* [[Tardive dyskinesia]]: involuntary muscle movements in the lower face and distal extremities; this can be a chronic condition associated with long-term use of antipsychotics.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

==Treatment==

[[Anticholinergic]] drugs are used to control [[neuroleptic]]-induced EPS, although [[akathisia]] may require [[beta blocker]]s or even [[benzodiazepine]]s. If the EPS are induced by an [[antipsychotic]], EPS may be reduced by dose titration or by switching to an [[atypical antipsychotic]], such as [[aripiprazole]], [[ziprasidone]], [[quetiapine]], [[olanzapine]], [[risperidone]], or [[clozapine]]. These medications possess an additional mode of action that is believed to negate their effect on the [[nigrostriatal]] pathway, which means they are associated with fewer extrapyramidal side-effects than "conventional" antipsychotics ([[chlorpromazine]], [[haloperidol]], etc.), although some research has shown that second generation neuroleptics cause EPS at the same rate as the first generation drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Second-Generation Antipsychotics Just as Likely as Older Drugs to Cause EPS|date=March 26, 2012|author=Kermit Cole|work=Mad in America|url=https://www.madinamerica.com/2012/03/second-generation-antipsychotics-no-better-than-first-but-education-lags/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Extrapyramidal motor side-effects of first- and second-generation antipsychotic drugs|author=Michael J. Peluso|author2=Shôn W. Lewis|author3=Thomas R. E. Barnes|author4=Peter B. Jones|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|year=2012|volume=200|issue=5|pages=387–92|doi=10.1192/bjp.bp.111.101485|pmid=22442101|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/content/200/5/387.long}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commonly used medications for EPS are [[anticholinergic]] agents such as [[benztropine]] (Cogentin), [[diphenhydramine]] (Benadryl), and [[trihexyphenidyl]] (Artane). Another common course of treatment includes [[dopamine agonist]] agents such as [[pramipexole]]. These medications reverse the symptoms of extrapyramidal side effects caused by antipsychotics or other drugs that either directly or indirectly inhibit dopaminergic neurotransmission.

Studies are yet to be undertaken on the optimum dosage of the causative drugs to reduce their side effects (extrapyramidal symptoms (EPS)).

'''Health marketing''' is a new, customer-centered, approach to [[public health]] promotion that applies traditional marketing principles and theories alongside science-based strategies to protect and promote the health of diverse populations.It involves creating, communicating, and delivering messages for the public on [[Preventive medicine|prevention]], [[health promotion]] and health protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/healthcommunication/toolstemplates/whatishm.html|title=What is Health Marketing? {{!}} Gateway to Health Communication {{!}} CDC|date=2017-02-23|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2017-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Health marketing is one of the ways advancements in medicine and in health-protecting services, such as insurance, are made widely known.
A good example is the current drive in [[Kenya]] to promote circumcision among communities that do not customarily circumcise. [[Medical research]]ers have recently documented that circumcision is 65% effective in preventing [[HIV]] infection among men.

The marketing strategy would follow the traditional 4 "P's" of marketing namely:

*The "product" in question in this case the surgical procedure.
*The "place" which refers to the access to this procedure.
*"Promotion" refers to creating awareness and hence demand.
*"Price" refers to the cost of the procedure e.g. money, time, reputation etc.

"Health marketing" is a term rarely used in public health and related disciplines.  "Social marketing" or "integrated marketing communication" are more commonly used in public health and other disciplines to refer to marketing-based planning frameworks for public health communication.

&lt;br /&gt;

== Medical marketing in the private sector ==
'''Health marketing''' or '''Medical Marketing''' is a specialized branch of [[marketing]]. Medical marketing was born from the necessity for private health professionals to attract new patients, the characteristics of the health market makes it a unique kind of marketing. Medical marketing is usually a [[business to consumer]] (B2C) service. Doctors using this type of marketing usually offer beauty related services, such as [[aesthetic medicine]], [[plastic surgery]], [[dental surgery]] or [[dermatology]].  

=== Regulations. ===
In many countries it is forbidden to pay for advertising of medical procedures, specially in aesthetics and [[plastic surgery]]. Showing “before and after” pictures or making references to someone’s body type can be seen as harmful for society.

The solution for a health care professional or a [https://www.medicalmarketingagency.net medical marketing agency] is [[Instagram marketing]] since nowadays it remains unregulated, being the fastest growing social media in the planet gives doctors an opportunity to acquire new patients through Instagram Marketing.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2828">The '''Healthcare Quality Improvement Partnership''' ('''HQIP''') was established in April 2008 to promote quality in UK health services, by increasing the impact that [[clinical audit]] has on healthcare quality in [[England]] and [[Wales]]. It is led by a consortium of the [[Academy of Medical Royal Colleges]], [[Royal College of Nursing]] and [[National Voices]].

The Partnership holds the contract to manage the [[National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme]] (NCAPOP). This consists of more than 25 clinical audits that cover a range of medical, surgical and mental health conditions. Their purpose is to engage clinicians across England and Wales in systematic evaluation of their clinical practice against standards, and to encourage improvement in the quality of care. This programme is gradually being extended to other areas of healthcare, working with clinical and professional advisory groups.

HQIP also runs the National Clinical Audit Forum (NCAF) for online communication among those interested in clinical audit,  cooperates with regulatory bodies, issues guidance on good clinical audit practice and hosts events that bring national and local clinical audit practitioners together. Additionally, the Partnership works closely with the National Clinical Audit Advisory Group (NCAAG), which advises the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] on clinical audit and is central to commissioning new national clinical audits.

In November 2012 the HQIP won contracts from the [[Department of Health (United Kingdom)|Department of Health]] to manage the National Clinical Audit and Patient Outcomes Programme (NCAPOP) and the Clinical Outcome Review Programme (CORP).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=DH awards audit contracts to HQIP|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/finance/dh-awards-audit-contracts-to-hqip/5052400.article#.UoZXxcRT6UM|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=29 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is centrally involved in the publication of consultant level quality and mortality data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Exclusive: Details on surgeon rankings plans revealed|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/exclusive-details-on-surgeon-rankings-plans-revealed/5056461.article#.UoZZJ8RT6UM|accessdate=15 November 2013|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=21 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4351">Iraq had developed a centralized free healthcare system in the 1970s using a hospital based, capital-intensive model of [[curative care]]. The country depended on large-scale imports of medicines, medical equipment and even nurses, paid for with oil export income, according to a “Watching Brief” report issued jointly by the [[United Nations Children’s Fund]] and the [[World Health Organization]] in July 2003.
Unlike other poorer countries, which focused on mass health care using primary care practitioners, Iraq developed a Westernized system of sophisticated hospitals with advanced medical procedures, provided by specialist physicians. The UNICEF/WHO report noted that prior to 1990, 97 percent of the urban dwellers and 71 percent of the rural population had access to free primary health care; just 2 percent of hospital beds were privately managed.

==Funding and charges==
During its last decade, the [[History of Iraq|regime]] of [[Saddam Hussein]] cut health funding by 90 percent, contributing to a substantial deterioration in health care.&lt;ref name=cp&gt;[http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Iraq.pdf Iraq country profile] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101204033230/http://lcweb2.loc.gov/frd/cs/profiles/Iraq.pdf |date=2010-12-04 }}. [[Library of Congress]] [[Federal Research Division]] (August 2006). ''This article incorporates text from this source, which is in the [[public domain]].''&lt;/ref&gt; During that period, [[maternal mortality]] increased nearly threefold, and the salaries of medical personnel decreased drastically.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Medical facilities, which in 1980 were among the best in the Middle East, deteriorated.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Conditions were especially serious in the south, where [[malnutrition]] and [[water-borne disease]]s became common in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; In 2005 the incidence of [[typhoid]], [[cholera]], [[malaria]], and [[tuberculosis]] was higher in Iraq than in comparable countries.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; The [[Iraq War|conflict of 2003]] destroyed an estimated 12 percent of [[hospital]]s and Iraq’s two main [[public health laboratories]].&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; In 2004 some improvements occurred.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Using substantial international funds, some 240 hospitals and 1,200 primary health centers were operating, shortages of some medical materials had been alleviated, the training of medical personnel had begun, and the [[inoculation]] of children was widespread.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; However, [[sanitary conditions]] in hospitals remained unsatisfactory, trained personnel and medications were in short supply, and health care remained largely unavailable in regions where violent insurgency continued.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; In 2005 there were 15 hospital beds, 6.3 [[physician|doctor]]s, and 11 [[nurse]]s per 10,000 population.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt; Plans called for US$1.5 billion of the national budget to be spent on health care in 2006.&lt;ref name=cp/&gt;

The cost of admission to a public hospital was set at 500 dinars in the 1980s, and has not been increased since. This was supposed to cover the cost of all treatment. In February 2016 all public hospitals in Iraq began to charge patients for individual services.  The healthcare budget for 2016 has been cut by about 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonell|first1=Nick|title=Diary|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n09/nick-mcdonell/diary|accessdate=2 May 2016|publisher=London Review of Books|date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staffing==
More than 2000 doctors were killed between 2003 and 2014. in 2016 there were fewer than thirty cardiac surgeons left in the country.

==Effects of disorder==
Iraqi doctors report that they have to pretend to resuscitate patients when this is futile because relatives, with militia connections, sometimes demand blood money if they are dissatisfied with the doctor’s efforts.  In 2010 the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq]] increased sentences for anyone convicted of threatening or attacking a doctor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McDonell|first1=Nick|title=Diary|url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/v38/n09/nick-mcdonell/diary|accessdate=2 May 2016|publisher=London Review of Books|date=5 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6699">'''Inferior alveolar nerve block''' (abbreviated to '''IANB''', and also termed '''inferior alveolar nerve anesthesia''' or '''inferior dental block''') is a [[nerve block]] technique which induces anesthesia (numbness) in the areas of the mouth and face innervated by one of the [[inferior alveolar nerve]]s which are paired on the left and right side. These areas are the skin and mucous membranes of the lower lip, the skin of the chin, the lower teeth and the labial gingiva of the anterior teeth, all unilaterally to the midline of the side on which the block is administered.&lt;ref&gt;Agur, Anne M.R., and Arthur F. Dalley. Grant's Atlas Of Anatomy. 12th ed. Maryland, USA: Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins, 2009. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, depending on technique, the [[long buccal nerve]] may not be &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aker|first=F. D.|date=2001|title=Blocking the buccal nerve using two methods of inferior alveolar block injection|journal=Clinical Anatomy (New York, N.Y.)|volume=14|issue=2|pages=111–119|doi=10.1002/1098-2353(200103)14:23.0.CO;2-3|issn=0897-3806|pmid=11241746}}&lt;/ref&gt; anesthetized by an IANB and therefore an area of buccal gingiva adjacent to the lower posterior teeth will retain normal sensation unless that nerve is anesthetized separately, via a (long) [[Buccal nerve#Anesthesia|buccal nerve block]]. The inferior alveolar nerve is a branch of the [[mandibular nerve]], the third division of the [[trigeminal nerve]]. This procedure attempts to anaesthetise the inferior alveolar nerve prior to it entering the [[mandibular foramen]] on the medial surface of the mandibular ramus.

==Symptoms of anesthesia==
Administration of anesthesia near the mandibular foramen causes blockage of the inferior alveolar nerve and the nearby lingual nerve by diffusion (includes supplying the [[tongue]]).  This causes patients to lose sensation in:
* their mandibular teeth on one side (via inferior alveolar nerve block)
* their [[lower lip]] and chin on one side (via [[mental nerve]] block)
* and parts of their tongue and lingual gingival tissue on one side except on the cheek side of the mandibular molars (via [[lingual nerve]] block); a buccal block will anesthetize this later tissue area.
Another symptom is harmless numbness and tingling of the body of the tongue and floor of the mouth, which indicates that the lingual nerve, a branch of the mandibular nerve, is anesthetized. Another symptom that can occur is “lingual shock” as the needle passes by the lingual nerve during administration. The patient may make an involuntary movement, varying from a slight opening of the eyes to jumping in the chair. This symptom is only momentary, and anesthesia will quickly occur.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Injection techniques==
There are a number of techniques that are commonly used to achieve inferior alveolar nerve anesthesia.  The most commonly used techniques involve an attempted block of an entire portion of the inferior alveolar nerve:
* Inferior alveolar nerve block or IANB - The nerve is approached from the opposite side of the mouth over the contralateral premolars. After piercing the mandibular tissue on the medial border of the mandibular ramus within the pterygomandibular space and then contacting medial surface of the alveolar bone as well as being lateral to the pterygomandibular fold and the sphenomandibular ligament, the injection is given.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* Gow-Gates technique - Invented by [[Australia]]n dentist George A.E. Gow-Gates in the mid-1970s, the needle is directed at the neck of the condyle just under the insertion of the lateral pterygoid muscle.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doctorspiller.com/gow-gates_block.htm Gow-Gates technique, explained]&lt;/ref&gt; This is used for more extensive anesthesia or when there is failure of the IANB
* Vazirani-Akinosi technique - Invented by Sunder J. Vazirani in 1960 and later reintroduced in 1977 by Oyekunle J. Akinosi, a closed-mouth injection technique, the syringe is "advanced parallel to the maxillary occlusal plane at the level of the [[maxilla]]ry [[mucogingival junction]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Meechan JG |title=How to overcome failed local anaesthesia |journal=Br Dent J |volume=186 |issue=1 |pages=15–20 |date=January 1999 |pmid=10028738 |url=http://www.nature.com/bdj/journal/v186/n1/full/4800006a.html |doi=10.1038/sj.bdj.4800006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is used when the patient cannot open his mouth enough for the IANB.

==Complications==
* The most common adverse effect of this injection is accidental self-inflicted trauma after the procedure, either by biting the lip or tongue or by thermal burn caused by inadvertent drinking of fluid that is too hot. This classically occurs in children or those with learning disability.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Local Anesthesia for the Dental Hygienist, Logothetis, Elsevier, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;
* A blood vessel may be punctured accidentally and a hematoma or "blood blister" may occur that will heal over time.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* If needle is positioned too posteriorly, anesthetic may be put into [[parotid gland]], that may cause transient facial paralysis of the facial nerve or cranial Nerve VII (7). Symptoms of this temporary loss of the use of the muscles of facial expression include the inability to close the eyelid and the drooping of the labial commissure on the affected side for a few hours.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Illustrated Anatomy of the Head and Neck, Fehrenbach and Herring, Elsevier, 2012, page 216&lt;/ref&gt;
* Also if the needle is placed too medially the medial pterygoid muscle can be injected, resulting in [[trismus]].
* The sphenomandibular ligament may act as a barrier to the agent if the injection is given too shallow and the lingual nerve is only anesthetized.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* This injection can rarely cause [[needle tract infection]]s of the [[pterygomandibular space]].&lt;ref name="Connor 1988"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Connor|first=JP|author2=Edelson, JG|title=Needle tract infection. A case report.|journal=Oral surgery, oral medicine, and oral pathology|date=April 1988|volume=65|issue=4|pages=401–3|pmid=3163131|doi=10.1016/0030-4220(88)90351-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hupp 2008"&gt;{{cite book|vauthors=Hupp JR, Ellis E, Tucker MR |title=Contemporary oral and maxillofacial surgery|year=2008|publisher=Mosby Elsevier|location=St. Louis, Mo.|isbn=9780323049030|pages=317–333|edition=5th}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is because the mouth contains many types of bacteria which are normally harmless by virtue of the physical barrier that the mucosa presents. However, if they are inoculated into the tissues during an injection, they can become [[pathogenic]] (disease causing).

'''Insanity in Ancient and Modern Life, with chapters on its prevention''' is a medical book written by the English physicist and practical worker in medicinal psychology [[Daniel Hack Tuke]] (1827-1895) in 1878.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rollin|first=Henry|date=1995/03|title=Obituary: Daniel Hack Tuke|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/the-british-journal-of-psychiatry/article/obituary-daniel-hack-tuke/CBFE2B8DB46D2C934BA0CC0D8B72EFD5|journal=The British Journal of Psychiatry|language=en|volume=166|issue=3|pages=403–405|doi=10.1192/bjp.166.3.403|issn=0007-1250}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuke dedicated much of his time encouraging humanitarian treatment for the mental ill. His knowledge is summarized and clarified in many of his medical books, in which he often takes controversial and novel standpoints.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://museumofthemind.org.uk/blog/post/biography-and-psychology-iv-daniel-hack-tuke-1827-1895|title=Biography and Psychology IV: Daniel Hack Tuke (1827 - 1895)|work=Bethlem Museum of the Mind|access-date=2018-07-01|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The presented book discusses the causes of [[mental disorder]]s in relation to the maturation of society and considers factors which can positively contribute to the prevention of psychiatric diseases.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://archive.org/details/39002086347110.med.yale.edu|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life : with chapters on its prevention|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|publisher=London : Macmillan and Co.|others=Cushing/Whitney Medical Library Yale University|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=Chapter 1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical context ==
Being part of the movement dynamic psychotherapy in the later 19th century, Tuke is acknowledged to be one of the earliest authors to coin the term  [[Psychotherapeutic|"Psychotherapeutics]]". He combines psychological insights similar to [[Sigmund Freud|Freud]]'s [[psychodynamic therapy]] with a medical and somatic approach that Tuke adopted from his studies of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chaney|first=Sarah|date=2017-04|title=The action of the imagination|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/0952695116687225|journal=History of the Human Sciences|language=en|volume=30|issue=2|pages=17–33|doi=10.1177/0952695116687225|issn=0952-6951}}&lt;/ref&gt; Living in a time in which mental illness is no longer regarded as the consequence of having committed a religious sin, a more biological basis and environmental foundation of [[psychiatric diseases]] was established. An especially pronounced insight of this viewpoint is that mental illness is caused by genetical factors as well as influenced by [[nurture]] and is therefore treatable and may be even preventable.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== The breakthroughs of the 19th century ===
In the 17th and 18th centuries there was a gradually increasing focus on the brain itself and how brain injury affects behavioral displays like in the famous case of [[Phineas Gage]]. Additionally, a growing interest in [[reflex]]es facilitated the viewpoint that behavior is not necessarily self-generated but can be also environmentally caused. However, despite the huge medicinal and factual progress in the study of the brain and its influence on behavior, the new insights did not yet contribute to an improved treatment of psychiatric diseases and brain injuries.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/297404207|title=Historical and conceptual issues in psychology|last=Marc.|first=Brysbaert,|date=2009|publisher=Pearson/Prentice Hall|others=Rastle, Kathy.|isbn=9780273718185|location=Harlow, England|oclc=297404207}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was an increasing interest in mental processes and behavior, until the middle of the 19th century psychology as a scientific study and subject itself was largely disregarded and rather considered to be a branch of [[philosophy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sturm|first=Thomas|date=2006|title=Is there a problem with mathematical psychology in the eighteenth century?

Irrevocably, this mindset turned enormously due to five scientific discoveries that enabled the development of modern [[neurophysiology]] and are still relevant for today's [[psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1988-08|title=Nineteenth Century Origins of Neuroscientific Concepts.

This is also an opinion held by Tuke himself, as he not only waited for a proof of a physical basis for normal behavior but also as an explanation for what he terms "insanity".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== The emergence of experimental psychology ===
Although psychology as an independent scientific study was largely discredited by well-known scientists and philosophers such as [[Immanuel Kant]] (1724-1804), scientists such as [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]] (1776–1841), took the issue as a reason to invent a mathematical basis for scientific psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Kim|first=Alan|title=Johann Friedrich Herbart|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2015/entries/johann-herbart/|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite his unsuccessful attempts to quantify behavior, his efforts were taken up by the scientists [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]] (1795–18 78) and [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]] (1801–1887), aiming to measure the mathematical relationships between the physical magnitudes of external stimuli and the psychological intensities of the resulting sensations. Their vast and unique insights are later coined by the term "[[Psychophysics]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://psychclassics.yorku.ca/Fechner/|title=Classics in the History of Psychology -- Fechner (1860/1912)|website=psychclassics.yorku.ca|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the breakthroughs in neuronal structure and [[physiology]] (the five most important listed above), evidenced a physical and biological nature of human functioning that can serve as the basis for scientific experiments in studying behavior.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; One of the principal founders of [[Experimental Physiology|experimental physiology]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz|Hermann Helmholtz]] (1821–1894), conducted experimental studies of a wide range of topics that would later be of huge interest to psychologists. The speed of neural transmission, the physical natures of sound and color and our perception of them count as some of the most important insights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/sex-murder-and-the-meaning-life/201703/who-was-psychologys-first-true-genius|title=Who Was Psychology's First True Genius?|website=Psychology Today|language=en-US|access-date=2018-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with the German physiologists, psychologists and philosopher [[Wilhelm Wundt]] (1832-1920) he addressed more complicated psychological questions than had not been investigated experimentally in the past. Of particular interest for both was the nature of [[apperception]], which is defined as the point at which a perception occupies the central focus of conscious [[awareness]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Barnouw|first=Jeffrey|date=1981|title=Review of Leibniz: Perception, Apperception, and Thought|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/2738408|journal=Eighteenth-Century Studies|volume=15|issue=1|pages=102–106|doi=10.2307/2738408}}&lt;/ref&gt; To conduct all the studies, in 1879, Wundt founded the first laboratory worldwide that was specifically dedicated to original research in experimental psychology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Danziger|first=Kurt|date=1980|title=Wundt's psychological experiment in the light of his philosophy of science|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/BF00308696|journal=Psychological Research|language=en|volume=42|issue=1-2|pages=109–122|doi=10.1007/bf00308696|issn=0340-0727}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tuke himself as a [[physicist]] was largely interested in the practical and [[experiment]]al part of psychology and psychiatry but contributed to the development of [[experimental psychology]] mainly by providing theories and hypothesis about biological and environmental factors that influence the mind and also cause mental illnesses.

== Content ==
The presented book discusses the causes of [[mental disorder]]s in relation to the maturation of society and considers factors which can positively contribute to the prevention of psychiatric diseases. By considering the [[Ecology|ecological]] and social conditions of people, starting in prehistoric times until the late nineteen hundreds, it is analyzed in twelve chapters how these factors and a steady growth in complexity of civilizations contribute to an alleged increase in prevalence of mental illnesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=Preface|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He claims, that emotional and cognitive conflict is a natural human response to life's injuries, which he defines as the rapidly changing lifestyle during the [[Industrial Revolution|British Industrial revolution]] from the Mid-18th century to early 19th century and the rising gap between the rich and the poor. Consequently, the majority of insane people would always be found in a civilized community.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=LaBier|first=Douglas|date=1987|title=Modern Madness|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.5840/bemag1987113|journal=Business Ethics: The Magazine of Corporate Responsibility|volume=1|issue=1|pages=9–12|doi=10.5840/bemag1987113|issn=0894-6582}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Causes of insanity ===
In the first chapter, Tuke gives a broad overview about the diverse set of factors that he considers to be of vital importance when answering what causes and influences the development of insanity. By doing this, he acknowledges biological, societal, environmental, cultural, as well as religious and political factors. He claims, that all these factors accumulate and increase in intensity when societies became more complex and civilized.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

==== Intoxication and defective nourishment ====
Throughout history, intoxication could be found in almost any community, especially the consume of [[Alcoholism|alcohol]] but also of other [[stimulant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mann|first=K.|date=2000-01-01|title=ONE HUNDRED YEARS OF ALCOHOLISM: THE TWENTIETH CENTURY|url=https://doi.org/10.1093/alcalc/35.1.10|journal=Alcohol and Alcoholism|language=en|volume=35|issue=1|pages=10–15|doi=10.1093/alcalc/35.1.10|issn=1464-3502}}&lt;/ref&gt; The intake of mind- and mood-altering drugs is distributed in time and space. Tuke claims, that intoxication leads to the exhaustion of the nervous system and inhibits it to function properly. This degeneration would accumulate in succeeding generations, especially when considering the increasing importance alcohol gains with the maturation of society.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

With a similar mechanism he describes that malnutrition contributes to an increased chance to develop insanity, which in his opinion could be evidenced by every underfed population.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; This would also apply to the British society at the time. Until the late 19th century, chronic hunger and [[malnutrition]] were the norm for the majority of the population of the world, including Britain. The life expectancy in Britain suffered immensely, in large part due to malnutrition. A usual worker of a factory usually did not exceed the age of 40.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/53903770|title=The escape from hunger and premature death, 1700-2100 : Europe, America, and the Third World|last=William.|first=Fogel, Robert|date=2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0521808782|location=Cambridge|oclc=53903770}}&lt;/ref&gt; Partly the shortage of food can be explained by the fact that food supply in Great Britain was adversely affected by the [[Corn Laws]] (1815-1846). The Corn Laws, which imposed tariffs on imported grain, were enacted to keep prices high in order to benefit domestic producers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Vamplew|first=Wray|title=Malthus and the Corn Laws|date=1986|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-1-349-18218-3_9|work=Malthus and His Time|pages=129–139|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan UK|isbn=9781349182206|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; As additionally population grew exponentially in these years in urban areas, among others noticed by [[Thomas Robert Malthus|Thomas Maltus]], not enough food could be provided and money was scarce among the lower ranks of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=1. The Essay on Population, 1798-1807|date=1997-01-31|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.3138/9781442681156-004|work=The Economics of Thomas Robert Malthus|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=9781442681156|access-date=2018-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; All these factors increased poverty and malnutrition and may explain the high prevalence of insane people among the lower working classes of British Society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=Chapter 5|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not surprisingly, Tuke names pauperism too be one of the major influential factors causing insanity.

==== Dissolute Life, Depraved Habits and Disappointments in Love ====
Tuke was among the first scientists to recognize that emotional problems and general life satisfaction highly influence the mental health of a person, disregarding his societal rank. During the [[Industrial Revolution in the United Kingdom|Industrial Revolution]] steadily rising standards caused changes in the mindset of society. An increased incidence of emotional conflict was the result of the competitive spirit of the modern civilization.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; When people compared their living standards, they often became dissatisfied with their own and luxury goods grew in importance. Tuke explains, that this kind of depression interferes with normal cognitive functioning and additionally, often leads to the consume of drugs and thus indirectly precipitates insanity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Overwork ====
Another consequence of the industrial revolution in the 18th century was the increased number of hours per day that people belonging to the working class had to absolve with only little payment. As increasingly more factories were build, more workers were needed in total and a worker had to work on average more under terrible working conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dickerson|first=Dennis C.|last2=Asher|first2=Robert|last3=Stephenson|first3=Charles|date=1991-06|title=Labor Divided: Race and Ethnicity in United States Labor Struggles, 1835-1960.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/2078152|journal=The Journal of American History|volume=78|issue=1|pages=321|doi=10.2307/2078152|issn=0021-8723}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oftentimes, even children were used as workers in the factory to ensure the survival of the family. On average, children were paid less than 10 Cent for a fourteen-hours shift.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://firstindustrialrevolution.weebly.com/working-and-living-conditions.html|title=Working and Living Conditions|website=The Industrial Revolution|access-date=2018-08-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, also members from upper classes were confronted with an increased amount of work to maintain their business. According to Tuke, both, the mental and the physical exhaustion like business or monetary worries, lead to emotional stress which has similar effects on mental health as dissatisfaction with the own living circumstances.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Intellectual Strain ====
Intellectual strain in form of excesses of educational work, is also a potent cause Tuke introduces in his book. Similar to the physical overwork mentioned above, Tuke expects similar consequences for mental exhaustion. As with the industrial society also the external societal pressure rises, so did the urge for self-perfection and societal improvement. The pressure and overthinking in turn, is thought to cause sleeplessness which interferes with the proper formation of memories.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Contrastingly, he underlines that the contrary, namely mental underload is also a dangerous factor considering the development of mental illnesses. He states that the upper classes of society are heading towards a style of living in which intellect is of minor importance as compared to luxuries and reputation. Less cognitive engagement would cause cognitive abilities to decline in the long-term and would also elevate mental tension.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=Chapter 6|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Religious and political excitement ====
Political excitement is termed as one of the major influential factors that positively contribute to insanity. As society increases in size, opinions become more diversified.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Richerson|first=Peter J.|last2=Boyd|first2=Robert|date=1999-09|title=Complex societies|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s12110-999-1004-y|journal=Human Nature|volume=10|issue=3|pages=253–289|doi=10.1007/s12110-999-1004-y|issn=1045-6767}}&lt;/ref&gt; The traditionally and religiously shaped views become challenged, which according to Tuke interferes with the implementation of an ideal society. This would open room for insanity to arise and spread. Additionally, political and religious excitement is hypothesized to generally lead to emotional stress and upheaval which would disturb the mental equilibrium that is required in order to ensure mental health.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

=== Prevalence of Insanity in the course of history ===

==== Insanity in Prehistoric times ====
As compared to a completely uncivilized tribe, Tuke states that more mature communities are increasingly exposed to unfavorable psychological influences. Excessive as well as deprived education, the increasing acceptance of drug consume, and the competitive spirit rising in the course of history are claimed to be among the major causes of insanity.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; He emphasizes that this is not the result of civilization itself, but that humans have never realized the ideal of a society and are probably never able to fully apply it.  Living in a civil society in his view means to reclaim from [[Barbarisation|barbarism]], intemperance, dissipation and [[pauperism]] and to support and help each other.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; According to Tuke, the prevalence of insanity in prehistoric times was the lowest because people were living in uncultivated tribes and were not interested in modern education. Moreover, although intoxication is reported in early times, the mind-altering drugs that Native tribes used or still use, are mostly used for rituals and only rarely in private. Hereby, Tuke refers to old Indian tribes that use Marihuana in some of their ceremonies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Moussaieff|first=Arieh|last2=Mechoulam|first2=Raphael|date=2009-10|title=Boswelliaresin: from religious ceremonies to medical uses; a review of in-vitro, in-vivo and clinical trials|url=https://doi.org/10.1211/jpp.61.10.0003|journal=Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmacology|language=en|volume=61|issue=10|pages=1281–1293|doi=10.1211/jpp.61.10.0003|issn=0022-3573}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, even the so-called savages did not behave intemperate even when intoxicated. Moreover, according to Tuke, prehistoric tribes did not suffer from religious and political perplexities nor commercial speculation. People may believe in evil [[spirit]]s or ghosts but this mental imbalance is counteracted by the belief in charms. All in all, Tuke explains that savages in the past and present live an uncultivated but satisfied life with no pursue after perfection and luxury. In his view, this renders them almost invulnerable to mental disease.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Nevertheless, he stresses throughout his book that society itself is something every human should pursue and a savage life also has his own drawbacks, but insanity not being among them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=Chapter 9|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Insanity among the Jews and Egypts ====
According to Tuke, as time passes, intoxication became increasingly important. He refers to a biblical story, in which Noah planted a vineyard together with Satan. The bible also evidences that intemperate behavior while intoxicated became more prevalent. Yet, for example alcohol was not yet the scourge of society which it is in his opinion among some nations today. In generally, Jews are even considered to be sober and Egypts to have only rare experiences with alcohol in the public and private domain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=21–22|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jews as well as Egypts are thought to live a simple but not savage life in accordance with nature and moral standards. As their lives are centered around food, they did not have experience scarcity. Tuke, explains that their agricultural lifestyle, prevented malnutrition and hunger even among the poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=Chapter 2|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As also the other risk factors do not apply to this period of time, Tuke explains this to be the reason for the himself found low prevalence of insane people at the time.

==== Insanity in relation to the working classes ====
In this chapter, he underlines with the statistics the immense increase of insanity in the last 20 years. He claims that 20 years ago, only one out of 577 was diagnosed to be insane, whereas this raised to 1 in 370. He is convinced, that alone these today's statistics yield enough ground to conclude that insanity is determined by the modern civilized society of [[Industrialisation|industrialized]] Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=87–88|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even totally diverse states of a nation lead to the same determination. He declares that he is aware, that this increasing number may be partially explained by more diagnoses in general as well as a rising awareness for mental illnesses. Nevertheless, he asserts that the statistics prove that this cannot solely be explained by these two factors and that when looking at history, clear signs exist that point towards factors that evolved with the maturation of society.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=89|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, he also observes a trend within the population at his time, in which it becomes obvious that most insane people are to be found in the pauper part of society. He attributes this to the absence of rational employment that seems to be present in the lower ranks of the community. Pauper people in his eyes, are victims of debasing habits, indulgence in vices, less literary and scientific pursuits and mental stagnation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=91–92|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mentality of the lower classes seems to be coined by recklessness, drunkenness, poverty and misery which are all risk factors in developing mental illness. He terms this "uncivilized behavio[u]r in a civilized society". As moral and physical conditions are generally bad among the poor, the clear trend in prevalence seems obvious to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=93–94|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, since the pauper population misses education and mental work, they often seek other ways for excitement mostly in a political manner. Their intense emotional disturbance, alternating between intense joy and disappointment, in combination with malnutrition and manifold miseries are clear factors that influence the mental health of a worker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=95–96|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is aware that the dissatisfaction of life caused by the bad living and working conditions prove additionally counteractive to mental health and facilitate the intake of stimulants and the development of intemperate habits which only further exacerbate their misery.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=99|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As also children and women are employed in the factories, no time can be provided to adequately teach and raise the children to ensure a healthy cerebral development to prevent insanity in following generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=101–102|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He concludes that among the working class almost every influential factor that he mentions in the first chapter on the causes of insanity, especially apply to the working class. Member of this societal class are generally poor, underfed, oftentimes intoxicated, dissatisfied and disappointed and generally neither in physical nor in mental balance. He infers that by the maturation of society the gap enlarges and thus simultaneously gives rise to even more insanity.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==== Insanity among the upper classes ====
Although the prevalence of insanity seems to be rather absent in the upper classes of society, the statistics also identified a few cases of insanity among the rich. Tuke explains this by some of the prior mentioned factors that also apply to this rank of society. Admittedly, the prosperous people do not face physical overwork in the factories, but oftentimes severe mental work.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=107|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argues that the mental exhaustion caused by the maintenance of the business in many cases leads to mental fatigue and sleeplessness, which both interfere with proper memory formation.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Business worry and money troubles lead to anxiety which disturbs the emotional and cognitive balance and thus concurs to the development of insanity.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Additionally, the upper especially intellectual classes are confronted with immense societal pressure to perform at their best, further increasing anxiety. On the other hand, other parts of the higher classes are undereducated and their daily livings circle around the possession of luxury goods and to fulfil beauty standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=108|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another immensely critical factors lies in the enormous use of stimulants, especially alcohol, which is a daily practice in upper sections of the population. Alcohol is part of each meal and drunken because of boredom and reputation. This mindset is toxic in Tuke's eyes and more importantly degenerates cerebral structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=104|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Prevention of Insanity ===
Although Tuke is already aware that insanity is also partially favored by a specific combination of genetic material and thus predetermined, in the last chapters he designates some characteristics and habits which can avoid insanity and terms this "auto-prophylaxes".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=Chapter 8|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He emphasizes that in general a mentally as well as physically balances life is of great importance to ensure mental health. This can reached by enough sleep, physical and mental exercise and a generally healthy lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=Chapter 10|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further stresses to distance oneself from any type of intoxication as it interferes with the regular cognitive functioning and also harms the cerebral cortex.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Next to the general physical conditions, he also points to the importance of a morally acceptable way of living by avoiding political and religious fanaticism and mysticism, "Mental safety will be greatly increased by pursuing that middle course between them with an honest appreciation of the laws of emotions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=181|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He underlines the importance of cheerfulness and to decrease the importance of luxury goods and reputation to ensure the health of the nervous system.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;  Children should be adequately thought and formed according to religious moral norms and provided with knowledge, to assure a healthy cerebral development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|date=1878|title=Insanity in ancient and modern life, with chapters on its prevention.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12755-000|journal=|volume=|pages=194–196|doi=10.1037/12755-000|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As society decreases social pressure and diminished the gap between the rich and the poor, there is hope for the future to prevent the unfavorable trend civilization is heading to.

== Reactions to his work ==
Despite his large contribution to today's knowledge about and theses on the sociocultural causes of mental illnesses, Tuke renders largely unknown after his death. This may be partially explained by the fact that he acknowledged himself only as a compiler of information rather than an innovator.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, he remains a major figure in British psychiatry in the late 19th century. During his lifetime he was a well-known scientist and psychiatrist whose work received much attention within the medical and psychiatric ranks. His contemporaries often regarded him as a "scientific sponge", gathering already existing knowledge about mental illnesses and aligning the findings with his social and societal observations.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was widely appreciated by taking controversial standpoints, even if they do not entirely match current scientific opinions and literature.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; During his visits of several asylums in 1853, he even raised international attention for his scientific and statistic work about the prevalence of mental disorders and the causes. As a consequence of his rich experiences abroad, Tuke was soon seen as an international expert on mental illness and was lecturing at York Medical School.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; 5 years later, in collaboration with [[John Charles Bucknill]], he published the ''Manual of Psychological Medicine'' which served as a standard work for lunacy for years''.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bucknill|first=John Charles|last2=Tuke|first2=Daniel H.|date=1858|title=A manual of psychological medicine: The history, nosology, description, statistics, diagnosis, pathology, and treatment of insanity.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/10552-000|doi=10.1037/10552-000}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the joint editor of the ''Journal of Mental Science starting in'' 1880'','' he continues to be regarded as one of the most influential scientists from 19th century British psychiatry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Chisholm, Hugh, (22 Feb. 1866–29 Sept. 1924), Editor of the Encyclopædia Britannica (10th, 11th and 12th editions)|date=2007-12-01|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1093/ww/9780199540884.013.u194658|work=Who Was Who|publisher=Oxford University Press|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although he often focused on novel and rather uncommon phenomena, he was largely accepted and appreciated by leading British psychiatrists, neurologists and psychologists, including Jean-Marie Charcot, [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] and [[Victor Horsley]] with which he worked on the ''Dictionary of Psychological medicine''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

His widespread and even international recognition positively contributed the way with which his work was received. His books, including the '''''Insanity in Ancient and Modern life''''', are often cited and referred to in scientific literature about sociocultural causes and influential factors contributing to insanity in the past and present.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jordan|first=Philip D.|last2=Deutsch|first2=Albert|date=1946-06|title=The Mentally Ill in America: A History of Their Care and Treatment from Colonial Times|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.2307/1896763|journal=The Mississippi Valley Historical Review|volume=33|issue=1|pages=161|doi=10.2307/1896763|issn=0161-391X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/1011125267|title=Mental illness in ancient medicine : from Celsus to Paul of Aegina|others=Thumiger, Chiara,, Singer, P.

== Other publications ==
Tuke wrote many medical books, especially focusing on the topic of insanity and mental illnesses and its causes and resulting implications for treatment.  During his time when he conducted a new course on psychological medicine at York Medical School, he also published several case studies and notes on [[Psychopathology|psychopathological]] patients which he observed in striking detail.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ireland|first=William W.|date=1895-07|title=Daniel Hack Tuke, M.R.C.S., M.D., LL.D.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1192/bjp.41.174.378|journal=Journal of Mental Science|volume=41|issue=174|pages=377–386|doi=10.1192/bjp.41.174.378|issn=0368-315X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Together with Dr. John Bucknill, his medical colleague, he agreed upon writing the well-known ''Manual of Psychological Medicine'', in which he discusses the classification, causes and the different forms of insanity. In 1880, he became a joint editor of the [[Journal of Mental Science]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bynum|first=Helen|date=2009-03-11|title=Madness to Mental Illness: A History of the Royal College of Psychiatrists|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1001/jama.2009.271|journal=JAMA|volume=301|issue=10|pages=1070|doi=10.1001/jama.2009.271|issn=0098-7484}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, he published one of his most influential books, ''Illustrations of the Influence of the Mind Upon the Body in Health and Disease'' (1872).&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Tuke|first=Daniel Hack|title=Influence of the emotions upon sensation.|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1037/12367-007|work=Illustrations of the influence of the mind upon the body in health and disease: Designed to elucidate the action of the imagination.|pages=126–146|publisher=Henry C. Lea|access-date=2018-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book ''Insanity in Ancient and Modern Life'' (1878), followed by ''The History of the Insane in the British Isles'' (1882) count as some of his most influential works.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=1992-05|title=150 Years of British Psychiatry, 1841–1991.

In all this works he reflects on the culturally and societal conditions people find themselves in and relates this to causes and prevalence of insanity between different nations.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Together with ''The Insanity in Ancient and Modern Life'', the medical book ''The Past and Present Provision for the Insane Poor in Yorkshire'' considers the differences in prevalence among upper and lower social classes.

Finally, he became an editor of the ''Dictionary of Psychological Medicine'', being the most cherished psychiatric work of the 19th century. Among an international group consisting of 128 authors, Tuke analyses and discusses in 68 sections many of the complex social, [[Cognition|cognitive]] and professional dimensions of nineteen century's [[psychiatry]].&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''Institute of Nuclear Medicine &amp; Allied Sciences''' ('''INMAS''') is a laboratory of the [[Defence Research and Development Organisation]] (DRDO). Located in [[New Delhi]], it is involved in [[Nuclear medicine]] research and responding to nuclear accidents and explosions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Quick response team to handle nuke blast |author= |url=http://news.outlookindia.com/items.aspx?artid=262315|newspaper=[[Outlook (magazine)|Outlook]] |date= 18 November 2004|accessdate=16 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs/INMAS/English/index.jsp?pg=HistoricalBG.jsp|Historical Background]&lt;/ref&gt; The department of nuclear medicine under the institute offers a two-year diploma in radiation medicine since 1968, making it the first formal training program in nuclear medicine in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://drdo.gov.in/drdo/labs/INMAS/English/activities.pdf Major activities of Department  ]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The origin of the institute can be traced back to the establishment of a Radiation Cell in 1956 at Defence Science Laboratory, Delhi. The initial assignment was to undertake a study on the consequences of the use of nuclear and other weapons of mass destruction. The cell was later upgraded to Radiation Medicine Division in 1959 and to the Institute of Nuclear Medicine and Allied Sciences in 1961.

'''Jens Bang's House''' ({{lang-da| Jens Bangs Stenhus}}; translated, "Jens Bang's Stone House") is a landmark in [[Aalborg]], Denmark.  Situated on Østerågade in Nytorv square, it was built in 1624 by [[Jens Bang]] in [[Renaissance in the Low Countries|Dutch Renaissance]] style. Noted for its gables and sculpted [[auricular style|auricular]] window décor, it is said to be the finest privately owned Renaissance building in the country. It also features [[gargoyle]]s and a sculpture of Bang's face, tongue sticking out.&lt;ref name="Fodor's2006"&gt;{{cite book|author=Fodor's|title=Fodor's Scandinavia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZFMleoDWE5UC&amp;pg=PA147|year=2006|publisher=Fodor's|isbn=978-1-4000-1642-6|pages=147–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The five-storey building has housed the city's oldest pharmacy for more than 300 years.&lt;ref name=danskarkitekturguide.dk&gt;{{cite web|title=Jens Bangs Stenhus|url=http://www.danskarkitekturguide.dk/node/1248|publisher=Dansk arkitektur guide|accessdate=31 August 2013|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is privately owned.&lt;ref name=Miller2010&gt;{{cite news|last=Miller|first=Norman|title=Great Dane: a cultural tour of Aalborg|url=https://www.theguardian.com/travel/2010/sep/11/aalborg-denmark-city-break|accessdate=31 August 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=September 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
Jens Bang, remembered as one of Denmark's richest citizens, was born in [[Horsens]]. The son of Sidsel Jørgensdatter by her second marriage to Oluf Bang, he was consequently the half-brother of Aalborg's mayor, Jørgen Olufsen, who had already built a [[Jørgen Olufsen's House|mansion]] higher up the Østerå street. After arriving in Aalborg in 1600, Bang joined the city's merchant-trade guild ''Guds Legems Lav''. Five years later, he obtained the status of a licensed merchant. Over the next 20 years, he was so fortunate and successful in his business, that he became one of the country's leading traders and certainly the most prosperous merchant in Aalborg. Surprisingly, Bang never assumed any responsibilities in the city's administration, possibly because he was not keen to do so but more probably aggressive attitude prevented him from doing so. He was an unparalleled facilitator, disliked by his contemporaries to the point of being involved in physical fights. On the more positive side, in 1637, together with his wife, he founded an establishment with accommodation for 26 paupers. In 1623, Bang inherited ''Københavns gård'', a large old Aalborg property, on the corner of Østerå and Adelsgade. After demolishing most of the old buildings, he built an enormous residence, completing it the following year.&lt;ref name="Tönnesen1979"&gt;{{cite book|first=Allan |last=Tönnesen|title=233 danske borgerhuse|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=69AGAAAAMAAJ|year=1979|publisher=Gyldendal|isbn=978-87-01-54131-2|pages=201–|language=Danish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Architecture ==
The house is said to be Denmark's finest independently owned Renaissance mansion, comparable only to Mattias Hansen's House on [[Amagertorv]] in Copenhagen. The latter has only three floors and two gables while Jens Bang's House has four main floors and three gables, also containing floorspace and rooms. The house is decorated with sculptured stonework of the same high quality as [[Christian IV of Denmark|Christian IV]]'s own buildings. No doubt as a result of Bang's excellent relationship with the king, he was able to call upon the finest designers and craftsmen of the times, possibly employing [[Hans van Steenwinckel the Younger]] as his architect. [[Jørgen Olufsen's House]] on the same street hardly bears comparison.&lt;ref name="Tönnesen1979"/&gt;

The house originally had five round-arched doorways, probably topped by some of the sculpted figures and gargoyles which now crown the windows. The ground floor was used for trading booths and warehousing. In addition to the residential rooms on the first floor, there were also warehouses in the building. Bang's own rooms on the first floor were lit by a row of enormous windows with sandstone frames, some single, some double without any regularity. Their round-arches are decorated with angels and gargoyles in the [[auricular style|auricular]] Baroque style.&lt;ref name="Tönnesen1979"/&gt;

The protruding bay at the centre of the façade was certainly once the main entrance, located on the first floor with a flight of steps leading up from the street. With its intricately sculpted figures and decorations, the portal is a true masterpiece.  It clearly displays the year 1623 but the plaque at the top, where the original owner once had his name, now bears the mirrored monograms of the pharmacist C.L. Rübner and his wife. The crest with the [[Christian VI of Denmark|Christian VI]]'s monogram, flanked by swans, must once have displayed that of Christian IV. On the third floor, which also contained living accommodation, the windows are smaller and more simply decorated. The fourth floor has double, round-arched window frames, topped by a cornice with ornamental strips and spires. In the centre, there is a large hatch, probably added later. Together with the loft, the floor was previously used as a warehouse. The three tall pointed gables are decorated with the finest Baroque ornaments of the period, reflecting the very best examples of Dutch design.&lt;ref name="Tönnesen1979"/&gt;

== Additions and alterations ==

The half-timbered bay with its fine [[Shake (shingle)|shingle]] spire and its figure of [[Fortuna]] dates from around 1700. There were a number of other alterations around 1712: in addition to modifications to the main entrance and adjacent windows, finely plastered Baroque ceilings were added to two of the first-floor rooms, probably at the initiative of Johannes-Friedenreich. For a time, the top of the south gable was replaced by a [[hip roof]] but was reconstructed in 1916 during comprehensive restoration work under [[Harald Lønborg-Jensen]]. A stairway tower was built at the back of the house in 1897 to replace an inside spiral staircase. Among the property's additional buildings on Adelgade and Cortesgyde, one of the rooms in the south wing has a [[Gothic architecture|Late Gothic]] vaulted ceiling which has survived from ''Københavns gård''.&lt;ref name="Tönnesen1979"/&gt;

== Ownership ==
[[File:Jens Bangs Stenhus i Aalborg.JPG|thumbnail|An 1890 street view of front facade and neighboring buildings.]]
During the [[Thirty Years' War]], the house was occupied by the Germans from 1627 to 1629 while Jens Bang fled to [[Marstrand]] awaiting their departure. Bang died in 1644 during the [[Torstenson War]] when Aalborg was once again occupied. This time the troops left his house in a sorry state. As Bang had no direct descendants, ownership of the house was divided between a number of inheritors until in 1671, the pharmacist Johannes Friederich bought the buildings and opened his ''Swaneapotek'' (Swan Pharmacy) there. The pharmacy has existed ever since and the building has been handed down from generation to generation, the Strøybergs inheriting it in 1829.&lt;ref name="Tönnesen1979"/&gt;

The building is owned by the fund "Apoteker S.C. Strøybergs Fond til Bevarelse af Jens Bangs Stenhus".&lt;ref name=HMNJ/&gt;

== Apotekersamlingen ==
The ''Svaneapotek'' (Swan Pharmacy) collection is now housed in one of the upper rooms, as a small pharmacy museum known as Apotekersamlingen. In premises open to visitors, the shelves display fine old receptacles and equipment including a container used to mix 70 ingredients to make ''[[Theriac|theriaken]]'' which was said to have been effective in strengthening the weak. Jars of herbs and medicines as well as tools for the production of pills can be seen, providing evidence of the pharmacy's history over the past 300 years. Initially the pharmacy was also a grocery shop, licensed to sell spirits, wine, chocolate and [[licorice]], which was also used for medicinal purposes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitaalborg.dk/danmark/history/apotekersamlingen-i-jens-bangs-stenhus "Besøg Aalborgs stemningsfulde Apotekersamling helt oppe under taget i det flotte renæssancehus og hør historien om livet i stenhuset og på Svaneapoteket igennem mere end 350 år"], VisitAalborg. {{da icon}} Retrieved 7 September 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apotekersamlingen is administered by [[The Historical Museum of Northern Jutland]], but owned by the same fund that owns the building.&lt;ref name=HMNJ&gt;[http://www.nordmus.dk/apotekersamling-gb Apotekersamlingen] The Historical Museum of Northern Jutland&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Keep Our NHS Public''' ('''KONP''') is a campaigning organisation, with local groups across England, committed to reversing the [[National Health Service#Outsourcing and privatisation|ongoing privatisation]] of the [[NHS]] and its services.

==History==

The group was founded in 2005 by the [[NHS Consultants Association]], the [[NHS Support Federation]] and [[Health Emergency]]. It was very active in the campaign against the [[Health and Social Care Act 2012]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=February 17, 2011 KONP at the BMA|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/links/campaigns/konp-bma/|publisher=Socialist Health Association|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It has local groups which are involved in campaigns against the closure or reorganisation of local hospitals, such as the Save Lewisham Hospital Campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What You can do|url=http://www.lewishamkonp.org/action|publisher=Lewisham Keep Our NHS Public|accessdate=4 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It attracted support from many existing health related campaigns such as Save Finsbury Health Centre&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SaveFHC to continue campaigning|url=http://savefinsburyhealthcentre.wordpress.com/2011/02/16/savefhc-to-continue-campaigning/|publisher=Save Finsbury Health Centre|accessdate=4 January 2014|date=February 16, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It has been very vocal in denouncing the use of private health providers  to treat patients outside the health service.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Half of £2bn NHS cash injection spent on outsourced private care providers labelled a 'disgrace'|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/politics/nhs-cash-injection-2-billion-spent-outsourcing-private-care-providers-disgrace-healthcare-service-a7651531.html|accessdate=31 March 2017|publisher=Independent|date=27 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership Campaign==
In early 2013 the American and EU governments began negotiating an agreement on free-trade between nations known as the [[Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership]] (TTIP). KONP have since committed an ongoing effort to prevent the partnership and its provisions from leading to the increased marketisation of European healthcare systems, allowing the entrenching of privatised healthcare in the British NHS. KONP have established concerns with regards to the extent of deregulation on transnational companies, allowing them to sue national governments in certain situations.

The Organisation Listed '''Four''' key recommendations regarding the TTIP:
#	Health and social care services should be completely exempted from the TTIP Treaty in a clear and watertight manner.
#	The current ISDS should be removed from the TTIP Treaty and replaced by a state to state disputes resolution procedure, which prevents direct legal challenges by investors on commercial grounds.
#	EU labour and medical and professional training and qualifications standards must be specifically protected under the TTIP Treaty.
#	Without the broad exemption of health and social care and the removal of ISDS from the Treaty, the entire Treaty must be rejected.

The '''Lac de Vouglans''' is the reservoir of the [[Hydroelectricity|hydro-electric]] [[power station]] at Vouglans on the [[Ain River|River Ain]] in the [[Département in France|département]] of [[Jura (département)|Jura]] in the [[Regions of France|region]] of [[Franche-Comté]] in eastern France. The [[dam]], the Barrage de Vouglans is at [[Geographic coordinate system|coordinates]] {{coord|46|23|51|N|5|39|56|E|type:landmark_region:FR|name=Barrage de Vouglans}}.

==Description==
The lake lies on [[Jurassic]] rock crushed into north to south ridges by the [[Alpine orogeny]]. It is therefore long and narrow, though rather sinuous in plan. It is about 30 kilometres long though only 21&amp;nbsp;km in a straight line. It lies in the valley of the Ain, impounded by the dam at [[Cernon, Jura|Cernon]]. The old village of Vouglans was displaced by its construction in 1968 by [[Électricité de France]] (EDF).

Some buildings of the [[Carthusian]] [[monastery]] of Vaucluse were also moved to make way for the rising waters and to save them from demolition.

The lake is arranged for tourism with view-points scattered through the woods which cover the hillsides along its shores and places set up for bathing and boating.

The annual mean flow of water at the dam is 40.80 cubic metres per second.

==Statistics==
* Width: 300 to 800 m (330 to 870 yd)
* Capacity: 605,000,000 m³ (2,137 million ft³)
* Mean annual flow: 40.80 m³/s (1,441&amp;nbsp;ft³/s)

== History ==
After a recommendation from the Health Services Restructuring Commission in 1998, the Ontario government amalgamated four Durham area hospitals: [[Memorial Hospital Bowmanville]], North Durham Health Services (consisting of [[Community Memorial Hospital Port Perry]] and [[Uxbridge Cottage Hospital]]), [[Oshawa General Hospital]] and [[Whitby General Hospital]] – to create what is now known as Lakeridge Health. In January 2004, the [[Uxbridge]] site became aligned with [[Markham Stouffville Hospital]] and left the Lakeridge grouping.

With the merger of [[Rouge Valley Health System]] and [[The Scarborough Hospital]], management of the [[Rouge Valley Ajax and Pickering]] site was transferred to Lakeridge Health on December 1, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/6813374-ajax-pickering-hospital-lakeridge-health-merger-to-cost-18-8-million-save-300-000-annually/|title=Ajax-Pickering hospital Lakeridge Health merger|last=|first=|date=|website=Durhamregion.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chief Executive Officer is Matthew Anderson.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/6955000-new-lakeridge-health-ceo-matthew-anderson-officially-on-the-job/|title=New Lakeridge Health CEO officially on the job|last=|first=|date=|website=Durhamregion.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 13, 2017, Lakeridge Health was attacked by the [[WannaCry ransomware attack]] among many other institutions around the globe. By afternoon, most areas were up and running again.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/canada/2017/05/13/ontario-health-ministry-on-high-alert-amid-global-cyberattack.html|title=Ontario health ministry on high alert amid global cyberattack {{!}} Toronto Star|website=thestar.com|access-date=2017-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 26, 2018, Lakeridge Health launched an online platform MyChart for patients to manage their health information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.durhamregion.com/news-story/8569770-lakeridge-health-launches-website-feature-allowing-patients-to-manage-their-health-information/|title=Lakeridge Health launches website feature allowing patients to manage their health information|last=Fillatrau|first=Shana|date=2018-04-26|work=DurhamRegion.com|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Services==
Lakeridge Health offers primary, secondary, tertiary and post-acute care in inpatient and ambulatory settings. Services differ at the acute hospital sites, from the predominantly General Practitioner (GP)-
based services at Lakeridge Health Port Perry to the very high acuity services provided at Lakeridge Health Oshawa by physician specialists and interprofessional teams.

Services provided across Lakeridge Health are organized into eight clinical programs:
*Emergency and Critical Care
*Maternal Child
*Medicine
*Addictions &amp; Mental Health
*Post-Acute Specialty Services (PASS)
*Regional Cancer Services
*Regional Nephrology System/Durham Region Diabetes Network
*Surgery

'''Lightning injuries''' are [[injury|injuries]] caused by [[lightning strike]]s.

They result from three factors: 
* electrical damage.
* intense heat.
* the mechanical energy which these generate. 
While sudden death is common because of the huge voltage of a lightning strike, survivors often fare better than victims of other electrical injuries caused by a more prolonged application of lesser voltage.&lt;ref name = match2heart&gt;{{cite book | author=[[Gretel Ehrlich]] | title= A match to the heart | publisher=Penguin Books | year=1994 | isbn = 0-14-017937-2}} The author tells of her slow recovery after being struck by lightning.&lt;/ref&gt;

The treatment of lightning injuries is '''keraunomedicine'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jolr.org/Editors/Adrews.html Chris Andrews - JOLR&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929081519/http://www.jolr.org/Editors/Adrews.html |date=2007-09-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews, C. J., 1995: Keraunomedicine: A discipline come of age. [[Annals of Emergency Medicine]], 25, 543-545. This is possibly the first use of the term.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cause==
Lightning can strike or injure humans in four different ways:
* Direct strike
* 'Splash' from nearby objects struck
* Ground strike near the person causing a difference of potential in the ground itself (due to resistance to current in the Earth), amounting to several thousand volts per foot, depending upon the composition of the earth that makes up the ground at that location (sand being a fair insulator and wet, salty and spongy earth being more conductive).
* [[Electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] or electromagnetic pulse from close strikes – especially during positive lightning discharges

In a ''direct hit'', the [[electrical charge]] strikes the person first.
''Splash'' hits occur when lightning jumps to a person (lower resistance path) from a nearby object that has more resistance, striking the person on its way to the ground.
In ''ground'' strikes, the bolt lands near the person and is conducted by a connection to the ground (usually the feet), due to the voltage gradient in the earth. This can still cause substantial injury.

==Health effects==
===Electricity===
Counterintuitively, lightning current flowing through the victim's body [[electrical resistance|resistance]] may develop a high voltage sufficient to ''flash'' around the skin or clothing to the ground in a ''direct strike'', resulting in a surprisingly benign outcome.

The lightning often leaves skin burns in characteristic [[Lichtenberg figure]]s, sometimes called ''lightning flowers''; they may persist for hours or days, and are a useful indicator for medical examiners when trying to determine the cause of death. They are thought to be caused by the rupture of small [[capillaries]] under the skin, either from the lightning current or from the mechanical [[shock wave]].  The intense electric current can cause a loss of consciousness; it is also speculated that the [[electromagnetic pulse|EMP]] created by a nearby lightning strike can cause [[cardiac arrest]].

===Heat===
A bolt of lightning can reach [[temperature]]s approaching 28,000° Celsius (50,000° Fahrenheit) in a split second. This is about five times hotter than the surface of the [[sun]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov/planetary/factsheet/sunfact.html|title=Sun Fact Sheet|website=nssdc.gsfc.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-07-26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Spectacular and unconventional lightning damage can be caused by thermal effects of lightning. ''Hot lightning'' (high-current lightning) which lasts for more than a second can deposit immense energy, melting or [[carbonization|carbonizing]] large objects. One such example is the destruction of the basement [[Electrical insulation|insulator]] of the {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} high central [[radio mast|mast]] of the [[Orlunda radio transmitter]], which led to its collapse.  The intense heat generated by a lightning strike can burn tissue, and cause lung damage, and the chest can be damaged by the mechanical force of rapidly expanding heated air.

===Concussive injury===
Just as heat can cause expanding air in the lungs, the explosive [[shock wave]] created by lightning (the cause of thunder) can cause concussive and auditory injury at extremely close range. Other physical injury can be caused by objects damaged or thrown by the lightning strike. For example, lightning striking a nearby tree may vaporize sap, and the steam explosion often causes bark and wood fragments to be explosively ejected.

==Treatment==
Reported mortality rates range from 10–30 percent, depending on the source of data. Most people who are struck by lightning live to tell the story, but many suffer from long term injury or disability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Jedick|first=Rocky|title=Flight Surgeon Busts Lightning Myths|url=http://www.afms.af.mil/news/story.asp?id=123316472|publisher=AFMS|accessdate=6 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Immediate===
[[File:CPR-oxygen-defibrillator.jpg|thumb|Typical view of defibrillation in progress, with the operator at the head, but clear of contact with the patient]]
The most critical injuries are to the [[circulatory system]], the [[lung]]s, and the [[central nervous system]] but injuries also occur to other body systems. Some victims suffer immediate [[cardiac arrest]] and will not survive without prompt emergency care.&lt;ref name="Mallinson 2010 15–16"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Mallinson | first=T | title=Lightning Injuries| journal=Focus on First Aid | volume= | issue=16 | pages=15–16 | year=2010 | pmid= | url=http://www.focusonfirstaid.co.uk/Magazine/issue16/index.aspx | accessdate=2010-09-30 | doi= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311015741/http://www.focusonfirstaid.co.uk/Magazine/issue16/index.aspx|archivedate=11 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is safe to administer care immediately, because the victim will not retain any [[electrical charge]] after the lightning has struck (of course, the rescuer could be struck by a separate bolt of lightning). Other victims may suffer [[myocardial infarction]]{{cn|date=July 2017}} and various [[cardiac arrhythmias]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}, most of which can be rapidly fatal as well.  Loss of consciousness is very common immediately after a strike.&lt;ref name="Mallinson 2010 15–16"/&gt; [[Amnesia]] and [[confusion]] of varying duration often result as well.&lt;ref name="Mallinson 2010 15–16"/&gt;

Experiments on sheep show that a lightning strike to the head of a victim enters through the eyes, ears, nose and mouth, converging at the [[brainstem]], which controls breathing. Many unconscious victims, who appear lifeless, actually die of suffocation{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}. Chances of survival may be increased if [[cardiopulmonary resuscitation]] (CPR) is started immediately, and continued without interruption until the brainstem recovers.&lt;ref&gt;Dayton, L (1993). [https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg14019042.700 "Science: Secrets of a bolt from the blue"], New Scientist, 18 December 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Long-term===
A complete physical examination by paramedics or physicians may reveal [[ruptured eardrum]]s. Ocular [[cataract]]s may later develop, sometimes more than a year after an otherwise uneventful recovery.  Long-term injuries are usually neurological in nature, including [[memory deficit]], [[sleep disturbance]], [[chronic pain]], and chronic [[dizziness]].&lt;ref name="lightningsafe"&gt;[[NOAA]] [https://web.archive.org/web/20070705032958/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/resources/Ltg%20Safety-Facts.pdf Lightning Safety Facts]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bihéron was the daughter of a French [[apothecary]], born in 1719.&lt;ref name="schiebinger"&gt;Londa L. Schiebinger (1991), ''The Mind Has No Sex? Women in the Origins of Modern Science'', pp.27-30.&lt;/ref&gt;  She studied illustration at the [[Jardin du Roi]]&lt;ref name="cunningham"&gt;Andrew Cunningham, ''The Anatomist Anatomis'd: An Experimental Discipline in Enlightenment Europe'', Ashgate Publishing, 2010, p.&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Madeleine Basseporte]], of whom little is known outside of her anatomical drawings, and the memoirs of contemporaries.&lt;ref name="schiebinger" /&gt;

To procure bodies for her anatomical studies, Bihéron was forced to have them stolen from the military.&lt;ref&gt;Louis Prudhomme, 1830s, cited by Schiebinger, p.28.&lt;/ref&gt; Frustrated with their rapid putrefaction,&lt;ref name="stanley"&gt;Autumn Stanley, ''Mothers and Daughters of Invention: Notes for Revised History of Technology'', Rutgers University Press, 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; and at the suggestion of Basseporte, Bihéron turned her skills towards [[anatomical wax model]]ing, becoming a leading and highly recognized practitioner of this art.&lt;ref name="schiebinger" /&gt; The famous physician [[Villoisin]] and the scholar [[Antoine Laurent de Jussieu|Jussieu]] were impressed, and both promoted her work.&lt;ref name="stanley" /&gt; In 1759, [[Jean Morand]] invited her to present her work to the [[Academie Royale des Sciences]].&lt;ref name="schiebinger" /&gt; She was invited again in 1770, to demonstrate an innovative, very detailed and lifelike model of a pregnant woman, complete with moveable parts and fetuses.&lt;ref name="schiebinger" /&gt; In 1771 she presented to the Academie Royale for the third time, this time presenting her models to the visiting crown prince of Sweden, [[Gustav III of Sweden|Gustavus of Sweden]].&lt;ref name="stanley" /&gt;&lt;ref name="burton"&gt;June K. Burton (2007), ''Napoleon and the Woman Question: Discourses of the Other Sex in French Education, Medicine, and Medical Law, 1799-1815'', Texas Tech University Press (2007), pp.81-82.&lt;/ref&gt;

Her models achieved international renown, both because of their great anatomical accuracy and lifelikeness, and because she apparently had a method of making wax models that did not melt.  [[Jakob Jonas Björnståhl]] wrote to [[Carl Linnaeus]], that: 
: Björnståhl has witnessed an anatomical miracle. Marie Catherine Biheron[+] makes models of parts of the body that are absolutely lifelike. And they do not break. She does not reveal what material they are made of, although it seems as if they were made of wax mixed with something. All parts are correctly named in Latin and Greek. She has studied this art for more than 20 years. The King of Denmark [[Christian VII]] is one of her customers. She sends her respects to Linnaeus.&lt;ref&gt;[http://linnaeus.c18.net/Letters/display_sum.php?id_letter=L4163&amp;person_from=Jacob%20Jonas%20Bj%F6rnst%E5hl&amp;person_to=Carl%20Linnaeus&amp;date=15%20April%201769 Letter written April 15, 1769], by [[Jacob Jonas Björnståhl]], to [[Carl Linnaeus]].&lt;/ref&gt;

Because the Academie did not support women, Bihéron had to earn a living privately, by exhibiting and selling her models, as well as by teaching.&lt;ref name="schiebinger" /&gt;  She moved to England, because women were not permitted to teach anatomy in France.&lt;ref name="burton" /&gt;  Among her students was [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]], a Scottish doctor who greatly advanced the field of surgery &amp;mdash; Bihéron's anatomical lessons were critical to his study, and some of the illustrations in his book were likely Bihéron's.&lt;ref name="burton" /&gt; [[Diderot]] was also apparently one of her anatomy students.&lt;ref name="cunningham" /&gt;

Bihéron also earned money by selling her models. The King of Denmark was one customer, and [[Empress Catherine II of Russia]] another; the latter purchasing Bihéron's complete set of anatomical models.&lt;ref name="burton" /&gt; Exhibitions included a 1761 exhibition, advertised by her pamphlet "Artificial Anatomy", proposing to show the body in "greatest precision", including internal organs, which could be manipulated—Bihéron permitted viewing at her home on the Vieille Estrapade near the Rue des Poules, beginning on 13 May 1761, and continued for some time.&lt;ref name="cunningham" /&gt;

'''''Mrs Dale's Diary'''''  was the first significant [[BBC]] [[radio]] serial drama.  It was first broadcast on 5 January 1948 on the [[BBC Light Programme]], which became [[BBC Radio 2|Radio 2]] in 1967; it ran until 25 April 1969.  A new episode was broadcast each weekday afternoon, with a repeat the following morning.  A few days after the final episode, a new serial drama, ''[[Waggoners' Walk]]'', took over the time slot.

The main scriptwriter for many years was Jonquil Antony, and her first collaborator (under a pseudonym)
was [[Ted Willis, Baron Willis|Ted Willis]], later to originate equally well-known characters for ''[[Dixon of Dock Green]]''.

The lead character, Mrs Dale, was played by Ellis Powell until she was sacked in controversial circumstances in 1963 and replaced by [[Jessie Matthews]]. 

== Format ==
An innovative characteristic of the programme was that a brief introductory narrative in each episode was spoken by Mrs Dale as if she were writing her diary.

The serial centred on Mrs Mary Dale, a [[General Practitioner|doctor]]'s wife, husband Jim, and the comings and goings of a [[middle class]] society. The Dales lived at Virginia Lodge in the fictional [[London]] [[Metro-land]]-style suburb of Parkwood Hill. They had moved there from the real area of [[Kenton, London|Kenton]], which straddles the border between the London boroughs of [[London Borough of Brent|Brent]] and [[London Borough of Harrow|Harrow]]. Later in the series, to modernise the programme and its setting, the producers relocated the family in the fictional [[new town]] of Exton New Town.

Mrs Dale's mother was Mrs Freeman, whom Jim always called, rather gravely, "mother-in-law". The family had one daughter, Gwen, and a son, Bob. Bob, who worked in the [[Automobile|motor]] trade, was married to Jenny; they had twins. Gwen was widowed after her husband David was killed in a water-skiing accident in the [[Bahamas]] where he was holidaying with his rich mistress. Mary Dale's sister Sally (which she always pronounced "Selly") lived in Chelsea and moved in exotic circles. The Dales and their friends (and Captain, Mrs Freeman's cat, apparently named after her late husband's rank when he fell in the First World War) got along in almost perfect harmony. It was all respectable, comfortable and middle-class.

==Treatment of homosexuality==

The programme is thought to be the first British mainstream drama which depicted a character known to be [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] sympathetically in a leading part &amp;ndash; Sally's husband. It was a brave move to feature a gay man, especially when homosexuality was still illegal in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whirligig-tv.co.uk/radio/mrsdalesdiary.htm|title=Mrs. Dale's Diary|accessdate=11 February 2010 |quote=I do remember Mrs. Dale's brother-in-law confiding in her that he was homosexual (shriek);}}&lt;/ref&gt; Clearly the programme's makers considered the time was right for the subject to be featured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/15995/radio-light-programme|title=Radio - Light programme|last=Smurthwaite|first=Nick|date=19 February 2007|publisher=[[The Stage]]|accessdate=11 February 2010|quote=In The Archive Hour’s Out on Air, Richard Cole traced the history of homosexuality on BBC radio, from the love-that-dare-not-speak-its-name days of Mrs Dale’s Diary in the 1950s to Radio 1’s Loud and Proud.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090108113723/http://www.thestage.co.uk/features/feature.php/15995/radio-light-programme|archivedate=8 January 2009|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richard Fulton, however, was an odd character to use, in several ways. Not least is that (though apparently based on the homosexual writer [[Patrick White]]) Richard's history in the serial was heterosexual. He was in fact a character who had developed a lot, having been presented in the early days as  a monster of petulance.

== Changes to the format ==
In February 1962, the serial was renamed '''''The Dales'''''.  The linking narratives by Mrs Dale were dropped. The reason was that the BBC was conscious that the series was considered by the media to be twee and hopelessly old fashioned. The changes included a new theme tune composed by [[Ron Grainer]], composer of the futuristic theme tune for ''[[Doctor Who]]''.  "[[Dance in the Twilight]]" from [[Eric Coates]]' ''[[Springtime Suite]]'' also served as a signature tune for a time.

In 1975 Matthews' biographer, Michael Thornton, wrote: &lt;blockquote&gt;On 19 February 1963, a plump and embittered fifty-six-year-old character actress called Ellis Powell walked out of Broadcasting House for the last time. She was not a star. In fact she had earned less than £30 a week. But her voice was as well known in Britain as that of Queen Elizabeth II, for it was heard twice a day by seven million devoted listeners. Miss Powell was Britain's most sacrosanct fictional paragon, Mrs. Dale, in the radio serial Mrs. Dale's Diary. And now, after fifteen years in the role she had created, the BBC had summarily fired her partly because of her drinking habits, and partly because it was felt that the role, and also the entire programme, was in need of a facelift. Three months later, at the age of fifty-seven, she died. Her friends believed she never recovered from the shock and distress of her summary dismissal by the BBC. In the last weeks of her life she worked as a demonstrator at the [[Ideal Home Exhibition]] and as a cleaner in an hotel.&lt;ref&gt;''Jessie Matthews: A Biography'', Michael Thornton, Published: 15 May 1975 Accessed 25 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==''The Dales''==
In its last years, ''The Dales'' became more sensational. Mrs Dale became a councillor, a position she had to relinquish when she caused a man's death by careless driving. A heart attack forced Dr Dale to retire from practice. Perhaps the most famous storyline was Jenny getting measles; listeners wrote in thousands complaining that she had already had measles in 1949.

When it became ''The Dales'', the show did try to copy ''[[The Archers]]'', which was originally a medium to disseminate information to the agricultural community, and to give an insight into rural affairs to the public. Thus medical stories became the order in ''The Dales''.  In this manner, ''The Dales'' became in the mid-1960s much like the [[BBC One]] soap opera ''[[Doctors (BBC Soap Opera)|Doctors]]'', the plots revolving around medical conditions and problems. When the series ran a story about the importance of women having regular [[Cervical cancer|cervical]] [[Pap smear|smear tests]] and checking their [[breast]]s for [[Breast cancer|lumps]], the junior health minister praised the programme, saying it had encouraged thousands of women to see their doctor.

The serial ran for 5,531 episodes, culminating with the engagement of Mrs Dale's daughter Gwen to a famous TV professor on 25 April 1969. On news of its demise, Liberal MP [[Peter Bessell]] attempted to introduce a reprieve for the series in Parliament. The [[BBC Sound Archive]] holds only five complete episodes of ''Mrs Dale's Diary'', and seven complete episodes of ''The Dales''.{{citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Spin-offs==
Over the years it ran there were a number of books written around the characters, several authored in whole or part by Jonquil Antony, the most important scriptwriter at the beginning and for many years. In 1970, the year after the programme finished, she took back her former characters after a fashion, publishing ''Dear Dr Dale'', a novel set after the end of the serial.

In the same year Charles Simon, who had played Dr Dale in the Jessie Matthews years, did his own continuation of the story, going on tour in ''At Home With The Dales''. This show has its place in theatre history as the first professional venture of [[Cameron Mackintosh]], later renowned for large-scale musicals. The Dales play was written by Charles Henry, who was soon discovered to be the versatile and experienced Charles Simon. Later dates in the tour were cancelled because the audience did not seem to be there. "It would have been different if Jessie had done the tour", Charles Simon remarked to another actor a few months later. But he was the only member of the radio cast to make the transition.

The play was published, but has seldom been revived. In 1972 it received an amateur production at Rugby Theatre with Bridget Watson as Mrs Dale and Harry Roberts as her husband the doctor. The only professional revival seems to have been in 1997 at the Kenneth More Studio Theatre in Ilford, when Angela Ellis and Roger Braban played the senior Dales.

==Catchphrase==

The phrase seized on by caricaturists as typical of Mrs Dale's narrative was "I'm rather worried about Jim..."  Indeed, the phrase was a staple of many comedy programmes, radio and television, in the early 1960s aiming to poke fun at safe, staid and undemanding middle-class lifestyles. The last episode ended with Mrs Dale saying, "There's one thing that won't change - I shall always worry about Jim..."

== Parodies ==

===Mrs Wilson's Diary===
{{main|Mrs Wilson's Diary}}

Mrs Dale's Diary was the basis of ''[[Mrs Wilson's Diary]]'' in the fortnightly [[satire|satirical]] [[magazine]] ''[[Private Eye]]''. The writers (primarily [[John Wells (satirist)|John Wells]]) presented Mrs Wilson as seeing herself as comfortably middle class, in contrast to the working class pretensions (and middle class actuality) of her husband, for example the [[Wincarnis]] (a brand of tonic wine) and the [[worsted]] suits with two pairs of trousers ([[Harold Wilson|Wilson]] was from [[Huddersfield]], a town famous for the manufacture of worsted cloth).

===Goon Show===

The show was mentioned in the following episodes of ''[[The Goon Show]]'':
* In an untitled episode (s02 e01 - 22 January 1952), listeners are given an example of how ''Mrs Dale's Diary'' would sound as produced by Americans.  It includes over-hyped music, multiple in-show advertisements for bizarrely named products, and ends with several murders.
* In ''The Man Who Tried To Destroy London's Monuments'', (s04 ep02 - 9 October 1953), Eccles regains consciousness and is told he is in Mrs Dale's Diary.
* ''Nineteen Eighty-Five'', (s05 ep15 - 5 January 1955),  in which mention is made of ''Mrs Dale's Real Diary'':

:''Seagoon'':  I want to read it. What's it called?
:''Bluebottle'': It's called Mrs Dale's Real Diary.
:''Seagoon'': Mrs Dale's...?? Heavens -- would the BBC stop at nothing? So this was how they kept the masses from thinking.
:''Bluebottle'': Eheehee! Look at this page! Eheehee! It's a Three-D picture of Mrs Dale in her nightshirt being chased by [[Richard Dimbleby]]... Eheehee! Eheeheehee! Eheeheeoooooughhhh... pauses to wipe drool off chin.

It was also one of the recordings used for torture in the BBC Listening Room, that episode's parody of [[Room 101]].

* ''The History of Pliny the Elder'' (s07 ep25 - 28 March 1957):

:''Seagoon'':  Fear not! We shall fight them up hill and down Mrs Dale!

===Round The Horne===

* The programme was often a 'target' (albeit an affectionate one) on the BBC Radio comedy ''[[Round The Horne]]'', referred to as "''Mrs Dire's Dreary''" with the part of Mrs Dire being played by [[Kenneth Williams]]

'''Nathaniel Edward Yorke-Davies''' (1841–1914) was a British surgeon and consulting physician in dietetics only.&lt;ref name=WhoWho&gt;{{cite journal|title=Yorke-Davies, N.E.|journal=Who's Who|year=1913|page= 2218|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uc1.b3453201;view=1up;seq=2250}}&lt;/ref&gt; His most famous patient was [[William Howard Taft]].&lt;ref name=Bivins&amp;Marland&gt;{{cite journal|author=Bivins, Roberta|author2=Marland, Hilary|title=Weighting for Health: Management, Measurement and Self-surveillance in the Modern Household|journal=Social History of Medicine|volume=29|issue=4|year=2016|pages=757–780|doi=10.1093/shm/hkw015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yorke-Davies, whose father was headmaster at [[Ysgol Dyffryn Conwy|Llanrwst Grammar School]],&lt;ref name=WhoWho/&gt; was educated at [[Cheltenham College]] and other schools before entering [[St Bartholomew's Hospital]]. He qualified L.S.A. in 1865, L.M. Dub. in 1865, M.R.C.S. Eng. in 1866, and L.R.C.P Lond. in 1871. After a brief period of service in the Egyptian navy, he became a specialist in dietetics; he gained an international reputation in that speciality as an author of several books and numerous articles in medical and popular journals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=Plarr, Victor|title= Men and Women of the Time: A Dictionary of Contemporaries|edition= 15th|year=1899|location=London|publisher=George Routledge &amp; Sons|chapter=Yorke-Davies, Nathaniel Edwards|page=1203|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CPcMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA1203}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His 1889 book ''Foods for the Fat: A Treatise on Corpulency'' urged overweight people to a consult a physician, who would provide psychological support and an individualised plan for diet and exercise. His book criticised [[William Banting|Banting]]'s dietary plan for its extreme severity and [[Wilhelm Ebstein|Ebstein]]'s dietary plan for recommending too much fat. The book remained popular for many years; the 17th edition appeared in 1906 and sold 35,000 copies.&lt;ref name=Bivins&amp;Marland/&gt;

{{blockquote|Yorke-Davies provided his readers with recipes and advice on food intake based on hospital dietaries and in relation to expenditure of effort in work and physical activity. Food was to be carefully weighed, and reports of successful weight loss indicated that his dieters, too, were regularly weighed recording their week-by-week weight reduction. ... aside from the patients who consulted him at his Harley Street practice, others lived abroad and treatment took place via correspondence.&lt;ref name=Bivins&amp;Marland/&gt;}}

Gluten and bran baked goods made using Dr. Yorke-Davies's recipes were sold for the treatment of obesity and diabetes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=advertisement for Blatchley's Celebrated Bread and Biscuits|journal=The Lancet General Advertiser, The Lancet|date=23 March 1914|page= 59|url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=uiug.30112114890830;view=1up;seq=1015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon his death he was survived by his widow, two sons, and a daughter.&lt;ref name=WhoWho/&gt;

[[File:MosesandSnake.JPG|thumb|Moses lifts up the brass snake, curing the Israelites of [[snakebite]]s. [[Hezekiah]] called the snake 'Nehushtan'.]]
In the biblical [[Books of Kings]] ({{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:4|HE}}), the '''Nehushtan''' (or '''Nohestan''') ([[Hebrew languages|Hebrew]]: נחושתן or נחש הנחושת) is the derogatory name given to the bronze serpent on a pole first described in the [[Book of Numbers]], which God told Moses to erect to so that the [[Israelites]] who saw it would be protected from dying from the bites of the "fiery serpents" which God had sent to punish them for speaking against God and Moses {{bibleref2|Numbers|21:4-9}}. In ''Kings'', King [[Hezekiah]] institutes an [[iconoclasm|iconoclastic]] reform that requires the destruction of "the brazen serpent that Moses had made; for unto those days the children of Israel did burn incense to it; and it was called Nehushtan". The term means "a brazen thing, a mere piece of brass".&lt;ref name=Easton&gt;[http://www.biblestudytools.com/dictionary/nehushtan/ M.G. Easton M.A., D.D., Illustrated Bible Dictionary, Third Edition, published by Thomas Nelson, 1897.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Alternate transliterations and translations==
The name is [[transliteration|transliterated]] as "Nohestan" in the [[Douay–Rheims Bible|Douay-Rheims]] 1899 American Edition,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+18%3A4&amp;version=DRA&lt;/ref&gt; as "N’chushtan" in the [[Complete Jewish Bible]] &lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+18%3A4&amp;version=CJB&lt;/ref&gt; and as "Nechushtan" in the [[Orthodox Jewish Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=2+Kings+18%3A4&amp;version=OJB&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[English Standard Version]] of the Bible and the majority of contemporary [[English translations of the bible|English translations]] refer to the serpent as made of 'bronze', whereas the [[King James Version]] and a number of other versions state 'brass'. The Douai-Rheims 1899 edition has 'brazen'. [[Eugene H. Peterson]], who created a loose paraphrase of the Bible as [[The Message (Bible)|The Message]] (2002), opted for 'a snake of fiery copper'.&lt;ref&gt;All translations of Numbers 21:9 taken from [[BibleGateway.com]] https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/Numbers%2021:9 accessed 15 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The reference in 2 Kings 18:4 is translated as 'brasen' in the King James Version.&lt;ref&gt;BibleGateway.com https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/2%20Kings%2018:4 accessed 15 September 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Michelangelo Buonarroti 024.jpg|thumb|250px|In 1508 [[Michelangelo]]'s image of the Israelites deliverance from the plague of serpents by the creation of the bronze serpent on the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]].]]
[[Snake worship|Snake cults]] had been well established in [[Canaan]] in the [[Bronze Age]]: archaeologists have uncovered serpent [[cult object]]s in Bronze Age strata at several pre-Israelite cities in Canaan: two at [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]],&lt;ref&gt;Gordon Loud, ''Megiddo II: Plates'' plate 240: 1, 4, from Stratum X (dated by Loud 1650-1550 BC) and Statum VIIB (dated 1250-1150 BC), noted by Joines 1968:245f.&lt;/ref&gt; one at [[Gezer]],&lt;ref&gt;R.A.S. Macalister, ''Gezer II'', p. 399, fig. 488, noted by Joiner 1968:245 note 3, from the high place area, dated Late Bronze Age.&lt;/ref&gt; one in the ''Kodesh Hakodashim'' ([[Holy of Holies]]) of the Area H temple at [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]],&lt;ref&gt;Yigael Yadin et al. ''Hazor III-IV: Plates'', pl. 339, 5, 6, dated Late Bronze Age II (Yadiin to Joiner, in Joiner 1968:245 note 4).&lt;/ref&gt; and two at [[Shechem]].&lt;ref&gt;Callaway and Toombs to Joiner (Joiner 1968:246 note 5).&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Lowell K. Handy, the Nehushtan may have been the symbol of a minor god of snakebite-cure within the Temple.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=bua2dMa9fJ4C&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+crisis+of+Israelite+religion:+transformation+of+religious+tradition&amp;source=gbs_similarbooks_s&amp;cad=1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Lowell K.

==In scripture==
===Hebrew Bible===
{{see also|Serpents in the Bible#Serpent of bronze}}
[[File:Tissot The Brazen Serpent.jpg|thumb|The Brazen Serpent (watercolor circa 1896–1902 by [[James Tissot]])]]
In the biblical story, following their [[The Exodus|Exodus]] from Egypt, the Israelites set out from [[Mount Hor]], where [[Aaron]] was buried, to go to the [[Red Sea]]. However they had to detour around the land of [[Edom]] (Numbers 20:21, 25). Frustrated and impatient, they complained against [[Yahweh]] and [[Moses]] (Num. 21:4-5), and in response God sent "[[Serpent (Bible)#Fiery serpents|fiery serpents]]" among them. For the sake of the ones who were repentant, Moses was instructed by God to erect a "serpent of [[bronze]]" which was used to heal those who looked upon it ({{bibleverse||Numbers|21:4-9|HE}}).

The term also appears in 2 Kings 18:4 in a passage describing reforms made by King [[Hezekiah]], in which he tore down [[bamot|altars]], cut down [[Asherah|symbols of Asherah]], destroyed the Nehushtan,&lt;ref name="Noth, 156"&gt;{{harvnb|Noth|1968|p=156}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"The Mystery of the Nechushtan", [[Hershel Shanks]], [[Biblical Archaeology Review]], pp.58-63, March/April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name ="JOBL, 87"&gt;{{cite book|last=Joines|first=Karen Randolph|title=The Bronze Serpent in the Israelite Cult The Bronze Serpent in the Israelite Cult|year=1968|publisher=JOBL, 87|page=245, note 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to many Bible translations, gave it that name.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/2%20Kings%2018:4 2nd Kings 18:4 in various translations]&lt;/ref&gt;

Regarding the passage in 2 Kings 18:4,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.biblegateway.com/verse/en/2%20Kings%2018:4 2nd Kings 18:4, many translations]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Matthew George Easton|M. G. Easton]] noted that "the lapse of nearly one thousand years had invested the 'brazen serpent' with a mysterious sanctity; and in order to deliver the people from their infatuation, and impress them with the idea of its worthlessness, Hezekiah called it, in contempt, 'Nehushtan', a brazen thing, a mere piece of brass".&lt;ref name=Easton/&gt;

The tradition of naming it Nehushtan is not considered to be any older than the time of Hezekiah.&lt;ref&gt;"Modern exegesis holds two different opinions in regard to the meaning of the word "Nehushtan," which is explained either as denoting an image of bronze, and as entirely unconnected with the word "naḥash" (serpent), or as a lengthened form of "naḥash" (comp. νεεσθάν in the Septuagint), and thus as implying that the worship of serpents was of ancient date in Israel. The assumption that the tradition about "Nehushtan" is not older than the time of Hezekiah is, however, not contested." [http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?letter=N&amp;artid=177 ''Jewish Encyclopedia'', ''s.v.'' "Nehushtan"]; [[H. H. Rowley]], "Zadok and Nehushtan" ''Journal of Biblical Literature'' '''58'''.2 (June 1939:113-141) p. 132 observes, "We have no record of this Brazen Serpent before this time, save for the obvious [[Etiology|aetiological story]] in Num. 8 f, which states that this sacred symbol had its origin in the Mosaic age".&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Testament===
In the [[Gospel of John]], [[Jesus]] discusses his destiny with a Jewish teacher named [[Nicodemus]] and makes a comparison between the raising up of the [[Son of man (Christianity)|Son of Man]] and the act of the serpent being raised by Moses for the healing of the people.&lt;ref&gt;John 3:14&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Olson|1996|p=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesus applied it as a foreshadowing event to his own execution on a stake stating, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of man be lifted up: That whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have eternal life. For God so loved the world, that he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in him should not perish, but have everlasting life" (John 3:14-16).

[[Charles Spurgeon]] preached a famous sermon on "the Mysteries of the Brazen Serpent" and this passage from John's Gospel in 1857.&lt;ref&gt;C. H. Spurgeon, [https://www.spurgeon.org/resource-library/sermons/the-mysteries-of-the-brazen-serpent#flipbook/ "The Mysteries of the Brazen Serpent"], 1857&lt;/ref&gt;

===Book of Mormon===
In the [[Book of Mormon]], two prophets make reference to this event. The first is the prophet [[Nephi, son of Lehi|Nephi]], son of [[Lehi (Book of Mormon prophet)|Lehi]] in a general discourse,&lt;ref&gt;1 Nephi 25:20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;1Nephi 17:41&lt;/ref&gt; the second is many years later by the prophet [[Alma the Younger|Alma]].&lt;ref&gt;Alma 33:19-23&lt;/ref&gt; Nephi tells the people that many of the Israelites perished because of the simplicity and faith required. In the latter narrative, Alma tells the people of Antionum that many of Israelites died because they lacked the faith to look at the brazen serpent. He then compared the brazen serpent to a type of Christ and exhorted the people to look to Christ and spiritually live. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cook|first1=Carl B.|title=It Is Better to Look Up - Carl B.

==In art==
There is a Brazen Serpent Monument on [[Mount Nebo]] in [[Jordan]] created by Italian artist Giovanni Fantoni.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.seetheholyland.net/tag/brazen-serpent-monument/&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Cardston Alberta Temple]] of the [[Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] has a handpainted mural depicting Moses and the brazen serpent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Similitude of the Son - liahona|url=https://www.lds.org/liahona/1995/02/in-similitude-of-the-son?lang=eng|website=www.lds.org|accessdate=16 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Similarly, on the ceiling of the [[Sistine Chapel]], [[Michelangelo]] painted a mural of the Israelites' deliverance from the plague of serpents by the creation of the bronze serpent.

'''Ottobock''' is a German [[prosthetic]]s company situated in [[Duderstadt]]. It has been responsible for several innovations in prosthetics, including the [[C-Leg]], a computerized knee that adaptively varies its passive resistance to suit the patients' different walking gaits, and the [[Michelangelo Hand]], a fully articulated robotic hand prosthesis. Ottobock has been a partner to the [[Paralympic Games]] since 1988, and an international worldwide partner to the [[International Paralympic Committee]] since 2005. In 2016, the partnership was extended until the end of 2020.

==History==
Ottobock was founded in Berlin as Orthopädische Industrie GmbH in 1919 by its namesake prosthetist, Otto Bock. It was created in response to the large number of injured veterans from [[World War I]]. Prostheses handmade by craftsmen could not keep up with demand. Bock's idea was to create components through industrial processes that could be supplied to prosthetists. This marked the beginning of a new industry. The political situation in post-war Berlin was unstable, and soon after the company was founded, it moved to [[Königsee]] in [[Thuringia]]. Over the following two decades, the company expanded to employ over 600 people.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottobock.com/en/company/history/ |title=History: over 90 years of progress and tradition |publisher=Otto Bock |access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[File:Science Center Medizintechnik Berlin.jpg|thumb|right|Science Center Medizintechnik in Berlin]]
After [[World War II]], Königsee lay within the Russian-occupied [[East Germany]]. The company property and assets there were [[expropriated]] in 1948. However, Max and Maria Näder, Bock's son-in-law and daughter, had established an office in [[Duderstadt]] in [[Lower Saxony]], initially as a sales office for the zones of Germany [[Allied-occupied Germany|occupied by the Western powers]]. In 1947, Max Näder became the managing director of the newly formed Otto Bock Orthopädische Industrie KG. Otto Bock died in 1953.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;

The company has been responsible for several innovations in prosthetics. As wood was in short supply in the early post-war years, it pioneered the use of [[polyurethane]] to manufacture prosthetics.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Otto Bock Kunststoff was founded in 1953 to produce plastic prosthetics. By 2016, it employed 423 people and anticipated revenues of €127 million.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://plasticker.de/news/shownews.php?nr=28819 |publisher=Plasticker |title=Ottobock Kunststoff: Inhaber prüft strategische Optionen - Veräußerung oder strategische Partnerschaften möglich |language=German |date=14 October 2016 |access-date=19 October 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottobock developed the pyramid adapter, a highly adjustable linkage for prosthetic parts. In 1997, it introduced the [[C-Leg]], a computerized knee that adaptively varies its passive resistance to suit the patients' different walking gaits. It was the world's first fully microprocessor-controlled leg prosthesis system, and transformed the company into a vendor of highly complex mobility systems. The C-Leg was followed by the [[Michelangelo Hand]], a fully articulated robotic hand prosthesis, and the mechatronic C-Brace orthotronic mobility system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottobockus.com/c-leg.html |title=C-Leg 4 above knee prosthetic leg |publisher=Ottobock USA |access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://en.red-dot.org/2246.html | title = Ottobock Healthcare wins the red dot: best of the best three times in this year’s red dot award: product design| accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ottobock developed the waterproof Genium X3 knee in cooperation with the [[United States Department of Defense]] to allow amputee soldiers to return to duty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://motherboard.vice.com/read/luxury-prosthetics |title=The 'Maserati of Microprocessor Prosthetics' Costs $120,000 |work=[[Motherboard (website)|Motherboard]] |access-date=19 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, a US-based corporate headquarters was established in [[Minneapolis, Minnesota]] under the name Ottobock. In March 2014, the company announced it would relocate its North American headquarters to [[Austin, Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/austin/news/2014/03/31/german-health-care-manufacturer-to-bring-us.html|title=German Health Care Manufacturer to Bring U.S. Headquarters, 110 Jobs to Austin|publisher=Austin Business Journal|first=Robert|last=Grattan|date=31 March 2014|access-date=23 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The logistics facility relocated to [[Louisville, Kentucky]], and manufacturing moved to [[Salt Lake City, Utah]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.oandp.com/articles/NEWS_2014-01-23_01.asp |newspaper=The O&amp;P Edge |title=Ottobock Relocating HQ to Texas, Other Divisions to Utah, Kentucky|date=23 January 2014 |access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://lermagazine.com/market-mechanics/ottobock-moves-operations-to-louisville|title=Ottobock moves operations to Louisville |newspaper=Lower Extremity Review |first= Emily |last=Delzell |date=April 2014 |p=66 |access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The US company was its first foreign branch. By 2016, it had branches in 45 different countries.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; Sycor was established as a wholly owned subsidiary in 1998.

Professor Hans Georg Näder became head of the company in 1990. In 1992, after the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall]] and the subsequent [[German reunification]], the Näder family re-purchased the land in Königsee that had been expropriated in 1948, and established a new wheelchair manufacturing facility and logistics centre there.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; A medical science centre ({{lang-de|Science Center Medizintechnik}}) was built by the company in Berlin in 2009 to celebrate 90 years since its foundation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.artcom.de/index.php?lang=en&amp;option=com_acnews&amp;task=view&amp;id=320&amp;Itemid=136&amp;page=0 | title = A Science Center for Ottobock at Potsdamer Platz| accessdate=8 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Max Näder died that year at the age of 94.&lt;ref name="History" /&gt; By 2015, with a work force of 6,300 and annual sales of €771 million, the company was valued at €2.5 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://de.reuters.com/article/deutschland-ottobock-idDEKCN0PK1QY20150710 |title=Prothesen-Weltmarktführer Otto Bock will an die Börse |language=German |date=10 July 2015 |publisher=Reuters |access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2017 Ottobock acquired [[BeBionic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ottobock kauft BeBionic von Steeper |url=http://www.goettinger-tageblatt.de/Welt/Wirtschaft/Regional/Ottobock-kauft-BeBionic-von-Steeper|newspaper=Göttinger Tageblatt|accessdate=1 March 2017|date=2 February 2017 |first=Bernard |last=Marks |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ottobock acquires BeBionic from Steeper|url=http://www.healio.com/orthotics-prosthetics/industry-news/news/online/%7Be973ffbd-3c94-4a48-a400-7481c7af32df%7D/ottobock-acquires-bebionic-from-steeper|website=www.healio.com|accessdate=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ottobock has been a partner to the [[Paralympic Games]] since 1988, and an international worldwide partner to the [[International Paralympic Committee]] (IPC) since 2005.&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottobock.com/media/local-media/paralympics/images/rio-page-2016/documents/ottobock-the-paralympic-games-factsheet_final.pdf |title=Ottobock Paralympic Games Fact Sheet |publisher=Ottobock  |access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[2016 Paralympic Games]] in [[Rio de Janeiro]] was the 13th games at which it provided technical services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.paralympic.org/news/ottobock-announced-official-provider-rio-2016-paralympic-games |title=Ottobock announced as the Official Provider for the Rio 2016 Paralympic Games |date=8 September 2014 |publisher=[[International Paralympic Committee]] |access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This involved shipping {{convert|18|t}} of equipment, including 250 items classed as hazardous good or dangerous chemicals, and 15,000 spare parts, including 1,100 wheelchair tyres, 70 running blades and 300 prosthetic feet, {{convert|300|km}} from Duderstadt to the port at [[Bremerhaven]], {{convert|10100|km}} by sea to [[Port of Santos|Santos]], and then {{convert|500|km}} by road to Rio de Janeiro.&lt;ref name="Today"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ottobock.com/en/paralympics/rio-2016/ |title=Today in the Ottobock Repair Service Centers  |publisher=Ottobock  |access-date=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Seoul in 1988, four Ottobock technicians carried out 350 repairs;&lt;ref name="Fact Sheet"/&gt;  in Rio de Janeiro in 2016, 100 technicians from 29 countries speaking 26 languages carried out 3,361 repairs for 1,162 athletes, including 2,745 repairs to wheelchairs, 438 to prosthetics, and 178 to orthodics.&lt;ref name="Today" /&gt;

By 2016, Ottobock was the IPC's longest-serving partner.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20975">'''Out-of-hours services''' are the arrangements to provide access to [[primary care|healthcare]] at times when [[General Practitioner]] [[Doctor's office|surgeries]] are closed; in the [[United Kingdom]] this is normally between 6.30pm and 8am, at weekends, at [[Bank Holiday]]s and sometimes if the practice is closed for educational sessions.

Most Out-of-hours services in [[NHS Scotland|Scotland]] and [[NHS Wales|Wales]] are provided directly by Health Boards. In Northern Ireland they are provided by the Health and Social Care Trusts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GP and other Out-of-Hours services|url=http://www.gpoutofhours.hscni.net|publisher=HSCNI|accessdate=27 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In England they are commissioned by [[Clinical Commissioning Group]]s, usually working together, as the contracts often cover large areas. Out-of-hours providers in England must be registered with, and are regulated by, the [[Care Quality Commission]].

The contract for [[General medical services]] which most GPs work to requires practices to be responsible for their patients between 8 am and 6.30 pm from Monday to Friday. In some cities commercial deputising services were set up employing doctors to cover the out of hour’s period, paid by the practices in the area but these weren’t viable in much of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=Dr Eric|title=The True History of GP Out of Hours Services|url=http://abetternhs.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/true-history/|website=A better NHS|accessdate=8 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The GP Co-operatives prior to 2004==
Woodside Health Centre in Glasgow established a successful deputising service before 1973: “. . . twenty general practitioners group together to provide a highly organised system of out-of-hours health care … The telephone” (at the health centre) ” is permanently manned and the patients are not involved in the delays of a post office diversion system. In the evening the telephone is answered by an experienced registered general nurse who can give advice where it is appropriate. In the event of a visit being required the nurse is able to contact the doctor on duty by radiotelephone. . . . . The patient’s previous notes are readily available to the nurse in the health centre and can be passed on to the doctor on duty. . . . Control of the system is exercised by a sub-committee of the health centre committee of management. The system thus has the advantages of a commercial deputising service in allowing doctors to have adequate time off duty, but control is exercised from within the health centre.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=General Medical Services|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/socialist-health-association-policy/health-centres-the-next-step-1975/|website=Socialist Health Association|publisher=HMSO|accessdate=18 October 2014|year=1973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Royal Commission on the NHS]] in 1979 reported that commercially organised deputising services had grown rapidly over the last ten years and about one third of all GPs made some use of them. They received complaints that deputies lacked personal knowledge of the patient and access to the medical records, contacting the service could be difficult, and that deputies were slow in responding to emergencies&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Royal Commission on the NHS Chapter 7|date=July 1979|publisher=HMSO|isbn=0101761503|url=http://www.sochealth.co.uk/national-health-service/royal-commission-on-the-national-health-service-contents/royal-commission-on-the-nhs-chapter-7/|accessdate=19 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994 after minor changes to the GP contract many groups of doctors got together and formed cooperative organisations sharing the out of hours calls between a large number of GPs on a rota basis. A minimum of about 40 GPs were needed to set up a successful cooperative. In 1996 the G-Docs out-of-hours cooperative in Grampian became Scotland’s first out-of-hours general practitioner service, financed by 200 GPs who each paid a monthly subscription.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.scotsman.com/news/health/out-of-hours-gp-service-to-replace-saturday-surgery-1-647310 |title=Out-of-hours GP service to replace Saturday surgery |work=[[The Scotsman]] |date=9 May 2003 |accessdate=10 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [http://www.out-of-hours.info/index.php?pid=14 Carson Report] published by the Department of Health in 2000 proposed quality standards which would apply not only to deputising services and Out-Of-Hours cooperatives but also to individual GPs &amp; practices providing their own cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4066827.pdf |archiveurl=http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/@dh/@en/documents/digitalasset/dh_4066827.pdf |title=Raising standards for patients: new partnerships in out-of-hours care |publisher=Department of Health |date=31 October 2000 |archivedate=7 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson's proposal for “A new model of integrated out-of-hours provision ... accessed by patients via a single telephone call, routed in the first place through NHS Direct and passed, where necessary, to the appropriate provider of out-of-hours services in that locality.” eventually developed into [[NHS 111]] and influenced the formulation of the 2004 GP contract.

Until the 2004 contract most GPs provided care for their patients outside those hours either themselves, or as part of a GP Co-operative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Girach|first1=Mo|title=A quick guide to GP co-operatives|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/commissioning/a-quick-guide-to-gp-co-operatives/14337679.article|accessdate=27 September 2014|publisher=Pulse|date=26 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total amount earmarked for Out of Hours duties including Night Visit Fees was an average of just under £6000 per GP per year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rose|first1=Eric|title=The True History of GP Out of Hours Services|url=http://abetternhs.wordpress.com/2013/05/10/true-history/|website=A Better NHS|accessdate=7 October 2014|date=10 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Changes after 2004==
The new contract passed the responsibility for organising out-of-hours services from individual doctors to the [[Primary Care Trust]]s.  Practices could opt out of the provision of out-of-hours services and lose the £6000 and most did.  Some PCTs worked with the GP co-operatives, but some gave the contract to a commercial provider, commonly [[Harmoni]] or [[Serco]] both of which have been the subject of major complaints and of failing to employ sufficient doctors. By 2013 most of the co-operatives had converted to social enterprises.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GP co-operatives mutate into out-of-hours social enterprises|url=https://www.theguardian.com/social-enterprise-network/2013/sep/20/gp-co-operatives-out-of-hours-social-enterprise|accessdate=27 September 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=20 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the co-ops were involved in the provision of contracts to deliver [[NHS 111]] services.  According to John Horrocks, chief executive of Urgent Health UK, "It's not the same as it used to be, where everyone took their turn in a co-operative. It's more of a lifestyle choice. Now, you often find GPs who specialise in out-of-hours … typically, a shift rota is available on the internet and the GP is able to sign up to whatever shifts they want to work."

A study by the [[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] in July 2014 of people in England found that the urgent care system is complex and many people do not know how to contact out-of-hours GP services or even that such services exist;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nao.org.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/Out-of-hours-GP-services-in-England1.pdf |title=Department of Health and NHS England: Out-of-hours GP services in England |publisher=[[National Audit Office (United Kingdom)|National Audit Office]] |date=9 September 2014 |accessdate=28 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; that 26% had not heard of out-of-hours GP services, and 19% had not heard of [[NHS 111]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Many unaware of out-of-hours GPs|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/primary-care/many-unaware-of-out-of-hours-gps/5072922.article|accessdate=27 September 2014|publisher=Health Service Journal|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Provision of out-of-hours services is a particular problem in remote locations. The [[Western Isles]] are an example of a remote area where new models of care are being trialled, with Community Unscheduled Care Nurses being deployed for patients who need to be visited at their place of residence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=NHS out of hours service to be tested in North Harris|url=http://www.stornowaygazette.co.uk/news/local-headlines/nhs-out-of-hours-service-to-be-tested-in-north-harris-1-3551392|accessdate=27 September 2014|publisher=Stornoway Gazette|date=24 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[David Cameron]] introduced plans to enable "hard working people ...to see their GP seven days a week and out of office hours" in September 2013. This promised access to GPs from 8am-8pm, and on Saturday and Sunday and to "test a variety of forward-thinking services to suit modern lifestyles, including greater use of Skype, email and phone consultations for those who would find it easier."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Seven day, 8am – 8pm, GP access for hard working people|url=https://www.gov.uk/government/news/seven-day-8am-8pm-gp-access-for-hard-working-people|website=Gov.uk|publisher=Prime Minister's Office|accessdate=27 September 2014|date=1 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Results from the [[GP Patient Survey]], an independent poll run by [[Ipsos MORI]] on behalf of NHS England showed that extending opening hours and weekend opening were not a high priority for many patients. Long waits for appointments and failing to see a preferred, named doctor were more pressing issues.  There was variation in demand for weekend opening with the highest demand in Windsor, Ascot and Maidenhead where some 28.1% of patients wanted surgeries open on Saturday but it was lowest in Wigan, where only 13.9% did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=GP surgery hours: Fewer than 1-in-10 want Sunday opening in Greater Manchester|url=http://www.manchestereveningnews.co.uk/incoming/gp-surgery-hours-fewer-1-in-10-7864642|accessdate=7 October 2014|publisher=Manchester Evening News|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2014 GPs complained that the [[NHS 111]] service had not been inspected by the [[Care Quality Commission]] and that it could jeopardise the safety of Out-of-hours services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Concern over NHS 111 as CQC praises GP out-of-hours care|url=http://www.gponline.com/concern-nhs-111-cqc-praises-gp-out-of-hours-care/article/1315553|accessdate=11 October 2014|publisher=GP Online|date=3 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evaluation==
In April 2015 Exeter Medical School used data from the official GP patient survey in England to score different types of providers out of 100.  On speed, confidence and overall experience, scores from patients seen by commercial providers were lower.
The score out of 100 for overall experience was 73 for NHS providers; 72 for not-for profit providers; 69 for the commercial sector. Prof John Campbell said the research did show that the very best individual scores by providers were seen in the commercial sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Private GP out-of-hours care 'worse'|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/health-32536741|accessdate=2 May 2015|publisher=BBC News|date=1 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commercial providers==
Harmoni HS Ltd was a major provider of primary care, including out-of-hours services, which started as a GP co-operative and is now owned by [[Care UK]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Enfield Clinical Commissioning Group appoints new chairman|url=http://www.northlondon-today.co.uk/news.cfm?id=29385|accessdate=27 September 2014|publisher=North London Newspapers|date=10 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Take Care Now]] had contracts for services in [[Cambridgeshire]], [[Suffolk]], [[Great Yarmouth]] and [[Waveney District|Waveney]], and [[Worcester]].  It was taken over by Harmoni.  Care UK Clinical Services Limited now provides unscheduled care to over 15m patients.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Care UK buys largest GP out-of-hours provider|url=http://www.pulsetoday.co.uk/commissioning/commissioning-topics/urgent-care/care-uk-buys-largest-gp-out-of-hours-provider/20000781.article#.VCdBphLGBJ0|accessdate=27 September 2014|publisher=Pulse|date=6 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It runs out of hours services in Rotherham, Hampshire, Harrow, Hillingdon, Merton, Islington, Kingston, Wandsworth, Camden and Ealing.

[http://www.urgenthealthuk.com/about-us Urgent Health UK] is a federation of Social Enterprise Unscheduled Primary Care Providers to which many of these organisations belong.  According them in 2018 social enterprises were delivering out of hours services to 67% of patients in England, with an annual contract value of £294 million.  Since 2008 the proportion delivered by NHS organisations has declined from 30% to 18% and that delivered by commercial providers dropped from 30% to 15%.  Average annual funding per patient for social enterprise contracts is £7.62, for NHS organisations £8.10 and commercial organisations £8.22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Social enterprises now dominate GP out of hours sector |url=https://www.hsj.co.uk/finance-and-efficiency/revealed-social-enterprises-now-dominate-gp-out-of-hours-sector/7022583.article |accessdate=29 August 2018 |publisher=Health Service Journal |date=8 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pearce Bailey 1898.jpg|thumb|Pearce Bailey (neurologist).]]  
'''Pearce Bailey''' (1865–1922) was an [[United States|American]] [[Neurology|neurologist]] and [[Psychiatry|psychiatrist]], educated at [[princeton University|Princeton]] and [[columbia University|Columbia]] Universities. He became a consultant in several [[New York City|New York]] hospitals and with [[Joseph Collins (neurologist)|Collins]] and Frankel founded the [[Neurological Institute of New York|Neurological Institute]]. He was also appointed an associate professor of neurology in Columbia. On the entry of the United States into [[World War I]], he was appointed chief of the division of neurology and psychiatry in the United States army with the rank of colonel. He perfected a system for weeding out "mental defectives" which is said to have been used as a model by the Allies. His major literary efforts comprised a translation of Golobievski's ''Atlas and Epitome of Diseases Caused by Accident (1900) and a [[book|monograph]] ''Accident and Injury''; Relation to the Nervous System'' (1906), which was later expanded into ''Diseases of the Nervous System Resulting from Accident and Injury'', a valuable work for the medical world. At the time of his death, Bailey was chairman of the [[New York State Committee for Mental Defectives]].

The '''practitioner–scholar model''' is an advanced educational and operational model that is focused on practical application of scholarly knowledge.&lt;ref name="APA"&gt;{{cite book | last = Association | first = American | title = Getting in | publisher = American Psychological Association | location = Washington | year = 2007 | isbn = 1-59147-799-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially developed to train [[clinical psychology|clinical psychologists]] but has since been adapted by other specialty programs such as business, public health, and law.  

==Model==

===Creation===
In 1973, a new clinical psychology training model was proposed at the historic Vail Conference on Professional Training in Psychology in [[Vail, Colorado]]—the practitioner-scholar model—providing yet another path of training for those primarily interested in clinical practice.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;
Prior to this, in 1949, a ground breaking [[Boulder conference|conference]] was held in [[Boulder, Colorado]], endorsing a model of study for clinicians that to this day has dominated clinical programs at most University based institutions: the [[scientist–practitioner model]], designed to provide a rigorous grounding in research methods and a breadth of exposure to clinical psychology.  Prior, [[research scientist]]s had dominated the field of psychological work, and this second, new model, known as the 'Vail' model, called for more practitioner-oriented course work.

===Features===
Several features differentiate the practitioner-scholar model from the other two:&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;
* Training in this model is more strongly focused on clinical practice than either of the other two.
* Many (but not all) of these training programs grant a [[Psy.D.]] degree rather than a Ph.D. or Ed.D.
* Admissions criteria may place more of an emphasis on personal qualities of the applicants or clinically related work experience.
* Accepts a much larger number of students than the typical Ph.D. degree.
* These programs are typically housed in a greater variety of institutional settings than are research scientist or scientist-practitioner programs.

Like scientist-practitioner training, practitioner-scholar training is characterized by core courses in both basic and applied psychology, supervision during extensive clinical experience, and research consumption.  Both require predoctoral internships that are usually full-time appointments in universities, medical centers, community mental health centers, or hospitals.&lt;ref name="APA"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14596">In [[fluid dynamics]], a flow with periodic variations is known as '''pulsatile flow''', or as '''Womersley flow'''. The flow profiles was first derived by [[John R. Womersley]] (1907–1958) in his work with blood flow in [[arteries]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[cardiovascular]] system of [[Chordate|chordate animals]] is a very good example where pulsatile flow is found, but pulsatile flow is also observed in [[engines]] and [[hydraulic system]]s, as a result of [[rotating]] [[Mechanism (engineering)|mechanisms]] pumping the fluid.

The pulsatile flow profile is given in a straight pipe by

== Properties ==

=== Womersley number ===
The pulsatile flow profile changes its shape depending on the Womersley number

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = R \left( \frac{\omega \rho}{\mu} \right)^{1/2} \,.&lt;/math&gt;

For &lt;math&gt;\alpha \lesssim 2&lt;/math&gt;, viscous forces dominate the flow, and the pulse is considered [[Quasistatic equilibrium|quasi-static]] with a parabolic profile.
For &lt;math&gt;\alpha \gtrsim 2&lt;/math&gt;, the inertial forces are dominant in the central core, whereas viscous forces dominate near the boundary layer. Thus, the velocity profile gets flattened, and [[Phase (waves)|phase]] between the pressure and velocity waves gets shifted towards the core.

=== Function limits ===

==== Lower limit ====

The Bessel function at its lower [[Limit of a function|limit]] becomes&lt;ref name=Mestel&gt;
{{cite web

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} J_0(z) = 1 - \frac{z^2}{4} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which converges to the [[Hagen-Poiseuille flow]] profile for steady flow for

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{n \to 0} u(r, t) = - \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) \, , &lt;/math&gt;

or to a [[Quasistatic equilibrium|quasi-static]] pulse with parabolic profile when

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{\alpha \to 0} u(r, t) = Re \left\{ - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{P'_n}{4 \mu}  (R^2 - r^2 ) \,  e^{i n \omega t} \right\} = - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{P'_n}{4 \mu}  (R^2 - r^2 ) \, \cos(n \omega t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

In this case, the function is real, because the pressure and velocity waves are in phase.

==== Upper limit ====

The Bessel function at its upper limit it becomes&lt;ref name=Mestel/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} J_0(z \, i) = \frac{e^z}{\sqrt{2\pi\, z}} \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which converges to

:&lt;math&gt; \lim_{z\to\infty} u(r, t) = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - e^{\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{1/2} \left(\frac{r}{R} - 1 \right) } \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} = - \sum^N_{n=0} \frac{\, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - e^{\alpha \, n^{1/2}  \left(\frac{r}{R} - 1 \right) } \right] \sin(n\,\omega\, t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

This is highly reminiscent of the Stokes layer on an oscillating flat plate, or the skin-depth penetration of an alternating magnetic field into an electrical conductor.
On the surface &lt;math&gt; u(r=R,t) = 0&lt;/math&gt;, but the exponential term becomes negligible once &lt;math&gt;\alpha (1 - r/R)&lt;/math&gt; becomes large, the velocity profile becomes almost constant and independent of the viscosity. Thus, the flow simply oscillates as a plug profile in time according to the pressure gradient,

:&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} = - \sum^N_{n=0} P'_n \,.&lt;/math&gt;

However, close to the walls, in a layer of thickness &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{O}(\alpha^{-1})&lt;/math&gt;, the velocity adjusts rapidly to zero. Furthermore, the phase of the time oscillation varies quickly with position across the layer. The exponential decay of the higher frequencies is faster.

== Derivation ==

For deriving the analytical solution of this non-stationary flow velocity profile, the following assumptions are taken:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

*Fluid is [[homogeneous]], [[incompressible]] and [[Newtonian fluid|Newtonian]];
*Tube wall is [[Stiffness|rigid]] and [[Circle|circular]];
*Motion is [[Laminar flow|laminar]], [[axisymmetric]] and parallel to the tube's axis;
*[[Boundary conditions]] are: axisymmetry at the centre, and no-slip condition on the wall;
*Pressure gradient is a [[periodic function]] that drives the fluid;
*[[Gravitation]] has no effect on the fluid.

Thus, the [[Navier-Stokes equation]] and the [[continuity equation]] are simplified as

:&lt;math&gt; \rho \frac{\partial u}{\partial t} =  -\frac{\partial p}{\partial x} + \mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 u}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial u}{\partial r}\right) \, &lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt;  \frac{\partial u}{\partial x} =  0 \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

respectively. The pressure gradient driving the pulsatile flow is decomposed in [[Fourier series]],

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} (t) = \sum^N_{n=0}P'_n e^{in\omega t} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; is the [[imaginary number]], &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt; is the [[angular frequency]] of the first [[harmonic]] (i.e., &lt;math&gt;n = 1&lt;/math&gt;), and &lt;math&gt;P'_n&lt;/math&gt; are the [[amplitudes]] of each harmonic &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;. Note that, &lt;math&gt;P'_0&lt;/math&gt; (standing for &lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is the steady-state pressure gradient, whose [[Sign (mathematics)|sign]] is opposed to the steady-state velocity (i.e., a negative pressure gradient yields positive flow). Similarly, the velocity profile is also decomposed in Fourier series in [[Phase (waves)|phase]] with the pressure gradient, because the fluid is incompressible,

:&lt;math&gt; u(r,t) = \sum^N_{n=0}U_n e^{in\omega t} \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;U_n&lt;/math&gt; are the amplitudes of each harmonic of the periodic function, and the steady component (&lt;math&gt;n = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is simply [[Poiseuille flow]]

:&lt;math&gt; U_0 = - \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) \, . &lt;/math&gt;

Thus, the Navier-Stokes equation for each harmonic reads as

:&lt;math&gt; i\rho n\omega U_n =  -P'_n +\mu \left(\frac{\partial^2 U_n}{\partial r^2} + \frac{1}{r} \frac{\partial U_n}{\partial r}\right) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

With the boundary conditions satisfied, the general solution of this [[ordinary differential equation]] for the oscillatory part (&lt;math&gt;n \geq 1&lt;/math&gt;) is

:&lt;math&gt;  U_n(r) = A_n \, J_0 \left( \alpha \, \frac{r}{R} n^{1/2}\,i^{3/2} \right) + B_n \, Y_0 \left( \alpha \, \frac{r}{R} n^{1/2}\,i^{3/2} \right) + \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho\, n\, \omega}\, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;J_0(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Bessel function]] of first kind and order zero, &lt;math&gt;Y_0(\cdot)&lt;/math&gt; is the Bessel function of second kind and order zero, &lt;math&gt;A_n&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;B_n&lt;/math&gt; are arbitrary constants, and &lt;math&gt;\alpha = R \surd( \omega \rho / \mu )&lt;/math&gt; is the [[dimensionless]] [[Womersley number]]. The axisymetic boundary condition (&lt;math&gt;\partial U_n/ \partial r|_{r=0} = 0&lt;/math&gt;) is applied to show that &lt;math&gt;B_n = 0&lt;/math&gt; for the derivative of above equation to be valid, as the derivatives &lt;math&gt;J_0'&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;Y_0'&lt;/math&gt; approach infinity. Next, the wall non-slip boundary condition (&lt;math&gt;U_n(R) = 0&lt;/math&gt;) yields &lt;math&gt; A_n = - \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \frac{1}{ J_0 \left( \alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2} \right)}&lt;/math&gt;. Hence, the amplitudes of the velocity profile of the harmonic &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt; becomes

:&lt;math&gt;  U_n(r) = \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2} \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2})} \right] = \frac{i\,P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\Lambda_n = \alpha \, n^{1/2} \, i^{3/2}&lt;/math&gt; is used for simplification.
The velocity profile itself is obtained by taking the [[Real number|real]] part of the [[complex function]] resulted from the [[summation]] of all harmonics of the pulse,

:&lt;math&gt; u(r, t) = \frac{P'_0}{4 \mu}  \left(R^2 - r^2 \right) + Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n \, \frac{r}{R})}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Flow rate ===
[[Discharge (hydrology)|Flow rate]] is obtained by integrating the velocity field on the cross-section. Since,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{d}{dx} \left[ x^p J_p(a\,x) \right] = a\,x^p J_{p-1} (a\, x)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{d}{dx} \left[ x\, J_1(a\,x) \right] = a\,x J_{0} (a\, x) \, ,&lt;/math&gt;

then
 
:&lt;math&gt; Q(t) = \iint u(r, t) \, dA =  Re \left\{ \pi\,R^2 \, \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ 1 - \frac{2}{\Lambda_n}\frac{J_1(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

===Velocity profile===
[[File:Comparison of velocity profile of Womersley flow.svg|200px|thumb|Scaled velocity profiles of pulsatile flow are compared according to Womersley number.]]
To compare the shape of the velocity profile, it can be assumed that

:&lt;math&gt; 
 u(r,t) = f(r)\,\frac{Q(t)}{A} \, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt; 
 f(r) = \frac{u(r,t)}{\frac{Q(t)}{A}} = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} \left[ \frac{\Lambda_n \, J_0(\Lambda_n) - \Lambda_n \, J_0(\Lambda_n \, \frac{r}{R})}{\Lambda_n \, J_0(\Lambda_n) - 2\,J_1(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right\}
&lt;/math&gt;

is the shape function.&lt;ref&gt;

It is important to notice that this formulation ignores the inertial effects. The velocity profile approximates a parabolic profile or a plug profile, for low or high Womersley numbers, respectively.

=== Wall shear stress ===
For straight pipes, [[wall shear stress]] is

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_w = \mu \left. \frac{\partial u}{\partial r} \right|_{r=R} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

The derivative of a Bessel function is

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ x^{-p} J_{-p} (a\,x) \right] = a\,x^{-p} J_{p+1}(a\,x)
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\frac{\partial}{\partial x}\left[ J_0 (a\,x) \right] = -a\,J_1(a\,x) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Hence,

:&lt;math&gt;\tau_w = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} P'_n \frac{R}{\Lambda_n} \frac{J_1(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} e^{i n \omega t} \right\} \, .&lt;/math&gt;

=== Centre line velocity ===
If the pressure gradient &lt;math&gt;P'_n&lt;/math&gt; is not measured, it can still be obtained by measuring the velocity at the centre line. The measured velocity has only the real part of the full expression in the form of

:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{u}(t) = Re(u(0, t)) \equiv \sum^N_{n=1} \tilde{U}_n \, \cos(n \, \omega \, t) \, .&lt;/math&gt;

Noting that &lt;math&gt;J_0(0) = 1&lt;/math&gt;, the full physical expression becomes

:&lt;math&gt; u(0, t) = Re \left\{ \sum^N_{n=1} \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n) - 1}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] e^{i n \omega t} \right\} &lt;/math&gt;

at the centre line. The measured velocity is compared with the full expression by applying some properties of complex number. For any product of complex numbers (&lt;math&gt;C = AB&lt;/math&gt;), the amplitude and phase have the relations &lt;math&gt;|C| = |A||B|&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\phi_C = \phi_A + \phi_B&lt;/math&gt;, respectively. Hence,

:&lt;math&gt; 
\tilde{U}_n = \left| \frac{i \, P'_n}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n) - 1}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right| 
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
P'_n = \tilde{U}_n \left| i \, \rho \, n \, \omega \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n)}{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right|
&lt;/math&gt;

and

:&lt;math&gt; 
\tilde{\phi} = 0 = \phi_{P'_n} + \phi_{U_n}
\quad \Rightarrow \quad
\phi_{P'_n} = \operatorname{phase} \left( \frac{i}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right) \, ,
&lt;/math&gt;

which finally yield

:&lt;math&gt; 
 \frac{1}{\rho} \frac{\partial p}{\partial x} = \sum^N_{n=1} \tilde{U}_n \left| i \, \rho \, n \, \omega \left[ \frac{J_0(\Lambda_n)}{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right| \, \cos \left\{ n\,\omega\,t + \operatorname{phase} \left( \frac{i}{\rho \, n \, \omega} \left[ \frac{1 - J_0(\Lambda_n)}{J_0(\Lambda_n)} \right] \right) \right\} \, .
&lt;/math&gt;

Okazaki was born in [[Hiroshima]], [[Japan]]. He graduated in 1953 from [[Nagoya University]], and worked as a professor there after 1963. He died of [[leukemia]] (sequelae of [[Atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki|Atomic bombings of Hiroshima]]) in 1975 at the age of 44; he had been heavily [[radiation|irradiated]] in [[Hiroshima]] when the [[Little Boy|first atomic bomb]] was dropped.

The experiments by his group used ''E. coli''. After introducing &lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;T-thymidine for only ten seconds to ''E. coli'' during DNA replication, he placed the sample in a test tube of alkaline sucrose. The larger, heavier DNA flowed to the bottom of the test tube, while the smaller, lighter DNA did not. When samples were taken from the bottom of the test tube, it was found that half were heavy and half were light, proving that half of the DNA was complete and half was in fragments. Then he took a sample of ''E. coli'' DNA that had been synthesized for an additional five seconds, and found all the activity now resulted in the larger molecular weight. Therefore, there were no longer any fragments. This proved that during the five second chase, the RNA primer was removed by [[DNA polymerase I]], and the bases were joined together by [[DNA ligase]], leaving the newly synthesized DNA fully mature and repaired.

The '''Research Institute for Groundwater''' ('''RIGW''') is one of the most important organizations in [[Egypt]] specialized in development &amp; [[Water Management]] of groundwater policy. The policy indicates the water allocation in space and time from water resources to users. Assessment of groundwater potential for the various users is made by RIGW, based on available information which is updated periodically according to the availability of the information.

RIGW has the principal responsibility within the [[National Water Research Center (Egypt)|National Water Research Center]] to formulate and conduct applied research programs responsive to the national requirements to support integrated development and [[management]] of groundwater resources in [[Egypt]]. To accomplish this mission RIGW activities is encompass:
*Exploratory research and appraisals describing the occurrences and characteristics of groundwater resources. 
*Systematic data collection and analyses to monitor the state quantity, quality and use of [[groundwater]] resources.
*Basic and problem-oriented research to assess the potential of groundwater system and its response to natural and man-made stress. 
*Studies that aid in providing solutions and alleviating problems related to groundwater system.
*Scientific and technical assistance in groundwater related fields to other state and private agencies.

To fulfill this mission, RIGW has to participate in the initiation of management and legislation system for the protection of groundwater from degradation and the control of the environmental impacts that may accompany groundwater development. 

The role of RIGW at present is focused on its effective contribution to the planning and implementation of the national water policy and the development of Egypt's water resources. 

Direct beneficiaries are the MWRI and its departments. Other clients include: 
#National institutions
#Donor agencies
#Agriculture societies 
#Water Companies
#Individual investors. 

==Organization==
To fulfill the institute mission, the organization structure has been modified to reflect the activities and facilitate the execution of research and other programs.

'''Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare''' is the result of a first-of-its-kind health care joint venture between [[Saudi Aramco]] and [[Johns Hopkins Medicine]]. 
Since 1933, [[Saudi Aramco]] had delivered a high standard of medical care to its employees and their families through its own medical services organization. In 2013, Saudi Aramco partnered with Johns Hopkins Medicine to carve out and expand the capabilities of its medical services through Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare (JHAH), drawing upon the vast expertise of The [[Johns Hopkins University]] and The [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] and Health System to provide clinical program development, research, training, safety and quality, and health care administration expertise.[https://www.argaam.com/ar/article/articledetail/id/421749]

Inaugurated on January 28, 2014, Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare is the complex of company-operated and privately contracted hospitals that serve Saudi Aramco employees and their dependents, numbering about 350,000 total. In all communities, basic health care is provided through clinics, which function much as [[Health Maintenance Organizations]] do in the [[United States]].
A rotating staff of general practitioners performs examinations and prescribes care on an outpatient basis. All of the clinics have facilities and laboratories for basic diagnostic testing. Each clinic provides ambulance service and emergency room care, and each has a pharmacy where prescriptions ordered by clinic physicians can be filled at no charge. The community clinics are designed to take care of ordinary medical needs. More significant health problems are handled at the Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare hospital in [[Dhahran]].The professional staff at the hospital is multinational, but many of the specialists are U.S. Board Certified or the UK's equivalent. 

Johns Hopkins Aramco Healthcare [[Dhahran]] hospital is accredited by JCI, the newly created international division of JCAH. The blood bank is accredited by the [[American Association of Blood Banks]]. The Medical Laboratories have been continuously accredited by the College of American Pathologist (CAP) since 2002.
Liaison relations exist with the [[World Health Organization]] in Geneva, Switzerland, and the [[Centers for Disease Control]] in Atlanta, Georgia, for immediate consultation regarding diseases of international significance.

'''EPIC:'''

It’s been a long journey for JHAH on the road to implementing a truly first-rate [[Electronic health record|Electronic Health Record]] (EHR) that is capable of supporting its transformational ambitions in being an ever brighter example for quality of patient care in the kingdom. The recently launched patient portal, MyChart, which elevates patient partnership in their own healthcare to a new level, is only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the anticipated benefits of the new [[Epic Systems|Epic system]].

'''Stateira''' (died about 400 BC) was the wife of King [[Artaxerxes II of Persia]].

[[Asteroid]] [[831 Stateira]] is named in her honour.

== Biography ==

Stateira was the daughter of the Persian nobleman [[Hydarnes]]. She married Artaxerxes II, the oldest son of [[Darius II of Persia]] and his wife [[Parysatis]]. Probably Darius II wanted to establish good relations with an important noble family, from which Stateira was descended, because her brother Terituchmes married Amestris, a daughter of Darius II. But Terituchmes loved one of his half-sisters more than his royal bride and tried to start a rebellion. Therefore, Parysatis had all the children of Hydarnes killed and only spared the life of Stateira at the request of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ctesias]], ''Persica'' 55-56 (in an excerpt from [[Photius I of Constantinople]]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Artaxerxes II took over the Persian throne in 404 BC after the death of his father. Stateira seems to have been his only legal wife despite his numerous concubines. She bore a son, [[Artaxerxes III of Persia|Artaxerxes]], the heir to the throne, and probably other children. The queen mother Parysatis and Stateira tried to be the key political influence on the king; so the women became bitter rivals.

Stateira was very popular with the people, allegedly because she left the curtains open when she drove in her carriage and because she talked to the ordinary people. She supported her husband in his quarrel with his brother [[Cyrus the Younger]] and criticized her sharp-tongued mother-in-law, because Parysatis had helped her favourite son Cyrus in his attempt to win the Persian throne from his brother Artaxerxes II. Reportedly the intense hatred between the two women led Parysatis to encourage Artaxerxes II to take on concubines in order to hurt his wife. Stateira also publicly spoke up against the cruelties of the queen mother at the Persian court. For example, she criticized the brutal treatment of the [[Eunuch (court official)|eunuch]] Masabates and therefore intensified her conflict with Parysatis.

Finally Parysatis had Stateira murdered. Classical sources give different reasons for this deed. According to one version Parysatis wanted to save the life of the Spartan commander [[Clearchus of Sparta|Clearchus]] and his fellow-generals, who had been taken prisoner by [[Tissaphernes]], but Stateira had succeeded in persuading her husband to execute the prisoners. Therefore, Parysatis is supposed to have poisoned Stateira. [[Plutarch]], in his biography of Artaxerxes II, did not believe this story. According to another tradition Parysatis murdered her daughter-in-law because she realized that her son only felt true love for his wife. Plutarch reports that Parysatis performed the assassination with the help of a loyal servant named Gigis. She carved a bird with a poisoned knife in such a way that only one half of the animal was mixed with the poison. This half was served to Stateira when they were dining together. The poisoned meal caused the painful death of Stateira.&lt;ref&gt;[[Plutarch]], ''Artaxerxes'' 5-6 and 17-19 (mainly based on Ctesias).&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Stephen A. Mitchell''' (July 23, 1946 &amp;ndash; December 21, 2000) was a [[clinical psychologist]] and [[psychoanalyst]] whose writings helped to clarify many disparate psychoanalytic theories and theoreticians.  His book with [[Jay Greenberg (psychoanalyst)|Jay Greenberg]], ''Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory'' (1983), became a classic textbook in graduate schools and post-graduate institutions, providing a clear and systematic comparison of what had long been a highly complex and often confusing set of disparate theories. Stephen Mitchell was considered a leader of [[relational psychoanalysis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gabbard |first=G.O. | authorlink = Glen Gabbard|date=2000 |title= Relational Psychoanalysis: The Emergence of a Tradition |journal=[[Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association]] |volume=48 |pages=315-316 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell helped to create the Relational Track of the [[New York University]] Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Drescher |first=J. |date=2002 |title=In Memory of Stephen A. Mitchell, Ph.D |journal=Studies in Gender and Sexuality |volume=3 |pages=95-109 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Object Relations in Psychoanalytic Theory'' distinguished between psychoanalytic theories that emphasize biological drives such as sexuality and [[aggression]], on the one hand, and theories that emphasize human [[Interpersonal relationship|relationship]]s, on the other.  The former were referred to as ''drive/conflict theories'', and the latter were termed ''relational/conflict theories''.  Mitchell and Greenberg argued that drive theories and relational theories are conceptually incompatible, and psychoanalysis must therefore choose between them.  After their book, the ideas of Mitchell and Greenberg diverged.  Mitchell became generally acknowledged as the founder of the school of psychoanalysis known as Relational, which he described in his books, which include ''Relational Concepts in Psychoanalysis'' (1988), ''Hope and Dread in Psychoanalysis'' (1993), ''Influence and Autonomy in Psychoanalysis'' (1997), ''Relationality'' (2000), ''Can Love Last?'' (2001), and, with Margaret Black, ''Freud and Beyond: A History of Psychoanalytic Thought'' (1996).

One of Mitchell's most important accomplishments was the establishment of the international psychoanalytic journal, ''Psychoanalytic Dialogues'', a highly influential scholarly quarterly that continues to bring Relational Psychoanalysis to a wide audience.&lt;ref name="obit"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2000/12/23/national/23MITC.html "Dr. Stephen A. Mitchell, a Theorist in Psychoanalysis, Dies at 54."] ''[[New York Times]]'' 23 Dec 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;  Mitchell served as Editor for the journal's first ten years, 1990-2000. After the publication of his first book, with Greenberg, he was in great demand, and taught his ideas across the United States, Europe, and Israel.

In addition to his scholarly contributions, Mitchell was also an important political figure in psychoanalysis. He was instrumental in developing a number of psychoanalytic organizations, including the [[American Psychological Association]]'s Division of Psychoanalysis, the Relational Track of the [http://postdocpsychoanalytic.as.nyu.edu/page/home New York University Postdoctoral Program in Psychotherapy and Psychoanalysis], and a variety of other groups.  

Mitchell died of cardiac arrest at age 54.  His final book, published posthumously and entitled ''Can Love Last?''  was an application of relational theory to love relationships.&lt;ref name="lovelast"&gt;[[Shulevitz, Judith]].

She was also the first Jewish woman to receive a Ph.D from Harvard,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://jwa.org/encyclopedia/article/psychology-in-united-states|title=Psychology in the United States {{!}} Jewish Women's Archive|website=jwa.org|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; having careers at multiple institutions as she conducted studies primarily on memory of tasks, with an interest in its relation to women.

== Personal life ==
Alper grew up in Chelsea, Massachusetts to a Jewish family that Alper described as an "achievement oriented, but not at all a college-oriented, Jewish family".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Models of achievement : reflections of eminent women in psychology|last=|first=|date=1983|publisher=Columbia University Press|others=O'Connell, Agnes N., Russo, Nancy Felipe, 1943-|year=|isbn=0231053126|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had a sister that was ten years older, named Bertha, who has been described as the most influential role model in Alper's life, yet someone who she could never dream to surpass or even match in her own achievements.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Bertha was valedictorian and graduated at sixteen with the intention to attempt a career in business; she was more outgoing than her sister.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was Bertha who persuaded Alper to follow the college prep track in high school.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Alper was a professor's assistant in college, and was later promoted to the position of general assistant for Wellesley's psychology department.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She also worked for the Judge Baker Guidance Center in Boston for free before getting her B.A. and M.A. later on.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She married Abraham T. Alper, who was involved in law, in 1932.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was subject to much gender discrimination throughout her career, especially during her time at Harvard.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was subjected to a grueling three hour interview where she was informed of the low female acceptance and survival rate.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She would not receive a position at a university that guaranteed a tenure for female faculty until 1952 at her alma mater.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite this, she was able to make her mark and see the changing times later on as more women were accepted onto faculty positions.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She would retire from her position as a faculty member at her alma mater in 1973 and from Judge Baker in 1979, but continued to run a small practice to help out adult patients until her death.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.feministvoices.com/thelma-alper/|title=Thelma G. Alper - Psychology's Feminist Voices|last=Gul|first=Pelin|website=www.feministvoices.com|language=en|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thelma Alper passed away on July 30, 1988&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; at Sherrill House in Boston due to a stroke.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; She was 80 years old.

==Education==
As Alper's record in school was excellent, she was informed by her principal she would not have to take the College Entrance Examination, and was eligible to be admitted into Radcliffe College as a student right away.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite this, Alper struggled with her choice of college. While Alper favored Radcliffe, her sister and father wanted Wellesley, while her mother picked out Simmons College.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although nervous at the lack of familiar social connections at Wellesley, Alper went with her sister's choice and took the College Boards in June 1925, before officially starting college in September of the same year, at the age of seventeen.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Alper did not take well to Wellesley at first and was even thinking of pulling out.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She initially considered a profession as a kindergarten teacher, for which Wellesley did not possess a promising program offering a chance for growth for at the time.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, she chose to stay for the full year at her sister's request, and ended up feeling better about the choice later on as she took more German classes that piqued her interest - leading her to major in the language.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her sophomore year was when she was introduced to the topic of psychology through a required introductory course.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She initially disliked the subject and found it quite dry, even when taking more advanced classes in the field.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite this, she accepted a role as the introductory psychology professor's assistant in May 1929.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This allowed her to take care of her sister's young son (since her sister had passed away in December 1928), and to continue her education at Wellesley for free, even as a graduate student.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She chose this position over several jobs that were related to her German major, including a teaching position at Wheaton College, a translator position for a publishing firm, and a position in one of Yale's foreign departments.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

She was later promoted to be an assistant for the department, allowing her the experience of teaching small discussions and participating in some research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She received her B.A. in 1929, with General Honors.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; A brief six-week stint between her junior and senior year of college for Judge Baker Guidance Center allowed her to work in a more clinical position.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She later received her M.A. in 1933.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Unfortunately, her professor died that summer, which meant that she no longer had good support within the psychology department to advance any further without a Ph.D.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It was around this time she hit a wall in her career, being both financially unsure and unable to move forward with her work at Wellesley.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She chose to take classes at the Harvard Graduate School of Education a few years later in order to be eligible to help in the English department, where she took on the role of a "director of remedial reading."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; However, Alper wanted a new challenge, and was thus driven to apply for a spot in a Ph.D. program in Harvard's College of Liberal Arts psychology department.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; This happened despite the current chairman, Dr. Edwin G. Boring, warning her that their acceptance of females was sparse and the environment for them harsh.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was accepted and began class in 1939.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Career==
Her first publication came during her time with the remedial reading program, which appeared in "The Wellesley Magazine" and was titled "If Only I Could Read Faster."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She would later become a co-editor for her collaboration with Dr. Boring for two books, "Psychology for the Fighting Man" and "Psychology for the Returning Veteran".&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Despite the harsher treatment of women at Harvard at the time and the smaller graduating class compared to men, Alper passed the Qualifying Preliminary Examinations in 1941, and got her Psychology Ph.D. in 1943.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After resigning from Wellesley, she became a Psychology tutor at Radcliffe in 1942, and soon a Psychology instructor for Harvard in 1943.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The position at Harvard would lead to many hardships on Alper's part, as much of Harvard's curriculum was based around separating male and female.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite much initial opposition from the male faculty, it was found that the male students were much more accepting of the idea of a female instructor, and enrollment stayed the same.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She would be the only female in the department until 1946, with the arrival of Eugenia Hanfmann in the social relations department.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

The gender discrimination would continue as both wom&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; en would eventually leave due to the lack of tenure opportunity from Harvard. Alper would find similar results at Tufts and Boston, where both offered spots without the possibility of tenure.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She would later accept a position for Clark University's psychology department, where she was, again, the only female on staff.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Despite a more accepting and open-minded environment there, she left to take an offer back at Wellesley in 1952 due to her husband's poor health.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The position included a role as an associate professor, where she could be promoted into a full professor within two years and tenure was finally an option.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, the Nursery School at Wellesley would remain as long as it was useful to her research.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She would remain there until she retired in 1973.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was also the chairwomen of the psychology department there for some unknown time.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In 1959, Alper would return to the place where she was first given clinical experience - Judge Baker Guidance Center.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Her visit was agreed upon with the president of Wellesley, in coordination with her acceptance of her position at the university.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At Judge Baker, she would spend her time in clinical research and training in therapy.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; At some point, she was a consultant for a Head Start set-up in Charleston, MA, with Dr. Bessie Sperry, which lasted for five-years.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She would retire from Judge Baker in June 1979.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

=== Research ===
Alper's research mainly focused on completed and uncompleted tasks, meshing clinical and social psychology, the latter of which was influenced by Professor Kurt Lewin's class.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This interest was further pursued via her Ph.D., and later led to her creation of a role-orientation measure, termed the Wellesley Role-Orientation Scale (WROS) in 1974.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Women who receive a high score using this measure typically prefer the role that are assigned to them via the culture - the traditionalists.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Those who don't receive a high score are more likely to either be neutral when it comes to taking on more traditional male careers, or feel that the world is unjust due to the heavy discrimination on women who desire to make a career in male-oriented fields.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==Legacy, awards, and achievements==
During her time taking courses at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, she developed ''The Wellesley Spelling Scale'' with another colleague, which was later published and marketed by the California Test Bureau.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; After passing her examinations at the Harvard College of Liberal Arts, she became the eleventh woman to gain a Ph.D. from Harvard in psychology.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She was also the first Jewish woman to receive such a distinction from Harvard.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She served as President of the Massachusetts Psychological Association and two chapters of Phi Beta Kappa.&lt;ref name="Ogilvie" /&gt; Furthermore, Alper created a measure to study achievement motivation in women, named the Wellesley Role Orientation Scale (WROS).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; She received a Career Contribution Award in 1975 from the MPA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.masspsych.org/?MPAAwards|title=MPA Awards - Massachusetts Psychological Association, Inc.|website=www.masspsych.org|access-date=2017-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Turkish Sign Language''' ({{lang-tr|Türk İşaret Dili, TİD}}) is the language used by the [[deaf]] community in [[Turkey]]. As with other [[sign languages]], TİD has a unique grammar that is different from the oral languages used in the region.

TİD uses a two-handed [[manual alphabet]] which is very different from the two-handed alphabets used in the [[BANZSL]] sign languages.

==Status==
There is little published information on Turkish Sign Language.

==Signing communities==
According to the [[Turkish Statistical Institute]], there are a total of 89,000 persons (54,000 male, 35,000 female) with [[hearing impairment]] and 55,000 persons (35,000 male, 21,000 female) with speaking disability living in Turkey, based on 2000 census data.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tuik.gov.tr/AltKategori.do?ust_id=11&amp;ust_adi=N%FCfus%2C+Konut+ve+Demografi Türkiye İstatistik Kurumu, Nüfus, Konut ve Demografi Verileri 2000]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
TİD is dissimilar from European sign languages. There was a [[Ottoman Sign Language|court sign language]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], which reached its height in the 16th century and 17th centuries and lasted at least until the early 20th.&lt;ref&gt;Miles, M. (2000). ''Signing in the Seraglio: Mutes, dwarfs and gestures at the Ottoman Court 1500-1700,'' Disability &amp; Society, Vol. 15, No. 1, 115-134&lt;/ref&gt; However, there is no record of the signs themselves and no evidence the language was ancestral to modern Turkish Sign Language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://turkisaretdili.ku.edu.tr/en/tid.aspx ''Turkish Sign Language (TİD) General Info''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415064343/http://turkisaretdili.ku.edu.tr/en/tid.aspx |date=2012-04-15 }}, Dr. Aslı Özyürek, Koç University website, accessed 2011-10-06&lt;/ref&gt;

Deaf schools were established in 1902, and until 1953 used TİD alongside the Turkish spoken and written language in education.&lt;ref&gt;Deringil, S. (2002). İktidarın Sembolleri ve İdeoloji: II. Abdülhamid Dönemi (1876–1909), YKY, İstanbul, 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1953 Turkey has adopted an [[Oralism|oralist]] approach to deaf education.
