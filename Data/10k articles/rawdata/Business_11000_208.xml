'''''American Psycho''''' is a 2000 Canadian-American&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://catalog.afi.com/Catalog/MovieDetails/67271|title=AFI{{!}}Catalog|website=catalog.afi.com|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/films-tv-people/4ce2b80720bbc|title=BFI{{!}}|website=bfi.org|language=en|access-date=2018-10-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[satirical]] [[black comedy]] [[psychological horror]] film co-written and directed by [[Mary Harron]], based on [[Bret Easton Ellis]]'s [[American Psycho|1991 novel of the same name]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |title=American Psycho (2000) |work=[[Allmovie]] |url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v184482 |accessdate=July 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It stars [[Christian Bale]], [[Willem Dafoe]], [[Jared Leto]], [[Josh Lucas]], [[Chloë Sevigny]], [[Samantha Mathis]], [[Cara Seymour]], [[Justin Theroux]], [[Guinevere Turner]], and [[Reese Witherspoon]].

Producer [[Edward R. Pressman]] purchased the film rights to the novel in 1992. After discussions with [[David Cronenberg]] fell through, Harron was brought on to direct and cast Bale in the lead role. Lionsgate acquired worldwide distribution in 1997 and temporarily replaced Harron and Bale with [[Oliver Stone]] as director and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] portraying Patrick Bateman. DiCaprio left in favor of ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'' and Harron and Bale were brought back. ''American Psycho'' debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]] on January 21, 2000, and was released theatrically on April 14, 2000. The film was a financial success and received generally positive reviews, with much of the praise directed to Bale's performance and the screenplay.

==Plot==
In 1987, wealthy New York investment banker [[Patrick Bateman]]'s life revolves around dining at trendy restaurants while keeping up appearances for his fiancée Evelyn and his circle of wealthy and shallow associates, most of whom he dislikes. Bateman describes the material accoutrements of his lifestyle, including his daily morning exercise, beautification routine, designer wardrobe and expensive furniture. He also discusses his music collection, which includes [[Huey Lewis and the News]], [[Phil Collins]] and [[Whitney Houston]].

Bateman and his associates flaunt their [[business card]]s in a display of vanity. Enraged by the superiority of co-worker Paul Allen's card, Bateman murders a homeless man and kills the man's dog. At a Christmas party, Bateman makes plans to have dinner with Allen, who mistakes Bateman for another coworker, Marcus Halberstram. Bateman gets Allen drunk and lures him back to his apartment. While playing "[[Hip to Be Square]]" on the stereo, Bateman delivers a monologue to Allen about the artistic merits of the song and of [[Huey Lewis and the News]], then murders him with a chrome axe. He disposes of Allen's body, and then goes to his apartment to stage the situation so that others believe Allen has run off to London.

Bateman is later interviewed about Allen's disappearance in his office by private detective Donald Kimball. During the night, Bateman takes two prostitutes, whom he names Christie and Sabrina, to his apartment and explains to them the improvement he saw in the band [[Genesis (band)|Genesis]] after they moved away from [[progressive rock]] toward a more pop rock sound beginning with the album ''[[Duke (album)|Duke]]''. After they have sex, Bateman tells them to stay, while taking out instruments he uses for bodily harm. In the next scene, they leave his apartment somewhat bloodied.

The next day, Bateman's colleague Louis Carruthers reveals his new business card. Bateman tries to kill Louis in the restroom of an expensive restaurant but cannot bring himself to strangle him. Luis mistakes the attempted murder for a sexual advance and declares his love for Bateman, who flees in disgust. After murdering a model, Bateman invites his secretary, Jean, to dinner, suggesting she meet him at his apartment for drinks before. When Jean arrives, Bateman, unbeknownst to her, holds a nailgun to the back of her head while the two converse. When he receives an answering machine message from his fiancée, Evelyn, he asks Jean to leave. Kimball meets Bateman for lunch and tells him he is not under suspicion.

Bateman later invites Christie and his acquaintance Elizabeth to Allen's apartment for sex, and kills Elizabeth during the act. Christie runs, discovering multiple female corpses in various rooms as she searches for an exit. A naked Bateman chases her while wielding a chainsaw, and drops it on her as she flees down a staircase, killing her.

Bateman breaks off his engagement with Evelyn. That night, as he uses an ATM, he finds a stray kitten. The ATM displays the text "feed me a stray cat". As he prepares to shoot the cat, a woman sees and tries to stop him; he shoots her and lets the cat go free. A police chase ensues but Bateman destroys the police cars by shooting their gas tanks. Fleeing to his office, Bateman enters the wrong office building, where he murders a security guard and a janitor. In an office he believes is his, Bateman calls his lawyer Harold and frantically leaves a lengthy confession on Harold's answering machine.

The following morning, Bateman visits Allen's apartment, expecting it to be full of decomposing bodies and in the middle of a police investigation, but it is vacant, freshly painted and for sale. The [[Real estate broker|realtor]] tells him to leave. As Bateman goes to meet with his colleagues and lawyer for lunch, a horrified Jean finds detailed drawings of murder, mutilation and rape in Bateman's office journal.

Bateman sees Harold at a restaurant and mentions the phone message he left the prior night. Harold mistakes Bateman for another colleague and laughs off the phone message confession as a joke, saying he had dinner with Allen in London days earlier. A confused Bateman returns to his friends. In a final voice-over narration, he realizes he will continue to escape the punishment he deserves, and that there has been no [[catharsis]]: "This confession has meant nothing".

==Production==
Producer Edward R. Pressman purchased the [[film rights]] to [[Bret Easton Ellis]]'s novel ''American Psycho'' in 1992, with [[Johnny Depp]] expressing an interest in the lead role.&lt;ref name=Norton/&gt; After discussions with [[Stuart Gordon]] to direct fell through, [[David Cronenberg]] became attached and brought Ellis to adapt the novel into a screenplay. The process was difficult for Ellis, due to Cronenberg's scene constraints and not wanting to use any of Ellis's restaurant or nightclub material from the novel. The script ended with an elaborate musical sequence to [[Barry Manilow]]'s "[[Daybreak (Barry Manilow song)|Daybreak]]" atop the [[World Trade Center (1973–2001)|World Trade Center]]. "I'm glad it wasn't shot, but that kind of shows you where I was when I was writing the script", Ellis reflected. "I was bored with the material."&lt;ref name=Movieline&gt;{{cite news|first=Kyle|last=Buchanan|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors|url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors/|work=Movieline.com|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 18, 2010|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cronenberg was still listed as being attached to direct in March 1994, but with a new script by [[Norman Snider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=David|last=Rooney |url= https://variety.com/1994/film/news/disney-wins-houston-and-washington-teaming-119623/|title=Disney wins Houston and Washington teaming …|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=March 2, 1994|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pressman appeared at the [[1996 Cannes Film Festival]] to pre-sell distribution rights, but to no avail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Peter Bart|url=https://variety.com/1997/voices/columns/fast-talkers-can-t-hold-a-candle-to-pressman-1117859584/|title=Fast-talkers can't hold a candle to Pressman|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 12, 1997|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mary Harron]] replaced Cronenberg as director while writing a new script with [[Guinevere Turner]]. Harron cast [[Christian Bale]] in a deal on good faith,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Steven|last=Gaydos|url=https://variety.com/1997/film/news/edgy-producer-chris-hanley-knows-how-to-work-biz-angles-1116676450/|title='Edgy' producer Chris Hanley knows how to work biz angles|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=July 24, 1997|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attached [[Willem Dafoe]] and [[Jared Leto]] in supporting roles. Development was looking to move forward following six years of rejection by Hollywood studios&lt;ref name="lions"&gt;{{cite news|first=Benedict|last=Carver |url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/lion-s-gate-to-fund-psycho-1117470459/|title=Lion's Gate to fund 'Psycho'|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 5, 1998|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; when independent Canadian distributor [[Lionsgate Films]] acquired worldwide distribution in April 1997.&lt;ref name="lions"/&gt; After having waited for a year, Bale and Harron were aiming to begin filming in August 1998 on a $6–10 million budget,&lt;ref name="lions"/&gt;&lt;ref name=castingleo&gt;{{cite news |first=Dan|last=Cox|url=https://variety.com/1998/more/news/casting-leo-has-harron-hesitant-1117471132/|title=Casting Leo has Harron hesitant|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 21, 1998|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; but Lionsgate instead pursued [[Edward Norton]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] for the lead role, arguing Bale was not famous enough.&lt;ref name=Norton/&gt; Lionsgate was still hoping to finalize a deal with Harron,&lt;ref name=castingleo/&gt; while Bale's handshake deal without a pay or play contract was let go. Harron refused to meet with DiCaprio, displeased as she specifically chose Bale and believed DiCaprio's screen presence would have been too boyish for Patrick Bateman. She also believed the actor's reputation as a teen idol following ''[[Romeo + Juliet]]'' and ''[[Titanic (1997 film)|Titanic]]'' would distract from ''American Psycho''{{'}}s production and tone.&lt;ref name=Norton/&gt;

Lionsgate was planning to increase the production budget to $40 million in the hopes of securing DiCaprio's $21 million asking price.&lt;ref name=payday&gt;{{cite news|first1=Dan|last1=Cox|first2=Benedict|last2=Carver|url=https://variety.com/1998/more/news/di-caprio-in-21-mil-payday-1117470905/|title=Di Caprio in $21 mil payday|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 17, 1998|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the [[1997 Cannes Film Festival]], a press release was issued that DiCaprio had taken the offer,&lt;ref name=castingleo/&gt; which was quickly rebutted by DiCaprio's manager, Rick Yorn, who claimed the actor had simply expressed interest in the part. Yorn also wanted to make clear that DiCaprio had no knowledge of the development history under Harron and Bale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Dan|last=Cox|url=https://variety.com/1998/film/news/leo-denies-lions-share-1117471309/|title=Leo denies Lions' share|work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]|publisher=Penske Media Corporation|location=Los Angeles, California|date=May 28, 1998|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; DiCaprio drafted a shortlist of replacement directors, including [[Oliver Stone]], [[Danny Boyle]], and [[Martin Scorsese]]. Working from a new script written by Matthew Markwalder, Stone was brought aboard, whom Harron called "probably the single worst single person to do it". The director wanted to eliminate the satire from Harron's script, emphasizing the psychological character traits of Patrick Bateman. However, Stone could not agree on the film's direction with DiCaprio, who decided to star in ''[[The Beach (film)|The Beach]]'' instead.&lt;ref name=Norton/&gt;

Bale remained committed, turning down other movie roles and auditions for nine months, confident DiCaprio would depart.&lt;ref name=Norton/&gt; Lionsgate made an offer to [[Ewan McGregor]], who turned it down after Bale personally urged him to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jonathan|last=Heaf|url = http://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/entertainment/articles/2011-04/26/gq-film-christian-bale-interview|title=Christian Bale: behind the mask|work=[[GQ]]|publisher=[[Condé Nast]]|location=New York City|date=April 26, 2011|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harron and Bale were eventually brought back under the agreement that the budget would not exceed $10 million.&lt;ref name=Norton&gt;{{cite news|first=Nina|last=Gopalan |url= https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/mar/24/fiction.breteastonellis| title=American Psycho: the story behind the film|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England|date=March 23, 2000|accessdate=February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale spent several months working out by himself, and then three hours a day with a trainer during pre-production, to achieve the proper physique for the [[narcissistic personality disorder|narcissistic]] Bateman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url =https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/06/artsfeatures| title = The method in my madness|work=[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England|date=April 6, 2000|accessdate=March 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The actor struggled with the role until he noticed [[Tom Cruise]] in an interview on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'', being struck by Cruise's energy and "intense friendliness with nothing behind the eyes".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Stuart|last=Heritage | url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2009/oct/23/tom-cruise-christian-bale-american-psycho|title=Who other than Tom Cruise has inspired Christian Bale? |work =[[The Guardian]]|publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England|date=October 23, 2009|accessdate = February 24, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bale also used [[Nicolas Cage]]'s performance in ''[[Vampire's Kiss]]'' as inspiration for this role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Harrison |last=Cheung| title=Christian Bale: The Inside Story of the Darkest Batman |year=2012 |publisher=BenBella Books |location=Dallas, Texas| isbn=1936661640 |page=166}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming began in March 1999 in Toronto, Canada.&lt;ref name="Norton" /&gt;

==Marketing==
As promotion, one could register to receive e-mails "from" Patrick Bateman, supposedly to his [[Therapy|therapist]].&lt;ref name="Howell"&gt;{{cite news |first= Peter| last= Howell | title=''American Psycho''s Web Promo Sickens Star | work=[[Toronto Star]] | location=Toronto, Ontario, Canada|date=March 8, 2000 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The e-mails, written by a writer attached to the film and approved by the book's author Bret Easton Ellis, follow Bateman's life since the events of the film. He discusses such developments as his marriage to (and impending divorce settlement with) his former secretary, Jean, his complete adoration of his son, Patrick Jr., and his efforts to triumph over his business rivals. The e-mails also describe or mention interactions with other characters from the novel, including Timothy Price (Bryce in the film version), Evelyn, Luis, Courtney, David, Detective Kimball, and Marcus. However, the film's star, Christian Bale, was not happy with this kind of marketing: "My main objection is that some people think it will be me returning those e-mails. I don't like that ... I think the movie stands on its own merits and should attract an audience that can appreciate intelligent satire. It's not a slasher flick, but it's also not ''[[American Pie (film)|American Pie]]''. The marketing should reflect that."&lt;ref name="Howell"/&gt;

Lionsgate spent $50,000 on an online stock market game, ''Make a Killing with American Psycho'', which invited players to invest in films, actors, or musicians using fake Hollywood money. This marketing ploy did little to help the film's box office but the studio's co-president [[Tom Ortenberg]] still claimed that it was a success: "The aim was to gain exposure and awareness for the picture, and we did that," he said. "Lionsgate will make a tidy profit on the picture."&lt;ref name="guardian"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/may/05/news1 | title=Greed appeal fails to lift ''American Psycho'' | work=[[The Guardian]] | publisher=Guardian Media Group|location=London, England| date=5 May 2000 | accessdate=7 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
The [[Soundtrack album|soundtrack for the film]] was [[Film score|scored]] by [[John Cale]], with artists such as [[David Bowie]], [[The Cure]], and [[New Order (band)|New Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=American Psycho|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0144084/soundtrack|website=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Huey Lewis and the News]] song "[[Hip to Be Square]]" appears in the film and was initially intended to be on the soundtrack album, but was removed from the album due to lack of publishing rights.&lt;ref name=guardian2&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/apr/13/news |title=''American Psycho'' soundtrack in hot water |work=[[The Guardian]] |publisher=Guardian Media Group| location=London, England| date=13 April 2000 |accessdate=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, [[Entertainment One Music|Koch Records]] was forced to recall approximately 100,000 copies of the album which were destroyed.

They just went ahead and put the cut on there.

==Release==
''American Psycho'' premiered at the 2000 [[Sundance Film Festival]].&lt;ref name=guardian3&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=''American Psycho'' hits Sundance |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2000-01-26 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/jan/26/sundancefilmfestival2000.festivals |accessdate=2010-07-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Motion Picture Association of America]] (MPAA) initially gave the film an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|NC-17]] rating for a scene featuring Bateman having a [[threesome]] with two prostitutes. The producers excised approximately 18 seconds of footage to obtain an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] version of the film.&lt;ref name=guardian4&gt;{{cite news |last= |first= |title=''American Psycho'' cut to appease censors|work=[[The Guardian]] |date=2000-02-29 |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2000/feb/29/news |accessdate=2010-07-27 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''American Psycho'' debuted at the [[Sundance Film Festival]], where it polarized audiences and critics; some showered the film with praise for its writing and performance from Christian Bale, others with criticism for its violent nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/09/movies/film-the-risky-territory-of-american-psycho.html|title=The Risky Territory of American Psycho|last=|first=|date=|website=NY Times|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon its theatrical release, however, the film received positive reviews in crucial publications, including ''[[The New York Times]]'' which called it a "mean and lean horror comedy classic".&lt;ref name="holden"&gt;{{cite news|last=Holden|first=Stephen|url=https://www.nytimes.com/library/film/041400psycho-film-review.html|title=Murderer!

It becomes more grisly and surreal, but not more interesting".&lt;ref name="ansen"&gt;{{cite news|last=Ansen|first=David|url=http://www.newsweek.com/id/83755|title=What A Total Psychopath|work=[[Newsweek]]|date=April 17, 2000|accessdate=2009-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In his review for ''[[The Village Voice]]'', [[J. Hoberman]] wrote, "If anything, Bale is too knowing. He eagerly works within the constraints of the quotation marks Harron puts around his performance".&lt;ref name="hoberman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hoberman|first=J|url=http://www.villagevoice.com/2000-04-11/film/atrocity-exhibitions/1|title=Atrocity Exhibitions|work=[[Village Voice]]|date=April 11, 2000|accessdate=2009-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Rolling Stone]]''{{'}}s [[Peter Travers]] wrote, "whenever Harron digs beneath the glitzy surface in search of feelings that haven't been desensitized, the horrific and hilarious ''American Psycho'' can still strike a raw nerve".&lt;ref name="travers"&gt;{{cite news|last=Travers|first=Peter|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947999/review/5948000/american_psycho|title=''American Psycho''|work=[[Rolling Stone]]|date=December 8, 2000|accessdate=2009-04-08|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090329095830/http://www.rollingstone.com/reviews/movie/5947999/review/5948000/american_psycho| archivedate=March 29, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a somewhat positive review for [[Slate (magazine)|''Slate'']] magazine, [[David Edelstein]] noted the toned-down brutality and sexual content in comparison to the novel and wrote that the moment where Bateman spares his secretary is when "this one-dimensional film blossoms like a flower".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/arts/movies/2000/04/dressed_to_kill.html|title=Dressed to Kill|last=|first=|date=|website=Slate Magazine|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Owen Gleiberman]] gave the film an "A&amp;minus;" rating, writing for ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'': "By treating the book as raw material for an exuberantly perverse exercise in '[[80s Nostalgia]], [Harron] recasts the go-go years as a template for the casually brainwashing-consumer/fashion/image culture that emerged from them. She has made a movie that is really a parable of today."&lt;ref name="gleiberman"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gleiberman |first=Owen |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,275891,00.html |title=''American Psycho'' |work=[[Entertainment Weekly]] |date=April 14, 2000 |accessdate=2009-04-08 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090328224921/http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0%2C%2C275891%2C00.html |archivedate=March 28, 2009 |deadurl=no }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine's Richard Corliss wrote, "Harron and co-screenwriter [[Guinevere Turner]] do understand the book, and they want their film to be understood as a period [[comedy of manners]]".&lt;ref name="corliss"&gt;{{cite news|last=Corliss|first=Richard|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,996639,00.html|title=A Yuppie's Killer Instinct|work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=April 17, 2000|accessdate=2009-04-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bloody Disgusting]] ranked the film at No. 19 in its list of the "Top 20 Horror Films of the Decade", with the article praising "Christian Bale's disturbing/darkly hilarious turn as serial killer/Manhattan businessman Patrick Bateman, a role that in hindsight couldn't have been played by any other actor. ... At its best, the film reflects our own narcissism, and the shallow American culture it was spawned from, with piercing effectiveness. Much of the credit for this can go to director Mary Harron, whose off-kilter tendencies are a good complement to Ellis' unique style."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18403|title=00's Retrospect: Bloody Disgusting's Top 20 Films of the Decade...Part 4|publisher=[[Bloody Disgusting]]|accessdate=2010-01-03|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100208164216/http://www.bloody-disgusting.com/news/18403|archivedate=February 8, 2010 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Author Ellis said, "''American Psycho'' was a book I didn't think needed to be turned into a movie", as "the medium of film demands answers", which would make the book "infinitely less interesting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://clatl.com/culturesurfing/archives/2010/06/19/1534716-bret-easton-ellis-talks-film-adaptations-at-scad |title=Bret Easton Ellis talks film adaptations at SCAD |publisher=[[Creative Loafing]] |accessdate=2010-06-19 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100624060251/http://clatl.com/culturesurfing/archives/2010/06/19/1534716-bret-easton-ellis-talks-film-adaptations-at-scad |archivedate=June 24, 2010 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said that while the book attempted to add ambiguity to the events and to Bateman's reliability as a narrator, the film appeared to make them completely literal before confusing the issue at the very end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Buchanan|first=Kyle|url=http://movieline.com/2010/05/18/bret-easton-ellis-on-american-psycho-christian-bale-and-his-problem-with-women-directors/|title=Bret Easton Ellis on American Psycho, Christian Bale, and His Problem with Women Directors|publisher=Movieline|date=2010-05-18|accessdate=2013-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a 2014 appearance on the ''[[WTF with Marc Maron]]'' podcast, Ellis indicated that his feelings towards the film were more mixed than negative; he reiterated his opinion that his conception of Bateman as an unreliable narrator did not make an entirely successful transition from page to screen, adding that Bateman's narration was so unreliable that even ''he'', as the author of the book, didn't know if Bateman was honestly describing events that actually happened or if he was lying or even hallucinating. However, Ellis appreciated that the film clarified the humor for audiences who mistook the novel's violence for blatant misogyny as opposed to the deliberately exaggerated satire he'd intended, and liked that it gave his novel "a second life" in introducing it to new readers. Ultimately, Ellis said "the movie was okay, the movie was fine. I just didn't think it needed to be made."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wtfpod.com/podcast/episodes/episode_552_-_bret_easton_ellis|title=WTF with Marc Maron Podcast   - Episode 552 - Bret Easton Ellis|work=wtfpod.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film currently holds a 68% "Fresh" rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]]; the consensus states "If it falls short of the deadly satire of Bret Easton Ellis's novel, ''American Psycho'' still finds its own blend of horror and humor, thanks in part to a fittingly creepy performance by Christian Bale."&lt;ref&gt;{{rotten-tomatoes|american_psycho|American Psycho}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A special-edition [[DVD]] was released on July 21, 2005.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ign.com/movies/american-psycho/dvd-758290&lt;/ref&gt; In the U.S., two versions of the film have been released: an [[Motion Picture Association of America film rating system|R-rated]] and unrated version. For the edited version and R-rated cinematic release in the U.S., the producers excised about 18 seconds of footage from a scene featuring Bateman having a [[threesome]] with two [[prostitutes]]. Some dialogue was also edited: Bateman orders a prostitute, Christie, to bend over so that another, Sabrina, can "see your asshole", which was edited to "see your ass". The unedited version also shows Bateman receiving [[oral sex]] from Christie. The uncut version was released on [[Blu-ray]] on February 6, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blu-ray.com/movies/American-Psycho-Blu-ray/135/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
Independent musician [[Miles Fisher]] covered the "[[This Must Be the Place (Naive Melody)]]" on his self-titled 2009 EP, ''Miles Fisher''. The music video is an homage to ''American Psycho'', with Fisher imitating Christian Bale's performance as Patrick Bateman.

The film's influence can be seen in [[Kanye West]]'s music video "[[Love Lockdown]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last=Vena | first=Jocelyn | title=Kanye West Says 'Love Lockdown' Video Was Inspired By ''American Psycho'' | url=http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1596504/20081007/west_kanye.jhtml | work=[[MTV]] | date=October 7, 2008 | accessdate=2009-04-08 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090301142619/http://www.mtv.com/news/articles/1596504/20081007/west_kanye.jhtml| archivedate=March 1, 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The film has generated various academic work that examines the film as a form of social critique.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first=David | last=Robinson | title=The unattainable narrative: identity, consumerism and the slasher film in Mary Harron's ''American Psycho'' | url=http://michael-miller.wiki.uml.edu/file/view/the+unattainable+narrative-american+psycho.pdf | work=CineAction | year=2006 | access-date=September 7, 2011 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402073824/http://michael-miller.wiki.uml.edu/file/view/the+unattainable+narrative-american+psycho.pdf | archive-date=April 2, 2012 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sequel===
A [[direct-to-video]] [[sequel]], ''[[American Psycho 2]]'', directed by [[Morgan J. Freeman]] and starring [[Mila Kunis]], was released in 2002. The sequel's only connection with the original is the death of Patrick Bateman (played by Michael Kremko wearing a face mask), briefly shown in a flashback. The film was denounced by ''American Psycho'' author [[Bret Easton Ellis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =http://movies.ign.com/articles/304/304429p1.html| title=Bret Easton Ellis Speaks Out  | publisher=IGN | date=August 21, 2001 |accessdate = August 22, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, star Mila Kunis expressed embarrassment over the film, and spoke out against the idea of a sequel. "Please—somebody stop this", she said. "Write a petition. When I did the second one, I didn't know it would be ''American Psycho II''. It was supposed to be a different project, and it was re-edited, but, ooh&amp;nbsp;... I don't know. Bad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtv.com/news/1501371/mila-kunis-career-thrives-despite-psycho-in-her-past/|title=Mila Kunis' Career Thrives Despite 'Psycho' In Her Past|date=May 6, 2005|accessdate=February 10, 2016|publisher=MTV|author=Harris, Chris}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The therapeutic focus of Amicus is on [[Rare disease|rare and orphan diseases]], particularly disorders collectively called [[Lysosomal storage disease|lysosomal storage disorders]].&lt;ref name="10K2014" /&gt;{{rp|2}}  The company has focused on [[pharmacological chaperone]]s and [[enzyme replacement therapy]].&lt;ref name="10K2014" /&gt;{{rp|2,18}}&lt;ref name="williams2014"&gt;{{cite book | author=Williams, Cory | editor=Pryde, David C. | editor2=Palmer, Michael J. | title=Orphan Drugs and Rare Diseases | chapter=Chapter 4. Treating Rare Diseases: Business Model for Orphan Drug Development | publisher=[[Royal Society of Chemistry]] | year=2014 | ISBN=9781849738064 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|95}}

In 2008, the company expanded from its single site in New Jersey to a second research site in [[San Diego]].&lt;ref name="biotechweek2008"&gt;{{cite news | title=Amicus Therapeutics Opens Research Facility in San Diego. | author=Staff | date=1 Oct 2008 | url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-185777890.html | work=[[Biotech Week]] | location=United States | via=[[HighBeam Research]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 2009, the company faced a major financial setback with the termination of a multi-year collaboration agreement with [[Shire (pharmaceutical company)|Shire]] for its lead compound, [[migalastat]], and two other products.&lt;ref name="10Q2009Q3"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1178879/000095012309057623/c91935e10vq.htm | title=Form 10-Q: Amicus Therapeutics, Inc. | date=30 Sep 2009 | publisher=[[USSEC]] | website=[[EDGAR]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|24}}  Amicus cut 20% of its workforce.&lt;ref name="10Q2009Q3" /&gt;{{rp|24}}

The next year, the company signed an exclusive license agreement with [[GlaxoSmithKline]] for miglastat; GSK paid $60 million in upfront and equity payments while promising up to $170 million to help developother products,&lt;ref name="carroll2013"&gt;{{cite news | author=Carroll, John | title=GlaxoSmithKline politely dumps $230M Fabry drug deal with Amicus | date=20 Nov 2013 | work=FierceBiotech | url=http://www.fiercebiotech.com/story/glaxosmithkline-politely-dumps-230m-fabry-drug-deal-amicus/2013-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; GSK terminated the arrangement in 2013.&lt;ref name="carroll2013" /&gt;

In November 2013, Amicus acquired competitor Callidus Biopharma for its enzyme replacement therapy treatment for [[Pompe disease]].&lt;ref name="10K2014" /&gt;{{rp|3,12}}

In September 2015, the company acquired [[Scioderm]] for $229 million in cash and stock, with potentially $618 million more in [[biodollar]]s. Scioderm had a drug in Phase III trials for [[epidermolysis bullosa]]; additionally, if the drug was approved the FDA would give its owner a [[priority review voucher]], which itself can be sold to another company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Fidler|first1=Ben|title=Xconomy: With $229M Deal, Amicus Gets a New Drug And Perhaps a Voucher|url=https://www.xconomy.com/new-york/2015/08/31/with-229m-deal-amicus-gets-a-new-drug-and-maybe-a-voucher/?single_page=true|work=Xconomy|date=31 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That drug failed its Phase III trial in 2017 and Amicus abandoned it.

Also in September 2015, Amicus announced that it would submit a [[new drug application]] (NDA) for [[Accelerated approval (FDA)|accelerated approval]] of [[migalastat]] to the FDA by the end of 2015.&lt;ref name="NDA"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.drugs.com/nda/migalastat_150915.html|publisher=[[Drugs.com]]|title=Amicus Therapeutics Plans to Submit NDA for Migalastat for Fabry Disease Following Positive Pre-NDA Meeting With FDA|date=15 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  An FDA committee recommended approval in April 2016, but the FDA rejected the application in November for having insufficient data in November 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Ben|title=FDA rejects quick Amicus Fabry drug read-through, new data not expected till 2019|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/fda-rejects-quick-amicus-fabry-drug-read-through-new-data-not-expected-til-2019|work=FierceBiotech|date=November 29, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The drug was approved in the European Union in May 2016.&lt;ref name="Newswire"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2016/05/31/844646/0/en/Amicus-Therapeutics-Announces-European-Commission-Approval-for-Galafold-Migalastat-in-Patients-with-Fabry-Disease-in-European-Union.html|title=Amicus Therapeutics Announces European Commission Approval for Galafold (Migalastat) in Patients with Fabry Disease in European Union|publisher=GlobeNewswire|date=31 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

In 2016 Amicus acquired MiaMed which was working on drugs to treat [[CDKL5]] deficiency; Amicus paid $1.8M in cash and around $4.7M in stock, with $83M in biodollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Adams|first1=Ben|title=Amicus spends $90M on MiaMed; gains rare disease preclinical program|url=https://www.fiercebiotech.com/biotech/amicus-spends-90m-miamed-gains-rare-disease-preclinical-program|work=FierceBiotech|date=July 7, 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Scott Gottlieb]] became FDA commissioner in 2017, the CEO of Amicus began lobbying him directly for the FDA to accept the NDA and in February 2018 the FDA accepted it and promised a response by August 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carroll|first1=John|title=Once rejected, FDA now rolls out a short red carpet for Amicus’ migalastat|url=https://endpts.com/once-rejected-fda-now-rolls-out-a-short-red-carpet-for-amicus-migalastat/|work=Endpoints|date=February 12, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2018, Amicus announced that it had acquired Celenex, which had ten early stage gene therapies. Amicus paid $100 million upfront and could pay an additional $352 million if developmental milestones are achieved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/matthewherper/2018/09/20/a-100-million-biotech-deal-is-also-a-tale-of-two-executives-facing-their-kids-deadly-diseases/#6ee26df82aad|title=A $100 Million Biotech Deal Is Also A Tale Of Two Executives Facing Their Kids' Deadly Diseases|last=Herper|first=Matthew|work=Forbes|access-date=2018-09-24|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Asociación de Inspectores de Educación''' (ADIDE) is a Spanish professional association of [[education]] supervisors. By the number of its members it is the most important association of these professionals in [[Spain]]: nowadays, 950 out of 1600 Spanish Inspectors of Education are members of ADIDE, while the rest of them are either unassociated or splitting their membership into several different [[professional association|associations]] and [[Trade union|unions]].

== Background ==

Educational professionals usually group themselves either in unions, professional associations or professional organizations. Unions have as their main aim the defence of the [[Employment|labour]] conditions of their members. Professional associations deal with the performance of the Code of Professional [[Ethics]] established by the association. Professional associations, like ADIDE, can have as well as the previous interests, some different aims and concerns, such as ensuring the professional development of members through suitable formation and [[training]], the organization of scientific meetings and congresses, and the [[publishing]] of professional magazines and books.

The [[Inspectorate]] of Education is a body (or two, actually) of [[civil servants]] of about 1600 people in Spain. This body of inspectors supervise all the [[Education in Spain|Spanish education system]] except the [[Spanish universities|university studies]]. Every inspector is usually in charge of several [[schools]] and other [[educational institutions]], and performs his/her duties according to an annual Inspection Plan. Quite often, however inspectors have to tackle with all kind of incidents and unscheduled situations which requires much attention from them.

== Founding ==

After the establishment of [[democracy]], the Spanish education system undertook very important changes in the 1980s, a time when a significant group of teachers and school administrators started to carry out the supervision function of schools. The already existing associations of inspectors of education at that time did not ensure the professional development of the new inspectors, so it was necessary for them to found a new association. ADIDE was created in 1990 and soon started to replace the absence of unions to achieve the promotion of professional interests and helping to put into practice the new educational policies as settled in the [[Education reform]] provided by the Organic Act of General Organization of the Educational System 1990.

Initially, ADIDE was a unique national organization for the whole of Spain, but due to the Association Act 2005, it had to adopt a [[Federation|federated]] [[structure]], which provoked some problems of interaction on the very first moments. The new technologies and members’ cooperation worked well to maintain a good level of coordination among all the federal associations, one for every one of the [[Autonomous communities of Spain|Spanish Autonomous Regions]], which hold a high level of independence in educational matters. The federated association is since then known as ADIDE-Federación, while every autonomous region association is known by the name of ADIDE followed by the name of the region it operates on.

The '''Basilica of the National Shrine of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary''', also called the '''Baltimore Basilica''', was the first [[Roman Catholic]] [[cathedral]] built in the [[United States]], and was among the first major [[church (building)|religious buildings]] constructed in the nation after the adoption of the [[United States Constitution|U.S. Constitution]].  As a [[co-cathedral]], it is one of the seats of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Baltimore]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]]. Additionally it is a [[parish church]] (ranked [[minor basilica]]) and [[national shrine]]. It is considered the masterpiece of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], the "Father of American Architecture".

==History==
The [[Basilica]] was constructed between 1806 and 1863 to a design of [[Benjamin Henry Latrobe]], America's first professionally trained architect &lt;ref&gt;See Leland M. Roth, ''Understanding Architecture: Its Elements, History and Meaning''. Boulder, Col.: Westview Press, 1993 .&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Jefferson]]'s [[Architect of the Capitol|Architect of the U.S. Capitol]].&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://americasfirstcathedral.org/history "A Brief History of the Basilica", The Baltimore Basilica]&lt;/ref&gt; It was built under the guidance of the first American bishop of the [[Roman Catholic Church]], [[John Carroll (bishop)|John Carroll]].  The Basilica was blessed and opened for use on May 31, 1821, by the third Archbishop of Baltimore, [[Ambrose Maréchal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Maryland History in Prints 1743-1900|page=88|author=Laura Rice}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was consecrated on May 25, 1876 by Archbishop [[James Roosevelt Bayley]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://americasfirstcathedral.org/history/timeline|title=Timeline|date=October 25, 2013|access-date=January 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many famous events have occurred within its walls, including the funeral Mass of [[Charles Carroll of Carrollton]], the only Catholic signatory of the [[United States Declaration of Independence|Declaration of Independence]]. Carroll had been the last of the surviving signers.  Most of the first American bishops were consecrated here to fill the ever-multiplying dioceses necessitated by the young country's territorial expansion and great waves of immigration. Until recent years, more priests were ordained at the Baltimore Basilica than in any other church in the United States.

The building hosted many of the 19th century meetings that shaped the Catholic Church in America, including seven [[Ecclesiastical province|Provincial Councils]] and three [[Plenary Councils of Baltimore|Plenary Councils]].&lt;ref name=History/&gt; Among other effects, these led to the founding of [[The Catholic University of America]] and efforts to evangelize African and Native Americans to Catholicism. The [[Third Plenary Council]], which was the largest meeting of Catholic bishops held outside [[Rome]] since the [[Council of Trent]], commissioned the [[Baltimore Catechism]].

In 1937, [[Pope Pius XI]] raised the Cathedral to the rank of a [[Minor Basilica]]. It was listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] in 1969,&lt;ref name="nris"/&gt; and two years later was declared a [[National Historic Landmark]].&lt;ref name="nhlsum"/&gt; In 1993, the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]] designated the Basilica as a National Shrine.

The [[Cathedral Hill Historic District (Baltimore, Maryland)|Cathedral Hill Historic District]] takes its name from the Basilica being located there.&lt;ref name="mht_ihp"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mht.maryland.gov/secure/medusa/PDF/NR_PDFs/NR-977.pdf |title=National Register of Historic Places Registration: Cathedral Hill Historic District|date=August 1985|accessdate=2016-03-01 |author=Janet Davis|publisher=Maryland Historical Trust}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people deemed holy by the Catholic Church are associated with the Basilica, including the [[Servant of God]] [[Mother Mary Lange]], Foundress of the [[Oblate Sisters of Providence]], the first order for Catholic nuns of African-American descent;&lt;ref name=History/&gt; the [[The Venerable|Venerable]] Father [[Michael J. McGivney]], founder of the [[Knights of Columbus]], who was ordained at the Basilica in 1877 by Archbishop [[James Gibbons]]; and St. [[John Neumann]], who is credited with founding America's Catholic school system.

The Basilica has welcomed millions of visitors, including Pope Saint [[Pope John Paul II|John Paul II]] in 1995, [[Mother Teresa|Saint Teresa of Calcutta]] in 1996, and Ecumenical [[Patriarch Bartholomew I of Constantinople]] in 1997. The building has also been visited by at least 20 other saints or potential saints.

==Architecture==
The Cathedral is a monumental [[neoclassical architecture|neoclassical]]-style building designed in conformity to a [[Latin cross]] [[basilica]] plan — a departure on Latrobe's part from previous American church architecture, but in keeping with longstanding European traditions of cathedral design. The plan unites two distinct elements: a longitudinal axis and a domed space.

===Exterior===
[[File:Baltimore Basilica Oculus.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Interior of the dome]]
The main facade is a classical [[Greek temple|Greek portico]] with [[Ionic order|Ionic columns]] arranged in double [[hexastyle]] pattern, immediately behind which rise a pair of cylindrical towers. Architectural historian [[Henry-Russell Hitchcock]] believed that the [[Onion dome|onion-shaped dome]]s atop the two towers were “not of Latrobe's design,” but now it is believed that they "were entirely the architect's own." &lt;ref name="Mckee"/&gt;
The exterior walls are constructed of silver-gray [[gneiss]] quarried from the [[Ellicott City Granodiorite]].&lt;ref name=MDGSVol2&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=KxEMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PP1#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Maryland Geological Survey Volume 2], 1898, The Johns Hopkins Press, Baltimore.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dome===
Latrobe originally planned a masonry dome with a lantern on top, but his friend [[Thomas Jefferson]] suggested a wooden double-shell dome&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

  | title =  Latrobe’s Baltimore Basilica to Celebrate 200th Birthday
  | journal = AIA Architect
  | date = April 14, 2006
  | url = http://www.aia.org/aiarchitect/thisweek06/0414/0414pw_baltbasilica.cfm
  | postscript = &lt;!--None--&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (of a type pioneered by French master builder [[Philibert Delorme]]) with 24 half-visible skylights. For the inner dome Latrobe created a solid, classically detailed masonry hemisphere. Grids of plaster rosettes adorn its [[coffered]] ceiling.

===Interior===
The interior is occupied by a massive dome at the [[Crossing (architecture)|crossing]] of the Latin cross plan, creating a centralizing effect which contrasts the exterior impression of a linear or oblong building. Surrounding the main dome is a sophisticated system of barrel vaults and shallow, saucer-like secondary domes.
The light-filled interior designed by Latrobe was striking in contrast to the dark, cavernous recesses of traditional Gothic cathedrals.

The Basilica houses many precious works of art, including two heroic portraits:  the first depicts the [[Descent from the Cross]] by [[Pierre-Narcisse Guérin]]  and the second,  by [[Charles de Steuben|Baron Charles de Steuben]],    depicts [[Louis IX of France]]  burying his plague-stricken troops before the siege of [[Tunis]] at the beginning of the [[Eighth Crusade]] in 1270.   Both portraits were gifts of [[Louis XVIII of France|King Louis XVIII of France]] shortly after the 1821 opening of the Basilica.

===21st-century restoration===
[[File:Baltimore Basilica main aisle.JPG|thumb|upright=1.4|Looking toward the altar]]
A 32-month, $34 million restoration project was completed in 2006. The restoration included a total incorporation of modern systems throughout the building, while also restoring the interior to Latrobe's original design. Many "misguided accretions" were corrected.&lt;ref name="Mckee"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The original wall colors (pale yellow, blue, and rose) were restored, as was the light-colored marble flooring which for decades had been a dark green color. Twenty-four skylights in the main dome were re-opened, and the stained glass windows (installed in the 1940s) were given to St. Louis parish in [[Clarksville, Maryland|Clarksville]] (whose new church was designed around them) and replaced with clear glass windows.&lt;ref name="stl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stlouisparish.org/stained-glass-windows/|title=Stained Glass Windows|publisher=St. Louis Parish|accessdate=September 26, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sun.windows"&gt;{{cite news|newspaper=Baltimore Sun|title=Fate of windows determined: Archdiocese to move stained-glass designs to Howard parish|date=July 15, 2002|first=Edward|last=Gunts|url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2002-07-15/features/0207150309_1_new-church-stained-glass-windows-saint-louis|accessdate=September 29, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the Basilica's crypt was made accessible to the public, as well as the expansive masonry [[undercroft]] (basement) of the church.  The undercroft, until 2006, had been filled with sand from the original building of the cathedral, which prevented Carroll and Latrobe's vision of a Chapel in the undercroft. During the restoration, the tons of sand were removed, and the [[Seat of Wisdom|''Our Lady Seat of Wisdom'']] Chapel was finally realized.

[[William Henry Keeler|Cardinal William Keeler]], then Archbishop of Baltimore, and one of the many champions of the restoration project, completed the restoration without dipping into the coffers of the Archdiocese, instead using private funds donated for the sole purpose of the restoration. The Basilica was closed to the public from November 2004 through November 2006, reopening in time for the Basilica's Bicentennial and the biannual meeting of the [[United States Conference of Catholic Bishops]], which was held in Baltimore to mark the occasion.

'''2011 Earthquake'''

On Aug, 24, 2011, an earthquake that jolted the East Coast from Georgia to Quebec rattled through the Basilica, sending nearly 1,000 linear feet of cracks through its ceilings and walls. A seven-month, $3 million restoration was completed on Easter Sunday 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/bs-md-basilica-easter-20130330-story.html|title=On Easter, Baltimore basilica is born again|last=Sun|first=Jonathan Pitts, The Baltimore|work=baltimoresun.com|access-date=January 26, 2018|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Big Oil''' is a name used to describe the world's six or seven largest [[List of corporations by market capitalization#Publicly traded companies|publicly traded]] [[list of oil companies|oil and gas companies]], also known as '''supermajors'''.&lt;ref name=reut1808&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2008/08/01/us-oilmajors-production-idUSL169721220080801|title=Oil majors' output growth hinges on strategy shift|accessdate=28 April 2011|publisher=Reuters|date=1 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt2206&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/02/02/business/worldbusiness/02iht-shell.html|title=Shell will invest despite decline in earnings|accessdate=28 April 2011|publisher=The New York Times|date=2 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bw29906&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2005-12-11/conocophillips-the-making-of-an-oil-major|accessdate=2016-04-01|title=ConocoPhillips: The Making Of An Oil Major|date=12 December 2005|work=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nafta - Volume 56 - Page 447  2005 "Tom Nicholls, editor, Petroleum Economist, writes WHOEVER coined the term supermajor should have kept some superlatives in reserve.

In the [[Merchant navy|maritime]] industry, six to seven large oil companies that decide a majority of the [[crude oil tanker]] [[Chartering (shipping)|chartering]] business are called '''"Oil Majors"'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=TEN wins long-term suezmax charter with an oil major|url=http://www.lloydslist.com/ll/sector/tankers/article474631.ece|accessdate=6 December 2015|publisher=Lloyds List|date=1 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The history of the supermajors traces back to the "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)|Seven Sisters]]", the seven oil companies which formed the "[[Consortium for Iran]]" cartel and dominated the global [[petroleum industry]] from the mid-1940s to the 1970s.&lt;ref name="ft"&gt;[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/471ae1b8-d001-11db-94cb-000b5df10621.html The new Seven Sisters: oil and gas giants dwarf western rivals], by Carola Hoyos, Financial Times. 11 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,946053-1,00.html|title=Business: The Seven Sisters Still Rule|accessdate=24 October 2010|publisher=Time|date=11 September 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Seven Sisters were:
* [[Anglo-Persian Oil Company]] (now [[BP]]);
* [[Gulf Oil]], [[Standard Oil of California|Standard Oil of California (Socal)]] and [[Texaco]] (now [[Chevron Corporation|Chevron]]);
* [[Royal Dutch Shell]]; and
* [[Standard Oil of New Jersey|Standard Oil of New Jersey (Esso)]] and [[Standard Oil Company of New York|Standard Oil Company of New York (Socony)]] (now [[ExxonMobil]]).
Before the [[oil crisis of 1973]] the members of the Seven Sisters controlled around 85% of the world's [[oil reserves]].
The supermajors began to emerge in the late-1990s, in response to a severe fall in [[oil prices]]. Large petroleum companies began to merge, often in an effort to improve [[economies of scale]], hedge against oil [[volatility (finance)|price volatility]], and reduce large cash reserves through reinvestment.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite news

|title=Slick Deal?
|publisher=''[[NewsHour with Jim Lehrer]]''
|date=1998-12-01
|accessdate=2007-08-20}}
&lt;/ref&gt;
The following major mergers and acquisitions of oil and gas companies took place between 1998 and 2002:
* Exxon's merger with [[Mobil]] in 1999, forming ExxonMobil;
* Total's merger with [[Petrofina]] in 1999 and with [[Elf Aquitaine]] in 2000, with the resulting company subsequently renamed Total S.A.;
* BP's acquisitions of [[Amoco]] in 1998 and of [[ARCO]] in 2000;
* Chevron's acquisition of [[Texaco]] in 2001;
* the merger of [[Conoco Inc.]] and [[Phillips Petroleum Company]] in 2002, forming [[ConocoPhillips]].
This process of consolidation created some of the largest global corporations as defined by the [[Forbes Global 2000]] ranking, and as of 2007 all were within the top 25. Between 2004 and 2007 the profits of the six supermajors totaled US$494.8 billion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://money.cnn.com/magazines/fortune/global500/2008/ Global 500], ''Fortune'' website, accessed Aug. 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Composition ==
Trading under various names around the world, the supermajors are considered to be:&lt;ref name=reut1808/&gt;

* [[BP|BP plc]] ([[United Kingdom]])
* [[Chevron Corporation]] ([[United States]])
* [[Eni|Eni SpA]] ([[Italy]])
* [[ExxonMobil|ExxonMobil Corporation]] ([[United States]])
* [[Royal Dutch Shell|Royal Dutch Shell plc]] ([[Netherlands]] and [[United Kingdom]])
* [[Total SA]] ([[France]])

[[ConocoPhillips Company]] ([[United States]]) was also sometimes described as forming part of the group,&lt;ref name=bw29906/&gt; before the Downstream activities spin-off. As of 2011 ExxonMobil ranked first among the supermajors measured by market capitalization, cash flow and profits.&lt;ref&gt;[[Forbes Global 2000#2011 list|Forbes Global 2000 – 2011 list]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[List of corporations by market capitalization#Publicly traded companies|FT list of top Publicly Traded companies]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As a group, the supermajors control around 6% of global [[Oil reserves|oil]] and [[Gas reserves|gas]] reserves. Conversely, 88% of global oil and gas reserves are controlled by the [[OPEC]] [[cartel]] and [[National oil company|state-owned oil companies]], primarily located in the Middle East.&lt;ref name="EIA"&gt;{{cite journal | author=Energy Information Administration | title=Who are the major players supplying the world oil market? | year=2009 | url=http://tonto.eia.doe.gov/energy_in_brief/world_oil_market.cfm}}&lt;/ref&gt; A trend of increasing influence of the OPEC cartel, state-owned oil companies&lt;ref name="ft"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.timeslive.co.za/opinion/columnists/article272352.ece|title=Shaky industry that runs the world|accessdate=26 October 2010|publisher=The Times (South Africa)|date=24 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; in emerging-market economies is shown and the ''[[Financial Times]]'' has used the label "[[Seven Sisters (oil companies)#The New Seven Sisters|The New Seven Sisters]]" to refer to a group of what it argues are the most influential national oil and gas companies based in countries outside of the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]], namely [[China National Petroleum Corporation|CNPC]] ''(China)'', [[Gazprom]] ''(Russia)'', [[National Iranian Oil Company]] ''(Iran)'', [[Petrobras]] ''(Brazil)'', [[Petróleos de Venezuela S.A.|PDVSA]] ''(Venezuela)'', [[Petronas]] ''(Malaysia)'', [[Saudi Aramco]] ''(Saudi Arabia)''.&lt;ref name="NSS-01"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ypenergy.org/history/ |title=New and Old Leaders in the Upstream Oil Industry |accessdate=20 Jan 2012 |publisher=ypenergy.org |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111222183241/http://www.ypenergy.org/history/ |archivedate=22 December 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NSS-02"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.warregoenergy.com/story/documents/FT%20The%20New%20Seven%20Sisters.pdf|title=FT – New and Old Leaders in the Upstream Oil Industry|accessdate=20 Jan 2012|publisher=FT|date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Big oil"==
Petroleum and [[natural gas|gas]] supermajors are sometimes collectively referred to as "Big oil", a term that emphasizes their economic power and perceived influence on politics, particularly in the United States. Big oil is often associated with the [[fossil fuels lobby]].

'''Sir Christopher Llewellyn Bullock''', [[Order of the Bath|KCB]], [[Order of the British Empire|CBE]] (10 November 1891 – 16 May 1972), a prominent member of the [[Bullock family]], was [[Permanent Under-Secretary]] at the [[British Air Ministry]] from 1931 to 1936.  Appointed at the age of 38, he remains one of the youngest civil servants to have headed a British Government department.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, Richard A., ''Ethics in the British Civil Service'', 1988 {{ISBN|978-0-415-00334-6}}, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Geoffrey-Lloyd 1972"&gt;Geoffrey-Lloyd, "Bullock, Sir Christopher Llewellyn (1891–1972)", rev. Mark Pottle, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Grey&gt;Grey, C. J., ''A History of the Air Ministry'', 1942&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
The son of Rev. L. Bullock and his wife Cecil, granddaughter of [[Thomas FitzMaurice, 5th Earl of Orkney]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Flight Archive RAF |first=Flight Archive RAF |title=Flight Archive |publisher=Fight Archive 1916}}&lt;!--|accessdate=15 Feb--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Sir Christopher's academic achievements were considerable. He gained a classical scholarship from [[Rugby School|Rugby]] to [[Trinity College, Cambridge]] from which he graduated in the [[British undergraduate degree classification|first division of the first class]] of the [[Classical Tripos]] in 1913, twice winning a [[Browne medal]], and was offered a [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellowship at Trinity]].

After taking first place in the open competition for [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|the Home]] and [[Imperial Civil Service|Indian Civil Services]] in 1914, he chose India, but at the outbreak of [[World War I]], he volunteered for service with the [[Rifle Brigade|Rifle Brigade Special Service]]. He was one of three officers (and 175 men) of the battalion wounded on 6 July 1915 during a major attack by the 11th Infantry Brigade on the German trenches near the town of Boesinghe ([[Boezinge]]), about three miles north of [[Ypres]]. He was seriously wounded and [[mentioned in dispatches]].

==Role in British aviation==
Returning to active service, he was seconded to the [[Royal Flying Corps]], training as an observer and then gaining his wings as a pilot in Egypt before being declared unfit for flying duties in 1917.

He then joined the Air Staff, beginning his work for the Air Ministry, and was appointed [[O.B.E.]] in 1919. He was appointed [[C.B.E.]] in 1926, [[Order of the Bath|C.B.]] in 1929 and [[K.C.B.]] in 1932.

===Royal Air Force===
In 1919, he became [[principal private secretary]] to [[Winston Churchill]], then [[Secretary of State for Air]]. From then on until 1930, he served successive Secretaries of State including [[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Sir Samuel Hoare]] and [[Christopher Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson|The Lord Thomson]], fighting with [[Lord Trenchard]], as Trenchard's right-hand man on the civilian side, against resistance and powerful forces within Whitehall and the hostility of the Navy and the Army to the establishment of a permanent independent [[History of the Royal Air Force|Royal Air Force]].

On 12 June 1930, the Prime Minister, [[Ramsay MacDonald]], agreed to his appointment as Permanent Under-Secretary at the age of 38.

During the 1930s, he worked with great determination under considerable pressure on the expansion of the RAF during the period in which the menace of Nazism rose in Germany. Bullock was personally committed to the policy of expansion and strove, against the pacific temper of the time, to awaken public and Parliament to the need to strengthen the RAF to meet the dangers that lay ahead.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 144&lt;/ref&gt; Even when Churchill was not in government during the 1930s, Bullock supplied him with figures on German air strength which Churchill used in attacking the Government's policy of [[appeasement]].&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bap"&gt;Montgomery Hyde, H., ''British Air Policy between the Wars: 1918–1939'' London: Heinemann. 1976, note p. 462.&lt;/ref&gt; His supporters included [[T.E. Lawrence]], who wrote in 1934, "Bullock is doing well. I wish he was C.A.S. ([[Chief of the Air Staff (United Kingdom)|Chief of the Air Staff]]) and the Air Council as well!".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=1 August 2010|title=T. E. Lawrence Studies|url= http://www.telawrence.net/telawrencenet/letters/1934/340524_c_s_smith.htm
}}&lt;/ref&gt; His achievements have been justly recognised in the accounts of rearmament and the role of the RAF during the Second World War.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 174&lt;/ref&gt;

Described as "a man of brilliant youthful academic achievement and manic self regard",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sourceuk.net/article/4/4322/episodes_in_civil_service_history_vi__the_sackings_of_gregory_and_bullock.html |author=Rimington, J. |title=EPISODES IN CIVIL SERVICE HISTORY VI – The Sackings of Gregory and Bullock |publisher=sourceUK.net |date=27 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Lord Trenchard|Trenchard]] as "the man with the finest brain I ever met with" and one of his own chief advisers, Bullock made powerful enemies – "but not in the Air Ministry!" – as he sought to impose his views of the emerging power of the aeroplane on the Armed Forces and the Government.&lt;ref name=memorial&gt;{{cite web|title= Lloyd, M.P., The Rt. Hon. Geoffrey, ''Sir Christopher Bullock K.C.B. C.B.E. Memorial Service Address'', 15th June 1972
|url=http://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Sir_Christopher_Bullock%27s_Memorial_Service_Address.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Among those who took against him was Sir [[Warren Fisher]], the Head of the Civil Service, who was notorious for his wish to control senior appointments in the civil service and to second-guess defence policy.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, pp 726–727&lt;/ref&gt;

The survival of Britain in the Second World War was largely due the foundations that Bullock laid for the vast expansion of the RAF.&lt;ref&gt;Dunnett, Sir James, Permanent Under-Secretary of State for the Ministry of Defence, Letter to R H W Bullock, 18 May 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Of all the Civil Servants known by [[Lord Hankey]], Secretary of the Cabinet, Bullock made by far the greatest creative contribution to the Defence effort. For ten peace time years, Bullock worked as if already at war.&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt;

===Civil aviation===
He also made a great impact on the extension of British Civil Aviation through his support for [[Imperial Airways]] and by his part in creating the [[Empire Air Mail Scheme]], in which he went as a passenger in one of the early proving flights to India in December 1926.&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery Hyde p. 191&lt;/ref&gt; He negotiated overflight and landing rights with South Africa and other African administrations, Australia and India.

In 1929, he participated in early test flights of the Government funded airship, [[R101]], part of the [[Imperial Airship Scheme]]. He was instrumental in persuading the [[Secretary of State for Air]], [[Christopher Birdwood Thomson, 1st Baron Thomson]] – an enthusiastic proponent of airships – to delay the construction of a larger and more expensive airship, [[R102]] (which would have cost over £2m at contemporary prices), until R101 had successfully completed its maiden flight to India.&lt;ref name="pm"&gt;Masefield, Peter G., ''To Ride The Storm: The Story of the Airship R.101.'' London: William Kimber and Co. Ltd., Godolphin House, 1982. {{ISBN|0-7183-0068-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In the event Bullock's caution was justified. R101 crashed only a few hours into its maiden flight, killing Lord Thomson and most of the crew.  Shortly afterwards the Government abandoned the Imperial Airship Scheme.

===Dismissal===
On 6 August 1936, he was dismissed from his post by the Prime Minister, [[Stanley Baldwin]], on the advice of Sir [[Warren Fisher]], following the report of a [[Board of Inquiry]] into his dealings with Sir [[Eric Geddes]], the Chairman of [[Imperial Airways]].  The Board found that he had abused his position as head of the Ministry to seek a place on the Board of Imperial Airways, at a time when his Ministry was negotiating with the company to establish an air mail service – he had "interlaced public negotiations entrusted to him with the advancement of his personal or private interests" but also that "he at no time appreciated the gravity or fully realised the true nature or possible consequences of what he was doing and we consider that his failure to do so goes far to explain, though it cannot excuse, what has occurred".&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 156&lt;/ref&gt;

As far as is known, he remains the only Permanent Under-Secretary to have been dismissed from the civil service.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 142&lt;/ref&gt;

After his dismissal, he received thousands of letters of support.&lt;ref name=Grey/&gt;  His case was taken up in the United States by [[Time Magazine]], which wrote: "Thus Sir Christopher Bullock had his career broken last week without anything specific being brought out against him. Among British aviators, the view was that Sir Christopher is easily worth ten of the men who investigated and broke him." &lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, 17 August 1936&lt;/ref&gt; "The gentlemen of the Air Ministry recently manoeuvred Prime Minister Stanley Baldwin into dismissing the only one of its civil servants with a practical grasp of Britain's colossal problems in air rearmament, Sir Christopher Bullock."&lt;ref&gt;Time Magazine, 2 November 1936&lt;/ref&gt;

On leaving the Civil Service, Bullock went on to pursue a successful career in business, being appointed to the board of a number of public companies.

==Recognition==
Within the Government doubts quickly began to be voiced about the justice of his treatment.  Even his Secretary of State and the Prime Minister in 1936, [[Stanley Baldwin|Baldwin]], wrote letters admitting that their decision had been wrong.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; As former Prime Minister, Sir Stanley Baldwin later wrote "I feel it only right to say that, if I had had the full evidence before me which has now been made available, I should not have taken the decision I reluctantly did".&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt; Writing in November 1937, [[Lord Hankey]] stated "the more I think about it the more I feel that the punishment did not fit the crime".&lt;ref&gt;S.W.Roskill, ''Hankey, man of secrets''&lt;/ref&gt; In December 1938, the [[Marquess of Londonderry]] – the Secretary of State for Air at the time of the dismissal – wrote privately to Baldwin "...[Bullock] was most unjustly treated and was the victim of the inveterate hatred of a civil servant [[Warren Fisher|Sir Warren Fisher]] who should never have been allowed to encompass his downfall, as he undoubtedly did."&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery Hyde, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt;

In the spring of 1940, the injustice he had suffered was privately recognised when he was offered the Headship of the [[Petroleum Warfare Department]] which would have been ''de facto'' reinstatement and full restitution. Bullock declined, arguing that he was more valuable to the war effort as an industrialist.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, pp. 162, 174&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, his case was reviewed by the Lord Chancellor, [[William Jowitt|Lord Jowitt]], who concluded that the case against Bullock would have met if he had been allowed to resign in 1936 as no corruption was alleged – "it was really a case in which his zeal had outrun his discretion".&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless Jowitt advised the Prime Minister [[Clement Attlee]] that he should not alter the decision "after all these years". Accordingly Attlee wrote to confirm Jowitt's conclusions but Bullock did not regard this as adequate redress.&lt;ref&gt;Chapman, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Samuel Hoare, 1st Viscount Templewood|Viscount Templewood]] wrote, in 1957, "Whatever may have been the merits of the dispute in which he (Bullock) was then involved – and I may say that I took his side, and that none of the charges in any way affected his honour – the fact remains that by his departure the Air Force lost one of its ablest defenders".&lt;ref&gt;Templewood, Viscount, ''Empire of the Air, The Advent of the Air Age, 1922 – 1929'', Collins, 1957, p. 51&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite campaigning for many years, Bullock never secured the redress he desired and died in 1972 without any official statement being issued about his treatment.

Public acknowledgment that his dismissal had been mistaken was belatedly made after his death&lt;ref name="Geoffrey-Lloyd 1972"/&gt; when his Memorial Service at the Central Church of the Royal Air Force, [[St Clement Danes]] was attended by representatives of the Prime Minister, ([[Victor Goodhew|Victor Goodhew M.P.]]), [[Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State]] for [[Ministry of Defence (United Kingdom)|Defence]] ([[Royal Air Force|RAF]]), ([[Anthony Lambton|Lord Lambton M.P.]]), the Home Civil Service (Permanent Under Secretary of State for the Ministry of Defence, Sir James Dunnett) and the Air Force Board ([[Edmund Hudleston|Air Chief Marshal Sir Edmund Hudleston]] and [[Denis Smallwood|Air Chief Marshal Sir Denis Smallwood]]). The Address&lt;ref name=memorial/&gt; was given by [[Geoffrey Lloyd, Baron Geoffrey-Lloyd|The Rt. Hon. Lord Geoffrey Lloyd M.P.]]

[[William Armstrong, Baron Armstrong of Sanderstead|Sir William Armstrong]], Head of the Civil Service at the time of Bullock's death, wrote of "a great personal tragedy which clouded the rest of his life", many considering that "his treatment had been unduly severe", there being "no doubt at any time about his great abilities".&lt;ref name=armstrong&gt;Armstrong, Sir William, Letter, ''The Times'', 20 May 1972&lt;/ref&gt;

==Family==

Bullock's elder brother was [[Walter Llewellyn Bullock|Professor Walter Llewellyn Bullock]].

On 18 April 1917, he married [[Lupton family|Barbara May Lupton]] at the main Unitarian church of West London, [[Essex Street Chapel|Essex Church, The Mall, Kensington]]. The [[Lupton family]] are the paternal ancestors of [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Nikkhah|first=Roya|title=Duchess of Cambridge discovers blue blood in her own family|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/9747412/Duchess-of-Cambridge-discovers-blue-blood-in-her-own-family.html|work=The Sunday Telegraph|page=9|date=16 December 2012|accessdate=11 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Sir Christopher and Lady Bullock had two sons, Richard Henry Watson Bullock CB and Edward Anthony Watson Bullock, both of whom entered public service, in the [[Her Majesty's Civil Service|Home Civil Service]] and the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office]] respectively.&lt;ref name=armstrong/&gt;

The '''Congregation of Marian Fathers of the Immaculate Conception of the Most Blessed Virgin Mary''' ([[Latin]]: ''Congregatio Clericorum Marianorum ab Immaculata Conceptionis Beatissimae Virginis Mariae''; abbreviation: M.I.C.) is a [[Catholic]] male [[Clergy|clerical]] [[Congregation (Catholic)|religious congregation]] founded, 1670, in Poland.  It is also known as '''Marians of the Immaculate Conception'''.

The Congregation of about 500 [[priest]]s and [[Brother (Catholic)|brothers]] has convents in 19 countries on 6 continents.  Marians pledge support to the Pope and follow the official teachings of the Catholic Church and aim to spread devotion to [[BVM(RC)|Blessed Virgin Mary]] as the [[Immaculate Conception]], pray for the [[soul (spirit)|soul]]s in [[purgatory]] and undertake a variety of apostolic work.

Marians were the first Catholic men’s [[religious institute]] dedicated to the honor of Mary’s Immaculate Conception. The community traces its roots to Saint [[Stanislaus Papczyński|Stanislaus of Jesus and Mary Papczyński]] who was beatified in [[Basilica of Our Lady of Licheń]], [[Licheń Stary]], [[Poland]], in 2007. As an [[Institute of consecrated life]] their motto is ''Pro Christo et Ecclesia''. Marians are also the official promoters of the authentic Divine Mercy message since 1941.

==History==
[[File:Fr pap shadow.jpg|thumb|210px|Saint [[Stanislaus Papczyński|Stanislaus of Jesus and Mary Papczyński]], Founder of the Marians, on the oldest existing portrait from the end of the 17th century, Marian monastery in Skórzec, Poland.]]
The Congregation began on December 11, 1670, with Saint [[Stanislaus Papczyński]] publicly announcing in his ''Oblatio'' the desire to establish a community of men dedicated to spreading the honor of the Immacuate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary.  In 1673, in Puszcza Korabiewska (today known as [[Puszcza Marianska]]/Marian Forest) near Skierniewice, Poland, the first religious house of the Marians was approved by the local bishop.  The first members of the community based their life on the ''Rule of Life'', written by St. Stanislaus.  He tempered his plans at first to establish a community active in the Church's service.  At the beginning, the Marian Fathers lived an eremitical rule of life as they pursued final recognition and approval by the Church.  Within a short time, the new and still small institute received approval from their local Ordinary, Bishop Stephen Wierzbowski of Poznan.&lt;ref name=marians&gt;[http://www.marian.org/marians/history.php "The History of the Marians", Marians of the Immaculate Conception]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pope Innocent XII]] granted his approval for the young institute in 1699 with solemn vows under the French Rule of the Ten Virtues of the Blessed Virgin Mary, initially placing them within the [[Franciscans]].&lt;ref name=marians/&gt;

With the death of the Founder in 1701, however, the Marian Fathers found themselves in a critical period of transition.  Internal factions divided the membership into one group favoring a strictly contemplative life, and a second group seeking to add missionary and pastoral outreach to the institute's contemplative spirit.&lt;ref name=marians/&gt;  The period known as the "Rostkowski Dispersion" followed, fired by internal conflict, as well as the negative attitude expressed by some bishops and lay dignitaries.  In 1716, Bishop Adam Rostkowski decided to close the Marian novitiate, instructing Marians to leave the monastery and move out to assume pastoral work in parishes.

In 1722, Bishop John Tarlo of Poznan called the scattered Marians back to their monasteries, and convened a general chapter.  The man elected to serve as Superior General was Fr. [[Andrew of St. Matthew Deszpot]], a Czech originally received into the institute by the founder St. Stanislaus.  At the same chapter, a General Procurator was chosen, Fr. [[Joachim of St. Ann Kozłowski]].  He was given the mission of going to Rome to have the institute's constitutions confirmed, and to remove the institute from the jurisdiction of local bishops.  In 1723, Pope [[Innocent XIII]] approved the Marian statutes and released the institute from the interference of local bishops.

[[File:Wyszynski 10212008.jpg|frame|Venerable Servant of God Fr. Casimir Wyszyński, Superior General of the Marians who established the institute in Portugal.]]
[[File:Nowicki.jpg|frame|Fr. Raymond Nowicki]]
The rest of 18th century was marked by steady growth as the Marians expanded from Poland to Portugal and Italy thanks to the efforts of two outstanding Superior Generals of the institute:  Venerable Serv. of God [[Casimir Wyszyński]] (1700–1755) and [[Raymond Nowicki]] (1735–1801).

Rapid changes in the European political situation by the end of the 18th and through 19th century led to the near destruction of the institute.

With the complete failure of the [[Kosciuszko Uprising]] in 1795, Poland lost its independence.  Now the Marian Fathers found themselves divided by virtually sealed borders.  The partitioning of the Polish Republic was decreed by the occupying armies of Russia, Prussia, and Austria.

Again, in 1798, after [[Napoleon]] seized Rome, he mandated that all foreigners be expelled from its borders.  The exodus included the Marian Fathers removed from their monastery and Rome's St. Vitus Church.

In 1834, the Portuguese government became hostile toward all religious, and finally closed all Marian monasteries in that nation.

In Eastern Europe following the [[Congress of Vienna|Vienna Congress]] of 1815, most of the Marian monasteries found themselves in the newly created [[Congress Poland|Kingdom of Poland]], which was part of Imperial Russia, whose Czarist regime was openly hostile to the Catholic Church.

The defeat of two Polish national uprisings against [[Czarist Russia]], one in November 1830, and another in January 1863, meant repression for [[religious institute]]s in Poland.  The Czarist regime prohibited the acceptance of new candidates to the religious life, effectively stamping out the normal process of growth in vocations to the religious life for the Marian Fathers and other institutes.

One of the most famous Marians in the 19th century was Fr. [[Christopher Szwernicki]]. In 1852, he was exiled to [[Irkutsk]], where he built the church and an [[orphanage]] for the deportees’ children. In 1888 he was titled "Apostle of Siberia" by Pope [[Leo XIII]].

[[File:senku.jpg|thumb|left|180px|Fr. Vincent Sękowski]]
By 1865, the Russian occupying forces allowed only one Marian monastery to remain open in [[Marijampole]], Lithuania.  All Marians were sent to Marijampole.  Such rulings were nothing less than a death sentence for the religious institute.  By the year 1904, that last Marian house closed, since so few Marians remained.  By 1908, only one Marian remained, [[Vincent Sękowski]] (Senkus).  He was the last Superior General.  All other Marians had died, or asked to leave to join the ranks of the diocesan clergy.  For all appearances, the Czarist persecutions had succeeded.  The Marian Fathers seemed to have come to the end of the line.

At this critical moment in the history of the Marian institute, an ardent and energetic Lithuanian priest came to visit Fr. Vincent Sękowski, with the aim of secretly renewing it. He was Fr. [[Jurgis Matulaitis-Matulevičius|George Matulaitis-Matulewicz]], and at that time he was a professor at the Academy of Theology in St. Petersburg, Russia.  Fr. Matulaitis had a profound understanding of the contributions and significance of religious life to society, although Catholic monasteries were being suppressed at that time.  He believed it was important to do whatever needed to be done to revive Catholic religious life in the lands dominated by Imperial Russia.
[[File:Jerzy Matulewicz.png|thumb|Blessed Archbishop [[Jurgis Matulaitis-Matulevičius|George (''Jurgis'') Matulaitis-Matulewicz]]]]
[[File:Fr. Michael Gaitley, MIC.jpg|thumb|left|Father Michael E. Gaitley, MIC is a popular preacher and author in the [[United States]].]]
As a youth, he had been brought up in a village where the Marian Fathers staffed the local parish.  The experience had left him with a lifelong respect and admiration for the Marian Fathers.  And so Fr. George, along with his friend Fr. [[Francis-Peter Bucys]], who had also grown up with Marian religious influence, entered the Marian institute with the intention of saving it from disappearing into history, along with all its promise for God's work.  They had to become Marians in secret in order to thwart Imperial Russian authorities, who continued to persecute the Church.

Fr. George made his vows and was accepted into the Marian institute by Fr. Vincent Sękowski, and in the same year, 1909, Fr. Francis Peter Bucys became the first novice of the institute on its way to renewed life.

Fr. George wrote the renewed institute's constitutions, inspired by the spirit of St. Stanislaus Papczyński and the desire to adapt his ideals to modern times.  The new Constitutions and revived form of Marian life were approved by St. Pope [[Pius X]] in 1910.  Fr. Vincent Sękowski, who was the last of the “White Marians”, lived on for five months after papal approval for Marian renewal.

To assure that the institute could continue to flourish without interference from the Imperial government, the secret Marian novitiate and house of studies were transferred from St. Petersburg in Russia to Fribourg in Switzerland.  From this time on, the Marian Fathers began to experience consistent growth.  In 1927, the year when the Renovator, then [[Archbishop]] George Matulaitis-Matulewicz, died, the Congregation had grown to around 300 members (among them [[Beatification|Blessed]] [[George Kalusza]], [[Servant of God]] [[Eugene Kulesza]], and Servant of God [[Janis Mendriks]]).

Fr. Francis P. Bucys succeeded Blessed George as the Superior General of the renovated Congregation.  Thanks to the Renovator's reforms, the Marian Fathers became a modern religious congregation.  Yet Blessed George Matulaitis did not change the main ideals of the religious community, such as spreading devotion to the Immaculate Conception of the Blessed Virgin Mary and supplication for the souls suffering in Purgatory.  However, he did expand the field of the Marian apostolate and introduced significant changes into the Marian Fathers' way of life, adapting it to the new conditions and needs of modern times.

==20th century==
Although it is now an international organization, the Marians still have strong roots in Poland, (e.g. the [[Sanctuary of Our Lady of Lichen]]) and place a great deal of emphasis on spreading the messages of [[Divine Mercy]] of Saint [[Faustina Kowalska]].

Between 1950 and 1986 the Marian Fathers operated two boarding schools in England, at Lower [[Bullingham]] near [[Hereford]] and the second, ''Divine Mercy College'', at [[Fawley Court]], [[Buckinghamhire]], (north of [[Henley-on-Thames]]). Though intended for boys of Polish origin, in particular the children of the 100,000+ Poles who found exile in Britain after the Second World War, a proportion of the boys accepted were non-Poles.

In 1996 Fr. Seraphim Michalenko, MIC, and Fr. George Kosicki, CSB formed the ''John Paul II Institute of Divine Mercy'' to provide instruction in Divine Mercy theology and spirituality to both parish leaders and clergy.  At its inception, [[Pope John Paul II]] entrusted the Institute with the task of providing "formation and research in The Divine Mercy message".  Their role in spreading the Divine Mercy message was acknowledged by Pope John Paul II in a special [http://www.padrimariani.org/assets/images/blessings/2001oct5.jpg Papal Blessing] in 2001, the 70th anniversary of the revelation of the Divine Mercy Message and Devotion.

==21st century==
[[File:S6000734.JPG|thumb|left|The Licheń Basilica]]
With a Polish Pope in the chair of [[St Peter the Apostle|St Peter]] and the [[Fall of the Berlin Wall]], the circumstances were ripe for a resurgence of the medieval Marian cult in Poland. The Fathers laid plans to erect an ambitious new shrine to Mary, to rival that of [[Czestochowa]], in the village [[Licheń Stary]], scene of a 19th-century Napoleonic soldier's devotion. The resulting Basilica and visitor centre, designed by [[Barbara Bielecka]] and blessed in 1994 by [[John Paul II]], was completed in 2004 and is said to be the largest church building in Poland.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.lichen.pl/en/221/the_basilica|title = The Basilica - SHRINE OF OUR LADY OF LICHEN Sorrows IN OLD|date = |access-date = 9 August 2016|website = |publisher = SHRINE OF OUR LADY OF LICHEN Sorrows IN OLD|last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction was said to have been funded entirely by pilgrims' donations.&lt;ref&gt;''The Guardian''; June 20, 1998.

'''Downtown''', also known as '''Downcity''', is the central economic, political, and cultural district of the city of [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. It is bounded on the east by Canal Street and the [[Providence River]], to the north by Smith Street, to the west by [[Interstate 95 in Rhode Island|Interstate 95]], and to the south by Henderson Street. [[Interstate 95 in Rhode Island|I-95]] serves as a physical barrier between the city's commercial core and neighborhoods of [[Federal Hill, Providence, Rhode Island|Federal Hill]], [[West End, Providence, Rhode Island|West End]], and [[Upper South Providence, Providence, Rhode Island|Upper South Providence]].  Most of the downtown is listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]] as the '''Downtown Providence Historic District'''.

==History==
Originally known as 'Weybossett Neck' or 'Weybossett Side,' Downtown was first settled by religious dissidents from the First Congregational Society in 1746. Their settlement was located near present-day Westminster Street.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.providenceri.com/Neighborhoods/downtwn.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20060314100037/http://www.providenceri.com/Neighborhoods/downtwn.html |archivedate=2006-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown did not witness substantial development until the early 19th century, when Providence began to compete with [[Newport, Rhode Island]]. British forces had destroyed much of Newport during the [[American Revolutionary War|American War for Independence]], making the city's merchants vulnerable to competition from Providence.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; This prevented the development of a commercial district along the western bank of the Providence River.

During the industrialization of the late 19th century, an ever-expanding railroad industry emanating from [[Union Station (Providence)|Union Station]], eventually resulted in the complete paving over of the Great Salt Cove and the two branches of the [[Providence River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/Cianci_City_07-29-07_EN6HKE5.382643c.html|title=Home – providencejournal.com – Providence, RI|work=providencejournal.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The result of decades of expansion was the isolation of [[Rhode Island State House|the state capitol]] from the rest of downtown by an imposing mass of railroad tracks, often called locally the "Chinese Wall".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Woodward |first=William McKenzie |title=PPS/AIAri Guide to Providence Architecture |year=2003 |publisher=Providence Preservation Society |location=Providence, RI |isbn=0-9742847-0-X |page=13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  As rail traffic dropped off, 75 percent by 1980,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artinruins.com/arch/stillinuse/unionstation/|title=Union Station|work=artinruins.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; city planners saw an opportunity to open up central land for development and unify downtown with the Capitol.  A [[Providence (Amtrak station)|new, smaller train station]] was built in 1986 a half mile north of its predecessor, and tracks were removed or routed underground.

The new land precipitated a massive remaking of the character of the city's downtown. From 1975 until 1982, under Mayor [[Vincent Cianci, Jr]], [[United States dollar|$]]606 million of local and national Community Development funds from were invested.  Roads were removed and the city's natural rivers were opened up and lined with a cobblestone-paved park called [[Waterplace Park]] in 1994, which is now host to popular [[WaterFire]] festivals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterfire.org/|title=WaterFire Providence|work=WaterFire Providence|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Private and public developments followed and the new area adjacent to the Capitol became known as Capitol Center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.city-data.com/us-cities/The-Northeast/Providence-Economy.html|title=Providence: Economy|work=city-data.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ushered in by the construction of the new train station (1986), the development of the new land brought new buildings: The Gateway Building (1990), [[One Citizens Plaza]] (1991), Center Place (1992), a [[The Westin Providence|Westin hotel]] and Providence Convention Center (1993), [[Providence Place Mall]] (1999), Courtyard Marriott (2000), [[GTECH Corporation|GTECH]] headquarters (2006), [[The Residences at the Westin]] (2007), [[Waterplace]] condominiums (2007), and Capitol Cove still under construction.

In 2007, the Renaissance Providence Hotel opened in [[Masonic Temple (Providence)|Masonic Temple]] building, which had been abandoned amidst the [[Great Depression]] a half century prior.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marriott.com/hotels/travel/pvdbr-renaissance-providence-hotel/|title=Downtown Providence RI Hotels – Hotels in Providence Rhode Island – The Renaissance Providence|work=Marriott|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
According to the Providence Plan, a local nonprofit aimed at improving city life, 64% of residents are white and 8.6% are Asian, both above the citywide averages of 54.4% and 6.2% respectively. 12% of the population is [[African-American]], 11% is [[Hispanic]], and 1% is [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]]. 43% of public school children speak a language other than English as their primary language.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://204.17.79.244/profiles/dtn_main.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928004532/http://204.17.79.244/profiles/dtn_main.html |archivedate=2007-09-28 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The median family income is $42,558, over $10,000 above the citywide average. 14% of families live below the [[poverty threshold|poverty line]] while nearly 3.7% receive some form of public assistance.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

15% of children under the age of six have been exposed to high quantities of lead.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

==Government==
From north to south, Downtown includes portions of Wards 12, 13, 11. These wards are represented in the [[Providence City Council]] by Terrance Hassett, [[John J. Lombardi]], and Balbina A. Young.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://providenceri.com/CityCouncil/councilpage.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20061113193720/http://www.providenceri.com/CityCouncil/councilpage.html |archivedate=2006-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; All three councillors are [[Democratic Party (USA)|Democrats]]. Hassett currently serves as the majority leader.

Providence City Hall is located at 25 Dorrance Street, at the corner of Dorrance and Washington Street. It is immediately next to Kennedy Plaza and the Biltmore Hotel. It houses the City Council, the Mayor's Office, and the offices of some municipal agencies.

The [[Rhode Island State House]] is located on Smith Street at the northern edge of Downtown. It includes the chambers of the [[Rhode Island General Assembly]] and the Governor's Office.

The Rhode Island Department of Education is headquartered in the Shepard Building at 255 Westminster Street.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ridoe.net/ |title=RiDOE |work=RiDOE |accessdate=31 October 2015 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151107050856/http://ridoe.net/ |archivedate=7 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Universities==
Various universities have facilities in Downtown Providence. These include:

*[[Brown University]] has recently bought several properties in the Jewelry District.
*[[Johnson &amp; Wales University]] has its central and largest campus in Downtown. This campus includes Johnson &amp; Wales School of Business, School of Technology, College of Arts and Science and School of Hospitality.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20021010064557/http://www.jwu.edu/prov/acad.htm |title=jwu.edu |date=2002-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports==
The [[Providence Bruins]] of the [[American Hockey League]] and the [[Providence College]] Friars men's basketball team play out of the [[Dunkin' Donuts Center]] (formerly the Providence Civic Center) at 1 LaSalle Square.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dunkindonutscenter.com/teams.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-08-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070811233915/http://www.dunkindonutscenter.com/teams.html |archivedate=2007-08-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arts==
As part of the revitalization of Providence, the administrations of Mayors [[Vincent Cianci]] and [[David Cicilline]] have promoted Providence, especially Downtown, as an artistic center.  WaterFire has become perhaps the most visible symbol of Providence's development into an artistic center. Waterfire is an environmental art event created by [[Barnaby Evans]] that includes bon fires, [[gondolas]], and music. This event has become a major attraction for both Rhode Islanders and tourists.

Downtown includes two centers for the performing arts, the [[Providence Performing Arts Center]] and [[Trinity Repertory Company]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ppacri.org/|title=Providence Performing Arts Center :: Home|author=Providence Performing Arts Center|work=ppacri.org|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trinityrep.com/|title=Welcome to Trinity Rep – The State Theater of Rhode Island|website=Trinityrep.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Downtown is also home to [[AS220]], a non-profit community [[arts center]] that includes fifty-three artist live/work studios, four galleries, a performance space, a black box theatre, a dance studio, a bar and restaurant, a makerspace consisting of a printshop, fab lab, media arts lab and darkroom, and a free after-school arts education program for youth.

==Architecture==
Downtown Providence has numerous 19th-century mercantile buildings in the [[Federal style architecture|Federal]] and Victorian architectural styles, as well as several post-modern and modernist buildings that are located throughout this area. In particular, a fairly clear spatial separation appears between the areas of pre-1980s development and post-1980s development. Fountain Street and Exchange Terrace serve as rough boundaries between the two.

==Parks==
[[Image:Waterplacepark.JPG|right|280px|thumb|[[Waterplace Park]]]]

Downtown Providence contains three parks:

* [[Burnside Park, Providence|Burnside Park]] is located adjacent to [[Kennedy Plaza]]. At its center is an [[equestrian statue]] of [[American Civil War]] general, Rhode Island governor, [[United States Senator]] [[Ambrose Burnside]]. Adjacent to the park is an outdoor [[ice skating]] rink, the Alex and Ani City Center.
* [[Waterplace Park]] extends from the Great Salt Cove to the Riverwalk along the [[Providence River]]. The park hosts WaterFire festivals.
* Station Park, a green space adjacent to the [[Providence (Amtrak station)|Providence Amtrak Station]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.projo.com/news/content/projo_20051123_polo23.e35e333.html|title=Home – providencejournal.com – Providence, RI|work=providencejournal.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Veterans Memorial Park and Market Square, along the border between Downtown and College Hill, are sometimes counted as Downtown parks.

==Central Downtown==
[[Image:Providence big three.jpg|thumb|Downtown Providence at [[Burnside Park, Providence, Rhode Island|Burnside Park]]]]

The historic part of downtown has many streetscapes that look as they did eighty years ago. Most of the state's tallest buildings are found in this area. The [[List of tallest buildings in Providence|largest structure]], to date, is the art-deco-styled [[Industrial National Bank Building]] (formerly Industrial Trust Tower), at 426 feet (130 m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125380 |title=Bank of America Building, Providence| publisher=Emporis | year=2007 |accessdate = 2007-01-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, nearby to it is the second tallest [[Sovereign Bank Tower (Providence)|One Financial Center]] (Sovereign Bank Tower), designed in modern taut-skin cladding, constructed a half century later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/bu/?id=125377 | title=One Financial Plaza| year=2006 | publisher=Emporis | accessdate = 2006-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; In between the two is [[50 Kennedy Plaza]]. The [[Textron Tower]] is another core building in the Providence skyline. Downtown is also the home of the [[Providence Biltmore]] hotel and the [[Westminster Arcade]], the oldest enclosed shopping mall in the U.S., built in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=101896 |title=Providence Buildings, Real Estate, Architecture, Skyscrapers, and Construction Database |year=2005 |publisher=Emporis |accessdate=2005-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050529062647/http://www.emporis.com/en/wm/ci/?id=101896 |archivedate=2005-05-29 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Kennedy Plaza]] is a major business and transportation hub. Surrounding the plaza are Providence City Hall, Burnside Park, the Bank of America Building, One Financial Center, 50 Kennedy Plaza, Bank of America Ice Skating Rink, and the US District Court building. The plaza itself includes the central station for the [[Rhode Island Public Transit Authority]] (RIPTA) and a police substation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ripta.com/news/index.php?section%3D10 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-07-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070810200920/http://www.ripta.com/news/index.php?section=10 |archivedate=2007-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.providencepolice.com/dist1sub.html|title=Police Department – Districts – District 1 – City of Providence|website=Providencepolice.com|accessdate=31 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, Eisai received [[Approved drug|approval]] from the United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] (USFDA) for Aricept ([[donepezil]]), a drug discovered in the company's labs and co-marketed with [[Pfizer]]. Three years later in 1999, the company received USFDA approval for Aciphex ([[rabeprazole]]), a drug co-marketed with [[Johnson &amp; Johnson]].

In September 2006, the company acquired four oncology products from [[Ligand Pharmaceuticals]].

In April 2007, Eisai acquired [[Exton, Pennsylvania]]-based [[Morphotek]], a company developing [[Monoclonal antibody therapy|therapeutic monoclonal antibodies]] for the treatment of cancer, rheumatoid arthritis, and infectious diseases.

In December 2007, Eisai acquired [[MGI Pharma]], a company specializing in oncology, for $3.9 billion USD. This event brought Dacogen ([[decitabine]]), Aloxi ([[palonosetron]]), Hexalen ([[altretamine]]) for ovarian cancer, and the Gliadel Wafer ([[carmustine]]) for brain tumors into the Eisai product portfolio.

In 2009, Eisai received the Corporate Award from the [[National Organization for Rare Disorders]] (NORD) for the development of [[Banzel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nord-to-honor-rare-disease-pioneers-61818702.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150209123421/http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/nord-to-honor-rare-disease-pioneers-61818702.html |archivedate=February 9, 2015 |title=NORD to Honor Rare Disease Pioneers |publisher=[[PR Newswire]] |date=May 11, 2009 |accessdate=February 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[computing]], '''extract, transform, load''' ('''ETL''') is a process in [[database]] usage to prepare data for analysis, especially in [[data warehouse|data warehousing]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Validating the extract, transform, load process used to populate a large clinical research database|journal = International Journal of Medical Informatics|volume = 94|pages = 271–4|last=Denney|first=MJ |date=2016|pmid = 27506144|pmc = 5556907|doi = 10.1016/j.ijmedinf.2016.07.009}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The ETL process became a popular concept in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sas.com/en_us/insights/data-management/what-is-etl.html ETL What it is and why it matters]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Data extraction]] involves extracting data from homogeneous or heterogeneous sources, while [[data transformation]] processes data by transforming them into a proper storage format/structure for the purposes of querying and analysis; finally, [[data loading]] describes the insertion of data into the final target database such as an [[operational data store]], a [[data mart]], or a [[data warehouse]]. A properly designed ETL system extracts data from the source systems, enforces data quality and consistency standards, conforms data so that separate sources can be used together, and finally delivers data in a presentation-ready format so that application developers can build applications and end users can make decisions.&lt;ref name="Kimball 2004"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/57301227|title=The data warehouse ETL toolkit : practical techniques for extracting, cleaning, conforming, and delivering data|last=Ralph.|first=Kimball,|date=2004|publisher=Wiley|others=Caserta, Joe, 1965-|isbn=978-0764579233|location=Indianapolis, IN|oclc=57301227}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="undefined" /&gt;

Since the data extraction takes time, it is common to execute the three phases in parallel. While the data is being extracted, another transformation process executes while processing the data already received and prepares it for loading while the data loading begins without waiting for the completion of the previous phases.

ETL systems commonly integrate data from multiple applications (systems), typically developed and supported by different vendors or hosted on separate computer hardware. The separate systems containing the original data are frequently managed and operated by different employees. For example, a cost accounting system may combine data from payroll, sales, and purchasing.

== Extract ==
The first part of an ETL process involves extracting the data from the source system(s). In many cases, this represents the most important aspect of ETL, since extracting data correctly sets the stage for the success of subsequent processes. Most data-warehousing projects combine data from different source systems. Each separate system may also use a different data organization and/or [[File format|format]]. Common data-source formats include [[relational database]]s, [[XML]], [[JSON]] and [[Flat file database|flat file]]s, but may also include non-relational database structures such as [[Information Management System|Information Management System (IMS)]] or other data structures such as [[Virtual Storage Access Method|Virtual Storage Access Method (VSAM)]] or [[ISAM|Indexed Sequential Access Method (ISAM)]], or even formats fetched from outside sources by means such as [[web spider]]ing or [[screen-scraping]]. The streaming of the extracted data source and loading on-the-fly to the destination database is another way of performing ETL when no intermediate data storage is required. In general, the extraction phase aims to convert the data into a single format appropriate for transformation processing.

An intrinsic part of the extraction involves data validation to confirm whether the data pulled from the sources has the correct/expected values in a given domain (such as a pattern/default or list of values). If the data fails the validation rules it is rejected entirely or in part. The rejected data is ideally reported back to the source system for further analysis to identify and to rectify the incorrect records.

== Transform ==
In the data transformation stage, a series of rules or functions are applied to the extracted data in order to prepare it for loading into the end target. Some data does not require any transformation at all; such data is known as "direct move" or "pass through" data.

An important function of transformation is the cleaning of data, which aims to pass only "proper" data to the target. The challenge when different systems interact is in the relevant systems' interfacing and communicating. Character sets that may be available in one system may not be so in others.

In other cases, one or more of the following transformation types may be required to meet the business and technical needs of the server or data warehouse:

* Selecting only certain columns to load: (or selecting [[null (SQL)|null]] columns not to load). For example, if the source data has three columns (aka "attributes"), roll_no, age, and salary, then the selection may take only roll_no and salary. Or, the selection mechanism may ignore all those records where salary is not present (salary = null).
* Translating coded values: (''e.g.'', if the source system codes male as "1" and female as "2", but the warehouse codes male as "M" and female as "F")
* Encoding free-form values: (''e.g.'', mapping "Male" to "M")
* Deriving a new calculated value: (''e.g.'', sale_amount = qty * unit_price)
* Sorting or ordering the data based on a list of columns to improve search performance
* [[Join (relational algebra)#Joins and join-like operators|Join]]ing data from multiple sources (''e.g.'', lookup, merge) and [[Record linkage|deduplicating]] the data
* Aggregating (for example, rollup — summarizing multiple rows of data — total sales for each store, and for each region, etc.)
* Generating [[surrogate key|surrogate-key]] values
* [[Transpose|Transposing]] or [[Pivot table|pivoting]] (turning multiple columns into multiple rows or vice versa)
* Splitting a column into multiple columns (''e.g.'', converting a [[comma separated values|comma-separated list]], specified as a string in one column, into individual values in different columns)
* Disaggregating repeating columns
* Looking up and validating the relevant data from tables or referential files
* Applying any form of data validation; failed validation may result in a full rejection of the data, partial rejection, or no rejection at all, and thus none, some, or all of the data is handed over to the next step depending on the rule design and exception handling; many of the above transformations may result in exceptions, e.g., when a code translation parses an unknown code in the extracted data

== Load ==
The load phase loads the data into the end target, which may be a simple delimited flat file or a [[data warehouse]]. Depending on the requirements of the organization, this process varies widely. Some data warehouses may overwrite existing information with cumulative information; updating extracted data is frequently done on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. Other data warehouses (or even other parts of the same data warehouse) may add new data in a historical form at regular intervals—for example, hourly. To understand this, consider a data warehouse that is required to maintain sales records of the last year. This data warehouse overwrites any data older than a year with newer data. However, the entry of data for any one year window is made in a historical manner. The timing and scope to replace or append are strategic design choices dependent on the time available and the [[business]] needs. &lt;!-- is this part of "load"? --&gt;More complex systems can maintain a history and [[audit trail]] of all changes to the data loaded in the data warehouse.

As the load phase interacts with a database, the constraints defined in the database schema — as well as in triggers activated upon data load — apply (for example, uniqueness, [[referential integrity]], mandatory fields), which also contribute to the overall data quality performance of the ETL process.

* For example, a financial institution might have information on a customer in several departments and each department might have that customer's information listed in a different way. The membership department might list the customer by name, whereas the accounting department might list the customer by number. ETL can bundle all of these data elements and consolidate them into a uniform presentation, such as for storing in a database or data warehouse.
* Another way that companies use ETL is to move information to another application permanently. For instance, the new application might use another database vendor and most likely a very different database schema. ETL can be used to transform the data into a format suitable for the new application to use.
* An example would be an [[Expense and Cost Recovery System (ECRS)]] such as used by [[Accountancy|accountancies]], [[Consultancy|consultancies]], and [[Law firm|legal firms]]. The data usually ends up in the [[Law practice management software|time and billing system]], although some businesses may also utilize the raw data for employee productivity reports to Human Resources (personnel dept.) or equipment usage reports to Facilities Management.

== Real-life ETL cycle ==
The typical real-life ETL cycle consists of the following execution steps:

# Cycle initiation
# Build [[reference data]]
# Extract (from sources)
# [[data validation|Validate]]
# Transform ([[data cleaning|clean]], apply [[business rule]]s, check for [[data integrity]], create [[Aggregate (data warehouse)|aggregates]] or disaggregates)
# Stage (load into [[staging (data)|staging]] tables, if used)
# [[Audit report]]s (for example, on compliance with business rules. Also, in case of failure, helps to diagnose/repair)
# Publish (to target tables)
# [[Archiving|Archive]]

== Challenges ==
ETL processes can involve considerable complexity, and significant operational problems can occur with improperly designed ETL systems.

The range of data values or data quality in an operational system may exceed the expectations of designers at the time validation and transformation rules are specified. [[Data profiling]] of a source during data analysis can identify the data conditions that must be managed by transform rules specifications, leading to an amendment of validation rules explicitly and implicitly implemented in the ETL process.

Data warehouses are typically assembled from a variety of data sources with different formats and purposes. As such, ETL is a key process to bring all the data together in a standard, homogeneous environment.

Design analysis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Theodorou|first=Vasileios|date=2017|title=Frequent patterns in ETL workflows: An empirical approach|journal=Data &amp; Knowledge Engineering|volume=112|pages=1–16|doi=10.1016/j.datak.2017.08.004|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0169023X16302713}}&lt;/ref&gt; should establish the [[scalability]] of an ETL system across the lifetime of its usage---including understanding the volumes of data that must be processed within [[service level agreement]]s. The time available to extract from source systems may change, which may mean the same amount of data may have to be processed in less time. Some ETL systems have to scale to process terabytes of data to update data warehouses with tens of terabytes of data. Increasing volumes of data may require designs that can scale from daily [[batch processing|batch]] to multiple-day micro batch to integration with [[message queue]]s or real-time change-data-capture for continuous transformation and update.

== Performance ==
ETL vendors benchmark their record-systems at multiple TB (terabytes) per hour (or ~1 GB per second) using powerful servers with multiple CPUs, multiple hard drives, multiple gigabit-network connections, and lots of memory. 

In real life, the slowest part of an ETL process usually occurs in the database load phase. Databases may perform slowly because they have to take care of concurrency, integrity maintenance, and indices. Thus, for better performance, it may make sense to employ:
* ''Direct path extract'' method or bulk unload whenever is possible (instead of querying the database) to reduce the load on source system while getting high speed extract
* Most of the transformation processing outside of the database
* Bulk load operations whenever possible

Still, even using bulk operations, database access is usually the bottleneck in the ETL process. Some common methods used to increase performance are:
* [[partition (database)|Partition]] tables (and indices): try to keep partitions similar in size (watch for &lt;tt&gt;null&lt;/tt&gt; values that can skew the partitioning)
* Do all validation in the ETL layer before the load: disable [[data integrity|integrity]] checking (&lt;tt&gt;disable constraint&lt;/tt&gt; ...) in the target database tables during the load
* Disable [[database trigger|triggers]] (&lt;tt&gt;disable trigger&lt;/tt&gt; ...) in the target database tables during the load: simulate their effect as a separate step
* Generate IDs in the ETL layer (not in the database)
* Drop the [[database index|indices]] (on a table or partition) before the load - and recreate them after the load (SQL: &lt;tt&gt;drop index&lt;/tt&gt; ...&lt;tt&gt;; create index&lt;/tt&gt; ...)
* Use parallel bulk load when possible — works well when the table is partitioned or there are no indices (Note: attempting to do parallel loads into the same table (partition) usually causes locks — if not on the data rows, then on indices)
* If a requirement exists to do insertions, updates, or deletions, find out which rows should be processed in which way in the ETL layer, and then process these three operations in the database separately; you often can do bulk load for inserts, but updates and deletes commonly go through an [[API]] (using [[SQL]])

Whether to do certain operations in the database or outside may involve a trade-off. For example, removing duplicates using &lt;tt&gt;distinct&lt;/tt&gt; may be slow in the database; thus, it makes sense to do it outside. On the other side, if using &lt;tt&gt;distinct&lt;/tt&gt; significantly (x100) decreases the number of rows to be extracted, then it makes sense to remove duplications as early as possible in the database before unloading data.

A common source of problems in ETL is a big number of dependencies among ETL jobs. For example, job "B" cannot start while job "A" is not finished. One can usually achieve better performance by visualizing all processes on a graph, and trying to reduce the graph making maximum use of [[parallel computing|parallelism]], and making "chains" of consecutive processing as short as possible. Again, partitioning of big tables and their indices can really help.

Another common issue occurs when the data are spread among several databases, and processing is done in those databases sequentially. Sometimes database replication may be involved as a method of copying data between databases - it can significantly slow down the whole process. The common solution is to reduce the processing graph to only three layers:

* Sources
* Central ETL layer
* Targets

This approach allows processing to take maximum advantage of parallelism. For example, if you need to load data into two databases, you can run the loads in parallel (instead of loading into the first - and then replicating into the second).

Sometimes processing must take place sequentially. For example, dimensional (reference) data are needed before one can get and validate the rows for main [[Fact table|"fact" tables]].

== Parallel processing ==
A {{as of|2009|alt=recent}} development in ETL software is the implementation of [[Parallel computing|parallel processing]]. It has enabled a number of methods to improve overall performance of ETL when dealing with large volumes of data.

ETL applications implement three main types of parallelism:

* Data: By splitting a single sequential file into smaller data files to provide [[Parallel Random Access Machine|parallel access]]
* [[pipeline (computing)|Pipeline]]: allowing the simultaneous running of several components on the same [[data stream]], e.g. looking up a value on record 1 at the same time as adding two fields on record 2
* Component: The simultaneous running of multiple [[process (computing)|processes]] on different data streams in the same job, e.g. sorting one input file while removing duplicates on another file

All three types of parallelism usually operate combined in a single job.

An additional difficulty comes with making sure that the data being uploaded is relatively consistent. Because multiple source databases may have different update cycles (some may be updated every few minutes, while others may take days or weeks), an ETL system may be required to hold back certain data until all sources are synchronized. Likewise, where a warehouse may have to be reconciled to the contents in a source system or with the general ledger, establishing synchronization and reconciliation points becomes necessary.

== Rerunnability, recoverability ==

Data warehousing procedures usually subdivide a big ETL process into smaller pieces running sequentially or in parallel. To keep track of data flows, it makes sense to tag each data row with "row_id", and tag each piece of the process with "run_id". In case of a failure, having these IDs help to roll back and rerun the failed piece.

Best practice also calls for ''checkpoints'', which are states when certain phases of the process are completed. Once at a checkpoint, it is a good idea to write everything to disk, clean out some temporary files, log the state, etc.

== Virtual ETL ==

{{as of|2010}}, [[data virtualization]] had begun to advance ETL processing. The application of data virtualization to ETL allowed solving the most common ETL tasks of [[data migration]] and application integration for multiple dispersed data sources. Virtual ETL operates with the abstracted representation of the objects or entities gathered from the variety of relational, semi-structured, and unstructured data sources. ETL tools can leverage object-oriented modeling and work with entities' representations persistently stored in a centrally located [[hub-and-spoke]] architecture. Such a collection that contains representations of the entities or objects gathered from the data sources for ETL processing is called a metadata repository and it can reside in memory&lt;ref&gt;[http://itnewscast.com/etl-architecture-and-business-models Virtual ETL]&lt;/ref&gt; or be made persistent. By using a persistent metadata repository, ETL tools can transition from one-time projects to persistent middleware, performing data harmonization and [[data profiling]] consistently and in near-real time.

== Dealing with keys ==
[[Unique key]]s play an important part in all relational databases, as they tie everything together. A unique key is a column that identifies a given entity, whereas a [[foreign key]] is a column in another table that refers to a primary key. Keys can comprise several columns, in which case they are composite keys. In many cases, the primary key is an auto-generated integer that has no meaning for the [[Business entity (computer science)|business entity]] being represented, but solely exists for the purpose of the relational database - commonly referred to as a [[surrogate key]].

As there is usually more than one data source getting loaded into the warehouse, the keys are an important concern to be addressed. For example: customers might be represented in several data sources, with their [[Social Security Number]] as the primary key in one source, their phone number in another, and a surrogate in the third. Yet a data warehouse may require the consolidation of all the customer information into one [[Dimension (data warehouse)|dimension]].

A recommended way to deal with the concern involves adding a warehouse surrogate key, which is used as a foreign key from the fact table.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, The Data Warehouse Lifecycle Toolkit, p 332&lt;/ref&gt;

Usually, updates occur to a dimension's source data, which obviously must be reflected in the data warehouse.

If the primary key of the source data is required for reporting, the dimension already contains that piece of information for each row. If the source data uses a surrogate key, the warehouse must keep track of it even though it is never used in queries or reports; it is done by creating a [[lookup table]] that contains the warehouse surrogate key and the originating key.&lt;ref&gt;Golfarelli/Rizzi, Data Warehouse Design, p 291&lt;/ref&gt; This way, the dimension is not polluted with surrogates from various source systems, while the ability to update is preserved.

The lookup table is used in different ways depending on the nature of the source data.
There are 5 types to consider;&lt;ref&gt;Golfarelli/Rizzi, Data Warehouse Design, p 291&lt;/ref&gt; three are included here:
;Type 1
:The dimension row is simply updated to match the current state of the source system; the warehouse does not capture history; the lookup table is used to identify the dimension row to update or overwrite
;Type 2
:A new dimension row is added with the new state of the source system; a new surrogate key is assigned; source key is no longer unique in the lookup table
;Fully logged
:A new dimension row is added with the new state of the source system, while the previous dimension row is updated to reflect it is no longer active and time of deactivation.

== Tools ==
By using an established ETL framework, one may increase one's chances of ending up with better connectivity and [[scalability]].{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} A good ETL tool must be able to communicate with the many different [[relational database]]s and read the various file formats used throughout an organization. ETL tools have started to migrate into [[Enterprise Application Integration]], or even [[Enterprise Service Bus]], systems that now cover much more than just the extraction, transformation, and loading of data. Many ETL vendors now have [[data profiling]], [[data quality]], and [[Metadata (computing)|metadata]] capabilities. A common use case for ETL tools include converting CSV files to formats readable by relational databases. A typical translation of millions of records is facilitated by ETL tools that enable users to input csv-like data feeds/files and import it into a database with as little code as possible.

ETL tools are typically used by a broad range of professionals - from students in computer science looking to quickly import large data sets to database architects in charge of company account management, ETL tools have become a convenient tool that can be relied on to get maximum performance. ETL tools in most cases contain a GUI that helps users conveniently transform data, using a visual data mapper, as opposed to writing large programs to parse files and modify data types.

While ETL tools have traditionally been for developers and IT staff, the new trend is to provide these capabilities to business users so they can themselves create connections and data integrations when needed, rather than going to the IT staff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Inexorable Rise of Self Service Data Integration|url=http://blogs.gartner.com/andrew_white/2015/05/22/the-inexorable-rise-of-self-service-data-integration/|accessdate=31 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gartner refers to these non-technical users as Citizen Integrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embrace the Citizen Integrator|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2891817/embrace-citizen-integrator-approach-improve}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== ETL vs. ELT ==

ELT is a variant of ETL where the extracted data is loaded into the target system first. &lt;ref name="AWS Data Warehousing 9" &gt; Amazon Web Services, Data Warehousing on AWS, p 9&lt;/ref&gt;
The architecture for the analytics pipeline shall also consider where to cleans and enrich data &lt;ref name="AWS Data Warehousing 9" /&gt; as well as how to conform dimensions. &lt;ref name="Kimball 2004" /&gt; 

Cloud-based data warehouses like [[Amazon Redshift]], [[Google BigQuery]], and [[Snowflake Computing]] have been able to provide highly scalable computing power. This lets businesses forgo preload transformations and replicate raw data into their data warehouses, where it can transform them as needed using [[SQL]]. 

After having used ELT data may be processed further and stored in a data mart &lt;ref &gt;Amazon Web Services, Data Warehousing on AWS, 2016, p 10 &lt;/ref&gt;.

Asher dropped out of school at the age of 16 and worked as a [[technical drawing|draftsman]] in a local [[factory]]. Later he worked in a [[Trade union|union]] job painting [[radio]] towers, with a house painting business on the side. Asher moved to [[Florida]] to avoid the seasonal shutdown in painting, soon establishing a business painting [[condominium]]s on Florida's Gold Coast. By the age of 21, he had 100 painters working for him and was reportedly grossing US$10 million a year.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

In 1982 Asher smuggled [[cocaine]] while living in the [[Bahamas]] over a seven-week stint, flying to [[Colombia]] and [[Belize]] in his plane. Later he joined [[F. Lee Bailey]] and the [[Drug Enforcement Administration]], convincing other Americans in Bahamas to exit the drug trade.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt; "He was never charged with a crime, but a cloud of negative publicity has hung over his head for years, even prompting his resignation from Seisint's board [in 2003]." &lt;ref name="Sun-Sentinel.com"&gt;*[http://articles.sun-sentinel.com/2004-07-16/business/0407151226_1_seisint-cancer-research-homeland-security Boca's Seisint Sold In $775 Million Deal], "Sun Sentinel" July 16, 2004, loaded December 2, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the company Hank Asher founded, TLO, was in bankruptcy court with a claim of liabilities at $109 million.&lt;ref name="bizjournals.com"&gt;*[http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/blog/2013/05/tlo-bankruptcy-is-company-worth-20m.html], "South Florida Business journal" May 2013&lt;/ref&gt; In 2014, [[TransUnion]] acquired TLO for $154 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=TransUnion Closes Acquisition of TLO|url=http://www.insidearm.com/daily/collection-technologies/collection-technology/transunion-closes-acquisition-of-tlo-after-judge-approves/|website=Inside Arm|publisher=Inside Arm|accessdate=13 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enters data fusion business ==
Unemployed, Asher began operating as a freelance [[computer]] [[computer programmer|programmer]]. In 1992, he started a business [[DBT Online Inc|Database Technologies]] that used clusters of PCs to provide [[parallel supercomputing]] in place of more expensive mainframes and mini computers. His first contract was a data mining application for the insurance industry performed on records bought from the Florida's Department of Motor Vehicles.

DBT Online bought Asher out for US$147 million in 1999 after the FBI and the Drug Enforcement Administration suspended their contracts following revelations with Asher's involvements in drug dealing in the Bahamas and concerns that the company could potentially monitor targets of investigations.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

Asher blamed his ouster from Database Technologies on board member [[Kenneth Langone]] who joined the company at his invitation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2005/03/21/story1.html Database pioneer ready for new adventure], ''South Florida Business Journal'', 21 March 2005, loaded 2 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

After departing DBT Online, Asher founded [[Seisint]] in 1999 by merging two companies.

ChoicePoint Public Records filed a lawsuit against Asher and Seisint in 2001 at [[Palm Beach County]] [[Circuit Court]], alleging Seisint stole technology, including source code and computer hardware. Asher counter-sued in 2001 in the [[Fort Lauderdale]] U.S. [[United States district court|District Court]] alleging unfair business practices by ChoicePoint Director [[Kenneth Langone]] and sought more than US$1.6 billion in damages. Both suits were dismissed on 8 March 2005 after ChoicePoint settled with Asher.

While at Seisint, Hank Asher played a leading role in developing the [[Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange]] (MATRIX) [[datamining]] system for the [[Florida Department of Law Enforcement]], described as a tool to help state law enforcement officials identify potential [[terrorist]]s. The MATRIX program was shut down in June 2005 after federal funding was cut in the wake of public concerns over privacy and state surveillance.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-205261 MATRIX data mining system is unplugged] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070713221011/http://www.privacyinternational.org/article.shtml?cmd%5B347%5D=x-347-205261 |date=2007-07-13 }}, ''Privacy International'', 5 June 2005, loaded 30 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Seisint was later sold to Anglo-Dutch publishing giant Reed Elsevier in July 2004, for US$775 million and combined with its own data aggregation subsidiary, [[LexisNexis]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/929869/000115697305001249/u49186e6vk.htm], {{cite web|url=http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?ReleaseID%3D134074%26NewsAreaID%3D2%26NavigatedFromSearch%3DTrue |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930170829/http://www.gnn.gov.uk/content/detail.asp?ReleaseID=134074&amp;NewsAreaID=2&amp;NavigatedFromSearch=True |archivedate=2007-09-30 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Asher had retained a large stake in the company and said in an interview that he would earn more than $250 million from the sale.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A50577-2004Jul14.html LexisNexis to Buy Seisint for $775 Million], ''Washington Post'', 15 July 2004, loaded 2 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Asher made considerable donations to U.S. political parties and candidates amounting to US$735,000 from 1999 to 2004 including US$505,000 to the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrats]].&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

==Philanthropy==

===Work with Missing and Exploited Children===
Over the course of his career in the data business, Asher donated the services of his respective companies to an indeterminable number of law enforcement agencies and most notably the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].  "No fewer than 109 children have been found as a direct result of Asher's help" according to [[Ernie Allen]], president of [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].  Asher is the largest private donor in the history of the [[National Center for Missing and Exploited Children]].&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

His final venture, TLO, focuses directly on aiding these same groups in the mission of protecting children.  Asher supplied law enforcement in all 50 states and 39 countries a system that identifies pedophiles in cyberspace and is responsible for thousands of arrests and child rescues.&lt;ref name="businessweek.com"/&gt;  He has attracted many prominent leaders to assist or support TLO:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.palmbeachpost.com/localnews/content/local_news/epaper/2009/03/14/0314asher.html Boca database entrepreneur turns his attention from terrorists to pedophiles] ''Palm Beach Post'', 14 March 2009, loaded 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2009/04/06/daily44.html Asher attracts ‘Most Wanted’ support] "South Florida Business Journal", 9 April 2009, loaded 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2009, Reed Elsevier filed a suit in Palm Beach County Circuit Court which alleged Asher violated his non-compete agreement with the formation of TLO.  At the time, Reed Elsevier's attorney, Faith Gay stated, "He is out trying to sell a commercial product.  We're seeking damages for any harm that Asher has caused to our customer base...."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2009/03/30/daily75.html Hank Asher sued by former company] "South Florida Business Journal", 3 April 2009, loaded 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Asher responded with a counter-suit seeking $1 billion in damages.  He said, "This lawsuit is completely without merit, and is a sad and disingenuous attempt to slow down the enormous progress we are making in our efforts to rescue children from sexual predators. I have given my systems to NCMEC for free since 1993. Every child that is rescued because of one of my systems is a paycheck for my soul. The allegation that someday I would charge for this work is insane."&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=/www/story/05-01-2009/0005017594&amp;EDATE 'Sham-ful' Behaviour: European Reed Elsevier Countersued for $1 Billion] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322114810/http://news.prnewswire.com/ViewContent.aspx?ACCT=109&amp;STORY=%2Fwww%2Fstory%2F05-01-2009%2F0005017594&amp;EDATE |date=2012-03-22 }} "PRNewswire" 1 May 2009, loaded 26 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was dismissed 15 days prior to the expiration of the non-compete on September 1, 2009.  Asher commented "I find it kind of hysterical that they sued me before I competed and the case was dismissed before the non-compete ended."&lt;ref&gt;[http://southflorida.bizjournals.com/southflorida/stories/2009/08/17/daily23.html LexisNexis suit against Asher dismissed] "South Florida Business Journal" 18 August 2009, loaded 20 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancer Research===
Asher began his cancer research in 2001, when he put together a team of doctors and scientists.  He started by philanthropically funding and working with [[Mayo Clinic]] scientists on research projects he thought had promise.  Simultaneously he started clinical trials in [[Costa Rica]] to find a cure for his sister's newly diagnosed disease, [[Multiple Myeloma]].

In 2004, Asher formed JARI Research Foundation a philanthropic endeavor to support breakthrough cancer research.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jari-research.org/management/hank_asher.html Jari Research] loaded 2 April 2007 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071008070814/http://www.jari-research.org/management/hank_asher.html |date=October 8, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The foundation evolved into JARI Research Corporation a year later, in cooperation with the Mayo Clinic.  Clinical trials are conducted in the [[Dominican Republic]].

===Major Events===
Asher has a history of dedicating his personal efforts and the resources of his companies in times of crisis.  Two notable events are the [[September 11 attacks]] and [[Beltway sniper attacks]].

====Attacks on September 11, 2001====
In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], Asher worked with the [[FBI]], constructing a secure room inside the headquarters of his company at the time, [[Seisint]].  Asher and his team of programmers worked to identify associates of the terrorists, producing lists of individuals "worth investigating" later leading to "several arrests."  Asher said “You could accidentally live next door to Mohammed Atta.  You couldn’t accidentally live next door to Mohammed Atta twice.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vanityfair.com/ontheweb/features/2004/12/matrix200412 The Net's Master Data-miner] "Vanity Fair"&lt;/ref&gt;

====Beltway sniper attacks====
At the height of the 2002 [[Beltway sniper attacks]] in the Washington, D.C., area, Asher worked with the [[FBI]] utilizing his [[data fusion]] invention, the [[Multistate Anti-Terrorism Information Exchange]] known as MATRIX to link investigation details to the real identity of [[John Allen Muhammad]].  
“They produced the list of all his relatives, associates, every place he ever lived,” Asher recounts. “The next morning they were in Tacoma, Washington, cutting the stump down that had the projectiles in it that matched the projectiles from the killings.” The next evening the snipers were apprehended.&lt;ref name="vanityfair.com"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4714">'''Hilde Behrend''' (13 August 1917 – 11 January 2000) was an economist, known for her research into industrial relations and the motivational differences between workers.

== Background and education ==
Hilde Behrend was born on 13 August 1917 in [[Berlin]], Germany. Her father, [[:de:Felix Wilhelm Behrend|Felix Wilhelm Behrend]], was a physics and mathematics teacher and well known educationalist, who was demoted and dismissed by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], due to his Jewish heritage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Neumann|first=B H|year=1963|title=Felix Adalbert Behrend|url=http://www-groups.dcs.st-and.ac.uk/history/Extras/Behrend_LMS_obituary.html|journal=J. London Math. Soc.|volume=38|pages=308–310|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her brother, [[:de:Felix Behrend|Felix Behrend]], became a mathematician. 

In 1936, aged 19 years old, Behrend moved to London. She first worked as a secretary, but in 1941 she started at the [[London School of Economics]] to study [[economics]]. Here, she won the [[University of London]]'s Metcalfe scholarship for women and graduated with honours in economics in 1944.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.elgaronline.com/view/9781852789640.00013.xml|title=Hilde Behrend         :              A Biographical Dictionary of Women Economists|access-date=2017-01-20|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finishing her degree, she taught German and French at a grammar school, before starting work as a research assistant for Professor [[Philip Sargant Florence|Sargant Florence]] at the [[University of Birmingham]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/news/2000/feb/16/guardianobituaries4|title=Hilde Behrend|date=2000-02-15|newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=2017-02-15|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic contributions ==
Behrend completed her PhD on 'Absence Under Full Employment' at Birmingham, before moving to the [[University of Edinburgh]] in 1954, to take up a research lectureship at the new social sciences research centre led by Professor [[John Macmurray]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; She remained at Edinburgh for the whole of her academic career.

Behrend's research focused primarily on labour and [[industrial relations]], in particular the interrelationships between [[economics]] and [[psychology]] in understanding how people operate at work.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dawkins|first=Peter|title=Book Reviews : Problems of Labour and Inflation|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/002218568602800120|journal=Journal of Industrial Relations|volume=28|issue=1|pages=159–161|doi=10.1177/002218568602800120}}&lt;/ref&gt; She coined the phrase 'effort bargaining', in relation to her research into the ways in which workers relate their effort to the pay they receive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences/dictionaries-thesauruses-pictures-and-press-releases/effort-bargaining|title=effort bargaining - Dictionary definition of effort bargaining {{!}} Encyclopedia.com: FREE online dictionary|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|access-date=2017-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; She also came up with the 'blue Monday index' which measures the difference between Monday’s and Friday’s absence rates, and how these voluntary absence varied by types of worker.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5064">The modern '''Australian native food industry''', also called the '''[[bushfood]] industry''', had its initial beginnings in the 1970s and early 1980s, when regional enthusiasts and researchers started to target local native species. In the mid 1970s Brian Powell recognized the commercial potential of [[Santalum acuminatum|quangdong]] fruit and began its cultivation in orchards. Following this, the [[CSIRO]] became involved in quangdong research.

In the late 1970s, [[Peter Hardwick]] began investigating subtropical native plants suitable for commercial cropping, selecting fruit species like [[riberry]], [[Davidsonia]], and later leaf-spices, like [[lemon myrtle]], [[Aniseed myrtle]], and [[Dorrigo Pepper]]. Hardwick started targeting strong flavoured species suitable for processing, which later became the main industry strategy. In the 1980s, Hardwick worked in the New South Wales Department of Agriculture, where he met essential oils researcher, Dr Ian Southwell. Southwell played a significant role in providing the [[essential oil]] profiles of many of the most popular native spices.

In 1983. the University of Sydney's Human Nutrition Unit, headed by [[Jennie Brand-Miller]], undertook a nutritional analysis programme analyzing bushfood for Aboriginal health. [[Vic Cherikoff]], a member of the Human Nutrition Unit team, started-up a wholesale distribution company marketing native Australian ingredients. Cherikoff played a vital role in linking-up the [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] and regional bushfood research with the restaurant and food processing industry. Cherikoff also contributed to Jennifer Isaacs' book, ''Bush Food'' and authored ''The Bushfood Handbook'' and ''Uniquely Australian, A wildfood cookbook'' which publicly defined the emerging industry.

In the mid-1980s several Australian theme restaurants opened-up in [[Sydney]]. This included ''Rowntrees The Australian Restaurant'', run by Chef [[Jean-Paul Bruneteau]] and Jenny Dowling. In 1996, Bruneteau, Dowling and Cherikoff opened a second restaurant, ''Riberries – Taste Australia''. ''Edna’s Table'' restaurant also opened-up and was run by brother and sister team, Chef Raymond Kersh and Jennice Kersh. The ''Red Ochre Grill'' in [[Adelaide]] opened-up in the early 1990s, with Andrew Fielke as its chef. Fielke also co-founded a production company, ''Australian Native Produce Industries'' (ANPI).

Value-added production emerged in the late 1980s with products marketed via mainstream retailers. Ian and Juleigh Robbins, established a line of processed sauces, jams and dried spice products through ''Robin's Foods Pty Ltd''. Boutique value-added production − such as jams, sauces and beverages – has become increasingly significant in the regional development of native foods.

Small-scale trial commercial production of native food plants started to occur in the late 1980s, especially in Northern New South Wales. In 1994 the [[Rural Industries Research and Development Corporation]] and [[Greening Australia]] co-sponsored a conference on growing bushfoods near Lismore. The [[2000 Olympic Games]], in Sydney, were targeted by the developing industry as an event for promoting native foods.

Various regionally based industry associations were formed to represent growers in a national process. Government agencies have become increasingly involved with new native crop development. [[CSIRO]] researcher, Dr Stephen Sykes,  developed a range of native ''Citrus'' hybrids which became available through ANPI.

Since 2000 the industry has continued to consolidate, with a growing overseas market for produce and greater refinement in production methods to supply the demand. Some new products have been introduced, including [[Finger Lime]], mintbush and ''[[Eucalyptus olida]]''. However, while the rate of introduction of new native food-plant species has slowed since the early period of the industries conception in the 1980s, the marketing of herb and spice blends, fruit mixtures and functional extracts has grown, potentially leading the industry into new and larger market segments.

Crops initially associated mainly with bushfood, such as [[lemon myrtle]], have since broadened to become associated with [[essential oils]] and [[cosmetics]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9520">'''Institute of Corporate Directors''' ('''ICD''') is primarily an institute of, for and by corporate directors established in the [[Philippines]]. It is made up mainly of individuals and [[reputational agent]]s committed to the professional practice of corporate directorship in line with global principles of modern [[corporate governance]].

==About ICD==

It is a non-stock, not-for-profit organization working in close partnership with other business, government and civil society organizations. As an independent and autonomous institute, it is open to working with others in the pursuit of systemic corporate governance reforms by networking with various institutes all over East Asia to enrich Director Education and share best practices in corporate governance.

ICD certifies those who have qualified as '''Fellows''' of the Institute. It caters to the continuing professional needs of its Fellows by setting standards for the professional practice of corporate directorship. It conducts advocacy programs designed to foster good governance and responsible citizenship.

ICD is active in conducting research and developing training materials for corporate directors and other professionals committed to the practice of modern corporate governance.  It offers training programs that promote the knowledge, skills, and values demanded by modern corporate governance. Thus, ICD regularly conducts the C'''orporate Governance Orientation Course (CGOP)''' as well as other programs on related subjects. Its flagship program is the '''Professional Directors Program (PDP)''', which is the first step towards becoming a Fellow of the Institute.

As an added service, ICD assists in the formulation and implementation of corporate governance improvement programs among organizations by facilitating institutional '''Governance Retreats''' for boards. ICD also assists in the formulation and implementation of corporate governance improvement programs in specific boards where its members serve. This includes the creation of Board and Director '''Performance Evaluation Systems''', '''Continuing Education Programs''', and the like.

Another of ICD's important contributions is the development of the annual '''Corporate Governance Scorecards'''.

ICD is a major player in Philippine corporate governance reform initiatives working closely with the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, The Global Corporate Governance Forum, and International Corporate Governance Network on improving actual boardroom practices: moving away from principles into actual practices.

It works closely with key regulators with direct immediate interest in corporate governance: Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas, Securities and Exchange Commission and the Insurance Commission.

It is a founding member of the Institutes of Directors in East Asia Network (IDEA.Net).

==Corporate Governance Scorecard Project==

ICD proposed the Corporate Governance Scorecard Project (CG-Sc) as an East Asian regional initiative to:
* promote transparency and accountability, and the general practice of Good Corporate Governance, and
* provide a standard method for measurement, ranking and progress tracking of Corporate Governance practices.

Through the Institutes of Directors in East Asia (IDEA.net) and with the Thai Institute of Directors (IoD) volunteering to take charge of moving the initiative forward, five East Asian economies - namely Thailand, China, Hong Kong, Indonesia, and the Philippines  - adopted this project.

Since 2005, the CG Scorecard created by ICD has been uniquely tailored in order to incorporate specific needs of the Philippines’ local corporate setting. In doing so, the ICD and its fellow proponents hope to promote corporate governance awareness in various business sectors.

The [[Center for International Private Enterprise]] (CIPE) in Washington, D.C., a private organization which promotes market-enterprise among developing nations through business reforms is instrumental in the funding of this project.

==Performance Governance System==

ICD has launched Performance Governance System (PGS), modified and adopted from Kaplan and Norton's [[Balanced Scorecard]], to promote higher standards of corporate governance practices within institutions. Through the systematized framework, complemented by a carefully designed and tailor-made support service, the PGS aims to help institutional partners achieve higher levels of business performance driven by a properly functioning governance mechanism and centered on strategy formulation and strategy execution. The end goal is to sustain the promotion of a governance culture at al levels, founded upon ethics and social responsibility, which positively impacts the use of corporate strategy to achieve breakthrough performance.

The four phases:
*1. Initiation
*2. Compliance
*3. Proficiency
*4. Institutionalization

==Training programs==

'''Corporate Governance Orientation Program (CGOP)'''

The Institute of Corporate Directors offers a one-day Orientation Course once every quarter. A preparatory course for the Professional Directors Program (PDP), the discussions and structured learning in this one-day interactive program will examine the responsibilities of directors and the collective role of the board, and explore pointers for performance as practical tools to make the board work more effectively. Designed to familiarize directors and top management with Corporate Governance in the Philippine setting, this course focuses on: the principles of Good Governance, Best Practices, and Finance. An additional half-day session on Audit, Risk, and Governance Committees is made available especially for individuals in the banking or financial sector. Exclusive runs are also conducted for companies that require more customized sessions.

'''Professional Directors Program (PDP)'''

The PDP is an intensive 5-day course which includes an orientation course (the Corporate Governance Orientation Program (CGOP)), plus whole day, interactive sessions on: Strategy, Policy, Monitoring, and Accountability. This program, which seeks to provide a deeper appreciation of the demands of professional directorship, is offered once every quarter. ICD accredits corporate directors committed to enhancing the long-term value of the corporation they serve through the observance of corporate governance principles, ethics and social responsibility. The PDP is the first step towards becoming a Fellow of the Institute.

'''Board Retreat'''

For Boards who seek to systematically plot their course towards the fourth phase of the PGS (Institutionalization), this 2-3 day working session is aimed at "roadmapping" and developing clear action programs that are geared towards bringing the corporation’s governance system to international standards. This completes the first phase (Initiation) and helps the company to transition to the second phase of the Performance Governance System (Compliance.)

'''Specialized Modules and Working Sessions'''

Specialized courses on Audit Committees, Risk Management Committees, Governance Committees, Corporate Secretaries, Compliance Officers, Financial Numeracy for Directors, and the like are offered. Customized courses on governance and professional directorship are likewise available for individuals, corporations, organizations and groups.

==Services==

'''Performance Evaluation System'''

The ICD provides advice and technical assistance in the development and implementation of Performance Evaluation Systems, mainly for the Board and its committees, tailored to the needs and specifications of the client.

'''CG Scorecard Result Presentations'''

The Corporate Governance Scorecard Project provides a standard against which companies can measure their practices. Board presentations allow the directors to see which particular areas need improvement and how best to implement the appropriate reforms. The ICD has also launched two related programs: Raising the Scores and Broadening Participation. These support ICD’s goal of increasing the number of participating companies as well as helping companies improve their practices and as a corollary, improve their scores.

'''Board Advisory and Consultation'''

The ICD may also serve as advisor or consultant for various purposes or issues related to corporate governance.

==Other activities==

The ICD regularly conducts:
*Monthly Roundtables
*ICD Annual Dinner
*ICD Annual Working Session
*Investors' Forums
*CG Scorecard (measuring CG practices of publicly listed companies, state-owned enterprises (or government-owned and -controlled companies), family-owned and -controlled companies, banks, and the insurance sector.

'''James Elliot Cabot''' (June 18, 1821 – January 16, 1903)&lt;ref name=Higginson /&gt; was an American philosopher and author, born in [[Boston]] to [[Samuel Cabot, Jr.]], and Eliza Cabot. James (known by his family and friends as "Elliot") had six brothers: Thomas Handasyd Cabot (b. 1814), [[Samuel Cabot III]] (b. 1815), [[Edward Clarke Cabot]] (b. 1818), Stephen Cabot (b. 1826), Walter Channing Cabot (b. 1829), and Louis Cabot (b. 1837).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/59686021 "James Elliot 'Elliot' Cabot,"] FindAGrave.com. Accessed January 6, 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having received his [[bachelor's degree]] from [[Harvard Law School]] in 1845, Elliot started a law firm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YpFM3vxwPjIC&amp;pg=PA265&amp;lpg=PA260&amp;ots=pinfyQmZLE&amp;dq=James+Elliot+Cabot|pages=264|title=The Early Years of the Saturday Club|last=Waldo Emerson|first=Edward|publisher=Ayer Publishing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught [[philosophy]] at [[Harvard]] and was a [[transcendentalist]] and edited the ''Massachusetts Quarterly Review'', beginning in 1848.

Cabot argued that we do not experience space directly, that space is "a system of relations, it cannot be given in any one sensation. [...] Space is a symbol of the general relatedness of objects constructed by thought from data which lie below consciousness." Cabot was of the opinion that the position of something in space was not felt at all, but deduced from perceived relations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bZsKAIrzW4EC&amp;pg=PA197&amp;lpg=PA197&amp;dq=James+Elliot+Cabot&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9zVBuuuvLf&amp;sig=9JcUxLfwPl6lEVcD6On3pHSB6Kw&amp;hl=en|title=William James: In the Maelstrom of American Modernism: a Biography|publisher=[[Houghton Mifflin Harcourt]]|date=2007-09-14|first=Robert D.|last=Richardson|ISBN=0-618-91989-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabot was a correspondent of [[Henry David Thoreau]].

His biography of [[Ralph Waldo Emerson]] was criticized for its lack of colour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Arranging the Sibylline Leaves: James Elliot Cabot's Work as Emerson's Literary Executor|author=Nancy Craig Simmons|journal=Studies in the American Renaissance|year=1983|pages=335–389}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cabot and his wife Elizabeth had five sons, the most notable of them being [[Richard Clarke Cabot]]&lt;ref name=papers&gt;[http://oasis.lib.harvard.edu/oasis/deliver/~hua02998 "Cabot, Richard C. (Richard Clarke), 1868–1939. Papers of Richard Clarke Cabot : an inventory,"] Harvard University archives. Accessed Jan. 5, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; (1868–1939), a physician who advanced clinical [[hematology]], was an innovator in teaching methods, and a pioneer in [[social work]].

'''Kennedy Scholarships''' provide full funding for up to ten British post-graduate students to study at either [[Harvard University]] or the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]] (MIT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Quigley-Jones|first1=Jennifer|title=Think Harvard's too hard to get into?

==The creation of the Kennedy Memorial Trust==
Following the assassination of President [[John F. Kennedy]] in 1963, Sir [[Alec Douglas-Home]], the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom]], set about creating a national British memorial in his memory. He consulted with [[Harold Wilson]] (the Leader of HM's Loyal Opposition), Sir [[David Ormsby-Gore]] ([[British Ambassador to the United States]]), [[Dean Rusk]] ([[United States Secretary of State]]) and the Kennedy family. It was agreed that Douglas-Home would establish a committee, chaired by [[Lord Franks]] (former [[British Ambassador to the United States of America]]), to make recommendations on the form of the memorial to President Kennedy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.kennedytrust.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt;

Following wide consultation, Franks wrote to the Prime Minister to recommend that the memorial should be in two parts: a living memorial, in the form of a scholarship to attend either Harvard or MIT, and a permanent memorial site in [[Runnymede]], England, the site of the [[Magna Carta]]. This location was chosen because it was regarded as the birthplace of the freedoms which President Kennedy promised to uphold. The John F. Kennedy Memorial Act 1964 was passed into legislation to enact and manage the two memorials.

==Kennedy family==
[[Image:Runnymede-jfk.jpg|thumb|right|JFK Memorial designed by [[Geoffrey Jellicoe]]]]
The Kennedy family have been strong supporters of the British Kennedy memorial since its creation. Prior to the United States' entry into the Second World War, [[Joseph P. Kennedy Sr.]] served as the [[United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom]]. In 1965, [[Jacqueline Kennedy]] and [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom]] unveiled the memorial at Runnymede. It consists of a [[Portland stone]] memorial tablet within natural woodland and meadow, where the visitor is invited on a journey, resembling that in ''[[Pilgrim's Progress]]''; the journey through what is seen is mirrored by a deeper one into the unseen landscape of life, death and spirit. The stone is inscribed with the famous quote from Kennedy's Inaugural Address given on 20 January 1961:

{{quote|Let every Nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend or oppose any foe, in order to assure the survival and success of liberty.}}

[[United States Senate|Senator]] [[Ted Kennedy|Edward Kennedy]] described the program as the most ambitious of all the memorials to his brother, and he was a passionate supporter of the Kennedy Scholarships until his death in August 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/04.19/99-kennedy.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070717173530/http://www.news.harvard.edu/gazette/2007/04.19/99-kennedy.html|archivedate=17 July 2007|title=Kennedy Scholarship Program to expand|publisher=News.harvard.edu|accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In total, 505 individuals have been awarded a Kennedy Scholarship. Selection follows a national competition which begins each autumn. A long-list and short-list are chosen and then around twenty-five individuals are invited to London for interview by the trustees.

When evaluating applications and interviewing candidates, the trustees take into consideration candidates':
* intellectual attainment
* readiness and ability to express themselves
* the suitability of their proposed course of study at Harvard or MIT.

They may also look for: originality of mind, commitment to public service, potential to make a mark in public life and the ability to overcome adversity

The selection aims, criteria and standards are comparable to the Rhodes Scholarship program.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/magazine/4585136.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – Magazine – JFK's legacy|publisher=News.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=2015-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Base''' (LADOL), officially '''LADOL Free Zone''', also known as '''LADOL Base''' or the initials '''LFZ''', is an industrial [[Special Economic Zone|Free Zone]] privately owned logistics and engineering facility located on an island  in the Port of [[Apapa]], [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]].

LADOL was designed to provide logistics, engineering and other support services to offshore oil &amp; gas exploration and production companies operating in and around West Africa.

== History ==
[[File:Ladol Activity at quay.jpg|thumb]]
LADOL's developer, LiLe, began the construction of the logistics and engineering base in 2001 and commenced full operations in 2006. In June 2006, LADOL was designated as a [[Free economic zone|Free Zone]] pursuant to the Nigeria Export Processing Zones Act No. 63 1992. Completed at a cost of US$150 million, LADOL's initial infrastructures included: a 200m quay, 8.5m draft, 25-ton/m2 high load bearing area and additional 30-ton bollards at either end that can accommodate up to six [[platform supply vessel|supply vessels]] and three [[heavy-lift ship|heavy-lift vessels]]; a hotel; warehouse; office complex; road; water treatment; and underground reticulation.

In 2015, with the support of [[Total S.A.|Total]] Upstream Nigeria Limited, LADOL was further expanded to include a new US$300 million [[Floating Production Storage and Offloading]] (FPSO) vessel fabrication and integration facility. The FPSO vessel fabrication and integration facility - currently being operated by SHI-MCI FZE, a Nigerian Local Content initiative-driven incorporated [[joint venture]] between [[Samsung Heavy Industries]] and LADOL's [[shipyard]] operator, Mega-Construction and Integration FZE - was initiated to fabricate and integrate Total Egina FPSO in Nigeria and other similar projects expected to be carried out in Africa.

The next phase of LADOL's expansion has been reported to include a [[dry dock]] that will be the largest in West Africa and attract as many as 100,000 direct and indirect jobs.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://www.thebusinessyear.com/nigeria-2015/future-today/interview| TBY talks to Dr. Amy Jadesimi, Managing Director of Lagos Deep Offshore Logistics Base (LADOL), on the company's business model, the joint venture with Samsung, and plans for the near future reported by The Business Year| 2 Mar 2016]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
In December 2015, LADOL won the award for ''‘Outstanding Free Zone Integrated Hub Capacity Building Firm for Deep Water Oil &amp; Gas Exploration, Manufacturing and Engineering Services’'' by The [[Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ladol.com/ladol-wins-award/ LADOL wins award from The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2015, LADOL won 5 awards in [[fDi Magazine]] Global Free Zones of the Year Annual Rankings 2015.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.fdiintelligence.com/Locations/fDi-Global-Free-Zones-of-the-Year-2015-Winners fDi Global Free Zones of the Year 2015 – Winners]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt; It was awarded ''winner of the Sub-Saharan African regional free zones award'' and ''winner of the Large Tenants award'' for Africa. LADOL was also ''Highly Commended as African Free Zone of the year''.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ladol.com/ladol-wins-5-awards-in-fdi-global-free-zones-of-the-year-annual-rankings-2015/ LADOL wins 5 awards in fDi Global Free Zones of the Year Annual Rankings 2015]'' Retrieved 29 May 2016&lt;/ref&gt;

AMERICA BY DESIGN, 2013. p. 278.&lt;/ref&gt; predecessor of the [[American Management Association]].
	
== Biography ==
=== Youth, education and early career ===
Charles Lee Galloway was born in [[Durand, Wisconsin]] in 1871, son of William D. Galloway and Ellen (Laskey) Galloway, natives respectively of Canada and England. He obtained his BSc at the [[University of Minnesota]] in 1896, his MA from [[Columbia University]] in 1900, and his PhD from the [[New York University]] in 1907.&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WWA 1944"&gt;''Who's Who in America,''Vol. 23 1944-45. p. 745&lt;/ref&gt;

For his graduate work Galloway had spent some time in European Universities, and was visiting scholar with the British economic historian [[William Ashley (economic historian)|Sir William Ashley]] at the University of Birmingham, and with the German economist [[Johannes Conrad]] at the University of Halle.&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt; 

After his graduation at the University of Minnesota in 1896, Galloway had started his working life as school teacher in Minnesota. From 1901 to 1905 he was assistant principal at a high school in Minneapolis and served as superintendent of city schools at [[South St. Paul, Minnesota|South St. Paul]] and [[Two Harbors, Minnesota|Two Harbors]].&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt;

=== Further career in education and publishing ===
After his graduation at the New York University in 1907, Galloway joined their faculty.&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt; By 1911 he was Assistant Professor of Commerce and Industry in the New York University School of Commerce, now [[New York University Stern School of Business]].&lt;ref&gt;Edwin Walter Kemmerer. ''The Economic Bulletin.'' Volume 3, 1911. p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; In 1918 he was appointed Professor of Commerce and Industry, and in 1919 head of its department of business management. In 1920 he founded and became director of the school of retailing financed by the leading department stores of New York City.&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt; 

In 1912 Galloway had entered the publishing business. He became chairman of the board of The Ronald Press Company, and editor-in-chief. He was consulting editor for a series ''Department Store Merchandise Manuals'' at Ronald Press in 1917, editor of the ''Administration Magazine'' and member of the Advisory Council of the ''Journal of Business''.&lt;ref name="WWA 1944"/&gt;  

In 1912-13 Galloway and [[Frederick C. Henderschott]] had played a pioneering role in the establishing of [[The National Association of Corporation Schools]], where both continued to participate in executive roles.

=== Personal ===
Galloway married June 8, 1900 to Hetty G. Buehler, daughter of William G. Buehler of Minneapolis&lt;ref name="NCAB 1927"/&gt;. She had graduated from the University of Minnesota in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;''The Minnesota Alumni Weekly.'' Vol. XIII November 17, 1913 No. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Management Department at New York University ===
The [[New York University]] in 1914 introduced its first course in [[industrial management]] in a new industrial engineering program. It introduced lesson in ''Factory Organization'' and in ''System  and Organization in Commercial Business,'' about the implications of [[scientific management]] for office and service activities. Nelson (1992) summarized. that in 1916 the New York University:

:"... created a Management department, headed by Lee Galloway, that taught a variety of management courses and a management seminar devoted to controversies over the application of scientific management. No university responded more quickly to the opportunities of the moment. In the following years NYU introduced more specialized courses on industrial and labor management in response to the demands of the swelling student population. Yet courses disappeared as fast as they appeared, faculty turnover was high, and there was no evidence that the swollen curriculum was more than a reaction to the uproar over scientific management and the labor problems of the war period."&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Daniel. "Scientific management and the transformation of university business education." in: ''A Mental Revolution: Scientific Management since Taylor,'' Columbus, OH: Ohio State University Press 1992 (1992): 77-101. p. 93-94&lt;/ref&gt;

Galloway in 1921 published his standard work ''Office Management, Its Principles and Practice,''&lt;ref&gt;Harry Braverman. ''Labor and Monopoly Capital: The Degradation of Work in the Twentieth Century.'' 1998. p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; which would become a well-known book in [[office management]].&lt;ref&gt;Strom, Sharon H. ''Beyond the typewriter: gender, class, and the origins of modern American office work, 1900-1930.'' Vol. 118. University of Illinois Press, 1994. p. 105.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''London International Awards''', or '''LIA''' (formerly known as '''London International Advertising Awards''',''' LIAA'''), are a worldwide awards annually honoring "pioneers, and embodiments of excellence" in advertising, digital media, production, design, music &amp; sound and branded entertainment. It was the first truly international advertising award of its kind to acknowledge all media and methods from all over the world to be judged by a diverse global jury.&lt;ref name="AdNews"&gt;[http://www.adnews.com.au/awards/london-international-awards "AdNews: London International Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
The Awards, founded in 1986 by President Barbara Levy, began by celebrating advertising in the realms of cinema, television, print, and radio internationally, evolving since its inception into 22 unique media types: Ambient, Billboard, Branded Entertainment, Design, Digital, Health &amp; Wellness, Health &amp; Wellness - Craft, Integration, Medical, Medical - Craft, Music &amp; Sound, Music Video, Non-Traditional, Package Design, Poster, Print, Production &amp; Post-Production, Radio &amp; Audio, Social Influencers, The NEW, Television/Cinema/Online Film and Verbal Identity.&lt;ref name="Categories"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/enter/categories/ "2017 Categories"]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, the word "Advertising" was removed from the competition's name to reflect the fact that it observes more than just "advertising" in an ever-changing industry.&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyFour"&gt;London International Awards 2004 Winners &amp; Finalists Annual, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd., 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, LIA, along with creative Faris Yakob, developed "The NEW,"&lt;ref name="Digital"&gt;Pont, Simon (2013). ''Digital State: How the Internet is Changing Everything''. Kogan Page, {{ISBN|978-0749468866}}&lt;/ref&gt; a medium that takes notice of new ''kinds'' of ideas rather than merely new ideas, for works that demonstrate concepts that don't fit comfortably among the standard media divisions, with a focus in fields of technology.&lt;ref name="Categories" /&gt;

In 2014, LIA added Branded Entertainment as a medium. The judging category, first chaired by Jimmy Smith of Amusement Park Entertainment, awards "creativity and the power of the idea across films, television programming, live events, audio, gaming and music videos that engage consumers by entertaining them, rather than through traditional advertising."&lt;ref name="Branded"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/press-release/lia-announces-the-inaugural-branded-entertainment-competition-led-by-jimmy-smith-amusement-park-entertainment/ "LIA Announces the Inaugural Branded Entertainment Competition Led by Jimmy Smith, Amusement Park Entertainment"] Press Release, May 20, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

For 2016, LIA introduced a medium called [[Verbal Identity]],&lt;ref name="LBBVerbal"&gt;[https://lbbonline.com/news/lia-becomes-first-awards-festival-to-introduce-verbal-identity-category/ "LIA Becomes First Awards Festival to Introduce ‘Verbal Identity’ Category"]&lt;/ref&gt; centered on "the long-term verbal assets" of a brand, with sub-categories devoted to naming, taglines, copywriting and tone of voice.&lt;ref name="Categories" /&gt;

New developments for 2017 include the addition of a Health &amp; Pharma competition in response to a "large number of requests from creatives";&lt;ref name="HealthPharma"&gt;[https://www.adgully.com/lia-2017-adds-health-pharma-jeremy-perrott-to-chair-inaugural-juries-71201.html "LIA 2017 adds Health &amp; Pharma; Jeremy Perrott to Chair inaugural Juries"]&lt;/ref&gt; a Social Influencers medium "based on Creativity and Engagement",&lt;ref name="Social"&gt;[https://www.liaawards.com/enter/categories/the-influencer-awards/ "Social Influencers"]&lt;/ref&gt; and a Chinese Creativity Show featuring a unique red statue and executed through a first round of judging in [[China]] and a final judging session simultaneous with the annual LIA Judging.&lt;ref name="China"&gt;[http://www.bizcommunity.com/InBrief/45/12/13293.html "LIA Chinese Creativity Show to recognize works in Chinese"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LIAChina"&gt;[http://www.liachina.com/ "LIA China"]&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[#Judging|Judging]])

[[File:London International Awards Grand LIA Statue.jpg|thumb|left|alt=The statue for the Grand LIA award|Grand LIA Award]]
LIA is one of the largest and most comprehensive awards programs in its field.

As of 2017, the thirteen LIA Jury panels, each one headed by a Jury President, are composed of nearly 100 experienced members of agencies, production companies, design houses, and technology companies. These panels decide on the Gold, Silver and Bronze Statue Winners, as well as the finalists, with each Jury given the non-compulsory opportunity to award a '''Grand LIA''' to a piece of work that has achieved a Gold statue. The judging process is unique in that each Juror sees every piece of work entered within the medium/media that he or she is required to judge.&lt;ref name="2014 Jury Comments"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/jury-comments/2014/ "2014 Archives | LIA Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt; Judging is held annually in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]] over a 7-to-10-day period in late September/early October.&lt;ref name="Key"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/ "Key Dates"]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
[[File:London International Awards Gold Statue.jpg|thumb|right|alt=The statue for the Gold LIA award|Gold LIA Award]]
For 26 years, LIA held its one-night awards ceremony in London. In 2012, it was decided to allocate the budget for the ceremony in favor of bringing a small group of young International Creatives from around the world together to share their experiences and to discuss the future of advertising, design, production, brand-building and the overall state of the creative global markets.&lt;ref name="PressCreate"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/press/press_archive/press_article.cfm?press_id=370&amp;start=51 "LIA 2012 Judging and Inaugural Creative Conversations"] Press Release, October 23, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; (See: [[#Creative LIAisons|Creative LIAisons]])

In 1985, LIA commissioned a British art student named Mary Griffiths to design the LIA statue. The 17" LIA statue is a winged figure that is hand cast in metal prior to a gold, silver, bronze, or black plating (for Grand LIA winners). It stands on a custom black nickel finished base with an engraved plate displaying the year, medium, category, client/brand and the recipient's name and location.&lt;ref name="Statue"&gt;[http://www.rsowens.com/m/Galleries/PrestigeAward "London International Award"] R.S. Owens, Prestige Awards&lt;/ref&gt;

For the first time in 2010, the same year as the Awards' 25th Anniversary,&lt;ref name="Shoot"&gt;[https://www.shootonline.com/spw/45070 "London International Awards Honours Network of the Year Agency of the Year Production Company of the Year"] Shoot Publicity Wire, November 8, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; LIA awarded global '''Network of the Year''', '''Agency of the Year''', and '''Production Company of the Year''' designations. Subsequently, in 2011, LIA added '''Post-Production Company of the Year'''.&lt;ref name="Mill"&gt;[http://www.themill.com/awards "Awards - The Mill"] The Mill&lt;/ref&gt; '''Design Company of the Year,''' '''Independent Agency of the Year,''' '''Music &amp; Sound Company of the Year''' and '''Radio &amp; Audio Company of the Year''' have also been recognized in recent years.&lt;ref name="Winners&amp;Finalists"&gt;[http://2016.liaentries.com/winners/ "Winners &amp; Finalists"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, LIA gave a [[one-off]] award sponsored by [[JetBlue]] to filmmaker  [[Morgan Spurlock|Morgan Spurlock's]] ''[[POM Wonderful Presents: The Greatest Movie Ever Sold]]'', dubbed "The Greatest Award Ever Sold" for its analysis of product placement and the inner workings of the ad industry.&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyEleven"&gt;London International Awards 2011 26th Annual Winners &amp; Finalists, {{ISSN|1793-6039}}, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, LIA added '''Regional 'Of the Year'''' Awards to [[Australia]] / [[New Zealand]], [[Asia]], [[Europe]], [[North America]], the [[Middle East]] / [[Africa]], and [[South America]].&lt;ref name="Regional"&gt;[https://www.liaawards.com/press-release/lia-announces-regional-year-awards-recognize-best-region/ "LIA Announces Regional 'Of The Year' Awards"]&lt;/ref&gt; as additional components of its global 'Of the Year' honors.

Entries submitted for consideration are required to have been broadcast, published, or released commercially with client approval in order to become part of the competition, accompanied by the payment of a required fee based on the category.&lt;ref name="Fees"&gt;[https://liaawards.com/enter/ "Rules of Entry"]&lt;/ref&gt;

In past years, LIA has published a hardbound, full-color Annual showcasing all of the winners and finalists from that given year.&lt;ref name="About"&gt;[http://www.liaawards.com/about/ "About LIA"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="AnnualTwentyEight"&gt;London International Awards 2008 23rd Annual Winners &amp; Finalists, {{ISSN|1793-6039}}, Colourscan Co Pte Ltd, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creative LIAisons ==
As a way of giving back to the industry, LIA launched the 'Creative Conversations' program in 2012. Composed of educational discussions centered on the future of advertising, brand-building and production, the campaign is enforced through a series of seminars, lunches, and dinners that run concurrent with judging. The organization and expenses, including that of travel and hotel accommodations, are wholly funded by LIA.&lt;ref name="CampaignBrief"&gt;[http://www.campaignbrief.com/2013/05/to-do-sunday-pm---london-inter.html "London International Awards Call for Entry Now Open - seven picked for jury duty from Australasia"] Campaign Brief, May 12, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; A large part of the experience's purpose is to bridge relationships between veteran speakers and junior "Young Creatives" from across the globe, the advertising industry's "great teachers" and "young, energetic" minds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hang Li|first1=Daniel|title=Comments|url=https://liaawards.com/creative-liaisons/attendees/2013/|website=www.liaawards.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural 2012 speakers included: Ted Royer, Susan Credle, Israel Diaz, Sonal Dabral, Tony Calcao, Jeremy Craigen, Faris Yakob, Neil French, Phil Growick, Dörte Spengler-Ahrens, Bob Garfield, Jonathon Ker, Ralph van Dijk, and Scott Elias.

'''Ludovicus Stornebrink''' (sometimes written as ''Ludowicus'' and also known as ''Louis Stornebrink''), was the founder of the Yokohama Ice Works in [[Yokohama]], [[Japan]]. Stornebrink was born on March 15, 1847 in [[Rotterdam]], [[The Netherlands]] and moved to Japan at an early age. In 1879 he became the founder and owner of the Yokohama Ice Works, Yokohama's first [[ice factory]].

Stornebrink married a Japanese wife, Hana Ohta, and they had three children. 
Stornebrink died on September 17, 1917 and is buried, together with his wife, who died the following year, at [[Foreign cemeteries in Japan#Yokohama|the Foreign General Cemetery]] in Yokohama. His sister, Gertrude Stornebrink (Feb 21st, 1851- September 1923) is buried in the same grave.

'''Mason Mathews Patrick''' (December 13, 1863 &amp;ndash; January 29, 1942) was a [[general officer]] in the [[United States Army]] who led the [[United States Army Air Service]] during and after [[World War I]] and became the first [[United States Army Air Corps|Chief of the Army Air Corps]] when it was created on July 2, 1926. 

He was born and educated in [[Lewisburg, West Virginia|Lewisburg]], [[West Virginia]] and at age 18 entered [[U.S. Military Academy at West Point]], where he finished second in his class behind classmate [[John J. Pershing]]. Early in his career, he served as [[Chief Engineer]] for the Army of Cuban Pacification and 1st U.S. Army Engineers on the [[U.S.-Mexico border]]. He served in [[France]] during [[World War I]] and was appointed Chief of [[United States Army Air Service|Air Service]] by General Pershing in May 1918. Under his direction the Air Service established experimental facilities at [[Wright Field]], [[Ohio]] and [[San Antonio, Texas]].

In 1926, Patrick drafted and proposed the Air Corps Act (44 ''Stat.'' 780) to the Military Affairs Committee of the [[Congress of the United States|Congress]]. The act created the [[United States Army Air Corps]] from the existing Air Service. Patrick served as commander of the Air Corps until his retirement in 1927. He died in [[Washington, D.C.]] on January 29, 1942.

== Early years ==
Mason Mathews Patrick was born in [[Lewisburg, West Virginia|Lewisburg]], [[Greenbrier County, West Virginia|Greenbrier County]], [[West Virginia]] on December 13, 1863 to Alfred Spicer Patrick and Virginia (Mathews) Patrick.&lt;ref name=White&gt;White, Robert (2001). Mason Patrick. Smithsonian, 2001&lt;/ref&gt; His family was prominent in Greenbrier County. His father was a surgeon who served as such in the [[Confederate States Army]] during the [[American Civil War]]. His paternal grandfather, Spicer Patrick, also a surgeon, served in the [[Virginia House of Delegates]] and the [[Virginia State Senate]] during the Civil War, on the side of the [[Union (American Civil War)|Union]].&lt;ref name=Prom&gt;Atkinson, George and Gibbens, W. (1890). Prominent Men of West Virginia. Callin Publishing, Wheeling, WV, 1890.&lt;/ref&gt; His maternal grandfather, [[Mason Mathews]], was a member of the Virginia House of Delegates during wartime, on the side of the [[Confederacy (American Civil War)|Confederacy]].&lt;ref name="Combs, James Thurl"&gt;Combs, James Thurl (1987). "Greenbrier, C.S.A. Wartime Letters of Mason Mathews to his son Captain Joseph William Mathews, C.S.A." The Journal of the Greenbrier Historical Society (Parsons, West Virginia: Greenbrier Historical Society) V (1): 5-44.&lt;/ref&gt; In Lewisburg, Patrick attended local public and private schools and on graduation taught for two years at his former high school. 

== U.S. Army career ==
===West Point===
Patrick, at age 18, entered the [[U.S. Military Academy at West Point]] on July 1, 1882.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Patrick excelled at West Point in mathematics and engineering, and he was reported to have spoken excellent French. Biographer Robert P. White described young Patrick as "well read, almost Renaissance in nature." &lt;ref name=White/&gt; Outside of the classroom, he received numerous demerits for misconduct; his infractions included tobacco use, use of profanity, lateness, two citations for "sliding down the banister," and he was cited 24 times for being improperly dressed.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; At the academy, he became a friend to classmate [[John J. Pershing]]. Pershing and Patrick held the top two posts in their senior class, being first and second captains of the [[United States Military Academy#Cadet life|Corps of Cadets]], respectively.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Patrick graduated from [[United States Military Academy|West Point]] and was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] of Engineers on June 12, 1886. The following three years he attended the Engineer School of Application, [[Willets Point]], [[New York (state)|New York]], graduating in June 1889. He was promoted to [[1st Lieutenant|first lieutenant]] the following July. 

He returned to West Point as an instructor in 1892, spending the next three years teaching engineering.&lt;ref name=White/&gt; Patrick was involved in [[Mississippi River]] improvements from 1897 to 1901, and after two years in the office of the [[Chief of Engineers]], he again returned to the West Point faculty in 1903. He was promoted to [[Major (United States)|major]] in 1904. He was the [[Chief Engineer]] for the Army of Cuban Pacification from 1907 to 1909 and then worked on river and harbor projects in [[Virginia]] (1909–1912) and [[Michigan]] (1912–1916). He was also a member of a board directing the raising of the [[USS Maine (ACR-1)|USS ''Maine'']] in [[Havana]] Harbor (1910-1912). During this period, he was promoted to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|Lieutenant colonel]] in June 1910 and [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]] on March 24, 1916 and found himself in command of the 1st U.S. Army Engineers serving on the [[U.S.-Mexico border]] in that same year.

=== World War I ===
Patrick was promoted to [[brigadier general]] on August 5, 1917. He was sent to [[France]] that month after America declared war on Germany on August 6 and in September was named Chief Engineer of Lines of Communication and Director of Construction and Forestry of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998
|ISBN= 1571970886|oclc=40298151|pages=294-295 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1918, he was appointed by his old classmate General [[John J. Pershing]] to command the combined [[United States Army Air Service|Air Service]], and subsequently promoted to temporary [[Major General|major general]] in June. Patrick replaced general [[Benjamin Foulois]] as commander, as Pershing had felt staff planning under Foulois had been inefficient, with considerable internal friction as well as conflict between its members and those of Pershing's General Staff. Pershing also felt aircraft and unit totals lagged far behind those promised by Foulois. Considerable house-cleaning of the existing staff resulted from Patrick's appointment, bringing in experienced staff officers to administrate, and tightening up lines of communication.&lt;ref&gt;Tate, Dr. James P. (1998). ''The Army and its Air Corps: Army Policy Toward Aviation 1919-1941'', Air University Press, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; The situation at Air Service headquarters was described as "a tangled mess" before Patrick was brought in. Pershing acknowledged that Foulois requested relief before he was replaced, but the request came only after Foulois became aware of the severity of Pershing's displeasure and attempts in April to rein in his own staff had failed.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} Patrick remained with the Air Service until June 1919, returning then to the U.S. and to various engineering duties, including Assistant Chief of Engineers in 1920.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998
|ISBN= 1571970886|oclc=40298151|pages=294-295 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Air Service ===
[[File:Mason Patrick, in pilot gear.jpg|thumb|left|upright=1.0|Maj. Gen. Mason M. Patrick, learning to fly. Patrick obtained a [[U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Ratings|rating of Junior Airplane Pilot]] in 1922 at the age of 59 years.]]
Patrick was again appointed Chief of the Air Service on October 5, 1921 with the permanent rank of major general.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1= Smith, Alfred Emanuel |last= |first= |authorlink= |coauthors= |date=October 12, 1921 |title=The New Head of The Air Service |journal=[[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]] |volume=129 |issue= |pages=206, 208 |id= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sVroBrOJL64C&amp;pg=PA206 |accessdate=2009-07-30 |quote= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under Patrick's direction, the Air Service established experimental facilities at [[Wright Field]], [[Ohio]], and a large training facility at [[San Antonio, Texas]]. It was here in 1922, that he learned how to fly for the very first time in his life, receiving the [[U.S. Air Force Aeronautical Ratings|rating]] of Junior Airplane Pilot at the age of 59 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tate|1998|p=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998|ISBN= 1571970886|oclc=40298151|pages=294-295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At this time Patrick began having an increasingly difficult time managing his Assistant Chief of Air Service, [[Billy Mitchell]]. Patrick made it clear to Mitchell that although he would accept Mitchell's expertise as counsel, all decisions would be made by Patrick. Mitchell, however, known for his outspoken personality, began fervently pushing his personal agenda for air power independence by breaking chain of command and speaking directly with the press. When Mitchell soon got into a minor but embarrassing protocol rift with R/Adm. [[William A. Moffett]] at the start of the [[Washington Naval Conference|naval arms limitation conference]], Patrick used the opportunity to assign him to an inspection tour of Europe with [[Alfred V. Verville]] and Lt. [[Clayton Bissell]] that lasted the duration of the conference over the winter of 1921–22.&lt;ref&gt;Futrell (1985), p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924, Patrick hand-picked [[Henry "Hap" Arnold]], despite a mutual dislike, to head the Air Service's Information Division,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huston|2002|pp=13–14}}&lt;/ref&gt; working closely with [[Billy Mitchell]], Assistant Chief of Air Service.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coffey|1982|pp=112–115}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell began using Arnold's Information Division as an outlet to promote his personal opinions on the need for air power independence. When Mitchell was later [[court-martial]]ed for accusing Army and Navy leaders of an "almost treasonable administration of the national defense"&lt;ref&gt;This comment is quoted as "incompetency, criminal negligence, and almost treasonable administration by the War and Navy departments" from an interview given by Gen Mitchell in [[San Antonio, Texas]] and published in the New York Times (September 7, 1925, page 4) according to "The Court-Martial of Billy Mitchell (1925)" in ''Footnotes to American History'' by Harold S. Sharp, The Scarecrow Press, Inc., Metuchen, N.J., 1977, pp. 430–433.&lt;/ref&gt; for investing in battleships instead of aircraft carriers as he so wished, Arnold and other high-ranking officers on Patrick's staff, including [[Carl Spaatz]], and [[Ira Eaker]] were warned that they would jeopardize their careers should they vocally support Mitchell, but they testified on his behalf anyway. After Mitchell was convicted on December 17, 1925, Arnold and other officers continued to use the Information Division to mail pro-Mitchell information to airpower-friendly congressmen and Air Service reservists. In February 1926, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Dwight F. Davis]] ordered Patrick to find and discipline the culprits. Patrick was already aware of the activity and chose Arnold to set an example. He gave Arnold the choice of resignation or a general court-martial, but when Arnold chose the latter, Patrick decided to avoid another public fiasco and instead transferred him to Ft. Riley, far from the aviation mainstream, where he eventually took command of the [[16th Reconnaissance Squadron|16th Observation Squadron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Coffey|1982|pp=122–124}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Clay|2010|p=1384}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Creation of the Air Corps ===
[[File:Mmpatrick-time-cover-01.jpg|thumb|upright=1.0|General Patrick on the cover of the July 23, 1923 issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'']]
In early 1926, the Military Affairs Committee of the Congress reviewed bills set forth before it to create a more autonomous air power. Patrick, in his "Air Corps Act", proposed that the Air Service be made a semi-independent service within the War Department along the lines of the Marine Corps within the Department of the Navy, requesting a "five-year plan" for expansion and development. His proposal was met with criticism and the service that was created, though retaining the name of Air Corps, would not achieve the independence he envisioned until the creation of the [[United States Air Force]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;Tate (1998), pp. 45–47&lt;/ref&gt;

The Air Corps Act (44 ''Stat.'' 780) became law on 2 July 1926. In accordance with the Morrow Board's recommendations, the act created an additional [[United States Assistant Secretary of War|Assistant Secretary of War]] to "help foster military aeronautics", and established an air section in each division of the General Staff for a period of three years. Previous provisions of the National Defense Act of 1920 that all flying units be commanded only by rated personnel and that flight pay be awarded were continued. The Air Corps also retained the "[[Prop and Wings]]" as its branch insignia through its disestablishment in 1947. Patrick became Chief of the Air Corps and Brig. Gen. [[James E. Fechet]] continued as his first assistant chief.&lt;ref name=Maurer&gt;Maurer (1987)''Aviation in the U.S. Army, 1919–1939'' (Appendix 5) p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;

==Retirement and death==
Patrick retired from the Army on December 12, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998

Patrick died at [[Walter Reed General Hospital]] in [[Washington, D.C.]] on January 29, 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis, Jr.|first=Henry Blaine|title=Generals in Khaki|publisher=Pentland Press, Inc.|year= 1998|ISBN= 1571970886|oclc=40298151|pages=294-295 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]] on January 31, 1942.

As a founder of the [[cosmetics]] giant [[Max Factor|Max Factor &amp; Company]] he largely developed the modern cosmetics industry in the [[United States]] and popularised the term "[[make-up]]" in noun form based on the verb.

He is also known for doing makeovers for starlets and giving them their signature looks; his most iconic works include [[Jean Harlow]]'s platinum hair, [[Clara Bow]]'s bob, [[Lucille Ball]]'s false lashes and red curls, and [[Joan Crawford]]'s "Hunter's Bow", or overdrawn lips.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.revelist.com/makeup/overdrawn-lips/6928|title=This is the exact moment that overdrawn lips became a thing|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Factor, of [[History of the Jews in Poland|Polish-Jewish descent]], was born in [[Zduńska Wola]], [[Congress Poland]], to Abraham Faktorowicz (1850/52–before 1938) and Cecylia Wrocławska.&lt;ref&gt;Leszczyńska Joanna, Max Factor. Czarodziej gwiazd, [w:] "Nasza Historia" [wyd. łódzkie], styczeń 2014, s. 8–11.&lt;/ref&gt; His father, a hard-working grocer, rabbi, or textile mill worker (depending upon the source), could not afford a formal education for his four children.

By the age of eight years, Factor was working as an assistant to a [[dentist]] and [[pharmacist]].&lt;ref&gt;Basten, page 1.&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of nine, he was [[apprentice]]d to a wig maker and cosmetician in [[Łódź]], [[Poland]]. That experience enabled him to gain a position at Anton's of [[Berlin]], a leading hairstylist and cosmetics creator. By the age of fourteen, he was working at ''Korpo'', a [[Moscow]] wig maker and cosmetician to the Imperial Russian Grand Opera. He spent the years from eighteen to twenty-two undertaking his compulsory military service in the Imperial Russian Army, where he served in the Hospital Corps.

Upon his discharge, he opened his own shop in the town of [[Ryazan]], selling hand-made [[Rouge (cosmetics)|rouge]]s, creams, [[fragrance]]s, and [[Wig (hair)|wigs]]. He became well-known when a traveling theatrical troupe wore Factor's cosmetics to perform for Russian nobility. The Russian nobility appointed Factor the official cosmetics expert for the royal family and the [[Bolshoi Theatre|Imperial Russian Grand Opera]], an honor which led to him being closely monitored.  He married Esther Rosa (whom he called Lizzie) and by early 1904 they had produced three children, Freda, Cecilia and Davis.&lt;ref&gt;Basten, page 6.&lt;/ref&gt; By 1904 concerned about the increasing anti-Jewish persecution developing in Congress Poland, he and his wife decided to follow his brother Nathan and uncle Fischel to America. Worried that he would not be released from his royal service, he arranged with the assistance of a friend to take a rest cure at [[Karlovy Vary]]. After meeting up with his family they traveled in the [[Steerage (deck)|steerage]] class on board the S.S. ''Moltke III'' and were processed at [[Ellis Island]] on February 25, 1904; he had $400 in his possession.&lt;ref&gt;Basten, page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in the United States==
in 1904 Factor made a new start in [[St. Louis]], [[Missouri]]. The Factor family never returned to Europe.

He sold his rouges and creams at the [[Louisiana Purchase Exposition|1904 World's Fair]], operating under the newly re-spelled name ''Max Factor''. Unfortunately, his partner in the venture stole all of his stock and the profits.  With assistance from his brother and uncle, Factor recovered and opened a barber's shop. In August 1904 Max and his wife had their fourth child, Francis "Frank" Factor.  However, on 17 March 1906, his wife collapsed and died from a brain hemorrhage. Anxious to provide a mother for his four children, he married Huma "Helen" Sradkowska on 15 August 1906.&lt;ref&gt;Basten, page 18&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the birth of Louis on August 29, 1907, the marriage was short-lived and ended in a prolonged court battle, as result of which Factor obtained custody of all of his children.

==Creation of an empire==
On January 21, 1908, Factor married Jennie Cook  (March 1, 1886&amp;nbsp;– December 3, 1949), a neighbor.

Later that year Factor moved his family to [[Los Angeles]], [[California]], seeing an opportunity to provide made-to-order wigs and theatrical make-up to the growing film industry.  Initially he established a shop on South Central Avenue, advertising the business as "Max Factor's Antiseptic Hair Store". Founding Max Factor &amp; Company in 1909, he soon became the West Coast distributor of Leichner and Minor, two leading theatrical make-up manufacturers. Greasepaint in stick form, although the accepted make-up for use on the stage, could not be applied thinly enough, nor were the colors appropriate, to work satisfactorily on the screen during the early years of movie-making.

Factor began experimenting with various compounds in an effort to develop a suitable make-up for the new film medium.  By 1914 he had perfected the first cosmetic specifically created for motion picture use—a thinner greasepaint in cream form, packaged in a jar, and created in 12 precisely-graduated shades. Unlike theatrical cosmetics, it would not crack or cake.

With this major achievement to his credit, Max Factor became the authority on cosmetics for film making. Soon, movie stars were eager to sample the "flexible greasepaint", while [[movie producer]]s sought Factor's human hair wigs. He allowed the wigs to be rented to the producers of old [[Westerns]], on the condition that his sons were given parts. The boys would watch the expensive wigs.

Factor marketed a range of cosmetics to the public during the 1920s, insisting that every girl could look like a movie star by using [[Max Factor]] cosmetics.

In the early years of the business Factor personally applied his products to actors and actresses. He developed a reputation for being able to customize makeup to present actors and actresses in the best possible light on screen.  Among his most notable clients were [[Ben Turpin]], [[Gloria Swanson]], [[Mary Pickford]], [[Pola Negri]], [[Jean Harlow]], [[Claudette Colbert]], [[Bette Davis]], [[Norma Shearer]], [[Joan Crawford]], and [[Judy Garland]]. As a result, virtually all of the major movie actresses were regular customers of the Max Factor [[beauty salon]], located near [[Hollywood Boulevard]]. Max Factor's name appeared on many movie credits, and Factor appeared in some cameos.

He became a United States citizen in 1916.

In 1920 Max Factor gave in to Frank Factor's suggestion and officially began referring to his products as "make-up".  Up until then, the term "cosmetics" had been used: The term "make-up" was considered to be used only by people in the theatre or of dubious reputation, not something to be used in polite society.

==Death==
In 1938 Factor was traveling in Europe on business with his son Davis when during a stopover in Paris he received a note demanding money in exchange for his life.  An attempt was made by the police using a decoy to capture the extortionist but no one turned up at the agreed drop-off point to collect the money.  Factor was so shaken by the threat that he returned at the behest of a local doctor to America, where upon arrival he took to his bed.  Factor died at the age of 65 in Beverly Hills, California, in August, and was originally interred in the Beth Olem mausoleum at the [[Hollywood Forever Cemetery|Hollywood Cemetery]] in Los Angeles. His remains were moved many years later to [[Hillside Memorial Park Cemetery]] in [[Culver City, California|Culver City]], California.&lt;ref&gt;Basten, page 122&lt;/ref&gt;

==Honors and tributes==
The Academy of Motion Picture, Arts, and Sciences presented Max Factor with an honorary Academy Award in 1929 for his contributions to the film industry.  Additionally, Max Factor is honored with a [[star]] on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]] (at 6922 Hollywood Boulevard).  Max Factor is mentioned in the classic song, "Hooray For Hollywood." In a reference to his creation of [[Clara Bow]]'s heart-shaped lips, the song states, ''"To be an actor / See Mr. Factor / He'll make your pucker look good!"''

'''Muhammed Wattad''' ({{lang-ar|محمد وتد}}, {{lang-he|מוחמד ותד}}; 1 June 1937 – 24 September 1994) was an [[Israeli Arab]] journalist, writer and politician who served as a member of the [[Knesset]] between 1981 and 1988.

==Biography==
Born in [[Jatt, Israel|Jatt]] during the [[Mandatory Palestine|Mandate era]], Wattad was a member of the Israeli Communist Youth and [[Hashomer Hatzair]]. He attended [[Tel Aviv University]], where he took Asian and African Studies.

A member of [[Mapam]], he edited the Arabic-language version of the party's newspaper, ''[[Al HaMishmar]]''. In [[Israeli legislative election, 1981|1981]] he was elected to the Knesset on the [[Alignment (political party)|Alignment]] list (an alliance of Mapam and the [[Israeli Labor Party|Labor Party]]). He was re-elected in [[Israeli legislative election, 1984|1984]], shortly after which Mapam left the Alignment. On 12 July 1988 he left Mapam to join Hadash,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.knesset.gov.il/faction/eng/FactionHistoryAll_eng.asp Mergers and Splits amongst Parliamentary Groups] Knesset website&lt;/ref&gt; due to disappointment with Mapam's policy towards the [[First Intifada]].

He lost his seat in the [[Israeli legislative election, 1988|1988 elections]]. After leaving politics, he managed and edited the ''[[Kul al-Arab]]'' newspaper, and later ran a public relations firm.

He died in 1994 following a traffic collision.

'''Raffles Place''' is the centre of the Financial District of [[Singapore]] and is located south of the [[River|mouth]] of the [[Singapore River]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.roughguides.com/destinations/asia/singapore/financial-district/ |title= The Financial District |work=Rough Guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was first planned and developed in the 1820s as '''Commercial Square''' to serve as the hub of the commercial zone of Singapore in [[Jackson Plan|Raffles Town Plan]]. It was renamed Raffles Place in 1858 and is now the site of a number of major banks. It is located in the [[Downtown Core]] within the [[Central Area, Singapore|Central Area]], and features some of the tallest buildings and landmarks of the country.

==History==
[[File:Raffles Place.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Centre square of Raffles Place]]

===Beginning===
The founder of modern Singapore, [[Sir Stamford Raffles]], intended Singapore to become a "great commercial [[Marketplace|emporium]]". As part of his plan, he gave instructions in 1822 that a commercial area be created on the southwest side of the Singapore River.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ananecdotalhist00buckgoog#page/n114/mode/2up |title=An anecdotal history of old times in Singapore |author=Charles Burton Buckley |pages=81–86 |date=1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Garrison Engineer [[Lieutenant]] R.N. [[Philip Jackson (surveyor)|Philip Jackson]], was tasked with drawing up a [[Jackson Plan|Town Plan]] based on Raffles' instructions.  This commercial area was centered on Commercial Square, and was developed from 1823 to 1824.

A [[hill]] originally stood at the area between Commercial Square and Battery Road.&lt;ref name="infopedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_864_2004-12-30.html |title=Raffles Place |work=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board |first=Vernon |last=Cornelius}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Under Raffles' supervision, the hill was leveled, the soil of which was then used to reclaim the marshy southern bank of the Singapore River to form the [[Boat Quay]] and Circular Road area.  Commercial Square was created as an open space 200 yards long by 50 yards wide, with a small garden in the middle.&lt;ref name="anecdotal"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/ananecdotalhist00buckgoog#page/n120/mode/2up |title=An anecdotal history of old times in Singapore |author=Charles Burton Buckley |pages=88–89 |date=1902}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lots of land in the area around the square were sold in auction at $1,200 and $1,500 apiece.&lt;ref name="anecdotal"/&gt; Commercial enterprises then became established on the area; two- and four-[[storey]] buildings were built around the square, housing [[mercantile]] offices, [[bank]]s and [[Trader (finance)|trading]] companies.&lt;ref name="100 historic places"/&gt;

On 8 March 1858, Commercial Square was renamed Raffles Place in Raffles' honour.&lt;ref name="infopedia"/&gt; On the south side of the square were many [[warehouse|godowns]] with [[jetties]] that allowed [[cargo]] to be loaded and unloaded directly from [[boat]]s as they were then located at the edge of the sea. From 1858 to 1864, the land on the south side of Raffles Place from [[Johnston's Pier]] to [[Telok Ayer Market]] was reclaimed, which became [[Collyer Quay]], named after the Chief Engineer George Collyer who initiated its construction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_218_2005-01-19.html |title=Collyer Quay | first=Vernon |last=Cornelius |work=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board }}&lt;/ref&gt; The expansion freed up a larger area designated for commerce, and attracted more businesses such as [[retail]] stores and banks.&lt;ref name="100 historic places"&gt;{{cite book |work=[[National Heritage Board (Singapore)|National Heritage Board]]|date=2002|title=Singapore's 100 Historic Places|publisher= Archipelago Press|isbn= 981-4068-23-3 |pages=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Commerce and retail ===
[[File:KITLV - 79891 - Kleingrothe, C.J. - Medan - Raffles Place, Singapore - circa 1910.tif|thumb|upright=1.2|Raffles Place {{circa}}1910]]
The area become the location for well-known retail stores in the 19th century. A retail store that would become Singapore's oldest [[department store]] [[John Little (department store)|John Little]] was established on 30 August 1842 on Commercial Square.&lt;ref name="st"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/john-little-to-close-final-outlet-at-plaza-singapura-174-years-of-history-at-a-glance |title=John Little to close final outlet at Plaza Singapura: 174 years of history at a glance |first=Annabeth|last= Leow |work=The Straits Times |date=7 November 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Robinson &amp; Co.|Robinsons]], another of the early department stores, was first established on Raffles Place in 1858 as a "family warehouse". Robinson's was then relocated elsewhere a few times before returning to Raffles Place in 1891.&lt;ref name="robinsons"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_561_2005-01-25.html |title=Robinsons Department Store |work=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whiteaway Laidlaw was first established on D'Almeida Street in 1900 before moving to [[Stamford House, Singapore|Stamford House]], then to Battery Road in 1910.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1122_2006-06-15.html |title=Whiteaway Laidlaw |author=Joshua Chia Yeong Jia |work=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Alkaff Arcade, Singapore's first indoor shopping arcade that stretched from the waterfront of [[Collyer Quay]] to Raffles Place, was built in 1909.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1067_2006-06-15.html |title=The (Alkaff) Arcade |work=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board |author=Marsita Omar}}&lt;/ref&gt; A Chinese store, the Oriental Emporium, was opened opposite Robinsons in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://remembersingapore.org/2012/04/09/the-emporium-legend-lim-tow-yong/ |title=The Emporium Legend Lim Tow Yong (1925-2012)|date=9 April 2012 |work=Remember Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All three are 280 metres in height.]]
The earliest banks to operate in Commercial Square were the [[Oriental Bank Corporation|Oriental Bank]], the Chartered [[Mercantile Bank of India, London and China]] (later absorbed into [[HSBC]]), the [[Chartered Bank of India, Australia and China]] (which later became the [[Standard Chartered]]), and the [[Asiatic Banking Corporation]].&lt;ref name="infopedia"/&gt; At the turn of the 20th century, the banking industry in Singapore took off.  Home-grown banks came into play, competing against bigger banks with lower [[interest rate]]s and a [[cultural]] affinity with their customers. From the 1950s, banking in Singapore entered a new league, with [[Bank of America]] establishing itself here in 1955 at 31 Raffles Place, and [[Bank of China]] at the adjacent [[Battery Road]].&lt;ref name="100 historic places"/&gt;

During [[World War II]], Raffles Place was among the places hit by bombs when seventeen Japanese bombers conducted the [[Bombing of Singapore (8 December 1941)|first air raid on Singapore]] on 8 December 1941, during the [[Battle of Malaya]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_7_2005-01-25.html |title=First air raid on Singapore | first=Alvin |last=Chua|work=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Japanese occupation of Singapore]] temporarily halted the near-continuous commercial development of Raffles Place.&lt;ref name="100 historic places"/&gt;

===Financial hub===

In the 1960s and 1970s, retailers began to moved away from Raffles Place area to locations such as High Street, [[North Bridge Road]] and [[Orchard Road]], and were replaced by [[finance]] houses and major banks. The Whiteaway Laidlaw department store building on Battery Road was taken over by [[Maybank|Malayan Bank]] in 1962, and then demolished to make way for the [[Maybank Tower (Singapore)|Maybank Tower]] in 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_1122_2006-06-15.html|title=Whiteaway Laidlaw |author=Joshua Chia Yeong Jia |work=Singapore Infopedia |publisher=National Library Board }}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinsons moved to Orchard Road after its landmark building was destroyed in one of the worst fires in Singapore's history in 1972, and its neighbour [[Overseas Union Bank]] expanded into the site with the construction of a new tower in 1986.&lt;ref name="robinsons"/&gt;&lt;ref name="infopedia"/&gt; The John Little's Building was sold in 1973 and demolished.&lt;ref name="st"/&gt;

The first underground car park in Singapore was constructed in 1965 under Raffles Place, but was replaced in the 1980s by the [[Raffles Place MRT Station]], which opened in December 1987.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://remembersingapore.org/2014/07/28/old-and-new-raffles-place/ |title=Raffles Place, 50 Years of Transformation |date= 28 July 2014 |work=Remember Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://remembersingapore.org/2013/07/23/singapore-mrt-history/ |title= A Journey into Singapore MRT’s Past |date= 23 July 2013 |work=Remember Singapore}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its entrance features detailings of the facade of 1911 of the old John Little building.&lt;ref name="infopedia"/&gt;

Raffles Place is now dominated by [[Skyscraper]]s, some of the [[List of tallest buildings in Singapore|tallest buildings in Singapore]], which are the locations of flagship banks. [[United Overseas Bank]] tower was completed in 1974 on the old Bonham Building site, later renovated and expanded into [[UOB Plaza]]. Other towers such as [[Singapore Land Tower]], [[Clifford Centre]], Ocean Building, [[OUB Centre]],  and [[Republic Plaza, Singapore|Republic Plaza]] have also replaced the older buildings.&lt;ref name="100 historic places"/&gt;  The three tallest buildings in Singapore were located on Raffles Place the until the construction of [[Tanjong Pagar Centre]] in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.straitstimes.com/singapore/tanjong-pagar-centre-set-to-be-tallest-building-at-290m |title=Tanjong Pagar Centre set to be tallest building at 290m |date=May 3, 2013 |author=Melissa Tan |work=The Straits Times }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Notable buildings==
Several key buildings are located in Raffles Place, including [[UOB Plaza]], [[One Raffles Place]], [[Republic Plaza, Singapore|Republic Plaza]],  and [[OCBC Centre]]. [[The Fullerton Hotel Singapore]], a hotel at the renovated old General Post Office building, the famous tourist icon the [[Merlion]], and an ultra modern [[durian]] shaped Art Centre [[Esplanade - Theatres on the Bay|Esplanade Theatre]] are located nearby. The [[stock exchange]] of Singapore - the [[Singapore Exchange]] - is also located in the vicinity. Several key administrative buildings in Singapore, such as the [[Parliament House, Singapore|Parliament House]], the [[Supreme Court of Singapore|Supreme Court]] and [[City Hall, Singapore|City Hall]] are located north across the river, but are technically not part of Raffles Place.

==Transportation==
The underground [[Mass Rapid Transit (Singapore)|Mass Rapid Transit]] station, the [[Raffles Place MRT Station]], lies directly underneath the centre of Raffles Place, and is one of the primary public transport links for Raffles Place into [[Transport in Singapore|Singapore's transport system]]. [[Bus]] services also run along Raffles Place.

&lt;!--Yield Management is focused exclusively on managing inventory (e.g., opening/closing rooms), whereas revenue management is focused entirely on revenue, whether revenue is generated using yield management, pricing, promotions, etc.--&gt;
'''Revenue management''' is the application of disciplined [[analytics]] that predict [[consumer behaviour]] at the micro-market levels and optimize product availability and price to maximize [[revenue]] growth. The primary aim of revenue management is selling the right product to the right customer at the right time for the right price and with the right pack. The essence of this discipline is in understanding customers' perception of product value and accurately aligning product prices, placement and availability with each customer segment.&lt;ref name="CrossR"&gt;Cross, R. (1997) Revenue Management: Hard-Core Tactics for Market Domination. New York, NY: Broadway Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Businesses face important decisions regarding what to sell, when to sell, to whom to sell, and for how much. Revenue management uses data-driven tactics and [[strategy]] to answer these questions in order to increase revenue.&lt;ref name="vanRyzinRM"&gt;Talluri, K., and van Ryzin, G. (1999) Revenue Management: Research Overview and Prospects. Transportation Science 33:233-256.&lt;/ref&gt; The discipline of revenue management combines data mining and operations research with strategy, understanding of customer behavior, and partnering with the sales force. Today, the revenue management practitioner must be analytical and detail oriented, yet capable of thinking strategically and managing the relationship with sales.&lt;ref&gt;Chase, Nicole. 2007. Revenue management redefined. Hotels, February 1, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the emergence of revenue management, [[BOAC]] (now [[British Airways]]) experimented with differentiated fare products by offering capacity controlled "Earlybird" discounts to stimulate [[demand]] for seats that would otherwise fly empty.&lt;ref name="McGillVanRyzin"&gt;McGill, J. and van Ryzin, G. (1999) Revenue management: research overview and prospects. Transportation Science 33: 233–256.&lt;/ref&gt; Taking it a step further, [[Robert Crandall]], former [[Chairman]] and [[CEO]] of [[American Airlines]], pioneered a practice he called [[yield management]], which focused primarily on maximizing revenue through analytics-based [[inventory control]]. Under Crandall's leadership, American continued to invest in yield management's forecasting, inventory control and overbooking capabilities. By the early 1980s, the combination of a mild recession and new competition spawned by [[airline deregulation act]] (1978) posed an additional threat. Low-cost, low-fare airlines like [[People Express]] were growing rapidly because of their ability to charge even less than American's Super Saver fares. After investing millions in the next generation capability which they would call DINAMO (Dynamic Inventory Optimization and Maintenance Optimizer), American announced Ultimate Super Saver Fares in 1985 that were priced lower than the PeoplExpress. These fares were non-refundable in addition to being advance-purchase restricted and capacity controlled. This yield management system targeted those [[discounts]] to only those situations where they had a surplus of empty seats. The system and analysts engaged in continual re-evaluation of the placement of the discounts to maximize their use. Over the next year, American's revenue increased 14.5% and its profits were up 47.8%.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt;

Other industries took note of American's success and implemented similar systems. Robert Crandall discussed his success with yield management with [[J. W. "Bill" Marriott, Jr.]], CEO of [[Marriott International]]. Marriott International had many of the same issues that airlines did: perishable inventory, customers booking in advance, lower cost competition and wide swings with regard to balancing supply and demand. Since "yield" was an airline term and did not necessarily pertain to hotels, Marriott International and others began calling the practice Revenue Management.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt; The company created a Revenue Management organization and invested in automated Revenue Management systems that would provide daily forecasts of demand and make inventory recommendations for each of its 160,000 rooms at its Marriott, [[Courtyard Marriott]] and [[Residence Inn]] brands.&lt;ref name="MarriottCross"&gt;Marriott, Jr., J. and Cross, R. (2000) Room at the revenue inn. In Book of Management Wisdom: Classic Writings by Legendary Managers, ed., Peter Krass, 199-208, New York, NY: Wiley.&lt;/ref&gt; They also created "fenced rate" logic similar to airlines, which would allow them to offer targeted discounts to price sensitive market segments based on demand.&lt;ref&gt;Hanks, R., Cross, R. and Noland, R. (1992) Discounting in the hotel industry: a new approach. Cornell Hotel and Restaurant Administration Quarterly 33(1): 15–23.&lt;/ref&gt; To address the additional complexity created by variable lengths-of-stay, Marriott's Demand Forecast System (DFS) was built to forecast guest booking patterns and optimize room availability by price and length of stay. By the mid-1990s, Marriott's successful execution of revenue management was adding between $150 million and $200 million in annual revenue.&lt;ref name="MarriottCross"/&gt;

A natural extension of hotel revenue management was to rental car firms, which experienced similar issues of discount availability and duration control. In 1994, revenue management saved [[National Car Rental]] from [[bankruptcy]]. Their revival from near collapse to making profits served as an indicator of revenue management's potential.&lt;ref&gt;Geraghty, M. and Johnson, E. (1997) Revenue management saves national car rental. Interfaces 27(1): 107–127.&lt;/ref&gt;

Up to this point, revenue management had focused on driving revenue from Business to Consumer ([[B2C]]) relationships. In the early 1990s UPS developed revenue management further by revitalizing their Business to Business ([[Business-to-business|B2B]]) pricing strategy.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, R., Higbie, J. and Cross, Z. (2010) Milestones in the Application of Analytical Pricing and Revenue Management. Journal of Revenue and Pricing Management&lt;/ref&gt; Faced with the need for volume growth in a competitive market, UPS began building a pricing organization that focused on discounting. Prices began to erode rapidly, however, as they began offering greater discounts to win business. The executive team at UPS prioritized specific targeting of their discounts but could not strictly follow the example set by airlines and hotels. Rather than optimizing the revenue for a discrete event such as the purchase of an [[airline seat]] or a hotel room, UPS was negotiating annual rates for large-volume customers using a multitude of services over the course of a year. To alleviate the discounting issue, they formulated the problem as a customized bid-response model, which used historical data to predict the probability of winning at different price points. They called the system Target Pricing. With this system, they were able to [[forecasting|forecast]] the outcomes of any contractual bid at various net prices and identify where they could command a price premium over competitors and where deeper discounts were required to land deals. In the first year of this revenue management system, UPS reported increased profits of over $100 million.&lt;ref&gt;Agrawal, V. and Ferguson, M. (2007) Optimal customized pricing in competitive settings. Journal of Revenue and Pricing Management 6: 212-228.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of maximizing revenue on negotiated deals found its way back to the [[hospitality]] industry. Marriott's original application of revenue management was limited to individual bookings, not groups or other negotiated deals. In 2007, Marriott introduced a "Group Price Optimizer" that used a competitive bid-response model to predict the probability of winning at any price point, thus providing accurate price guidance to the sales force. The initial system generated an incremental $46 million in profit. This led to an Honorable Mention for the [[Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Hormby, S., Morrison, J., Prashant, D, Meyers, M. and Tensa, T. (2010) Marriott International increases revenue by implementing a group pricing optimizer. Interfaces 40(1): 47-57.&lt;/ref&gt;
 
By the early 1990s revenue management also began to influence television ad sales. Companies like [[Canadian Broadcast Corporation]], [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]],&lt;ref&gt;Mandese, J. (1998). Taking hint from travel world, ABC goes up against ritual: Aeronomics system expected to help troubled net set prices to fill seats. Advertising Age, 11 May.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[NBC]]&lt;ref&gt;Bollapragada, S., Cheng, H., Phillips, M. and Garbiras. M. (2002) NBC's optimization systems increase revenues and productivity. Interfaces 32(1): 47-60.&lt;/ref&gt; developed systems that automated the placement of ads in proposals based on total forecasted demand and forecasted ratings by program. Today, many television networks around the globe have revenue management systems.&lt;ref&gt;Bell, P. (2005) Revenue Management. Plenary presentation at Vision 2020, Ahmedabad, India. 8 January. Retrieved September 21, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

Revenue management to this point had been utilized in the pricing of perishable products. In the 1990s, however, the [[Ford Motor Company]] began adopting revenue management to maximize [[Profit (economics)|profitability]] of its vehicles by segmenting customers into micro-markets and creating a differentiated and targeted price structure.&lt;ref&gt;Hansen, L. (2005) Follow the money: high margin growth focused on the customer. Presentation to Revenue Management &amp; Price Optimization Conference; 21 April, Atlanta, GA.&lt;/ref&gt; Pricing for vehicles and options packages had been set based upon annual volume estimates and profitability projections. The company found that certain products were overpriced and some were underpriced.&lt;ref&gt;Coy, P. (2000) The power of smart pricing, BusinessWeek, 10 April pp.160-163.&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the range of customer preferences across a product line and geographical market, Ford leadership created a Revenue management organization to measure the price-responsiveness of different customer segments for each [[incentive]] type and to develop an approach that would target the optimal incentive by product and region. By the end of the decade, Ford estimated that roughly $3 billion in additional profits came from revenue management initiatives.&lt;ref&gt;Leibs, S., (2000), [http://www.cfo.com/printable/article.cfm/2990968 Ford heeds the profits], CFO Magazine, August 2000&lt;/ref&gt;

The public success of Pricing and Revenue Management at Ford solidified the ability of the discipline to address the revenue generation issues of virtually any company. Many auto manufacturers have adopted the practice for both vehicle sales and the sale of parts. [[Retailers]] have leveraged the concepts pioneered at Ford to create more dynamic, targeted pricing in the form of discounts and promotions to more accurately match supply with demand. [[Promotion (marketing)|Promotion]]s planning and [[optimization]] assisted retailers with the timing and prediction of the incremental lift of a promotion for targeted products and customer sets. Companies have rapidly adopted [[price markdown]] optimization to maximize revenue from end-of-season or end-of-life items. Furthermore, strategies driving promotion roll-offs and discount expirations have allowed companies to increase revenue from newly acquired customers.&lt;ref name="Phillips"&gt;Phillips, R. (2005) Pricing and Revenue Optimization, Stanford, CA: Stanford Business Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2000, virtually all major [[airlines]], [[hotel]] firms, cruise lines and rental car firms had implemented revenue management systems to predict customer demand and optimize available price. These revenue management systems had limited "optimize" to imply managing the availability of pre-defined prices in pre-established price categories. The objective function was to select the best blends of predicted demand given existing prices. The sophisticated technology and optimization [[algorithms]] had been focused on selling the right amount of inventory at a given price, not on the price itself. Realizing that controlling inventory was no longer sufficient, [[InterContinental Hotels Group]] (IHG) launched an initiative to better understand the [[price sensitivity]] of customer demand. IHG determined that calculating [[price elasticity]] at very granular levels to a high degree of accuracy still was not enough. Rate transparency had elevated the importance of incorporating market positioning against substitutable alternatives. IHG recognized that when a competitor changes its rate, the consumer's perception of IHG's rate also changes.&lt;ref&gt;Cross, R., Higbie, J. and Cross, D. (2009) Revenue management's renaissance: a rebirth of the art and science of profitable revenue generation. Cornell Hospitality Quarterly 50: 56-81.&lt;/ref&gt; Working with third party competitive data, the IHG team was able to analyze historical price, volume and share data to accurately measure price elasticity in every local market for multiple lengths of stay. These elements were incorporated into a system that also measured differences in customer elasticity based upon how far in advance the booking is being made relative to the arrival date. The incremental revenue from the system was significant as this new Price Optimization capability increased Revenue per Available Room ([[RevPAR]]) by 2.7%.&lt;ref&gt;InterContinental Hotels Group (2009) Annual Review and Summary Financial Statement, accessed 22 September 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; IHG and [[Revenue Analytics]], a pricing and revenue management consulting firm, were selected as finalists for the [[Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences]] for their joint effort in implementing Price Optimization at IHG.&lt;ref&gt;Eister, C., Higbie, J., Koushik, D. (2012) Retail Price Optimization at InterContinental Hotels Group. Informs, Vol. 42, No. 1, pp. 45-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, Holiday Retirement and Prorize LLC were awarded with the Franz Edelman Award for Achievement in Operations Research and the Management Sciences (&lt;ref&gt;https://www.informs.org/Recognizing-Excellence/Award-Recipients/Holiday-Retirement-Prorize &lt;/ref&gt;) for their use of operations research (O.R.) to improve the pricing model for more than 300 senior living communities. Holiday Retirement partnered with Prorize LLC, an Atlanta-based revenue management firm that leveraged O.R. to develop its Senior Living Rent Optimizer. The revenue management system developed by Prorize enabled a consistent and proactive pricing process across Holiday, while simultaneously providing optimal pricing recommendations for each unit in every one of their communities.  As a result of their joint efforts, they were able to consistently raise revenues by over 10%. &lt;ref&gt;https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/10.1287/inte.2017.0927 &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mcknightsseniorliving.com/home/news/how-holiday-increased-revenue-from-new-leases-by-10/ &lt;/ref&gt;

===Revenue Management Society ("RMS")===
The Revenue Management Society is the industry body representing companies and practitioners working in this area. The Society traces its roots back to 2002 when Steve Marchant gathered a group of clients and colleagues to discuss revenue management issues of common interest. Initially the club was financed by Consultecom but in 2007 became a Society fully funded by the membership. Membership initially comprised companies in the travel and leisure sector. There are now over 60 corporate members from across Europe and from many industries. The Society's Mission Statement is "To define and promote best practice in the use of revenue and yield management techniques, through discussion and communication between the key users of these techniques within the Travel, Transportation and Leisure industries." To this end the Society organises member conferences, newsletters and supports University research projects

==Levers==
Whereas yield management involves specific actions to generate yield through perishable inventory management, revenue management encompasses a wide range of opportunities to increase revenue. A company can utilize these different categories like a series of levers in the sense that all are usually available, but only one or two may drive revenue in a given situation. The primary levers are:

===Pricing===
This category of revenue management involves redefining pricing strategy and developing disciplined pricing tactics. The key objective of a pricing strategy is anticipating the value created for customers and then setting specific prices to capture that value. A company may decide to price against their competitors or even their own products, but the most value comes from pricing strategies that closely follow market conditions and demand, especially at a segment level. Once a pricing strategy dictates what a company wants to do, pricing tactics determine how a company actually captures the value. Tactics involve creating pricing tools that change dynamically, in order to react to changes and continually capture value and gain revenue. Price Optimization, for example, involves constantly optimizing multiple variables such as price sensitivity, price ratios, and inventory to maximize revenues. A successful pricing strategy, supported by analytically-based pricing tactics, can drastically improve a firm's profitability.&lt;ref&gt;Hogan, J. and Nagel, T. The Strategy and Tactics of Pricing: A Guide to Growing More Profitably.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inventory===
When focused on controlling inventory, revenue management is mainly concerned with how best to price or allocate capacity. First, a company can discount products in order to increase volume. By lowering prices on products, a company can overcome weak demand and gain market share, which ultimately increases revenue. On the other hand, in situations where demand is strong for a product but the threat of cancellations looms (e.g. hotel rooms or airline seats), firms often overbook in order to maximize revenue from full capacity. [[Overbooking]]'s focus is increasing the total volume of sales in the presence of cancellations rather than optimizing customer mix.&lt;ref name="McGillVanRyzin"/&gt;

===Marketing===
Price promotion allow companies to sell higher volumes by temporarily decreasing the price of their products. Revenue management techniques measure customer responsiveness to promotions in order to strike a balance between volume growth and profitability. An effective promotion helps maximize revenue when there is uncertainty about the distribution of customer willingness to pay. When a company's products are sold in the form of long-term commitments, such as [[internet]] or [[Local telephone service|telephone service]], promotions help attract customers who will then commit to [[contracts]] and produce revenue over a long time horizon. When this occurs, companies must also strategize their promotion roll-off policies; they must decide when to begin increasing the contract fees and by what magnitude to raise the fees in order to avoid losing customers. Revenue management optimization proves useful in balancing promotion roll-off variables in order to maximize revenue while minimizing [[Product churning|churn]].&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

===Channels===
Revenue management through channels involves strategically driving revenue through different [[distribution channel]]s. Different channels may represent customers with different price sensitivities. For example, customers who shop online are usually more price sensitive than customers who shop in a physical store. Different channels often have different costs and [[Gross margin|margins]] associated with those channels. When faced with multiple channels to retailers and distributors, revenue management techniques can calculate appropriate levels of discounts for companies to offer distributors through opaque channels to push more products without losing integrity with respect to public perception of quality.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

Since the advent of the Internet the distribution network and control has become a major concern for service providers. When the producer collaborates with a powerful provider, sacrifices may be necessary, particularly concerning the selling price/commission rate, in exchange for the capacity to reach a certain clientele and sales volumes &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Revenue Management for Hospitality and Tourism|last=Legoherel|first=Patick|publisher=Goodfelow Publishers Ltd|year=|isbn=978-1-908999-48-1|location=Oxford, UK|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==

===Data collection===
The revenue management process begins with [[data collection]]. Relevant data is paramount to a revenue management system's capability to provide accurate, actionable information. A system must collect and store historical data for inventory, prices, demand, and other causal factors. Any data that reflects the details of products offered, their prices, competition, and customer behavior must be collected, stored, and analyzed. In some markets, specialized data collection methods have rapidly emerged to service their relevant sector, and sometimes have even become a norm. In the [[European Union]] for example, the [[European Commission]] makes sure businesses and governments stick to EU rules on fair competition, while still leaving space for innovation, unified standards, and the development of small businesses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://europa.eu/pol/comp/index_en.htm European Union Competition] Retrieved on 14 December 2012, Europa.eu, Competition&lt;/ref&gt; To support this, third party sources are utilized to collect data and make only averages available for commercial purposes, such as is the case with the hotel sector – in Europe &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkg-group.com/Portals/2/FILES/201210_15451/MKG-HIT-Report-EU-102012.pdf Europe HIT Report] Retrieved on October 2012, [[MKG Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; and the Middle East &amp; North Africa region,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mkg-group.com/Portals/2/FILES/201210_15451/MKG-HIT-Report-ME-102012.pdf MEA HIT Report] Retrieved on October 2012, [[MKG Group]]&lt;/ref&gt; where key operating indicators are monitored, such as Occupancy Rate (OR), Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR). Data is supplied directly by hotel chains and groups (as well as independent properties) and benchmark averages are produced by direct market (competitive set) or wider macro market. This data is also utilized for financial reporting, forecasting trends and development purposes. Information about customer behavior is a valuable asset that can reveal consumer behavioral patterns, the impact of competitors' actions, and other important market information. This information is crucial to starting the revenue management process.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt;

===Segmentation===
After collecting the relevant data, [[market segmentation]] is the key to market-based pricing and revenue maximization. Airlines, for example, employed this tactic in differentiating between price-sensitive leisure customers and price-insensitive business customers. Leisure customers tend to book earlier and are flexible about when they fly and are willing to sit in coach seats to save more money for their destination, whereas business customers tend to book closer to departure and are typically less price sensitive.  Success hinges on the ability to segment customers into similar groups based on a calculation of price responsiveness of customers to certain products based upon the circumstances of time and place. Revenue management strives to determine the value of a product to a very narrow micro-market at a specific moment in time and then chart customer behavior at the margin to determine the maximum obtainable revenue from those micro-markets.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt; Micro-markets can be derived qualitatively by conducting a dimensional analysis. Business customers and leisure customers are two segments, but business customers could be further segmented by the time they fly (those who book late and fly in the morning etc.). Useful tools such as [[Cluster Analysis]] allow Revenue Managers to create a set of data-driven partitioning techniques that gather interpretable groups of objects together for consideration. Market segmentation based upon customer behavior is essential to the next step, which is forecasting demand associated with the clustered segments. 

===Forecasting===
Revenue management requires forecasting various elements such as demand, inventory availability, [[market share]], and total [[Market (economics)|market]]. Its performance depends critically on the quality of these forecasts. Forecasting is a critical task of revenue management and takes much time to develop, maintain, and implement. Quantity-based forecasts, which use [[time-series]] models, booking curves, cancellation curves, etc., project future quantities of demand, such as reservations or products bought. Price-based forecasts seek to forecast demand as a function of marketing variables, such as price or promotion. These involve building specialized forecasts such as market response models or [[cross price elasticity]] of demand estimates to predict customer behavior at certain price points.&lt;ref name="McGillVanRyzin"/&gt; By combining these forecasts with calculated price sensitivities and price ratios, a revenue management system can then quantify these benefits and develop price optimization strategies to maximize revenue.

===Optimization===
While forecasting suggests what customers are likely to do, optimization suggests how a firm should respond. Often considered the pinnacle of the revenue management process, optimization is about evaluating multiple options on how to sell your product and to whom to sell your product.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt; Optimization involves solving two important problems in order to achieve the highest possible revenue. The first is determining which objective function to optimize. A business must decide between optimizing prices, total sales, [[contribution margin]]s, or even [[customer lifetime value]]s. Secondly, the business must decide which optimization technique to utilize. For example, many firms utilize [[linear programming]], a complex technique for determining the best outcome from a set of linear relationships, to set prices in order to maximize revenue. [[Regression analysis]], another statistical tool, involves finding the ideal relationship between several variables through complex models and analysis. [[Discrete Choice Models|Discrete choice models]] can serve to predict customer behavior in order to target them with the right products for the right price.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt; Tools such as these allow a firm to optimize its product offerings, inventory levels, and pricing points in order to achieve the highest revenue possible.

===Dynamic re-evaluation===
Revenue management requires that a firm must continually re-evaluate their prices, products, and processes in order to maximize revenue. In a dynamic market, an effective revenue management system constantly re-evaluates the variables involved in order to move dynamically with the market. As micro-markets evolve, so must the strategy and tactics of revenue management adjust.&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt;

==In an organization==
Revenue management's fit within the organizational structure depends on the type of industry and the company itself. Some companies place revenue management teams within Marketing because marketing initiatives typically focus on attracting and selling to customers. Other firms dedicate a section of Finance to handle revenue management responsibilities because of the tremendous bottom line implications. Some companies have elevated the position of [[chief revenue officer]], or CRO, to the senior management level. This position typically oversees functions like sales, pricing, new product development, and advertising and promotions. A CRO in this sense would be responsible for all activities that generate revenue and directing the company to become more "revenue-focused".&lt;ref name="CrossR"/&gt;

[[Supply chain management]] and revenue management have many natural synergies. Supply chain management (SCM) is a vital process in many companies today and several are integrating this process with a revenue management system. On one hand, supply chain management often focuses on filling current and anticipated orders at the lowest cost, while assuming that demand is primarily exogenous. Conversely, revenue management generally assumes costs and sometimes capacity are fixed and instead looks to set prices and customer allocations that maximize revenue given these constraints. A company that has achieved excellence in supply chain management and revenue management individually may have many opportunities to increase profitability by linking their respective operational focus and customer-facing focus together.&lt;ref name="Phillips"/&gt;

[[Business Intelligence]] platforms have also become increasingly integrated with the Revenue Management process. These platforms, driven by [[data mining]] processes, offer a centralized data and technology environment that delivers business intelligence by combining historical reporting and advanced analytics to explain and evaluate past events, deliver recommended actions and eventually optimize decision-making. Not synonymous with [[Customer Relationship Management]] (CRM), Business intelligence generates proactive forecasts, whereas CRM strategies track and document a company's current and past interactions with customers. Data mining this CRM information, however, can help drive a business intelligence platform and provide actionable information to aid decision-making.

==Developing industries==
The ability for revenue management to optimize price based on forecasted demand, price elasticity and competitive rates has incredible benefits, and many companies are rushing to develop their own revenue management capabilities.&lt;ref&gt;Peyton, J. (2009) Mobilizing global resources to transform the revenue management discipline. Presentation to 5th Annual Revenue Management &amp; Price Optimization Conference; 6 October, Atlanta, GA.&lt;/ref&gt; Many industries are beginning to embrace revenue management and 

* [[Financial Services]] – offer a wide range of products to a wide range of customers. Banks have applied segmented pricing tactics to loan holders, often utilizing heavy amounts of data and modeling to project interest rates based on how much a customer is willing to pay.&lt;ref&gt;Kadet, A. (2008) Price Profiling. SmartMoney 17(5): 80-85.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Mass media|Media]]/[[Telecommunications service provider|Telecom]] – a promotion-driven industry often focused on attracting customers with discounted plans and then retaining them at higher price points. Businesses in this industry often face regulatory constraints, demand volatility, and sales through multiple channels to both business and consumer segments. Revenue management can help these companies understand micro-markets and forecast demand in order to optimize advertising sales and long-term contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Kimms, A. and Müller-Bungart, M. (2006) 'Revenue management for broadcasting commercials: the channel's problem of selecting and scheduling ads to be aired', Int. J.

* [[Distributors]] – face a complex environment that often includes thousands of individual SKUs with several different product lifecycles. Each distributor must account for factors such as channel conflict, cross-product cannibalization, and competitive actions. Revenue Management has proved useful to distributors in promotion analysis and negotiated contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Bippert, D. (2009) Simultaneously maximizing consumer value and company profit from beginning to end. Presentation to 5th Annual Revenue Management &amp; Price Optimization Conference; 6 October, Atlanta, GA.Shikander&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Medical services|Medical Products and Services]] – deal with large fluctuations in demand depending on time of day and day of week. Hospital surgeries are often overflowing on weekday mornings but sit empty and underutilized on the weekend. Hospitals may experiment with optimizing their inventory of services and products based on different demand points. Additionally, revenue management techniques allow hospitals to mitigate claim underpayments and denials, thus preventing significant revenue leakage.&lt;ref&gt;Lieberman, W.H.

* [[Hotel]] and [[Hospitality]] services – daily revenue or yield management strategies are a popular practice within the hotel sector, particularly prominent in mature and large hotel markets such as in Western Europe and the North America. Key operating indicators Occupancy Rate (OR), Average Daily Rate (ADR) and Revenue per Available Room (RevPAR) are tracked using third party sources to follow direct competitor set averages in demand and price, thereby indicating penetration rate and performance index.&lt;ref&gt;Mauri, A.G.

Car Rental independent that adopt an advanced revenue management system can generally expect a revenue uplift between 2-4% annually.

== Biography ==

=== Early years and ''Uncle Sam''===
As a [[teenager]], Robert Geiss did not want to go to school because he thought that "if you want to make [[money]], you cannot sit at school every day". His father Reinhold Geiss offered him a job as a [[tradesman]] in his company, which Robert Geiss declined. He then went on holiday to [[Spain]], where he bought a pair of fitness trousers that he liked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Markus Lanz (vom 08. Mai 2013)|language=German|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g9PXhYsZksI|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; When he returned to Cologne, Geiss decided to design similar clothing for German fitness studios and founded ''Uncle Sam'' in 1986. Having sold his inventory very quickly over the winter season, Geiss started buying shirts and pants for 10 [[Deutsche Mark|DM]] in [[Turkey]]. He then re-sold them for 49 DM in Germany. At the height of his success, Geiss employed 120 people. At some point, [[Kaufhof AG]] wanted to buy the firm, but Geiss declined because of legal reasons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Markus Lanz (vom 08. Mai 2013)|language=German|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QAeWLER6E4M|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995 he finally sold his company for an undisclosed amount to an anonymous buyer and moved to Monaco with his wife Carmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Robert Geiss Vermögen|language=German|url=http://www.vermoegen.org/robert-geiss-vermoegen/|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Return to work and family ===
After ten years of partying and living the jet-set life, Geiss started to engage in buying, refurbishing and reselling luxury real estate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bild.de/unterhaltung/tv/die-geissens/wie-reich-sind-sie-wirklich-36380434.bild.html Bild] Retrieved 6 June 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="RAAB"&gt;{{cite news|title=Die Geissens zu Gast bei Stefan Raab|language=German|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sruSARA0Tl8|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004 his brother bought back ''Uncle Sam'' and became [[CEO]] of the company. Being friends with [[banker]]s in Monaco, Geiss also invested in the stock market.&lt;ref name="RAAB"/&gt; On May 30, 2003 his first daughter Davina Shakira was born, followed by his second daughter, Shania Tyra Maria on July 30, 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Die Geissens sind der Schrecken aller Millionäre.|language=German|url=https://www.welt.de/fernsehen/article109117192/Die-Geissens-sind-der-Schrecken-aller-Millionaere.html|accessdate=10 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sergey Yevgenyevich Naryshkin''' ({{lang-rus|Серге́й Евге́ньевич Нары́шкин|p=sʲɪrˈɡʲej jɪˈvɡʲenʲɪvʲɪtɕ nɐˈrɨʂkʲɪn}}; born 27 October 1954) is a [[Russia]]n official, politician and businessman who has been [[Chairman of the State Duma]] (2011 - 2016). Previously he was head of the [[Russian presidential administration|Administration]] of the [[President of Russia]] from May 2008 to December 2011; he was also chairman of the [[Historical Truth Commission]] in May 2009 until it was dissolved in February 2012.

==Early life and education==
Sergei Ivanovich Naryshkin was born in Leningrad and graduated from [[Baltic State Technical University|Leningrad Institute of Mechanics]] with a degree in engineering in 1978. In the 1990s he also graduated from [[International Management Institute of Saint Petersburg]] with a degree in economics.&lt;ref name="Naryshkin MT Bio"&gt;{{cite web |title=Sergei Naryshkin|url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mt_profile/sergei_naryshkin/434258.html |publisher=''[[The Moscow Times]]'' |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111029162554/http://www.themoscowtimes.com/mt_profile/sergei_naryshkin/434258.html |archive-date=October 29, 2011 |quote=Education: Radio-mechanical engineering, Leningrad Mechanical Institute, 1978. Economics, Petersburg International Management Institute, 1997.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015, Naryshkin's dissertation in economics was exposed as fraudulent in an investigation by [[Dissernet]], with more than half of the text plagiarized from other publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html|title=The Craziest Black Market in Russia|last=Neyfakh|first=Leon|date=May 22, 2016 |publisher=''Slate''|language=en-US|issn=1091-2339|access-date=December 30, 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161230022705/http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/cover_story/2016/05/the_thriving_russian_black_market_in_dissertations_and_the_crusaders_fighting.html |archive-date=December 30, 2016 |quote=Late last year, Russian newspapers reported what would have qualified as a stunning piece of news almost anywhere else: The chairman of the country’s largest parliamentary body had been exposed as a plagiarist.

In May 2008, Naryshkin was appointed chief of the [[Presidential Administration of Russia]]. 
In May 2009, President [[Dmitry Medvedev]] appointed him chairman of the [[Historical Truth Commission]].

Since the rise of tensions between European Union and Russia in 2014 Naryshkin was perceived as one of the main coordinators of contacts with European far-right and far-left parties supporting Russian foreign policy in Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.euractiv.com/section/europe-s-east/news/alde-wants-investigation-of-le-pen-s-contacts-with-moscow/|title=ALDE wants investigation of Le Pen’s contacts with Moscow|website=EurActiv.com|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Small Business School''' was a weekly, half-hour [[television]] program that began airing in 1994 first in the United States on [[Public Broadcasting Service|PBS]]-member stations and then throughout the world via the [[Voice of America]].&lt;ref name="history"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallbusinessschool.com|title=May The History Become the Future|work=Small Business School website|accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; The show went on location all over the USA and around the world to visit with the founders of a [[small business]] which had created work for at least ten years and they were recognized by their community and industry for their valuable contributions in making the world a better place.

The program was titled ''"Small Business Today"'' until 1995. Then, it was then titled ''"Small Business 2000."''  The producers said, "''We never expected to be still producing in 2000, so we had to re-brand the show a third time."''   &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/smallbiz/content/oct2004/sb20041013_6499_sb014.htm|title=I Want My Small-Biz TV! |last=Klein|first=Karen E.|date=2004-10-13|publisher=[[BusinessWeek]]|accessdate=2008-11-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the interviews, these owners talk about how they got their idea for a business, how they got started, and how they got over the hurdles.&lt;ref name="history2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smallbusinessschool.com|title=Small Business School|work=Small Business School website|accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many even talk about their initial failures. These interviews provide insight and inspiration for all business owners.

Each episode has a transcript, case study guide, overview and homepage to provide a means for viewers to further study each episode.

The show was on the air most actively between 1994 and 2008.  It has been in re-runs on PBS and [[Public, educational, and government access|PEG]] stations around the country.  The case study guides were first prepared for the PBS Adult Learning Satellite Service where they were made available to all the colleges and universities throughout the USA. Nobody can pay to be on this show and nobody has ever paid to be on it. For over 50 seasons the show was sponsored by many large American companies and for one season by the U.S. [[Small Business Administration]].

In December 1994 the television show put up its first website.  The transcripts, case study guides and overview were all posted.  By 1999 this online school for business owners began [[streaming video]] of key episodes.  By 2006, each key point within most of the weekly episodes began streaming as a short-burst, user-selected videos between one and five minutes long.  There were over 1800 video clips on the site that addressed key issues that typical business owners face every day.

{{nihongo|'''Tadahiro Sekimoto'''|関本忠弘|Sekimoto Tadahiro|extra=November 14, 1926 – November 11, 2007}} was a Japanese electronics engineer, a recipient of the [[IEEE Medal of Honor]] (2004), chairman of Japan's Institute for International Socio-Economic Studies (IISE), and former chairman of the Board of Councilors of the [[Japan Federation of Economic Organizations]] (Keidanren) who served as president and later chairman of Japan's [[NEC Corporation]] (NEC). Born in [[Hyōgo Prefecture|Hyōgo]], [[Japan]], Sekimoto earned his [[Bachelor of Science|BS]] in physics in 1948 and his [[Doctor of Engineering]] degree in 1962 at the [[University of Tokyo]].

On 11 November 2007, he died after a series of [[stroke]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nec.co.jp/press/en/0711/1201.html |title=Tadahiro Sekimoto, Former Chairman of NEC,Passed Away on November 11, 2007 |accessdate=2007-11-12 |publisher=NEC Corporation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Corporate career==
Sekimoto joined NEC, now a globally active Japanese information technologies conglomerate and member of the [[Sumitomo Group]], in 1948. He started his career at the company's Central Research Laboratories, where he advanced to chief of basic research in 1965. In August 1965 he was appointed to a two-year assignment at [[COMSAT]] in [[Washington, DC]], where he engaged in research on digital transmission technologies used in satellite communications. On his return to NEC in 1967, Sekimoto was appointed to manage the company's Communications Research Laboratory. He rose to general manager of NEC's Transmission Division in 1972 and, in 1974, was elected to the NEC board of directors. He was appointed senior vice president in 1977 and executive vice president with portfolio for sales in Japan in 1978. In this position, he enhanced the company's sales operations in the Japanese domestic market by creating structures conducive to marketing mass-produced electronics products. In 1980, Sekimoto was appointed president of NEC and launched NEC's C&amp;C concept for integrating computers and communications, which resulted in significant sales increases. Finally, Sekimoto served as chairman of the board from 1994 to 1998, when he resigned from the post (as well as from his chairmanship of the Keidanren Board of Councilors) to apologize for NEC's role in a scandal involving the [[Japan Defense Agency]], Japan's de facto defence ministry.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nec.co.jp/press/en/9810/2302.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contributions to communications technologies==
Sekimoto, in addition the accomplishments of his corporate career, made significant contributions to the advancement of communications technologies over more than 50 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ieee.org/portal/pages/about/awards/bios/2004moh.html&lt;/ref&gt; During his 17 years at NEC's Central Research Laboratories he designed early pulse-code modulation equipment down to the coding and decoding circuitry. During his two years at COMSAT, he set up a communications processing laboratory and oversaw or helped oversee numerous projects covering voice-, data-, and video-processing technologies, including the development of single-channel-per-carrier pulse-code-modulation multiple-access demand-assignment equipment and assigned it the acronym SPADE because "the ace of the spades in card games was regarded as almighty".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.i-ise.com/en/column/column_top.html&lt;/ref&gt; Later, in the early 1970s, Intelsat commercialized SPADE technology, which is credited with allowing developing countries to join global networks by making satellite communications affordable to them. A time-division multiple access (TDMA) system and an automatic routing system Sekimoto developed were not only hugely significant for satellite communications, but also became indispensable elements of cellular mobile communications thirty years on. Seminal in their day, many technologies and applications Sekimoto worked on at NEC and COMSAT are integral to modern telecommunications systems, and they helped lay the groundwork for the global networks that many societies now depend on.

Sekimoto has also authored numerous works, both technical publications and books written for a wider audience, and he has 35 Japanese and five non-Japanese patents to his credit.

==Recognition for accomplishments==
Sekimoto, an IEEE Life Fellow and a foreign associate of the [[National Academy of Engineering]] in the U.S., has been recognized for his contributions to communications with numerous awards. In addition to its Medal of Honor, the IEEE also awarded him its [[IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal|Alexander Graham Bell Medal]], and he is a recipient of the IEEE Communication Society’s Edwin Howard Armstrong Award. He has also received the American Institute of Astronautics and Aeronautics’ Aerospace Communications Award. He was appointed a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour of France in 1995 and an honorary Knight Commander of the Order of the British Empire (KBE) in 1996. The Japanese government honoured him with a Medal of Honor with Purple Ribbon in 1982 and the Grand Cordon of the [[Order of the Sacred Treasure]] in 1997; he was posthumously granted the third degree of precedence in official rank in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;Japanese Wikipedia&lt;/ref&gt;

When speaking, Sekimoto invariably credits his mentor, Koji Kobayashi—also an engineer who served as president and then chairman of NEC, for inspiring him to pursue his interests. Sekimoto was lately active in promoting research on relations between Japan and other countries and ways to solve Japan's own social problems through his role at the IISE.

'''The Outies,''' formally known as the "Out &amp; Equal Workplace Awards", is an annual awards gala hosted by [[Out &amp; Equal]] Workplace Advocates. The Outies honor individuals and organizations that are leaders in advancing [[Egalitarianism|equality]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Raeburn|first=Nicole Christine|title=Changing corporate America from inside out: lesbian and gay workplace rights By |year=2004|publisher=U of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-3999-1|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=P2rdnDOqAagC&amp;pg=PA208&amp;dq=outies+lgbt+award&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=WdyGTLyyMYagsQPlqsiNCg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCoQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 September 2010|page=208}}&lt;/ref&gt; for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender ([[LGBT]]) employees in America’s workplaces. Through these awards, Out &amp; Equal provides the business and LGBT communities with examples of innovative approaches and proven successes to help create safe and equitable workplaces. The awards are presented annually at the [[Out &amp; Equal Workplace Summit]], a nationwide conference addressing LGBT issues in the workplace.

Outie Awards are given in five different categories, with two recognizing individuals and three recognizing organizations. To win an Outie, recipients must have taken significant action to create more equitable workplaces for members of the LGBT community.

==Award Categories==
The Workplace Excellence Award recognizes any employer that has an historic and ongoing commitment to pursuing and executing workplace equality for LGBT employees in their own workplace. This employer has a history of continually raising the bar of workplace equality for others to follow.&lt;ref name="outandequal.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outandequal.org/outie-awards |title=Overview &amp;#124; Out &amp; Equal Workplace Advocates |publisher=Outandequal.org |date=2012-11-01 |accessdate=2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Trailblazer Award recognizes an LGBT person who has made a significant contribution to advancing workplace equality. This individual’s activities will have made a marked improvement in their own workplace and/or have contributed to equality nationally.

The Champion Award recognizes any LGBTQ person or ally who has made a significant contribution to advancing workplace equality. The Champion Award winner will have shown a unique commitment to LGBTQ workplace rights and will have used their talents to further that cause, even if at some risk..

The LGBT ERG of the Year Award recognizes a particular employee resource group (ERG), sometimes referred to as a business group or network, that has a proven track record of success in advocating for LGBT equal rights in its own workplace.

The Regional Affiliate of the Year Award recognizes an Out &amp; Equal regional affiliate that has demonstrated commitment to the Out &amp; Equal mission through exceptional programming and sound organizational practices.

The Significant Achievement Award recognizes any employer that has made significant strides in the past year in advancing a fair and equitable workplace for its LGBT employees, such as: announcing domestic partner health insurance, including gender identity diversity training, or initiating a unique general advertising campaign that includes LGBT people.

==Selection Process==
All Outie nominations are read by the Out &amp; Equal awards committee and judging panel, which is made up of a diverse cross-section of leaders in the movement for LGBT workplace equality. Awards Committee members and judges change each year and are expected to opt out of voting if their own affiliations may bias their votes.

Nominees are evaluated on originality, duplicability of initiatives, leadership, results, and other criteria. Organizations are evaluated based on the aforementioned criteria, plus the degree to which they have incorporated the 20 Steps to an Out &amp; Equal Workplace. The previous year’s awardees are not considered for the same award for the following two years. Additionally, companies or organizations may only submit one nomination in the organization award categories and one nomination in the individual award categories, for a maximum possible total of two nominations from any one company or organization.&lt;ref name="outandequal.org"/&gt;

'''''The Theory of Business Enterprise''''' is an economics (or political economy) book by [[Thorstein Veblen]] published in 1904 that looks at the growing corporate domination of culture and the economy.

At its heart The Theory of Business Enterprise is an analysis of two intertwined but clashing motivations; that of business and that of industry. Business is the making of profits. Industry (or the "machine process") is the making of goods. "The captains of industry" ([[capitalist]]s or "[[Robber baron (industrialist)|robber baron]]s") curtailed production in order to keep prices and profits high. The worst fears of businessmen was a "free run of production" which would essentially collapse all profits.

Veblen's book was published at a high point of American concern with business combinations and trusts. Veblen employed his evolutionary analysis to explain these new forms.

Veblen placed the large business concerns in the context of the increasing industrialization of American life. Veblen asserted that even though there is a commercial need for industry, the machine process has outrun commercial needs and has penetrated every corner of mechanical industries. This process is characterized by the obligation for standardization, certainty and quantitative accuracy and precision.

The growth of industrial processes was certainly conquering the small business firms that had evolved earlier to organize craft production on a disjointed and small scale. Prior to these industrial concerns the only businesses that required significant investments were in shipping across oceans. And the only organizations with a pure business motivation were banking and merchant firms who dealt mainly with loaning, buying and selling.

The need for stability, certainty and uniformity of the industrial era, however, also clashed with modern commercial interests. Where industrial processes are the concerns of engineers and their quest for precision, businessmen are motivated solely by pecuniary gain through purchase and sale. While businessmen certainly represent an older order, in the new order, businessmen are able to leverage the machine process for pecuniary gain even if it means undermining the smooth functioning of the machine process.

It is not true, claims Veblen, that business interests coincide with that of the community. In fact, they may be opposites as business engages significantly in "competitive selling" through advertising, buying, selling and charging what the market will bear. Businessmen pay the wages of those engaged in competitive selling, such as salesmen, buyers, accountants and such, "not because their work is productive of benefit to the community, but because it brings a gain to the employers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Veblen|first=Thorstein|title=The Theory of the Business Enterprise|publisher=Transaction Books|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|date=1904|pages=62|isbn=0-87855-699-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also holds true for the industrial workers engaged in the industrial process under business management. The wages paid to these workmen are "competitively adjusted on grounds of the vendibility of the product", which is determined not by the serviceability of the product but by the aim to make a profitable sale.

Veblen claims that business instincts result in waste and "predation" that serve to enhance the social status of those who could benefit from predatory claims to goods and services.

&lt;blockquote&gt;Work that is, on the whole, useless or detrimental to the community at large may be as gainful to the business man and to the workmen whom he employs as work that contributes substantially to the aggregate livelihood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Veblen|first=Thorstein|title=The Theory of the Business Enterprise|publisher=Transaction Books|location=New Brunswick, New Jersey|date=1904|isbn=0-87855-699-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5050">The '''visual analogue scale''' or '''visual analog scale''' ('''VAS''') is a [[psychometrics|psychometric]] response scale which can be used in [[questionnaire]]s. It is a measurement instrument for subjective characteristics or attitudes that cannot be directly measured. When responding to a VAS item, respondents specify their level of agreement to a statement by indicating a position along a continuous line between two end-points.

==Comparison to other scales==
This continuous (or "analogue") aspect of the scale differentiates it from discrete scales such as the [[Likert scale]]. There is evidence showing that visual analogue scales have superior metrical characteristics than discrete scales, thus a wider range of statistical methods can be applied to the measurements.&lt;ref name="Reips Funke"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Reips |first1=U.-D. |last2=Funke |first2=F |title=Interval level measurement with visual analogue scales in Internet-based research: VAS Generator. |journal=Behavior Research Methods |volume=40 |pages=699–704 |year=2008 |doi=10.3758/BRM.40.3.699 |url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/iscience/reips/pubs/papers/BRM2008reips&amp;funke_interval_level_vas.pdf |format=PDF |pmid=18697664}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The VAS can be compared to other linear scales such as the [[Likert scale]] or [[Borg scale]]. The sensitivity and reproducibility of the results are broadly very similar, although the VAS may outperform the other scales in some cases.&lt;ref name="Reips Funke"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grant | first1 = S. | last2 = Aitchison | first2 = T. | last3 = Henderson | first3 = E. | last4 = Christie | first4 = J. | last5 = Zare | first5 = S. | last6 = McMurray | first6 = J. | last7 = Dargie | first7 = H. | year = 1999 | title = A comparison of the reproducibility and the sensitivity to change of visual analogue scales, Borg scales, and Likert scales in normal subjects during submaximal exercise | url = | journal = Chest | volume = 116 | issue = 5| pages = 1208–17 | doi = 10.1378/chest.116.5.1208 | pmid=10559077}}&lt;/ref&gt; These advantages extend to measurement instruments made up from combinations of visual analogue scales, such as semantic differentials.&lt;ref name="Funke Reips"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Funke |first1=F |last2=Reips |first2=U.-D. |title=Why semantic differentials in Web-based research should be made from visual analogue scales and not from 5-point scales. |journal=Field Methods |volume=24 |pages=310–327 |year=2012 |doi=10.1177/1525822X12444061 |url=http://www.uni-konstanz.de/iscience/reips/pubs/papers/Funke_&amp;_Reips_(in_press)_%201.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==
Recent advances in methodologies for Internet-based research&lt;ref&gt;U.-D. Reips (2006) Web-based methods. In M. Eid &amp; E. Diener (Eds.), ''Handbook of multimethod measurement in psychology'' (pp. 73-85). Washington, DC: American Psychological Association. {{doi|10.1037/11383-006}}&lt;/ref&gt; include the development and evaluation of visual analogue scales for use in Internet-based [[questionnaire]]s.&lt;ref name="Reips Funke"/&gt;

VAS is the most common [[pain scale]] for quantification of [[endometriosis]]-related pain and [[skin graft]] donor site-related pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Sinha S, Schreiner AJ, Biernaskie J, Nickerson D, Gabriel VA |title=Treating pain on skin graft donor sites: review and clinical recommendations. |journal=J Trauma Acute Care Surg |volume= |issue= |pages= |date=June 2017 |pmid=28598907 |doi=10.1097/TA.0000000000001615}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review came to the conclusion that VAS and [[numerical rating scale]] (NRS) were the best adapted pain scales for pain measurement in endometriosis. For research purposes, and for more detailed pain measurement in clinical practice, the review suggested use of VAS or NRS for each type of typical pain related to endometriosis ([[dysmenorrhea]], deep [[dyspareunia]] and non-menstrual [[chronic pelvic pain]]), combined with the [[clinical global impression]] (CGI) and a [[quality of life]] scale.&lt;ref name="BourdelAlves2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bourdel|first1=N.|last2=Alves|first2=J.|last3=Pickering|first3=G.|last4=Ramilo|first4=I.|last5=Roman|first5=H.|last6=Canis|first6=M.|title=Systematic review of endometriosis pain assessment: how to choose a scale?|journal=Human Reproduction Update|volume=21|issue=1|year=2014|pages=136–152|issn=1355-4786|doi=10.1093/humupd/dmu046|pmid=25180023}}&lt;/ref&gt;
VAS is being increasingly used for the assessment of loudness and annoyance of acute and chronic tinnitus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adamchic | first1 = I | last2 = Langguth | first2 = B | last3 = Hauptmann | first3 = C | last4 = Tass | first4 = PA | year = 2012 | title = Psychometric evaluation of visual analog scale for the assessment of chronic tinnitus | url = | journal = American Journal of Audiology | volume = 21 | issue = | pages = 215–225 | doi = 10.1044/1059-0889(2012/12-0010) }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Waste management''' (or '''waste disposal''') are the activities and actions required to manage [[waste]] from its inception to its final disposal.&lt;ref name="UN-1997"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Statistics Division - Environment Statistics|url=http://unstats.un.org/unsd/environmentgl/|website=unstats.un.org|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This includes the collection, transport, treatment and disposal of waste, together with monitoring and regulation of the waste management process.

Waste can be solid, liquid, or gaseous and each type has different methods of disposal and management. Waste management deals with all types of waste, including industrial, biological, and household. In some cases waste can pose a threat to human health.&lt;ref name=JWM&gt;{{cite journal |date=March 2014 |title=Editorial Board/Aims &amp; Scope |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X14000269 | doi=10.1016/S0956-053X(14)00026-9 |journal=Waste Management |volume=34 |issue=3 |pages=IFC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste is produced by human activity, for example the extraction and processing of raw materials.&lt;ref name="UN97"&gt;{{cite web|title=United Nations Statistics Division - Environment Statistics|url= https://unstats.un.org/unsd/environmentgl/gesform.asp?getitem=1178|website=unstats.un.org|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Waste management is intended to reduce adverse effects of waste on human [[health]], the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] or [[aesthetics]].

Waste management practices are not uniform among countries ([[developed nation|developed]] and [[developing nation]]s); regions ([[urban area|urban]] and [[rural area]]s), and [[residential area|residential]] and [[industry|industrial]] sectors can all take different approaches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Davidson |first=Gary |date=June 2011 |title=Waste Management Practices: Literature Review |accessdate=3 March 2017|publisher=Dalhousie University - Office of Sustainability |url=https://www.dal.ca/content/dam/dalhousie/pdf/sustainability/Waste%20Management%20Literature%20Review%20Final%20June%202011%20(1.49%20MB).pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large portion of waste management practices deal with [[municipal solid waste]] (MSW) which is the bulk of the waste that is created by household, industrial, and commercial activity.&lt;ref name=HMSW&gt;{{cite book|date=2003 |title=Handbook of Solid Waste Management and Waste Minimization Technologies |pages=337–465 |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/B9780750675079500103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Principles of waste management==
[[File:Waste hierarchy rect-en.svg|thumb|300px|Diagram of the waste hierarchy]]

===Waste hierarchy===
The [[waste hierarchy]] refers to the "3 Rs" [[Reduce (waste)|reduce]], [[reuse]] and [[recycling|recycle]], which classifies waste management strategies according to their desirability in terms of [[waste minimisation]]. The waste hierarchy is the cornerstone of most waste minimisation strategies. The aim of the waste hierarchy is to extract the maximum practical benefits from products and to generate the minimum amount of end waste; see: [[resource recovery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.disposalmag.com/#The_Proper_Care_and_Use_of_a_Garbage_Disposal|title=The Proper Care and Use of a Garbage Disposal|last=Albert|first=Raleigh|date=4 August 2011|website=Disposal Mag|language=en-US|dead-url=|access-date=2017-03-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The waste hierarchy is represented as a pyramid because the basic premise is that policies should promote measures to prevent the generation of waste. The next step or preferred action is to seek alternative uses for the waste that has been generated i.e. by re-use. The next is recycling which includes composting. Following this step is material recovery and [[waste-to-energy]]. The final action is disposal, in landfills or through incineration without [[energy recovery]]. This last step is the final resort for waste which has not been prevented, diverted or recovered.&lt;ref name=UN&gt;{{cite book |publisher=United Nations Environmental Programme |year=2013 |title=Guidelines for National Waste Management Strategies Moving from Challenges to Opportunities |url=http://www.unep.org/ietc/Portals/136/Publications/Waste%20Management/UNEP%20NWMS%20English.pdf |isbn=978-92-807-3333-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} The waste hierarchy represents the progression of a product or material through the sequential stages of the pyramid of waste management. The hierarchy represents the latter parts of the life-cycle for each product.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

===Life-cycle of a product===
The life-cycle begins with design, then proceeds through manufacture, distribution, and primary use and then follows through the waste hierarchy's stages of reduce, reuse and recycle.  Each stage in the life-cycle offers opportunities for policy intervention, to rethink the need for the product, to redesign to minimize waste potential, to extend its use.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Product life-cycle analysis is a way to optimize the use of the world's limited resources by avoiding the unnecessary generation of waste.

===Resource efficiency===
[[Resource efficiency]] reflects the understanding that global economic growth and development can not be sustained at current production and consumption patterns. Globally, humanity extracts more resources to produce goods than the planet can replenish.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} Resource efficiency is the reduction of the environmental impact from the production and consumption of these goods, from final raw material extraction to last use and disposal. This process of resource efficiency can address [[sustainability]].

===Polluter-pays principle===
The [[polluter-pays principle]] mandates that the polluting party pays for the impact on the environment. With respect to waste management, this generally refers to the requirement for a waste generator to pay for appropriate disposal of the unrecoverable material.

==History==
{{Main article|History of waste management}}
Throughout most of history, the amount of [[waste]] generated by humans was insignificant due to low [[population density]] and low societal levels of the exploitation of [[natural resources]]. Common waste produced during pre-modern times was mainly ashes and human [[biodegradable waste]], and these were released back into the ground locally, with minimum [[environmental degradation|environmental impact]]. Tools made out of [[wood]] or [[metal]] were generally reused or passed down through the generations.

However, some civilizations do seem to have been more profligate in their waste output than others. In particular, the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] of [[Central America]] had a fixed monthly ritual, in which the people of the village would gather together and burn their rubbish in large dumps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Barbalace |first=Roberta Crowell |url=http://environmentalchemistry.com/yogi/environmental/wastehistory.html |title=The History of Waste |publisher=EnvironmentalChemistry.com |date=2003-08-01 |accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern era===
[[File:SirEdwinChadwick.jpg|thumb|upright|Sir [[Edwin Chadwick]]'s 1842 report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' was influential in securing the passage of the first legislation aimed at waste clearance and disposal.]]
Following the onset of [[industrial revolution|industrialisation]] and the sustained urban growth of large population centres in [[England]], the buildup of waste in the cities caused a rapid deterioration in levels of [[sanitation]] and the general quality of urban life. The streets became choked with filth due to the lack of waste clearance regulations.&lt;ref&gt;Florence Nightingale, ''[http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/nightingale-rural.asp Selected Writings of Florence Nightingale]'', ed. Lucy Ridgely Seymer (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1954), pp. 38287&lt;/ref&gt; Calls for the establishment of a municipal authority with waste removal powers occurred as early as 1751, when [[Corbyn Morris]] in London proposed that "... as the preservation of the health of the people is of great importance, it is proposed that the cleaning of this city, should be put under one uniform public management, and all the filth be...conveyed by the [[Thames]] to proper distance in the country".&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite web|title=Centenary History of Waste and Waste Managers in London and South East England|first=Lewis|last=Herbert|publisher=[[Chartered Institution of Wastes Management]]|year=2007|url=http://ciwm.activedition.com/nmsruntime/saveasdialog.aspx?lID=1094&amp;sID=469}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, it was not until the mid-19th century, spurred by increasingly devastating [[cholera]] outbreaks and the emergence of a public health debate that the first legislation on the issue emerged. Highly influential in this new focus was the report ''The Sanitary Condition of the Labouring Population'' in 1842&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Report...from the Poor Law Commissioners on an Inquiry into the Sanitary Conditions of the Labouring Population of Great Britain  |location=London |year=1842 |pages=369–372 |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/history/chadwick2.html |last=Chadwick |first=Edwin}} via {{cite web |author=Laura Del Col |publisher=The Victorian Web |title=Chadwick's Report on Sanitary Conditions |date=11 October 2002 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the [[social reform]]er, [[Edwin Chadwick]], in which he argued for the importance of adequate waste removal and management facilities to improve the health and wellbeing of the city's population.

In the UK, the Nuisance Removal and Disease Prevention Act of 1846 began what was to be a steadily evolving process of the provision of regulated waste management in London. The [[Metropolitan Board of Works]] was the first citywide authority that centralized sanitation regulation for the rapidly expanding city and the [[Public Health Act 1875]] made it compulsory for every household to deposit their weekly waste in "moveable receptacles: for disposal—the first concept for a dust-bin.&lt;ref name="NWRA"&gt;{{cite web|last=National Waste &amp; Recycling Association |url=http://www.environmentalistseveryday.org/publications-solid-waste-industry-research/information/history-of-solid-waste-management/early-america-industrial-revolution.php |title=History of Solid Waste Management |location= Washington, D.C. |accessdate=2013-12-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Manlove, Alliott furnace.jpg|thumb|left|[[Manlove, Alliott &amp; Co. Ltd.]] 1894 destructor furnace. The use of [[incinerator]]s for waste disposal became popular in the late 19th century.]]
The dramatic increase in waste for disposal led to the creation of the first [[incineration]] plants, or, as they were then called, "destructors". In 1874, the first incinerator was built in [[Nottingham]] by [[Manlove, Alliott &amp; Co. Ltd.]] to the design of Alfred Fryer.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt; However, these were met with opposition on account of the large amounts of ash they produced and which wafted over the neighbouring areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Recycling and the Politics of Urban Waste |author=Gandy, Matthew |year=1994 |publisher=Earthscan |isbn=9781853831683 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar municipal systems of waste disposal sprung up at the turn of the 20th century in other large cities of [[Europe]] and [[North America]]. In 1895, [[New York City]] became the first U.S. city with public-sector garbage management.&lt;ref name="NWRA"/&gt;

Early [[garbage truck|garbage removal trucks]] were simply open bodied [[dump truck]]s pulled by a team of horses. They became motorized in the early part of the 20th century and the first closed body trucks to eliminate odours with a dumping lever mechanism were introduced in the 1920s in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hardrawgathering.co.uk/covered-bodies/|archive-url=https://archive.is/20150106135610/http://www.hardrawgathering.co.uk/covered-bodies/|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2015-01-06|title=Covered Bodies}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were soon equipped with 'hopper mechanisms' where the scooper was loaded at floor level and then hoisted mechanically to deposit the waste in the truck. The [[Garwood Load Packer]] was the first truck in 1938, to incorporate a hydraulic compactor.

==Waste handling and transport==
{{main article|Waste collection vehicle|Dustbin|Waste sorting}}
[[File:Bin.JPG|right|thumb|Molded plastic, wheeled waste bin in [[Berkshire]], England]]

Waste collection methods vary widely among different countries and regions. Domestic waste collection services are often provided by local government authorities, or by private companies for industrial and commercial waste. Some areas, especially those in less developed countries, do not have formal waste-collection systems.

===Waste handling practices===
[[Curbside collection]] is the most common method of disposal in most European countries, [[Canada]], [[New Zealand]] and many other parts of the developed world in which waste is collected at regular intervals by specialised trucks. This is often associated with curb-side waste segregation. In rural areas waste may need to be taken to a transfer station. Waste collected is then transported to an appropriate disposal facility.
In some areas, vacuum collection is used in which waste is transported from the home or commercial premises by vacuum along small bore tubes. Systems are in use in Europe and North America.
{{main article|Automated vacuum collection}}
In some jurisdictions unsegregated waste is collected at the curb-side or from waste transfer stations and then sorted into recyclables and unusable waste. Such systems are capable of sorting large volumes of solid waste, salvaging recyclables, and turning the rest into bio-gas and soil conditioner.
In [[San Francisco]], the local government established its ''Mandatory Recycling and Composting Ordinance'' in support of its goal of "Zero waste by 2020", requiring everyone in the city to keep recyclables and compostables out of the landfill. The three streams are collected with the curbside "Fantastic 3" bin system – blue for recyclables, green for compostables, and black for landfill-bound materials – provided to residents and businesses and serviced by San Francisco's sole refuse hauler, Recology. The City's "Pay-As-You-Throw" system charges customers by the volume of landfill-bound materials, which provides a financial incentive to separate recyclables and compostables from other discards. The City's Department of the Environment's Zero Waste Program has led the City to achieve 80% diversion, the highest diversion rate in North America.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.siemens.com/entry/cc/features/greencityindex_international/all/en/pdf/report_northamerica_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Other businesses such as [[Waste Industries]] use a variety of colors to distinguish between trash and recycling cans.

==Financial models==
In most developed countries, domestic waste disposal is funded from a national or local tax which may be related to income, or property values. Commercial and industrial waste disposal is typically charged for as a commercial service, often as an integrated charge which includes disposal costs. This practice may encourage disposal contractors to opt for the cheapest disposal option such as landfill rather than the environmentally best solution such as re-use and recycling.

In some areas such as [[Taipei]], the city government charges its households and industries for the volume of rubbish they produce. Waste is collected by the city council only if it is put in government issued rubbish bags. This policy has successfully reduced the amount of waste the city produces and increased the recycling rate.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

[[Morocco]] has also seen benefits from implementing a $300 million sanitary [[landfill]] system. While it might appear to be a costly investment, the country's government predicts that it has saved them another $440 million in damages, or consequences of failing to dispose of waste properly.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/leaders/2018/09/27/how-the-world-should-cope-with-its-growing-piles-of-rubbish|title=How the world should cope with its growing piles of rubbish|work=The Economist|access-date=2018-10-03|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Disposal methods==

===Landfill===

[[File:Landfill compactor.jpg|thumb|A [[Waste compaction|landfill compaction vehicle]] in action.]]
[[File:District heating plant spittelau ssw crop1.png|thumb|Spittelau incineration plant in [[Vienna]]]]

===Incineration===
{{main article|Incineration}}
Incineration is a disposal method in which solid organic wastes are subjected to combustion so as to convert them into residue and gaseous products. This method is useful for disposal of both municipal solid waste and solid residue from waste water treatment. This process reduces the volumes of solid waste by 80 to 95 percent.&lt;ref&gt;http://web.mit.edu/urbanupgrading/urbanenvironment/resources/references/pdfs/DecisionMakers.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Incineration and other high temperature waste treatment systems are sometimes described as "[[thermal treatment]]". Incinerators convert waste materials into [[heat]], [[gas]], [[steam]], and [[Incineration#Solid outputs|ash]].

Incineration is carried out both on a small scale by individuals and on a large scale by industry. It is used to dispose of solid, liquid and gaseous waste. It is recognized as a practical method of disposing of certain [[hazardous waste]] materials (such as biological [[medical waste]]). Incineration is a controversial method of waste disposal, due to issues such as emission of gaseous [[pollutants]].

Incineration is common in countries such as [[Japan]] where land is more scarce, as the facilities generally do not require as much area as landfills. [[Waste-to-energy]] (WtE) or energy-from-waste (EfW) are broad terms for facilities that burn waste in a furnace or boiler to generate heat, steam or electricity. Combustion in an incinerator is not always perfect and there have been concerns about pollutants in gaseous emissions from incinerator stacks. Particular concern has focused on some very persistent [[organic compound]]s such as [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxins]], [[furan]]s, and [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|PAH]]s, which may be created and which may have serious environmental consequences.

==Recycling==
{{main article|Recycling}}
[[File:Sign. Mahabalipuram.jpg|thumb|300px|Waste not the Waste. Sign in [[Tamil Nadu]], India]]
[[File:Steel recycling bales.jpg|thumb|Steel crushed and baled for [[recycling]]]]
Recycling is a [[resource recovery]] practice that refers to the collection and reuse of waste materials such as empty beverage containers. The materials from which the items are made can be reprocessed into new products. Material for recycling may be collected separately from general waste using dedicated bins and collection vehicles, a procedure called [[kerbside collection]]. In some communities, the owner of the waste is required to separate the materials into different bins (e.g. for paper, plastics, metals) prior to its collection. In other communities, all recyclable materials are placed in a single bin for collection, and the sorting is handled later at a central facility. The latter method is known as "[[single-stream recycling]]."&lt;ref&gt;City of Chicago, Illinois. Department of Streets and Sanitation. [http://www.cityofchicago.org/city/en/depts/streets/supp_info/recycling1/what_is_single_streamrecycling.html "What is Single Stream Recycling."] Accessed 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Montgomery County, Maryland. Division of Solid Waste Services. [http://www6.montgomerycountymd.gov/apps/dep/solidwaste/collectionservices/curbside.asp "Curbside Collection."] Accessed 2013-12-09.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common consumer products recycled include [[aluminium]] such as beverage cans, [[copper]] such as wire, [[steel]] from food and aerosol cans, old steel furnishings or equipment, rubber [[tire|tyres]], [[HDPE|polyethylene]] and [[Recycling of PET Bottles|PET]] bottles, [[glass]] bottles and jars, [[paperboard]] [[carton]]s, [[newspapers]], magazines and light paper, and [[corrugated fiberboard]] boxes.

[[Polyvinyl chloride|PVC]], [[LDPE]], [[Polypropylene|PP]], and [[Polystyrene|PS]] (see [[resin identification code]]) are also recyclable. These items are usually composed of a single type of material, making them relatively easy to recycle into new products. The recycling of complex products (such as computers and electronic equipment) is more difficult, due to the additional dismantling and separation required.

The type of  material accepted for recycling varies by city and country. Each city and country has different recycling programs in place that can handle the various types of recyclable materials.  However, certain variation in acceptance is reflected in the resale value of the material once it is reprocessed. In July 2017, the Chinese government announced an import ban of 24 categories of recyclables and solid waste, including plastic, textiles and mixed paper, placing tremendous impact on developed countries globally, which exported directly or indirectly to China.&lt;ref&gt;Walker, T. R. (2018). China's ban on imported plastic waste could be a game changer. Nature, 553(7689), 405-405.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Re-use==

===Biological reprocessing===
{{main article|Composting|Home composting|Anaerobic digestion|Microbial fuel cell}}
[[File:Compost Heap.jpg|thumb|An active [[compost]] heap.]]
Recoverable materials that are organic in nature, such as [[Green waste|plant material]], food scraps, and paper products, can be recovered through [[composting]] and digestion processes to [[decompose]] the organic matter. The resulting organic material is then recycled as [[mulch]] or [[compost]] for agricultural or landscaping purposes. In addition, waste gas from the process (such as methane) can be captured and used for generating electricity and heat (CHP/cogeneration) maximising efficiencies. The intention of biological processing in waste management is to control and accelerate the natural process of decomposition of organic matter. (See [[resource recovery]]).

===Energy recovery===
{{main article|Waste-to-energy}}
Energy recovery from waste is the conversion of non-recyclable waste materials into usable heat, electricity, or fuel through a variety of processes, including combustion, gasification, pyrolyzation, anaerobic digestion, and [[landfill gas]] recovery.&lt;ref name=USEPA&gt;{{cite web|publisher=USEPA |year=2014 |title=Energy Recovery from Waste |url=http://www.epa.gov/waste/nonhaz/municipal/wte/}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process is often called waste-to-energy. Energy recovery from waste is part of the non-hazardous waste management hierarchy. Using energy recovery to convert non-recyclable waste materials into electricity and heat, generates a renewable energy source and can reduce carbon emissions by offsetting the need for energy from fossil sources as well as reduce methane generation from landfills.&lt;ref name=USEPA/&gt; Globally, waste-to-energy accounts for 16% of waste management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=New Energy Corporation |year=2014 |title=Waste Hierarchy|url=http://www.newenergycorp.com.au/what-we-do/waste-hierarchy/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The energy content of waste products can be harnessed directly by using them as a direct combustion fuel, or indirectly by processing them into another type of fuel. Thermal treatment ranges from using waste as a fuel source for cooking or heating and the use of the gas fuel (see above), to fuel for [[boilers]] to generate steam and electricity in a [[turbine]]. [[Pyrolysis]] and [[gasification]] are two related forms of thermal treatment where waste materials are heated to high temperatures with limited [[oxygen]] availability. The process usually occurs in a sealed vessel under high [[pressure]]. Pyrolysis of solid waste converts the material into solid, liquid and gas products. The liquid and gas can be burnt to produce energy or refined into other chemical products (chemical refinery). The solid residue (char) can be further refined into products such as [[activated carbon]]. Gasification and advanced [[Plasma arc gasification]] are used to convert organic materials directly into a synthetic gas ([[syngas]]) composed of [[carbon monoxide]] and [[hydrogen]]. The gas is then burnt to produce electricity and [[steam]].
An alternative to pyrolysis is high temperature and pressure supercritical water decomposition (hydrothermal monophasic oxidation).

===Pyrolysis===
{{main article|Pyrolysis}}
Pyrolysis is often used to convert many types of domestic and industrial residues into a recovered fuel. Different types of waste input (such as plant waste, food waste, tyres) placed in the pyrolysis process potentially yield an alternative to fossil fuels.&lt;ref name=TSEP&gt;{{cite journal |date=September 2017 |title= Potential of pyrolysis processes in the waste management sector |url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2451904917300690| journal=Thermal Science and Engineering Progress |volume=3 | pages=171–197 |doi=10.1016/j.tsep.2017.06.003 | last1 = Czajczyńska | first1 = D. | last2 = Anguilano | first2 = L. | last3 = Ghazal | first3 = H. | last4 = Krzyżyńska | first4 = R. | last5 = Reynolds | first5 = A.J. | last6 = Spencer | first6 = N. | last7 = Jouhara | first7 = H.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrolysis is a process of thermo-chemical decomposition of organic materials by heat in the absence of stoichiometric quantities of [[oxygen]]; the decomposition produces various hydrocarbon gases.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford Reference – Pyrolysis&lt;/ref&gt; During pyrolysis, the molecules of object vibrate at high frequencies to an extent that molecules start breaking down. The rate of pyrolysis increases with [[temperature]]. In industrial applications, temperatures are above 430&amp;nbsp;°C (800&amp;nbsp;°F).&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia Britannica&lt;/ref&gt; Slow pyrolysis produces gases and solid charcoal.&lt;ref&gt;By Prabir Basu: ''Biomass Gasification, Pyrolysis and Torrefaction: Practical Design and Theory''&lt;/ref&gt; Pyrolysis hold promise for conversion of [[waste biomass]] into useful liquid fuel. Pyrolysis of waste wood and plastics can potentially produce fuel. The solids left from pyrolysis contain metals, glass, sand and pyrolysis coke which does not convert to gas.  Compared to the process of incineration, certain types of pyrolysis processes release less harmful by-products that contain alkali metals, sulphur, and chlorine. However, pyrolysis of some waste yields gasses which impact the environment such as HCl and SO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=WMJ&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2014 |title= Pyrolysis technologies for municipal solid waste: A review|url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0956053X14003596| journal=Waste Management |volume=34 |issue=12 | pages=2466–2486 |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2014.08.004 | last1 = Chen | first1 = Dezhen | last2 = Yin | first2 = Lijie | last3 = Wang | first3 = Huan | last4 = He | first4 = Pinjing}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resource recovery===
{{main article|Resource recovery}}
Resource recovery is the systematic diversion of waste, which was intended for disposal, for a specific next use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=USEPA |year=2012 |title=Frequent Questions |url=http://www.epa.gov/osw/hazard/wastemin/minimize/faqs.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is the processing of recyclables to extract or recover materials and resources, or convert to energy.&lt;ref name=Montana&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Government of Montana |year=2012 |title=Resource Recovery |url=http://deq.mt.gov/solidwaste/resourcerecovery.mcpx}}&lt;/ref&gt; These activities are performed at a resource recovery facility.&lt;ref name=Montana/&gt; Resource recovery is not only environmentally important, but it is also cost-effective.&lt;ref name=traverse&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Grand Traverse County |year=2006 |title=What is Resource Recovery? |url=http://www.co.grand-traverse.mi.us/departments/resource_recovery/What_is_Resource_Recovery_.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; It decreases the amount of waste for disposal, saves space in landfills, and conserves natural resources.&lt;ref name=traverse/&gt;

Resource recovery (as opposed to waste management) uses LCA (life cycle analysis) attempts to offer alternatives to waste management. For mixed MSW (Municipal Solid Waste) a number of broad studies have indicated that administration, source separation and collection followed by reuse and recycling of the non-organic fraction and energy and compost/fertilizer production of the organic material via anaerobic digestion to be the favoured path.

As an example of how resource recycling can be beneficial, many items thrown away contain metals which can be recycled to create a profit, such as the components in circuit boards.  Wood chippings in pallets and other packaging materials can be recycled to useful products for horticultural. The recycled chips can cover paths, walkways, or arena surfaces.

===Sustainability===
The management of waste is a key component in a business' ability to maintain [[ISO14001]] accreditation. The standard encourages companies to improve their environmental efficiencies each year by eliminating waste through [[resource recovery]] practices. One way to do this is by adopting resource recovery practices like [[recycling]] materials such as glass, food scraps, paper and cardboard, [[plastic bottle]]s and metal.  Recycled materials can often be sold to the construction industry. Many inorganic waste streams can be used to produce materials for construction. Concrete and bricks can be recycled as artificial gravel.  This topic was on the agenda of the International WASCON conference in Spain in June 2015 and on the international Conference on Green Urbanism, held in Italy 12–14 October 2016.{{citation needed|date=November 2016}}

{{main article|Sewage sludge treatment}}
Sewage sludge is produced by waste water treatment processes. Due to rapid urbanization, there has been an increase in municipal waste water that results 0.1–30.8&amp;nbsp;kg of sewage per population equivalent per year (kg/p.e/year).&lt;ref name=RSER&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2017 |title= Thermochemical processing of sewage sludge to energy and fuel: Fundamentals, challenges and considerations|url= https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1364032117309036| journal=Renewable and Sustainable Energy Reviews |volume=80| pages=888–913 |doi=10.1016/j.rser.2017.05.262 | last1 = Syed Shatir | first1 = A. Syed-Hassan | last2 = Wang | first2 = Yi | last3 = Hu | first3 = Song | last4 = Su | first4 = Sheng | last5 = Xiang | first5 = Jun}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common disposal practices of sewage sludge are incineration, composting, and landfill.

==Avoidance and reduction methods==
{{main article|Waste minimization}}
An important method of waste management is the prevention of waste material being created, also known as [[waste reduction]]. Methods of avoidance include reuse of second-hand products, repairing broken items instead of buying new ones, designing products to be refillable or reusable (such as cotton instead of plastic shopping bags), encouraging consumers to avoid using [[disposable products]] (such as disposable [[cutlery]]), removing any food/liquid remains from cans and packaging,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recycling-guide.org.uk/etiquette.html |title=Removing food remains to reduce waste |publisher=Recycling Guide |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and designing products that use less material to achieve the same purpose (for example, lightweighting of beverage cans).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psc.edu/science/ALCOA/ALCOA-light.html |title=Lightweighting |series=Projects in Scientific Computing |last1=Schneider |first1=Michael |last2=Johnson |first2=Liz |publisher=Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center, Carnegie Mellon University, University of Pittsburgh |date= |accessdate=2012-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International waste movement==
While waste transport within a given country falls under national regulations, [[waste trade|trans-boundary movement of waste]] is often subject to international treaties. A major concern to many countries in the world has been [[hazardous waste]]. The [[Basel Convention]], ratified by 172 countries, deprecates movement of hazardous waste from developed to less developed countries. The provisions of the Basel convention have been integrated into the EU waste shipment regulation.
[[Radioactive waste]], although considered hazardous, does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Basel Convention.

==Benefits==
Waste is not something that should be discarded or disposed of with no regard for future use.  It can be a valuable resource if addressed correctly, through policy and practise. With rational and consistent waste management practises there is an opportunity to reap a range of benefits. Those benefits include:
# Economic – Improving economic efficiency through the means of resource use, treatment and disposal and creating markets for recycles can lead to efficient practices in the production and consumption of products and materials resulting in valuable materials being recovered for reuse and the potential for new jobs and new business opportunities.
# Social – By reducing adverse impacts on health by proper waste management practises, the resulting consequences are more appealing civic communities.  Better social advantages can lead to new sources of employment and potentially lifting communities out of poverty especially in some of the developing poorer countries and cities.
# Environmental – Reducing or eliminating adverse impacts on the environment through reducing, reusing and recycling, and minimizing resource extraction can result in improved air and water quality and help in the reduction of [[greenhouse gas]] emissions.
# Inter-generational Equity – Following effective waste management practises can provide subsequent generations a more robust economy, a fairer and more [[social inclusion|inclusive society]] and a cleaner environment.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}

==Challenges in developing countries==
Areas with developing economies often experience exhausted waste collection services and inadequately managed and uncontrolled dumpsites. The problems are worsening.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}}  Problems with governance complicate the situation. Waste management in these countries and cities is an ongoing challenge due to weak institutions, chronic under-resourcing and rapid urbanization.&lt;ref name=UN/&gt;{{page needed|date=November 2016}} All of these challenges, along with the lack of understanding of different factors that contribute to the hierarchy of waste management, affect the treatment of waste.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |publisher=Science Direct |year=2013 |journal=Waste Management|volume=33 |issue=1 |pages=220–232 |doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2012.09.008 |title=Solid waste management challenges for cities in developing countries | last1 = Abarca Guerrero | first1 = Lilliana | last2 = Maas | first2 = Ger | last3 = Hogland | first3 = William}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2016|reason=Author? Title?}}

==Technologies==
Traditionally, the waste management industry has been a late adopter of new technologies such as [[Radio-frequency identification|RFID]] (Radio Frequency Identification) tags, GPS and integrated software packages which enable better quality data to be collected without the use of estimation or manual data entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Air-Trak Brings Visibility to Waste Management |date=4 February 2014 |url=http://www.rfidjournal.com/articles/view?11406 |publisher=RFID Journal |author=Claire Swedberg |access-date = 1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wheatley Stable''' was the ''[[Glossary of North American horse racing|nom de course]] '' for the [[thoroughbred]] [[horse racing]] partnership formed by [[Gladys Mills Phipps]] and her brother, [[Ogden Livingston Mills]]. The horses were raised at [[Claiborne Farm]] near [[Paris, Kentucky]].

==History==
Over the years, [[National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame|Hall of Fame]] [[horse trainer]]s [[James E. Fitzsimmons|Sunny Jim Fitzsimmons]], [[William C. Winfrey|Bill Winfrey]] and [[Edward A. Neloy|Eddie Neloy]] conditioned their horses. In February 1926, the stable recorded its first win and that year purchased the yearlings [[Diavolo (horse)|Diavolo]] and [[Dice (horse)|Dice]] from breeder [[Harry Payne Whitney]]. In 1927 Dice won four important stakes races but died unexpectedly. Nevertheless, his performance earned Wheatley Stable its first racing award when he was voted [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding 2-Year-Old Male Horse|U.S. Champion 2-Year-Old Colt]]. Diavolo developed more slowly but in 1929 won as [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Male Horse|U.S. Champion Handicap Male Horse]].

In 1928 Wheatley Stable horses debuted in the [[Triple Crown of Thoroughbred Racing|U.S. Triple Crown races]]. Between then and 1966 the stable entered seven [[Kentucky Derby]]s, seven [[Preakness Stakes]], and eleven [[Belmont Stakes]]. They won the 1957 Preakness Stakes with [[Bold Ruler]].

As part of a program honoring important horse racing tracks and racing stables, the [[Pennsylvania Railroad]] named its baggage car #5854 the "Wheatley Stable".

The Wheatley Stable bred and raised its horses at [[Claiborne Farm]] near [[Paris, Kentucky]]. Famously, in 1933 Wheatley Stable bred [[Seabiscuit]] but sold him early in his three-year-old season. They also bred [[Bold Bidder]], [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Male Horse|U.S. Champion Handicap Male Horse]] for 1966 and the [[Father|sire]] of Hall of Fame colt [[Spectacular Bid]]. Wheatley Stable bred and raced seven Champions of their own:
* [[Misty Morn]] -  [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding 3-Year-Old Filly|U.S. Champion 3-Year-Old Filly]] (1955), [[Eclipse Award for Outstanding Older Female Horse|U.S. Champion Handicap Female Horse]] (1955), Broodmare of the Year (1963)
