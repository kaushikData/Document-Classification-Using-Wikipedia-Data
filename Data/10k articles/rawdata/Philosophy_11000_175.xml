{{refimprove|date=December 2013}}
'''''A Book to Burn''''' ({{zh|t=焚書|s=焚书}}) is a philosophical work by the late-[[Ming Dynasty]] thinker and historian [[Li Zhi (philosopher)|Li Zhi]]. A critique of the social, philosophical and cultural norms of his time, the book was highly controversial and cemented Li Zhi's reputation as a heretic at the time.

==History==
Li Zhi began compiling the book in 1588, while living in a Buddhist monastery. It was first published in 1590 in [[Macheng]], with a foreword by [[Mei Guozhen]].

The title was chosen by Li Zhi, who was aware that the book would be highly controversial, and that calls for its burning would be inevitable. Indeed, soon after its publication, it incited a vitriolic response from the exponents of [[Cheng-Zhu School|Cheng-Zhu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.paulnoll.com/China/Dynasty/Ming-1403-Cheng-Zu.html |title=Cheng Zu, Zhu Di, 1403 -- 1424, Emperor Ming Dynasty |deadurl=no |accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; orthodoxy, accusing Li of heresy and poisoning minds; this controversy, however, only served to heighten Li Zhi's reputation.

In 1602, after the imprisonment and suicide of Li Zhi, the book was proscribed and all copies were burned; this ban proceeded even into the [[Qing Dynasty]]. Yet, while officially banned, it continued to be printed and distributed in private.

==Contents==
The book is divided into six chapters; chapters one and two are responses to other books and philosophical works, while chapters three and four are essays on assorted topics. Chapter five deals with the study of history, and the last chapter contains poetic works.

The book contains Li's defences of the [[School of Mind]], influenced by the teachings of the earlier scholar [[Wang Yangming]], against the Cheng-Zhu school. Among other arguments, it derided the ritual worship of [[Confucius]] as superstition, as well as the study of the classics in pursuit of understanding an 'absolute morality'. Instead, Li argued for a more intuitive understanding of virtue and morality, and of giving greater space for individualism, instead of 'taking Confucius' (idea of) right or wrong as the only idea of right or wrong'.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13990">In [[analytic philosophy]], '''anti-realism''' is an [[Epistemology|epistemological]] position first articulated by British philosopher [[Michael Dummett]]. The term was coined as an argument against a form of [[Philosophical realism|realism]] Dummett saw as 'colorless reductionism'.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Realism (1963)|Realism (1963)]] p. 145&lt;/ref&gt;

In anti-realism, the truth of a statement rests on its demonstrability through internal logic mechanisms, such as the [[context principle]] or [[intuitionistic logic]], in direct opposition to the realist notion that the truth of a statement rests on its correspondence to an external, independent reality.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Realism (1963)|Realism (1963)]] p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;  In anti-realism, this external reality is hypothetical and is not assumed.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Truth (1959)|Truth (1959)]] p. 24 (postscript)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Simon Blackburn|Blackburn, Simon]] ([2005] 2008). "realism/anti-realism," ''[[The Oxford Dictionary of Philosophy]]'', 2nd ed. revised, pp. 308–9. Oxford.&lt;/ref&gt;

Because it encompasses statements containing abstract ideal objects (i.e. mathematical objects), anti-realism may apply to a wide range of philosophic topics, from [[Physical body|material objects]] to the theoretical entities of [[science]], [[mathematical object|mathematical statement]], [[The problem of other minds|mental states, events and processes]], the [[past]] and the [[future]].&lt;ref&gt;[[#Realism (1963)|Realism (1963)]] pp. 147–8&lt;/ref&gt;

== Varieties ==
=== Metaphysical anti-realism&lt;!--'Metaphysical anti-realism' and 'Metaphysical antirealism' redirect here--&gt; ===
{{also|Philosophical skepticism}}
'''Metaphysical anti-realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; maintains a [[skepticism]] about the physical world, arguing either: 1) that nothing exists outside the mind, or 2) that we would have no access to a mind-independent reality, even if it exists.&lt;ref&gt;Karin Johannesson, ''God Pro Nobis: On Non-metaphysical Realism and the Philosophy of Religion'', Peeters Publishers, 2007, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The latter case often takes the form of a denial of the idea that we can have 'unconceptualised' experiences (see [[Myth of the Given]]).  Conversely, most realists (specifically, [[Indirect realism|indirect realists]]) hold that perceptions or [[sense data]] are caused by mind-independent objects. But this introduces the possibility of another kind of skepticism: since our understanding of [[causality]] is that the same effect can be produced by multiple causes, there is a [[Indeterminacy (philosophy)|lack of determinacy]] about what one is really perceiving, as in the [[brain in a vat]] scenario.

The main alternative to metaphysical anti-realism is [[metaphysical realism]].

On a more abstract level, [[model theory|model-theoretic]] anti-realist arguments hold that a given set of [[symbol]]s in a [[theory]] can be mapped onto any number of sets of real-world objects&amp;mdash;each set being a "model" of the theory—provided the relationship between the objects is the same (compare with [[symbol grounding]].)

In [[ancient Greek philosophy]], [[Problem of universals#Nominalism|nominalist (anti-realist) doctrines]] about [[universals (metaphysics)|universals]] were proposed by the [[Stoics]], especially [[Chrysippus]].&lt;ref&gt;John Sellars, ''Stoicism'', Routledge, 2014, pp. 84–85: "[Stoics] have often been presented as the first nominalists, rejecting the existence of universal concepts altogether. ... For Chrysippus there are no universal entities, whether they be conceived as substantial [[Platonic Forms]] or in some other manner.".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.iep.utm.edu/chrysipp/ Chrysippus – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; In [[early modern philosophy]], [[Conceptualism|conceptualist]] anti-realist doctrines about universals were proposed by thinkers like [[René Descartes]], [[John Locke]], [[Baruch Spinoza]], [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]], [[George Berkeley]], and [[David Hume]].&lt;ref&gt;David Bostock, ''Philosophy of Mathematics: An Introduction'', Wiley-Blackwell, 2009, p. 43: "All of Descartes, Locke, Berkeley, and Hume supposed that mathematics is a theory of our ''ideas'', but none of them offered any argument for this conceptualist claim, and apparently took it to be uncontroversial."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stefano Di Bella, Tad M. Schmaltz (eds.), ''The Problem of Universals in Early Modern Philosophy'', Oxford University Press, 2017, p. 64 "there is a strong case to be made that Spinoza was a ''conceptualist'' about universals" and p. 207 n. 25: "Leibniz's conceptualism [is related to] the Ockhamist tradition..."&lt;/ref&gt; In [[late modern philosophy]], anti-realist doctrines about knowledge were proposed by the [[German idealist]] [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]. Hegel was a proponent of what is now called [[Semantic inferentialism|inferentialism]]: he believed that the ground for the axioms and the foundation for the validity of the inferences are the right consequences and that the axioms do not explain the consequence.&lt;ref&gt;P. Stekeler-Weithofer (2016), [https://www.sozphil.uni-leipzig.de/cm/philosophie/files/2012/11/StekelerHegelsAnalyticPragmatism.pdf "Hegel's Analytic Pragmatism"], University of Leipzig, pp. 122–4.&lt;/ref&gt; Kant and Hegel held conceptualist views about universals.&lt;ref&gt;Oberst, Michael. 2015. "Kant on Universals." ''History of Philosophy Quarterly'' '''32'''(4):335–352.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;A. Sarlemijn, ''Hegel's Dialectic'', Springer, 1975, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[contemporary philosophy]], anti-realism was revived in the form of [[empirio-criticism]], [[logical positivism]], [[Semantic anti-realism (epistemology)|semantic anti-realism]] and scientific [[instrumentalism]] (see below).

=== Semantic anti-realism ===
{{main|Semantic anti-realism (epistemology)}}
The term "[[Semantic anti-realism (epistemology)|anti-realism]]" was introduced by [[Michael Dummett]] in his 1982 paper "Realism" in order to re-examine a number of classical philosophical disputes, involving such doctrines as [[nominalism]], [[Platonic realism]], [[idealism]] and [[phenomenalism]]. The novelty of Dummett's approach consisted in portraying these disputes as analogous to the dispute between [[intuitionism (philosophy of mathematics)|intuitionism]] and [[Platonism]] in the [[philosophy of mathematics]].

According to intuitionists (anti-realists with respect to mathematical objects), the [[truth]] of a mathematical statement consists in our ability to prove it. According to Platonic realists, the truth of a statement is proven in its correspondence to [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objective]] reality. Thus, intuitionists are ready to accept a statement of the form "P or Q" as true [[Disjunction and existence properties|only if we can prove P or if we can prove Q.]] In particular, we cannot in general claim that "P or not P" is true (the [[law of excluded middle]]), since in some cases [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|we may not be able to prove the statement "P" nor prove the statement "not P"]]. Similarly, intuitionists object to the [[existence property]] for classical logic, where one can prove &lt;math&gt;\exists x.\phi(x)&lt;/math&gt;, without being able to produce any term &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; of which &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; holds.

Dummett argues that this notion of truth lies at the bottom of various classical forms of anti-realism, and uses it to re-interpret [[phenomenalism]], claiming that it need not take the form of [[reductionism]].

Dummett's writings on anti-realism draw heavily on the later writings of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], concerning meaning and rule following, and can be seen as an attempt to integrate central ideas from the ''[[Philosophical Investigations]]'' into the constructive tradition of [[analytic philosophy]] deriving from [[Gottlob Frege]].

===Scientific anti-realism&lt;!--'Scientific anti-realism' and 'Scientific antirealism' redirect here--&gt;===
{{also|Semantic anti-realism (philosophy of science)}}
In [[philosophy of science]], anti-realism applies chiefly to claims about the non-reality of "unobservable" [[entity|entities]] such as [[electron]]s or [[gene]]s, which are not detectable with human senses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Construction Of What?|last=Hacking|first=Ian|publisher=Harvard University Press|year=1999|isbn=|location=|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy of Science: A Very Short Introduction|last=Okasha|first=Samir|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One prominent variety of '''scientific anti-realism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; is [[instrumentalism]], which takes a purely agnostic view towards the existence of unobservable entities, in which the unobservable entity X serves as an instrument to aid in the success of theory Y does not require proof for the existence or non-existence of X.

Some scientific anti-realists, however, deny that unobservables exist, even as non-truth conditioned instruments.

===Mathematical anti-realism===
{{main|Mathematical anti-realism}}
{{also|Post rem structuralism}}
In the [[philosophy of mathematics]], realism is the claim that mathematical entities such as 'number' have an observer-independent existence. [[Mathematical empiricism|Empiricism]], which associates numbers with concrete physical objects, and [[Mathematical Platonism|Platonism]], in which numbers are abstract, non-physical entities, are the preeminent forms of mathematical realism.

The "[[epistemic]] argument" against Platonism has been made by [[Paul Benacerraf]] and [[Hartry Field]]. Platonism posits that mathematical objects are ''[[abstract object|abstract]]'' entities. By general agreement, abstract entities cannot interact [[causal]]ly with physical entities ("the truth-values of our mathematical assertions depend on facts involving platonic entities that reside in a realm outside of space-time"&lt;ref&gt;Field, Hartry, 1989, ''Realism, Mathematics, and Modality'', Oxford: Blackwell, p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;) Whilst our knowledge of physical objects is based on our ability to [[perception|perceive]] them, and therefore to causally interact with them, there is no parallel account of how mathematicians come to have knowledge of abstract objects.&lt;ref&gt;"Since abstract objects are outside the nexus of causes and effects, and thus perceptually inaccessible, they cannot be known through their effects on us" — [[Jerrold Katz]], ''Realistic Rationalism'', 2000, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.philosophynow.org/issue81/ Philosophy Now: "Mathematical Knowledge: A dilemma"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/platonism-mathematics/#EpiAcc Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt;

Field developed his views into [[Mathematical fictionalism|fictionalism]]. Benacerraf also developed the philosophy of [[mathematical structuralism]], according to which there are no mathematical objects. Nonetheless, some versions of structuralism are compatible with some versions of realism.

====Counterarguments&lt;!--'Realistic rationalism' redirects here--&gt;====
Anti-realist arguments hinge on the idea that a satisfactory, [[Naturalism (philosophy)|naturalistic]] account of thought processes can be given for mathematical reasoning. One line of defense is to maintain that this is false, so that mathematical reasoning uses some special [[Intuition (knowledge)|intuition]] that involves contact with the [[Platonic realm]], as in the argument given by [[Sir Roger Penrose]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?TheEmperorsNewMind Review of] [[The Emperor's New Mind]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another line of defense is to maintain that abstract objects are relevant to mathematical reasoning in a way that is non causal, and not analogous to perception. This argument is developed by [[Jerrold Katz]] in his 2000 book ''Realistic Rationalism''. In this book, he put forward a position called '''realistic rationalism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which combines metaphysical realism and [[rationalism]].

A more radical defense is to deny the separation of physical world and the platonic world, i.e. the [[mathematical universe hypothesis]] (a variety of [[mathematicism]]). In that case, a mathematician's knowledge of mathematics is one mathematical object making contact with another.

The original rectangular base of {{convert|6|by|10|mi|km}} is now part of the so-called "Groom box", a rectangular area measuring {{convert|23|by|25|mi|km}}, of restricted airspace. The area is connected to the internal [[Nevada Test Site]] (NTS) road network, with paved roads leading south to [[Mercury, Nevada|Mercury]] and west to Yucca Flat. Leading northeast from the lake, the wide and well-maintained Groom Lake Road runs through a pass in the Jumbled Hills. The road formerly led to mines in the Groom basin, but has been improved since their closure. Its winding course runs past a security checkpoint, but the restricted area around the base extends further east. After leaving the restricted area, Groom Lake Road descends eastward to the floor of the [[Tikaboo Valley]], passing the dirt-road entrances to several small ranches, before converging with [[Nevada State Route 375|State Route 375, the "Extraterrestrial Highway"]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/04/13/travel/escapes/13extraterrestrial.html|title=Lonesome Highway to Another World?|accessdate=8 July 2007|author=Regenold, Stephen|date=13 April 2007|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; south of [[Rachel, Nevada|Rachel]].

==History==
The origin of the Area 51 name is unclear. The most accepted comes from a grid numbering system of the area by the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission|Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC); while Area 51 is not part of this system, it is adjacent to Area 15. Another explanation is that 51 was used because it was unlikely that the AEC would use the number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Strickland|first=Jonathan|title=How Area 51 Works|url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/space/aliens-ufos/area-51.htm#mkcpgn=fb6|newspaper=How Stuff Work}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U-2 program===
{{Main|Lockheed U-2}}

[[File:Area51WatertownNE.jpg|thumb|"The Ranch" with U-2 flight line]]
The Groom Lake test facility was established in April 1955 by the [[Central Intelligence Agency]] (CIA) for Project AQUATONE, the development of the [[Lockheed U-2]] strategic reconnaissance aircraft.

As part of the project, the director, [[Richard M. Bissell, Jr.]], understood that, given the extreme secrecy enveloping the project, the flight test and pilot training programs could not be conducted at [[Edwards Air Force Base]] or Lockheed's Palmdale facility. A search for a suitable testing site for the U-2 was conducted under the same extreme security as the rest of the project.&lt;ref name="Peebles"&gt;{{cite book|title=Dark Eagles, Revised Edition|publisher=Presidio Press|author=Peebles, Curtis|year=1999|location=Novato, CA|isbn=0-89141-696-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He notified Lockheed, who sent an inspection team out to Groom Lake. According to Lockheed's U-2 designer [[Kelly Johnson (engineer)|Kelly Johnson]]:&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt; 
{{quote|1="We flew over it and within thirty seconds, you knew that was the place&amp;nbsp;... it was right by a [[dry lake]]. Man alive, we looked at that lake, and we all looked at each other. It was another Edwards, so we wheeled around, landed on that lake, taxied up to one end of it. It was a perfect natural landing field&amp;nbsp;... as smooth as a billiard table without anything being done to it". Johnson used a compass to lay out the direction of the first runway. The place was called "Groom Lake".}}

The lakebed made an ideal strip from which they could test aircraft, and the Emigrant Valley's mountain ranges and the NTS perimeter, about {{convert|100|mi|km|abbr=on}} north of Las Vegas, protected the test site from visitors.&lt;ref name="shadow"&gt;{{cite book|title=Shadow Flights: America's Secret Air War Against the Soviet Union|publisher=Presidio Press|author=Peebles, Curtis|year=2000|location=Novato, CA|pages=141–144|isbn=978-0-89141-700-2|quote=I gave it a ten plus [score]&amp;nbsp;... a dry lake bed around three and a half miles around", and describes [[Tony LeVier]] showing the lake to Johnson and Bissell, and Johnson deciding to locate the runway "at south end of lake}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CIA asked the AEC to acquire the land, designated "Area 51" on the map, and add it to the Nevada Test Site.&lt;ref name="cia1992"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www2.gwu.edu/~nsarchiv/NSAEBB/NSAEBB434/|title=The Central Intelligence Agency and Overhead Reconnaissance: The U-2 and OXCART Programs, 1954–1974|publisher=History Staff, Central Intelligence Agency|author1=Pedlow, Gregory W. |author2=Welzenbach, Donald E. |year=1992|location=Washington DC}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|56–57}}

Johnson named the area "Paradise Ranch" to encourage workers to move to a place that the CIA's official history of the U-2 project would later describe as "the new facility in the middle of nowhere"; the name became shortened to "the Ranch".&lt;ref name="cia1992" /&gt;{{rp|57}}&lt;ref name=Powers&gt;{{Cite book |last=Powers |first=Francis |title=Operation Overflight: A Memoir of the U-2 Incident |publisher=Potomac Books, Inc. |year=1960 |ISBN=9781574884227 |page=15,19–20,22–23}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On 4 May 1955, a survey team arrived at Groom Lake and laid out a {{convert|5000|ft|m|adj=on}}, north-south runway on the southwest corner of the lakebed and designated a site for a base support facility. "The Ranch", also known as Site II, initially consisted of little more than a few shelters, workshops and trailer homes in which to house its small team.&lt;ref name="shadow" /&gt; In a little over three months, the base consisted of a single, paved runway, three hangars, a control tower, and rudimentary accommodations for test personnel. The base's few amenities included a movie theatre and volleyball court. Additionally, there was a mess hall, several water wells, and fuel storage tanks. By July 1955, CIA, Air Force, and Lockheed personnel began arriving. The Ranch received its first U-2 delivery on 24 July 1955 from Burbank on a [[C-124 Globemaster II]] cargo plane, accompanied by Lockheed technicians on a [[Douglas DC-3]].&lt;ref name="shadow" /&gt; Regular [[Military Air Transport Service]] flights were set up between Area 51 and Lockheed's [[Burbank, California]] offices. To preserve secrecy, personnel flew to Nevada on Monday mornings and returned to California on Friday evenings.&lt;ref name="cia1992" /&gt;{{rp|72}}

Four years of "Project 51" construction began on 1 October 1960 by Reynolds Electrical and Engineering Company (REECo) with double-shift construction schedules. The contractor upgraded base facilities and built a new {{convert|10000|ft|abbr=on}} runway (14/32) diagonally across the southwest corner of the lakebed. An [[Archimedean spiral]] approximately two miles across was marked on the dry lake so that an A-12 pilot approaching the end of the overrun could abort to the [[dry lake|playa]] instead of plunging the aircraft into the [[sagebrush steppe|sagebrush]]. Area 51 pilots called it "The Hook". For crosswind landings two unpaved airstrips (runways 9/27 and 03/21) were marked on the dry lakebed.&lt;ref name="TheOxcartStory"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/center-for-the-study-of-intelligence/kent-csi/vol15no1/html/v15i1a01p_0001.htm|title=The Oxcart Story|publisher=Cia.gov|date=|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By August 1961, construction of the essential facilities was completed (3 surplus [[United States Navy|Navy]] hangars were erected on the base's north side—hangars 4, 5, and 6.) A fourth, Hangar 7, was new construction. The original U-2 hangars were converted to maintenance and machine shops. Facilities in the main cantonment area included workshops and buildings for storage and administration, a commissary, control tower, fire station, and housing. The Navy also contributed more than 130 surplus Babbitt duplex housing units for long-term occupancy facilities. Older buildings were repaired, and additional facilities were constructed as necessary. A reservoir pond, surrounded by trees, served as a recreational area one mile north of the base. Other recreational facilities included a gymnasium, movie theatre, and a baseball diamond.&lt;ref name="TheOxcartStory"/&gt; A permanent aircraft fuel tank farm was constructed by early 1962 for the special [[JP-7]] fuel required by the A-12. Seven tanks were constructed, with a total capacity of 1,320,000 gallons.

For the arrival of OXCART; security was enhanced and the small civilian mine{{Specify|reason=name? coordinates?|date=October 2013}} in the Groom basin was closed. In January 1962, the [[Federal Aviation Administration]] (FAA) expanded the restricted airspace in the vicinity of Groom Lake. The lakebed became the center of a 600-square-mile addition to restricted area R-4808N.&lt;ref name="TheOxcartStory"/&gt;

The CIA facility received eight USAF [[F-101 Voodoo]]s for training, two [[T-33 Shooting Star]] trainers for proficiency flying, a [[C-130 Hercules]] for cargo transport, a U-3A for administrative purposes, a helicopter for search and rescue, and a [[Cessna 180]] for liaison use; and Lockheed provided an [[F-104 Starfighter]] for use as a [[chase plane]].&lt;ref name="TheOxcartStory"/&gt;

The first A-12 test aircraft was covertly trucked from Burbank on 26 February 1962, arrived at Groom Lake on 28 February,&lt;ref name=Timeline&gt;{{Cite report|title=A-12, YF-12A, &amp; SR-71 Timeline of Events|quote=30 Oct 1967 Dennis Sullivan flying an A-12 mission over North Vietnam had 6 missiles launched against him, 3 detonated, on post flight inspection, they found a small piece of metal from missile imbeded in lower wing fillet area (LSW)}}&lt;/ref&gt; was assembled, and made its first flight 26 April 1962 when the base had over 1,000 personnel. Initially, all not connected with a test were herded into the mess hall before each takeoff. This was soon dropped as it disrupted activities and was impractical with the large number of flights.&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt; The closed airspace above Groom Lake was within the [[Nellis Air Force Range]] airspace, and pilots saw the A-12 20–30 times (at least one signed a secrecy agreement.).&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt;

Groom was also the site of the first [[Lockheed D-21]] [[unmanned aerial vehicle|drone]] test flight on 22 December 1964 (not launched until 5 March 1966).&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt; By the end of 1963, nine A-12s were at Area 51, assigned to the CIA operated "1129th Special Activities Squadron".&lt;ref name="1129CIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ais.org/~schnars/aero/ol-det.htm|title=U-2 and SR-71 Units, Bases and Detachments|publisher=Ais.org|year=1995|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although it was decided{{by whom|date=October 2013}} on 10 January 1967 to phase out the CIA A-12 program, A-12s at Groom Lake occasionally deployed to [[Kadena AB]], Okinawa, for Project Black Shield in 1967&lt;ref name="Timeline" /&gt; (the 9 A-12s were stored at Palmdale in June 1968 and the 1129th SAS was inactivated.)&lt;ref name="1129CIA"/&gt;

===D-21 Tagboard===
{{Main|Lockheed D-21}}
[[File:M21Ship2-cropped.jpg|thumb|The D-21 mounted on the back of the M-21. Note the intake cover on the drone, which was used on early flights.]]

Following the loss of [[Gary Powers]]' [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] over the Soviet Union, there were several discussions about using the A-12 OXCART as an unpiloted drone aircraft. Although Kelly Johnson had come to support the idea of drone reconnaissance, he opposed the development of an A-12 drone, contending that the aircraft was too large and complex for such a conversion. However, the Air Force agreed to fund the study of a high-speed, high-altitude drone aircraft in October 1962. The Air Force interest seems to have moved the CIA to take action, the project designated "Q-12". By October 1963, the drone's design had been finalized. At the same time, the Q-12 underwent a name change. To separate it from the other A-12-based projects, it was renamed the "D-21". (The "12" was reversed to "21"). "Tagboard" was the project's code name.&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt;

The first D-21 was completed in the spring of 1964 by Lockheed. After four more months of checkouts and static tests, the aircraft was shipped to Groom Lake and reassembled. It was to be carried by a two-seat derivative of the A-12, designated the "M-21". When the D-21/M-21 reached the launch point, the first step would be to blow off the D-21's inlet and exhaust covers. With the D-21/M-21 at the correct speed and altitude, the LCO would start the ramjet and the other systems of the D-21. "With the D-21's systems activated and running, and the launch aircraft at the correct point, the M-21 would begin a slight pushover, the LCO would push a final button, and the D-21 would come off the pylon".&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt;

Difficulties were addressed throughout 1964 and 1965 at Groom Lake with various technical issues. Captive flights showed unforeseen aerodynamic difficulties. By late January 1966, more than a year after the first captive flight, everything seemed ready. The first D-21 launch was made on 5 March 1966 with a successful flight, with the D-21 flying 120 miles with limited fuel. A second D-12 flight was successful in April 1966 with the drone flying 1,200 miles, reaching Mach 3.3 and 90,000 feet. An accident on 30 July 1966 with a fully fueled D-21, on a planned checkout flight suffered from a non-start of the drone after its separation, causing it to collide with the M-21 launch aircraft. The two crewmen ejected and landed in the ocean 150 miles offshore. One crew member was picked up by a helicopter, but the other, having survived the aircraft breakup and ejection, drowned when sea water entered his pressure suit. Kelly Johnson personally cancelled the entire program, having had serious doubts from the start of the feasibility. A number of D-21s had already been produced, and rather than scrapping the whole effort, Johnson again proposed to the Air Force that they be launched from a [[Boeing B-52 Stratofortress|B-52H]] bomber.&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt;

By late summer of 1967, the modification work to both the D-21 (now designated D-21B) and the B-52Hs were complete. The test program could now resume. The test missions were flown out of Groom Lake, with the actual launches over the Pacific. The first D-21B to be flown was Article 501, the prototype. The first attempt was made on 28 September 1967, and ended in complete failure. As the B-52 was flying toward the launch point, the D-21B fell off the pylon. The B-52H gave a sharp lurch as the drone fell free. The booster fired and was "quite a sight from the ground". The failure was traced to a stripped nut on the forward right attachment point on the pylon. Several more tests were made, none of which met with success. However, the fact is that the resumptions of D-21 tests took place against a changing reconnaissance background. The A-12 had finally been allowed to deploy, and the [[Lockheed SR-71 Blackbird|SR-71]] was soon to replace it. At the same time, new developments in reconnaissance satellite technology were nearing operation. Up to this point, the limited number of satellites available restricted coverage to the Soviet Union. A new generation of reconnaissance satellites could soon cover targets anywhere in the world. The satellites' resolution would be comparable to that of aircraft, but without the slightest political risk. Time was running out for the Tagboard.&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt;

Several more test flights, including two over [[China]], were made from [[Beale AFB]], California, in 1969 and 1970, to varying degrees of success. On 15 July 1971, Kelly Johnson received a wire canceling the D-21B program. The remaining drones were transferred by a C-5A and placed in dead storage. The tooling used to build the D-21Bs was ordered destroyed. Like the A-12 Oxcart, the D-21B Tagboard drones remained a Black airplane, even in retirement. Their existence was not suspected until August 1976, when the first group was placed in storage at the [[Davis-Monthan AFB]] [[Military Storage and Disposition Center]]. A second group arrived in 1977. They were labeled "GTD-21Bs" (GT stood for ground training).&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt;

Davis-Monthan is an open base, with public tours of the storage area at the time, so the odd-looking drones were soon spotted and photos began appearing in magazines. Speculation about the D-21Bs circulated within aviation circles for years, and it was not until 1982 that details of the Tagboard program were released. However, it was not until 1993 that the B-52/D-21B program was made public. That same year, the surviving D-21Bs were released to museums.&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], one of the missions carried out by the United States was the test and evaluation of captured [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] fighter aircraft. Beginning in the late 1960s, and for several decades, Area 51 played host to an assortment of Soviet-built aircraft. Under the HAVE DOUGHNUT, [[HAVE DRILL]] and HAVE FERRY programs, the first MiGs flown in the United States were used to evaluate the aircraft in performance, technical, and operational capabilities, pitting the types against U.S. fighters.&lt;ref name="Red Eagles"&gt;Steve Davies: "Red Eagles. America's Secret MiGs", Osprey Publishing, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

This was not a new mission, as testing of foreign technology by the USAF began during World War II. After the war, testing of acquired foreign technology was performed by the Air Technical Intelligence Center (ATIC, which became very influential during the Korean War), under the direct command of the Air Materiel Control Department. In 1961 ATIC became the Foreign Technology Division (FTD), and was reassigned to [[Air Force Systems Command]]. ATIC personnel were sent anywhere where foreign aircraft could be found.

The focus of [[Air Force Systems Command]] limited the use of the fighter as a tool with which to train the [[front line]] tactical fighter pilots.&lt;ref name="Red Eagles"/&gt; Air Force Systems Command recruited its pilots from the [[Air Force Flight Test Center]] at [[Edwards Air Force Base]], California, who were usually graduates from various test pilot schools. [[Tactical Air Command]] selected its pilots primarily from the ranks of the [[United States Air Force Weapons School|Weapons School]] graduates.&lt;ref name="Red Eagles"/&gt;

In August 1966, [[Iraqi Air Force]] fighter pilot Captain [[Munir Redfa]] [[List of Cold War pilot defections#Iraq|defected]], flying his [[MiG-21]] to [[Israel]] after being ordered to attack Iraqi Kurd villages with napalm. His aircraft was transferred to Groom Lake within a month to study. In 1968 the US Air Force and Navy jointly formed a project known as [[HAVE DOUGHNUT]] in which Air Force Systems Command, Tactical Air Command, and the U.S. Navy's Air Test and Evaluation Squadron Four (VX-4) flew this acquired Soviet made aircraft in simulated air combat training.&lt;ref name="Red Eagles"/&gt; Because U.S. possession of the Soviet MiG-21 was, itself, secret, it was tested at Groom Lake. A joint Air Force-Navy team was assembled for a series of dogfight tests.&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt;

Comparisons between the F-4 and the MiG-21 indicated that, on the surface, they were evenly matched. But air combat was not just about technology. In the final analysis, it was the skill of the man in the cockpit. The HAVE DOUGHNUT tests showed this most strongly. When the Navy or Air Force pilots flew the MiG-21, the results were a draw; the F-4 would win some fights, the MiG-21 would win others. There were no clear advantages. The problem was not with the planes, but with the pilots flying them. The pilots would not fly either plane to its limits. One of the Navy pilots was Marland W. "Doc" Townsend, then commander of VF-121, the F-4 training squadron at NAS Miramar. He was an engineer and a Korean War veteran and had flown almost every navy aircraft. When he flew against the MiG-21, he would outmaneuver it every time. The Air Force pilots would not go vertical in the MiG-21. The HAVE DOUGHNUT project officer was Tom Cassidy, a pilot with VX-4, the Navy's Air Development Squadron at Point Mugu. He had been watching as Townsend "waxed" the air force MiG-21 pilots. Cassidy climbed into the MiG-21 and went up against Townsend's F-4. This time the result was far different. Cassidy was willing to fight in the vertical, flying the plane to the point where it was buffeting, just above the stall. Cassidy was able to get on the F-4's tail. After the flight, they realized the MiG-21 turned better than the F-4 at lower speeds. The key was for the F-4 to keep its speed up. What had happened in the sky above Groom Lake was remarkable. An F-4 had defeated the MiG-21; the weakness of the Soviet plane had been found. Further test flights confirmed what was learned. It was also clear that the MiG-21 was a formidable enemy. United States pilots would have to fly much better than they had been to beat it. This would require a special school to teach advanced air combat techniques.&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt;

On 12 August 1968, two Syrian air force lieutenants, Walid Adham and Radfan Rifai, took off in a pair of [[MiG-17]]Fs on a training mission. They lost their way and, believing they were over Lebanon, landed at the [[Betzet]] Landing Field in northern Israel. (One version has it that they were led astray by an Arabic-speaking Israeli).&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt; Prior to the end of 1968 these MiG-17s were transferred from Israeli stocks and added to the Area 51 test fleet. The aircraft were given USAF designations and fake serial numbers so that they could be identified in DOD standard flight logs. As in the earlier program, a small group of Air Force and Navy pilots conducted mock dogfights with the MiG-17s. Selected instructors from the Navy's Top Gun school at [[NAS Miramar]], California, were chosen to fly against the MiGs for familiarization purposes. Very soon, the MiG-17's shortcomings became clear. It had an extremely simple, even crude, control system which lacked the power-boosted controls of American aircraft. The F-4's twin engines were so powerful it could accelerate out of range of the MiG-17's guns in thirty seconds. It was important for the F-4 to keep its distance from the MiG-17. As long as the F-4 was one and a half miles from the MiG-17, it was outside the reach of the Soviet fighter's guns, but the MiG was within reach of the F-4's missiles.&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt;

The data from the HAVE DOUGHNUT and HAVE DRILL tests were provided to the newly formed [[United States Navy Fighter Weapons School|Top Gun]] school at [[NAS Miramar]]. By 1970, the HAVE DRILL program was expanded; a few selected fleet F-4 crews were given the chance to fight the MiGs. The most important result of Project HAVE DRILL is that no Navy pilot who flew in the project defeated the MiG-17 Fresco in the first engagement. The HAVE DRILL dogfights were by invitation only. The other pilots based at Nellis Air Force Base were not to know about the U.S.-operated MiGs. To prevent any sightings, the airspace above the Groom Lake range was closed. On aeronautical maps, the exercise area was marked in red ink. The forbidden zone became known as "Red Square".&lt;ref name="Peebles"/&gt;

During the remainder of the Vietnam War, the Navy kill ratio climbed to 8.33 to 1. In contrast, the Air Force rate improved only slightly to 2.83 to 1. The reason for this difference was Top Gun. The Navy had revitalized its air combat training, while the Air Force had stayed stagnant. Most of the Navy MiG kills were by Top Gun graduates.{{Citation needed|date=May 2014}}

In May 1973, Project HAVE IDEA was formed which took over from the older HAVE DOUGHNUT, HAVE FERRY and HAVE DRILL projects and the project was transferred to the [[Tonopah Test Range Airport]]. At Tonopah testing of foreign technology aircraft continued and expanded throughout the 1970s and 1980s.&lt;ref name="Red Eagles"/&gt;

Area 51 also hosted another foreign materiel evaluation program called HAVE GLIB. This involved testing Soviet tracking and missile control radar systems. A complex of actual and replica Soviet-type threat systems began to grow around "Slater Lake", a mile northwest of the main base, along with an acquired Soviet "Barlock" search radar placed at [[Tonopah Air Force Station]]. They were arranged to simulate a Soviet-style air defense complex.

The Air Force began funding improvements to Area 51 in 1977 under project SCORE EVENT. In 1979, the CIA transferred jurisdiction of the Area 51 site to the Air Force Flight Test Center at Edwards AFB, California. Mr. Sam Mitchell, the last CIA commander of Area 51, relinquished command to USAF Lt. Col. Larry D. McClain.

===Have Blue/F-117 program===
{{Main|Lockheed Have Blue|Lockheed F-117 Nighthawk|Tonopah Test Range Airport}}
[[File:Have Blue bottom view.jpg|thumb|right|Underside view of ''Have Blue'']]
[[File:F-117 Nighthawk Front.jpg|thumb|right|F-117 flying over mountains]]
The [[Lockheed Have Blue]] prototype stealth fighter (a smaller proof-of-concept model of the [[F-117 Nighthawk]]) first flew at Groom in December 1977.&lt;ref name="rich_haveblue"&gt;Rich, pp. 56–60&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1978, the Air Force awarded a full-scale development contract for the F-117 to Lockheed Corporation's Advanced Development Projects. On 17 January 1981 the Lockheed test team at Area 51 accepted delivery of the first full Scale Development (FSD) prototype ''79–780'', designated YF-117A. At 6:05&amp;nbsp;am on 18 June 1981 Lockheed Skunk Works test pilot Hal Farley lifted the nose of YF-117A ''79–780''' off the runway of Area 51.&lt;ref name="F117hist"&gt;http://www.usafpatches.com/pubs/stealth.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, [[Tactical Air Command]] (TAC) decided to set up a group-level organization to guide the F-117A to an initial operating capability. That organization became the 4450th Tactical Group (Initially designated "A Unit"), which officially activated on 15 October 1979 at [[Nellis AFB]], Nevada, although the group was physically located at Area 51. The 4450th TG also operated the A-7D Corsair II as a surrogate trainer for the F-117A, and these operations continued until 15 October 1982 under the guise of an avionics test mission.&lt;ref name="F117hist"/&gt;

Flying squadrons of the 4450th TG were the 4450th Tactical Squadron (Initially designated "I Unit") activated on 11 June 1981, and 4451st Tactical Squadron (Initially designated "P Unit") on 15 January 1983. The 4450th TS, stationed at Area 51, was the first F-117A squadron, while the 4451st TS was stationed at Nellis AFB and was equipped with [[A-7D Corsair II]]s painted in a dark motif, tail coded "LV". Lockheed test pilots put the YF-117 through its early paces. A-7Ds was used for pilot training before any F-117A's had been delivered by Lockheed to Area 51, later the A-7D's were used for F-117A chase testing and other weapon tests at the Nellis Range.

15 October 1982 is important to the program because on that date Major Alton C. Whitley, Jr. became the first USAF 4450th TG pilot to fly the F-117A.&lt;ref name="F117hist"/&gt;

Although ideal for testing, Area 51 was not a suitable location for an operational group, so a new covert base had to be established for F-117 operations.&lt;ref name="F117Area51"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/Area51.html|title=Area 51 Test Site|publisher=F-117A|date=14 July 2003|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Tonopah Test Range Airport]] was selected for operations of the first USAF F-117 unit, the [[4450th Tactical Group]] (TG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/4450th.html|title=4450th TG|publisher=F-117A|date=1 April 2002|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; From October 1979, the Tonopah Airport base was reconstructed and expanded. The 6,000&amp;nbsp;ft runway was lengthened to 10,000&amp;nbsp;ft. Taxiways, a concrete apron, a large maintenance hangar, and a propane storage tank were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/Tonopah.html|title=Tonopah Test Range (TTR)|publisher=F-117A|date=14 July 2003|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By early 1982, four more YF-117As were operating at the southern end of the base, known as the "Southend" or "Baja Groom Lake". After finding a large scorpion in their offices, the testing team (Designated "R Unit") adopted it as their mascot and dubbed themselves the "Baja Scorpions". Testing of a series of ultra-secret prototypes continued at Area 51 until mid-1981, when testing transitioned to the initial production of F-117 stealth fighters. The F-117s were moved to and from Area 51 by C-5 during darkness to maintain security. The aircraft were defueled, disassembled, cradled, and then loaded aboard the C-5 at night, flown to Lockheed, and unloaded at night before reassembly and flight testing. Groom performed radar profiling, F-117 weapons testing, and training of the first group of frontline USAF F-117 pilots.

While the "Baja Scorpions" were working on the F-117, there was also another group at work in secrecy, known as "the Whalers" working on Tacit Blue.  A [[fly-by-wire]] technology demonstration aircraft with curved surfaces and composite material, to evade radar, it was a prototype, and never went into production.  Nevertheless, this strange-looking aircraft was responsible for many of the [[stealth technology]] advances that were used on several other aircraft designs, and had a direct influence on the B-2; with first flight of [[Tacit Blue]] being performed on 5 February 1982, by [[Northrop Grumman Corporation|Northrop Grumman]] test pilot, [[Richard G. Thomas]].

Production FSD airframes from Lockheed were shipped to Area 51 for acceptance testing. As the Baja Scorpions tested the aircraft with functional check flights and L.O. verification, the operational airplanes were then transferred to the 4450th TG.&lt;ref name="BScorpions"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.f-117a.com/Baja.html|title=JTF "Baja Scorpions" of Groom Lake|publisher=F-117A|date=14 July 2003|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 17 May 1982, the move of the 4450th TG from Groom Lake to Tonopah was initiated, with the final components of the move completed in early 1983. Production FSD airframes from Lockheed were shipped to Area 51 for acceptance testing. As the Baja Scorpions tested the aircraft with functional check flights and L.O. verification, the operational airplanes were then transferred to the 4450th TG at Tonopah.
&lt;ref name="BScorpions"/&gt;

The R-Unit was inactivated on 30 May 1989. Upon inactivation, the unit was reformed as Detachment 1, [[57th Fighter Weapons Wing]] (FWW). In 1990 the last F-117A (''843'') was delivered from Lockheed. After completion of acceptance flights at Area 51 of this last new F-117A aircraft, the flight test squadron continued flight test duties of refurbished aircraft after modifications by Lockheed. In February/March 1992 the test unit moved from Area 51 to the USAF Palmdale [[Plant 42]] and was integrated with the [[Air Force Systems Command]] [[6510th Test Squadron]]. Some testing, especially RCS verification and other classified activity was still conducted at Area 51 throughout the operational lifetime of the F-117. The recently inactivated (2008) [[410th Flight Test Squadron]] traces its roots, if not its formal lineage to the 4450th TG R-unit.

In 1994, five unnamed civilian contractors and the widows of contractors Walter Kasza and Robert Frost sued the [[United States Air Force|USAF]] and the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]. Their suit, in which they were represented by [[George Washington University]] law professor [[Jonathan Turley]], alleged they had been present when large quantities of unknown chemicals had been burned in open pits and trenches at Groom. [[biopsy|Biopsies]] taken from the complainants were analyzed by [[Rutgers University]] [[biochemistry|biochemists]], who found high levels of [[Polychlorinated dibenzodioxins|dioxin]], [[dibenzofuran]], and [[trichloroethylene]] in their body fat. The complainants alleged they had sustained skin, liver, and respiratory injuries due to their work at Groom, and that this had contributed to the deaths of Frost and Kasza. The suit sought compensation for the injuries they had sustained, claiming the USAF had illegally handled toxic materials, and that the EPA had failed in its duty to enforce the [[Resource Conservation and Recovery Act]] (which governs handling of dangerous materials). They also sought detailed information about the chemicals to which they were allegedly exposed, hoping this would facilitate the medical treatment of survivors. Congressman [[Lee H. Hamilton]], former chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, told ''[[60 Minutes]]'' reporter [[Lesley Stahl]], "The Air Force is classifying all information about Area 51 in order to protect themselves from a lawsuit."

Citing the [[State Secrets Privilege]], the government petitioned trial judge U.S. District Judge Philip Pro (of the [[United States District Court for the District of Nevada]] in Las Vegas) to disallow disclosure of classified documents or examination of secret witnesses, alleging this would expose classified information and threaten national security.&lt;ref name=lvrj_jun2002&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Jun-04-Tue-2002/news/18894771.html |title=Federal judges to hear case involving Area 51 |first=Keith |last=Rogers |deadurl=yes |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214093647/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2002/Jun-04-Tue-2002/news/18894771.html |archive-date=14 February 2010 |publisher=[[Las Vegas Review-Journal]] |date=4 June 2002 |accessdate=10 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When Judge Pro rejected the government's argument, [[Bill Clinton|President Bill Clinton]] issued a [[Presidential Determination]], exempting what it called, "The Air Force's Operating Location Near Groom Lake, Nevada" from environmental disclosure laws. Consequently, Pro dismissed the suit due to lack of evidence. Turley appealed to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]], on the grounds that the government was abusing its power to classify material. [[United States Secretary of the Air Force|Secretary of the Air Force]] [[Sheila E. Widnall]] filed a brief that stated that disclosures of the materials present in the air and water near Groom "can reveal military operational capabilities or the nature and scope of classified operations." The Ninth Circuit rejected Turley's appeal,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314151234/http://archive.ca9.uscourts.gov/coa/newopinions.nsf/77F9FB6C3552927E88256D05007AE266/$file/0016378.pdf?openelement|title=Wayback Machine|author=|date=14 March 2012|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the U.S. Supreme Court refused to hear it, putting an end to the complainants' case.

An unclassified memo on the safe handling of [[F-117 Nighthawk]] material was posted on an Air Force web site in 2005. This discussed the same materials for which the complainants had requested information (information the government had claimed was classified). The memo was removed shortly after journalists became aware of it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/May-21-Sun-2006/news/7488359.html |deadurl=yes |title=Warnings for emergency responders kept from Area 51 workers |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100214093550/http://www.reviewjournal.com/lvrj_home/2006/May-21-Sun-2006/news/7488359.html |archive-date=14 February 2010 |publisher=Las Vegas Review-Journal |date=21 May 2006 |accessdate=10 June 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Civil aviation identification==
In December 2007, airline pilots noticed that the base had appeared in their aircraft navigation systems' latest [[Jeppesen]] database revision with the [[ICAO]] airport identifier code of KXTA and listed as "Homey Airport".&lt;ref name="aopa-kxta-20080111"&gt;{{cite web|last=Marsh |first=Alton K. |url=http://www.aopa.org/aircraft/articles/2008/080110area51.html |title=Don't ask, don't tell: Area 51 gets airport identifier&amp;nbsp;— Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association |publisher=Aopa.org |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=10 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512063545/http://www.aopa.org/aircraft/articles/2008/080110area51.html |archivedate=12 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The probably inadvertent release of the airport data led to advice by the [[Aircraft Owners and Pilots Association]] (AOPA) that student pilots should be explicitly warned about KXTA, not to consider it as a waypoint or destination for any flight even though it now appears in public navigation databases.&lt;ref name="aopa-kxta-20080111"/&gt;

== Security==
[[File:Wfm x51 area51 warningsign.jpg|thumb|Area 51 border and warning sign stating that "photography is prohibited" and that "use of deadly force is authorized" under the terms of the 1950 [[McCarran Internal Security Act]]]]

The perimeter of the base is marked out by orange posts and patrolled by guards in white pickup trucks and camouflage fatigues. The guards are popularly referred to as “camo dudes” by enthusiasts. The guards will not answer questions about their employers; however, according to the [[New York Daily News]], there are indications they are employed through a contractor such as [[AECOM]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/camo-dudes-patrol-area-51-article-1.2828248|title=Here's what we know about the 'Cammo Dudes' who patrol Area 51|author=|date=|website=nydailynews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.area51.org/area-51-camo-dudes/|title=Area 51 Camo Dudes: Lethal Force Authorized — Area51|author=|date=9 January 2017|website=area51.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Signage around the base perimeter advises that deadly force is authorized against trespassers.&lt;ref name="Magazines2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Hearst Magazines|title=Popular Mechanics|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hdthT2uNftoC&amp;pg=PA142|date=April 2000|publisher=Hearst Magazines|pages=142–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology is also heavily used to maintain the border of the base; this includes CCTV cameras and motion detectors. Some of these motion detectors are placed some distance away from the base on public land to notify guards of people approaching.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/01/28/area_51_charges_dropped/|title=Area 51 'hacker' charges dropped|author=|date=|website=theregister.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1974 Skylab photography==
[[File:Groom Lake and Papoose Lake.jpg|thumb|[[Groom Lake (salt flat)|Groom Lake]] (upper left) and [[Papoose Lake]] (lower right). Photo by [[Doc Searles|Doc Searls]], 2010.]]

In January 2006, space historian [[Dwayne A. Day]] published an article in online aerospace magazine ''[[The Space Review]]'' titled "Astronauts and Area 51: the Skylab Incident". The article was based on a memo written in 1974 to [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] director [[William Colby]] by an unknown CIA official. The memo reported that astronauts on board [[Skylab 4]] had, as part of a larger program, inadvertently photographed a location of which the memo said:

{{quote|There were specific instructions not to do this. &lt;redacted&gt; was the only location which had such an instruction.}}

Although the name of the location was obscured, the context led Day to believe that the subject was Groom Lake. As Day noted:

{{quote|[I]n other words, the CIA considered no other spot on Earth to be as sensitive as Groom Lake.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/531/1|last=Day|first=Dwayne A.|title=Astronauts and Area 51: the Skylab Incident|authorlink=Dwayne A. Day|work=[[The Space Review]] (online)|date=9 January 2006|accessdate=2 April 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316181549/http://www.thespacereview.com/article/531/1|archivedate=16 March 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030916-4.html|title=Presidential Determination No. 2003–39|publisher=Georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov|date=16 September 2003|accessdate=10 June 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100510015728/http://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2003/09/20030916-4.html|archivedate=10 May 2010 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The memo details debate between federal agencies regarding whether the images should be classified, with [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] agencies arguing that it should, and [[NASA]] and the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] arguing against classification. The memo itself questions the legality of unclassified images to be retroactively classified.

Remarks on the memo,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/archive/531.pdf|title=CIA memo to DCI Colby|publisher=Hosted by The Space Review|accessdate =2 April 2006|format=PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060326030802/http://www.thespacereview.com/archive/531.pdf|archivedate=26 March 2006 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; handwritten apparently by DCI ([[Director of Central Intelligence]]) Colby himself, read:

{{quote|[Secretary of State [[Dean Rusk|Rusk]]] did raise it—said State Dept. people felt strongly. But he inclined leave decision to me (DCI)—I confessed some question over need to protect since:
# [[Soviet Union|USSR]] has it from own sats
# What really does it reveal?
# If exposed, don't we just say classified USAF work is done there?}}

The declassified documents do not disclose the outcome of discussions regarding the Skylab imagery. The behind-the-scenes debate proved moot as the photograph appeared in the [[Center for Earth Resources Observation and Science|Federal Government's Archive of Satellite Imagery]] along with the remaining Skylab 4 photographs, with no record of anyone noticing until Day identified it in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thespacereview.com/article/1010/1|last=Day|first=Dwayne A.|title=Secret Apollo|authorlink=Dwayne A. Day|work=The Space Review (online)|date=26 November 2007|accessdate=16 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other satellite imagery===
Other satellite imagery is also available, including images that show what appears to be [[F-16 Fighting Falcon]] aircraft stationed on the base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wikimapia.org/#lang=el&amp;lat=37.244866&amp;lon=-115.816364&amp;z=19&amp;m=b|title=Wikimapia&amp;nbsp;— Let's describe the whole world!|work=wikimapia.org|accessdate=24 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==UFO and other conspiracy theories==
Its secretive nature and undoubted connection to classified aircraft research, together with reports of unusual phenomena, have led Area 51 to become a focus of modern [[Unidentified flying object|UFO]] and other [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]]. Some of the activities mentioned in such theories at Area 51 include:&lt;ref name="jacobsen" /&gt;

* The storage, examination, and [[reverse engineering]] of crashed [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] spacecraft (including material supposedly recovered at [[Roswell UFO incident|Roswell]]), the study of their occupants (living and dead; see [[grey alien]]), and the manufacture of aircraft based on alien technology.
* Meetings or joint undertakings with extraterrestrials.
* The development of exotic [[Directed-energy weapon|energy weapon]]s for the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI) or other weapons programs.
* The development of means of [[weather control]].
* The development of [[time travel]] and [[teleportation]] technology.
* The development of unusual and exotic propulsion systems related to the [[Aurora (aircraft)|Aurora Program]].
* Activities related to a supposed shadowy [[New World Order (conspiracy theory)#Alien invasion|one world government]] or the [[Majestic 12]] organization.
Many of the hypotheses concern underground facilities at Groom or at [[Papoose Lake]] (also known as "S-4 location"), {{convert|8.5|mi|km}} south, and include claims of a transcontinental underground railroad system, a disappearing airstrip (nicknamed the "Cheshire Airstrip", after [[Lewis Carroll]]'s [[Cheshire cat]]) which briefly appears when water is sprayed onto its camouflaged asphalt,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.serve.com/mahood/nellis/area19/cheshire.htm|title=The Cheshire Airstrip|first=Tom|last=Mahood|date=October 1996|accessdate=2 April 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060316110233/http://www.serve.com/mahood/nellis/area19/cheshire.htm|archivedate=16 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; and engineering based on alien technology. Publicly available satellite imagery, however, reveals clearly visible landing strips at Groom Dry Lake, but not at Papoose Lake.

In the mid-1950s, civilian aircraft flew under 20,000 feet while military aircraft flew under 40,000 feet. Once the U-2 began flying at above 60,000 feet, an unexpected side effect was an increasing number of UFO sighting reports. Sightings occurred most often during early evenings hours, when airline pilots flying west saw the U-2's silver wings reflect the setting sun, giving the aircraft a "fiery" appearance. Many sighting reports came to the Air Force's [[Project Blue Book]], which investigated UFO sightings, through air-traffic controllers and letters to the government. The project checked U-2 and later OXCART flight records to eliminate the majority of UFO reports it received during the late 1950s and 1960s, although it could not reveal to the letter writers the truth behind what they saw.&lt;ref name="cia1992" /&gt;{{rp|72–73}} Similarly, veterans of experimental projects such as OXCART and [[NERVA]] at Area 51 agree that their work (including 2,850 OXCART test flights alone) inadvertently prompted many of the UFO sightings and other rumors:&lt;ref name="jacobsen"/&gt;
{{quote|The shape of OXCART was unprecedented, with its wide, disk-like fuselage designed to carry vast quantities of fuel. Commercial pilots cruising over Nevada at dusk would look up and see the bottom of OXCART whiz by at 2,000-plus mph. The aircraft's titanium body, moving as fast as a bullet, would reflect the sun's rays in a way that could make anyone think, ''UFO''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|last=Jacobsen|first=Annie|url=http://www.latimes.com/la-mag-april052009-backstory,0,786384.story|title=The Road to Area 51|work=Los Angeles Times|date=5 April 2009|accessdate=10 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

They believe that the rumors helped maintain secrecy over Area 51's actual operations.&lt;ref name="lacitis20100327"/&gt; While the veterans deny the existence of a vast underground railroad system, many of Area 51's operations did (and presumably still do) occur underground.&lt;ref name="jacobsen"/&gt;

Several people have claimed knowledge of events supporting Area 51 conspiracy theories. These have included [[Bob Lazar]], who claimed in 1989 that he had worked at Area 51's "Sector Four (S-4)", said to be located underground inside the [[Papoose Range]] near [[Papoose Lake]]. Lazar has stated he was contracted to work with alien spacecraft that the U.S. government had in its possession.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zamandayolculuk.com/cetinbal/s4sportmodel.htm|title=S4 Sport Model&amp;nbsp;– Cetin BAL&amp;nbsp;– GSM:+90 05366063183&amp;nbsp;– Turkey / Denizli|publisher=Zamandayolculuk.com|accessdate=10 June 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120530091951/http://www.zamandayolculuk.com/cetinbal/s4sportmodel.htm|archivedate=30 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the 1996 documentary ''Dreamland'' directed by [[Bruce Burgess]] included an interview with a 71-year-old mechanical engineer who claimed to be a former employee at Area 51 during the 1950s. His claims included that he had worked on a "flying disc simulator" which had been based on a disc originating from a crashed extraterrestrial craft and was used to train US pilots. He also claimed to have worked with an extraterrestrial being named "J-Rod" and described as a "telepathic translator".&lt;ref&gt;''Dreamland'', Transmedia and Dandelion Production for Sky Television (1996).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Dan Burisch (pseudonym of Dan Crain) claimed to have worked on cloning alien viruses at Area 51, also alongside the alien named "J-Rod". Burisch's scholarly credentials are the subject of much debate, as he was apparently working as a Las Vegas parole officer in 1989 while also earning a PhD at [[State University of New York]] (SUNY).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-11/|publisher=Committee for Skeptical Inquiry|work=Skeptical Inquirer|volume=28|issue=6|date=November–December 2004|first=Robert|last=Sheaffer|title=Tunguska 1, Roswell 0|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090313001822/http://www.csicop.org/si/2004-11/|archivedate=13 March 2009 |deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
&lt;!--Please don't list every single TV show/movie Area 51 is mentioned on or appears in. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list! Unless you have an example that is much, much, much better than those already here, don't insert it. Area 51 should be an important part of the story, not just a casual mention. (GTA: San Andreas' "Area 69" is a casual mention, for example.)--&gt;

Novels, films, television programs, and other fictional portrayals of Area 51 describe it—or a fictional counterpart—as a haven for [[extraterrestrials]], [[time travel]], and [[Conspiracy theory|sinister conspiracies]], often linking it with the [[Roswell UFO incident]].
*In the 1996 action film ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', the United States military uses alien technology captured at Roswell to attack the invading alien fleet from Area 51. The president of the United States dismissed the site's existence as a myth until the secretary of defense revealed it to him, at which point he questioned where the off-the-books funding comes from. In the 2016 sequel, ''[[Independence Day: Resurgence]]'', which takes place 20 years after the events of the first film, Area 51 has become the Space Defense Headquarters for Earth Space Defense (ESD).
*A novel, ''[[Area 51: The Dreamland Chronicles]]'', a non-fiction book about Area 51 in Nevada written by David Darlington in 1997.
*"[[Dreamland (The X-Files)|Dreamland]]" is a two part ''[[The X-Files]]'' episode set in and around Area 51 which involves [[Fox Mulder|Mulder]] swapping bodies with one of the bases employees.
*The 2015 film ''[[Area 51 (film)|Area 51]]'' is a [[mockumentary]] which depicts four individuals attempting to sneak into Area 51. 
*The "Hangar&amp;nbsp;51"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rinzler|first1=J.W.|last2=Bouzereau|first2=Laurent|title=The Complete Making of Indiana Jones|publisher=Ebury|location=London|year=2008|page=249|isbn=978-0-09-192661-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; government warehouse of the [[Indiana Jones (franchise)|''Indiana Jones'' films]] stores, among other exotic items, the [[Raiders of the Lost Ark|recovered]] [[Ark of the Covenant]] and an alien corpse from Roswell.
*In the television series ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'', Area 51 serves as a storage and testing facility for advanced weapon systems and aircraft/spacecraft designed using alien technology discovered after the Stargate was activated. The series states that prior to the Stargate's activation, rumors of alien technology or individuals existing at Area 51 were unfounded.
*The television series ''[[Seven Days (TV series)|Seven Days]]'' takes place inside Area&amp;nbsp;51, with the base containing a covert [[National Security Agency|NSA]] [[time travel]] operation using alien technology recovered from Roswell.
*The 1995 arcade game ''[[Area 51 (1995 video game)|Area 51]]'' is a [[light gun]] shooter set within the base.  The player has to defeat alien Kronn and zombie personnel in order to arm the base nuclear self-destruct and prevent further infestation.
*The 2005 video game ''[[Area 51 (2005 video game)|Area 51]]'' is set in the base, and mentions the Roswell and [[Moon landing conspiracy theories|moon landing hoax]] conspiracy theories.
*[[Bob Mayer (author)|Bob Mayer]]'s Area 51 novel series (originally written under his pen name, Robert Doherty) is set on the base, and [[Operation Highjump]] is said to have been a cover for an expedition to excavate [[flying saucer]]s buried under Antarctica's ice shelf by long-ago extraterrestrial visitors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title= Area 51 ''(Area 51 #1)''|author=Doherty, Robert |publisher= Mass Market Paperback|date= 10 February 1997|isbn= 9780440220732}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The 2010 video game ''[[Call of Duty: Black Ops]]'' features a DLC zombies level 'Moon' in which part of the level is set in 'Hanger 18' in Area 51. 'Hanger 18' is also a multiplayer map again based in Area 51.
*The 2000 video games ''[[Deus Ex (video game)|Deus Ex]]'' and ''[[Perfect Dark]]'' feature Area 51.
* Episode 7 of [[Archer (season 6)|season 6]] of the TV series ''[[Archer (2009 TV series)|Archer]]'', titled "Nellis", is set in Area 51, where Pam and Krieger encounter extraterrestrials. However, Area 51 is fictionalized as part of nearby [[Nellis Air Force Base]], rather than being part of Edwards Air Force Base.

The '''Black Guerilla Family''', or '''BGF''' (also known as the '''Black Family''' or the '''Black Vanguard''') is an African-American [[Prison gang|prison]] and [[gang|street gang]] founded in 1966 by [[George Jackson (Black Panther)|George Jackson]], George “Big Jake” Lewis, and W. L. Nolen while they were incarcerated at [[San Quentin State Prison]] in [[Marin County, California]].

==Philosophy and goals==
{{Black Power sidebar}}
Inspired by [[Marcus Garvey]], the Black Guerilla Family (BGF) was characterized as an ideological [[African-American]] [[Marxism-Leninism|Marxist Leninist]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=QXpejAPTqH0C&amp;pg=PA136&amp;lpg=PA136&amp;dq=black+guerrilla+family+marxist#v=onepage&amp;q=black%20guerrilla%20family%20marxist&amp;f=false |title=The Rise and Fall of California's Radical Prison Movement |last=Cummins |first=Eric |date=1994 |publisher=Stanford University Press |isbn=9780804722322 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; revolutionary organization composed of prisoners. It was founded with the stated goals of eradicating [[racism]], maintaining dignity in prison, and overthrowing the [[United States government]].

==History==
The Black Guerrilla Family was founded by George Jackson in San Quentin State Prison during the [[Black Power movement]]. The group later became a recognizable [[organized crime]] force in the United States.

===Huey P. Newton murder===
On August 22, 1989, co-founder and leader of the [[Black Panther Party for Self Defense]], [[Huey P. Newton]] was fatally shot outside 1456 9th St in [[West Oakland]] by 24-year-old Black Guerilla Family member, Tyrone Robinson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Suspect Admits Shooting Newton, Police Say |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1989/08/27/us/suspect-admits-shooting-newton-police-say.html |quote=The police said late Friday that an admitted drug dealer had acknowledged killing Huey P. Newton, co-founder of the Black Panther Party |agency=Associated Press |work=The New York Times |date=August 27, 1989 |accessdate=May 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Relations between Newton and factions within the Black Guerilla Family had been strained for nearly two decades. Former [[Black Panther Party]] members who became BGF members in jail had become disenchanted with Newton for his perceived abandonment of imprisoned Black Panther members and allegations of Newton's [[fratricide]] within the party. In his book, ''Shadow of the Panther'', Hugh Pearson alleges that Newton was addicted to crack cocaine, and his extortion of local BGF drug dealers to obtain free drugs added to their animosity.&lt;ref&gt;Hugh Pearson, Shadow of the Panther. p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

Robinson was convicted of the murder in August 1991 and sentenced to 32 years for the crime.&lt;ref&gt;''Los Angeles Times'', 10-10-91, pA22; 12-5-91, pA19.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fay Stender attempted murder===
In 1979, former BGF lawyer [[Fay Stender]] was shot five times by recently paroled Black Guerilla Family member Edward Glenn Brooks, for what Brooks said was Stender’s betrayal of George Jackson. Brooks forced Stender to state: "I, Fay Stender, admit I betrayed George Jackson and the prison movement when they needed me most" just before he shot her.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Diana |last=Russell |url=http://www.ontheissuesmagazine.com/1991spring/Russell_spring1991.php |title=Fay Stender and the Politics of Murder |work=On The Issues Magazine |date=Spring 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stender was left paralyzed below the waist and in constant pain by the assault and committed suicide in Hong Kong shortly after she testified against Brooks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |authorlink1=David Horowitz |first1=David |last1=Horowitz |authorlink2=Peter Collier (political author) |first2=Peter |last2=Collier |title=Requiem for a Radical |work=New West |year=1981}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Baltimore unrest===
{{Main|2015 Baltimore protests}}
Baltimore police stated that the Black Guerrilla Family, the [[Bloods]], and the [[Crips]] were "teaming up" to target police officers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/crime/blog/bs-md-ci-freddie-gray-gang-threat-20150427-story.html|title=Baltimore police say gangs 'teaming up' to take out officers|date=April 27, 2015|work=The Baltimore Sun|accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, however, leaders of both the Bloods and the Crips denied the allegations,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Porter|first1=Tom|title=Bloods and Crips gangs reject claims of kill-a-cop pact|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/baltimore-riots-bloods-crips-gangs-reject-claims-kill-cop-pact-1498790|accessdate=April 29, 2015|work=International Business Times|date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; released a video statement asking for calm and peaceful protest in the area,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gangs call for calm in Baltimore|url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/baltimore-riots/bal-video-gangs-call-for-calm-in-baltimore-20150427-premiumvideo.html|accessdate=April 29, 2015|work=The Baltimore Sun|date=April 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and joined with police and clergy to enforce the curfew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Berman|first1=John|last2=Castillo|first2=Mariano|title=Baltimore gangs will help enforce curfew|url=http://cnnuslive.cnn.com/Event/Baltimore_Riot/160923728|accessdate=April 29, 2015|publisher=CNN|date=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; At one occasion, gang members helped to prevent a riot at the [[Security Square Mall]] by dispersing attempted rioters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.wusa9.com/story/news/local/maryland/2015/04/28/gang-members-help-prevent-riot-baltimore-mall/26534797/ | title=Gang members help prevent riot at Baltimore mall | publisher=WUSA | date=April 28, 2015 | accessdate=April 29, 2015 | first=Garrett W |last=Haake}}&lt;/ref&gt; On other occasions, rival gang members helped each other to protect black-owned businesses, black children, and reporters, diverting rioters to Chinese- and Arab-owned businesses instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/04/28/us/amid-violence-factions-and-messages-converge-in-a-weary-and-unsettled-baltimore.html| title=Amid Violence, Factions and Messages Converge in a Weary and Unsettled Baltimore | work=The New York Times | date=April 27, 2015 | accessdate=April 30, 2015 | first=Ron |last=Nixon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12688">The '''Böckenförde Dilemma''' ({{lang-de|[https://de.wikipedia.org/wiki/B%C3%B6ckenf%C3%B6rde-Diktum Böckenförde-Diktum]}}) is a problem ([[dilemma]]), which claims that in secular states there are obstacles to creation of [[social capital]].

The dilemma is named after German [[Federal Constitutional Court of Germany|constitutional judge]] [[Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde]].

== Content ==

Böckenförde wrote that:

{{quote|''The liberal (German "freiheitlich"),&lt;ref&gt;Or "freedom-oriented." The likeliest English equivalents of ''freiheitlich'', "liberal" and "libertarian," carry connotations beyond the  German. While "libertarian" (in American usage) refers to a current political persuasion,  "liberal" in the sense of "political liberalism" has a longer history in political thought, so it is less bound to current political usage.&lt;/ref&gt; secularized state lives by prerequisites which it cannot guarantee itself.'' This is the great adventure it has undertaken for freedom's sake. As a liberal state it can only endure if the freedom it bestows on its citizens takes some regulation from the interior, both from a moral substance of the individuals and a certain homogeneity of society at large. On the other hand, it cannot by itself procure these interior forces of regulation, that is not with its own means such as legal compulsion and authoritative decree. Doing so, it would surrender its liberal character (freiheitlichkeit) and fall back, in a secular manner, into the claim of totality it once led the way out of, back then in the [[Thirty Years War|confessional civil wars]].|[[Ernst-Wolfgang Böckenförde]]|''Staat, Gesellschaft, Freiheit''. 1976, S. 60.}}

In a [[feudalism|feudal]] state the king represents the ultimate power based on the [[Divine Right of Kings|divine right]] doctrine, the legitimacy of king's rule is transcendentally justified. In a [[republic]] there is no generally valid notion of [[sovereignty|sovereign]], although in theory the people have sovereignty ([[popular sovereignty]]). But according to constitution the people hand over to some extent their sovereignty or government authority to state leaders and parliaments. In election coverage formulations like "the sovereign has decided" are used. The Böckenförde Dilemma alludes to the fact that in a democracy the legitimacy of the government is justified "from below" in contrast to [[absolute monarchy|absolutism]]. While the absolutist state demands loyalty from its citizens and through this loyalty can exercise its rule, the democratic state relies on democratic convictions of its citizens and can not enforce those convictions itself.

This leads to difficulties in answering the question of how a democratically constituted society can secure its survival and defend itself against threats. Böckenförde draws attention to the paradox that the state in the attempt to defend democracy with "the means of legal coercion and decrees from authority" would itself become a [[dictatorship]] because it would infringe upon the idea of people as sovereign.

Gerhard Czermak writes that Böckenförde is "fundamentally misunderstood when not instrumentalized" when it is concluded from his dilemma that "the state should promote churches and religious communities as sources of virtue in particular... He (Böckenförde) speaks of adventure and points to very different forces acting in society. He means that all groups with their own, also moral, worldview contribute to integration of a part of society."“&lt;ref&gt;Gerhard Czermak: ''Religions- und Weltanschauungsrecht''. S. 36, Absatz 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

In two interviews in 2009 and 2010 Böckenförde answered the critique that he had exaggerated the ethical force of religion: "This criticism misses the context in which I made this statement in 1964. Back then I was trying to explain to Catholics the origin of the secular, that is worldly, no longer religious state and dissolve their scepticism of it. This had happened before 1965 when at the end of the [[Second Vatican Council]] the Roman Catholic Church for the first time completely recognized the concept of religious freedom. In the face of this scepticism I urged Catholics to accept this state and engage in it, among other things with the argument that the state has to rely on their ethical shaping force."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taz.de/1/archiv/print-archiv/printressorts/digi-artikel/?ressort=sw&amp;dig=2009/09/23/a0090&amp;cHash=21e4e4c527 "Freiheit ist ansteckend" (Freedom is contagious)], [[die tageszeitung]], 23 September 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010 Böckenförde clarified it as follows: "To conceive of such a state the liberal order needs a unifying ethos, a "sense of community" among those who live in this state. The question then becomes: what is creating this ethos, which can neither be enforced by the state nor compelled by a sovereign? One can say: first the common culture. But what are the elements and factors of that culture? Then indeed we are dealing with its sources such as Christianity, Enlightenment and humanism. But not automatically any religion."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fr-online.de/kultur/debatte/-freiheit-ist-ansteckend-/-/1473340/4795176/-/index.html „Freiheit ist ansteckend“] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101104053317/http://www.fr-online.de/kultur/debatte/-freiheit-ist-ansteckend-/-/1473340/4795176/-/index.html# |date=2010-11-04 }}, [[Frankfurter Rundschau]], 1. November 2010 online, 2. November 2010, S. 32f&lt;/ref&gt;

A secular version of this thought one can find already in Aristotle: that the virtue of a state is founded on the virtue of its citizens and that it rests on their disposition, habit and reason - which is also reflected in the famous quote of [[Joseph de Maistre]] that every nation gets the government it deserves. Therefore political education becomes a necessary condition for existence and an essential task (however hard it is to ensure institutionally) of the good political order.&lt;ref&gt;[[Aristotle]], ''Politics''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Reinhold Zippelius, ''Recht und Gerechtigkeit in der offenen Gesellschaft'', 2. Aufl., 1996, S. 149 ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Criticism ==

In this context the debate over changing values is worth noting. In the tradition of [[cultural pessimism]]  [[Elisabeth Noelle-Neumann]] believes that since the 60's an uninterrupted decline in values has taken place. The erosion of "civic virtues" such as sense of community and pride in work as well as declining attendance in churches and shrinking religious engagement have been noted as symptoms. According to [[Helmut Klages]] instead of a decay of values what is happening is a synthesis of old and new values. [[Ronald Inglehart]] postulates a change from material to non-material values that will ultimately strengthen democracy: he believes more cooperation and more freedom will result from this change.

[[Gerhard Himmelman]] points out that the sociologists countered the debate about a decline in values with the argument that "the modern social regulatory mechanisms and the democratic procedures serve as foundations of social integration". Instead of appealing, among other things, to the [[communitarianism]], the public discourse, the [[The Theory of Communicative Action|communication free from domination]] ([[Jürgen Habermas]]) creates out of itself ("Selbstschöpfungsprozess") the values and behaviors (democratic virtues), that the liberal state needs to exist and survive. Jürgen Habermas also sees a risk that runaway modernization of society undermines the democratic layer and destroys the kind of solidarity on which the democratic state relies, without being able to enforce it legally,&lt;ref&gt;Florian Fleischmann: [http://perspektive89.com/2006/05/14/wasserlos_waschen_auf_welkem_gras_zur_habermas_ratzinger_debatte ''Wasserlos waschen auf welkem Gras – zur Habermas-Ratzinger-Debatte''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080109034426/http://www.perspektive89.com/2006/05/14/wasserlos_waschen_auf_welkem_gras_zur_habermas_ratzinger_debatte# |date=2008-01-09 }}(In German). In: ''perspektive89.com'', 14 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

Michael Haus also rejects the Böckenförde thesis as unfounded. From Böckenförde's premise that the modern democratic state was created under the influence of the Christian religion, it does not necessarily follow that the society of ''today'' is dependent on religion as a foundation. Instead a civic consensus could also rest on binding commonalities such as shared interests, interdependencies, dependencies, opportunities for cooperation, a common history or common historical lessons.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Haus: ''Ort und Funktion der Religion in der zeitgenössischen Demokratietheorie''. In: Michael Minkenberg (Hrsg.): ''Politik und Religion''. Wiesbaden 2003, S. 49f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Axel Montenbruck follows Böckenförde's approach. But answering Böckenförde's call for "binding ethos" Montenbruck introduces the western secular ideas of [[civil religion]] that goes back to [[Rousseau]]: "The solution to this dilemma can only be found on an even higher level, such as that of the preambles. The people needs to create aside from the state also its own  "substitute religion of internalized values and principles", to which it must then submit. Indeed, the nations possess these "substitute religions" as evidenced by preambles to their constitutions etc. But they find an understandable difficulty speaking again of religion, even if only of civil religion."&lt;ref&gt;Axel Montenbruck: ''Zivilreligion. Eine Rechtsphilosophie I. Grundlegung: Westlicher "demokratischer Präambel-Humanismus" und universelle Trias "Natur, Seele und Vernunft"'', 3. erheblich erweiterte Auflage, 2011, 175, Universitätsbibliothek der Freien Universität Berlin ([http://edocs.fu-berlin.de/docs/servlets/MCRFileNodeServlet/FUDOCS_derivate_000000001739/Zivilreligion_I_3_Auflage_2011.pdf?hosts= open access])&lt;/ref&gt;

== Effect ==
Since the 1990s, this idea has been taken up and modified by Paul Kirchhof and related to demographic developments.

The Böckenförde dilemma stands at the "center of liberal conservatism".&lt;ref&gt;Ulrich Bielefeld: [http://hsozkult.geschichte.hu-berlin.de/rezensionen/2007-2-143 ''Rezension zu: Hacke, Jens A.: Philosophie der Bürgerlichkeit.

The '''Cambridge Buddhist Association''' was informally founded in 1957 when [[D.T. Suzuki]] moved to [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]] and befriended John and Elsie Mitchell, who ran a vast library of books on [[Buddhism]] and held [[zazen]] for various practitioners. The institution was incorporated in 1959 and remains active. In 1979 [[Maurine Stuart]], a [[Rinzai]] [[rōshi]], became President of the organization, and several influential Buddhist teachers in the [[United States]] have been members.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor, 197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ford, 110&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cambridge Buddhist Association ceased to offer a place of practice in September 2011, when the property that housed the Zendo was sold.

A total of 11 verses of the Sangam literature have been attributed to Satthanar, including verse 10 of the [[Tiruvalluva Maalai]].&lt;ref name="Vedanayagam_Urai"&gt;{{cite book

==Etymology==
Pronounced ''Sa-tha-naar,'' the name is derived from ({{lang-ta|சாத்து}}, ''sāttu'') meaning Buddhist monk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cō. Na Kantacāmi|title=Buddhism as Expounded in Manimekalai|date=1978|publisher=Annamalai University|page=393|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=a-QHVNeXHMn17AaNjoGIBA&amp;id=U2cOAAAAYAAJ&amp;dq=cattan+manimekalai&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=cattu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Applying this principle to the name Maturai Kulavāṇikan Cāttan, the author of Manimekalai, we see that the two appellations Maturai and Kulavanikan were prefixed to his name in order to distinguish him from another poet of Maturai with the same name and from a third who lived elsewhere. Several examples could be cited of this system of nomenclature which prevailed during the early days.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=University of Ceylon Review|date=1948|page=97|edition=Volumes 6-8|url=https://www.google.co.uk/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=cattan+manimekalai&amp;=&amp;gws_rd=ssl#hl=en&amp;tbm=bks&amp;q=%22another+poet+of+Maturai+with+the+same%22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Satthanar hailed from a place known as Seerthandalai, later came to be known as Seethalai.&lt;ref name="Vedanayagam_Urai"/&gt; He was a grain merchant at [[Madurai]] and hence came to be called "Koolavanigan". He was a contemporary of [[Cheran Senguttuvan]] and was believed to have practiced [[Buddhism]]. He was sung in praise of the [[Pandyan dynasty|Pandyan king]] Chittira Maadatthu Thunjiya Nanmaran in the Sangam work of [[Purananuru]].&lt;ref name="SangaIlakkiyam_3"&gt;{{cite book

Vaiyapuri Pillai sees him along with [[Ilango Adigal]] as developing two divergent strands of the ''Chilampu'' legend that forms the basis for both [[Cilapatikaram]] and [[Manimekalai]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Journal of the Institute of Asian Studies|date=1991|publisher=Institute of Asian Studies|page=35|edition=Volume 9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EjptAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22cilampu+story%22&amp;dq=%22cilampu+story%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=dO8HVPWOOMjaaur-grAI&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He is seen as an expert in both orthodox and heterodox systems of Indian philosophy and as an advocate of Buddhist philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Tamil Studies|date=1984|publisher=International Institute of Tamil Historical Studies|edition=Volume 4|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=auoHVL3TD--I7AbVqIEg&amp;id=uCDjAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=cattan+cool+tamil&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=cattan+expert}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It is seen that Maṇimekhalai was written after the Tirukkural was composed, because there are two verses from the [[Tirukkural]] quoted in [[Manimekalai]].&lt;ref&gt;Hisselle Dhammaratana,''Buddhism in South India'', Buddhist Publication Society, Kandy, 1964.

Available at www.archive.org [https://archive.org/details/manimekhalaiinit031176mbp]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Contribution to the Sangam literature==
Satthanar composed the [[Manimekalai]] and has authored 11 Sangam verses, including 3 in [[Natrinai]], 5 in [[Agananuru]], and 1 each in [[Kurunthogai]], [[Purananuru]], and [[Tiruvalluva Maalai]].&lt;ref name="SangaIlakkiyam_3"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2726">'''Christian interpolation''' is a subsidiary category of [[Interpolation (manuscripts)|scribal interpolation in manuscript transmission]]. In [[textual criticism]] the term generally refers to the specific phenomena of textual insertion and textual damage to Jewish sources text during Christian scribal transmission, but may also refer to possible interpolation in secular Roman texts, such as the case of [[Tacitus on Christ]].

==Josephus==
{{main|Josephus on Jesus}}
Notable disputed examples in the works of [[Josephus]] include Josephus' sections on [[John the Baptist]], which is widely accepted,&lt;ref&gt;John the Baptizer and Prophet: A Sociohistorical Study - Page 39 1597529869 Robert L. Webb - 2006 "2.3 The Authenticity of Ant. 18.116-19 The authenticity of Josephus' narrative concerning John the Baptist has often been critically examined. While a few have rejected it as a Christian interpolation, most schoLars have accepted it."&lt;/ref&gt; and on [[Jesus of Nazareth]], which is widely regarded as at best damaged.&lt;ref&gt; Josephus: The Essential Writings - Page 265  Paul L. Maier - 1990 "scholars have long suspected a Christian interpolation, since Josephus would not have believed Jesus to be the ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Old Testament pseudepigrapha==
Notable examples among the body of texts known as [[List of Old Testament pseudepigrapha|Old Testament pseudepigrapha]] include the disputed authenticity of [[Similitudes of Enoch]] and [[4 Ezra]] which in the form transmitted by Christian scribal traditions contain arguably later Christian understanding of terms such as [[Son of Man]].&lt;ref&gt;G. Nickelsburg, “Son of Man.“ in [[Anchor Bible Dictionary]] 6.138.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Enoch-Metatron Tradition - Page 82 3161485440 Andrei A. Orlov - 2005 "The same interchangeability is observable in the titles “son of man“ and “chosen one.” Here ... 88 Some scholars believe that these chapters might represent later interpolation(s) and do not '83 G. Nickelsburg, “Son of Man.“ ABD 6.138."&lt;/ref&gt; Other texts suffering significant Christian interpolation include the [[Testaments of the Twelve Patriarchs]],&lt;ref&gt; The Lamb Christology of the Apocalypse of John Page 87 316148164X Loren L. Johns - 2003 " 2.2 Testament of Benjamin 3:8 The same sort of Christian interpolation is evident in Testament of Benjamin 3:8, where, according to Howard Clark Kee, "the major text traditions include a Christian interpolation."53"&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Sibylline Oracles]] and so on.

'''''Critici sacri''''' was a compilation of Latin biblical commentaries published in London from 1660, edited by [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]]. The publisher was Cornelius Bee.  The work appeared in nine volumes, and collected numerous authors, both Protestant and Catholic, of [[early modern]] critical work on the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=22518|title=Poole, Matthew |first= Nicholas |last=Keene}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was intended to complement [[Brian Walton (bishop)|Brian Walton]]'s ''[[Polyglot Bible]]'', and set off a series of subsequent related publications.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://www.ccel.org/ccel/schaff/encyc03/Page_306.html | title = New Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious Knowledge | volume = III: Chamier – Draendorf | publisher = Christian Classics Ethereal Library | accessdate = 2011-06-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The original work, while influential (particularly in making the notes of [[Grotius]] widely available),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first =Magne | last = Saebo |title=Hebrew Bible/Old Testament: The History of Its Interpretation: from the Renaissance to the Enlightenment |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=OMlT-FViF40C&amp;pg=PA876 |accessdate=15 June 2011 |year= 2008 |publisher= Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |isbn=978-3-525-53982-8 |pages= 876–}}&lt;/ref&gt; was not a connected Bible commentary, and was found to be long-winded, as well as scanty in other parts. Later publications attempted to address these shortcomings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Samuel Thomas | last = Bloomfield |author-link = Samuel Thomas Bloomfield |title=Hē kainē diathēkē: the Greek Testament with English notes, critical, philological, and exegetical, partly selected and arranged from the best commentators, ancient and modern, but chiefly original; The whole being especially adapted to the use of academical students, candidates for the sacred office, and ministers |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uSFMAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PR9 |accessdate=15 June 2011 |year= 1837 |publisher=Perkins &amp; Marvin |pages=9–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Critici sacri'' (1660)==
The original full title was ''Critici Sacri, sive Doctissimorum Virorum in SS. Biblia Annotationes et Tractatus'', and it appeared in nine volumes starting in 1660. The commentary project was launched by Cornelius Bee, with the main editor being [[John Pearson (bishop)|John Pearson]], supported by [[Anthony Scattergood]] and [[Francis Gouldman]], as well as Pearson's brother Richard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Scattergood, Antony}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bee was a bookseller in [[Little Britain, London]].  He suffered major losses in the 1666 [[Great Fire of London|Great Fire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = https://archive.org/stream/adictionarybook00plomgoog#page/n48/mode/2up | title = A Dictionary of the Booksellers and Printers who Were at Work in England, Scotland and Ireland | publisher = Archive | accessdate = 2011-06-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==''Synopsis criticorum'' (from 1669)==
The ''Synopsis criticorum'' was a work by [[Matthew Poole]], in five volumes, condensing the ''Critici sacri'', and adding further authors. There was a 1684 edition by [[Johann Leusden]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge | place = Great Britain |title= Penny cyclopaedia of the Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=sMxPAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA452 |accessdate= 15 June 2011 |year= 1839 |publisher= C. Knight |pages=452–}}&lt;/ref&gt; also editions by J. H. Maius (1679), and J. G. Pritz (Pritius) (1712).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first1=George | last1 = Watson | first2=Ian Roy | last2 = Willison |title=The new Cambridge bibliography of English literature |url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GwFJe0eFWMQC&amp;pg=RA5-PA1883 |accessdate= 15 June 2011 |year= 1971 |publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-20004-2 |pages= 5–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There had already been a pioneer complete Bible commentary in English, the ''Annotations upon all the Books of the Old and New Testament'' sponsored by the [[Westminster Assembly]].{{Sfn | Horne | 1836 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=pMUVAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PA108  1–]}}  Prompted by [[William Lloyd (bishop of Worcester)|William Lloyd]], Poole began his compilation in 1666. The prospectus of Poole's work bore the names of eight bishops (headed by Morley and Hacket) and five continental scholars, besides other divines. [[Simon Patrick]], [[John Tillotson]], and [[Edward Stillingfleet]], with four laymen, acted as trustees of the subscription money.  A patent for the work was obtained on 14 October 1667.&lt;ref name= Poole&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Poole, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Poole had assistance from [[John Lightfoot]] and [[Matthew Robinson (clergyman)|Matthew Robinson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb |id= 16648|title=Lightfoot, John|first=Newton E.|last= Key}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id= 23859|title= Robinson, Matthew |first= Andrew J.|last= Hopper}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first volume was ready for the press, when difficulties were raised by Cornelius Bee, who accused Poole of invading his own patent. After pamphlets had been written and legal opinions taken, the matter was referred to [[Henry Pierrepont, 1st Marquess of Dorchester]], and [[Arthur Annesley, 1st Earl of Anglesey]], who decided in Poole's favour;  Bee's name appears (1669) among the publishers of the ''Synopsis''. The style was crisp notes, including [[rabbinical]] sources and Roman Catholic commentators.&lt;ref name=Poole/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | url = http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=njp.32101079836837;page=root;view=image;size=100;seq=10 | publisher = HathiTrust Digital Library | title = Synopsis criticorum aliorumque Sacrae Scripturae | volume = 2 | work = Babel Babel |access-date= 2011-06-15}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daniel Simon Mills''', [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons|FRCVS]] (born 21 Aug 1966) is an [[England|English]] [[biology|biologist]] and the UK's first Professor of Veterinary Behavioural Medicine based at the [[University of Lincoln]], United Kingdom. He attended [[St Edmund's College, Ware]] before studying at the [[University of Bristol]] where he received his [[Bachelor of Veterinary Science|BVSc]] degree and completed his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] degree in [[ethology|animal behaviour]] from [[De Montfort University]]. After some time spent in general practice, he became a Lecturer, Senior Lecturer and Principal Lecturer in animal behaviour at De Montfort University, and subsequently the [[University of Lincoln]], where he has been Head of the Department of Biological Sciences. His research has focused on the assessment of emotion in companion animals and the use of semiochemicals to manage their problem behaviour (pheromonatherapy). 

Among his achievements are becoming the first person within the UK to be recognized as a specialist in veterinary behavioural medicine by the [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shootingstar-pr.co.uk/index.php?page=professor-daniel-mills-for-companian-animal-behaviour  UK's first specialist in veterinary behavioural medicine] Accessed 15 Nov 2010&lt;/ref&gt; He is also a member of the [[Companion Animal Welfare Council]].

'''Desmond M. Clarke''' (17 January 1942 – 17 September 2016) was an author and professor of philosophy at [[University College Cork]], in [[Cork (city)|Cork]], Ireland. His research interests lay predominantly in the 17th century, on such topics as the history of philosophy and theories of science - with a specific interest in the writings of [[René Descartes]], as well as contemporary church/state relations, human rights, and nationalism. He was co-editor of the Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy series, and he has translated and written an introduction for the [[penguin books|Penguin]] edition of Descartes' ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''.   He retired from his position as Professor of Philosophy in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ucc.ie/en/philosophy/People/formerstaff/clarke/|title=Desmond Clarke staff page at UCC|publisher=University College Cork|accessdate=2011-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Clarke was the founder and a general editor of ''Cambridge Texts in the History of Philosophy'' – 76 volumes have been published with new translations of non-English texts from ancient Greek, Latin, Arabic, Hebrew, French, Italian and German.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5921">'''Edmundo O'Gorman O'Gorman''' (24 November 1906 in [[Mexico City]] &amp;ndash; 28 September 1995 in Mexico City) was a [[Mexico|Mexican]] writer, historian and philosopher. He is considered as being among the earlier and most influential applicants of [[historical revisionism]] to commonly held narratives regarding the Spanish colonial period in Latin America.

==Early life and education==
O'Gorman was born in Coyoacán, in the southern part of Mexico City. He was the son of painter and [[mining engineer]] Cecil Crawford O'Gorman, an Irishman who [[Irish immigration to Mexico|emigrated to Mexico]] in 1895, and the great-great-nephew of the first British consul to Mexico City, Charles O'Gorman, who later married a Mexican citizen. He was the younger brother of celebrated architect and painter [[Juan O'Gorman]].

He graduated with a degree in [[Law degree|Law]] (1928) from the [[Escuela Libre de Derecho]]. In 1940 he began lecturing in the [[Philosophy]] faculty of the Mexico City College. In 1948 he obtained a Masters in [[Philosophy]] and in 1951 he completed his doctorate in [[History]] with ''summa cum laude'' honorific distinction from the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]] (UNAM). While at UNAM, he was at the university's Faculty of Philosophy and Letters, and a researcher at the university's Institute of Historical Research. During his time at UNAM, O'Gorman met and developed relationships  with distinguished Mexican intellectuals and Spanish refugees, such as [[José Gaos]], who would greatly influence his later works.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://letraslibres.com/pdf/11516.pdf|title=Matute, A. La genealogía de un historiológo.|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713202137/http://letraslibres.com/pdf/11516.pdf|archivedate=2011-07-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

O'Gorman also lectured at the Universidad Iberoamericana.

==Career==
Between 1938 and 1952, O'Gorman worked for the Mexican [[General National Archive (Mexico)|General National Archive]]. He became a member of the [[Mexican Academy of the Spanish Language]] in 1969 and the [[Mexican Academy of the Corresponding History of the Real of Madrid]],{{clarify|date=September 2012}} corporation of which he became of director of from 1972 to 1987.

He resigned after disagreements over concepts such as the "discovery of America", "encounter between two worlds", "cultural fusion" (or "natural mixing"), names he rejected and instead preferred the terms "empowerment", "domination" and others more according with history.

O'Gorman was the author of several historical texts between 1951 and 1986. O'Gorman published his first works and studies in the "Alcancía" along with his close friend Justino Fernández.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Vásquez, J. DON EDMUNDO O'GORMAN.| url=http://historiamexicana.colmex.mx/pdf/13/art_13_1866_16691.pdf}} ''Op.cit.'' p.688&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a great admirer of authors such as [[José Ortega y Gasset]], [[Wilheim Dilthey]], [[Benedeto Croce]], [[Martin Heidegger]], among other history writers&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Hale, C. EDMUNDO O'GORMAN Y LA HISTORIA NACIONAL.| url=http://148.206.53.230/revistasuam/signoshistoricos/include/getdoc.php?id=252&amp;article=33&amp;mode=pdf| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110703112033/http://148.206.53.230/revistasuam/signoshistoricos/include/getdoc.php?id=252&amp;article=33&amp;mode=pdf| archivedate=2011-07-03| df=}}Published in June 2000.

'''Egotheism''' is [[Apotheosis|deification]] of the [[self]], or the view that the idea of God is nothing more than a conception of the self. The latter position presupposes the impossibility of divine [[revelation]]. As such, it is a denial of the validity of [[faith]] and most theistic traditions, except for [[deism]]. [[Satanism]] teaches self-deification. Identification of the self with the [[Divinity|divine]] is a tenet of Hinduism ([[Ātman (Hinduism)|Atman]] as the "true self"). A version of egotheism exists in the [[pagan]] cult of [[Antinous]], where it is known as ''homotheosis''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11062">'''Eugenio Trias''' (31 August 1942 – 10 February 2013&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.es/cultura/20130210/abci-muere-eugenio-trias-201302101636.html Muere Eugenio Trías, un filósofo que quiso llevar el pensamiento más allá del límite]&lt;/ref&gt;) was a philosopher. He is regarded by the majority of the critics as the most important thinker since [[Ortega y Gasset]]&lt;ref&gt;Among others, José Manuel Martínez Pulet in his PH.D. dissertation (2000, UAM); Andres Sanchez Pascual, Juan Antonio Rodríguez Tous and twelve other writers in ''Limit, symbol and shadow'' (Barcelona, Destino, 2003); Fernando Pérez- Borbujo in ''The other side of beauty'' (Barcelona, Herder, 2006); Jacobo Muñoz, Francisco Jose Martin and other critics in a reading on ''The philosophy of the limit. A debate with Eugenio Trías'' (Madrid, Biblioteca Nueva, 2007); and Arash Arjomandi, in his PH.D. dissertation (2005, UPF).&lt;/ref&gt; in the philosophical literature written in Spanish.

== Biography ==
Trias was born in [[Barcelona]].  After obtaining his bachelor's degree in Philosophy at the [[University of Barcelona]] in 1964, he continued his studies in Pamplona, Madrid, Bonn and Cologne. Since 1965 he was Assistant Professor and, later, Associate Professor of Philosophy at the University of Barcelona (UB) and the [[Universitat Autònoma of Barcelona]] (UAB). In 1972 he stayed, for one year, in Brazil and Argentina, where he offered several courses and lectures. In 1976 he became Assistant Professor of Aesthetics and Composition at the School of Architecture of Barcelona. In 1986 he gained the Chair of Philosophy at this University, where he remained until 1992. In 1992 he became Chair Professor of Philosophy at the [[Pompeu Fabra University]] in Barcelona, where he remained as a Professor of [[History of Ideas]] until his death, aged 70, in his home city.

== Thought ==
He had an encyclopedical conception of philosophy and spread his ideas in very diverse fields such as [[ethics]], [[politics]], [[aesthetics]], [[Philosophy of Religion|philosophy of religion]], [[Philosophy of History|philosophy of history]], [[Theory of Knowledge|theory of knowledge]], and [[ontology]]. He dealt with almost every field where philosophy can be applied. His preferred fields, nevertheless, were, above all, Philosophy of Arts and Aesthetics, on the one hand, and Philosophy of Religion, on the other. He always tried to derive his whole thought from his own personal conception of ontology, which is usually called the “Philosophy of Limit”. Many of his books have already become obligatory references in the Spanish written philosophical heritage of the last 60 years. Some of his works such as ''Treaty on Passion'', ''Beauty and the Sinister'', ''The World's limits'' or ''The Age of the Spirit'' have become classics of the Spanish written philosophical thought of the 20th century.

His work is regarded by the critics&lt;ref&gt;For instance, the newspaper ''ABC'', August 27, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; as one of two most significant philosophical pillars of the contemporary Spanish thought. Critics have praised his work for his particular style of writing (in which the philosophical thought gets poetic antennas with a great literary value). His works have been regarded not only a very important contribution to the Spanish philosophical and cultural heritage, but also an enormous textual production that will remain as one of the most reliable milestones of his generation in the fields of the philosophical literature and of the knowledge-oriented writing. Trias published over thirty-five books, some of which have had several editions in Spain and abroad. His first book, ''The Philosophy and its shadow'', published in 1969, was hailed by critics as an event in the Spanish cultural life. It was regarded as "the philosophy of a new generation" (Josep Maria Carandell). In his latest two books ''The Sirens Chant'' –which has become a non-fiction bestseller in Spain– and ''The Sonorous Imagination'' Trias held that there is a need of a musical turn in the philosophy of the 21st century to make thought change its gravity center, to musical aspects instead of language, since the former represents the most perfect synthesis of beauty and knowledge.&lt;ref&gt;Barcelona, Random House, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

== The main topics of his Philosophy ==
According to the most recent book on Trias, ''Reason and revelation'',&lt;ref&gt;Arash Arjomandi, Barcelona, Ediciones ElCobre, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; these have been –in chronological order– the main topics of Trias philosophical works:
•	The shadows of the philosophical theories
•	The [[reason]] of the irrational
•	The artists and their society 
•	The [[wikt:sinister|Sinister]] as the limit and condition of [[beauty]]
•	[[Passionate love]] as the basis of intelligence
•	The [[Modernity]] crisis
•	The human condition as a bordering existence
•	The religious experience
•	The beauty and the [[sacred]]
•	A new ethics as an ethics of limit
•	The musical turn of the Philosophy

== His main contributions to Philosophy ==
As an alternative to a narrow-minded rationalism –such as the [[logical positivism]], the [[analytical philosophy]] or the [[Marxist thought]]–, Trias, who has never been an irrationalist philosopher, intended to extend reason to those spheres which are still reluctant to it, although they can somehow impregnate it.&lt;ref&gt;Jose M. Martínez Pulet, ''Variations of the limit'', Madrid, Noesis, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; Some examples of these spheres are: the irrationality and the madness (in his book ''Philosophy and carnival''); the mythical and magical thought (in his book ''Methodology of magical thought''); the passionate love (in his book ''Treaty on passion''); the Sinister (in his book ''The beauty and the sinister'') as a shade of the categories of beauty and the sublime which founded the traditional aesthetics; or the world of religions as the shadow of the modern Western reason (as shown in his ''The age of the Spirit'').
That is the reason why Eugenio Trias considers himself as an "illuminist exorcist" who exposes the philosophical reason to a permanent dialogue with their shadows. But the most significant innovation of Trías philosophy appeared in the early 1980s, when he found out the cornerstone of his Philosophy, namely, the concept of ''limes'' (or, "limit"). He stated that being (whose issue has always been the main question for Western philosophy from its origins) may be understood as “being of limit”, that is, the border area that separates as well joins the phenomena and the noumena. Whereas in Kant's thought there was not such a limit or borderline that merges and splits the phenomenon and the thing-in-itself, Trias held that such a limit exists. He stated that it is a precarious, delicate, subtle but founding isthmus. And it is just the very ''being'' that philosophers intend to define. That limit is also the boundary between the reason and its shadows.
His concept of the limit is the result of an intense dialogue with the [[Kant|Kantian tradition]], [[Wittgenstein]] and [[Heidegger]]. In fact, all his work is a very developed commentary on the Wittgenstein's statement "subject is a limit of the world." Trias develops an [[anthropology]] in which the person is conceived as an inhabitant of the being's limit. On this respect, person is always referred to the abovementioned limit which for Trias has an ontological significance.&lt;ref&gt;See Arash Arjomandi, op. cit.; J.M. Martínez Pulet, op.cit., Fernando Pérez-Borbujo, op. cit.
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prizes and awards ==
Trias won many prizes and awards for his creative work. Among them, these are the most important ones:
•	In 1974 he received the New Critics Award for his book ''Drama and identity''
•	In 1975 he received the Anagrama Essay Award for ''The artist and the city''
•	In 1983 he was awarded with the Spanish National Essay Prize for ''Beauty and the sinister''
•	In 1995 he received the Ciutat de Barcelona Award, for ''The age of the Spirit''
•	In 1995 he won the 13th [[Friedrich Nietzsche Prize]] for his collected philosophical works. This award (won also by other distinguished thinkers such as Popper, Rorty or Derrida) is, in its absence, an equivalent to the [[Nobel Prize]] of Philosophy, due to the fact that it is the only international award given to a philosopher in recognition of his entire career. Eugenio Trias is the only philosopher in Spanish language who has received this award.
•	In 1997 he was awarded with the Medal of the City of Buenos Aires
•	In 2000 the Autonomous University of Santo Domingo (UASD) gave Trias an Honoris Causa Doctorate
•	In 2003 the National University of San Marcos Lima (UNMSM) gave him an Honoris Causa Doctorate
•	In 2004 he received the Gold Medal of the very prestigious Circulo de Bellas Artes de Madrid
•	In 2006 the Autonomous University of Madrid (UAM) gave Trias –together with Jose Saramago– an Honoris Causa Doctorate
•	In 2007 his best-seller book ''The Sirens chant" received two awards as the best essay of the Year: the Terenci Moix and the Qwerty prizes
•	In 2009 he received the Mariano de Cavia Award, for his article ''The great travel'', published by the ABC newspaper
•	In 2010 he received the Creation Prize of Extremadura, a very prestigious official award
•	He has been Vice-president of the Reina Sofia National Museum (Madrid) and Chairman of the Advisory Council of the Institute of Philosophy at the Centro Superior de Investigaciones Cientificas of Spain.

For philosophers Richard Feldman and Earl Conee, '''evidentialism''' is the strongest argument for justification because it identifies the primary notion of epistemic justification. They argue that if a person's attitude towards a proposition fits their evidence, then their [[doxastic]] attitude for that proposition is epistemically justified. Feldman and Conee offer the following argument for evidentialism as an epistemic justification:

(EJ) Doxastic attitude ''D'' toward proposition ''p'' is epistemically justified for ''S'' at ''t'' if and only if having ''D'' toward ''p'' fits the evidence.

For Feldman and Conee a person's doxastic attitude is justified if it fits their evidence. EJ is meant to show the idea that justification is characteristically epistemic. This idea makes justification dependent on evidence.

Feldman and Conee believe that because objections to EJ have become so prominent their defense for it is appropriate. The theses that object EJ are implying that epistemic justification is dependent upon the "cognitive capacities of an individual or upon the cognitive processes or information-gatherings practices that lead to an attitude." For Feldman and Conee, EJ is in contrast to these theses; EJ contends that the epistemic justification for an attitude is only dependent upon evidence. {{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

==Criticism==
{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
Critics of evidentialism sometimes reject the claim that a conclusion is justified only if one's evidence supports that conclusion. A typical counterexample goes like this. Suppose, for example, that [[Babe Ruth]] approaches the [[batter's box]] believing that he will hit a [[home run]] despite his current [[drunkenness]] and overall decline in performance in recent [[baseball|games]]. He realizes that, however unlikely it is that his luck will change, it would increase his chances of hitting a home run if he maintains a confident attitude. In these circumstances, critics of evidentialism argue that his belief that ''p = Babe Ruth will hit a home run'' is justified, even though his evidence does not support this belief.

Evidentialists may respond to this criticism by forming a distinction between ''pragmatic'' or ''prudential justification'' and ''[[epistemology|epistemic]] justification''. In Babe Ruth's case, it is pragmatically justified that he believe ''p'', but it is nevertheless epistemically unjustified: though the belief may be justified for the purpose of promoting some other goal (a successful at bat, in Ruth's case), it is not justified relative to the purely epistemic goal of having beliefs that are most likely to be true.

A similar response follows the criticism that evidentialism implies all [[faith]]-based beliefs are unjustified. For example, [[fideism]] claims that evidence is irrelevant to religious beliefs and that attempts to justify religious beliefs in such a way are misguided. Superficially, fideism and evidentialism have mutually exclusive takes on religious beliefs, but evidentialists use the term "justification" in a much weaker sense than the one in which fideists most likely use it. Evidentialism merely defines the epistemic condition of a belief.

Although evidentialism states that the content of the evidence does not matter, only that it constitutes valid justification towards some proposition, a skeptical criticism may be levelled at evidentialism from [[uncertainty|uncertainty theories]]. One's evidence may be objectively disproved at some point or it may be the case that one can never have absolute certainty of one's evidence. Given the logic of arguments concerning principles of uncertainty and randomness, skepticism towards knowledge merely becomes skepticism towards valid justification.

Likewise, some say that the human mind is not naturally inclined to form beliefs based on evidence, viz. [[cognitive dissonance]]. While this may be the case, evidentialists admit, evidentialism is only meant to separate justified beliefs from unjustified beliefs. One can believe that evidentialism is true yet still maintain that the human mind is not naturally inclined to form beliefs based on evidence. He would simply have to conclude that the mind is not naturally inclined to form justified beliefs.

==The infinite regress argument==
{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
Evidentialism also faces a challenge from the [[regress argument|infinite regress]] argument. This argument begins with the observation that, normally, one's supporting evidence for a belief consists of other beliefs. However, it seems that these other beliefs can do the job of justifying only if they themselves are already justified. And evidentialism demands that these supporting beliefs be justified by still further evidence if they are to be justified themselves. But this same reasoning would apply to the new, deeper level of supporting beliefs: they can only justify if they're themselves justified, and evidentialism therefore demands an even deeper level of supporting belief. And so on. According to this argument, a justified belief requires an endless supply of reasons. Some [[philosophers]] such as [[Thomas Nagel]] posit that this is an absurd conclusion.

In general, responses to this argument can be classified in the following ways:
* '''[[Foundationalism]]''': There exist beliefs that are justified, but not because they are based on any other beliefs. These are called properly [[basic beliefs]], and they are the foundation upon which all other justified beliefs ultimately rest.
* '''[[Coherentism]]''': Justified beliefs are all evidentially supported by other beliefs, but an infinite set of beliefs is not generated, because the chains of evidential support among beliefs is allowed to move in a circle. On the resulting picture, a person's belief is justified when it fits together with the person's other beliefs in a coherent way in which the person's various beliefs mutually support one another.
: A [[Doxastic logic| modest reasoner ]] subset of Coherentism would insist that all justifiable beliefs be statements about "some objects" since the negation/complement of a some statement is another some statement.
* '''[http://www.theoryofknowledge.info/epistemic-justification/reliabilism/ Conditional Theory of Justification]''' (Reliabilism): A belief is justified by a set of beliefs. However, this justification operates conditionally, as it depends on the truth of the justifying beliefs. There is not a need for basic beliefs, but one should note that this type of justification is weaker than the fundamental evidentialist position (or stronger depending upon what measure about strength and weakness is in one's ensemble of beliefs).
* '''[[Skepticism]]''': There cannot be any justified beliefs.
: A [[Doxastic logic| modest reasoner ]] subset of Scepticism like the subset of Coherentism would likewise insist and define all justifiable beliefs be statements about "some objects" since the negation/complement of a some statement is another some statement.
* '''[[Infinitism]]''': Aside from these responses, some philosophers have said that evidential chains terminate in beliefs that are not justified. Others have said that, indeed, there can exist infinite chains of reasons.

Of the main responses, coherentism and skepticism are clearly consistent with evidentialism. Coherentism allows evidential support for all of our justified beliefs in the face of the regress argument by allowing for circular chains of evidential support among beliefs. And the skeptic here is utilizing an evidentialist demand to arrive at her skeptical conclusion.

But because the resulting skepticism is so sweeping and devastating, and because so many reject the legitimacy of the circular reasoning embraced by the coherentist, foundationalism is the favored response of many philosophers to the regress argument. And foundationalism does not so clearly fit together with evidentialism. At first glance, at least, the "basic" beliefs of the foundationalist would appear to be counterexamples to the evidentialist's thesis, in that they are justified beliefs that are not rational because they are not supported by deeper evidence.

==Non-evidentialist theories of knowledge and justification==
{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}
Many contemporary epistemologists reject the view that evidential support is the whole story about the justification of beliefs. While no sensible epistemologists generally urge people to disregard their evidence when forming beliefs, many believe that a more complete theory would introduce considerations about the processes that initiate and sustain beliefs. An example of one such theory is [[reliabilism]]. The most influential proponent of reliabilism is [[Alvin Goldman]]. According to a crude form of reliabilism, ''S'' is justified in believing ''p'' if and only if ''S''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s belief in ''p'' is caused by a reliable process—a process that generally leads to true beliefs. Some of these reliable processes may require the processing of evidence; many others won't. So, Goldman would argue, evidentialism, on which the justification of a belief always turns completely on the issue of the belief's evidential support, is false. Likewise, evidentialism will be rejected by more sophisticated versions of reliabilism, some of which will allow evidence an important but limited role, as opposed to the all-encompassing role assigned to it by evidentialism.

Other non-evidentialist theories include: the [[Causal theory of knowledge|Causal Theory]], according to which ''S'' knows ''p'' if and only if ''S''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s belief in ''p'' is causally connected in an appropriate way with ''S''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s believing ''p''; and [[Robert Nozick]]'s [http://www.philosophy-index.com/epistemology/knowledge/tracking.php Truth Tracking Theory], according to which ''S'' knows ''p'' if and only if (i) ''p'' is true, (ii) ''S'' believes ''p'', (iii) ''S''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s attitude toward ''p'' tracks the [[truth value]] of ''p'' in that, when ''p'' is not true, ''S'' does not believe ''p'' and when ''p'' is true, ''S'' does believe ''p''.

Another alternative perspective, promoted by [[David Hume]]'s 18th-century opponent, [[Presbyterian]] philosopher [[Thomas Reid]], and perhaps hinted at by Hume himself, at least in some moods (though this is a very controversial issue in interpreting Hume), has it that some of our "natural" beliefs—beliefs we are led to form by natural features of the human constitution—have what can be called an "innocent-until-proven-guilty" status. Contrary to evidentialism, they can be justified in the absence of any effective evidence that supports them. They are justified just so long as one doesn't have good reason to think them false.

A new account of the extent of our evidence is [[Timothy Williamson]]'s claim that ''E=K'': one's evidence is what one knows. (See Williamson's book, ''Knowledge and Its Limits'' (Oxford UP, 2000).) Going by the "letter of the law," Williamson's resulting theory is not contrary to, but is rather an instance of, evidentialism. By allowing our evidence to encompass everything we know, Williamson is able to give thoroughly evidentialist accounts of many important epistemological concepts. But, traditionally, evidentialists have presupposed much more restrictive accounts of what our evidence is. Thus, Williamson's theory is opposed to the spirit of much traditional evidentialism, primarily because it turns evidentialism from an internalist account of justification to an externalist account (due to the factive nature of knowledge.) However, Williamson's work may point to a quite general way to modify traditional evidentialism to make it better able to meet the challenges it faces: whether or not one goes so far as to accept that ''E=K'', broadening one's view of what comprises our evidence may provide a way to address many of the objections to evidentialism, especially to those disinclined to swallow skeptical consequences of a view.

==Quotes==
"As evidentialism is a thesis about ''epistemic'' justification, it is a thesis about what it takes for one to believe justifiably, or reasonably, in the sense thought to be necessary for knowledge. Particular versions of evidentialism can diverge in virtue of their providing different claims about what sorts of things count as [http://www.iep.utm.edu/evidence/ evidence], what it is for one to have evidence, and what it is for one's evidence to support believing a proposition. Thus, while (EVI) is often referred to as ''the theory'' of epistemic justification known as evidentialism, it is more accurately conceived as a ''kind'' of epistemic theory. In this light, (EVI) can be seen as the central, guiding thesis of evidentialism. All evidentialist theories conform to (EVI), but various divergent theories of evidentialism can be formulated."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/evidenti/|title=Evidentialism {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ferrante de Gemmis''' (April 14, 1732 – April 21, 1803) was an [[Italy|Italian]] philosopher and literary man.

==Biography==
Ferrante de Gemmis was born in [[Terlizzi]], near [[Bari]]. His parents were the Baron Tommaso de Gemmis and Francesca Bruni.

He was educated in [[Naples]] where he graduated in law. He inherited the properties of his uncle Minister Ferrante Maddalena. 

De Gemmis was a friend of the philosopher and political economist [[Antonio Genovesi]]. He founded an Academy in [[Terlizzi]] becoming the primary exponent of Illuminism in the region of Apulia. He refused to become a judge so he could continue writing about philosophy even though he wrote in anonymity for modesty.

His portrait is in the Dictionary of the notable people of the Reign of Naples.

He died in [[Terlizzi]] on April 21, 1803.

'''Forbidden knowledge''', which is different from [[secret knowledge]], is used to describe [[forbidden books]] or other information to which access is restricted or deprecated for political or religious reasons. Forbidden knowledge is commonly not secret, rather a society or various institutions will use repressive mechanisms to either completely prevent the publication of information they find objectionable or dangerous ([[censorship]]), or failing that, to try to reduce the public's trust in such information ([[propaganda]]). Public repression can create paradoxical situation where the proscribed information is generally common knowledge but publicly citing it is disallowed.

A rich set of examples exist through history. 
* The [[Roman Catholic]] church forbids publication of books to which it has not granted [[Imprimatur]].&lt;ref name=WotD&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/wordoftheday/archive/2004/08/19.html Word of the Day: imprimatur]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG0017/_P2P.HTM Code of Canon Law, canon 830 §3]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Throughout the years of isolation in [[Japan]] and [[China]] all Western literature was forbidden. 
*Certain 20th century regimes (e.g. [[communism|communist]] nations in [[Eastern Europe]] and China) placed strong restrictions on foreign propaganda.
* In the [[United States]], conservative groups including [[Jerry Falwell]]'s [[Moral Majority]] made several attempts to censor pro civil-rights and feminist works such as [[Our Bodies, Ourselves]].&lt;ref name=Davis1&gt;{{cite book|last=Davis|first=Kathy|title=The making of Our bodies, ourselves: how feminism travels across borders|page=25|quote=[[Jerry Falwell]], in particular launched a crusade against OBOS, trying to have it banned in libraries on the grounds that it was obscene, antifamily, and anti-Christian.|year=2007|publisher=Duke University press Books|asin=B003DSHWT8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Merter, Martin &amp; Njeri, Itabari|title=Book Burning Is Just The Start|work=Evening Independent|date=October 3, 1986|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=950&amp;dat=19861003&amp;id=srhaAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=p1kDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3593,598817}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|work=[[The European Journal of Women's Studies]]|year=2002|publisher=[[SAGE Publications]]|title=Feminist Body/Politics as World Traveller: Translating Our Bodies, Ourselves|last=Davis|first=Kathy|quote=OBOS managed, however, to weather these and other storms, including the Reagan years, the rise of the Moral Majority, and an increasingly anti-feminist backlash.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In many cases this resulted in people defending themselves by creating [[political joke]]s. Jokes throughout history have been a powerful instrument to undermine state authority and the [[public truth]] associated with it.

Today's (2005) examples in repressive regimes are still uncountable but even liberal societies sometimes impose limits to the freedom of the individual to spread information that is not [[politically correct]]. For example, [[Germany]] bans the publication of certain books associated with the [[Nazism|Nazi]] regime.

==Sociological and political relevance==
{{POV-check|section|date=February 2012}} 
Some form of public repression of facts or speculation not desirable to some people or even a majority of the population seems inevitable as societies need to create some common basis of facts to create a unified identity. Critical to political and personal freedom is the level to which this repression is organized through the state or powerful private organizations. Western [[secular]] societies have reached the consensus through the late 19th and early 20th centuries that private organizations should not be allowed to engage in compulsory censorship, forcing people to obey their dictates. For example, the [[separation of church and state]] in most Western societies mostly prevents religious organizations from repressing individuals based on their personal opinions and beliefs. As well, people are generally allowed to leave employment with a company which may regulate such personal expressions for whatever reason and find employment in less restrictive circumstances.

'''François Brousse''' (May 7, 1913 - October 25, 1995) was a philosophy professor who had mainly taught in the [[Languedoc-Roussillon]] region and is the author of some 80 works including poetry, essays (metaphysical, astronomical, historical and esoteric), novels, plays and storybooks.
He was a pioneer of the [[Café Philosophique|philosophy cafes]] that were popping up almost everywhere in France at the end of the 20th century.
Brousse was born in Perpignan, France and died in Clamart, France.

==Works==
In his approximately 40 poetry books, François Brousse embodies the role of a poet. In a radio broadcast (1957), he described this role as being the "gardener of humanity": "Since then, I believe in the civilizing mission poets have. He scatters seeds of beauty, admiration, enthusiasm and love in humanity's collective subconscious. These seeds grow slowly and through them, we can witness a soul's development, the only true type of advancement existing&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Wenger, ''François Brousse l'Enlumineur des mondes'' (François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds). (Saint-Cloud: Ed. Danicel productions, 2005), 255.&lt;/ref&gt;".

In addition to his interest in writing, he was well known in the city of [[Perpignan]] for hosting informal meetings in public areas, cafes, herbal stores and special groups, such as the Groupe de la Quatrième Dimension 1950 (The Fourth Dimension Group) and the Association France-Inde 1953. He also contributed to numerous regional magazines such as ''Madeloc'', ''Sources Vives'', ''Agni'', ''Conflent'', ''Tramontane'' and so forth.

His knowledge and talent as an [[orator]] was visible in conferences that became more frequent after 1963. First held in [[Prades, Pyrénées-Orientales|Prades]], then in Perpignan and they finally spread around France, Geneva (Switzerland, 1990) and Tell el-Amarna (Egypt, 1992).

The subjects touched upon in these conferences, which were usually announced in the local press, principally addressed the goal he had given himself in 1945, "One of my earthly missions will be to not only impart the keys to Hugolian esotericism but also the mysteries of Saint John and the secrets of Nostradamus.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Amazan [one of the literary pseudonyms of François Brousse], ''L'Avenir des peuples'', (The Future of Humanity), (Perpignan : Printer SINTHE &amp; Co, 25 January 1945), 8.&lt;/ref&gt;"

Seen as an unclassifiable and colorful character from the city, he described himself as "a quiet man." He explained, "I prefer to meditate rather than meet people and be in crowds. I only want to be read because I have an important message to communicate. […] My mission is to relight the blazing flame of poetry, metaphysics and perfection.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse interviewed by François Villée, "L'Apocalypse n'est pas pour demain," (The Apocalypse is not for Tomorrow), magazine ''L'Inconnu'', Paris, No. 50, April 1980.&lt;/ref&gt;"

The daily French local papers, ''L'Indépendant'', ''Midi Libre'', ''[[La Dépêche du Midi]]'' as well as other regional and national news sources dedicated at least two hundred and fifty articles to him whereas periodical journals came out with more than three hundred other sources&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Wenger, Conference "François Brousse, Homme-Cosmos du XXe siècle," (François Brousse, the 20th Century Man of the Cosmos) conference SONGE, Montpellier, 26 February 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; concerning him in some way or another.

=="1923–1938" Auroral Poetry==

=== Fantasies (1923–1928)===
The only child of a French family from Perpignan, François Brousse had a studious and secretive youth. "Already mastering the subtleties of the French language and composing verses, he wrote his first poem ‘Soir,’ (Night) ‘most likely at the age of ten.’" With extraordinary virtuoso, he also began his first book entitled Fantasies,&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse,  ''Fantaisies'' (''Fantasies''). Clamart : Ed. [[La Licorne Ailée]], 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; which he dedicated to his "beloved parents," and finished at the age of fifteen. He had a strong taste for literature, especially poetry&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Wenger, ''François Brousse l’Enlumineur des mondes'' (''François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds''). (Saint-Cloud: Ed. Danicel productions, 2005.) 22.&lt;/ref&gt; with five hundred poems, about three thousand verses, three thousand new ones in prose, and some forty drawings and paintings found within ''Fantasies''.

===The Tales of the Pigeon and the Source – Jasmine (1927)===
At the age of fourteen, he wrote The Tales of the Pigeon and the Source,&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''Contes du pigeon et de la source'' (Tales of the Pigeon and the Source). Revue ''B.M.P'' May–June 2004, no. 233-234. Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; which touched on "love leading to voluntary self-sacrifice in terms of accepting suffering and the death of one’s beloved&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Wenger 2005"&gt;Jean-Pierre Wenger, ''François Brousse l’Enlumineur des mondes'' (François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds). (Saint-Cloud : Ed. Danicel productions, 2005.) 27.&lt;/ref&gt;" It was followed by a swordsman novel, Jasmine that occurred at the time of [[King Louis XIV]] and the [[Revocation of the Edict of Nantes]] (1685).

===Auroral or Where my Fairy Lives (1928)===
To begin to understand what François Brousse saw as "Auroral poetry" (Title of Book VIII), we must first address the poem, "Auroral or Where My Fairy Lives" (date of completion, April 1928). " ‘Divine Poetry,’ shows the young poet the works of Ronsard, La Fontaine, Victor Hugo, Leconte de Lisle&lt;ref name="Jean-Pierre Wenger 2005"/&gt;  by a woman with blond hair through air bound travels. The poet asks, "Which of these four beings must I imitate?" The goddess answers, "You will decide for yourself.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse,  ''Fantaisies'' (Fantasies). (Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 2000), 210.&lt;/ref&gt; "

"Art needs to be free,

The infiniteness of all the heavens,

Eternity must vibrate

To its capricious impulses."

The deeper meaning of this long poem (916 verses) is that everything dies but is also reborn, "animals, humans and plants," and even suns: "Yes, the immortal star has been killed! / But the Infinite gives it life again.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, "La poésie aurorienne : Aurorienne ou Chez ma Fée" (Auroral Poetry : Auroral or Where my Fairy Lives). ''Fantaisies'' (Fantasies) Book VIII. (Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 2000), 240.&lt;/ref&gt; " There is an idea of permanent creation and perpetual rebirth in a collision of merging worlds. At the end of his life, François Brousse confides in the presence of his friends :

"When I was a child, my father had asked me:

What do you want to create?

I answered him :

Auroral Poetry.

He told me :

That is extremely ambitious. You think the Dawn didn’t exist before your Poetry ?

And I told him that the Dawn is perpetually renewed. He told me I was right and he would help me at the bottom of the abyss after he had entered the infinite, the absolute and the eternal.&lt;ref&gt;BROUSSE François, « Anniversaire – 07-05-1995 », Revue B. M. P., N°198-202, mars-juillet 2001, Éd. La Licorne Ailée, Clamart.&lt;/ref&gt;"

===A Sip of poetry (1928)===
From all his sources of inspiration and admiration, at a very young age François Brousse finally chose his favorite poet after some hesitation: Victor Hugo. This choice was apparent in the prologue of Une Gorgée de Poésie (A Sip of Poetry) written from May to August 1928. It was an anthology dedicated to Victor Hugo specifying the presence of a seed of poetry within every soul and that "a being without poetry is a being without a soul […] incapable of superhuman feelings.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Jean-Pierre Wenger, ''François Brousse l’Enlumineur des mondes'' (François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds). (Saint-Cloud: Ed. Danicel productions, 2005), 39.&lt;/ref&gt;"

===The Poetry of Victor Hugo (c. 1935)===
His notebook on The Poetry of Victor Hugo,&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, "La poésie de Victor Hugo" (The Poetry of Victor Hugo). Revue ''B.M.P.'' no. 226-230, Oct.–Dec. 2003 – Jan.–Feb. 2004. Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée.&lt;/ref&gt; "the strong giant, especially in his kindness to the humble," yet again exemplifies this high poetic awareness. He lets his thoughts amble on ''Odes et Ballades'' (Odes and Ballads), ''Les quatre Vents de l’Esprit'' (The Four Winds of the Spirit), ''Le Pape'' (The Pope), ''La Pitié suprême'' (Supreme Mercy), ''Religions et Religion'' (Religions and Religion), ''L’Âne'' (The Donkey), ''Toute la Lyre'' (The Whole Lyre), ''Dernière Gerbe'' (Last Gleanings) but he swore that "the most beautiful books written by this great genius are ''Les Contemplations'' (Contemplations), ''La Légende des siècles'' (The Legend of the Ages), ''[[La Fin de Satan]]'' (The End of Satan) and ''Dieu'' (God)."

An extract from this notebook particularly stresses both the impetuous style and precocious commitment of the young François Brousse :

''When Death places her skeleton hand upon her eyelids, the grateful country makes her grandiose funerals and builds her a statue made of bronze and gold. But a few envious mosquitoes, filled with venom, come and circle around the statue, harassing the giant dreaming under the luminous sky with their miniature stingers. A child passed by. He was an adolescent filled with joy and pride from the glory of Titan, his ancestor. He saw the hideous crowd jeering in the face of the powerful statue. With an indignant and serene gesture, he drove away the revolting whirlwind and kneeled before the great statue, which had been insulted. I will be this child.''

For him, "a people without poets are an earth without a sky.&lt;ref&gt;"François Brousse, "''Bloc mémo'' – 29 juin 1931" (Memo Pad – 29 June 1931). Revue ''B.M.P.'' no. 253-257, Mar.–July 2006. Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée.&lt;/ref&gt;" The "child" embodies this auroral poetry. The budding poet wants to bring a new dawn to the old world, collapsing and rotting. This is what he stated at the end of his life :

''The particularity of great poets is to always add something new. By adding something new, they change their readers because by being completely baffled, the readers try to find the key to the mystery, the enigma, the big key that opens all the heavens for us. And they get there. All they need to do is love. To love is a word full of all the stars''.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, "Anniversaire – 07-05-1995" (05-07-1995 Birthday). Revue B.M.P. no. 198-202. Mar.–July 2001. Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Gods (1930–1932) – The Giants (1932–1938)===
During his last two years at the Collège de Perpignan (Perpignan Middle School) (1930–1932), François Brousse finished a collection of thirty-five poems entitled ''Les Dieux'' (The Gods)&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''Le Rire des dieux'' (The Laughing of the Gods). Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;  and started a series of sonnets on ''Les Colosses'' (The Giants), presented here by Jean-Pierre Wenger in his biography, ''François Brousse l’Enlumineur des mondes'' (François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds :

''This anthology builds upon a source of inspiration already begun at an earlier time with mythology – mainly Greek – and with Egyptian, Cambodian, Biblical and Hindu traditions. These sonnets bathe their strophes in these unearthly dimensions where humanity’s universal saga is expressed. The reader is transported into the domain of pure ideas made so real that he or she forgets everything else. He simultaneously began "Les Colosses" with the geniuses who civilized humanity: Homer, Aeschylus and Virgil whose enormous physical builds had a distinct influence on the people. It is made up of fifty-seven sonnets. No conquerors are present. Although antique Greece was the author’s preference, he nevertheless did not neglect the Biblical saga with Isaiah and Ezekiel, to which he would subsequently dedicate his studies. Also amongst Les Colosses are some Latin heroes like Tacitus, Juvenal and Virgil who were already ranked in Victor Hugo’s Hall of Humanity in "La Préface de Cromwell" (Cromwell’s Preface) ''.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Wenger, François Brousse l’Enlumineur des mondes (François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds). (Saint-Cloud: Ed. Danicel productions, 2005), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Julien (1935) – Ganelon (c. 1935)===
At the Montpellier College of Arts and Languages, where he had registered in 1932, Brousse embarked upon writing two epics: ''Julien'' (750 verses, finished April 14, 1935) which recounts a few events in the life of the Roman emperor, [[Flavius Claudius Julianus]] (331-363), also known under the name, Julian the Apostate; and most likely Ganelon (2060 verses) about the legendary ''Song of Roland'' and Ganelon's betrayal. Roland died in an apotheosis-like destiny while giving his blood "to save the universe" in order to keep the flame of Wisdom and Freedom lighted.

===The Lotus Queen – The Awakenings of Lazare (1936)===
"In March 1936 (or November 1937), Brousse started working for the French National Education System first as a Boarding School Supervisor, then as part of the adjunct faculty and from 1940, taught philosophy and literature in the Languedoc-Roussillon region until he retired in 1975. He also brought exposure to the science of cosmography (1955, 1962).&lt;ref&gt;.Jean-Pierre Wenger, ''François Brousse l’Enlumineur des mondes'' (François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds). (Saint-Cloud: Ed. Danicel productions, 2005), 71.&lt;/ref&gt;"

In March 1936, Hitler broke the Locarno Pact and reoccupied the Rhineland areas, which has been demilitarized. François Brousse foretold of great upheaval to come in "La Reine du lotus, "(The Lotus Queen)&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, "La reine du lotus" (The Lotus Queen) poem completed on 07-13-1936 in ''La Rosée des constellations'' (The Dew of Constellations). (Clamart: Éd. La Licorne Ailée, 1991), 7-16&lt;/ref&gt; which he classified amongst the major poems of his book:&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, Conférence, Paris (Conference in Paris). 22 November 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

''A Tower is rising, "the Triumphant Babel," with powerful walls whose blocks are "kneaded with bones." We can see one of the "Tours de la Nuit"  (Night Towers).&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, "Les tours de la nuit" (Night Towers). Revue ''L’Astrosophie'' 5 May 1939: Nice.&lt;/ref&gt; This work is a study foretelling the collapse of dictatorships., a crystallization of bleak dogmatisms crushing human aspirations towards perfection. It is the totalitarian dream and will of power obliterating love.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Wenger, ''François Brousse l’Enlumineur des mondes'' (François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds). (Saint-Cloud: Ed. Danicel productions, 2005), 86.&lt;/ref&gt;''

In addition, on August 10, 1936, François finished "Les Réveils de Lazare&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, "Les Réveils de Lazare" (Lazarus’s Awakenings). ''L’Avenir des peuples'' (The Future of Mankind). Perpignan: Sinthe &amp; Co, 25 January 1945.&lt;/ref&gt;", a prophetic study based on some of Victor Hugo's writings [''Les Châtiments'' (Castigations) and ''La Légende des siècles'' (The Legend of Ages)], under the alias "Charles Amazan." Here, he touches on the unification of Austria and Germany, the tragic end of Mussolini, the final fall of Nazism, the breakdown of Anglo-Saxon colonialism and the future democratic nature of the United States and Europe.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

=="1938" - Meeting Cajzoran Ali==
After five years studying at the University of Montpellier for a teaching degree in Language and Philosophy, he started working for the French National Education System. In 1938, life events led him to meet Cajzoran Ali, a thirty-five-year-old North-American woman who had published a book about Yoga in New York ten years earlier entitled, Divine Posture Influence upon Endocrine Glands.&lt;ref&gt;Ali Cajzoran, (Memphis, USA, 1903–c. 1975) Published Divine Posture Influence upon Endocrine Glands in New York City (USA) in 1928 with descriptions of forty-eight Yoga positions&lt;/ref&gt;

François Brousse recounts this unusual meeting in Béziers and Montpellier in his book Isis-Uranie.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, Isis-Uranie (Isis and Urania) in La Trinosophie de l’Étoile polaire (The Polar Star Trinosophia). (Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1990), (Isis and Urania)&lt;/ref&gt; It marked a decisive moment in his life due to the significance of the knowledge he gained, amongst which were unknown Upanishads, the vast panorama in which current humanity – the Fifth Race – resides in a line of evolution soaring through past and future millenniums.{{Citation needed|reason=seems made up and general un-useful information |date=October 2016}}

Another revelation from the Yogini to the young poet was the Tarot of India and Egypt, a collection of twenty-four figurines or archetypes representing the twenty-four principle cycles, planets, religions, philosophies, methods and eternal masters in world history. "Poetic inspiration, dreams, madness and also fantasy, folklore, mythology and religion are reflections of these universal archetypes that we find in all peoples and that seem to have sprung up miraculously in perfect harmony, order and parallelism […].&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, Conference on "Zorah ou la rencontre avec le mystère" (Zorah or the Encounter with Mystery)Perpignan: 11 December 1975"&lt;/ref&gt;

=="1938"- The Earth Poem==
The Poème de la Terre (Earth Poem) – 35 sonnets dedicated to the living Earth – was the first book published by François Brousse. This was a brilliant breakthrough into 20th century literature for the inspired poet. The work is epic in its Homerian strength, reminiscent of exploding comets and spewing lava, and recounts the chaotic steps of the Universe’s Origins, the birth of the Earth and its amazing separation. On rock-hard marble, he etched opinions, which he would hold throughout his life about the ultimate purpose of life with sonnets like, "Les réincarnations," (Reincarnations) "Les génies," (The Geniuses) and "L’idée de Dieu" (The Idea of God). The author himself comments about "Reincarnations": "Such a sonnet holds doctrines discovered by sages from all religions and is the pure diamond of Truth. The transmigration of souls, the law of Karma, which spans the universes and finally the infinite progress of an indestructible being in a limitless life...".&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, La Trinosophie de l’Étoile polaire (The Polar Star Trinosophia). (Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1990), 62&lt;/ref&gt; "

What more is there to say about Le Poème de la Terre? I hear the echoing voice of Antoine Orliac who just yesterday, talking to me and placing a hand on François Brousse’s shoulder said, "Finally, here is a true poet! (Albert Janicot, magazine Madeloc, no. 37, Perpignan, October 1955)

=="1939–1949" - Historical studies==
Leaning on Victor Hugo’s texts, in May 1939 he published "Les Tours de la nuit" (The Night Towers) in the magazine Astrosophie. Here, he announced the fall of the fascist dictatorships and did so four months before France and England went to war against Hitler.

Between 1947 and 1948, a series of articles entitled "Le secret des tombes royales&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''Le Secret des tombes royales'', (The Secret of Royal Tombs), Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1991&lt;/ref&gt;" (The Secret of the Royal Graves)  appeared in the magazine Destins (Paris). They related to France's history and discussed the 1,000 and 300&amp;nbsp;year cycles François Brousse spoke about, which had stuck a chord with the French, European and international public from the second half of the 20th century and the beginning of the 21st century, its critical period being the ± 4&amp;nbsp;years around 2015.

In 1949, he finished another historical study called, "La Prophétie des papes, miroir du monde&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''La Prophétie des papes, miroir du monde'' (The Prophecy of Popes, the Mirror of the World), Perpignan : Buro services, 1981, Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée&lt;/ref&gt;" (The Prophecy of Popes, the Mirror of the World).

=="1942" - Lamennais and Universal Christianity==
{{lang|fr|Lamennais et le christianisme universel}} (Lamennais and Universal Christianity) (Ed. Le Scorpion, Paris, 1963). This philosophical essay corresponds to François Brousse's memory on Raison individuelle et Raison générale chez Lamennais (Lamennais’ Individual and Popular Reason). In May 1942 he successfully finished his studies started many years earlier in Montpellier and obtained the Diplôme d’Études Supérieures de Philosophie et Lettres (Master's degree in Philosophy and Language).

Brousse happily reveals the strengths, weaknesses and this remarkable genius’ duality of life and thought. To his credit, in a clear and immensely beautiful manner he reproduced the meaning and value of the ideal that set the genius alight. His book must be read and reread because it bubbles with passion and surges with ideas. Its singing poetry carries our mind so much above its normal limits that we cannot deny this is more than a book, more than an author and more than a study: We are at the heart of great mystery, in the infiniteness of thought before the beginning and end, facing the blinding rays of suns masking the eternal Truth.&lt;ref&gt;Roland Le Courbier, "Lamennais et le christianisme universel" (Lamennais and Universal Christianity). Revue indépendante, no. 63, Sept.-Oct. 1964.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="1952"- Fourth Dimension Poetry==
In the July, 17th 1952 newspaper edition of Sud-Ouest (Bordeaux, France), an article by R. Cahisa called, "À l’inconscient surréaliste substituant le surconscient, François Brousse, philosophe et conteur, fonde le groupe de la Quatrième Dimension. (Surrealist unconsciousness substituting for super-consciousness, François Brousse, philosopher and storyteller, founds the Forth Dimension Group). Brousse is portrayed as a person who is, "svelte and thin with strong prescription glasses. This kind, patient and optimistic vegetarian who believes in homeopathy, the afterlife, metempsychosis and who admires Hindu philosophy and Gandhi – who let himself die of hunger – could be said to have his head in the clouds or even on trans-Plutonian planets."

The thinker had detailed views on surrealism and science :

"[...] Einstein spent time in the Forth Dimension. A mistake, says Brousse. The Forth Dimension is a supernatural world radiating beyond time, space and the material world. In order to reach this supernatural world, true inner discipline is necessary. All thoughts of hate must be eliminated, enthusiasm and a sense of aestheticism must be cultivated, dreams must be analyzed and metaphysical thought must be stimulated."

This new poetry is not inspired by morbid and devastating twentieth century realism but by pure, marble-like sources of imagination from which some poets drink on high volcano peaks with the wings of dreams and clairvoyance, the lucid metaphysical eye of super-consciousness.

"Rejecting drugs and their associated disorders, despair and degeneration, as a writer, Brousse only reveals this famous Forth Dimension to investigation by scientific experts to then make it available to all by placing it in the domain of inspiration.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Wenger, François Brousse l’Enlumineur des mondes (François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds). (Saint-Cloud: Ed. Danicel productions, 2005), 193-194&lt;/ref&gt;

Three keys are necessary to open the doors to the sanctuary of this supernatural world, guiding us to the Forth Dimension: purification, meditation and contemplation.

Purifying the body, soul and spirit,&lt;ref&gt;See François Brousse, "Les Trois Purifications" (The Three Purifications). Revue B.M.P. no. 62, Nov. 1988. Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée.&lt;/ref&gt; particularly through vegetarianism, nonviolence and practicing Buddhist blessings of wishing happiness to all beings in every direction – North, South, East, West, the nadir, zenith and within our primordial being. François Brousse’s  stance &lt;ref&gt;"Les Trois Purifications" (The Three Purifications). Revue B.M.P. no. 62, Nov. 1988. Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée.&lt;/ref&gt; was, "We must be completely vegetarian. If we cannot do so, we will never know the ultimate Truth. This is an absolute truth that I am telling you here…"

Meditating on the great sacred textures, humanity's heritage.

Contemplating artistic masterpieces from Rembrandt, Michelangelo, Mozart, Hugo and others, thus immersing ourselves in universal Beauty and spiritual escape.

The remainder of the article primarily addresses the soul. "Humans reincarnate on a planet until they attain supreme Wisdom. At that time, they move beyond the wheel of reincarnation and enter into eternal Joy. [...] This is the destiny of all souls after more or less transformation."

He gives this Group a Fourth Dimension Manifesto.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, Le Manifeste de la Quatrième Dimension, (The Forth Dimension Manifesto). Vitrolles: Ed. La neuvième Licorne, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  A number of poems edited between 1950 and 1970 thereby drew their inspiration, amongst which were Les Pèlerins de la nuit (The Night Pilgrims) that won the "Grand Prix d’Honneur aux Jeux floraux du Genêt d’Or" (a literary prize) in Perpignan.

=="1966–1989" - The God of philosophers==
In his books like his discourse, Brousse's metaphysics branch out from philosophical deism dear to Voltaire, which states :

"The universe encumbers me and I cannot imagine

This clock existing with no clockmaker.&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire (1694–1778). ''Les Cabales'' (The Cabals). 1772.&lt;/ref&gt;"

It admits to an existing Principle of consciousness, the infinite, eternity, the absolute, the source of the Being and the Merit where "for lack of a greater name, we say God&lt;ref&gt;Victor Hugo, "À l’évêque qui m’appelle athée" (To the bishop who calls me an atheist). ''L’Année terrible'' (The Terrible Year) Aug. 1870. Nov. IX. The exact verse is: "Et que, faute d'un nom plus grand, j'appelle Dieu" (Who, for want of a greater name, I call God).&lt;/ref&gt;". " It clarifies the human journey by affirming the existence of an immortal soul that incarnates from body to body under the sovereign law of Karma until it is able to identify with the entire cosmos in a process of Wisdom, Love, Power, Joy and Beauty.

In the succession of humanity’s great thinkers like Plato, Orpheus, Pythagoras, Hermes and Lamblichus, François Brousse affirms the existence of metempsychosis, which is necessary in this long night pilgrimage to the blinding heights of imperishable eternity and the possibility of humans falling back into the animalistic chasm and potentially even deeper in expiation. Such is the unfortunate fate of dictators and tyrants, described captivatingly by Victor Hugo in his poem "Ce que dit la bouche d’ombre&lt;ref&gt;Victor Hugo, "Ce que dit la bouche d’ombre" (What the Shadow’s Mouth Says). ''Les Contemplations'' (Contemplations) Book VI. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;" (What the Shadow's Mouth Says) in ''Les Contemplations'' (Contemplations). A Promethean amount of work carried out uncountable lives, deaths, falls, rebirths and rises but from which the spirit's triumph will inevitably arise.

"To bloom, to wither, and flower again

Is the destiny of Eve’s children.

Their crowd passes like a dream

It is the burning spark of sapphires&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, Rencontre avec l’Être (Meeting with the Being). (Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1995), 50.&lt;/ref&gt;"

It follows the idea that eternal hell does not exist but is rather, the invention of religion and all beings are called, chosen and will ultimately be saved. Should human beings eternally be punished in the name of a cruel God for a short-lived mistake? François Brousse's God is not like the Religious Gods but the philosopher's Gods that follow reason and wisdom. He thus reaffirms the great idea of Justice or Karma advocated by the Hindus and Ancient Greek philosophers, always holding the possibility of being transformed at any point in time. The God of philosophers is an impeccably just god, "But the most beautiful sapphire of his immense richness / Is to hold the infiniteness of Clemency.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''Le Baiser de l’archange'' (The Kiss of the Archangel). (Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1995), 102.&lt;/ref&gt;"

According to Brousse, three forces govern the universe: Freedom, Fatality and Providence.&lt;ref name="François Brousse 1992"&gt;François Brousse, Conference "Trois réalités : Fatalité, Providence, Liberté" (Three Realities : Fatality, Providence, Freedom), 21 February 1992, Paris.&lt;/ref&gt;"  Human beings reap what they sow. It is up to the individual to follow the paths of grace by intelligently using free will. "Providence is God’s smile when he looks upon humankind and shows the paths to a glorious life.&lt;ref name="François Brousse 1992"/&gt;"

For François Brousse, suffering is therefore not the law of the world but, alas, a sometimes necessary form of purification. "Pain teaches us and thought transforms us.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''Le Poème de la Terre'' (Earth Poem), in ''Œuvres poétiques – Tome 1'' (Poetic Works – Volume 1). (Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1986), 45.&lt;/ref&gt;" To help this slow journey of souls towards Happiness, Magicians shape human history and form what Brousse calls Aggartha.

"To push towards the threshold of an ineffable world,

Human pilgrims walking slowly,

Archangels use their grandiose energy

Carrying nations upon their adorable wings.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, Le Poème de la Terre (Earth Poem), in Œuvres poétiques – Tome 1 (Poetic Works – Volume 1). (Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1986), 45.&lt;/ref&gt;"

After a period of rigorous analysis started in his youth,&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, "''Bloc mémo'' – 5 février 1930" (Memo – February 5th, 1930), magazine ''B. M. P.'', No. 253-257, March–July 2006, Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée.&lt;/ref&gt; his thoughts revealed the illusion of time, space and cause, which was synthesized in "L’illusion de l’illusion&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, "L’Illusion de l’illusion" (The Illusion of Illusion) magazine ''B. M. P.'', No. 67, May 1989, Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée.&lt;/ref&gt;" (The Illusion of Illusion). His idealistic outlook joins Berkeley's, not seeing any reality in tangible, sensitive matter. François Brousse also came to this conclusion and for him, matter was only an insubstantial appearance; only the human spirit could give him a reality.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, "Réponse à un Chéla – 4/4 – Ce qu’on appelle la matière n’a aucune existence rationnelle […]," (Answers to a Chela – 4/4 – What we call Matter has no Rational Existence), magazine ''B. M. P.'', No. 123-124, March–July 1994, Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée.&lt;/ref&gt;

=="1989–1995"  The transfinite Poet==
From 1985 to 1990 a new style of poetry arrived and was called "Transfinite," a word already used by the German mathematician, Georg Cantor&lt;ref&gt;Georg Cantor established a hierarchy among infinite sets, as well as transfinite ordinal numbers and calculations for working with them.&lt;/ref&gt;  (1845–1918). For the poet, "the Transfinite is the union of the finite and infinite in a transcendent synthesis : Its domain is Illumination.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, Conference, Paris, 18 February 1994.&lt;/ref&gt;" Poetry is a path, a type of ascension to the most ideal metamorphosis for night pilgrims&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''Les Pèlerins de la nuit'' (The Night Pilgrims). Perpignan : Imp. Labau, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; and a true initiatory path that transforms a person enamored with beauty into transcendent exaltation.

"I rise amongst the stars

The hurricane blows in my sailed canvas

I enjoy fatal destinations.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''L’idéale Métamorphose'' (The Ideal Metamorphosis). (Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1998), 11.&lt;/ref&gt;"

This period was exceptionally fertile with poetic inspiration, which combines ethereal expression, purified until transparency and symbolic lucidity in areas where human experience draws silent.

His poetic creativity increased vertiginously and for good reason while writing on average two to three poems a day and more than 400 pages of text in a few months: ''La Rosée des constellations'' (Dew of the Constellations) (1991), ''Les Transfigurations'' (Transfigurations) (1992), ''Le Baiser de l’archange'' (The Kiss of the Archangel) (1993), ''Le Frisson de l’aurore'' (The Shiver of Dawn) (1993), ''Les Miroitements de l’Infini'' (The Shimmering Infinite) (1994), ''L’Homme aux semelles de tempête'' (The Man with Wandering Feet) (1995), ''Rencontre avec l’Être'' (Meeting with the Being) (1995) ; and the post-mortem publications with ''La Roseraie des fauvettes'' (The Warbler's Rose Garden) (1997), ''L’Idéale Métamorphose'' (The Ideal Metamorphosis) (1998), ''Le Sourire de l’Astre'' (The Star's Smile) (1998), ''Le Refrain de l’Absolu'' (The Chorus of the Absolute) (2000).

In ''Le Pas des songes'' (Following Dreams) (2001) is a collection of about two hundred of François Brousse's final poems amongst more than five thousand others written between the ages of 10 to 83.

DOVES&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, "Colombes" (Doves) ''La Rosée des constellations'' (The Dew of Constellations). (Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1991) 123.&lt;/ref&gt;

Doves, oh white doves,

Fluttering on the tombs,

Come drink from the pavement crevasses

A sidereal light.

The dead are not in the night,

They are rising to the dazzling heavens

And are traveling from awakening to awakening

Until the unfathomable sun.

They watch as all flee

Like the waters' foam

And savor, blessed lovers,

The embraces of the transfinite.

One of the last poems he wrote in his life brought much concern about the future of humanity and his extreme lucidity tinged with hope and remaining open to all possibilities :

"There is not much more time

To restore humankind

But this illustrious mission

Crosses all our paths.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''Le Pas des songes'' (The March of Dreams). (Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée 2001), 205.&lt;/ref&gt;"

(September 24, 1995)

==Public Events and Activities from or about François Brousse==

=== Conferences given by François Brousse (1951–1995) ===
Brousse's conferences began in the autumn of 1951 (magazine ''Madeloc'', No. 14, Nov. 1951, Perpignan) and concerned astronomy. They became more frequent during his sojourn in Prades (1961–1965) when opening a series on the Apocalypse (1961–1981), a theme about which he had aimed to disseminate new knowledge after 1945 [(''L’Avenir des peuples'') (The Future of the People)]. They particularly inspired the publication of ''Commentaires sur l’Apocalypse de saint Jean'', t.1 (Commentaries on Saint John's Apocalypse) vol. 1 [Ed. La Licorne Ailée (The Winged Unicorn), Clamart, 2001].

From 1975 he dedicated a few conferences (1976–1978 in Prades and Perpignan) to his encounters with beings having left a mark on his life: Zorah – ou Cajzoran Ali – (Zorah or Cajzoran Ali) (1938), [[le Comte de Saint-Germain]] (The Tale of Saint-Germain) (1966), Apollonius de Tyane (The Apollonius of Tyana) (1927). He studied other historical figures who he classified amongst the prophets of humanity like Rama, Jesus, Plotin, Ulrich of Mayence, etc.

Prophesy, a phenomenon that fascinated Brousse from 1934 after discovering Nostradamus, is widely approached by bringing in archetypes from the "Tarot" (1972), la Grande Pyramide ([[The Great Pyramid]]) (1977), books like Asia Mysteriosa (1976), lore such as the prophecies from Roi du Monde (The King of the World) (1978), secret societies like l’Ordre Polaire (The [[Order of the Polar Star]]) (1976) and the Esséniens (Essenes) (1977).

In 1979 and 1980, Brousse greatly speaks about Philippe of Lyon [L’Évangile de Philippe de Lyon (Philippe of Lyon's Gospel), Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1994], Nostradamus, and the great prophecies (three lectures on ''La Prophétie des Papes'' (The Prophecy of the Popes), Padre Pio, etc.) and in June 1979, he gave his first lecture in Paris on "La communication des sens et de l’esprit," (Communication of the Senses and the Spirit).

From 1980 he published and publicly talked about his journeys to Wesak every year during the month of May. From 1982 to 1984, he focused on the Proverbs of Solomon (more than eighteen lectures in Prades) in front of an audience captivated by his psychological finesse. He would present regularly in Paris but was also solicited in other cities in France such as Nîmes, Agde, Toulouse, Poitiers, Montpellier and Strasbourg.

His lectures (1984–1990) touching on "astrosophy" (wisdom of the stars), a word formerly used by F. Root-Wheler (1929) but to which François Brousse attributed deep importance as cycles or cosmic eras through which souls travel [''L'astrosophie ou la science divine des étoiles'', (Astrosophy or the Divine Science of the Stars) Ed. Dervy-Livres, Paris, 1989].

In 1985, his preferred subject was Initiation and a century necessity, Victor Hugo. In 1986–1987 it changed to Halley's comet, Egypt (four conferences), the Fourth Dimension, the Age of Aquarius and also seven conferences on religion. Brousse also dedicated numerous topics to the Occident's great initiates (1986–1989): Pythagoras, Plato, Rosenkreutz, Paracelsus, Hugo and more while reserving a special place for Akhenaton after 1976 (at least seven lectures).

After his last lecture in Perpignan in October 1990, he held his thoughts from the Parisian public until his final appearance at "Le Manifeste de la Quatrième Dimension" (The Fourth Dimension Manifesto) in June 1995.
From these numerous talks and lectures, a collection of 430 titles remains.

===François Brousse and France-Inde (1952–1963)===
THE FRANCE-INDE MAGAZINE

The magazine France-Inde was first published on February 1951 by an association with the same name, which was created in 1948 in Pierrefitte (around Paris) and chaired by Gopaljee Samboo. This magazine was distributed from February 1951 (No. 1) to 1975 (No. 100), quarterly or biannually and was sponsored by an Honor Committee with J.-P. Sartre, Sanghor, and G. Duhamel amongst others (1954). The Oriental scholar, Jean Herbert, wrote a few articles on Hindu spirituality for the magazine.

About ten poems, just as many articles and roughly fifteen summaries of François Brousse's work appeared in France-Inde.

THE FRANCE-INDE COMMITTEE IN PERPIGNAN

"''The mission of the France-Inde association is to develop cultural relations between two great nations and the beautiful province of Roussillon will be one of the first to partake in the resurgence of Indianism''.&lt;ref&gt;"Association France-Inde" (France-Inde Association). newspaper ''L’Indépendant'', 18 June 1952.&lt;/ref&gt;"

In June 1952, Brousse and C. Van Dyck created the France-Inde Committee in Perpignan, linked to the national France-Inde Association. From 1953 to 1963 nine public conferences were organized in this framework with lecturers such as Lanza del Vasto (November 16, 1955) – the heir to Gandhi and Vinoba – and the French Catalan hatha-yogi from Banyuls, Lucien Ferrer.&lt;ref&gt;"Le yoga expliqué par un Yoghi" (Yoga explained by a Yogi). newspaper ''L’Indépendant'', 29 May 1956.&lt;/ref&gt;"

The France-Inde Committee of Perpignan released its first publication, ''Agni'', in 1953 (magazine ''Agni'', Perpignan, No. 1-24, 1953–1960).

"Charles Amazan, Georges Zaclaz and Suryananda – the many pseudonyms of Brousse – were in this publication along with poems, metaphysical texts and essays on great minds like Jesus, Rama, Hugo, Pythagoras, Ganesha and Thalès de Milet. A few articles or reports appeared in the French papers "L’Indépendant" and "Midi Libre" recounting public conferences organized by France-Inde of Perpignan. This mainly quarterly magazine flourished for seven years, until its twenty-fourth publication.&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Wenger, ''François Brousse l’Enlumineur des mondes'', (François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds). (Saint-Cloud: Ed. Danicel productions, 2005),  205.&lt;/ref&gt;"

===François Brousse, the Poet with a hundred Faces (1954)===
In 1954, under the title, ''François Brousse le poète aux cent visages'' [(François Brousse, the Poet with a Hundred Faces) (Ed. Labau, Perpignan)], René Espeut, for whom "Brousse's poetry continually streams into the vapors of transcendent esoterism&lt;ref&gt;J. D. Magazine Tramontane. Perpignan: no 370, Jul.–Aug. 1954.,&lt;/ref&gt;"  published the first study dedicated to Brousse's poetic works.

A broadcast discussion, entitled ''François Brousse, l'Alchimiste du Rêve'' (François Brousse, the Alchemist of Dreams), dedicated to the poet's last book accompanied the study exalting the complete works of Brousse (J. D., magazine ''Tramontane'', Perpignan, No. 370, July–August 1954).

===Hommage to Brousse (1960)===
On October 25, 1960, Claude Van Dyck honored the poet in Perpignan at the "Maison du Prisonnier" with a conference called "Sous le signe de la Poésie, de la Science et de la Philosophie, François Brousse, astronome, poète et métaphysicien" (Through Poetry, Science and Philosophy, François Brousse, the Astronomer, Poet and Metaphysician). The third part of this conference was published in the magazine, ''Sources Vives'' (Perpignan, No. 18, Winter 1961).

Claude Van Dyck, a friend of François Brousse since 1951, gave four other similar conferences in homage to François Brousse. The last to date was in Paris on May 25, 1982, and was called "Le génie de François Brousse, sous le triple signe de l’Astronomie, de la Poésie, de la Philosophie&lt;ref&gt;See (Anonymous Author) "Un événement historique : la première conférence d’un andorran à Paris" (A Historical Event : The First Conference by an Andorran in Paris) with photos of  C. Van Dyck (right) and A. Conte (left), Poble Andorra newspaper 2 July 1982, Andorra.&lt;/ref&gt;" (The genius of François Brousse through the tree disciplines of Poetry, Science and Philosophy) with Arthur Conte (who became the representative of the Oriental Pyrenees) giving the introduction and closing. A. Conte, a historian and novelist who saw François Brousse as "passionate about the great mysteries of thought, inspiration, illumination and the universe," awarded him the "plume d’or" (The [[Golden Pen Award]]).

===The Awakening of Individualism (May 1968)===
In May 1968, François Brousse as philosophy professor wrote a jarring article that came out in ''L’Indépendant'' (Perpignan) June 1, 1968 and was called "Le Réveil de l’Individualisme" (The Awakening of Individualism). In this composition, he rejected all idols and fiercely defended the right and necessity to be free and happy :

"''The rise of this earthquake is due to the awakening of the buried giant: individualism. For half a century, we have heard the totalitarian creeds scolding the people, making obedience the ultimate virtue of the nation. ‘Lower your head, slave, and you will be happy. Eat your fare, follow the Government's rules, worship idols and forget your dignity as a free individual!’ The youth responded "No" to this demeaning actuality [...].''

''Respect for practical people must replace the adoration of bloodthirsty, abstract idols rising from capitalism, Marxism, religion and concepts of God or the Devil! Evidently, freedom designed in this manner becomes the unbreakable axis of evolution. A great purifying wind will carry economic or professional feudal systems away. I am particularly thinking of the "Ordre National des Médecins" (French Medical Association), which is a remnant of the Nazi occupation and dictates over all medical practitioners, preventing them from freely healing their patients and restricts rapidly expanding independent research. [...] Neither science nor realism is enough to make people happy. We were aiming for well-being but lacked joy and lost our freedom."''

The Ordre des Médecins with Georges Baillat, the President of its Departmental Counsel, did not delay in publishing their response&lt;ref&gt;Georges Baillat, "En réponse à M. F. Brousse, une mise au point de l’Ordre des Médecins" (In response to Mr. Brousse, a clarification from the Medical Authority). ''L’Indépendant'' Perpignan : 6 June 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; in the June 6th, 1968 edition of L’Indépendant (Perpignan).

===François Brousse on Radio Waves (1981–1989)===
François Brousse's name was first transmitted on May 19th, 1953 when René Espeut delivered a radio conference, "François Brousse l’alchimiste du rêve," from the antennas of "Radiodiffusion Nationale" (the French National Radio) mainly drawing from Brousse's book, ''Les Pèlerins de la nuit'' (The Night Pilgrims) (René Espeut, ''François Brousse le poète aux cent visages'', Ed. Labau, Perpignan, 1954).

In the beginning of January 1979, Brousse participated in the broadcast aired daily by France-Inter "Tout finit par être vrai, une émission qui sort de l’ordinaire," (Everything turns out to be true, a show stepping out of the ordinary) hosted by Henri Gougaud and Jacques Pradel (newspaper ''L’Indépendant'', Perpignan, January 8, 1979).

From 1983, Brousse more frequently appeared on radio interviews, mainly on local channels like "Radio Force 7" and "Radio Cap de la Hève" (Le Havre, 1983), "Radio Midi Soleil" (Perpignan, 1983), "Radio Évasion" (Paris, 1985) and "Radio Bonheur" (Paris, 1986) to whom he spoke during the Salon des Médecines Douces (Alternative Medicine Exposition) and claimed, "the greatest remedy for all illness is poetry."

In 1987, along with Martine Roussard, who directed the weekly radio show, "Conseil en numérologie," (Numerology Advice), Brousse was invited to do an interview by "Radio Bonheur" in January. Later in June, he was asked to come back to answer questions from the listeners about a show on the "Mysteries of the Caribbean."

In 1988 Brousse also appeared on the radio station, "Ici et Maintenant" (93,6&amp;nbsp;MHz) for live interviews on subjects such as religion, freedom and the immortality of the soul. He later came back for the December 1989 show "Science et conscience" where he drew from the philosophies of Pythagoras, Plato, Plotinus etc. Finally, the last burst of François Brousse's poetry was presented on this radio station from March 1990 to November 1990 with "Chants dans l'azur" (Songs in the Blue Sky) for twenty minutes every month.

===Public Homage to Brousse, the Roussillon poet (1982–2005)===
At 9&amp;nbsp;PM on January 12, 1982, the Municipal Theater of Perpignan was showing a play inspired by one of Brousse's poetic works, "Nourished by the secret of the Being's Dimensions and Mysteries&lt;ref name="François Brousse 2005"&gt;''François Brousse l’Enlumineur des mondes'', (François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds). (Saint-Cloud : Ed. Danicel productions, 2005), 429.&lt;/ref&gt;". Eleven aspiring actors rehearsed for four months under Josy Llop from the Dramatic Arts Conservatory of Perpignan. "The play did not go unnoticed and was covered by six articles in ''L’Indépendant'' and three in ''Midi Libre''&lt;ref name="François Brousse 2005"/&gt;" "The city of Perpignan knew how to honor a poet and a thinker&lt;ref&gt;Geneviève Tessan, "Sur un hommage à F. Brousse" (About a Hommage to Brousse), newspaper L’Indépendant, Perpignan: 18 January 1982.&lt;/ref&gt;".

During a commemoration honoring the ten years after the Roussillon poet died, on October 25, 2005 (At the Centro Espagnol, Perpignan, 9&amp;nbsp;PM) Josy Llop embarked on a new play, "Le Livre des Secrets" ([[The Book of Secrets]]) with eight students from the CNR (the National Conservatory of the Region). The students who were from Perpignan, brilliantly interpreted the thoughts and poems of François Brousse and were accompanied by the soft and calming guitar of Francisco Ortiz.

===The Press Perpignan (1981–1995)===
Serious historical research done by Jean-Pierre Wenger&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Pierre Wenger, Conference "François Brousse, Homme-Cosmos du XXe siècle" (François Brousse, the 20th Century Man of the Cosmos). the SONGE Conference in Montpellier, 02-26-2005.&lt;/ref&gt;  in libraries around France (La [[Bibliothèque Nationale de France]] à Paris (The [[National Library of France]] in Paris), la Bibliothèque municipale de Perpignan (The Municipal Library of Perpignan), les Archives départementales des Pyrénées Orientales (The Departmental Archives of the Pyrenees), les Archives nationals ([[The National Archives]]), etc.) ensured the contributions of an author like François Brousse would never be forgotten from the literary stage of the 20th century :

36 magazines were thus able to release about 320 articles concerning him in some manner and 14 newspapers spoke about him in some 240 articles. Other factors to take into consideration are the eighty books published by the author to this day, a substantial amount of unedited manuscripts, not counting the 400 conferences given around France throughout his life and many other recordings. This all exemplifies the prolific dimensions of this inexhaustible character.

Its proof is when, in 1986 the press in Perpignan became especially interested in François Brousse and consecrated at least four consistent articles with evocative titles :

o "François Brousse, un sage de bonne compagnie" (François Brousse, a Friendly Sage) (Jacques Queralt, ''L’Indépendant'', Perpignan, August 19, 1986)

o "L’étoile filante de l’ésotérisme" (The Shooting Star of Esoterism) (Unnamed author, ''Midi Libre'', Perpignan, October 31, 1986)

o "François Brousse l’anarchiste-idéaliste" (François Brousse, the Anarchist-Idealist (''Midi Libre'', Perpignan, November 9, 1986)

o "François Brousse, philosophe et visionnaire" (François Brousse, Philosopher and Visionary) (''Midi Libre'', Perpignan, December 25, 1986)

"''Must we still introduce François Brousse? […] Endowed with a phenomenal memory and level of knowledge, Brousse furthermore separates himself from traditional clairvoyance by this fundamental difference: No consultation office, no speculations about the future. François Brousse goes about like Greek philosophers from many centuries ago. Always surrounded by a loyal entourage, he preaches, makes statements and answers questions. Amongst the privileged meeting areas are cafes, tearooms and reception halls in the largest hotels in Perpignan. But his most certain and consistent meeting point called "le Cénacle" is located on the ground floor of 8, rue de la Lanterne in Perpignan. In this place, parables are decrypted from the Bible and books by Hugo, considered by the master as the greatest visionary of the modern era''." (magazine ''Midi Libre'', Perpignan, December 25th, 1986)

Other articles were found and presented during the Exposition ''François Brousse, la presse et son œuvre'' (François Brousse, the Press and his Work) at the Perpignan multimedia library (December 2006 – January 2007) amongst which were :

o "Le philosophe sur la terrasse" (Philosopher on the Terrace) (magazine ''L’Indépendant'', Perpignan, 08-26-1981)

How could an individual such as François Brousse, so well known and acknowledged in Perpignan, slip through the holed net of the national press during of the internationalization of the media? The documentary ''François Brousse un sage de bonne compagnie ''&lt;ref&gt;Thomas Harlay, director of the documentary, ''François Brousse un sage de bonne compagnie'' (François Brousse, a Friendly Sage). (1h 20), a production of La Compagnie de l’Étoile, Paris, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;(François Brousse, the Friendly Sage) attempts to give elements of these answers. Far from fame, calculated smiles and handshakes, he would not rest until his entourage had understood his only wish was to be read. May be he believed after all in "La force du livre&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Queralt, newspaper ''L’Indépendant'', Perpignan, 19 August 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;" (The Power of Books)? Uninterested by himself, François Brousse dedicated his book to Perfection and Universal Life. He tried "to use the last years of his life to awaken individual consciousness.&lt;ref&gt;Renat Ballabriga, " François Brousse, un anarchiste qui croit en Dieu" (François Brousse, an anarchist who believes in God). Interview. ''Punt Catalunya Nord'' magazine no. 132, Perpignan: 10 November 1989.&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Innovative facets of François Brousse's thought==

=== Studies on Astronomy ===
In 1940 In ''La Cosmogonie des Pa Koua''&lt;ref&gt;Liou Tse Houa. ''La Cosmogonie des Pa Koua et l’astronomie moderne'' – ''Prévision d’une nouvelle planète'' (The Cosmogony of the Pakua and Modern Astronomy – Anticipating a New Planet). Paris : Jouve ed., 1940.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Cosmogony of Pakuas), Liou Tse Houa pictures the existence of a planet called "Proserpine" about 6&amp;nbsp;billion miles from the Sun, beyond Pluto. In May 1948, François Brousse wrote an article in the magazine Destins (Paris, No. 27) called "Pluton et les planètes transplutoniennes" (Pluto and the Transplutonian Planets) in which he suggests the existence of four transplutonian planets : Proserpine, Minerva, Juno and Vesta. This hypothesis is based on the law of Camille Flammarion : "All periodic comets have their aphelion neighboring the orbit of a planet." [Flammarion C., ''Astronomie Populaire'' (Popular Astronomy), Book IV, Ch. IX].

The above astronomical discoveries made these two seekers partially correct because a celestial body filed under the name "2003 UB 313" or "Xena" was discovered in 2005 by the American Michael Brown from negatives dating from 2003 (Jean-François Augereau, "Le système solaire s'enrichit de trois nouvelles planetes, (The Solar System Finds Three New Planets)" newspaper ''Le Monde'', Paris, August 18, 2006).

In 1955, four subsequent articles by Brousse appeared in ''L’Indépendant'' (Perpignan): "L’astronomie des origines à nos jours," (Original Astronomy in our Times) a wide fresco of astronomical discoveries and "À la recherche de mondes nouveaux"(Seeking New Worlds) where he developed his own hypotheses.

Furthermore, Brousse was not indifferent to news of UFO's that the press diffused between 1952 and 1954. More than fifteen articles on the subject appeared in the newspaper L’Indépendant. "Non identified flying objects, as the Americans say, furrowed our atmosphere before the noses of officials. This significant event shook up the people." (Brousse, "Soucoupes volantes à travers les âges", (Flying Saucers Throughout the Ages) newspaper ''Midi Libre'', Perpignan, January 4, 1955). In his article, he considers life on Mars as plausible : "Is there life on Mars? Why not ?" (Newspaper ''L’Indépendant'' Perpignan, November 30, 1954). The possibility of life on another planet in our solar system is approached in ''La Lune fille et mère de la Terre'' (The Moon, Daughter and Mother of the Earth with advanced explanations to understand the mysterious lunar relief (magazine ''Sources Vives'', Perpignan, No. 5, April 1958).

In 1958, still following the law of Flammarion, Brousse enlarged the planetary family with two "trônes de ténèbres" (seats of darkness), Bacchus and Hercules, respectively 33.9 and 79.5&amp;nbsp;billion miles from the Sun (magazine ''Agni'', Perpignan, No. 18, Winter 1958). With flourishing growth, in 1960, he suggested the existence of a new planet named "Flora" 18.6&amp;nbsp;billion miles from the Sun in his book ''De Pythagore à Camille Flammarion'' (From Pythagoras to Camille Flammarion) (magazine ''Sources Vives'', Perpignan, No. 14, Winter 1960). The text builds on his previous writings and follows a hypothesis developed in 1952 by the Italian seismologist [[Raffaele Bendandi|Bendandi]].

Still mentally agile at the end of his life, he enlarged our solar system to 24 planets whose distances and revolutions are specified in ''La Trinosophie de l’Étoile polaire'' (The Polar Star Trinosophia) (Ed. La Licorne Ailée, Clamart, 1990, pgs. 29-30). He took into account links to nuclear magic numbers&lt;ref&gt;"Nuclear Magic Numbers." These numbers (2, 8, 20, 28, 50, 82, 126), discovered by Jensen and Goeppert-Mayer, 1963 Nobel Laureates in Physics, represent the number of protons or neutrons that a Mendeleev periodic table atom must contain to be stable.&lt;/ref&gt;   and the 24 arcana of the Tarot.

===Pythagorean Revelations / Scientific Lucidity===
If there is one book by François Brousse that should be read, it is ''Une Torche aux astres allumée''&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''Une Torche aux astres allumée'' (A Torch Lighted by the Stars). magazine ''Sources Vives'', Perpignan, no.14 (Winter 1960 – 2nd edition) Clamart : La Licorne Ailée, 1989.&lt;/ref&gt; (A Torch Lighted by the Stars). Through its pertinent revelations, it is about the life and the mysteries of Pythagoras.

From the first lines in the first chapter we learn that Pythagoras had the "invaluable honor" of revealing "the idea of the transmigration of souls, the key to the world." We also learn that this was a "fundamental truth" to the Hellenes people and to "Empedocles, Aeschylus, Plato, Virgil, Ovid, Porphyry and Lamblichus, who all drank deeply from this eternal source of truth. The sage Pherecydes, a visionary philosopher, was his master ; he went in search of the Truth in Egypt where he experienced the "midnight sun and the face of Hermes" ; he met Ezekiel in Chaldea, a titanic effusion of these "two poles of the world" ; that he explored "the secret sanctuaries of India" where he "met the true sages who were perfected men" ; and that finally, "he wanted to visit the sages of the Occident, the Druids with golden scythes" holding "the sayings of Ogmios."

We also learn that Pythagoras incarnated as Aetalide, the son of Mercury and guider of souls, Euphorbus a Trojan hero, Hermotimus of Clazomenae, and Pyrrhus, a fisherman from Delos, fascinated by this "sacred island".

In ''Une Torche aux astres allumée'', François Brousse questions the fundamentals of science at that time : The impossibility of a particle to go as fast and even less likely, to go faster than the speed of light.
Yet, this impassable threshold was obliterated in 1996 : "Modern physics holds the speed of light as an insurmountable barrier. A German laboratory has nevertheless succeeded in making a particle travel 4.7 times faster than the speed of light.&lt;ref&gt;Julian Brown, "Le mur de la lumière est franchi" (The Wall of Light has been Passed) magazine ''Sciences et avenir'', No. 588, February 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;"

After having anticipated this stage, François Brousse mentions the following step in the same book : "Once having passed the wall of light, Time and Matter change dimensions. Time, after having reached the zero point, reverses its trajectory and goes back into the past. It enters into a collection of negative numbers. It leaves the future and quiets in destruction. Antimatter is precisely matter in a reversed time line."
His perspicuous idea furthermore proposes an audacious string of changes: "Matter transforms into energy, energy into desire, desire into thought and thought into eternity.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''Sub Rosa – Pensées sans entraves'' (Sub Rosa – Thoughts with no Limits) (2nd éd.), in magazine ''B. M. P.'', No. 113-114, June–July 1993, Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée.&lt;/ref&gt;"

===Parallel Worlds===
In addition to reincarnation and metempsychosis, coexists the concept of parallel lives : In the depths of immensity, there are "Earths" with different rotation speeds in the billions of solar systems similar to our own and inhabited with populations similar to us. On these parallel Earths and amongst these peoples are different forms of Me. They are different and yet connected to my multiple being, living their parallel lives. I have a much desired job that is not manifested in your world ; I live in the country of my choice, I marry another companion, I meet the famous painters who I admire, I partake in unthinkable expeditions, I have access to long disappeared books and so on. By doing so, every wish that is born manifests in one of these parallel worlds at that very moment.

There are at least two purposes of parallel lives tied, according to François Brousse, to the number 777. Firstly, multiple lives on multiple dimensions help eliminate any frustration when we manage to feel it deeply by satisfying our desires in other dimensions. Is this a cheep consolation? "Why would you want it to be expensive?" replies François Brousse.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, Interview, Paris, 24 July 1985.&lt;/ref&gt;

By considering life in dimension rather than in length, "past lives" are no longer successive but simultaneous. In a planet rotating slower than our own, this parallel life occurs in what we consider our past.
Likewise, if the speed of the parallel planet's rotation is faster than ours, then this parallel life is considered as our future. Someone with a sharp mind could thus explain premonitory dreams and signs as communication from this so-called "future" world to our so-called "present" world.

Parallel worlds are a way to access the fourth dimension and push our "Here and Now" consciousness to consider "Everywhere and Forever." It considers the soul to be One and Many and can be compared to a totem pole with 777 juxtaposed faces or better yet, a building with 777 stories, each level occupied by 777 "Me’s".
"Reality is narrow and possibility is immense," Alphonse de Lamartine would say. François Brousse responded, "I am not something real and isolated but all possibilities realized.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, "Réponse à un Chéla – 4/4 – Notre apparition sur la Terre ne nous transmet qu’une possibilité restreinte […]" (Answers to a Chela – 4/4 – Our Existence on Earth only gives us one limited possibility), magazine ''B. M. P.'', No. 123-124, June–July 1994, Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée."&lt;/ref&gt;"

===Victor Hugo, the unrecognized Prophet===
From the age of fifteen, François Brousse admired Victor Hugo to whom he dedicated the opuscule ''La Poésie de Victor Hugo''&lt;ref&gt;BROUSSE François, ''La poésie de Victor Hugo'', Revue ''B. M. P.'', N°226-230, octobre-décembre 2003 – janvier-février 2004, Éd. La Licorne Ailée, Clamart&lt;/ref&gt; (Victor Hugo's Poetry). After, he discovered the greatness of Victor Hugo who foresaw the [[First World War]] particularly with two noteworthy phrases : "Verdun, premier rempart de la France alarmée&lt;ref&gt;HUGO Victor, ''Odes et ballades'', « Ode Troisième – Les Vierges de Verdun » [1828, 4ème éd.]&lt;/ref&gt;" (Verdun, the first ramparts of an alarmed France) ; "Enseignons à nos fils à creuser des tranchées&lt;ref&gt;HUGO Victor, ''La Légende des siècles'', « L’élégie des fléaux », Éd. Hetzel, Bruxelles, 1859&lt;/ref&gt;" (Teach our sons to dig in the trenches).

His in-depth research of Hugo's book allowed him to publish the article, "Les Tours de la nuit" (Night Tours) in the May 1939 edition of the magazine Astrosophie. In this article, he announces the fall of the fascist dictators. It was easy for him to recognize the führer Adolf Hitler: "[…] A man with the eyes of a wolf, nothing to him but his mustache […] " in the capturing snapshots Victor Hugo gives in "La Vision de Dante" within ''La Légende des siècles'' (The Legend of Ages), where a monstrous despot is described in vivid images.

To complete this historical background, in ''Les Châtiments'', the diatribe entitled "Ad Majoram Dei Gloriam" appeared and the threefold Pétainiste slogan "Work, Family, Patrimony" magnificently joined with: "Priests, we will write upon a brilliant flag/ Order, Religion, Property, Family."

In his essay ''Les Secrets kabbalistiques de Victor Hugo'',&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''Les Secrets kabbalistiques de Victor Hugo'' (The Kabalistic Secrets of Victor Hugo), Ed La Licorne Ailée, Clamart, 1985&lt;/ref&gt; which pertinently touches on the poet's intimate notes, François Brousse describes Victor Hugo as a "Prodigious character, a centaur of the infinite, Janus of the incredible world, a siren in the ocean of skies and a tetramorph sphinx lying on the brink of chasms. This unfathomable master appears as such, where all rivers of inspiration cross with the turmoil of glory and rapture."

===Cycles and Prophecies===
The cyclical nature of events regulates human life, people, humanities and the cosmos. This cycle connects with the idea of successive lives through which humans fully attain their ultimate ideal in the domains of Wisdom, Love and Beauty and when accomplished, marks the end of their return to Earth.

The cycles regulate the atom's vortex and the massive take-off of galaxies. [...] History, like all subject areas, follows the law of rhythm. Man breathes. Humanity, which is a Big Man, also breathes. To know the breaths of History is to hold the keys of the future. This is the sign of true prophets from Daniel to Hugo and Nostradamus. [François Brousse, ''Nostradamus ressuscité'' (Nostradamus Resuscitated), vol. 2, Ed. La Licorne Ailée, Clamart, pg. 62]

François Brousse came into the arena of prophesy in May 1939 with the article "Les tours de la nuit" in the magazine ''Astrosophie'' (Nice, No. 5). This article was the result of his enthusiastic reflections on prophetic texts by Hugo describing the second world conflict, its outcome and the fall of Fascism.

In 1940–1945, his constant focus on Nostradamus led to the discovery of historical cycles that not only confirm his previous conclusions but also specify the year of the war's ending in 1945.

Using the pseudonym Charles Amazan, François Brousse put the great prophecy and hope of Victor Hugo into his own words in 1945 concerning the building of Europe, which he supported [''L’Avenir des peuples'' (The Future of Humanity), Perpignan].

Still concerning the subject of cycles his article, "Le secret des tombes royales," appeared in the magazine ''Destins'' (Paris, No. 16-27, May 1947 – May 1948). It explains humanity's future throughout the history of the Kings of France with a very critical period around 2015.

Are cycles a force from which we cannot be released ? The answer depends :

''A man who is alone is free; he can confront the strength of the stars. But a nation, race or group is always enslaved and endures the whims of the heavens. Free will can scarcely delay fatal catastrophes by a few years. Nevertheless, a lucid government driven by sincere pacifism can circumvent the fire. In this case, the passionate warrior agonizes in colonial rule rather than setting the world aflame.'' (François Brousse, magazine ''Destins'', Paris, No. 14, March 1947).

In 1949, he wrote ''La Prophétie des papes'' (The Prophesy of Popes), which would remain unpublished for about thirty years until 1981. In his eyes, the reduced number of popes in the future would confirm the next end of humanity. In 1965, he came out with ''Les Clés de Nostradamus'' (The Keys of Nostradamus) (magazine ''Sources Vives'', No. 32, Perpignan) in which he announced the departure of General [[Charles de Gaulle]] in 1969, four years beforehand.

His fascination with prophesies drove him to examine a large number of dark texts like the prophesies of Brother Johannes, Saint Odile (1940), Isaïe (1967), Plaisance (1967), Saint Kosmas de l’Étolie, Padre Pio (Conference in Perpignan, 1979), the secret of Fatima (1977, 1980), etc., of which some commentaries appear in ''La septième Erreur de l’humanité'' (The Seventh Error of Humanity) (Ed. La Licorne Ailée, Clamart, 1991).

At the beginning of the 1980s, he added numerology to the concept of cycles by using the "theosophical sum" of an ordinary year to obtain an original prophetic method. Thus during the winter of every year he had the pleasure of creating prophesies for the coming year. These were sometimes published : in the newspaper ''Midi Libre'' (Perpignan, Dec. 30th, 1985; Dec. 27th, 1986; Feb. 4th, 1987), the magazine ''L’Inconnu'' (Paris, No. 117, Feb. 1986) and others.

François Brousse forcefully protested the ambient pessimism foreshadowing a world war for 1983–1984 (magazine ''L’Inconnu'', Paris, 1980 – magazine ''Paris-Match'', Paris, 1982). He also opposed erroneous interpretations of Nostradamus [("Le Pape sera-t-il assassiné à Lyon ?" (Will the Pope be assassinated in Lyon?) in ''Le Monde inconnu'', Paris, No. 75, Sept]. 1986). Finally, he surprisingly announced the year of his own death twenty-three years before its arrival.

===Yearly Celebration of Wesak===
In 1981–1995, François Brousse published accounts of experiences he had had during the spiritual Buddhist celebrations of Wesak in the month of May marking the three main events of Buddha's life (birth, awakening and death).

In addition to the twenty-four wise men&lt;ref&gt;Cf. List in Jean-Pierre Wenger’s biography, ''François Brousse l’Enlumineur des mondes'' (François Brousse, The Enlightener of Worlds), (Saint-Cloud : Ed. Danicel productions, 2005) 399-416 (Ch. 35).&lt;/ref&gt; – held in humanity's collective memory of civilization and who work under the arm of Sanat Kumara not from the physical but spiritual and astral dimensions of the Himalayas – all those who are able to travel there in spirit are present. Amida Bouddha – one of the stars of the Buddhist Pantheon – also manifests to deliver a universal message.

===Amalekite Astrology===
Taking into consideration the precession of the equinoxes, François Brousse recommended a new type of astrology called "Amalekite astrology&lt;ref&gt;BROUSSE François, « Dialogues avec François Brousse », Revue ''Dialogues'', N°54, août-septembre 1984&lt;/ref&gt;" in which the Sun of two signs retrogrades. It is further described in Dan Languillier's book, ''Alpheratz le Navire des étoiles'' (Alpheratz, the Star Navigator).&lt;ref&gt;LANGUILLIER Dan, ''Alpheratz le Navire des étoiles'', Imp. Sarl ACBE Copy Media, Mérignac, 2009 – Édité par l’Association Astrellis.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Tree of Life and Eternity===
"''The Kabala, a science of universal analogies, the golden and steel links between letters, numbers, ideas, constellations, planets, colors, sounds, flavors, smells, touch, and geometric shapes unfurls a forest of pillars both colossal and magic like a Hindu temple. […] If Hebrew is magnificent, Sanskrit is superhuman, Greek is sublime, Latin is divine and French receives the reflection of the Sun of suns in the wonderful lake of its linguistic essence''.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''L’Arbre de vie et d’éternité'' (The Tree of Life and Eternity). (Clamart : La Licorne Ailée, 1992), 7.&lt;/ref&gt;"

From then on François Brousse developed a type of French gematria where every letter corresponds to a number. According to the normal scale set by custom and taken from the depth of cosmic thought: A = 1; B = 2, etc. "To obtain the number of a word, we must add all the letters to reach the secret sum or the occult murmur. At this point we can see a correspondence with twenty-two major arcana of the Tarot, a book with wondrous pages.&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''L’Arbre de vie et d’éternité'' (The Tree of Life and Eternity), (Clamart: Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1992) 7-9.&lt;/ref&gt;"

===Polar Yoga===
During special circumstances in 1938, 1953 and 1966 François Brousse channeled a collection of methods linking meditations, breathing techniques and visualizations. He brought them together in ''Le Yoga polaire''&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''Le Yoga polaire'' (The Polar Yoga), Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; (The Polar Yoga) in which he explains unsuspected powers. "Through all of these methods, we can, and I repeat, go beyond the entire wheel of our incarnations in one life and soar towards attaining immortality, which burns all our karma and takes us up to the infinite glory of the divine dimension. We must discover our-Self within ourselves&lt;ref&gt;François Brousse, ''La Trinosophie de l’Étoile polaire'' (The Polar Star Trinosophia), (Clamart : Ed. La Licorne Ailée, 1990), 42.&lt;/ref&gt;"

==Literary works==
François Brousse's literary work can be found in the Bibliothèque nationale de France (the National Library of France in Paris) and all of his books are available from La Licorne Ailée association.

Editions de la Licorne Ailée was founded in 1982 to promote and distribute the work of François Brousse. Older versions of his work before 1982 were generally reedited by Éditions de la Licorne Ailée and if not mentioned otherwise, this edition house also edited works after 1982.

In [[Hinduism]], there are diverse approaches to conceptualizing [[Gender of God|God and gender]]. Many Hindus focus upon impersonal [[Absolute (philosophy)|Absolute]] ([[Brahman]]) which is genderless. Other Hindu traditions conceive God as androgynous (both female and male), alternatively as either male or female, while cherishing gender [[henotheism]], that is without denying the existence of other Gods in either gender.&lt;ref&gt;John Renard (1999), Responses to 101 Questions on Hinduism, Paulist, {{ISBN|978-0809138456}}, pages 74-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Google books|9XC9bwMMPcwC|What is Hinduism?|page=PR17}}, Hinduism Today, Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Shakti]] tradition conceives of God as a female. Other [[Bhakti]] traditions of Hinduism have both male and female gods. In ancient and medieval Indian mythology, each masculine [[Deva (Hinduism)|deva]] of the Hindu pantheon is partnered with a feminine who is often a [[devi]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adishakti.org/forum/concept_of_shakti_hinduism_as_a_liberating_force_for_women_1-18-2005.htm The Concept of Shakti: Hinduism as a Liberating Force for Women]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Hinduism}}
Male and female deities are extensively mentioned in the Vedas. The earliest ''mandalas'' ("Books"; the authorship of each ''mandala'' is traditionally ascribed to a particular ''[[rishi]]'' or that ''rishi'''s family) of the [[Rigveda]], estimated to have been composed sometime in the 2nd millennium BCE, invoke and praise both gods and goddesses. ''[[Ushas]]'' ("Goddess of Dawns") is praised in twenty Hymns of Chapters VI.64, VI.65, VII.78 and X.172, with Hymn VI.64.5 declaring goddess Ushas as the one who must be worshipped first.&lt;ref name=davidk/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/rigvedasanhitac00websgoog#page/n19/mode/2up Rigveda] Hymn VI.64.5, HH Wilson (Translator), Trubner &amp; Co London, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quote|
'''Hymn to Ushas''' (Abridged):&lt;br&gt;
The shining tints of the Dawn have spread like the waves of the waters,&lt;br&gt;
Beautifying the world, she renders all good roads easy to traverse,&lt;br&gt;
She who is replete with delight, excellence and health,&lt;br&gt;
Divine Ushas, though art seen auspicious, thou shinest afar,&lt;br&gt;
thy bright rays spread over the sky, lovely and radiant with great splendour;&lt;br&gt;
Do thou Ushas bring me opulence, daughter of heaven;&lt;br&gt;
thou who art divine, who art lovely, who art to be worshipped at the first daily rite;&lt;br&gt;
At thy dawning, divine Ushas, birds fly from their resting places, men arise to work;&lt;br&gt;
Thou, divine Ushas, bring ample wealth to the mortal, the offerer of these prayers.
|Rigveda|VI.64&lt;ref&gt;
*Original Sanskrit: '''एषा''' स्या नो दुहिता दिवोजाः क्षितीरुच्छन्ती मानुषीरजीगः । या भानुना रुशता राम्यास्वज्ञायि तिरस्तमसश्चिदक्तून् ॥१॥ वि तद्ययुररुणयुग्भिरश्वैश्चित्रं '''भान्त्युषसश्चन्द्ररथाः''' । अग्रं यज्ञस्य बृहतो नयन्तीर्वि ता बाधन्ते तम ऊर्म्यायाः ॥२॥ (...) इदा हि त '''उषो''' अद्रिसानो गोत्रा गवामङ्गिरसो गृणन्ति । व्यर्केण बिभिदुर्ब्रह्मणा च सत्या नृणामभवद्देवहूतिः ॥५॥ '''उच्छा''' दिवो दुहितः प्रत्नवन्नो भरद्वाजवद्विधते मघोनि । सुवीरं रयिं गृणते रिरीह्युरुगायमधि धेहि श्रवो नः ॥६॥ (Source: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/ऋग्वेद:_सूक्तं_६.६५ ऋग्वेद: सूक्तं ६.६५] Wikisource)
*English Translation: [https://archive.org/stream/rigvedasanhitac00websgoog#page/n19/mode/2up Rigveda] Hymn VI.64.5, HH Wilson (Translator), Trubner &amp; Co London, page 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Goddesses, other than Ushas, mentioned in early Vedic literature include ''Prthivi'' (earth), ''Aditi'' (mother of gods, abundance), ''Sarasvati'' (river, nourishment), ''Vac'' (sound and speech), and ''Nirrti'' (death, destruction).&lt;ref name=davidk/&gt; Similarly male gods feature prominently in the Vedas, with ''Indra'' (rain, lightning), ''Agni'' (fire), ''Varuna'' (rta, law), ''Dyaus'' (sky, virility), ''Savitr'' (''Surya'', sun), and ''Soma'' (drink) some of the most mentioned. The two deities most mentioned in Rigveda are [[Indra]] and [[Agni]], both male.&lt;ref&gt;David R. Kinsley (1986), Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520053939}}, pages 6-8&lt;/ref&gt; Surya is the third most revered god, again a male.&lt;ref name=wjw&gt;William Joseph Wilkins, {{Google books|ZBUHAAAAQAAJ|Hindu Mythology: Vedic and Purānic|page=8}}, London Missionary Society, Calcutta&lt;/ref&gt; Each is mentioned, anywhere rain and fire is evoked. They are profusely praised, with ceremonies and prayers to all gods and goddesses symbolically organized around fire (Agni [[yajna]]). The hymns seek strengthening of fire, and it is god Indra who increases the energy of the fire, while god Surya increases his brightness.  [[Max Muller]] states that, while there are difference in frequency of mentions, gods and goddesses in Rig veda are "neither superior nor inferior; almost every one is represented as supreme and absolute".&lt;ref name=wjw/&gt;

Gross states that ancient and medieval Hindu literature is richly endowed with gods, goddesses and androgynous representations of God.&lt;ref name=rmg&gt;RM Gross (1978), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1463798 Hindu Female Deities as a Resource for the Contemporary Rediscovery of the Goddess], Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 46, No. 3 (Sep., 1978), pages 269-291&lt;/ref&gt; This, states Gross, is in contrast with several monotheistic religions, where God is often synonymous with "He" and theism is replete with male anthropomorphisms.&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt; In Hinduism, goddess-imagery does not mean loss of male-god, rather the ancient literature presents the two genders as balancing each other and complementary. The Goddesses in Hinduism, states Gross,&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt; are strong, beautiful and confident, symbolizing their vitality in cycle of life. While masculine Gods are symbolically represented as those who act, the feminine Goddesses are symbolically portrayed as those who inspire action.&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt; Goddesses in Hinduism are envisioned as the patrons of arts, culture, nurture, learning, arts, joys, spirituality and liberation.&lt;ref name=davidk&gt;David R. Kinsley (1986), Hindu Goddesses: Visions of the Divine Feminine in the Hindu Religious Tradition, University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520053939}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt;

God is not either male or female concept in ancient Indian literature. Androgynous concepts of god are common place as well.&lt;ref name=rmg/&gt;

===Brahman===
Most major schools of [[Hindu philosophy]] focus their philosophical discourse on the [[Absolute (philosophy)|Universal Absolute]], called [[Brahman]], which is a grammatically genderless noun.&lt;ref name=hrz&gt;Heinrich Robert Zimmer (1972), Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization, Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|978-0691017785}}, pages 123-128&lt;/ref&gt; This Universal Absolute, states Zimmer, is "beyond the differentiating qualifications of sex, beyond any and all limitations, individualizing characteristics whatsoever". The ''Brahman'' is the Great Cosmic Spirit, the Ultimate True Reality, the Supreme Self. It is a transcendental concept that includes all virtues, forms, genders, characteristics, capacities, knowledge and being-ness.&lt;ref name=hrz/&gt; The history of the genderless concept of Brahman, as the omnipresent Absolute Spirit and Supreme Self, can be traced back to Vedas, and extensively in the earliest Upanishads, such as hymns 1.4.10 and 4.4.5 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad,&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: [http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद् बृहदारण्यकोपनिषद्] Wikisource;&lt;br&gt;English Translation Hymn 1.4.10: [https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n171/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad - 1.4.10] pages 145-146;&lt;br&gt;English Translation Hymn 4.4.5: [https://archive.org/stream/Brihadaranyaka.Upanishad.Shankara.Bhashya.by.Swami.Madhavananda#page/n739/mode/2up Brihadaranyaka Upanishad - 4.4.5] pages 712-713;&lt;/ref&gt; and hymn 6.2.1 of Chandogya Upanishad 6.2.1.&lt;ref&gt;Original Sanskrit: सर्वं खल्विदं ब्रह्म तज्जलानिति शान्त उपासीत । अथ खलु क्रतुमयः पुरुषो यथाक्रतुरस्मिँल्लोके पुरुषो भवति तथेतः प्रेत्य भवति स क्रतुं कुर्वीत ॥ १ ॥ ([http://sa.wikisource.org/wiki/छान्दोग्योपनिषद्_२ छान्दोग्योपनिषद्] Wikisource);&lt;br&gt;English Translation 1: All this indeed is '''Brahman'''. From It the universe comes forth, in It the universe merges, and in It the universe breathes. Therefore a man should meditate on Brahman with a calm mind. Now, a man consists of free will. As he wills in this world, so does he become. Let him, with this knowledge in mind, form his free will. ([http://www.bharatadesam.com/spiritual/upanishads/chandogya_upanishad.php Chandogya Upanishad The Sandilya Doctrine - 3.14.1]);&lt;br&gt;English Translation 2: [https://archive.org/stream/Shankara.Bhashya-Chandogya.Upanishad-Ganganath.Jha.1942.English#page/n165/mode/2up Chandogya Upanishad III.xiv.1] GN Jha (Translator), page 151&lt;/ref&gt;

Zimmer clarifies the notion of gender in Sanskrit language and its relation to the concepts of Brahman and God in Hinduism, as follows:

{{Quote|
It must be understood that in Sanskrit, grammatical gender is not always a sign of physical sex. Gender infers function, sex infers form; so that an individual&lt;ref&gt;man or woman&lt;/ref&gt; may be masculine from one point of view and feminine from another. (...) Brahman can be regarded as the "womb" of life, and as in Christianity "this man" and "this woman" are equally "feminine to God" [in Hinduism]. Absolutely, Brahman, although grammatically neuter, is the principle of all such differentiation. Essence and nature are respectively masculine and feminine, logically distinct, but "one in God," who is neither this nor that [in Hinduism], and therefore "It" rather than "He" or "She" specifically.
|[[Heinrich Zimmer]]|Myths and Symbols in Indian Art and Civilization&lt;ref name=hrz/&gt;}}

==Mythology==
Hindu mythology incorporates numerous devas (gods) and devis (goddesses). These are symbolic stories that synthesize God and gender, with ideas and values. The [[Vishnu Purana]], for example, recites one such myth describes male gods and female goddesses with names that is loaded with symbolism. An excerpt of the story is as follows,&lt;ref name=vp/&gt;

{{Quote|
The progeny of [[Dharma]] by the daughters of Daksha were as follows: by Sraddhá (devotion) he had [[Kama]] (desire); by Lakshmí (wealth, prosperity), was born Darpa (pride); by Dhriti (courage), the progeny was [[Niyama]] (precept); by Tusht́i (inner comfort), Santosha (contentment); by Pusht́i (opulence), the progeny was Lobha (cupidity, greed); by Medhá (wisdom, experience), Sruta (sacred tradition); by Kriyá (hard work, labour), the progeny were Dańd́a, Naya, and Vinaya (justice, politics, and education); by Buddhi (intellect), Bodha (understanding); by Lajjá (shame, humility), Vinaya (good behaviour); by Vapu (body, strength), Vyavasaya (perseverance). Shanti (peace) gave birth to Kshama (forgiveness); Siddhi (excellence) to Sukha (enjoyment); and Kírtti (glorious speech) gave birth to Yasha (reputation). These were the sons of Dharma; one of whom, Kama (love, emotional fulfillment) had baby Hersha (joy) by his wife Nandi (delight).

The wife of Adharma (vice, wrong, evil) was Hinsá (violence), on whom he begot a son Anrita (falsehood), and a daughter Nikriti (immorality): they intermarried, and had two sons, Bhaya (fear) and Naraka (hell); and twins to them, two daughters, Máyá (deceit) and Vedaná (torture), who became their wives. The son of Bhaya (fear) and Máyá (deceit) was the destroyer of living creatures, or Mrityu (death); and Dukha (pain) was the offspring of Naraka (hell) and Vedaná (torture). The children of Mrityu were Vyádhi (disease), Jará (decay), Soka (sorrow), Trishńa (greediness), and Krodha (wrath). These are all called the inflictors of misery, and are characterised as the progeny of Vice (Adharma). They are all without wives, without posterity, without the faculty to procreate; they perpetually operate as causes of the destruction of this world. On the contrary, Daksha and the other Rishis, the elders of mankind, tend perpetually to influence its renovation: whilst the Manus and their sons, the heroes endowed with mighty power, and treading in the path of truth, as constantly contribute to its preservation.|Vishnu Purana|Chapter 7, Translated by [[Horace Hayman Wilson]]&lt;ref name=vp&gt;[http://www.sacred-texts.com/hin/vp/vp041.htm Vishnu Purana] Chapter 7&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Examples==
{{refimprove section|date=February 2015}}

=== Smarta and Advaita ===
The [[Smarta]] tradition, which by and large, follows [[Advaita]] philosophy believes all forms, male and female, to be different forms of the impersonal Absolute, [[Brahman]] which is of neuter gender and can never be defined.
Brahman is viewed as without personal attributes ([[Nirguna Brahman]]) or with attributes ([[Saguna Brahman]], equated with [[Ishvara]]) as [[God]]. In [[Advaita Vedanta]], Ishvara is Brahman. Thus according to [[Smarta]] views, the divine can be with attributes, [[Saguna Brahman]], and also be viewed with whatever attributes, (e.g., a goddess) a devotee conceives.

===Siva and Vishnu===
In [[Vaishnavism]] and [[Shaivism]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dvaita.org/docs/srv_faq.html#who= Dvaita Documentation: Vaishnava FAQ&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shaivam.org/shpintro.htm Shaivam - An Introduction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; God, [[Vishnu]] or [[Shiva]] respectively, is personified as male. God, however, transcends gender in these sub-schools, and the male form is used as an icon to help focus the [[Puja (Hinduism)|Puja]] (worship). The use of icons is not restricted to male forms. It takes various forms and shapes. The Shaivites and Vaishnavites worship God in non-anthropomorphic, symbolic male-female images as well, such as the [[linga]]-[[yoni]] and [[Sila (murti)|Saligram]] respectively. In their literature, the principle of God's true nature as sexless is emphasized as in the [[Vishnu sahasranama]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Thus, the first few names,{{which|date=February 2015}} of Vishnu sahasranama, in particular, do not describe features of Vishnu in detail and hence are not [[anthropomorphic]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== Shakti ===
[[Shaktism]], on the other hand, is a denomination of Hinduism that worships [[Shakti]], or [[Devi]] [[Mother goddess|Mata]]—the Hindu name for the [[Mother goddess|Great Divine Mother]]—in all of her forms whilst not rejecting the importance of masculine and neuter divinity (which are however deemed to be inactive in the absence of the Shakti). In pure Shaktism, the Great Goddess, or [[Mahadevi|Devi]], is worshiped. N. N. Bhattacharyya{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} explained that "[those] who worship the Supreme Deity exclusively as a Female Principle are called [[Shakta]].{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

Alternative interpretations of Shaktism, however—primarily those of [[Shaivite]] scholars, such as [[Satguru Sivaya Subramuniyaswami]]—argue that the feminine manifest is ultimately only the vehicle through which the masculine Un-manifest [[Parasiva]] is ultimately reached.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}}

=== Radha Krishna ===
{{main|Radha Krishna}}
The common separation of Sakti and Saktiman, i.e. Female and Male principle in god arrives at the conclusion Sakti and Saktiman are the same.&lt;ref&gt;Surendranath Dasgupta,A History of Indian Philosophy (1991) p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; Each and every god has its partner, 'better-half' or Sakti and without this Sakti he is sometimes viewed being without essential power.&lt;ref&gt;Santilata Dei, Del Santilata, Vaisnavism in Orissa (1988) p. 167&lt;/ref&gt; In some Bhakti schools, devotees of Hinduism worship both genders as a God-pair, rather than a specific gender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Beck, Guy L. |title=Alternative Krishnas: regional and vernacular variations on a Hindu deity |publisher=State University of New York Press |location=Albany, N.Y |year=2005 |isbn=0-7914-6415-6 |oclc= |doi= |pages=[https://books.google.com/books?id=0SJ73GHSCF8C&amp;pg=PA68&amp;dq=Radha+is+supreme&amp;ei=PTeWSLa_BouCjwGTyY2sDQ&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=ACfU3U0UsEEDGzKto2Ryf-_UW0R2kzuyRw p. 68]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kakoli Basak, (1991) Rabindranath Tagore, a Humanist - p. 11&lt;/ref&gt;

From the Vaishnava point of view the divine feminine energy (''Shakti'') implies a divine source of energy, i.e. God as ''shaktiman''. "Sita relates to [[Rama]]; [[Lakshmi]] belongs to [[Narayana]]; [[Radha]] has Her [[Krishna]]." The female, in these pairs, is viewed as the source of energy and essence of the male.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Rosen|2002|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dave Symmons (1998), This is Hinduism, Nelson Thornes, {{ISBN|978-0748730933}}, page 20&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Stella Kramrisch (1975), The Indian Great Goddess, History of Religions, Vol. 14, No. 4, pages 260-263&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the prominent features of Vaishnavism in Manipur, for example, is the worship of the two genders together. Devotees do not worship Krishna alone, or Radha alone, but Radha-Krishna.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=g-wbAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Manipur+Radha&amp;dq=Manipur+Radha&amp;lr=&amp;client=firefox-a Encyclopaedia of Indian Literature - p. 4290], Amaresh Datta, Mohan Lal,1994&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Rasa (theology)|Rasa]]'' and other dances are a feature of the regional [[Folk religion|folk]] and religious tradition and often, for example, a female dancer will portray both 'male' Krishna and his consort, Radha, in the same piece.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Schwartz|2004|p=35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such people were called ''Gottgläubige'', and the term for the overall movement was ''Gottgläubigkeit''. The term denotes someone who still believes in a God, although without having any [[Organized religion|institutional religious]] affiliation. The [[Nazi Party|Nazis]] were not favourable towards religious institutions, nor did they tolerate [[atheism]] on the part of their membership: ''Gottgläubigkeit'' was a kind of officially sanctioned unorganised religion. The 1943 ''Philosophical Dictionary'' defined ''gottgläubig'' as: "official designation for those who profess a specific kind of piety and morality, without being bound to a church denomination, whilst however also rejecting [[irreligion]] and godlessness."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= |first= |date=1943 |title=Philosophisches Wörterbuch Kröners Taschenausgabe.

Cited in Cornelia Schmitz-Berning, 2007, p. 281 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1939 census, 3.5% of the German population identified as ''gottgläubig''.&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt;

== Origins ==
{{See also|Kirchenkampf}}
In the 1920 [[National Socialist Program]] of the [[Nazi Party|National Socialist German Workers' Party]] (NSDAP), [[Adolf Hitler]] first mentioned the phrase "[[Positive Christianity]]". The Party did not wish to tie itself to a particular [[Christian denomination]], but with Christianity in general, and sought [[freedom of religion]] for all denominations "so long as they do not endanger its existence or oppose the moral senses of the [[Germanic race]]."

When Hitler and the NSDAP got into power in 1933, they sought to assert state control over the churches, on the one hand through the [[Reichskonkordat]] with the [[Catholic Church]], and the forced merger of the [[German Evangelical Church Confederation]] into the [[Protestant Reich Church]] on the other. This policy seems to have gone relatively well until late 1936, when a "gradual worsening of relations" between the Nazi Party and the churches saw the rise of ''Kirchenaustritt'' ("leaving the church").&lt;ref name="Steigmann"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Steigmann-Gall |first=Richard |date=2003 |title=The Holy Reich: Nazi Conceptions of Christianity, 1919–1945 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RreXLeUG_AIC&amp;pg=PA219 |location=Cambridge |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=219 |isbn=9780521823715 |accessdate=23 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although there was no top-down official directive to revoke church membership, some Nazi Party members started doing so voluntarily and put other members under pressure to follow their example.&lt;ref name="Steigmann"/&gt; Those who left the churches were designated as ''Gottgläubige'' ("believers in God"), a term officially recognised by the Interior Minister [[Wilhelm Frick]] on 26 November 1936. He stressed that the term signified political disassociation from the churches, not an act of [[Apostasy in Christianity|religious apostasy]].&lt;ref name="Steigmann"/&gt; The term "dissident", which some church leavers had used up until them, was associated with being "without belief" (''glaubenslos''), whilst most of them emphasised they still believed in God and thus required a different word.&lt;ref name="Steigmann"/&gt;

The Nazi Party ideologue [[Alfred Rosenberg]] was the first to leave his church&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg was baptised in the Lutheran [[St. Nicholas' Church, Tallinn]] shortly after his birth.&lt;/ref&gt; in November 1933, but for the next three years he would be the only prominent Nazi leader to do so.&lt;ref name="Steigmann"/&gt; In early 1936, [[Schutzstaffel|SS]] leaders [[Heinrich Himmler]] and [[Reinhard Heydrich]] terminated their membership of the Catholic Church, followed by a number of ''[[Gauleiter]]'' including [[Martin Mutschmann]] ([[Gau Sachsen|Saxony]]), [[Carl Röver]] ([[Gau Weser-Ems|Weser-Ems]]) and [[Robert Heinrich Wagner]] ([[Gau Baden|Baden]]).&lt;ref name="Steigmann"/&gt; In late 1936, especially Catholic party members left the church, followed in 1937 by a flood of primarily Protestant party members.&lt;ref name="Steigmann"/&gt; Hitler himself never repudiated his membership of the Catholic Church;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tRBrjt7z5Cw |title=Hitchens on Hitler |author=[[Christopher Hitchens]] |via=YouTube |date=22 December 2007 |accessdate=24 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1941, he told his General [[Gerhard Engel]]: "I am now as before a Catholic and will always remain so."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last=Toland |first=John |date=1992 |title=Adolf Hitler: The Definitive Biography |location=New York |publisher=Anchor Publishing |page=507 |isbn=978-0385420532}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People who identified as ''gottgläubig'' could hold a wide range of religious beliefs, including non-clerical Christianity,&lt;ref name="Steigmann"/&gt; [[Germanic neopaganism]],&lt;ref name="Steigmann"/&gt; [[deism]],&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt; and [[pantheism]].&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt; Strictly speaking, ''Gottgläubigen'' were not even required to terminate their church membership, but strongly encouraged to.&lt;ref&gt;Steigmann-Gall, p. 221–222.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the decree of the [[Federal Ministry of the Interior (Germany)|Reich Ministry of the Interior]] of 26 November 1936, this religious descriptor was officially recognised on government records.&lt;ref name="Gailus"&gt;{{Cite book |last1=Gailus |first1=Manfred |last2=Nolzen |first2=Armin |date=2011 |title=Zerstrittene "Volksgemeinschaft": Glaube, Konfession und Religion im Nationalsozialismus |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_3uN2I9Uu68C&amp;pg=PA195 |location=Göttingen |publisher=Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht |page=195 |isbn=9783647300290 |accessdate=24 January 2018 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; The census of 17 May 1939 was the first time that German citizens were able to officially register as ''gottgläubig''.&lt;ref name="Gailus"/&gt; Out of 79.4&amp;nbsp;million Germans, 2.7&amp;nbsp;million people (3.5%) claimed to be ''gottgläubig'', compared to 94.5% who either belonged to the Protestant or Catholic churches, 300,000 Jews (0.4%), 86,000 adherents of other religions (including Muslims, Buddhists, Hindus, neopagans and other religious sects and movements, 0.1%), and 1.2&amp;nbsp;million (1.5%) who had [[irreligion|no faith]] (''glaubenslos'').&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gailus"/&gt; Paradoxically, Germans living in urban areas, where support for the Nazi Party was the lowest, were the most likely to identify as ''gottgläubig'', the five highest rates being found in [[Berlin]] (10.2%), [[Hamburg]] (7.5%), [[Vienna]] (6.4%), [[Düsseldorf]] (6.0%) and [[Essen]] (5.3%).&lt;ref&gt;Steigmann-Gall, p. 222.&lt;/ref&gt;  

The term still appeared sporadically a few years after the war, and was recognised in the 1946 census inside the [[Allied-occupied Germany#French Zone of Occupation|French Occupation Zone]], before it faded from official documents.&lt;ref&gt;Albert Zink: ''Die Pfalz am Rhein.'' Speyer 1952, Volume D, Table 19 p. 263 f, Konfessionsverteilung im späteren Regierungsbezirks Pfalz bei der Volkszählung vom 26. Januar 1946: in the urban and rural districts, each had three-digit numbers of "Gottgläubigen", together 8,300 of the 931,640 inhabitants (see table 6, p. 259 f for the total) in the Palatinate. Also compare [http://www.heimatjahrbuch-vulkaneifel.de/VT/hjb1999/hjb1999.92.htm the text from the Heimatjahrbuch Vulkaneifel] (fourth last paragraph) on the 1946 census in [[Jünkerath]], French Occupation Zone. Even in 1950, religious statistics with "Gottgläubigen" appear sporadically, for example in [[Kamen]], see [http://wiki-de.genealogy.net/Kamen auf wiki-de.genealogy.net] or in [[Hameln]], in: Erich Keyser, ''Deutsches Städtebuch, Band Niedersächsisches Städtebuch'' (Stuttgart 1952), p. 168.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Himmler and the SS ==
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R99621, Heinrich Himmler.jpg|thumb|[[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]]: "We believe in a God Almighty who stands above us; he has created the earth, the Fatherland, and the Volk, and he has sent us the Führer. Any human being who does not believe in God should be considered arrogant, megalomaniacal, and stupid and thus not suited for the SS."&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt;]]
''[[Reichsführer-SS]]'' [[Heinrich Himmler]], himself an ex-Catholic, was one of the main promotors of the ''gottgläubig'' movement.&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt; He was hostile towards Christianity, its values, the churches and their clergy.&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt; However, Himmler declared: "As [[National Socialists]], we believe in a Godly worldview."&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt; He insisted on the existence of a creator-God, who favoured and guided the [[Third Reich]] and the German nation, as he announced to the [[Schutzstaffel|SS]]: "We believe in a God Almighty who stands above us; he has created the earth, the Fatherland, and the Volk, and he has sent us the Führer. Any human being who does not believe in God should be considered arrogant, megalomaniacal, and stupid and thus not suited for the SS."&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt; He did not allow [[atheists]] into the SS, arguing that their "refusal to acknowledge higher powers" would be a "potential source of indiscipline".&lt;ref name="Burleigh 2012"&gt;[[Michael Burleigh|Burleigh, Michael]]: [https://books.google.com/books?id=l5gcZpnL5QUC&amp;pg=PA196&amp;dq=gottglaubig&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=RVtlU-L_HNGe7AbJ64DoBg&amp;ved=0CE8Q6AEwBjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=gottglaubig&amp;f=false The Third Reich: A New History; 2012; pp.&amp;nbsp;196–197]&lt;/ref&gt;

Himmler was not particularly concerned by the question how to label this deity; God Almighty, the Ancient One, Destiny, "Waralda", Nature etc. were all acceptable, as long as they referred to some "higher power that had created this world and endowed it with the laws of struggle and selection that guaranteed the continued existence of nature and the natural order of things."&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt; According to Himmler, "Only he who opposes belief in a higher power is considered godless"; everyone else was ''gottgläubig'', but should be thus outside of the church. SS members were put under pressure to identify as ''gottgläubig'' and revoke their church membership, if necessary under the threat of expulsion.&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt;

The SS personnel records show that most of its members who left the church of their upbringing, did so just before or shortly after joining the SS.&lt;ref name="Ziegler"/&gt; The [[Sicherheitsdienst]] (SD) members were the most willing corps within the SS to withdraw from their Christian denominations and change their religious affiliation to ''gottgläubig'' at 90%. Of the SS officers, 74% of those who joined the SS before 1933 did so, while 68% who joined the SS after 1933 would eventually declare themselves ''gottgläubig''. Of the general SS membership, 16% had left their churches by the end of 1937.&lt;ref name="Freedonia1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=State University of New York George C.

'''Harriet Martineau''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|ɑr|t|ən|ˌ|oʊ}}; 12 June 1802 &amp;ndash; 27 June 1876) was a British [[social theorist]] and [[Whig (British political party)|Whig]] writer, often cited as the first female [[sociologist]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated2002"&gt;Hill, Michael R. (2002) [https://books.google.com/books?id=qyzyUpMfh24C&amp;printsec=frontcover ''Harriet Martineau: Theoretical and Methodological Perspectives'']. Routledge. {{ISBN|0-415-94528-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martineau wrote many books and a multitude of essays from a sociological, holistic, religious, domestic, and perhaps most controversially, feminine perspective; she also translated various works by [[Auguste Comte]].&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Postlethwaite|first=Diana|title=Mothering and Mesmerism in the Life of Harriet Martineau|work= Signs |volume= 14 |issue = 3 |date= Spring 1989|pages =583–609|publisher=University of Chicago Press|jstor=3174403 |doi=10.1086/494525}}&lt;/ref&gt; She earned enough to support herself entirely by her writing, a rare feat for a woman in the [[Victorian era]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The young [[Queen Victoria|Princess Victoria]] enjoyed reading Martineau's publications. She invited Martineau to [[Coronation of Queen Victoria|her coronation in 1838]] — an event which Martineau described, in great and amusing detail, to her many readers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Martineau|first=Harriet|title=Harriet Martineau's Autobiography|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=z3_fRgeg_-UC&amp;pg=PA81 |volume=3 |year=1877|publisher=Cambridge University Press|accessdate=10 February 2013|quote=How delighted the Princess Victoria was with my 'Series' |pages= 79–80}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Wilson|first=Christopher|title=The Benefits of a feminist in the Family|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/8374204/The-benefits-of-a-feminist-in-the-family.html|work=The Benefits of a Feminist in the Family |accessdate=10 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Martineau said of her own approach to writing: "when one studies a society, one must focus on all its aspects, including key political, religious, and social institutions". She believed a thorough societal analysis was necessary to understand women's status under men.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}
The novelist [[Margaret Oliphant]] said "as a born lecturer and politician [Martineau] was less distinctively affected by her sex than perhaps any other, male or female, of her generation".&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt;

==Early life==
[[File:Harriet Martineau's autobiography (1879) (14595668018).jpg|left|thumb|255x255px|The house in which Harriet Martineau was born.]]
The sixth of eight children, Harriet Martineau was born in [[Norwich]], England, where her father Thomas was a textile manufacturer. A highly respected [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]], he was also [[deacon]] of the [[Octagon Chapel, Norwich]] from 1797.&lt;ref name="spartacus-educational.com"&gt;http://spartacus-educational.com/Wmartineau.htm&lt;/ref&gt; Harriet's mother was the daughter of a sugar refiner and grocer.

The [[Martineau family]] was of French [[Huguenot]] ancestry and professed [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] views. Her uncles included the surgeon Philip Meadows Martineau (1752–1829), whom she had enjoyed visiting at his nearby estate, [[Carrow Abbey|Bracondale Lodge]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Martineau |first1=Harriet |title=Autobiography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZDtjXkIid44C&amp;pg=PA660 |publisher=Broadview Press |date=2007 |page=49 |editor-first=Linda H. |editor-last=Peterson |accessdate=29 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and businessman and benefactor [[Peter Finch Martineau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ronalds|first=B.F.|date=February 2018|title=Peter Finch Martineau and his Son|url=|journal=The Martineau Society Newsletter|volume=41|pages=10–19|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martineau was closest to her brother [[James Martineau|James]], who became a philosopher and clergyman in the tradition of the [[English Dissenters]]. According to the writer Diana Postlethwaite, Harriet's relationship with her mother was strained and lacking affection, which contributed to views expressed in her later writing.&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt; Martineau claimed her mother abandoned her to a [[wet nurse]].

Her ideas on domesticity and the "natural faculty for housewifery", as described in her book ''Household Education'' (1848),&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt; stemmed from her lack of nurture growing up. Although their relationship was better in adulthood, Harriet saw her mother as the antithesis of the warm and nurturing qualities which she knew to be necessary for girls at an early age. Her mother urged all her children to be well read, but at the same time opposed female pedantics "with a sharp eye for feminine propriety and good manners. Her daughters could never be seen in public with a pen in their hand." Her mother strictly enforced proper feminine behaviour, pushing her daughter to "hold a sewing needle" as well as the (hidden) pen.&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt;

Martineau began losing her senses of taste and smell at a young age, becoming increasingly [[deaf]] and having to use an [[ear trumpet]]. It was the beginning of many health problems in her life. In 1821 she began to write anonymously for the ''[[Monthly Repository]]'', a Unitarian periodical, and in 1823 she published ''Devotional Exercises and Addresses, Prayers and Hymns''.

In 1829, the family's textile business failed.&lt;ref&gt;http://armitt.com/armitt_website/harriet-martineau-armitt-museum-and-library-cumbri/&lt;/ref&gt; Martineau, then 27 years old, stepped out of the traditional roles of feminine propriety to earn a living for her family. Along with her needlework, she began selling her articles to the ''Monthly Repository'', earning accolades, including three essay prizes from the [[Unitarian Association]]. Her regular work with the ''Repository'' helped establish her as a reliable and popular freelance writer.

In Martineau's ''Autobiography'', she reflects on her success as a writer and her father's business failure, which she describes as "one of the best things that ever happened to us".  She described how she could then "truly live instead of vegetate".&lt;ref&gt;Martineau, Harriet. From "Autobiography" ''The Norton Anthology of English Literature Eighth Edition Volume E: The Victorian Age''. Ed. Stephen Greenblatt. New York: Norton, 2006. 1589–92.&lt;/ref&gt; Her reflection emphasizes her experience with financial responsibility in her life while she writes "[her] fusion of literary and economic narratives".&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Her first commissioned book, ''[[Illustrations of Political Economy]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Full text at [http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=1873&amp;Itemid=27 The Online Library of Liberty]&lt;/ref&gt; was a fictional tutorial intended to help the general public understand the ideas of [[Adam Smith]]. ''Illustrations'' was published in February 1832 in an edition of just 1500 copies, since the publisher assumed it would not sell well.  Yet it very quickly became highly successful, and would steadily out-sell the work of [[Charles Dickens]]. ''Illustrations'' was her first work to receive widespread acclaim, and its success served to spread the free-market ideas of Adam Smith and others throughout the [[British Empire]]. Martineau then agreed to compose a series of similar monthly stories over a period of two years, the work being hastened by having her brother James also work on the series with her.&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt;

The subsequent works offered fictional tutorials on a range of political economists such as [[James Mill]], [[Jeremy Bentham|Bentham]] and [[David Ricardo|Ricardo]], the latter especially forming her view of rent law.  Martineau relied on [[Malthus]] to form her view of the tendency of human population to exceed its means of subsistence.  However, in stories such as "Weal and Woe in Garvelock", she promoted the idea of [[population control]] through what Malthus referred to as "voluntary checks" such as [[Sexual abstinence#History|voluntary chastity]] and delayed marriages.

==London and the United States==
In the early 19th century, most social institutions and norms were strongly shaped by gender, or the perception of what was appropriate for men versus for women. Writing was no exception; non-fiction works about social, economic and political issues were dominated by men, while limited areas, such as romance fiction, and topics dealing with domesticity were considered to be appropriate for women authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Logan|first=Deborah Anne|title=The Hour and the Woman: Harriet Martineau's Somewhat Remarkable Life|year=2002|publisher=Northern Illinois University Press|location=Dekalb, Illinois|isbn=0-87580-297-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite these gendered expectations in the literary world, Martineau strongly expressed her opinions on a variety of topics.

In 1832 Martineau moved to London. Among her acquaintances were: [[Henry Hallam]], [[Harriet Taylor]], [[Alexander Maconochie (penal reformer)|Alexander Maconochie]], [[Henry Hart Milman]], [[Thomas Malthus]], [[Monckton Milnes]], [[Sydney Smith]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Edward Bulwer-Lytton]], [[Elizabeth Barrett Browning]], [[Sarah Austin (translator)|Sarah Austin]], and [[Charles Lyell]], as well as [[Jane Welsh Carlyle]] and [[Thomas Carlyle]]. She met [[Florence Nightingale]], [[Charlotte Brontë]], [[George Eliot]] and [[Charles Dickens]] later on in her literary career.

Until 1834 Martineau was occupied with her brother James on the [[political economy]] series, as well as a supplemental series of ''Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated and Illustrations of Taxation'' which was intended to directly influence government policy. About the same time, she published four stories expressing support of the [[British Whig Party|Whig]] [[Poor Law]] reforms. These tales (direct, lucid, written without any appearance of effort, and yet practically effective) display the characteristics of their author's style. [[Tory]] paternalists reacted by calling her a [[Malthusian]] "who deprecates charity and provision for the poor", while [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicals]] opposed her to the same degree. Whig [[Upper class|high society]] fêted her.&lt;ref name="bell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bell|first=H.I.|title=Letters of Harriet Martineau|journal=The British Museum Quarterley|year=1932|volume=7|issue=1|pages=21–22|jstor=4421387}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1834 [[Charles Darwin]], on his expedition to the [[Galapagos Islands]], received a letter from his sisters saying that Martineau was "now a great Lion in London, much patronized by Ld. Brougham who has set her to write stories on [[English poor laws|the poor Laws]]" and recommending ''Poor Laws and Paupers Illustrated'' in [[pamphleteer|pamphlet]]-sized parts. They added that their brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]] "knows her &amp; is a very great admirer &amp; every body reads her little books &amp; if you have a dull hour you can, and then throw them overboard, that they may not take up your precious room".&lt;ref name="Letter 224"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Letter 224; Darwin, C.

[[File:Harriet martineau portrait.jpg|thumbnail|left| Harriet Martineau]]
In 1834, after completing the economic series, Harriet Martineau paid a long visit to the United States during which she visited a great many people, some little known, others as famous as [[James Madison]], the former US president, at his home at [[Montpelier (Orange, Virginia)|Montpelier]].&lt;ref&gt;McCoy, Drew R. ''The Last of the Fathers: James Madison and the Republican Legacy'' (Cambridge Univ. Press, 1989), p.&amp;nbsp;252&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?tbm=bks&amp;hl=en&amp;q=%22The+whole+Bible+is+against+Negro+slavery%2C+but+that+the+clergy+do+not+preach+this%2C+and+the+people+do+not+see+it.%22 ''The Westminster Review''] (1837)&lt;/ref&gt; She also met numerous abolitionists in Boston and studied the emerging schools for the education of girls.  Her support of [[Abolitionism in the United States|abolitionism]], then widely unpopular across the U.S., caused controversy, which her publication, soon after her return, of ''Society in America'' (1837) and ''How to Observe Morals and Manners'' (1838), only fuelled. The two books are considered significant contributions to the then-emerging field of sociology.{{Citation needed|date=April 2014}}

In ''Society in America'', Martineau angrily criticised the state of women's education. She wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;The intellect of women is confined by an unjustifiable restriction of... education... As women have none of the objects in life for which an enlarged education is considered requisite, the education is not given... The choice is to either be 'ill-educated, passive, and subservient, or well-educated, vigorous, and free only upon sufferance.&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The publication of Harriet Martineau's ''Illustrations of Political Economy'' found public success. So much success that, "by 1834, the monthly sales . . . had reached 10,000 in a decade in which a sale of 2,000 or 3,000 copies of a work of fiction was considered highly successful."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title = Banishing panic: Harriet Martineau and the popularization of political economy.|last = Freedgood|first = Elaine|date = 1995|journal = Victorian Studies |volume=39 |issue=1 |pages=33–53|jstor=3829415|doi = |pmid = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her article "The Martyr Age of the United States" (1839), in the ''[[Westminster Review]]'', introduced English readers to the struggles of the abolitionists in America several years after Britain had [[abolitionism in the United Kingdom|abolished slavery]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/martyrageofunite00martrich Harriet Martineau, "The Martyr Age of the United States"], 1839, Internet Archive.

In October 1836, soon after returning from the [[Second voyage of HMS Beagle|voyage of the ''Beagle'']], Charles Darwin went to London to stay with his brother [[Erasmus Alvey Darwin|Erasmus]]. He found him spending his days "driving out Miss Martineau", who had returned from her trip to the United States. Charles wrote to his sister, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Our only protection from so admirable a sister-in-law is in her working him too hard." He commented, "She already takes him to task about his idleness — She is going some day to explain to him her notions about marriage — Perfect equality of rights is part of her doctrine. I much doubt whether it will be equality in practice.&lt;ref name="www.darwinproject.ac.uk"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Letter 321; Darwin, C. R. to Darwin, C.

Charles noted that his father was upset by a piece in the ''Westminster Review'' calling for the radicals to break with the Whigs and give working men the vote "before he knew it was not [Martineau's], and wasted a good deal of indignation, and even now can hardly believe it is not hers".&lt;ref name="Desmond 1991 205"&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=205}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early December 1836 Charles Darwin called on Martineau and may have discussed the social and natural worlds she was writing about in her book ''Society in America'', including the "grandeur and beauty" of the "process of world making" she had seen at [[Niagara Falls]].&lt;ref name="Desmond 1991 205"/&gt; He remarked in a letter, &lt;blockquote&gt;She was very agreeable and managed to talk on a most wonderful number of subjects, considering the limited time. I was astonished to find how little ugly she is, but as it appears to me, she is overwhelmed with her own projects, her own thoughts and own abilities. Erasmus palliated all this, by maintaining one ought not to look at her as a woman.&lt;ref name="Letter 325"&gt;{{Cite web | title = Letter 325; Darwin, C. R. to Darwin, C. S., (7 Dec 1836) | url = http://www.darwinproject.ac.uk/entry-325 | publisher = Darwin Correspondence Project | accessdate = 18 December 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;In April 1838 Charles wrote to his older sister Susan that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Erasmus has been with her noon, morning, and night: — if her character was not as secure, as a mountain in the polar regions she certainly would lose it. — Lyell called there the other day &amp; there was a beautiful rose on the table, &amp; she coolly showed it to him &amp; said 'Erasmus Darwin' gave me that. — How fortunate it is, she is so very plain; otherwise I should be frightened: She is a wonderful woman.&lt;ref name="Letter 407"&gt;{{Cite web  | title = Letter 407; Darwin, C.

Martineau wrote ''Deerbrook'' (1838), a [[three-volume novel]] published after her American books.  She portrayed a failed love affair between a physician and his sister-in-law. It was considered her most successful novel.&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt; She also wrote ''The Hour and the Man: An Historical Romance'' (1839), a three-volume novel about the Haitian slave leader [[Toussaint L'Ouverture]], who contributed to the island nation's gaining independence in 1804.

==Newcastle and Tynemouth==
[[File:Anne Whitney, Harriet Martineau, 1882, Davis Museum, Wellesley.tif|thumb|[[Anne Whitney]], ''Harriet Martineau'', 1882, [[Davis Museum at Wellesley College|Davis Museum]], [[Wellesley College]]]]
In 1839, during a visit to [[Continental Europe]], Martineau was diagnosed with a uterine tumour.  She several times visited her brother-in-law, [[Thomas Michael Greenhow]], who was a celebrated doctor in [[Newcastle upon Tyne]], to try to alleviate her symptoms.  On the last occasion she stayed for six months in the Greenhow family house at 28 Eldon Square. Immobile and confined to a couch, she was cared for by her mother until purchasing a house and hiring a nurse to aid her.

She next moved downriver to [[Tynemouth]], where she stayed at Mrs Halliday's boarding-house, 57 Front Street, for nearly five years from 16 March 1840. The establishment is still open as a guest house today, now named the "Martineau Guest House" in her honour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Martineau Guest House|url=http://www.martineau-house.co.uk/|accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critic Diana Postlethwaite wrote of this period for Martineau: &lt;blockquote&gt;Being homebound is a major part of the process of becoming feminine. In this interior setting she (Martineau) is taught the home arts of working, serving, and cleaning, as well as the rehearsals for the role of mothering. She sees her mother... doing these things. They define femininity for her.&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Her illness caused her to literally enact the social constraints of women during this time.

Martineau wrote at least three books during her illness, and a historical plaque marks this house. A book of short stories for children, ''The Playfellow'', was published in 1841.&lt;ref name="spartacus-educational.com"/&gt; In 1844 she published both ''Crofton Boys'', a children's novel, and ''Life in the Sickroom: Essays by an Invalid,'' an autobiographical reflection on invalidism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |last= |first=|year=1844 |title=Life in the Sickroom: Essays by an Invalid |publisher=Edward Moxon |place=London|edition= 2 |page= |url=https://archive.org/stream/lifeinsickroome01martgoog#page/n8/mode/2up |accessdate=14 June 2016 |via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; She wrote ''Household Education'' (1848), the handbook on the "proper" way to raise and educate children. Lastly, she began working on her autobiography.  Completed much later, it included some hundred pages on this period. Notable visitors included Richard Cobden and Thomas and Jane Carlyle.

''Life in the Sickroom'' is considered to be one of Martineau's most under-rated works. It upset evangelical readers as they "thought it dangerous in 'its supposition of self-reliance'".&lt;ref name="Winter 1995 597–616"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Winter|first=Alison|title=Harriet Martineau and the Reform of the Invalid in Victorian England|journal=The Historical Journal|date=September 1995|volume=38|issue=3|pages=597–616|jstor=264004|doi=10.1017/s0018246x00019993}}&lt;/ref&gt; This series of essays embraced traditional womanhood. Martineau dedicated it to [[Elizabeth Barrett]], as it was "an outpouring of feeling to an idealized female alter ego, both professional writer and professional invalid- and utterly unlike the women in her own family". Written during a kind of public break from her mother, this book was Martineau's proclamation of independence.&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt;

At the same time, Martineau turned the traditional patient/doctor relationship on its head by asserting control over her space even in sickness. The sickroom was her space. ''Life in the Sickroom'' explained how to regain control even in illness. Alarmed that a woman was suggesting such a position in the power dynamic, critics suggested that, as she was an invalid, her mind must also be sick and the work was not to be taken seriously. ''British and Foreign Medical Review'' dismissed Martineau's piece on the same basis as the critics: an ill person cannot write a healthy work. They thought it was unheard of for a woman to suggest being in a position of control, especially in sickness. Instead, the ''Review'' recommended that patients follow "unconditional submission" to the advice of doctors.&lt;ref name="Winter 1995 597–616"/&gt; They disagreed with the idea that Martineau might hold any sort of "authority to Britain's invalids".&lt;ref name="Winter 1995 597–616"/&gt;

Expecting to remain an invalid for the rest of her life, Martineau delighted in the new freedom of views using her [[telescope]]. Across the [[River Tyne|Tyne]] was the sandy beach ″where there are frequent wrecks—too interesting to an invalid... and above the rocks, a spreading heath, where I watch troops of boys flying their kites; lovers and friends taking their breezy walks on Sundays..."&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt; She expressed a lyrical view of Tynemouth:

&lt;blockquote&gt;When I look forth in the morning, the whole land may be sheeted with glistening snow, while the myrtle-green sea tumbles... there is none of the deadness of winter in the landscape; no leafless trees, no locking up with ice; and the air comes in through my open upper sash, but sun-warmed. The robins twitter and hop in my flower-boxes... and at night, what a heaven! What an expanse of stars above, appearing more steadfast, the more the Northern Lights dart and quiver!{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During her illness, she for a second time declined a pension on the [[civil list]], fearing to compromise her political independence. After publication of her letter on the subject, some of her friends raised a small [[Life annuity|annuity]] for her soon after.

In 1844 Martineau underwent a course of [[mesmerism]], returning to health after a few months. There was national interest in mesmerism at this time. Also known as 'animal magnetism', it can be defined as a "loosely grouped set of practices in which one person influenced another through a variety of personal actions, or through the direct influence of one mind on another mind. Mesmerism was designed to make invisible forces augment the mental powers of the mesmeric object."&lt;ref name="Winter 1995 597–616"/&gt; She eventually published an account of her case in sixteen ''Letters on Mesmerism'', which caused much discussion. Her work led to friction with "the natural prejudices of a surgeon and a surgeon's wife" (her brother-in-law and sister, [[Martineau family|Elizabeth Greenhow, née Martineau]]).

== Ambleside – views on religion, philosophical atheism, and Darwin==
{{refimprove section|date=June 2017}}
[[File:Harriet Martineau (1802-1876).jpg|thumb|Harriet Martineau, 1861, by [[Camille Silvy]]]]

In 1845 she left [[Tynemouth]] for [[Ambleside]] in the [[Lake District]], where she designed herself and oversaw the construction of the house called ''The Knoll, Ambleside'', where she spent the greater part of her later life.&lt;ref&gt;From Ambleside she made two interesting contributions to ''[[The Zoist|The Zoist: A Journal of Cerebral Physiology &amp; Mesmerism, and Their Applications to Human Welfare]]'', relating to mesmerism: the first, a letter (dated 19 August 1850) describing her mesmeric treatment of one of her cows: "Mesmeric Cure of a Cow", [https://books.google.com/books?id=ueRXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA300 Vol.&amp;nbsp;8, No. 31 (October 1850), pp.&amp;nbsp;300–03]; and the second, also a letter (dated 23 October 1850), describing the angry visit of the veterinarian who had previously tried (in vain) to treat her dangerously ill cow (which was now quite well), on his hearing the news of its recovery: "Distressing effects in a Doctor upon the removal of a Disease from a Cow with Mesmerism", [https://books.google.com/books?id=ueRXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA333#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Vol. 8, No. 32 (January 1851), pp.&amp;nbsp;333–37].&lt;/ref&gt; In 1845 she published three volumes of ''Forest and Game Law Tales''. In 1846, she resided with her elderly mother, [[Martineau family|Elizabeth]], in Birmingham for some time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=H. Peterson|first1=Linda|title=Autobiography – Harriet Martineau|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=bdxHAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT778|publisher=Broadview Press 2007|accessdate=14 June 2013|quote=Harriet visited Birmingham to see her mother, Elizabeth, in 1846. At that time, Harriet's brother, Robert, was Mayor of Birmingham.}}&lt;/ref&gt; following which she then toured [[Egypt]], Palestine and [[Syria]] with some friends.  On her return she published ''Eastern Life, Present and Past'' (1848), in which she reports a breakthrough realization standing on a prominence looking out across the Nile and desert to the tombs of the dead, where "the deceased crossed the living valley and river" to "the caves of the death region" where Osiris the supreme judge "is to give the sign of acceptance or condemnation" (''Eastern Life, Present and Past'', Complete in One Volume, Philadelphia, 1848, p.&amp;nbsp;48). Her summary: "the mortuary ideas of the primitive Egyptians, and through them, of the civilized world at large, have been originated by the everlasting conflict of the Nile and the Desert".

This epiphany changed the course of her life.&lt;ref name="Relph2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Relph|first=Lyn Paul|title=Our Experience, Ourselves|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AqL8AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PP211|accessdate=11 June 2017|date=November 2012|publisher=Lulu.com|isbn=9781300350941|pages=211–213}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eastern Life'' expressed her concept that, as humanity passed through one after another of the world's historic religions, the conception of the [[deity]] and of divine government became at each step more and more abstract and indefinite. She believed the ultimate goal to be philosophic [[atheism]], but did not explicitly say so in the book.  She described ancient tombs, "the black pall of oblivion" set against the [[Paschal cycle|paschal]] "puppet show" in the [[Church of the Holy Sepulchre]], and noted that Christian beliefs in reward and punishment were based on and similar to [[Paganism|heathen]] [[superstition]]s. Describing an [[ancient Egypt]]ian tomb, she wrote, "How like ours were his life and death!... Compare him with a retired naval officer made country gentleman in our day, and in how much less do they differ than agree!" The book's "[[infidel]] tendency" was too much for the publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], who rejected it. Martineau's biographer, Florence Fenwick Miller, wrote that "all her best moral and intellectual faculties were exerted, and their action becomes visible, at one page or another" of this work.&lt;ref&gt;Fenwick 1884, p. 109&lt;/ref&gt;

Martineau wrote ''[[Household Education]]'' in 1848, lamenting the state of women's education. She believed women had a natural inclination to motherhood and believed domestic work went hand in hand with academia for a proper, well-rounded education. She stated, "I go further than most persons... in desiring thorough practice in domestic occupations, from an early age, for young girls".&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt; She proposed that freedom and rationality, rather than command and obedience, are the most effectual instruments of education.

Her interest in schemes of instruction led her to start a series of lectures, addressed at first to the school children of Ambleside, but afterward extended to their parents at the request of the adults. The subjects were sanitary principles and practice, the [[History of England|histories of England]] and [[History of North America|North America]], and the scenes of her Eastern travels. At the request of the publisher [[Charles Knight (publisher)|Charles Knight]], in 1849 she wrote ''The History of the Thirty Years' Peace, 1816–1846'', an excellent popular history from the point of view of a "philosophical Radical". Martineau spanned a wide variety of subject matter in her writing and did so with more assertiveness than was expected of women at the time. She has been described as having an "essentially masculine nature".&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt; It was commonly thought that a "progressive" woman, in being progressive, was improperly emulating the qualities of a man.

Martineau's work included a widely used guide book to the [[Lake District]], ''A Complete Guide to the English Lakes'', published in 1855 and in its 4th edition by 1876.&lt;ref name="guide"&gt;{{cite book |title=A Complete Guide to the English Lakes |last=Martineau |first=Harriet |url=https://archive.org/stream/completeguidetoe1855mart#page/n7/mode/2up |date=nd |location=Windermere |publisher=John Garnett |via=Archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;reviewed in the ''Westmorland Gazette'', Saturday 8 July 1871, p.&amp;nbsp;3, column 1&lt;/ref&gt; This served as the definitive guidebook for the area for 25 years, effectively replacing the earlier [[Guide to the Lakes|guide]] by [[William Wordsworth]], and continued in common usage until the publication of [[M. J. B. Baddeley|Baddeley's]]  ''Thorough Guide to the English Lake District'' in 1880.

[[File:Harriet Martineau sociologist.jpg|thumb|Martineau in her later years, painted by [[George Richmond (painter)|George Richmond]]]]
Martineau edited a volume of ''Letters on the Laws of Man's Nature and Development'', published in March 1851. Its epistolary form is based on correspondence between her and the self-styled scientist [[Henry G. Atkinson]].  She expounded the doctrine of philosophical atheism, which she thought the tendency of human belief . She did not deny a [[Cosmological argument|first cause]] but declared it [[Agnosticism|unknowable]].  She and Atkinson thought they affirmed man's [[moral obligation]]. Atkinson was a zealous exponent of mesmerism. The prominence given to the topics of mesmerism and [[clairvoyance]] heightened the general disapproval of the book.  Literary London was outraged by its mesmeric [[evolutionism|evolutionary]] atheism, and the book caused a lasting division between Martineau, her beloved brother, James who had become a Unitarian cleric, and some of her friends.

From 1852 to 1866, she contributed regularly to the ''[[The Daily News (UK)|Daily News]]'', writing sometimes six leaders a week. She wrote over 1600 articles for the paper in total.&lt;ref name="spartacus-educational.com"/&gt;  It also published her ''Letters from Ireland'', written during a visit to that country in the summer of 1852. For many years she was a contributor to the ''[[Westminster Review]]''; in 1854 she was among financial supporters who prevented its closing down.

Martineau believed she was psychosomatic; this medical belief of the times related the uterus to emotions and hysteria. She had symptoms of hysteria in her loss of taste and smell.  Her partial deafness throughout life may have contributed to her problems. Various people, including the maid, her brother,&lt;ref name="Winter 1995 597–616"/&gt; and Spencer T. Hall (a notable mesmerist) performed mesmerism on her.  Some historians attribute her apparent recovery from symptoms to a shift in the positioning of her tumor so that it no longer obstructed other organs. As the physical improvements were the first signs of healing she had in five years and happened at the same time of her first mesmeric treatment, Martineau confidentially credited mesmerism with her "cure".&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt;

She continued her political activism during the late 1850s and 1860s. She supported the Married Women's Property Bill and in 1856 signed a petition for it organised by Barbara Bodichon.  She also pushed for licensed prostitution and laws that addressed the customers rather than the women.  She supported women's [[suffrage]] and signed Bodichon's petition in its favour in 1866.

In the early part of 1855, Martineau was suffering from [[heart disease]]. She began to write her autobiography, as she expected her life to end. Completing the book rapidly in three months, she postponed its publication until after her death, and lived another two decades.  It was published posthumously in 1877.&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt;

When Darwin's book ''[[The Origin of Species]]'' was published in 1859, his brother Erasmus sent a copy to his old flame Harriet Martineau.  At age 58, she was still reviewing from her home in the Lake District. From her "snow landscape", Martineau sent her thanks, adding that she had previously praised
&lt;blockquote&gt;the quality &amp; conduct of your brother's mind, but it is an unspeakable satisfaction to see here the full manifestation of its earnestness &amp; simplicity, its sagacity, its industry, &amp; the patient power by which it has collected such a mass of facts, to transmute them by such sagacious treatment into such portentous knowledge. I should much like to know how large a proportion of our scientific men believe he has found a sound road.&lt;/blockquote&gt;Martineau supported Darwin's theory because it was not based in theology. Martineau strove for secularism stating, "In the present state of the religious world, Secularism ought to flourish. What an amount of sin and woe might and would then be extinguished."&lt;ref name="bell" /&gt; She wrote to her fellow [[Thomas Malthus|Malthusian]] (and atheist) [[George Holyoake]] enthusing, "What a book it is! – overthrowing (if true) revealed Religion on the one hand, &amp; Natural (as far as Final Causes &amp; Design are concerned) on the other. The range &amp; mass of knowledge take away one's breath." To Fanny Wedgwood (the wife of [[Hensleigh Wedgwood]]) she wrote,
&lt;blockquote&gt;I rather regret that C.D. went out of his way two or three times to speak of "The [[Creator God|Creator]]" in the popular sense of the First Cause.... His subject is the "Origin of Species" &amp; not the origin of Organisation; &amp; it seems a needless mischief to have opened the latter speculation at all – There now! I have delivered my mind.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Economics and social sciences==
Harriet Martineau propounds political economic theories in ''Illustrations of Political Economy''. She is seen as a frontrunner who merges fiction and economy in a time period when "fiction claimed authority over emotional knowledge, while economics claimed authority over empirical knowledge".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Making a Social Body: British Cultural Formation 1830–1864.|last = Poovey|first = Mary|publisher = Chicago: University of Chicago Press|year = 1995|isbn = |location = |pages = 132–33}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, Martineau's text sets the stage for women to enter into economics. For example, Dalley Lana explains that "by bringing the topic of domestic economy to bear on political economy, Martineau places women more centrally within economic theory and practice. In this context, women – as readers of the ''Illustrations'' and as characters with the tales – are not only rendered a part of larger-scale economics but also (because of their participation) encourage to learn the principles of political economy."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.branchcollective.org/?ps_articles=lana-l-dalley-on-martineaus-illustrations-of-political-economy-1832-34|title = On Martineau's Illustrations of Political Economy, 1832–34|date = |accessdate = 30 November 2015|website = BRANCH: Britain, Representation|publisher = |last = Dalley|first = Lana L.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1831, Martineau wrote on the subject "Political Economy" (as the field of economics was then known). Her goal was to popularise and illustrate the principles of ''[[laissez faire]]'' capitalism, though she made no claim to original theorising.

Martineau's reflections on ''Society in America'', published in 1837, are prime examples of her sociological methods. Her ideas in this field were set out in her 1838 book ''[[How to Observe Morals and Manners]]''. She believed that some very general social laws influence the life of any society, including the principle of progress, the emergence of science as the most advanced product of human intellectual endeavour, and the significance of population dynamics and the natural physical environment.{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

[[Auguste Comte]] coined the name sociology and published a rambling exposition under the title of ''Cours de Philosophie Positive'' in 1839.  Martineau undertook a translation that was published in two volumes in 1853 as ''The Positive Philosophy of Auguste Comte (freely translated and condensed by Harriet Martineau)''. It was a remarkable achievement, and a successful one; Comte recommended her volumes to his students instead of his own. Some writers regard Martineau as the first female sociologist. Her introduction of Comte to the English-speaking world and the elements of sociological perspective in her original writings support her credit as a sociologist.&lt;ref name="Sociology"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Anthony Giddens|author2=Simon Griffiths|title=Sociology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vbu2gis26C0C&amp;pg=PA20|year=2006|publisher=Polity|page=20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
[[File:The lower section of the Reformers memorial, Kensal Green Cemetery.jpg|thumb|Harriet Martineau's name on the lower section of the Reformers memorial, Kensal Green Cemetery]]
Harriet Martineau died of bronchitis&lt;ref name="spartacus-educational.com"/&gt; at "The Knoll" on 27 June 1876. She was buried alongside her mother in [[Key Hill Cemetery]], [[Hockley, West Midlands|Hockley]], Birmingham. The following April, at Bracondale, her cousin's estate, much of Martineau's extensive art collection was sold at auction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=The San Francisco News Letter and California Advertiser |date=21 April 1877 |department=What the World Says |title=The Late Miss Harriet Martineau |url=http://www.mocavo.com/S-F-News-Letter-1877-Volume-27/299380/275 |accessdate=4 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Memorial==
Her name is listed on the east face of the Reformers Memorial in [[Kensal Green cemetery]] in [[London]].

==Legacy==
She left an autobiographical sketch to be published by the ''Daily News'', in which she wrote:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Harriet Martineau|editor=Maria Weston Chapman|title=Harriet Martineau's Autobiography:|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TPoNAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA572|year=1877|page=572}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Her original power was nothing more than was due to earnestness and intellectual clearness within a certain range. With small imaginative and suggestive powers, and therefore nothing approaching to genius, she could see clearly what she did see, and give a clear expression to what she had to say. In short, she could popularize while she could neither discover nor invent.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In 1877 her autobiography was published. It was rare for a woman to publish such a work, let alone one secular in nature. Her book was regarded as dispassionate, "philosophic to the core" in its perceived masculinity, and a work of necessitarianism. She deeply explored childhood experiences and memories, expressing feelings of having been deprived of her mother's affection, as well as strong devotion to her brother [[James Martineau]], a theologian.&lt;ref name="Postlethwaite 1989"/&gt;

Anthony Giddens and Simon Griffiths argue that Martineau is a neglected founder of sociology and that she remains important today. She taught that study of the society must include all its aspects, including key political, religious and social institutions, and she insisted on the need to include the lives of women.  She was the first sociologist to study such issues as marriage, children, religious life, and race relations.  Finally, she called on sociologists to do more than just observe, but also work to benefit the society.&lt;ref name="Sociology"/&gt;

In February 2014, it was reported that London's [[National Portrait Gallery, London|National Portrait Gallery]] held several portraits of Harriet, whose great nephew, [[Lupton family|Francis Martineau Lupton]], was the great–great–grandfather of [[Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge]], the gallery's patron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Furness|first=Hannah|title=Duchess of Cambridge visits National Portrait Gallery, home to little-known Middleton family paintings.|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/kate-middleton/10631996/Duchess-of-Cambridge-visits-National-Portrait-Gallery-home-of-little-known-Middleton-family-paintings.html|date=11 February 2014 |page= 3|work=The Daily Telegraph|accessdate=14 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harriet was close to her niece [[Frances Lupton]], who worked to open up [[Female education#Modern period|educational opportunities for women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Edited by Elisabeth Sanders Arbuckle|first1=Harriet Martineau|title=Harriet Martineau's Letters to Fanny Wedgwood|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yR2rAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA154|publisher=Stanford University Press | page= 150 |date= 1 January 1983|accessdate=15 May 2015|quote=(May 1857) My (H.

'''Heiner Bielefeldt''' (April 12, 1958) is a German philosopher, historian and Catholic theologian. He is Professor of Human Rights and Human Rights Policy at the [[University of Erlangen]]. In 2010, he was appointed [[United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/apps/news/story.asp?NewsID=39500 Moldova: UN human rights expert calls for more fostering of religious diversity]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life==
Bielefeldt studied philosophy and Catholic Theology at [[Bonn University]] und [[Tübingen University]], which he completed in 1981 and 1982 respectively. Afterwards, he took a third undergraduate degree in history from Tübingen University in 1988. In 1989 he received his PhD in Philosophy from the University of Tübingen with a thesis on social contract theories.

He then worked until 1995 at the Faculty of Law at the [[University of Heidelberg]]. As a recipient of an Alexander-von-Humboldt Fellowship, he spent 1993/94 at the Faculty of Law and the Department of Philosophy of the [[University of Toronto]]. In February 2000, he took his post-doctoral [[habilitation]] degree in philosophy from the University of Bremen.

From 2003 to 2009, Bielefeldt served as Director of the German Institute for Human Rights, which monitors the human rights situation inside Germany.

In 2009, Bielefeldt was appointed professor in the newly created Chair of Human Rights and Human Rights Policy at the [[University of Erlangen]]. Bielefeldt teaches in the areas of political science, philosophy, law and history.

On June 18, 2010, Bielefeldt was appointed [[United Nations Special Rapporteur on Freedom of Religion or Belief]] by [[Secretary-General of the United Nations|UN Secretary General]] [[Ban Ki-moon]].

'''Insight''' is a sudden understanding of a problem or a strategy that aids in solving a problem. Usually, this involves conceptualizing the problem in a completely new way. Although insights may appear to be sudden, they are actually the result of prior thought and effort. While insight can be involved in solving well-structured problems, it is more often associated with ill-structured problems.&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R.J. (2009). Cognitive Psychology. Belmont, CA, Wadsworth Cengage Learning.&lt;/ref&gt;  

== Viewpoints ==

*'''The Nothing-Special View''': Insight is merely an extension of ordinary perceiving, recognizing, learning, and conceiving. Insights are significant products of ordinary thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Langley, P., et al. (1987). Scientific discovery : computational explorations of the creative processes. Cambridge, MA, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''The Neo-Gestaltist View''': Insight problem solvers show poor ability to predict their success. Problem-solvers do not show increase in feelings of "warmth" as they draw nearer to a solution of an insight problem. This supports the Gestaltist view that there is something special about insightful problem solving, as opposed to noninsightful, routine problem solving.&lt;ref&gt;Metcalfe, J. &amp; Wiebe, D. (1987). Intuition in insight and noninsight problem solving. Memory &amp; Cognition 1987, 15(3), 238-246.&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''[[The Three-Process View]]''': There are three different kinds of insights. (1) Selective-encoding insights involve distinguishing relevant from irrelevant information. (2) Selective-comparison insights involve novel perceptions of how new information relates to old information. (3) Selective-combination insights involve taking selectively encoded and compared bits of relevant information and combining them in a novel way.&lt;ref&gt;Davidson, J.E. &amp; Sternberg, R.J. (2003). The psychology of problem solving. New York, NY: Cambridge University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

When people solve, or attempt to solve an insight [[puzzle]], they experience a common '''phenomenology''', that is, a set of behavioural properties that accompany problem-solving activity (for a useful edited review of insight problems and their phenomenology, see Sternberg &amp; Davidson, 1995). Other kinds of puzzle, such as the [[Tower of Hanoi]], an example of a [[transformation problem]], tend not to yield these phenomena. The phenomena may include:

* '''Impasse''': An individual reaches a point where he or she simply appears to run out of ideas of new things to try that might solve a problem.
* '''Fixation''': An individual repeats the same type of solution attempt again and again, even when they see that it does not seem to lead to solution.
* '''Incubation''': A pause or gap between attempts to solve a problem can sometimes appear to aid the finding of a solution, as if one is clearing the mind of faulty ideas.
* '''The 'Aha' experience''': The solutions to some insight problems can seem to appear from nowhere, like a [[Eureka moment]].&lt;ref&gt;Sternberg, R. J. and J. E. Davidson (1995). The nature of insight. Cambridge MA, MIT Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Insight cultivators ==
[[Max van Manen|Max van Mannen]] proposed the so-called insight cultivators to obtain thematic insights when studying a phenomenon or phenomenological topic or event.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Phenomenology of Practice: Meaning-Giving Methods in Phenomenological Research and Writing|last=van Manen|first=Max|publisher=Routledge|year=2016|isbn=9781611329438|location=Oxon|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This framework holds that insights can be obtained from [[Philosophy|philosophic]], [[humanities]], and [[Human science|human sciences]] sources. The idea is that the works of artists, scholars, and philosophers help us gain understanding about our own lived experiences.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; There is the view that this process can yield phenomenological anecdotes that can trigger an understanding that is beyond or more effective than what we could grasp intellectually because of the creative insights and understanding of a phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.phenomenologyonline.com/inquiry/methods-procedures/reflective-methods/exegetical-reflection/insight-cultivating-reflection/|title=Phenomenology Online   » Insight-cultivating Reflection|website=www.phenomenologyonline.com|access-date=2018-07-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Insight cultivators can also lead to innovative or unique insights because they allow an evaluation of previous literature and experiences that reveal what has worked, what needs improvement, or what is wrong. The insights gleaned can allow us to identify a new way of looking at a phenomenon.

'''John Joseph Hopfield''' (born July 15, 1933) is an [[United States|American]] scientist most widely known for his invention of an ''associative [[neural network]]'' in 1982. It is now more commonly known as the [[Hopfield net|Hopfield Network]].

==Biography==
Hopfield was born in 1933 to Polish physicist [[John J. Hopfield (spectroscopist)|John Joseph Hopfield]] and his physicist wife Helen Hopfield. Helen was the older Hopfield's second wife. He is the sixth of Hopfield's children and has three children and six grandchildren of his own.

He received his [[Bachelor of Arts|A.B.]] from [[Swarthmore College]] in 1954, and a Ph.D in physics from [[Cornell University]] in 1958 (supervised by [[Albert Overhauser]]). He spent two years in the theory group at [[Bell Laboratories]], and subsequently was a faculty member at [[University of California, Berkeley]] (physics), [[Princeton University]] (physics), [[California Institute of Technology]] (Chemistry and Biology) and again at Princeton, where he is the Howard A. Prior Professor of Molecular Biology, Emeritus. For 35 years, he also continued a strong connection with Bell Laboratories.

In 1986 he was a co-founder of the [[Computation and Neural Systems]] PhD program at Caltech.

His most influential papers have been "The Contribution of Excitons to the Complex Dielectric Constant of Crystals" (1958), describing the [[polariton]]; "Electron transfer between biological molecules by thermally activated tunneling" (1974), describing the quantum mechanics of long-range electron transfers; "[[Kinetic proofreading|Kinetic Proofreading]]: a New Mechanism for Reducing Errors in Biosynthetic Processes Requiring High Specificity" (1974); "Neural networks and physical systems with emergent collective computational abilities" (1982) (known as the Hopfield Network) and, with D. W. Tank, "Neural computation of decisions in optimization problems" (1985). His current research and recent papers are chiefly focused on the ways in which [[action potential]] timing and synchrony can be used in neurobiological computation.

==Awards and Honours==
He was awarded the [[Dirac Medal]] of the ICTP in 2002 for his interdisciplinary contributions to understanding biology as a physical process, including the [[Kinetic proofreading|proofreading process in biomolecular synthesis]] and a description of [[collective dynamics]] and computing with attractors in neural networks, and the [[Oliver Buckley Prize]] of the American Physical Society for work on the interactions [[photon|between light]] and solids. He is a member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Philosophical Society, and the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. He received the [[Albert Einstein World Award of Science]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Albert Einstein World Award of Science 2005|url=http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/winners-science-johnj.php|accessdate=August 13, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131023001446/http://www.consejoculturalmundial.org/winners-science-johnj.php|archivedate=October 23, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was the President of the American Physical Society in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aip.org/history/acap/biographies/bio.jsp?hopfieldj John Hopfield, Array of Contemporary Physicists]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''John Macmurray''' [[Military Cross|MC]] (16 February 1891 – 21 June 1976) was a Scottish philosopher. His thought moved beyond the modern tradition begun by [[Descartes]] and continued in Britain by [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]] and [[David Hume|Hume]]. He made contributions in the fields of political science, religion, education, and philosophy in a long career of writing, teaching, and public speaking. After retirement he became a [[Quaker]].

==Life==
Macmurray was born on 16 February 1891 in [[Maxwelltown]] in [[Kirkcudbrightshire]], Scotland, into a strict [[Presbyterianism|Presbyterian]] family.&lt;ref name=McIntosh&gt;{{cite book | last = McIntosh | first = Esther | title = John Macmurray: Selected philosophical writings (Introduction) | publisher = Imprint Academic | location = Devon | year = 2004 | isbn = 0-907845-73-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was employed by the [[Inland Revenue|Inland Revenue Department]] as an [[HM Customs and Excise|excise officer]]. In 1899 the family moved to [[Aberdeen]], where the young Macmurray attended [[Aberdeen Grammar School]] (1903 to 1905) and [[Robert Gordon's College]] (1905 to 1909). He was educated at the [[University of Glasgow]], earning [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|First-class honours]] in [[Classics]] and was awarded a [[Snell Exhibition]] to attend [[Balliol College, Oxford]] in 1913. His tutor at Balliol was [[Sandie Lindsay, 1st Baron Lindsay of Birker|A. D. Lindsay]].&lt;ref name=Costello&gt;{{cite book | last = Costello | first = John E. | title = John Macmurray: A biography | publisher = Floris | location = Edinburgh | year = 2002 | isbn = 0-86315-361-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
When war with Germany was declared in 1914, Macmurray enlisted in the [[Royal Army Medical Corps]]. In August 1915 he was sent to France with the 58th [[Field Ambulance]] as part of the [[19th (Western) Division]] of the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]]. In June 1916 he was awarded a commission as [[Second Lieutenant]] in the [[Queen's Own Cameron Highlanders]] and was sent to the [[Battle of the Somme]]. Macmurray married Elizabeth Hyde Campbell in London during a three-day leave in October 1916. He was seriously wounded in battle near [[Arras]] on 28 March 1918 and was awarded the [[Military Cross]] for gallantry.&lt;ref name=Costello/&gt;

While on leave recovering from a broken ankle in 1917, Macmurray was invited to give a sermon in an unidentified [[North London]] church. He preached on the importance of preparing for post-war reconciliation with the enemy rather than exacting vengeance. The sermon was coldly received by the congregation and Macmurray saw their reaction as indicating a lack of true Christianity in the institutional churches. Because of this experience, Macmurray determined not to be a member of any church, while continuing to maintain his strong Christian convictions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Macmurray | first1 = John | title = Search for Reality in Religion | publisher = George Allen &amp; Unwin | year = 1965}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|80–81}}

After the war, Macmurray completed his studies at Balliol, obtaining a distinction in the Shortened Honours Course of Literae Humaniores in 1919, as well as winning in the John Locke Scholarship in Mental Philosophy in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Calendar, 1925, p.211&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Who Was Who, 1971-80, London : A. &amp; C. Black,1981, p.506&lt;/ref&gt;  He worked as a [[Lecturer]] in Philosophy at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]] from 1919 to 1920, followed by two years as Chair of Philosophy at the [[University of the Witwatersrand]] in South Africa. In 1922 he returned to Balliol as a [[Fellow|Fellow and Tutor]], succeeding his former tutor A.D. Lindsay as Jowett Lecturer in Philosophy. He left Oxford to become [[Grote Chair of the Philosophy of Mind and Logic|Grote Professor of Mind and Logic]] at [[University College London]], the position he held from 1928 to 1944. He then moved to the University of Edinburgh, where he held the Chair of [[Ethics|Moral Philosophy]] until his retirement in 1958.

Macmurray and his wife had no children. After his retirement, they moved to the village of [[Jordans, Buckinghamshire]], where they both joined the [[Society of Friends]]. In 1970 they returned to Edinburgh, where Macmurray died on 21 June 1976.

==Philosophy==

The main themes in Macmurray's philosophy  are the primacy in human life of action over theory, and the essentially relational nature of human beings.&lt;ref name=Gee&gt;{{cite web | url = http://johnmacmurray.org/further-reading/a-beginners-guide-to-macmurray-in-a-philosophical-context/ | title = A Beginner's Guide to Macmurray in a Philosophical Context | accessdate = 2011-02-17 | last = Gee | first = Paul | year = 2006 | publisher = The John Macmurray Fellowship}}&lt;/ref&gt; These themes are the basis for his [[Gifford Lectures]] delivered in 1953 and 1954 at the University of Glasgow, and entitled ''The Self as Agent'' and ''Persons in Relation'' respectively. The overall title given to the two lecture series was ''The Form of the Personal''. Macmurray summed up his philosophy in the introduction to ''The Self as Agent'': "The simplest expression that I can find for the thesis I have tried to maintain is this: All meaningful knowledge is for the sake of action, and all meaningful action for the sake of friendship".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Macmurray | first = John | title = The Self as Agent | publisher = Faber &amp; Faber | year = 1957 | location = London}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp | 15}}

Macmurray rejected [[mind-body dualism]] and argued that the nature of human beings is personal, rather than mechanical or organic. He argued for the importance of emotion as motivating action, and looked to infancy and early childhood for evidence of the universal desire for relationship. He distinguished between society and community, with society being for organizations to achieve particular purposes, while community is an end in itself.&lt;ref name=McIntosh/&gt;

In dismissing the [[Cogito ergo sum|Cogito]] and its legacy of the primacy of thought over action, Macmurray saw himself as breaking with the western philosophical tradition. However, he acknowledged the influence of [[Immanuel Kant|Kant]] and [[Karl Marx|Marx]] on his thinking, along with Christianity.&lt;ref name=Gee/&gt; On the other hand, he had no sympathy for, and did not engage with, the type of academic philosophy that was dominant during the latter part of his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.scottishphilosophy.org/johnmacmurray.html | title = John Macmurray 1891-1976 | accessdate = 2011-02-17 | work = Biographical Dictionary of Scottish Philosophers | publisher = The International Association for Scottish Philosophy | quote = In the introduction to these lectures he identifies a crisis in philosophy – “The tradition is broken, and cannot be re-established” – but he rejects both the leading philosophies of his day, existentialism and logical empiricism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Broadcasting and other work==

His friendship with the educator Kenneth C. Barnes resulted in his becoming a governor of [[Wennington School]].

He was well known in Britain before World War II for his [[BBC]] radio broadcasts on philosophy, some of which were published in his first book, ''Freedom in the Modern World'' (1932).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hunt|first=Philip|title=A Public Philosopher: John Macmurray and the BBC, 1930 to 1941|url=http://johnmacmurray.org/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/JM-and-the-BBC-Philip-Hunt.pdf|work=John Macmurray: The John Macmurray Fellowship Website|accessdate=5 May 2014|format=PDF|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence==

Macmurray' s work has been largely neglected in academic philosophy. However, he has been influential in other fields, including theology and psychology.&lt;ref name = Conford&gt;{{cite book | last = Conford | first = Philip (Ed.)| title = The Personal World: John Macmurray on self and society | publisher = Floris Books | location = Edinburgh | year = 1997 | isbn = 0863152368 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp | 14}} Recent years have seen the publication of the first full-length biography&lt;ref name=Costello/&gt; and a book-length critical study of his religious philosophy,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = McIntosh | first1 = Esther | title = John Macmurray's Religious Philosophy: What it Means to be a Person | publisher = Ashgate | year = 2011 | location = Burlington, VT | isbn = 9780754651635}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as volumes of selections from his works and books and articles about his work. [[Tony Blair]] contributed the foreword to one of the anthologies, in which he described Macmurray's philosophy as "immensely modern... in the sense that he confronted what will be the critical political question of the twenty-first century: the relationship between individual and society".&lt;ref name = Conford/&gt;{{rp | 9}}

'''Juan Donoso Cortés, marqués de Valdegamas''' (6 May 1809 – 3 May 1853) was a Spanish author, [[Conservatism|conservative]] and Catholic political theorist, and [[diplomat]]. He was a descendant, through his father Pedro Donoso Cortés, of the conquistador [[Hernando Cortés]].&lt;ref&gt;Botti, Alfonso (2006). "Donoso Cortés, Juan (1809–1853)." In: ''Encyclopedia of Modern Christian Politics.'' Westport: Greenwood Press, p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==

Cortés was born at [[Valle de la Serena]] ([[Extremadura]]). At 11, he had finished his education in the humanities, and at 12, he had begun the study of law at the [[University of Salamanca]]; at 16, he received his degree of licentiate from the [[University of Seville]], and at 18, he became professor of literature at the College of [[Cáceres, Spain|Caceres]].&lt;ref&gt;Neill, Thomas Patrick (1951). "Donoso Cortés." In: ''They Lived the Faith; Great Lay Leaders of Modern Times.'' Milwaukee: The Bruce Publishing Company, p. 244.&lt;/ref&gt;

Carried away by the [[rationalism]] prevalent in Spain following upon the French invasions, he ardently embraced the principles of [[Liberalism]] and fell under the influence of [[Jean-Jacques Rousseau]], whom he later characterized as "the most eloquent of sophists".

He entered politics as an ardent liberal under the influence of [[Manuel José Quintana]].&lt;ref&gt;Verdeguer, Suárez (1989). "Los Comienzos Parlamentarios de Donoso Cortés", ''Revista de Estudios Políticos'', No. 65, pp. 7–34.&lt;/ref&gt; His views began to modify after the rising at [[La Granja de San Ildefonso|La Granja]], approaching a counterrevolutionary outlook and became more marked on his appointment as private secretary to the Queen Regent. His political thought found its most lucid and orderly expression in his ''Lecciones de Derecho Politico'' (1837).

Alarmed by the proceedings of the [[History of france#Napoleon III: 1848–1871|French revolutionary party in 1848–1849]],&lt;ref&gt;Acedo Castilla, José Francisco (1956). ''Donoso Cortés y la Revolución del 1848.'' Sevilla: Sección de Crónicas y Publicaciones del Excmo. Ateneo de Sevilla.&lt;/ref&gt; Donoso Cortés issued his ''Ensayo Sobre el Catolicismo, el Liberalismo, y el Socialismo Considerados en sus Principios Fundamentales'' (1851),&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catholicworld05pauluoft#page/n5/mode/2up "Church and State,"] ''The Catholic World'', Vol. V, No. 25, 1867, pp. 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt; was written at the instance of [[Louis Veuillot]], who was an intimate friend of the author and places Cortés in the first rank of Catholic apologists and especially [[Ultramontanism]]. It is an exposition of the impotence of all human systems of philosophy to solve the problem of human destiny and of the absolute dependence of humanity upon the [[Catholic Church]] for its social and political salvation.

The ''Ensayo'' failed to arrest the movement fully against which it was directed, but, it remains amongst the finest specimen of political prose published in Spain during the 19th century.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

He became ambassador at Paris and died there on 3 May 1853.

Donoso Cortés's works were collected in five volumes at Madrid (1854–1855) under the editorship of Gavino Tejado.

==Influence==

In his ''Political Theology'' (1922), political philosopher [[Carl Schmitt]]&lt;ref&gt;McNamara, Vincent J. (1995). [http://www.unz.org/Pub/ModernAge-1995q1-00182 "Comments on Carl Schmitt and Juan Donoso Cortes,"] ''Modern Age'', Vol. 37, No. 2, pp. 182–185.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulmen, Gary (2002). "Carl Schmitt and Donoso Cortes," ''Telos'', No. 125, pp. 69–79.&lt;/ref&gt; devotes large portions of his final chapter ("On the Counterrevolutionary Philosophy of the State") to Donoso Cortés, praising him for recognizing the importance of the decision and of the concept of [[sovereignty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Schmitt| first = Carl | title=Political Theology: Four Chapters on the Concept of Sovereignty | publisher=University of Chicago Press | year=2005|isbn=0-226-73889-2 |pages=51–66}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==
"True progress consists in submitting the human element which corrupts liberty, to the divine element which purifies it. Society has followed a different path in looking upon the empire of faith as dead; and in proclaiming the empire of reason and the will of man, it has made evil, which was only relative, contingent and exceptional, absolute, universal, and necessary. This period of rapid retrogression commenced in Europe with the restoration of pagan literature, which has brought about successively the restoration of pagan philosophy, religious paganism, and political paganism. At the present time the world is on the eve of the last of these restorations, – that of pagan socialism." (Letter to [[Charles Forbes René de Montalembert|Montalembert]], June 4, 1849.)&lt;ref&gt;Quoted by Jean Joseph Gaume, ''Paganism in Education.'' London: Charles Dolman, 1852, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;

"It follows from this that the Church alone has the right to affirm and deny, and that there is no right outside her to affirm what she denies, or to deny what she affirms. The day when society, forgetting her doctrinal decisions, has asked the press and the tribune, news writers and assemblies, what is truth and what is error, on that day error and truth are confounded in all intellects, society enters on the regions of shadows, and falls under the empire of fictions…"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Essays on Catholicism, Liberalism and Socialism, Considered in their Fundamental Principles, tr. William McDonald. Dublin: M.H. Gill &amp; Son, 1879.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The doctrinal intolerance of the Church has saved the world from chaos. Her doctrinal intolerance has placed beyond question political, domestic, social, and religious, truths—primitive and holy truths, which are not subject to discussion, because they are the foundation of all discussions; truths which cannot be called into doubt for a moment without the understanding on that moment oscillating, lost between truth and error, and the clear mirror of human reason becoming soiled and obscured…"&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4270">'''Liberal naturalism''' is a heterodox form of [[metaphysical naturalism]] that lies in the conceptual space between [[scientific naturalism|scientific (or reductive) naturalism]] and [[supernaturalism]]. It allows that one can respect the explanations and results of the successful sciences without supposing that [[science|the sciences]] are our only resource for understanding humanity and our dealings with the world and each other.

The term was introduced in 2004 by [[Mario De Caro]] &amp; [[David Macarthur]]&lt;ref&gt;De Caro, M. &amp; Macarthur, D. ''Naturalism in Question'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, April 2004), p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; and, independently, by [[Gregg Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Rosenberg, Gregg, ''A Place for Consciousness: Probing the Deep Structure of the Natural World'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, November 2004), p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt; This form of naturalism has been ascribed to [[Immanuel Kant]].&lt;ref&gt;Hanna, Robert, ''Kant, Science, and Human Nature''. Clarendon Press, 2006, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
For a liberal naturalist many things in our everyday world that are not explicable (or not fully explicable) by science are, nonetheless, presupposed by science—e.g. tables, persons, artworks, institutions, rational norms and values. Explaining such things might require non-scientific non-supernatural resources according to this form of naturalism. So, rather than tailoring their [[ontology]] to the posits of the successful sciences, as scientific naturalists do, liberal naturalists recognise the prima facie irreducible reality of everyday objects that are part of what [[Wilfrid Sellars]] called "the manifest image".&lt;ref&gt;Sellars, W. ''Science, Perception &amp; Reality'' (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1963), ch. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

Liberal naturalism is a "liberal"&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, J. ''Mind, Value and Reason'' (Cambridge, Massachusetts: Harvard University Press, 1998), ch. 9.&lt;/ref&gt; or "[[Catholic (term)|catholic]]"&lt;ref&gt;Strawson, P. ''Skepticism and Naturalism: Some Varieties'' (New York: Columbia University Press, 1985).&lt;/ref&gt; naturalism for several reasons each of which contrasts with scientific naturalist orthodoxy:
# As we have seen, it does not limit its ontological commitments to the explanatory posits of the successful sciences. 
# It acknowledges the existence of non-scientific modes of knowing and/or understanding such things as the value of artworks, the moral dimension of persons, and the relations between reasons of different kinds;&lt;ref&gt;Putnam, H. "Pragmatism and Nonscientific Knowledge" in ''Hilary Putnam: Pragmatism and Realism'', ed. Urszula M. Zeglen and James Conant (London and New York: Routledge, 2002), 14-24&lt;/ref&gt; 
# It allows for distinctively 1st-personal aspects of [[rational agent|rational agency]] such as [[decision making|making up one's mind]], taking [[personal responsibility|responsibility for one's actions]], and [[self-consciousness]];&lt;ref&gt;McDowell, J. ''Mind and World'' (Cambridge Mass: Harvard University Press, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;
# It attempts to provide a non-reductive non-supernatural account of the rational or conceptual normativity to which we are responsive in theoretical and practical reasoning, e.g., by appeal to the Hegelian or pragmatist idea of mutual acknowledgement in a community;&lt;ref&gt;Macarthur, D. "Pragmatism, Metaphysical Quietism and the Problem of Normativity" in ''Philosophical Topics'', vol 36 no. 1 (2008).&lt;/ref&gt;
# It challenges the widely influential Quinean thesis that philosophy, when properly naturalized, must limit itself to the methods of the successful sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Quine, W. V. O. ''Theories and Things'' (Cambridge Mass: Harvard University Press, 1981), ch. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''List of Egyptian [[scribe]]s''', almost exclusively from the '''[[Ancient Egypt]]ian''' periods.

&lt;div&gt;The hieroglyph used to [[scribe equipment (hieroglyph)|signify the scribe]], ''to write'', and ''"writings"'', etc., is [[Gardiner's sign list|Gardiner]] sign Y3, &lt;hiero&gt;Y3&lt;/hiero&gt; from the category of: 'writings, games, &amp; music'. The hieroglyph contains the scribe's writing palette, a vertical case to hold writing-reeds, and a leather pouch to hold the colored ink blocks, mostly black and red.&lt;/div&gt;

[[File:Mcurado 2.jpg|thumb|Manuel Curado]]

'''Manuel Curado''' (born 1967) is a Portuguese essayist and philosopher dedicated to [[Biomedical Ethics]], [[Philosophy of Mind]], and the [[History of Ideas]]. He has worked the following issues: the intellectual history of the idea of a universal language and the idea of machine translation, or automatic translation, the problem of human consciousness and its relationship with the brain, the relationship between science and religion, studies about the European and Portuguese intellectual history, academic editions of works by ancient authors (namely the Eighteenth-century mathematician [[José Maria Dantas Pereira]], the logician [[Edmundo Curvelo]], and others), the history of Psychiatry and history of the Portuguese Jewish heritage in Medicine and Philosophy (namely, the work of medical doctors [[Isaac Samuda]] and [[Jacob de Castro Sarmento]]), and the history of literary representations of mental life.

Professor at the [[University of Minho]] (Braga, North of Portugal), Auditor of National Defence, Doctor cum laude from the [[University of Salamanca]], MA from the [[New University of Lisbon]]. He graduated from the [[Catholic University of Portugal]] (Lisbon). Holder of the Senior Management Course for Public Administration (CADAP). He was a visiting professor in Moscow, Russia (MGIMO and MGLU) and in Padua, Italy ([[Università degli Studi di Padova]]).

== Philosophical thought ==
Manuel Curado, in his PhD thesis (''The Hard Problem of Consciousness'') and in his more popular book ''Mysterious Light: Consciousness in the Physical World'', solves and dissolves the philosophical problem known as the hard problem of consciousness. The author formulates the hard problem of human consciousness as follows: why there is consciousness in the physical world when one could think about a world without consciousness at all? The philosopher’s answer to this question contends a solution by dissolving the very problem. The argument is developed around the possibility of overcoming the natural consciousness through scientific knowledge in order to produce artificial consciousness. According to the author, the problem is not going to be completely and preternaturally resolved because one has clear answers about what consciousness really is, or about what is the role of consciousness in the physical world, or about what is the causal power of consciousness, or about what is the relationship of consciousness to the brain, but because there is a growing scientific capacity to produce consciousness artificially. The philosopher envisions a future time when it will be impossible to distinguish between natural consciousness and artificially produced consciousness. This very impossibility to distinguish is interpreted as a normal epistemic condition that occurs in many other situations.&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Manuel Curado, [http://www.wook.pt/ficha/luz-misteriosa/a/id/191279 ''Luz Misteriosa: A Consciência no Mundo Físico''], Famalicão: Quasi, 2007, pp. 261-270.&lt;/ref&gt;

The most original philosophical thought of this philosopher is concerned with the relations between believers and the object of their faith or religious belief. The argument is developed in two ways. The relationship between the believer and God must be based on the assumption that God exists. However, this assumption does not imply necessarily the love of God or the respect of God. The relationship between God and humans is conceived in unique ways. Manuel Curado sees God as an object in the world, alongside predators against whom humans fought in their evolutionary past, along with the physical objects of nature, alongside the preternatural objects (inexplicable situations that occur rarely in history, like anomalies or lights in the sky) and alongside supernatural beings or objects (represented in many literary, religious, philosophical and testimonial ways from the very beginning of civilization). The philosopher's thesis is that humans are rivals or enemies of God and of all other beings that exist in the physical, preternatural and supernatural worlds. The most important point of his argument is the notion of interest. His essays often formulate this question: what is the true interest of human beings? Is it only the understanding of the world? It is being loved by a celestial father? Is it the search for meaning? Is it to survive in a hostile world? Or is it to invent themselves, dominating all other beings, including, of course, hypothetic supernatural beings?

Another way of thinking about the relationship between human beings and the objects that exist in the world is modern science. Manuel Curado argues that the interpretation that is usually offered about the scope and meaning of modern scientific activity is very poor. From his point of view, to try to understand the world is a very poor description of this scientific activity. The scientists describe the world, of course, but also invent and create new objects. Curado proposes a philosophical calculus of the ratio there is between the natural world and the artificial world. From his point of view, the natural world is getting smaller every day. He concludes from this situation that the radical interest of modern science is the creation of artificial worlds. As this trend grows in scope, the future will see the completion of this project. The conclusion he draws is that the ultimate concern of human beings is competing with God, not only in the neutral way of understanding the work of God. These very interesting ideas were presented in the essay "The Future of God", part of the edited book ''Why God If We Do Have Science?''&lt;ref&gt;Cf. Manuel Curado, [http://www.fronteiradocaoseditores.pt/rpensamento.php ''Porquê Deus se temos Ciência?''], Porto: Fronteira do Caos, 2009, pp. 85-164.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marthinus Versfeld''' (or '''Martin Versfeld''') (11 August 1909 – 18 April 1995)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://versindaba.co.za/2009/12/06/marthinus-versfeld-2/|title=Johann Lodewyk Marais. Marthinus Versfeld (2)|date=2009-12-06|work=Versindaba|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a South African philosopher. From 1937 to 1972 he taught at the [[University of Cape Town]]. He was celebrated as researcher, enjoyed the recognition of the [[South African literature|South African literary community]] and was known as an opponent of the [[Apartheid|Apartheid system]]. His work ranged from scholarly books to playful essays on issues like ethics, anthropology, the meaning of life.

== Life ==
Versfeld came from an Afrikaans family with a long history in the Western Cape region of South Africa. He attended the South African College Schools&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://versindaba.co.za/2009/12/06/marthinus-versfeld-2/|title=Johann Lodewyk Marais. Marthinus Versfeld (2)|date=2009-12-06|work=Versindaba|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; and did his undergraduate and Master's studies at the University of Cape Town. He moved on to Glasgow where he completed his doctoral dissertation on Descartes' metaphysics under the supervision of Archibald Bowman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gla.ac.uk/services/archives/news/dunaskinnews200207/archibaldallanbowman1883-1936professorofmoralphilosophy1926-36/|title=University of Glasgow - MyGlasgow - Archive Services - News - Dunaskin News 2002/07 - Archibald Allan Bowman (1883-1936), Professor of Moral Philosophy, 1926-36|website=www.gla.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 he was appointed as lecturer at UCT where he was to spend his entire career.

During his student years he became disaffected from the Protestant faith in which he was raised. However in the late 1930s he went through a time of serious religious uncertainty. Eventually, he converted to Catholicism in the early 1940s.

== Work ==
After the publication of his thesis as ''An essay on the metaphysics of Descartes'' (1940), Versfeld's first book was the polemical ''Oor gode en afgode [On gods and idols]'' (1948). This book contains a damning critique of war, exploitation and racism. He argued that "Christian nationalism" – a key concept from the Apartheid ideology – was a contradiction in terms.

Arguably Versfeld's most systematic books are ''The perennial order'' (1954) and ''The mirror of philosophers'' (1962). One finds in these books his engagement with Medieval philosophy – particularly Augustine and Aquinas – as well as with modern and contemporary philosophers. His work is characterised by the quest for an ethic of humaneness and care for the environment. This ethic is developed from intensive studies in philosophical anthropology. In the horizon of his work remains his opposition to the injust political dispensation in South Africa.

The bulk of his philosophy was published in collections of scholarly essays. He did, however, also publish translations, commentaries and essays for the broader public.

The nexus of anthropology and ethics is arguably the most important theme running through his work of the 1960s and 1970s. The playfulness and humour, as well as his ethic of simplicity – themes for which he became best known – appear in these works, as they did since ''Klip en klei'' (1968). One also notices the gradual increase in his attention to classical Eastern wisdom: he offered a translation of Lao-Tzu's ''Tao te ching'' (''Die lewensweg van Lao-Tse'', 1988) and a series of essays, especially in ''Our selves'' and in ''Pots and poetry'' (1985). Eating became a central motive in his ethics, as is witnessed by ''Food for thought'' (1983)

== Major themes ==

=== Religion ===
All Versfeld's work bear the trace of his religious convictions. However, it is not possible to give a single characterisation of the way this conviction affected his work. In the 1948 book, ''Oor gode en afgode'' one finds him lauding the early Christian Church's anti-imperialism (the Second World War serves as background for this)&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Oor gode en afgode''2d edition, p. 121.&lt;/ref&gt; or, again, advocating a version of "Christian science". At the same time, this fervour is strongly opposed to the petit-bourgeous morality of South African cultural conservatism and it is explicitly against the ideological combination of "Christian Nationalism".

In his later work, Versfeld expresses his critique of religious apologetics – against "some superficial fools who write books on apologetics".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Our selves'' 2d edition, p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of his life, he reiterated this view: “there are works of Catholic apologetics of the very recent past which claim to provide all the answers, falling very far short of the wisdom of the sage in Chuang-zu (22.1) who said: ‘We come nowhere being near right, since we have the answers.”&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''St. Augustine's Confessions and the City of God'', p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, he acknowledged the ambiguity of his own faith: "To be a Christian cannot possibly mean to conform to a type or to coincide with the paradigm case. And if you are asked by anybody with such an idea in the back of his mind, whether you are a Christian, it is intensely embarrassing. You may say no, not because you are Judas, but because you are trying not to be."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Our selves'', 2d edition, p. 111.&lt;/ref&gt; Still later, he would conclude: "True religion finds itself comic.".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pots and poetry'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; This almost negative-theological trait of his later religious thought is accompanied by a secularising turn – his later philosophy is shot through with the conviction that "The secular is the miraculous."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Food for thought'', p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Anthropology and philosophy ===
Much earlier this not-knowing was already at the centre of his philosophical anthropology. In the autobiographical essay, "Descartes and me" (1960), Versfeld described his intellectual development as the move away from the certainty of the Cartesian ''cogito'' to the Augustine’s "''factus eram ipse mihi magna questio'', I became a great puzzle to myself."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''SUM''. p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the one hand, this affected Versfeld’s self-understanding as a philosopher. In 1960 he could describe his work as "post-modern".&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''SUM'', p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt; The playfulness that increasingly characterise his work in the later decades, could be construed as the appropriation of the fundamental uncertainty at the centre of his thought. Hence he could open his 1971 inaugural lecture as follows: “I must confess at once that I do not know what philosophy is. This sometimes embarrasses me before the innocence of students, but not before those who have come to realise that the things by which we live are the things about which we know least. We do not know what life is, or what knowing is, or what truth and goodness are.”&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Persons'', p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt; In later years he would drive this irony to its utmost: “I have fought a long duel with seriousness. That is why there is no need to take me seriously.”&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pots and poetry'', p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, Versfeld took over from both Descartes and Augustine the central significance of understanding the human being for his philosophy. This is reflected in the titles of books such as ''Our selves'' or ''Persons''. In fact, he claimed that "Philosophy ought to start with anthropology in the Continental use of the term. What comes first is not theory of knowledge, but the problem of the being of man [sic]."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Our selves'', second edition, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt;

Essentially, this problem of being human has to do with the conflict between two selves:&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pots and poetry'', p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt; the real, historically situated, but nevertheless abysmally mysterious self and the pathological masquerades thereof, the grasping, dominating, manipulating self. Never is there question of a moralising choice for the first at the expense of the second. Rather, Versfeld is attentive to the inevitable cohabitation of the two.

=== Social and political thought ===
Nevertheless, this does not take away from the importance he attaches to the first. And the distortions of the self – distortions to which Descartes and other modern philosophers gave philosophical expression – are reflected in the socio-political pathologies of modernity: its "dominative epistemology",&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Pots and poetry'', p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; its destruction of nature, its wars and exploitation of people.

This socio-political critique remains far from abstract. Although there is no sustained examination of the apartheid state in Versfeld’s work, his judgement on the injustice and harm of this system is clearly expressed: “The whites accelerated their self-exploitation by means of the exploitation of other races. Through their ingenuity in the sphere of transport and explosives they were in the position to utilise the non-whites as means for their own ends.”&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Oor gode en afgode'', second edition, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt; and in the religious parlance that was his in the 1948 book, he categorically rejects “racial discrimination, one-sided patriotism, participation in unjust war, exploitation, etc.”&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Oor gode en afgode'', second edition, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, he writes in 1971 “we are bedevilled by a racialist capitalism exacerbated by our industrial and technological revolution, which justifies itself by a scriptural literalism.”&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''Persons'', p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt; His dissatisfaction with the contemporary solutions to the country’s political situation is captured succinctly as follows: “On the one hand we have the inadequate response of a nominalism of race, and on the other the conceptualism of abstract liberalism. One produces a variety without love, and the other a unity without significant differences. The creation of a nation requires the analogical mind which will accept the situation as matter seeking form, respect the variety, and seek the solution of charity.”&lt;ref&gt;Cf. ''The mirror of philosophers'', p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt; But he could also argue his case in terms of human rights, by concluding in 1960 that: “If these rights belong to every man whatever his race and colour and by virtue solely of his being made for the truth, their preservation is the due of every man to every man. This prescribes that the means employed may not include trickery, outrage, lies or robbery. Justice is colour-blind, and requires for its realisation that we should see, beyond the contingencies of biology and history the image of truth in every man, which often in spite of himself is striving for expression in a common world. These contingencies are relevant as the material in which justice must be realised. But one could make no greater mistake than to mistake the matter for the form, that is, to give justice a racial expression instead of giving race a just expression. This applies impartially to black, white, and yellow since as justice is man's universal due, the doom of injustice done also works impartially upon all. What we have to do with is a law of human nature which extends to its metaphysical roots. It is a prescription to human wills before it is a prescription by them, and as such is as unalterable as the law of gravity."&lt;ref&gt;Cf. "On justice and human rights", ''Acta juridica'' 1, 1960, pp1-10, here p. 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Influence and recognition ==
Versfeld exerted a broad influence on students, philosophers, activists and authors of literature. Among his students count [[Athol Fugard]], [[Adam Small (writer)|Adam Small]], [[Jeremy Cronin]],&lt;ref&gt;For these three names, see the report http://versindaba.co.za/tag/jeremy-cronin/&lt;/ref&gt; [[Breyten Breytenbach]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.litnet.co.za/die-koei-in-die-bos/|title=US-konvokasietoespraak: Die koei in die bos {{!}} LitNet|date=2016-01-26|work=LitNet|access-date=2018-01-08|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Rick Turner (philosopher)|Richard Turner]], Augustine Shutte and Jane Carruthers.&lt;ref&gt;Carruthers, Jane.

{{EarlyBuddhism}}

The '''Mūlasarvāstivāda''' ([[Sanskrit]]: मूलसर्वास्तिवाद; {{CJKV|t=根本說一切有部|p=Gēnběn Shuō Yīqièyǒu Bù}}) was one of the [[early Buddhist schools]] of [[India]]. The origins of the Mūlasarvāstivāda and their relationship to the [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]] sect still remain largely unknown, although various theories exist.

The continuity of the Mūlasarvāstivāda monastic order remains in [[Tibetan Buddhism]], although until recently, only Mūlasarvāstivādin [[Bhikkhu|bhikṣus]] (monks) existed: the [[bhikkhuni|bhikṣuṇī]] order had never been introduced.

==History==
===In India===
The relationship of the Mūlasarvāstivāda to the Sarvāstivāda school is a matter of dispute; modern scholars lean towards classifying them as independent.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Willemen, Bart Dessein, Collett Cox. ''Sarvāstivāda Buddhist scholasticism''. Brill, 1988. p.88.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] claimed that they derived their name from being an offshoot of Sarvāstivāda, but [[Buton Rinchen Drub]] stated that the name was a homage to Sarvāstivāda as the "root" (''mūla'') of all Buddhist schools.&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Cook. ''Light of Liberation: A History of Buddhism in India''. Dharma Publishing, 1992. p. 237&lt;/ref&gt; A number of theories have been posited by academics as to how the two are related, which Bhikkhu Sujato summaries as follows:

{{quote|The uncertainty around this school has led to a number of hypotheses. Frauwallner’s theory holds that the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya is the disciplinary code of an early Buddhist community based in [[Mathura]], which was quite independent in its establishment as a monastic community from the Sarvāstivādins of [[Kashmir|Kaśmir]] (although of course this does not mean that they were different in terms of doctrine). Lamotte, opposing Frauwallner, asserts that the Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya was a late Kaśmīr compilation made to complete the Sarvāstivādin Vinaya. Warder suggests that the Mūlasarvāstivādins were a later development of the Sarvāstivāda, whose main innovations were literary, the compilation of the large Vinaya and the ''Saddharmasmṛtyupasthāna Sūtra'', which kept the early doctrines but brought the style up to date with contemporary literary developments. Enomoto pulls the rug out from all these theories by asserting that Sarvāstivādin and Mūlasarvāstivādin are really the same. Meanwhile, Willemen, Dessein, and Cox have developed the theory that the [[Sautrantika]]s, a branch or tendency within the Sarvāstivādin group of schools, emerged in [[Gandhāra]] and Bactria around 200 CE. Although they were the earlier group, they temporarily lost ground to the Kaśmīr [[Vaibhāṣika|Vaibhāśika]] school due to the political influence of [[Kaṇiṣka]]. In later years the Sautrantikas became known as Mūlasarvāstivādins and regained the ascendancy. I have elsewhere given my reasons for disagreeing with the theories of Enomoto and Willemen et al. Neither Warder nor Lamotte give sufficient evidence to back up their theories. We are left with Frauwallner's theory, which in this respect has stood the test of time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bhikkhu Sujato|title=Sects &amp; Sectarianism: The origins of Buddhist Schools |url=https://santifm.org/santipada/2010/sects-sectarianism/|page=135|year=2012|publisher=Santipada|ISBN=9781921842061}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

According to Gregory Schopen, the Mūlasarvāstivāda developed during the 2nd century CE and went into decline in India by the 7th century.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory Schopen. ''Figments and fragments of Māhāyana Buddhism in India''. University of Hawaii Press, 2005. pp.76-77.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In Central Asia===
The Mūlasarvāstivāda were prevalent at times throughout [[Central Asia]] due to missionary activities performed in the region. A number of scholars identify three distinct major phases of missionary activities seen in the history of [[Buddhism in Central Asia]], which are associated with the following sects chronologically:&lt;ref&gt;Willemen, Charles. Dessein, Bart. Cox, Collett. ''Sarvastivada Buddhist Scholasticism.'' 1997. p. 126&lt;/ref&gt;

# [[Dharmaguptaka]]
# [[Sarvastivada|Sarvāstivāda]]
# Mūlasarvāstivāda

===In Śrīvijaya===
In the 7th century, [[Yijing (monk)|Yijing]] writes that the Mūlasarvāstivāda were prominent throughout the kingdom of [[Srivijaya|Śrīvijaya]] (modern day [[Indonesia]]). Yijing stayed in Śrīvijaya for six to seven years, during which time he studied Sanskrit and translated Sanskrit texts into Chinese. Yijing states that the Mūlasarvāstivāda vinaya was almost universally adopted in this area.&lt;ref&gt;Coedes, George. ''The Indianized States of South-East Asia.'' 1968. p. 84&lt;/ref&gt; He writes that the subjects studied, as well as the rules and ceremonies, were essentially the same in this region as they were in India.&lt;ref name="Takakusu"&gt;{{cite book |author=J. Takakusu |coauthors= |title=A Record of the Buddhist Religion : As Practised in India and the Malay Archipelago (A.D. 671-695)/I-Tsing. |year=1896 |publisher=Oxford: Clarendon. Reprint: New Delhi, AES 2005 |quote= | url=https://archive.org/details/recordofbuddhist00ichi |isbn=81-206-1622-7 }}{{Page needed|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yijing described these islands as generally "[[Hīnayāna]]" in orientation, but writes that the [[Melayu Kingdom]] included [[Mahāyāna]] teachings such as [[Asanga|Asaṅga]]'s ''[[Yogacarabhumi-sastra|Yogācārabhūmi Śāstra]]''.

==Vinaya lineage==
The Mūlasarvāstivāda vinaya is one of three surviving vinaya lineages, along with the Dharmaguptaka and [[Theravāda]]. The Tibetan Emperor [[Ralpacan]] restricted Buddhist ordination to the Mūlasarvāstivādin vinaya. As Mongolian Buddhism was introduced from Tibet, Mongolian ordination follows this rule as well.

The Mūlasarvāstivāda Vinaya is extant in Tibetan (9th century translation) and Chinese (8th century translation), and to some extent in the original Sanskrit.

'''Pan-African Socialist Party''' ({{lang-fr|Parti socialiste panafricain}}, PSP) was a [[Togo]]lese [[political party]] advocating [[socialism]] and [[pan-Africanism]]. It was founded in the early 1990s in response to Togo's legalization of opposition parties. After the assassination of its first and brightest leader, [[Tavio Amorin]], in July 1992, the party fell into obscurity. The Togolese police were responsible for the killing.

The '''Professional-Managerial class''' was an influential [[New Class]] hypothesis in [[social science]] in the United States in the 1970s by John and [[Barbara Ehrenreich]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ehrenreich|first=John| title=Between Labor and Capital|year=1979|publisher=South End Press|location=Boston|isbn=0-89608-037-4|edition=1st|author2=Barbara Ehrenreich |editor=Pat Walker}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ehrenreichs hypothesized a [[social class]] within [[capitalism]] that, by controlling production processes through superior management skills, was neither [[proletarian]] nor [[bourgeois]]. This hypothesis contributed to the [[Marxist]] debates on class in [[Fordism]] and was used as an analytical category in the examination of non-proletarian employees.

This group of [[middle class]] professionals is distinguished from other social classes by their training and education, typically business qualifications and university degrees,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Philip|first=Green|title=Retrieving Democracy: In Search of Civic Equality|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/middle-class#cite_note-25|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield}}&lt;/ref&gt; with occupations including [[academics]], [[teachers]], [[social workers]], [[engineers]], [[managers]], [[nurses]], and middle-level [[Administrator (business)|administrators]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Kellner|first=Hansfried|title=Hidden Technocrats: The New Class and New Capitalism|url=http://www.answers.com/topic/middle-class#cite_note-26|publisher=Transaction Publishers|author2=Frank W. Heuberger |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The professional-managerial class tends to have incomes above the average for their country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Gail|first=Kelly|title=Women's higher education in comparative perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V-CKcuRAu8EC&amp;pg=PA254&amp;dq=Professional+Managerial+Class+salary&amp;q=Professional+Managerial+Class+salary&amp;hl=en#v=snippet&amp;q=Professional%20Managerial%20Class%20salary&amp;f=false|publisher=Springer|author2=Sheila Slaughter |year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is estimated that in the [[United States]] during 1930, people in professional-managerial class occupations made up less than 1 percent of total employment. In 1972, about 24 percent of American jobs were in professional-managerial class occupations. By 1983 the number had risen to 28 percent and in 2006, 35 percent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ehrenreich|first=Barbara|title=Barbara and John Ehrenreich: The Real Story Behind the Crash and Burn of America's Managerial Class|url=http://www.alternet.org/economy/barbara-and-john-ehrenreich-real-story-behind-crash-and-burn-americas-managerial-class?page=0%2C0|work=AlterNet|accessdate=18 November 2013|author2=John Ehrenreich |date=February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Ravidassia}}
'''Ravidas''' was a [[North India]]n mystic [[Sant Mat|poet-sant]] of the [[bhakti movement]] during the 15th to 16th century CE.&lt;ref name=jameslraidas/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopediabritraidas/&gt; Venerated as a ''[[guru]]'' (teacher) in the region of [[Punjab, India|Punjab]], [[Uttar Pradesh]], [[Rajasthan]], [[Maharashtra]] and Madhya Pradesh   the devotional songs of Ravidas made a lasting impact upon the bhakti movement. He was a poet-saint, social reformer and a spiritual figure. He is considered as the founder of 21st-century [[Ravidassia religion]], by a group who previously were associated with [[Sikhism]].&lt;ref name=ravidassiareligion1/&gt;

The life details of Ravidas are uncertain and contested. Most scholars believe he was born about 1450 CE,&lt;ref name=asharmaraidas/&gt; in a family that worked with dead animals skin to produce leather products and very much known in India as [[untouchability|untouchables]].&lt;ref name=jameslraidas/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopediabritraidas/&gt; Tradition and medieval era texts state Ravidas was one of the disciples of the [[brahmin]] bhakti saint-poet [[Ramananda]].&lt;ref name=pande/&gt;&lt;ref name=lorenzen/&gt;

Ravidas' devotional songs were included in the Sikh Scriptures, [[Guru Granth Sahib]].&lt;ref name=encyclopediabritraidas/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Callewaert and Friedlander, ''The Life and Works of Ravidass Ji'', Manohar, Delhi, 1992, quoted in Gavin Flood, ''An Introduction to Hinduism'', Cambridge 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Panch Vani'' text of the Dadupanthi tradition within Hinduism also includes numerous poems of Ravidas.&lt;ref name=jameslraidas/&gt; Ravidas taught removal of social divisions of [[caste system in India|caste]] and gender, and promoted unity in the pursuit of personal spiritual freedoms.&lt;ref name="google727"&gt;{{cite book|author=Phyllis G. Jestice|title=Holy People of the World: A Cross-Cultural Encyclopedia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=H5cQH17-HnMC|accessdate=8 December 2012|year=2004|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-57607-355-1|pages=727–728}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
The details of Ravidas' life are not well known because he was from a lower caste family and that time this caste was not recorded by upper caste writters. Most scholars state he was born about 1450, and died about 1520.&lt;ref name=asharmaraidas/&gt;&lt;ref name="google727"/&gt;

Ravidas was born in the village of [[Sir Gobardhan|Seer Goverdhanpur]], near [[Varanasi]] in what is now Uttar Pradesh, India. His birthplace is now known as Shri Guru Ravidas Janam Asthan. Mata Ghurbinia  was his mother, and his father was Raghuram.&lt;ref name=eosravidas&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.learnpunjabi.org/eos/index.aspx |title=Ravidas |author=Hardev Bahri |editor=Harbans Singh et al| website=Encyclopaedia of Sikhism |publisher=Punjabi University Patiala |accessdate=11 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; His parents belonged to a leather-working Chamar community making them an untouchable caste .&lt;ref name=jameslraidas/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopediabritraidas&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/1350770/Ravidas |title= Bhagat Ravidass Ji (Indian mystic and poet) – Britannica Online Encyclopedia |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=10 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; While his original occupation was leather work, he began to spend most of his time in spiritual pursuits at bank of river Ganga .&lt;ref name=eosravidas/&gt; Thereafter he spent most of his life in the company of sufi saints, sadhus and ascetics.&lt;ref name=eosravidas/&gt;

The text ''Anantadas Parcai'', one of the earliest surviving biographies of various Bhakti movement poets, introduces the birth of Ravidas as follows,&lt;ref name=winnandraidas/&gt;

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
In Banaras, that best of cities, no evil ever visits men.
No one who dies ever goes to hell, Shankar himself comes with the Name of Ram.
Where [[Sruti]] and [[Smriti]] have authority, '''there Raidas was reborn''',
in the home of a low-caste Shakta, his father and mother were both Chamars.

In his previous birth he was a Brahmin,
he listened all the time to religious recitation, but did not give up meat.
For this sin, he was born into a low-caste family,
but he remembered his previous birth.
&lt;/poem&gt;

Medieval era texts, such as the ''[[Bhaktamal]]'' suggest that Ravidas was not the disciples of the [[Brahmin]] ''[[bhakti]]'' -poet [[Ramananda]].&lt;ref name=pande&gt;Rekha Pande (2014), Divine Sounds from the Heart—Singing Unfettered in their Own Voices, Cambridge Scholars Publishers, {{ISBN|978-1443825252}}, pages 76-77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lorenzen&gt;[[David Lorenzen]] (1996), Praises to a Formless God: Nirguni Texts from North India, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791428054}}, page 268&lt;/ref&gt; He is traditionally considered as Kabir's younger contemporary.&lt;ref name=jameslraidas&gt;James Lochtefeld (2002), The Illustrated Encyclopedia of Hinduism: N-Z, Rosen Publishing, {{ISBN|978-0823931804}}, page 569&lt;/ref&gt;

His ideas and fame grew over his lifetime, and texts suggest Brahmins (members of priestly upper caste) used to bow before him.&lt;ref name=encyclopediabritraidas/&gt; He travelled extensively, visiting Hindu pilgrimage sites in Andhra Pradesh, Maharashtra, Gujarat, Rajasthan and those in the Himalayas. He abandoned saguna (with attributes, image) forms of supreme beings, and focussed on the nirguna (without attributes, abstract) form of supreme beings.&lt;ref name=eosravidas/&gt; As his poetic hymns in regional languages inspired others, people from various background sought his teachings and guidance.&lt;ref name=eosravidas/&gt;

Most scholars believe that Ravidas met [[Guru Nanak Dev Ji]], the founder of Sikhism.&lt;ref name=encyclopediabritraidas/&gt; He is revered in the Sikh scripture, and 41 of Ravidas' poems are included in the [[Adi Granth]]. These poems are one of the oldest attested source of his ideas and literary works.&lt;ref name=jameslraidas/&gt;&lt;ref name=encyclopediabritraidas/&gt; Another substantial source of legends and stories about the life of Ravidas is the [[hagiography]] in the Sikh tradition, named ''Premambodha''.&lt;ref name=friedlandermyths/&gt; This text, composed over 150 years after Ravidas' death, in 1693, includes him as one of the seventeen saints of Indian religious tradition.&lt;ref name=friedlandermyths/&gt; The 17th-century Nabhadas's [[Bhaktamal]], and the ''Parcais'' of Anantadas, both contain chapters on Ravidas.&lt;ref&gt;Winnand Callewaert (2000), The Hagiographies of Anantadas: The Bhakti Poets of North India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700713318}}, pages 1-4&lt;/ref&gt; Other than these, the scriptures and texts of Sikh tradition and the Hindu Dadupanthi traditions, most other written sources about the life of Ravidas, including by the Ravidasi (followers of Ravidas), were composed in the early 20th century, or about 400 years after his death.&lt;ref name=friedlandermyths/&gt;

Over time new manuscripts of ''Parcais of Anantadas'' were reproduced, some in different local languages of India.&lt;ref&gt;Winand Callewaert (2003), Pilgrims, Patrons, and Place: Localizing Sanctity in Asian Religions (Editors: Phyllis Granoff and Koichi Shinohara), University of British Columbia Press, {{ISBN|978-0774810395}}, pages 203-223&lt;/ref&gt; Winnand Callewaert notes that some 30 manuscripts of Anantadas's hagiography on Ravidas have been found in different parts of India.&lt;ref name=winnandintro&gt;Winnand Callewaert (2000), The Hagiographies of Anantadas: The Bhakti Poets of North India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700713318}}, pages 303-307&lt;/ref&gt; Of these four manuscripts are complete, collated and have been dated to 1662, 1665, 1676 and 1687. The first three are close with some morphological variants without affecting the meaning, but the 1687 version systematically inserts verses into the text, at various locations, with caste-related statements, new claims of Brahmins persecuting Ravidas, notes on the untouchability of Ravidas, claims of Kabir giving Ravidas ideas, ridicules of nirguni and saguni ideas, and such text corruption:&lt;ref&gt;Winnand Callewaert (2000), The Hagiographies of Anantadas: The Bhakti Poets of North India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700713318}}, pages 316-334&lt;/ref&gt;

:Then the king called Raidas, who went to see him along with his companions,
:The king said: "Listen Raidas; the Brahmins are disturbed and make a lot of noise. (inserted before Chapter 5, verse 1)

:We organize donations and worship, but Raidas replied: "Listen to me Brahmins,
:You deceive the king and the people, you leave the right path and take them on the wrong path. (inserted into Chapter 5, verse 6)

:In a low caste you were born, you have no right to perform rituals. (inserted into Chapter 5, verse 12)

:Since the earliest times Brahmins have been respected, and even more so in this Kaliyug,
:Nobody will touch an untouchable, how can he become like a Dahma Brahmin. (inserted into Chapter 5, verse 15)

:This ''nirgun'' devotion concentrating only on the Name, could not at all appeal to the queen. (inserted into Chapter 6, verse 12)

|Winnand Callewaert|The Hagiographies of Anantadas: The Bhakti Poets of North India&lt;ref&gt;Winnand Callewaert (2000), The Hagiographies of Anantadas: The Bhakti Poets of North India, Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700713318}}, pages 315-317&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Callewaert considers the 1676 version as the standard version, his critical edition of Ravidas's hagiography excludes all these insertions, and he remarks that the cleaner critical version of Anantadas's ''parcais'' suggests that there is more in common in the ideas of bhakti movement's Ravidas, Kabir and Sen than previously thought.&lt;ref name=winnandintro/&gt;

Khare similarly has questioned the textual sources on Ravidas, and mentions there are few "readily available and reliable textual sources on the Hindu and Untouchable treatment of Ravidas."&lt;ref name=khareintro&gt;Ravindra S Khare (1985), The Untouchable as Himself, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521263146}}, pages 41-47&lt;/ref&gt;

== Literary works ==
The ''Adi Granth'' of Sikhs, and ''Panchvani'' of the Hindu warrior-ascetic group ''Dadupanthis'' are the two oldest attested sources of the literary works of Ravidas.&lt;ref name=jameslraidas/&gt; In the ''Adi Granth'', forty of Ravidas's poems are included, and he is one of thirty six contributors to this foremost canonical scripture of Sikhism.&lt;ref name=pashaurasingh&gt;Pashaura Singh (2012), Fighting Words: Religion, Violence, and the Interpretation of Sacred Texts (Editor: John Renard), University of California Press, {{ISBN|978-0520274198}}, pages 202-207&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=gschauhan&gt;GS Chauhan (2009), Bani Of Bhagats, Hemkunt Press, {{ISBN|978-8170103561}}, pages 41-55&lt;/ref&gt; This compilation of poetry in Adi Granth responds to, among other things, issues of dealing with conflict and tyranny, war and resolution, and willingness to dedicate one's life to the right cause.&lt;ref name=pashaurasingh/&gt; Ravidas's poetry covers topics such as the definition of a just state where there are no second or third class unequal citizens, the need for dispassion, and who is a real [[Yoga|Yogi]].&lt;ref name=gschauhan/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J Kaur (2005), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/41856155 The Concept of Peace and the Guru Granth Sahib], The Indian Journal of Political Science, Volume 66, Number 3, pages 649-660&lt;/ref&gt;

Jeffrey Ebbesen notes that, just like other bhakti sant-poets of India and some cases of Western literature authorship, many poems composed by later era Indian poets have been attributed to Ravidas, as an act of reverence, even though Ravidas has had nothing to do with these poems or ideas expressed therein.&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Ebbesen (1995), Literary India: Comparative Studies in Aesthetics, Colonialism, and Culture (Editors: Patrick Colm Hogan, Lalita Pandit), State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791423950}}, pages 53-55&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ravidas literature as symbolism ===
Peter Friedlander states that Ravidas' hagiographies, though authored long after he died, depict a struggle within the Indian society, where Ravidas' life gives a means to express a variety of social and spiritual themes.&lt;ref name=friedlandermyths/&gt; At one level, it depicts a struggle between the then prevalent heterodox communities and the orthodox Brahminical tradition. At another level, the legends are an inter-communal, inter-religious struggle with an underlying search and desire for social unity. At yet another level, states Friedlander, the stories describe the spiritual struggle of an individual unto self.&lt;ref name=friedlandermyths&gt;Peter Friedlander (1996), Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition (Editor: Julia Leslie), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700703036}}, pages 106-114&lt;/ref&gt;

There is no historical evidence to verify the [[historicity]] in these hagiographies, which range from Ravidas's struggle with Hindu Brahmins,&lt;ref&gt;Peter Friedlander (1996), Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition (Editor: Julia Leslie), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700703036}}, pages 109-110&lt;/ref&gt; to his struggle with Muslim Sultan [[Sikander Lodi]].&lt;ref&gt;Peter Friedlander (1996), Myth and Mythmaking: Continuous Evolution in Indian Tradition (Editor: Julia Leslie), Routledge, {{ISBN|978-0700703036}}, pages 108, 112-117&lt;/ref&gt; Friedlander states that the stories reflect the social dynamics that influenced the composers of the hagiographies during the 17th- to 20th-century. These are legends where Ravidas is victorious because God intervened with miracles such as making a stone float in water, or making river [[Ganges]] to reverse course and flow upstream.&lt;ref name=friedlandermyths/&gt;

[[David Lorenzen]] similarly states that poetry attributed to Ravidas, and championed by ''Ravidasi'' (his followers) from the 17th- through the 20th-century, have a strong anti-Brahminical and anti-communal theme.&lt;ref name=lorenzenravidasi/&gt; The legends, suggests Lorenzen, cannot be separated from the power and political situation of this era, and they reflect a strong element of social and religious dissent by groups marginalized during a period when Indian society was under the Islamic rule and later the colonial rule.&lt;ref name=lorenzenravidasi&gt;David Lorenzen (1995), Bhakti Religion in North India: Community Identity and Political Action, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791420256}}, pages 105-116, 292-303&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=neeti/&gt;

== Philosophy ==
The songs of Ravidas discuss ''[[Bhakti movement#Theosophy of bhakti movement: Nirguna and Saguna Brahman|Nirguna-Saguna]]'' themes, as well as ideas that are at the foundation of Nath [[Yoga (philosophy)|Yoga]] philosophy of Hinduism.&lt;ref name=peterheehs/&gt; He frequently mentions the term ''Sahaj'', a mystical state where there is a union of the truths of the many and the one.&lt;ref name=peterheehs/&gt;

{{Quote|
&lt;poem&gt;
Raidas says, what shall I sing?
 Singing, singing I am defeated.
How long shall I consider and proclaim:
 absorb the [[Atman (Hinduism)|self]] into the Self?

This experience is such,
 that it defies all description.
I have met the Lord,
 Who can cause me harm?

[[Krishna|Hari]] in everything, everything in Hari –
 For him who knows Hari and the sense of self,
no other testimony is needed:
 the knower is absorbed.
&lt;/poem&gt;
|Ravidas|Translated by Winand Callewaert and Peter Friedlander&lt;ref name=peterheehs/&gt;}}

David Lorenzen states Ravidas's poetry is imbued with themes of boundless loving devotion to God, wherein this divine is envisioned as ''Nirguna''.&lt;ref&gt;David Lorenzen (1995), Bhakti Religion in North India: Community Identity and Political Action, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791420256}}, page 107&lt;/ref&gt; In the Sikh tradition, the themes of [[Nanak]]'s poetry are very broadly similar to the ''Nirgun bhakti'' ideas of Ravidas and other leading north Indian sant-poets.&lt;ref name=neeti&gt;Neeti M Sadarangani (2004), Bhakti Poetry in Medieval India: Its Inception, Cultural Encounter and Impact, Swarup &amp; Sons, {{ISBN|978-8176254366}}, pages i-xv, 115, 55-60, 72-76&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Shackle (2014), The Oxford Handbook of Sikh Studies (Editors: Pashaura Singh, Louis E. Fenech), Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0199699308}}, page 111&lt;/ref&gt; Most postmodern scholars, states Karen Pechilis, consider Ravidas's ideas to belong to the ''Nirguna'' philosophy within the [[bhakti movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Karen Pechilis Prentiss (2014), The Embodiment of Bhakti, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|978-0195351903}}, page 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Monistic Brahman or Anthropomorphic God===
Multiple manuscripts found in [[Rajasthan]] and [[Uttar Pradesh]], dated to be from the 18th and 19th centuries, contain a [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|theosophical]] debate between [[Kabir]] and Ravidas on the nature of the Absolute, more specifically whether the [[Brahman]] (Ultimate Reality, Eternal Truth) is monistic Oneness or a separate anthropomorphic incarnate.&lt;ref name=lorenzenmon/&gt; Kabir argues for the former. Ravidas, in contrast, argues from the latter premise to the effect that both are one.&lt;ref name=lorenzenmon/&gt; In these manuscripts, Kabir initially prevails, Ravidas accepts that Brahman is monistic, but till the end Kabir didn't accepts worshipping a divine [[avatar]] (''sagun'' conception)  but he was strongly accepted that realizing the Oneness and the presence of the divine in everyone, everything.&lt;ref name=lorenzenmon&gt;[[David Lorenzen]] (1996), Praises to a Formless God: Nirguni Texts from North India, State University of New York Press, {{ISBN|978-0791428054}}, pages 169-170&lt;/ref&gt;

===One man: two divergent claims on his views and philosophy===
Ravindra Khare&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra S Khare (1985), The Untouchable as Himself, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521263146}}, pages 41, 46&lt;/ref&gt; states that there are two divergent versions that emerge from the study of texts relating to Ravidas's philosophy. The 17th century [[Bhaktamal]] text by Nabhadas provides one version, while the 20th century texts by [[Dalit]]s&lt;ref&gt;modern term for those previously called untouchables&lt;/ref&gt; provide another.&lt;ref name=khareintro/&gt;

According to ''Bhaktamal'' text, Ravidas was of pure speech, capable of resolving spiritual doubts of those who held discussions with him, was unafraid to state his humble origins and real caste.&lt;ref name=khare17century/&gt; Further, the ''Bhaktamal'' text states that Ravidas's teachings agreed with [[Vedas|Vedic]] and ancient scriptures, he subscribed to [[nondualism]], discussed spiritual ideas and philosophy with everyone including Brahmins without gender or caste discrimination, and his abilities reflected an individual who had reached the inner content state of the highest [[Sannyasa|ascetic]].&lt;ref name=khare17century&gt;Ravindra S Khare (1985), The Untouchable as Himself, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521263146}}, pages 41-45&lt;/ref&gt;

The 20th century version, prevalent in the texts of Dalit community, concurs with the parts about pure speech and resolving spiritual doubts.&lt;ref name=khare20century/&gt; However, they differ in the rest. The texts and the prevalent beliefs of the Dalit community hold that Ravidas rejected the Hindu Vedas, he was opposed by the Brahmins and resisted by the caste Hindus as well as Hindu ascetics throughout his life, and that some members of the Dalit community have believed Ravidas was an idol worshipper (saguni bhakti saint) while other 20th century texts assert that Ravidas rejected idolatry.&lt;ref name=khare20century&gt;Ravindra S Khare (1985), The Untouchable as Himself, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521263146}}, pages 46-53, 163-164&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ravidassia religion===
The difference between the [[Ravidassia religion]] and Sikhism, as described by a post made by Shri Guru Ravidass Temple in Ontario is as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;We, as Ravidassias have different traditions. We are not Sikhs. Even though, we give utmost respect to 10 gurus and Guru Granth Sahib, Guru Ravidass Ji is our supreme. There is no command for us to follow the declaration that there is no Guru after Guru Granth Sahib. We respect Guru Granth Sahib because it has our guru Ji‟s teachings and teachings of other religious figures who have spoken against caste system, spread the message of NAAM and equality. As per our traditions, we give utmost respect to contemporary gurus also who are carrying forward the message of Guru Ravidass Ji.&lt;ref&gt;Ram, R. (2009). Ravidass, Dera Sachkhand Ballan and the Question of Dalit Identity in Punjab. ''JPS'', ''16''(1), 2.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;[[Ravidassia religion]] is a spin off religion from Sikhism, formed in the 21st century, by the followers of Ravidass's teachings. It was formed following the murder of their cleric [[Ramanand Dass]] in Vienna in 2009, where the movement declared itself to be a religion fully separated from Sikhism.&lt;ref name="ravidassiareligion1" /&gt; The Ravidassia religion compiled a new holy book, [[Amritbani Guru Ravidass Ji]]. Based entirely on the writings and teaching of Ravidas, it contains 240 hymns.&lt;ref name="ravidassiareligion1"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.timesofindia.indiatimes.com/2010-02-01/india/28118439_1_dera-head-dera-sachkhand-ballan-sant-ramanand | work=The Times of India | title=Punjab sect declares new religion | date=1 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kathryn Lum summarizes the dynamics behind the separation of Ravidassia religion and Sikhism, and its focus on Ravidas, as follows:
{{Quote|
Ravidasia believe that the best way forward for Chamars is to claim and assert their own identity. For this more independent camp, Sikhism is viewed as obstructing the full development of the Chamar community as a quam (separate religion and nation), as envisioned by the Ad Dharm (original people) movement. According to these separatist Ravidasias, the only way for Chamars to progress is to pursue an independent religious path focused exclusively on the figure of Guru Ravidas.|Kathryn Lum|''Sikhs in Europe''&lt;ref&gt;Kathryn Lum (2011), Sikhs in Europe: Migration, Identities, and Representations (Editors: Knut A Jacobsen and Kristina Myrvold), Ashgate, {{ISBN|978-1409424345}}, page 186&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Places of worship===
[[File:Shri Guru Ravidass Temple in the UK.jpg|thumb|A Guru Ravidass temple in the UK.]]
Ravidas is revered as a saint and well respected by his believers. He is considered by his devotees as someone who was the living symbol of religious protest, and not as the spiritual symbol of any ultimate unifying cultural principle.&lt;ref&gt;Ravindra S Khare (1985), The Untouchable as Himself, Cambridge University Press, {{ISBN|978-0521263146}}, pages 48-49, 41-53&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Politics ===
A political party was founded in India in 2012 by the followers of Ravidass, with the word Begumpura (''Be-gam-pura'', or "land without sorrow"), a term coined in a poem by Ravidas. The term means the city where there is no suffering or fear, and all are equal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/Anti-dhakka-shahi/908242/ |title=Mishra, Vandita, "Anti-dhakka shahi"|publisher=Indianexpress.com |date=6 February 2012 |accessdate=24 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ravidas and Meera ===
There is a small ''[[chhatri]]'' (umbrella) in front of Meera’s temple in [[Chittorgarh district]] of [[Rajasthan]] which bears Ravidas' engraved foot print.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ghumakkar.com/2009/08/24/chittaurgarh-fort-an-enigma-with-a-thin-line-between-history-and-mythology-i/ ''Chittauragarh Fort: An Enigma with a Thin Line between History and Mythology'']. 24 August 2009, Ghumakkar.com{{unreliable source?|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legends link him as the ''guru'' of [[Meera]], another major [[bhakti movement]] poet, but there is no historical evidence that they ever met.&lt;ref name=peterheehs&gt;Peter Heehs (2002), Indian Religions: A Historical Reader of Spiritual Expression and Experience, New York University Press, {{ISBN|978-0814736500}}, pages 368-370&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Gnosticism]] and [[Demonology]] '''Sananel''' was a former chief of the [[Heavenly host|angelic host]] who later became the [[demiurge]] or creator of the material world, and known as [[Satan]]. In some accounts he was the elder brother of Jesuel (the heavenly [[Jesus]]).

'''''Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems''''' is a 1971 book by [[Jerome Ravetz]]. It contains a reasoned illustration of science as a social process with all the failing and imperfections of human endeavors.

==Content==
'It is impossible to understand the social and ethical problems confronting
science without recognizing the falsity of the assumption, crucial to traditional
theories of science, that the results of scientific research must be
essentially good and true. Dr Ravetz demonstrates the role of choice and
value-judgement, and the inevitability of error, in scientific research'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bjps.oxfordjournals.org/content/22/4/local/back-matter.pdf (from Oxford University Press back matter entry for this volume)]&lt;/ref&gt;

Salient aspects of the book are the social construction of facts, science as a craft with essential tacit elements, the role of choice and value judgment, and the inevitability of error. The book argues that internal quality control system of industrialized science will suffer severe problems: "The problem of quality control in science is thus at the centre of the social problems of the industrialized science of the present period." Moore (1973) summarizes the main claims of Ravetz's work are as follows: "First, historically the social character of science has undergone tremendous changes. Secondly, the traditional philosophies of science which conceive of science as an activity in the pursuit of truth are obsolete. And thirdly, it is imperative to develop a new philosophy of science which accounts for the social nature of contemporary science."&lt;ref name="Review1"&gt;Moore, J.H., 1973, Review of ‘Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems by Jerome R. Ravetz’, Philosophy of Science, Vol. 40, No. 3 (Sep., 1973), pp. 455-457.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ravetz analyzes the transition from basic science to 'industrialized science', with particular attention of issues of degeneration (shoddy science). He also focuses on entrepreneurial science, where a scientist becomes more concerned with research grants and power than
with the quality of his scientific research.&lt;ref name="Review1" /&gt;  The need for 'good morale', i.e. for an ethos of science upheld by a community of peers is mentioned in relation to the danger that such an ethos may not survive 'industrialized science'. For Gowing (1974) the main difficulty of this work are the confusion among the different kinds of science addressed by the inquiry: 'natural sciences, pure and applied', versus 'any sort of disciplined inquiry', up to include 'social sciences'.&lt;ref name="Review2"&gt;Gowing, M., 1974, Review of ‘Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems by Jerome R. Ravetz’, The British Journal for the History of Science, Vol. 7, No. 1 (Mar., 1974), pp. 72-75.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reviews==
For Higgins "Ravetz best sections deal with science as a craft ... but a craft nonetheless. This science-as-craft cannot be taught independent of its ideology. One learns a craft at a master's knee, as one learns style. What this really means is that students must learn to make judgments about their actions; also about their behaviors, their science, their data."&lt;ref name="Review3"&gt;See A.C. Higgins, Science Fraud Database, at {{cite web |url=http://www.albany.edu/~scifraud/data/sci_fraud_0402.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-11-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130511050312/http://www.albany.edu/~scifraud/data/sci_fraud_0402.html |archivedate=2013-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; For Rothman (1974) Ravetz elucidates "the processes by which genuine and meaningful scientific knowledge accumulates. These chapters – nine
in all – form the most interesting and useful part of the book. His description of the emergence and refinement of scientific facts is articulated by the argument that science is craftman's work."&lt;ref name="Review4"&gt;Rothman, R.A, 1974, Review of ‘Scientific Knowledge and Its Social Problems by Jerome R. Ravetz’, Philosophy of the Social Science, 4, 301-309.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Black Crowned Night Heron - Pileated Woodpecker.jpg|thumb|300px|The photo was intended to be of a [[black-crowned night heron]]; the photographer was initially unaware of the [[pileated woodpecker]] flashing through.]] 

'''Serendipity''' means an unplanned, fortunate  discovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Serendipity|url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/serendipity|website=OxfordDictionaries.com|publisher=Oxford dictionary|accessdate=23 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The notion of serendipity is a common occurrence throughout the history of scientific innovation. Examples are [[Alexander Fleming]]'s accidental discovery of [[penicillin]] in 1928, the invention of the [[microwave oven]] by Percy Spencer  in 1945, and the invention of the [[Post-it note]] by [[Spencer Silver]] in 1968.

In June 2004, a British translation company voted the word to be one of the ten English [[words hardest to translate]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Words hardest to translate – The list by Today Translations.

==Etymology==
The first noted use of "serendipity" in the [[English language]] was by [[Horace Walpole]] in 1754. In a letter he wrote to his friend [[Sir Horace Mann, 1st Baronet|Horace Mann]], Walpole explained an unexpected discovery he had made about a (lost) painting&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2017-09-04|title=Lost artworks|url=https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=Lost_artworks&amp;oldid=798895435|journal=Wikipedia|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Bianca Cappello]] by [[Giorgio Vasari]] by reference to a  Persian fairy tale, ''[[The Three Princes of Serendip]]''. The princes, he told his correspondent, were "always making discoveries, by accidents and sagacity, of things which they were not in quest of".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |editor-first=Theodore G. |editor-last=Remer |title=Serendipity and the Three Princes, from the Peregrinaggio of 1557 |page=6|others=Edited, with an Introduction and Notes, by Theodore G. Remer. Preface by W. S. Lewis |publisher=[[University of Oklahoma Press]] |year=1965 }} LCC 65-10112&lt;/ref&gt; The name comes from ''[[Names of Sri Lanka#Ceylon, Serendip and related names|Serendip]]'', an old name for [[Sri Lanka]] (Ceylon), hence ''Sarandib'' by Arab traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Barber|first=Robert K. Merton, Elinor|title=The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity : A Study in Sociological Semantics and the Sociology of Science|year=2006|publisher=Princeton University Press|location=Princeton, NJ|isbn=0691126305|pages=1–3|edition=Paperback}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is derived from the Sanskrit ''Siṃhaladvīpaḥ'' (Siṃhalaḥ, Sri Lanka + dvīpaḥ, island).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/serendipity|title=serendipity|author=|date=|publisher=|via=The Free Dictionary}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Business and strategy==
M. E. Graebner describes serendipitous value in the context of the acquisition of a business as "windfalls that were not anticipated by the buyer prior to the deal": i.e., unexpected advantages or benefits incurred due to positive synergy effects of the merger.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

[[Ikujiro Nonaka]]&lt;ref&gt;1991, p.&amp;nbsp;94 November–December issue of [[Harvard Business Review]]&lt;/ref&gt; points out that the serendipitous quality of innovation is highly recognized by managers and links the success of Japanese enterprises to their ability to create knowledge not by processing information but rather by "tapping the tacit and often highly subjective insights, intuitions, and hunches of individual employees and making those insights available for testing and use by the company as a whole".

Serendipity is postulated by Napier and Vuong (2013) as a 'strategic advantage' with which a firm can tap its potential creativity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=cdjYAQAAQBAJ Napier, Nancy K., and Vuong Quan Hoang. "Serendipity as a strategic advantage?." ''Strategic Management in the 21st Century; edited by Timothy J. Wilkinson.'', '''2013''', ''1'', 175–199.]&lt;/ref&gt;

Serendipity is a key concept in [[competitive intelligence]] because it is one of the tools for avoiding blind spots (see [[Blindspots analysis]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.egideria.com/serendip.html Serendipity in Competitive Intelligence by [[Yves-Michel Marti]], Egideria] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110827142133/http://www.egideria.com/serendip.html |date=August 27, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clarify|date=February 2013}}

==Uses==
Serendipity is used as a [[sociology|sociological]] method in [[Anselm L. Strauss]]' and [[Barney G. Glaser]]'s ''[[grounded theory]]'', building on ideas by sociologist [[Robert K. Merton]], who in ''[[Social Theory and Social Structure]]'' (1949) referred to the "serendipity pattern" as the fairly common experience of observing an unanticipated, anomalous and strategic datum which becomes the occasion for developing a new theory or for extending an existing theory. Merton also co-authored (with Elinor Barber) ''The Travels and Adventures of Serendipity'',&lt;ref&gt;Princeton: Princeton University Press, 2003&lt;/ref&gt; which traces the origins and uses of the word "serendipity" since it was coined. The book is "a study in sociological semantics and the sociology of science", as the subtitle of the book declares. It further develops the idea of serendipity as scientific "method" (as juxtaposed with purposeful discovery by experiment or retrospective prophecy).

=={{anchor|Zemblanity|Bahramdipity}}Related terms==
[[William Boyd (writer)|William Boyd]] coined the term '''zemblanity''' in the late twentieth century to mean somewhat the opposite of serendipity: "making unhappy, unlucky and unexpected discoveries occurring by design".&lt;ref&gt;Boyd, William. ''Armadillo'', Chapter 12, [[Alfred A. Knopf|Knopf]], New York, 1998. {{ISBN|0-375-40223-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A zemblanity is, effectively, an "unpleasant unsurprise". It derives from [[Novaya Zemlya]] (or Nova Zembla), a cold, barren land with many features opposite to the lush Sri Lanka (Serendip). On this island [[Willem Barents]] and his crew were stranded while searching for a new route to the east.

'''Bahramdipity''' is derived directly from [[Bahram V|Bahram Gur]] as characterized in ''[[The Three Princes of Serendip]]''.  It describes the ''suppression'' of serendipitous discoveries or research results by powerful individuals.&lt;ref&gt;(a) [http://www.the-scientist.com/yr1999/feb/opin_990201.html Sommer, Toby J. "'Bahramdipity' and Scientific Research", ''The Scientist'', '''1999''', ''13''(3), 13.] &lt;br /&gt;(b) [http://www.bmartin.cc/dissent/documents/Sommer.pdf Sommer, Toby J.

{{Zen Buddhism}} 
{{refimprove|date=December 2012}}
A '''''sesshin''''' (接心, or also 摂心/攝心 literally "touching the heart-mind")&lt;ref&gt;[http://jisho.org/words?jap=%E6%8E%A5%E5%BF%83 Translation for 接心 (sesshin)]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://jisho.org/kanji/details/%E6%8E%A5%E5%BF%83 Translation for 接 (setsu) and 心 (shin)]&lt;/ref&gt; is a period of intensive [[meditation]] ([[zazen]]) in a [[Zen]] [[Monastery#Buddhist monasteries|monastery]].

While the daily routine in the monastery requires the [[monk]]s to meditate several hours a day, during a sesshin they devote themselves almost exclusively to zazen practice.  The numerous 30- to 50-minute-long meditation periods are interleaved with short rest breaks, meals, and sometimes short periods of work (Japanese: 作務 ''samu'') all performed with the same [[Mindfulness (Buddhism)|mindfulness]]; nightly [[sleep]] is kept to a minimum, at six hours or fewer. During the sesshin period, the meditation practice is occasionally interrupted by the master giving public talks ([[Buddhist terms and concepts#T|t]]eisho) and individual direction in private meetings (which may be called ''[[dokusan]]'', ''daisan'', or ''sanzen'') with a [[Zen Master]].

In modern [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] practice in [[Buddhism in Japan|Japan]] and [[Buddhism in the West|the West]], sesshins are often attended by lay students, and are typically one, three, five, or seven days in length. Seven-day sesshins are held several times a year at many [[Zen center]]s, especially in commemoration of [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]]'s awakening to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|full enlightenment]] (''anuttarā-samyak-saṃbodhi'').  At this [[Rohatsu]] sesshin, practitioners seek to relax and quiet the mind to the point of cessation of mental chatter and emotional impulse, [[Samādhi (Buddhism)|samadhi]], [[kensho]], or [[satori]].

== A typical sesshin day ==
A sesshin schedule in the West will typically allow anywhere from nine to fifteen periods of [[zazen]] per day, 30–40 minutes each, with ten-minute periods of walking meditation ([[kinhin]]) between zazen periods.  Traditional sesshin are more intensive, with meditations lasting 30–60 minutes each, with an absence of any rest or work breaks and sleep limited to less than five hours a day.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

Meals are taken in a formal meditation ritual of [[oryoki]].  Work periods in westernized sesshin are sometimes scheduled and may comprise one to two hours of the day, usually in gardening, cooking, or cleaning.  The sesshin schedule typically allows for four to five hours of sleep per night, though practitioners occasionally will spend much of the next-to-last night of a five- or seven-day sesshin in zazen. This is called [[yaza]] and is much revered as a particularly effective time to meditate when the thinking mind and [[Ego (spirituality)|ego]] lack the energy to derail practice. 
It has been reported that at least three days of sesshin are usually required for the practitioner to "settle down" into the sesshin routine to a point where the mind becomes quiet enough for the deeper types of meditation and samadhi to begin.{{cn|date=October 2015}}

==Psychological aspects of sesshin==
Some people unfamiliar with the process have reported becoming disoriented and fearful of incurring psychological damage during sesshin. Some Zen centers do not allow novices to attend long sesshins without much prior experience and screening by the practice leaders.&lt;ref&gt;—Krishna (1971), p. 164
&lt;/ref&gt;  Sesshin can lead to deep experiences of awakening that may at times be somewhat traumatic, akin to a "[[spiritual emergency]]" or symptoms of [[Kundalini Syndrome]].

While this may seem daunting at first, people who practice regular [[zazen]] do not usually have problems with sesshin. Heightening of senses may arise during sesshin. Sometimes practitioners report that food has incredible flavor and colors become more vivid and pronounced.&lt;ref&gt;Definition of the term "pranotthana": "Intensified, uplifted life energy" (Sovatsky, 1998:153), "The perception of energy movement" (Bynum, 1996: 260).
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tenzo.org/sesshin&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social aspects of sesshin==
There is no talking during sesshin. Silence is observed so that each student may both concentrate on their experience and not influence those of others.

At the end of the sesshin there is usually a meal when students are allowed to talk to others for the first time since arriving.

Dupuche, 2003, page 155&lt;/ref&gt; refers in [[Hinduism]] to the '''transmission'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA; Transmission (esotericism)' redirects here--&gt; (or conferring) of [[spiritual energy]] upon one person by another. ''Shaktipat'' can be transmitted with a sacred word or [[mantra]], or by a look, thought or touch&amp;nbsp;– the last usually to the [[ajna|ajna chakra]] or [[third eye]] of the recipient.

''Saktipat'' is considered an act of grace (''anugraha'') on the part of the guru or the divine. It cannot be imposed by force, nor can a receiver make it happen.&lt;ref&gt;Abhinavagupta, The Kula Ritual, as Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka, John R. Dupuche, page 154&lt;/ref&gt; The very consciousness of the god or guru is held to enter into the [[Atman (Hinduism)|Self]] of the disciple, constituting an initiation into the school or the spiritual family ([[Kaula (Hinduism)|kula]]) of the guru.&lt;ref&gt;Abhinavagupta: The Kula Ritual, as Elaborated in Chapter 29 of the Tantrāloka, John R. Dupuche, Page 131&lt;/ref&gt; It is held that ''Shaktipat'' can be transmitted in person or at a distance, through an object such as a flower or fruit.&lt;ref&gt;Satyananda Saraswati, ''Kundalini Tantra'', Yoga Publications Trust (1984), p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Levels of intensity==

===Levels===
In [[Kashmir Shaivism]], depending on its intensity, ''Śaktipāt'' can be classified as:
&lt;!--Specific Principles of Kashmir Śaivism, B. N. Pandit, page 175; also, please verify the order of names--&gt;
* ''tīvra-tīvra-śaktipāta'' - the so-called "Super Supreme Grace" - produces immediate identity with ''Śiva'' and liberation; such a being goes on to become a [[siddha]] master and bestows grace from his abode (''Siddhaloka''), directly into the heart of deserving aspirants&lt;ref name="Kashmir Shaivism Page 66"&gt;Kashmir Shaivism, The Secret Supreme, [[Lakshman Joo]], Page 66&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''tīvra-madhya-śaktipāta'' - "Supreme Medium Grace" - such a being becomes spiritually illuminated and liberated on his own, relying directly on ''Śiva'', not needing initiation or instruction from other exterior [[guru]]. This is facilitated by an intense awakening of his spiritual intuition (''pratibhā'') which immediately eliminates  ignorance&lt;ref name="Kashmir Shaivism Page 66"/&gt;
* ''tīvra-manda-śaktipāta'' - "Supreme Inferior Grace" - the person who received this grace strongly desires to find an appropriate [[guru]], but he does not need instruction, but a simple touch, a look or simply being in the presence of his master is enough to trigger in him to the state of illumination&lt;ref name="Kashmir Shaivism Page 66"/&gt;
* ''madhya-tīvra-śaktipāta'' - "Medium Supreme Grace" - a disciple who receives this grace desires to have the instruction and initiation of a perfect [[guru]]; in time he becomes enlightened. However, he is not totally absorbed into this state during his lifetime and receives a permanent state of fusion with ''Śiva'' after the end of his life&lt;ref&gt;Kashmir Shaivism, The Secret Supreme, [[Lakshman Joo]], Page 67&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''madhya-madhya-śaktipāta'' - "Medium Middle Grace" - such a disciple will receive initiation from his [[guru]] and have an intense desire to attain liberation, but at the same time he still has desire for various enjoyments and pleasure; after the end of his life, he continues to a paradise where he fulfills all his desires and after that he receives again initiation from his master and realizes permanent union with ''Śiva''&lt;ref name="Kashmir Shaivism Page 68"&gt;Kashmir Shaivism, The Secret Supreme, [[Lakshman Joo]], Page 68&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''madhya-manda-śaktipāta'' - "Medium Inferior Grace" - is similar to "Medium Middle Grace" except that in this case the aspirant desires worldly pleasures more than union with ''Śiva''; he needs to be reincarnated again as a spiritual seeker to attain liberation&lt;ref name="Kashmir Shaivism Page 68"/&gt;
* ''manda'' - "Inferior Grace" - for those who receive this level of grace, the aspiration to be united with ''Śiva'' is present only in times of distress and suffering; the grace of ''Śiva'' needs to work in them for many lifetimes before spiritual liberation occurs&lt;ref&gt;Kashmir Shaivism, The Secret Supreme, Lakshman Jee, Page 69&lt;/ref&gt;

==Descriptions==
Swami [[Muktananda]], in his book ''Play of Consciousness'', describes in great detail his experience of receiving shaktipat initiation from his guru Bhagavan Nityananda and his spiritual development that unfolded after this event.&lt;ref name=POC&gt;{{cite book|last=Muktananda|first=Swami|title=Play of Consciousness|year=1978|publisher=Siddha Yoga Publications|isbn=0-911307-81-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paul Zweig has written of his experience of receiving ''shaktipat'' from [[Muktananda]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Zweig, in John White (editor),  ''Kundalini, Evolution, and Enlightenment'' ({{ISBN|1-55778-303-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; In the same book [[Itzhak Bentov]] describes his laboratory measurements of kundalini-awakening through ''shaktipat'',&lt;ref&gt;Itzhak Bentov, ''Micromotions of the body as a factor in the development of the nervous system'', in John White (editor), ''Kundalini, Evolution, and Enlightenment'' ({{ISBN|1-55778-303-9}})&lt;/ref&gt; a study held in high regard by the late [[Satyananda Saraswati]], founder of the [[Bihar School of Yoga]], and by [[Hiroshi Motoyama]], author of ''Theories of the Chakras''.

[[Barbara Brennan]] describes shaktipat as the projection of the guru's "[[Aura (paranormal)|aura]]" on the disciple who thereby acquires the  same mental state, hence the importance of the high spiritual level of the guru. The physiological phenomena of rising [[Kundalini energy|kundalini]] then naturally manifest.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Brennan, ''Hands of Light''&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book, Building a Noble World, [[Shiv R. Jhawar]] describes his shaktipat experience at Muktananda’s public program at Lake Point Tower in Chicago on September 16, 1974 as follows:

“Baba [Swami Muktananda] had just begun delivering his discourse with his opening statement: ‘Today’s subject is meditation. The crux of the question is: What do we meditate upon?’ Continuing his talk, Baba said: ‘Kundalini starts dancing when one repeats Om Namah Shivaya.’Hearing this, I mentally repeated the mantra, I noticed that my breathing was getting heavier. Suddenly, I felt a great impact of a rising force within me. The intensity of this rising kundalini force was so tremendous that my body lifted up a little and fell flat into the aisle; my eyeglasses flew off. As I lay there with my eyes closed, I could see a continuous fountain of dazzling white lights erupting within me. In brilliance, these lights were brighter than the sun but possessed no heat at all. I was experiencing the thought-free state of "I am," realizing that "I" have always been, and will continue to be, eternal. I was fully conscious and completely aware while I was experiencing the pure "I am," a state of supreme bliss. Outwardly, at that precise moment, Baba delightfully shouted from his platform…’mene kuch nahi kiya; kisiko shakti ne pakda (I didn’t do anything. The Energy has caught someone.)’ Baba noticed that the dramatic awakening of kundalini in me frightened some people in the audience. Therefore, he said, ‘Do not be frightened. Sometimes kundalini gets awakened in this way, depending upon a person’s type.&lt;ref&gt;Jhawar, Shiv R. (2004) Building a Noble World, Page 84 ({{ISBN|0-9749197-0-5}})&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Spiritual Exercises of Ignatius of Loyola''''' ([[Latin]] original: ''Exercitia spiritualia''), composed 1522–1524, are a set of [[Christian meditation]]s, [[Christian contemplation#Acquired contemplation|contemplations]], and [[prayer]]s written by [[Saint Ignatius of Loyola]], a 16th-century [[Spain|Spanish]] [[Priesthood in the Catholic Church|priest]], [[theologian]], and founder of the [[Society of Jesus]] (Jesuits). Divided into four thematic "weeks" of variable length, they are designed to be carried out over a period of 28 to 30 days.&lt;ref&gt;Counsell, Michael.

==Editions==
A review of the publication history of the ''Spiritual Exercises'' may be found on the website of [[Loyola Press]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=St. Ignatius Loyola |title=The Spiritual Exercises |url=http://spex.ignatianspirituality.com |work=Ignatian Spirituality |accessdate=5 February 2017}} References are to paragraphs numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; The first printed edition of the ''Spiritual Exercises'' was published in [[Latin]] in 1548, after being given papal approval by [[Pope Paul III]].&lt;ref&gt;In the brief ''Pastoralis officii'' of 31 July 1548.&lt;/ref&gt; However, Ignatius's manuscripts were in Spanish, so this first edition was in fact a translation, although it was made during Ignatius's lifetime and with his approval. Many subsequent editions in Latin and in various other languages were printed early on with widely differing texts. 

Archival work on the authentic text of the ''Spiritual Exercises'' was undertaken at the initiative of the 19th century Jesuit Superior General [[Jan Roothaan]], who himself published a translation and notes from the original manuscripts of St. Ignatius. The culmination of this work was a "critical edition" of the ''Exercises'' published by the Jesuit order in 1919, in the ''Monumenta Historica Societatis Jesu'' series.&lt;ref&gt;''Monumenta Historica Societatis Jesu'', Monumenta Ignatiana, Series Secunda: Exercitia Spiritualia. Madrid, 1919.&lt;/ref&gt; A critical edition from 1847 that incorporates Roothaan's studies can be found online.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://archive.org/stream/a588350800loyouoft#page/n5/mode/2up|title=The spiritual exercises of St. Ignatius of Loyola|website=archive.org|access-date=2017-03-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; An authoritative Spanish-Latin text, based on the critical edition, was published in Turin by Marietti, in 1928. This was edited by the editor of the critical edition, and included convenient marginal numbers for every section, which can be found in all contemporary editions (and inline in this article).

An [[English language|English]] translation by Louis J. Puhl, S.J., published in 1951, has been widely used by Jesuits, spiritual directors, retreat leaders, and others in the English-speaking world. Puhl translated directly from studies based on the original manuscripts.&lt;ref name="spirex"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://spex.ignatianspirituality.com/SpiritualExercises/Puhl|title=Louis J. Puhl, S.J.

==Background==
[[File:LaMorenetaVirginOfMontserrat.jpg|140px|thumb|left|[[Virgin of Montserrat]]]]
After recovering from a leg wound incurred during the Siege of [[Pamplona]] in 1521, Ignatius made a retreat with the [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monks at their abbey high on [[Santa Maria de Montserrat Abbey|Montserrat]] in [[Catalonia]], northern [[Spain]], where he hung up his sword before the statue of the [[Virgin of Montserrat]]. The monks introduced him to the spiritual exercises of Garcia de Cisneros, which were based in large part on the teachings of the [[Brothers of the Common Life]], the promoters of the "[[devotio moderna]]". From Montserrat, he left for [[Barcelona]] but took a detour through the town of [[Manresa]], where he eventually remained for several months, continuing his convalescence at a local hospital. During this time he discovered ''[[The Imitation of Christ]]'' of [[Thomas à Kempis]], the crown jewel of the "devotio moderna",&lt;ref name=Pinard&gt;[http://www.ewtn.com/library/SPIRIT/IGNASPIR.TXT De La Boullaye, Pinard. ''Ignatian Spirituality''].&lt;/ref&gt; which, unlike the focus on labor in the Lord's vineyard which Ignatius will give to his ''Constitutions'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://tertianship.eu/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/Const_1-5_presentation_Jan.pdf|title=Vineyard in Ignatius' ''Constitutions''|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=8 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; gave little grounding for an [[Apostles|apostolic]] spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;Balthasar, Hans Urs von. ''The Glory of the Lord V''. Cambridge U. Press, 2001, p. 103. {{ISBN|978-0898702477}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  He also spent much of his time praying in a [[Cave of Saint Ignatius|cave nearby]], where he practiced rigorous asceticism. During this time Ignatius experienced a series of visions, and formulated the fundamentals of his ''Spiritual Exercises''. He would later refine and complete the ''Exercises'' when he was a student in Paris.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.catholic.org/saints/saint.php?saint_id=56|title=St. Ignatius Loyola - Saints &amp; Angels - Catholic Online|last=Online|first=Catholic|website=Catholic Online|accessdate=3 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Spiritual Exercises'' of Saint Ignatius form the cornerstone of [[Jesuit spirituality|Ignatian Spirituality]]: a way of understanding and living one's relationship with God in the world as practiced by members of the Society of Jesus (Jesuits). Although he originally designed them to take place in the setting of a secluded [[Retreat (spiritual)|retreat]], during which those undergoing the exercises would be focused on nothing other than the ''Exercises'', Ignatius also provided a model in his introductory notes for completing the ''Exercises'' over a longer period without the need of seclusion.&lt;ref name="spirex"/&gt;{{rp|19}}  The ''Exercises'' were designed to be carried out while under the guidance of a [[spiritual director]], but they were never meant only for monks or priests: Ignatius gave the ''Exercises'' for 15 years before he was ordained, and years before the Society of Jesus was founded. He saw them as an instrument for bringing about a conversion or change of heart, in the Reformation times in which he lived. After the Society of Jesus was formed, the ''Exercises'' became the central component of its training program. They usually take place during the first year of a two-year [[novitiate]] and during a final year of spiritual studies after ordination to the priesthood. The ''Exercises'' have also impacted the founders of other religious orders, even becoming central to their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.omvusa.org/mission/founder/|title=History {{!}} Oblates of the Virgin Mary|website=www.omvusa.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ignatius considered [[the examen]], or spiritual self-review, to be the most important way to continue to live out the experience of the ''Exercises'' after their completion.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-prayer/the-examen|title=The Daily Examen - IgnatianSpirituality.com|work=Ignatian Spirituality|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Spiritual viewpoint ==
Ignatius identified the various motives that lead a person to choose one course of action over another as "spirits".&lt;ref name=Tetlow&gt;[http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/making-good-decisions/discernment-of-spirits/discernment-in-a-nutshell/ Tetlow, Joseph A., "Discernment in a Nutshell", ''Making Choices in Christ'', Loyola Press]&lt;/ref&gt; A major aim of the ''Exercises'' is the development of [[Discernment of Spirits#Ignatian view (Roman Catholic)|discernment]] (''discretio''), the ability to discern between [[good and evil|good]] and [[evil]] spirits. A good "spirit" can bring love, joy, peace, but also desolation, to bring one to re-examine one's life. An evil spirit usually brings confusion and doubt, but may also prompt contentment to discourage change. The human [[soul]] is continually drawn in two directions: towards goodness but at the same time towards sinfulness.&lt;ref name="spirex"/&gt;{{rp|313ff}}

According to the theologian [[Hans Urs von Balthasar]], "choice" is the center of the ''Exercises'', and they are directed to choosing God's choice, i.e., ultimately to a self-abandonment to God. The ''Exercises'' "have as their purpose the conquest of self and the regulation of one’s life in such a way that no decision is made under the influence of any inordinate attachment."&lt;ref name=Schindler/&gt;

"Discernment" is very important to Ignatian thought. Through the process of discernment, the believer is led toward a direct connection between one's thought and action and the grace of God. As such, discernment can be considered a movement toward [[mysticism|mystical]] union with God, and it emphasizes the mystical experience of the believer. This aspect of the ''Spiritual Exercises'' reflects the trend toward [[Christian mysticism#Spanish mysticism|mysticism]] in [[Catholic]] thought which flourished during the time of the [[counter-reformation]] (e.g., with [[Teresa of Ávila]], [[Francis de Sales]], and [[Pierre de Bérulle]]). However, while discernment can be understood as a mystical path, it can also more prosaically be understood as a method of subjective [[ethical]] thought. The ''Exercises'' emphasize the role of one's own mental faculties in deciding what is right and wrong.&lt;ref name="spirex"/&gt;{{rp|313}}

{{Jesuit}}

== Typical methodology and structure ==
The original, complete form of the ''Exercises'' is a retreat of about 30 days in silence and solitude.&lt;ref name="Spiritual"&gt;[http://www.ignatianspirituality.com/ignatian-prayer/the-spiritual-exercises/ "The Spiritual Exercises" Ignatian Spirituality, Loyola Press]&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Exercises'' are divided into four "weeks" of varying length with four major themes: sin and God's mercy, episodes in the life of Jesus, the passion of Jesus, and the resurrection of Jesus together with a contemplation on God's love. This last is often seen as the goal of Ignatian spirituality, to find God in all things.&lt;ref name="spirex"/&gt;{{rp|235}} The "weeks" represent stages in a process of wholehearted commitment to the service of God. 

Ignatius' book is not meant to be used by the retreatant but by a director or spiritual guide. Each day the exercitant uses the material proposed by the director for four or five hour-long periods, each followed by a review of how the period went. The exercitant reports back to the spiritual director who helps interpret the exercitant's experiences and proposes material for the next day. Ignatius observes that God "deals directly" with the well-disposed person and the director should not give advice to the retreatant that might interfere with God's workings.&lt;ref name="spirex" /&gt;{{rp|15}} 

After the first week Ignatius recommends a form of [[Christian contemplation#Acquired contemplation|contemplation]] which he calls "application of the senses."&lt;ref name=spirex/&gt;{{rp|121-126}} For this you “place yourself in a scene from the Gospels. Ask yourself, "What do I see? What do I hear? What do I feel, taste and smell?”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.americamagazine.org/content/all-things/easing-contemplation|title=Father James Martin: An introduction to Ignatian contemplation|date=21 September 2016|work=America Magazine|accessdate=6 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of these ''Exercises'' is that we might gain the empathy to "follow and imitate more closely our Lord."&lt;ref name=spirex/&gt;{{rp|109}} From this comes the widespread use of the ''[[Magis]]'' concept in Ignatian circles.

== Modern applications ==
The ''Spiritual Exercises'' of Ignatius of Loyola are considered a classic work of spiritual literature.&lt;ref name=Schindler&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=QTK8zhja1v4C&amp;pg=PT64&amp;lpg=PT64&amp;dq=%22Ejercitatoria%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=81x4yv8jgT&amp;sig=pOu0cQLBvqxpZeIKbi3gNTZneV4&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CQTdVP2rPOyxsASkgoGoCA&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Ejercitatoria%22&amp;f=false Löser, Werner. ''Hans Urs Von Balthasar''. (David Schindler, ed.) Ignatius Press, 1991] {{ISBN|9780898703788}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many Jesuits are ready to direct the general public in retreats based on the ''Exercises''.

Since the 1980s there has been a growing interest in the ''Spiritual Exercises'' among people from other Christian traditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The ''Exercises'' are also popular among lay people&lt;ref name=Spiritual/&gt; both in the [[Catholic Church]] and in other denominations, and [[laity|lay]] organizations like the [[Christian life community]] place the ''Exercises'' at the center of their [[spirituality]]. The ''Exercises'' are seen variously as an occasion for a change of life&lt;ref name="spirex" /&gt;{{rp|18}} and as a school of contemplative prayer.

The most common way for laypersons to go through the ''Exercises'' now is a "retreat in daily life", which involves a 5-7 month program of daily prayer and meetings with a spiritual director.&lt;ref name="Spiritual" /&gt; Also called the "19th annotation exercises" based on a remark of St. Ignatius in the 19th "introductory observation" in his book, the retreat in daily life does not require an extended stay in a retreat house and the learned methods of discernment can be tried out on day-to-day experiences over time.&lt;ref name="spirex" /&gt;{{rp|19}}

Also, some break the 30 days into two or three sections over a two-year period. And most retreat centers offer shorter retreats with some of the elements of the ''Spiritual Exercises''. Retreats have been developed for specific groups of people, such as those who are married or engaged. Self-guided forms of the ''Exercises'' are also available, including online programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://onlineministries.creighton.edu/CollaborativeMinistry/cmo-retreat.html|title=Online Retreat in Everyday Life|last=|first=|website=onlineministries.creighton.edu|accessdate=7 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ignatianspiritualexercises.com|title=The Jesus Way: Practicing the Ignatian Spiritual Exercises|last=|first=|date=|website=The Ignatian Spiritual Exercises|access-date=20 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Technocriticism''' is a branch of [[critical theory]] devoted to the study of [[technological change]].

Technocriticism treats technological transformation as historically specific changes in personal and social practices of [[research]], [[invention]], [[regulation of science|regulation]], [[Distribution (business)|distribution]], [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]], [[appropriation (sociology)|appropriation]], use, and [[discourse]], rather than as an autonomous or socially indifferent accumulation of useful inventions, or as an uncritical [[metanarrative|narrative]] of linear "[[Progress (history)|progress]]", "[[Research and development|development]]" or "[[innovation]]".

Technocriticism studies these personal and social practices in their changing practical and cultural significance.  It documents and analyzes both their private and public uses, and often devotes special attention to the relations among these different uses and dimensions. Recurring themes in technocritical discourse include the [[deconstruction]] of [[essentialist]] concepts such as "[[health]]", "[[human]]", "[[nature]]" or "[[Norm (sociology)|norm]]".

Technocritical theory can be either "descriptive" or "prescriptive" in tone.  Descriptive forms of technocriticism include some scholarship in the [[history of technology]], [[science and technology studies]], [[cyberculture]] studies and [[philosophy of technology]].  More prescriptive forms of technocriticism can be found in the various branches of [[technoethics]], for example, [[media criticism]], [[infoethics]], [[bioethics]], [[neuroethics]], [[roboethics]], [[nanoethics]], [[existential risk]] [[risk assessment|assessment]] and some versions of [[environmental ethics]] and [[environmental design]] theory.

Figures engaged in technocritical scholarship and theory include [[Donna Haraway]] and [[Bruno Latour]] (who work in the closely related field of [[science studies]]), [[N. Katherine Hayles]] (who works in the field of [[Literature and Science]]), Phil Agree and [[Mark Poster]] (who works in [[intellectual history]]), [[Marshall McLuhan]] and [[Friedrich Kittler]] (who work in the closely related field of [[media studies]]), Susan Squier and Richard Doyle (who work in the closely related field of [[medical sociology]]), and [[Hannah Arendt]], [[Walter Benjamin]], [[Martin Heidegger]], and [[Michel Foucault]] (who sometimes wrote about the [[philosophy of technology]]). Technocriticism can be juxtaposed with a number of other innovative interdisciplinary areas of scholarship which have surfaced in recent years such as [[technoscience]] and [[technoethics]].

}}'''Zhenxie Qingliao''' ({{zh|s=真歇清了|p=Zhēnxiē Qīngliăo}}; {{CJKV|k=Chinhǒl Ch'ǒngyo|j=Shinketsu Seiryō|v=Chân Yết Thanh Liễu}}), also known as '''Changlu Qingliao''' ({{zh|s=長蘆清了|w=|p=Chánglú Qīngliăo}}; {{CJKV|k=|j=Chōro Seiryō|v=}}), was a Chinese [[Zen]] [[Buddhist]] monk during the [[Song Dynasty]]. He was born in Anchang, an ancient city in what is now [[Sichuan Province]]. According to traditional biographies, he became a monk at the age of eleven.&lt;ref name=Fer&gt;{{citation|last=Ferguson|first=Andrew E.|title=Zen's Chinese heritage: the masters and their teachings|year=2000|publisher=Wisdom Publications|isbn=978-0-86171-163-5|pages=417–419}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scholar Morten Schlütter calls Qingliao, along with his fellow student [[Hongzhi Zhengjue]], "the most illustrious representative of the [[The Five Houses of Chán|Caodong]] tradition in the Song [Dynasty]." Multiple sources contain a story about Qingliao regarding an event that took place after he received [[dharma transmission]] from his teacher [[Danxia Zichun]]. After leaving his teacher, he became the head monk at a monastery on Mt. Changlu, whose abbot was [[Zuzhao Daohe]] of the [[The Five Houses of Chán|Yunmen school]]. Daohe offered to allow Qingliao to become the abbot of the monastery, inherit his robe, and serve as his heir. Qingliao said he would become abbot, but could not be Daohe's heir since Zichun had already given him dharma transmission. Daohe later left the monastery without passing on his position, but ultimately Qingliao was instructed by a fiscal commissioner named Chen to take charge of the monastery. The students there apparently were amazed at his degree of loyalty to his original teacher. This story has historical significance because it suggests that Qingliao could have accepted Daohe’s offer to essentially switch heirs, indicating that teacher-student transmission was probably more flexible than often thought. Zhenxie Qingliao is also remembered as the initial target of the [[koan]] advocate [[Dahui Zonggao]]'s attacks on [[shikantaza|silent illumination]]-style meditation.&lt;ref name=sch&gt;{{citation|last=Schlütter|first=Morten|title=How Zen Became Zen: The Dispute Over Enlightenment and the Formation of Chan Buddhism in Song-Dynasty China|year=2010|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-0-8248-3508-8|pages=65,68,123}}&lt;/ref&gt;
