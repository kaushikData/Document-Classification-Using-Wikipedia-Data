      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8699">'''Academic Health Science Networks''' (AHSNs) are membership organisations within the [[National Health Service|NHS in England]]. They were created in May 2013 with the aim of bringing together health services, and academic and industry members. Their stated purpose is to improve patient outcomes and generate economic benefits for the UK by promoting and encouraging the adoption of innovation in healthcare.  It is too early to judge the extent to which they are effective in performing their role.

== Background and history ==

A report in 2008 by Lord [[Ara Darzi]]&lt;ref name ="NextStage"&gt;[http://www.official-documents.gov.uk/document/cm74/7432/7432.pdf High Quality Care for All: NHS Next Stage Review, Department of Health, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt; noted that the NHS was poor at innovating, and suggested wider collaboration between industry, education and all aspects of healthcare.  The NHS is one of the world's largest employers&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite news | url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-17429786 | title= Which is the world's largest employer? | date = 20 March 2012 | publisher=BBC | accessdate = 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with the UK's spending on healthcare at over £140b in 2010 or 9.6% of national GDP,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ons.gov.uk/ons/rel/psa/expenditure-on-healthcare-in-the-uk/2011/art-expenditure-on-healthcare-in-the-uk-2011.html#tab-Key-points | title = Expenditure on Healthcare in the UK: 2011 | publisher = Office for National Statistics | accessdate = 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a key component of the national economy.  There is a generally recognised need to improve the NHS's ability to identify and adopt innovation.&lt;ref&gt;Academic Health Sciences Networks in England, David Fish, The Lancet, Volume 381, Issue 9882, Pages e18 - e19, 8 June 2013, doi:10.1016/S0140-6736(12)60866-6&lt;/ref&gt;

AHSNs were first proposed by name in the report Innovation Health and Wealth &lt;ref name="Innovation"&gt;[http://webarchive.nationalarchives.gov.uk/20130107105354/http://www.dh.gov.uk/prod_consum_dh/groups/dh_digitalassets/documents/digitalasset/dh_134597.pdf Innovation Health and Wealth: Accelerating Adoption and Diffusion in the NHS, Department of Health, 5 December 2011]&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Sir David Nicholson]], Chief Executive of [[NHS England]], and launched by the [[Prime Minister of the United Kingdom|Prime Minister]], [[David Cameron]]. A request for expressions of interest was issued in June 2012&lt;ref name ="Expressions"&gt;[https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/126785/Academic-Health-Science-Networks-21062012-gw-17626-PDF-229K.pdf.pdf Academic Health Science Networks: expressions of interest, Department of Health, 20 June 2012]&lt;/ref&gt; and, on 23 May 2013, the 15 designated AHSNs were formally announced.&lt;ref name="HSJdesig"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/news/technology/nhs-england-gives-green-light-on-70m-innovation-networks-project/5059011.article| title= NHS England Gives Green Light on £70m Innovation Networks Project | publisher = Health Service Journal | accessdate = 21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Designation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.england.nhs.uk/2013/05/23/acc-health-sci-ntwrk/ | title = AHSN Designation Announcement| publisher = NHS England | accessdate = 11 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  They are regional, with non-overlapping territories covering the whole of England.  &lt;!--The 15 AHSNs are:

--&gt;

AHSNs take their place in the "fragmented cluttered and confusing"&lt;ref name="Innovation" /&gt; landscape of NHS innovation. As part of the "Sunset Review&lt;ref name="Innovation" /&gt;" a number of initiatives closed in 2013 including the NHS National Innovation Centre, NHS Institute for Innovation and Improvement, and Health Innovation and Education Clusters (HIECs).  There is still a range of currently active initiatives including NHS Innovation Hubs, NHS Supply Chain Innovation and NHS Improvement.

== Funding ==

Core funding will come from NHS England and work was "in hand to identify the funding" when expressions of interest were invited.&lt;ref name="Expressions" /&gt; A briefing paper&lt;ref name="Briefing"&gt;[http://www.nhsconfed.org/Publications/Documents/hsrn_briefing_246.pdf Academic Health Science Networks: Engaging with Improvement, NHS Confederation, June 2012]{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; assumed funding to be in the region of £2 per head of population served.  With a population averaging 3m people, a typical AHSN might have expected roughly £6m per AHSN per year.  These figures reflect early expectations but were neither clarified nor confirmed with the designation announcement.

When contracts were signed with NHS England in November 2013, the 15 AHSNs shared around £60 million of funding.

== Operation and activity ==

Although their purpose is clear, the structure and approach of individual AHSNs is a matter for local decision.  This is apparent in the contrasting approaches taken and the variety of opinions expressed by network founders.&lt;ref name="conversations"&gt;{{cite news   |url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2013/apr/26/academic-health-science-networks-role |title= Academic Health Science Networks: their role and development |publisher =The Guardian, 26 April 2013| accessdate= 21 June 2013 |location=London |first=Sarah |last=Johnson |date=26 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As membership organisations, AHSNs do not have any direct authority over their members, but Innovation Health and Wealth&lt;ref name="Innovation" /&gt; states: "all NHS organisations will aspire to be affiliated to their local AHSN where the AHSN will operate as a gateway for the NHS on innovation and working with the life sciences industry on the evaluation, commercialisation and rapid adoption of health technologies". They will be seen to be successful if and only if they can demonstrably improve the rate of adoption of medical technologies and [[Information and communication technologies|ICT]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/healthcare-network/2013/jul/01/2013-watershed-year-telehealth | title= Why 2013 Could Turn Out to be a Watershed Year for Telehealth | publisher=The Guardian, 1 July 2013 | accessdate= 2 July 2013 | location=London | first=Claire | last=Medd | date=1 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2014 it emerged that NHS England’s 2014-15 business plan, showed that AHSNs would receive £53.6m this financial year, a 5 per cent cut on last year’s budget. However, it represents a larger 23 per cent cut on the £70m NHS England announced in May 2013. A senior AHSN figure told the [[Health Service Journal]] that NHS England risked “castrating” the programme by cutting the budget and by a perceived lack of promotion in the networks. “They are trying to save a comparatively small amount of money [by cutting the budget] but in doing so they risk castrating the AHSNs.Commissioners are not going to sign up to us if they are thinking that we are not going to be around in two years’ time.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Innovation network could slip into ‘self-defeating spiral’|url=http://www.hsj.co.uk/topics/innovation/innovation-network-could-slip-into-self-defeating-spiral/5069|accessdate=4 May 2014|newspaper=Health Service Journal|date=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12103">'''Adulteration''' is a legal term meaning that a food product fails to meet the legal standards. One form of adulteration is an addition of another substance to a food item in order to increase the quantity of the food item in raw form or prepared form, which may result in the loss of actual quality of food item. These substances may be either available food items or non-food items. Among meat and meat products some of the items used to adulterate are water or ice, carcasses, or carcasses of animals other than the animal meant to be consumed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Requirements For Temporary Food Service Establishments|url=http://www.farmersbranch.info/DocumentCenter/View/2586|publisher=Farmers Branch|accessdate=27 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{Main article|List of food contamination incidents}}
Historians have recognized cases of food adulteration in Ancient Rome and the Middle Ages. Contemporary accounts of adulteration date from the 1850s to the present day.

===Legislative===
In the [[United States]], the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA), [[Regulation (law)|regulates]] and enforces laws on [[food safety]] as well as [[Food Defense]]. The FDA provides some technical definitions of adulterated food in various United States laws.

*1906 (21 U.S.C. 601 et.  seq.)
*1938 [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] (21 U.S.C. 321 et seq.)
*1957 [[Poultry Products Inspection Act]] (21 U.S.C. 451 et seq.)
*2011 [[Food Safety and Modernization Act]]

==Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act==
The Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic (FD&amp;C) Act 1988)&lt;ref&gt;https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/21/342&lt;/ref&gt; provides that food is "adulterated" if it meets any one of the following criteria:

*(1) it bears or contains any "[[poisonous]] or [[deleterious]] substance" which may render it injurious to health; 
*(2) it bears or contains any added poisonous or added deleterious substance (other than a [[pesticide]] [[residue (chemistry)|residue]], [[food additive]], [[color additive]], or new animal [[drug]], which are covered by separate provisions) that is unsafe; 
*(3) its container is composed, in whole or in part, of any poisonous or deleterious substance which may render the contents injurious to health; 
*or (4) it bears or contains a pesticide chemical residue that is unsafe. (Note: The [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) establishes tolerances for [[pesticide residue]]s in foods, which are enforced by the FDA.)

Food also meets the definition of adulteration if: 
*(5) it is, or it bears or contains, an unsafe food additive; 
*(6) it is, or it bears or contains, an unsafe new animal drug; 
*(7) it is, or it bears or contains, an unsafe colour additive; 
*(8) it consists, in whole or in part, of "any filthy, [[putrid]], or [[Decomposition|decomposed]] substance" or is otherwise unfit for food; 
*or (9) it has been prepared, packed, or held under [[unsanitary]] conditions ([[insect]], [[rodent]], or [[bird]] infestation) whereby it may have become [[Contaminated food|contaminated]] with filth or rendered injurious to health.

Further, food is considered adulterated if: 
*(10) it has been [[irradiated]] and the irradiation processing was not done in conformity with a regulation permitting irradiation of the food in question (the FDA has approved irradiation of a number of foods, including [[refrigerated]] or [[Freezing|frozen]] [[raw meat|uncooked meat]], fresh or frozen uncooked [[poultry]], and [[seeds]] for sprouting [21 C.F.R. Part 179].); 
*(11) it contains a [[Ingredient|dietary ingredient]] that presents a significant or unreasonable risk of illness or injury under the conditions of use recommended in labeling (for example, foods or dietary supplements containing [[aristolochic acids]], which have been linked to [[kidney failure]], have been banned.); 
*(12) a valuable constituent has been omitted in whole or in part or replaced with another substance; damage or inferiority has been concealed in any manner; or a substance has been added to increase the product's bulk or weight, reduce its quality or strength, or make it appear of greater value than it is (this is "economic adulteration"); 
*or (13) it is offered for [[import]] into the United States and is a food that has previously been refused admission, unless the person reoffering the food establishes that it is in compliance with U.S. law [21 U.S.C. § 342].

==Federal Meat Inspection Act and the Poultry Products Inspection Act==
The [[Federal Meat Inspection Act]] and the [[Poultry Products Inspection Act of 1957]] contain similar provisions&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/USCODE-2011-title21/html/USCODE-2011-title21-chap12-subchapI-sec601.htm&lt;/ref&gt; for meat and poultry products. [21 U.S.C. § 453(g), 601(m).

===Poisonous or deleterious substances===

Generally, if a food contains a poisonous or deleterious substance that may render it injurious to health, it is considered to be adulterated. For example, [[apple cider]] contaminated with [[E. coli]] [[O157:H7]] and [[Brie cheese]] contaminated with [[Listeria monocytogenes]] are adulterated. There are two exceptions to this general rule. First, if the poisonous substance is inherent or naturally occurring and its quantity in the food does not ordinarily render it injurious to health, the food will not be considered adulterated. Thus, a food that contains a [[natural toxin]] at very low levels that would not ordinarily be harmful (for instance, small amounts of [[amygdalin]] in [[apricot]] [[Seed|kernels]]) is not adulterated.

Second, if the poisonous or deleterious substance is unavoidable and is within an established tolerance, regulatory limit, or [[action level]], the food will not be deemed to be adulterated. Tolerances and regulatory limits are thresholds above which a food will be considered adulterated. They are binding on FDA, the food industry, and the courts. Action levels are limits at or above which FDA may regard food as adulterated. They are not binding on FDA. FDA has established numerous action levels (for example, one [[part per million]] [[methylmercury]] in [[fish]]), which are set forth in its booklet Action Levels for Poisonous or Deleterious Substances in Human Food and [[Animal Feed]].

If a food contains a poisonous substance in excess of a tolerance, regulatory limit, or action level, mixing it with "clean" food to reduce the level of contamination is not allowed. The deliberate mixing of adulterated food with good food renders the finished product adulterated (FDA, Compliance Policy Guide [CPG § 555.200]).

===Filth and foreign matter of adulteration ===
Filth and extraneous material include any objectionable substances in foods, such as foreign matter (for example, glass, metal, plastic, wood, stones, sand, cigarette butts), undesirable parts of the raw plant material (such as stems, pits in pitted [[olives]], pieces of shell in canned [[oysters]]), and filth (namely, [[mold]], [[Decomposition|rot]], insect and rodent parts, [[excreta]], decomposition). Under a strict reading of the FD&amp;C Act, any amount of filth in a food would render it adulterated. FDA regulations, however, authorize the agency to issue [[Defect Action Levels]] (DALs) for natural, unavoidable defects that at low levels do not pose a human [[health hazard]] [21 C.F.R. § 110.110]. These DALs are advisory only; they do not have the force of law and do not bind FDA. DALs are set forth in FDA's Compliance Policy Guides and are compiled in the FDA and [[Center for Food Safety and Applied Nutrition]] (CFSAN) Defect Action Level Handbook.

In most cases, DALs are food-specific and defect-specific. For example, the DAL for insect fragments in [[peanut butter]] is an average of thirty or more insect fragments per 100&amp;nbsp;grams (g) [CPG § 570.300]. In the case of hard or sharp foreign objects, the DAL, which is based on the size of the object and the likelihood it will pose a risk of [[choking]] or injury, applies to all foods (see CPG § 555.425).

===Economic-adulteration===
A food is adulterated if it omits a valuable constituent or substitutes another substance, in whole or in part, for a valuable constituent (for instance, [[olive oil]] diluted with [[tea tree oil]]); conceals damage or inferiority in any manner (such as fresh [[fruit]] with [[food coloring]] on its surface to conceal defects); or any substance has been added to it or packed with it to increase its bulk or weight, reduce its quality or strength, or make it appear bigger or of greater value than it is (for example, [[scallops]] to which water has been added to make them heavier).

===Microbiological contamination and adulteration of food ===

The fact that a food is contaminated with [[pathogens]] (harmful [[microorganisms]] such as [[bacteria]], [[viruses]], or [[protozoa]]) may, or may not, render it adulterated. Generally, for ready-to-eat foods, the presence of pathogens will render the food adulterated. For example, the presence of [[Salmonella]] on fresh fruits or vegetables or in ready-to-eat meat or poultry products (such as [[luncheon meats]]) will render those products adulterated.

For meat and poultry products, which are regulated by USDA, the rules are more complicated. Ready-to-eat meat and poultry products contaminated with pathogens, such as Salmonella or Listeria monocytogenes, are adulterated. (Note that [[hot dog|hotdogs]] are considered ready-to-eat products.) For raw meat or poultry products, the presence of pathogens will not always render a product adulterated (because raw meat and poultry products are intended to be cooked, and proper cooking should kill pathogens). Raw poultry contaminated with Salmonella is not adulterated. However, USDA's [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS) has ruled that raw meat or poultry products contaminated with E. coli O157:H7 are adulterated. This is because normal cooking methods may not reduce E. coli O157:H7 below infectious levels. E. coli O157:H7 is the only pathogen that is considered an adulterant when present in raw meat or poultry products.{{fact|date=December 2016}}

==Enforcement actions==

If a food is adulterated, FDA and FSIS have a broad array of enforcement tools.They are of various types. These include seizing and [[Condemnation action|condemning]] the product, detaining imported product, [[enjoining]] persons from [[Food manufacturing|manufacturing]] or [[Food distribution|distributing]] the product, or requesting a [[Product recall|recall]] of the product. Enforcement action is usually preceded by a Warning Letter from FDA to the manufacturer or distributor of the adulterated product. In the case of an adulterated meat or poultry product, FSIS has certain additional powers. FSIS may suspend or withdraw federal inspection of an official establishment. Without federal inspection, an establishment may not produce or process meat or poultry products, and therefore must cease operations. With the exception of [[infant formula]], neither FDA nor FSIS has the authority to require a company to recall an adulterated food product. However, the ability to generate negative publicity gives them considerable powers of persuasion.

State regulators generally have similar enforcement tools at their disposal to prevent the manufacture and distribution of adulterated food. In addition, many states have the authority to immediately [[embargo]] adulterated food and to impose civil [[fine (penalty)|fine]]s. Federal agencies often will coordinate with state or local authorities to remove unsafe food from the market as quickly as possible.

It provides a full range of services, including: acute care, 24-hour [[emergency service]]s, outpatient and [[home care]], wellness and lifestyle medicine, chemotherapy clinic, Surgical [[Weight Loss]] Institute, Hawaii [[Muscular dystrophy|Muscular Dystrophy]] Clinic, Joint Care Center, [[Birthing center|birth center]] and [[interventional cardiology]].&lt;ref name="Annual Report 2008"&gt;[http://www.adventisthealth.org/aboutus/goDocFolder.asp?CN=463 Annual Report 2008] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090410062512/http://www.adventisthealth.org/aboutus/goDocFolder.asp?CN=463 |date=April 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1953, the Windward [[Community association|Community Association]] began a campaign for a hospital to be established in [[Kailua, Honolulu County, Hawaii|Kailua, Oahu]], Hawaii. Dr. Robert Chung, a physician and Mrs. Carolyn Rankin, organizer of a women’s auxiliary, were key leaders in the campaign. Ten acres of land were donated for a [[Construction|building site]], the community raised $170,000 to fund the project and the [[Seventh-day Adventist Church]] donated $600,000. Although support was received from both the Governor’s Hospital Advisory Council and the 30th Territorial Legislature, [[the Board of Health]] refused to designate the area as a separate hospital zone. Their refusal prevented any [[federal funds]] from being available.&lt;ref name="Our History"&gt;[http://www.castlemed.com/history.htm Our History]&lt;/ref&gt;

Two incidents emphasized the need for a local hospital. The first involved a collapsed roof that injured five men and forced them to travel to Honolulu to receive medical attention. The second involved a five-year-old girl who choked to death on a pill. Doctors agreed that had surgery facilities been closer, the child might have lived. Within months the State Board of Health gave their approval and access to federal funds became available.&lt;ref name="Our History"/&gt;

On January 16, 1963, Castle Memorial Hospital opened. It was named in honor of [[Harold Kainalu Long Castle]], who donated the land. The $2 million facility opened with 72 beds and 14 bassinets. In 1983, it became known as Castle Medical Center (CMC) due to the growth and success of the outpatient services and programs. CMC joined [[Adventist Health]] on January 28, 1973.&lt;ref name="Our History"/&gt; 

In 1986, a decision was made to expand and a $8.7 million renovation was completed in 1989. This renovation expanded operating suites, equipment was updated and the kitchen, lobby, chapel and [[gift shop]] was enlarged. The state’s first Labor-Delivery-Recovery-Post Partum rooms were also added.&lt;ref name="Our History"/&gt; In 2017, Castle Medical Center changed its name to Adventist Health Castle. 

==Affiliation==
Adventist Health Castle is part of Adventist Health, a [[health care]] organization headquartered in [[Roseville, California]]. Adventist Health represents regional delivery networks spanning [[California]], [[Hawaii]], [[Oregon]] and Washington. The networks comprise 85 distinct business units including 20 acute care facilities—controlled, managed or leased—with more than 3,000 beds, 17,000 employees, numerous clinics and outpatient facilities, medical foundations and 18 home health agencies.&lt;ref name="Adventist Health: About Us"&gt;[http://www.adventisthealth.org/aboutus/goDocFolder.asp Adventist Health: About Us] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090609234937/http://www.adventisthealth.org/aboutus/goDocFolder.asp |date=2009-06-09 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Australian Institute of Health and Welfare''' ('''AIHW''') is [[Australia]]'s national agency for [[information]] and [[statistics]] on Australia’s [[health]] and [[welfare]]. Statistics and data developed by the AIHW are used extensively to inform discussion and policy decisions on health, [[community services]] and [[housing assistance]]. Under Australia's constitution, health and welfare services are primarily delivered by the states and territories, who are also mainly responsible for the collection of statistics on these services. A fundamental aim of the Institute is to promote consistency among national, state and territory statistics, in order to produce comprehensive national data of the highest standard.

The AIHW is an Australian Government [[statutory agency]] established under the ''Australian Institute of Health and Welfare Act 1987''. The Act contains very strong [[confidentiality]] protections for all data held, and requires the AIHW to publish two key biennial reports in alternate years: ''Australia’s health'' and ''Australia’s welfare''. Numerous other reports are produced each year, all of which are available free of charge on the AIHW website.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aihw.gov.au Australian Institute of Health and Welfare]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare and the National Hospital Performance Authority merged.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.health.gov.au/internet/budget/publishing.nsf/Content/2014-2015_Health_PBS_sup2/$File/2014-15_Health_PBS_4.02_AIHW.docx&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11788">A '''Bachelor of Medical Sciences (BMedSci, BMedSc, BMSc, BSc(Med) degree''' or '''Bachelor of Medical Sciences''' 
is an [[undergraduate]] [[academic degree]] awarded after three or four years of degree level study in disciplines underpinning medicine, typically involving biochemistry, cell biology, physiology, pharmacology and other related disciplines, leading to an in depth understanding of human biology and associated research skills such as study design, statistics and laboratory techniques. It is an equivalent level qualification to the more commonly awarded Bachelor of Science (BSc). Graduates may enter a diverse range of roles including post-graduate study, academia, the biotechnology industry, the pharmaceutical industry, consultancy roles, or unrelated disciplines which make use of the broad range of transferable skills gained through this degree.

==Canada==
At the University of Western Ontario, BMSc is a four-year degree offered by the [[Schulich School of Medicine &amp; Dentistry]]. It is differentiated from a BSc due to the advanced medical sciences orientation of the courses offered such as Anatomy and Pharmacology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.schulich.uwo.ca/bmsc|title=Bachelor of Medical Sciences - Western University|author=|date=|website=www.schulich.uwo.ca|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The University of Alberta offers a BMSc to Faculty of Medicine and Dentistry students who did not complete a Bachelor's degree prior to entry into the program.

==India==
In [[India]], BMSc is an undergraduate degree offered by top universities like [[Panjab University]], [[Punjabi University]] and the [[Indian Institutes of Technology]].

==United Kingdom==
In the United Kingdom, the Bachelor of Medical Sciences degree can be awarded in three situations; firstly as a standalone 3-year first degree, secondly, as a consequence of taking an extra year during a medical or dental course (termed [[Intercalation (university administration)|intercalating]]), or thirdly as an additional part of a medical degree but without any additional years of study. When the degree is obtained without any additional years of study, it may not be viewed as an equivalent qualification. For example, the UK Foundation Programme Office (the British body which manages first jobs for new medical graduates) places less value on a BMedSc degree if an additional year of study has not been undertaken.&lt;ref&gt;FP/AFP 2016 Foundation Programme Reference Guide (pdf) available from http://www.foundationprogramme.nhs.uk/download.asp?file=FP_Reference_Guide_2016_V2-1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless of the way in which this degree is obtained, a research project typically forms a large component of the degree as well as formal teaching in human biology.

Bachelor of Medical Sciences degrees are awarded as a standalone 3 year course by the [[University of Exeter]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exeter.ac.uk/undergraduate/degrees/medicalsci/medicalsci/|title=Medical Sciences BSc  - Undergraduate Study - University of Exeter|author=|date=|website=www.exeter.ac.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[University of Birmingham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/undergraduate/courses/med/medical-sci.aspx|title=BSc Biomedical Science - B900 - Undergraduate Study - University of Birmingham|author=|date=|website=www.birmingham.ac.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Sheffield]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/prospectus/courses-az.do?prospectusYear=2014|title=Undergraduate prospectus 2018|author=|date=|website=www.sheffield.ac.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Bangor University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangor.ac.uk/sms/undergraduate.php.en?view=course&amp;prospectustype=undergraduate&amp;courseid=447&amp;subjectarea=47|title=Undergraduate Courses: School of Medical Sciences, Bangor University|first=Bangor|last=University|date=|website=www.bangor.ac.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Oxford Brookes University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.brookes.ac.uk/studying-at-brookes/courses/undergraduate/2013/medical-science/ |title=Archived copy |access-date=2014-01-28 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140202175342/http://www.brookes.ac.uk/studying-at-brookes/courses/undergraduate/2013/medical-science/ |archive-date=2014-02-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; De Montfort University,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dmu.ac.uk/study/courses/undergraduate-courses/medical-science.aspx|title=Medical Science BMedSci (Hons)|author=|date=|website=www.dmu.ac.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[University of St Andrews]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.st-andrews.ac.uk/subjects/medicine/|title=Medicine|author=|date=|website=www.st-andrews.ac.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medical schools which award an intercalated Bachelor of Medical Sciences after an additional year of study are [[Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smd.qmul.ac.uk/undergraduate/intercalated/|title=Intercalated degrees - Barts and The London School of Medicine and Dentistry|author=|date=|website=www.smd.qmul.ac.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Birmingham]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/mds/undergraduate.aspx|title=Undergraduate Medicine - Dentistry - Pharmacy - Nursing - Biomedical Science degrees - University of Birmingham - University of Birmingham|author=|date=|website=www.birmingham.ac.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Dundee]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medicine.dundee.ac.uk/intercalated-degree-bmsc|title=Intercalated Degree (BMSc) - School of Medicine|author=|date=|website=medicine.dundee.ac.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Edinburgh]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/schools-departments/medicine-vet-medicine/undergraduate/medicine/mbchb/intercalated-honours|title=Intercalated honours programme|author=|date=|website=ed.ac.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[University of Sheffield]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shef.ac.uk/medicine/prospective_ug/mbchb/course_structure/intercal|title=Undergraduate courses: Intercalated bachelor of me - Course Structure - Medical Degree - Prospective Undergraduates - The Medical School -  The University of Sheffield|first=University of|last=Sheffield|date=|website=www.shef.ac.uk|accessdate=5 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Egypt  ==
In Egypt, the bachelor of medical sciences is awarded after four years of study in addition to an internship year in which interns are trained in multiple public and university hospitals.

The degree is offered in five universities in Egypt: [[October 6 University]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.o6u.edu.eg|title=O6U UNIVERSITY|website=www.o6u.edu.eg|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Misr University for Science and Technology]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.must.edu.eg|title=MUST-Misr University for Science &amp; Technology|website=www.must.edu.eg|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pharos University in Alexandria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pua.edu.eg|title=Pharos University in Alexandria|website=Pharos University|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Beni Suef University|Beni-Suef University]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bsu.edu.eg|title=جامعة بنى سويف|website=www.bsu.edu.eg|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Menoufia University]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.menofia.edu.eg|title=جــــامـــعة المنـــوفية|website=www.menofia.edu.eg|access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faculties of applied medical sciences offer various disciplines for students to choose from, including medical laboratories, radiology and medical imaging, therapeutic nutrition, and biomedical equipment.

[[File:Beedibundle.jpg|right|thumb|Packs of beedies.]]
[[File:Beedi making as handicraft.jpg|thumb|Beedi making process, rare handicrafts in Akkaraipattu, Sri Lanka. Bidi leaf (''[[Bauhinia racemosa]]'') and shredded tobacco are prepared and finalize with thread binding.]]
A '''beedi''' (also spelled '''bidi'''&lt;ref name=reuters /&gt; or '''biri'''&lt;ref name=Sunley /&gt;) is a thin [[cigarette]] or [[cigar|mini-cigar]] filled with [[tobacco]] flake and commonly wrapped in a ''[[Diospyros melanoxylon]]''&lt;ref name=Malson /&gt; or ''[[Piliostigma racemosum]]''&lt;ref name=foi /&gt; leaf tied with a string or adhesive at one end. It originates from the [[Indian subcontinent]].&lt;ref name=southasia /&gt;&lt;ref name=Yen /&gt; The name is derived from the [[Marwar]]i word ''beeda''—a mixture of [[betel nuts]], herbs, and spices wrapped in a leaf.&lt;ref name=Pathak /&gt;

A traditional method of tobacco use throughout South Asia and parts of the Middle East,&lt;ref name=Yen /&gt; today beedies are popular&lt;ref name=Sunley /&gt; and inexpensive&lt;ref name=John /&gt; in [[India]], where beedi consumption outpaces that of conventional cigarettes, accounting for 48% of Indian tobacco consumption in 2008.&lt;ref name=Sunley /&gt;

Beedies deliver more [[nicotine]],&lt;ref name=Delnevo /&gt; [[carbon monoxide]],&lt;ref name=bidifacts /&gt; and [[Tar (tobacco residue)|tar]]&lt;ref name=bidifacts /&gt; and carry a greater risk of oral cancers.&lt;ref name=southasia /&gt; As with many other types of [[smoking]], beedis increase the risk of certain kinds of cancers, [[heart disease]], and [[lung disease]].&lt;ref name=bidifacts /&gt; They may also be more harmful than other forms of tobacco consumption.&lt;ref name=dnai /&gt;

== History ==

[[File:beedies.jpg|left|thumb|A pack of Mangalore Ganesh beedies]]

Indian tobacco cultivation began in the late 17th century, and beedies were first created when tobacco workers took leftover tobacco and rolled it in leaves.&lt;ref name=Lal /&gt;

The commercial Indian beedi industry saw rapid growth during the 1930s&lt;ref name=histbook /&gt; probably driven by an expansion of tobacco cultivation at the time&lt;ref name=ilo /&gt; but also helped by [[Gandhi]]'s support of Indian industry and Indian products.&lt;ref name=Census /&gt;&lt;ref name=jainvijay /&gt; Perhaps due to this, educated classes in India grew to prefer beedies to cigarettes&lt;ref name=Lal /&gt; although this is no longer the case.&lt;ref name=Kamboj /&gt; Muslim leaders, calling cigarettes foreign products, have also endorsed beedies at times.&lt;ref name ="Imam"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Imām | first = Hassan  | title = Indian national movement | publisher = Anmol Publications PVT. LTD. | year = 1999 | pages = 200 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0AFo-zNYKScC&amp;lpg=PA2&amp;dq=Indian%20National%20Movement%20Study%20on%20the%20role%20of%20contribution%20made%20by%20people%20of%20Bihar%20towards%20the%20national%20movement%20during%201919%E2%80%9331.&amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false | isbn = 978-81-261-0199-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By the middle of the 20th century beedi manufacture had grown into a highly competitive industry.&lt;ref name=Lal /&gt; This stage of commercial production—at the height of the beedi's popularity{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}—saw the creation of many new beedi brands&lt;ref name=Lal /&gt; as well as beedi factories employing upwards of one hundred, primarily male, beedi rollers.&lt;ref name=histbook /&gt;

Factory-based beedi production declined as a result of increased regulation during the 1940s, '50s, and '60s,&lt;ref name=ilo /&gt; and beedi-making became a [[cottage industry]] with a home-based women workforce predominantly employed only in the beedi rolling.&lt;ref name=ilo /&gt; In contrast, males continue to be employed in other aspects of beedi production.&lt;ref name=ilo /&gt;

== Use ==

Unlike cigarettes, beedies must be puffed frequently to keep them lit, and doing so requires effort.&lt;ref name=Malson /&gt;

=== Poor man's cigarette ===
Beedi smoking tends to be associated with a lower social standing,&lt;ref name=Kamboj /&gt; and these tobacco-filled leaves are inexpensive when compared to regular cigarettes.&lt;ref name=John /&gt; Those with a high social standing who do smoke beedies often do so out of the public eye; however, the cultural trend is changing.&lt;ref name=Kamboj /&gt;

=== In the United States ===
In the United States, beedies are treated like conventional cigarettes. They are taxed at the same rates,&lt;ref name=Yen /&gt; are required to have a tax stamp, and must carry the [[Surgeon General of the United States|Surgeon General]]'s warning.&lt;ref name=Yen /&gt; However, a study done in San Francisco showed that about four in ten packs of beedies did not contain the required warning label and seven in ten did not carry the tax stamp.&lt;ref name=Yen /&gt; 2006 statistics on beedi usage show that 2.9% of high school students in the United States take part in beedi smoking compared to 1.4% of those aged 18 to 24.&lt;ref name=CDC /&gt;

=== In the United Kingdom ===
Beedis are currently legal in the UK and are subject to the same taxation as cigarettes. One must be aged 18 or over to purchase them.&lt;ref&gt;Sharrow Mills, [https://sharrowmills.com/pages/the-encyclopedia-of-tobacco-types-of-tobacco-guide "The Encyclopaedia of Tobacco"], ''Wilsons of Sharrow'', 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flavoured beedies ===
Some beedies are flavoured.&lt;ref name=Malson /&gt; Both Canada&lt;ref name=caban /&gt; and the US&lt;ref name=usban /&gt; have banned flavoured cigarettes.

== Manufacture ==

[[File:Beedi factory near Nileshwaram, Kerala, India.jpg|thumbnail|right|Factory workers hand cut the leaves using scissors and a metal stencil guide. After cutting a sufficient number of wrappers, they will move on to roll approximately 1,000 beedies each per day.]]

Over 8 million Indians are employed in the manufacture of beedies,&lt;ref name=Govekar /&gt; a [[cottage industry]] that is typically done by women in their homes.&lt;ref name=exploit /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|date=April 15, 2016|title=India's traditional cigarette makers halt production over health warnings|author=Kalra, Aditya|publisher=[[Reuters]]|url=http://in.reuters.com/article/india-tobacco-cigarettes-beedis-idINKCN0X42BA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Workers roll an average of 500–1000 beedies per day, handling {{convert|225|–|450|g}} of tobacco flake.&lt;ref name=Bhisey /&gt; Studies have shown that [[nicotine]] levels in the bodily fluids of beedi workers are elevated even among those who do not use tobacco.&lt;ref name=Bhisey /&gt;

The production of beedies is also popular in [[Bangladesh]]. According to the 2014 ''[[List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=List of Goods Produced by Child Labor or Forced Labor|url=http://www.dol.gov/ilab/reports/child-labor/list-of-goods/|publisher=[[United States Department of Labor]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; published by the [[Bureau of International Labor Affairs]], the informal sector in these countries employs underage children in the production of beedies "in response to consumer preferences".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=[[WikiLeaks]]|url=https://www.wikileaks.org/plusd/cables/08DHAKA745_a.html|title=BANGLADESH: CHILD/FORCED LABOR IN GOODS PRODUCTION – TVPRA RESPONSE|date=July 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tendu leaves ===

[[Diospyros melanoxylon|Tendu (''Diospyros melanoxylon'')]] leaves make excellent wrappers, and the success of the beedi is due, in part, to this leaf.&lt;ref name=Lal /&gt; The leaves are in abundance shortly after the tobacco crop is cured and so are ready to be used in beedi manufacture.&lt;ref name=Lal /&gt; Collected in the summer and made into bundles, the leaves are dried in the sun for three to six days before being used as wrappers.&lt;ref name=Malson /&gt;

In the summers following his high school graduation until his second year in medical school, Carson worked at a variety of jobs: as a clerk in the payroll office of [[Ford Motor Company]]; supervisor of a six-person crew picking up trash along the highway under a federal jobs program for inner-city students; a clerk in the mailroom of [[Young &amp; Rubicam|Young &amp; Rubicam Advertising]]; assembling fender parts and inspecting back window louvers on the assembly line at [[Chrysler]]; a crane operator at Sennett Steel; and finally a radiology technician taking X-rays.&lt;ref name="Carson 1990, 2011 pp82–90, 104–107"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Ben|last2=Murphey|first2=Cecil|year=2011|origyear=1990|title=Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story, 20th Anniversary edition|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|publisher=Zondervan|pages=82–90, 104–07|isbn=978-0-310-54650-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Yale, Carson had a part-time job on campus as a student police aide.&lt;ref name="Carson 2016 pp21–22"&gt;{{cite book|last=Carson|first=Candy|year=2016|title=A Doctor in the House: My Life with Ben Carson|location=New York|publisher=Sentinel|pages=21–22|isbn=978-1-59523-124-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, Carson said he had been offered a scholarship to [[United States Military Academy|West Point]]. ''Politico'' reported that West Point has no record of his ever seeking admission. The academy does not award scholarships to anyone;&lt;ref name="witch hunt"/&gt; cadets receive a free education and room and board in exchange for a commitment to serve in the military for at least five years after graduation.&lt;ref name="witch hunt" /&gt; Carson also said the [[University of Michigan]] had offered him a scholarship. His staff later said that the described scenario was similar to that of West Point, as he never actually applied for entry to the University of Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first1 = David | last1 = Weigel | first2 = David A. | last2 = Fahrenthold | title = New front-runner Ben Carson faces closer scrutiny of his life story | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/newly-minted-frontrunner-ben-carson-faces-new-scrutiny-of-his-life-story/2015/11/06/8877e032-84b8-11e5-8ba6-cec48b74b2a7_story.html | newspaper = [[The Washington Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his autobiography, ''Gifted Hands'', Carson recounted that exams for a Yale psychology course he took his junior year, "Perceptions 301", were inexplicably burned, forcing students to retake the exam. Carson said that other students walked out in protest when they discovered the retest was significantly harder than the original examination, but he alone finished the test. On doing so, Carson said he was congratulated by the course instructor who told him the retest was a hoax intended to find "the most honest student in the class". Carson said the professor awarded him $10, and that a photographer for the ''[[Yale Daily News]]'' was present to take his picture, which appeared in the student newspaper with a story about the experiment. Doubts were raised about this story in 2015 during Carson's presidential campaign. ''The Wall Street Journal'' attempted to verify Carson's account, reporting that Yale undergraduate courses were identified with only two digits in the early 1970s, and that Yale offered no course called "Perceptions 301" at that time and that Carson's photo never appeared in the ''Yale Daily News''.&lt;ref name="WSJ deeper questions" /&gt; Carson, while acknowledging the class number was not correct, said: "You know, when you write a book with a co-writer and you say that there was a class, a lot of [the] time they'll put a number or something just to give it more meat. You know, obviously, decades later, I'm not going to remember the course number."&lt;ref name="abcn_'Thi"&gt;{{Cite news | title = 'This Week' Transcript: Ben Carson and Donald Trump | publisher = ABC News | date = November 8, 2015 | accessdate = November 9, 2015 | url = http://abcnews.go.com/Politics/week-transcript-donald-trump-ben-carson/story?id=35044135 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medical school===
Carson entered the [[University of Michigan Health System|University of Michigan Medical School]] in 1973, and at first struggled academically, doing so poorly on his first set of comprehensive exams that his faculty adviser recommended he drop out of medical school or take a reduced academic load and take longer to finish.&lt;ref name="Carson 2008 p94"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Ben|last2=Lewis|first2=Gregg|date=2008|title=Take the Risk: Learning to Identify, Choose, and Live with Acceptable Risk|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|publisher=Zondervan|page=94|isbn=978-0-310-25973-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; He continued with a regular academic load, and his grades improved to average in his first year of medical school. By his second year of medical school, Carson began to excel academically by seldom attending lectures and instead, studying textbooks and lecture notes from 6 a.m. to 11 p.m.&lt;ref name="Carson 1990, 2011 p107"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Ben|last2=Murphey|first2=Cecil|year=2011|origyear=1990|title=Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story, 20th Anniversary edition|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|publisher=Zondervan|page=107|isbn=978-0-310-54650-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson graduated from the University of Michigan Medical School with an [[Doctor of Medicine|M.D.]] in 1977, and was elected to the [[Alpha Omega Alpha]] Honor Medical Society.&lt;ref name="Carson 2013"/&gt;

Carson was then accepted by the [[Johns Hopkins School of Medicine|Johns Hopkins University School of Medicine]] neurosurgery program, where he served one year as a surgical intern and five years as a neurosurgery [[Residency (medicine)|resident]], completing the final year as chief resident in 1983.&lt;ref name="Carson 1990, 2011 p125–126"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Ben|last2=Murphey|first2=Cecil|year=2011|origyear=1990|title=Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story, 20th Anniversary edition|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|publisher=Zondervan|pages=125–26|isbn=978-0-310-54650-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then spent one year (1983–1984) as a [[Senior registrar|Senior Registrar]] in neurosurgery at the [[Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital]] in [[Nedlands, Western Australia|Nedlands]], a suburb of [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref name="Carson 1990, 2011 p135–136"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Carson|first1=Ben|last2=Murphey|first2=Cecil|year=2011|origyear=1990|title=Gifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story, 20th Anniversary edition|location=Grand Rapids, Mich.|publisher=Zondervan|pages=135–36|isbn=978-0-310-54650-4|quote=The position of senior registrar doesn't exist in America but lies somewhere between being a chief resident and a junior faculty member.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After medical school, Carson completed his residency in neurosurgery at [[Johns Hopkins Hospital]] in [[Baltimore]], [[Maryland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://afam.nts.jhu.edu/people/Carson/carson.completebio.pdf |title=A Healer Beyond the Operating Room|date= July 2005|website=afam.nts.jhu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around this time, as Carson later related to Karen Hunter of [[Sirius XM]], he was held at gunpoint at a [[Popeyes Louisiana Kitchen|Popeyes]] restaurant in Baltimore. [[Armstrong Williams]], Carson's campaign business manager, later told [[Wolf Blitzer]] of CNN that several people in the neighborhood chased the robber down the street. Neither the Baltimore police department nor Popeyes could corroborate Carson's story, since no police report had been made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Scott|first1=Eugene|last2=Glover|first2=Scott|title=Carson Camp Shuts Down Questions About Popeye's|url=http://www.cnn.com/2015/10/09/politics/ben-carson-popeyes-gunman/|publisher=CNN|accessdate=November 9, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, at the suggestion of an Australian colleague, Carson accepted the position of senior registrar at [[Sir Charles Gairdner Hospital]] (in [[Perth]], [[Western Australia]]), spending one year there.&lt;ref name="perth"&gt;{{cite news |author=Cathy O'Leary |title=US presidential hopeful Ben Carson saved lives in Perth |url=https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/30090513/us-presidential-candidate-ben-carson-was-a-life-saver-in-australia/ |newspaper=The West Australian |date=November 13, 2015 |accessdate=November 15, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151117031841/https://au.news.yahoo.com/thewest/wa/a/30090513/us-presidential-candidate-ben-carson-was-a-life-saver-in-australia/ |archive-date=November 17, 2015 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon returning to Johns Hopkins in 1984, Carson was appointed the university's Director of Pediatric Neurosurgery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nationalinterest.org/blog/dr-ben-carson-president-what-you-need-know-12810|publisher=NationalInterest.org|title=Ben Carson for President: What You Need to Know}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a surgeon, he specialized in traumatic brain injuries, brain and spinal cord tumors, [[achondroplasia]], neurological and congenital disorders, [[craniosynostosis]], [[epilepsy]], and [[trigeminal neuralgia]].&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/experts/profiles/team_member_profile/E83A85D46351E25BE722939B61854C65/Benjamin_Carson |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110104065134/http://www.hopkinsmedicine.org/neurology_neurosurgery/experts/profiles/team_member_profile/E83A85D46351E25BE722939B61854C65/Benjamin_Carson |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 4, 2011 |title=Neurologists &amp; Neurosurgeons at Johns Hopkins he also worked at K.H.M.H in Belize in 2009 where he did twelve operations. – Profile: Dr. Benjamin Carson |publisher=Hopkins Medicine |date=June 24, 2013 |accessdate=May 20, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has said that his [[hand–eye coordination]] and three-dimensional reasoning made him a gifted surgeon.&lt;ref name="PennState"&gt;{{cite web|author=What do you think? |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-8NRSfk_a8 |title=Conversation from Penn State: Ben Carson Interview |publisher=Conversations.psu.edu |date=March 7, 2010|accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, Carson was the lead neurosurgeon of a 70-member surgical team that separated [[conjoined twins]], [[Patrick and Benjamin Binder]], who had been joined at the back of the head ([[craniopagus twins]]); the separation surgery held promise in part because the twin boys had separate brains.&lt;ref name=Terris13Nov /&gt; Both boys entered the hospital "giggling and kicking" in preparation for surgery without which the seven-month-old twins would never have been able to crawl, walk, or even turn over.&lt;ref name=Terris13Nov /&gt; The Johns Hopkins surgical team rehearsed the surgery for weeks, practising on two dolls secured together by [[Velcro]].&lt;ref name=Terris13Nov /&gt; Although follow-up stories were few following the Binder twins' return to Germany seven months after the operation,&lt;ref name=Terris13Nov /&gt; both twins were reportedly "far from normal" two years after the procedure, with one in a [[Persistent vegetative state|vegetative state]].&lt;ref name=Terris13Nov&gt;{{cite news|work=The Washington Post|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/rweb/life/the-story-of-the-surgery-that-made-ben-carson-famous--and-its-complicated-aftermath/2015/11/13/15b5f900-88c1-11e5-be39-0034bb576eee_story.html|title=The Story of the Surgery that made Ben Carson Famous|first1=Ben|last1=Terris|first2=Stephanie|last2=Kirchner|date=November 13, 2015|accessdate=November 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;  |title=Binder Twins Far From Normal Two Years After Surgery |url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1989/Binder-Twins-Far-From-Normal-Two-Years-After-Surgery/id-424f811a9feb67934f4c3b6e86586ae2 |agency=Associated Press |date=June 26, 1989 |accessdate=December 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Twins Disjoined at Head Leave the Hospital |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/04/07/us/twins-disjoined-at-head-leave-the-hospital.html |newspaper=The New York Times |agency=Associated Press |date=April 7, 1988 |accessdate=December 16, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Karen L.

According to the ''Washington Post'', the Binder surgery "launched the stardom" of Carson, who "walked out of the operating room that day into a spotlight that has never dimmed", beginning with a press conference that was covered worldwide, which created name recognition leading to publishing deals and a [[Motivational speaker|motivational speaking]] career.&lt;ref name=Terris13Nov /&gt; On the condition the film would have its premiere in [[Baltimore, Maryland|Baltimore]],&lt;ref name=Terris13Nov /&gt; Carson agreed to a cameo appearance as "head surgeon" in the 2003 [[Farrelly brothers]]' comedy ''[[Stuck on You (film)|Stuck on You]]'', starring [[Matt Damon]] and [[Greg Kinnear]] as conjoined twins who, unhappy after their surgical separation, continue life attached to each other by Velcro.&lt;ref name=Terris13Nov /&gt;&lt;ref name=Griswold13Aug&gt;{{cite news|work=Mediate|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/watch-ben-carsons-cameo-in-2003-comedy-stuck-on-you/|title=WATCH: Ben Carson's Cameo in 2003 Comedy Stuck on You|date=August 13, 2015|accessdate=November 15, 2015|first=Alex|last=Griswold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson delivered the keynote address at a Mannatech distributor convention in 2011, during which he said the company had donated funds to help him obtain a coveted endowed chair post at [[Johns Hopkins Medicine]]: "... three years ago I had an endowed chair bestowed upon me and uh, it requires $2.5 million to do an endowed chair and I'm proud to say that part of that $2.5 million came from Mannatech." In October 2015, Carson's campaign team said "there was no contribution from Mannatech to Johns Hopkins", and his statement had been "a legitimate mistake on his part. Confusion. He had been doing some fundraising for the hospital and some other chairs about that time, and he simply got things mixed up."&lt;ref name=WSJ_JH&gt;{{cite news|last1=Maremont|first1=Mark|title=A Mystery in Ben Carson's Ties With Supplement Maker Mannatech|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2015/10/08/a-mystery-in-ben-carsons-ties-with-supplement-maker-mannatech/|accessdate=November 3, 2015|work=[[The Wall Street Journal]]|date=October 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[CNBC]] GOP debate on October 28, 2015, Carson was asked about his relationship with Mannatech. He replied, "That's easy to answer. I didn't have any involvement with Mannatech. Total propaganda. I did a couple speeches for them. I did speeches for other people—they were paid speeches. It is absolutely absurd to say I had any kind of relation with them.

On November 3, 2015, Mannatech said on its website that for compliance with [[Campaign finance in the United States|Federal campaign finance regulations]], the company had removed all references to Carson before he announced his bid for the presidency.&lt;ref name="Mannatech"&gt;{{cite web|title=Mannatech's Response to Question at GOP Presidential Debate

In 2014, some [[United States House of Representatives|House]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republicans]] (who later formed the House [[Freedom Caucus]]) approached Carson about the possibility of his standing for [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives|Speaker of the House]] in the event that the incumbent Speaker, [[John Boehner]], had to step down due to intra-party disunion. Carson declined, citing preparations for his [[Ben Carson presidential campaign, 2016|2016 presidential campaign]]. Ultimately, Boehner [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, October 2015#Speakership and resignation of John Boehner|resigned]] in October 2015, and [[Paul Ryan]] was [[Speaker of the United States House of Representatives election, October 2015|elected]] as the new Speaker.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/265138-exclusive-house-republicans-recruited-carson-for-speaker|title=Exclusive: House Republicans recruited Carson for Speaker|last=Mali|first=Meghashyam|date=2016-01-07|work=TheHill|access-date=2017-10-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Ben Carson by Gage Skidmore 7.jpg|thumb|Carson speaking at a campaign event in August 2015]]

=== Background and increasing political visibility ===
Carson, who had been registered as a [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]], changed his registration to [[Independent politician|independent]] in the 1990s after watching Republicans [[Impeachment of Bill Clinton|impeach President Clinton]] for perjury and obstruction of justice regarding an [[Lewinsky scandal|extramarital affair]] with [[Monica Lewinsky]]. "I just saw so much hypocrisy in both parties", he said.&lt;ref name="Switches"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Solomon|first1=John|title=Ben Carson officially switches political parties, rejoins GOP|url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/nov/4/ben-carson-officially-switches-parties-returns-gop/ |website=The Washington Times|date=November 4, 2014 |accessdate= November 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2013, Carson said he was not a member of any [[political party]].&lt;ref name=NR&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.nationalreview.com/article/340769/dr-carsons-prescription-john-fund |last=Fund|first=John|title= Dr. Carson's Prescription|work=National Review|date=February 15, 2013 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''America the Beautiful'' (2013), he wrote: "I believe it is a very good idea for physicians, scientists, engineers, and others trained to make decisions based on facts and empirical data to get involved in the political arena."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= America the Beautiful|publisher=Zondervan|page=34|first1=Benjamin |last1=Carson, M.D.|first2=Candy |last2= Carson |isbn=978-0-310-33091-2|date=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=America the Beautiful |publisher= Zondervan |page= 35|first1=Benjamin |last1=Carson, M.D.|first2=Candy |last2=Carson|isbn= 978-0-310-33091-2|date= 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson was the keynote speaker at the [[National Prayer Breakfast]] on February 7, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Zondervan Author Ben Carson Gives Keynote at 2013 National Prayer Breakfast|url= http://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/zondervan-author-ben-carson-gives-keynote-at-2013-national-prayer-breakfast-190221831.html| agency= PR Newswire|date=February 7, 2013|accessdate=February 8, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The speech garnered Carson considerable attention because the event is normally apolitical in nature, and the speech was critical of the philosophy and policies of President [[Barack Obama]], who was sitting 10 feet away.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindsay|first1=James|title=Ben Carson: All You Need to Know|url=http://www.newsweek.com/ben-carson-all-you-need-know-328547|accessdate=June 17, 2015|work=Newsweek|date=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

About the speech, Carson said: "I don't think it was particularly political... You know, I'm a physician".&lt;ref name= Rea&gt;{{cite news| url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/politics/2013/02/dr-ben-carson-for-president-ill-leave-that-up-to-god/ |title=Dr. Ben Carson for President? 'I'll Leave That Up to God' | last=Rea|first=Kari|publisher = ABC News |date=February 17, 2013 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Regarding the policies of President Obama, he said: "There are a number of policies that I don't believe lead to the growth of our nation and don't lead to the elevation of our nation. I don't want to sit here and say all of his policies are bad. What I would like to see more often in this nation is an open and intelligent conversation".&lt;ref name=Rea /&gt;

Carson's sudden popularity among conservatives led to his being invited as a featured speaker at the 2013 [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC). He tied for seventh place in the ''[[The Washington Times|Washington Times]]''/CPAC 2013 [[Straw Poll]] with 4% of the 3,000 ballots cast.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/blog/watercooler/2013/feb/27/yes-ben-carson-will-speak-cpac/ |title=Dr. Ben Carson will speak at CPAC after stealing spotlight from President Obama | last=Harper|first=Jennifer|work =The Washington Times |date=February 27, 2013 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kilar |first=Steve |url=http://www.baltimoresun.com/health/bs-md-carson-at-cpac-20130316,0,7951595.story |title=Dr. Ben Carson announces his retirement, hints at political future |work=The Baltimore Sun |date=March 17, 2013 |accessdate=May 20, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2014 CPAC straw poll, he was in third place with 9% of the vote, behind [[United States Senate|senators]] [[Ted Cruz]] of [[Texas]] (with 11%) and [[Rand Paul]] of [[Kentucky]] (31%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rand Paul wins 2014 CPAC straw poll |first=Stephen |last=Dinan |url= http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2014/mar/8/rand-paul-wins-2014-cpac-straw-poll-ted-cruz-finis/  | work =The Washington Times |date=March 8, 2014 |accessdate= March 8, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the presidential straw poll at the 2013 [[Values Voter Summit]] he and [[Rick Santorum]] polled 13%, with winner Ted Cruz polling 42%, and in 2014 he polled 20% to Cruz's winning 25%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2013/10/12/cruz-wins-religious-conservatives-2016-straw-poll |title= Cruz wins Values Voter Summit's 2016 straw poll| publisher=Fox News Channel|date=October 12, 2013| accessdate= January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://thehill.com/blogs/ballot-box/presidential-races/219099-cruz-wins-value-voters-straw-poll |title =Cruz clinches straw poll gold again| first=Julian|last= Hattem | work=The Hill|date=September 27, 2014|accessdate=January 13, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 4, 2014, the day of the [[2014 midterms]], he rejoined the Republican Party, saying it was "truly a pragmatic move" because he was considering running for [[United States presidential election, 2016|president in 2016]].&lt;ref name="Switches" /&gt;

In January 2015, ''[[The Weekly Standard]]'' reported that the Draft Carson Committee had raised $13 million by the end of 2014, shortly after Carson performed well in a [[CNN]]/ORC poll of potential candidates in December 2014, coming second in two different versions. He polled 10% to [[Mitt Romney]]'s 20%, but in the same poll with Romney removed from the list, Carson polled 11% to [[Jeb Bush]]'s 14%.&lt;ref name=Barnes1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://i2.cdn.turner.com/cnn/2014/images/12/02/cnnorcpoll12022014.pdf|format=PDF|title=Interviews with 1,045 adult Americans conducted by telephone by ORC International on November 21-23, 2014.|publisher=I2.cdn.turner.com |accessdate=January 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' mentioned that the Draft Carson Committee had chairmen in all of [[Iowa]]'s [[List of counties in Iowa|99 counties]], and that Carson had recently led two separate [[Public Policy Polling|Public Policy polls]] for the state of [[Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Epstein |first=Reid J. |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/outsider-ben-carson-rises-in-2016-gop-field-1422059182 |title=Outsider Ben Carson Rises in 2016 GOP Field |work=The Wall Street Journal |date=January 23, 2015 |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.publicpolicypolling.com/pdf/PPP_Release_122925.pdf |format=PDF |title=Hillary holds steady against butty Republican field in Pennsylvania |publisher=Publicpolicypolling.com |accessdate=May 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Announcement of campaign ===

The announcement speech was preceded by a choir singing "[[Lose Yourself]]" with Carson sitting in the audience. After the song, Carson took the stage and announced his candidacy alongside a speech on his [[rags to riches]] life story, at one point stating: "I remember when our favorite drug dealer was killed."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/05/04/ben-carson-announces-candidacy-and-says-im-not-a-politician/|title=Ben Carson announces candidacy and says, 'I'm not a politician'|last=Terris|first=Ben|date=May 4, 2015|newspaper=The Washington Post|language=en-US|issn=0190-8286|access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Surge in polls ===
[[File:Ben Carson by Gage Skidmore 9.jpg|thumb|Carson taking a photo with a supporter at a rally in August 2015]]
In October 2015, the [[Super PAC]] supporting Carson, The 2016 Committee (formerly the Draft Carson Committee) announced it had received donations in mostly $100 increments from more than 200 small businesses around the country over the course of one week. ''[[Fox Business]]'' reported that "Carson's outsider status is growing his small business support base." Ben Walters, a fundraiser for The 2016 Committee expressed optimism about Carson's small business support base: "It's unbelievable the diversity of businesses that we are bringing on. We are seeing everything from doctors' offices and folks in the healthcare profession to motorcycle repair shops and bed and breakfasts."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/features/2015/10/19/small-business-donations-bulls-eye-for-ben-carson-super-pac.html|publisher=Fox Business|title=Small Business Donations a Bull's-Eye for Ben Carson Super PAC|date=October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October, it was noted that Carson's "improbable" political career had surged in polls and fundraising, while he continued to participate in [[Republican Party presidential debates, 2016|nationally televised Republican debates]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authors=Lightman, David &amp; Clark, Lesley|url=http://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/gop-race-gets-jolt-of-diversity-with-ben-carson-carly-fiorina/ |title=GOP race gets jolt of diversity with Ben Carson, Carly Fiorina|work=[[The Seattle Times]]|date=May 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Lightman, David|url=http://www.mcclatchydc.com/news/politics-government/election/article41225289.html |title=Ben Carson soaring as GOP heads into new debates|work=[[The McClatchy Company|McClatchy]]|date=October 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign brought considerable attention to Carson's past. [[CBS News]] described Carson's narrative of "overcoming impossible odds as a child growing up in an impoverished, single-parent household to reach international prominence as a pediatric neurosurgeon" as "a key part of his presidential campaign." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New questions emerge over Carson's personal history|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/ben-carson-new-questions-personal-history/|publisher=CBS news|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Wall Street Journal]]'' said the narrative came under "the harsh scrutiny of presidential politics, where rivals and media hunt for embellishments and omissions that can hobble a campaign."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Carson's Past Faces Deeper Questions|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/ben-carsons-past-faces-deeper-questions-1446861864?alg=y|work=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=November 8, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; CNN characterized the core narrative as "acts of violence as an angry young man," followed by a spiritual epiphany that transformed Carson into the "composed figure" he now portrays.&lt;ref name="tale of two" /&gt; Media challenges to a number of Carson's statements included allegations of discrepancies between documented facts and certain assertions in his autobiography ''Gifted Hands''—allegations dismissed by Carson as a media "witch hunt".&lt;ref name="witch hunt"&gt;{{cite web| title =Carson says West Point story, others about his past are bias, and amount to a 'witch hunt.'| publisher =[[Fox News Channel]]| date =November 7, 2015| url =http://www.foxnews.com/politics/2015/11/07/carson-defends-west-point-claim-and-criticizes-media-attention-on-issue/ | accessdate =November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2015, the ''[[Detroit Free Press]]'' republished an article from 1988 "to try to bring some clarity to the claims currently being brought into question."&lt;ref name="88freepress"&gt;{{cite web| title =88 Free Press article helps clarify Ben Carson claims| work =[[Detroit Free Press]]| date =November 11, 2015| url =http://www.freep.com/story/news/politics/2015/11/11/88-free-press-article-helps-clarify-ben-carson-claims/75584922/ | accessdate =November 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2015, Carson's campaign aired a 60-second TV advertisement in which excerpts from Carson's stump speech were intercut with a rap by an artist named Aspiring Mogul.&lt;ref name=RapAd&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2015/11/ben-carson-rap-ad-215550|publisher=Politico.com|title=Ben Carson's Rap Ad|date=November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They spent $150,000 on the ads, which were aired in Atlanta, Detroit and Miami.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2015/11/05/ben-carson-releases-rap-ad-on-the-radio/|title=Ben Carson Releases Rap Ad on the Radio|last=Parker|first=Ashley|date=November 5, 2015|website=The New York Times – First Draft|access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson defended the ad, saying "Well, there are people in the campaign who felt that was a good way to do things ... I support them in doing that, but I probably would have taken a little different approach."&lt;ref name=RapAd /&gt; Later, he said the advertisement was done without his knowledge, that "it was done by people who have no concept of the black community and what they were doing", and that he was "horrified" by it.&lt;ref name=Horrified&gt;{{cite news|url=http://time.com/4191428/ben-carson-rap-advertisement-radio/|title=Ben Carson 'Horrified' By His Own Campaign Ad|last=Frizell|first=Sam|website=TIME.com|access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Statements that Carson made regarding foreign policy called into doubt his familiarity with the domain. ''[[The New York Times]]'' reported in 2015, "Carson has acknowledged being something of a novice on foreign affairs". Regarding the [[Ukrainian crisis]], Carson would send arms to Ukraine to aid it in its fight against pro-Russian rebels. He also believes the [[Baltic states]] should "get involved in NATO" (apparently unaware that they are NATO members).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Mullany|first1=Gerry|title=Ben Carson on the Issues|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/04/us/politics/ben-carson-on-the-issues.html|work=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a November 2015 Republican debate, Carson declared his intentions to make [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]] "look like losers" as he would "destroy their caliphate". Carson also advocated capturing a "big energy field" outside of [[Anbar (town)|Anbar]], [[Iraq]], which he said could be accomplished "fairly easily". Regarding the [[Middle East]], he also claimed that "the Chinese are there"; while in contrast, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that "there are no known members of the Chinese armed forces currently engaged in any conflict in the Middle East".&lt;ref name=ISlosers&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jacobs|first1=Ben|title=Ben Carson: I will make Isis 'look like losers' if elected president|url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2015/nov/10/ben-carson-republican-debate-isis-losers|work=[[The Guardian]]|accessdate=November 11, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson said that he is not opposed to a [[Palestinian state]], but questioned why it needs "to be within the confines of Israeli territory […] Is that necessary, or can you sort of slip that area down into Egypt?"&lt;ref name="BG.greatest-hits"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Carson's greatest hits|url=https://www.bostonglobe.com/opinion/2015/11/10/ben-carson-greatest-hits/SaqH3vxmJpxPpxNuk38SaI/story.html|work=Boston Globe|accessdate=November 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Withdrawal from campaign ===
On March 2, following the [[Super Tuesday, 2016]] primaries, Carson announced that he did "not see a political path forward" and would not attend the next Republican debate in Detroit.&lt;ref name="BTerrisWashPst03022016" /&gt; He said, "this grassroots movement on behalf of 'We the People' will continue," indicating that he would give more details later in the week.&lt;ref name="BTerrisWashPst03022016" /&gt; He suspended his campaign on March 4 and announced he would be the new national chairman of My Faith Votes, a group that encourages Christians to exercise their civic duty to vote.&lt;ref name="BTerrisWashPst03022016" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TKopanCNN03042016" /&gt;

In total, Ben Carson's campaign spent $58 million. However, most of the money went to political consultants and fundraising rather than advertising. Carson questioned whether his campaign was economically sabotaged from within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newschannel10.com/story/31384698/10-things-to-know-for-today|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160305082912/http://www.newschannel10.com/story/31384698/10-things-to-know-for-today|dead-url=yes|archive-date=March 5, 2016|title=10 Things to Know for Today|website=www.newschannel10.com|access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/03/ben-carson-presidential-campaign-end/471948/|title=Ben Carson Accepts That His Campaign Is Finished|last=Graham|first=David A.|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2016/02/ben-carson-thinks-maybe-his-campaign-was-a-scam/470715/|title=Ben Carson Suspects His Campaign Was a Scam|last=Graham|first=David A.|website=The Atlantic|language=en-US|access-date=March 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Further activities during 2016 election ===
On March 11, 2016, a week after Carson ended his presidential campaign, he endorsed Trump, calling him part of "the voice of the people to be heard."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/03/11/politics/ben-carson-endorses-donald-trump/|title=Ben Carson endorses Donald Trump|date=March 11, 2016|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson's subsequent comments that Americans would only have to sustain Trump for four years if he was not a good president drew criticism and he admitted that he would have preferred another candidate though thought Trump had the best chance of winning the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ben-carson-donald-trump-only-four-years_us_56e7974ae4b0b25c91831fa3|title=Ben Carson's Endorsement Of Donald Trump Just Got Even Stranger|date=March 15, 2016|publisher=Huffington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;
On the other hand, at the press conference Carson stated that Trump had a "cerebral" side.&lt;ref name="washingtonpost.com" /&gt;

On April 16, Carson spoke favorably of the possibility of abolishing the [[Electoral College (United States)|Electoral College]], believing it disregards "the will of the people".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newsmax.com/Politics/Ben-Carson-Electoral-College/2016/04/16/id/724294/|title=Ben Carson: Gid Rid of Electoral College|date=April 16, 2016|publisher=newsmax.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, on April 25, Carson expressed opposition to [[Harriet Tubman]] replacing [[Andrew Jackson]] on the [[United States twenty-dollar bill|$20 bill]], the day after dubbing the replacement "political expediency", though he indicated interest in Tubman having another tribute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mediaite.com/online/ben-carson-harriet-tubman-would-be-turning-over-in-her-grave-if-she-knew-she-were-on-20/|title=Ben Carson: Harriet Tubman Would Be 'Turning Over in Her Grave' If She Knew She Was on $20|date=April 26, 2016|publisher=mediaite.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late April, Carson wrote to the [[Nevada Republican Party]], requesting the two delegates he won in [[Nevada]] be released and free to support whoever they want.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/03/politics/ben-carson-nevada-delegates-released/|title=Ben Carson releases Nevada delegates|date=May 3, 2016|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 4, after Trump wrapped up the Republican nomination, he hinted that Carson would be among those who would vet his vice-presidential pick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/politics/first-draft/2016/05/04/donald-trump-discusses-how-hell-select-a-running-mate/?_r=0 |publisher=New York Times |title=First Draft: Donald Trump Discusses How He'll Select a Running Mate |date=May 4, 2016 |access-date=May 4, 2016|author=Maggie Haberman|author2=Ashley Parker|author-link=Maggie Haberman|last-author-amp=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; The same day, Carson in an interview expressed interest in [[Ted Cruz]] serving as [[Attorney General of the United States]], a position that Carson said would allow Cruz to prosecute [[Hillary Clinton]], and then as a [[Supreme Court Justice]] nominee from the Trump administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/2016-gop-primary-live-updates-and-results/2016/05/ben-carson-ted-cruz-attorney-general-clinton-222814|title=Carson floats Cruz as attorney general to go after Clinton|date=May 4, 2016|publisher=POLITICO}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 6, Carson said in interview that Trump would consider a Democrat as his running mate, conflicting with Trump's asserting that he would not. A Carson spokesperson later said Carson expected Trump to select a Republican.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/06/politics/ben-carson-donald-trump-vice-president-democrat/|title=Ben Carson at odds with campaign over Trump considering Democratic VP|first=Julia|last=Manchester|date=May 6, 2016|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Carson was said by aide Armstrong Williams in a May 10 interview to have withdrawn from the Trump campaign's vetting team, though the campaign confirmed he was still involved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/10/politics/ben-carson-armstrong-williams-vice-president/|title=Despite reports to the contrary, Ben Carson still advising Trump on possible VPs|date=May 10, 2016|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that month, Carson revealed a list of potential vice-presidential candidates in an interview with the [[Washington Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessinsider.com/ben-carson-donald-trump-vice-president-2016-5|title=Ben Carson spilled the beans on Donald Trump's possible vice-presidential picks|date=May 16, 2016|publisher=Business Insider}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 16, Carson said the media could not keep opinion out of reporting and cited [[Walter Cronkite]] as a fair journalist that was in his words a "left-wing radical."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/05/16/politics/ben-carson-walter-cronkite-left-wing-radical/|title=Ben Carson: Walter Cronkite was 'left-wing radical' but fair|date=May 16, 2016|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[2016 Republican National Convention|Republican National Convention]], Carson appeared with former New York City Mayor [[Rudy Giuliani]] in support of the pro-Donald Trump [[Great America PAC]] at an event in Cleveland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2016/07/21/politics/donald-trump-super-pac-convention/index.html|title=Trump super PACs battle in Cleveland|last=CNN|first=Theodore Schleifer|website=CNN|access-date=July 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Secretary of Housing and Urban Development==

===Nomination and confirmation===
After Donald Trump's win in the 2016 election, Carson joined [[Presidential transition of Donald Trump|Trump's transition team]] as Vice Chairman. Carson was also offered a cabinet position in the administration. He declined, in part because of his lack of experience, with an aide stating, "The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency."&lt;ref name=Hill&gt;{{cite web|last1=Kamisar|first1=Ben|title=Carson not interested in serving in Trump administration|url=http://thehill.com/policy/healthcare/306045-carson-turned-down-offer-to-serve-in-trump-administration-report|website=The Hill|accessdate=November 17, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it was reported that the position was for [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]], Carson's business manager has disputed this, stating, "Dr. Carson was never offered a specific position, but everything was open to him."&lt;ref name=Hill/&gt; He was eventually offered the position of [[Secretary of Housing and Urban Development]], which he accepted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/307292-carson-ive-been-offered-job-at-hud |title=Carson: I've been offered job at HUD |last=Easley |first=Jonathan |date=November 22, 2016 |work=The Hill|last2=Hagen |first2=Lisa |publication-date=November 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 5, 2016, Trump announced that he would nominate Carson to the position of Secretary of Housing and Urban Development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/wp/2016/12/05/trump-to-nominate-carson-to-lead-u-s-housing-urban-policy/ |title=

On January 24, 2017, the [[United States Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs|Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs]] voted unanimously to approve the nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Warmbrodt|first1=Zachary|title=Banking Committee approves Ben Carson nomination|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2017/01/ben-carson-hud-senate-banking-committee-approves-234103|accessdate=25 January 2017|newspaper=Politico|date=24 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 2, 2017, Carson was confirmed by the Senate by a 58-41 vote.&lt;ref name="AlcindorConfirmed"/&gt;

===Tenure===
On March 6, his first day as secretary, while addressing Housing and Urban Development (HUD) employees, Carson saluted the work ethic of immigrants, and during his comments appeared to compare [[Slavery in the United States|slaves]] to voluntary immigrants. A HUD spokesman said that no one present thought Carson "was equating voluntary immigration with involuntary servitude."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/2017/03/06/politics/ben-carson-immigrants-slavery/index.html|title=Carson: 'There were other immigrants who came in the bottom of slave ships, who worked even longer, even harder, for less'|first=Dan|last=Merica|date=March 6, 2017|publisher=CNN}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same speech, Carson inaccurately said that the [[human brain]] "was incapable of forgetting and could be [[Transcranial direct-current stimulation|electrically stimulated]] into [[perfect recall]]."&lt;ref&gt;Ben Guarino.

What?], ''Washington Post'' (March 7, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

Under the federal budget proposed by Trump in 2017, HUD's budget for fiscal year 2018 would be cut by $6.2 billion (13%) and the [[Community Development Block Grant]], a program which Carson praised in a trip to Detroit as HUD secretary, would be eliminated.&lt;ref name="Guillen"&gt;Joe Guillen, [http://www.freep.com/story/news/local/michigan/detroit/2017/03/16/ben-carson-trump-budget-detroit/99270206/ Ben Carson won't commit to restoring any Detroit cuts], ''Detroit Free Press'' (March 16, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Diana Olick, [https://www.cnbc.com/2017/03/16/hud-sec-ben-carson-champions-program-trump-budget-aims-to-kill.html HUD Sec Ben Carson champions program Trump budget aims to kill], CNBC (March 16, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Carson issued a statement supporting the proposed cuts.&lt;ref&gt;Ben Lane, [http://www.housingwire.com/articles/39603-heres-what-ben-carson-thinks-about-the-proposed-62-billion-hud-budget-cut Here's what Ben Carson thinks about the proposed $6.2 billion HUD budget cut], ''HousingWire'' (March 20, 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; Carson suggested that federal funds for housing in Detroit could be part of an expected infrastructure bill.&lt;ref name="Guillen"/&gt;

On April 2017, while speaking in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] at the National Low Income Housing Coalition conference, Carson said that housing funding would be included in an upcoming infrastructure bill from the Trump administration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2017/04/03/carson-assures-advocates-that-white-house-will-include-housing-funding-in-infrastructure-bill/|title=Carson assures advocates that White House will include housing funding in infrastructure bill|date=April 3, 2017|first=Jose A.|last=DelReal|newspaper=Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2017, during his keynote address at the LeadingAge Florida annual convention, Carson stated his concern about "seniors who become destitute" and reported that the Department of Housing and Urban Development had increased public housing programs for the elderly by an unspecified number.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.orlandosentinel.com/news/politics/political-pulse/os-ben-carson-keynote-20170713-story.html|title=Ben Carson warns of senior housing crisis in Florida, U.S.|first=Steven|last=Lemongello|newspaper=Orlando Sentinel|date=July 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer 2017, Carson allowed his son, a Baltimore businessman Ben Carson Jr., to participate in organizing a HUD "listening tour" in Baltimore.  Internal documents obtained by the ''Washington Post'' under the [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] showed that the younger Carson "put people he'd invited in touch with his father's deputies, joined agency staff on official conference calls about the listening tour and copied his wife on related email exchanges."&lt;ref name="EilperinGillum"&gt;Juliet Eilperin &amp; Jack Gillum, [https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/using-his-position-for-private-gain-hud-lawyers-warned-ben-carson-risked-running-afoul-of-ethics-rules-by-enlisting-son/2018/01/31/bb20c48e-0532-11e8-8777-2a059f168dd2_story.html 'Using his position for private gain': Ben Carson was warned he might run afoul of ethics rules by enlisting his son], ''Washington Post'' (January 31, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; The son's involvement prompted HUD  staff to express concern; the  department's deputy general counsel for operations wrote in a memorandum "that this gave the appearance that the Secretary may be using his position for his son's private gain."&lt;ref name="EilperinGillum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Fritze, [http://www.baltimoresun.com/news/maryland/politics/bs-md-carson-hud-family-20180131-story.html Ben Carson was cautioned son's involvement at HUD created appearance of a conflict, report says], ''Baltimore Sun'' (January 31, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt; Carson's wife, son, and daughter-in-law also attended official meetings.&lt;ref name="EilperinGillum"/&gt; In February 2018, the HUD [[Office of Inspector General (United States)|inspector general's office]] confirmed that it was looking into the role that Carson's family played at the department.&lt;ref&gt;Jeremy Diamond, [https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/20/politics/ben-carson-family-hud-investigation/index.html HUD inspector general looking into role Ben Carson's family has played], CNN (February 20, 2018).&lt;/ref&gt;

====Office furnishing====

Carson received criticism for spending up to $31,000 on a dining set in his office in late 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Glenn Thrush|newspaper=New York Times |title=Ben Carson's HUD, Planning Cuts, Spends $31,000 on Dining Set for His Office |date=February 27, 2018 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/27/us/ben-carson-hud-furniture.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was discovered after Helen Foster, a career HUD official, filed a complaint alleging that she was demoted from her position because she refused to spend more than the legal $5,000 limit for office redecorations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Rene Marsh|publisher=CNN|title=HUD staffer files complaint over Ben Carson office redecoration|date=February 27, 2018 |url=https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/27/politics/ben-carson-office-furniture-whistleblower/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Carson and his spokesman said that he had little or no involvement in the purchase of the dining set; later, email communications revealed that Carson and his wife selected the dining set.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/03/14/politics/emails-ben-candy-carson-dining-set/index.html|title=Emails show Ben, Candy Carson selected $31,000 dining set|last=CNN|first=Rene Marsh and Gregory Wallace,|work=CNN|access-date=2018-03-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; On March 20, 2018, Carson testified before the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations]] that he had "dismissed" himself from the decision to buy the $31,000 dining room set and "left it to my wife, you know, to choose something."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Glenn Thrush|newspaper=New York Times |title=Ben Carson Defends Buying $31,000 Dining Set to Congress: 'I Left It to My Wife'

== Carson Scholars Fund ==
In 1994, Carson and his wife started the Carson Scholars Fund, which awards scholarships to students in grades 4–11 for "academic excellence and humanitarian qualities".&lt;ref name=CSF /&gt;

Recipients of the Carson Scholars Fund receive a $1,000 scholarship towards their college education.

In keeping with his Seventh-day Adventist faith, Carson announced in 2014 his belief "that the United States will play a big role" in the coming apocalypse. He went on to say, "I hope by that time I'm not around anymore."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.motherjones.com/politics/2015/09/ben-carson-sabbath-persecution-satan-conspiracy|title=Ben Carson and the Satanic Sabbath persecution conspiracy|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an interview with [[Katie Couric]], Carson said that Jesus Christ came to Earth to redeem the world through his atoning sacrifice and that all people are sinners and need his redemption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Couric|first1=Katie|title=Ben Carson to Katie Couric on Jesus painting and rap ad|url=http://katiecouric.com/|website=Katie Couric dot Com|publisher=Yahoo!|accessdate=November 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson has stated he does not believe in hell as understood by some Christians: "You know, I see God as a very loving individual. And why would he torment somebody forever who only had a life of 60 or 70 or 80 years? Even if they were evil. Even if they were only evil for 80 years?". This is fully in line with Adventist teaching, which promotes [[annihilationism]].&lt;ref name="annih"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/12/01/why-ben-carson-doesnt-believe-in-hell/|title=Why Ben Carson doesn't believe in hell}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Carson endorsed [[Seventh-day Adventist theology]], which includes belief in a [[Biblical literalism|literal reading]] of the first chapters of [[Book of Genesis|Genesis]].&lt;ref name="KraussNewYorker"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krauss|first1=Lawrence|title=Ben Carson's Scientific Ignorance|url=http://www.newyorker.com/news/news-desk/ben-carsons-scientific-ignorance|publisher=The New Yorker|accessdate=October 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2013 interview with ''[[Adventist News Network]]'', Carson said "You know, I'm proud of the fact that I believe what God has said, and I've said many times that I'll defend it before anyone. If they want to criticize the fact that I believe in a literal, six-day creation, let's have at it because I will poke all kinds of holes in what they believe."&lt;ref name=ANN_chat&gt;[http://news.adventist.org/en/all-news/news/go/2013-04-05/church-chat-carson-handles-spotlight-prayerfully-humbly/ Church Chat: Carson handles spotlight ‘prayerfully, humbly’], ''[[Adventist News Network]]'', April 5, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Carson's Adventism was raised as an issue by his then-primary rival [[Donald Trump]].&lt;ref name="trumpsda"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/post-politics/wp/2015/10/25/donald-trump-no-apology-for-questioning-ben-carsons-seventh-day-adventist-faith/|title=Donald Trump: No apology for questioning Ben Carson's Seventh-day Adventist faith}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some Adventists have argued that Carson's political positions on [[Gun politics in the United States|gun rights]] and [[Freedom of religion|religious liberty]] conflict with historic Adventist teachings in favor of nonviolence, pacifism, and the [[separation of church and state]].&lt;ref name="SDA_caution" /&gt;&lt;ref name="gunadventist"&gt;{{cite web|author=Sarah Posner|url=http://religiondispatches.org/on-guns-and-religious-liberty-ben-carson-leaves-fellow-adventists-mystified/|title=On Guns and Religious Liberty, Ben Carson "Not an Authentic Adventist"|date=October 12, 2015|magazine=[[Religion Dispatches]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vegetarianism ===
Consistent with the practice of many Adventists, Carson is a lacto-ovo [[vegetarianism|vegetarian]] (he will eat dishes containing milk, eggs, or cheese, and occasionally, poultry).&lt;ref name=Hopkinson2015&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hopkinson|first1=Jenny|title=House poised for action on COOL — Senate readies to take a swing at WOTUS — Ben Carson: The vegetarian option|url=http://www.politico.com/tipsheets/morning-agriculture/2015/05/house-poised-for-action-on-cool-senate-readies-to-take-a-swing-at-wotus-ben-carson-the-vegetarian-option-212543|website=Politico|publisher=POLITICO LLC|accessdate=October 31, 2015|date=May 14, 2015|quote=Carson's spokesman said that Carson is a "lacto-ovo vegetarian, meaning he will eat dishes with milk, eggs or cheese, and occasionally (but not preferably) chicken.

But eventually there will no longer be a reason for most people to eat meat. And animals will breathe a sigh of relief."&lt;ref name=Kim1990 /&gt; To avoid causing others discomfort, he is willing to occasionally eat chicken or turkey, although he finds eating pork highly unpleasant.&lt;ref name=Carson1999 /&gt;

The '''anti-asylum movement''' or '''anti-asylum fight''' (Portuguese: ''movimento antimanicomial'') is an organized movement in [[Brazil]] consisting of psychiatrists, psychologists and social workers requesting a [[humanitarian]] improvement in psychiatrist public services.  University campuses, hospitals and workers of the field promote events in order to raise awareness and fight [[discrimination]] against mental patients.

== Origins ==
The movement itself was born after a chain of worldwide political events and is celebrated on May 18 in Brazil. On May 18, 1987 about 350 employees of [[Mental Health]] reunited in the Brazilian city of [[Bauru]], [[São Paulo (state)|state of São Paulo]] in order to discuss and propose ways to change the archaic and inefficient Mental Health System in the country.

In its roots, the movement is connected to the Reforma Sanitária Brasileira (''Brazilian Sanitary Reform'') whose outcome was the [[Sistema Único de Saúde]] (SUS) (''"Unified Health System"''). It's also related to [[deinstitutionalisation]] of Psychiatry developed in the cities of [[Gorizia]] and [[Trieste]] in [[Italy]], by Italian psychiatrist [[Franco Basaglia]] in the 1960s.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20010421200922/http://www.enxurrada.com.br/pompeu3.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Goals ==

As part of its decorrent movement, Psychiatric Reform took place under Law 10216 of 2011 (''Lei Paulo Delgado'') seeking reformulation of the current model adopted by Mental Asylums, changing the focus of the treatment whose from systematic hospitalization to a more [[Psychosocial]] approach, including community and open services. According to the Brazilian Anti-Asylum Movement, public healthcare and mental health is a political and social complex process, composed by participants, institutions and actions of different sources taking place in many territories. It's a conjuncture of transformations in practices, knowledge, cultural and social values whose responsibility belongs not only to the hospital but also the government and people in interpersonal relationships. Therefore, the treatment is supposed to be held in a community base and the patients shall be given protection and receive proper treatment according to the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]].

Their agenda aims a change in the belief that mental disorders are treated solely with medications and institutionalization. It launches a campaign against the [[prejudice]] and discrimination faced by patients, whose identity and  virtues are often ignored in the process, giving then importance to [[psychotherapy]] and dialogue, distancing those placed under care from stressful environments while integrating them with family, friends and significant others. Anti-asylum movement is also responsible for the privilege given to stable patients to have freedom to transit in and out the institution while sleeping in their own homes.

== Results ==

The conditions of mental health in Brazil improved slightly, as the Psychiatric Institutionalization is still not over and many hospitals across the country still haven't adapted themselves to the new regent laws.  A considerable amount of asylums were transformed into ''Centers of Psychosocial Attention'' ([[Brazilian Portuguese]]: ''"'''Centros de Atenção Psicossocial'''", simply known as "'''CAPS'''"'')

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4137">'''[[Cardiac disease]] in [[China]]''' is on the rise. Though incidences of [[heart disease]] have increased faster in the city than in the countryside, rural [[morbidity]] and [[Mortality rate|mortality]] rates are now on the rise as well. Health statistics shows that the [[ischemic heart disease]] mortality rate in rural China has approximately doubled since 1988.&lt;ref name="chinacal"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080516045910/http://www.chinacal.org/cardiac_disease.html Cardiac Disease and Health Care in China] China-California Heart Watch&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike in developed countries, there is no [[preventive medicine|preventive]] or [[primary health care]] system in place to stop the rise of cardiac disease.&lt;ref name="chinacal"/&gt; The real extent of heart disease in rural China is unknown because statistics are fraught with error and bias due to difficulties in ascertaining [[cause of death]] in places where 90% die without seeing a doctor. Therefore, there is a need to ascertain the real incidence and prevalence of heart disease and to develop adequate preventive and primary care in the Chinese countryside.&lt;ref name="chinacal"/&gt;

'''Chandra Theertham''' is the temple tank of [[Karaikal Ammayar Temple]], [[Nithyakalyana Perumal Temple, Karaikal|Nithyakalyana Perumal Temple]] and the [[Karaikal Kailasanathar Temple]]. The Karaikal float festival (Theppam) celebrated in this temple tank.

==History and Beliefs==
[[File:Chandra Theertham karaikal.jpg|thumb|Temple tank]]
The belief of the Karaikal people is if we bath once in this temple tank, all the bone related diseases and fractures will get cured. The Chandra Theertham is cleaned for long time and the work got completed in the year 2010.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.templeadvisor.com/temples/info/11064&lt;/ref&gt;

==Karaikal Floating Festival==
[[File:Theppam Karaikal.jpg|thumb|Theppam Festival or Float Festival]]
In 2010 the Karaikal Floating festival was held after 30 years. This was due to the help of the local MLA and former Health minister Mr.[[A.M.H.Nazeem]]. It was celebrated in a grand manner. After that continuously, for every year a Float festival was started to held. The theppam will move in this [[Temple tank]], rounding three times. People of [[Karaikal]] and nearby towns gather in the Chandra Theertham during this festival.&lt;ref&gt;indiancolumbus.blogspot.com/2016/04/karaikal.html&lt;/ref&gt;This Floating festival is celebrated either for the Nithyakalyana Perumal or Karaikal Kailasanathar.

'''Climarice''' is a research project, carried out by The Norwegian Institute for Agricultural and Environmental Research ([[Bioforsk]], Norway), [[Tamil Nadu Agricultural University]] (TNAU, India), [[International Water Management Institute]] (IWMI, India) and [[International Pacific Research Center]] (IPRC, United States); which is trying to assess the impact of climate variability on [[water]] availability and [[rice]] production in the [[Kaveri River|Cauvery river basin]] of [[Tamil Nadu]], India.

In particular, the impacts of [[climate change]] on extreme events such as [[droughts]], [[floods]], [[heat waves]] and on the spatial and temporal distribution of the [[monsoon]] rains will certainly impact rice production and [[food security]] in India. However, there is a significant level of uncertainty in the [[climate models]]' projections that cascade into impact models and thereby influence policy decisions related to adaptation. For both scientific community and policy makers, reducing the uncertainties is a big challenge. On a positive note, examination of historical observed rice production data in India shows an overall increasing trend in many regions with annual fluctuations. Will this trend continue given the projected change in climate and population increase in India?

Climarice is funded by the [[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], is currently assessing the impacts of climate change on rice production areas and rice productivity.  Specifically, the project is assessing the behavior of the Indian monsoon in different climate scenarios, and examining its impact on the water availability, rice crop production and the resultant socio economic vulnerability and adaptation of farming communities in the [[Cauvery river]] basin, India. Since the project was started in January 2008, relevant coping and adaptation mechanisms have been identified and techniques developed to address the issues of climate vulnerabilities in rice production.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2105">'''Dislocation of hip''' (coxofemoral luxation) may occur '''in domestic animals'''.

It is a not rare condition, usually unilateral, in:
* cattle, among others, after calving.
* dogs, resulting from trauma or as a complication of [[Hip dysplasia (canine)|hip dysplasia]].

The same illness also exists in [[dislocation of hip|human medicine]].

The condition can be observed after the forced traction of fetus while delivery, slip of animal on a floor. 
More commonly seen in animals with poor nutrient ration at end stage of gestation which results in osteoporosis of bones &amp; joints due go which acetabulum notch become shallow and femur comes out if it while delivery, ketonemia also has adverse effect on coxo-femoral luxation

==Symptoms==
In dogs, it occurs mainly in an upwards and forwards direction. Hence, the affected leg is shortened, and the [[greater trochanter]] prominent.

In cattle, it occurs mainly craniodorsally or caudoventrally, but other directions are possible. A typical stance is seen in craniodorsal luxations, with a shortened limb, and a protrusion of greater trochanter.

==Treatment==
Attempts in reduction in cattle are generally not successful. Affected animals, at least not too heavy ones, can live with the disease for a long time because of the formation of a sort of pseudo-joint in the hip.

Dogs with hip dysplasia and unilateral dislocation can live if the other leg is not too severely hit. Then there is a severe muscular atrophy of the  thigh. Compensation occurs with musculation of the shoulders.

In 2011, the Pedestrian Council of Australia launched a campaign called "Never Let a Mate Walk Home Drunk", in an effort to curb the high number of pedestrians killed on Australian roads. 20% of pedestrians killed on Australian roads have a BAC exceeding 0.05%,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.walk.com.au/pedestriancouncil/page.asp|title = Pedestrian Council of Australia|date = 2015|accessdate = 2015-04-13|website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and 30% of those killed or seriously injured have a BAC over 0.08%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = The Stats {{!}} MAC|url = http://www.mac.sa.gov.au/the-stats|website = www.mac.sa.gov.au|accessdate = 2015-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fall in bed bug populations after the 1930s in the developed world is believed to be partly due to the usage of [[DDT]] to kill [[cockroach]]es,&lt;ref name=Nurse09/&gt; which are a natural predator of the bed bug.

==Developed world==
Bed bugs are increasing in Europe, USA, Canada and Australia. The infestations have been occurring in a wide range of facilities in the developed world in recent years including: hotels (from backpacker to five star), overnight trains, private homes, cruise ships, schools, hospitals and homeless shelters.&lt;ref name=Heu09/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nurse09&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Krause-Parello CA, Sciscione P |title=Bedbugs: an equal opportunist and cosmopolitan creature |journal=J Sch Nurs |volume=25 |issue=2 |pages=126–32 |date=April 2009|pmid=19233933 |doi=10.1177/1059840509331438 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; These infestations are occasionally of both types of bed bugs (common and tropical).&lt;ref name=Heu09/&gt; The increased rates of infestations have been matched by increased media coverage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Anderson AL, Leffler K |title=Bedbug infestations in the news: a picture of an emerging public health problem in the United States |journal=J Environ Health |volume=70 |issue=9 |pages=24–7, 52–3 |date=May 2008 |pmid=18517150 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pest management companies have also seen a many fold increase in calls regarding bed bugs during the 2000s.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bonnefoy|Kampen|Sweeney|2008|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
Figures from one [[London]] borough show reported bed bug infestations doubling each year from 1995 to 2001. There is also evidence of a previous cycle of bed bug infestations in the U.K. in the mid-1980s.&lt;ref name="king"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=King, F |author2=Dick, I |author3=Evans, P. |title=Bed bugs in Britain. |journal=Parasitology Today |volume=5 |issue=4 |pages=100–2 |year=1989 |quote=In the period 1985–1986, the Institution of Environmental Health Officers reported treating 7,771 infestations in England and Wales, and 6,179 infestations in 1986–1987. There were also reports of infestations in [[Belfast]] and in [[Scotland]]. |doi=10.1016/0169-4758(89)90045-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the increase of infestation in UK was estimated to be around 24%.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bedbugsremovalguide.com/bed-bug-bites.html&lt;/ref&gt;{{Unreliable source?|date=November 2015}} In the hot summer of 2018 it was reported that bedbug infestations had been increasing year-on-year in UK cities since 2006, with no sign of levelling off. This was considered likely to be due to increased temperatures. Bedbugs were commonly found in seats on London buses and [[London Underground|Tube]] trains.&lt;ref name=obs18au18&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/aug/19/bedbugs-heatwave-sparks-plage-pest-infestation |title=Bedbugs plague hits British cities |newspaper=The Observer|date=19 August 2018  |author= |accessdate= 19 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
Bed bugs have been reported in all 50 states.&lt;ref name=Heu09/&gt; The U.S. [[National Pest Management Association]] reported a 71% increase in bed bug calls between 2000 and 2005.&lt;ref name="voiland"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Voiland, Adam |title=You May not be Alone |journal=U.S. News &amp; World Report |volume=143 |issue=2 |pages=53–54 |date=16 July 2007 |url=http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/070708/16bedbug.htm |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111107010535/http://health.usnews.com/usnews/health/articles/070708/16bedbug.htm |archivedate=7 November 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Steritech Group, a pest-management company based in [[Charlotte]], [[North Carolina]], claimed that 25% of the 700 hotels they surveyed between 2002 and 2006 needed bed bug treatment. The resurgence led the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] to hold a National Bed Bug Summit in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/ppdc/bedbug-summit/ |title=National Bed Bug Summit |accessdate=2009-04-22 |work=United States Environmental Protection Agency |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105054628/http://www.epa.gov/pesticides/ppdc/bedbug-summit/ |archivedate=5 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Numbers of reported incidents in [[New York City]] rose from 500 in 2004 to 10,000 in 2009 mostly in Brooklyn area.&lt;ref name=nytakeover&gt;{{cite news | url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2010/08/19/are-bedbugs-taking-over-new-york-city/| title=Are Bedbugs Taking Over New York City? | author=Megan Gibson | work=Time Magazine | date=19 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Brooklyn [http://www.brooklynpestcontrolservices.com/ bed bug exterminator] website&lt;/ref&gt; In August, 2010, bed bugs were found in the Elle Fashion Hachette building in New York City. After suspected infestation, a beagle trained in sniffing bed bugs was used to confirm their presence. Office workers were told to work from home while the building was being treated. Although largely thought to only cause problems in less maintained and dirty environments, there is an increasing incidence of bed bugs for infesting indoor environments of high maintenance standards.&lt;ref&gt;New York Fashion. Elle has bedbugs! 20 Aug 2010. http://nymag.com/daily/fashion/2010/08/elle_has_bedbugs_1.html#comments&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;O’Reilly, Kelly. New York NBC. Elle Offices Closed for Bedbugs. 20 Aug 2012. http://www.nbcnewyork.com/blogs/threadny/THREAD-Confirmed-Elle-Offices-Closed-for-Bed-Bugs-101153694.html&lt;/ref&gt;

One recent theory about bed bug reappearance is that they never truly disappeared from the United States, but may have been forced to alternative hosts. Consistent with this is the finding the bed bug DNA shows no evidence of an evolutionary bottleneck. Furthermore, investigators have found high populations of bed bugs at poultry facilities in [[Arkansas]]. Poultry workers at these facilities may be spreading bed bugs, unknowingly carrying them to their places of residence and elsewhere after leaving work.&lt;ref name="urban"&gt;{{cite web

===Canada===

Bed bug infestations have been becoming an increasing issue in urban environments. In a Toronto, Canada study, the mean number of treatments required per affected location was highest at dormitories, hotels, homeless shelters, and rooming houses. Suspected reasons for this increase include increasing world travel, high exchange rates of residents, reluctance to use insecticides because of concerns regarding toxicity, and [[insecticide resistance]]. 65 Toronto homeless shelters were surveyed and 31% reported past or present bed bug infestations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hwang SW, Svoboda TJ, De Jong IJ, Kabasele KJ, Gogosis E |title=Bed bug infestations in an urban environment |journal=Emerging Infect.

==Developing world==
Bed bugs have historically been only a particular problem in developed countries in which they occur both in rural settings and urban setting associated with overcrowding.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

[[President of the United States]] [[George W. Bush]] signed the '''Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007''' (FDAAA) on September 27, 2007. This law reviewed, expanded, and reaffirmed several existing pieces of [[legislation]] regulating the FDA. These changes allow the FDA to perform more comprehensive reviews of potential new drugs and devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/initiatives/advance/fdaaa.html|title=Law Strengthens FDA&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sponsored by Reps. [[Joe Barton]] and [[Frank Pallone]] and passed unanimously by the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/3580/cosponsors|title=Cosponsors - H.R.3580 - 110th Congress (2007-2008): Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007|first=Dingell,|last=John|date=27 September 2007|website=www.congress.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The FDAAA extended the authority to levy fees to companies applying for approval of drugs, expanded clinical trial guidelines for pediatric drugs, and created the [[priority review voucher]] program. 

== Title I: Prescription Drug User Fee Amendments of 2007 ==
{{main | Prescription Drug User Fee Act}}

Title I amends the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] to include post-marketing safety activities in the review of drug application. This included developing and using improved adverse event data collection systems and improved analytical tools to assess potential safety problems and conducting screenings of the [[Adverse Event Reporting System]] database and reporting on new safety concerns.

It also reauthorizes the [[Prescription Drug User Fee Act]]. The PFUDA was first enacted in 1992 to allow the FDA to collect application fees from [[pharmaceutical companies]] when applying for approval for a drug. Since then, it has been reauthorized three times; first in 1997, then 2002, and most recently with the passage of the FDAAA in 2007. The purpose of these fees is to provide resources to the FDA that help them more effectively review potential new drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bio.org/healthcare/pdufa/|title=BIO - The Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most recent reauthorization will further expand on the previous policy. It aims to broaden and upgrade the  [[Pharmacovigilance|drug safety]] program, allocate more resources for [[Television advertisement|television advertising]], and theoretically allow the FDA to more efficiently review and approve safe and effective new drugs for consumers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/oc/pdufa/|title=Prescription Drug User Fee Act (PDUFA)|first=Office of the Commissioner,Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research,Center for Drug Evaluation and|last=Research|website=www.fda.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It requires the FDA, through the authority of the [[Secretary of Health and Human Services]] to provide a partial refund of an applicant's user fees if the application is withdrawn without a waiver before filing.

It sets forth special rules for [[positron emission tomography]] drugs, including subjecting an applicant in a drug application for a PET drug to one-sixth of the annual prescription drug establishment fee.

It exempts approved drugs or biological products designated for a rare disease ([[orphan drugs]]) from product and establishment fees if certain requirements are met, including that the drug is owned/licensed and marketed by a company having gross worldwide revenues that fall below a certain amount.&lt;ref name=FDA&gt;https://www.congress.gov/bill/110th-congress/house-bill/3580 {{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Title II: Medical Device User Fee Amendments of 2007 ==
Title II is given the [[short title]] of "Medical Device User Fee Amendments" (MDUFA). It defines terms relating to fees for medical devices. "30-day notice" is defined as a notice of a supplement to an approved application that is limited to a request to make modifications to manufacturing procedures or methods affecting the safety and effectiveness of the device.

It makes changes to medical device fees, including establishing a fee for a 30-day notice, a request for classification information, and periodic reporting for a class III device.

It extends the authority of accredited people (third parties) to review premarket reports for devices and make recommendations to the FDA regarding the classification of devices.

It requires any establishment in a foreign country engaged in the manufacturing or processing of a drug or device that is imported into the US to annually register with the FDA.&lt;ref name=FDA/&gt;

== Title III: Pediatric Medical Device Safety and Improvement Act of 2007 ==
Title III requires applications for a humanitarian device exemption, an application for premarket approval of a medical device, or a product development protocol for a medical device to include, if available, a description of any pediatric subpopulations that suffer from the disease that the device is intended for, and the number of affected pediatric patients.

It requires the FDA to submit an annual report to congressional committees that includes: (1) the number of devices approved in the preceding year for which there is a pediatric subpopulation that suffers from the disease; (2) the number of approved devices labeled for use in pediatric patients; (3) the number of fee-exempt devices approved; and (4) the review time for each approved device.

It authorizes the FDA to determine that adult data on medical devices may be used to support claims of effectiveness in pediatric populations if the course of the disease and the effects of the device are sufficiently similar in adults and pediatric patients.

It excludes a person granted a humanitarian device exemption from the prohibition against selling the device for an amount that exceeds its research and development, fabrication, and distribution costs if: (1) the device is intended to treat or diagnose a disease or condition that occurs in pediatric patients; (2) the device was not approved for pediatric patients prior to enactment of this Act; (3) the number of devices distributed does not exceed an annual distribution number specified by the Secretary; and (4) the request for exemption is submitted on or before October 1, 2012.&lt;ref name=FDA/&gt;

== Title IV: Pediatric Research Equity Act of 2007 ==
Title IV requires an applicant seeking to defer submission of some or all pediatric assessments of the safety and effectiveness of a new drug or biological product to submit to the FDA a timeline for the completion of pediatric studies. It also sets forth annual reporting requirements for an applicant following the approval of such a deferral.

It requires that an applicant seeking waiver of pediatric assessment submission requirements on the grounds that a pediatric formulation cannot be developed, to submit documentation detailing why a pediatric formulation cannot be developed. It also authorizes the FDA to require submission of a pediatric assessment if the Secretary finds that adequate pediatric labeling could confer a benefit on pediatric patients or the absence of adequate pediatric labeling could pose a significant risk to pediatric patients.&lt;ref name=FDA/&gt;

== Title V: Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act of 2007 ==
Title V has the short title "[[Best Pharmaceuticals for Children Act]]". 

It amends the [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]] to revise provisions regarding market exclusivity for pediatric drug studies on new or already approved drugs, including to change the definition of "pediatric studies" to authorize the Secretary to include preclinical studies, to require the studies to be completed using appropriate formulations for each age group for which such a study is requested, and to prohibit the FDA from extending the period of market exclusivity later than nine months prior to the expiration of the period.

It requires an applicant that does not agree to the request for a pediatric study to submit to the Secretary the reasons such pediatric formulations cannot be developed, and requires an applicant that agrees to the request to provide the Secretary with all post-marketing adverse event reports regarding the drug.

It directs the FDA to: (1) publish a notice identifying any drug for which a pediatric formulation was developed, studied, and found to be safe and effective in the pediatric population if the pediatric formulation is not introduced onto the market within one year after the determination regarding market exclusivity; (2) utilize the internal review committee to review all written requests for pediatric studies issued; (3) track and make publicly available information on the pediatric studies conducted; (4) order the labeling of a product to include information about the results of the study and a statement that a pediatric study does or does not demonstrate that the drug is safe and effective in pediatric populations; and (5) ensure that all adverse event reports that have been received for a drug are referred to the Office of Pediatric Therapeutics. It prescribes actions for the FDA to take if pediatric studies have not been completed and there is a continuing need for information relating to the use of the drug in the pediatric population.

It requires the pediatric subcommittee of the Oncologic Drugs Advisory Committee to provide recommendations to the internal review committee that reviews pediatric research requests with respect to the treatment of pediatric cancer.&lt;ref name=FDA/&gt;

The [[Pediatric Trials Network]] serves as the mechanism by which many studies on off-patent drugs are performed, in keeping with the BPCA objective of ensuring accurate drug labeling for children.

== Title VI: Reagan-Udall Foundation ==
Title VI establishes the [[Reagan-Udall Foundation]] for the Food and Drug Administration as a [[nonprofit]] corporation to advance the mission of the FDA to modernize product development, accelerate innovation, and enhance product safety. It requires the Foundation to: (1) identify unmet needs in the development, manufacture, and evaluation of the safety and effectiveness of such products; (2) establish goals and priorities; (3) identify federal research and development programs and minimize duplication; (4) award grants to scientists and entities to efficiently and effectively advance such goals and priorities; and (5) provide objective clinical and scientific information to the FDA and other federal agencies. 

It requires the FDA to establish an Office of the Chief Scientist to: (1) oversee, coordinate, and ensure quality and regulatory focus of FDA intramural research programs; (2) track and coordinate intramural research awards made by each FDA center or science-based office; (3) develop and advocate for a budget to support intramural research; (4) develop a peer review process by which intramural research can be evaluated; (5) identify and solicit intramural research proposals from across the FDA; and (6) develop additional post-marketing safety performance measures.&lt;ref name=FDA/&gt;

== Title VII: Conflicts of Interest ==
Title VII places limits on who can serve on an FDA advisory committee. It directs the FDA to implement strategies on effective outreach to potential members of advisory committees and to review the expertise and financial disclosure report of an individual when considering an appointment to an advisory committee. It prohibits any member of an advisory committee from participating with respect to any matter in which the member has a financial interest, unless the member is granted a waiver in order to afford the advisory committee essential expertise. The number of waivers is limited and decreases as a percentage of committee members over several years.&lt;ref name=FDA/&gt;

== Title VIII: Clinical Trials Databases ==
Title VIII is in regard to [[clinicaltrials.gov]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov/fdaaa.html|title=PRS Information: U.S. Public Law 110-85|website=prsinfo.clinicaltrials.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; It amends the [[Public Health Service Act]] to require the FDA, acting through the Director of NIH, to expand the clinical trials registry data bank. It requires the Director to ensure that the data bank is made publicly available through the Internet and requires the FDA to ensure that the data bank includes links to results information for those clinical trials that form the primary basis of an efficacy claim or are conducted after the drug or device involved is approved or cleared.&lt;ref name=FDA/&gt;

== Title IX: Enhanced Authorities Regarding Postmarket Safety of Drugs ==
Title IX prohibits a "responsible person" from introducing into interstate commerce a new drug, if the person is in violation of a requirement related to post-approval clinical trials or labeling changes.

It authorizes the FDA to require a responsible person for a drug to conduct a post-approval study or clinical trial of the drug to assess a known serious risk or signals of a serious risk or to identify an unexpected serious risk, to require a postapproval study or clinical trial for an already approved drug only if the Secretary becomes aware of new safety information, and to issue an order directing a responsible person or holder of an approved application to make a labeling change to address new safety information.

It prohibits a person from introducing into interstate commerce a new drug or biological product for which a risk evaluation and mitigation strategy is required if the person fails to maintain compliance with the requirements of such strategy.

It requires a proposed risk evaluation and management strategy to include a timetable for assessment of the strategy and allows the FDA to require such a strategy to include additional elements, including distribution to each patient of a Medication Guide and a patient package insert, a communication plan to health care providers, and assurances of safe use.

It establishes the [[Drug Safety Oversight Board]].

It authorizes the FDA to require the submission of any TV advertisement for a drug for review before it can be broadcast, to make recommendations with respect to information included in the label of the drug or on statements for inclusion in advertisements but not ''require'' changes in such advertisements, and to require inclusion in advertisements of certain disclosures about a serious risk listed in the labeling of the drug.

It requires the FDA to issue special guidance for clinical trials of [[antibiotics]]. 

It prohibits interstate commerce of any food that has an approved drug, licensed biological product, or certain other drugs or biological products added, unless the drug or biological product was marketed in food prior to approval, licensure, or clinical investigation, the FDA has approved the use of such drug or biological product in the food, or the use of the drug or the biological product is to enhance the safety or preservation of the food and not intended to have biological or therapeutic effects and the use is in conformity with specified regulations.

It requires the FDA to develop standards to secure the drug supply chain against counterfeit, diverted, substandard, adulterated, misbranded, or expired drugs, to prioritize and develop standards for the identification and validation of prescription drugs, to develop a standardized numerical identifier for prescription drugs, and to expand resources and facilities for securing the drug supply chain.

It requires the Advisory Committee on Risk Communication to regularly perform a comprehensive review of the types of risk information provided on the website and to recommend ways for the FDA to work with outside entities to help facilitate communication of risk.

It requires that certain information related to a [[new drug application]] be published on the FDA's website, including documents related to the review of an application and a summary of conclusions from all reviewing disciplines about the drug. It stipulates that a scientific review of an application is considered the work of the reviewer and prohibits the altering of such work by management or the reviewer once it is final.

It directs the FDA to publish and update quarterly a complete list of all authorized generic drugs on the FDA's website.&lt;ref name=FDA/&gt;

== Title X: Food Safety ==
Title X requires the FDA to work with companies, professional associations, and other organizations during an ongoing recall of food regulated by the FDA to collect and aggregate information, to use existing networks to enhance the quality and speed of public communication, and to post information regarding recalled food on the FDA's website in a single location.

It requires the FDA to work with states to assist in improving the safety of food. It requires a responsible person who determines that an article of food is a reportable food to submit a report to the FDA within 24 hours and to investigate the cause of the adulteration if the adulteration may have originated with the responsible person. It requires the FDA to immediately notify the Secretary of [[Homeland Security]] if the FDA believes food reported to the registry may have been deliberately adulterated. 

It requires the FDA to produce a report on any environmental risks associated with genetically engineered seafood products and sets forth reporting requirements with respect to food products regulated by the FDA.&lt;ref name=FDA/&gt;

== Title XI: Other Provisions ==
Title XI requires the FDA to identify and periodically update clinically susceptible concentrations (specific values that characterize bacteria as clinically susceptible, intermediate, or resistant to the drug tested). 
It directs the FDA to convene a public meeting regarding which infectious diseases potentially qualify for available grants and contracts under the [[Orphan Drug Act]] or other incentives for development, and amends the Orphan Drug Act to reauthorize appropriations for grants and contracts to defray the costs of testing for the development of drugs, medical devices, and medical foods for rare diseases.

It allows an applicant for a non-[[racemic drug]] containing as an active ingredient a single [[enantiomer]] that is contained in a racemic drug approved in another application to elect to have the single enantiomer considered the same active ingredient as that contained in the approved racemic drug under certain circumstances.

It requires the HHS Secretary to enter into a contract with the [[Institute of Medicine]] to conduct a study to assess the overall safety and quality of genetic tests and prepare a report that includes recommendations to improve federal oversight and regulation of genetic tests.&lt;ref name=FDA/&gt;

===Priority review voucher program===
Title XI also created the [[priority review voucher]] program. This requires the FDA to award a transferable, priority review voucher to the sponsor of a tropical disease product application upon approval by the Secretary of such application and establish a priority review user fee program. In this Act, only tropical diseases were covered under this program to incentivize the development of neglected tropical diseases. In 2012, this was expanded to include rare pediatric conditions. As of 2017, 13 priority review vouchers have been awarded.

'''Food libel laws''', also known as '''food disparagement laws''' and informally as '''veggie libel laws''', are laws passed in thirteen [[United States|U.S.]] states that make it easier for food producers to sue their critics for [[libel]]. These thirteen states are [[Alabama]], [[Arizona]], [[Colorado]], [[Florida]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]], [[Idaho]], [[Louisiana]], [[Mississippi]], [[North Dakota]], [[Ohio]], [[Oklahoma]], [[South Dakota]] and [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cspinet.org/foodspeak/laws/existlaw.htm|title=Food-Disparagement Laws: State Civil &amp; Criminal Statutes|date=March 19, 1998|website=FoodSpeak|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160623065112/http://cspinet.org:80/foodspeak/laws/existlaw.htm|archivedate=June 23, 2016|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the food-disparagement laws establish a lower standard for civil liability and allow for punitive damages and attorney's fees for [[plaintiff]]s alone, regardless of the case's outcome.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cspinet.org/foodspeak/oped/candm.htm|title=Veggie-Libel Law Still Poses a Threat|author=Collins, Ronald|date=1998-03-23|accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws vary significantly from state to state, but food libel laws typically allow a food manufacturer or processor to sue a person or group who makes disparaging comments about their food products. In some states these laws also establish different standards of proof than are used in traditional American libel lawsuits, including the practice of placing the burden of proof on the party being sued.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Notable Cases==

=== Texas Beef Group v. Winfrey ===
In 1998, television talk-show host [[Oprah Winfrey]] and one of her guests, [[Howard Lyman]], were involved in a lawsuit, commonly referred to as the Amarillo Texas beef trial, surrounding the Texas version of a food libel law known as the ''False Disparagement of Perishable Food Products Act of 1995'', for a 1996 episode of her show in which the two made disparaging comments about beef in relation to [[mad cow disease]]. Although they were not the first people to be sued using this type of legal action, this case created a media sensation.

In a normal U.S. libel suit, the plaintiff must prove that the defendant is deliberately and knowingly spreading false information. Under the [[Texas]] food disparagement law under which Winfrey and Lyman were sued, the plaintiffs &amp;mdash; in this case, beef [[feedlot]] operator Paul Engler and the company Cactus Feeders &amp;mdash; had to convince the jury that Lyman's statements on Winfrey's show were not "based on reasonable and reliable scientific inquiry, facts, or data."&lt;ref&gt;V.T.C.A., Civil Practice &amp; Remedies Code § 96.003, accessible at http://www.statutes.legis.state.tx.us/Docs/CP/pdf/CP.96.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  As a basis for the damages sought in the lawsuit, the plaintiffs noted that cattle futures dropped 10 percent the day after the episode, and that beef prices fell from 62 cents to 55 cents per pound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mS38Lo5VVjMC&amp;pg=PA377&amp;lpg=PA377&amp;dq=%22veggie+libel+laws%22+global#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false|title=Business: its legal, ethical, and global environment|author=Jennings, Marianne M.|year=2005|page=377|accessdate=2009-12-28 | isbn=978-0-324-20488-9 | publisher=Cengage Learning}}&lt;/ref&gt; Engler's attorneys argued that the rancher lost $6.7 million, and the plaintiffs sought to recoup total losses of more than $12 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cnn.com/US/9801/20/oprah.update/|publisher=CNN|title=Court shares light moment during Oprah jury selection|date=1998-01-20|accessdate=2009-12-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The jury in the case found that the statements by Winfrey and Lyman did not constitute libel against the cattlemen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://medialibel.org/cases-conflicts/tv/oprah.html|publisher=MediaLibel.org|title=Texas Cattlemen v. Oprah Winfrey|accessdate=2009-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Winfrey no longer speaks publicly on the issue, going so far as to decline to make videotapes of the original interview available to enquiring journalists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |

===McDonald's Restaurants v. Morris &amp; Steel (McLibel Case)===
A long-running legal case in Britain is an example of the application of food libel principles to existing law.  ''[[McDonald's Restaurants v Morris &amp; Steel|McDonald's Restaurants versus Morris &amp; Steel]]'' (also known as the "McLibel case") was an [[England|English]] [[lawsuit]] filed by [[McDonald's|McDonald's Corporation]] against [[environmentalism|environmental]] activists Helen Steel and David Morris (often referred to as "The McLibel Two") over a pamphlet critical of the company. The original case lasted ten years, making it the longest-running court action in English history.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news  | title=McLibel pair get police payout | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/820786.stm | date=2000-07-05}} {{cite news  | title='McLibel' pair in fresh court bid | publisher=BBC | url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/3632944.stm | date=2004-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; A feature-length documentary film, ''[[McLibel (film)|McLibel]]'', was created about the case by filmmaker [[Franny Armstrong]].

Although McDonald's won two [[hearing (law)|hearings]] of the case in English court, the partial nature of the victory, the [[David and Goliath|David-vs-Goliath]] nature of the case, and the drawn-out litigation embarrassed the company. McDonald's announced that it did not plan to collect the £40,000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=McDonald's lets McLibel case rest | publisher=AP | url=http://chronicle.augusta.com/stories/071997/biz_mclibel.html | date=1997-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it was awarded by the courts.  Since then, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) has ruled that the trial violated Articles 6 (right to a fair trial) because the defendants had been refused legal aid and had only been represented by volunteer lawyers, and Article 10 (right to freedom of expression) of the [[European Convention on Human Rights|Convention on Human Rights]], again because the defendants had been refused legal aid, and awarded a judgment of £57,000 against the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;Press release issued by the Registrar. "[http://cmiskp.echr.coe.int/tkp197/view.asp?action=html&amp;documentId=801399&amp;portal=hbkm&amp;source=externalbydocnumber&amp;table=F69A27FD8FB86142BF01C1166DEA398649 Chamber Judgment Steel and Morris v. The United Kingdom]" The [[European Court of Human Rights]], 15 February 2005. Received 1 September 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; (McDonald's itself was not a defendant in this appeal.)  On February 15, 2005, the pair's 20-year battle with McDonald's came to an end with this judgment.

[[File:Fukushima I NPP 1975 medium crop rotated labeled.jpg|thumb|Satellite image of the [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] where the "Fukushima 50" were assigned to stabilize the six reactors at the plant]]

'''Fukushima 50''' is the [[pseudonym]] given by the media to a group of employees at the crippled [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]]. Following the [[2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami|Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami]] on 11 March 2011, a related [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|series of nuclear accidents]] resulted in melting of the cores of three reactors. These 50 employees remained on-site after 750 other workers were evacuated.&lt;ref name=Asahi /&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph.co.uk"&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/asia/japan/8408863/Japan-tsunami-Fukushima-Fifty-the-first-interview.html Japan tsunami: Fukushima Fifty, the first interview&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Tokyo Electric Power Company|TEPCO]] management proposed withdrawing all its employees from the plant on 14 March,&lt;ref&gt;http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110318p2a00m0na009000c.html {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110321030932/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110318p2a00m0na009000c.html# |date=21 March 2011 }} TEPCO wanted to withdraw all nuclear plant workers 3 days after quake&lt;/ref&gt; additional manpower was deployed from around Japan.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/31/world/asia/31workers.html?src=mv Workers Give Glimpse of Japan’s Nuclear Crisis&lt;/ref&gt; Some workers traveled on clear roads by convoy from Tokyo.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; When they arrived, hundreds of firemen, SDF personnel and employees of TEPCO, convened 20&amp;nbsp;km from the plant and debated how to best stabilize the plant.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt; On the night of 15 March, these workers joined the original Fukushima 50.

During some work, in high radiation areas, the workers were limited to 15-minute sessions inside the damaged buildings.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.foxnews.com/world/2011/03/31/japans-nuclear-rescuers-inevitable-die-weeks/ Japan's Nuclear Rescuers: 'Inevitable Some of Them May Die Within Weeks'&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radiation===
The international limit for radiation exposure for nuclear workers is 20 [[Sievert|millisievert]] (20&amp;nbsp;mSv, or 2 rem) per year, averaged over five years, with a limit of 50&amp;nbsp;mSv in any one year, however for workers performing emergency services [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) guidance on dose limits is 100&amp;nbsp;mSv when "protecting valuable property" and 250&amp;nbsp;mSv when the activity is "life saving or protection of large populations."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.epa.gov/rpdweb00/docs/er/400-r-92-001.pdf Table 2-2] [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the accident, the maximum permissible dose for Japanese nuclear workers was 100&amp;nbsp;mSv in any one year, but on 15 March 2011, the Japanese Health and Labor Ministry enforced the permitted 250&amp;nbsp;mSv limit, in light of the situation at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Plant.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |newspaper=[[The New York Times]] |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/03/16/world/asia/16workers.html |department=Asia |date=16 March 2011 |title=Last Defense at Troubled Reactors: 50 Japanese Workers |first1=Keith |last1=Bradsher |first2=Hiroko |last2=Tabuchi}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = NHK | place = JP | url = http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/16_19.html | title = Gov't ups permissible radiation level | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110317010034/http://www3.nhk.or.jp/daily/english/16_19.html | archivedate = 17 March 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the workers at Fukushima plant declined the elevated 250&amp;nbsp;mSv limit and kept adopting the previous 100&amp;nbsp;mSv.&lt;ref name=mainichi250Declined&gt;{{cite news|title=TEPCO tries to enclose high radiation in sea in nuke crisis|url=http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110410p2g00m0dm011000c.html|accessdate=10 April 2011|newspaper=[[Mainichi Shimbun]]|date=10 April 2011|location=JP|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110410215931/http://mdn.mainichi.jp/mdnnews/news/20110410p2g00m0dm011000c.html#|archive-date=10 April 2011|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tokyo Enesys, a TEPCO's subsidiary, adopts 80&amp;nbsp;mSv to manage the radiation level monitoring with some buffer.

==Explosions==

The Fukushima 50 were present when hydrogen explosions occurred at the reactor buildings of units 1, 3, and 4. Five workers were injured in the unit 1 explosion at 15:36 on 12 March. Most of the injuries were not severe. Eleven workers were injured in the unit 3 explosion at 11:01 on 14 March. The explosion at unit 4 at about 6am on 15 March did not cause injuries. The explosions scattered radioactive concrete debris around the buildings, which made the working conditions on the site more difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hasegawa|first=A.|last2=Ohira|first2=T.|last3=Maeda|first3=M.|last4=Yasumura|first4=S.|last5=Tanigawa|first5=K.|date=2016-04-01|title=Emergency Responses and Health Consequences after the Fukushima Accident; Evacuation and Relocation|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0936655516000054|journal=Clinical Oncology|language=en|volume=28|issue=4|pages=237–244|doi=10.1016/j.clon.2016.01.002|issn=0936-6555|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cas.go.jp/jp/seisaku/icanps/eng/120224Honbun02Eng.pdf|title=Interim report|last=|first=|date=26 December 2011|website=|publisher=Investigation Committee on the Accident at the Fukushima Nuclear Power Stations|pages=51-52|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Number of workers==

[[File:TFD-LP.jpg|thumb|right|Water tower vehicles from major fire departments were integral to the emergency cooling operations]]

Originally there were approximately 800 workers on 11 March 2011, the day the earthquake and tsunami struck. On 15 March, workers deemed non-essential were withdrawn by the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]].  A total of around 750 workers left due to increased risk and consequently left around 50. It was on this day that the media started to call the remaining workers the "Fukushima 50".

However, on the morning of the 16 March the remaining workers had to be evacuated for a brief period of time due to a radiation spike which was detected which could be harmful to the workers' health. It was reported that when they returned to the plant, a further 130 or so workers joined their colleagues to total of around 180 to stabilize the reactors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Winerman|first=Lea|title=The 'Fukushima 50': Nuclear Workers Stay Behind to Brave Plant's Woes|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/rundown/2011/03/nuclear-plant-workers-become-anonymous-faces-of-bravery.html|accessdate=16 March 2011|newspaper=PBS NewsHour}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of workers rose to 580 on the morning of the 18 March.&lt;ref name=Asahi /&gt; By 12 April, approximately 700 workers were working on-site.&lt;ref name="asahi.com"&gt;http://www.asahi.com/english/TKY201104110137.html Heroes and realists found among the brave "Fukushima 700"&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction of media and public==
Media outlets lauded the remaining workers' bravery, and called them "heroes", and as a result they have become known in the media as the "Fukushima 50". ''[[France 24]]'' called them "Japan's faceless heroes",&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Japan's faceless heroes |url=http://www.france24.com/en/20110316-fukushima-japan-nuclear-power-plant-reactors-fire-explosion-50-workers-survivors-death |publisher=France24 |date=16 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; British newspaper, ''[[The Guardian]]'' wrote: "Other nuclear power employees, as well as the wider population, can only look on in admiration".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title='Fukushima heroes' battle to tame nuclear plant as Japan watches |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2011/mar/16/fukushima-heroes-nuclear-japan-watches |work=The Guardian |location=UK |date=16 March 2011 |accessdate=16 March 2011 |first=Justin |last=McCurry}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have been compared to the [[Forty-seven Ronin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Japan aktuell: Die 50 von Fukushima – die modernen 47 Ronin? |url=http://www.spreadnews.de/japan-aktuell-die-50-von-fukushima-die-modernen-47-ronin/119578/ |work=Spreadnews.de |location=DE |date=19 March 2011 |accessdate=19 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Hong Kong, a group of netizens at [[HKGolden]] Forum dedicated Cantonese and Japanese lyrics based on a [[Cantopop]] song, entitled "福島烈士─向福島50人致敬" (''Martyr of Fukushima - Tribute to the Fukushima Fifty''), to the workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=港網民改歌向死士致敬 (''HK Netizens Recomposes a Song in Tribute to Martyrs'')|url=http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/template/apple/art_main.php?iss_id=20110322&amp;sec_id=4104&amp;art_id=15097111|work=hk.apple.nextmedia.com/ |location=HK |date=22 March 2011 |accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=向福島50人致敬！　港「高登音樂台」自唱自製MV (''Tribute to Fukushima 50!

According to Robert Hetkämper, a correspondent for the German television network [[ARD (broadcaster)|ARD]], the label "Fukushima 50" was invented by a foreign newspaper, and then was imported by the Japanese media. The "Fukushima 50" would include engineers as well as unskilled workers, and there would be grounds to suspect that many workers were not really aware of the dangers of their assignment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=ARD|title=Die "Fukushima 50" sind eine Legende|trans-title=The "Fukushima 50" are a legend|language=German|location=GER|date=23 March 2011|url=https://www.tagesschau.de/ausland/japanberichterstattung100.html|accessdate=23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Excess iron accumulates in tissues and organs disrupting their normal function. The most susceptible organs include the [[liver]], [[adrenal glands]], [[heart]], [[skin]], [[gonads]], [[joints]], and the [[pancreas]]; patients can present with [[cirrhosis]], [[polyarthropathy]], adrenal insufficiency, heart failure or [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name="Iron Overload and Hemochromatosis"&gt;[https://www.cdc.gov/ncbddd/hemochromatosis/ Iron Overload and Hemochromatosis] Centers for Disease Control and Prevention&lt;/ref&gt; 

The hereditary form of the disease is most common among those of Northern European ancestry, in particular those of [[Celt]]ic descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Celtic Curse |url=http://live.psu.edu/index.php?sec=vs&amp;story=10913&amp;pf=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The disease is inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern, which means both copies of the gene in each cell have mutations.&lt;ref name="hemochromatosis"&gt;{{cite web |title=hemochromatosis |url=http://ghr.nlm.nih.gov/condition/hemochromatosis }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most often, the parents of an individual with an autosomal recessive condition each carry one copy of the mutated gene, but do not show signs and symptoms of the condition.&lt;ref name="hemochromatosis"/&gt;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Haemochromatosis is [[wikt:protean|protean]] in its manifestations, ''i.e.'', often presenting with signs or symptoms suggestive of other diagnoses that affect specific organ systems. Many of the signs and symptoms below are uncommon and most patients with the hereditary form of haemochromatosis do not show any overt signs of disease nor do they suffer premature morbidity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://digestive.niddk.nih.gov/ddiseases/pubs/hemochromatosis/index.htm Hemochromatosis-Diagnosis] National Digestive Diseases Information Clearinghouse, National Institutes of Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/ref&gt;

Presently, the classic triad of cirrhosis, bronze skin and diabetes is less common because of earlier diagnosis.&lt;ref name="pmid15175440"/&gt;

Males are usually diagnosed after their forties and fifties, and women several decades later, owing to regular iron loss through [[menstruation]] (which ceases in [[menopause]]). The severity of clinical disease in the hereditary form varies considerably.  There is evidence suggesting that hereditary haemochromatosis patients affected with other liver ailments such as hepatitis or alcoholic liver disease suffer worse liver disease than those with either condition alone.  There are also juvenile forms of hereditary haemochromatosis that present in childhood with the same consequences of iron overload.

===End-organ damage===
Iron is stored in the liver, the pancreas and the heart. Long-term effects of haemochromatosis on these organs can be very serious, even fatal when untreated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hemochromatosis/DS00455/DSECTION=6 |title=Hemochromatosis: Complications |format= |work=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, similar to [[alcoholism]], haemochromatosis can cause [[cirrhosis]] of the [[liver]]. The liver is a primary storage area for iron and will naturally accumulate excess iron. Over time the liver is likely to be damaged by iron overload. Cirrhosis itself may lead to additional and more serious complications, including bleeding from dilated veins in the [[esophagus]] ([[esophageal varices]]) and [[stomach]] ([[gastric varices]]) and severe fluid retention in the [[abdomen]] ([[ascites]]). Toxins may accumulate in the blood and eventually affect mental functioning. This can lead to confusion or even [[coma]] (hepatic [[encephalopathy]]).

[[Liver]] [[cancer]]: Cirrhosis and haemochromatosis together will increase the risk of liver cancer. (Nearly one-third of people with haemochromatosis and cirrhosis eventually develop liver cancer.)

[[Diabetes]]: The [[pancreas]] which also stores iron is very important in the body’s mechanisms for sugar [[metabolism]]. Diabetes affects the way the body uses blood sugar ([[glucose]]). Diabetes is in turn the leading cause of new blindness in adults and may be involved in [[kidney failure]] and [[cardiovascular disease]].

[[Congestive heart failure]]: If excess iron in the heart interferes with the its ability to circulate enough blood, a number of problems can occur, even death. The condition may be reversible when haemochromatosis is treated and excess iron stores reduced.

[[Heart]] [[arrhythmias]]: Arrhythmia or abnormal heart rhythms can cause heart palpitations, chest pain and light-headedness and are occasionally life-threatening. This condition can often be reversed with treatment for haemochromatosis.

[[Pigment]] changes: Bronze or grey coloration of the skin is caused primarily by increased melanin deposition, with iron deposition playing a lesser role.&lt;ref name=Pedrup_1964&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Pedrup A, Poulsen H |title=Hemochromatosis and Vitiligo |journal=Archives of Dermatology |volume=90 |issue=1 |pages=34–37 |year=1964 |pmid=14149720 |doi=10.1001/archderm.1964.01600010040010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Genetics ==
The regulation of dietary iron absorption is complex and our understanding is incomplete. One of the better characterized genes responsible for hereditary haemochromatosis is [[HFE gene|HFE]]&lt;ref name="pmid18752323"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olynyk JK, Trinder D, Ramm GA, Britton RS, Bacon BR |title=Hereditary hemochromatosis in the post-HFE era |journal=Hepatology |volume=48 |issue=3 |pages=991–1001 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18752323 |doi=10.1002/hep.22507 |pmc=2548289 }}&lt;/ref&gt; on [[chromosome 6]], which codes for a protein that participates in the regulation of iron absorption. The [[HFE gene]] has two common mutations, C282Y and H63D.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hemochromatosis/DS00455/DSECTION=3 |title=Hemochromatosis: Causes |format= |work=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The C282Y allele is a [[Transition (genetics)|transition]] [[point mutation]] from [[guanine]] to [[adenine]] at nucleotide 845 in the HFE gene, resulting in a [[missense mutation]] that replaces the [[cysteine]] residue at position 282 with a [[tyrosine]] amino acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal=Nature Genetics |title=A novel MHC class I-like gene is mutated in patients with hereditary haemochromatosis |volume=13 |issue=4 |pages=399–408 |year=1996 |pmid=8696333 |doi=10.1038/ng0896-399 |url=  |vauthors=Feder JN, Gnirke A, Thomas W, etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; Heterozygotes for either allele do not manifest clinical iron overload but may display an increased iron uptake.

[[Mutation]]s of the HFE [[gene]] account for 90% of the cases of non-transfusional iron overload. This gene is closely [[genetic linkage|linked]] to the [[Human leukocyte antigen|HLA-A3]] [[Locus (genetics)|locus]]. [[Homozygosity]] for the C282Y [[mutation]] is the most common genotype responsible for clinical iron accumulation, though [[heterozygosity]] for C282Y/H63D mutations, so-called [[compound heterozygotes]], results in clinically evident iron overload. There is considerable debate regarding the [[penetrance]]—the probability of clinical expression of the trait given the genotype— for clinical disease in homozygotes. Most, if not all, males homozygous for HFE C282Y will show manifestations of liver dysfunction such as elevated liver-specific enzymes such as serum gamma glutamyltransferase (GGT) by late middle age. Homozygous females can delay the onset of iron accumulation because of iron loss through menstruation.

Each patient with the susceptible genotype accumulates iron at different rates depending on iron intake, the exact nature of the mutation, and the presence of other insults to the liver such as alcohol and viral disease. As such the degree to which the liver and other organs is affected is highly variable and is dependent on these factors and co-morbidities as well as age at which they are studied for manifestations of disease.&lt;ref name=Olynwk_1999/&gt; Penetrance differs between populations.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Iron metabolism.svg|thumb|400px|The normal distribution of body iron stores]]

Since the regulation of [[iron]] metabolism is still poorly understood, a clear model of how haemochromatosis operates is still not available. A working model describes the defect in the [[HFE gene]], where a mutation puts the intestinal absorption of iron into overdrive. Normally, HFE facilitates the binding of [[transferrin]], which is iron's carrier protein in the blood. Transferrin levels are typically elevated at times of iron depletion (low [[ferritin]] stimulates the release of transferrin from the liver). When transferrin is high, HFE works to increase the intestinal release of iron into the blood. When HFE is mutated, the intestines perpetually interpret a strong transferrin signal as if the body were deficient in iron. This leads to maximal iron absorption from ingested foods and iron overload in the tissues. However, HFE is only part of the story, since many patients with mutated HFE do not manifest clinical iron overload, and some patients with iron overload have a normal HFE [[genotype]]. A possible explanation is the fact that HFE normally plays a role in the production of [[hepcidin]] in the liver, a function that is impaired in HFE mutations.&lt;ref name="pmid18249176"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Vujić Spasić M, Kiss J, Herrmann T, etal |title=Hfe acts in hepatocytes to prevent hemochromatosis |journal=Cell Metab. |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=173–8 |year=2008 |pmid=18249176 |doi=10.1016/j.cmet.2007.11.014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

People with abnormal iron regulatory genes do not reduce their absorption of iron in response to increased iron levels in the body.  Thus the iron stores of the body increase.  As they increase, the iron which is initially stored as ferritin is deposited in organs as [[haemosiderin]] and this is [[toxic]] to [[biological tissue|tissue]], probably at least partially by inducing [[oxidative stress]].&lt;ref name=Shizukuda_2007&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Shizukuda Y, Bolan C, Nguyen T, Botello G, Tripodi D, Yau Y, Waclawiw M, Leitman S, Rosing D |title=Oxidative stress in asymptomatic subjects with hereditary hemochromatosis |journal=Am J Hematol |volume=82 |issue=3 |pages=249–50 |year=2007 |pmid=16955456 |doi=10.1002/ajh.20743}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Iron is a [[pro-oxidant]].   Thus, haemochromatosis shares common symptomology (e.g., cirrhosis and dyskinetic symptoms) with other "pro-oxidant" diseases such as [[Wilson's disease]], chronic [[manganese poisoning]], and hyperuricaemic syndrome in [[Dalmatian dogs]].   The latter also experience "bronzing".

== Diagnosis ==
The diagnosis of haemochromatosis is often made following the incidental finding on routine blood screening of elevated serum liver enzymes or elevation of the transferrin saturation. Arthropathy with stiff joints, diabetes, or fatigue, may be the presenting complaint.&lt;ref name=Mayo&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hemochromatosis/DS00455/DSECTION=tests-and-diagnosis |title=Hemochromatosis: Tests and diagnosis |format= |work=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) |accessdate=2009-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Blood tests===
[[Serum transferrin]] and [[transferrin saturation]] are commonly used as screening for haemochromatosis. [[Transferrin]] binds iron and is responsible for iron transport in the blood.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sickle.bwh.harvard.edu/iron_transport.html Transferrin and Iron Transport Physiology]&lt;/ref&gt; Measuring transferrin provides a crude measure of iron stores in the body. Fasting transferrin saturation values in excess of 45% for males or 35% in premenopausal women (i.e. 300&amp;nbsp;ng/L in males and 200&amp;nbsp;ng/L in females) are recognized as a threshold for further evaluation of haemochromatosis.&lt;ref name="pmid15175440"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pietrangelo A |title=Hereditary hemochromatosis—a new look at an old disease |journal=N.

'''Serum Ferritin''': [[Ferritin]], a protein synthesized by the liver is the primary form of iron storage within cells and tissues.  Measuring ferritin provides another crude estimate of whole body iron stores though many conditions, particularly inflammation (but also chronic alcohol consumption, non-alcoholic fatty liver disease and others), can elevate serum ferritin - which can account for up to 90% of cases where elevated levels are observed.&lt;ref name="austpre01" /&gt; Normal values for males are 12–300&amp;nbsp;ng/ml (nanograms per millilitre) and for female, 12–150&amp;nbsp;ng/ml.&lt;ref name=Mayo/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{MedlinePlusEncyclopedia|003490|Ferritin Test}} Measuring iron in the body&lt;/ref&gt; Serum ferritin in excess of 1000 nanograms per millilitre of blood is almost always attributable to haemochromatosis.

Other blood tests routinely performed: [[blood count]], [[renal function]], [[liver enzyme]]s, [[electrolyte]]s, [[glucose]] (and/or an [[oral glucose tolerance test]] (OGTT)).

===Liver biopsy===
[[File:Hemochromatosis liver iron prussian blue.jpg|thumb|Iron accumulation demonstrated by [[Prussian blue]] staining in a patient with homozygous genetic haemochromatosis (microscopy, 10x magnified). Parts of normal pink tissue are scarcely present.]]
[[Liver biopsy|Liver biopsies]] involve taking a sample of tissue from the liver, using a thin needle. The amount of iron in the sample is then quantified and compared to normal, and evidence of liver damage, especially [[cirrhosis]], measured microscopically. Formerly, this was the only way to confirm a diagnosis of haemochromatosis but measures of transferrin and ferritin along with a history are considered adequate in determining the presence of the malady. Risks of biopsy include bruising, bleeding and infection. Now, when a history and measures of transferrin or ferritin point to haemochromatosis, it is debatable whether a liver biopsy is still necessary to quantify the amount of accumulated iron.&lt;ref name=Mayo/&gt;

===MRI===
MRI-based testing is a non-invasive and accurate alternative to measure liver iron concentrations.&lt;ref name="pmid15256427"&gt;{{cite journal |author=St Pierre |title=Non-invasive measurement and imaging of liver iron concentrations using proton magnetic resonance |journal=Blood. |volume=105 |pages=855–61 |year=2005 |pmid=15256427 |doi=10.1182/blood-2004-01-0177 |url= |issue=2 |last2=Clark |first2=PR |last3=Chua-Anusorn |first3=W |last4=Fleming |first4=AJ |last5=Jeffrey |first5=GP |last6=Olynyk |first6=JK |last7=Pootrakul |first7=P |last8=Robins |first8=E |last9=Lindeman |first9=R }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other imaging===
Clinically the disease may be silent, but characteristic radiological features may point to the diagnosis.  The increased iron stores in the organs involved, especially in the liver and pancreas, result in characteristic findings on unenhanced [[Computed axial tomography|CT]] and a decreased signal intensity in [[Magnetic resonance imaging|MRI scans]]. Haemochromatosis [[arthropathy]] includes degenerative [[osteoarthritis]] and [[Pseudogout|chondrocalcinosis]]. The distribution of the [[arthropathy]] is distinctive, but not unique, frequently affecting the second and third metacarpophalangeal joints of the hand.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}  The [[arthropathy]] can therefore be an early clue as to the diagnosis of haemochromatosis.

===Functional testing===
Based on the history, the [[physician|doctor]] might consider specific tests to monitor organ dysfunction, such as an [[echocardiogram]] for [[heart failure]], or blood glucose monitoring for patients with haemochromatosis [[diabetes]].

===Differential diagnosis===
There exist other causes of excess iron accumulation, which have to be considered before haemochromatosis is diagnosed.
* [[African iron overload]], formerly known as Bantu siderosis, was first observed among people of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] descent in [[Southern Africa]]. Originally, this was blamed on [[galvanisation|ungalvanised]] barrels used to store home-made beer, which led to increased oxidation and increased iron levels in the [[beer]]. Further investigation has shown that only some people drinking this sort of beer get an iron overload syndrome, and that a similar syndrome occurred in people of [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African]] descent who have had no contact with this kind of [[beer]] (''e.g.,'' [[African Americans]]). This led investigators to the discovery of a gene [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]] in the gene for [[ferroportin]] which predisposes some people of African descent to iron overload.&lt;ref name=Gordeuk_2003&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Gordeuk V, Caleffi A, Corradini E, Ferrara F, Jones R, Castro O, Onyekwere O, Kittles R, Pignatti E, Montosi G, Garuti C, Gangaidzo I, Gomo Z, Moyo V, Rouault T, MacPhail P, Pietrangelo A |title=Iron overload in Africans and African-Americans and a common mutation in the SCL40A1 (ferroportin 1) gene |journal=Blood Cells Mol Dis |volume=31 |issue=3 |pages=299–304 |year=2003 |pmid=14636642 |doi=10.1016/S1079-9796(03)00164-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Transfusion hemosiderosis|Transfusion haemosiderosis]] is the accumulation of iron, mainly in the [[liver]], in patients who receive frequent [[blood transfusion]]s (such as those with [[thalassemia|thalassaemia]]).
* Dyserythropoeisis, also known as [[myelodysplastic syndrome]], is a disorder in the production of red blood cells. This leads to increased iron recycling from the [[bone marrow]] and accumulation in the liver.

== Screening ==
Standard diagnostic measures for haemochromatosis, [[transferrin saturation]] and [[ferritin]] tests, are not a part of routine medical testing.  [[Screening (medicine)|Screening]] for haemochromatosis is recommended if the patient has a parent, child or sibling with the disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Summaries for patients. Screening for hereditary hemochromatosis: recommendations from the American College of Physicians |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=143 |issue=7 |pages=I-46 |year=2005 |pmid=16204158 |doi= 10.7326/0003-4819-143-7-200510040-00004|url=http://www.annals.org/cgi/content/full/143/7/I-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Routine screening of the general population for hereditary haemochromatosis is generally not done. Mass genetic screening has been evaluated by the [[U.S. Preventive Services Task Force]] (USPSTF), among other groups.  The USPSTF recommended against genetic screening of the general population for hereditary haemochromatosis because the likelihood of discovering an undiagnosed patient with clinically relevant iron overload is less than 1 in 1,000.  Although there is strong evidence that treatment of iron overload can save lives in patients with transfusional iron overload, no clinical study has shown that for asymptomatic carriers of hereditary haemochromatosis treatment with venesection  ([[phlebotomy]]) provides any clinical benefit.&lt;ref name="pmid16880462"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Screening for haemochromatosis: recommendation statement |journal=Ann. Intern. Med. |volume=145 |issue=3 |pages=204–8 |year=2006 |pmid=16880462 |doi= 10.7326/0003-4819-145-3-200608010-00008|author1= U.S. Preventive Services Task Force}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ahrq.gov/clinic/uspstf/uspshemoch.htm Screening for Hemochromatosis] U.S. Preventive Services Task Force (2006). Summary of Screening Recommendations and Supporting Documents.  Retrieved 18 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Recently, it has been suggested that patients be screened for iron overload using serum ferritin as a marker: If serum ferritin exceeds 1000&amp;nbsp;ng/mL, iron overload is very likely the cause.

== Treatment ==

===Phlebotomy===
Early diagnosis is vital as the late effects of iron accumulation can be wholly prevented by periodic [[Venipuncture|phlebotomies]] (by venesection) comparable in volume to [[blood donation]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mayoclinic.com/health/hemochromatosis/DS00455/DSECTION=7 |title=Hemochromatosis: Treatments and drugs |format= |work=Mayo Foundation for Medical Education and Research (MFMER) |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initiation of treatment is recommended when [[ferritin]] levels reach 500 micrograms per litre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=EASL clinical practice guidelines for HFE hemochromatosis|doi=10.1016/j.jhep.2010.03.001|pmid=20471131|url=http://www.journal-of-hepatology.eu/article/S0168-8278%2810%2900197-2/abstract?cc=y= | volume=53|issue=1|journal=Journal of Hepatology|pages=3–22|year=2010|author1=European Association For The Study Of The Liver.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Phlebotomy (or [[bloodletting]]) is usually done at a weekly interval until [[ferritin]] levels are less than 50 micrograms per litre. In order to prevent iron reaccumulation, subsequent phlebotomies are normally carried out approximately once every three to four months for males, and twice a year for females.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kowdley|first1=KV|last2=Bennett|first2=RL|last3=Motulsky|first3=AG|last4=Pagon|first4=RA|last5=Adam|first5=MP|last6=Ardinger|first6=HH|last7=Wallace|first7=SE|last8=Amemiya|first8=A|last9=Bean|first9=LJH|last10=Bird|first10=TD|last11=Dolan|first11=CR|last12=Fong|first12=CT|last13=Smith|first13=RJH|last14=Stephens|first14=K|title=''HFE''-Associated Hereditary Hemochromatosis|date=1993|pmid=20301613|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK1440/|accessdate=25 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Desferrioxamine mesilate===
Where venesection is not possible, long-term administration of [[Deferoxamine|desferrioxamine mesylate]] is useful. Desferrioxamine is an iron-chelating compound, and excretion induced by desferrioxamine is enhanced by administration of Vitamin C. It cannot be used during pregnancy or breast-feeding due to risk of defects in the child.{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Organ damage===
* Treatment of organ damage ([[heart failure]] with [[diuretic]]s and [[ACE inhibitor]] therapy).{{citation needed|date=May 2015}}

===Diet===
* Limiting intake of [[alcoholic beverage]]s, [[vitamin C]] (increases iron absorption in the gut), red [[meat]] (high in [[iron]]) and potential causes of food poisoning ([[shellfish]], [[seafood]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Plaut|first1=David|last2=McLellan|first2=William|title=Hereditary hemochromatosis|journal=Journal of Continuing Education Topics &amp; Issues|date=2009|volume=11|issue=1|url=http://www.freepatentsonline.com/article/Journal-Continuing-Education-Topics-Issues/193344102.html|accessdate=11 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Increasing intake of substances that inhibit iron absorption, such as high-[[tannin]] [[tea]], [[Calcium in biology|calcium]], and foods containing [[Oxalic acid|oxalic]] and [[phytic acid]]s (such as [[collard greens]], which must be consumed at the same time as the iron-containing foods in order to be effective).&lt;ref&gt;http://dynaweb.ebscohost.com/Detail.aspx?id=116469&amp;sid=14aa79e5-a881-407c-94e7-339b81c4cd18@sessionmgr3{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} accessed October 15, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prognosis ==
Studies indicate that persons with symptomatic haemochromatosis have somewhat reduced life expectancy compared to the general population. This is mainly due to excess mortality from cirrhosis and liver cancer. Patients who were treated with phlebotomy lived longer than those who weren't.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Niederau|first=Claus|last2=Fischer|first2=Rudolf|last3=Sonnenberg|first3=Amnon|last4=Stremmel|first4=Wolfgang|last5=Trampisch|first5=Hans J.|last6=Strohmeyer|first6=Georg|date=1985-11-14|title=Survival and Causes of Death in Cirrhotic and in Noncirrhotic Patients with Primary Hemochromatosis|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJM198511143132004|journal=New England Journal of Medicine|volume=313|issue=20|pages=1256–1262|doi=10.1056/NEJM198511143132004|issn=0028-4793|pmid=4058506}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bokhoven|first=M.

== Epidemiology ==
Haemochromatosis is one of the most common heritable genetic conditions in people of northern European extraction with a prevalence of 1 in 200. The disease has a variable penetration and about 1 in 10 people of this demographic carry a mutation in one of the [[genes]] regulating [[iron]] [[metabolism]], the most common allele being the C282Y allele in the [[HFE (gene)|''HFE'' gene]].&lt;ref name="pmid18762941"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Mendes AI, Ferro A, Martins R, etal |title=Non-classical hereditary hemochromatosis in Portugal: novel mutations identified in iron metabolism-related genes |journal=Ann. Hematol. |volume=88 |issue=3 |pages=229–34 |date=March 2009 |pmid=18762941 |doi=10.1007/s00277-008-0572-y }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[prevalence]] of mutations in iron metabolism genes varies in different populations.  A study of 3,011 unrelated white Australians found that 14% were [[heterozygous]] carriers of an HFE mutation, 0.5% were [[homozygous]] for an ''HFE'' mutation, and only 0.25% of the study population had clinically relevant iron overload.  Most patients who are [[homozygous]] for HFE mutations will not manifest clinically relevant haemochromatosis (see Genetics above).&lt;ref name=Olynwk_1999&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Olynyk J, Cullen D, Aquilia S, Rossi E, Summerville L, Powell L |title=A population-based study of the clinical expression of the hemochromatosis gene |journal=N Engl J Med |volume=341 |issue=10 |pages=718–24 |year=1999 |pmid=10471457 |doi=10.1056/NEJM199909023411002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other populations have a lower prevalence of both the genetic mutation and the clinical disease.

[[Genetics|Genetic]] studies suggest the original haemochromatosis [[mutation]] arose in a single person, possibly of [[Celt]]ic ethnicity, who lived 60–70 generations ago.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scripps.edu/bcmd/pdfarea/issue_20_98/lucotte.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-01-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081202181211/http://www.scripps.edu/bcmd/pdfarea/issue_20_98/lucotte.pdf |archivedate=2008-12-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time when dietary iron may have been scarcer than today, the presence of the [[mutant allele]] may have provided an [[evolution]]ary or [[natural selection]] reproductive advantage by maintaining higher [[iron]] levels in the blood.

==Terminology==
The term "haemochromatosis" is used by different sources in many different ways.

It is often used to imply an association with the [[HFE (gene)|HFE gene]]. For many years, HFE was the only known gene associated with haemochromatosis, and the term "hereditary haemochromatosis" was used to describe haemochromatosis type 1. However, it is now known that there are many different genetic associations with this condition. The older the text, or the more general the audience, the more likely that HFE is implied.

"Haemochromatosis" has also been used in contexts where there had not been a known genetic cause for iron accumulation. In some cases, however, a condition that was thought to be due to diet or environment was later linked to a genetic polymorphism, as in [[African iron overload]].

== History ==
The disease was first described in 1865 by [[Armand Trousseau]] in a report on [[diabetes mellitus|diabetes]] in patients presenting with a bronze pigmentation of their skin.&lt;ref name=Trousseau_1865&gt;{{cite journal | author = Trousseau A| title = Glycosurie, diabète sucré | journal = Clinique médicale de l'Hôtel-Dieu de Paris | year = 1865 | volume = 2| pages = 663–98 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trousseau did not associate [[diabetes]] with [[iron]] accumulation; the recognition that infiltration of the pancreas with iron might disrupt endocrine function resulting in diabetes was made by [[Friedrich Daniel von Recklinghausen]] in 1890.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = von Recklinghausen FD | title = Hämochromatose | journal = Tageblatt der Naturforschenden Versammlung 1889 | year = 1890 | pages = 324 | url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whonamedit.com/doctor.cfm/1174.html Biography of Daniel von Recklinghausen]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4973">The '''India State Hunger Index''' ('''ISHI''') is a tool to calculate [[hunger]] and [[malnutrition]] at the regional level in [[India]]. It is constructed in the same fashion as the [[Global Hunger Index]] (GHI) 2008 and was calculated for 17 states in India, covering more than 95 percent of the population. 

The ISHI was developed by the [[International Food Policy Research Institute]] (IFPRI) and presented for the first time 2008 in conjunction with the [[Non-Governmental Organization]] [[Welthungerhilfe]] and the Department of Economics, [[University of California]].

== Background ==

Despite the good economic performance, with over 200 million people who are [[food security|food insecure]], India is home to the largest number of hungry people in the world. In the ranking of the [[Global Hunger Index]] 2017 it covers position 100 out of 119 ranked countries and has an “serious“ (31.4) [[food security]] situation.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ifpri.org/sites/default/files/publications/ishi08.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The major problem in the country is the high prevalence of [[underweight]] children under five, which is a result of low nutrition and educational status of women. 

While there has been attention to hunger and [[undernourishment]] at the central level, within India's political system, states are important political units with regard to the planning and execution of development programs. Thus unpacking the hunger index at the level of the  federal states is an important tool to build awareness of the disparities in hunger among them. In addition, the variability of the relative contribution of the underlying components of the hunger index across the different Indian states can help to stimulate the discussion about the drivers of hunger in different state contexts.

==Indicators and underlying data==

The ISHI is constructed in the same fashion as the [[Global Hunger Index]] which follows a multidimensional approach to measuring hunger and [[malnutrition]]. It combines three equally weighted indicators:

# the proportion of undernourished as a percentage of the population (reflecting the share of the population with insufficient dietary intake);
# the prevalence of [[underweight]] children under the age of five (indicating the proportion of children suffering from weight loss and / or reduced growth); and 
# the [[child mortality|mortality rate of children]] under the age of five (partially reflecting the fatal synergy between dietary intake and unhealthy environments).

The ISHI uses two data sources for the estimation of the Indian state level: These are the first rounds of the National Family Health Survey (2005–2006) for India and the National Sample Survey data from 2004 to 2005. It is calculated and presented for 17 major states, covering 95 percent of the country's population. While the National Family Health Survey has a large enough sample size to yield representative estimates of the child [[underweight]] and mortality rates even for the smaller states and union territories in the country, the sample size of the National Sample Survey is insufficient for estimating undernourishment rates in these places. Therefore, the ISHI restricts the sample to those states for which it yields precise states level estimates.

== Key findings ==

*ISHI 2008 scores for Indian states range from 13.6 (“serious”) for [[Punjab, India|Punjab]] to 30.9 (“extremely alarming”) for [[Madhya Pradesh]], indicating substantial variability among states in India. Punjab is ranked 34th when compared to the GHI 2008 worldwide country ranking, while Madhya Pradesh is ranked 82nd. In this state more people suffer from hunger than in Ethiopia or Sudan. 60 percent of the children are undernourished.
*All 17 states have ISHI scores that are well above the “low” and “moderate” hunger categories. Twelve of the 17 states fall into the “alarming” category, and one into the “extremely alarming” category.
*ISHI scores are closely aligned with poverty, but there is little association with state level economic growth. High levels of hunger are seen in states that are performing well from an economic perspective.
*Inclusive economic growth and targeted strategies to ensure food sufficiency reduce child mortality and improve child nutrition are urgent priorities for all states in India.

=== North America ===

==== Canada ====
'''Prince Edward Island''', a province within Canada is the only instance of a province-wide attempt at implementing the HL7 interoperability standard. It has been standards compliant with the following characteristics of HL7:

* (CeRx) Messaging Standard (HL7 v3).
* Standards Collaborative through HL7 Canada.
* Set of 78 messages.
* Deemed “Stable for Use” in Canada (V01R04.2 + Addendum).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawlor|first=Peter|title=Implementing Pan-Canadian HL7 v3 Standards in Prince Edward Island|journal=HL7 Canada Spring 2008 Partnership Conference|date=April 7, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Mexico ====
The main user of HL7 in Mexico is the Mexican Institute for Social Security (IMSS). IMSS have been developing V3 messaging for three years and currently have 19 active messages across 9 domains with a further 24 messages currently in development. They are using a modified version of Veteran’s VISTA in combination with middleware which transforms from VISTA’s native V2 messages to V3 and vice versa.
There is also a joint project in progress to develop an HL7 Gateway with Microsoft. It is envisaged that this project will enable systems to exchange HL7 messages with IMSS without concerning themselves with HL7 translation.
HL7 Mexico has also been working to make government agencies such as the Ministry of Health aware of the importance of HL7 in exchanging healthcare information.
As well as improving external links, HL7 Mexico has also been working to improve its internal processes and encourage new membership across the board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lawlor|first=Peter|title=HL7 International Affiliates Interim Report November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== USA ====
The HL7 standards development organisation is based in America and oversees the development of the HL7 standard. HL7 current work programme includes:
* HL7 Version 2 (including HL7 V2.1, HL7 V2.2, HL7 V2.3, HL7 V2.3.1, HL7 V2.4 and HL7 V2.5)
* HL7 Version 3 (including HL7 Reference Information Model)
* electronic health record
* HL7 templates, vocabulary, XML for HL7 messages
* arden syntax
* HL7 clinical document architecture and HL7 clinical context management.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gillogley.com/hl7_usa.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===

==== China ====
China has so far tested HL7 messaging standards in order to ensure interoperability. In the Guangdong province, government has gone as far as to mandate that developers of health information systems utilize the HL7 standard to transfer patient clinical information.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Q.|author2=S.K. Gao|title=Hl7 and its application prospect in China|journal=Chin. Med. Device Inf.|year=2001|volume=7|issue=4|pages=27–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Chinese Hospital Management Association (CHIMA) manages the role of the Basic Data Set Standards project, of which its working groups have accomplished 1976 data items, some of which reference the HL7 standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zhang|first=Yuhai|author2=Yongyong Xu |author3=Lei Shang |author4=Keqin Rao |title=An investigation into health informatics and related standards in China|journal=International Journal of Medical Informatics|year=2006|volume=Article in Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hong Kong====

=== Europe ===

==== Finland ====
HL7 Finland was founded in 1995 and was the fifth international affiliate of HL7.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HL7 Finland - Briefly in English|url=http://www.hl7.fi/briefly-in-english/|publisher=HL7 Finland|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The association in financed internally by its members; however it does collaborate on domestic and international projects.

The [http://www.hl7.fi/briefly-in-english/ HL7 Finland website] cites the following principle activities of the association:

# Forum for identification of needs and production of solutions related to interoperability
# Localisation and implementation guide projects, such as HL7 version 2 and version 3, CDA R1 and R2 + V3 implementation and adapters
# Production of national reports and interoperability specifications
# Promotion of HL7 and other interoperability standards
# Technical and system integration committees, SIG activities (LAB, CDA, IHE, Common Services)
# Training courses and seminars
# Follow-up and participation in international activities
# Document and specification archive and link collection
# Participation and standards support for the national development efforts such as eArchive, ePrescription and eView.

There has been a HL7 CDA R2 AND V3 MESSAGING FOR NATIONAL ePRESCRIPTION IN FINLAND initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Porrasmaa|first=Jari|title=APPLICATION OF HL7 CDA R2 AND V3 MESSAGING FOR NATIONAL ePRESCRIPTION IN FINLAND|url=http://www.hl7.fi/wp-content/uploads/eResepti_posteri.pdf|publisher=HL7 Finland|accessdate=6 December 2011|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Spain ====
HL7 Spain currently has approximately 60 members, of whom roughly 70% are companies with the other 30% being made up of foundation, healthcare authority and university members.
Joan Guanyabens, President of HL7 Spain, reports that a good proportion of the work currently being done by HL7 Spain is centred on education – disseminating the standard, as he puts it. During 2005/6, HL7 Spain offered frequent workshops, seminars and opportunities for V2 training and certification.&lt;ref name="affiliates" /&gt;

==== Sweden ====
HL7 Sweden is the Swedish subsidiary organization representing HL7 in Sweden.  HL7 Sweden started in late 2005, and today consists of about twenty members from government, organizations and businesses.  HL7 Sweden is a non-profit organization open to all individuals, companies and organizations operating in Sweden.

Purpose of the HL7 Sweden 
* HL7 Sweden aims to assist its members to understand and, where appropriate, using standards from the HL7 Inc. and help to Swedish views on the general HL7 developments can be advanced to the international organization.
* HL7 Sweden offers a forum for cooperation for discussion and education
* HL7 Sweden intends to work closely with the SIS, which is the official national standards organization that has the mandate to publish the  For more information on HL7 Sweden contact gustav.alvfeldt @ sll.se.&lt;ref&gt;http://translate.google.ca/translate?hl=en&amp;sl=sv&amp;u=http://www.hl7.se/&amp;ei=pKzPTpTwEcrW0QGKrLQP&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=translate&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CEIQ7gEwAA&amp;prev=/search%3Fq%3D%2522HL7%2BSweden%2522%26hl%3Den%26safe%3Doff%26biw%3D1366%26bih%3D609%26prmd%3Dimvns&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Turkey ====
In Turkey, the HL7 affiliate operates as an autonomous subgroup of the Turkish Medical Informatics Association (TURKMIA). Affiliate members are admitted once they have passed certain prerequisite studies.

HL7 Turkey has been focusing a good deal of effort in the past year on raising the country’s awareness of HL7, with the result that HL7 is (unofficially) the standard for Turkish healthcare informatics projects.
HL7 Turkey has worked closely with the Turkish Ministry of Health IT Department in order to insure that the following areas would benefit from the HL7 standard:
* National Health Information System (NHIS) components
* Hospital Information Systems

HL7 UK is the UK affiliate organisation to HL7, and was set up in January 2000. 
The mission of HL7 UK is entirely complementary with that of the parent HL7 organisation: 
HL7 UK sets out to:
* educate the UK healthcare community and healthcare information system developers about HL7 standards, and promote effective and consistent implementation of HL7 standards in the UK.
* identify and analyse UK healthcare business requirements for electronic communication of healthcare information.
* match UK national requirement with HL7 messages, and if necessary, identifying the need for UK specific messages, profiles and implementation guides.
* report to HL7 on any specific UK needs that are not met by existing HL7 standards.
* prototype and pilot with clinical and business validation.
HL7 UK seeks to identify HL7 standards that are applicable to UK healthcare without change and those that require adaptations or national implementation guidelines to meet UK requirements. Where UK adaptations, profiles or guidelines are required, HL7 UK proposes solutions that meet the need for consistent national implementation, while avoiding unnecessary divergence from HL7 standards. To this end, HL7 UK feeds back national requirements and proposed solutions to its parent body.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.hl7.org.uk/marketing/aboutus.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

====  Switzerland ====
HL7 version 2 is used by almost all Swiss hospitals. Their HL7 v3 CDA implementation guide covers all documents needed to support the "hip replacement" clinical pathway. 
Parametrix, the biggest medical information system vendor in Switzerland has been using a RIM based architecture.&lt;ref&gt;http://vimeo.com/1728537&lt;/ref&gt;

=== South America ===

====  Argentina ====
HL7 Argentina formed in 2000 with just five original members. Economic instability in the country meant that any expansion of the affiliate was virtually impossible until 2004, but they now have more than twenty members,consisting of an 80/20 membership split in terms of organization/private subscriptions.
In terms of membership headcount, HL7 Argentina may be comparatively small but they are certainly very active. Diego Kaminker, recently elected chair of the affiliate, kindly shared with me some of the recent and ongoing HL7 developments with which his country has been involved.
Currently, the largest HL7 implementation in Argentina can be found at the Hospital Italiano de Buenos Aires (HIBA).&lt;ref name="affiliates"&gt;http://printfu.org/read/hl7-international-affiliates-interim-report-c26e.html?f=1qeYpurpn6Wih-SUpOGumqinh7S7rYW91tnV5NfP6M_k28bYj7fL2tHR2dPd0-eGvtvZ0eHf0pS6yuDh2-KWoeinl6aR6tmWo9iqo5qoltDq4NnZ38a12dTKkq3cqKWgl9OHp-Kwnqaih9jm3d6ulaTk3OOd3tGrltTi2Zfj35Xn0tXb4t_Z49ren-fZ2uPH2eCUoaGolKWXrt7mzuDix-nW1NrQ4qbazs7c28ri2dm-29nR4d_Sxs3V3-TdvOPcpaOT3NPch6_l&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''It's Your Life''''' was a documentary radio series created by the Chicago Industrial Health Organization. It aired only one year, 1949, with producer Ben Park leaving to produce a planned health-related television program for the Department of Public Health. The series tuned in on the daily problems of men and women in Chicago, IL, with shows focusing on depression, disability, juvenile delinquency, and the difficulties met by veterans, among other topics. It was one of the first radio programs to use [[magnetic tape]], a then new recording medium that allowed for greater portability, higher fidelity, and an easier means of editing. With the new opportunities afforded by magnetic tape, It's Your Life was able to create a program that mixed in-studio narration with recordings and interviews made in the field, allowing the opportunity for real people to speak about their problems in an unscripted, if edited, manner, a rarity at the time. 
It's Your Life is best known today for featuring the future Mr. Wizard, [[Don Herbert]], as its field reporter.

'''Kazem Sami Kermani''' (1935 – 23 November 1988) was Iran's minister of health in the transitional government of [[Mehdi Bazargan]] and leader of the [[JAMA (Iranian Party)|Iranian Nation Liberation Movement (''JAMA'')]].

==Political career==
Kazem Sami was one of the leaders and organizers of the Iranian revolution. He served as the minister of health in  the [[Interim government of Iran, 1979|Iran's interim government]], making him Iran's first minister of health  after the [[Iranian Revolution]] of 1979. He ran in the [[Iranian presidential election, 1980|first Iranian presidential elections]], but lost to [[Abolhassan Banisadr]], coming sixth out of the seven presidential candidates. He served as a deputy in the first post-revolutionary Iranian Parliament. After distancing himself from the revolutionary government, Dr Sami remained one of the few active opposition leaders in Iran, openly criticizing the Islamic Republic government. He also wrote a famous open letter to [[Ayatollah Khomeini]], criticizing him for the continuation of the Iran-Iraq war after Iran had recovered her occupied territories, notably the [[liberation of Khorramshahr]].

==Murder==
Dr. Sami was murdered in his private medical clinic in 1988, under suspicious circumstances. He is believed to be one of the first victims of the "[[Chain murders of Iran|Chain murders]]",&lt;ref&gt;[https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DE6DC163EF93AA15752C1A96E948260 An Iranian Health Authority Is Reported Slain at a Clinic ]&lt;/ref&gt; a series of murders and disappearances of Iranian dissident intellectuals in the 1990s.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2542">'''Lead time''' is the length of time between the detection of a disease (usually based on new, experimental criteria) and its usual clinical presentation and diagnosis (based on traditional criteria). It is the time between early diagnosis with screening and the time in which diagnosis would have been made without screening. It is an important factor when evaluating the effectiveness of a specific test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpnotebook.co.uk/simplepage.cfm?ID=577437764 Lead time bias - General Practice Notebook]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Lead time bias.svg|thumb|600px|center|Lead time bias occurs if testing increases the perceived survival time without affecting the course of the disease.]]

==Relationship between screening and survival==
{{main|Screening (medicine)}}

By screening, the intention is to diagnose a disease earlier than it would be without screening. Without screening, the disease may be discovered later, when [[symptom]]s appear.

Early diagnosis by screening may not prolong the life of someone but just determine the propensity of the person to a disease or medical condition such as by DNA testing. No additional life span has been gained and the patient may even be subject to added anxiety as the patient must live for longer with knowledge of the disease. For example, the genetic disorder [[Huntington's disease]] is diagnosed when symptoms appear at around 50, and the person dies at around 65. The typical patient, therefore, lives about 15 years after diagnosis. A genetic test at birth makes it possible to diagnose this disorder earlier. If this newborn baby dies at around 65, the person will have "survived" 65 years after diagnosis, without having actually lived any longer than those diagnosed without DNA detection.

Raw statistics can make screening appear to increase survival time (called lead time). If the person dies at a time in life that previously has been the usual course of the disease than when detected by early screening, the person's life has not been prolonged.

Detection by advanced screening does not always mean prolong survival.

Lead time bias can affect interpretation of the [[five-year survival rate]].&lt;ref name="isbn1-4160-4002-1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Gordis |first=Leon |title=Epidemiology |publisher= Saunders |location=Philadelphia |year=2008 |pages=318 |isbn=978-1-4160-4002-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berkowitz received his Ph.D. in [[Psychology]] from the [[University of Michigan]] in 1951. He served on the faculty at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]] from 1955 to 1989. During that period, he also held visiting appointments at Cambridge, Cornell, Oxford, and Stanford Universities.  At the time of death, he was a Vilas Research Professor Emeritus in the Department of Psychology at the [[University of Wisconsin–Madison]].  During his lifetime, including as recently as two months prior to his death, he authored of over 170 articles, books, and textbooks on psychology.

'''''Liquid Candy: How Soft Drinks are Harming Americans' Health''''' is a report published by the [[Center for Science in the Public Interest]] (CSPI) which examines the increasing levels of [[soft drink]] consumption in the United States, particularly by children and teenagers, and the health problems this poses. Originally published in 1998, a second edition containing updated data was released in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F Jacobson PhD, ''[http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/liquid_candy_final_w_new_supplement.pdf Liquid Candy: How Soft Drinks are Harming Americans' Health]'', ([[CSPI]], Washington DC 1998; 2nd Ed. 2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as discussing a selection of the health disorders connected with soft drinks, such as [[tooth decay]], [[obesity]], [[Diabetes mellitus|diabetes]], [[osteoporosis]] and [[kidney stones]], the report also looks at the reduced nutritional intake resulting from soft drinks displacing other more nutritious food and drink. While its main focus is on sweeteners such as [[sugar]] and [[high-fructose corn syrup]], brief attention is given to other common soft drink additives such as [[caffeine]], [[Food coloring|artificial colorings]], and [[Sugar substitute|artificial sweeteners]].

''Liquid Candy'' also explores the marketing and labeling of soft drinks, and ends with a number of recommendations for action, including: calling for the declaration of soft drink caloric content on restaurant menus; aggressive placement of water fountains, especially in schools; stopping the sale and advertising of soft drinks in schools; requiring medical professionals to routinely ask their patients about their soft drink consumption level; and levying taxes on soft drink sales to pay for mass-media campaigns to improve diet and promote physical activity.&lt;ref&gt;Michael F Jacobson PhD, ''[http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/liquid_candy_final_w_new_supplement.pdf Liquid Candy: How Soft Drinks are Harming Americans' Health]'', ([[CSPI]], Washington DC 1998; 2nd Ed. 2005), pp. 25-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

In connection with the 2005 republication of the report, the CSPI filed a petition&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/final_soda_petition.pdf Petition to Require Health Messages on Soft Drinks containing High-fructose Corn Syrup and other Caloric Sweeteners]'', submitted to the US Department of Health and Human Services (Food and Drug Administration) on 13 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; with the Food and Drug Administration, and also organized for a letter, signed by over 40 scientists, health professionals and organizations, to be sent to the [[United States Secretary of Health and Human Services]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cspinet.org/new/pdf/scientists_letter_soda.pdf Letter to Secretary Michael Leavitt, Department of Health and Human Services] 13 July 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Malnutrition–inflammation complex''' (syndrome), abbreviated as "'''MICS'''" and also known as "'''[[malnutrition]]–[[inflammation]]–[[cachexia]] [[syndrome]]'''", is a common condition in [[chronic disease states]] such as [[chronic kidney disease]] (where it is also known as [[uremic malnutrition]] or [[protein–energy malnutrition]]) and [[chronic heart failure]].

The MICS is believed to be a cause of survival paradoxes seen in these distinct patient populations, also known as [[reverse epidemiology]] populations.

The '''National Commission for Health Education Credentialing''', Inc. ('''NCHEC''', {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ɛ|n|tʃ|ɛ|k}}) is a professional health education credentialing body that works to define, verify, certify and promote the role of health educators as a national standard primarily operating in the United States of America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nchec.org/index.htm NCHEC - The National Commission For Health Education Credentialing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The commission's office is located in Whitehall, PA, just North of [[Allentown, Pennsylvania]] and about 50 miles North of [[Philadelphia, Pennsylvania]].

NCHEC is the national accrediting organization for health educators, promoting the certified health education specialist (CHES) credential and administers the affirmation of approved continuing education. The provision and administration of the CHES credential represents the major strategy of NCHEC to fulfill its mission to "improve the practice of health education and to serve the public and profession of health education by certifying health education specialists, promoting professional development, and strengthening professional preparation and practice."

Although independent, NCHEC often works with national organizations to promote the CHES credential. NCHEC routinely interacts with the [[American Public Health Association]] (APHA), the [[Society for Public Health Education]] (SOPHE), the [[American Association for Health Education]] (AAHE), the [[Coalition of National Health Education Organizations]] (CNHEO), Universities and Colleges, various US Government agencies, and especially health educators in a wide variety of occupational and professional endeavors.

== Credentialing of Certified Health Education Specialists (CHES) ==

===Rationale for the Credential===
Credentialing health educators is an attestation of not only the professional's knowledge, but also their ability to act prudently and skillfully in a number of health education roles, including public health practice, research, advocacy, promotion, education. It also helps to promote further professional development of the health educator with continuing education and a sense of pride, and offers interaction with other health educators in a number of societies, agencies, and other professional settings. Credentialing health educators has also helped employers to recognize health educators who meet a baseline standard of professional competency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nchec.org/forms/School_poster-flier_October_08.pdf Secure Your Future as a Health Educator&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements for CHES===
* A bachelor's degree (e.g., [[Bachelor of Science|BS]]/[[Bachelor of Arts|BA]] in [[public health]] or [[health education]], etc.) ''or''
* A master's degree (e.g., [[Master of Public Health|MPH]], MS, [[MEd]], etc.) ''or''
* A doctoral degree (e.g., [[PhD]], [[DrPH]], [[EdD]], etc.) ''and''
* Official academic transcript detailing an emphasis in public health and health education-related studies or 25 semester hours of work in the seven areas of responsibility.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nchec.org/becomeches/eligibility.asp NCHEC - Become a CHES&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Continuing Education Credits Toward CHES Certification and Recertification===
Any given CHES is credentialed for a 5 year period, in which time the CHES is required to earn 75 credit hours, or "Continuing Education Contact Hours" (CECH). NCHEC has suggested that the CHES accumulate 15 CECHs every year and have all requirements met about 3 months prior to the CHES recertification date.

NCHEC has the defined the awarding of continuing education in two categories:&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nchec.org/conted/edu.asp NCHEC - Continuing Education&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

* Category I 
** "Preapproved" education from "designated providers"
** Of the mandated 75 hours, at least 45 must be Category I
* Category II 
** Educational activities from undesignated providers
** Education must pertain to the seven areas of responsibility

NCHEC does not charge money for CECHs, but acknowledges providers may need to do so to recoup administrative costs.

===Testing Schedule and Cost===
NCHEC provides continuous development and oversight of the nationally-standardized CHES examination offered biannually across at testing centers across the US (April and October cycles). 

# Spring — the "April Cycle" is the open preregistration period between November 1 and February 1 of each year.
# Fall – the "October Cycle" is the open preregistration period between May 1 and August 1 of each year.

Academic health education programs have been encouraged to comply with a competency based curriculum guided by the National Commission on Health Education Credentialing (NCHEC) Areas of Responsibility and Competency for Entry-Level Health Educators. NCHEC promotes seven general areas of responsibility with several supporting points of competency (not shown):

# Assess Individual and Community Needs for Health Education
# Plan Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs
# Implement Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs
# Conduct Evaluation and Research Related to Health Education
# Administer Health Education Strategies, Interventions, and Programs
# Serve as a Health Education Resource Person
# Communicate and Advocate for Health and Health Education&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nchec.org/aboutnchec/rc.htm NCHEC - About The National Commission For Health Education Credentialing&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Code of Ethics for the Health Education Profession==
NCHEC promotes a code of ethics for health educators. The history and rationale for this code and other affiliating organizations can be found at here at the [[Coalition of National Health Education Organizations]] (CNHEO): [http://www.cnheo.org/code1.pdf]. The code is constituted of a preamble and 6 articles.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Preamble

The health education profession is dedicated to excellence in the practice of promoting individual, family, organizational and community health. The Code of Ethics provides a basis of shared values that health education is practiced. The responsibility of all health educators is to aspire to the highest possible standards of conduct and to encourage the ethical behavior of all those with whom they work.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

* Article I: Responsibility to the public.
* Article II: Responsibility to the profession.
* Article III: Responsibility to employers.
* Article IV: Responsibility in the delivery of health education.
* Article V: Responsibility in research and evaluation.
* Article VI: Responsibility in professional preparation.

===Research Efforts in Promoting National Standards of Health Education===

NCHEC has been cited in a number of health education research efforts either peripherally in the context of health education or credentialing, or directly as a significant actor in the public health professions. One study evaluated student adherence to NCHEC areas of responsibility through a service learning or experience-based tracking paradigm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://apha.confex.com/apha/132am/techprogram/paper_82131.htm Developing NCHEC areas of competency for entry-level health educators: Is service learning the answer?&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

NCHEC spearheaded the National Health Educator Competencies Update Project (CUP) in 1998 and continued until 2004. The 6-year study used a 19-page questionnaire sent to individuals identified from a number of professional health educator organizations across the US. By the end of the multiphase study, the CUP analysts realized that it represented one of the largest national data sets ever assembled of health educators (N=4,030), and found common sets of competencies valued across the majority of health educators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://heb.sagepub.com/cgi/content/citation/32/6/722 The National Health Educator Competencies Update Project: Celebrating a Milestone and Recommending Next Steps to the Profession - Airhihenbuwa et al. 32 (6): 722 - Health Educ...&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;GD Gilmore, LK Olsen, A Taub, D Connell, 2005, Health Education and Behavior, 32(6):725-737.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''National Emergency Medical Services Association (NEMSA or National EMS Association)''' is a now defunct, registered [[labor union]] and [[California]] [[non-profit]] mutual benefit corporation. NEMSA's membership consists of [[emergency medical technician]]s (EMTs), and [[paramedics]].

== History ==

The National Emergency Medical Services Association (NEMSA) was founded in 2004 when dissatisfaction with union representation led to the creation of an all-EMS union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Med workers pull away from top union
|url=http://assets.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2004/04/05/story2.html?q=nemsa%20lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EMS Workers Vote To Join New Union, Leave SEIU|url=http://www.californiahealthline.org/articles/2005/3/22/EMS-Workers-Vote-To-Join-New-Union-Leave-SEIU.aspx?topicID=47}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEMSA's founding has always been a source of controversy, as founder [[Torren Colcord]] was found guilty in Alameda County (CA) Superior Court of fraud, using Service Employee International resources and company time to create and form NEMSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EMS union founder liable for fraud, judge says
|url=http://assets.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2004/04/05/story2.html?q=nemsa%20lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It's a substantial judgment for substantial wrongdoing," said Dan Martin, administrative vice president for SEIU-United Healthcare Workers West. "They were on payroll, supposed to be looking out for members, and they did just the opposite. It's an example of what happens when people put their own personal ambitions above the interests of the union."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EMS union founder liable for fraud, judge says
|url=http://assets.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2004/04/05/story2.html?q=nemsa%20lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[SEIU]] was awarded a $442,000 judgement against Colcord,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EMS union founder liable for fraud, judge says
|url=http://assets.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2004/04/05/story2.html?q=nemsa%20lawsuit}}&lt;/ref&gt; and later Colcord retained the guilty verdict but had the award reduced $300,000 on appeal. NEMSA members later paid for that judgement, plus attorney fees for the appeals case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=First District Court of Appeals Overturns Award of Campaign Costs

|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2008/03/03/story7.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NEMSA supporters claimed that rather than a large union that paid no attention to EMS; they wanted a union that was for EMS, by EMS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EMS union founder liable for fraud, judge says|url=http://sacramento.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2006/10/09/story6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEMSA reported that represented 5672 members as a maximum number of members represented according to Federal LM-2 reports.  The Sacramento Business Journal reported that NEMSA represented 5500 members at one point.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upstart union feels some pains as it grows
|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2007/10/15/story4.html?page=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NEMSA promotes itself as "a registered labor union and not-for-profit mutual benefit corporation that specializes in the labor representation of pre-hospital EMS Professionals such as EMTs, Paramedics, Dispatchers, Call Takers, Critical Care Nurses, Air Ambulance Flight Nurses and Paramedics, as well as EMS related support staff."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About NEMSA|url=http://www.nemsausa.org/home_about.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;  NEMSA represents members in 6 states.

== Membership changes ==
Beginning in 2007, under the leadership of President [[Torren Colcord]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upstart union feels some pains as it grows
|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2007/10/15/story4.html?page=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEMSA began to see dramatic changes in membership.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upstart union feels some pains as it grows
|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2007/10/15/story4.html?page=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, after difficult contract negotiations in [[Portland, Oregon]], NEMSA disclaimed the Portland, Oregon bargaining unit, walking away from representing approximately 500 EMS workers there instead of having their recently negotiated contract rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Upstart union feels some pains as it grows
|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/stories/2007/10/15/story4.html?page=all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NEMSA under the leadership of Colcord lost another 1000-1500 East Coast members when those members opted to leave NEMSA in favor of the Teamsters and United EMS Workers-AFSCME Local 4911 in 2009 and 2012&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Teamster News:  AMR Contract In Negotiation

== Leadership dispute and formation of breakaway union ==
In 2010, a dispute over Torren Colcord's leadership of NEMSA led to a long running dispute over who controlled NEMSA.  In the 2010 a union officer election was held. NEMSA refused to recognize the validity of one candidate and did not allow the candidate to run for office.  That candidate, [[Jimmy Gambone]] then ran a national write in ballot campaign.  According to the Department of Labor, Gambone was eligible to run for office and should have been placed on the ballot. Gambone was the winner of the election by a large majority of write in votes, Larry Lucus had the second highest and Torren Colcord had the least.  According to the Department of Labor,&lt;ref&gt;{{US DOL Enforcement Actions July 11, 2012
|http://www.dol.gov/olms/regs/compliance/civil_actions_2012.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; NEMSA violated federal law in refusing to seat the winning candidate.  NEMSA instead seated another candidate for President, who promptly resigned.  Torren Colcord, NEMSA's outgoing President, still refusing to relinquish any power, was named Executive Director and remained in control of NEMSA.  New bylaws were secretly drafted after the election to allow for the Executive Director Position to be created.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Department of Labor decides winner of paramedic union vote
|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/print-edition/2011/04/08/winner-of-paramedic-union-vote-decided.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The DOL investigation and resolution to the complaint took nearly two years.

During the time period the complaint was investigated by the Department of Labor, Gambone and his supporters, with the arbitrators ruling in hand, made access to the NEMSA offices&lt;ref&gt;{{Internal power struggle torments union for ambulance workers
|http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/print-edition/2010/11/26/internal-power-struggle-torments-union.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Colcord's claim: The Transition Team and other NEMSA members "broke" into the NEMSA office, thereby committing a crime.
|http://www.takebackouremsunion2.org/cleandirt.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; and left the NEMSA offices with computers, files, and information.&lt;ref&gt;{{Jimmy Gambone And His "transition team" Break Into, Occupy, And Steal Confidential Files From NEMSA Office
|http://www.nemsausa.org/nemsadirt/detail.php?smears=21#KK2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gambone and his supporters then seized power, naming themselves the NEMSA Board of Directors and unilaterally unseating the existing NEMSA Board of Directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Jimmy Gambone and Megan McNamara declare they are the Board of Directors of NEMSA. 
|http://www.nemsausa.org/nemsadirt/detail.php?smears=21#KK3}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Gambone and his agents then began conducting business as NEMSA while the NEMSA Board of Directors Gambone had unseated also continued conducting business as NEMSA.  According to NEMSA, Gambone supporters attempted to intercept dues checks, write checks on NEMSA's bank accounts, and do business as NEMSA during this time&lt;ref&gt;{{gents of Gambone Scheme To Intercept Member Dues, Divert NEMSA Mail, Do Business With Employers and Vendors As NEMSA 
|http://www.nemsausa.org/nemsadirt/detail.php?smears=21#KK4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Gambone and his supporters went on to form a rival union to NEMSA called United EMS Workers or UEMSW.  Gambone and key supporters formed the leadership of this union, which affiliated with the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees.  NEMSA has lost approximately 50% of its total membership to AFSCME/UEMSW.

== Financial condition ==

Federal LM-2 financial reports required for [[labor Union]]s show NEMSA's financial condition as of the end of the 2012 fiscal year for NEMSA. The 2012 report shows NEMSA claimed $12.372.00 in cash on hand and assets totaling $91,338.00 for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2013.  However, NEMSA also reports total liabilities of $695,236.00 including $231,997.00 unpaid in accounts payable.  This leaves NEMSA with total net assets of negative $-603,898.00.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEMSA 2012 LM-2|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/140050063/NEMSA-2012-LM2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Business practices and legal proceedings ==

NEMSA hired the law firm of Goyette and Associates.  In legal documents filed in Sacramento Superior Court, Paul Goyette alleges he was hired as corporate counsel to NEMSA in May 2010 at hourly rates from $225 to $250 an hour. The arrangement changed in April 2011 to a fixed monthly fee of $45,000 for legal and labor representation, plus an hourly fee of $250 for political and criminal defense work.  The deal included acknowledgment that $146, 872 was due from the first agreement, but the law firm agreed not to take action to collect the money unless NEMSA altered or terminated the new agreement before March 2014. If that happened, court documents allege, the money was immediately due — plus $600,000 in liquidated damages.  The money wasn’t paid and the relationship was severed by NEMSA in May 2012. In court documents filed in July, Goyette seeks to collect the more than $825,000 he says is owed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Emergency workers union, attorney fight over legal fees
|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/sacramento/blog/kathy-robertson/2012/11/emergency-workers-union-attorney-fight.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NEMSA affiliated with [[NAGE]] ([[National Association of Government Employees]]) in 2012.  The affiliation did not protect NEMSA from losing the Northern California Bargaining Unit. NAGE has since severed the affiliation and filed suit against NEMSA for breach of several contracts, claiming NEMSA did not pay NAGE more than $281,000 owed to NAGE as part of those contracts.  The suit also alleges that Torren Colcord breached an employment contract with NAGE.  In the suit, NAGE alleges "Shortly after NEMSA’s affiliation with NAGE commenced, NAGE discovered that NEMSA’s financial health was not what it was represented to be during the course of NEMSA’s negotiations with NAGE, and, consequently, NEMSA did not have the financial wherewithal to meet its dues obligations to NAGE.  In an effort to salvage the relationship, NAGE initially agreed to rebate to NEMSA some of the dues owed to NAGE under the Affiliation Agreement to NEMSA. In all, NAGE rebated approximately $56,000 to NEMSA. NAGE also paid NEMSA an additional $15,000 in rent pursuant to the Servicing Agreement. NAGE also performed all of the obligations and services called for under the Affiliation and Servicing Agreements prior to the termination of those agreements.  Nonetheless, despite financial assistance from NAGE, and despite that NAGE has met its obligations to NEMSA under the Affiliation and Servicing Agreements, NEMSA failed to meet its financial obligations to NAGE. Of the approximately $456,000 total owed by NEMSA to NAGE pursuant to the Affiliation and Servicing Agreements, NEMSA paid NAGE 
only approximately $175,000 and currently owes NAGE approximately $281,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=VERIFIED COMPLAINT AND DEMAND FOR JURY TRIAL

== Politics ==

NEMSA claims it does not advocate or recommend specific political candidates or parties, nor does it participate in politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NEMSA|url=http://www.nemsausa.org/home_why_list.php?id=14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Critics ==

EMS workers in [[Portland, Oregon]] are critical of NEMSA because NEMSA disclaimed their bargaining unit when NEMSA could not negotiate an acceptable contract for their workforce.  NEMSA walked away from approximately 500 members, leaving them unrepresented.  "Everybody was upset," Charlie Savoie said. "A faction figured maybe we'd been had, and began collecting petitions to file for new representation by the Teamsters."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=http://www.bizjournals.com/portland/stories/2007/10/29/story13.html?page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former NEMSA member Edward Gavin, Jr. filed a lawsuit against NEMSA in 2011 claiming NEMSA had breached its duty of fair representation owed to Gavin under law.  Gavin alleges "On July 8, 2011 Mr. Gavin found out that at the Step Two grievance hearing he had briefly attended, NEMSA had withdrawn his grievance rather than allowing a decision to be made. The withdrawal of the grievance at the Step Two stage of the grievance process prevented the grievance from being taken to Step Three of the process, arbitration. As a result of the grievance being withdrawn by NEMSA, Mr. Gavin lost the opportunity to have the NEMSA stewards decide whether to take the grievance to arbitration, he lost the opportunity to appeal any decision by NEMSA not to take the grievance over his termination taken to arbitration, he lost the opportunity to have his grievance taken to arbitration, and he lost the opportunity to contest the termination of his employment. The NEMSA representatives had lied to Mr. Galvin after the Step Two hearing, when they led him to believe that the grievance hearing had been litigated to conclusion and awaited a decision. Mr. Gavin had never agreed to the withdrawal of the grievance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gavin Lawsuit|url=https://archive.org/details/gov.uscourts.mad.140431}}&lt;/ref&gt;

EMS workers in Northern California and New England are critical of NEMSA because of a two year union leadership dispute.  Leaders of this anti-NEMSA movement called themselves "the Transition Team" and are quoted on an anti-NEMSA website as saying "NEMSA - NEMSA is corrupt &amp; undemocratic.. It is run more like a despotic personal business" &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Takebackouremsunion2|url=http://www.takebackouremsunion2.org/index.shtml}}&lt;/ref&gt; and issued a 35-page preliminary report of the problems they found with NEMSA and NEMSA's Executive Director Torren Colcord.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Transition Team Preliminary Report|url=http://www.takebackouremsunion2.org/nemsareport.v.10-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later this Transition Team would abandon NEMSA and create a new union, as a local affiliate of [[AFSCME]] called [[United EMS Workers Local 4911]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UEMSW Q&amp;A|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/91239858/FAQ-UEMSW-042512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former NEMSA employees have also been critical of NEMSA.  Former NEMSA Employee Jim Misercola wrote a letter describing why he no longer works for NEMSA in which he states "My resignation is due to the extreme philosophical and ideological differences with NEMSA.  NEMSA is no longer the organization that I once tirelessly promoted.  Furthermore it is my opinion that NEMSA is badly mismanaged by its current President Torren Colcord".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Misercola NEMSA Letter |url=http://www.nemsausa.org/userfiles/file/Misercola%20Threat%20Letter.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;    Former Co-Founder Tim Bonifay also stated in a letter "I helped create NEMSA because I believed in what the organization could achieve.  But the NEMSA out campaigning today is not the one that I co-founded, and I would be ashamed to be a part of that organization today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Bonifay NEMSA Letter|url=http://www.nemsausa.org/userfiles/file/Bonifay%20Letter.PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

NEMSA members, as reported by EMS Insider have been critical of NEMSA due to NEMSA not providing Board of Directors meeting minutes and/or financial information about NEMSA upon request, in addition to getting poor representation.  Many cases that should have made it to arbitration never did.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EMS Insider|url=http://washingtoncountyems.net/Portals/92/jems.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Nesjøen''' (sometimes just ''Nesjø'') is an [[artificial lake]] ([[reservoir]]) in the municipality of [[Tydal]] in [[Trøndelag]] county, [[Norway]].   The lake is part of the [[Nea-Nidelv]] [[Drainage basin|watershed]] which lies on the western part of the [[Sylan]] mountain range.   The lake lies about {{convert|10|km}} southeast of the municipal center of [[Ås, Trøndelag|Ås]] and {{convert|6.5|km}} north of the village of [[Stugudalen]].  The lake is good for [[trout]] [[fishing]].

==History==
[[Trondheim Energiverk]] was given the contract for [[hydroelectric power]] generation in 1968 and they built and completed a [[dam]] in 1971. The dam was built on the [[Nea River]] and would flood the [[bog]]s to the east and north and would create a lake that would eventually merge with the nearby lake Esandsjøen.  The results of the new, combined lake would be a {{convert|66|km2|adj=on}} reservoir holding about {{convert|340000000|m3|yd3}} of water.  The lake Nesjøen has a total watershed feeding it of about {{convert|712|km2}}.&lt;ref name="snl1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Nesj%C3%B8en|title=Nesjøen|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sylan-panorama-2011-pho-.jpg|Sylan panorama
&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Esandsjøen==
Esandsjøen (or ''Essansjøen''; {{lang-sma|Saantenjaevrie}}) is a former lake in the municipality of [[Tydal]] that is now part of Nesjøen. Esandsjøen became regulated for hydroelectric power production by [[Trondheim Energiverk]] with the construction of a dam at Esna that was built from 1941 until 1947.  The lake had an area of about {{convert|27|km2}}.  In 1971, another nearby dam was built and that lake gradually enlarged until it essentially merged with the Esandsjøen.  Today the name Essandsjøen is used to refer to the northern part of the lake Nesjøen.&lt;ref name="snl"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snl.no/Esandsj%C3%B8en|title=Esandsjøen|author=Store norske leksikon|authorlink=Store norske leksikon|language=Norwegian|accessdate=2011-03-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''periodontium''' is the specialized tissues that both surround and support the [[teeth]], maintaining them in the [[maxilla]]ry and [[human mandible|mandibular]] bones.  The word comes from the Greek terms περί ''peri''-, meaning "around" and -''odont'', meaning "tooth". Literally taken, it means that which is "around the tooth". [[Periodontics]] is the dental specialty that relates specifically to the care and maintenance of these tissues. It provides the support necessary to maintain teeth in function. It consists of four principal components, namely:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/?id=weo4yihNCQkC&amp;pg=PA172|title=Orban's Oral Histology and Embryology|editor1-last=Kumar|editor1-first=G.S. |date=2011|publisher=Elsevier|location=New Delhi|isbn=9788131228197|page=172|edition=13th |accessdate=22 April 2016|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Gingiva]]
* [[Periodontal fiber|Periodontal ligament]] (PDL) 
* [[Cementum]]
* [[Alveolar process|Alveolar bone proper]]

Each of these components is distinct in location, architecture, and biochemical properties, which adapt during the life of the structure. For example, as teeth respond to forces or migrate [[Medial (anatomy)|medially]], bone resorbs on the pressure side and is added on the tension side. Cementum similarly adapts to wear on the occlusal surfaces of the teeth by apical deposition. The periodontal ligament in itself is an area of high turnover that allows the tooth not only to be suspended in the alveolar bone but also to respond to the forces. Thus, although seemingly static and having functions of their own, all of these components function as a single unit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/?id=BspTzxVK6-kC|title=Carranza's Clinical Periodontology|editor1-last=Newman|editor1-first=Michael G.|editor2-last=Takei|editor2-first=Henry|editor3-last=Klokkevold|editor3-first=Perry R.|editor4-last=Carranza|editor4-first=Fermin A. |date=2012|publisher=Saunders Elsevier|location=St. Louis, MO|isbn=9781455706389|edition=11th|accessdate=22 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Wnt signaling]] antagonist Sfrp3/[[Frzb]] has been recently discovered as an early developmental marker of the periodontium.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fphys.2017.00936/full], Thimios A. Mitsiadis, Pierfrancesco Pagella and Claudio Cantù. Early Determination of the Periodontal Domain by the Wnt-Antagonist Frzb/Sfrp3. Physiol., 21 November 2017 https://doi.org/10.3389/fphys.2017.00936.&lt;/ref&gt;

==External forces and the periodontium==

The periodontium exists for the purpose of supporting teeth during their function and it depends on the stimulation it receives from the function for preservation of its structure. Therefore, a constant state of balance always exists between the periodontal structures and the external forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0889540687902320 | doi=10.1016/0889-5406(87)90232-0 | volume=92 | title=Three-dimensional finite element analysis for stress in the periodontal tissue by orthodontic forces | journal=American Journal of Orthodontics and Dentofacial Orthopedics | pages=499–505 |last1=Tanne |first1=Kazuo |last2=Sakuda |first2=Mamoru |last3=Burstone |first3=Charles J. |date=December 1987 |issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alveolar bone undergoes constant physiologic [[Bone remodeling|remodeling]] in response to external forces, particularly occlusal forces. Bone is removed from areas where it is no longer needed and added to areas where it is needed. The socket wall reflects the responsiveness to the external forces. [[Osteoblast]]s and newly formed osteoid line the areas of tension, whereas lines of compression are lined by [[osteoclasts]]. The forces also influence the number, density, and alignment of [[trabecula]]e inside the bone. The bony trabeculae are aligned in the path of tensile and compressive stresses to provide maximum resistance to occlusal forces with a minimum of bone substance. When forces are increased, the bony trabeculae also increase in number and thickness and bone is added to the external surfaces.

The periodontal ligament depends on stimulation provided by function to preserve its structure. Within physiologic limits the PDL can accommodate increased function by increasing its width. Forces that exceed the adaptive capacity of the periodontium produce injury called ''trauma from occlusion''. When occlusal forces are reduced the PDL atrophies, appearing thinned. This phenomenon is called ''[[Atrophy|disuse atrophy]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1387">'''Porcine zona pellucida''' is a form of [[zona pellucida]] extracted from the ovaries of [[pig]]s, often referred to by the initials '''PZP'''. It is a popular source of [[antigen]]s for [[immunocontraception]].&lt;ref&gt;http://pzpinfo.org Wildlife forever
&lt;/ref&gt;

The zona pellucida is a thick membrane that surrounds the unfertilised eggs of mammals. In order for an egg to be fertilised, sperm must first bind to, and then penetrate the zona pellucida. When porcine (pig) zona pellucida is injected into other mammals, antibodies are produced which attach to that animal's zona pellucida, preventing the sperm from attaching to the egg, therefore preventing fertilisation.

Porcine zona pellucida has been used in [[wildlife contraceptive|wildlife contraception]] since the late 1980s. Animals with which PZP has been employed in this context include [[elephant]]s, [[Mustang (horse)|wild and/or feral horses]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fort.usgs.gov/wildhorsepopulations/contraception.asp |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-01-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130201111124/http://www.fort.usgs.gov/WildHorsePopulations/Contraception.asp |archivedate=2013-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Red Deer|elk]] and whitetailed [[deer]].

Revolution Health’s stated mission is to change healthcare by giving people the tools, information and support to manage their health and wellness actively.

Revolution Health Group was one of three companies in the [[Revolution LLC]] group of companies. Revolution Health is a health-related portal site and social network that some have described as akin to [[WebMD]]. The company portal  launched on January 20, 2007, using [[Ruby on Rails]] technology.

On October 25, 2007, the company dismissed 60 employees, or a quarter of its work-force, ostensibly as part of a [[restructuring]].

On May 23, 2008, RHG [[wikt:terminate|terminated]] its employer business unit and [[business-to-business]] unit as well as [[Layoff|laying off]] an additional 50 people.

On October 3, 2008, Revolution Health announced that it would [[Mergers and acquisitions|merge]] with Waterfront Media, which operates the Everyday Health Network, in a deal valued at $300 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/10/03/business/03deal.html?_r=2&amp;oref=slogin | work=The New York Times | title=Two Online Health Site Operators to Announce a Merger | first=Stephanie | last=Clifford | date=October 3, 2008 | accessdate=May 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The combined company was projected to have more than 20 million unique users*, according to a comScore research custom report.

'''[[Smoking]]''' '''in''' '''[[Canada]]''' is [[Smoking ban|banned]] in indoor  [[public spaces]] and workplaces (including [[restaurant]]s, [[Bar (establishment)|bar]]s, and [[casino]]s), by all [[Provinces and territories of Canada|territories and provinces]], and by the [[Government of Canada|federal government]]. As of 2010, legislation banning smoking within each of these jurisdictions is mostly consistent, despite the separate development of legislation by each jurisdiction. Notable variations between the jurisdictions include: whether, and in what circumstances ventilated smoking rooms are permitted; whether, and up to what distance away from a building is smoking banned outside of a building; and, whether smoking is banned in private vehicles occupied by children.

Some municipalities have [[By-law|bylaws]] restricting smoking further than the applicable national/provincial/territorial legislation.

The federal government's smoking ban in workplaces and on common carriers applies only to the federal government and to federally regulated businesses, such as airports. Smoking rooms are not permitted.
As of 2015, 13% of Canadians smoke. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.statcan.gc.ca/daily-quotidien/161109/cg-b002-eng.htm | title=Current cigarette smoking rates, Canada and the provinces, 2015| date=2016-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Ontario municipalities (cities, counties and regions) have passed smoke-free bylaws that are stricter than the provincial Smoke Free Ontario Act, such as City of Toronto, City of Ottawa, Region of Niagara, Region of Peel, City of Hamilton, and City of Barrie.

For example, as of 2 April 2012 in Ottawa, smoke free regulations prohibit smoking on all municipal properties, including parks, playgrounds, beaches, sports fields, fruit and vegetable markets and outdoor areas around City facilities. Outdoor restaurant and bar patios and terraces are also smoke free.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ottawa.ca/en/residents/public-health/healthy-living/smoke-free-regulations }}&lt;/ref&gt; Smoking has also been prohibited on all public transit (OC Transpo) properties including station platforms, since 2007. Fines for non-compliance range from $305 to $5000 as per the Provincial Offences Act.

Hamilton banned smoking on all municipal properties, including parks, playgrounds, beaches, sports fields on 31 May 2012.  Any person who contravenes a provision of this By-law is guilty of an offence and upon conviction is liable to a maximum fine of $10,000.00.

In Toronto, Municipal Code prohibits smoking within 9 meters of an entrance or exit of any building used by the public. Smoking is also prohibited in all public squares and within 9 meters of park amenities such as playgrounds, sports fields, skate parks, ski hills, picnic areas, swimming pools, theatre space, splash pads, washrooms, beaches, park zoos and farms, and service waiting lines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Legislation – Live Tobacco-Free – Healthy Lifestyle — City of Toronto |url=http://www1.toronto.ca/wps/portal/contentonly?vgnextoid=5cfb62ca69902410VgnVCM10000071d60f89RCRD |accessdate=30 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Reinhardt was born 1937 in [[Osnabrück]], Germany, and later emigrated to Canada where he received his [[Bachelor of Commerce]] degree from [[University of Saskatchewan]].&lt;ref name="nytcontrib"&gt;{{cite web|title=Uwe E. Reinhardt|url=https://www.nytimes.com/ref/business/economy/reinhardt.ready.html|work=Business Day: Economy|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later received a [[Ph.D.]] in [[economics]] from [[Yale University]]&lt;ref name="nytcontrib"/&gt; in 1970, with a thesis titled "An Economic Analysis of Physicians' Practices" under the supervision of [[Richard Ruggles]].&lt;ref name="Reinhardt"/&gt; He taught courses in [[economic theory]] and [[economic policy|policy]], [[accounting]], and [[health economics]] and [[health policy|policy]]. Reinhardt's scholarly work focused on economics and policy and included more far-reaching topics such as cost-benefit analyses of the [[Lockheed L-1011 TriStar]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Reinhardt | first1 = U. E. | authorlink1 = Uwe Reinhardt| title = Break-Even Analysis for Lockheed's Tri Star: An Application of Financial Theory | doi = 10.1111/j.1540-6261.1973.tb01408.x | journal = [[The Journal of Finance]]| volume = 28 | issue = 4 | pages = 821–838 | year = 1973 | jstor = 2978336| pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Space Shuttle]].{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} He died on November 14, 2017 in Princeton, NJ.

In July 2015 Reinhardt's 2013 syllabus and first lecture for a class titled "Introductory Korean Drama" received attention from several bloggers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blattman|first1=Christopher|title=Syllabus of the year|url=http://chrisblattman.com/2015/07/10/syllabus-of-the-year/|website=Chris Blattman|accessdate=10 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; By way of explanation, Reinhardt introduced the class by stating 
{{Quote|text=After the near‐collapse of the world’s financial system has shown that we economists really do not know how the world works, I am much too embarrassed to teach economics anymore, which I have done for many years. I will teach Modern Korean Drama instead. 
Although I have never been to Korea, I have watched Korean drama on a daily basis for over six years now. Therefore I can justly consider myself an expert in that subject.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reinhardt|first1=Uwe|title=Introductory Korean Drama|url=https://www.princeton.edu/~reinhard/pdfs/KOREAN_DRAMA_I.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} It was not clear whether Reinhardt actually intended to teach the course.

== Research ==
{{Refimprove section|date=July 2017}}
Reinhardt's research focused on [[health care prices|hospital pricing]], systems of health care around the world, [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] reform, and [[health care prices|health care spending]]. His work appeared in ''Health Affairs'', ''[[The New England Journal of Medicine]]'', ''[[The Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]]'', and ''[[BMJ|The British Medical Journal]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=&lt;nowiki&gt;Reinhardt, Uwe E[Author]&lt;/nowiki&gt;|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed?term=Reinhardt%2C%20Uwe%20E%5BAuthor%5D|work=PubMed - NCBI|accessdate=14 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a recent paper, Reinhardt discusses the obstacles to success of [[health savings account|consumer-directed health care]] in light of the lack of transparency in [[hospital]] pricing. He suggests several reforms that could lead to better information on [[health care prices|hospital pricing]] for consumer decision-making, including a national set of [[Diagnosis-related group]] weights to which each hospital could then apply its own conversion factor. Reinhardt's previous work on hospitals examined the [[tax advantage|tax]] and [[cost of capital|cost of equity capital]] advantages of [[non-profit hospital|not-for-profit hospitals]] over [[for-profit hospital]]s.

Reinhardt's scholarship analyzed the U.S. [[health care industry]] in relation to systems around the world. He argued that higher U.S. health spending is a result of higher U.S. per capita gross domestic product (GDP) as well as intricate and disjointed payment systems. Reinhardt's work on foreign [[health care system|systems of health care]] includes a 2004 analysis of [[Switzerland]] that appeared in ''The Journal of the American Medical Association''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Reinhardt | first1 = U. E. | authorlink1 = Uwe Reinhardt| title = The Swiss Health System | doi = 10.1001/jama.292.10.1227 | journal = [[JAMA (journal)|JAMA]]| volume = 292 | issue = 10 | pages = 1227–1231 | year = 2004 | pmid =  15353536| pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, Reinhardt argued that there is little correlation between the prevalence of consumer choice and the high quality of Swiss [[health care]].

In 2003, Reinhardt, along with 14 other prominent health policy experts and private health care industry leaders, signed an open letter arguing that [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] should lead the U.S. health care industry in [[Pay for performance (healthcare)|paying for performance]] by tying financial reimbursement to quality measures.

Reinhardt's work on [[health care prices|health care spending]] includes his argument that the aging of the U.S. population is not the primary cause of the growth in U.S. health care spending.

== Private industry and advisory roles ==
In addition to his university duties, Reinhardt was active as an advisor for government, non-profit organizations, and private industry and held directorships in various for-profit companies in the health industry. Reinhardt served on the Governing Council of the Institute of Medicine of the National Academy of Sciences between 1979 and 1982, after election to the Institute in 1978.&lt;ref name="Bio"&gt;{{cite web|last=|first=|date=|title=Uwe Reinhardt|url=http://kff.org/person/uwe-e-reinhardt/|work=Kaiser Family Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=27 Jul 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the Institute, he served on a number of study panels, including, the Committee on the Implications of For-Profit Medicine, the Committee on Technical Innovation in Medicine, the Committee on the Implications of a Physicians Surplus, and the Committee on the U.S. Physician Supply. In 1996, he was appointed to the Board of Health Care services of the Institute.

From 1986-1995, Reinhardt served three consecutive three-year terms as a Commissioner on the Physician Payment Review Commission (PPRC), established in 1986 by the Congress to advise it on issues related to the payment of physicians. Reinhardt serves as a Commissioner for the [[Kaiser Family Foundation]] Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kaiser Commission on Medicaid and the Uninsured|url=http://kff.org/about-kaiser-commission-on-medicaid-and-the-uninsured/|work=The Henry J. Kaiser Family Foundation}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Reinhardt was or is a member of numerous editorial boards, among them [[The New England Journal of Medicine]], [[The Journal of the American Medical Association|JAMA]], The Journal of Health Economics, the Milbank Quarterly, and Health Affairs.

Reinhardt served as a trustee of [[Duke University]] and the Tekla Family of Funds.&lt;ref name="nytcontrib"/&gt; He also served on the Boards of Directors of [[Boston Scientific|Boston Scientific Corporation]],&lt;ref name="nytcontrib"/&gt; a leading maker of medical devices, and [[Amerigroup|Amerigroup Corporation]], a large health insurer whose clients consist primarily of persons enrolled in Medicare. He served on the Board of Directors of [[Triad Hospitals|Triad Hospitals, Inc]], until that company was merged into [[Community Health Systems]] in 2007. He was a regular contributor to the ''New York Times''' Economix blog, where he wrote about economic matters, particularly the economics of health care.&lt;ref name="nytcontrib"/&gt;

===Role in Taiwan's healthcare system and award===

In 1989, as [[Taiwan]] was restructuring its healthcare system, Reinhardt persuaded its leaders to model it on those of [[Healthcare in Canada|Canada]] and [[Healthcare in Germany|Germany]]. [[Healthcare in Taiwan|Taiwan's system]] now provides universal care for 6.6% of [[GDP]]. For his contribution, in 2014 he was awarded the nation's Presidential Prize.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/15/obituaries/uwe-reinhardt-a-listened-to-voice-on-health-care-policy-dies-at-80.html NY Times Obituary for Uwe Reinhardt, Sam Price, 15 Nov 2017]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wws.princeton.edu/news-and-events/news/item/reinhardt-receives-honors-contributions-health-care-economics| "Reinhardt Receives Honors for Contributions to Health Care Economics," B.

=== Administration ===
In the 2009 ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' show "Sick Around 
America", Reinhardt criticized the United States for spending 24% of every health care dollar on [[Health administration|administration]], and pointed out that Canada spends less than half of the U.S. amount and Taiwan spends significantly less than Canada.&lt;ref name="Frontline"&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sickaroundamerica/ Sick Around America] ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]''. 46 minutes in. [https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/sickaroundamerica/etc/script.html Transcript] Accessed August 28, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Reinhardt faulted the seeming U.S. preference for an unwieldy "mishmash of private insurance plans" for the inefficiency.&lt;ref name="Frontline"/&gt; He said if the U.S. could spend half as much on administration, it would save more than enough money to cover all the uninsured.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27328">'''Whole body vibration''' ('''WBV''') is a generic term used when vibrations (mechanical oscillations) of any frequency are transferred to the human body. Humans are exposed to vibration through a contact surface that is in a mechanical vibrating state. Human's are generally exposed to many different forms of vibration in their daily lives. This could be a driver's seat, a moving train platform, through a power tool, a training platform, or one of countless other devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/title/human-response-to-vibration/oclc/55681295|title=Human response to vibration|last=Mansfield|first=Neil J|date=2005|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0415282390|location=Boca Raton, FL}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a potential form of [[occupational hazard]], particularly after years of exposure.

Whole body '''vibration training''' as a form of [[physical exercise]] can offer some fitness and health benefits, but it is not clear if it is as beneficial as regular physical exercise.&lt;ref name="mayo"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/fitness/expert-answers/whole-body-vibration/faq-20057958|title=Is whole-body vibration a good way to lose weight and improve fitness?| first = Edward R. | last = Laskowski | name-list-format = vanc | website = [[Mayo Clinic]]  |access-date=2018-03-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; A review in 2014 came to the conclusion that there is little and inconsistent evidence that acute and/or chronic whole body vibration could improve the performance of competitive and/or elite athletes.&lt;ref name="eurjhm"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.eurjhm.com/index.php/eurjhm/article/view/339|title=Whole body vibration and athletic performance: A scoping review|author=Tibor Hortobágyi, Urs Granacher, Miguel Fernandez-del-Olmo|journal=European Journal of Human Movement|volume=33|year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The minimization of discomfort due to vehicle vibration is important in the automotive industry where ride quality is important.

===Workplace exposure===
[[File:Lateral X-ray of lumbar spine spondylosis.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Projectional radiography|X-ray]] of [[spondylosis]] of the [[lumbar spine]].]]
[[Occupational safety and health|Workplace exposures]] to whole-body vibrations for long durations can lead to [[Human musculoskeletal system|musculoskeletal]] problems of many kinds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Magnusson ML, Pope MH, Wilder DG, Areskoug B | title = Are occupational drivers at an increased risk for developing musculoskeletal disorders? | journal = Spine | volume = 21 | issue = 6 | pages = 710–7 | date = March 1996 | pmid = 8882693 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Problems of the neck and lower back in particular can be common for operators of heavy equipment including construction, forestry, agriculture, and trucking. Other occupations where whole-body vibrations may be present include operatorsof aircraft, workers on-board sea vessels, drivers of public transportation including trains and buses among others.

Farmers with long-term exposure to whole body vibration and mechanical shocks have a higher prevalence of [[back pain]] (compared to those not exposed to vibration), and the prevalence increases with vibration dose.&lt;ref name="Solecki"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Solecki L | title = [Low back pain among farmers exposed to whole body vibration: a literature review] | journal = Medycyna Pracy | volume = 62 | issue = 2 | pages = 187–202 | year = 2011 | pmid = 21698878 | pmc = | doi = | url = https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/eutils/elink.fcgi?dbfrom=pubmed&amp;tool=sumsearch.org/cite&amp;retmode=ref&amp;cmd=prlinks&amp;id=21698878 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Long-term exposure affecting the whole body leads to spinal degeneration ([[spondylosis]]) and increased risk of low back pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pope MH, Wilder DG, Magnusson ML | title = A review of studies on seated whole body vibration and low back pain | journal = Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine | volume = 213 | issue = 6 | pages = 435–46 | date = 1999 | pmid = 10635692 | doi = 10.1243/0954411991535040 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Wilder DG, Pope MH | title = Epidemiological and aetiological aspects of low back pain in vibration environments - an update | journal = Clinical Biomechanics | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 61–73 | date = March 1996 | pmid = 11415601 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Factors that affect the occupational exposure to whole-body vibration include the frequency of vibrations, the magnitude of vibrations, the daily exposure to vibrations, the standing or seating posture of the operator, the direction of the vibration, and how tightly coupled the human is to the source of the vibration.&lt;ref name = "Griffin_1990"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of human vibration | vauthors = Griffin MJ | date=1990|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780123030405|location=London|oclc=21591126}}&lt;/ref&gt; Exposure limits and estimates have been characterized in the ISO 2631-1&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.iso.org/standard/7612.html|title=ISO 2631-1:1997 - Mechanical vibration and shock &amp;ndash; Evaluation of human exposure to whole-body vibration &amp;ndash; Part 1: General requirements|website=www.iso.org|access-date=2018-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; for whole-body vibration. Measurements of vibration exposure are usually taken at the human/vibration interface.

=== Patient transport ===
Injured patients can be exposed to shocks and vibrations during transport which can worsen patient conditions due to involuntary motions of the body. Many forms of immobilization devices are used to limit this motion with varying degrees of success.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Mahshidfar B, Mofidi M, Yari AR, Mehrsorosh S | title = Long backboard versus vacuum mattress splint to immobilize whole spine in trauma victims in the field: a randomized clinical trial | journal = Prehospital and Disaster Medicine | volume = 28 | issue = 5 | pages = 462–5 | date = October 2013 | pmid = 23746392 | doi = 10.1017/S1049023X13008637 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rahmatalla S, DeShaw J, Stilley J, Denning G, Jennissen C | title = Comparing the Efficacy of Methods for Immobilizing the Thoracic-Lumbar Spine | journal = Air Medical Journal | volume = 37 | issue = 3 | pages = 178–185 | date = May 2018 | pmid = 29735231 | doi = 10.1016/j.amj.2018.02.002 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sundstrøm T, Asbjørnsen H, Habiba S, Sunde GA, Wester K | title = Prehospital use of cervical collars in trauma patients: a critical review | journal = Journal of Neurotrauma | volume = 31 | issue = 6 | pages = 531–40 | date = March 2014 | pmid = 23962031 | pmc = 3949434 | doi = 10.1089/neu.2013.3094 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Common modes of patient transport include hand carried stretcher ([[Litter (rescue basket)|litter]]), ground [[ambulance]], and [[air medical services]] which all contain multiple forms of shocks and whole-body vibrations.

=== Measurement ===
Measurements are taken with accelerometers to estimate the amount of vibration exposure to the human body. These measurements are taken at the human body or at the vibration source or surface.&lt;ref name = "Griffin_1990" /&gt; Measurements of different directions are taken to relate the motion direction with the response of the human body.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://search.proquest.com/openview/9122b728e987f0b6da45e4586c98772e/1?pq-origsite=gscholar&amp;cbl=18750&amp;diss=y|title=New methodologies for evaluating human biodynamic response and discomfort during seated whole-body vibration considering multiple postures - ProQuest|website=search.proquest.com|access-date=2018-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, transfer functions can be used to determine the human response to the vibration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hinz B, Menzel G, Blüthner R, Seidel H | title = Seat-to-head transfer function of seated men--determination with single and three axis excitations at different magnitudes | journal = Industrial Health | volume = 48 | issue = 5 | pages = 565–83 | date = 2010 | pmid = 20953074 | doi = 10.2486/indhealth.MSWBVI-03 | url = https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/indhealth/48/5/48_MSWBVI-03/_article/-char/en }}&lt;/ref&gt; Measurement techniques for estimating exposures to whole body vibrations and hand-arm vibration have been developed in International Standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.iso.org/standard/70648.html | title=ISO 8041-1:2017 - Human response to vibration &amp;ndash; Measuring instrumentation &amp;ndash; Part 1: General purpose vibration meters|website=www.iso.org }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/ISO-5349-2-Measurement-hand-transmitted-measurement/dp/B000Y2T50A/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1526962106&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=ISO+5349-2|title=ISO 5349-2:2001, Mechanical vibration - Measurement and evaluation of human exposure to hand-transmitted vibration - Part 2: Practical guidance for measurement at the workplace| author = ISO/TC 108/SC4|date=2007-08-23|publisher=Multiple.

==Vibration training==
Vibration training is the deliberate exposure to the body of varying frequencies/amplitudes/forces using certain joint angles for any limited time (approximately 1 minute sets). It is also known as '''vibration therapy''','''vibrotherapy''', '''biomechanical stimulation''' ('''BMS'''), '''mechanostimulation''' and '''biomechanical oscillation''' ('''BMO'''). It employs low amplitude, low frequency mechanical stimulation. It can be pivotal/oscillating (vibrating from side to side) or lineal (vibrating up and down).

===History===

The immediate predecessor of modern vibration training is Rhythmic Neuromuscular Stimulation (RNS). In former [[East Germany]] Biermann was experimenting with the use of cyclic massage and its effects on trunk flexion back in the sixties (''Biermann, 1960''&lt;ref name="biermann60"&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Biermann|first1=W.|title=Influence of cycloid vibration massage on trunk flexion|url=|journal=American Journal of Physical Medicine|volume=1960|issue=39|pages=219–224}}&lt;/ref&gt;).

The technique has been tested on turkeys in the hope of finding a benefit that could be used for astronauts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://science1.nasa.gov/science-news/science-at-nasa/2001/ast02nov_1/|title=Good Vibrations}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the used technology an engineering issues came into play when they tried to upgrade the machine to take the weight of a human being. Once the vibration intensity grew strong enough to lift over 40&amp;nbsp;kg, fractures appeared in the steel. Using a different mechnanical stimulation approach the first bedrest study using a vibration training device for humans was done by the European Space Agency (ESA) in 2003 in Berlin&lt;ref&gt;Rittweger J., Felsenberg D.: ''Resistive vibration exercise prevents bone loss during 8 weeks of strict bed rest in healthy male subjects: results from the Berlin Bed Rest (BBR) study'', 26th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research; October 2004; Seattle&lt;/ref&gt; (Berlin Bedrest Study, BBR). The same technology was then used in several parabolic flight campaigns of the DLR (German Aerospace Agency) starting in 2006 where the feasibility of use of a lightweight vibration training device under microgravity conditions was demonstrated and ein 2009 and 2010 where basic research on influence of microgravity on vibration training effects was investigated.&lt;ref name="Kramer13"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kramer A, Gollhofer A, Ritzmann R | title = Acute exposure to microgravity does not influence the H-reflex with or without whole body vibration and does not cause vibration-specific changes in muscular activity | journal = Journal of Electromyography and Kinesiology | volume = 23 | issue = 4 | pages = 872–8 | date = August 2013 | pmid = 23541330 | doi = 10.1016/j.jelekin.2013.02.010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ritzmann,16"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Ritzmann R, Krause A, Freyler K, Gollhofer A|year=2016|title=Gravity and Neuronal Adaptation - Neurophysiology of Reflexes from Hypo- to Hypergravity Conditions|journal=Microgravity Sci. Technol.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NASA, since 1961, has been doing tests at adding light vibrations to pre-existing exercise equipment’s and systems to minimize vibration transmission of existing exercise devices to the space station like the Treadmill Vibration Isolation System (TVIS) and the Cycle Ergometer Vibration Isolation System (CEVIS). Any company referencing NASA directly in its marketing campaigns is highly misleading and has no relevance to the discipline of vibration training.

The first Galileo machine patent was filed in 1996 in the same year the first Galileo device was commercially available.&lt;ref name="Bosco99b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bosco C, Colli R, Introini E, Cardinale M, Tsarpela O, Madella A, Tihanyi J, Viru A | title = Adaptive responses of human skeletal muscle to vibration exposure | journal = Clinical Physiology | volume = 19 | issue = 2 | pages = 183–7 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10200901 | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2281.1999.00155.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bosco98c"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Bosco C, Cardinale M, Tsarpela O, Colli R, Tihanyi J, Ducillard C, Viru A|year=1998|title=The Influence of Whole Body Vibration on Jumping Performance|url=http://amplitudevibration.com/images/uploads/Influence_of_WBV_on_Jumping_Height.pdf|journal=Biology of Sport|volume=15|issue=3|pages=157–164|name-list-format=vanc}}{{dead link|date=January 2017|bot=InternetArchiveBot|fix-attempted=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996 the first Galileo vibrating dumbbell patent was filed.&lt;ref name="Bosco99a"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Bosco C, Cardinale M, Tsarpela O | title = Influence of vibration on mechanical power and electromyogram activity in human arm flexor muscles | journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology and Occupational Physiology | volume = 79 | issue = 4 | pages = 306–11 | date = March 1999 | pmid = 10090628 | doi = 10.1007/s004210050512 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Training effects===
According to [[Mayo Clinic]], whole body vibration can offer some fitness and health benefits, but it is not clear if it is as beneficial as regular physical exercise.&lt;ref name=mayo/&gt; A review in 2014 came to the conclusion that there is little and inconsistent evidence that acute and/or chronic whole body vibration could improve the performance of competitive and/or elite athletes.&lt;ref name=eurjhm/&gt;

[[Cochrane review]]s have concluded that there is insufficient evidence of effect of whole body vibration training on functional performance of people with [[neurodegenerative disease]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD009097/MOVEMENT_whole-body-vibration-platform-training-in-patients-with-neurodegenerative-diseases|title=Whole-body vibration platform training in patients with neurodegenerative diseases|website=[[Cochrane collaboration]]|date=2012-02-15|author=Sitjà Rabert M, Rigau Comas D, Fort Vanmeerhaeghe A, Santoyo Medina C, Roqué i Figuls M, Romero-Rodríguez D, Bonfill Cosp}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in disease-related problems in people with [[fibromyalgia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cochrane.org/CD011755/MUSKEL_whole-body-vibration-training-adults-fibromyalgia|title=Whole body vibration training for adults with fibromyalgia|website=[[Cochrane collaboration]]|date=2017-09-26|author=Bidonde J, Busch AJ, van der Spuy I, Tupper S, Kim SY, Boden C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Vibrating platform types===

Vibrating platforms fall into different, distinct categories. The type of platform used is a moderator of the effect and result of the training or therapy performed (''Marin PJ, Rhea MR, 2010''&lt;ref name="marin2010"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Marín PJ, Rhea MR | title = Effects of vibration training on muscle power: a meta-analysis | journal = Journal of Strength and Conditioning Research | volume = 24 | issue = 3 | pages = 871–8 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20145554 | doi = 10.1519/JSC.0b013e3181c7c6f0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;). Main categories of machine types are: 
# High Energy Lineal, found mostly in commercial vibration training studios and gyms. The vibration direction is lineal/upward
# Premium Speed Pivotal, (teeter-totter movement) used for physiotherapy work at lower speeds and exercise workouts at “premium” speed, up to 30&amp;nbsp;Hz. Both commercial and home units are available. 
# Medium Energy Lineal, the majority of lineal platforms produced. These are usually made of plastic; some have 3-D vibration which is low quality. 
# Low Speed Pivotal units. 
Other machine types are low Energy/Low amplitude lineal and Low energy/High amplitude lineal.

Concerning the z-movements, two main types of system can be distinguished (''Marin PJ et al. 2010'',&lt;ref name="marin2010"/&gt; ''Rittweger 2010'',&lt;ref name="Rittweger10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rittweger J | title = Vibration as an exercise modality: how it may work, and what its potential might be | journal = European Journal of Applied Physiology | volume = 108 | issue = 5 | pages = 877–904 | date = March 2010 | pmid = 20012646 | doi = 10.1007/s00421-009-1303-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Rauch 2010''&lt;ref name="Rauch10"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rauch F, Sievanen H, Boonen S, Cardinale M, Degens H, Felsenberg D, Roth J, Schoenau E, Verschueren S, Rittweger J | title = Reporting whole-body vibration intervention studies: recommendations of the International Society of Musculoskeletal and Neuronal Interactions | journal = Journal of Musculoskeletal &amp; Neuronal Interactions | volume = 10 | issue = 3 | pages = 193–8 | date = September 2010 | pmid = 20811143 | author11 = International Society of Musculoskeletal Neuronal Interactions }}&lt;/ref&gt;) :
* Side alternating (pivotal) systems, operating like a see-saw and hence mimicking the human gait where one foot is always moving upwards and the other one downwards, and
* Linear systems where the whole platform is mainly doing the same motion, respectively: both feet are moved upwards or downwards at the same time.
Systems with side alternation usually have a larger amplitude of oscillation and a frequency range of about 5&amp;nbsp;Hz to 40&amp;nbsp;Hz. Linear/upright systems have lower amplitudes but higher frequencies in the range of 20&amp;nbsp;Hz to 50&amp;nbsp;Hz.
Despite the larger amplitudes of side-alternating systems, the vibration (acceleration) transmitted to the head is significantly smaller than in non side-alternating systems (''Abercromby et al. 2007''&lt;ref name="Abercromby07b"/&gt;) while at the same time muscle activation even at identical vibration parameters are increased in pivotal systems.&lt;ref name="Ritzmann13"&gt;Ritzmann R, Gollhofer A, Kramer A: ''The influence of vibration type, frequency, body position and additional load on the neuromuscular activity during whole body vibration.'', European Journal of Applied Physiology, (113):1-11, 2013; {{PMID|22538279}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mechanical stimulation generates acceleration forces acting on the body. These forces cause the muscles to lengthen, and this signal is received by the muscle spindle, a small organ in the muscle. This spindle transmits the signal through the [[central nervous system]] to the muscles involved (''Abercromby et al. 2007'',&lt;ref name="Abercromby07b"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Abercromby AF, Amonette WE, Layne CS, McFarlin BK, Hinman MR, Paloski WH | title = Vibration exposure and biodynamic responses during whole-body vibration training | journal = Medicine and Science in Sports and Exercise | volume = 39 | issue = 10 | pages = 1794–800 | date = October 2007 | pmid = 17909407 | doi = 10.1249/mss.0b013e3181238a0f }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Burkhardt 2006''&lt;ref name="Burkhardt06"&gt;Burkhardt A.: ''Vibrationstraining in der Physiotherapie - Wippen mit Wirkung'', Physiopraxis 9/06, s.22.25, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;).

'''Power Plate''' is a brand of vibrating platform consisting of a vibrating base, which may vibrate up and down approximately {{convert|1|to|2|mm|thou}} (1/16") 25 to 50 times per second.&lt;ref name="bautmans"&gt;{{cite journal| vauthors = Bautmans I, Van Hees E, Lemper JC, Mets T | title = The feasibility of Whole Body Vibration in institutionalised elderly persons and its influence on muscle performance, balance and mobility: a randomised controlled trial [ISRCTN62535013] | journal = BMC Geriatrics | volume = 5 | pages = 17 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16372905 | pmc = 1368976 | doi = 10.1186/1471-2318-5-17 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1471-2318/5/17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The machine is large enough to accommodate a person in [[deep squat]]. Traditional exercises such as squats and push-ups can be done on the vibrating base.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Heyward | first = Vivian H | name-list-format = vanc | title = Advanced fitness assessment and exercise prescription | publisher = Human Kinetics | year = 2006 | pages = 159 | isbn = 978-0-7360-5732-5 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=4GpPGl-79HgC&amp;pg=PA159&amp;dq="power+plate"+vibration }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Galileo''' (in the US up until 2014 also available as '''Vibraflex''') is a brand of vibration training platforms used as [[exercise equipment]] as well as for therapeutic use. It consists of a vibration platform which vibrates sinusoidal side alternating like a see-saw. Depending on the device size it oscillates with an amplitude of up to 6&amp;nbsp;mm (equivalent to a peak to peak distance of 12&amp;nbsp;mm) and a frequency of 5&amp;nbsp;Hz to 40&amp;nbsp;Hz (5 to 40 repetitions per second). Galileo is manufactured in Germany by the German company Novotec Medical GmbH. Since 2004 Galileo is also available as a medical device.

The base plate of Galileo vibration training devices is moving like a see-saw. This side alternating motion is supposed to mimic human gait in order to utilize nearly physiological motion patterns close to the side alternating human gait. The side alternation causes the hip to tilt which requires the contra lateral muscles of the back to be activated – while one leg is lifted the other drops.&lt;ref name="Rittweger02"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rittweger J, Just K, Kautzsch K, Reeg P, Felsenberg D | title = Treatment of chronic lower back pain with lumbar extension and whole-body vibration exercise: a randomized controlled trial | journal = Spine | volume = 27 | issue = 17 | pages = 1829–34 | date = September 2002 | pmid = 12221343 | doi = 10.1097/00007632-200209010-00003 | citeseerx = 10.1.1.484.6691 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared to vertically vibrating devices the side alternating motion results in very low acceleration acting on the centre of gravity of the upper body and the head.&lt;ref name="Pel09"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Pel JJ, Bagheri J, van Dam LM, van den Berg-Emons HJ, Horemans HL, Stam HJ, van der Steen J | title = Platform accelerations of three different whole-body vibration devices and the transmission of vertical vibrations to the lower limbs | journal = Medical Engineering &amp; Physics | volume = 31 | issue = 8 | pages = 937–44 | date = October 2009 | pmid = 19523867 | doi = 10.1016/j.medengphy.2009.05.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Abercromby07b"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spitzenpfeil06"&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Spitzenpfeil P, Stritzker M, Kirchbichler A, Tusker F, Hartmann U, Hartard H | year = 2006 | title = Mechanical impacts to the human body by different vibration training devices | url = | journal = Journal of Biomechanics | volume = 39 | issue = Suppl 1 | page = 196 | doi = 10.1016/S0021-9290(06)83707-3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
