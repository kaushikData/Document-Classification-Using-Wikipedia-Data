Latin American G-15 nations include [[Argentina]], [[Brazil]], [[Chile]],  [[Jamaica]], [[Mexico]], [[Peru]] and [[Venezuela]].&lt;ref&gt;Kuwait News Agency (KUNA): [http://www.kuna.net.kw/NewsAgenciesPublicSite/ArticleDetails.aspx?Language=en&amp;id=1467329  "Khatami leaves &lt;nowiki&gt;[for]&lt;/nowiki&gt; Venezuela to participate in G-15 summit."] February 26, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
{{Main|Group of 15}}
The Group of 15 was established at the Ninth [[Non-Aligned Movement]] summit in [[Belgrade]], [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] in September 1989.  The name of the group is unchanging, but its composition has expanded to 18 countries.&lt;ref name="prematillake"&gt;Prematillake, Tharindu. [http://www.nation.lk/2010/05/23/newsfe5.htm "Lanka Heads Powerful G-15 Serving Collective Interests,"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100528010135/http://www.nation.lk/2010/05/23/newsfe5.htm |date=2010-05-28 }} ''The Nation'' (Colombo). May 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The G-15 is composed of countries from Africa, Asia, North America and South America. These non-aligned nations joined together to create a forum to foster cooperation and develop information which can be presented to other international groups, such as the [[World Trade Organization]] and the [[G8|Group of Eight]]. The G-15 nations have a common goal of enhanced growth and prosperity. The group aims to encourage cooperation among [[developing country|developing countries]] in the areas of investment, trade, and technology.&lt;ref name="prematillake"/&gt;

==Leaders at the summit==
Those G-15 nations represented at the summit were Algeria, Argentina, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Iran,  Jamaica, Kenya, Malaysia, Mexico, Nigeria, Peru, Senegal, Sri Lanka, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe. The group's membership has expanded to 18 countries, but the name has remained unchanged.&lt;ref&gt;Afrasiabi, Kaveh L.

==Priorities==
The G-15 nations perceive an ongoing need to expand dialogue with the [[G8]] nations.  The G-15 want to help bridge the gap between developing countries and the more developed and industrialized nations.&lt;ref name="prematillake"/&gt;  For example, the G-15 converted this venue into an opportunity to express concern about the delays and limited progress in achieving the [[Millennium Development Goals]].&lt;ref name="joint"/&gt;

==Issues==
G-15 nations are united by shared perceptions of global economic issues; and the G-15 provides a structure for developing common strategies for dealing with these issues.&lt;ref name="chauhan"&gt;Chauhan, Sandeep. {{Google books|yzlOIlCHGHwC|''Demand for New International Economic Order''|page=129}} (p. 129)&lt;/ref&gt;

G15 nations have joined together in hopes of escaping from the more polemical atmosphere in other multinational groups and organizations, such as the [[Group of 77]] (G-77).&lt;ref name="chauhan"/&gt;

==Schedule and agenda==
The summit provides an opportunity to focus on the importance of cooperation in facing challenges of food, energy, climate change, health and trade. Delegations from 19 nations met to discuss energy cooperation between member states and fighting poverty.&lt;ref&gt;[http://edition.cnn.com/2004/WORLD/meast/02/28/iran.khatami.reut/  "Injustice breeds terrorism, says Iran's Khatami,"] CNN World.

The '''2006 Russian march''' ({{lang-ru|link=no|Русский марш}}, ''[[Romanization of Russian|Russkiy marsh]]'') was an extensive enterprise on organizing the wide-ranging [[Russian nationalism|nationalist]] public mass demonstration, one of annual [[Russian March|Russian marches]] in several major Russian cities under the slogan "it's our country",&lt;ref name="Yahoo News"&gt;[http://uk.news.yahoo.com/31102006/325/moscow-mayor-bans-racist-russian-march-nazi-show.html UK.News.Yahoo.com Moscow mayor bans racist Russian march as Nazi show]{{dead link|date=December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; attached to 4 November 2006, the [[Unity Day (Russia)|Day of National Unity]]. Among the most notable participants were the [[Movement Against Illegal Immigration]], the main organiser of rallies, [[Eurasia Party|Eurasian Youth Union]], the Communist Youth Vanguard, [[Dmitry Demushkin]], the National State Party of Russia and the [[State Duma]] deputy Nikolay Kuryanovich who was excluded from the [[Liberal Democratic Party of Russia]] for his sympathy with the March. Other participants were the [[Pamyat|National Patriotic Front "Memory"]], the "Truth" Community, the [[Russian National Union]], the Russian Social Movement and the "Russian Order" Movement.&lt;ref name="RIA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rian.ru/spravka/20061031/55271836.html |title=РИА Новости – Справки – "Русский марш".

Despite condemning the xenophobic nature of The March, the Deputy Chief of the Moscow branch of [[Yabloko]] [[Alexey Navalny]] advocated for the permission of the event in the framework of freedom of assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.svobodanews.ru/Article/2006/11/01/20061101182534203.html SvobodaNews.ru Московское «Яблоко» поддержало проведение «Русского марша»] Argued as following: "It is clearly stated in the preamble of our declaration that the Yabloko Party thoroughly and sharply opposes any national and racial discord and any [[xenophobia]]. However in this case, when we know... that the Constitution guarantees to us the right to gather peacefully and without a weapon, we see that in these conditions the prohibition of the Russian March as it was announced, provokes the organisers to some activities which could end not so good. Thus we appeal to the Moscow city administration... for permission..."&lt;/ref&gt;

A separate mass-meeting called the Right March have been organized by several [[Russian Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] movements (the National Council, the Orthodox Standard Bearers Union and The Bastion), which declared their independent intentions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=21.10.2006 |url=http://www.pravda.ru/politics/parties/21-10-2006/200825-0 |title=Оранжевые свастики "Русского марша" |publisher=Pravda.ru |date=21 October 2006 |accessdate=4 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
The first Russian March took place on 4 November 2005 and was the first legal far-right mass meeting in modern Russian history.&lt;ref name="RIA"/&gt; Both rallies have been inspired by expulsion of Polish-Lithuanian forces from the [[Moscow Kremlin]] during the [[Polish–Muscovite War (1605–1618)|Russo-Polish War of 1605–1618]] on 22 October [[Old Style|O.S.]] (4 November [[New Style|N.S.]]), which was subsequently marked by [[tsar]] in 1612 as a feast day.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} The preparations for 2006 March have been launched by the Action Against Illegal Immigrantion and Eurasian Youth Union. Due to this the march has had two different names and two different schedules.&lt;ref name="Specnaz"/&gt;

[[File:Tibetan monks visiting Britain in 1924.jpg|thumb|The Tibetan "lamas" in [[London]], December 1924]]
The '''Affair of the Dancing Lamas''' was an Anglo–Tibetan diplomatic controversy stemming mainly from the visit to Britain in 1924–25 of a party of Tibetan monks (only one of whom was a [[lama]]) as part of a publicity stunt for ''[[The Epic of Everest]]'' – the official film of the [[1924 British Mount Everest Expedition]].

The [[Dalai Lama]] and the government of Tibet felt that the film and the pseudo-religious performances required of the monks ridiculed Tibetan culture – as a diplomatic protest they banned future Everest expeditions. The film had been the responsibility of [[John Baptist Lucius Noel|John Noel]], the expedition's photographer, but the mountaineering establishment was closely involved and to avoid embarrassment they shifted the blame for the ban on expeditions onto [[John de Vars Hazard]], another member of the team, who had gone exploring off the authorised route. The true cause of the diplomatic fuss was kept secret and Hazard remained the scapegoat for over fifty years.

Historically, Tibet had not been willing to allow foreign explorers into the country but the [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition|1921 British expedition]] had been permitted in connection with an arms deal. Monastic opposition to the arms and the expeditions increased until by 1925 the country was close to revolution. The Tibetan army chief was closely associated with the British and the debacle was probably partly responsible for his fall from grace in 1925. The subsequent decline of military influence within the Tibetan government may have made the country more vulnerable to the [[Incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China|Chinese takeover in 1950]].

==Background==

===Diplomatic===

[[File:Francis Younghusband 1905.jpg|thumb|upright|Francis Younghusband, about 1905]]
[[File:George Curzon2.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Lord Curzon, about 1902]]
Fearing Russian military intervention into Tibet, in 1904 the [[British Raj]] made a [[British expedition to Tibet|military incursion into Tibet]] led by [[Francis Younghusband]]. Sometimes known as the "Mission to Lhasa", this was largely instigated by [[George Curzon, 1st Marquess Curzon of Kedleston|Lord Curzon]], the [[Viceroy of India]].{{sfnp|Hansen|1996|p=717}} The ensuing [[Treaty of Lhasa|1904 treaty]] and [[Convention Between Great Britain and China Respecting Tibet|1906 convention]] formalised Chinese [[suzerainty]] over Tibet while declaring that it would permit no foreign interventions (including by Russia or Britain). In 1910 China invaded Tibet and to escape the savagery the [[13th Dalai Lama|Dalai Lama]] fled to [[Sikkim]], where he was sheltered by the British. Sikkim, sandwiched between India and Tibet, was under firm British protection and was only nominally an independent state.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=118–120}}

[[File:13th Dalai Lama, Sir Charles Bell and Maharaj Kumar Sidkeong Trul-ku.jpg|thumb|upright|Charles Bell, [[Sidkeong Tulku Namgyal]] and [[Thubten Gyatso]] (l–r), in 1910]]
Following the [[Xinhai Revolution]], which established the  [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] in 1912, China withdrew from Tibet. The Dalai Lama returned to [[Lhasa (prefecture-level city)|Lhasa]] and Britain briefly supplied armaments to what it now regarded as an independent country but the [[World War I|First World War]] in Europe led to Britain losing interest.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=120–122}} By 1919 a renewed fear of Russia and China felt by both Britain and Tibet led to a mutual desire for closer diplomatic relations. [[Charles Alfred Bell|Charles Bell]], Britain's political representative in Sikkim, was sent to Lhasa at the end of 1920 to negotiate. He was the first European to be invited to Lhasa and he stayed for almost a whole year.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=123-124}} Bell and [[13th Dalai Lama|Thubten Gyatso]], the [[Dalai Lama]], developed a warm personal friendship.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=112–113}} In 1921, Britain again started supplying Tibet with arms, ammunition, military support and training.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=123-124}}

===British aspirations towards Mount Everest===

On his 1904 military mission, Younghusband had seen [[Mount Everest]], the highest mountain in the world. and had enthused Curzon with the idea of a grand British imperial expedition to make the [[first ascent]] of the mountain. Eventually this led to Britain's magisterial [[Alpine Club (UK)|Alpine Club]] adopting the idea in celebration of its 1907 golden jubilee.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=63–74}} Mount Everest lies on the border between Nepal and Tibet but neither country would allow entry to foreign expeditions. The [[Secretary of State for India]] refused to request permission from Tibet and then the [[World War I|1914–18 War]] intervened.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=74–75}}

In 1913 [[John Baptist Lucius Noel|John Noel]] had entered Tibet clandestinely and had reached to within forty miles of Mount Everest, closer than any other foreigner before him.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=80–83}} After the war, in an attempt to inject new impetus, Noel was invited to address a joint meeting of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] and the Alpine Club. Noel's 1919 talk was inspirational and the two societies again started lobbying.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=86–100}} Younghusband (soon to become president of the RGS) wrote to the Secretary of State for India to see if Tibet could be asked for permission. Even with the political backing of Lord Curzon, who was now Britain's [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] (and who had been RGS president from 1911 to 1914), Younghusband only received lukewarm support from Whitehall but was still able to send [[Charles Howard-Bury]] to India to try to take things forward. Howard-Bury met the Viceroy of India, [[Frederic Thesiger, 1st Viscount Chelmsford|Lord Chelmsford]], who was sympathetic but said he could do nothing while negotiations with Tibet were pending, although he suggested that Charles Bell should be approached.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=112–113}} By serendipity, Howard-Bury met Bell shortly before Bell's diplomatic visit to Lhasa. As a small piece in the diplomatic jigsaw, Bell negotiated that British expeditions be allowed into Tibet, starting with the [[1921 British Mount Everest reconnaissance expedition]].{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=123–124}} However, in the minds of the Tibetan elite, Everest expeditions became associated with military expansionism within the country.{{sfnp|Hansen|1996|p=719}}

Early in 1921 the [[Mount Everest Committee]] was set up jointly by the Royal Geographical Society and the Alpine Club to manage all future British expeditions &amp;ndash; Younghusband was appointed chairman.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=125–126}}

===1922 and 1924 Mount Everest expeditions===

[[File:John Noel with filming equipment, 1922.jpg|thumb|left|Noel filming from the [[North Col]] in 1922. In 1924 he was able to use a {{convert|20|in|mm|adj=on}} Cooke lens.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=484}}]]
John Noel was photographer on the [[1922 British Mount Everest expedition|1922 Everest expedition]] and was made responsible for producing the subsequent official film, ''Climbing Mount Everest''.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=561}} Shown in cinemas around Britain it had been a reasonable success. When the [[1924 British Mount Everest expedition|1924 expedition]] was being planned Noel offered to fund £8,000 of the estimated £9,000 total cost of the expedition if he was allowed to make a second film and retain all the rights to it and other photography.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=561}}{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|p=147}} Noel, who was quite a showman, was determined to make the film a success and he planned filming in such a way that he could produce a mountaineering epic if the summit attempt succeeded or a Tibet travelogue if it failed.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=561}}

On 8 June 1924 [[George Mallory|Mallory]] and [[Andrew Irvine (mountaineer)|Irvine]] set off for the summit, never to return.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=2}}

For those on the expedition at the time, the loss of Mallory and Irvine did not seem like the magnificent tragedy it was soon to become.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=550–554}} Noel raced back to civilisation to start work on his film; [[John de Vars Hazard|John Hazard]] went to the [[West Rongbuk Glacier]] to do further surveying but then went beyond his remit by going north to [[Lhatse (town)|Lhatse]] and the upper part of the [[Yarlung Tsangpo River|Tsangpo River]]; the others went to the [[Rongshar Valley]]&lt;ref group=note&gt;The Rongshar Valley is near the Nepalese border close to [[Nangpa La]].&lt;/ref&gt; to recuperate before the long trek home.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=557}}{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|p=145}}{{sfnp|Salkeld|1996|p=226}} In Britain matters were treated differently – the climbers' memorial service in [[St Paul's Cathedral]] was attended by [[King George V]], the [[Edward VIII|Prince of Wales]] and the [[George VI|Duke of York]].{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=557}}

==''The Epic of Everest''==

''[[The Times]]'' had the scoop headline "Everest: The Last Climb: Hopes That Summit Was Reached", and Noel's 1924 film, according to [[Wade Davis (anthropologist)|Wade Davis]], "elevated Mallory ... into the realm of the Titans".{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=557, 384}} Noel's film ''The Epic of Everest: The Immortal Film Record of This Historic Expedition'' had its premiere at the [[New Scala Theatre]] on 8 December 1924.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=561}}{{refn|group=note|A trailer can be viewed online and there is a 2013 review.{{sfnp|BFI Trailers|2013}}{{sfnp|Horell|2013}}}}

A production company ''Explorers' Films'', with Younghusband as chairman, had been set up to make the film.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=468}} Because there was no film footage high on the mountain and it was not known if the summit had been reached, Noel planned a total theatrical experience. The stage setting was a Tibetan courtyard with shimmering Himalayan peaks painted on the backdrop. To provide what Noel called "large doses of local colour", before the film started a group of monks was to come on stage equipped with ethnic accoutrements to perform pseudo-religious music, chanting and dance.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=561–562}}{{refn|group=note|A newsreel of the monks in Britain is available online.{{sfnp|British Pathé|1924}}}} The headline in the ''Daily Sketch'' "High Dignitaries of Tibetan Church Reach London; Bishop to dance on Stage; Music from Skulls" was not couched in terms that the Tibetan authorities would wish for. The performers were genuinely monks (despite the publicity proclaiming "seven lamas", there was in reality only
one) but they were from nowhere near Mount Everest and they had been inveigled out of Tibet without permission from their superior.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=561–562}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Winter Garden: The Epic of Everest|url=http://www.britishnewspaperarchive.co.uk/viewer/bl/0000320/19250620/135/0005|accessdate=16 May 2015|work=Gloucestershire Echo|date=20 June 1925|page=5|publisher=[[British Newspaper Archive]]|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the satisfaction of the press when the monks went to the [[London Zoo]] they were shown the [[llamas]].{{sfnp|Hansen|1996|p=732}} To begin with the show was a critical and public success. It toured Britain and Germany and over a million people in the United States and Canada went to see it.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=561–562}} However, the political difficulties turned things sour and by the end of 1925 ''Explorers' Films'' had gone bankrupt in [[Colombo]], requiring the Mount Everest Committee to send £150 to get the monks back to India.{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|p=156}} Only a few of them returned to Tibet and those who did were severely punished.{{sfnp|Hansen|1996|p=738}}

==Diplomatic representations from Tibet==

[[File:DalaiLama-13 lg.jpg|thumb|upright|Thubten Gyatso, 13th Dalai Lama, about 1910]]
The government of Tibet lodged an official diplomatic protest. They believed that the film, and its accompanying carnival, ridiculed Tibet. They found particularly offensive a scene showing a man delousing a child and then eating the [[Head louse|lice]].{{sfnp|Davis|2012|p=562}}{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|p=150}}&lt;ref group=note&gt;Whether they were [[Head louse|lice]] or [[Human flea|fleas]] seems to have had diplomatic significance but the identification was never resolved.&lt;/ref&gt; After seeing the performance the [[Permanent Under-Secretary of State for India]] wrote that it was "unspeakably boring" but that it could not cause "more than that smile of kindly superiority which we generally assume when we see or hear of strange customs".{{sfnp|Hansen|1996|p=712}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 135-KB-05-100, Tibetexpedition, Tsarong Dzasa.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Tsarong Dzasa]], in 1938]]
The Dalai Lama regarded the film and the monks' performances as a direct affront to his religion and called for the arrest of the monks.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=563&amp;ndash;564}}{{sfnp|Hansen|1996|p=737}}
Noel initially said he had received official permission to take them from Tibet but this was found to be false. In Britain an official inquiry reported, "Captain Noel's statement about the monks taken to England is in direct variance with the facts". The Mount Everest Committee was forced into an apology: "The Committee regret very deeply the humiliating position in which they were placed by the discovery that Captain Noel's statements were incorrect".{{sfnp|Hansen|1996|p=736}} The prime minister of Tibet's note demanding the monks' return ended with "For the future, we cannot give permission to go to Tibet" and no more expeditions were allowed until 1933.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=563&amp;ndash;564}}{{sfnp|Perrin|2013|p=154}}

In Tibet the matter was extremely sensitive because at the time that country was close to revolution. The modernisation and militarisation being introduced
by the Dalai Lama and the head of the army, [[Tsarong Dzasa]], were deeply unacceptable to the governing religious conservatives who were opposed to any British presence or influence. They had good reason to be so opposed – Britain was secretly trying to provoke an uprising in support of the military, although this ultimately failed and Tsarong had to escape to Sikkim.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=563&amp;ndash;564}}

The affair may have had long-term effects beyond mountaineering – when [[Incorporation of Tibet into the People's Republic of China|China invaded]] in 1950 Tibet no longer had an effective army and could offer little military resistance.{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=563&amp;ndash;564}}

==Cover-up and scapegoat==

The Mount Everest Committee was unable to distance itself from the film – it had supported its production and benefited financially. It therefore laid the blame elsewhere for the diplomatic catastrophe and for over fifty years the cover-up succeeded in public, the impression being given that Hazard's unauthorised detour was to blame for the ban on expeditions.{{sfnp|Salkeld|1996|pp=224–226}}

In 1969, as the last item under "Accidents, Equipment and Miscellaneous Notes", the Alpine Club in its ''[[Alpine Journal]]'' reported the death of John Hazard (spelling his name incorrectly) and made it clear that he had never been a Club member. The obituary said he had been "something of a misfit", best remembered for leaving four Sherpas behind at the [[North Col]] in 1924, requiring "very risky rescue operations" by other members of the party. After the expedition, he had gone off the main route with "a porter or two to the Tsango Po river on a jaunt of his own". The report concluded that such detours had been acceptable in 1921 and apologised for in 1922, but in 1924 it was the last straw and Lhasa had clamped down on expeditions for nine years.{{sfnp|Alpine Journal|1969}}{{refn|group=note|This paragraph is based on remarks of a similar tone made by Audrey Salkeld in the ''Alpine Journal'' of 1996.{{sfnp|Salkeld|1996|pp=224–226}}}} In the 1990 ''Alpine Journal''{{'}}s obituary of John Noel the dancing lamas are not mentioned at all.{{sfnp|Hattersley-Smith|1990|pp=315–317}}

By 1996, however, the ''Alpine Journal'' was willing to publish an article entitled "The Scapegoat" by Audrey Salkeld, the Everest historian. In it she reviews Hazard's life and his role concerning the Sherpas on the North Col and his unauthorised Tsangpo journey. She concludes that the Tibetans' strongest complaint was over the monks' publicity visit and credits Walt Unsworth with uncovering the "dancing lama furore" in 1981.{{sfnp|Salkeld|1996|pp=224–226}} The diplomatic affair had been swept under the carpet for over fifty years because Younghusband (president of the RGS and chairman of the Mount Everest Committee) must have been aware of, or even a party to, the scheme to invite the monks.{{sfnp|Salkeld|1996|p=226}}

=="The Affair of the Dancing Lamas"==
In 1981 Walt Unsworth revealed in his book ''Everest'' that "The Affair of the Dancing Lamas" was the primary reason why Mount Everest expeditions had been again banned by Tibet.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Salkeld|1996|p=226|loc=: referring to {{harvp|Unsworth|1981|pp=142&amp;ndash;157}} }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|pp=142&amp;ndash;157|loc=: chapter 6, "The Affair of the Dancing Lamas"}}{{refn|group=note|In his preface Unsworth credits Salkeld for "a great deal of the research".{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|p=xi}}}} The main blame for the diplomatic incident is indeed laid on Noel rather than Hazard but Unsworth views the position of the Tibetan government differently from the more recent accounts of Hansen and Davis, whose analysis has been given above.

When in 1921 [[Charles Alfred Bell|Charles Bell]] retired from being effectively the British diplomatic service for Sikkim and Tibet, [[Frederick Marshman Bailey|Frederick Bailey]] took over. Whereas Bell had been a classical scholar and [[Tibetology|Tibetologist]],{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|p=75}}{{sfnp|Davis|2012|pp=113–114}} Bailey was an adventurer. He had accompanied Younghusband to Lhasa on his 1904 "mission" and later had made a lengthy, arduous and illegal excursion into Tibet to [[Bailey–Morshead exploration of Tsangpo Gorge|explore the Tsangpo Gorge]].{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|p=142}} As poacher turned gamekeeper he went out of his way to hinder expeditions to Tibet – or at least that was the view of the mountaineering establishment in London. Unsworth says it was for reasons unknown, possibly personal ambition, whereas Salkeld says he was believed to have scores to settle with the Mount Everest Committee.{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|pp=143, 157}}{{sfnp|Salkeld|1996|p=226}} He was exceptionally well placed to be awkward as he was the single point of contact between London and Lhasa and so was inevitably involved in passing on and composing diplomatic notes for both sides.{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|pp=142–143, 150–151}} Unsworth supports the "Mount Everest Committee view" in seeing Bailey as the creator of much of the antipathy towards expeditions whilst relying on mere acquiescence from Lhasa.{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|p=157}} Hansen explicitly rejects this view and regards it as a British "[[orientalism|orientalist]]" attitude that people in Tibet were merely primitive and backward.{{sfnp|Hansen|1996|p=713}} He criticises Unsworth (and the Mount Everest Committee and others) for denying any independent agency to the Tibetans. Hansen claims that Lhasa did indeed drive the diplomatic protests for rational reasons and Bailey tended to go along with them.{{sfnp|Hansen|1996|pp=713, 736}} The authors agree that the [[India Office]] in London became enraged by the Mount Everest Committee's indiscretions and it suited everyone concerned in the debacle to keep the whole thing quiet.{{sfnp|Unsworth|1981|pp=155–156}}{{sfnp|Hansen|1996|pp=736–737}}{{sfnp|Salkeld|1996|p=226}}

'''Alexander Nikolaevich Yakovlev''' ({{lang-ru|Алекса́ндр Никола́евич Я́ковлев}}; 2 December 1923 – 18 October 2005) was a [[Soviet]] politician and historian. During the 1980s he was a member of the [[CPSU Politburo|Politburo]] and [[Secretariat of the CPSU Central Committee|Secretariat]] of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]]. He was called the "godfather of glasnost"&lt;ref name="Chief Ideologue"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20051018.wyakov1018/BNStory/International/ |location=Toronto |work=The Globe and Mail |title=Alexander Yakovlev, 81 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051020010403/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/story/RTGAM.20051018.wyakov1018/BNStory/International/ |archivedate=2005-10-20 |accessdate=24 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; as he is considered to be the intellectual force behind [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reform program of [[glasnost]] and [[perestroika]].

Yakovlev was the first Soviet politician to acknowledge the existence of the secret protocols of the 1939 [[Ribbentrop-Molotov Pact]] with [[Nazi Germany]].

==Early career==
Yakovlev was born to a peasant family in a tiny village (Красные Ткачи - Krasnyye Tkachi) on the [[Volga River]] near [[Yaroslavl]]. He served in the [[Red Army]] during [[Eastern Front (World War II)|World War II]], being badly wounded in the Nazi [[siege of Leningrad]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/books/review/Walker-t.html?_r=1&amp;8bu&amp;emc=bua2 | work=The New York Times | title=Paper Trail | first=Martin | last=Walker | date=2009-01-25 | accessdate=2010-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and became a member of the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1944. Beginning in 1958, he was an exchange student at [[Columbia University]] in the United States for one year.&lt;ref name="Keller 1989, pp.30-33"&gt;Keller, Bill. "Moscow's other Mastermind: Aleksandr Yakovlev", ''New York Times Magazine'', February 19, 1989, pp.30-33, 40-43. {{ISSN|0362-4331}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Yakovlev served as editor of several party publications and rose to the key position of head of the CPSU's Department of Ideology and Propaganda from 1969 to 1973. In 1972 he took a bold stand by publishing the article entitled "Against Antihistoricism"&lt;ref&gt;Александр Яковлев [http://left.ru/2005/15/yakovlev132.phtml?print Против антиисторизма] - Литературная газета», 15 ноября 1972 г&lt;/ref&gt; critical of Russian nationalism and nationalism in the [[Soviet Union]] in general. As a result, he was removed from his position and appointed as [[Ambassador of Russia to Canada|ambassador to Canada]] as punishment, remaining at that post for a decade.&lt;ref name="Keller 1989, pp.30-33" /&gt;

During this time, he and [[Prime Minister of Canada|Canadian Prime Minister]] [[Pierre Trudeau]] became close friends. Trudeau's second son, [[Alexandre Trudeau]], was given the Russian nickname "Sacha" after Yakovlev's.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}}

In 1983, Yakovlev accompanied [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who at the time was the Soviet official in charge of agriculture, on his tour of Canada. The purpose of the visit was to tour Canadian farms and agricultural institutions in the hopes of taking lessons that could be applied in the Soviet Union; however, the two renewed their earlier friendship and, tentatively at first, began to discuss the prospect of liberalisation in the Soviet Union.

In an interview years later, Yakovlev recalled:
&lt;blockquote&gt;At first we kind of sniffed around each other and our conversations didn't touch on serious issues. And then, verily, history plays tricks on one, we had a lot of time together as guests of then Liberal Minister of Agriculture [[Eugene Whelan]] in Canada who, himself, was too late for the reception because he was stuck with some striking farmers somewhere. So we took a long walk on that Minister's farm and, as it often happens, both of us suddenly were just kind of flooded and let go. I somehow, for some reason, threw caution to the wind and started telling him about what I considered to be utter stupidities in the area of foreign affairs, especially about those [[SS-20]] missiles that were being stationed in Europe and a lot of other things. And he did the same thing. We were completely frank. He frankly talked about the problems in the internal situation in Russia. He was saying that under these conditions, the conditions of dictatorship and absence of freedom, the country would simply perish. So it was at that time, during our three-hour conversation, almost as if our heads were knocked together, that we poured it all out and during that three-hour conversation we actually came to agreement on all our main points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Shaping Russia's Transformation: A Leader of Perestroika Looks Back - Interview with Aleksandr Yakovlev|url = http://conversations.berkeley.edu/content/alexander-yakovlev|publisher = Institute of International Studies at the University of California, Berkeley|date = November 21, 1996|accessdate = February 21, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Two weeks after the visit, as a result of Gorbachev's interventions, Yakovlev was recalled from Canada by [[Yuri Andropov]] and became Director of the [[Institute of World Economy and International Relations]] of the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]] in Moscow. He was succeeded by his friend [[Yevgeny Primakov]] in 1985.

==Perestroika and its aftermath==
[[Image:Bush and Gorbachev at the Malta summit in 1989.gif|thumb|right|[[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and Yakovlev opposite [[George H. W. Bush]] on board the [[SS Maxim Gorkiy|SS ''Maxim Gorkiy'']] at the [[Malta Summit]] in 1989.]]
[[Image:Vladimir Putin 2 November 2000-4.jpg|thumb|right|Yakovlev as the head of the ''Commission on the Rehabilitation of Soviet Repression Victims'' meets President [[Vladimir Putin]]]]
When Gorbachev became [[General Secretary of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in 1985, Yakovlev became a senior advisor, helping to shape [[Foreign relations of the Soviet Union|Soviet foreign policy]] by advocating Soviet non-intervention in Eastern Europe, and accompanying Gorbachev on his five summit meetings with President of the United States [[Ronald Reagan]]. Domestically, he argued in favour of the reform programs that became known as [[glasnost]] (openness) and [[perestroika]] (restructuring) and played a key role in executing those policies.

In 1987, the Russian nationalist organization [[Pamyat]] sent a letter entitled "Stop Yakovlev!" to the plenum of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, labelling Yakovlev as the main instigator of a course of action that would lead to the 'capitulation before the [[imperialist]]s'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://old.nasledie.ru/oborg/2_18/0009/01.htm «Остановите Яковлева!» Листовка—обращение Координационного Совета Патриотического Движения «Память» к Пленуму Центрального Комитета Коммунистической Партии Советского Союза]&lt;/ref&gt;

For decades, it was the official policy of the Soviet Union to deny the existence of the secret protocol to the [[Nazi-Soviet Pact]]. At the behest of Mikhail Gorbachev, Yakovlev headed a commission investigating the existence of such a protocol. In December 1989 Yakovlev concluded that the protocol had existed and revealed his findings to the Soviet Parliament. As a result, the first multi-party elected [[Congress of Soviets]] "passed the declaration admitting the existence of the secret protocols, condemning and denouncing them".&lt;ref&gt;Jerzy W. Borejsza, Klaus Ziemer, Magdalena Hułas. ''Totalitarian and Authoritarian Regimes in Europe'', p. 521. Berghahn Books, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was promoted to the [[Politburo]] in 1987, but by 1990 he had become the focus of attacks by hardliner communists in the party opposed to liberalisation. At the [[28th Congress of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] in July 1990, a cynical [[Alexander Lebed]] caused uproar when he asked Yakovlev: "Alexander Nikolaevich... How many faces have you got?" An embarrassed Yakovlev consulted his colleagues and continued on with the proceedings, but resigned from the Politburo the day after the congress concluded.&lt;ref&gt;Times Wire Services. "Six Quitting the Politburo: Exits Laid to Lessening of Party's Role". 3 July 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=General in Exile |episodelink= |url= |series=Assignment |serieslink= |credits=[[Tom Carver]] |network=BBC2 |station= |city= |airdate=1996-11-16 |season= |number= |minutes=45 |transcript= |transcripturl=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the communists opposed to liberalization gained strength, his position became more tenuous; [[Architect amidst the Ruins|fiercely attacked]] by his former protégé [[Gennady Zyuganov]] in May 1991, he resigned from the Party two days before the [[August Coup]] in 1991. During the coup Yakovlev joined the democratic opposition against it. Following the failed coup attempt, Yakovlev blamed Gorbachev for having been naive in bringing the plotters into his inner circle saying Gorbachev was "guilty of forming a team of traitors. Why did he surround himself with people capable of treason?"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.raoulwallenberg.net/?en/press/alexander-yakovlev-81.2773.htm  globeandmail.com] by Vladimir Isachenkov. Retrieved 2005-10-18&lt;/ref&gt;

In his book ''Inside the Stalin Archives'' (2008), Jonathan Brent tells that in 1991, when there were Lithuanian crowds [[January Events (Lithuania)|demonstrating for independence]] from the Soviet Union, Gorbachev consulted Yakovlev about the wisdom of an armed repression against them. Gorbachev asked, "Should we shoot?" Yakovlev answered that, "if a single Soviet soldier fired a single bullet on the unarmed crowds, Soviet power would be over." There were bullets, however, and the USSR collapsed seven months later.&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan Brent. ''Inside the Stalin Archives. Discovering the New Russia.'' Atlas &amp; Co., 2008 ({{ISBN|0-9777433-3-0}}) reviewed by Martin Walker in [https://www.nytimes.com/2009/01/25/books/review/Walker-t.html?_r=1&amp;8bu&amp;emc=bua2 Paper Trail] ''[[The New York Times]]'', January 23, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the years following the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], Yakovlev wrote and lectured extensively on history, politics and economics. He acted as the leader of the [[Russian Party of Social Democracy]], which in the mid-1990s fused into United Democrats (a pro-reform alliance that was later reorganized into [[Union of Rightist Forces]]). In 2002, acting as head of the Presidential Committee for the Rehabilitation of Victims of Political Repression, he was present at the announcement of the release of a CD detailing names and short biographies of the victims of Soviet purges. In his later life, he founded and led the [[International Democracy Foundation]]. He advocated taking responsibility for the past crimes of communism and was critical of [[Vladimir Putin|President Putin's]] restrictions on democracy. &lt;!-- CDI Russia Weekly #230, "Russia: Rights Group Marks Bolshevik Anniversary With Catalog Of Soviet Repressions" By Gregory Feifer, Moscow, 7 November 2002,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cdi.org/russia/230-2-pr.cfm&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

In 2000, he publicly alleged that Swedish diplomat [[Raoul Wallenberg]], who became famous for his role in saving thousands of [[History of the Jews in Hungary|Hungarian Jews]] from the [[Holocaust]], was shot and killed in Soviet secret police headquarters in 1947.{{citation needed|date=June 2007}} He was called "God's commie" in a 2002 article for investigating crimes of the Soviet state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pryce-Jones, David |year=2002|title=God's Commie: The ongoing achievement of Alexander Yakovlev |journal=National Review|volume=54|issue=24|pages=24&amp;ndash;26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Elections in Australia|Federal elections]] were held in Australia on 1 December 1984. All 148 seats in the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] (24 of them newly created) and 46 of 76 seats in the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] (12 of them newly created) were up for election. The incumbent [[Australian Labor Party|Labor Party]] led by Prime Minister [[Bob Hawke]] defeated the opposition [[Coalition (Australia)|Liberal–National coalition]], led by [[Andrew Peacock]].

The election was held in conjunction with [[Australian referendum, 1984|two referendum questions]], neither of which were carried.

Future opposition leader [[Alexander Downer]] entered parliament at this election.

==Background and issues==
The election had a long campaign and a high rate of informal voting for the House of Representatives, but decreased rate in the Senate (due to the introduction of the [[Group voting ticket]]). The election was held 18 months ahead of time, partly to bring the elections for the House of Representatives and Senate back into line following the [[double dissolution]] [[Australian federal election, 1983|election of 1983]].

The legislated increase in the size of the House of Representatives by 24 seats and the Senate by 12 seats came into effect at the 1984 election. Prior to 1984 the electoral commission did not undertake a full distribution of preferences for statistical purposes. The stored ballot papers for the previous election were put through this process prior to their destruction – therefore the figures from 1983 onwards show the actual result based on full distribution of preferences.

==Analysis==
[[File:1984 Election Australia Gallagher Index.png|right|thumb|300px|The [[Gallagher Index]] result: 7.79]]

Labor instead suffered a 2-point swing against it and had its majority cut from 25 to 16. Hawke blamed the result on the changes to Senate vote cards, which he believed confused people regarding their House of Representatives votes and contributed to the relatively high informal vote, the majority of which apparently was Labor votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Hawke Memoirs|last= Hawke|first= RJL|authorlink= Bob Hawke|coauthors= |year= 1996|publisher= Mandarin|location= Port Melbourne|pages= 275–276}}  "Attracted to the simplicity of the Senate ballot, a number of voters thought they could mark their Lower House ballot in exactly the same way.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9928">The '''Scare-A-Con Film Festival''' (formerly the '''B-Movie Film Festival''') is an annual [[film festival]] held in [[Syracuse, New York|Syracuse, United States]].

The festival was founded in 1999 by local filmmaker Ron Bonk to promote the art of [[B-movie]] making. It was canceled in its third year due to the effects of the [[September 11 attacks]]. It then existed primarily online or as a much smaller event for several years (during which it was profiled by the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]''&lt;ref name=WSJ&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/wsj/access/551334571.html?dids=551334571:551334571&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Feb+26%2C+2004 "Envelope Please. And the Winner Is ...

Many of the films entered are made on minimal budgets. Screenings can feature full-length films, [[Documentary film|documentaries]], and [[Short film|shorts]]. Various genres are included, and selected films are usually reviewed for possible distribution. The festival defines a B-movie as "a production whose entertainment and artistic value exceeds the limitations of its budget." The festival's "Killer B" or "Tor" awards are sought after and prominently displayed by the winners. One film maker described being nominated for a B-Movie Film Festival award "like heaven to the world of independent filmmaking".&lt;ref name=FilmThreatDacko&gt;[http://www.filmthreat.com/index.php?section=interviews&amp;Id=929 "Ryan Dacko: The Antarctica Auteur"], interview by Phil Hall, ''[[Film Threat]]'', 2005-03-21.

[[File:Baja 4000 Map.jpg|thumb|Preliminary Map Of The Baja 4000|upright=1.45|]]

The '''Baja 4000''' is an off-road charity rally and road trip organized by the creators of the largest amateur rally in the world, the [[Budapest-Bamako]]&lt;ref&gt;[MarathonRally.com http://www.marathonrally.com/news/budapest_bamako_participants_gear_up_for_world_s_largest_amateur_rally.10898.0.html]&lt;/ref&gt;. It's a low budget, amateur version of the famous [[Baja 1000]] and [[Dakar Rally]]. The first edition is expected to be held in January 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[[Off Road Extreme http://www.offroadxtreme.com/news/video-baja-4000-amateur-rally/]]&lt;/ref&gt; The rally will start in [[Los Angeles]] and travel 4000 kilometers on the [[Baja California peninsula]] in [[Mexico]] &lt;ref&gt;[[Race Dezert http://www.race-dezert.com/home/135026-135026.html]]&lt;/ref&gt;.

== Philosophy and rules ==

The guiding principle of the Baja 4000 is the same as the [[Budapest-Bamako]]'s, ''Anyone, By Anything, In Any Way''.&lt;ref&gt;[Daily News Hungary http://dailynewshungary.com/budapest-bamako-rally-the-story-of-raphael/]&lt;/ref&gt; There are no restrictions on the vehicles or individuals that can enter, and no set routes. Participants have to complete daily stages between Los Angeles and [[Cabo San Lucas]] and back. It is not a timed event. Points are awarded for completing daily stages in certain time periods. In addition there are [[geocaching]] challenges along the way for additional points. If a team does not complete a stage, they are still in the race. Cars do not have to arrive at the finish line, only participants. Teams can participate in racing or touring categories.&lt;ref&gt;[[Off Road Extreme http://www.offroadxtreme.com/news/video-baja-4000-amateur-rally/]]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Route ==

The rally will spend a long day in California before entering Mexico at [[Mexicali]]. Teams will drive south on the [[Sea Of Cortez]] side of the peninsula and will have to drive north on the [[Pacific Ocean]] side.

* {{flagicon|United States}} [[United States]]
* {{flagicon|Mexico}} [[Mexico]]

More than 4,000 kilometers will be covered within 10 days.

===Categories===

Teams can enter in the competitive category where navigational points need to be reached and daily stages completed. It is a point race and not a timed event. In touring category teams travel at their own pace and there is no competition.

== Charity ==

The Baja 4000 is primarily a charity event, that raises donations for abandoned children and orphans in Mexico through Corazon de Vida.

The '''Battle of An''' ({{zh|c={{linktext|鞍|之|战}}|p=Ān zhī Zhàn}}) was fought during the [[Spring and Autumn period]] in 589 BC  at [[Hua Hill]] in the area of the present-day city of [[Jinan]], [[Shandong]] between the states of [[State of Qi|Qi]] and [[Jin (Chinese state)|Jin]]. It ended in a victory for the state of Jin and eventually resulted in an alliance between the two states.

Two of the three surviving commentaries on the [[Spring and Autumn Annals]], the [[Zuo Zhuan]] and the [[Guliang Zhuan]] describe the event that led to
the battle as an insult that an emissary of Jin suffered at the court of Qi,&lt;ref name=battleofan&gt;[http://www.ourorient.com/the-battle-of-an-between-jin-and-qi-for-hegemony.htm Jiang Yike, The Battle of An, Between Jin and Qi, For Hegemony] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120501085720/http://www.ourorient.com/the-battle-of-an-between-jin-and-qi-for-hegemony.htm |date=2012-05-01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the two accounts differ on the nature of the insult. According to the
[[Zuo Zhuan]], the duke of Qi allowed women to watch the emissary's visit from behind a screen, women who then insulted the emissary with their
laughter.&lt;ref name=battleofan/&gt;&lt;ref name=watson&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=UcYRpKmh-W4C  Burton Watson:  The Tso chuan: selections from China's oldest narrative history, Columbia University Press, 1992]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Guliang Zhuan]] claims that the duke of Qi insulted the emissaries of four visiting states by assigning each of them a server who shared their respective physical defects.&lt;ref name=battleofan/&gt;

Sriduangkaew began publishing short fiction in 2012, with "Courtship in the Country of the Machine Gods",&lt;ref&gt;[http://futurefire.net/2012.24/fiction/machinegods.html Courtship in the Country of Machine Gods], by Benjanun Sriduangkaew, originally published in ''[[the Future Fire]]'' #24, 2012; reprinted in [[Apex Magazine]], July 1, 2014, and ''The Apex Book of World SF 3'' edited by [[Lavie Tidhar]].&lt;/ref&gt; and established a name for herself with a string of high-profile short stories in ''[[Clarkesworld Magazine]]'' and elsewhere,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/author/Benjanun%20Sriduangkaew/ |title=Archives |work=clarkesworldmagazine.com }}&lt;/ref&gt; which led to her nomination for the John W. Campbell Award.

Her first long-form publication was the [[urban fantasy]] [[novella]] ''Scale-Bright'', published in 2014. A follow-up to her three ''Sun-Moon Cycle'' stories, it is a love story about a young woman from Hong Kong who has to rescue her sister from Heaven. Reviewing the novel for ''[[Tor.com]]'', Niall Alexander described it as "an achievement without equal", appreciating its "delicately drawn characters", "affecting narrative" and the author's prose skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Alexander|first1=Niall|title=Among Myths: Scale-Bright by Benjanun Sriduangkaew|url=http://www.tor.com/blogs/2014/08/book-review-scale-brite-benjanun-sriduangkaew|accessdate=9 November 2014|work=[[Tor.com]]|date=22 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her second novella, ''Winterglass'', was published in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.apexbookcompany.com/products/winterglass?variant=1137406935066&lt;/ref&gt; It is a [[science-fantasy]] retelling of the story of [[the Snow Queen]]. ''[[Publishers Weekly]]''{{'}}s reviewer considered that the "promising novella" provided "variations on the theme of strong female characters" but was marred by an "uneven plot and some missed opportunities for complex worldbuilding".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Fiction Book Review: Winterglass by Benjanun Sriduangkaew.

Most of Sriduangkaew's work foregrounds lesbian relationships and South East Asian themes or influences.

==Online activity==
In 2014 Sriduangkaew was revealed to have been the controversial blogger and book reviewer "Requires Hate" (also known as "Requires Only That You Hate", as well as "Winterfox"). Using these Internet identities, she published violently intimidating and harsh critiques, which included death and rape threats, of many writers she believed to have paid insufficient attention to racism, sexism, heteronormativity, or colonialism in their fiction. Many of her targets were themselves young, female, transgender, and/or persons of color.&lt;ref name=Dot&gt;[http://www.dailydot.com/geek/benjanun-sriduangkaew-revealed-to-be-troll-requires-hate-winterfox Acclaimed sci-fi writer exposed as notorious Internet troll], by Aja Romano, at ''[[The Daily Dot]]''; published November 12, 2014; retrieved November 13, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ansible&gt;[http://news.ansible.uk/a328.html Ansible 328, November 2014], by [[David Langford]]&lt;/ref&gt;

In a blog post in 2015, Sriduangkaew wrote that she had become the target of harassment and [[cyberstalking]] campaigns after her Internet identities were revealed, while conceding that "I’ve been shitty in the past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sriduangkaew|first1=Benjanun|title=Six Months and Counting|url=https://medium.com/@talkinghive/six-months-and-counting-13d331912b81|publisher=Medium.com|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Bloody Christmas''' of 1920 ({{lang-it|Natale di sangue}}) was a series of clashes in  [[Fiume]] (now [[Rijeka]]), which led to the conclusion of the Fiume campaign carried out by Italian poet and adventurer, [[Gabriele D'Annunzio]] in 1920.

==Background==
Upon the return of the liberal politician [[Giovanni Giolitti]] to government in June 1920, during the [[Biennio Rosso]], the official attitude towards the [[Italian Regency of Carnaro|Kingdom of Italy's regency of Carnaro]] constituted in Fiume began to waver. On November 12 of the same year, Italy and Yugoslavia signed the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]], forming the [[Free State of Fiume]] as a consequence to an occupation of Fiume by [[Gabriele d'Annunzio]] and his troops which began with the [[Impresa di Fiume]]. D'Annunzio entered Fiume as part of his and many Italians protest for an incomplete victory after World War I, because Italy was denied some of the Eastern Adriatic lands it claimed and was promised at its entry to the war.

==Occupation==
The resumption of Italy's premiership by the liberal Giovanni Giolitti in June 1920 signalled a hardening of official attitudes to d'Annunzio's coup. On 12 November, Italy and Yugoslavia concluded the Treaty of Rapallo, under which Fiume was to be an independent state, the Free State of Fiume, under a government acceptable to both.
D'Annunzio refused to accept an ultimatum forced upon him to abandon [[Rijeka|Fiume]] and claimed the [[Treaty of Rapallo (1920)|Treaty of Rapallo]] as illegal. Consequently, his Regency declared war on Italy, further provoking a backlash from the Italian forces, resulting in a cannonade from the Royal Navy. General [[Enrico Caviglia]] led his troops against the city, beginning on 24 December 1920 and after just five days occupied the city.

==Following defeat==
Following the defeat of d'Annunzio's forces, there was an election of the Constituent Assembly, giving independentists an overwhelming victory with 65% of the vote. On 5 October 1921, [[Riccardo Zanella]] became the first and only elected president of the short lived [[Free State of Fiume]], however this was unable to end disputes over the city.

Seven months later in Rome, Mussolini became prime minister, and Italy started heading towards a fascist regime. As a result, Zanella was overthrown in a fascist putsch by local fascists in March 1922, resulting in an Italian military occupation of the city. This period of diplomatic tension ended with the [[Treaty of Rome (1924)|Treaty of Rome]] on 27 January 1924, which assigned Fiume to Italy and [[Susak]] along with other villages, to Yugoslavia, with joint port administration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="56429">The following is a list of games that have been canceled by the [[National Football League]] since 1933. While canceling games was extremely common prior to this date, since that year, the NFL has only twice canceled regular season games, in both cases for labor disputes between the league and the [[National Football League Players Association]]. Seven weeks of regular season games were canceled in [[1982 NFL season|1982]] and one week of regular season games was canceled in [[1987 NFL season|1987]].

[[National Football League preseason|Preseason]] contests have seen comparatively more cancellations, since the games do not count in the standings. Two of these games, the [[1974 NFL season|1974]] [[Chicago College All-Star Game]] and the [[2011 NFL season|2011]] [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]], were canceled because of offseason labor stoppages that were resolved prior to the start of the rest of the preseason. Three games were canceled as the result of unsafe playing fields: a [[1995 NFL season|1995]] NFL preseason game between [[1995 San Diego Chargers season|the San Diego Chargers]] and [[1995 Houston Oilers season|the Houston Oilers]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Sues-over-canceled-game-at-Astrodome-Houston-s-3119873.php&lt;/ref&gt; a [[2001 NFL season|2001]] preseason game between the [[Baltimore Ravens]] and the [[Philadelphia Eagles]],&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/games/2001-08-13-canceled.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[2016 NFL season|2016]] [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17241245/hall-fame-game-canceled-due-poor-field-conditions-tom-benson-stadium&lt;/ref&gt; An additional preseason game, the [[2017 NFL season|2017]] [[Governor's Cup (Texas)|Texas Governor's Cup]], was canceled for weather. At least one other announced game was discarded before it was officially placed on the schedule. The proposed [[China Bowl (NFL)|China Bowl]] exhibition was to have been played in August 2007 but was postponed indefinitely before the 2007 schedule was released, with all plans for the game formally canceled before December 2008.

The league has run into other instances in which a game cannot realistically be played on its scheduled date, including weather-related [[rainout (sports)|rainouts]] and conflicts with [[college football]] or [[Major League Baseball]] over the use of shared stadiums. Unlike baseball, the NFL generally plays through even the coldest and most precipitous of weather unless such weather makes the stadium unusable or it becomes unsafe for spectators to attend the match. In such cases where a game cannot be played on its scheduled date, especially in the regular season, the league has the options of rescheduling the contest to any available day and, if the stadium cannot be used, relocating the contest to the opponent’s stadium or a neutral site (usually another nearby NFL stadium or a suitably sized modern college football venue). To date, such measures have not been necessary for any individual game in the [[NFL playoffs|playoffs]].

==1920s and 1930s==
Canceling games was far more common in the 1920s and early 1930s, in the founding years of the league. When a team did not want to play a game, they could cancel without any punishment or penalty. Several years after league schedules were standardized in [[1933 NFL season|1933]], cancellations were effectively banned, and teams would have to [[forfeit (sport)|forfeit the game]] or postpone if a cancellation was due to issues outside the team's control. There have been no forfeits in the league's history; a 1921 game between the [[Rochester Jeffersons]] and the [[Washington Senators (NFL)|Washington Senators]] is occasionally listed as a forfeit, but because of the lax cancellation rules of the time and uncertainty over which team (if either) was at fault for the game not being played, the game is listed in modern records as a cancellation. The last unpunished cancellation of a regular season NFL game is believed to have been a November 17, 1935 contest between the [[Boston Redskins]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]], which was canceled for severe rain and snow.

Several games were removed from the schedules of the NFL teams of the early 1940s, but because the issues (namely, [[World War II]], the loss of marquee talent to the war effort, and restrictions on resource usage) were already foreseen by the start of the [[1942 NFL season|1942 season]], the league was able to issue shortened schedules from the start without having to cancel already scheduled contests.

==1974 Players Strike==
The 1974 [[College All-Star Game]], an exhibition game that pitted the most recent Super Bowl champion ([[1973 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]]) against a team composed entirely of rookies, was canceled as a result of a players’ strike. The strike was resolved before any further games were canceled; the [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]], along with the rest of the [[1974 NFL season]], went on as scheduled, although at least one game was held with the [[Denver Broncos]] using a squad of rookie [[replacement player]]s.&lt;ref name="cc2205"&gt;{{cite news |first=Mark L. |last=Ford |work=The Coffin Corner |publisher=Pro Football Researchers Association |title=25 Significant “Meaningless” NFL Games |volume=22 |issue=5 |url=http://www.profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/22-05-865.pdf |date=2000 |accessdate=January 19, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101014211941/http://profootballresearchers.org/Coffin_Corner/22-05-865.pdf |archivedate=October 14, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1982 players' strike==
In 1982, players began a 57-day strike following the completion of Week 2 of the regular season. As a result of the impasse, games were simply canceled until a settlement was reached (ultimately, Weeks 3 to 9). Upon reaching that settlement, the NFL announced that Weeks 11 to 16 would be played as scheduled, and the games originally scheduled for Week 3 of the season would be played following the completion of the resumed regular season as a new Week 17, with the playoffs pushed back one week. Later, the NFL decided to use the final week 17 to hold various intra-division games from cancelled Weeks 3 to 9 instead of merely playing the Week 3 games. This was done to increase attendance and to allow some teams to balance out home and away games, to the extent possible (either five home and four away, or four home and five away). Because the 1982 shortened season would include only nine regular season contests for each team, the NFL announced that the three divisions in each of the two conferences would be eliminated for the purpose of determining playoff qualifications, and the regular season would be followed by an expansion of the playoffs from 10 to 16 teams. With this, each conference had 14 teams competing for 8 playoff spots, with division standings being disregarded in favor of overall conference standings. Each of the first three rounds of the playoffs was pushed back one week in order to make room for the new week 17, which was originally scheduled as the Wild Card weekend. This was possible because there was an idle week between the Conference Championship games and the Super Bowl. The Super Bowl and [[1983 Pro Bowl|Pro Bowl]] were held as originally scheduled.

Note: Some of the games originally scheduled for Weeks 3 to 9, listed below, were rescheduled to a new, final Week 17.

===Games postponed to new Week 17===
In order to ensure maximal attendance, and to balance out home and away games for each team, to the extent possible (either five home and four away, or four home and five away), the NFL made 12 of the 14 games in the final week of the rescheduled season (Week 17) select intra-division games that were picked from cancelled Weeks 3 to 10, instead of merely playing out Week 3 games, as had originally been planned. This was the maximum number mathematically possible, since four of the six divisions at that time had an odd number of teams (the two games that were not intra-division were [[1982 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] at [[1982 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] and [[1982 Dallas Cowboys season|Dallas Cowboys]] at [[1982 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]). The [[New York Giants]] at [[Philadelphia Eagles]] game originally scheduled for Week 7 on Monday was moved to Sunday, while the Dallas Cowboys at Minnesota Vikings game originally scheduled for Week 3 on Sunday was moved to Monday.

==1987 Players Strike==
In 1987, the players went on strike for a second time in-season, again following the second week of the campaign. However, unlike 1982, the owners took the bold step of using replacement players. After missing just one week of action, the NFL resumed with [[replacement player]]s for Week 4. By the time Week 6 had rolled around, enough players had crossed the picket lines and forced an agreement to let the regular players play again. The canceled games of Week 3 were not made up, and the league counted the three weeks of game results featuring the replacement players as regular season games toward each team's final standings. By Week 7, the teams had all players back in action, with all teams completing a 15-game schedule. Also unlike 1982, there was no change to the playoff format that season.

==1995 preseason game in Houston==
An August 19, 1995 preseason game between [[1995 San Diego Chargers season|the San Diego Chargers]] and [[1995 Houston Oilers season|the Houston Oilers]] was the first game in NFL history to be canceled before kickoff after an NFL official determined that the Astrodome’s artificial turf endangered the players.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.sfgate.com/sports/article/Sues-over-canceled-game-at-Astrodome-Houston-s-3119873.php&lt;/ref&gt;

==2001 preseason game in Philadelphia==
An August 13, [[2001 NFL season|2001]] preseason game between [[2001 Baltimore Ravens season|the Ravens]] and [[2001 Philadelphia Eagles season|the Eagles]] was canceled because of an unplayable playing surface at [[Veterans Stadium]]. This was scheduled to be the first football game played at the stadium after a new artificial surface, NexTurf, was installed. Because the multi-purpose stadium was shared by both the Eagles and the [[Philadelphia Phillies]] baseball team, this surface (and the previous artificial turf installations before it) included cutouts that covered up the dirt infield around the bases. After examining the turf, Ravens coach [[Brian Billick]] refused to let the Ravens take the field for warm-ups when he discovered a trench around the area where third base was covered up by one of the cutouts. City crews unsuccessfully tried to fix the problem, forcing the game to be canceled. Later, players from both teams reported that they sank into the turf in locations near the infield cutouts. Team president [[Joe Banner]] was irate after the game, calling the stadium's conditions "absolutely unacceptable" and "an embarrassment to the city of Philadelphia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=N.F.L.: ROUNDUP; Eagles’ Turf Unsafe For Ravens’ Game|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/14/sports/nfl-roundup-eagles-turf-unsafe-for-ravens-game.html?sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|date=August 14, 2001|accessdate=April 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; City officials, however, promised that the stadium would be suitable for play when the regular season started. The Eagles would later move into [[Lincoln Financial Field]] in 2003, and the Phillies would move into its own separate ballpark, [[Citizens Bank Park]], in 2004.

==September 11, 2001 attacks==
In the wake of the [[September 11 attacks]], the NFL postponed its Week 2 games of the 2001 season, originally scheduled for September 16 and 17, until the end of the regular season. All playoff games following the 2001 regular season, including [[Super Bowl XXXVI]] and the [[2002 Pro Bowl]], were similarly rescheduled one week later.

This was in contrast during the wake of the [[John F. Kennedy assassination]] in 1963 when the NFL went ahead and played its full slate of games that week, a decision that then-NFL commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] would later regret,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/With-nation-mourning-JFK-NFL-games-were-played/513e0cda-040b-4b5f-9569-993ff8b6725f|title=With nation mourning JFK, NFL games were played|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=November 22, 2013|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; though he also stated that [[Pierre Salinger]], Kennedy’s press secretary, had urged him to allow the games to be played.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mayer|first=Larry|url=http://www.chicagobears.com/news/article-1/1963-season-Bears-tie-Steelers-17-17/b5cff230-ad0f-4581-9516-ff6559438fe8|title=1963 season: Bears tie Steelers 17–17|publisher=[[Chicago Bears]]|date=November 22, 2013|accessdate=November 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the [[American Football League]] canceled week 12 of its [[1963 American Football League season|1963 season]] and later rescheduled those games.

==2011 owners' lockout==
On July 22, 2011, the NFL announced that that year’s [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]] originally set for August 7 of that year between [[2011 Chicago Bears season|Chicago]] and [[2011 St. Louis Rams season|St. Louis]] had been canceled, for an ongoing [[2011 NFL lockout|lockout]] that had been in place since March of that year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.profootballhof.com/enshrinement/2011/7/22/NFL-Hall-of-Fame-Game-canceled/ Pro Football Hall of Fame’s statement regarding cancellation of NFL/Hall of Fame Game].

The NFL also had contingency plans to cancel and/or postpone regular season games (up to eight) if a labor agreement could not be reached by the start of the regular season.&lt;ref name="ESPN_Schefter20100421"&gt;{{cite web | title=NFL schedule could buy three weeks | url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=6404790 | publisher=ESPN | first=Adam | last=Schefter | date=2011-04-21 | accessdate=2011-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Roth, Andy (2011-06-07).

==2016 Hall of Fame Game==
The 2016 [[Pro Football Hall of Fame Game]] was canceled at the last minute for poor playing conditions on the newly installed [[FieldTurf]] that had been placed at [[Tom Benson Hall of Fame Stadium]] in the off-season. Mike Silver of [[NFL.com]] reported that on the morning of game day, the logos at midfield and the end zones had been painted using paint which was not intended for use on artificial turf. When it was apparent the paint wasn't drying fast enough, the field was heated to speed up the drying process, but this caused the turf's rubber to melt. These issues led to unfavorable play conditions. The affected areas were described as being slick and "like cement," making it impossible to get decent footing. Stadium officials attempted to address this by applying a solvent, reportedly [[paint thinner]], to the turf. A Packers employee noticed a label warning that this substance could result in burns when exposed to skin, and alerted others to the discovery. When officially cancelling the game, both the league and the Players Association cited safety concerns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000681512/article/hof-game-cancellation-was-right-thing-to-do|title=Hall of Fame Game cancellation: NFL made the right decision|last=Silver|first=Mike|publisher=NFL.com|date=2016-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poor field conditions force cancellation of Hall of Fame game|url=http://www.espn.com/nfl/story/_/id/17241245/hall-fame-game-canceled-due-poor-field-conditions-tom-benson-stadium|last=Demovsky|first=Rob|work=ESPN.com|date=August 7, 2016|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="sbnation-hof2016"&gt;{{cite web|title=Hall of Fame Game fiasco: How the wrong paint, melted rubber, and caustic paint thinner nixed Packers-Colts|url=http://www.acmepackingcompany.com/2016/8/9/12405268/hall-of-fame-game-fiasco-paint-field-melted-rubber-paint-thinner-packers-colts|website=Acme Packing Company (SBNation)|publisher=Vox Media|accessdate=10 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both teams were told at 6:40&amp;nbsp;p.m.—an hour and 20 minutes before kickoff—that the game was going to be canceled.  However, fans in the stadium only learned of the pending cancellation via social media. No official announcement was made until just before the scheduled 8 p.m. kickoff.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/sports/columnists/gregg-doyel/2016/08/07/doyel-nfl-fans-deserve-better/88380724/|title=Doyel: NFL fans deserve better|last=Doyel|first=Gregg|authorlink=Gregg Doyel|publisher=[[The Indianapolis Star]]|date=2016-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2017 Governor’s Cup==
The 2017 [[Governor's Cup (Texas)|Governor's Cup]], an annual [[National Football League preseason|preseason matchup]] between [[Texas]]’s two NFL franchises, [[2017 Dallas Cowboys season|the Dallas Cowboys]] and [[2017 Houston Texans season|Houston Texans]], was canceled by the effects of [[Hurricane Harvey]]. The game, originally scheduled for August 31 in Houston, was initially moved to Dallas, as Houston was severely flooded as the result of the rains from Harvey and the team had temporarily relocated to Dallas until the storm passed. The Texans opted instead to cancel the game to allow the team more time to relocate back to Houston.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000837044/article/cowboys-versus-texans-preseason-game-canceled&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cancellations due to severe weather and natural disasters==
In the modern era, severe weather or natural disasters have affected some games, but only the aforementioned case of Hurricane Harvey has a game been canceled outright. Others were either switched to a different location, or to a different date in the schedule.

The [[1989 Loma Prieta earthquake]] damaged [[Candlestick Park]], forcing [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|the San Francisco 49ers]] to play their next home game on October 22 against [[1989 New England Patriots season|the New England Patriots]] at [[Stanford Cardinal football|Stanford University]]’s [[Stanford Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.nfl.com/history/chronology/1981-1990|title=NFL History: 1981–1990|publisher=nfl.com|accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1992, [[Hurricane Andrew]] forced the September 6 opening-day game between the [[New England Patriots]] and the [[Miami Dolphins]] at [[Joe Robbie Stadium]] to be rescheduled to October 18, when both teams originally had a bye week.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1992-08-29/sports/sp-5471_1_reschedule-dolphins-patriots | title=Dolphins and Patriots Reschedule Opener | publisher=Los Angeles Times | date=1992-08-29 |accessdate=2013-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the wake of the October 25, 2003 [[Cedar Fire (2003)|Cedar Fire]], California Governor [[Arnold Schwarzenegger]] declared a state of emergency and activated the National Guard to assist in the disaster relief process. Because of the soot and particulate matter in the air from the fire two days earlier, the NFL was forced to move the Monday Night Football game on October 27 between [[2003 San Diego Chargers season|the San Diego Chargers]] and [[2003 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] to [[Sun Devil Stadium]] in [[Tempe, Arizona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6782880 |title=Fires move Monday night game to Tempe |publisher=nfl.com |date=2003-10-26 |accessdate=2006-12-17 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061014051835/http://www.nfl.com/news/story/6782880 |archivedate=2006-10-14 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[2004 Cincinnati Bengals season|Cincinnati Bengals]] at [[2004 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] preseason game, scheduled for Saturday, August 14, was rescheduled to Monday, August 16, because of [[Hurricane Charley]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.upi.com/Sports_News/2004/08/14/Bengals-Bucs-exhibition-moved-to-Monday/UPI-86081092515828/?st_rec=8673538462800 Bengals-Bucs exhibition moved to Monday]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the [[2004 Tennessee Titans season|Tennessee Titans]] at [[2004 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] opening-day game, scheduled for Sunday, September 12 at 1 PM ET, was rescheduled to Saturday, September 11 at 1 PM ET because of [[Hurricane Ivan]],&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-10-20-chiefs-dolphins-moved_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt;and the [[2004 Pittsburgh Steelers season|Pittsburgh Steelers]] at [[2004 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] game scheduled for Sunday, September 26, at 1 PM ET was moved to 8:30 PM ET because of [[Hurricane Jeanne]]. The latter game would become notable as the first NFL start of Steelers quarterback [[Ben Roethlisberger]].&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-10-20-chiefs-dolphins-moved_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Effect of Hurricane Katrina on the New Orleans Saints|Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005 damaged the [[Louisiana Superdome]]. The NFL decided that [[2005 New Orleans Saints season|the New Orleans Saints]]' first regularly scheduled home game against the [[New York Giants]] be played in [[Giants Stadium]] in New Jersey, with the Saints the home team in name only.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| url=http://www.nola.com/katrina/pages/090305/a15.pdf|title=Saints home opener at New York|publisher=New Orleans Times-Picayune]|date=2005-09-03|accessdate=2007-01-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the rest of the season, the Saints home games were split between the [[Alamodome]] in [[San Antonio]] and [[Louisiana State University]]’s [[Tiger Stadium (LSU)|Tiger Stadium]].

In 2005, the NFL moved up the [[2005 Kansas City Chiefs season|Kansas City Chiefs]] at [[2005 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] game from Sunday, October 23 at 1 PM ET to Friday, October 21 at 7 PM ET because of [[Hurricane Wilma]]. The NFL received permission to play the game on a Friday, as the team’s [[antitrust]] exemption normally forbids it to televise games on Fridays to protect [[high school football]].&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-10-20-chiefs-dolphins-moved_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt; It also forced the Chiefs to travel to Miami on the day of the game, a violation of the NFL's collective bargaining agreement with the [[National Football League Players Association]] which requires a visiting team to arrive in the host city no later than 24 hours prior to kickoff. 

[[Hurricane Ike]] forced several changes to the 2008 schedule. [[2008 Houston Texans season|The Houston Texans]]’ Week 2 home game against [[2008 Baltimore Ravens season|the Baltimore Ravens]] was first postponed to Monday, September 15, before Ike made landfall; damage to [[Reliant Stadium]] forced a further postponement, to Week 10, on Sunday, November 9, giving the Texans and the Ravens their bye weeks in Week 2. Furthermore, to accommodate this move, the Texans’ home game against [[2008 Cincinnati Bengals season|the Cincinnati Bengals]] was moved forward from November 9 to Sunday, October 26, pushing the Bengals’ bye week from Week 8 to Week 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story?id=09000d5d80ac4273&amp;template=without-video&amp;confirm=true |title= Ravens-Texans game postponed; Bengals also affected|accessdate=September 14, 2009 |work=[[NFL.com]]|publisher= |date=September 13, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, a severe storm in Minnesota deposited over {{convert|17|in|m|2|disp=or}} of snow on the [[Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome]], which caused the venue’s inflatable roof (a form of [[dome]] now mostly obsolete for major sports) to collapse about 24 hours later, early in the morning of December 12. [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|The Minnesota Vikings]] had been scheduled to host [[2010 New York Giants season|the New York Giants]] that afternoon. Prior to the collapse, the game had already been postponed to Monday night, December 13, over concerns of stadium officials. The game was relocated to [[Ford Field]] in Detroit, still played Monday night.&lt;ref name=ESPN121210&gt;[http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5911532 Giants-Vikings moved to Ford Field], ESPN.com, December 12, 2010, accessed December 12, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The game would be notable as the ending of [[Brett Favre]]’s NFL-record 297 consecutive starts streak. The Vikings’ December 20 game against [[2010 Chicago Bears season|Chicago]] was moved to [[TCF Bank Stadium]] on the [[University of Minnesota]] campus.&lt;ref name=roofta&gt;[http://www.startribune.com/local/111867304.html Monday's Vikings-Bears game will be played at U's stadium; Dome won't be ready] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101218010554/http://www.startribune.com/local/111867304.html |date=December 18, 2010 }}, ''Star Tribune'', December 14, 2010, Accessed December 14, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The collapse affected no further NFL games, as the rest of the Vikings’ 2010 season consisted of road games, and the team had already been eliminated from playoff contention. The roof collapse was a factor in the Metrodome being demolished and replaced with hard-roofed [[U.S. Bank Stadium]] a few years later.

On December 26, 2010, a ''[[NBC Sunday Night Football|Sunday Night Football]]'' game between [[2010 Minnesota Vikings season|the Minnesota Vikings]] and [[Philadelphia Eagles]] in [[Philadelphia]] was postponed to Tuesday, December 28, by a severe snowstorm. It was the first Tuesday NFL game in 64 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=5956740|title=Fierce storm sacks Vikings-Eagles game|work=[[ESPN]]|date=2010-12-27|accessdate=2012-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a [[November 2014 North American cold wave#United States 2|severe snowstorm]] that hit the [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] area forced a [[2014 New York Jets season|Jets]]–[[2014 Buffalo Bills season|Bills]] game, originally scheduled for November 23, to be moved to Detroit’s indoor [[Ford Field]] on November 24.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nfl.com/news/story/0ap3000000431579/article/jetsbills-game-moved-to-detroit-on-monday-night | title=Jets-Bills game moved to Detroit on Monday night | date=November 20, 2014 | accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Hurricane Irma]] prompted the postponement of a game between [[2017 Miami Dolphins season|the Miami Dolphins]] and [[2017 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]], originally scheduled for September 10, 2017, to November 19; both teams coincidentally were scheduled for the same [[bye (sports)|bye week]], leaving the latter date available for the game to be made up.

==Effects of shared stadiums and sports complexes==
There have also been rare occasions in which games had to be pushed back one night because of a last-minute scheduling conflict in the facility of those games, most notably when an NFL team has shared a home stadium with a team from [[Major League Baseball]] and the baseball team has needed the building for a post-season game. This was a frequent occurrence when there were several shared stadiums across the country, but since 2012 only one such venue remains: [[Oakland Coliseum]] in Oakland, home of the NFL [[Oakland Raiders|Raiders]] and the MLB [[Oakland Athletics|Athletics]]; this arrangement will end by 2020 when the Raiders move to a [[Las Vegas Stadium|purpose-built stadium]] in [[Las Vegas]].

Although NFL/MLB-shared stadiums are now rare instead of the norm, there are several current NFL stadiums that share the same parking lots and other ancillary facilities with an adjacent MLB ballpark, thus also preventing both teams from playing simultaneously. (This also occurs when two NFL franchises in different cities share a common geographic area, namely the [[Oakland Raiders]] and [[San Francisco 49ers]]. The cities and the NFL do not want the teams playing home games on the same day, for Bay Area traffic concerns.)

On October 12, 1964, the [[1964 St. Louis Cardinals (NFL) season|St. Louis Cardinals]] were forced to move their scheduled home game against the [[1964 Baltimore Colts season|Baltimore Colts]] to [[Memorial Stadium (Baltimore)|Memorial Stadium]], since St. Louis' [[Sportsman's Park|Busch Stadium I]] was being used for the [[1964 World Series|World Series]] by the [[St. Louis Cardinals|baseball team also called the St. Louis Cardinals]]. Even though game five of the World Series was played that day at [[Yankee Stadium (1923)|Yankee Stadium]], the football Cardinals could not use the stadium until the baseball team, the stadium's owner, had completed its season.

The [[1969 Atlanta Falcons season|Atlanta Falcons]] were forced to move their October 5, 1969 home game vs. the [[1969 Baltimore Colts season|Colts]] from [[Atlanta–Fulton County Stadium|Atlanta Stadium]] to [[Grant Field]] at [[Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets football|Georgia Tech]] because [[1969 Atlanta Braves season|the Atlanta Braves]] hosted [[1969 New York Mets season|the New York Mets]] in Game 2 of [[1969 National League Championship Series|the National League Championship Series]]. The same day, the [[1969 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]] moved their home game vs. [[1969 Green Bay Packers season|the Green Bay Packers]] from [[Metropolitan Stadium]] to [[Memorial Stadium (University of Minnesota)|Memorial Stadium]] at the [[Minnesota Golden Gophers football|University of Minnesota]] because of an [[1969 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]] game between the [[Minnesota Twins]] and the [[Baltimore Orioles]]. One week later, [[1969 Philadelphia Eagles season|the Philadelphia Eagles]]’ game in Baltimore against [[1969 Baltimore Colts season|the Colts]] was pushed from Sunday, October 12, to Monday night, October 13, to accommodate Game 2 of the [[1969 World Series|World Series]] between the Orioles and the [[1969 New York Mets season|New York Mets]]. The following week, the World Series prompted the [[American Football League]] to move the game at [[Shea Stadium]] between the [[1969 Houston Oilers season|Houston Oilers]] and [[1969 New York Jets season|New York Jets]] from Sunday, October 19, to Monday night, October 20. 

The [[1973 New York Jets season|1973 New York Jets]] faced the same situation as the 1964 Cardinals. [[1973 New York Mets season|The New York Mets]] unexpectedly reached [[1973 World Series|the World Series]], and under the terms of the Jets’ lease at [[Shea Stadium]] in place at the time, there could be no football games at the stadium in Queens until the Mets’ season was complete. Thus, the Jets were forced to move their October 21 game vs. [[1973 Pittsburgh Steelers season|the Pittsburgh Steelers]] from Shea to [[Three Rivers Stadium]], even though the final game of the Series at Shea was played October 18 (games six and seven were played at the [[Oakland–Alameda County Coliseum]], home of [[1973 Oakland Athletics season|the Oakland Athletics]]).

In 1979, [[1979 Philadelphia Eagles season|the Philadelphia Eagles]] and [[1979 Washington Redskins season|Washington Redskins]] switched the dates of their two games with the Eagles hosting the Redskins on October 7th (instead of October 21st) and the Redskins hosting the Eagles on October 21st (instead of October 7th). This was due to the visit of [[Pope John Paul II]] to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] on October 7th. A similar situation happened to the Eagles in 1983 where they were forced to switch the dates of their games with [[1983 Dallas Cowboys season|the Dallas Cowboys]] because [[1983 Philadelphia Phillies season|the Phillies]] were playing the [[1983 World Series]]. The Eagles were originally scheduled to play the Cowboys at [[Veterans Stadium]] on October 16, 1983; however this game conflicted with Game 5 of the World Series. The game was moved to [[Texas Stadium]] and the November 6th game was moved to [[Veterans Stadium]].

In 1987, Game 5 of the [[1987 National League Championship Series|National League Championship Series]] between [[1987 St. Louis Cardinals season|the St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[1987 San Francisco Giants season|the San Francisco Giants]] was held at [[Candlestick Park]], prompting [[1987 San Francisco 49ers|the 49ers]] and [[1987 Atlanta Falcons|Falcons]] to switch home dates for their two games that season; the 49ers visited [[Atlanta-Fulton County Stadium]] on October 11, and the Falcons went to San Francisco on December 20. The October 11 game in Atlanta drew only 8,684, the lowest ever for a Falcons home game up to that point; the game was played during the [[1987 NFL Season|player strike]], so replacement players were used.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/1987/10/12/sports/nfl-montana-and-49ers-hold-off-stand-ins.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the Sunday, October 18 [[World Series]] Game 2 between [[1987 St. Louis Cardinals season|the St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[1987 Minnesota Twins season|the Minnesota Twins]] led to [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|the Vikings]] and [[1987 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season|Tampa Bay Buccaneers]] to switch home dates for their two games that season.

In 1987, the next week, the Sunday, October 25 [[World Series]] Game 7 between [[1987 St. Louis Cardinals season|the St. Louis Cardinals]] and [[1987 Minnesota Twins season|Minnesota Twins]] led the NFL to reschedule the [[1987 Denver Broncos season|Denver Broncos]] at [[1987 Minnesota Vikings season|Minnesota Vikings]]) game to the following Monday night, October 26.

In 1989, the Sunday, October 8 [[1989 New Orleans Saints season|New Orleans Saints]] and [[1989 San Francisco 49ers season|San Francisco 49ers]] switched home dates (October 8 originally in San Francisco and November 6 originally in New Orleans) to accommodate the MLB's National League Championship Series [[1989 Chicago Cubs season|Chicago Cubs]] at [[1989 San Francisco Giants season|San Francisco Giants]] games on October 7, 8, and 9.  

In 1997, the Sunday, October 26 [[1997 Cleveland Indians season|Cleveland Indians]] at [[1997 Florida Marlins season|Florida Marlins]] [[World Series]] game caused the NFL to reschedule the [[1997 Chicago Bears season|Chicago Bears]] at [[1997 Miami Dolphins season|Miami Dolphins]] game for the following Monday night, October 27.&lt;ref&gt;http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/football/nfl/2005-10-20-chiefs-dolphins-moved_x.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, a potential [[2001 Oakland Athletics season|Oakland Athletics]] baseball playoff game forced [[2001 Oakland Raiders season|the Oakland Raiders]] to play their contest against [[2001 Dallas Cowboys season|the Dallas Cowboys]] two weeks in advance to avoid a possible conflict, when both clubs originally had their [[Bye (sports)|bye week]] (as it turned out, the Athletics ended up getting eliminated a few days before the originally scheduled date of the Cowboys–Raiders game).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/sports/nfl/stories/2001-09-19-cowboys-raiders-reschedule.htm |title=Cowboys-Raiders game moved to Oct. 21|publisher=USA Today | work=Associated Press |date=September 19, 2001 |accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the [[2009 New York Giants season|New York Giants]]–[[2009 Philadelphia Eagles season|Philadelphia Eagles]] game at [[Lincoln Financial Field]] was moved from 4:15 pm to 1:00 pm to accommodate [[2009 Philadelphia Phillies season|the Philadelphia Phillies]] hosting Game 4 of the [[2009 World Series]] at adjacent [[Citizens Bank Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sports.espn.go.com/nfl/news/story?id=4556151 |title=NFL changes times as Series looms|publisher=ESPN.com | work=Associated Press |date=October 13, 2009 |accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, [[2013 Oakland Athletics season|the Oakland Athletics]] playing in the [[2013 American League Division Series|ALDS]] against the [[Detroit Tigers]] forced the [[Oakland Raiders]] to postpone their originally scheduled Sunday afternoon game against [[2013 San Diego Chargers season|the San Diego Chargers]] from 4:25 pm Eastern/1:25 pm Pacific to a late-night start time of 11:35 Eastern/8:35 Pacific.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Gutierrez, Paul |title=Raiders to have late kickoff Sunday |url=http://espn.go.com/nfl/story/_/id/9750876/oakland-playoff-game-forces-oakland-raiders-start-1135-pm-et |work=ESPN |date=September 30, 2013 |accessdate=October 18, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The opening game of the 2013 season, which would traditionally have been hosted by the Baltimore Ravens as defending [[Super Bowl XLVII]] champions, was instead a Ravens road game at the Denver Broncos because of a conflict with a [[2013 Baltimore Orioles season|Baltimore Orioles]] home game at [[Oriole Park at Camden Yards]] and insufficient parking for both venues.

A '''cattle prod''', also called a '''stock prod''', is a handheld device commonly used to make [[cattle]] or other [[livestock]] move by striking or poking them.  An '''electric cattle prod''' is a stick with electrodes on the end which is used to make cattle move through a relatively high-voltage, low-current [[electric shock]]. The electric cattle prod is said to have been invented by Texas cattle baron [[Robert J. Kleberg (King Ranch)|Robert J. Kleberg, Jr.]]&lt;ref name="Broyles"&gt;{{cite web

== Terminology differences ==
[[File:Electric cattle prod 1917.png|250px|thumb|upright=1.3|An ad for an electric cattle prod in 1917 magazine]]
Ranchers and farmers typically use the term "cattle prods" mainly to refer to simple non-electrified [[fiberglass]] or [[metal]] [[goad]]s used to physically encourage cattle into motion; the majority of people living outside of rural areas use the term 'cattle prod' exclusively for the electrified variant. Most ranchers and farmers refer to electric cattle prods as "hotshots"{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}} (this is an example of a [[genericized trademark]]; one of the most prominent [[brand]]s of electric prod is Hot-Shot).&lt;ref name="torture democracy"&gt;{{cite book |title= Torture and democracy|last= Rejali|first= Darius|authorlink=Darius Rejali |year= 2007|publisher= Princeton University Press|location= Princeton, New Jersey|isbn= 0-691-11422-6|page= 228|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an electric cattle prod, which is the precursor to the modern day stun gun, dual surface [[electrodes]] produce a very high [[voltage]]/very low [[electric current|current]] [[electric arc]] between them, which, when pressed against conductive skin, produces a painful but superficial electric shock which stimulates the target to cease their current activity and move in the direction opposite the source of the pain. With higher current, the cattle prod is the equivalent of a stun gun and functions exactly the same way. Cattle prods are the precursor to direct contact [[electric stun gun]]s used against humans, and their basic operating principles are the same. The major differences are primarily in the matter of size and power: cattle prods tend to have a higher [[electric current]] and a longer handle than stun guns, which is helpful when dealing with very large, powerful animals.

== Regular prods ==
{{Unreferenced section|date=December 2008}}
Regular cattle prods can actually be anything from a baton ([[goad]]) or piece of pipe properly wired, to a manufactured [[fiberglass]] rod with a rubber handle or even a rectangular-shaped device similar to today's stun guns, which also feature batons. Most prods use two metal tips, but some are rubberized for herding stubborn animals. A [[Wiffleball]] bat is also often used as an effective prod because the hollow plastic bat makes a sharp ringing sound when slapped against the skin.

Unlike hotshots, which produce high voltage and can be effective on humans,  regular cattle prods used on animals are simply used to tap, strike, or poke an animal (usually on the flanks), depending on how stubborn the animal is. Sometimes, a prod can be used as a sort of "extended fence", allowing one to simply intimidate skittish animals away from open gates or downed fences without having to touch them.

== Electric prods ==
A hotshot is typically [[cylindrical]], and can carry an open [[electric current]] at the "shock end" when activated. The electric current at the shock end runs through two metal electrodes. Anything that touches the electric current receives a high-[[voltage]] low-[[ampere|current]] shock, not strong enough to kill a human or a large animal such as a cow or sheep from short-term exposure, but strong enough to cause significant pain.

The electric cattle prod is designed to inflict a painful shock to cattle, and thus "prod" them along; the pain stimulates movement. Some higher-voltage prods can interfere with [[radio]] and [[CB radio]] reception when activated.{{Citation needed|date=December 2008}}

There are various designs of electric cattle prods. Their shape is often subject to guidelines of what can easily be used and handled. They range in length from six inches (usually of a more encased rectangular [[prism (geometry)|prism]] design like a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]]), to up to six feet. As the precursor of stun guns, cattle prods also have a wide range of voltage with enough current to operate in the same manner as a stun gun does against humans. A stun gun is nothing more than a beefed up cattle prod and both can be used on humans or animals by design. Whether it is called a cattle prod or a stun gun, both units are shaped for easy carry and function in the same manner against animals or humans. Most are simple designs powered by 9-volt or a combination of other types of batteries. Anything out of that range is usually too heavy and unwieldy for practical use.

=== Usage on people, policing, torture and treatment ===

Cattle prods today are designed with a high range of voltages and currents. If more powerful prods are applied continuously to the skin, the current eventually causes heating, [[searing]], burning, and scarring of skin at the contact point. Electric prods have found favour with torturers.&lt;ref name="NewInternationist2000"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Crowley |first1=Michael |title=Trading In Shock |url=https://newint.org/features/2000/09/05/trading |accessdate=29 November 2017 |work=New Internationalist |issue=327 |date=5 September 2000 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161022143826/https://newint.org/features/2000/09/05/trading/ |archivedate=2016-10-22 |quote=Electroshock weapons have become a favoured tool of many of the world's torturers. The 'torture trail' has often begun with companies in Europe and the US. |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the development of [[stun baton]]s and the [[taser]], electric cattle prods were also used on people in varying degrees. Their first common usage on people occurred during the [[Civil Rights Movement]] of the 1960s; prods were first adopted by police officers in [[Alabama]] to use on protesters and agencies elsewhere followed; Hotshot later developed an electric police baton.&lt;ref name="torture democracy"/&gt;

The [[picana]] is an electric prod based originally on the cattle prod but designed specifically for human torture. It works at very high voltage and low current so as to maximize pain and minimize the physical marks left on the victim. Among its advantages over other torture devices is that it is portable, easy to use, and allows the torturer to localize the electric shocks to the most sensitive places on the body, where they cause intense pain that can be repeated many times.

Electric prods have been used for the control of adverse self-injuring behavior in mentally handicapped people. This use is regarded by some advocates to be more effective than drugs since the experience of a shock is very short and temporary while using a drug may have long-lasting sedative effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Kersey |first1=Brian |title=Autistic man's care renews shocking debate |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17616714/ |accessdate=29 November 2017 |agency=Associated Press |date=March 14, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160306120741/http://www.nbcnews.com/id/17616714/ |archivedate=2016-03-06 |quote=Bradley Bernstein’s parents say an electric cattle prod is the only thing that stops him from banging his head and violently punching his eyes, nearly blinding himself. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cattle can be difficult to move and direct for a variety of reasons. Prods can be useful for moving stubborn or aggressive animals,&lt;ref name="grandin20"&gt;{{cite book |title= Animals in Translation|last= Grandin|first= Temple|authorlink= Temple Grandin|author2=Johnson, Catherine|year= 2005|publisher= Scribner|location= New York, New York|isbn= 0-7432-4769-8|page= 20|pages= |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but often cattle will not move forward when they are fearful of something they see, hear, or smell. Removal of these distractions or hiding them, such as with solid wall partitions, can greatly reduce animal handling problems,&lt;ref&gt;Link to Temple Grandin's website page, discussing common distractions that prevent animal movement through chutes and gates, with pictures of the distractions from the animal's viewpoint, [http://www.grandin.com/behaviour/principles/distraction.html grandin.com]&lt;/ref&gt; however, cattle handlers cannot completely overcome the animal's decision not to move forward.

By studying the psychology of the animals and redesigning the working environment it is possible to handle the animals without the need for brute force and causing pain and suffering to the animal in many, but not all, cases. Significant work in this regard has been done by [[Colorado State University]] professor [[Temple Grandin]] to study how cattle perceive the environment around them and to design better livestock [[slaughterhouse]] handling systems that do not induce fear into the animal.&lt;ref&gt;Grandin, T.

'''''Clybourne Park''''' is a 2010 play by [[Bruce Norris (playwright)|Bruce Norris]] written as a spin-off to [[Lorraine Hansberry]]'s play ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'' (1959). It portrays fictional events set before and after the Hansberry play, and is loosely based on historical events that took place in the city of Chicago. It premiered in February 2010 at [[Playwrights Horizons]] in New York.&lt;ref name="playbill1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.playbill.com/news/article/136395-Clybourne-Park-With-Wood-Parisse-Shamos-and-More-Begins-NYC-World-Premiere|title=Clybourne Park, With Wood, Parisse, Shamos and More, Begins NYC World Premiere|work=[[Playbill]]|accessdate=2011-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The play received its UK premiere at the [[Royal Court Theatre]] in [[London]] in a production directed by [[Dominic Cooke]].

==Plot==
===Act I: 1959===
Grieving parents Bev and Russ are planning to sell their home in the white middle-class Chicago neighborhood of Clybourne Park. They receive a visit from their local clergyman, Jim, as well as their neighbor Karl and his deaf, pregnant wife Betsy. Karl informs them that the family buying their house is black, and pleads with Russ to back out of the deal, for fear that falling area property values will drive the Lindners' neighbors away and isolate them if black residents move in. It becomes apparent that the black family moving in are the Youngers, the protagonists of ''[[A Raisin in the Sun]]'', and the neighbor is Karl Lindner, the minor character from that play who attempted to bribe the Youngers into abandoning their plans to move into the neighborhood. The action is taking place approximately an hour following Karl Lindner's departure from the Youngers' Hamilton Park residence, where they have rejected his bribery attempt.  As arguments ensue about the potential problems of integrating the neighborhood, both couples awkwardly call on Russ and Bev's black housekeeper and her husband, Francine and Albert, to express their opposing views. Russ finally snaps and throws everyone out of the house, saying he no longer cares about his neighbors after their community's shunning his son Kenneth when he returned home from the Korean War, which contributed to Kenneth's suicide, which occurred inside the house.

===Act II: 2009===
Set in the same home as Act I, the same actors reappear playing different characters. In the intervening fifty years, Clybourne Park has become an all-black neighborhood, which is now [[gentrification|gentrifying]]. A white couple, Steve and Lindsay (played by the same actors who played Karl and Betsy in Act I), are seeking to buy, raze and rebuild the house at a larger scale, and are being forced to negotiate local housing regulations with a black couple, Kevin and Lena (played by the same actors as Francine and Albert), who represent the housing board. Lena is related to the  Younger family (and named after matriarch Lena Younger), and is unwilling to have the house torn down. Steve and Lindsay's lawyer, Kathy (played by Bev) is revealed to be the daughter of Karl and his deaf wife, Betsy, and mentions that her family moved out of the neighborhood around the time of her birth. A cordial discussion of housing codes soon degenerates into one of racial issues, instigated by a concerned Steve, who feels that the mask of "political correctness" is allowing for a more subtle kind of prejudice against them. The alternating disgust and dismissal that follows reveals resentments from both parties, and several awkward comments lead to Steve being goaded into telling a racist, homophobic joke that offends both Kevin and the other lawyer, Tom (played by Jim), who is gay. The discussion is interrupted several times by Dan (played by Russ), a workman who has found Kenneth's army trunk buried in the back yard. As fighting erupts and the two couples turn on each other and themselves, Dan opens the trunk and finds Kenneth's suicide note.

In a short coda, we see Bev back in 1957, catching her son awake late at night, dressed in his army uniform. He claims to be dressing for a job interview, though it is clear that he is in the act of writing his suicide note. Leaving him to tend to the house, Bev observes that "I really believe things are about to change for the better."

===Historical context===
Hansberry's parents bought a house in the white neighborhood of [[Washington Park, Chicago (neighborhood)|Washington Park]], an action that resulted in a legal case (''[[Hansberry v. Lee]]'', 311 U.S. 32 [1940]).&lt;ref&gt;Brantley, Ben, "Good Defenses Make Good Neighbors", ''The New York Times'', February 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The Hansberry family home, a red brick three-floor at 6140 S. Rhodes, which they bought in 1937, is up for landmark status before the Chicago City Council's Committee on Historical Landmarks Preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Ihejirika, Maudlyne|url=http://www.suntimes.com/news/metro/2031043,CST-NWS-raisin05.article|title='Raisin in the Sun' home for landmark?|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=February 5, 2010|accessdate=May 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Early music festivals''' is a generic term for musical festivals focused on music before [[Ludwig van Beethoven|Beethoven]], or including [[historically informed performance]] of later works. The increase in the number of [[music festival]]s specializing in [[early music]] is a reflection of the [[early music revival]] of the 1970s and 1980s. Many larger festivals such as that an [[Aix-en-Provence Festival]] also include early music sections, as do, inevitably, festivals of sacred music; such as the Festival de Música Sacra do Baixo Alentejo, in [[Portugal]]. Although most early music festivals are centered on commercial performance, many include also workshops. This articles includes an '''incomplete list of early music festivals''', which may overlap with topics such as [[Bach festival#List of Bach festivals|list of Bach festivals]], [[list of maritime music festivals]], [[list of opera festivals]], and in some cases [[list of folk festivals]].

The '''International Edible Book Festival''' is an annual event usually held on or around April 1, which is also known as '''Edible Book Day'''.&lt;ref name="week"&gt;{{cite news |url = http://week.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/theWeekContent.do?BV_ID=@@@&amp;contentType=EDITORIAL&amp;sectionName=TheWeek%20Lifestyle&amp;programId=1073755413&amp;contentId=6895557 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20110714032142/http://week.manoramaonline.com/cgi-bin/MMOnline.dll/portal/ep/theWeekContent.do?BV_ID=%40%40%40&amp;contentType=EDITORIAL&amp;sectionName=TheWeek%20Lifestyle&amp;programId=1073755413&amp;contentId=6895557 |dead-url = yes |archive-date = July 14, 2011 |title = Write Bite |date = March 21, 2010 |work = [[The Week]] |publisher = Malayala Manorama Publications |location = Kochi, Kerala |access-date = March 18, 2010 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The global event has been celebrated since 2000 in various parts of the world, where "edible books" are created, displayed, and small events are held. The creations are photographed and then consumed.&lt;ref name="week"/&gt; Regular contributors to the site are groups from Australia, Brazil, India, Italy, Japan, Luxembourg, Mexico, Morocco, The Netherlands, Russia, and Hong Kong. The event was initiated by Judith A. Hoffberg and Béatrice Coron in 2000.&lt;ref name="week"/&gt;

[[Image:Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin.jpg|thumb|Title page of "Physiologie du Goût" ("Physiology of Taste") by French gastronome [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]] (1755–1826) with a portrait of the author. 1848 edition.]]
The official website &lt;nowiki&gt;Books2Eat.com&lt;/nowiki&gt; says that the International Edible Book Festival is held to commemorate "the birthday of French gastronome [[Jean Anthelme Brillat-Savarin]] (1755–1826), noted for his book ''Physiologie du goût'', a witty meditation on food", though [[April Fools' Day]] is also related as "the perfect day to eat your words and play with them as the 'books' are consumed on the day of the event".&lt;ref name="books2eat"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.books2eat.com |title = International Edible Book Festival |publisher = Diffusion [[Adage]] |access-date = April 1, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (cf. ''[[The Phantom Tollbooth]]'', as regards eating one's words.)

==Rules==
The participation rules per a related site are:&lt;ref name="books2eat"/&gt;
* The event must be held on April 1 or around it
* "All edible books must be 'bookish' through the integration of text, literary inspiration or, quite simply, the form."
* "Organizations or individual participants must register with the festival’s organization ... and see to it that the event is immortalized on the international festival website ( http://www.books2eat.beatricecoron.com/ )." It should be noted that this site is collecting photographs for publication in a book. 

==Celebrations==

In 2005, the festival was a joint initiative of forum book art and the Museum of Work, [[Hamburg]], where pastry chefs made edible books. The "book art" was displayed, photographed, and then eaten.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Heinz Stefan |last = Bartkowiak |chapter = The Sixth International Book Festival: 2005 |title = Kompendium zeitgenössischer Handpressendrucke, Malerbücher, Künstlerbücher, Einblattdrucke, Mappenwerke und Buchobjekte |trans-title = Compendium of Contemporary  Fine Prints, Artists' Books, Broadsides, Portfolios  and Book Objects |language = German, English |location = Hamburg |publisher = Bartkowiaks Forum Book Art |year = 2005 |chapter-url = https://books.google.com/?id=VFa4ctd1ReUC&amp;pg=PA25 |page = 25 |isbn = 9783935462044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the event was celebrated in [[Los Angeles]], too, at the Los Angeles Book Arts Center as the ''Annual International Edible Book High/Low Tea'' on April 2, where artists were encouraged to create and consume tomes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=Q18EAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA156 |title = 6th Annual International Edible Book High/Low Tea |date = Apr 2005 |work = Los Angeles Magazine |page = 156 |access-date = March 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2006 [[Indianapolis Monthly]] described the [[Indianapolis]] festival as a "quirky event" held on April Fools' Day, "celebrating both food and literature." Participants created foods resembling literary titles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title = International Edible Book Festival |date = Apr 2006 |work = [[Indianapolis Monthly]]  |pages = 66 &lt;!--|access-date = March 18, 2010--&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[University of Florida]] library holds the event as the '''Edible Book Contest''' in April, in connection with [[National Library Week]]. There are two rules for the contest: Entries should be edible, and they must somehow relate to a book. Besides edible books, other entries include "edible book trucks" and "edible bookmarks". The event kicks off with viewing of the entries, each of which has an information card describing the book title, author, and creator of the book art. The "books" are judged by a panel of judges and by public voting. Awards are given in categories like: Most Creative, Least Edible, Best Overall Fiction, Best Overall Non-Fiction, and Best Children's Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Malanchuk |first = Iona R. |title = Librarians As Community Partners: An Outreach Handbook |editor-first = Carol |editor-last = Smallwood |publisher = ALA Editions |year = 2010 |pages = 3–5 |chapter = Bake a Book and they will come |url = https://books.google.com/?id=O_-iFcSpsMYC&amp;pg=PA5 |isbn = 9780838910061 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, the event is planned to be held on April 15 and the award categories are: Best Overall Entry, Best Book Theme, Best Pun, Best Adult Book, and Best Children's Book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://blogs.uflib.ufl.edu/news/2010/03/15/call-for-readers-and-edible-book-entries/ |title = Call for Readers and Edible Book Entries |date = March 15, 2010 |publisher = UF Library |access-date = March 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Perkins Library at [[Hastings College]] in Nebraska (US) celebrated [[Banned Books Week]] 2008 by holding an edible book contest.  The event invited guests to consume cooked dishes and baked goods that resembled covers of banned books or reflected their content.  A reporter sums up the aptly named event: "Our celebration took Sir [[Francis Bacon]]'s famous words quite literally: 'Some books are to be tasted, others to be swallowed, and the other few to be chewed and digested.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first = Mark R. |last = Gould |title = The Library PR Handbook: High-Impact Communications |publisher = ALA Editions |year = 2009 |pages = 51–52 |chapter = Additional Tasty Examples of Food as a Promotional Tool |url = https://books.google.com/?id=zbUe2e-Z2b4C&amp;pg=PA51 |isbn = 9780838997260 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, the British newspaper [[Metro (British newspaper)|''Metro'']] ran a story that they would begin producing the newspaper on an edible "Sweet tasting paper" claiming to bring customers "news in the best possible taste".  The newspaper later clarified this was nothing more than an [[April Fools' joke]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.worldofdeals.co.uk/other-electronics-deals/top-15-april-fools-2011-shopping-and-deals-pranks |title = Top 15 April Fool’s 2011 Shopping and Deals Pranks |date = April 1, 2011 |access-date = April 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Elder Pastitsios''' ({{lang-ell|Γέρων/Γέροντας Παστίτσιος}}, ''Géron/Gérontas Pastítsios'') is a [[Satire|satirical]] figure of a fictitious [[monk]] who first appeared in a [[Facebook page]]. The satire is mostly based on the famous [[Greeks|Greek]] [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox]] monk [[Elder Paisios of Mount Athos|Elder Paisios]], with his name and face substituted by [[pastitsio]] — a local [[pasta]] and [[béchamel sauce]] dish, thus combining Greek Orthodox and  [[Pastafarian]] imagery.&lt;ref name=facebook&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.facebook.com/gerontas.pastitsios/timeline?filter=2|title=ΓΕΡΟΝΤΑΣ ΠΑΣΤΙΤΣΙΟΣ - ELDER PASTITSIOS|last1=Loizos|first1=Philippos|publisher=Facebook|date=2012|language=Greek|accessdate=October 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The page ran for about a year until it was closed down after the arrest of its creator for [[blasphemy]] on [[Portal:Current events/2012 September 21|September 21, 2012]]. The case, which started as a Facebook [[Flaming (Internet)|flame]], reached the [[Hellenic Parliament|Greek Parliament]] twice and created a strong local as well as international [[political]] impact.

==Background==
The main satire of the page revolved around [[Elder Paisios]] (d. 1994), a monk from [[Mount Athos|Holy Mountain]], famous for his spiritual teachings. Much has been written about his person and his prophecies concerning the [[End time]]s, the upbringing of children, couples' relationships, even the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] Paisios supposedly followed. High-ranking priests as well as believers have proposed that the Elder should be [[glorification|recognised]] as a [[Saint]] by the [[Greek Orthodox church|Orthodox Church]].&lt;ref name=csmonitor /&gt; The page criticised, among others, the exploitation of Paisios by the press and by Orthodox [[website]]s that propagate the alleged [[prophecies]] and teachings of the [[charisma]]tic Elder (according to his followers he had predicted the [[fall of the Soviet Union]] and the recent [[Greek government-debt crisis|Greek crisis]]).&lt;ref name=prin /&gt;

The "Elder Pastitsios" page satirised and criticised (with no reported profanity according to the media),&lt;ref name=csmonitor /&gt; various [[Orthodoxy in Greece|religious aspects in Greece]] such as [[infant baptism]], [[religious education]] in schools and the lack of separation between [[church and state]]; these were presented through the eyes of the [[Pastafarian]] [[Parody religion|satirical pseudo-religion]] "Church of the Flying Spaghetti Monster", which has been used to lampoon the teaching of [[creationism]] in schools.&lt;ref name=csmonitor /&gt;

The page created a [[hoax]] about a posthumous [[miracle]] by Elder Paisios&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fimes.gr/2012/09/gerontas-pastitsios/|script-title=el:Το θαύμα που επινόησε ο Γέρων Παστίτσιος|publisher=fimes.gr|date=September 26, 2012|language=Greek|trans-title=The miracle that Elder Pastitsios invented|accessdate=September 30, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was submitted to various Orthodox, conservative and far-right blogs in July. The story was based on several existing accounts that were already [[reblogging|circulating online]] and involved the miraculous recovery of a teenager who supposedly woke from a [[coma]] after his mother placed a [[talisman]] with dirt from Elder Paisios’ grave under his pillow.

The story reached 93,800 [[Google search]] results and was reproduced both online and in print, and even became a cover story on the far-right newspaper "Eleftheri Ora".&lt;ref name=seleo /&gt; The 27-year-old page creator would later state that he did this to expose the gullibility of the faithful, and also to show the poor fact-checking done among the religious and conservative [[blogosphere]].&lt;ref name=vaxevanis /&gt;

Four days before the page creator's arrest, [[Member of Parliament|MP]] Christos Pappas from the far-right [[Golden Dawn (Greece)|Golden Dawn]] party had brought the page to the attention of the [[Minister of Justice (Greece)|Minister of Justice]] by raising a [[Question time|question]] to the Greek Parliament on September 17.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newpost.gr/post/155764/%CE%95%CF%81%CF%8E%CF%84%CE%B7%CF%83%CE%B7-%CF%83%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%92%CE%BF%CF%85%C3%8E-%CE%AE-%CE%B1%CF%80%CF%8C-%CF%84%CE%B7-%CE%A7%CF%81%CF%85%CF%83%CE%AE-%CE%91%CF%85%CE%B3%CE%AE-%CE%B3%CE%B9%CE%B1-%CF%84%CE%BF%CE%BD----%CE%93%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%BF%CE%BD%CF%84%CE%B1-%CE%A0%CE%B1%CF%83%CF%84%CE%AF%CF%84%CF%83%CE%B9%CE%BF/|script-title=el:Ερώτηση στη Βουλή από τη Χρυσή Αυγή για τον...

{{Paranormal}}
The '''Enfield Poltergeist''' is the name given to claimed [[supernatural]] activity at 284 Green Street, a [[council house]] in [[Brimsdown]], [[London Borough of Enfield|Enfield]], [[England]] between 1977 and 1979 involving two sisters, aged 11 and 13.&lt;ref name="Storr 2015"&gt;Storr, Will. (2015). [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/11571607/The-real-story-of-the-Enfield-Haunting.html "The Real Story of the Enfield Haunting"]. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Retrieved 3 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Some members of the [[Society for Psychical Research]] such as inventor [[Maurice Grosse]] and writer [[Guy Lyon Playfair]] believed the haunting to be genuine, while others such as [[Anita Gregory]] and [[John Beloff]] were "unconvinced" and found evidence the girls had faked incidents for the benefit of reporters. Members of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]], including stage magicians such as [[Milbourne Christopher]], [[Joe Nickell]] and Bob Couttie, reviewed the case and criticised paranormal investigators for being overly credulous whilst also identifying features of the case as being indicative of a [[hoax]].&lt;ref&gt;Couttie, Bob. (1988). ''Forbidden Knowledge: The Paranormal Paradox''. Lutterworth Press. p. 62. {{ISBN|978-0-7188-2686-4}} "The case remains very controversial. Grosse, Playfair, Hasted and others believe it was genuine, Anita Gregory and other members of the SPR were unconvinced. Magicians and ventriloquists came to the conclusion that Janet was cheating."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NickellCSI&gt;{{cite web |last=Nickell |first=Joe |title=Enfield Poltergeist |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/enfield_poltergeist |website=CSI |publisher=Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal |accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hyde 2015"&gt;[[Deborah Hyde|Hyde, Deborah]].

Retrieved 2 May 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

The story attracted considerable press coverage in British newspapers such as the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Daily Mirror]]'', and has been the subject of books, featured in [[television]] documentaries, and dramatised in [[horror film]]s.

==Claims==
In August 1977 single parent Peggy Hodgson called police to her rented home in Enfield after two of her four children said that furniture was moving and knocking sounds were heard on walls. The children included Margaret, age 14, and Janet, 11. A police constable said that she saw a chair "wobble and slide".&lt;ref name=NickellCSI/&gt; Later claims included disembodied voices, loud noises, thrown rocks and toys, overturned chairs, and children [[levitation (paranormal)|levitating]].&lt;ref name="Storr 2015"/&gt; Over a period of 18 months, more than 30 people, including neighbours, psychic researchers and journalists, said they saw heavy furniture moving of its own accord, objects being thrown across a room and the daughters seeming to levitate several feet off the ground. Many also heard—and recorded—unexplained knocking noises and a gruff voice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Reunion, The Enfield Poltergeist|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/b09yck6b |website=BBC Radio 4 |publisher=British Broadcasting Corporation |accessdate=13 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The activity in the house attracted considerable press attention and the story was covered in British newspapers such as the ''[[Daily Mail]]'' and ''[[Daily Mirror]]'' until reports came to an end in 1979.&lt;ref name=NickellCSI/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickell2012"&gt;{{cite book |author=Joe Nickell |title=The Science of Ghosts: Searching for Spirits of the Dead |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oGS67QhECywC&amp;pg=PT281 |date=3 July 2012 |publisher=Prometheus Books |isbn=978-1-61614-586-6 |pages=281–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Investigations==
===Paranormal===
[[Society for Psychical Research]] members [[Maurice Grosse]] and [[Guy Lyon Playfair]] reported "curious whistling and barking noises coming from Janet's general direction." Although Playfair maintained the [[haunting]] was genuine and wrote in his later book ''This House Is Haunted: The True Story of a Poltergeist'' (1980) that an "entity" was to blame for the disturbances, he often doubted the children's veracity and wondered if they were playing tricks and exaggerating. Still, Grosse and Playfair believed that even though some of the alleged [[poltergeist]] activity was faked by the girls, other incidents were genuine.&lt;ref name=NickellCSI/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickell2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Playfair|first=Guy Lyon|title=This House Is Haunted: The True Story of a Poltergeist|publisher=Stein and Day|year=1980|isbn=978-0-7387-1867-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Janet was detected in trickery; a video camera in the room next door caught her bending spoons and attempting to bend an iron bar.&lt;ref&gt;Guiley, Rosemary (1994).

''Poltergeists: Examining Mysteries of the Paranormal''. Firefly Books. p. 135. {{ISBN|978-1554071593}} "Anita Gregory, of the Society for Psychical Research, who had spent just a short time at the Hodgson home, said the mysterious men's voices were simply the result of Janet and Margaret putting bed sheets to their mouths. In addition, Gregory said that a video camera had caught Janet attempting to bend spoons and an iron bar by force and "practicing" levitation by bouncing up and down on her bed."&lt;/ref&gt; Grosse had observed Janet banging a broom handle on the ceiling and hiding his tape-recorder.&lt;ref name="Couttie 1988"&gt;Couttie, Bob. (1988). ''Forbidden Knowledge: The Paranormal Paradox''. Lutterworth Press. pp. 62-64. {{ISBN|978-0-7188-2686-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Playfair, one of Janet's voices she called "Bill" displayed a "habit of suddenly changing the topic—it was a habit Janet also had".&lt;ref name="Hyde 2015"/&gt;

When Janet and Margaret admitted "pranking" to reporters, Grosse and Playfair compelled the girls to retract their confession.&lt;ref name=NickellCSI/&gt; They were mocked by other researchers for being easily duped.&lt;ref&gt;Carlson, H. G. (1994). ''Mysteries of the Unexplained''. Contemporary Books. p. 46. {{ISBN|978-0809234974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The psychical researcher [[Renée Haynes]] had noted that doubts were raised about the alleged poltergeist voice at the Second International SPR Conference at Cambridge in 1978, where video cassettes from the case were examined.&lt;ref&gt;Haynes, Renée. (1982). ''The Society for Psychical Research 1882-1982: A History''. MacDonald &amp; Co. p. 112. {{ISBN|978-0356078755}}&lt;/ref&gt; The SPR investigator [[Anita Gregory]] stated the Enfield poltergeist case had been "overrated", characterising several episodes of the girls' behaviour as "suspicious" and speculated that the girls had "staged" some incidents for the benefit of reporters seeking a sensational story.&lt;ref name=NickellCSI/&gt;&lt;ref name="Nickell2012"/&gt; [[John Beloff]], a former president of the SPR, investigated and suggested Janet was practicing [[ventriloquism]]. Both Beloff and Gregory came to the conclusion that Janet and Margaret were playing tricks on the investigators.&lt;ref&gt;Clarkson, Michael. (2006). ''Poltergeists: Examining Mysteries of the Paranormal''. Firefly Books. p. 131. {{ISBN|978-1554071593}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other===
American magician [[Milbourne Christopher]] briefly investigated, failed to observe anything that could be called paranormal and was dismayed by what he felt was suspicious activity on the part of Janet. Christopher would later conclude that "the poltergeist was nothing more than the antics of a little girl who wanted to cause trouble and who was very, very, clever."&lt;ref name=NickellCSI/&gt; Ventriloquist [[Ray Alan]] visited the house and concluded that Janet's male voices were simply vocal tricks.&lt;ref name=NickellCSI/&gt;

==Sceptical Interpretations==
===Criticisms of investigations===
Sceptic [[Joe Nickell]] examined the findings of paranormal investigators and criticised them for being overly credulous; when a supposedly disembodied demonic voice was heard, Playfair noted that, "as always Janet's lips hardly seemed to be moving."

Nickell states that a remote-controlled still camera—the photographer was not present in the room with the girls—timed to take a picture every fifteen seconds was shown by investigator [[Melvin Harris]] to reveal "pranking" by the girls. He argues that a photo allegedly depicting Janet levitating actually shows her bouncing off the bed as if it were a trampoline. Harris called the photos examples of common "gymnastics", and said "It's worth remembering that Janet was a school sports champion!"

Nickell asserted that a [[tape recorder]] malfunction that Grosse attributed to supernatural activity and [[Society for Psychical Research]] president [[David Fontana]] described as an occurrence "which appeared to defy the laws of mechanics" was a peculiar threading jam capable of occurring with older model [[reel to reel]] tape recorders.&lt;ref name="Nickell 3"&gt;{{cite web |last=Nickell |first=Joe |title=The Haunted Tape Recorder |url=http://www.csicop.org/sb/show/haunted_tape_recorder |website=CSI |publisher=Committee for the Scientific Investigation of Claims of the Paranormal |accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nickell also claimed that [[Demonology|demonologist]] [[Ed and Lorraine Warren|Ed Warren]] was "notorious for exaggerating and even making up incidents in such cases, often transforming a "haunting" case into one of "demonic possession".&lt;ref name=NickellCSI/&gt;

In 2015, [[Deborah Hyde]] commented that there was no solid evidence for the Enfield poltergeist: "... the first thing to note is that the occurrences didn't happen under controlled circumstances. People frequently see what they expect to see, their senses being organised and shaped by their prior experiences and beliefs."&lt;ref name="Hyde 2015"/&gt;

===Response to claims===
Sceptics have argued that the alleged poltergeist voice that originated from Janet was produced by [[false vocal cords]] above the [[larynx]] and had the [[phraseology]] and [[vocabulary]] of a child.&lt;ref name="Couttie 1988"/&gt; In a television interview for [[BBC Scotland]], Janet was observed to gain attention by waving her hand, and then putting her hand in front of her mouth while a claimed "disembodied" voice was heard. During the interview both girls were asked the question "How does it feel to be haunted by a poltergeist?" Janet replied "It's not haunted" and Margaret, in a hushed tone, interrupted "Shut up". These factors have been regarded by sceptics as evidence against the case.&lt;ref name="Couttie 1988"/&gt;

As "a magician experienced in the dynamics of trickery", Nickell examined Playfair's account as well as contemporary press clippings. He noted that the supposed poltergeist "tended to act only when it was not being watched" and concluded that the incidents were best explained as children's pranks.&lt;ref name=NickellCSI/&gt; In an interview with the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', the adult Janet admitted that she and her sister had faked "2 percent" of the phenomena. This prompted Nickell to comment in another publication, "the evidence suggests that this figure is closer to 100 percent".&lt;ref name="Nickell2012"/&gt;

Although Maurice Grosse made tape recordings of Janet and believed no trickery was involved, the magician Bob Couttie said, "he made some of the recordings available to me and, having listened to them very carefully, I came to the conclusion that there was nothing in what I had heard that was beyond the capabilities of an imaginative teenager."&lt;ref name="Couttie 1988"/&gt; An article by psychology professor [[Chris French]] in 2016 described five reasons why he believed the case to have been a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timeout.com/london/blog/five-reasons-why-londons-most-famous-poltergeist-case-is-a-hoax-061616 "Five reasons why London's most famous poltergeist case is a hoax"].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3520">'''FESPA''' is a federation of [[trade association]]s and an organiser of exhibitions and conferences for the [[screenprinting]] and [[digital printing]] industry.  The name originally stood for '''Federation of European Screen Printers Associations''', but, with the advent of digital technology, FESPA is now known by its acronym.

==Overview==
FESPA is a "federation of global screen, textile and [[digital printing]] trade associations" servicing its members and the print community at large. FESPA are also an events and [[exhibitions]] organiser for the [[Wide-format printer|wide format]], [[screenprinting|screen]], textile and digital printing community.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.earthisland.co.uk/#!Fespa-2015-attendance-up-17/cuhk/556c23f80cf298b2d3f64c93&lt;/ref&gt;

The organisation provides a forum for information exchange between member associations resulting in help from the larger to the smaller Associations in recruitment, training and technical studies.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.printwearandpromotion.co.uk/index.php/fespa-launches-free-technology-guides-for-association-members/&lt;/ref&gt;

It also runs a number of events and community outreach programmes, including industry research&lt;ref&gt;http://whattheythink.com/news/73311-fespa-launches-free-technology-guides-association-members/&lt;/ref&gt; and educational programmes for students,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adcomms.co.uk/media-centre/fespa-eurasia-2015/fespa-progresses-regional-re-investment-programme-with-support-for-next-generation-turkish-printers&lt;/ref&gt; vehicle wrapping competitions,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.wrap-masters.com&lt;/ref&gt; Awards,&lt;ref&gt;http://www.printweek.com/print-week/news/1151658/uks-fespa-award-winners-hail-benefits-of-triumph&lt;/ref&gt; networking events &lt;ref&gt;http://www.innovationintextiles.com/fespa-global-summit-2014/&lt;/ref&gt; and design conferences.

==Heritage==
FESPA was formed as a 'non-profit' organisation in 1962 by a group of screen printing associations whose aim was to create a platform to share knowledge on [[screen printing]] technology in Europe.

The original membership consisted of 8 representatives, including [[Michel Caza]] - fine art printer to artists including [[Andy Warhol]] and [[Salvador Dalí]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.sgia.org/person/caza-michel&lt;/ref&gt; As the organisation grew, more associations joined.  Current membership stands at around 40 national associations.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fespa.com/fespa-associations.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The current president is Turkey's Yaşar Güvenen, who was elected in 2014 and took office in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.printweek.com/print-week/news/1151538/g-venen-named-as-new-fespa-president-at-awards-gala&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
FESPA produces market research on the trends, challenges, opportunities and threats confronting the community in partnership with InfoTrends – a research organisation for the print trade.

The reports provide analysis of the state of the marketplace and are funded through the organisation's 'Profit for Purpose' initiative.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=fsb.org.uk |url=http://www.adcomms.co.uk/cpressr2.aspx?prid=8400 |title=Results From First-Ever FESPA World Wide Survey Now Available |accessdate=2007-05-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090526060745/http://www.adcomms.co.uk/cpressr2.aspx?prid=8400 |archivedate=2009-05-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Goguryeo–Tang War'''&lt;ref name=shin-maps&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Shin |editor1-first=Michael D. |title=Korean History in Maps: From Prehistory to the Twenty-first Century |date=2014 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-1-107-09846-6 |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; occurred from 645 to 668 and was initially fought between the [[Goguryeo|Goguryeo kingdom]] and [[Tang Dynasty]]. During the course of the war the two sides allied with various other states. Goguryeo successfully repulsed the invading Tang armies during the [[First conflict of the Goguryeo–Tang War|first Tang invasions of 645-648]]. After [[Baekje–Tang War|conquering Baekje]] in 660, Tang and Silla armies invaded Goguryeo from the north and south in 661, but were forced to withdraw in 662. In 666, Yeon Gaesomun died and Goguryeo became plagued by violent dissension, numerous defections, and widespread demoralization.&lt;ref name="Graff200" /&gt; The Tang–Silla alliance mounted a fresh invasion in the following year, aided by the defector Yeon Namsaeng.&lt;ref name="baek" /&gt; In late 668, exhausted from numerous attacks and suffering from internal political chaos, the kingdom of Goguryeo and the remnants of Baekje army succumbed to the numerically superior armies of the Tang Dynasty and Silla.

The war marked the end of the [[Three Kingdoms of Korea]] period which had lasted since 57 BCE. It also triggered the [[Silla–Tang War]] during which Silla and the Tang Dynasty fought over the spoils they had gained.

==Onset==
In 627, Li Shimin ([[Emperor Taizong of Tang|Emperor Taizong]]) succeeded the Tang throne after the [[Xuanwu Gate Incident]], killing his two brothers—[[Li Jiancheng]] and [[Li Yuanji]]—and forcing his father, Li Yuan ([[Emperor Gaozu of Tang|Emperor Gaozu]]), to abdicate. Soon thereafter, he set his mind to conquering [[Goguryeo]]. The [[Silla|Silla kingdom]] had made numerous requests to the Tang court for military assistance against Goguryeo, which the Tang court began to consider not long after they had decisively defeated the [[Göktürks]] in 628.&lt;ref name=seth10-44/&gt; At the same time, however, Silla was also engaged in open hostilities with [[Baekje]] in 642.&lt;ref name=seth10-44/&gt; A year before (641), [[Uija of Baekje|King Uija]] had assumed the throne of Baekje.&lt;ref name=farris85-8/&gt; In 642, King Uija attacked Silla and captured around 40 strongpoints.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Whiting|first1=Marvin C.|title=Imperial Chinese Military History: 8000 BC-1912 AD|publisher=iUniverse|isbn=9780595221349|page=257|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JJQiAz3qTCgC&amp;pg=PA257#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=2 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, in 642, the military dictator [[Yeon Gaesomun]] murdered over 180 Goguryeo aristocrats and seized the Goguryeo throne.&lt;ref name=farris85-8/&gt; He placed a puppet king onto the throne after killing the king in 642.&lt;ref name=gr02-196/&gt; These newly formed governments in Baekje and Goguryeo were preparing for war and had established an mutual alliance against Tang and Silla.&lt;ref name=farris85-8&gt;{{harvnb|Farris|1985|loc=8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Course of the war==
===Conflict in 645===
{{main|First conflict of the Goguryeo–Tang War}}
[[Image:History of Korea-645.png|300px|thumb|First conflict of the Goguryeo-Tang War]]

Emperor Taizong used Yeon Gaesomun's murder of the Goguryeo king as the pretext for his campaign and started preparations for an invasion force in 644.&lt;ref name=gr02-196/&gt; General Li Shiji commanded an army of 60,000 Tang soldiers and an undisclosed number of tribal forces.&lt;ref name=gr02-196/&gt; They would gather at Youzhou.&lt;ref name=gr02-196/&gt; Emperor Taizong commanded an armored cavalry of 10,000 strong.&lt;ref name=gr02-196/&gt; His cavalry would eventually meet up and join General Li Shiji's army during the expedition.&lt;ref name=gr02-196/&gt; A fleet of 500 ships would also transport an additional 40,000 conscripted soldiers and 3,000 military gentlemen (volunteers from the elite of [[Chang'an]] and [[Luoyang]]).&lt;ref name=gr02-196&gt;{{harvnb|Graff|2002|loc=196}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This fleet would sail from the Liaodong Peninsula to the Korean Peninsula.&lt;ref name=gr02-196/&gt;

In April 645, General Li Shiji's army departed from Yincheng (present-day Chaoyang).&lt;ref name=gr02-197&gt;{{harvnb|Graff|2002|loc=197}}.&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 May, they crossed the Liao River into Goguryeo territory.&lt;ref name=gr02-197/&gt;  On 16 May, they laid siege to Gaimou (Kaemo), which fell after only 11 days, capturing 20,000 people and confiscating 100,000 ''shi'' (6 million liter) of grain.&lt;ref name=gr02-197/&gt;

The Tang army marched further to Baiyan (Paekam) and arrived there on 27 June 645.&lt;ref name=gr02-197/&gt; However, the Goguryeo commanders surrendered the city to the Tang army.&lt;ref name=gr02-197/&gt; Afterwards, Emperor Taizong ordered that the city must not be looted and its citizens must not be enslaved.&lt;ref name=gr02-197/&gt;

===Conflicts in 654-668 and fall of Goguryeo===
{{see also|Baekje–Tang War}}

After Emperor Taizong's death in 649, the conquest of Goguryeo and the personal rivalry with Yeon Gaesomun became an obsession with [[Emperor Gaozong of Tang|Emperor Gaozong]]. Under Emperor Gaozong's reign, the Tang empire formed a military alliance with the [[Silla|Silla kingdom]].&lt;ref name=lee97-17/&gt; When Goguryeo and [[Baekje]] attacked Silla from the north and west respectively, [[Queen Seondeok of Silla]] sent an emissary to the Tang empire to desperately request military assistance.&lt;ref name=lee97-17/&gt; In 650, Emperor Gaozong received a poem, written by [[Queen Jindeok of Silla]], from the princely emissary [[Muyeol of Silla|Kim Chunchu]] (who would later accede the Silla throne as King Muyeol).&lt;ref name=seth10-44&gt;{{harvnb|Seth|2010|loc=44}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In 653, Baekje allied with Yamato Wa.&lt;ref name=kim05-37&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|2005|loc=37}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Even though Baekje was allied with Goguryeo, the [[Han River (Korea)|Han River]] valley separated the two states and was a hindrance in coming to each other's aid in time of war.&lt;ref name=kim05-37/&gt; [[Muyeol of Silla|King Muyeol]] assumed the Silla throne in 654.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|2005|loc=37–38}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Between 655 and 659, the border of Silla was harassed by Baekje and Goguryeo; Silla therefore requested assistance from Tang.&lt;ref name=kim05-38&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|2005|loc=38}}.&lt;/ref&gt;  In 658, Emperor Gaozong sent an army to attack Goguryeo&lt;ref name=ebrey06-106/&gt; but was unable to overcome Goguryeo's stalwart defenses.&lt;ref name="Ring"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ring|first1=Trudy|last2=Watson|first2=Noelle|last3=Schellinger|first3=Paul|title=Asia and Oceania: International Dictionary of Historic Places|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781136639791|page=486|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=voerPYsAB5wC&amp;q=stalwart+defenses#v=snippet&amp;q=stalwart%20defenses&amp;f=false|accessdate=16 July 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Muyeol of Silla|Kim Chunchu]] suggested to Tang that the Tang–Silla alliance first conquer Baekje, breaking up the Goguryeo–Baekje alliance, and then attack Goguryeo.&lt;ref name="Ring" /&gt;

After the conquest of Baekje in 660, the Tang and Silla forces planned to invade Goguryeo.&lt;ref name=yu12-31/&gt; In 661, the Tang forces set off to Goguryeo.&lt;ref name=lee97-18/&gt; As the Tang army advanced with 350,000 troops,&lt;ref name=kim05-40&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|2005|loc=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Silla was requested to provide only supplies during this expedition.&lt;ref name=kim05-40/&gt; In 662, Yeon Gaesomun defeated General Pang Xiaotai at the Battle of Sasu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=옆으로 읽는 동아시아 삼국지 1|publisher=EASTASIA|isbn=9788962620726|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GfevAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT348#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 November 2016|language=ko}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=통일기|url=http://www.culturecontent.com/content/contentView.do?search_div_id=CP_THE003&amp;cp_code=cp0901&amp;index_id=cp09010004&amp;content_id=cp090100040001&amp;search_left_menu=1|website=한국콘텐츠진흥원|publisher=Korea Creative Content Agency|accessdate=4 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Tang army besieged Pyongyang, Goguryeo's capital, for several months until February 662, when it had to withdraw from the campaign due to the harsh winter conditions,&lt;ref name=lee97-18/&gt; and the defeat of its subsidiary force.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=David|title=Medieval Chinese Warfare 300-900|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134553532|page=199|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpmBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA199#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 666, the Goguryeo dictator [[Yeon Gaesomun]] died and an internal struggle between his sons for power broke out.&lt;ref name=kim05-40/&gt; Goguryeo was thrown into chaos and weakened by the succession struggle among his sons and younger brother, with his eldest son (and successor) defecting to [[Tang dynasty|Tang]] and his younger brother defecting to Silla.&lt;ref name="baek"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Yi|first1=Ki-baek|title=A New History of Korea|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=9780674615762|page=67|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=g2mdVwXpMzwC&amp;pg=PA67#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Djun Kil|title=The History of Korea, 2nd Edition|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9781610695824|page=49|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=IgxvBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA49#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yeon Gaesomun's death paved the way for a fresh invasion by Tang and Silla in 667, this time aided by Yeon Gaesomun's oldest son.&lt;ref name="baek" /&gt; The violent dissension resulting from Yeon Gaesomun's death proved to be the primary reason for the Tang–Silla triumph, thanks to the division, defections, and widespread demoralization it caused.&lt;ref name="Graff200"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Graff|first1=David|title=Medieval Chinese Warfare 300-900|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781134553532|page=200|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gpmBAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA200#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 November 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The alliance with Silla also proved to be invaluable, thanks to the ability to attack Goguryeo from opposite directions, and both military and logistical aid from Silla.&lt;ref name="Graff200" /&gt; In 668, the Tang and Silla forces besieged and conquered Pyongyang, which led to the conquest of Goguryeo.&lt;ref name=seth10-44/&gt;&lt;ref name=yu12-31&gt;{{harvnb|Yu|2012|loc=31}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=kim05-40/&gt; Over 200,000 prisoners were taken by the Tang forces and sent to [[Chang'an]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lewis|2009|loc=154}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 669, the Tang government established the [[Protectorate General to Pacify the East]] to control the former territories of Goguryeo.&lt;ref name=kim05-40/&gt; A subordinate office was in Baekje.&lt;ref name=kim05-40/&gt; By the end of the war, the Tang empire had taken control over the former territories of Baekje and Goguryeo and tried to assert dominion over Silla.&lt;ref name=fuqua07-40&gt;{{harvnb|Fuqua|2007|loc=40}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Large parts of the [[Korean Peninsula]] were occupied by the Tang forces for about a decade.&lt;ref name=lee97-18&gt;{{harvnb|Lee|1997|loc=18}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the Tang occupation of the Korean Peninsula proved to be logistically difficult due to shortage of supplies, which Silla used to provide previously.&lt;ref name=seth10-45&gt;{{harvnb|Seth|2010|loc=45}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, Emperor Gaozong was ailing, so [[Wu Zetian|Empress Wu]] took a pacifist policy, and the Tang empire was diverting resources towards other priorities.&lt;ref name=kim05-41/&gt; This situation favored Silla, because soon Silla would have to forcibly [[Silla–Tang War|resist the imposition of Chinese rule]] over the entire peninsula.&lt;ref name=kim05-41/&gt; War was imminent between Silla and Tang.&lt;ref name=fuqua07-40/&gt;&lt;ref name=kim05-41&gt;{{harvnb|Kim|2005|loc=41}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the fall of Goguryeo, [[Go of Balhae|Dae Jo Young]] gathered Goguryeo people and [[Mohe people|Malgal]] people and fought against Tang Dynasty to restore Goguryeo. Dae Jo-Young successfully established [[Balhae]] after declaring victory at the [[Battle of Tianmenling|Battle of Cheonmunryeong]].

"'''Headline News'''" is a parody song by [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]. It is a parody of the [[Crash Test Dummies]]'s [[1993 in music|1993]] hit "[[Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm]]". It was released as the lead-off single for the compilation box set ''[[Permanent Record: Al in the Box]]'' on September 27, 1994. The song was written after Yankovic's label insisted he craft a new song to promote the album; Yankovic in turn combined the music of the Crash Test Dummies' song with three news stories that were popular in late 1993 and early 1994.

To help promote the song and album, Yankovic directed a music video that was a direct parody of the Crash Test Dummies' original. In it, the three news stories are presented as if they are [[one-act play]]s to an audience. The video took two days to film and ended up running over the allotted time that had been scheduled for filming. The resulting video was also extremely expensive to fund. Several notable individuals made cameos in the video, such as [[Doug Llewelyn]], [[Dr. Demento]] and [[Judy Tenuta]].

The song and video were met with mostly positive reviews from critics, although at least one critic noted that the source material would soon become dated. The Crash Test Dummies themselves were very pleased with the final result and even performed the song with Yankovic in concert twice. "Headline News" charted at number four on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] chart, making it Yankovic's first single to chart domestically since 1992's "[[Smells Like Nirvana]]".

==Writing==
While Yankovic was writing the original songs for a new album—which was later released in 1996 as ''[[Bad Hair Day]]''—his label, [[Scotti Brothers Records]], insisted that he release a new record in order to meet monetary projections for the fourth fiscal quarter of the year. Yankovic, however, explained that he would be unable to finish a new record in time, so his label decided to release a box set entitled ''[[Permanent Record: Al in the Box]]''. The label then stipulated that Yankovic would need to at least record a new single to promote the box set.&lt;ref name="writing"&gt;{{cite interview | last           = Yankovic | first          = Alfred M. | interviewer    = Jeff Elbel | title        = Visions of Gray |date=February 1995 | accessdate     = June 23, 2010 | url     = http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/interviews/vog.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yankovic had previously heard "[[Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm]]" during 1994 and felt that it was "one of two or three songs" that could be potentially parodied.&lt;ref name="writing"/&gt; He noted that it "would be really good to do for the next album", but felt that "when the time is right, [he would] think of something" to write the parody about; he then returned his attention to writing original songs.&lt;ref name="writing"/&gt; After Scotti Brothers insisted on the writing of a new lead single, Yankovic very nearly had his label cancel the box set due to being unable to write under pressure. However, he soon returned to the idea of parodying "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm". He decided to pair the song's music up with "all the weird news stories that were going on" and make each verse its own [[vignette (literature)|vignette]].&lt;ref name="writing"/&gt; Yankovic also felt that by doing this and releasing it on the box set, he would be able to capitalize on the topicality of the issues.&lt;ref name="writing"/&gt;

While the original song's verses each told the story of three abnormal children, each verse of "Headline News" tells the story of three famous tabloid stories of 1993 and 1994: the American delinquent [[Michael P. Fay|Michael Fay]] being [[caning|caned]] in [[Singapore]], figure skater [[Tonya Harding]]'s ex-husband attacking her rival [[Nancy Kerrigan]], and [[John and Lorena Bobbitt|Lorena Bobbitt severing her husband's penis with a knife.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McDonald|first=Patrick|title=Magical Music|url=http://docs.newsbank.com.www2.lib.ku.edu:2048/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:STIW&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB13DCACD0E1395&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0F8479522BD09CA1|accessdate=May 1, 2013|newspaper=[[The Seattle Times]]|publisher=[[The Seattle Times Company]]|date=December 1, 1994}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; (In this last verse, Yankovic substitutes the term "penis" with [[euphemism]]s like "wiener" and "Mr. Happy".)&lt;ref name=weirdalsheetmusic&gt;{{cite book|title=The 'Weird Al' Yankovic Anthology: Piano – Vocal – Guitar|publisher=Cherry Lane Music|isbn=9781575600215|date=July 1, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic later joked that he "wanted to write a song about these people because [he didn't] think they're getting quite enough media attention", a reference to the stories' over-saturation in the news.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite interview | last           = Yankovic | first          = Alfred M. | interviewer    = Chad Mitchell | title        = WONC 89.1 FM | date = November 14, 1994 | accessdate     = May 1, 2013 | url     = http://www.al-oholicsanonymous.com/interviews/wonc.txt }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recording for the song itself started on July 27, 1994, at Santa Monica Sound Recorders in Santa Monica, California.&lt;ref name="recordingdates"&gt;{{Cite web| url         = http://weirdal.com/archives/miscellaneous/recording-dates/ | title       = Recording Dates | accessdate  = June 26, 2010 | last        = Yankovic | first       = Alfred M. | authorlink  = "Weird Al" Yankovic |date=December 2007 | work        = The Official "Weird Al" Yankovic Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=card&gt;{{Citation|last=Yankovic|first=Alfred |publisher = [[Volcano Records]] | title    = Headline News | work = 'Weird Al' Yankovic Official Limited Edition Trading Cards| number   = 53|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Backing Yankovic were [[Jon Schwartz (drummer)|Jon "Bermuda" Schwartz]] on drums, [[Steve Jay]] on bass, [[Jim West (guitarist)|Jim West]] on guitar, and Kim Bullard on keyboards. Lisa Popeil provides the female backup vocals, as well as the scream of [[Nancy Kerrigan]].&lt;ref name="weirdal.com-players"/&gt; The song also features various idiosyncratic elements to increase the humor, such as [[Manualism (hand music)|manualist]] sound effects courtesy of Mike Kieffer.&lt;ref name="weirdal.com-players"/&gt; Additionally, the ending features a chorus of [[kazoo]]s, and Yankovic plays a short riff of the song on his trademark instrument, the [[accordion]].&lt;ref name="weirdal.com-players"/&gt;&lt;ref name=faq/&gt; Yankovic himself produced the session.&lt;ref name=hnsingle&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title = Headline News|others = [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]|year = 1994|url = http://www.com-www.com/weirdal/pix/pix-headlinenews.html|type = liner|publisher = [[Scotti Brothers Records]]|location = [[California]], [[United States]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=praitb&gt;{{cite AV media notes|title = Permanent Record: Al in the Box|others = [["Weird Al" Yankovic]]|year = 1994|url = http://dmdb.org/al/booklet.html|first = Barret|last = Hansen|authorlink = Dr. Demento|type = liner|publisher = [[Scotti Brothers Records]]|location = [[California]], [[United States]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the vocal part of the original being in such a low register, Yankovic had to record the parody's vocal tracks early in the morning, when his voice was naturally lower.&lt;ref name=card/&gt;

==Music video==
The [[music video]] for "Headline News" parodies the "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" video in that it presents each news story as a one-act play on stage before an audience of people. The video was directed by Yankovic, making it his third directoral credit after 1986's "[[Christmas at Ground Zero]]" and 1993's "[[Bedrock Anthem]]".&lt;ref name="The Videos"&gt;{{cite AV media notes | others="Weird Al" Yankovic | year=1998 | title="Weird Al" Yankovic: The Videos | type=liner notes | publisher=Image Entertainment | id=ID4105AADVD}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic appears as Brad Roberts, and his band appears as the other members of the Crash Test Dummies; notably, the video also marks the on-screen debut of Yankovic's official keyboardist, [[Rubén Valtierra]], who appears in drag as [[Ellen Reid]].&lt;ref name=card2/&gt; The video was filmed on August 29 and 31, 1994. All of the scenes that took place at the school were filmed during the day at Longfellow Elementary School Auditorium, in [[Pasadena, California]]. The scenes at the ice rink were filmed at night in a rink in [[Paramount, California]].&lt;ref name="writing"/&gt;&lt;ref name=card2&gt;{{Citation|last=Yankovic|first=Alfred |publisher = [[Volcano Records]] | title    = Video: Headline News | work = 'Weird Al' Yankovic Official Limited Edition Trading Cards| number   = 54|year=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Yankovic, the crew ran over time and it was a rather expensive video. Yankovic noted that "without giving you the actual number", he could have "recorded two albums, probably, for what it cost to do that one video."&lt;ref name="writing"/&gt; The video features several celebrity cameos, including an appearance by [[Doug Llewelyn]] of [[The People's Court|People's Court]] fame, and long time radio show host [[Dr. Demento]]. Comedian [[Judy Tenuta]] also appears as [[Lorena Bobbitt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yankovic|first=Alfred M.|title=Video Facts|url=http://weirdal.com/archives/miscellaneous/video-facts/|work=The Official "Weird Al" Yankovic Web Site|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Release==

===Reception===
[[File:BradRobertsOct2010.jpg|thumb|[[Brad Roberts]], writer of the song "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm", enjoyed the parody and has performed it in concert with Yankovic.|250px]]
"Headline News" was released on September 26, 1994, as the lead-off single for ''Permanent Record: Al in the Box'', which was also released a day later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headline News / Xmas at Ground Zero: Weird Al Yankovic|url=https://www.amazon.com/Headline-News-Xmas-Ground-Zero/dp/B000008O0D/ref=sr_1_1?s=music&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1367458536&amp;sr=1-1&amp;keywords=headline+news|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Weber|first=Barry|title=Permanent Record – Weird Al Yankovic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/permanent-record-mw0000121336|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic also insisted that the song be commercially available as a [[CD single]] so that his fans who are completists would not have to purchase the expensive box set just to get the new song.&lt;ref name="writing"/&gt; Much like the cover for the [[Crash Test Dummies]]'s 1993 studio album ''[[God Shuffled His Feet]]'', the cover for Yankovic's single superimposes his face over the figures of [[Titian]]'s painting ''[[Bacchus and Ariadne]]''. The art direction is credited to Doug Haverty, and design is credit to Daniel Sorenson, David McDougall.&lt;ref name=hnsingle/&gt; The b-side of "Headline News" was a remix of Yankovic's 1986 original song "Christmas at Ground Zero".&lt;ref name=hnsingle/&gt; The song was never officially released on a studio album, although it did appear on Yankovic's ''[[Greatest Hits Volume II ("Weird Al" Yankovic album)|Greatest Hits Volume II]]'' album, which was released a month later on October 25, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weird Al Yankovic – Greatest Hits, Volume 2|url=https://www.amazon.com/Weird-Al-Yankovic-Greatest-Volume/dp/B00000I02E|publisher=[[Amazon.com]]|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The single charted and peaked at number four on the ''[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]]'' [[Bubbling Under Hot 100 Singles]] chart, which corresponds to a position of 104 on the [[Billboard Hot 100|''Billboard'' Hot 100]].&lt;ref name=billboard/&gt; This made it Yankovic's first domestically charting single since 1992's "[[Smells Like Nirvana]]".&lt;ref name=hot100&gt;{{cite web|title=Weird Al Yankovic Album &amp; Song Chart History|url={{BillboardURLbyName|artist=weird al yankovic|chart=all}}|publisher=[[Billboard (magazine)|Billboard]].com|accessdate=October 11, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brad Roberts, the original songwriter for "Mmm Mmm Mmm Mmm" was extremely pleased with the parody, and found it humorous. He later noted that, "People assume that I was annoyed but when [Yankovic] does a parody of you, you know you've made it."&lt;ref name=dailytimes/&gt; He later praised the way Yankovic interacted with the artists that he parodies, noting that "Weird Al goes the whole route and cultivates a relationship with the artist. Plus he gets half the earnings and that helps me make money."&lt;ref name=dailytimes&gt;{{cite news|last=Jahrling|first=Steve|title=Off Hours: Crash Test Dummies to impact Durango Mountain Resort|newspaper=The Daily Times|publisher=[[MediaNews Group]]|date=July 9, 2004}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reviews===
"Headline News" received mostly positive reviews from [[Music journalism|music critics]]. Lou Carlozo of the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]'' wrote that the song "provided savage laughs at the expense of Tonya Harding and John Bobbitt."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Carlozo|first=Lou|title=Yankovic Still Weird, Still A Master Of Parody|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1997-08-02/news/9708020024_1_amish-paradise-weird-al-yankovic-mmm|work=[[Chicago Tribune]]|publisher=[[Tribune Company]]|accessdate=May 2, 2013|date=August 2, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; Roch Parisien of [[Allmusic]] cited the song as one of the three stand-outs from Yankovic's second greatest hits volume, and called it a "rib-tickler".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Parisien|first=Roch|title=Greatest Hits, Vol. 2 – Weird Al Yankovic|url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/greatest-hits-vol-2-mw0000120574|publisher=[[Allmusic]]|accessdate=May 2, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tina Maps of ''[[The Milwaukee Journal]]'' wrote a positive review and felt that the musical parody was a "dead-on skewering of the Crash Test Dummies' 'Mmm, Mmm, Mmm, Mmm".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maples|first=Tina|title=Record Sets Capture Artists in Flower of Their Careers For Some, It is Recognition Long Overdue|url=http://docs.newsbank.com.www2.lib.ku.edu:2048/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:MWSB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB13DCACD0E1395&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0F8479522BD09CA1|newspaper=[[Milwaukee Journal Sentinel|The Milwaukee Journal]]|publisher=[[Journal Communications]]|accessdate=May 2, 2013|date=November 13, 1994}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all reviews, however, were so positive; an article that appeared in ''[[The Commercial Appeal]]'' noted that while the video for "Headline News" had some "cute bits and unusual cameos", it was "not as clever as many of Yankovic's past efforts" and that "the current events included here are already dated".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Video Vibe|url=http://docs.newsbank.com.www2.lib.ku.edu:2048/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:CMAB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EAF94CB381122A3&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0F8479522BD09CA1|work=[[The Commercial Appeal]]|publisher=[[E.

===Live performances===
Yankovic first started performing "Headline News" in August 1994, almost a month before it was officially released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Matthews|first=Lynn|title=Outrageous 'Weird Al' Tickles Fairgoers Fancy|url=http://docs.newsbank.com.www2.lib.ku.edu:2048/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:NewsBank:VCBB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0EB13DCACD0E1395&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0F8479522BD09CA1|newspaper=[[The Columbian]]|publisher=Columbian Publishing Company|accessdate=May 1, 2013|date=August 9, 1994}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, Yankovic has performed the song with the Crash Test Dummies twice: once on Canada's [[MuchMusic]] channel and another time at the House of Blues in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Yankovic|first=Alfred M.|title='Ask Al' Q&amp;As for November, 1998|url=http://weirdal.com/archives/miscellaneous/ask-al/#1198|work=The Official "Weird Al" Yankovic Web Site|accessdate=April 28, 2013|date=November 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reportedly, during one of the performances, [[Ellen Reid]], backing vocalist and keyboardist for the Crash Test Dummies, went out and purchased kazoos. The band then hid the instruments until the end of the song, when they took them out and played them; this "came as a big surprise to" Yankovic.&lt;ref name=faq&gt;{{cite web|title=Crash Test Dummies FAQ|url=http://www.crashtestdummies.com/faq/#weirdal|publisher=CrashTestDummies.com|accessdate=May 1, 2013|date=July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yankovic's ''[[Straight Outta Lynwood]]'' concert tour contained new lyrics as part of a parody medley, referencing [[Britney Spears]], dealing with her 2007 head-shaving shock and underpants-less [[limousine]] trip in late 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Headline News (Britney Version) – "Weird Al" Yankovic|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2w82JBuFFiY|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=May 1, 2013|date=September 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later in the tour, he changed it to reference [[Paris Hilton]]'s DUI and imprisonment, and her subsequent interview on ''[[Larry King Live]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Weird Al Yankovic – Paris Hilton Parody|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I063gDO3Aoc|publisher=[[YouTube]]|accessdate=May 1, 2013|date=July 8, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=live&gt;{{Cite web| url         = http://weirdal.com/archives/miscellaneous/set-lists/ | title       = Set Lists | accessdate  = December 21, 2016 | last        = Yankovic | first       = Alfred M. | authorlink  = "Weird Al" Yankovic |date=December 2007 | work        = The Official "Weird Al" Yankovic Web Site}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first [[hoax]] reported in [[Singapore]] was in 1805, when the [[Bukit Timah Monkey Man]] was reported for the first time. Depending on the subject and type of the hoax, it's been reported to [[Singapore Police Force]], there maybe an investigation by the [[Criminal Investigation Department]] and subsequently a possible a stern warning or prosecution by the [[Attorney general#Singapore|ACG]] .

The '''Horseshoe 2 Fire''' was a 2011 [[wildfire]] located along the southeastern flank of the [[Chiricahua Mountains]] in southeastern [[Arizona]]. It began in Horseshoe Canyon on the Douglas Ranger District of the [[Coronado National Forest]] on May 8, 2011, at approximately 11:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref name="Earth Observatory" /&gt; The fire was started by human activities,&lt;ref name="Earth Observatory" /&gt;&lt;ref name=herald514 /&gt; and burned over {{convert|9000|acres|sqmi ha}} in its first day.&lt;ref name="IW-6-17"/&gt; By June 1, 2011, the fire had burned an area of over {{convert|80500|acres|sqmi ha}} of grasses, shrubs, and trees along the mountain slopes.&lt;ref name="AZEIN-6-1" /&gt; By June 8, it had grown to {{convert|106661|acres|sqmi ha}}.&lt;ref name=Inciweb /&gt; By June 17, the fire was 65% contained&lt;ref name="IW-6-17"/&gt; and had become the fifth-largest wildfire in Arizona history.&lt;ref name=payson/&gt;  100% containment was achieved on June 25 after a total area of {{convert|222954|acres|sqmi ha}} had burned.&lt;ref name="IW-6-26"/&gt;

==Post-fire conditions==
Regions of the Chiricahua Mountains close to the small commonwealth of Portal are experiencing a slow ecological recovery after the Horseshoe 2 fire burned more than 200,000 acres in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.azpm.org/p/home-featured/2013/5/8/24253-horseshoe-2-fire-two-years-later/&lt;/ref&gt; Both the biggest draws to area are intact, but a lot has changed after past year 's Horseshoe 2 Fire swept across those rugged mountains .&lt;ref&gt;http://archive.azcentral.com/travel/articles/20120921tempered-beauty-chiricahua-national-monument.html&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, because of a mix of flood harm after the Horseshoe 2 fire of 2011 and infrequent maintenance, trail conditions have changed quickly and particularly during monsoon season it is necessary to be careful.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chiricahuatrails.com/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Hysteria: A Festival of Women''' was a recurring [[arts festival]] in [[Toronto]]. It was founded in 2003 by Moynan King of the [[Buddies in Bad Times]] theatre company.

Over a ten-day period, Buddies hosted a succession of events particularly for and with the [[queer]] women's performance community, including art, installations to dance, film, music, spoken word and [[theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nowtoronto.com/stage/story.cfm?content=171908&lt;/ref&gt;

Hysteria debuted such Buddies in Times' productions as ''Kinstonia: Dialect Perverso'' by Ann Holloway, ''The Scandelles’s Under the Mink'' (2007), ''organ-eye-zed crime'' (2006) by d’bi young, ''The Salon Automaton: A play for three automatons and one flesh and blood actress'' (2009) by Nathalie Claude, and ''The Beauty Salon'' (2008). [[Ivan Coyote]]’s ''You Are Here'' was originally scheduled for a cabaret run in 2009, but was cancelled in January of that year.&lt;ref name="KingMoynan"&gt;King, Moynan, The Foster Children of Buddies: Queer Women at 12 Alexander, Theatre and Performance in Toronto&lt;/ref&gt;

==Namesake==
The festival name alludes ironically to [[female hysteria]], an archaic medical diagnosis applied to women the 19th and early 20th centuries. The festival's name is about embracing women's disobedience&lt;ref name="KingMoynan" /&gt; and reclaiming the term ''hysteria''.

==Hysteria after 2009==
2009 was a year marked by an increase in the production of women's theatre works at Buddies in Bad Times, in large part due to the publication of an Arts report by Canada Arts Council, entitled, "Adding it Up: The Status of Women in Canadian Theatre," which showed the vast majority of plays appearing on Canadian stage coming from male playwright's.&lt;ref name="KingMoynan" /&gt;  following this season, however, a shift occurred in the programming, beginning with the decision not to renew King's contract as artistic associate. This decision was made with the caveat that King's festival, Hysteria, would continue to run, even without her presence. While that commitment was made, the festival has ceased since she left. Since then, Strange Sisters has been revived, a one-night festival of queer women's work. In 2015, it was renamed Insatiable Sisters by co-curators [http://kimkatrincrosby.squarespace.com/queer-gifted-black/ Kim Katrin Crosby] and [http://www.geinwong.com/Gein_Wong_Bio.html Gein Wong]. [http://buddiesinbadtimes.com/2014-15/insatiable-sisters/ Insatiable Sisters] highlights new performance works of queer womyn and trans* folks.

==Naval career==
===World War II===
Cupp enlisted in the Navy on 15 May 1941 and entered the V-5 flight training program. He graduated at [[Naval Air Station Corpus Christi]], [[Texas]] 9 January 1942&lt;ref name="Guttman, 2005" /&gt; and was commissioned a [[second lieutenant]] in the United States Marine Corps, 27 February 1942.&lt;ref name="Hammell, 2010" /&gt; On 3 March 1942, he married Daphne Snider, of [[Fairfield, Iowa]]. Cupp then attended [[aerial photography]] training at [[Naval Air Station Pensacola]], [[Florida]].&lt;ref name="Guttman, 2005" /&gt;

Cupp was attached to [[VMF-213]], the Hell Hawks, in September 1942 at [[Marine Corps Air Station Ewa]] and later flew the [[Vought F4U Corsair]]. He had his crew paint Daphne "C", for his wife, on the engine cowling of his Corsair. He arrived at the [[Solomon Islands]] for his first combat tour on 3 April 1943.&lt;ref name="Craig, 1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Guttman, 2005" /&gt; Cupp scored his first aerial victory on 15 July 1943 and was an ace three days later. During his tour he was credited with 13 1/2&lt;ref name="Craig, 1989" /&gt; or 13&lt;ref name="Hammell, 2010" /&gt; aerial victories based on reports by his [[wingman|wingmen]]. According to Guttman (2005), he was officially credited with 12 victories.&lt;ref name="Guttman, 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1338&amp;dat=19431130&amp;id=1NhXAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=avUDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7216,5737978 |title= Hell Hawk No. 2 is Spokane man |newspaper= Daily Chronicle |location= Spokane, WA |date= 30 November 1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 September 1943, Captain Cupp was shot down north of [[Kolombangara]] by a [[Mitsubishi G4M|G4M1 Betty]] with an improvised gun unexpectedly mounted in its bomb bay; he was severely burned.&lt;ref name="Guttman, 2005" /&gt; He spent the next 18 months in hospitals, primarily [[Naval Hospital Oakland|Oak Knoll Naval Hospital]] in [[Oakland, California]]. After that, he served as a Naval [[flight instructor]]. The war ended before he could return to the Pacific theater.&lt;ref name="Hammell, 2010" /&gt;

===Later career===
Cupp served in the [[Korean War]]&lt;ref name="Craig, 1989" /&gt; and received his fourth [[Distinguished Flying Cross (United States)|Distinguished Flying Cross]] for service during the [[Battle of Chosin Reservoir]] where he was an air officer on the ground, responsible for directing [[close air support]] operations.&lt;ref name="Guttman, 2005" /&gt;

After World War II, he served as [[commanding officer]] for [[VMO-6]] in [[Tsingtao, China]], HQ Squadron, [[1st Marine Aircraft Wing]] in [[Tientsin, China]], Marine Detachment (MARDET) [[Naval Air Station Joint Reserve Base New Orleans|Naval Air Station New Orleans]], MARDET [[Naval Air Station Glenview]], VMFT-10 at [[Marine Corps Air Station El Toro]] and [[Marine Air Control Squadron 1]] in Taiwan.&lt;ref name="Craig, 1989" /&gt;

Colonel Cupp retired to [[Manassas, Virginia]] in 1968,&lt;ref name="Craig, 1989" /&gt; [[real estate broker|selling real estate]] until 1973.&lt;ref name="Guttman, 2005" /&gt; He died on 2 June 2004 and was buried at Stonewall Memory Gardens, [[Manassas, Virginia]].&lt;ref name="Guttman, 2005" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://billiongraves.com/pages/record/JamesNCupp/7088873 |title=James Norman Cupp tombstone |website= billiongraves.com |accessdate= 2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While leading his three-fighter division on a patrol over our base on [[Vella Lavella]], Captain Cupp boldly intercepted an overwhelming force of fifteen hostile dive bombers and their fighter escorts threatening our installations. Promptly engaging the enemy, he personally blasted four bombers from the sky and assisted in the shooting down of another. By his superb skill, daring initiative and devotion to duty, Captain Cupp contributed to the success of his squadron and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.&lt;ref name="Valor"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://projects.militarytimes.com/citations-medals-awards/recipient.php?recipientid=8277 |title=James Norman Cupp |website= Military Times Hall of Honor |accessdate= 2014-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;|Commander South Pacific, 19 March 1947}}

'''Lao New Year''', called '''Pi Mai''' ({{lang-lo|[[wikt:ປີໃໝ່|ປີໃໝ່]]}}, {{IPA-lo|pìːmāi|}}) or less commonly '''Songkran''' ({{lang-lo|ສົງກຣານ}}, {{IPA-lo|sǒŋkràːn|}}), is celebrated every year from April 13/14 to April 15/16.

== History ==
Lao New Year is a popular English name for a traditional celebration known in [[Laos]] as "Pi Mai" or "Songkran" (in Lao language). Lao New Year widely celebrated festival in Laos.&lt;ref name=history-lao&gt;{{cite web|last=Sysamouth|first=Vinya|title=History of the Lao New Year|url=http://www.laonewyear.org/content/view/13/100|accessdate=13 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130329150144/http://www.laonewyear.org/content/view/13/100|archivedate=29 March 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The festival is also celebrated by the Lao in the [[United States of America]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Meny|first1=Josh|title=Hundreds gather for Lao New Year celebration in Coteau|url=http://www.katc.com/story/37854319/hundreds-gather-for-lao-new-year-celebration-in-coteau|accessdate=10 April 2018|publisher=KATC|date=1 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Canada]], [[France]], England and [[Australia]].  Lao New Year takes place in April, the hottest time of the year in Laos, which is also the start of the [[monsoon]] season. Lao New Year takes place at roughly the same time as the new year celebrations of many countries in South Asia like Thailand, India, Sri Lanka and Southeast Asia.

== Festival dates ==
The official festival lasts for three days from April 14 to April 16 (although celebrations can last more than a week in towns like [[Luang Prabang]]). The first day is the last day of the old year. Houses and villages are properly cleaned on the first day. Perfume, water and flowers are also prepared for the Lao New Year. The second day of the festival is the "day of no year", a day that falls in neither the old year or the new year. The last day of the festival marks the start of the new year. In Laos, Lao New Year is a government holiday, with state offices closed during those three days.&lt;ref name="LNYH1"/&gt;

== Traditions ==
=== Water ===
[[File:Lao New Year, flour throwing.jpg|thumb|right|250 px|Pi Mai celebration, flour throwing]]
Water is used for washing homes, Buddha images, monks, and soaking friends and passers-by.&lt;ref name="LNYH1"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bounhouane Douangpangna|first1=Maha|title=Lao New Year History|url=http://www.laoamerica.org/documents/Lao%20New%20Year%20HistoryEng.pdf|publisher=Lao Advancement Organization of America|accessdate=10 April 2018|date=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students first respectfully pour water on their elders, then monks for blessings of long life and peace, and last of all they throw water at each other. The water is perfumed with flowers or natural perfumes. Some people prefer flowers in the water to give a pleasant smell, as well as adding cologne/perfume. Over the years another tradition has developed with Lao New Year: people will smear or throw cream (shaving cream or whipped cream) or white powder on each other during the celebrations.

=== Sand ===
Sand is brought to the temple grounds and is made into [[stupas]] or mounds, then decorated before being given to the monks as a way of making merit. There are two ways to make the sand stupas. One way is to go to the beach, and the other way is to bring sand to the ''vat'', or [[temple]]. Sand stupas are decorated with flags, flowers, white lines, and splashed with perfumed water. Sand stupas symbolize the mountain, Phoukhao Kailat, where King Kabinlaphrôm's head was kept by his seven daughters.

=== Animals ===
Another way to make merit at this time is to set animals free. The Lao believe that even animals need to be free.&lt;ref name="LNYH1"/&gt; The most commonly freed animals are tortoises, fish, crabs, birds, eels, and other small animals.

=== Flowers ===
Flowers are gathered to decorate [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] images. In the afternoons people collect fresh flowers. Senior monks take the younger monks to a garden filled with flowers, where they pick flowers and bring back to the ''wat'' to wash. People who didn't participate in the flower picking bring baskets to wash the flowers so the flowers can shine with the Buddha statues.
In the evening lao people usually go to the temple to worship the Buddhas.

=== Beauty pageant ===
There is an annual beauty pageant in [[Luang Prabang]] to crown Miss Pi Mai Lao (Miss Lao New Year).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Luang Prabang Arranges Special Lao New Year Activities|url=http://jclao.com/luang-prabang-arranges-special-lao-new-year-activities/|accessdate=10 April 2018|publisher=JCLao|date=7 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many beauty pageants in Laos, but Luang Prabang - the old capital - is widely known for its ''Nangsangkhan'' pageant. There are seven contestants, each one symbolizing one of King Kabinlaphrôm's seven daughters.

=== Music and dance ===
During Lao New Year, there are many spectacles including traditional Lao music and social dancing, ''molam'', and ''lamvông'' (circle dancing).&lt;ref name="LNYH1"/&gt; During the daytime many people go to the temple to worship, hoping to have a healthier and happier life in the new year. During the evening, people of all ages go to the temple for entertainment.

== Greetings ==
In greetings there are several ways to wish someone a happy Lao New Year. The most common expressions are ''sôk di pi mai'', ''souksan van pi mai'' or ''sabaidi pi mai'', which can be translated into English as "Happy New Year".

The following is an '''incomplete list of country music festivals,''' which encapsulates [[music festivals]] focused on [[country music]]. This list may have some overlap with the larger topic '''[[list of folk festivals]]''', and may also overlap with the related topics '''[[list of blues festivals]]''', '''[[list of jam band music festivals]]''', '''[[list of bluegrass music festivals]]''', and '''[[list of old-time music festivals]]'''.  Many of the festivals take place in North America.

Country music is a genre of [[American popular music]] that originated in [[Southern United States]], in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] in the 1920s,&lt;ref name="Peterson"&gt;{{cite book| author = Richard A. Peterson| title = Creating Country Music: Fabricating Authenticity| date = 1999-12-15| publisher = University of Chicago Press| isbn = 978-0-226-66285-5| page = 9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and It takes its roots from the southeastern genre of [[American folk music]] and [[Western music (North America)|Western music]]. The origins of country music are the folk music of mostly white, [[working-class Americans]], who blended popular songs, Irish and Celtic fiddle tunes, traditional ballads, and cowboy songs, and various musical traditions from European immigrant communities.&lt;ref&gt;ARRP Bulletin. Vol. 53 No 1. "50&amp;nbsp;Minutes on the Road. Betsy Tower. page 50. citing Commuting in America III and Arbitron.&lt;/ref&gt; [[barn dance|Barn dancing]] and other [[folk dance]] styles would be featured at country music gatherings, and many modern festivals have continued to feature dance, [[rodeo]], or other cultural aspects.

The term ''country music'' gained popularity in the 1940s in preference to the earlier term [[hillbilly]] music, it came to encompass [[Western music (North America)|Western music]], which evolved parallel to hillbilly music from similar roots, in the mid-20th century. The term ''country music'' is used today to describe many [[List of country genres|styles]] and subgenres, and festivals may focus on [[Americana (music)|Americana]] genres such as [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], or newer genres such as [[country rock]], [[country pop]], or [[alternative country]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2599">The '''Munich Kammerspiele''' (German: '''Münchner Kammerspiele''') is a state-funded German-language theatre company based at the ''Schauspielhaus'' on [[Maximilianstraße (Munich)|Maximilianstrasse]] in the Bavarian capital.

==History==
[[Image:Münchner Kammerspiele.jpg|thumb|Schauspielhaus, Maximilianstraße]]
The company was founded in 1906 in [[Schwabing]] as the private troupe of [[Erich Ziegel]]. Beginning in 1917 [[Otto Falckenberg]] served as director; in 1926 he moved the company into the ''Schauspielhaus'', built in [[Art Nouveau]] style in 1901 by [[Richard Riemerschmid]] and [[Max Littmann]]. Since 1933 the Münchner Kammerspiele has been a municipal theatre company of the City of Munich. Since 1961 the ''Werkraumtheater'' has served as its second stage. In 2001 the company gained a rehearsal stage next to the ''Schauspielhaus'' in a large building designed by [[Gustav Peichl]].

==Directors==
Since the 1920s the Münchner Kammerspiele has presented numerous world [[premiere]]s, including works by [[Friedrich Dürrenmatt]], [[Frank Wedekind]] and [[Bertolt Brecht]]. Brecht, [[Bruno Hübner]], [[Axel von Ambesser]], [[Fritz Kortner]], [[Peter Stein]], [[Franz Xaver Kroetz]], [[Robert Wilson (director)|Robert Wilson]], [[George Tabori]], [[Erwin Faber]], [[Max Schreck]] and other important actors and writers have staged plays with the company, often resulting in awards. 

==Artistic leadership==
One famous producing-director ([[Intendant]]) of the Münchner Kammerspiele was Falckenberg (1917-1944). Known as an expert in [[Expressionism]] in Germany during the [[Weimar Republic]], he was credited with producing or directing many celebrated productions at the company, including Brecht’s first staged play, [[Drums in the Night]], in 1922, as well as works by Wedekind, [[August Strindberg]] and [[William Shakespeare]]. Since the 1945 end of [[World War II]], artistic leadership has been in the hands of: [[Erich Engel]] (1945-1947), [[Hans Schweikart]] (1947-1963), [[August Everding]] (1963-1973), [[Hans-Reinhard Müller]] (1973-1983), [[Dieter Dorn]] (1983-2001) and [[Frank Baumbauer]] (2001-2009). In 2010 [[Johan Simons]] was appointed artistic director.

The '''National Railway Museum''' ('''NRM''') is a [[museum]] in [[York]] forming part of the British [[Science Museum Group]] of National Museums and telling the story of [[rail transport]] in Britain and its impact on society. It has won many awards, including the [[European Museum of the Year Award]] in 2001. It is the home of the national collection of historically significant railway vehicles, as well as a collection of other artefacts and both written and pictorial records.

==Overview==
The National Railway Museum in York displays a collection of over 100 [[locomotive]]s and nearly 300 other items of [[rolling stock]], virtually all of which either ran on the railways of [[Great Britain]] or were built there. Also on the {{convert|20|acre|ha|1|abbr=on}} site are many hundreds of thousands of other items and records of social, technical, artistic and historical interest, exhibited mostly in three large halls of a former motive power depot next to the [[East Coast Main Line]], near [[York railway station]]. 

It is the largest museum of its type in Britain, attracting 727,000 visitors during the 2014/15 financial year&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | year =  | url = https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/431351/MUSEUM_FIGURES_April_figures__published_June_2015_.xlsx | title = Museums and Galleries Monthly Statistics (L 263) | work = UK Government Data sets | date = 4 June 2015 | author =  | publisher = Department for Culture, Media &amp; Sport | accessdate = 21 June 2015 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150621221036/https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/431351/MUSEUM_FIGURES_April_figures__published_June_2015_.xlsx | archivedate = 21 June 2015 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; (the largest in the world in terms of floor area of exhibition buildings is [[Musée Français du Chemin de Fer|La Cité du Train]] in the French town of [[Mulhouse]], although this attracts far fewer visitors than the National Railway Museum).

The National Railway Museum was established on its present site, the former York North [[locomotive depot]], in 1975, when it took over the former [[British Rail]]ways collection located in [[Clapham]] and the York Railway Museum located off Queen Street, immediately to the southeast of the railway station;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/AboutUs/history.aspx|title=About us - National Railway Museum|author=|date=|website=National Railway Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; since then, the collection has continued to grow.

The museum is a short walk from the railway station in York, either on the road or via a staircase from the rear of the platforms. A "roadtrain" runs from the city centre (near [[York Minster]]) to the museum on Leeman Road during half term, holidays and summer. [[York Park and Ride]] also serve the museum from the car park entrance, on Line 2 (Rawcliffe Bar-York). Admission to the museum has been free since 2001. It is open daily from 10&amp;nbsp;am to 6&amp;nbsp;pm from February to November and 10&amp;nbsp;am to 5&amp;nbsp;pm during the winter months.

[[National Railway Museum Shildon|Locomotion]] – the National Railway Museum in [[Shildon]], [[County Durham]] was opened in October 2004 and is operated by the NRM in conjunction with [[Durham County Council]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Prime Minister opens Shildon Locomotion museum |magazine=[[The Railway Magazine]] |issue=1244 |date=December 2004 |page=5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It houses more of the National Collection in a new building and a historic site around the former workshop of [[Timothy Hackworth]] and in the most recent full year for which figures have been published (2011–2012), it attracted more than 210,000 visitors.

There are approximately 280 [[rail vehicles]] in the National Collection, with around 100 being at York at any one time and the remainder divided between [[Shildon Locomotion Museum|Locomotion]] at [[Shildon]] and other museums and [[heritage railway]]s. The earliest are [[wagonway]] vehicles of about 1815. The permanent display includes "Palaces on Wheels", a collection of [[Royal Train]] saloons from [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]]'s early trains through to those used by [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] up to the 1970s, among them some of the first rail vehicles to be set aside for preservation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first= Amba|title=Stately Progress: Royal Train Travel since 1840|publisher=National Railway Museum|location=York|year=1997|isbn=1-872826-09-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jenkinson|first= David|last2=Townend|first2= Gwen|title=Palaces on Wheels: Royal Carriages at the National Railway Museum|publisher=H.M.S.O|location=London|year=1981|isbn=0-11-290366-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

The museum has imported several major vehicles for display: the [[Rail transport in the People's Republic of China|Chinese]] Class KF7 [[4-8-4#The British 4-8-4 for China|4–8–4]] locomotive donated in 1981 was built in Britain and the ''[[Wagons-Lits]]'' [[sleeping car]] donated in 1980 had been used on the Paris-London ''[[Night Ferry]]'' service. The single exception to the rule of exhibits associated with Britain is the Japanese [[0 Series Shinkansen]] leading vehicle which was donated to the museum by the [[West Japan Railway Company]] in 2001&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1400749.stm|title=High-speed train crawls to new home|date=21 June 2001|work=BBC News|accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which now forms part of an award-winning display, and is the only Shinkansen vehicle on exhibit outside Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://collection.sciencemuseum.org.uk/objects/co8001129/west-japan-railways-shinkansen-bullet-train-1976-powered-unit|title=West Japan Railways Shinkansen 'Bullet Train', 1976 |accessdate=26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rail vehicles on display are exchanged from time to time with other organisations, and examples of new-build stock from the current industry sometimes visit the museum for short periods.

Other physically large exhibits are the [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]] [[Gaunless Bridge]] and several stationary winding engines used on railway inclines.

The many other two and three-dimensional elements of the collection include signalling equipment, road vehicles, ship models, [[poster]]s, drawings and other artwork,&lt;ref&gt;

The National Railway Museum holds a large open library and archive of railway related material. This includes an internationally significant collection of locomotive and rolling stock [[engineering drawing]]s from railway works and independent manufacturing companies. Copies of many of these engineering drawings are sold to the heritage railway movement to assist with their new build locomotive and restoration projects. They are also sold to modellers who can use the drawing to produce accurate scale models. The library holds more than 20,000 books&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/ResearchAndArchive/archiveandlibrarycollections/Books.aspx |title=NRM Library Books |accessdate= 18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and 800 journals of which around 300 are active.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/ResearchAndArchive/archiveandlibrarycollections/Journals.aspx |title=NRM Library Journal Collection|accessdate= 18 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The archive also holds a large collection of technical and test records, as well as timetables including a large number of [[Bradshaw's Railway Guide|Bradshaw timetables]].

The Search Engine facility opened in late 2007 and is open from 10:00 to 17:30 Wednesday to Saturday. The archive and library collections can be viewed by anyone without an appointment although the website recommends pre-booking archive materials at least 24 hours in advance. The majority of its collections have been listed on its [http://www.nrm.org.uk/ResearchAndArchive/archiveandlibrarycollections.aspx website] for people to view what materials are available prior to their visit. For those people that cannot visit the museum itself there is a research service offered by the museum called [http://www.nrm.org.uk/ResearchAndArchive/enquiriesandvisiting.aspx Inreach].

==Origins==
[[File:Napier Deltic, Alycidon.jpg|thumb|Napier Deltic powered [[British Rail Class 55]] D9009 ''Alycidon'', at the National Railway Museum]]
Although there had been amateur attempts to establish a national railway museum from the late 19th century, the National Collection today results from the fusion of two long-running official initiatives. One was led by the State museums sector, evidencing pioneering technology, and the other by the railway industry, in which the key contribution came from the [[North Eastern Railway (UK)|North Eastern Railway]] as successors to the historic [[Stockton and Darlington Railway]].

What became the [[Science Museum, London|Science Museum]] collection was begun in the 1860s by the Patent Office,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Liffen|first= John|editor-last=Lewis|editor-first= M. J. T. |title=Early Railways 2|year=2003|publisher=Newcomen Society|location=London|isbn=0-904685-13-6|pages=202–20|chapter=The Patent Office Museum and the beginnings of railway locomotive preservation}}&lt;/ref&gt; whose museum included such early relics as ''Puffing Billy'', Stephenson’s ''Rocket'' and ''Agenoria'' (sister locomotive to ''[[Stourbridge Lion]]''), which was outhoused to York at an early date.

Preservation of redundant equipment by the railway companies themselves was a matter of chance. Sometimes relics were stored in company workshops and offices and some were destroyed as circumstances changed. Where put on public display at all the equipment was usually mounted on railway stations in a case or on a plinth.  ''Coppernob'' at [[Barrow-in-Furness]], ''Derwent'' and ''Locomotion'' at [[Darlington]] and ''Tiny'' at [[Newton Abbot]] were long-lived examples of this form of display.

The first railway museums were opened at Hamar in [[Norway]] (1896)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/norway/central-norway/hamar/sights/museums-galleries/norwegian-railway-museum|title=Attractions in Hamar, Norway|first=Lonely|last=Planet|date=|website=lonelyplanet.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nuremberg]] in [[Germany]] (1899). These inspired talk of doing the same in Britain, both in the 1890s and again in 1908,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Steel|first= Ernest A. |last2=Steel |first2=Elenora H.|title=The Miniature World of Henry Greenly|publisher=Model &amp; Allied Publications|location=Kings Langley|year=1973|isbn=0-85242-306-3|pages=45–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this came to nothing at that time. Indeed, two of the [[Great Western Railway]]’s earliest broad-gauge locomotives, ''North Star'' and ''Lord of the Isles'', which had been set aside at [[Swindon Works]], were cut up in 1906 for lack of space and several other relics were similarly lost in subsequent years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Barker|first=Robert|title='Lost' preserved railway rolling stock|journal=Transport History|volume=9|pages=100–9|year=1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1880, J. B. Harper of the North Eastern had been collecting material much of which was exhibited on the occasion of the S.&amp; D.R. centenary in 1925;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=London &amp; North Eastern Railway|title=Catalogue of the Collection of Railway Relics and Modern Stock at Faverdale, Darlington|publisher=L.N.E.R|year=1925}}&lt;/ref&gt; and which then formed the basis of a museum opened at [[York]] by the [[London and North Eastern Railway]] in 1928 under the curatorship of E. M. Bywell.

The smaller exhibits were housed in the old station buildings and the rolling stock and other large exhibits in the former locomotive erecting and repair shops of the old [[York and North Midland Railway]] (demolished after the museum closed).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Household|first= H. G. W.|title=The Railway Museum, London &amp; North Eastern Ry., York|journal=Locomotive|volume=33–4|pages=332–4, 387–9, 49–52|date=August 1927}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

It was only when the NRM was formed that Britain acquired a rail-served railway museum where large exhibits could come and go with ease.

The collection was dominated by items from the North Eastern Railway, together with [[Great Northern Railway (Great Britain)|Great Northern Railway]] items. The other three ‘[[Big Four British railway companies|Big Four]]’ railway companies showed little interest in contributing to the LNER’s initiative, though eventually one locomotive representative of each did find its way there: the Great Western's [[GWR 3700 Class 3440 City of Truro|''City of Truro'']], [[London and North Western Railway]] ''Columbine'' and [[London, Brighton and South Coast Railway]] [[LB&amp;SCR B1 Class|B1 Class]] ''Gladstone''.

The GWR assembled a valuable collection of small objects, mounted privately in a long corridor at [[London Paddington station|Paddington station]], and in 1925 it built a replica of ''North Star''. It preserved ''City of Truro''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Harris|editor-first= Nigel|title=City of Truro, a locomotive legend|publisher=Silver Link Publishing|location=Carnforth|year=1985|isbn=0-947971-02-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Tiny'' in 1931 and purchased ''Shannon'' for preservation in 1946.

The LMS had its own collection of small objects at [[Euston railway station|Euston]]. It also began to build up a collection of historic locomotives, which included [[Caledonian Railway Single|Caledonian 123]], ''Columbine'', ''Cornwall'', ''Hardwicke'', Highland 103, Midland 118 and ''Pet''. Three others, set aside for preservation at [[Crewe Works]], were scrapped in a change of policy in 1932. The LMS set aside one further locomotive (Midland 158A) before it was overtaken by nationalisation. It also succeeded in preserving a collection of historic royal saloons at [[Wolverton]] and built a replica ''Rocket'', with six replica carriages, for the [[Liverpool &amp; Manchester Railway]] centenary in 1930, and a replica [[Grand Junction Railway]] Travelling Post Office.

The [[Southern Railway (Great Britain)|Southern Railway]] inherited three preserved carriages of the [[Bodmin and Wadebridge Railway]], long displayed at York and at [[London Waterloo railway station|Waterloo station]], but otherwise had no policy of preserving redundant equipment. ''Ryde'' was preserved from 1934 until cut up in 1940; the only other locomotive preserved by the Southern was ''Boxhill'' in 1947. (''Gladstone'' was preserved by the [[Stephenson Locomotive Society]] as a private initiative and much later (in 1959) donated to the [[British Transport Commission]].)

The [[nationalisation of British Railways]] in 1948 gave the opportunity for a more consolidated approach and a report was produced by the British Transport Commission in 1951.&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite book|title=The Preservation of Relics and Records: report to the British Transport Commission|publisher=British Transport Commission|location=London|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst other things this recommended a curator be appointed for the Commission’s holdings (John M. Scholes), retention of the York museum, creation of other regional museums (not carried out in the way proposed), a small relics display in the old Great Hall at [[Euston railway station]] (done on a temporary basis) and a large museum of collections elsewhere in London. For the latter, [[Nine Elms railway station|the former station at Nine Elms]] was originally favoured as a site, but what was eventually opened in 1961 was the Museum of British Transport in a former [[bus]] garage in [[Clapham]].&lt;ref&gt;

{{cite book|last=Ellis|first= C. Hamilton|title=Popular Carriage|publisher=British Transport Commission|location=London|year=1954}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An official list of locomotives for preservation was compiled,&lt;ref&gt;

and many were stored in sheds and works throughout the country, others being placed on loan to local authority museums. The [[Swindon Steam Railway Museum|'Steam' Museum]] at [[Swindon]] still displays a large number of items from the National Collection, while the [[Glasgow Museum of Transport]] was also indebted to it, although many of the Scottish relics (including [[North British Railway|NBR]] [[NBR K Class|K 'Glen' Class]] [[4-4-0]] No. 256 ''Glen Douglas'' currently at the [[Bo'ness &amp; Kinneil Railway]]) no longer form part of the National Collection.&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Beeching Report]] recommended that British Rail should stop running museums, and a campaign was led by transport historian [[L. T. C. Rolt]] and others such as the historian [[Jack Simmons (historian)|Jack Simmons]] to create a new museum.&lt;ref&gt;

Agreement was reached under terms in the Transport Act 1968 for B.R. to provide premises to be occupied by a National Railway Museum which would be a branch of the [[National Museum of Science and Industry]] then under Dame [[Margaret Weston]] and the first English [[national museum]] outside London – a move which was at the time criticised by Londoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/the-northerner/2016/may/03/railway-museum-transport-york-london-1969-archive|date=3 May 1969|accessdate=3 May 2016|first=Terry|last=Coleman|newspaper=The Guardian|title=Decision to move museum north angers Londoners}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The building provided was the former locomotive [[Railway roundhouse|roundhouse]] at York North (rebuilt in the 1950s), alongside the East Coast Main Line. The old museum and that at Clapham were closed in 1973. A [[Sainsbury's]] [[supermarket]] now stands on the Clapham site. Some items were retained in the capital and formed the basis of the [[London Transport Museum]] in Covent Garden. Some from York were re-located to the [[Darlington Railway Centre and Museum]]. Exhibits from the previous museums at York and Clapham moved to the new site were supplemented by vehicles taken from storage at Preston Park in [[Brighton]] and elsewhere and restored. Creation of the York museum was largely in the hands of its first keeper, [[John Coiley|Dr John Coiley]],&lt;ref&gt;

==Growth 1975–2000==
[[File:NRM line up.jpg|thumb|left|Locomotives arranged around the turntable in the Great Hall]]
The museum was opened by [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]] in 1975. The opening coincided with the 150th anniversary celebrations of the opening of the Stockton &amp; Darlington Railway, for which several working exhibits were provided. By comparison with the museum’s predecessors coverage of ordinary [[passenger car (rail)|passenger coach]]es and non-steam motive power was enhanced, but a popular new exhibit was [[Southern Region of British Railways|ex-Southern Railway]] [[SR Merchant Navy Class|Merchant Navy Class]] No. 35029 ''Ellerman Lines'' [[Archaeological section|sectioned]] to show the workings of a steam locomotive. The new museum received over a million visitors in its first year and was favourably received by critics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Cossons|first= Neil|title=The National Railway Museum, York|journal=Museums Journal|volume=76|pages=63–5|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;

Significant events of 1979 were the restoration of a train of appropriate vehicles to mark the centenary of on-train catering&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Centenary Express: a guide to the National Railway Museum Catering Centenary Train|publisher=H.M.S.O|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Jenkinson|first=David|last2=St John-Smith|first2= Emma|title=The National Railway Museum Catering Centenary Train|journal=Yesteryear Transport|volume=3|date=Winter 1980|pages=84–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an exhibition to mark the centenary of [[railway electric traction]] which drew attention to the museum's important collections in this area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gibbon|first=R. H.|title=The electric traction exhibits of the National Collection|journal=Friends of the National Railway Museum Newsletter|volume=75|pages=14–18|date=May 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1979 the museum commissioned a working replica of [[Stephenson's Rocket]] for the following year’s [[Liverpool and Manchester Railway]] 150th anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Satow|first=M. G.|title=Rocket reborn|magazine=Railway Magazine|volume=125|pages=472–4|year=1979}}&lt;/ref&gt; This has since represented the museum at events around the world.

Another working replica was added to the collection for the 150th anniversary of establishment of the [[Great Western Railway]] in 1985: that of the {{RailGauge|7ft}} [[Broad Gauge#History|broad gauge]] locomotive [[GWR Iron Duke Class|''Iron Duke'']].

In 1990, The [[Rev. W. Awdry]]'s [[Railway Series]] [[Thomas the Tank Engine]] books were assured a permanent place in the NRM's collection of historical railway books, due to their role in maintaining children's interests in railways. In 1991, Christopher Awdry chose to fictionalise this event in ''[[List of Railway Series Books|Thomas and the Great Railway Show]]'', where Thomas (the most iconic of Awdry's characters) was made an honorary member of the NRM collection by Sir Topham Hatt and the Director of the NRM.

Concerns about the condition of the [[concrete]] roof structure on the main building brought forward major changes to the museum in 1990. To maintain a presence at York, the former York goods depot across Leeman Road, already in use as a museum store (the Peter Allen Building), was configured to display trains as if in a passenger station, and this together with the adjacent South Yard was marketed as ''The Great Railway Show''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blakemore|first= Michael|title=Great Railway Show at the National Railway Museum, York: souvenir booklet|publisher=National Museum of Science &amp; Industry|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; A further selection of exhibits formed the ''National Railway Museum on Tour'' on display for a season in the former [[Swindon Works]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Heap|editor-first= Christine|title=National Railway Museum on Tour – Swindon, 1990|publisher=National Museum of Science &amp; Industry|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Meanwhile, the main building was completely re-roofed and reconstructed retaining only one of the two original 1954 [[Turntable (railroad)|turntables]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Coiley|first= J. A.|title=York locoshed furore: NRM replies|magazine=Steam Railway|volume=116|date=December 1989|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first=Rob|last=Shorland-Ball|title=All Change: New buildings and displays at the National Railway Museum, 1988-1992|journal=National Railway Museum Review|volume=154|date=Winter 2015–16|pages=10–15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was reopened on 16 April 1992 by [[Prince Edward, Duke of Kent]] as the Great Hall giving enhanced opportunities to display large artifacts such as [[railway signals]], a [[Foot Over Bridge|footbridge]] from [[Percy Main Metro station|Percy Main station]] and a segment from the [[Channel Tunnel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |title=Duke of Kent Opens National Railway Museum's Great Hall |magazine=[[The Railway Magazine]] |issue=1094 |date=June 1992 |page=10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The former goods shed display was retained as the Station Hall.
[[File:Railway signals.jpg|thumb|[[#Semaphore signals|Semaphore railway signals]] in the Museum’s Great Hall]]

In 1995 the museum joined forces with the [[University of York]] to create an academic research base, the Institute of Railway Studies (and Transport History).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Institute of Railway Studies and Transport History|url=http://www.york.ac.uk/inst/irs/|publisher=University of York|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also since partnered with [[York College (York)|York College]] to create the Yorkshire Rail Academy to teach vocational skills. The museum has also provided [[engineering apprentice]]ships and participates in partnerships aimed at delivering heritage skills training.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal|last=Ashby|first= Helen|title=Teaching old dogs new tricks... and new dogs old tricks?|journal=National Railway Museum Review|volume=120|pages=11–12|date=Summer 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996 the Museum Garden was created incorporating a {{RailGauge|7.25in}} [[Rail gauge|gauge]] [[ridable miniature railway]]. A playground was also added.

Continued concern over the condition of the remaining 1950s buildings on the site led to their replacement by ''The Works'' in 1999. This gave several functional areas: the ''Workshop'', for maintenance of rolling stock;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=David|last=Fowler|title=On track with rail buff|url=https://www.theengineer.co.uk/inspiration/on-track-with-rail-buff/|work=[[The Engineer (magazine)|The Engineer]]|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Workshop Gallery'', from which the public can look down on this work; a ''Working Railway Gallery'', giving an insight into current and recent operation including a balcony overlooking [[York railway station]] hosting a set of [[video monitor|monitors]] showing live feeds from the monitors at York [[Integrated Electronic Control Centre|IECC]];&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Network Rail chairman Rick Haythornthwaite opens new signalling attraction at National Railway Museum in York|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/4706338.New_signalling_attraction_opens_at_National_Railway_Museum_in_York/|accessdate=30 January 2016|work=York Press|date=28 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the ''Warehouse'' which provides an innovative open storage area, which has proved popular with both public and museum professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wright|first=David|title=3D|journal=National Railway Museum Review|volume=97|page=22|date=Autumn 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Developments in the 21st century==
[[File:National Railway Museum Inclinator.JPG|thumb|upright|Former inclinator between floors]]
In order to provide step-free access from the main hall to the Workshop Gallery, the Museum Inclinator was constructed. Besides its primary function, this also served to demonstrate the workings of a [[funicular railway]]. To that end its workings were exposed in the style of a larger open air funicular railway, rather than being concealed in the fabric of the building as is more normal for intramural lifts.&lt;ref name=nrmpgreen&gt;
{{cite press release |url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/2006/greenrailways.asp|title=Green Railways|publisher=National Railway Museum|date=23 May 2006|accessdate=4 October 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061001115541/http://www.nrm.org.uk/pressoffice/pressreleases/2006/greenrailways.asp |archivedate=1 October 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unfortunately, due to lack of spare parts, it ceased working, and with no plans for repair it was removed by August 2013.

2004 saw several major developments at the museum. Several railway anniversaries were celebrated by a major "Railfest".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Railfest: official souvenir programme|publisher=Steam Railway|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite book|last=Gwynne|first=Bob|title=Celebrating Rail: the story of Railfest|publisher=Nostalgia Road|location=Kendal|year=2005|isbn=1-903016-56-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another took place from 25–30 May 2008 with a Sixties theme. The [[Shildon Locomotion Museum|Locomotion]] museum was opened at [[Shildon]], [[County Durham]] providing undercover collection care facilities for more rail vehicles (particularly freight wagons) from the museum's collection. In addition, the museum had a high-profile campaign, supported by the [[National Heritage Memorial Fund]], to purchase [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|''Flying Scotsman'']]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Scott|first=Andrew|title=How we saved the ''Flying Scotsman'' |magazine=Railway Magazine|volume=150|issue=1238|pages=14–19|date=June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; which arrived at the Museum as the climax of Railfest.

The first stage of a new centre providing easy access to the museum’s Library and Archives, called "Search Engine",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |editor=Foster, Richard|title=Search Engine: opening the archives of the NRM |magazine=Steam Railway|volume=324|date=13 June 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite magazine |last=Richards|first=Stephen|title=Changing the face of the National Railway Museum |magazine=Steam Railway|volume=325|date=July 2006|pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt; opened at the end of 2007.

From 18 July to 23 August 2008, a popular new venture was the staging by [[York Theatre Royal]] at the Museum of the play of [[E. Nesbit]]'s ''[[The Railway Children]]'', awarded five stars in ''[[The Guardian]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pick of the week: Theatre|work=The Guardian|date=23 August 2008|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2008/aug/23/northlistings.theatre|accessdate=12 October 2008|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Railway Children|journal=National Railway Museum Review|volume=125|pages=14–17|date=Autumn 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following this success, it was repeated in 2009, from 23 July to 3 September, and the museum provided locomotives for subsequent performances at [[Waterloo International railway station|Waterloo International station]] and in [[Toronto]].

Major plans under the name "NRM+" were made for refurbishing the Great Hall display, for which a preliminary [[Heritage Lottery Fund]] contribution was announced in 2009,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRM+|url=http://www.lotterygoodcauses.org.uk/project/nrm|website=Lottery Good Causes|accessdate=30 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; and seeking potential partners for a further outhousing project.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Hopkins|first=Danny|title=You provide the venue and we'll provide the show |magazine=Steam Railway|volume=357|date= 12 December 2008 – 8 January 2009|pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Haigh|first=Phil|title=NRM annex plan revealed |magazine=Steam Railway|volume=365|date=24 July – 20 August 2009|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are other partnerships for development of the museum estate and the land around it (much owned by Network Rail) as "York Central"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk|title=NRM website|accessdate=14 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the economic situation during 2009 put these particular plans in abeyance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=York Central plans now in abeyance|magazine=Today's Railways UK|volume=96|date=December 2009|page=71}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a similar York Central project was launched by the city council at the beginning of 2016. The NRM+ project was cancelled in April 2011 due to lack of success in assembling the funding package.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite_journal|url=http://www.museumsassociation.org/museums-journal/news/27042011-nrm-scraps-facelift|title=National Railway Museum scraps plans for £21m facelift|date=27 April 2011|first=Geraldine|last=Kendall|journal=[[Museums Journal]]|publisher=Museums Association|accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, major changes to the displays in the Station Hall began later in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Work in Progress – Station Hall|journal=National Railway Museum Review|volume=137|date=Autumn 2011|pages=13–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012, the NRM decided to repatriate temporarily the two [[LNER Class A4|LNER A4 class]] steam locomotives, numbers [[LNER Class A4 4496 Dwight D Eisenhower|60008 ''Dwight D Eisenhower]]'' and [[LNER Class A4 4489 Dominion of Canada|60010 ''Dominion of Canada]]'' from their homes at the National Railroad Museum in Green Bay, Wis. and Exporail in Montreal, Quebec, as part of the '''Mallard'' 75' event in 2013. The two locomotives would be on loan for up to two years, during which time the locomotives would be cosmetically restored, 60008 in BR Brunswick Green (as it appeared in 1963 on withdrawal) and 60010 as LNER 4489 in Garter Blue with its original Canadian Pacific Railway bell (as it appeared in 1939).

On 8 December 2012 it was announced that an annex to the National Railway Museum would be built close to Leicester North station on the [[Great Central Railway (heritage railway)]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-20651102|work=BBC News|title=Great Central Railway plans museum in Leicester|date=8 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding crisis point===
In June 2013, the ''York Press'' reported that NRM was facing a funding crisis due to a potential 10% annual cut to the Science Museum Group's funding, an estimated real-terms 25% cut following lay-offs and disbandment of projects.  The museum was considering scaling down its functions, re-introducing admissions charges or facing complete closure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yorkpress.co.uk/news/10467289.Campaign_launched_to_save_York_s_National_Railway_Museum_from_closure/|title=Campaign launched to save York's National Railway Museum from closure|author=|date=|website=York Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.itv.com/news/calendar/update/2013-06-07/york-mp-lobbies-over-future-of-national-railway-museum/|title=York MP lobbies regarding future of railway museum|date=7 June 2013|publisher=ITV|accessdate=4 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, following a campaign by local residents the Chancellor [[George Osborne]] announced a 5% cut in the museum's budget. This prompted Science Museum Group director [[Ian Blatchford]] to announce two weeks later that the museum had been doubly saved &amp;mdash; he added that had the 10% cut taken place the Group would have chosen to close the [[National Media Museum]] in [[Bradford]].

==Policies==
[[File:York Wheel.jpg|thumb|upright|The [[Yorkshire Wheel]], sited from 2006 to 2008 at the NRM, was one of the museum's fund raising initiatives]]
Criticisms of the museum which have been raised include claims that it has devoted insufficient attention to modern traction;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Dunn|first= Pip|title=The NRM on the spot|magazine=Railways Illustrated|volume=5|issue=6|pages=30–2|date=June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Smith|first=Ian R.|title=Bring them in from the cold!|magazine=Heritage Railway|volume=92|pages=68–71|date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Dunn|first=Pip|title=Museum peace|magazine=Railways Illustrated|pages=28–30|date=October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; that it was neglecting scholarship in favour of commercialism;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jenkinson|first=David|title=Quo vadis, NRM?|journal=Backtrack|volume=3|page=99|year=1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; or that its photographic collections constitute a "black hole".&lt;ref name="Harris - photo" /&gt; The museum's response is that these criticisms do not always take into account the financial constraints under which the museum operates:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last=Courtney|first=Geoff|title=NRM is 'poor relation' of Britain's state museums|magazine=Heritage Railway|volume=92|page=6|date=December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; its Grant in Aid from the [[Department for Culture, Media and Sport]] amounts to £6.50 per visitor which delivers less overall income than for comparable London museums. For some of its funding the museum depends on money-making events such as the [[Yorkshire Wheel]], which operated at the museum from 2006 to 2008 and visits from [[Thomas the Tank Engine]] as chronicled in ''[[List of Railway Series Books#Thomas and the Great Railway Show|Thomas and the Great Railway Show]]''. The museum has also suffered a few thefts of objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Courtney|first= Geoff|title=Four more thefts from NRM |magazine=Heritage Railway|volume=96|page=5|date=April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum can be allocated material from the railway industry by the [[Railway Heritage Committee]]. Because of the diversity of material falling potentially within the museum's collection policy and the problems of caring for it, decisions on acquisition of new items for the collection can be difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heap|first= Christine J.|editor-last=Shorland-Ball|editor-first=Rob|title=Common Roots – Separate Branches: railway history and preservation|year=1994|publisher=Science Museum|location=London|isbn=0-901805-77-7|pages=153–5|chapter=The National Railway Museum, York}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashby|first=Helen|last2=Bartholomew|first2= Ed|last3=Rees|first3=Jim|title=Electric Multiple Units in the National Collection|journal=National Railway Museum Review|volume=118|pages=13–14|date=Winter 2006–07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previously the museum has treated rolling stock as if it were effectively still in railway service and capable of undergoing repeated heavy repairs and restoration. Since being preserved many of the museum's locomotives have operated on the main line, [[heritage railway]]s or at the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Ian R.|title=Steam Alive: locomotives of the National Railway Collection in steam|publisher=FNRM|location=York|year=1993|isbn=0-9522396-0-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Blakemore|first=Michael|last2=Mosley|first2=David|title=Great British Locomotives: National Railway Museum locomotives in action|publisher=[[Ian Allan Publishing|Ian Allan]]|location=Shepperton|year=1997|isbn=0-7110-2400-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, there have been moves to less interventionist forms of conservation in some cases leading to some exhibits becoming non-operational.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hopkin|first=Dieter|editor-last=Shorland-Ball|editor-first=Rob|title=Common Roots – Separate Branches: railway history and preservation|year=1994|publisher=Science Museum|location=London|isbn=0-901805-77-7|pages=215–21|chapter=A commentary on restoration, conservation and the National Railway Museum collection}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Museum's management of the protracted overhaul of [[LNER Class A3 4472 Flying Scotsman|LNER Class A3 4472 ''Flying Scotsman'']] was heavily criticised in an internally commissioned report in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|title=Flying Scotsman debacle|magazine=The Railway Magazine|volume=158|issue=1340|date=December 2012|page=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1977, the Friends of the National Railway Museum have been in existence as a group to give financial and other support to the museum, such as financing the original restoration to steam of ''Duchess of Hamilton''.

The 1990 "Great Railway Show" won the Museum of the Year award and in 2001 the museum gained the [[European Museum of the Year Award]]. It has also won White Rose awards from the Yorkshire Tourist Board, and in recognition of the several major developments in 2004 was given the [[Heritage Railway Association]]'s Peter Manisty Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Museum receives award for its efforts|work=Northern Echo|date=1 November 2004|url=http://www.thenorthernecho.co.uk/news/6973204.Museum_receives_award_for_its_efforts/|accessdate=21 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Online presence==
The National Railway Museum website offers a facility for visitors to plan their visit to the museum in advance. The museum also has a policy of improving access to its collections via its website. It has uploaded some of the recordings from the National Archive of Railway History to its website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRM Railway Voices|work=National Railway Museum|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/RailwayStories/railwayvoices.aspx|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also created an [[App Store (iOS)|iPhone App]] in association with [[East Coast (train operating company)|East Coast]] that allows people travelling between London and Edinburgh on the [[East Coast Main Line]] through York to view objects from the collection in connection with locations on the route.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRM iPhone App|work=National Railway Museum|url=http://timeline.nrm.org.uk/|accessdate=1 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121204082054/http://timeline.nrm.org.uk/|archivedate=4 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The museum's archives and library service Search Engine is increasingly making its collection accessible online by providing catalogues and lists for researchers to search before visiting and adding low resolution copies of its drawing online.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRM collections lists|work=National Railway Museum|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/ResearchAndArchive/archiveandlibrarycollections.aspx/|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The library collection can be searched through the [[University of York]] library catalogue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=University of York Library Catalogue|work=University of York|url=http://libcatalogue.york.ac.uk/F/?func=find-b-0&amp;local_base=nrm/|accessdate=1 November 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121223135529/http://libcatalogue.york.ac.uk/F/?func=find-b-0&amp;local_base=nrm/|archivedate=23 December 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; All of the museum's rolling stock and a large amount of other material has also been added to the website&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NRM Collections|work=National Railway Museum|url=http://www.nrm.org.uk/OurCollection.aspx|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[LNER Class A4]] 4–6–2 [[LNER Class A4 4468 Mallard|4468 ''Mallard'']]. Restored to steam for a time from 1986; now on static display. Unlikely to run again due to exhibit popularity and the fact that all the other A4s in the UK have been restored to working order.
*[[SR Class Q1]] 0–6–0 No. C1. On static display.  However it is possible it will return to the [[Bluebell Railway]], where it was based for many years, to be returned to service.
*[[BR standard class 9F]] 2–10–0 [[BR standard class 9F 92220 Evening Star|92220 ''Evening Star'']], the last steam locomotive built for [[British Rail]]ways. On static display and not expected to return to working order due to class being barred from running on the national network. Returned to York in 2010 after a two-year loan to the [[Museum of the Great Western Railway]], [[Swindon]].

''' Nils Jørgen Fuglesang ''' (7 October 1918 – 29 March 1944), was a Norwegian [[Supermarine Spitfire]] pilot who was taken prisoner during the [[Second World War]]. He is notable for the part he took in the 'Great Escape' from [[Stalag Luft III]] in March 1944 and as one of the men re-captured and subsequently shot by the ''[[Gestapo]]''.

==Pre-war life==
Fuglesang was born at [[Rasvåg]] in [[Hidra (island)|Hidra]], near [[Flekkefjord]], [[Norway]] the son of a customs official&lt;ref name="Vance 176"&gt;Vance (2000), p.176&lt;/ref&gt; he was raised and educated in [[Florø]]. German prisoner of war records confirm his residency in Florø&lt;ref name="Andrews photo pg"&gt;Andrews (1976), photo page – German records&lt;/ref&gt; but do not give any details of his date and place of birth. From September 1935 Fuglesang received three years education in economics at the French Lycee Pierre Corneille in [[Rouen]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr/IMG/pdf/Nils_Jorgen_FUGLESANG.pdf LG Corneille website – Nils Fuglesang]&lt;/ref&gt; before studying at the Bergen Commercial College. He was working as an apprentice with an [[Oslo]] shipping company when the war began.
Following the [[Operation Weserübung|German invasion]] in April 1940 and the [[Norwegian campaign|ensuing battles]] the country [[German occupation of Norway|was occupied]]. Fuglesang decided to escape from Norway to get to Great Britain and join the [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile]]. Sea traffic was closely monitored by the Germans who were aware of significant numbers of young Norwegians wishing to continue the fight from England, frequent checks and searches were made and penalties harsh for anybody caught. On 12 March 1941 he escaped from Kyammen to [[Shetland]] aboard the boat ''Heimfjell'' with 11 others.

==War service==
Fuglesang enlisted in the [[Norwegian Army Air Service]] with service number 742 and sailed in May to Canada to train at [[Little Norway]], the [[Norwegian Armed Forces in exile|exiled Norwegian forces]] camp at [[Toronto Island Airport]].  He completed basic training and learned more English language then completing flight training. 
He was awarded his [[aircrew brevet]] pilots wings and promoted [[sergeant]] towards the end of 1941.&lt;ref name="Vance 176" /&gt;  His instructors recommended that had the aptitude to become a fighter pilot during which he was promoted to [[lieutenant]].  After further training Fuglesang sailed for England where he joined Operational Training Unit and began to fly [[Supermarine Spitfire]] aircraft.
On 9 June 1942 he joined [[No. 332 Squadron RAF]]&lt;ref name="Vance 176" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ulstein (1979)&lt;/ref&gt; a squadron manned by Norwegian personnel flying [[Supermarine Spitfire]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cieldegloire.com/002n_fuglesang_n_j.php Ciel de Gloire website – Nils Guglesang]&lt;/ref&gt; at [[RAF North Weald]] flying operationally with the fighter wing commanded by [[wing commander (rank)|wing commander]] [[Don Finlay]] which operated from that base. He flew on fighter sweep and bomber escort missions over the [[English Channel]] to occupied France and the Netherlands. In action on 20 January 1943 he attacked a German [[Fw 190]] fighter over the French coast, this was assessed as probably destroyed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wingstovictory.nl/database/pdf/245-story.pdf Wings to Victory – Nils Fuglesang]&lt;/ref&gt;   His reputation as a reliable and steady pilot resulted in him being awarded the Norwegian [[King Haakon VII Freedom Medal]] and a promotion to [[pilot officer]] in March 1943.&lt;ref name="Vance 176" /&gt;

==Prisoner of war==
[[File:Model Stalag Luft III.jpg|thumb|right|305px|Model of Stalag Luft III prison camp.]]
At 1905 hours on 2 May 1943 Nils Jørgen Fuglesang was flying [[Supermarine Spitfire]] Mark IX (serial number “BS540” squadron codes “AH-E”) on a Ramrod mission with [[North Weald]] wing over south west Holland.&lt;ref name="Franks 95"&gt;Franks (1998), p.95&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wingstovictory.nl/database/pdf/245-story.pdf Wings to Victory Website – Nils Fuglesang]&lt;/ref&gt;  His squadron were in action with [[Luftwaffe]] [[Focke Wulf]] [[Fw 190]] fighters and as wingman he stuck to the tail of his lead pilot until a burst of 20mm cannon fire intended for the lead aircraft hit his own aircraft.&lt;ref&gt;National Archives, London. Operations Record Book, 332 Squadron. Appendix 02/05/1943&lt;/ref&gt; Fuglesang crash landed in Zeeland, the SW part of Holland and was taken prisoner by German infantrymen training close by.&lt;ref name="Vance 176" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rafcommands.com/archive/11548.php RAF Commands – Nils Fuglesang]&lt;/ref&gt; Photograph of his crashed aircraft is in Franks book.&lt;ref name="Franks 95" /&gt; He became prisoner of war No. 1264&lt;ref name="Andrews photo pg" /&gt; held at [[Stalag Luft III]] in the province of Lower Silesia near the town of [[Sagan, Germany|Sagan]] (now [[Żagań]] in [[Poland]]).

=='Great Escape'==
Fuglesang was an enthusiastic member of the tunneling crew participating in regular shifts to lengthen and shore up the tunnel, he and fellow Norwegian [[Halldor Espelid]] were near the front of the list of men escaping and they had cleared the tunnel exit by 2230 hours.&lt;ref name="Andrews 55"&gt;Andrews (1976), p.55&lt;/ref&gt;
So he was one of the 76 men who escaped the prison camp on the night of 24–25 March 1944 in the escape now famous as "[[Stalag Luft III|the Great Escape]]".  
He teamed up with fellow Free Norwegian [[Halldor Espelid]], [[James Catanach]] an Australian who was fluent in German and spoke Norwegian and the New Zealander of Danish ancestry [[Arnold George Christensen]] in a group heading for Denmark and possibly ultimately neutral Sweden.
Fuglesang and his team reached Berlin&lt;ref name="Andrews 55" /&gt; as they were seen there by other escapers before they changed trains to Hamburg which they also reached successfully only to be caught on the next leg of their rail journey from Hamburg to the naval town of Flensburg on the Danish border. 
Nearing the Danish border on 26 March 1944 a suspicious policemen insisted on carefully examining their papers and checking their briefcases which contained newspapers and escape rations. Close inspection of their clothing revealed they were wearing altered greatcoats.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4605/history/story01.htm Australian Defence Website – Fuglesang and Catanach] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071120191115/http://www.defence.gov.au/news/raafnews/editions/4605/history/story01.htm |date=2007-11-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the four escapees had split up to pretend to be travelling individually they were all in the same railway carriage, more policemen arrived and closely examined every passenger, soon arresting all four suspects. An alternative version states that the two Norwegians were arrested on the Marienhelzungsweg and Catanach and Christensen on the Helm.&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.266&lt;/ref&gt; The escapers were taken to Flensburg prison.&lt;ref name="Walker"&gt;Walker (2015)&lt;/ref&gt; 
The four men were handed over to the Kiel Gestapo and after interrogation were told that they would be taken by road back to prison camp.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lgcorneille-lyc.spip.ac-rouen.fr/IMG/pdf/Nils_Jorgen_FUGLESANG.pdf LG Corneille website – photos of Fuglesang and colleagues after recapture]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 March 1944 two black sedan cars arrived, [[James Catanach]] was taken in the first car with three Gestapo agents including SS-Sturmbannfuhrer Johannes Post a senior officer based there. Post had his driver stop the car in the countryside outside Kiel about 1630 hours and called [[James Catanach]] out into a field where he promptly shot him.&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.23-35&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.169-172&lt;/ref&gt; The second car drew up in the same place shortly afterwards and Post told his agents to get the hand-cuffed [[Arnold George Christensen]], [[Halldor Espelid]] and Nils Fuglesang out, stating that they should take a break before their long drive.  As the airmen walked into the field they almost stumbled over Catanach’s body as they were also shot.&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.172-173 and p.177-178&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Walker" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976) p.196&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.288&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess"&gt;Burgess (1990), p.271&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pegasusarchive.org/pow/cSL_3_Fifty.htm Pegasus Archive - 50 murdered escapers]&lt;/ref&gt; The four men were cremated at [[Kiel]] under [[Gestapo]] supervision.

Fuglesang was one of the 50 escapers who had been listed by SS-Gruppenfuhrer [[Arthur Nebe]] to be killed&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.34&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.304&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Andrews photo pg" /&gt; so was amongst the unfortunate [[Stalag Luft III murders|executed and murdered]] by the ''Gestapo''.&lt;ref&gt;Feast (2015), p.140&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Burgess" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.205&lt;/ref&gt; Originally his remains were buried at Sagan, but his cremation urn was removed to Kirkehavn [[Hidra (island)|Hidra]] near [[Flekkefjord]], Norway for his family.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/26754337 N J Fuglesang grave]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Walton (2014), p422&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://wingstovictory.nl/database/pdf/245-story.pdf Wings to Victory- Nils Fuglesang]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Norwegians Nils Fuglesang and [[Halldor Espelid]] were on the list of officers named in the British press on 20 May 1944 as having been killed.&lt;ref&gt;Western Morning News, Dundee Courier, Yorkshire Post, 20/05/1944&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:The50Memorial.jpg|thumb|Memorial to "The Fifty" down the road toward Żagań (Espelid at left)]]

==Awards==
*[[King Haakon VII Freedom Medal]] awarded March 1943&lt;ref name="Vance 176" /&gt; for significant service to Norway during the Second World War.
*[[Mention in Despatches]] by the [[Royal Air Force]] for his actions in captivity, as none of the other relevant decorations then available could be awarded posthumously. It was not published in the supplement to the ''London Gazette'' on 8 June 1944 when the British and Commonwealth personnel were honoured for fear of reprisals against his family in German occupied Norway.

==Other victims==
{{main|Stalag Luft III murders}}

The ''Gestapo'' executed a group of 50 of the recaptured prisoners representing almost all of the nationalities involved in the escape. Post-war investigations saw a number of those guilty of the murders tracked down, arrested and tried for their crimes.&lt;ref&gt;Read (2012), p.295&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vance (2000), p.310&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andrews (1976), p.188 and 199&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Vancouver1798map-SanJuan-Gulf.png|thumb|Vancouver's 1798 map, showing some confusion in the vicinity of southeastern Vancouver Island, the Gulf Islands, and Haro Strait]]

The '''Pig War''' was a confrontation in 1859 between the United States and [[United Kingdom]] over the [[Canada–United States border|British–U.S. border]] in the [[San Juan Islands]], between [[Vancouver Island]] and the mainland. The Pig War, so called because it was triggered by the shooting of a [[pig]], is also called the '''Pig Episode''', the '''Pig and Potato War''', the '''San Juan Boundary Dispute''' or the '''Northwestern Boundary Dispute'''.  With no shots exchanged and no human casualties, this dispute was a [[bloodless war|bloodless conflict]].

==Background==
The [[Oregon Treaty]] of June 15, 1846, resolved the [[Oregon boundary dispute]] by dividing the [[Oregon Country]]/[[Columbia District]] between the United States and Britain "along the [[49th parallel north|forty-ninth parallel]] of north latitude to the middle of the channel which separates the continent from [[Vancouver Island]], and thence southerly through the middle of the said channel, and of the [[Strait of Juan de Fuca]], to the [[Pacific Ocean]]."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Oregon Treaty|Oregon Treaty]] from Wikisource.  Visited October 16, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, there are actually two straits that could be called the middle of the channel: [[Haro Strait]], along the west side of the [[San Juan Islands]]; and [[Rosario Strait]], along the east side.&lt;ref name="Matthews"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wahmee.com/pigwar.html |title=The Pig War of San Juan Island |last=Matthews |first=Todd |work=The Tablet |publisher=www.wahmee.com |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080709060607/http://www.wahmee.com/pigwar.html |archivedate=2008-07-09 |accessdate=2012-09-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1846, there was still some uncertainty about the geography of the region. The most commonly available maps were those of [[George Vancouver]], published in 1798, and of [[Charles Wilkes]], published in 1845. In both cases the maps are unclear in the vicinity of the southeastern coast of Vancouver Island and the [[Gulf Islands]]. As a result, Haro Strait is not fully clear either.&lt;ref name=hayes&gt;{{cite book |last= Hayes |first= Derek |title= Historical Atlas of the Pacific Northwest: Maps of exploration and Discovery |year= 1999 |publisher= Sasquatch Books |isbn= 1-57061-215-3 |pages= 171–174}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1856, the US and Britain set up a Boundary Commission to resolve a number of issues regarding the international boundary, including the water boundary from the Strait of Georgia to the Strait of Juan de Fuca. The British appointed [[James Charles Prevost]] First Commissioner, [[George Henry Richards]] Second Commissioner, and William A. G. Young Secretary. The US appointed Archibald Campbell First Commissioner,&lt;ref name="bound1857"&gt;{{cite web|title=The International Boundary Commission first meets on June 27, 1857|url=http://www.historylink.org/index.cfm?DisplayPage=output.cfm&amp;file_id=9328|work=HistoryLink.org|publisher=Online Encyclopedia of Washington State History|accessdate=19 July 2013|author=Phil Dougherty|page=9328|date=28 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Parke]] Second Commissioner, and William J. Warren Secretary. On June 27, 1857, the American and British commissioners met for the first time on board the British ship [[HMS Satellite (1855)|HMS ''Satellite'']],&lt;ref name="bound1857" /&gt; anchored in [[Esquimalt Harbour]]. The two sides met several more times in 1857 in [[Esquimalt Harbour]] and [[Nanaimo]] Harbour, and corresponded by letter between meetings. The water boundary was discussed from October to December. From the start, Prevost maintained that Rosario Strait was required by the treaty's wording and was intended by the treaty framers, while Campbell had the same opinion for Haro Strait.

Prevost held that the channel specified in the treaty must have three key qualities: 
# it must separate the continent from Vancouver Island, 
# it must carry the boundary in a southerly direction, and 
# it must be navigable.

Only Rosario fulfilled these requirements, he wrote. Campbell countered that the expression "southerly", in the treaty, was to be understood in a general sense, that Rosario Strait did not separate the continent from Vancouver Island, but the San Juan Islands from [[Lummi Island]], [[Cypress Island]], [[Fidalgo Island]], and others, and that navigability was not germane to the issue, but even if it was, Haro Strait was the wider and more direct passage. Finally he challenged Prevost to produce any evidence showing that the treaty framers had intended Rosario Strait. Prevost responded to the challenge by referring to American maps showing the boundary running through Rosario Strait, included one by [[John C. Frémont]], produced for and published by the US government, and another by  John B. Preston, Surveyor-General of Oregon in 1852. To the other points, Prevost repeated his statements about Rosario Strait's navigability—the channels between Lummi, Cypress, and Fidalgo islands not being navigable—and that a line through Rosario would be southerly, while one through Haro would have to be drawn westerly. The two continued to discuss the issue into December 1857, until it was clear what each side's argument was and that neither would be convinced of the other. Prevost made a final offer at the sixth meeting, December 3. He suggested a compromise line through San Juan Channel, which would give the US all the main islands except San Juan Island. This offer was rejected and the commission adjourned, agreeing to report back to their respective governments. Thus ambiguity over the water boundary remained.&lt;ref name="ScholefieldHoway1914"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Scholefield|first1=Ethelbert Olaf Stuart|last2=Howay|first2=Frederic William|authorlink2=Frederic William Howay|title=British Columbia from the earliest times to the present. Vol. 2|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGdJtwAACAAJ|accessdate=22 June 2011|year=1914|publisher=The S.J. Clarke publishing company|oclc= 697901687|pages=303–306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of this ambiguity, both the United States and Britain claimed [[sovereignty]] over the San Juan Islands.&lt;ref name="GOV"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nps.gov/archive/sajh/Pig_War_new.htm | title=The Pig War | publisher=National Park Service, U.S. Department of the Interior | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070110072744/http://www.nps.gov/archive/sajh/Pig_War_new.htm | archivedate=2007-01-10 | accessdate=2012-09-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period of disputed sovereignty, Britain's [[Hudson's Bay Company]] established operations on San Juan and turned the island into a sheep ranch.  Meanwhile, by mid-1859, twenty-five to twenty-nine American settlers had arrived.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nosracines.ca/e/page.aspx?id=3620632 ''British Columbia: From the earliest times to the present, Vol II''] by E.O.S. Scholefield and F.W. Howay&lt;/ref&gt;

San Juan Island held significance not for its size, but as a military strategic point.  While the British held [[Fort Victoria (British Columbia)|Fort Victoria]] on Vancouver Island to the west, overlooking the Strait of Juan de Fuca, the entry point to Haro Strait, leading to the Strait of Georgia, the nation that held the San Juan Islands would be able to dominate all the straits connecting the Strait of Juan de Fuca with the Strait of Georgia.{{Citation needed|reason=While it's fairly obvious that the islands held strategic value, it would be nice to have a source to back up this paragraph|date=June 2011}}

==Pig killed==
On June 15, 1859, exactly thirteen years after the adoption of the Oregon Treaty, the ambiguity led to direct conflict. Lyman Cutlar, an American farmer who had moved onto [[San Juan Island]] claiming rights to live there under the [[Donation Land Claim Act]], found a [[Large Black (pig)|large black pig]] rooting in his garden.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodbury"&gt;{{cite news | first=Chuck | last=Woodbury | title=How One Pig Could Have Changed American History | url=http://www.outwestnewspaper.com/pigwars.html | work=Out West #15 | publisher=Out West Newspaper | year=2000 | accessdate=2006-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;
He had found the pig eating his [[tuber]]s. This was not the first occurrence. Cutlar was so upset that he took aim and shot the pig, killing it. It turned out that the pig was owned by an Irishman, Charles Griffin, who was employed by the [[Hudson's Bay Company]] to run the sheep ranch.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodbury"/&gt; He also owned several pigs that he allowed to roam freely. The two had lived in peace until this incident. Cutlar offered $10 to Griffin to compensate for the pig, but Griffin was unsatisfied with this offer and demanded $100. Following this reply, Cutlar believed he should not have to pay for the pig because the pig had been trespassing on his land. (A probably apocryphal story claims Cutlar said to Griffin, "It was eating my potatoes." Griffin replied, "It is up to you to keep your potatoes out of my pig."&lt;ref name="Woodbury"/&gt;) When British authorities threatened to arrest Cutlar, American settlers called for [[military]] protection.

==Military escalation==
[[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[William S. Harney]], commanding the [[Department of Oregon]], initially dispatched 66 American soldiers of the [[9th Infantry Regiment (United States)|9th Infantry]] under the command of [[Captain (United States)#Captain .28Ground and Air Forces.29|Captain]] [[George Pickett]] to San Juan Island with orders to prevent the British from landing.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOV"/&gt; Concerned that a squatter population of Americans would begin to occupy San Juan Island if the Americans were not kept in check, the British sent three [[warship]]s under the command of [[Captain (Royal Navy)|Captain]] [[Geoffrey Thomas Phipps Hornby|Geoffrey Hornby]] to counter the Americans.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodbury"/&gt; Pickett was famously quoted as saying defiantly, "We'll make a [[Battle of Bunker Hill|Bunker Hill]] of it," placing him in the national limelight.&lt;ref name="Tagg"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rocemabra.com/~roger/tagg/generals/ |title=''The Generals of Gettysburg'' |author=Tagg, Larry |year=1998 |work= |publisher=Savas Publishing |accessdate=June 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141022014655/http://www.rocemabra.com/~roger/tagg/generals/ |archivedate=October 22, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The situation continued to escalate. By August 10, 1859, 461 Americans with 14 cannon under [[Colonel (United States)|Colonel]] [[Silas Casey]] were opposed by five British warships mounting 70 guns and carrying 2,140 men.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodbury"/&gt;  During this time, no shots were fired.

The governor of the [[Colony of Vancouver Island]], [[James Douglas (Governor)|James Douglas]], ordered British [[Rear admiral (Royal Navy)|Rear Admiral]] [[Robert Lambert Baynes|Robert L. Baynes]] to land [[Royal Marines|marines]] on San Juan Island and engage the American soldiers under the command of Brigadier-General Harney. (Harney's forces had occupied the island since July 27, 1859.) Baynes refused, deciding that "two great nations in a war over a squabble about a pig" was foolish.&lt;ref name="GOV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodbury"/&gt; Local commanding officers on both sides had been given essentially the same orders: defend yourselves, but absolutely do not fire the first shot. For several days, the British and U.S. soldiers exchanged insults, each side attempting to goad the other into firing the first shot, but discipline held on both sides, and thus no shots were fired.

==Resolution==
When news about the crisis reached Washington and London, officials from both nations were shocked and took action to calm the potentially explosive international incident.&lt;ref name=sajh/&gt;

In September, [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[James Buchanan]] sent General [[Winfield Scott]] to negotiate with [[James Douglas (governor)|Governor Douglas]] and resolve the growing crisis.&lt;ref name="GOV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodbury"/&gt; This was in the best interest of the United States, as sectional tensions within the country were increasing, soon to culminate in the [[American Civil War|Civil War]].&lt;ref name="Woodbury"/&gt; Scott had calmed two other border crises between the two nations in the late 1830s. He arrived in the San Juans in October and began negotiations with Douglas.&lt;ref name=sajh/&gt;

As a result of the negotiations, both sides agreed to retain joint military occupation of the island until a final settlement could be reached, reducing their presence to a token force of no more than 100 men.&lt;ref name="GOV"/&gt; The "English Camp" was established on the north end of San Juan Island along the shoreline, for ease of supply and access; and the "American Camp" was created on the south end on a high, windswept meadow, suitable for artillery barrages against shipping.&lt;ref name="Woodbury"/&gt; Today the [[Union Flag|Union Jack]] still flies above the "English Camp", being raised and lowered daily by park rangers, making it one of the few places without diplomatic status where U.S. government employees regularly hoist the flag of another country.
[[File:San Juan Island NHP Eng Camp.JPG|thumb|right|File:San Juan Island NHP Eng Camp.JPG|Union Jack at the "English Camp" in San Juan Island National Historical Park]]

During the years of joint [[military occupation]], the small British and American units on San Juan Island had an amicable mutual social life, visiting one another's camps to celebrate their respective national holidays and holding various athletic competitions. Park rangers tell visitors the biggest threat to peace on the island during these years was "the large amounts of alcohol available".

This state of affairs continued for the next 12 years. The dispute was peacefully resolved after more than a decade of confrontation and military bluster, during which time the local British authorities consistently lobbied London to seize back the [[Puget Sound region]] entirely,{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}} as the Americans were busy elsewhere with the Civil War. In 1866, the Colony of Vancouver Island was merged with the [[Colony of British Columbia (1858–66)|Colony of British Columbia]] to form an [[Colony of British Columbia (1866–71)|enlarged Colony of British Columbia]]. In 1871, the enlarged colony joined the newly formed [[Canadian Confederation|Dominion of Canada]]. That year, the United Kingdom and the United States signed the [[Treaty of Washington (1871)|Treaty of Washington]], which dealt with various differences between the two nations, including border issues involving the newly formed Dominion. Among the results of the treaty was the decision to resolve the San Juan dispute by [[international arbitration]], with German Emperor [[Wilhelm I of Germany|Wilhelm I]] chosen to act as arbitrator. Wilhelm referred the issue to a three-man arbitration commission which met in Geneva for nearly a year.&lt;ref name=sajh&gt;{{cite web |title= The Pig War |work= San Juan Island National Historical Park |publisher= [[National Park Service]] |url= http://www.nps.gov/sajh/historyculture/the-pig-war.htm |accessdate= 2009-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; On October 21, 1872, the commission decided in favor of the United States.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOV"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Woodbury"/&gt;  The arbitrator chose the American-preferred marine boundary via [[Haro Strait]], to the west of the islands, over the British preference for [[Rosario Strait]] which lay to their east.

[[File:British troops evacuate San Juan Island, Washington Terr, 1872 - Restored.jpg|thumb|British troops evacuate San Juan Island]]
On November 25, 1872, the British withdrew their [[Royal Marines]] from the British Camp.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;  The Americans followed by July 1874.&lt;ref name="Matthews"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GOV"/&gt;

Canadian politicians and public, already angry with the [[Oregon Treaty]], were once again upset that Britain had not looked after their interests, and Canada sought greater autonomy in international affairs.

The '''Procession of Silence in San Luis Potosi''' is an annual event to mourn the [[Passion of Christ]] and honor [[Our Lady of Solitude]]. It occurs on the night of [[Good Friday]], beginning at the El Carmen Church, where it originated, and winds through the streets of the historic center of the [[San Luis Potosí, San Luis Potosí|city of San Luis Potosí]]. During the event there are the sounds of drums and bugles, but no participant or spectator speaks, giving the event its name. It is one of the most important [[Holy Week in Mexico|Holy Week observances in Mexico]] and was declared part of the cultural heritage of the state of [[San Luis Potosí]] in 2013.

==The main event==
[[File:Procesion del Silencio SLP027.JPG|thumb|First brotherhood leaving the El Carmen church]]
The procession takes place on Good Friday, in the historical center of the city of San Luis Potosi, which is filled with churches and colonial era buildings.&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt; Illuminated with candles, the area has a church-like atmosphere and even though thousands of spectators line the streets, no one will speak during the hours of the procession, which gives it the name.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;&lt;ref name=realizan/&gt;&lt;ref name=ofrecen/&gt;

The main participants of the procession are the members of various religious brotherhoods, who carry and accompany large platforms with religious images through the streets.&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt; In 2013, there were thirty such brotherhoods&lt;ref name=fervor/&gt; which included the Cofradía del Virgen del Carmen, the Cofradía del  Santo Entierro, Cofradía del Descendimiento, Cofradía del Ecce Homo and the Cofradía de la Soledad, which carries an image of Our Lady of Solitude.&lt;ref name=realizan/&gt;&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt; The members of the various brotherhoods are identified by the colors of their garments, which identified their home parish and  shows the influence of the processions of Seville.  The most noticeable participants are the costaleros, which were a special tunic and pointed hoods with cloths covering the faces.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt; The brotherhoods participate as a form of penance, with faces covered and some even walking with chains attached to their ankles.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt; Other participants include adults and children in various dress which include [[altar boy]]s, Nazarenes, Our Lady of [[Macarena, Seville|Macarena]], Roman soldiers, women wearing traditional Potosi [[rebozo]]s and carrying candles, bullfighters, politicians and artists.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt;&lt;ref name=fervor/&gt;&lt;ref name=mfago&gt;{{cite web |author=Margaret Fago  |title= Holy week procession grows into  Mexico's largest such event   |publisher= Catholic Voice |location=Oakland, CA |date=May 5, 2014  |url= http://www.catholicvoiceoakland.org/2014/05-05/inthisissue19.htm |accessdate=June 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Procesion del Silencio SLP083.JPG|thumb|Women in rebozos in the procession]]
The procession begins at the El Carmen Church at exactly 8pm.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt; The sound of a [[bugle]] summons the [[Praetorian Guard]] which marches from the Teatro de la Paz to the El Carmen Church. The centurian knocks three times at the main door and the bugler on horseback clears the way and silences the crowd for the procession.&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt; The procession contains hundreds of people and begins by crossing the Plaza del Carmen in front of the church. Just this portion of the procession takes two hours.&lt;ref name=mfago/&gt; The entire event lasts over four hours and winds its way along the main streets of the historic center, passing landmarks such as the Mask Museum, the Government Palace the main city plaza and the cathedral over 3.5&amp;nbsp;km.&lt;ref name=50anos/&gt;&lt;ref name=fervor/&gt;&lt;ref name=mfago/&gt; The main focal points are the platforms carried by members of the brotherhoods, which can weigh up to 500 kilograms, which bear religious images adorned with fresh flowers.  Some of the platforms have been made by local artisans and others imported from [[Seville, Spain]].&lt;ref name=mfago/&gt; The participants walk slowly  and solemnly, with the pace measured by drumbeats.&lt;ref name=mfago/&gt; At certain points in the procession, trumpets are sounded.&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt; There are twenty three main platform, with the end of the procession marked by that dedicated to Our Lady of Solitude. This image is ornate Baroque and created by [[Manuel Tolsá]].&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt;&lt;ref name=fervor/&gt; and wears a Seville style cloak.&lt;ref name=50anos/&gt;

==The procession as part of Holy Week in San Luis Potosi==
The procession is the highlight of two weeks of activities related to Holy Week, which include those of religious, cultural and sporting nature, beginning on the Viernes de Dolores, the Friday before [[Palm Sunday]].  On this day, crowds gather on a small alley called Callejón del Buche to create altars dedicated to the Virgin Mary as [[Our Lady of Sorrows]].&lt;ref name=50anos/&gt;&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt; During the rest of the week more altars are assembled depicting the various Stations of the Cross, with some of these destined to be carried during the Good Friday procession.&lt;ref name=mfago/&gt;

[[Palm Sunday]] is marked with a simple procession to the city cathedral for the blessing of palms. On [[Maundy Thursday]], there is another procession with seven platforms that visit the various main neighborhoods of the city and their main churches.&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt; In the churches, the images of saints are covered on purple cloths as a sign of mourning, bread is distributed to remember the [[Last Supper]] and sprigs of  [[chamomile]] are blessed.&lt;ref name=mexdes/&gt;  During the day on Good Friday, the main event is a reenactment of the crucifixion in the San Juan de Guadalupe neighborhood,&lt;ref name=ofrecen/&gt; and on [[Holy Saturday]], the [[Burning of Judas]] occurs on the Plaza de los Fundadores.&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt;

The Holy Week season stretches for two weeks and various secular events are sponsored by government and private entities during this time. These include art exhibitions, concerts, conferences, guided tours and volleyball and basketball tournaments. They also include a half marathon between [[Venado]] and [[Charcas, San Luis Potosi|Charcas]] and a national youth tennis tournament.&lt;ref name=50anos/&gt;&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt;&lt;ref name=culturales&gt;{{cite news  |title= Presentan actividades culturales de Semana Santa en San Luis Potosí. Destacan la Procesión del Silencio y la Fiesta de la Luz.  |newspaper= NOTIMEX |location=Mexico City |date=February 28, 2008  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The modern event has its origins in the traditions of processions during Holy Week established in [[New Spain]] early in the colonial period, which included the hiding of the faces of participants.&lt;ref name=buenviaje/&gt; The first procession of silence was instituted by the [[Carmelites]] in [[Mexico City]].&lt;ref name=culturales/&gt;

However, this particular procession was officially established in 1954.&lt;ref name=realizan/&gt;&lt;ref name=ilam&gt;{{cite web |title=From the blog |publisher= ILAM Foundation  |url= http://www.ilam.org/index.php/es/s-o-s-patrimonio/noticias/390-procesion-del-silencio |accessdate=June 22, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At this time, bullfighters Fermín Rivera, Carmelite priest Nicolás de San José and others began a small event to enact the Stations of the Cross and pay homage to Our Lady of Solitude by the guild of bullfighters at the El Carmen church.&lt;ref name=fervor/&gt;&lt;ref name=mfago/&gt;&lt;ref name=culturales/&gt; It is based on the annual procession in Seville, Spain in honor of Our Lady of Macarena, although this version is dedicated to Our Lady of Solitude, because of the devotion of the bullfighters to this image of the Virgin Mary.&lt;ref name=fervor/&gt;

Today, it is the only procession in Mexico to include altars depicting all stations of the cross.&lt;ref name=mfago/&gt; It was declared part of the cultural heritage of the state of San Luis Potosí  in 2013 as well as the most important civic and religious event of the state.&lt;ref name=ilam/&gt; In 2014, the city paid homage to the founders of the modern event, including Fermín Rivera, María de los Ángeles Agüero Ereño, Marco Tulio Jiménez, Carlos Artolózaga Noriega and Juan Hernández Auces.&lt;ref name=homenaje/&gt;

{{Rape}}
In 2004, the incidence of rapes recorded by the police in [[Belgium]] was 28.4 per 100,000 people, according to data by [[UNODC]]; in 2008 it was 29.5 per 100,000 people.&lt;ref name="unodc1"&gt;http://www.unodc.org/documents/data-and-analysis/Crime-statistics/Sexual_violence_sv_against_children_and_rape.xls&lt;/ref&gt; Belgium has been reported as being one of the countries with the highest rate of [[rape]].&lt;ref name="ibtimes1"&gt;{{cite web|author=March 17, 2014 10:35 GMT |url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/belgium-sexual-harassment-punished-imprisonment-under-new-law-1440582 |title=Belgium: Sexual Harassment Punished With Imprisonment Under New Law |publisher=Ibtimes.co.uk |date=2012-02-16 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law==

Rape in Belgium is defined by Article 375 of the Penal Code as "any act of sexual penetration, of whatever sort and by whatever means, committed on a non-consenting person".&lt;ref name="unwomen1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=10080&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=213 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318212005/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=10080&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=213 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2014-03-18 |title=The Secretary Generals database on violence against women |publisher=Sgdatabase.unwomen.org |date= |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/loi_a1.pl?DETAIL=1867060801%2FF&amp;caller=list&amp;row_id=1&amp;numero=2&amp;rech=4&amp;cn=1867060801&amp;table_name=LOI&amp;nm=1867060850&amp;la=F&amp;dt=CODE+PENAL&amp;language=fr&amp;fr=f&amp;choix1=ET&amp;choix2=ET&amp;fromtab=loi_all&amp;trier=promulgation&amp;chercher=t&amp;sql=dt+contains++%27CODE%27%26+%27PENAL%27and+actif+%3D+%27Y%27&amp;tri=dd+AS+RANK+&amp;imgcn.x=41&amp;imgcn.y=12 |title=Loi - Wet |publisher=Ejustice.just.fgov.be |date= |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Marital rape is also illegal under this law.&lt;ref name="unwomen1"/&gt;

Apart from criminal proceedings, committing marital rape has also consequences in a [[divorce]] case. The new amendments to the Civil Code regulating marriage and divorce, that came into effect in September 2007, state that any of the spouses, following a divorce, may receive [[alimony]] if they need the money, but a spouse who has committed rape or other violent crimes against the other spouse cannot receive alimony. Article 301 reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;The court may refuse to grant the application for a alimony if the defendant proves that the applicant has committed a serious offense that rendered it impossible to continue living together. Under no circumstances will alimony be given to a spouse who was found guilty of an act referred to in '''Articles 375''', 398-400, 402, 403 or 405 of the Penal Code, committed against the person of the defendant, or an attempt to commit an act referred to in '''Articles 375''', 393, 394 or 397 of the Code against the same person.&lt;ref&gt;Text in French: "Le tribunal peut refuser de faire droit à la demande de pension si le défendeur prouve que le demandeur a commis une faute grave ayant rendu impossible la poursuite de la vie commune. En aucun cas, la pension alimentaire n'est accordée au conjoint reconnu coupable d'un fait visé aux articles 375, 398 à 400, 402, 403 ou 405 du Code pénal, commis contre la personne du défendeur, ou d'une tentative de commettre un fait visé aux articles 375, 393, 394 ou 397 du même Code contre cette même personne."[http://www.ejustice.just.fgov.be/cgi_loi/loi_a1.pl?DETAIL=1804032130%2FF&amp;caller=list&amp;row_id=1&amp;numero=11&amp;rech=14&amp;cn=1804032130&amp;table_name=LOI&amp;nm=1804032150&amp;la=F&amp;dt=CODE+CIVIL&amp;language=fr&amp;fr=f&amp;choix1=ET&amp;choix2=ET&amp;fromtab=loi_all&amp;trier=promulgation&amp;chercher=t&amp;sql=dt+contains++%27CODE%27%26+%27CIVIL%27and+actif+%3D+%27Y%27&amp;tri=dd+AS+RANK+&amp;imgcn.x=34&amp;imgcn.y=10]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Prevalence==

In 2011, Belgian Institute for the Equality of Women and Men published a report on "Women and men in Belgium", which noted that in 2008, according to police report, 87% of victims of rape (89% for collective rape) were female.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.womenlobby.org/spip.php?action=acceder_document&amp;arg=3144&amp;cle=008f9546f38740223b896ddf3b19887af14efb64&amp;file=pdf%2F2714_belgium_lr.pdf |format=PDF |title=NATIONAL ANALYSIS Belgium |publisher=womenlobby.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey, carried out by Belgian Institute and titled ''Experience of men and women in gender based violence'', included the following figures;

{| class="wikitable sortable"
! Relation || Women || Men || Total
|-
|Partner||30.8%||5.7%||17.5%
|-
|Family||27.4%||16.2%||21.5%
|-
|Acquaintance||11.3%||15.8%||13.6%
|-
|Work||17.2%||21.9%||19.7%
|-
|Unknown||13.3%||40.4%||27.7%
|}

According to ''[[De Morgen]]'', from 2009 and 2011 the number of reported rape cases increased from 3,360 to 4,038, an increase of more than 20 percent.&lt;ref name="ibtimes1"/&gt;

According to a report by ''[[De Standaard]]'', the sentences for rape is considerably lower than it is usually expected. For example, a person who had raped his 13-year-old stepdaughter was sentenced to 2.5 years. In another case, the criminal was sentenced to two years for repeated rape of two girls younger than 15; one of the victims was pregnant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Practical Ethics |url=http://blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk/2011/05/belgium-where-rapists-and-muffin-thieves-are-treated-alike/ |title=Belgium: where rapists and muffin thieves are treated alike &amp;#124; Practical Ethics |publisher=Blog.practicalethics.ox.ac.uk |date=2011-05-13 |accessdate=2014-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reading Amateur Regatta''' is a [[Rowing (sport)|rowing]] [[regatta]], on the [[River Thames]] in [[England]] which takes place at [[Reading, Berkshire|Reading]], [[Berkshire]] on the reach above [[Caversham Lock]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/berkshire/content/articles/2008/06/11/reading_amateur_regatta_feature.shtml Reading Amateur Regatta], [[BBC Radio Berkshire]], 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regatta takes place in June and attracts top crews from around the UK.&lt;ref&gt;British Rowing Almanac - All years&lt;/ref&gt; Racing takes place on the 1500-metres downstream course that stretches from [[St Mary's Island, River Thames|St Mary's Island]] until just short of [[Reading Rowing Club]] clubhouse. The  regatta takes place on Saturday and Sunday in June and its importance stems from its date, being immediately before entries close for [[Henley Royal Regatta]].

Reading Amateur Regatta was established in 1842 although it had a chequered history until the 1870s, when [[Reading Rowing Club]] was founded and revived interest in it.&lt;ref name=History&gt;[http://www.reading-amateur-regatta.org Reading Amateur Regatta - History Section]&lt;/ref&gt; Its re-establishment was also encouraged by the founding of the [[Reading Town Regatta|Reading Working Men's Regatta]] on the lower lock reach above [[Sonning Lock]] in 1877.

Another hiatus occurred after [[World War I]], but thenceforth the regatta grew from strength to strength requiring various adaptations to accommodate the entry level.&lt;ref name=History/&gt; This resulted in a review in 1999 which saw two-lane racing reintroduced on a 1500 metres course by changing from launch to bank umpiring. An ironical conclusion perhaps as in 1844 a ferryman had spent four months in [[Reading Gaol]] for attacking an umpire and tipping him into the river with a punt pole in retaliation for disqualification in the previous year's regatta.

The '''SCCA Spec Racer Ford Pro Series''' was a [[sports car racing]] series in the [[United States]]. The series existed between 1994 and 2002 the series was revived for 2010 and 2011.

==History==

===Early years===
The [[Spec Racer Ford]] was introduced in 1994 after [[Renault]] pulled out of the Spec Racer project. [[SCCA Pro Racing]] introduced the pro series soon after [[Ford]] wanted to support the Spec Racer. The first season saw fields of around 25 cars. [[David Tenney]] won the first ever Spec Racer Ford Pro Series race on July 2, 1994 at the [[Des Moines Street Circuit]]. Tenney won the race after a lengthy battle for the lead with [[Keith Scharf]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SCCA Pro Racing News|year=1994|publisher=SCCA Pro Racing Media Relations|page=1|url=http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1994-SRF.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104102949/http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1994-SRF.pdf|archivedate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The second race at [[Watkins Glen International]] marked the first win of many for [[Warren Stillwell]], who would win numerous races in Spec Racer Ford classes. Stillwell took the inaugural championship with one race left in the championship. Keith Scharf finished second in the championship followed by [[Bob Boudinot]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SCCA Pro Racing News|year=1994|publisher=SCCA Pro Racing Media Relations|page=14|url=http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1994-SRF.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104102949/http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1994-SRF.pdf|archivedate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Warrenn Stillwell repeated his championship in 1995 again taking the championship one race early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SCCA Pro Racing Results|year=1995|publisher=SCCA Pro Racing Media Relations|page=10|url=http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1995-SRF.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104101117/http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1995-SRF.pdf|archivedate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Golden Era===
For the 1996 season the fields exploded, 55 cars were entered in the first race, only 45 could start.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SCCA Pro Racing Results|year=1996|publisher=SCCA Pro Racing Media Relations|page=1|url=http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1996-SRF.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104102557/http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1996-SRF.pdf|archivedate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1994 and 1995 seasons saw only 5 races on the calendar, two races were added for 1996. Many drivers were in fact amateur racers making their pro racing debut. The sheer number of cars in combination with a street circuit resulted in 18 cars crashing at the [[Grand Prix of Minnesota]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SCCA Pro Racing Results|year=1996|publisher=SCCA Pro Racing Media Relations|page=7|url=http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1996-SRF.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104102557/http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1996-SRF.pdf|archivedate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Goughary Jr.]] won the race and went on to win the championship with [[Keith Scharf]] finishing second and Warren Stillwell finishing third in the championship.

The following season, 1997, saw nine races on the calendar including 2 double-headers. Stillwell retook the crown, winning four races. He was closely followed by [[Robert Mumm]], only 2 points made the difference in the end. The races were not very tense, only 11 lead changes throughout the season with 6 races seeing no lead changes. The sixth round of the championship at [[Heartland Park]] was an exception with 7 lead changes. There were only 0.210 seconds between the winning driver ([[Robbert Mumm]]) and the number two ([[Leo Capaldi]]), with Stillwell finishing third.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SCCA Pro Racing Results|year=1997|publisher=SCCA Pro Racing Media Relations|pages=10, 20|url=http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1997-SRF.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104101903/http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1997-SRF.pdf|archivedate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For 1998 the SCCA Pro Racing shortened the calendar to 7 races. The championship was decided in the final round. At the final round the Spec Racer Ford Pro Series supported the [[FIA GT]] World Schampionships at [[Homestead-Miami Speedway]]. Going in the final round John Strickler had scored 96 points and Stillwell 93. Qualifying was close with Strickler on [[pole position]] and Stillwell starting fourth. During the race Stillwell crashed in the 11th round and Strickler went on to win the race and the championship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=SCCA Pro Racing Results|year=1998|publisher=SCCA Pro Racing Media Relations|page=13|url=http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1998-SRF.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100104101340/http://scca.com/documents/Pro%20Racing/Archives/Spec%20Racer%20Ford/1998-SRF.pdf|archivedate=2010-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1999 saw again large fields with an average of 36 cars per race. [[Jack Willes]] decided the championship in the prefinal round at [[Watkins Glen International]]. The battle for the second place in the championship was tight. This was decided during the final round at [[Sebring International Raceway]]. With Goughary, Jr. and Tilbor competing for second place. Goughary finished third, in front of Tilbor who was fourth, thus winning the second place in the championship.

With fields still as large as before and relative rookies competing for top honors the series was still going strong into the new millennium. Stillwell decided the championship, in his signature style, one race early.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Spec Racer Ford Pro Series 2000|url=http://www.driverdb.com/standings/3442-2000/|work=DriverDB.com|accessdate=21 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  New in the top three were second placed [[Bobby Sak]] and third placed [[John Black (racing driver)|John Black]].

In its eighth season, in 2001, the series supported the [[Trans-Am Series]], [[SCCA World Challenge]] and the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|NASCAR Winston Cup Series]] at [[Sears Point Raceway]]. [[Keith Scharf]] took the title after nine rounds of racing. Stillwell was on course to win his fifth title, but he lost valuable points when he had to sit out round five. Round five was the only [[oval racing]] event on the calendar. At [[Chicago Motor Speedway]], supporting the [[ASA National Tour]], only 17 cars started the race. Scharf started from pole and won the 50 lap race, thus gaining points on championship fore runners Stillwell and Goughary Jr. who did not start the race. Scharf did not finish outside the top six and took his first title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Scharf reigns supreme in 2001 Pro Spec Racer|url=http://www.sccapro.com/srfps/01review.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030710031135/http://www.sccapro.com/srfps/01review.html|archivedate=2003-07-10|work=SCCA PRO SPEC RACER 2001 REVIEW|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stillwell retook the title in 2002, winning three races and capturing seven podium finishes out of ten races.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2002 Point Standings|url=http://www.sccapro.com/srfps/02/day/points.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031230174913/http://www.sccapro.com/srfps/02/day/points.html|archivedate=2003-12-30|work=SCCA Pro Racing|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cancellation===
For the 2003 season the series was split up in an Atlantic Tour and a Pacific Tour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Pro Racing Announces 2003 Pro Spec Racer Schedule|url=http://www.sccapro.com/srfps/news/02news25.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20030708040532/http://www.sccapro.com/srfps/news/02news25.html|archivedate=2003-07-08|work=SCCA Pro Spec Racer News|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But instead of creating a series where drivers from the whole country could compete for the title, fields were split in half. May 20, 2003 SCCA Pro Racing canceled the remainder of the Atlantic and Pacific Tours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CHECKERED FLAG FALLS ON PRO SPEC RACER SERIES|url=http://www.sccapro.com/srfps/news/03news06.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20031013035920/http://www.sccapro.com/srfps/news/03news06.html|archivedate=2003-10-13|work=SCCA PRO SPEC RACER NEWS|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Shawn Morrison (racing driver)|Shawn Morrison]] was the last driver to win a Pro Spec Racer event.

===Revival===
The Spec Racer Ford Pro Series was revived by the [[Sports Car Club of America|SCCA]] in 2010. The series was launched together with the [[SCCA Pro Formula Enterprises]]. In the new racing format every race-weekend features two races. 57 drivers entered the first race at [[Road Atlanta]]. Of the 52 drivers who started the race, [[Brian Schofield (racing driver)|Brian Schofield]] finished first with a margin of 0.145 seconds over [[Tray Ayres]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Pro Spec Racer Ford Round 1|url=http://www.sccaproracing.com/files/results/10-srf-atl-race1-.PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621115723/http://www.sccaproracing.com/files/results/10-srf-atl-race1-.PDF|archivedate=2013-06-21|work=SCCA Pro Racing|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  For the second raceweekend, at [[New Jersey Motorsports Park|Thunderbolt Raceway]], fields were drastically smaller with 18 cars on the grid. [[Scott Rettich]] took his first Pro Spec Racer win. A record low competitor count was achieved at [[Brainerd International Raceway]], only 12 drivers joined the grid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Pro Spec Racer Ford Round 8|url=http://www.sccaproracing.com/files/results/FIN-Race-Results-1-_116.PDF|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130621115749/http://www.sccaproracing.com/files/results/FIN-Race-Results-1-_116.PDF|archivedate=2013-06-21|work=SCCA Pro Racing|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; After ten races Rettich took the title with five point separating him from the number two Ayres.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SCCA Spec Racer Ford Pro Series 2010|url=http://www.driverdb.com/standings/3442-2010/|work=DriverDB.com|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series was renewed for a second season in 2011. The season would be a disappointing one from an organizer point of view. The largest field was at the [[Grand Prix de Trois-Rivières]] with 21 cars, the smallest however was just five cars at the season finale at Road Atlanta. Tray Ayres would win, what would be the last, Pro SRF race. Rettich won three races and won the championship. SRF veteran Richard Spicer won four races, but had less podium finishes, thus he finished second in the standings.

Five days after the last race of the season, SCCA Pro Racing announced that the Pro Spec Ford and the Pro Formula Enterprises would not return in 2012. The organisation stated that the series was not viable in the current economic environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pro SRF and Pro Formula Enterprises Will Not Return in 2012|url=http://sccaproracing.com/story.php?ID=2328|work=SCCA Pro Racing|accessdate=25 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9347">'''Senninha''' is a [[Brazil]]ian comic book series created by Rogério Martins and Ridaut Dias Jr., whose main character is based upon [[Formula One]] world champion [[Ayrton Senna]].

Senninha was launched in 1994 by the publisher [[Editora Abril|Abril]], some months before [[Death of Ayrton Senna|Senna's death]]. After Senna's death, the comics have become very popular and remain the leading the sales until 1999, when in the same year the comics began to be published by [[:pt:Brainstore|Brainstore]] however the series was canceled in 2000 after few issues. In 2008 the comic returned by the publisher HQM, but due to poor sales and promotion was canceled again.

All profits from licensing of the character go to the [[Instituto Ayrton Senna]].

==Characters==
[[File:Senninha 2.jpg|thumb|Senninha]]
* '''Senninha''', "little Senna," is the main character of the series, with characteristics very similar to Ayrton Senna, including unruly hair, a bulbous nose and red overalls (like the [[McLaren]] team for which Senna was best known), as well as being friendly, determined and sometimes rushed. He is eight years old. During the initial run, he wore a blue jumpsuit (like the [[Williams Grand Prix Engineering|Williams]] team that Senna was driving for at the time of the character's creation) and a simple helmet. In issue #10 his helmet became a magical character called Meu Herói.
* '''Meu Herói''', "my hero," is the magical helmet of Senninha, colored green, yellow and blue like Senna's helmet (which was predominantly yellow, with one green and one blue horizontal stripe.) To most other people it is a normal helmet and only magical entities and persons as special as Senninha (such as [[Juan Manuel Fangio]], who made a posthumous appearance in the comics in 1995) can see and hear it.
* '''Neco''' is the mechanical inventor of the group. He is of Japanese descent and the twin brother of Coni. He is eight years old. Until issue #9 he was called Nico.
* '''Gabi''' is an artist and the sensitive member of the group. She is eight years old.
* '''Becão and Bicão''' are Senninha's twin helmet-wearing sheepdogs. Becão's helmet is blue with a white band and he thinks and acts like a human. Bicão's helmet is white with a blue stripe and he acts like any other ordinary dog, making a mess wherever he goes.
* '''Johnny''' is the heartthrob of the group and good at designing racing cars. He is ten years old.
* '''Tala Larga''' is the reporter in the group, who always records the racers with his camera, and often tries to interview Senninha, of whom he is a big fan. He is eight years old. The character was inspired by [[Galvão Bueno]].
* '''Déia''' is the detective in the group. She is eight years old.
* '''Coni''' Neco's twin sister and the "economist" of the group. She is eight years old.
* '''Marcha Lenta,''' whose name means "idle", is often shown sleeping. When awake, he normally interacts with Tala, as his cameraman. He is eight years old.
* '''JJ''' is crazy about basketball and computer science, as well as a top student in his class. He is the only black character in the group. He is ten years old.
* '''Téo''' is the younger brother of Senninha and can be a brat. He often annoys Johnny, who does not like him very much. He is six years old. The character was Inspired by Ayrton Senna's younger brother Leonardo.
* '''Gigi''' is the older sister of Senninha. She loves to talk on the phone. She is thirteen years old. The character was inspired by Viviane, Ayrton Senna's older sister.
* '''Braço Duro''' is the leader of a rival gang to Senninha's group. He is always trying to win races and usually cheats. He hates losing to Senninha. He is nine years old. The character was inspired by Senna's rival Formula One drivers [[Alain Prost]] and [[Michael Schumacher]]. His name (literally "hard arm") comes from a Brazilian slang for bad drivers.
* '''Rebimboca''' is the mechanic of Braço's gang. He always copies Johnny's original ideas of cars design. He is nine years old.
* '''Bate-Pino''' has a stutter and always takes a long time to complete a sentence. He is ten years old.
* '''Pé-de-Breque''' is a big, fat member of Braço's gang and the typical dim-witted comic relief character. He is eleven years old.
* '''Tamborim''' is a purple mongrel cat and the mascot of Braço's gang.

==History==
Senninha was designed by Rogerio Martins Jr and Ridaut Days in 1994.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Billaud|first=Norbert|title=A small pilot with a big heart|url=http://www.fanaticf1.com/formule1/7328-Television-A-Senna-Video.html|publisher=Fanatic F1|date=4 October 2008|accessdate=21 August 2012|language=Portuguese|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140419205723/http://www.fanaticf1.com/formule1/7328-Television-A-Senna-Video.html|archivedate=19 April 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The pair was looking to publish the character but were low on money. They met with Ayrton Senna who suggested the design be based on himself.

The first publication was on February 27, 1994. It was published by Editora Abril and made available free to every school in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senna's World: SENNINHA|url=http://www.sennaworld.com/senninha.html|publisher=Senna World|accessdate=21 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senninha and His Crew # 4 on newsstands|url=

'''''Songs of Europe''''' is a concert television programme commemorating the [[Eurovision Song Contest]]'s twenty-fifth anniversary. The event was held in [[Mysen]], [[Norway]] in 1981, featuring nearly all the winners of the Eurovision Song Contest from its first edition in 1956 to 1981, and broadcast to more than 100 million viewers all over Europe.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The concert, which was the largest ever in Norway at the time, and still the largest in Mysen, was hosted by Norwegian television personalities [[Rolf Kirkvaag]] and [[Titten Tei]], who led the two-hour live broadcast in English, German, French, Norwegian and Spanish. Heavy rain delayed the start of the concert and interrupted some of the early performances. In the United Kingdom, a highlights programme was broadcast by [[BBC Two]] on 25 September 1981 and introduced by [[Terry Wogan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/d80d6106cc8a4d1199c991955cd18b8d|title=Songs of Europe - BBC Two England - 25 September 1981 - BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[BBC Radio 2]] transmitted the concert on 26 December 1981, introduced by [[Len Jackson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/7c8c6cb46a7d44d2932ed2739aa5d4f1|title=Songs of Europe - BBC Radio 2 - 26 December 1981 - BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk|accessdate=20 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
It is the biggest concert arranged to feature such an amount of Eurovision Song Contest artists and more specifically winners performing at once, with 21 out of a total 29 winners (four winners in the 1969 Contest) attending to perform their past winning songs; that is with the Eurovision Song Contest's fiftieth anniversary, [[Congratulations: 50 Years of the Eurovision Song Contest]], featuring most of the artists as guests and not as performers, and the Contest's sixtieth anniversary, [[Eurovision Song Contest's Greatest Hits]], featuring fifteen artists acts.

==The show==
The songs were performed and shown in videos, in accordance to the chronological order of the [[Eurovision Song Contest|Eurovision Song Contest']]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s winners from the first edition in 1956 up to and including the 1981 edition; although 1981 was the 26th edition, it was held a few months prior to the concert and thus included in it. Some snippets of earlier ESC performances intermingled into the show. 21 acts performed their winning songs live (although Dana lip-synched her winning song), including three out of the four winners of the 1969 Contest. The remaining eight winners, marked in light red, were shown in video footage of their performances in their respective editions of the Eurovision Song Contest, where available. Others were shown in still photographs or in clips taken from other broadcast where no clip from the contest was known to exist. Abba's performance of ''Waterloo'' was taken from a televised concert the group had performed in Mysen in 1975.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

The film was shot on location in [[Tasmania]] and [[Sydney]] between April and May 2008.

==Premise and title==
The film follows the final days of Irish convict and [[bushranger]] [[Alexander Pearce]]'s life as he awaits execution. In 1824 the British [[penal colony]] of [[Van Diemen's Land]] is little more than a living hell. Chained to a wall in the darkness of a cell under [[Hobart Gaol]], Pearce is visited by Father Philip Conolly, the parish priest of the fledgling colony and a fellow Irishman. Pearce wishes to tell the priest his recollection of the horrors he endured in the three months spent traversing the brutal wilderness of [[Van Diemen's Land]]. Conolly struggles to reconcile his desire to grant absolution to the convict with the story Pearce tells him. The title of the film comes from the remarkable interaction between Philip Conolly and Alexander Pearce days before Pearce is executed. ''The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce'' is presented as a psychoanalytical [[historical epic]].

The relatively underscored aspect of Pearce's crime and confessions is the murder of fellow escapees and the alleged [[human cannibalism|cannibalism]].&lt;ref&gt;see [[Alexander_Pearce#Escape and cannibalism]] for interpretations of the multiple confessions&lt;/ref&gt;

The film details the convict's relinquishing psyche as he finds himself succumbing to the inevitability of his imminent execution. For much of the film, the complex relationship between Pearce and Conolly is examined. The circumstances and motives of Pearce's execution are, too, put into question by Rowland.

==Production==
Producer and co-writer [[Nial Fulton]] began developing ''The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce'' in [[Ireland]] in 1998 and [[Filmmaking|production]] began on the project in Australia in the summer of 2006. The film was commissioned and financed by the [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], [[RTÉ]], [[BBC Northern Ireland]], [[Screen Australia]] and Screen Tasmania.

''The Last Confession of Alexander Pearce'' was inspired by the true story of an escape from the infamous [[Sarah Island (Tasmania)|Sarah Island]] penal settlement in [[Macquarie Harbour]], Van Diemen's Land in 1822 by Irish convict and bushranger [[Alexander Pearce]] and the subsequent confession he made to the Hobart priest Phillip Conolly days before he was executed for the murder of fellow convict Thomas Cox.

===Script===
Written by Michael James Rowland and [[Nial Fulton]], the script draws on all four confessions made by [[Alexander Pearce]], but principally on the confessions he made to Commandant John Cuthbertson and the final confession made to the [[priest]] Phillip Conolly. In many places the script uses the exact words written down in these confessions.

===Principal cast===
*[[Adrian Dunbar]] as Philip Connolly
*[[Ciarán McMenamin]]  as [[Alexander Pearce]]
*[[Dan Wyllie]] as Robert Greenhill
*[[Don Hany]] as John Mather
*[[Bob Franklin (comedian)|Bob Franklin]] as Matthew Travers
*[[Chris Haywood]] as Reverend [[Robert Knopwood]]

==Van Diemen's Land / Tasmania==
Shot over five weeks on location in Tasmania and Sydney in 2008, the film used locations around [[Derwent Bridge, Tasmania|Derwent Bridge]], [[Lake St Clair (Tasmania)|Lake St Clair]], [[Nelson Falls]], [[Huon Valley|the Huon Valley]], [[Mount Wellington (Tasmania)|Mount Wellington]] and [[Callan Park Hospital for the Insane|Callan Park]], a former asylum in [[Rozelle]]. Many of the filming locations were selected as they were places Alexander Pearce may have passed through on his escape from Sarah Island.

"'''The Love of Richard Nixon'''" ({{Audio|Manic Street Preachers The Love Of Richard Nixon.ogg|sample}}) is a song by [[Wales|Welsh]] [[alternative rock]] band [[Manic Street Preachers]]. It was released in 2004 by record label [[Epic Records|Epic]] as the first single from their seventh studio album, ''[[Lifeblood (album)|Lifeblood]]''.

== Content ==

The song is, according to the band, "a soundtrack to disillusion, hatred, love and never giving up".&lt;ref name="Martin Clarke 2009"&gt;Martin Clarke, ''Manic Street Preachers: Sweet Venom'' (Plexus, 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, the song is a sympathetic appraisal of former US president [[Richard Nixon]] and mentions some of his positive achievements, inevitably overshadowed by the [[Watergate Scandal]]. The timing of the single's release, two weeks before [[George W. Bush]]'s victory at the [[United States presidential election, 2004|2004 US presidential elections]], can also be seen as a statement by the band concerning the reputation of the USA's leadership at the time.&lt;ref name="Power"&gt;{{cite book |last=Power |first=Martin |title=Manic Street Preachers |date=17 October 2010 |publisher=Omnibus Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In an interview with Repeat Fanzine, the band also said it represents how they feel in comparison to [[Radiohead]]. Nicky in particular commented that they feel like [[Richard Nixon]] compared to Radiohead's [[John F. Kennedy]]: "'If Radiohead are Kennedy, then Manic Street Preachers are Nixon: the ugly duckling who had to try 10 times harder than anyone else. Paranoid megalomaniacs.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.repeatfanzine.co.uk/interviews/MSP%20with%20Simon%20Price.htm |title=An Interview |website=repeatfanzine.co.uk |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sound is more [[electronic music|electronic]] than most of their previous hits, indicative of a slight switch in sound on ''Lifeblood''; according to the band the song contains no guitars.&lt;ref name="Martin Clarke 2009"/&gt;

== Release ==

"The Love of Richard Nixon" was released on 18 October 2004&lt;ref name="Power"/&gt; by record label Epic as the first single from the band's seventh studio album, ''Lifebood''. It hit number 2 in the [[UK Singles Chart|UK charts]].&lt;ref name="UK chart"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.officialcharts.com/artist/20086/MANIC%20STREET%20PREACHERS/ |title=Manic Street Preachers|website=[[Official Charts Company|Official Charts]] |accessdate=12 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Viennese Opera Ball'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://vienneseoperaball.com/|title=Viennese Opera Ball|website=Viennese Opera Ball|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; is an annual charity gala held annually under the auspices of the United States-Austrian Chamber of Commerce. The Ball is organized by Board of Directors, under President Silvia Frieser and Artistic Director [[Daniel Serafin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://vienneseoperaball.com/performers/|title=Entertainment at the 63rd Viennese Opera Ball|date=2016-12-15|work=Viennese Opera Ball|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://t2conline.com/viennese-opera-ball-kick-offs-with-a-champagne-celebration/|title=Viennese Opera Ball Kick-Offs with a Champagne Celebration {{!}} Times Square Chronicles|website=t2conline.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dignitaries, Diplomats and Debutantes “Open” the international Ball, long regarded as one of [[New York City]]’s “greatest annual events,” garnering worldwide media coverage for over five decades.  There is nothing formulaic about the event; with four generations of guests, the Ball reflects the universal appeal of Austria’s cultural and culinary treasures.  The gala evening features Opera, Classical Music and Ballroom Dancing including, of course, Waltzing. One popular highlight is the Midnight Quadrille, conducted by a Viennese choreographer.  Following an 8 p.m. champagne reception, the Ball runs from 9:00 p.m. to 1:00 a.m., and includes a four-course dinner service. The “Tanz Bar” (post-Ball party) follows from 1:00 to 4:00 a.m. and includes a full buffet supper with the Viennese Opera Ball's Signature Goulash Soup, as well as multiple venues featuring: live dance music, a DJ and a Vienna Coffee House with Viennese pastries.

The Ball opens with the Grand March of Dignitaries and Diplomats. The ceremonial tone of the Ball Opening continues with the Presentation and Posting of the Flags by a West Point Color Guard.  The Program continues with the Presentation of [[Debutante]]s (ages 16 to 26) and their dance Escorts (ages 18–30). A choreographed [[waltz]] routine by young [[ballroom dance]] couples (ages 18–30) is followed by a call for "Alles Walzer!" (Everyone Dance!) and guests join the dancers for the first official waltz of the Ball. A Viennese Orchestra plays continuous dance music throughout the Ball, stopping only for Program highlights or performances by the featured Opera singers.

== History ==

The Viennese Opera Ball in New York takes its inspiration from the famous [[Vienna Opera Ball]] in [[Austria]], but it is an American [[501(c)(3)]] non-profit association, and independent from the Vienna Opera Ball. In February 2018 the ball celebrated its 63rd Anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theknockturnal.com/63rd-annual-viennese-opera-ball-announces-new-ziegfeld-ballroom-location-at-champagne-reception/|title=63rd Annual Viennese Opera Ball Announces New Ziegfeld Ballroom Location at Champagne Reception - The Knockturnal|date=2017-11-13|work=The Knockturnal|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ball normally takes place on the first Friday in February at the Waldorf Astoria in [[Manhattan]]. In 2018 the ball was held at the [[Ziegfeld Ballroom]] as the Waldorf Astoria is closed for renovations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://theknockturnal.com/63rd-annual-viennese-opera-ball-announces-new-ziegfeld-ballroom-location-at-champagne-reception/|title=63rd Annual Viennese Opera Ball Announces New Ziegfeld Ballroom Location at Champagne Reception - The Knockturnal|date=2017-11-13|work=The Knockturnal|access-date=2017-11-14|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered one of the few 'white-tie' balls still in existence in the United States, i.e. the gentlemen come attired in [[white tie]] and [[dress coat]]s with [[wiktionary:Decoration|decoration]]s and the ladies wear long floor-length [[ball gown]]s with decorations and [[Evening gloves|opera gloves]].

== Performances ==

Debutantes and their male partners (called Escorts) rehearse for one week prior to the ball, and they are generally selected by recommendation from Committee members each year. The choreographed Waltzers rehearse for three months prior to the ball, and they are selected from dance auditions held by the Choreographer each year. Opera singers come from the [[Metropolitan Opera]], and ballet dancers are flown over from [[Vienna]]. The Debutante procession is typically led by either the reigning [[Miss USA]] or the reigning [[Miss Universe]].

== Annual Themes ==

Each year there is a different theme: 2005 -- 'Golden Jubilee' (in honor of the 50th anniversary of both the Ball and Free Austria); 2006 -- 'Mozart,' as the night of the ball fell on what would have been [[Mozart]]'s 250th birthday; 2007 -- "Cinderella", complete with a ballet following the story of [[Cinderella]] and her night at "the ball" with [[Prince Charming]]; 2008 -- "Fairy Doll", inspired by composer [[Josef Bayer]]'s children's tale; and, 2009 -- "Masked Night at the Opera", inspired by [[Strauss]]'s "Prince Orlofsky's masked ball at his "villa" in "Die Fledermaus". Most recently in 2018, the 63rd Viennese Opera Ball commemorated the 100th anniversary of [[Gustav Klimt]]'s legacy.

{{War}}

'''War film''' is a [[film genre]] concerned with [[war]]fare, typically about [[navy|naval]], [[air force|air]], or [[army|land]] battles, with combat scenes central to the drama. It has been strongly associated with the 20th century.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=117}}&lt;ref name="Manchel1990"/&gt; The fateful nature of battle scenes means that war films often end with them.&lt;!--{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=118}}--&gt; Themes explored include combat, survival and escape, camaraderie between soldiers, sacrifice, the futility and inhumanity of battle, the effects of war on society, and the moral and human issues raised by war. War films are often categorized by their milieu, such as the Korean War; the most popular subject is the [[World War II|Second World War]]. The stories told may be [[fiction]], [[historical drama film|historical drama]], or [[biographical]]. Critics have noted similarities between the [[Western (genre)|Western]] and the war film.

Nations such as China, Indonesia, Japan, and Russia have their own traditions of war film, centred on their own revolutionary wars but taking varied forms, from action and historical drama to wartime romance.

Subgenres, not necessarily distinct, include [[anti-war film|anti-war]], comedy, [[animated film|animated]], [[propaganda]], and documentary. There are similarly subgenres of the war film in specific theatres such as the western desert (North Africa), the Pacific in the Second World War, or [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]]; and films set in specific domains of war, such as the infantry, the air, at sea, [[submarine films|in submarines]], or at [[prisoner of war]] camps.

==Genre==
{{further information|List of war films}}

The war film genre is not necessarily tightly defined: the [[American Film Institute]], for example, speaks of "films to grapple with the Great War" without attempting to classify these.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Cinema and the Great War|url=http://www.afi.com/silver/films/2014/p67/thegreatwar.aspx|publisher=AFI|accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some directors and critics have offered at least tentative definitions. The director [[Sam Fuller]] defined the [[film genre|genre]] by saying that "a war film’s objective, no matter how personal or emotional, is to make a viewer feel war."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Macnab |first1=Geoffrey |title=Fury, film review: Brad Pitt stars as an unsympathetic hero in muted war movie |url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/reviews/fury-film-review-brad-pitt-gives-intriguing-performance-as-unsympathetic-war-hero-9806584.html |publisher=The Independent |accessdate=5 March 2015 |date=20 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Belton]] identified four narrative elements of the war film within the context of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] production: a) the suspension of civilian morality during times of war, b) primacy of collective goals over individual motivations, c) rivalry between men in predominantly male groups as well as marginalization and objectification of women, and d) depiction of the reintegration of veterans.{{sfn|Belton|1994| pp=165–171}}

[[File:John Wayne in The Longest Day trailer.jpg|left|thumb|upright=1.3&lt;!--size for low-aspect-ratio image--&gt;|[[John Wayne]] in ''[[The Longest Day (film)|The Longest Day]]'', 1962]]
The film critic Stephen &lt;!--Bernard Morris--&gt;Neale suggests that the genre is for the most part well defined and uncontentious, since war films are simply those about war being waged in the 20th century, with combat scenes central to the drama. However, Neale notes, films set in the [[American Civil War]] or the American [[Indian Wars]] of the 19th century were called war films in the time before the First World War.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=117}} The critic Julian Smith argues, on the contrary, that the war film lacks the formal boundaries of a genre like the [[Western (genre)|Western]], but that in practice, "successful and influential" war films are about modern wars, in particular World War II, with the combination of mobile forces and mass killing.&lt;ref name="Manchel1990"&gt;{{cite book |last=Manchel |first=Frank |title=Film Study: An Analytical Bibliography |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BebEAji_wH4C&amp;pg=PA200 |date=January 1990 |publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press |isbn=978-0-8386-3186-7 |page=200}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film scholar Kathryn Kane&lt;ref&gt;Kane, 1982.&lt;/ref&gt; points out some similarities between the war film genre and the Western. Both genres use opposing concepts like war and peace, civilization and savagery. War films usually frame [[World War II]] as a conflict between "good" and "evil" as represented by the [[Allies of World War II|Allied forces]] and [[Nazi Germany]] whereas the Western portrays the conflict between civilized settlers and the savage indigenous peoples.&lt;ref&gt;Kane, Kathryn. "The World War II Combat Film". In: Wes D. Gehring (ed.) ''Handbook of American Film Genres''. New York: Greenwood Press, 1988, pp. 90-91, {{ISBN|978-0-313-24715-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt; James Clarke notes the similarity between a Western like [[Sam Peckinpah]]'s ''[[The Wild Bunch]]'' and "war-movie escapades" like ''[[The Dirty Dozen]]''.{{sfn|Clarke|2006|pp=9–10}}

Film historian [[Jeanine Basinger]] states that she began with a preconception of what the war film genre would be, namely that{{sfn|Basinger|1986|p=23}}

{{quote|What I knew in advance was what presumably every member of our culture would know about World War II combat films—that they contained a [[hero]], a group of mixed types [of people], and a [[military objective]] of some sort. They take place in the actual combat zones of World War II, against the established enemies, on the ground, the sea, or in the air. They contain many repeated events, such as mail call, all presented visually with appropriate [[uniform]]s, equipment, and iconography of battle.{{sfn|Basinger|1986|p=23}}}}

Further, Basinger considers ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'' to provide a definition-by-example of "the World War II combat film", in which a diverse and apparently unsuited group of "hastily assembled volunteers" hold off a much larger group of the enemy through their "bravery and tenacity".{{sfn|Eberwein|2005|pp=30–31}} She argues that the combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine kind of war film. Since she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during the Second World War, in her view these few films, central to the genre, are outweighed by the many other films that lie on the margins of being war films.{{sfn|Basinger|1986|pp=14–75}} However, other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader definition of war film, to include films that deal "with the roles of civilians, espionage agents, and soldiers in any of the aspects of war (i.e. preparation, cause, prevention, conduct, daily life, and consequences or aftermath.)"{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=117–121}} Neale points out that genres overlap, with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film, and suggests that war films are characterised by combat which "determines the fate of the principal characters". This in turn pushes combat scenes to the climactic ends of war films.{{sfn|Neale|2000|p=118}} Not all critics agree, either, that war films must be about 20th-century wars. James Clarke includes [[Edward Zwick]]'s Oscar-winning ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'' (1990) among the war films he discusses in detail; it is set in the [[American Civil War]], and he lists six other films about that war which he considers "notable".{{sfn|Clarke|2006|pp=227–237}}{{efn|Clarke's list of "notable Civil War films" is ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]]'' (1965), ''[[Gods and Generals (film)|Gods and Generals]]'' (2003), ''[[Andersonville (film)|Andersonville]]'' (1966), ''[[The Beguiled (1971 film)|The Beguiled]]'' (1971), ''[[North and South (TV miniseries)|North and South]]'' (1985), and ''[[Ride with the Devil (film)|Ride with the Devil]]'' (1999).{{sfn|Clarke|2006|p=236}}}}

The military historian [[Antony Beevor]] "despair[s]" at how film-makers from America and Britain "play fast and loose with the facts", yet imply that "their version is as good as the truth."&lt;ref name="Beevor 2018"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Beevor |first1=Antony |authorlink1=Antony Beevor |title=War films {{!}} Antony Beevor: the greatest war movie ever – and the ones I can't bear |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/may/29/antony-beevor-the-greatest-war-movie-ever-and-the-ones-i-cant-bear |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=29 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, he calls the 2000 American film ''[[U-571 (film)|U-571]]'' a "shameless deception" for pretending that a US warship had helped to win the Battle of the Atlantic—seven months before America entered the war.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2018"/&gt; He is equally critical of [[Christopher Nolan]]'s 2017 film ''[[Dunkirk (2017 film)|Dunkirk]]'' with its unhistorically empty beaches, low-level air combat over the sea, and rescues mainly by the "little ships".&lt;ref name="Beevor 2018"/&gt; Beevor feels, however, that European film-makers are often "far more scrupulous"; for example, in his view the 2004 German film ''[[Downfall (2004 film)|Downfall]]'' accurately depicted the historical events of Hitler's final days in his Berlin bunker,&lt;ref name="Beevor 2018"/&gt; and he considers the 1965 French film ''[[The 317th Platoon]]'', set in Vietnam, "the greatest war movie ever made." The 1966 film ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' is, he argues, a close second.&lt;ref name="Beevor 2018"/&gt;

==History==

===The American Civil War===
The costliest war in U.S. history in terms of American life, this war has been the subject of, or the backdrop to, numerous films, documentaries and mini-series. One of the earliest films using the Civil War as its subject was [[D.W. Griffith]]'s 1910 silent picture, ''[[The Fugitive (1910 film)|The Fugitive]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/F/Fugitive1910.html | publisher=Silent Era | title=The Fugitive | accessdate=23 June 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403134807/http://silentera.com/PSFL/data/F/Fugitive1910.html | archivedate=3 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Films that have the war as its main subject, or about a certain aspect of the war include the 1989 film, ''[[Glory (1989 film)|Glory]]'', about the first formal unit of the Union Army during the American Civil War to be made up entirely of black men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/glory-1989 | publisher=RogerEbert.com | title=Glory | accessdate=23 June 2015 | last=Ebert | first=Roger}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some films such as ''[[Gettysburg (1993 film)|Gettysburg]]'' focused on a single battle during the war,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/1993-10-09/features/1993282122_1_ted-turner-gettysburg-jeff-daniels | publisher=The Baltimore Sun | title=GETTYSBURG: Ted Turner, a cast of thousands and the ghosts of the past | accessdate=23 June 2015 | date=9 October 1993 | last=Jubera | first=Drew}}&lt;/ref&gt; or even on a single incident, like the French short film, ''[[An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge (film)|La Rivière du Hibou]]'' (''An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge'').&lt;ref name="NY Times"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/35918/An-Occurrence-at-Owl-Creek-Bridge/details |title=New York Times: An Occurrence at Owl Creek Bridge |accessdate=22 May 2008 | work=NY Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others like the 1993 miniseries ''[[North and South (miniseries)|North and South]]'' spanned the entire breadth of the war. Some films deal with the human aspects of the war, such as ''[[The Red Badge of Courage (film)|The Red Badge of Courage]]'' (1951),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/v40655 | publisher=AllMovie | title=The Red Badge of Courage: Synopsis |last=Erickson | first=Hal | accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; or ''[[Shenandoah (film)|Shenandoah]]'' (1965), on the tragedy that the war inflicted on the civilian population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/31258%7C0/Shenandoah.html | publisher=Turner Classic Movies | title=Shenandoah: article | accessdate=23 June 2015 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150623170545/http://www.tcm.com/this-month/article/31258%7C0/Shenandoah.html | archivedate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Burns]]'s ''[[The Civil War (TV series)|The Civil War]]'' is the most watched documentary in the history of [[PBS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.pbs.org/civilwar/filmmakers/ | publisher=PBS | title=The Filmmakers: Ken Burns | accessdate=23 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Spanish–American War===

The first war films come from the [[Spanish–American War]] of 1898. Short "actualities" – documentary film-clips – included ''Burial of the Maine Victims'', ''Blanket-Tossing of a New Recruit'', and ''Soldiers Washing Dishes''. These non-combat films were accompanied by "reenactments" of fighting, such as of [[Theodore Roosevelt]]'s "Rough Riders" in action against the Spanish, staged in the United States.{{sfn|Eberwein|2010|p=5}}

===The First World War===
{{further information|Fiction based on World War I}}

During the First World War, many films were made about life in the war. Topics included prisoners of war, covert operations, and military training. Both the Central Powers and the Allies produced war documentaries. The films were also used as propaganda in neutral countries like the United States. Among these was a film shot on the Eastern Front by official war photographer to the Central Powers, [[Albert K. Dawson]]: ''[[The Battle and Fall of Przemysl]]'' (1915), depicting the [[Siege of Przemyśl]], disastrous for the Austrians, with incidents reenacted using soldiers as extras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=World War I: Siege Of Przemysl |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJchHW2SXs0 |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Movies: The Battle and Fall of Przemysl (1915) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/236068/The-Battle-and-Fall-of-Przemysl/overview |accessdate=6 March 2015 |work=The New York Times |date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1915 Australian film ''[[Within Our Gates (1915 film)|Within Our Gates]]'' (also known as ''Deeds that Won Gallipoli'') by [[Frank Harvey (Australian screenwriter)|Frank Harvey]] was described by the ''Motion Picture News'' as "a really good war story, which is exceptional".&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/motionpicturenew132unse#page/1446/mode/2up/search/australia "Film News from Foreign Parts", ''Motion Picture News'' 11 March 1916] accessed 23 November 1916&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1916 British film ''[[The Battle of the Somme (film)|The Battle of the Somme]]'', by two official cinematographers, [[Geoffrey Malins]] and John McDowell, combined documentary and propaganda, seeking to give the public an impression of what [[trench warfare]] was like. Much of the film was shot on location at the Western Front in France; it had a powerful emotional impact.

{{further information|List of Spanish Civil War films}}

The [[Spanish Civil War]] has attracted directors from different countries. [[Sam Wood]]'s ''[[For Whom the Bell Tolls (film)|For Whom the Bell Tolls]]'' (1943), based on [[Ernest Hemingway]]'s [[For Whom the Bell Tolls|book of the same name]], portrays the fated romance between an American played by [[Gary Cooper]] and a partisan played by [[Ingrid Bergman]] against the backdrop of the civil war. The epic 168 minute film with its landscapes shot in Technicolor and a "beautiful" orchestral score was a success both with audiences and with critics.&lt;ref name=Harvard/&gt; [[Alain Resnais]]'s ''[[Guernica (1950 film)|Guernica]]'' (1950) uses [[Picasso]]'s  ''[[Guernica (painting)|painting]]'' to protest against war.&lt;ref name=Harvard/&gt; [[Carlos Saura]]'s ''[[La Caza]]'' (The Hunt, 1966) uses the metaphor of hunting to criticise the aggressiveness of Spanish [[fascism]].&lt;ref name=Pulver-Spanish&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pulver|first1=Andrew|title=A short history of Spanish cinema|url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/filmblog/2011/mar/29/short-history-spanish-cinema|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=11 March 2015|date=29 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It won the [[Silver Bear for Best Director]] at the [[16th Berlin International Film Festival]] in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.berlinale.de/en/archiv/jahresarchive/1966/03_preistr_ger_1966/03_Preistraeger_1966.html |title=Berlinale 1966: Prize Winners |accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ken Loach]]'s ''[[Land and Freedom]]'' (''Tierra y Libertad'', 1995), loosely based on [[George Orwell]]'s ''[[Homage to Catalonia]]'', follows a British communist through the war to reveal the painful contradictions within the anti-fascist Republican side.&lt;ref name=Harvard&gt;{{cite web |title=Franco, Fascists, and Freedom Fighters: The Spanish Civil War on Film |url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/films/2007spring/spanish.html |publisher=Harvard Film Archive|accessdate=11 March 2015 |date=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Korean War===
{{see also|Category:Korean War films}}
&lt;!--[[File:TheHook-1963-poster.jpg|thumb|left|upright''[[The Hook (1963 film)|The Hook]]'']]--&gt;

[[Samuel Fuller]]’s ''[[The Steel Helmet]]'' (1951) was made during the [[Korean War]] (1950–1953). The critic Guy Westwell notes that it questioned the conduct of the war, as did later films like ''[[The Bridges at Toko-Ri]]'' (1954) and ''[[Pork Chop Hill]]'' (1959).{{sfn|Westwell|2006|pp=51–53}} Fuller agreed that all his films were anti-war. No Hollywood films about the Korean War did well at the box office; the historian Lary May suggested in 2001 that they reminded American viewers of "the only war we have lost".&lt;ref name="WestSŏ2001"&gt;{{cite book |last1=West |first1=Philip |last2=Sŏ |first2=Chi-mun |title=Remembering the "Forgotten War": The Korean War Through Literature and Art |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ajmbslz-GacC&amp;pg=PA127 |date=1 January 2001 |publisher=M.E. Sharpe |isbn=978-0-7656-0696-9 |page=127}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1955, after the fighting, the successful [[Republic of Korea|South Korean]] action film ''[[Piagol]]''  about leftist guerrilla atrocities encouraged other film-makers. The 1960s military government punished pro-communist film-makers and gave Grand Bell Awards to films with the strongest anti-communist message. Censorship loosened in the 1980s. ''[[The Taebaek Mountains]]'' (1994) dealt with leftists from the south who fought for the communists, while ''[[Silver Stallion]]'' (1991) and ''[[Spring in My Hometown]]'' (1998) showed the destructive impact of American military presence on village life. The violent action films ''[[Shiri (film)|Shiri]]'' (1999) and ''[[Joint Security Area (film)|Joint Security Area]]'' (2000) presented North Korea in a favourable light.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Paquet, Darcy | url=http://www.koreanfilm.org/warfilms.html |title=South Korean Films About the Korean War (1950-53): A Tool for Reference | publisher=Koreanfilm.org |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Films in [[Democratic Republic of Korea|North Korea]] were made by government film studios and had clear political messages. The first was ''[[My Home Village]]'' (1949), on the liberation of Korea from the Japanese, presented as the work of [[Kim Il Sung]] without help from the Americans. Similarly, the country's films about the Korean War show victory without help from the Chinese. The film scholar Johannes Schönherr concludes that the purpose of these films is "to portray North Korea as a country under siege", and that since the U.S. and its "puppet" South Korea invaded the North once, they would do so again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Schönherr  |first = Johannes |year = 2012 |title = North Korean Cinema: A History |publisher = McFarland| location = Jefferson, N.C. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6n0itIPmakC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-786-46526-2}} [https://books.google.com/books?id=Z6n0itIPmakC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=My%20Home%20Village&amp;f=false pp. 4, 29–31]&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Algerian War===

[[Gillo Pontecorvo]]'s dramatic ''[[The Battle of Algiers]]'' (({{lang-it|La battaglia di Algeri}}; {{lang-ar|معركة الجزائر}}; {{lang-fr|La Bataille d'Alger}}), 1966) portrayed events in the [[Algerian War]] (1954–1956). It was shot on location as an Italo-Algerian co-production. It had the black and white newsreel style of [[Italian neorealism]], and even-handedly depicts violence on both sides. It won various awards including [[Golden Lion]] at the [[Venice Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=de Wilde |first1=Gervase |title=The Battle of Algiers, DVD review |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/film/6081647/The-Battle-of-Algiers-DVD-review.html |publisher=The Telegraph |accessdate=11 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was attacked by French critics and was for five years banned in France.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Matthews |first1=Peter |title=The Battle of Algiers: Bombs and Boomerangs |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/342-the-battle-of-algiers-bombs-and-boomerangs |publisher=Criterion |accessdate=11 March 2015 |date=9 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Vietnam War===
{{further information|Vietnam War in film}}
[[File:NguyenVanBe.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Viet Cong]] poster for a 1967 film about the supposed martyrdom of Nguyen Van Be]]

Few films before the late 1970s about the [[Vietnam War]] actually depicted combat.{{sfn|Neale|2000|pp=121–124}} The exceptions included ''[[The Green Berets (film)|The Green Berets]]'' (1968).{{sfn|Neale|2000|pp=121–124}} Critics such as Basinger explain that Hollywood avoided the subject because of [[opposition to United States involvement in the Vietnam War]], making the subject divisive; in addition, the film industry was in crisis, and the army did not wish to assist in making anti-war films.{{sfn|Neale|2000|pp=121–124}}{{sfn|Basinger|1986|pp=212–213}}

From the late 1970s, independently financed and produced films showed Hollywood that Vietnam could be treated in film. Successful but very different portrayals of the war in which America had been defeated included [[Michael Cimino]]'s ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1978), and [[Francis Ford Coppola]]'s ''[[Apocalypse Now]]'' (1979).{{sfn|Neale|2000|pp=121–124}} &lt;!--both films won Oscars, would need refs for that--&gt; With the shift in American politics to the right in the 1980s, military success could again be shown in films such as [[Oliver Stone]]'s ''[[Platoon (film)|Platoon]]'' (1986), [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Full Metal Jacket]]'' (1987) and [[John Irvin]]'s ''[[Hamburger Hill]]'' (1987).{{sfn|Neale|2000|pp=121–124}}

The Vietnamese director {{ill|Nguyễn Hồng Sến|vi}}'s ''[[The Abandoned Field: Free Fire Zone]]'' (''Cánh đồng hoang'', 1979) gives an "unnerving and compelling .. subjective-camera-eye-view" of life under helicopter fire in the [[Mekong Delta]] during the Vietnam War. The film cuts to an (American) "helicopter-eye view", contrasting painfully with the human tenderness seen earlier.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Abandoned Field-Free Fire Zone (Canh dong hoang) |url=http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN7762 |publisher=University of California, Berkeley Art Museum &amp; Pacific Film Archive |accessdate=10 March 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172423/http://www.bampfa.berkeley.edu/film/FN7762# |archive-date=2015-04-02 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Bosnian War===

Dino Mustafić's ''[[Remake (2003 film)|Remake]]'' (2003), written by [[Zlatko Topčić]], tells the parallel [[Coming-of-age story|coming-of-age]] stories of a father living in [[Sarajevo]] during [[World War II]] and his son living through the [[Siege of Sarajevo]] during the [[Bosnian War]]. According to Topčić, the story is based on incidents from his own life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kviff.com/en/programme/film/03118-remake/ |title=KVIFF programme - Remake |publisher=Kviff |accessdate=25 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cleveland"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.clevelandfilm.org/films/2004/remake |title=CIFF: "Remake" |publisher=Cleveland Film |accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first popular [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] war films made during the [[Second World War]] came from [[United Kingdom|Britain]] and combined the functions of [[documentary film|documentary]] and propaganda. Films such as ''[[The Lion Has Wings]]'' and ''[[Target for Tonight]]'' were made under the control of the Films Division of the Ministry of Information. The [[Cinema of the United Kingdom|British film industry]] began to combine documentary techniques with fictional stories in films like [[Noël Coward]] and [[David Lean]]'s ''[[In Which We Serve]]'' (1942) – "the most successful British film of the war years",{{sfn|Murphy|2005|p=64}} ''[[Millions Like Us]]'' (1943), and ''[[The Way Ahead]]'' (1944).&lt;ref name="Swann1989"&gt;{{cite book |last=Swann |first=Paul |title=The British Documentary Film Movement, 1926-1946 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JAV80f4DohgC |year=1989 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-33479-2 |pages=viii, 150–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In America, documentaries were produced in various ways: General Marshall commissioned the ''[[Why We Fight]]'' propaganda series from Frank Capra; the War Department's Information-Education Division started out making training films for the U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy; the Army made its own through the U.S. Signal Corps, including [[John Huston]]'s ''[[The Battle of San Pietro]]''.&lt;ref name="Manning2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Manning |first=Martin J. |title=Historical Dictionary of American Propaganda |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=1-JjwDPcOLQC&amp;pg=PA86 |year=2004 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-29605-5 |pages=86–87}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] made films with propaganda messages about America's allies, such as ''[[Mrs. Miniver]]'' (1942), which portrayed a British family on the home front;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Mrs. Miniver (1942) |work=The New York Times |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/33719/Mrs-Miniver/overview |accessdate=7 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Edge of Darkness (1943 film)|Edge of Darkness]]'' (1943) showed Norwegian resistance fighters,&lt;ref&gt;{{tcmdb title|id=2891|title=Edge of Darkness}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[The North Star (1943 film)|The North Star]]'' (1943) showed the [[Soviet Union]] and its [[Communist Party]].&lt;ref&gt;{{tcmdb title|id=85227|title=The North Star}}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of the war popular books provided higher quality and more serious stories for films such as ''[[Guadalcanal Diary (film)|Guadalcanal Diary]]'' (1943),&lt;ref&gt;{{tcmdb title|id=77030|title=Guadalcanal Diary}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Mervyn LeRoy]]'s ''[[Thirty Seconds Over Tokyo]]'' (1944),{{sfn|Orriss|1984|pp=93–100}} and [[John Ford]]'s ''[[They Were Expendable]]'' (1945).&lt;ref&gt;{{tcmdb title|2070|They Were Expendable}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russians, too, appreciated the propaganda value of film, to publicise both victories and German atrocities. Ilya Kopalin's documentary ''[[Moscow Strikes Back]]'' ({{lang-ru|Разгром немецких войск под Москвой}}, literally "The rout of the German troops near Moscow"), was made during the [[Battle of Moscow]] between October 1941 and January 1942. It depicted civilians helping to defend the city, the parade in [[Red Square]] and [[Stalin]]'s speech rousing the Russian people to battle, actual fighting, Germans surrendering and dead, and atrocities including murdered children and hanged civilians. It won an Academy Award in 1943 for best documentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Moscow Strikes Back |url=https://archive.org/details/MoscowStrikesBack |publisher=Artkino Pictures |accessdate=17 March 2015 |date=1942}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1942&gt;{{cite web|last1="T.S." |title=Movie Review: Moscow Strikes Back (1942) 'Moscow Strikes Back,' Front-Line Camera Men's Story of Russian Attack, Is Seen at the Globe |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501E0D7113CE33BBC4F52DFBE668389659EDE |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=18 March 2015 |date=17 August 1942}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newsreel cameras were similarly rushed to [[Stalingrad]] early in 1943 to record "the spectacle which greeted the Russian soldiers" – the starvation of Russian prisoners of war in the Voropovono camp by the [[6th Army (Wehrmacht)|German Sixth Army]], defeated in the [[Battle of Stalingrad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Beevor |first1=Antony |title=Stalingrad |year=1999 |origyear=1998 |publisher=Penguin |isbn=0-140-24985-0 |pages=350–351}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Feature films made in the west during the war were subject to censorship and were not always&lt;!--qua, hardly ever--&gt; realistic. One of the first to attempt to represent violence, and which was praised at the time for "gritty realism", was [[Tay Garnett]]'s ''[[Bataan (film)|Bataan]]'' (1943). The depiction actually remained stylised: Jeanine Basinger gives as an example the "worst image for stark violence" when a Japanese soldier beheads an American: the victim shows pain and his lips freeze in a scream, yet no blood spurts and his head does not fall off. Basinger points out that while this is physically unrealistic, psychologically it may not have been. The wartime audience was, she points out, well aware of friends and relatives who had been killed or who had come home wounded.&lt;ref name=AHA-Basinger&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Basinger |first1=Jeanine |title=Translating War: The Combat Film Genre and Saving Private Ryan |journal=Perspectives on History|url=http://www.historians.org/publications-and-directories/perspectives-on-history/october-1998/translating-war-the-combat-film-genre-and-saving-private-ryan |date=1998 |publisher=American Historical Association |accessdate=7 March 2015 |issue=October 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Films made by the Axis powers===

The studio made propaganda films such as ''[[Triumph des Willens]]'' (1935) and ''[[Kolberg (film)|Kolberg]]'' (1945).]]

The [[Axis powers]] similarly made films during the Second World War, for propaganda and other purposes. In Germany, the [[Oberkommando des Heeres|army high command]] brought out ''[[Sieg im Westen]]'' ("Victory in the West", 1941).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Herzstein |first1=Robert E | title=The War that Hitler Won |date=1979 | publisher=Hamish Hamilton |isbn=0-399-11845-4 |page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Nazi propaganda films had varied subjects, as with ''[[Kolberg (film)|Kolberg]]'' (1945), which depicts stubborn [[Prussia]]n resistance in the [[Siege of Kolberg (1807)]] to the invading French troops under [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Kolberg |url=http://www.filmportal.de/en/movie/kolberg_ea43d4a739775006e03053d50b37753d |publisher=FilmPortal.de |accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The propaganda minister [[Joseph Goebbels]] chose the historical subject as suitable for the worsening situation facing Nazi Germany when it was filmed from October 1943 to August 1944. At over eight million marks, using thousands of soldiers as extras and 100 railway wagonloads of salt to simulate snow, it was the most costly German film made during the war. The actual siege ended with the surrender of the town; in the film, the French generals abandon the siege.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Leiser |first1=Erwin |title=Nazi Cinema |date=1974 |publisher=Macmillan |isbn=0-02-570230-0 |pages=122–129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For Japan, the war began with the [[Second Sino-Japanese War|undeclared war and invasion of China in 1937]], which the Japanese authorities called "The China Incident". The government dispatched a "pen brigade" to write and film the action in China with "humanist values". [[Tomotaka Tasaka]]'s ''[[Mud and Soldiers]]'' (1939) for instance, shot on location in China, [[Kōzaburō Yoshimura]]'s ''[[Legend of Tank Commander Nishizumi]]'', and [[Sato Takeshi]]'s ''[[Chocolate and Soldiers]]'' (1938) show the common Japanese soldier as an individual and as a family man, and even enemy Chinese soldiers are presented as individuals, sometimes fighting bravely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=High  |first=Peter B  |year=2003 |title=The Imperial Screen: Japanese Film Culture in the Fifteen Years' War, 1931-1945 |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press| location=Madison |isbn=0-299-18130-8 |ref=harv}} esp.

Dower|John Dower]] found that Japanese wartime films had been largely forgotten, as "losers do not get reruns", yet they were so subtle and skilful that Frank Capra thought ''Chocolate and Soldiers'' unbeatable. Heroes were typically low-ranking officers, not [[samurai]], calmly devoted to his men and his country.{{sfn|Dower|1993|p=48}} These films did not personalise the enemy and therefore lacked hatred, though Great Britain could figure as the "cultural enemy". For Japanese film-makers, war was not a cause but more like a natural disaster, and "what mattered was not whom one fought but how well". Asian enemies, especially the Chinese, were often portrayed as redeemable and even possible marriage partners. Japanese wartime films do not glorify war, but present the Japanese state as one great family and the Japanese people as an "innocent, suffering, self-sacrificing people". Dower comments that the perversity of this image "is obvious: it is devoid of any recognition that, at every level, the Japanese also victimized others."{{sfn|Dower|1993|p=49}}

By the end of the decade the " sense of shared achievement" which had been common in war films "began to evaporate", according to Pulver.&lt;ref name=Pulver/&gt;

[[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films in the 1950s and 1960s could display spectacular heroics or self-sacrifice, as in the popular ''[[Sands of Iwo Jima]]'' (1949) starring [[John Wayne]]. U.S. Marines considered ''Sands of Iwo Jima'' visually authentic, but found Lewis Milestone's ''[[Battle Cry (film)|Battle Cry]]'' (1955), with its attention to the lives of the men, the more realistic film.{{sfn|Suid|2002|pp=116–135}} The formula for a successful war film consisted, according to Lawrence Suid, of a small group of ethnically diverse men; an unreasonable senior officer; cowards became heroic, or died.{{sfn|Suid|2002|pp=116–135}} Jeanine Basinger suggests that a traditional war film should have a hero, a group, and an objective, and that the group should contain "an Italian, a Jew, a cynical complainer from Brooklyn, a sharpshooter from the mountains, a midwesterner (nicknamed by his state, "Iowa" or "Dakota"), and a character who must be initiated in some way".&lt;ref name=AHA-Basinger/&gt; Films based on real [[commando]] missions, like [[Gift Horse (film)|''The Gift Horse'']] (1952) based on the [[St. Nazaire Raid]], and ''[[Ill Met by Moonlight (film)|Ill Met by Moonlight]]'' (1956) based on the capture of the German commander of Crete, inspired fictional adventure films such as ''[[The Guns of Navarone (film)|The Guns of Navarone]]'' (1961), ''[[The Train (1964 film)|The Train]]'' (1964) and ''[[Where Eagles Dare]]'' (1968).

[[Darryl F.

In Lawrence Suid's view, ''The Longest Day'' "served as the model for all subsequent combat spectaculars".{{sfn|Suid|2002|pp=188–189}} However, its cost also made it the last of the traditional war films, while the controversy around the help given by the U.S. Army and Zanuck's "disregard for Pentagon relations" changed the way that Hollywood and the Army collaborated.{{sfn|Suid|2002|pp=188–189}}

Zanuck, by then an executive at [[20th Century Fox]], set up an American-Japanese co-production for [[Richard Fleischer]]'s ''[[Tora! Tora!

The story was revisited in ''[[Pearl Harbor (film)|Pearl Harbor]]'' (2001), described by ''The New York Times'' as a "noisy, expensive and very long new blockbuster", with the comment that "for all its epic pretensions (as if epic were a matter of running time, tumescent music and earnest voice-over pronouncements), the movie works best as a bang-and-boom action picture".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Scott |first1=A.

[[Steven Spielberg]]'s ''[[Saving Private Ryan]]'' (1998) uses hand-held camera, sound design, staging and increased audio-visual detail to defamiliarise viewers accustomed to conventional combat films, so as to create what film historian Stuart Bender calls "reported realism", whether or not the portrayal is genuinely more realistic.{{sfn|Bender|2013|p=ix}} Jeanine Basinger notes that critics experienced it as "groundbreaking and anti-generic", with, in James Wolcott's words, a "desire to bury the cornball, recruiting poster legend of John Wayne: to get it right this time"; and that combat films have always been "grounded in the need to help an audience understand and accept war".&lt;ref name=AHA-Basinger/&gt; Its success revived interest in World War II films.&lt;ref name="Stein2004"&gt;{{cite book |last=Stein |first=Howard F. |title=Beneath the Crust of Culture: Psychoanalytic Anthropology and the Cultural Unconscious in American Life |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mTxfvLvjeGEC&amp;pg=PA6 |year=2004 |publisher=Rodopi |isbn=90-420-0818-0 |page=6 |quote="Chris Vognar writes&lt;!--2002--&gt;: Saving Private Ryan wasn't just a great movie: it was also the cultural touchstone for the country's revived interest in World War II."}}&lt;/ref&gt; Others tried to portray the reality of the war, as in  [[Joseph Vilsmaier]]'s ''[[Stalingrad (1993 film)|Stalingrad]]'' (1993), which ''The New York Times'' said "goes about as far as a movie can go in depicting modern warfare as a stomach-turning form of mass slaughter."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holden |first1=Stephen |title=Stalingrad (1992) FILM REVIEW; In War's Horrors, Chaos May Rank With Carnage |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=990CE5DA163EF937A15756C0A963958260 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=8 March 2015 |date=24 May 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many war films have been produced with the cooperation of a nation's military forces. Since the Second World War, the [[United States Navy]] has provided ships and technical guidance for films such as ''[[Top Gun]]''. The [[U.S. Air Force]] assisted with ''[[The Big Lift]]'', ''[[Strategic Air Command (film)|Strategic Air Command]]'' and ''[[A Gathering of Eagles]]'', which were filmed on Air Force bases; Air Force personnel appeared in many roles.{{sfn|Suid|2015|pp=161–209}} Critics have argued that the film ''Pearl Harbor'''s US-biased portrayal of events is a compensation for technical assistance received from the US armed forces, noting that the premiere was held on board a U.S. Navy carrier.{{sfn|Rayner|2007|pp=1–2}} In another case, the U.S. Navy objected to elements of ''[[Crimson Tide (film)|Crimson Tide]]'', especially mutiny on board an American naval vessel, so the film was produced without their assistance.{{sfn|Suid|2002|p=609}} The film historian Jonathan Rayner observes that such films "have also clearly been intended to serve vital propagandist, recruitment and public relations functions".{{sfn|Rayner|2007|pp=1–2}}

==National traditions==

===Chinese===

The first Chinese war films were newsreels like ''[[Battle of Wuhan (1911 film)|Battle of Wuhan]]'' (1911) and ''[[Battle of Shanghai (1913 film)|Battle of Shanghai]]'' (1913). Still in films such as [[Xu Xinfu]]'s ''[[Battle Exploits]]'' (1925), war featured mainly as background. Only with the Second Sino–Japanese War from 1937 onwards did war film become a serious genre in China, with nationalistic films such as [[Shi Dongshan]]'s ''[[Protect Our Land]]'' (1938) The Chinese Civil War, too, attracted films such as [[Cheng Yin]]'s ''[[From Victory to Victory]]'' (1952). A more humanistic film set in the same period is [[Xie Jin]]'s The Cradle (1979), while more recent large-scale commercial films include [[Lu Chuan]]'s ''[[City of Life and Death]]'' (2009).&lt;ref name="YeZhu2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ye |first1=Tan |last2=Zhu |first2=Yun |title=Historical Dictionary of Chinese Cinema |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=javqwyBe0WoC&amp;pg=PA168 |year=2012 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=978-0-8108-6779-6 |pages=168–169}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese directors have repeatedly attempted to cover the atrocities committed by the Japanese during the [[Nanking massacre]] (1937–1938), with films such as the political melodrama ''[[Massacre in Nanjing]]'', [[Mou Tun Fei]]'s [[docudrama]] ''[[Black Sun: The Nanking Massacre]]'', and the "contrived Sino–Japanese romance" ''[[Don't Cry, Nanking]]''.&lt;ref name="Li"&gt;{{cite book |last=Li |first=Peter |title=Japanese War Crimes: The Search for Justice |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2J0ZqRZw-QQC&amp;pg=PA222 |publisher=Transaction Publishers |isbn=978-1-4128-2683-9 |pages=204–223}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Zhang Yimou]]'s epic Chinese film ''[[Flowers of War]]'' (2011), based on [[Geling Yan]]'s novel, portrays the violent events through the eyes of a 13-year-old girl.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web &lt;!--|last=Pollard |first=Lawrence--&gt;|title=The story behind Chinese war epic The Flowers of War |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-16638897 |publisher=BBC |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many [[Indonesian cinema|Indonesian films]] deal with the occupation of the archipelago by the Japanese during the Second World War. [[Teguh Karya]]'s ''[[Doea Tanda Mata]]'' (''Mementos'', literally "Two Eye Marks", 1985) covers the limited nationalist resistance to Dutch colonial rule in the 1930s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Doea Tanda Mata (1986) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/120596/Doea-Tanda-Mata/overview |publisher=New York Times|accessdate=13 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Heider|1991|pp=99–107}}  A third group of films such as ''[[Enam Djam di Jogja]]'' (''Six Hours in Yogyakarta'', 1951) and ''[[Serangan Fajar]]'' (''Attack at Dawn'', 1983) covers the [[Indonesian National Revolution|Indonesian war of independence]] (1945–1949).&lt;!--actually, these two both deal with the 1 March general assault--&gt; Two other films about the same period portray the Indonesian equivalent of the Chinese [[Long March]]: [[Usmar Ismail]]'s ''[[Darah dan Doa]]'' (''The Long March'', literally "Blood and Prayer", 1950) and ''[[Mereka Kembali]]'' (''They Return'', 1975). Each of these films interprets the past from the perspective of its own time.{{sfn|Heider|1991|pp=99–107}}

The more recent ''Merdeka'' (Freedom) trilogy (2009–2011), starting with ''[[Merah Putih (2009 film)|Merah Putih]]'' ("Red and White", the colours of the flag of the new Indonesia), revisits the campaign for independence through the lives of a diverse group of cadets who become guerillas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Parrot |first1=John |title=Review: Red and White (Merah Putih) |url=http://thefilmreview.com/reviews/review-red-white-merah-putih.html |publisher=The Film Review |accessdate=11 March 2015 |date=9 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Karya's ''[[November 1828]]'' (1979) looks at Indonesia's struggle for independence through [[historical drama]] about the [[Java War|Java or Diponegoro War]] (1825–1830), though the colonial enemy was the same, the [[Dutch East Indies|Dutch]]. Deanne Schultz considered it "a valuable interpretation" of [[Indonesian history]] that "embodies the best of popular Indonesian cinema." It was the first Indonesian film to become well-known internationally.{{sfn|Schultz|2007|p=133}}

The wartime authorities in both Britain and America produced a wide variety of [[documentary]] films. Their purposes included military training, advice to civilians, and encouragement to maintain security. Since these films often carried messages, they grade into propaganda. Similarly, commercially produced films often combined information, support for the war effort, and a degree of propaganda.&lt;ref name="Swann1989" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Manning2004" /&gt; [[Newsreels]], ostensibly simply for information, were made in both Allied and Axis countries, and were often dramatised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Art of Wartime Newsreels – 1940 through 1946 |url=http://1940s.org/the-art-of-wartime-newreels-1940-through-1946 |publisher=1940s.org |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=German Wartime Newsreels (Die Deutsche Wochenschau) |url=http://ihffilm.com/gerwarnew.html |publisher=International Historic Films |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wartime Newsreel British News Now Online|url=http://bufvc.ac.uk/2012/05/04/british-news|publisher=British Universities Film &amp; Video Council|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, in the [[Iran–Iraq War]], [[Morteza Avini]]'s ''[[Ravayat-e Fath]]'' (Chronicles of Victory) television series combined front-line footage with commentary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Rastegar |first1=Kamran |title=Surviving Images: Cinema, War, and Cultural Memory in the Middle East |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-939017-5 |page=213}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the Second World War, [[propaganda film|film propaganda]] was widely used. [[Kenneth Clark]] advised the British government that "If we renounced interest in entertainment as such, we might be deprived of a valuable weapon for getting across our propaganda"; he suggested using documentaries about the war and the war effort; celebrations of Britishness; and films about British life and character. [[Michael Powell]] and Clark agreed on a story about survivors of a [[U-boat]] crew, imbued with brutal Nazi ideology, travelling across Canada and meeting various kind, tolerant and intelligent Canadians, to encourage America into the war. The resulting film, ''[[49th Parallel (film)|49th Parallel]]'' (1941), became the top film at British offices that year.{{sfn|Murphy|2005|pp=61–62}} Entertaining films could carry messages about the need for vigilance, too, as in ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942) or the avoidance of "careless talk", as in ''[[The Next of Kin]]'' (1942).&lt;ref name="Swann1989"/&gt;

[[File:CasablancaPoster-Gold.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|The romantic drama ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1943) was used to vilify Nazism.]]
In America, [[Charlie Chaplin]]'s ''[[The Great Dictator]]'' (1940) clearly satirised [[fascism]].&lt;ref name=HMM&gt;{{cite web |title=World War II Movies - Propaganda and Patriotism |url=http://www.hollywoodmoviememories.com/articles/war-articles/world-war-ii-movies-propaganda.php |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Curtiz]]'s ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' (1943) was not simply a romance between the characters played by [[Humphrey Bogart]] and [[Ingrid Bergman]], but vilified the [[Nazi]]s and glorified resistance to them.&lt;ref name=HMM/&gt; Frank Capra's ''[[Why We Fight]]'' series (1942–1945) won the 1942 Academy Award for best documentary, though it was designed to "influence opinion in the U.S. military".&lt;ref name="Manning2004"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=German | first=Kathleen | title=Frank Capra's Why We Fight Series and the American Audience | journal=Western Journal of Speech Communication | volume=54 | issue=2 | year=1990 | pages=237–48 | doi=10.1080/10570319009374338}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the [[Cold War]], "propaganda played as much of a role in the United States' struggle with the Soviet Union as did the billions of dollars spent on weaponry." ''[[Face to Face with Communism]]'' (1951) dramatised an imagined invasion of the United States; other films portrayed threats such as communist indoctrination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Fort Devens Collection |url=http://hcl.harvard.edu/hfa/collections/fort_devens.html |publisher=Harvard Film Archive |accessdate=12 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main article|Submarine films}}

[[Submarine films]] have their own particular meanings and conventions, concerned specifically with giving the effect of [[submarine warfare]]. A distinctive element in this subgenre is the [[soundtrack]], which attempts to bring home the emotional and dramatic nature of conflict under the sea. For example, in [[Wolfgang Petersen]]'s 1981 ''[[Das Boot]]'', the sound design works together with the hours-long film format to depict lengthy pursuit with [[depth charge]]s, the ping of [[sonar]], and threatening sounds such as of the [[propellor]]s of enemy [[destroyer]]s and [[torpedo]]es.&lt;ref name=Koldau&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koldau |first1=Linda Maria |title=Sound effects as a genre-defining factor in submarine films|journal=MedieKultur |date=2010 |volume=48 |pages=18–30 |url=http://ojs.statsbiblioteket.dk/index.php/mediekultur/article/viewFile/2117/2393}}&lt;/ref&gt; Classic films in the genre include ''[[The Enemy Below]]'' (1957)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Duel to the Death |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9501EFD91131E63ABC4E51DFB467838C649EDE |publisher=[[New York Times]] |accessdate=8 March 2015 |date=26 December 1957}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Run Silent, Run Deep (1958 film)|Run Silent, Run Deep]]'' (1958), both based on novels by naval commanders. ''Run Silent, Run Deep'' is a movie full of tension, both with the enemy and between the contrasting personalities of the submarine Commander and his Lieutenant, played by [[Clark Gable]] and [[Burt Lancaster]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crowther |first1=Bosley |title=Run Silent Run Deep (1958) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=9E01E7D6113FE43BBC4051DFB5668383649EDE |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=8 March 2015 |date=28 March 1958}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Model Stalag Luft III.jpg|thumb|Model of [[Stalag Luft III]] used in filming ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963)]]

A popular subgenre of war films in the 1950s and 1960s was the [[prisoner of war]] film.&lt;ref name=BFI-Wigley&gt;{{cite web |last1=Wigley |first1=Samuel |title=10 great prisoner-of-war films |url=http://www.bfi.org.uk/news-opinion/news-bfi/lists/10-great-prisoner-war-films |publisher=British Film Institute |accessdate=6 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The genre was popularised in [[United Kingdom|Britain]] with major films like [[Guy Hamilton]]'s ''[[The Colditz Story]]'' (1955) and [[John Sturges]]'s ''[[The Great Escape (film)|The Great Escape]]'' (1963).&lt;ref name=BFI-Wigley/&gt; They told stories of real escapes from [[Germany|German]] prisoner of war camps such as [[Stalag Luft III]] in the Second World War. Despite episodes of danger and human tragedy, these films delight in a continual boyish game of escape and ingenuity, celebrating the courage and the defiant spirit of the prisoners of war, and treating war as fun.&lt;ref name=BFI-Wigley/&gt; [[David Lean]]'s ''[[Bridge on the River Kwai]]'' (1957) was judged best picture at the Oscars; it took the genre from chilly German prisons to the heat of a camp in Thailand. It was the first, too, to use lush colour to bring out the British [[stiff upper lip]] of the colonel, played by [[Alec Guinness]] in an Oscar-winning performance.&lt;ref name=BFI-Wigley/&gt; The "definitive" Oscar-winning prisoner of war film was [[Billy Wilder]]'s ''[[Stalag 17]]'' (1953), while the brief but powerful prison camp scenes of ''[[The Deer Hunter]]'' (1977) lend an air of tragedy to the whole of that film.&lt;ref name=BFI-Wigley/&gt;

British cinema in the Second World War marked the evacuation of children from London with social comedies such as ''[[Those Kids from Town]]'' (1942) where the evacuees go to stay with an [[earl]] (a country nobleman), while in ''[[Cottage to Let]]'' (1941) and ''[[Went the Day Well?]]'' (1942) the English countryside is thick with spies.{{sfn|Murphy|2005|pp=34–35}} ''[[Gasbags]]'' (1941) offered "zany, irreverent, knockabout" comedy making fun of everything from [[barrage balloon]]s to [[concentration camp]]s.{{sfn|Murphy|2005|p=41}} [[Abbott and Costello]]'s ''[[Buck Privates]]'' was successful in America,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1="T.S."|title=Buck Privates (1941)|url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/7352/Buck-Privates/overview|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; leading to many further wartime comedies.{{sfn|Erickson|2012|pp=''passim''}}

Japanese [[anime]] films from the 1960s onwards addressed national memories of war.

===Anti-war===
[[File:All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film) poster.jpg|thumb|upright=0.6|Anti-war: [[Lewis Milestone]]'s  ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'', 1930]]
{{further information|List of anti-war films}}

The anti-war genre began with films about the First World War. Films in the genre are typically revisionist, reflecting on past events and often generically blended. [[Lewis Milestone]]'s ''[[All Quiet on the Western Front (1930 film)|All Quiet on the Western Front]]'' (1930) was unquestionably powerful, and an early anti-war film, portraying a German point of view; it was the first film (in any genre) to win two Oscars, best picture and best director.&lt;ref name=BFI-Thrift/&gt; Andrew Kelly, analysing ''All Quiet on the Western Front'', defined the genre as showing: the brutality of war; the amount of human suffering; the betrayal of men's trust by incompetent officers. War and anti-war films often prove difficult to categorize as they contain many generic ambiguities.&lt;ref name="Neale2000"&gt;{{cite book |author=Stephen Neale |title=Genre and Hollywood |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vFPadW736NUC&amp;pg=PA117 |date=January 2000 |publisher=Psychology Press |isbn=978-0-415-02606-2 |page=117}}&lt;/ref&gt; While many anti-war films criticize war directly through depictions of grisly combat in past wars, some films such as Penn's [[Alice's Restaurant (film)|Alice's Restaurant]] criticized war obliquely by poking fun at such things as the draft board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Paris |first1=Michael |title=The American Film Industry &amp; Vietnam |url=http://www.historytoday.com/michael-paris/american-film-industry-vietnam |journal=History Today |volume=37 |issue=4 |date=4 April 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of anti-war films produced in America dipped sharply during the 1950s because of [[McCarthyism]] and the [[Hollywood blacklist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Film Criticism, the Cold War, and the Blacklist | jstor=10.1525/j.ctt6wqb6x | author=Smith, Jeff | publisher=University of California Press | year=2014 | isbn=978-0-520-95851-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the blacklist and the introduction of the MPAA rating system marked a time of resurgence for films of all type including anti-war films in the States. Robert Eberwein names two films as anti-war classics: [[Jean Renoir]]'s  prisoner of war masterpiece&lt;ref name=BFI-Thrift/&gt; ''[[Grand Illusion (film)|La Grande Illusion]]'' (''The Grand Illusion'', 1937), and [[Stanley Kubrick]]'s ''[[Paths of Glory]]'' (1957).{{sfn|Eberwein|2005|p=4}} The critic [[David Ehrenstein]] notes that ''Paths of Glory'' established Kubrick as the "leading commercial filmmaker of his generation" and a world-class talent. Ehrenstein describes the film as an "outwardly cool/inwardly passionate protest drama about a disastrous French army maneuver and the [[court-martial]] held in its wake", contrasting it with the "classic" ''All Quiet on the Western Front'''s story of an innocent "unstrung by the horrors of war".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ehrenstein |first1=David |title=Paths of Glory |url=http://www.criterion.com/current/posts/812-paths-of-glory |publisher=The Criterion Collection |date=25 June 1989 |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mixed genres===
Some later war films combined [[black comedy]] and anti-war sentiment, as in the anti-war farces of [[Mike Nichols]]'s ''[[Catch-22 (film)|Catch-22]]'' (1970), based on [[Joseph Heller]]'s [[Catch-22|satirical novel]] about the Second World War, and [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[MASH (film)|MASH]]'' (1970), set in Korea, reflecting the attitudes of an increasingly sceptical public.&lt;ref name=NYT-Catch-22&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bozzola |first1=Lucia |title=Movies: Catch-22 (1970) |url=https://www.nytimes.com/movies/movie/8628/Catch-22/overview |publisher=The New York Times |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other genres were combined in [[Franklin J. Schaffner]]'s ''[[Patton (film)|Patton]]'' (1970), about real life General [[George S. Patton]], where combat scenes were interleaved with commentary about how he waged war, showing good and bad sides to a command. It and ''MASH'' became the two most profitable war/anti-war films made up to that time;&lt;ref name="Suid2002"&gt;Suid, 2002. pp. 260–277&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Patton'' won seven [[Academy Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.oscars.org/oscars/ceremonies/1971 |title=The 43rd Academy Awards (1971) Nominees and Winners |accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Woodward Dream Cruise''' event is a classic car event held annually on the third Saturday of August in [[Metropolitan Detroit]], Michigan, along [[Woodward Avenue]], a major thoroughfare built in the early 20th century. The WDC Event spans much of the avenue: drivers travel from the suburbs of [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] through [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]] in [[Oakland County, Michigan]], to the State Fair Grounds within the [[Detroit]] city limits, just south of [[8&amp;nbsp;Mile Road]]. An estimated one million spectators attended the 2009 Woodward Dream Cruise.&lt;ref&gt;Anderson, Elisha (August 22, 2010).[http://www.freep.com/article/20100822/NEWS13/100822026/1137/Weather-blamed-for-smaller-attendance-at-Dream-Cruise "Weather blamed for smaller attendance at Dream Cruise"],''Detroit Free Press.'' Retrieved on August 22, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Starting in 1848, when the roadway was converted from logs to planks, young carriage drivers would race along Woodward Avenue.&lt;ref name=whitall&gt;{{cite news |first= Susan |last= Whitall |date= March 12, 2007 |title= Woodward Avenue: Michigan's Main Street |url= http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20070312/METRO/703120330/Woodward-Avenue--Michigan-s-Main-Street |work= The Detroit News |issn= 1055-2715 |accessdate= July 16, 2012 |archiveurl= https://www.webcitation.org/6A4hbcRvV?url=http://www.detroitnews.com/article/20070312/METRO/703120330/Woodward-Avenue--Michigan-s-Main-Street |archivedate= August 21, 2012 |deadurl= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Woodward Avenue was developed as a major street in Detroit in the early 20th century, and was lined with mansions and major churches.

By 1958, the roadway was used by youth for unofficial street racing with cars. The wide width, median, and sections lacking a large commercial presence attracted drivers eager for the competition. The numerous [[drive-in]]s along the upper road, each with its dedicated local teenaged clientele, were also popular. In the age of the [[muscle car]], Woodward had numerous car dealerships and automobile accessory shops. These completed the attractions for young adults to cruise, race and hang out along the road.&lt;ref name=genat&gt;{{cite book |last= Genat |first= Robert |year= 2010 |title= Woodward Avenue: Cruising the Legendary Strip |location= North Branch, MN |publisher= CarTech Books |pages= 15, 41, 90, 124–5 |isbn= 978-1-932494-91-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Berkley Custom Cop Car.jpg|thumb|left|[[Berkley, Michigan|Berkley's]] Custom Police Cruiser, a 1991 [[Chevrolet Caprice]] complete with a 502-[[Cubic inch displacement|CID]] V8 and flames, donated by a group of residents for use in the Woodward Dream Cruise.]]

The Woodward Dream Cruise is the world's largest one-day automotive event, drawing about 1.5 million people and 40,000 classic cars each year from around the globe. Spectators can see [[muscle cars]], [[hot rod|street rods]], custom, collector and special interest vehicles dating across several decades.&lt;ref name="WDC-Hist"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodwarddreamcruise.com/history.php |title=Woodward Dream Cruise History |publisher=woodwarddreamcruise.com |accessdate=2008-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904182927/http://www.woodwarddreamcruise.com/history.php |archivedate=September 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of the [[car]]s on display are those that were available and popular during the 1950s, 60s and early 70s prior to the [[OPEC]] oil embargo. This had resulted in the federal government's [[Corporate Average Fuel Economy]] regulations of 1975 and the proliferation, temporarily, of more fuel-efficient and less powerful automobiles. However, the Woodward Dream Cruise also welcomes vehicles of all models whose owners have either scrupulously maintained or customized their car to create a unique vehicle or statement.

Pamela S. McCullough, Mayor, and Nelson House, a plumber from Ferndale, came up with the idea for the cruise in 1994 to help raise money for a children's soccer field in his community.&lt;ref name="WDC-Hist"/&gt; Organizers initially expected 30,000 or 40,000&amp;nbsp;people to come to the August 19, 1995, inaugural cruise on Woodward Avenue in Ferndale, Pleasant Ridge, Berkley, Huntington Woods, Royal Oak and Birmingham. About 250,000 showed up.&lt;ref name="WDC-Hist"/&gt;  It is now the largest single-day classic car event in the world, and brings in over $56 million annually to the Metro Detroit economy.&lt;ref name="WDC-faq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.woodwarddreamcruise.com/faq.php |title=Woodward Dream Cruise FAQ |publisher=woodwarddreamcruise.com |accessdate=2008-09-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080904184351/http://www.woodwarddreamcruise.com/faq.php |archivedate=September 4, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the cruise officially takes place on only one day, each year the celebration starts early in the summer as the classic vehicles begin to appear on local streets. The sponsoring communities of [[Ferndale, Michigan|Ferndale]], [[Pleasant Ridge, Michigan|Pleasant Ridge]], [[Royal Oak, Michigan|Royal Oak]], [[Huntington Woods, Michigan|Huntington Woods]], [[Berkley, Michigan|Berkley]], [[Bloomfield Township, Oakland County, Michigan|Bloomfield Township]], [[Bloomfield Hills, Michigan|Bloomfield Hills]], and [[Pontiac, Michigan|Pontiac]] collaborate on ancillary events.&lt;ref name="WDC-faq"/&gt;

The '''World Forestry Congress''' ('''WFC''') is the largest and most significant gathering of the world's [[forestry]] sector and it has been held every six years since 1926 under the auspices of the [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] of the [[United Nations]] ([[FAO]]), organized by the government of the host country.&lt;ref name = history&gt;World Forestry Congress. [http://www.fao.org/forestry/18507/en/ Historical context]. [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO). Retrieved on: 2009-06-27&lt;/ref&gt; It is a forum for the sharing of knowledge and experience regarding the [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]], [[forest management|management]] and use of the world's [[forests]], and covers such issues as international dialogue, socio-economic and institutional aspects, and [[forest]] policies.

The aim of the WFC is to contribute to orient/shape international action in [[silvicultural]] aspects and stimulate global competency and reflection that can inform the development of the global forestry sector. The WFC may also be providing guidance to national and international [[forestry]] organizations as to the most appropriate and effective means to coordinate international actions concerning technical and policy. Finally, the Congress can contribute to identify action lines, define guidelines to stimulate the development of national policies, propose incentives to orient the public and private sector, promote international cooperation in [[forestry]] matters, whilst contributing to social progress and the conservation of [[natural resources]] at global, regional and national levels.&lt;ref name = history/&gt;

== General relevance and objectives ==

The World Forestry Congresses are an international effort aimed at influencing and stimulating reflection and analysis of the different factors, conditions, techniques, methodologies as well as professional or personal positions, thinking and ideas concerning global silviculture science. As such, each WFC has contributed to create awareness, to review and/or to formulate new approaches to technical, scientific or policy actions within the [[forestry]] sector.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5372e/x5372e04.htm ''Unasylva'', Vol. 8, No. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The value and utility of the WFC rests also in the opportunity it offers to the world foresters and sectoral decisions-makers to analyse and expose their technical convictions and experiences, to discuss and exchange ideas and thinking, and to broaden their perspectives by sharing their common as well as diverse problems. This is particularly true today, as [[forestry]] [[sustainable development|development]] is becoming more and more a topic with international linkages and implications.&lt;ref name="Unasylva, Vol. 3, No. 6"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5353e/x5353e02.htm#third%20world%20congress ''Unasylva'', Vol. 3, No. 6]&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth in exchanges of knowledge and people in the [[forestry]] sector benefits all countries, and especially those with more need for [[forestry]] development. The diffusion of the scientific and technical advances as well as the human contacts promoted by the Congress, contribute to a better global balance in this sector and allow dissemination of more accurate information about [[forestry]].

The WFC does not play the role of assessing the political, economic and social objectives of the participant countries. However, in its capacity as extraordinary [[deliberative assembly|assembly]] with broad representation from many countries and [[forestry]] groups,&lt;ref name = history/&gt; it contributes continuously to drawing public attention to [[forest]] related issues, to the need to raise livelihoods, and to the importance of the multiple benefits provided by [[forests]].&lt;ref name="Unasylva, Vol. 8, No. 3"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5372e/x5372e03.htm#messages%20to%20the%20fourth%20world%20forestry%20congress ''Unasylva'', Vol. 8, No. 3]&lt;/ref&gt;

Future WFCs will continue to promote international exchange, both as a result of new research and collaborations and of better comprehension of [[forest]] [[ecosystems]] and techniques for the [[sustainable development]] of these resources in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/w6251e/w6251e02.htm#editorial:%20eleventh%20world%20forestry%20congress ''Unasylva'' Vol. 48, No. 190-191]&lt;/ref&gt;

* The '''2nd World Forestry Congress''' was convened at [[Budapest]] in 1936. These two conferences have been milestones in the development of international co-operation in forestry. The impetus which they gave has become evident in the ever-growing common effort for a solution of the many problems affecting forestry and forest products.&lt;ref name="The Work of FAO."&gt;Food and Agriculture Organization, Forestry Department (1948) [http://www.fao.org/DOCREP/X5342E/x5342e07.htm "The Work of FAO."] ''Unasylva,'' Vol. '''2''', No. 1.

''"When this third Congress reviews the progress made since 1936, it will be seen how greatly ideas and practice in various countries have benefited from international exchanges of view and experience."''&lt;ref name="The Work of FAO."/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Congress achieved an important resolution, recommended the preparation of a [[forestry]] dictionary in the major languages of the world. Such a dictionary should not only list translations of terms; it should also give precise definitions of the terms most commonly used in forestry and of the more important phrases of the forester's vocabulary.

The main themes of the Third Congress were:

* Silvics and [[silviculture]]
* [[Forest survey]]s (the essential role of the techniques of [[sampling (statistics)|sampling]] and [[forest inventory|forest inventories]] in the composite picture of [[forestry]] and [[wood technology]])
* Forest economics (including Forest policy)
* Forest utilization
* [[Forest industry|Forest industries]]

=== 4th World Forestry Congress: Dehra Dun, India, 1954 ===
The objective of the Congress was to determine the role and place of forested areas in the general land economy and economic development of a country, in the light of progress made to date in [[knowledge]] of forest resources, in [[silviculture]] and management, in [[logging]] and utilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5372e/x5372e01.htm#program%20of%20the%20fourth%20world%20forestry%20congress |title=Unasylva - Vol. 8, No. 3 - Fourth World Forestry Congress - Program of the Fourth World Forestry Congress |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''"What do I expect from the Fourth World Forestry Congress? Not directives which only Governments can give, but instructive information and advice on which those directives can be based and, following which, I can see that our abilities for service can be made most effective."''

''If we can recognize the inviting horizons ahead and be advised how we can move towards them in helpful association with each other, I am convinced we can realize our ambitions.

=== 5th World Forestry Congress: Seattle, United States of America, 1960 ===
The central theme of the Congress was the "Multiple Use of [[Forest]] and Associated Lands."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5396e/x5396e00.htm |title=Unasylva - Vol. 14, No. 3 - Table of Contents |publisher=Fao.org |date=1960-01-01 |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Multiple use means the management of the [[forest]] in a manner that, while conserving the basic land resource, will yield a high level of production in the five major uses - [[wood]], water, [[forage]], [[recreation]], and [[wildlife]] - for the long-run benefit of the largest possible number of people.&lt;ref name="Unasylva, Vol. 14, No.3"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/x5396e/x5396e00.htm ''Unasylva'', Vol. 14, No.3]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main themes discussed in the Congress were:  
# [[Forest]] Protection
# [[Education]]
# [[Forest]] and Range [[Drainage basin|Watersheds]]
# [[Logging]] and [[Forest]] Operations
# [[Genetics]] and [[Tree]] Improvement
# [[Forest]] Economics and Policy
# [[Forest]] Products
# [[Forest]] Recreations and [[Wildlife]]
# [[Tropical]] Forestry

The Congress concluded that the multiple-use concept presented new challenges and new opportunities to foresters everywhere, with great prospects for additional services to the welfare of mankind. It was not, however, a panacea which could solve all [[forest management]] problems. Often one use must be dominant and other proposed uses must not then be detrimental to the major one. Moreover, there can be disadvantages to multiple use when it is inefficiently applied. But multiple use must be recognized as an important goal of [[forest]] policies.&lt;ref name="Unasylva, Vol. 14, No.3" /&gt;

The Congress was attended by 1,970 participants representing 65 countries.

=== 6th World Forestry Congress: Madrid, Spain, 1966 ===
The main theme of the Congress was "The role of [[forestry]] in the changing world economy", based on a study conducted for [[FAO]] by Wood: "World trends and prospects."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/30289e/30289e0b.htm#sixth%20world%20forestry%20congress,%20madrid,%206%2018%20june%201966 |title=Unasylva - No. 79 - Sixth world forestry congress, Madrid, 6-18 June 1966 |publisher=Fao.org |date=1966-06-18 |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 1965, representatives from 114 Member States met at [[FAO]]'s headquarters in Rome, under the chairmanship of [[Maurice Sauvé]], Minister of [[Forestry]], Canada, for the thirteenth session of the Conference, and celebrated the Twentieth Anniversary of the founding of [[FAO]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}

Reviewing the world forestry situation, the Conference set down certain considerations which must determine the scale and pattern of [[FAO]]'s future activities. Among these was the following:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''"The [[forestry]] administrator today faces tasks considerably more complex than those faced by his predecessors. This is particularly true in developing countries. The number of institutions for higher forestry education responding to these changing needs is as yet insufficient. [[FAO]] is uniquely placed to interpret these changing needs, through its intimate contacts with national [[forest]] administrations, its working relations with forest industries, its awareness of the requirements of [[developing countries]], and its contacts with, and responsibility for, many [[forestry]] educational institutions. On [[FAO]] therefore, lies the responsibility for promoting discussion and initiating action, by assisting [[forestry]] schools to transform their graduate and postgraduate training."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/30289e/30289e00.htm ''Unasylva'', Vol. 19, No. 79]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The main themes discussed in the Congress were:

# World trends in [[wood]] resources and requirements

The Congress urged governments receiving aid from outside sources to create by their own efforts and endeavours such conditions as would enable them best to profit from the technical and material assistance afforded to them. The Congress hoped these kinds of assistance could then be further expanded.

The Congress was attended by 2,700 participants representing 93 countries.

=== 7th World Forestry Congress: Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1972 ===
The main theme of the Congress was: "[[Forests]] and [[socioeconomic development]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/d4956e/d4956e01.htm#seventh%20world%20forestry%20congress |title=Unasylva - No. 104 - Special issue - Seventh world forestry congress |publisher=Fao.org |date=1972-10-04 |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The congress examined its multi-facet challenges: how to accelerate economic and social progress whilst maintaining or enhancing the quality of the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]], recognizing that the aspiration to raise living standards often finds expression in forms that threaten the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;''The Congress believes that the Plan of Action formulated by the [[United Nations]] Conference on the Human [[built environment|Environment]] at [[Stockholm]] in 1972 will influence [[forestry]] [[sustainable development|development]] throughout the world in the years to come. Recognizing that in many countries declared forest policies are not in accord with new [[knowledge]], new preoccupations and new aspirations, the Congress considers it is now urgent to redefine forest policies in view of these new circumstances. The Congress firmly believes that, whatever the political objectives, whatever the form of economic organization, whatever the present pattern of [[forest]] [[land tenure]], governments are responsible for planning the continuous flow of the productive, protective and social goods and services from the [[forest]], ensuring that the physical output and environmental benefits of the [[forests]] are available for the general welfare of their peoples now and for all time. Since we live in one world, and since the [[forest]] resources of the world are unevenly distributed, national policies and plans must take account of the international context.''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/d4956e/d4956e00.htm ''Unasylva'', Vol. 25, No. 104]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The central phase of the congress was devoted to technical discussions extending over the whole range of the professional interests of the participants. The main themes were:
# Silviculturists
# Professors, teachers and students
# Conservationists and recreationists
# Loggers
# Researchers
# Economists, administrators and planners
# Industrialists

The congress received representation from over 80 countries. This was in part made possible by the granting of fellowships by several national technical [[aid agencies]] and by the host country.

Named as co-presidents were the heads of forest administrations in [[Argentina]]'s neighbouring countries where study tours were conducted: Brazil, [[Chile]] and [[Uruguay]].

=== 8th World Forestry Congress: Jakarta, Indonesia, 1978 ===
The Congress, with the theme "[[Forests]] for People", examined in depth how [[forestry]] might best serve human beings, individually and collectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/l2680e/l2680e00.htm |title=Unasylva - No. 121 - Nepal: urban renewal - Table of Contents |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a consequence, the Congress declared that the world's [[forests]] must be maintained, on a sustainable basis, for the use and enjoyment of all people.&lt;ref name="Unasylva, Vol. 30, No. 121"&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/l2680e/l2680e06.htm#the%20world%20of%20forestry ''Unasylva'', Vol. 30, No. 121]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main themes analyzed by the Congress lead to:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
# '''	Reaffirming the responsibility''' of governments and on their [[forest]] administrations to manage every hectare of [[forest]] to best advantage, at the interest of all world, to avoid the forest disappearance specially of the [[tropical]] forests
# '''	Confirming that''' and because of the close and direct link between quality and quantity of water on the one hand and the extent and state of the [[forest]] resource on the other, every effort should be made in order to prevent water becoming so scarce as to affect biological production adversely
# '''	Recognizing the gravity of world food shortages''', for which an enlarged concept of multiple-use [[forestry]] is required, which encompasses the more direct production of food from [[forests]] and [[forest]] [[trees]], as well as from wild [[fauna]]
# '''	Reaffirming that the world [[Drainage basin|watershed]] management problems''' require major attention and awareness in view of the existent technological means to solve them
# '''	Recognizing that the [[energy]] crisis and the increased oil prices''' will have a further and potential long term implication for [[forestry]], with the possibility that [[forests]] become an important source of [[energy]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/l2680e/l2680e00.htm ''Unasylva'', Vol. 30, No. 121]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Over 2,000 participants from 100 countries and 17 international organizations attended the Congress.

The Congress strongly emphasized the important role which [[forest products]] other than [[timber]] play in the life of rural communities depending on the [[forests]]. These products play a vital role in providing employment opportunities and raising the living standard of rural people, increasing the number of people supported by [[forests]]. The Congress therefore recommended that [[forest]] services and international organizations should work for the conservation, promotion and rational utilization of such products.&lt;ref name="Unasylva, Vol. 30, No. 121" /&gt;

=== 9th World Forestry Congress: Mexico City, Mexico, 1985 ===

The year 1985 had been declared "International Year of the [[Forest]]" by the [[FAO]] Council. Year 1985 also marked FAO's fortieth anniversary, as well as the occasion of the Ninth World Forestry Congress in Mexico City.
The theme of the Congress was "[[Forest]] Resources in the Integral [[sustainable development|Development]] of Society."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/r1340e/r1340e00.htm |title=Unasylva - No. 147 - IX World Forestry Congress Mexico 1985 - Table of Contents |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It emphasized the need for foresters to look beyond their own resource base to consider how [[forest]] policies can be formulated in the light of such global events as an international banking crisis. The purpose of the Congress was to develop clear lines of action that may serve as guidelines for (a) formulating national policies; (b) providing incentives and guidance to the private and government sectors; and (c) promoting international cooperation in [[forestry]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/r1340e/r1340e00.htm ''Unasylva'', Vol. 37 No. 147]&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 20 sessions of the three technical commissions into which the Congress was divided, 20 agenda items were discussed, with the presentation of 22 basic documents and 160 special documents. The long list of subjects studied included:
# The increasing destruction of [[tropical]] forests
# The dramatic shortage of fuelwood in arid and semi-arid zones
# The threat posed by degraded mountain areas
# The [[atmospheric pollution]] of forests, and the deterioration of the [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] in highly [[industrialized countries]]
# The [[forest fires]]
# The new advances in the fields of remote sensing, [[forest]] [[genetics]], [[wood]] as a source of [[energy]], prevention and control of [[forest fires]], [[forest]] [[hydrology]] and industrial uses of [[timber]].

Besides the sessions of the Congress itself, a series of satellite meetings was held, including:
* The Expert Consultation on the Role of [[Forestry]] in Combating [[Desertification]]
* The International Forum of [[Forestry]] Youth
* The meeting on Prospects for International Financing for [[Forestry]] Programmes
* The first International Symposium on [[Forest]] [[Fauna]]
* The thirteenth session of the [[FAO]] Advisory Committee on [[Forestry]] [[Education]]
* The [[Latin American]] Round Table on [[Forest]] Genetic Resources
* The Meeting of the International Society of [[Tropical]] Foresters.

Over 2,000 participants from 105 countries attended the Congress, including representatives of many national and international organizations, institutions and associations and a large number of private individuals. Amongst the participants were professional foresters, scientists, educators, students, politicians, industry officers, workers and bankers.

=== 10th World Forestry Congress: Paris, France, 1991 ===
The overall theme of the Congress was "[[Forests]], a heritage for the future".
Congress members confronted the difficult task of reconciling conservation of the resource base with the need for its rational use in [[sustainable development]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/u3500e/u3500e00.htm |title=Unasylva - No. 166 - 10th World Forestry Congress - Table of Contents |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main themes of the Congress were as follows:
# The [[forest]], a protective heritage
# Conservation and protection of the [[forest]] heritage
# [[Trees]] and [[forests]] in rural and urban [[land management]]
# Management of the [[forest]] heritage
# The [[forest]] heritage, an economic resource
# Policy and institutions.

Read the following excerpt form an interview with [[FAO]]'s Director-General, [[Edouard Saouma]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"''The threat to [[forests]] is worldwide and by no means confined to [[tropical]] forests. In short, we run the very real risk of undermining a resource base that is fundamental to the future [[sustainable development|development]] of the Earth. This must not be allowed to occur. Our responsibility extends not only to all people now living on the planet, but also to future generations. Therefore, I cannot but applaud the selection of "[[Forests]], a heritage for the future" as the theme for the '''Tenth World Forestry Congress'''. As co-organizer of the Congress, along with the Government of France, [[FAO]] has committed substantial human and financial resources to ensuring that this will be the most widely followed Congress to date. The fruits of this effort are already evident; the number of voluntary papers was forecast as approximately 300 but more than 700 have been received. In the same vein, I would also wish to note that [[FAO]] has chosen "[[Trees]] for life" as the theme for [[World Food Day]], 16 October 1991.''"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/u3500e/u3500e00.htm ''Unasylva'', Vol. 42, No. 1991-92]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More than 2,500 forestry decision-makers from 136 countries attended the Congress.

=== 11th World Forestry Congress: Antalya, Turkey, 1997 ===
The general theme of the Congress was "[[Forestry]] for [[Sustainable Development]]: Towards the Twenty-first Century". The theme amply reflects the unique opportunity offered to the Congress and to the [[forestry]] sector at large to provide technical responses to the political issues raised in these fora.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/w6251e/w6251e00.htm |title=Unasylva - No. 190-191 - Eleventh world forestry congress - Table of Contents |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In fact, as the last of these gatherings last century, the Eleventh WFC carried with it the special responsibility of summing up what had been achieved and of looking ahead to the challenges of the third millennium. Against this background, the general theme was selected in clear recognition of the importance of viewing [[forestry]] not as an isolated technical discipline, but rather as an important component of overall [[socio-economic development]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/w6251e/w6251e02.htm#editorial:%20eleventh%20world%20forestry%20congress ''Unasylva'', Vol. 48, No. 190-191]&lt;/ref&gt;

The technical sessions of the Congress were organized around the following main programme areas:
# [[Forest]] and [[Tree]] Resources
# [[Forests]], Biological Diversity and Maintenance of Natural Heritage
# Protective and Environmental Functions of [[Forests]]
# Productive Functions of [[Forests]]
# Economic Contribution of [[Forestry]] to [[Sustainable Development]]
# Social Dimensions of [[Forestry]]'s Contribution to [[Sustainable Development]]
# Policies, Institutions and Means for Sustainable [[Forestry]] Development
# Ecoregional Review.

The programme of the Congress presented 38 themes for discussion, each one based in a special document with a total of 1.200 voluntary papers. During the nine-day conference, delegates attended eight plenary sessions and 43 technical sessions. In addition to these sessions, three pre-Congress satellite meetings took place, an informal ministerial meeting and approximately 30 side meetings and other special events.

More than 4,400 participants from 145 countries attended the Congress, representing the scientific community, governments, international organizations, non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and the private sector.

The [[Antalya]] Declaration expressed concern about the discrepancy between the impressive progress in the [[wikt:development|development]] of concepts and tools, national programmes, global and regional treaties and varied partnerships among governments and international organizations, and the continued alarming rate of [[deforestation]] and degradation of [[forest]] resources, calling for a harmonization of the planet and its inhabitants' needs with the [[forests]]' potential to produce a vital support through political, institutional and government forestry strategies, also as a contribution to the [[UN Millennium Development Goals]] and other international agreements.

The Congress requested [[FAO]] to present an assessment of progress on the strategies outlined in the Final Statement to the '''XIII World Forestry Congress'''.

=== 12th World Forestry Congress: Quebec City, Canada, 2003 ===
The main theme of the Congress was "[[Forests]]: source of life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5189e/y5189e00.htm |title=Unasylva - No. 214/215 - FOREST MANAGEMENT AT THE XII WORLD FORESTRY CONGRESS |publisher=Fao.org |date= |accessdate=2013-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The thematic areas were developed around the followings aspects:
# [[Forests]] for people
# [[Forests]] for the planet
# People and [[forests]] in harmony

A total of 1,038 [http://www.fao.org/forestry/docrep/wfcxii/index_mv-en.htm voluntary papers] and 456 posters were received from all over the world - of which nearly 200 were selected for presentation, based on peer review by specialists in [[FAO]] and in Canadian institutions. In addition, 32 [http://www.fao.org/forestry/docrep/wfcxii/index_mi-en.htm invited papers] were presented, categorized as position papers and special papers. The technical programme was structured around ten plenary sessions, 38 theme sessions, poster sessions and 115 side events. Innovation with respect to preceding congresses included ten eco-regional sessions followed by round table discussions, and six open fora.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/forestry/docrep/wfcxii/ WFC-Documents]. [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO). Retrieved on: 2009-06-27&lt;/ref&gt;

The Congress attracted 4,061 participants from more than 140 countries. The participants, representing a cross-section of society concerned with [[forests]], included individuals from rural communities, private forest owners, labour, [[indigenous peoples]], youth, [[industry]], environmental and other [[non-governmental organizations]], the scientific and [[academic community]], various levels of government and [[international organizations]].&lt;ref&gt;World Forestry Congress. [http://www.fao.org/forestry/5387/en/ World Forestry Congress XII]. [[Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations]] (FAO). Retrieved on: 2009-06-27&lt;/ref&gt;

The main output of the congress, the Final Statement, identifies areas of priority concern and is intended to encourage decisions and action by those involved with various aspects of forests and forestry, and in other related sectors.

The Final Statement&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/docrep/006/y5189e/y5189e00.htm ''Unasylva'', Vol. 54, No. 214-215]&lt;/ref&gt; calls for the development and dissemination of methodologies for assessing, reporting and managing the complete array of [[forest products]]; calls for action to manage [[forests]] and intensify forest landscape restoration and rehabilitation activities to support livelihoods, increase [[forest]] cover, enhance [[biological diversity]] and functionality, and minimize the impact of invasive [[alien species]]; and encourage [[collaborative partnerships]] involving women, forest owners, [[indigenous peoples]], [[non-governmental organizations]], local communities, [[industry]] and public agencies.

=== 13th World Forestry Congress: Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2009===

The XIII World Forestry Congress&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fao.org/forestry/37076/en/ XIII WFC web site]&lt;/ref&gt; was held in [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]] from 18 to 23 October 2009.

[[Image:XIII WFC.gif|right|thumb|250px| Click [http://www.fao.org/forestry/37076/en/'''here'''] to access the '''XIII WFC''' web site]]

Under the theme "[[Forests]] in [[sustainable development|development]]: a vital balance" over 7,000 experts from governments, academia, research, the private sector, and non-governmental organizations came from all continents to discuss and exchange experiences over a seven-day period on a broad range of [[forestry]] related topics.

The Congress included presentations, discussions, round tables, parallel events and exhibitions, focusing on the following main issues:

* [[Forests]] and [[biodiversity]]
* Production for [[sustainable development|development]]
* [[Forests]] at the service of people
* Caring for our [[forests]]
* [[sustainable development|Development]] opportunities
* Organizing [[forest]] [[sustainable development|development]]
* People and [[forests]] in harmony

The Congress addressed social, ecological and economic aspects of sustainable [[forest management]] in local, regional and global contexts.

=== 14th World Forestry Congress: Durban, South Africa, 2015===

The XIV [http://www.fao.org/about/meetings/world-forestry-congress/en/ World Forestry Congress] was held in South Africa, 7–11 September 2015. The central theme of WFC XIV was ''Forests and People: Investing in a Sustainable Future''. WFC XIV emphasized the role of forests in income generation, employment creation and equity and the vital links between forests and climate change, biodiversity conservation and sustainable water resources.
The six Congress sub-themes included:
* forests for socio-economic development and food security;
* building resilience with forests;
* integrating forests and other land uses;
* encouraging product innovation and sustainable trade;
* monitoring forests for better decision-making and improving governance by building capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/about/meetings/world-forestry-congress/en/ |website=WFC 2015 |publisher=FAO |accessdate=12 August 2015 |title=XIV World Forestry Congress}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Year zero''' does not exist in the [[anno Domini]] system usually used to number years in the [[Gregorian calendar]] and in its predecessor, the [[Julian calendar]]. In this system, the year {{nowrap|[[1 BC]]}} is followed by {{nowrap|[[AD 1]]}}.  However, there is a year zero in [[astronomical year numbering]] (where it coincides with the Julian year {{nowrap|1 BC}})  and in [[ISO 8601|ISO 8601:2004]] (where it coincides with the Gregorian year {{nowrap|1 BC}}) as well as in all [[Buddhist calendar|Buddhist]] and [[Hindu calendar]]s.

== Historical, astronomical and ISO year numbering systems ==

=== Historians ===

The ''[[Anno Domini]]'' era was introduced in 525 by [[Scythia Minor|Scythian]] monk [[Dionysius Exiguus]] (c. 470–c. 544), who used it to identify the years on his [[Dionysius Exiguus' Easter table|Easter table]]. He introduced the new era to avoid using the ''[[Diocletian Era|Diocletian era]]'', based on the accession of [[Roman Emperor]] [[Diocletian]], as he did not wish to continue the memory of [[Diocletianic Persecution|a persecutor of Christians]]. In the preface to his Easter table, Dionysius stated that the "present year" was "the [[consulship]] of [[Anicius Probus Iunior|Probus Junior]] [Flavius Anicius Probus Iunior]" which was also 525 years "since the incarnation of our Lord [[Jesus Christ]]".&lt;ref name=Dionysius&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm|title=DIONYSIUS EXIGUUS. LIBER DE PASCHATE SIVE CYCLUS PASCHALIS|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060109025617/http://hbar.phys.msu.su/gorm/chrono/paschata.htm|archivedate=9 January 2006|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; How he arrived at that number is unknown.

Dionysius did not use AD years to date any historical event. This began with the English cleric [[Bede]] (c. 672–735), who used AD years in his ''[[Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum]]'' (731), popularizing the era. Bede also used a term similar to the English [[Anno Domini|before Christ]] once, but that practice did not catch on until very much later. Bede did not sequentially number [[Roman calendar#Months|days of the month]], weeks of the year, or months of the year. However, he did number many of the [[week#numerical|days of the week]] using a counting origin of one in [[Ecclesiastical Latin]]. Previous Christian histories used ''[[anno mundi]]'' ("in the year of the world") beginning on the first day of [[Creation myth|creation]], or ''anno Adami'' ("in the year of [[Adam (Bible)|Adam]]") beginning at the creation of Adam five days later (the sixth day of creation according to the [[Genesis creation narrative]]), used by Africanus, or ''anno Abrahami'' ("in the year of [[Abraham]]") beginning 3,412 years after Creation according to the [[Septuagint]], used by [[Eusebius of Caesarea]], all of which assigned "one" to the year beginning at Creation, or the creation of Adam, or the birth of Abraham, respectively. Bede continued this earlier tradition relative to the AD era.

In chapter II of book I of ''Ecclesiastical history'', Bede stated that [[Julius Caesar]] invaded Britain "in the year 693 after the building of Rome, but the sixtieth year before the incarnation of our Lord", while stating in chapter III, "in the year of Rome 798, [[Claudius]]" also invaded Britain and "within a very few days … concluded the war in … the fortysixth [year] from the incarnation of our Lord".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/basis/bede-book1.html|title=Ecclesiastical History of the English Nation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although both dates are wrong, they are sufficient to conclude that Bede did not include a year zero between BC and AD: 798 − 693 + 1 (because the years are inclusive) = 106, but 60 + 46 = 106, which leaves no room for a year zero. The modern English term "before Christ" (BC) is only a rough equivalent, ''not'' a direct translation, of Bede's Latin phrase ''ante incarnationis dominicae tempus'' ("before the time of the lord's incarnation"), which was itself never abbreviated. Bede's singular use of 'BC' continued to be used sporadically throughout the [[Middle Ages]].

Neither the concept nor a symbol for zero existed in the system of [[Roman numerals]]. The [[Babylonian numerals#Numerals|Babylonian system]] of the BC era had used the idea of "nothingness" without considering it a number, and the Romans enumerated in much the same way. Wherever a modern zero would have been used, Bede and Dionysius Exiguus did use [[Latin]] number words, or the word ''nulla'' (meaning "nothing") alongside Roman numerals.&lt;ref name=Dionysius/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Faith Wallis, trans.

The [[Arabic numerals|Arabic numeral]] for zero ([[0 (number)|0]]) did not enter Europe until the thirteenth century. Even then, it was known only to very few, and only entered widespread use in Europe by the seventeenth century.

The ''anno Domini'' nomenclature was not widely used in Western Europe until the 9th century, and the {{nowrap|1 January}} to {{nowrap|31 December}} historical year was not uniform throughout Western Europe until 1752. The first extensive use (hundreds of times) of 'BC' occurred in ''Fasciculus Temporum'' by [[Werner Rolevinck]] in 1474, alongside years of the world (''anno mundi'').&lt;ref&gt;Werner Rolevinck, ''[http://www.cervantesvirtual.com/servlet/SirveObras/80248064097793506388868/index.htm Fasciculus temporum]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''anno Domini'', ''Dionysian era'', ''Christian era'', ''vulgar era'', and ''common era'' were used interchangeably between the [[Renaissance]] and the 19th century, at least in [[Latin]]. But ''vulgar era'' was suppressed in English at the beginning of the 20th century after ''vulgar'' acquired the meaning of "offensively coarse", replacing its original meaning of "common" or "ordinary". Consequently, historians regard all these eras as equal.

Historians have never included a year zero. This means that between, for example, {{nowrap|1 January}} {{nowrap|500 BC}} and {{nowrap|1 January}} {{nowrap|AD 500}}, there are 999 years: 500 years BC, and 499 years AD preceding 500. In common usage ''anno Domini'' 1 is preceded by the year 1 [[Ante Christum Natum|BC]], without an intervening year zero.&lt;ref&gt;While it is increasingly common to place ''AD'' after a date by analogy to the use of ''BC'', formal English usage adheres to the traditional practice of placing the abbreviation before the year as in Latin (e.g., {{nowrap|100 BC}}, but {{nowrap|AD 100}}).&lt;/ref&gt; Neither the choice of calendar system (whether [[Julian calendar|Julian]] or [[Gregorian calendar|Gregorian]]) nor the era (''Anno Domini'' or [[Common Era]]) determines whether a year zero will be used. If writers do not use the convention of their group (historians or astronomers), they must explicitly state whether they include a year 0 in their count of years, otherwise their historical dates will be misunderstood.&lt;ref&gt;V. Grumel, ''La chronologie'' (1958), page 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main article|Astronomical year numbering}}

In astronomy, for the year AD 1 and later it is common to assign the same numbers as the Anno Domini notation, which in turn is numerically equivalent to the Common Era notation. But the discontinuity between 1 AD and 1 BC makes it cumbersome to compare ancient and modern dates. So the year before 1 AD is designated 0, the year before 0 is &amp;minus;1, and so on.

The letters "AD", "BC", "CE, or "BCE" are omitted. So 1 BC in historical notation is equivalent to 0 in astronomical notation, 2 BC is equivalent to &amp;minus;1, etc. Sometimes positive years are preceded by the + sign. This year numbering notation was introduced by the astronomer Jacques Cassini in 1740.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| edition = 3| publisher = Univ Science Books| isbn = 1-891389-85-8| editor1-first = Sean E. | editor1-last= Urban | editor2-first = P.

==== History of astronomical usage ====
In 1627, the German astronomer [[Johannes Kepler]] first used an astronomical year which was to become year zero in his ''[[Rudolphine Tables]]''. He labeled the year ''Christi'' and inserted it between years labeled ''Ante Christum'' (BC) and ''Post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages of the Sun, Moon, and planets.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ub.uni-kiel.de/digiport/bis1800/Arch3_436.html Tabulae Rudolphinae – Ioannes Keplerus] (1627) 191 (42), 197 (48), 203 (54), 209 (60), 215 (66), 221 (72), 227 (78).&lt;/ref&gt; Then in 1702 the French astronomer [[Philippe de la Hire]] used a year he labeled {{nowrap|''Christum 0''}} at the end of years labeled ''ante Christum'' (BC), immediately before years labeled ''post Christum'' (AD) on the mean motion pages in his ''Tabulæ Astronomicæ'', thus adding the designation ''0'' to Kepler's ''Christi''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=BjygAAAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#PPP35,M1 Tabulae Astronomicae – Philippo de la Hire] (1702), Tabulæ 15, 21, 39, 47, 55, 63, 71; Usus tabularum 4.&lt;/ref&gt; Finally, in 1740 the French astronomer [[Jacques Cassini]] {{nowrap|(Cassini II)}}, who is traditionally credited with the invention of year zero,&lt;ref&gt;Robert Kaplan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Bn0EBVsfi1YC&amp;pg=PA103&amp;lpg=PA103 ''The nothing that is''] (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2000) 103.&lt;/ref&gt; completed the transition in his ''Tables astronomiques'', simply labeling this year ''0'', which he placed at the end of years labeled ''avant Jesus-Christ'' (BC), immediately before years labeled ''après Jesus-Christ'' (AD).&lt;ref&gt;[Jacques] Cassini, ''Tables astronomiques'' (1740), Explication et usage 5; Tables 10, 22, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ISO 8601 ===

[[ISO 8601|ISO 8601:2004]] (and previously ISO 8601:2000, but not ISO 8601:1988) explicitly uses astronomical year numbering in its date reference systems. Because it also specifies the use of the [[proleptic Gregorian calendar]] for all years before 1582, some readers incorrectly assume that a year zero is also included in that proleptic calendar, but it is not used with the BC/AD era. The "basic" format for year 0 is the four-digit form 0000, which equals the historical year 1&amp;nbsp;BC. Several "expanded" formats are possible: −0000 and +0000, as well as five- and six-digit versions. Earlier years are also negative four-, five- or six-digit years, which have an [[absolute value]] one less than the equivalent BC year, hence -0001 = 2 BC. Because only [[ISO 646]] (7-bit [[ASCII]]) characters are allowed by ISO 8601, the minus sign is represented by a [[hyphen-minus]].

== Other traditions ==

=== South Asian calendars ===
All eras used with [[Hindu calendar|Hindu]] and [[Buddhist calendar]]s, such as the [[Saka era]] or the [[Kali Yuga]], begin with the year 0. All  these calendars use elapsed, expired, or complete years, in contrast with most other calendars which use current years. A complete year had not yet elapsed for any date in the initial year of the epoch, thus the number 1 cannot be used. Instead, during the first year the indication of 0 years (elapsed) is given in order to show that the epoch is less than 1 year old. This is similar to the Western method of stating a person's age – people do not reach age one until one year has elapsed since birth (but their age during the year beginning at birth is specified in months or fractional years, not as age zero). However, if ages were specified in years and months, such a person would be said to be, for example, 0 years and 6 months or 0.5 years old. This is analogous to the way time is shown on a [[24-hour clock]]: during the first hour of a day, the time elapsed is 0 hours, ''n'' minutes.
