On October 18, 1998, a '''pipeline explosion''' occurred in the community of [[Jesse, Nigeria|Jesse]] (geographical coordinates {{Coord|5.870|5.750|type:event}}), {{convert|290|km|mi}} southeast of [[Lagos]], [[Nigeria]]. The cause of the blast has been debated. The Nigerian government stated the explosion took place after scavengers intentionally ruptured the pipeline with their tools and ignited the blaze; however, others have stated the pipeline ruptured due to a lack of maintenance and neglect with a cigarette igniting the fire.&lt;ref name="Nigerian Gas Line Fire"&gt;{{cite web

'''Acoustic foam''' is an open celled [[foam]] used for [[acoustic treatment]]. It attenuates airborne [[sound waves]] by increasing air resistance, thus reducing the [[amplitude]] of the waves.
&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url= https://www.universalpowerconversion.com/acoustical-foam|title= Acoustical Foam|website= universalpowerconversion.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The energy is dissipated as [[heat]].{{cn|date=January 2017}} Acoustic foam can be made in several different colors, sizes and thickness.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Acoustic foam can be attached to walls, ceilings, doors, and other features of a room to control noise levels, vibration, and echoes.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Many acoustic foam products are treated with [[dye]]s and/or [[fire retardant]]s. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= https://www.auralex.com/tools/testing-data/fire-testing-data/ |title= Fire Testing Data |website= auralex.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Uses ==
The objective of acoustic foam is to improve the sound quality by removing residual sound in any space.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chen|first=Francine Robina|date=1980|title=Acoustic characteristics and intelligibility of clear and conversational speech at the segmental level.|url=|journal=|volume=|pages=|via=Massachusetts Institute of Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;This purpose requires strategic placement of acoustic foam panels on walls, ceiling and floors, effectively eliminating [[Acoustic resonance|resonance]] within the room.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.avbend.com/acoustic-treatment |title= Acoustic Treatment - Acoustic Panels |agency= Audio Visual Bend |website= avbend.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== Acoustic enhancement ===
The objective is to enhance the properties of sound by improving speech clarity and [[sound quality]].{{cn|date=January 2017}} For this reason, acoustic foam is often used in [[recording studio]]s.{{cn|date=January 2017}} The purpose is to reduce, but not entirely eliminate, resonance within the room.{{cn|date=January 2017}} This is achieved by placing similar sized pieces of foam, often in the shape of cones or triangles, on opposite walls.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

=== Functionality ===
Acoustic foam is a lightweight material made from polyurethane foam either polyether or polyester, and also extruded [[melamine foam]].{{cn|date=January 2017}} It is usually cut into tiles - often with pyramid or wedge shapes - which are suited to placing on the walls of a recording studio or a similar type of environment to act as a sound absorber, thus enhancing the sound quality within a room.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Acoustic foam reduces or eliminates echoes and background noises by controlling the [[reverberation]] that sound can make by bouncing off walls.{{cn|date=January 2017}} This type of sound absorption is different from soundproofing, which is typically used to keep sound from escaping or entering a room.{{cn|date=January 2017}} Therefore, acoustic foam is installed in large rooms like churches, synagogues, concert halls.{{cn|date=January 2017}} These rooms have large, flat space and noise will certainly bounce around in the room.{{cn|date=January 2017}} These sound absorbers are used to improve the acoustics of the room, which thereby reduces noise in the room.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

Acoustic foam typically deals more with the mid and high frequencies.{{cn|date=January 2017}} To deal with lower frequencies, much thicker pieces of acoustic foam are needed; large pieces of acoustic foam are often placed in the corners of a room and are called acoustic foam corner [[bass trap]]s.{{cn|date=January 2017}}

A '''birch-bark roof''' (in Finnish: ''malkakatto'' or ''tuohikato'') is a roof construction traditional in [[Finland]] for farmhouses and farm buildings built from [[log home|logs]]. The birch-bark roof was the prevailing roof type in rural Finland up until the 1860s, when it was replaced by the use of other materials such as metal sheeting and later [[roofing felt]]. The tradition of birch-bark roofs has been revived in recent years as a craft in connection with the restoration of old farm buildings that have been converted into [[open-air museum]]s. The main reason for using birch bark was that when added in several layers, it acts as an efficient water- and damp-proof course. The birch trees would normally be de-barked, using a knife, during the summer.&lt;ref&gt;The Seurasaari Open-Air Museum Guide. Edited by Raija Järvelä-Hynynen. National Board of Antiquities, Helsinki, 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

The birch bark itself does not form the top layer of the roof. Once the main log frame of the building is constructed, the main horizontal roof poles are laid down; after this comes thin timber slats placed at right-angles to the base roof poles. On top of these then come the layers of birch-bark, each row overlapping the next. The number of layers could vary from 2 to 6 depending on the building. On top of the birch-bark layers were then placed long heavy wooden poles (usually de-barked young trees). The poles on either side of the pitched roof would be interlocked at the roof ridge. The poles were held in place at the eaves by an eaves board. The poles nearest the end gable would further be fixed with tree-root bindings. Furthermore, rocks were often placed on the roof to further add weight.&lt;ref&gt;Murtovaara. A crown forest croft. Karjalaisten Kulttuuri, Kuopio, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, though less common, turf would be placed above the birch bark.

In [[nuclear strategy]], a '''counterforce''' target is one that has a military value, such as a launch silo for [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s, an airbase at which nuclear-armed [[bomber]]s are stationed, a homeport for [[ballistic missile submarine]]s, or a [[command and control]] installation.&lt;ref name="martel"&gt;Martel, William C, and Paul L Savage. ''Strategic Nuclear War: What the Superpowers Target and Why''. New York: Greenwood Press, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intent of a counterforce strategy (attacking counterforce targets with nuclear weapons) is to do a [[pre-emptive nuclear strike]] whose aim is to disarm an adversary by destroying its nuclear weapons before they can be launched. That would minimize the impact of a retaliatory [[second strike]].&lt;ref name="corcoran"&gt;Corcoran, Edward A. [http://www.globalsecurity.org/wmd/library/report/2005/sndeterrence.htm ''Strategic Nuclear Weapons and Deterrence''.] [http://www.globalsecurity.org/ GlobalSecurity.org]. November 29, 2005. Accessed July 31, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; However, counterforce attacks are possible in a second strike as well, especially with weapons like [[UGM-133 Trident II]]. A counterforce target is distinguished from a [[countervalue]] target, which includes an adversary's population, knowledge, economic, or political resources.&lt;ref name="martel"/&gt; In other words, a counterforce strike is against an adversary's military, and a countervalue strike is against an adversary's cities.

A closely related tactic is the [[decapitation strike]], which destroys an enemy's nuclear [[command and control]] facilities and similarly has a goal to eliminate or reduce the enemy's ability to launch a second strike.

==Theory==

In [[nuclear warfare]], enemy targets are divided into two types: counterforce and [[countervalue]]. A counterforce target is an element of the military infrastructure, usually either specific weapons or the bases that support them. A counterforce strike is an attack that targets those elements but leaving the [[civilian]] infrastructure, the countervalue targets, as undamaged as possible.  Countervalue refers to the targeting of an opponent's cities and civilian populations.

An ideal counterforce attack would kill no civilians. Military attacks are prone to causing [[collateral damage]], especially when nuclear weapons are employed. In nuclear terms, many military targets are located near civilian centers, and a major counterforce strike that uses even relatively small nuclear warheads against a nation would certainly inflict many civilian casualties. Also, the requirement to use [[ground burst]] strikes to destroy [[blast shelter|hardened]] targets would produce far more [[fallout]] than the [[air burst]]s used to strike countervalue targets, which introduces the possibility that a counterforce strike would cause more civilian casualties over the medium term) than a countervalue strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://homepage.mac.com/msb/163x/faqs/nuclear_warfare_103.html|title=Nuclear Warfare 103|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031120165443/http://homepage.mac.com/msb/163x/faqs/nuclear_warfare_103.html|archive-date=20 November 2003|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Counterforce weapons may be seen to provide more credible deterrence in future conflict by providing options for leaders.&lt;ref name="lieber"&gt;Lieber, Keir A, and Daryl G Press. "[http://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/65481/keir-a-lieber-and-daryl-g-press/the-nukes-we-need The Nukes We Need]." [[Foreign Affairs]] 88, no. 6 (Nov/Dec 2009): 39-51.&lt;/ref&gt; One option considered by the Soviet Union in the 1970s was basing missiles in [[FOBS|orbit]].

==Cold War==
{{main|Pre-emptive nuclear strike|Second strike|Launch on warning}}
Counterforce is a type of attack which was originally proposed during the [[Cold War]].

Because of the low accuracy ([[circular error probable]]) of early generation [[intercontinental ballistic missile]]s (and especially [[submarine-launched ballistic missile]]s), counterforce strikes were initially possible only against very large, undefended targets like bomber airfields and naval bases. Later-generation missiles, with much-improved accuracy, made possible counterforce attacks against the opponent's hardened military facilities, like missile silos and command and control centers.

Both sides in the Cold War took steps to protect at least some of their nuclear forces from counterforce attacks. At one point, the US kept [[B-52 Stratofortress]] bombers permanently in flight so that they would remain operational after any counterforce strike. Other bombers were kept ready for launch on short notice, allowing them to escape their bases before intercontinental ballistic missiles, launched from land, could destroy them. The deployment of nuclear weapons on [[ballistic missile submarines]] changed the equation considerably, as submarines launching from positions off the coast would likely destroy airfields before bombers could launch, which would reduce their ability to survive an attack. Submarines themselves, however, are largely immune from counterforce strikes unless they are moored at their naval bases, and both sides fielded many such weapons during the Cold War.

[[File:Soviet Military Power ICBM map.gif|thumb|right|300px|US Department of Defense map of the Soviet [[Strategic Missile Troops#Numbers of missiles and warheads|Strategic Rocket Forces]] ICBM silos and bases in the 1980s.]]
A counterforce exchange was one scenario mooted for a possible limited nuclear war. The concept was that one side might launch a counterforce strike against the other; the victim would recognize the limited nature of the attack and respond in kind. That would leave the military capability of both sides largely destroyed. The war might then come to an end because both sides would recognize that any further action would lead to attacks on the civilian population from the remaining nuclear forces, a countervalue strike.

Critics of that idea claimed that since even a counterforce strike would kill millions of civilians since some strategic military facilities like bomber airbases were often located near large cities. That would make it unlikely that escalation to a full-scale countervalue war could be prevented.

[[MIRV]]ed land-based [[ICBM]]s are considered destabilizing because they tend to put a premium on [[first-strike|striking first]]. For example, suppose that each side has 100 missiles, with 5 warheads each, and each side has a 95 percent chance of neutralizing the opponent's missiles in their silos by firing 2 warheads at each silo. In that case, the side that strikes first can reduce the enemy ICBM force from 100 missiles to about 5 by firing 40 missiles with 200 warheads and keeping the rest of 60 missiles in reserve. For such an attack to be successful, the warheads would have to strike their targets before the enemy launching a counterattack (see [[second strike]] and [[launch on warning]]). That type of weapon was therefore banned under the [[START II]] agreement.

== Counterforce disarming first-strike weapons ==

* [[R-36 (missile)|R-36M]] (SS-18 Satan). Deployed in 1976, this counterforce MIRV ICBM had single (20 Mt) or 10 MIRV (550-750 kt each) warheads, CEP 250 m. Targeted against Minuteman III silos as well as [[CONUS]] command, control, and communications facilities. Has sufficient [[throw-weight]] to carry up to 10 [[re-entry vehicle|RVs]] and 40 [[penetration aids|penaids]]. Still in service.
* [[RSD-10 Pioneer|RSD-10]] (SS-20 Saber). Deployed in 1978, this counterforce MIRV IRBM could hide behind the Urals in Asian Russia, and launch its highly accurate 3 warhead payload (150 kt each, with a 150 m CEP) against NATO command, control, and communications installations, bunkers, air fields, air defense sites, and nuclear facilities in Europe. Extremely short flight time ensured NATO would be unable to respond prior to weapon impact. Triggered development and deployment of the Pershing II by NATO in 1983.
* [[LGM-118A Peacekeeper|Peacekeeper]] (MX Missile). Deployed in 1986, this missile boasted 10 MIRV warheads each with a 300 kt yield, [[Circular error probable|CEP]] 120 m. Decommissioned.
* [[Pershing II]]. Deployed in 1983, this single warhead MRBM boasted 50 m CEP with terminal [[active radar homing]]/[[DSMAC]] guidance. Short, 7-minute flight-time (which makes [[launch on warning]] much harder), variable yield warhead of 5-50 kt, and range of 1,800&amp;nbsp;km, allowed this weapon to strike command, control, and communications installations, bunkers, air fields, air defense sites, and ICBM silos in the European part of the Soviet Union with scarcely any warning. Decommissioned.
* [[RT-23 Molodets]] (SS-24 Scalpel). Deployed in 1987, this MIRV ICBM carried 10 warheads, each with 300-550 kt yield and a CEP of 150–250 m.
* [[UGM-133 Trident II]]{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}. Deployed in 1990, this intercontinental-range SLBM carries 8 RVs with CEP of 80–120 m and yield of 100/475 kt. Main purpose is second strike countervalue retaliation, but the excellent CEP and much shorter flight-time due to submarine launch (reducing the possibility of [[launch on warning]]) makes it an excellent first-strike weapon. However, that any nuclear power would be willing to place its nuclear submarines close to enemy shores during times of strategic tension is highly questionable. Has sufficient throw-weight to deploy up to 12 warheads, but 8 are deployed in current practice.

==Biography==
After financing his education at the [[University of Florida]] by buying the exclusive right to sell advertising for the yearbook, Leigh became a top salesman for a sign company in [[Birmingham, Alabama|Birmingham]]. In 1929, he moved to New York and got a job at the General Outdoor Advertising Company, but quit in 1933 to strike out on his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/10/25/realestate/streetscapes-douglas-leigh-sign-maker-the-man-behind-times-square-s-smoke-rings.html |title=Douglas Leigh, Sign Maker; The Man Behind Times Square's Smoke Rings |work=The New York Times |date=October 25, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of Leigh's creations have been replaced with newer signs, for which Leigh set the bar.

He was the step-grandfather of [[Prince Lorenzo Borghese]].

'''Drowned Lands''' is a name sometimes given to seasonally flooded areas, or to areas flooded by reservoirs. Sometimes it is poetically applied to lands said to have been lost to the sea, such as [[Lyonesse]].

There are certain locations particularly identified with this appellation:

==Underlying definition==
''A true circumnavigation of the world must pass through two points antipodean to each other.'' Norris McWhirter, founding editor of Guinness, 1971.

''[A] true circumnavigation of the Earth must: start and finish at the same point, traveling in one general direction, reach two antipodes, cross the equator, cross all longitudes, cover a minimum of 40,000km.'' AdventureStats by Explorersweb

== History ==
In 2006, the ''Adventure'' publication of the [[National Geographic Society]] honored Canadians Colin Angus and Julie Wafaei as Adventurers of the Year for their "journey around the world" by human power, however, the Society stated they do not "act as an official arbiter of geographic issues".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=National Geographic Adventure Magazine letter|title=Human Powered Circumnavigation Controversy|url=http://www.expedition360.com/national_geographic_ADVENTURE_colin_angus.pdf|date=12 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Angus' journey did not cross the equator or hit the minimum of two antipodal points as stipulated by the rules of [[Guinness World Records]] or [http://www.adventurestats.com/rules.shtml#around AdventureStats] by Explorersweb. Additionally, in the February 2013 issue of [[Outside Magazine]], Angus's then traveling partner Tim Harvey went on the record to say the pair "put up an emergency sail, using it for about 95 nautical miles" crossing the [[Bering Sea]] between [[Alaska]] and [[Siberia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Outside Magazine|title=Around the World in 1,026 days|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/adventure-travel/Around-the-World-in-1026-Days.html?page=6|date=February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; As journalist Nick Heil pointed out, this alone was enough to disqualify a human-powered claim of any description.

The only other person to have completed a legitimate human-powered circumnavigation is Turkish American adventurer [[Erden Eruç]] who completed the first solo circumnavigation between July 2007 and July 2012.&lt;ref name=erucgwr&gt;{{cite web|title=Guinness World Records – First solo circumnavigation of the globe using human power|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/108422-first-solo-circumnavigation-of-the-globe-using-human-power|publisher=Guinness World Records|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160319015308/http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/108422-first-solo-circumnavigation-of-the-globe-using-human-power|archivedate=19 March 2016|accessdate=26 October 2016|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This unique concept of going around the world by human power first came as a wild idea to Stevie Smith as he worked in his office in Paris. He soon set about making the idea a reality and got the help of his friend Jason Lewis who agreed to come with him. The pair set about spreading the idea, and began to raise money for a pedal boat built by Chris Tipper and Hugo Burnham. The specially-built boat was named ''Moksha'', Sanskrit for freedom. To raise cash Stevie cycled to [[Marrakesh]], [[Morocco]]. The pair had no formal training in either cycling or riding pedal boats.

== The Expedition ==

===European leg===
Smith and Lewis set off on bicycles from [[Greenwich]], London at midday on 12 July 1994. They cycled south-east across [[UK|Britain]] to the coast at [[Rye, East Sussex|Rye]], then pedalled across the [[English Channel]], and then cycled south again across France through major cities including Paris and [[Orléans]]. The pair split up for a short while, meeting back up in Spain. They then travelled through [[Madrid]], across Portugal and through [[Lisbon]], finally arriving at [[Lagos, Portugal|Lagos]] on 29 September 1994. According to Smith, they slept outdoors, taking their sleeping bags into open places and sleeping under the stars.

===The Atlantic Ocean===
The trip across the Atlantic took 111 days, pedaling in two-hour day and four-hour night shifts. It ended in Miami.

===North America===
They crossed the North American continent on bicycles and skates. Skating near [[Pueblo, Colorado]], Lewis was hit by a drunk driver and broke both of his legs. He spent 9 months in Colorado healing and resting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.expedition360.com/journal/archives/1996/03/usa_leg_by_inli.html x360 Journal: USA LEG by inline skates (Jason) - Ft. Lauderdale to Pueblo, Colorado. Retrieved 28 May 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peddling to Hawaii&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pacific===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Pedal Boat Moksha on River Thames.jpg|thumb|Jason Lewis pedaling his boat Moksha on the [[River Thames]] in [[London]], shortly before completing the first human-powered circumnavigation of the [[Earth]]]] --&gt;Lewis completed the journey across the Pacific in the ''Moksha''.  Smith quit the project in Hawaii.

===Australasia===
The next leg to be completed was Australia and Indonesia. The journey north used pedal boats, kayaks and bicycle. This leg of the [[circumnavigation]] in Australia was especially noteworthy, as Jason reached the [[Antipodes|antipode]] to his Atlantic crossing path.

===Final legs===
The second half of Jason's human powered [[circumnavigation]] journey continued through Southeastern Asia and India before crossing the Arabian Sea to the African shores, from where he aimed north toward the Middle East and Europe, eventually returning to his starting point in England.

During his expedition, Lewis twice survived [[malaria]], [[septicaemia]], a bout of mild schizophrenia, and a crocodile attack near Australia in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article2604026.ece | work=The Times | location=London | title=Back home after 13 years Jason Lewis is first man to circle world on muscle power | first=John | last=Elliott | date=7 October 2007 | accessdate=5 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''February 1987 nor'easter''' was a significant [[winter storm]] in the [[United States|US]] that impacted the [[Mid-Atlantic States]] around the end of the month. It delivered 8–12 hours of heavy, wet snowfall to several states from [[West Virginia]] to [[New York (state)|New York]] between February 22 and February 24. The storm was both preceded and followed by relatively warm temperatures,&lt;ref name="Kocin2"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 556&lt;/ref&gt; causing the snow to rapidly melt.&lt;ref name="Kocin"&gt;Kocin and Uccellini, p. 557&lt;/ref&gt; The mild conditions were the result of a moderate [[anticyclone]] over the region that deteriorated as the nor'easter approached. [[Cold air damming]] likely took place prior to the storm's formation.&lt;ref name="Kocin2"/&gt; 

The nor'easter evolved from a complex series of low pressure areas. Eventually, the multiple center consolidated and a primary cyclone took hold along the Carolina coast. This low rapidly strengthened as it tracked northeastward. Upon reaching the [[Maryland]] coast, it turned more towards the east and intensified further to attain a minimum barometric pressure of 964 [[millibars]] by 1800 UTC on February 23. The heaviest precipitation, occasionally accompanied by thunder and lightning, along with gusty winds, occurred between 0000 UTC and 1800 UTC.&lt;ref name="Kocin2"/&gt; 

Snowfall accumulations exceeding {{convert|10|in|cm|abbr=on}} were reported in eastern West Virginia, [[northern Virginia]], north-central Maryland, northern [[Delaware]], southern [[Pennsylvania]], central and southern [[New Jersey]], and [[Long Island]]. Most of the interior Northeast was spared a substantial impact from the storm. However, lighter totals extended as far north as central [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="Kocin2"/&gt;

The weight of the wet snow caused extensive damage to trees and power lines, and hundreds of thousands were reportedly left without power.&lt;ref name="Kocin2"/&gt; At [[Washington, D.C.]], {{convert|11|in|cm|abbr=on}} of snow fell, having widespread effects. Limited states of emergency were declared in certain areas.&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite web|author=James Barron|title=Wet Snow Clogs Roads in the East|date=February 24, 1987|publisher=''The New York Times''|accessdate=January 6, 2010|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/02/24/nyregion/wet-snow-clogs-roads-in-the-east.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

MV ''Balsa 24'', a {{convert|345|ft|m|adj=on}} long freighter, was lost February 25, 1987 after it capsized in the storm. 18 sailors were killed and there was 1 survivor, who was rescued by the nuclear submarine [[USS Scamp (SSN-588)]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4897">In [[Combustion]], '''G equation''' is a scalar &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;/math&gt; field equation which describes the instantaneous flame position, introduced by [[Forman A. Williams]] in 1985&lt;ref&gt;Williams, F. A. (1985). Turbulent combustion. In The mathematics of combustion (pp. 97-131). Society for Industrial and Applied Mathematics.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kerstein, Alan R., William T. Ashurst, and Forman A. Williams. "Field equation for interface propagation in an unsteady homogeneous flow field." Physical Review A 37.7 (1988): 2728.&lt;/ref&gt; in the study of premixed turbulent combustion. The equation is derived based on the [[Level-set method]]. The equation were studied by [[George H. Markstein]] earlier, in a restrictive form.&lt;ref&gt;GH Markstein. (1951). Interaction of flow pulsations and flame propagation. Journal of the Aeronautical Sciences, 18(6), 428-429.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markstein, G. H. (Ed.). (2014). Nonsteady flame propagation: AGARDograph (Vol. 75). Elsevier.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical description&lt;ref&gt;Peters, Norbert. Turbulent combustion. Cambridge university press, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Forman A. "Combustion theory." (1985).&lt;/ref&gt;==

The G equation reads as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial G}{\partial t} + \mathbf{v}\cdot\nabla G = U_L |\nabla G| &lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}&lt;/math&gt; is the flow velocity field
*&lt;math&gt;U_L&lt;/math&gt; is the local burning velocity

The flame location is given by &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{x},t)=G_o&lt;/math&gt; which can be defined arbitrarily such that &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{x},t)&gt;G_o&lt;/math&gt; is the region of burnt gas and &lt;math&gt;G(\mathbf{x},t)&lt;G_o&lt;/math&gt; is the region of unburnt gas. The normal vector to the flame is &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{n}=-\nabla G /|\nabla G|&lt;/math&gt;. 

===Local burning velocity===
The burning velocity of the [[Flame stretch|stretched flame]] can be derived by subtracting suitable terms from the unstretched flame speed, for small curvature and small strain, as given by

:&lt;math&gt;U_L = S_L - S_L \mathcal{L} \kappa - \mathcal{L} S&lt;/math&gt;

where
*&lt;math&gt;S_L&lt;/math&gt; is the burning velocity of [[premixed flame#Premixed flame propagation|unstretched flame]]
*&lt;math&gt;S=-\mathbf{n}\cdot\nabla\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n} &lt;/math&gt; is the term corresponding to the imposed [[strain rate]] on the flame due to the flow field
*&lt;math&gt;\mathcal{L}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Markstein number|Markstein length]], proportional to the laminar flame thickness &lt;math&gt;\delta_L&lt;/math&gt;, the constant of proportionality is [[Markstein number]] &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{M}&lt;/math&gt;
*&lt;math&gt;\kappa = \nabla\cdot\mathbf{n} = -\frac{\nabla^2 G - \mathbf{n}\cdot\nabla(\mathbf{n}\cdot\nabla G)}{|\nabla G|}&lt;/math&gt; is the flame curvature, which is positive if the flame front is convex with respect to the unburnt mixture and vice versa.

==A simple example - Slot burner==

The G equation has an exact expression for a simple slot burner. Consider a two-dimensional planar slot burner of slot width &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt; with a premixed reactant mixture is fed through the slot with constant velocity &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}=(0,U)&lt;/math&gt;, where the coordinate &lt;math&gt;(x,y)&lt;/math&gt; is chosen such that &lt;math&gt;x=0&lt;/math&gt; lies at the center of the slot and &lt;math&gt;y=0&lt;/math&gt; lies at the location of the mouth of the slot. When the mixture is ignited, a flame develops from the mouth of the slot to certain height &lt;math&gt;y=L&lt;/math&gt; with a planar conical shape with cone angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;. In the steady case, the G equation reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;U\frac{\partial G}{\partial y} = U_L \sqrt{\left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial x}\right)^2+ \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial y}\right)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

If a separation of the form &lt;math&gt;G(x,y) = y + f(x)&lt;/math&gt; is introduced, the equation becomes

:&lt;math&gt;U = U_L\sqrt{1+ \left(\frac{\partial f}{\partial x}\right)^2}, \quad \text{or} \quad \frac{\partial f}{\partial x} = \frac{\sqrt{U^2-U_L^2}}{U_L}&lt;/math&gt;

which upon integration gives

:&lt;math&gt;f(x) = \frac{(U^2-U_L^2)^{1/2}}{U_L}|x| + C, \quad \Rightarrow \quad G(x,y) = \frac{(U^2-U_L^2)^{1/2}}{U_L}|x| + y+ C&lt;/math&gt;

Without loss of generality choose the flame location to be at &lt;math&gt;G(x,y)=G_o=0&lt;/math&gt;. Since the flame is attached to the mouth of the slot &lt;math&gt;|x| = b/2, \ y=0&lt;/math&gt;, the boundary condition is &lt;math&gt;G(b/2,0)=0&lt;/math&gt;, which can be used to evaluate the constant &lt;math&gt;C&lt;/math&gt;. Thus the scalar field is

:&lt;math&gt;G(x,y) = \frac{(U^2-U_L^2)^{1/2}}{U_L}\left(|x|- \frac{b}{2}\right) + y&lt;/math&gt;

At the flame tip, we have &lt;math&gt;x=0, \ y=L, \ G=0 &lt;/math&gt;, the flame height is easily determined as

:&lt;math&gt;L = \frac{b(U^2-U_L^2)^{1/2}}{2U_L}&lt;/math&gt;

and the flame angle &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tan \alpha = \frac{b/2}{L} = \frac{U_L}{(U^2-U_L^2)^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[List of trigonometric identities|trigonometric identity]] &lt;math&gt;\tan^2\alpha = \sin^2\alpha/(1-\sin^2\alpha)&lt;/math&gt;, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\sin\alpha = \frac{U_L}{U}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Galala''' or '''Galalah''' is an Egyptian [[limestone]] extracted from a mountain called [[Galala Mountain|Galala]] located in [[Suez]], [[Egypt]]. It was named of the trade name of this mountain "Galala Marble". Its colours are creamy and creamy white as its variations differ according to the quarry stones.

A '''grain''' is a [[Physical unit|unit]] of measurement of [[mass]], and in the [[troy weight]], [[avoirdupois]], and [[Apothecaries' system]], equal to exactly {{val|64.79891|ul=milligrams}}. It is nominally based upon the mass of a single  virtual ideal seed of a [[cereal]]. From the Bronze Age into the Renaissance the average masses of [[wheat]] and [[barley]] grains were part of the legal definitions of units of mass. Rather, expressions such as "thirty-two grains of wheat, taken from the middle of the ear" appear to have been ritualistic formulas, essentially the premodern equivalent of legal [[Boilerplate (text)|boilerplate]].&lt;ref name="McDonaldScarre1992"&gt;{{cite book|last1=McDonald|first1=Daniel McLean|last2=Scarre|first2=Christopher|authorlink2=Chris Scarre|title=The origins of metrology: collected papers of Dr. Daniel McLean McDonald|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8ujaAAAAMAAJ|accessdate=15 September 2012|year=1992|publisher=McDonald Institute for Archaeological Research}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}}&lt;ref name="Connor1987"&gt;{{cite book|author=R.

At least since [[classical antiquity|antiquity]], grains of [[wheat]] or [[barley]] were used by [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean traders]] to define units of mass; along with other seeds, especially those of the [[carob]] tree. According to a longstanding tradition, 1 [[Carat (unit)|carat]] (the mass of a carob seed) was equivalent to the weight of 4 wheat grains or 3 [[barley]]corns.&lt;ref name="Ridgeway1889"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ridgeway |first=William |authorlink=William Ridgeway |title=Metrological Notes: III.- Had the People of Pre-historic Mycenae a Weight Standard? |journal=[[The Journal of Hellenic Studies]] |volume=10 |year=1889 |pages=90–97 |publisher=The Council for the [[Society for the Promotion of Hellenic Studies]] |location=London |issn=0075-4269 |oclc=51205085 |doi=10.2307/623588 |jstor=623588}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|95}} Since the weights of these seeds are highly variable, especially that of the cereals as a function of moisture, this is a convention more than an absolute law.&lt;ref name="wms"&gt;{{cite book |last=Connor |first=R.D. |author2=Simpson, A.D.C. |title=Weights and Measures in Scotland |location=East Linton |year=c. 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|120–1}}

The history of the modern British grain can be traced back to a royal decree in thirteenth century England, re-iterating decrees that go back as far as [[Offa of Mercia|King Offa]] (eighth century).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zupko|first=Ronald Edward|title=British Weights and Measures|year=1977|publisher=University of Wisconsin |location=Madison |isbn=0-299-07340-8|pages=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The [[tower pound]] was one of many monetary pounds of 240 [[Silver penny|silver pennies]].
{{quote|By consent of the whole Realm the King's Measure was made, so that an [[Silver penny|English Penny]], which is called the Sterling, round without clipping, shall weigh Thirty-two Grains of Wheat dry in the midst of the Ear; Twenty pennies make an Ounce; and Twelve Ounces make a Pound.|[[Weights and Measures Acts (UK)#Acts of Parliament|Tractatus de Ponderibus et Mensuris]]|&lt;ref name="wms" /&gt;{{rp|119}}}}
The pound in question is the [[Tower pound]]. The Tower pound, abolished in 1527, consisted of 12 [[ounce]]s like the troy pound, but was {{frac|16}} (~6%) lighter. The weight of the original sterling pennies was 22½ troy grains, or 32 "Tower grains".&lt;ref name="wms" /&gt;{{rp|116}}

Physical grain weights were made and sold commercially at least as late as the early 1900s, and took various forms, from squares of sheet metal to manufactured wire shapes and coin-like weights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Grains of History |url=http://www.apothecariesweights.com/articles/the-grains-of-history/ |accessdate=2016-09-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[troy pound]] was only "the pound of Pence, Spices, Confections, as of [[wikt:electuary|Electuaries]]", as such goods might be measured by a ''troi'' or small balance.  The old troy standard was set by King Offa's [[Silver penny|currency reform]], was in full use in 1284 (Assize of Weights and Measures, King Edward I), but was restricted to currency (the pound of pennies) until it was abolished in 1527.  This pound was progressively replaced by a new pound, based on the weight of 120 gold [[dirhem]]s of 48 grains.  The new pound used a barley-corn grain, rather than the wheat grain.&lt;ref name=watson1910&gt;{{cite book|last=Watson|first=C. M.|title=British Weights and Measures|year=1910|publisher=John Murry|location=London|pages=32–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avoirdupois (goods of weight) refers to those things measured by the lesser but quicker balances: the bismar or uncel, the Roman balance, and the [[steelyard balance|steelyard]].  The original mercantile pound of 25 shillings or 15 (tower) ounces was displaced by variously the pound of the Hanseatic League (16 tower ounces) and by the pound of the then-important wool trade (16 ounces of 437 grains).  A new pound of {{val|7680}} grains was inadvertently created as 16 troy ounces, referring to the new troy rather than the old troy.  Eventually, the wool pound won out.&lt;ref name="watson1910"/&gt;

The [[avoirdupois pound]] was defined in prototype, rated as {{val|6992}} to {{val|7004}} grains.  In the Imperial Weights and Measures Act of 1824, the avoirdupois pound was defined as {{val|7000}} grains exactly.  The act of 1855 authorised Miller's new standards to replace those lost in the fire that destroyed the [[Burning of Parliament|Houses of Parliament]].  The standard was an avoirdupois pound, the grain being defined as {{sfrac|{{val|7000}}}} of it.

The division of the carat into four grains survives in both senses well into the early twentieth century.  For pearls and diamonds, weight is quoted in carats, divided into four grains.  The carat was eventually set to 205 milligrams (1877), and later 200 milligrams. For touch or fineness of gold, the fraction of gold was given as a weight, the total being a solidus of 24 carats or 96 grains.&lt;ref name=Woodhouse&gt;{{cite book|last=Woolhouse|first=W. S. B.|title=Measures, Weights and Measures of all Nations|year=1890|publisher=Crosby Lockwood and Son|location=London|pages=33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Haplocambids''' (Great Group: Haplocambids-sub Order Cambids-Order: [[Aridisols]]) is a soil Taxonomy  great group. Soil with 0-5 slopes over 5&amp;nbsp;°C temperature and [[loam]] soil structure is Haplocambids. Almost cold condition and high altitude soil classified into this group.  These soil types are the most commonly occurring of the Cambids. The soils are characterized by minimal horizon expression. Most Haplocambids have a redistribution of carbonates below the cambic horizon. The amount of [[carbonates]], however, is insufficient to meet the definition of a calcic horizon, or the upper boundary is more than 100&amp;nbsp;cm below the soil surface. These soils occur on a variety of landscapes, commonly on those that are younger than late [[Pleistocene]] in age. 
Haplocambids are divided into 22 suborders.

H. The Early Actinides: the Periodic System’s f Electron Transition Metal Series, in Plutonium 1970 and Other Actinides (AIME, New York, 1970)&lt;/ref&gt;. These atoms own partially filled &lt;math&gt;4f&lt;/math&gt; or &lt;math&gt;5f&lt;/math&gt; levels in their [[Electron_shell#Valence_shell|valence shell]] and are therefore responsible for the main interaction between each atom and its environment. In this context, the hill limit &lt;math&gt;r_H&lt;/math&gt; is defined as twice the [[Atomic_radius#Lanthanide_contraction|radius]] of the &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-orbital&lt;ref&gt;see introduction in http://arxiv.org/abs/1705.00846v1&lt;/ref&gt;. Therefore, if two atoms of the lattice are separate by a distance greater than the Hill limit, the [[Orbital_overlap|overlap]] of their &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;-orbital becomes negligible. A direct consequence is the absence of hopping for the f electrons, ie their localization on the ion sites of the lattice.

Localized f electrons lead to [[Paramagnetism#d_and_f_electrons|paramagnetic]] materials since the remaining unpaired spins are stuck in their orbitals. However, when the rare-earth lattice (or a single atom) is embedded in a metallic one ([[Intermetallic|intermetallic compound]]), interactions with the conduction band allow the f electrons to move through the lattice even for interatomic distances above the Hill limit.

'''Holmium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol '''Ho''' and [[atomic number]] 67. Part of the [[lanthanide series]], holmium is a [[rare-earth element]]. Holmium was discovered by Swedish chemist [[Per Theodor Cleve]]. Its oxide was first isolated from rare-earth ores in 1878. The element's name comes from ''Holmia'', the Latin name for the city of [[Stockholm]].

Elemental holmium is a relatively soft and malleable silvery-white [[metal]]. It is too reactive to be found uncombined in nature, but when isolated, is relatively stable in dry air at room temperature. However, it reacts with water and corrodes readily and also burns in air when heated.

Holmium is found in the minerals [[monazite]] and [[gadolinite]] and is usually commercially extracted from monazite using [[ion-exchange]] techniques. Its compounds in nature and in nearly all of its laboratory chemistry are trivalently oxidized, containing Ho(III) ions. Trivalent holmium ions have fluorescent properties similar to many other rare-earth ions (while yielding their own set of unique emission light lines), and thus are used in the same way as some other rare earths in certain laser and glass-colorant applications.

Holmium has the highest [[magnetic permeability]] of any element and therefore is used for the [[polepiece]]s of the strongest static [[magnet]]s. Because holmium strongly absorbs neutrons, it is also used as a [[burnable poison]] in nuclear reactors.

==Characteristics==

===Physical properties===
[[Image:Holmium(III) oxide.jpg|thumb|left|Ho&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, left: natural light, right: under a [[cold-cathode]] fluorescent lamp]]
Holmium is a relatively soft and malleable element that is fairly [[corrosion]]-resistant and stable in dry air at [[standard temperature and pressure]]. In moist air and at higher [[temperature]]s, however, it quickly [[oxidation|oxidizes]], forming a yellowish oxide. In pure form, holmium possesses a metallic, bright silvery luster.

[[Holmium(III) oxide|Holmium oxide]] has some fairly dramatic color changes depending on the lighting conditions. In daylight, it has a tannish yellow color. Under trichromatic light, it is fiery orange-red, almost indistinguishable from the appearance of erbium oxide under the same lighting conditions. The perceived color change is related to the sharp absorption bands of holmium interacting with a subset of the sharp emission bands of the trivalent ions of europium and terbium, acting as phosphors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| doi=10.1246/cl.2008.762| title=Hydrothermal Synthesis of GdVO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;:Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; Nanorods with a Novel White-light Emission| date=2008| author=Yiguo Su| journal=Chemistry Letters| volume=37| pages=762–763| issue=7| last2=Li| first2=Guangshe| last3=Chen| first3=Xiaobo| last4=Liu| first4=Junjie| last5=Li| first5=Liping}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmium has the highest [[magnetic moment]] ({{val|10.6|ul=µB}}) of any naturally occurring element and possesses other unusual magnetic properties. When combined with [[yttrium]], it forms highly [[magnetism|magnetic]] compounds.&lt;ref name=appl/&gt; Holmium is [[paramagnetic]] at ambient conditions, but is [[ferromagnetic]] at temperatures below {{val|19|ul=K}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introduction to magnetism and magnetic materials|author=Jiles, David|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=axyWXjsdorMC&amp;pg=PA228|page=228|publisher=CRC Press|date=1998|isbn=0-412-79860-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemical properties===
Holmium metal tarnishes slowly in air and burns readily to form [[holmium(III) oxide]]:
:4 Ho + 3 O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 Ho&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;

Holmium is quite electropositive and is generally trivalent. It reacts slowly with cold water and quite quickly with hot water to form holmium hydroxide:
:2 Ho (s) + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O (l) → 2 Ho(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Holmium metal reacts with all the halogens:
:2 Ho (s) + 3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 HoF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [pink]
:2 Ho (s) + 3 Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 [[Holmium(III) chloride|HoCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]] (s) [yellow]
:2 Ho (s) + 3 Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 HoBr&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [yellow]
:2 Ho (s) + 3 I&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g) → 2 HoI&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (s) [yellow]

Holmium dissolves readily in dilute [[sulfuric acid]] to form solutions containing the yellow Ho(III) ions, which exist as a [Ho(OH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; complexes:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url =https://www.webelements.com/holmium/chemistry.html| title =Chemical reactions of Holmium| publisher=Webelements| accessdate=2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:2 Ho (s) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;SO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (aq) → 2 Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; (aq) + 3 {{chem|SO|4|2-}} (aq) + 3 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (g)

Holmium's most common oxidation state is +3. Holmium in [[solution]] is in the form of Ho&lt;sup&gt;3+&lt;/sup&gt; surrounded by nine molecules of water. Holmium dissolves in acids.&lt;ref name="nature's building blocks"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks|date=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of holmium}}
[[Nature|Natural]] holmium contains one [[stable]] [[isotope]], holmium-165. Some synthetic radioactive isotopes are known; the most stable one is holmium-163, with a half-life of 4570 years. All other radioisotopes have ground-state half-lives not greater than 1.117 days, and most have half-lives under 3 hours. However, the [[metastable]] &lt;sup&gt;166m1&lt;/sup&gt;Ho has a half-life of around 1200 years because of its high [[spin (physics)|spin]]. This fact, combined with a high excitation energy resulting in a particularly rich spectrum of decay [[gamma ray]]s produced when the metastable state de-excites, makes this isotope useful in [[nuclear physics]] experiments as a means for calibrating energy responses and intrinsic efficiencies of [[gamma ray spectrometer]]s.

==History==
Holmium (''Holmia'', [[Latin]] name for [[Stockholm]]) was [[discovery of the chemical elements|discovered]] by [[Jacques-Louis Soret]] and [[Marc Delafontaine]] in 1878 who noticed the aberrant [[Spectrophotometry|spectrographic]] [[absorption band]]s of the then-unknown element (they called it "Element X").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Sur les spectres d'absorption ultra-violets des terres de la gadolinite|author = Jacques-Louis Soret|journal = Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|volume = 87|pages = 1062|date = 1878|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3043m/f1124.table}}
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Sur le spectre des terres faisant partie du groupe de l'yttria
|author = Jacques-Louis Soret|journal = Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences
|volume = 89|pages = 521|date = 1879|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3046j/f550.table}}
&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, [[Per Teodor Cleve]] independently discovered the element while he was working on [[erbia]] earth ([[erbium oxide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|title = Sur deux nouveaux éléments dans l'erbine|author = Per Teodor Cleve
|journal = Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|volume = 89|pages = 478–480
|date = 1879|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3046j/f432.table}}  Cleve named holmium on p. p. 480:  ''"Je propose pour ce métal le nom de ''holmium'', Ho, dérivé du nom latinisé de Stockholm, dont les environs renferment tant de minéraux riches en yttria."'' (I propose for this metal the name of "holmium", Ho, [which is] derived from the Latin name for Stockholm, the environs of which contain so many minerals rich in yttrium.) 
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title = Sur l'erbine|author = Per Teodor Cleve
|journal = Comptes rendus de l'Académie des sciences|volume = 89|pages = 708|date = 1879
|url = http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k3046j/f759.table}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Using the method developed by [[Carl Gustaf Mosander]], Cleve first removed all of the known contaminants from erbia. The result of that effort was two new materials, one brown and one green. He named the brown substance holmia (after the Latin name for Cleve's home town, Stockholm) and the green one thulia. Holmia was later found to be the [[holmium oxide]], and thulia was [[thulium oxide]].&lt;ref name=history/&gt;
In [[Henry Moseley]]'s classic paper{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} on atomic numbers, holmium was assigned an atomic number of 66.  Evidently, the holmium preparation he had been given to investigate had been grossly impure, dominated by neighboring (and unplotted) dysprosium. He would have seen x-ray emission lines for both elements, but assumed that the dominant ones belonged to holmium, instead of the dysprosium impurity.

==Occurrence and production==
[[File:Gadolinitas.jpg|thumb|[[Gadolinite]] ]]
Like all other rare earths, holmium is not naturally found as a free element. It does occur combined with other elements in [[gadolinite]] (the black part of the specimen illustrated to the right), [[monazite]] and other rare-earth minerals. No holmium-dominant mineral has yet been found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mindat.org/ |title=Mindat.org |author=Hudson Institute of Mineralogy |date=1993–2018 |website=www.mindat.org |access-date=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main mining areas are [[China]], [[United States]], [[Brazil]], [[India]], [[Sri Lanka]], and [[Australia]] with reserves of holmium estimated as 400,000 tonnes.&lt;ref name=history&gt;{{cite book| pages=181–182| url =https://books.google.com/books?id=Yhi5X7OwuGkC&amp;pg=PA181| title =Nature's building blocks: an A-Z guide to the elements| author =John Emsley| publisher=Oxford University Press |location =US| date = 2001| isbn = 0-19-850341-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmium makes up 1.4 parts per million of the [[Earth's crust]] by mass. This makes it the 56th most abundant element in the Earth's crust. Holmium makes up 1 part per million of the [[soil]]s, 400 parts per quadrillion of [[seawater]], and almost none of [[Earth's atmosphere]]. Holmium is rare for a lanthanide.&lt;ref name="Nature's Building Blocks"&gt;{{cite book|last=Emsley|first=John|title=Nature's Building Blocks|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; It makes up 500 parts per trillion of the [[universe]] by mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webelements.com/periodicity/abundance_universe/.|title=WebElements Periodic Table » Periodicity » Abundance in the universe » periodicity|first=Mark Winter, University of Sheffield and WebElements|last=Ltd|date=|website=www.webelements.com|accessdate=27 March 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170929183039/https://www.webelements.com/periodicity/abundance_universe/|archive-date=2017-09-29|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is commercially extracted by [[ion exchange]] from monazite sand (0.05% holmium), but is still difficult to separate from other rare earths. The element has been isolated through the [[redox|reduction]] of its anhydrous [[chloride]] or [[fluoride]] with metallic [[calcium]].&lt;ref name=CRC/&gt; Its estimated abundance in the Earth's crust is 1.3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg. Holmium obeys the [[Oddo–Harkins rule]]: as an odd-numbered element, it is less abundant than its immediate even-numbered neighbors, [[dysprosium]] and [[erbium]]. However, it is the most abundant of the odd-numbered heavy [[lanthanides]]. The principal current source are some of the ion-adsorption clays of southern China. Some of these have a rare-earth composition similar to that found in [[xenotime]] or gadolinite. [[Yttrium]] makes up about 2/3 of the total by mass; holmium is around 1.5%. The original ores themselves are very lean, maybe only 0.1% total lanthanide, but are easily extracted.&lt;ref name=patnaik&gt;{{cite book|last =Patnaik|first =Pradyot|date = 2003|title =Handbook of Inorganic Chemical Compounds|publisher = McGraw-Hill|pages = 338–339| isbn =0-07-049439-8|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=Xqj-TTzkvTEC&amp;pg=PA338|accessdate = 2009-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Holmium is relatively inexpensive for a rare-earth metal with the price about 1000&amp;nbsp;[[USD]]/kg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| publisher = USGS| title =Rare-Earth Metals| author = James B.

==Applications==
[[File:HoOxideSolution.jpg|thumb|A solution of 4% holmium oxide in 10% perchloric acid, permanently fused into a quartz cuvette as an optical calibration standard]]
Holmium has the highest magnetic strength of any element, and therefore is used to create the strongest artificially generated [[magnetic field]]s, when placed within high-strength magnets as a magnetic pole piece (also called a [[magnetic flux concentrator]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?arnumber=01063692| journal =IEEE Transactions on Magnetics| volume = 21| date =1985|title =FIELD ENHANCEMENT OF A 12.5-T MAGNET USING HOLMIUM POLES| display-authors = 6| author = R.

Holmium is used in yttrium-[[iron]]-[[garnet]] (YIG) and yttrium-[[lanthanum]]-fluoride (YLF) [[solid-state laser]]s found in [[microwave]] equipment (which are in turn found in a variety of medical and dental settings).

In March 2017, [[IBM]] announced that they have developed a technique to store one [[bit]] of data on a single Holmium atom set on a bed of [[magnesium oxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://techcrunch.com/2017/03/08/storing-data-in-a-single-atom-proved-possible-by-ibm-researchers/| accessdate=2017-03-10| title =Storing data in a single atom proved possible by IBM researchers}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biological role==
Holmium plays no biological role in [[human]]s, but its salts are able to stimulate [[metabolism]].&lt;ref name=CRC&gt;{{cite book| author = C. R. Hammond |title = The Elements, in Handbook of Chemistry and Physics |edition = 81st| publisher =CRC press| date = 2000| isbn = 0-8493-0481-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Humans typically consume about a milligram of holmium a year. Plants do not readily take up holmium from the soil. Some vegetables have had their holmium content measured, and it amounted to 100 parts per trillion.&lt;ref name="nature's building blocks"/&gt;

===Toxicity===
Large amounts of holmium [[salt (chemistry)|salts]] can cause severe damage if [[inhaled]], consumed [[mouth|orally]], or [[injection (medicine)|injected]]. The biological effects of holmium over a long period of time are not known. Holmium has a low level of acute toxicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nautilus.fis.uc.pt/st2.5/scenes-e/elem/e06740.html "Holmium"] in ''Periodic Table v2.5''. University of Coimbra, Portugal&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15841">The '''Huzita–Hatori axioms''' or '''Huzita–Justin axioms''' are a set of rules related to the [[Mathematics of paper folding|mathematical principles of paper folding]], describing the operations that can be made when folding a piece of paper. The axioms assume that the operations are completed on a plane (i.e. a perfect piece of paper), and that all folds are linear. These are not a minimal set of axioms but rather the complete set of possible single folds.

The axioms were first discovered by Jacques Justin in 1986.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Justin|first=Jacques|date=1986|title=Résolution par le pliage de l’équation du troisième degré et applications géométriques|url=https://mathinfo.unistra.fr/fileadmin/upload/IREM/Publications/L_Ouvert/n042/o_42_9-19.pdf|journal=L’Ouvert - Journal de l’APMEP d’Alsace et de l’IREM de Strasbourg|language=French|volume=42|issue=|pages=9–19|doi=|pmid=|access-date=September 7, 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Axioms 1 through 6 were rediscovered by [[Japanese people|Japanese]]-[[Italy|Italian]] mathematician [[Humiaki Huzita]] and reported at ''the First International Conference on Origami in Education and Therapy'' in 1991. Axioms 1 though 5 were rediscovered by Auckly and Cleveland in 1995. Axiom 7 was rediscovered by Koshiro Hatori in 2001; [[Robert J. Lang]] also found axiom 7.

==The seven axioms==
The first 6 axioms are known as Huzita's axioms. Axiom 7 was discovered by Koshiro Hatori. Jacques Justin and [[Robert J. Lang]] also found axiom 7. The axioms are as follows:

Axiom 5 may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions, while Axiom 6 may have 0, 1, 2, or 3 solutions. In this way, the resulting geometries of origami are stronger than the geometries of [[compass and straightedge]], where the maximum number of solutions an axiom has is 2. Thus compass and straightedge geometry solves second-degree equations, while origami geometry, or origametry, can solve third-degree equations, and solve problems such as [[angle trisection]] and [[doubling of the cube]]. The construction of the fold guaranteed by Axiom 6 requires "sliding" the paper, or [[neusis]], which is not allowed in classical compass and straightedge constructions. Use of neusis together with a compass and straightedge does allow trisection of an arbitrary angle.

==Details==

===Axiom 1===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that passes through both of them.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 1.png|Folding a line through two points]]

In parametric form, the equation for the line that passes through the two points is :

:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=p_1 +s(p_2 - p_1).&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 2===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 2.png|Folding a line putting one point on another]]

This is equivalent to finding the perpendicular bisector of the line segment ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. This can be done in four steps:

* Use '''Axiom 1''' to find the line through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, given by &lt;math&gt;P(s)=p_1+s(p_2-p_1)&lt;/math&gt;
* Find the [[midpoint]] of ''p''&lt;sub&gt;mid&lt;/sub&gt; of ''P''(''s'')
* Find the vector '''v'''&lt;sup&gt;perp&lt;/sup&gt; perpendicular to ''P''(''s'')
* The [[parametric equation]] of the fold is then:
:&lt;math&gt;F(s)=p_\mathrm{mid} + s\cdot\mathbf{v}^{\mathrm{perp}}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 3===
Given two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 3.png|Folding a line putting one line on another]]

This is equivalent to finding a bisector of the angle between ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Let ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be any two points on ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and let ''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; be any two points on ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Also, let '''u''' and '''v''' be the unit direction vectors of ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively; that is:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u} = (p_2-p_1) / \left|(p_2-p_1)\right|&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v} = (q_2-q_1) / \left|(q_2-q_1)\right|.&lt;/math&gt;

If the two lines are not parallel, their point of intersection is:

:&lt;math&gt;p_\mathrm{int} = p_1+s_\mathrm{int}\cdot\mathbf{u}&lt;/math&gt;

where

:&lt;math&gt;s_{int} = -\frac{\mathbf{v}^{\perp} \cdot (p_1 - q_1)} {\mathbf{v}^{\perp} \cdot \mathbf{u}}.&lt;/math&gt;

The direction of one of the bisectors is then:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{w} = \frac{
\left|\mathbf{u}\right| \mathbf{v} +
\left|\mathbf{v}\right| \mathbf{u}}
{\left|\mathbf{u}\right| +
\left|\mathbf{v}\right|}.&lt;/math&gt;

And the parametric equation of the fold is:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = p_\mathrm{int} + s\cdot\mathbf{w}.&lt;/math&gt;

A second bisector also exists, perpendicular to the first and passing through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;int&lt;/sub&gt;. Folding along this second bisector will also achieve the desired result of placing ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. It may not be possible to perform one or the other of these folds, depending on the location of the intersection point.

If the two lines are parallel, they have no point of intersection. The fold must be the line midway between ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and parallel to them.

===Axiom 4===
Given a point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and a line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a unique fold perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that passes through point ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 4.png|Folding through a point perpendicular to a line]]

This is equivalent to finding a perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; that passes through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If we find some vector '''v''' that is perpendicular to the line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, then the parametric equation of the fold is:

:&lt;math&gt;F(s) = p_1 + s\cdot\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 5===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and a line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and passes through ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 5.png|Folding a point onto a line through another point]]

This axiom is equivalent to finding the intersection of a line with a circle, so it may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions. The line is defined by ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, and the circle has its center at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and a radius equal to the distance from ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; to ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. If the line does not intersect the circle, there are no solutions. If the line is tangent to the circle, there is one solution, and if the line intersects the circle in two places, there are two solutions.

If we know two points on the line, (''x''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;) and (''x''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, ''y''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), then the line can be expressed parametrically as:

:&lt;math&gt;x = x_1 + s(x_2 - x_1)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;y = y_1 + s(y_2 - y_1).&lt;/math&gt;

Let the circle be defined by its center at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;=(''x&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''y&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;''), with radius &lt;math&gt;r = \left|p_1 - p_2\right|&lt;/math&gt;. Then the circle can be expressed as:

:&lt;math&gt;(x-x_c)^2 + (y-y_c)^2 = r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to determine the points of intersection of the line with the circle, we substitute the ''x'' and ''y'' components of the equations for the line into the equation for the circle, giving:

:&lt;math&gt;(x_1 + s(x_2-x_1) - x_c)^2 + (y_1 + s(y_2 - y_1) - y_c)^2 = r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Or, simplified:

:&lt;math&gt;as^2 + bs + c = 0&lt;/math&gt;

where:

:&lt;math&gt;a = (x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;b = 2(x_2 - x_1)(x_1 - x_c) + 2(y_2 - y_1)(y_1 - y_c)&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;c = x_c^2 + y_c^2 + x_1^2 + y_1^2 - 2(x_c x_1 + y_c y_1)-r^2.&lt;/math&gt;

Then we simply solve the quadratic equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{-b\pm\sqrt{b^2-4ac}}{2a}.&lt;/math&gt;

If the discriminant ''b''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;−&amp;nbsp;4''ac'' &amp;lt; 0, there are no solutions. The circle does not intersect or touch the line. If the discriminant is equal to 0, then there is a single solution, where the line is tangent to the circle. And if the discriminant is greater than 0, there are two solutions, representing the two points of intersection. Let us call the solutions ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, if they exist. We have 0, 1, or 2 line segments:

:&lt;math&gt;m_1 = \overline{p_1 d_1} &lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;m_2 = \overline{p_1 d_2}. &lt;/math&gt;

A fold ''F''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') perpendicular to ''m''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; through its midpoint will place ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the line at location ''d''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;. Similarly, a fold ''F''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(''s'') perpendicular to ''m''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; through its midpoint will place ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; on the line at location ''d''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. The application of Axiom 2 easily accomplishes this. The parametric equations of the folds are thus:

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{align}
F_1(s) &amp; = p_1 +\frac{1}{2}(d_1-p_1)+s(d_1-p_1)^\perp \\[8pt]
F_2(s) &amp; = p_1 +\frac{1}{2}(d_2-p_1)+s(d_2-p_1)^\perp.
\end{align}
&lt;/math&gt;

===Axiom 6===
Given two points ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita axiom 6.png]]

This axiom is equivalent to finding a line simultaneously tangent to two parabolas, and can be considered equivalent to solving a third-degree equation as there are in general three solutions. The two parabolas have foci at ''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively, with directrices defined by ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, respectively.

This fold is called the Beloch fold after [[Margherita Piazzola Beloch | Margharita P. Beloch]], who in 1936 showed using it that origami can be used to solve general cubic equations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Solving Cubics With Creases: The Work of Beloch and Lill |author=Thomas C. Hull |url=http://mars.wne.edu/~thull/papers/amer.math.monthly.118.04.307-hull.pdf |journal=American Mathematical Monthly |date=April 2011 |pages=307–315|doi=10.4169/amer.math.monthly.118.04.307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Axiom 7===
Given one point ''p'' and two lines ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, there is a fold that places ''p'' onto ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and is perpendicular to ''l''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Image:Huzita-Hatori axiom 7.png]]

This axiom was originally discovered by Jacques Justin in 1989 but was overlooked and was rediscovered by Koshiro Hatori in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=One-, Two-, and Multi-Fold Origami Axioms |url=http://www.math.sjsu.edu/~alperin/AlperinLang.pdf |author1=Roger C. Alperin |author2=Robert J. Lang |journal=4OSME |publisher=A K Peters |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Robert J. Lang]] has proven that this list of axioms completes the axioms of origami.

==Constructibility==
Subsets of the axioms  can be used to construct different sets of numbers. The first three can be used with three given points not on a line to do what Alperin calls Thalian constructions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Mathematical Theory of Origami Constructions and Numbers |first1=Roger C |last1=Alperin |journal=New York Journal of Mathematics |year=2000 |volume=6 |pages=119–133 |url=http://nyjm.albany.edu/j/2000/6-8.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first four axioms with two given points define a system weaker than [[compass and straightedge constructions]]: every shape that can be folded with those axioms can be constructed with compass and straightedge, but some things can be constructed by compass and straightedge that cannot be folded with those axioms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=D. Auckly and J. Cleveland|title=Totally real origami and impossible paperfolding|journal=American Mathematical Monthly|volume=102|pages=215–226|arxiv=math/0407174|doi=10.2307/2975008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The numbers that can be constructed are called the origami or pythagorean numbers, if the distance between the two given points is 1 then the constructible points are all of the form &lt;math&gt;(\alpha,\beta)&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\beta&lt;/math&gt; are Pythagorean numbers. The Pythagorean numbers are given by the smallest field containing the rational numbers and &lt;math&gt;\sqrt{1+\alpha^2}&lt;/math&gt; whenever &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is such a number.

Adding the fifth axiom gives the [[Euclidean number]]s, that is the points constructible by [[Compass-and-straightedge_construction|compass and straightedge construction]].

Adding the [[Neusis construction|neusis]] axiom 6, all compass-straightedge constructions, and more, can be made.  In particular, the [[Constructible polygon|constructible]] regular polygons with these axioms are those with &lt;math&gt;2^a3^b\rho\ge3&lt;/math&gt; sides, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is a product of distinct [[Pierpont prime]]s.  Compass-straightedge constructions allow only those with  &lt;math&gt;2^a\phi\ge3&lt;/math&gt; sides, where &lt;math&gt;\phi&lt;/math&gt; is a product of distinct [[Fermat prime]]s.  (Fermat primes are a [[subset]] of Pierpont primes.)

The seventh axiom does not allow construction of further axioms. The seven axioms give all the single-fold constructions that can be done rather than being a minimal set of axioms.

== An eighth axiom ==
The existence of an eighth axiom was claimed by Lucero in 2017, which may be stated as: there is a fold along a given line ''l''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lucero|first=Jorge C.|date=2017|title=On the Elementary Single-Fold Operations of Origami: Reflections and Incidence Constraints on the Plane|url=http://forumgeom.fau.edu/FG2017volume17/FG201725.pdf|journal=Forum Geometricorum|volume=17|pages=207-221|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The new axiom was found after enumerating all possible incidences between constructible points and lines on a plane.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://getd.libs.uga.edu/pdfs/lee_hwa-young_201712_ma.pdf|title=Origami-Constructible Numbers|last=Lee|first=Hwa Y.|publisher=University of Georgia|year=2017|isbn=|location=|pages=64|type=Master's Thesis}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it does not create a new line, it is nevertheless needed in actual paper folding when it is required to fold a layer of paper along a line marked on the layer immediately below.

The '''Hárskút Wind Farm''' was a wind power project in [[Veszprém (county)|Veszprém County]], [[Hungary]]. It was to have 30 individual [[wind turbine]]s&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebrdrenewables.com/sites/renew/Lists/Projects/DispForm.aspx?ID=721&amp;Source=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eebrdrenewables%2Ecom%2Fsites%2Frenew%2Fcountries%2FHungary%2Fdefault%2Easpx Hárskút Wind Farm]&lt;/ref&gt; with a nominal output of 1.5 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] which would have delivered up to 45 MW of power, allegedly enough to power over 18,100 homes, with a capital investment required of approximately US$60 million.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1624">'''Laminate panel''' is a type of manufactured timber made from thin sheets of substrates or [[wood veneer]]. It is similar to the more widely used [[plywood]], except that it has a plastic, protective layer on one or both sides. Laminate panels are used instead of plywood because of their resistance to impact, weather, moisture, shattering in cold (ductility), and chemicals.

Laminate panel layers (called veneers) are glued together with adjacent plies having their [[wood grain|grain]] at right angles to each other for greater strength. The plastic layer(s) added for protection vary in composition, thickness, color and texture according to the application.

== Types ==

A number of varieties of laminate panel exist for different applications.
*Plywood + ABS pipes
 panels
*Plywood + FRP laminate panels 
*Plywood + aluminum laminated panels
*Lightweight composite panels

==Sizes==
The most commonly used thickness range from 1/8" to 1/2" and 3/8", in a variety of colours and textures.

== Applications ==
Laminate panels are used in many applications that need weather-proof, impact resistant sheet material. Typical end uses of spruce plywood are:
*Floors, walls and roofs in [[cleanroom]]s
*Vehicle internal body work
*Packages and boxes
*[[Road case]]s

'''Local density of states''' (LDOS) is a physical quantity that describes the [[density of states]], but space-resolved. In materials science, this term is useful when interpreting the data from an [[Scanning_tunneling_microscope|STM]], since this method is capable of imaging electron densities of states with atomic resolution. According to crystal's structure, this quantity can be predicted by computational methods, as for example with [[density functional theory]].

[[File:Omen ldos v3.gif|thumb|300px|right|Space resolved local density of states. A sequence of images with varying gate bias in a nanowire MOSFET at drain bias Vd=0.6V. Notice the confined energy levels as they move with increasing gate bias.]]
==LDOS in solid state devices==

Local density of states can be used to gain insights into a solid-state device. For example, the figure on the right illustrates LDOS of a [[transistor]] as it turns on and off in a ballistic simulation. The LDOS has clear boundary in the source and drain, that corresponds to the location of bandedge. In the channel, the DOS is increasing as gate voltage increase and potential barrier goes down. 

In optics and photonics the concept of local density of states refers to the states that can be occupied by a photon. For light it is usually measured by fluorescence methods, near-field scanning methods or by cathodoluminescence techniques.

'''Microemulsions''' are clear, thermodynamically stable, [[isotropic]] liquid mixtures of oil, water and [[surfactant]], frequently in combination with a [[cosurfactant]]. The aqueous [[Phase (matter)|phase]] may contain [[salt]](s) and/or other ingredients, and the "oil" may actually be a complex mixture of different [[hydrocarbon]]s and [[olefins]].  In contrast to ordinary [[emulsion]]s, microemulsions form upon simple mixing of the components and do not require the high [[Shear (fluid)|shear]] conditions generally used in the formation of ordinary emulsions.  The three basic types of microemulsions are direct (oil dispersed in water, o/w), reversed (water dispersed in oil, w/o) and bicontinuous.

In ternary systems such as microemulsions, where two immiscible phases (water and ‘oil’) are present with a surfactant, the [[surfactant]] [[molecule]]s may form a [[monolayer]] at the interface between the oil and water, with the [[hydrophobe|hydrophobic]] tails of the surfactant molecules dissolved in the oil phase and the hydrophilic head groups in the aqueous phase.

 |quote = '''Micro-emulsion''': Dispersion made of water, oil, and surfactant(s) that is an&lt;br/&gt;
isotropic and thermodynamically stable system with dispersed domain diameter varying&lt;br/&gt;
approximately from 1 to 100 nm, usually 10 to 50 nm.

''Note 1'': In a micro-emulsion the domains of the ''dispersed phase'' are either globular&lt;br/&gt;
or interconnected (to give a bicontinuous micro-emulsion).

''Note 2'': The average diameter of droplets in macro-emulsion (usually referred to as an&lt;br/&gt;
“''emulsion''”) is close to one millimeter (i.e., 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; m). Therefore, since micro- means 10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;br/&gt;
and emulsion implies that droplets of the dispersed phase have diameters close to 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; m,&lt;br/&gt;
the micro-emulsion denotes a system with the size range of the dispersed phase in the&lt;br/&gt;10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; × 10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; m = 10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; m range.

''Note 3'': The term “micro-emulsion” has come to take on special meaning. Entities of&lt;br/&gt;
the dispersed phase are usually stabilized by surfactant and/or surfactant-cosurfactant&lt;br/&gt;(e.g., aliphatic alcohol) systems.

''Note 4'': The term “oil” refers to any water-insoluble liquid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Terminology of polymers and polymerization processes in dispersed systems (IUPAC Recommendations 2011)|journal=[[Pure and Applied Chemistry]]|date=2011|volume=83|issue=12|pages=2229–2259|doi=10.1351/PAC-REC-10-06-03|url=http://pac.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/2011/pdf/8312x2229.pdf | last1 = Slomkowski | first1 = Stanislaw}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Uses==

Microemulsions have many commercially important uses:

* Water-in-oil microemulsions for some [[dry cleaning]] processes
* Floor [[polishing|polishers]] and [[Cleanliness|cleaners]]
* [[Personal care]] products
* [[Pesticide]] formulations
* [[Cutting oil]]s
* [[Drugs]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1517/17425247.2012.694865 | volume=9 | title=Microemulsions for oral administration and their therapeutic applications | year=2012 | journal=Expert Opinion on Drug Delivery | pages=937–951 | last1 = Gibaud | first1 = Stéphane| url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00706176/file/Microemulsion%20oral%20delivery.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of the work done on these systems have been motivated by their possible use to mobilize petroleum trapped in porous sandstone for [[enhanced oil recovery]]. A fundamental reason for the uses of these systems is that a microemulsion phase sometimes has an ultralow [[interfacial tension]] with a separate oil or aqueous phase, which may release or mobilize them from solid phases even in conditions of slow flow or low pressure gradients.

Microemulsions also have industrial applications, one of them being the synthesis of [[polymer]]s. Microemulsion [[polymerization]] is a complex heterogeneous process where transport of monomers, free radicals and other species (such as chain transfer agent, co-surfactant and inhibitors) between the aqueous and organic phases, takes place.&lt;ref&gt;"A Microemulsion Process for Producing Acrylamide-Alkyl Acrylamide Copolymers", S. R.
Turner, D. B. Siano and J. Bock, U. S. Patent No. 4,521,580, June 1985.&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with other heterogeneous polymerization processes (suspension or emulsion) microemulsion polymerization is a more complicated system. Polymerization rate is controlled by monomer partitioning between the phases, particle nucleation, and adsorption and desorption of radicals. Particle stability is affected by the amount and type of surfactant and pH of dispersing medium.&lt;ref&gt;Ovando V.M. Polymer Bulletin 2005, 54, 129-140&lt;/ref&gt;
It is also used in the process of creating nanoparticles.

The kinetics of microemulsion polymerization has much in common with emulsion polymerization kinetics, the most characteristic feature of which is the compartmentalization, where the radicals growing inside the particles are separated from each other, thus suppressing termination to a high extent and, as a consequence, providing high rates of polymerization.

==Theory==
Various theories concerning microemulsion formation, stability and phase behavior have been proposed over the years.  For example, one explanation for their thermodynamic stability is that the oil/water dispersion is stabilized by the surfactant present and their formation involves the elastic properties of the surfactant film at the oil/water interface, which involves as parameters, the curvature and the rigidity of the film.  These parameters may have an assumed or measured pressure and/or temperature dependence (and/or the salinity of the aqueous phase), which may be used to infer the region of stability of the microemulsion, or to delineate the region where three coexisting phases occur, for example.  Calculations of the interfacial tension of the microemulsion with a coexisting oil or aqueous phase are also often of special focus and may sometimes be used to guide their formulation.

==History and terminology==

The term microemulsion was first used by T. P. Hoar and J. H. Shulman, professors of chemistry at [[Cambridge University]], in 1943.  Alternative names for these systems are often used, such as  '''transparent emulsion''', '''swollen micelle''', '''micellar solution''', and '''solubilized oil'''.  More confusingly still, the term microemulsion can refer to the single isotropic phase that is a mixture of oil, water and surfactant, or to one that is in equilibrium with coexisting predominantly oil and/or aqueous phases, or even to other non-isotropic phases.  As in the binary systems (water/surfactant or oil/surfactant), self-assembled structures of different types can be formed, ranging, for example, from (inverted) spherical and cylindrical [[micelles]] to [[lamellar]] phases and bicontinuous microemulsions, which may coexist with predominantly oil or aqueous phases.
&lt;ref&gt;T. P. Hoar et al., Nature, 1943, (152), 102-103.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phase diagrams==
Microemulsion domains are usually characterized by constructing ternary-phase diagrams.
Three components are the basic requirement to form a microemulsion: two immiscible liquids and a surfactant.  The majority of microemulsions use oil and water as immiscible liquid pairs. If a cosurfactant is used, it may sometimes be represented at a fixed ratio to surfactant as a single component, and treated as a single "pseudo-component".  The relative amounts of these three components can be represented in a ternary [[phase diagram]].  [[Josiah Willard Gibbs|Gibbs]] phase diagrams can be used to show the influence of changes in the volume fractions of the different phases on the phase behavior of the system.
&lt;!-- Still have to add correct diagram 
[[Image:phasediagram.gif|250px|A blank phase diagram]]--&gt;

The three components composing the system are each found at an apex of the triangle, where their corresponding volume fraction is 100%. Moving away from that corner reduces the volume fraction of that specific component and increases the volume fraction of one or both of the two other components. Each point within the triangle represents a possible composition of a mixture of the three components or pseudo-components, which may consist (ideally, according to the [[Gibbs' phase rule]]) of one, two or three phases.  These points combine to form regions with boundaries between them, which represent the "phase behavior" of the system at constant temperature and pressure.

The Gibbs phase diagram, however, is an empirical visual observation of the state of the system and may, or may not express the true number of phases within a given composition. Apparently clear single phase formulations can still consist of multiple iso-tropic phases (e.g. the apparently clear heptane/[[Dioctyl sodium sulfonsuccinate|AOT]]/water microemulsions consist multiple phases). Since these systems can be in equilibrium with other phases, many systems, especially those with high volume fractions of both the two imiscible phases, can be easily destabilised by anything that changes this equilibrium e.g. high or low temperature or addition of surface tension modifying agents.

However, examples of relatively stable microemulsions can be found. It is believed that the mechanism for removing acid build up in car engine oils involves low water phase volume, water-in-oil (w/o) microemulsions. Theoretically, transport of the aqueous acid droplets through the engine oil to microdispersed calcium carbonate particles in the oil should be most efficient when the aqueous droplets are small enough to transport a single hydrogen ion (the smaller the droplets, the greater the number of acid water droplets, the faster the neutralisation). Such microemulsions are probably very stable across a reasonably wide range of elevated temperatures.

The '''National Urban Forestry Unit''' (known as NUFU) was established in 1995 to promote [[urban forestry]].&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20050226095206/http://www.nufu.org.uk/&lt;/ref&gt; It was a charitable organisation which worked to raise awareness of the positive contribution that trees make to the quality of life in towns. It championed urban and community forestry to those tackling such issues as public health, leisure and recreation, land reclamation, built development, heritage and education.  It was wound up in 2005. 

The National Urban Forestry Unit's aims were: To increase awareness, understanding and popular support for trees in towns; to encourage a strategic approach to the development of urban forestry; to promote technical excellence, research, innovation and best value in all aspects of urban forestry; to provide a national focus for the exchange of information and good practice in urban forestry; and to champion the work of the growing number of UK urban and community forestry projects

NUFU evolved from the smaller Black Country Urban Forestry Unit into a national charity. Its greatest achievement was the [[Black Country Urban Forest]] a programme of [[urban forestry]] supported by the [[Millennium Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-site/awards.cgi?action=detail&amp;id=20&amp;t=2 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2004-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040725080713/http://www.millennium.gov.uk/cgi-site/awards.cgi?action=detail&amp;id=20&amp;t=2 |archivedate=2004-07-25 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; which achieved 362 hectares of new woodland planting across the [[Black Country]].

NUFU also produced a series of case studies of best practice in urban forestry, now preserved in an online archive by the [[Wildlife Trust for Birmingham and the Black Country]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bbcwildlife.org.uk/node/3576&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Emi Koussi crater natron.jpg|thumb|Natron deposits in the Era Kohor crater in the [[Tibesti Mountains]], [[Chad]]]]
'''Natron''' is a naturally occurring mixture of [[sodium carbonate]] deca[[hydrate]] ([[sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[carbon|C]][[oxygen|O]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''10[[properties of water|H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O]], a kind of [[soda ash]]) and around 17% [[sodium bicarbonate]] (also called baking soda, NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) along with small quantities of [[sodium chloride]] and [[sodium sulfate]]. Natron is white to colourless when pure, varying to gray or yellow with impurities. Natron deposits are sometimes found in saline lake beds which arose in arid environments. Throughout history natron has had many practical applications that continue today in the wide range of modern uses of its constituent mineral components.

In modern [[mineralogy]] the term ''natron'' has come to mean only the sodium carbonate decahydrate (hydrated soda ash) that makes up most of the historical salt.

== Etymology ==
The [[English language|English]] and [[German language|German]] word ''natron'' is a [[French language|French]] [[cognate]] derived from the [[Spanish language|Spanish]] ''natrón'' through [[Latin language|Latin]] ''natrium'' and [[Greek language|Greek]] νίτρον ''nitron''. This derives from the [[Ancient Egyptian]] word ''nṯry'' 'natron'. ''Natron'' refers to [[Wadi El Natrun]] or Natron Valley in Egypt, from which natron was mined by the ancient Egyptians for use in burial rites. The modern chemical symbol for [[sodium]], '''Na''', is an abbreviation of that element's [[New Latin]] name ''natrium'', which was derived from ''natron''.

== Importance in antiquity ==
[[File:Egyptian - "Malqata Kateriskos" Vessel - Walters 4732 - Profile.jpg|thumb|A [[Egyptian faience|faience]] vase fabricated in part from natron, dating to the [[New Kingdom of Egypt]] (c. 1450-1350 BC).]]

Historical natron was harvested directly as a salt mixture from dry lake beds in [[ancient Egypt]], and has been used for thousands of years as a cleaning product for both the home and body. Blended with oil, it was an early form of [[soap]]. It [[Water softening|softens water]] while removing oil and grease. Undiluted, natron was a cleanser for the teeth and an early [[mouthwash]]. The mineral was mixed into early [[antiseptics]] for wounds and minor cuts. Natron can be used to dry and preserve fish and meat. It was also an ancient household insecticide, and was used for making leather as well as a bleach for clothing.

The mineral was used during [[mummy|mummification]] ceremonies in ancient Egypt because it absorbs water and behaves as a drying agent. Moreover, when exposed to moisture, the [[carbonate]] in natron increases [[pH]] (raises [[alkalinity]]), which creates a hostile environment for bacteria. In some cultures, natron was thought to enhance spiritual safety for both the living and the dead. Natron was added to [[castor oil]] to make a [[smokeless fuel]], which allowed Egyptian artisans to paint elaborate artworks inside ancient tombs without staining them with soot.

The Pyramid Texts describe how natron pellets were used as funerary offerings in the rites for the deceased pharaoh, "N."  The ceremony required two different kinds of natron sourced from northern (Lower) and southern (Upper) Egypt.

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;''Smin'', ''smin'' opens thy mouth. One pellet of natron.
O N., thou shalt taste its taste in front of the ''sḥ-ntr-''chapels. One pellet of natron.
That which Horus spits out is ''smin''. One pellet of natron.

Natron is an ingredient for making a distinct color called ''[[Egyptian blue]]'', and also as the [[flux (metallurgy)|flux]] in [[Egyptian faience]]. It was used along with [[sand]] and [[lime (mineral)|lime]] in ceramic and glass-making by the Romans and others at least until AD 640. The mineral was also employed as a flux to solder precious metals together.

=== Decline in use ===
Most of natron's uses both in the home and by industry were gradually replaced with closely related sodium compounds and minerals. Natron's [[detergent]] properties are now commercially supplied by [[soda ash]] (pure sodium carbonate), the mixture's chief compound ingredient, along with other chemicals. Soda ash also replaced natron in [[Ancient glass trade|glass-making]]. Some of its ancient household roles are also now filled by ordinary [[baking soda]], which is [[sodium bicarbonate]], natron's other key ingredient.

== Chemistry of hydrated sodium carbonate ==
Natron is also the mineralogical name for the compound sodium carbonate decahydrate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), which is the main component in historical natron.&lt;ref&gt;''webmineral.com'', [http://webmineral.com/data/Natron.shtml "Natron"], retrieved 5 July 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium carbonate decahydrate has a [[specific gravity]] of 1.42 to 1.47 and a [[Mohs hardness]] of 1. It crystallizes in the [[monoclinic]]-domatic [[crystal system]], typically forming efflorescences and encrustations.

The term ''hydrated sodium carbonate'' is commonly used to encompass the monohydrate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), the decahydrate and the heptahydrate (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), but is often used in industry to refer to the decahydrate only. Both the hepta- and the decahydrate effloresce (lose water) in dry air and are partially transformed into the monohydrate [[thermonatrite]] Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O.

=== As a source of soda ash ===
Sodium carbonate decahydrate is stable at room temperature but recrystallizes at only {{convert|32|°C|°F|abbr=on}} to sodium carbonate heptahydrate, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''7H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O, then above {{convert|37|-|38|C|F}} to sodium carbonate monohydrate, Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;'''·'''H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. This recrystallization from decahydrate to monohydrate releases much crystal water in a mostly clear, colorless salt solution with little solid [[thermonatrite]]. The mineral natron is often found in association with [[thermonatrite]], [[nahcolite]], [[trona]], [[halite]], [[mirabilite]], [[gaylussite]], [[gypsum]], and [[calcite]].
Most industrially produced sodium carbonate is soda ash (sodium carbonate anhydrate Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) which is obtained by calcination (dry heating at temperatures of 150 to 200&amp;nbsp;°C) of sodium bicarbonate, sodium carbonate monohydrate, or [[trona]].

== Geological occurrence ==
Geologically, the mineral natron as well as the historical natron are formed as transpiro-[[evaporite]] minerals, i.e. crystallizing during the drying up of salt lakes rich in sodium carbonate. The sodium carbonate is usually formed by absorption of [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere by a highly alkaline, sodium-rich lake [[brine]], according to the following reaction scheme:

NaOH&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt;

NaHCO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + NaOH&lt;sub&gt;(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; → Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3(aq)&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

Pure deposits of sodium carbonate decahydrate are rare, due to the limited temperature stability of this compound and due to the fact that the absorption of [[carbon dioxide]] usually produces mixtures of [[bicarbonate]] and [[carbonate]] in solution. From such mixtures, the mineral natron (and also the historical one) will be formed only if the [[brine]] temperature during evaporation is maximally about {{convert|20|°C|°F|abbr=on}}&amp;nbsp;– or the [[alkalinity]] of the lake is so high, that little [[bicarbonate]] is present in solution (see reaction scheme above)&amp;nbsp;– in which case the maximum temperature is increased to about {{convert|30|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. In most cases the mineral natron will form together with some amount of [[nahcolite]] ([[sodium bicarbonate]]), resulting in salt mixtures like the historical natron.
Otherwise, the minerals [[trona]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://webmineral.com/data/Trona.shtml|title= Trona Mineral Data}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[thermonatrite]] and [[nahcolite]] are commonly formed. As the evaporation of a salt lake will occur over geological time spans, during which also part or all of the salt beds might redissolve and recrystallize, deposits of sodium carbonate can be composed of layers of all these minerals.

The '''North American blizzard of 2006''' was a [[nor'easter]] that began on the evening of February 11, 2006. It dumped heavy [[snow]] across the [[Mid-Atlantic states|Mid-Atlantic]] and [[New England]] states, from [[Virginia]] to [[Maine]] through the early evening of February 12, and ended in [[Atlantic Canada]] on February 13. The major [[city|cities]] from [[Baltimore]] to [[Boston]] received at least a foot of snow, with a second-highest amount of 26.9&amp;nbsp;inches (68.3&amp;nbsp;cm) in [[New York City]], the (at the time) most since at least 1869, the start of record keeping, only broken by the [[January 2016 United States blizzard]] nearly 10 years later.

==Meteorological synopsis==
[[Image:NASABlizzard2006.jpg|thumb|left|Another [[NASA]] satellite image of the storm.]]

Since the heaviest snow was confined to a fairly small, but very heavily populated area, the storm was only ranked as a low-end Category&amp;nbsp;3 (''Major'') on the new [[Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale]], which takes into account the area and population affected, as well as snowfall accumulations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/climate/research/snow-nesis/ |title=The Northeast Snowfall Impact Scale (NESIS) |publisher=Ncdc.noaa.gov |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This indirectly also reflects the fact that casualties were extremely low and cleanup was fairly quick, even in the [[New York City]] area where the record snow amounts occurred.  The main reasons for this are: A) The storm fell on a Sunday when many people can more easily stay home, B) the relatively small geographic area of extremely large snowfall, and C) Because the temperature was well below freezing throughout most of the storm, the snow was mostly dry and light in composition, as opposed to the wet and heavy snows that make some otherwise lesser storms much harder to clean up from and are more common at least in the coastal Northeast. Additionally, temperatures in the days after the storm were unseasonably warm in some spots (reaching the mid-50s °F in hard-hit [[New York City]], and the mid 60s in DC) which helped melt the snow much more quickly than usual.

The storm system began developing on February 11 as a relatively minor system, bringing some snow along the southern [[Appalachian Mountains|Appalachian]] range. The low pressure center moved off-shore early February 12 before it began its rapid intensification. By early morning, snow began falling heavily, taking several forecasters by surprise who had expected about a foot of snow, at most, along the eastern fringes of the [[Atlantic]] seaboard.  During the height of the storm on Sunday morning the 12th, thunder and lightning occurred as the snow fell. The presence of this [[thundersnow]] shows how energetic this storm became.

The extreme intensification was partially the result of a fairly mild winter that kept water temperatures in the Atlantic a few degrees warmer than they normally are in February. The storm system's intensity led to snowfall accumulations upwards of 32 inches (81.3&amp;nbsp;cm) in some localities.

In addition to the heavy snow, coastal [[flooding]] from [[storm surge]] was reported, particularly in [[Massachusetts]].&lt;ref name="AP_SamanthaGross"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222033557/http://www.forbes.com/home/feeds/ap/2006/02/12/ap2519347.html|title=Update 26: Nor'easter Slams East From Va. to Maine - Forbes.com|date=22 February 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Storm surges have been recorded as high as 3&amp;nbsp;feet (1 m) in parts of New England.&lt;ref&gt;confirmed by National Weather Service Boston, MA Storm Report&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[low pressure area]] began forming in the [[Southern United States|Southern]] states a few days prior to the Blizzard striking, eventually merging with a northern stream system. A [[trough (meteorology)|trough]] on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] brought the system up the coast, and cold high pressure to the north eventually slowed the system to a crawl. As the system completed [[cyclogenesis|bombing]], or rapid decrease in central pressure (a common measure of the strength of a storm), mesoscale banding features (areas of significant snowfall associated with smaller scale physical phenomena) impinged on the entire [[Interstate 95|I-95]] Corridor.

The low pressure center was so deep that somewhat of an [[eyewall|eye]] actually formed. Rarely do eyes form on storms other than [[hurricane]]s, and it is especially rare in [[extratropical cyclone]]s. NASA took a satellite picture of the eye of the storm; the eye was located south and east of southern New Jersey in this picture.

==Impact==

Three casualties occurred as a result of the snow: in Virginia, a man died due to his truck sliding off a highway; in Baltimore, a person died in a house fire as a result of snow delaying rescue workers from getting to the fire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/nm/20060212/ts_nm/weather_northeast_dc |title=Northeast US hammered by record blizzard |publisher= |date= |accessdate=2009-08-11}}{{dead link|date=August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; A third fatality occurred in a weather-related accident in [[Nova Scotia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbc.ca/ns/story/ns-snow-day20060213.html  |title=CBC Nova Scotia – Shovels out in Nova Scotia |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2006-02-12 |accessdate=2009-08-27 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060911013624/http://www.cbc.ca/ns/story/ns-snow-day20060213.html |archivedate = 2006-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Connecticut===
While [[Connecticut]] was one of the hardest hit areas, the state was well-prepared for the storm and managed to avoid major problems. [[Hartford, CT|Hartford]] received a total of 21.9&amp;nbsp;inches (55&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow — the second largest snowfall since 1906. A total of 18&amp;nbsp;inches (46&amp;nbsp;cm) fell in the small Sandy Hook village.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.wfsb.com/Global/story.asp?S=4490543 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060222195028/http://www.wfsb.com/Global/story.asp?S=4490543 |title=Nor'easter pummels state, but causes little damage |archivedate=2006-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[West Hartford, CT|West Hartford]] totaled 27&amp;nbsp;inches (69&amp;nbsp;cm) and [[Fairfield, CT|Fairfield]] saw 27.8&amp;nbsp;inches (70.6&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow. Despite the large amounts of snow, there were only isolated individual power outages.  At the storm's onset, governor [[M. Jodi Rell]] ordered all [[tractor-trailer]] trucks off the state's highways to facilitate the efforts of highway crews with snow removal.  Motorists whose vehicles were not equipped with [[4-wheel drive]] were required to use [[snow chains]] to travel on state roadways during the storm.  Connecticut mobilized 2,500 state-owned and privately contracted [[snowplow]]s to keep state highways open during the storm.  The state's 169 cities and towns employed hundreds of additional plows to keep local roads passable.  [[Bradley International Airport]] was closed for several hours, and the storm disrupted service on [[Metro-North Railroad|Metro North]].

===Delaware===
[[New Castle County, Delaware|New Castle County]] and [[Wilmington, Delaware|Wilmington]] felt the brunt of this storm, with 14–15&amp;nbsp;inches (35–38&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow. [[Kent County, Delaware|Kent]] and [[Sussex County, Delaware|Sussex]] counties to the south mixed with rain for a while, and saw significantly less snow accumulations, mostly in the 6&amp;nbsp;inch (15&amp;nbsp;cm) range.

===District of Columbia===
The city of [[Washington, D.C.]] missed the worst of the storm. The city received about 10&amp;nbsp;inches (24&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow, far less than in the [[suburb]]s. Approximately 3,000&amp;nbsp;people lost [[electricity]] in the District of Columbia.&lt;ref name="WJLAWashingtonPower"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wjla.com/news/stories/0206/302074.html|title=Power Outage|accessdate=February 12, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, [[Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport]] (just across the [[Potomac River]]) was closed.

===Maryland===
The heaviest snow in Maryland fell from the northern suburbs of Washington, D.C., to the Baltimore area. These areas overwhelmingly saw over a foot of snow. Snowfall rates of 2–3&amp;nbsp;inches (5–8&amp;nbsp;cm) per hour were common, and [[thundersnow]] occurred. Snowfall amounts of up to 21&amp;nbsp;inches (53&amp;nbsp;cm) were reported in [[Columbia, Maryland|Columbia]], 13.1&amp;nbsp;inches (33.3&amp;nbsp;cm) in Baltimore, 17&amp;nbsp;inches (43&amp;nbsp;cm) in [[Catonsville, Maryland|Catonsville]], and a foot (30.5&amp;nbsp;cm) in [[Potomac, Maryland|Potomac]]. This was the area's heaviest snow since the [[North American blizzard of 2003]]. Lesser amounts occurred in western and southern parts of the state.

Maryland was hardest hit by power outages. In the [[Baltimore]] area, more than 62,000&amp;nbsp;people lost electricity, plus another 16,000 in [[Montgomery County, Maryland|Montgomery County]] and 37,000 in [[Prince George's County, Maryland|Prince George's County]].

===Massachusetts===
The most serious coastal problems were in Massachusetts. The heaviest snow was in the central part of the state, where snow amounts of up to 20&amp;nbsp;inches (50&amp;nbsp;cm) were reported. Coastal areas, particularly around [[Nantucket]], saw lesser amounts (approximately 12") as it was mixed with [[Ice storm|sleet]] at times, but winds of up to 60&amp;nbsp;mph (95&amp;nbsp;km/h) whipped up the ocean with storm surges of 2 to 3&amp;nbsp;feet (60 to 90&amp;nbsp;cm) and led to some coastal flooding, plus offshore waves of up to 25&amp;nbsp;feet (8 m). [[Logan International Airport]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]] and Barnstable municipal airport in [[Hyannis, Massachusetts|Hyannis]] on [[Cape Cod]] saw over 90% of their flights cancelled at the peak of the storm.

There were no power outages, despite the conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060428051543/http://www1.whdh.com/news/articles/local/BO14188/|title=WHDH-TV - Boston - Snowstorm blankets southern New England|date=28 April 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There was one death; a tree fell onto a pickup truck in [[Billerica, Massachusetts|Billerica]], killing the driver.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060219191103/http://www.cnn.com/2006/WEATHER/02/18/winter.storms.sat.ap/index.html|title=CNN.com - Four killed, 250,000 without power in winter storm - Feb 18, 2006|date=19 February 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Strong winds across the state caused $1.9&amp;nbsp;million in damage (2006&amp;nbsp;USD).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~609792|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080115032054/http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~609792|archivedate=2008-01-15 |title=NCDC: Event Details |publisher=.ncdc.noaa.gov |date=2006-04-07 |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Jersey===
The impact of the blizzard in northern [[New Jersey]] was strong enough to stop the [[New Jersey Transit]] [[New Jersey Transit Bus Operations|bus]] service between 7:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 4:00&amp;nbsp;p.m., although [[train]]s continued to run (with some delays).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wabc/story?section=traffic&amp;id=3899215 |title=7online.com: New York City and Metro Area Traffic on WABC-TV 2/12/06 |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2006-02-12 |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many roads remained closed. Businesses were closed for most of the day. 16,000&amp;nbsp;people were without power in the state. Central and northeastern New Jersey saw the brunt of the storm due to heavy banding through the night into the morning: 21" (53.3&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow fell at [[Newark Liberty International Airport|Newark Airport]] and 27" fell in [[Rahway]]. The first [[Wicked Faire]] took place as scheduled.

===New York===
{{Commons category|New York City in North American blizzard of 2006|New York City in blizzard of 2006}}
[[Image:Prospect Heights Blizzard NYC 2-12-06.jpg|thumb|[[Prospect Heights, Brooklyn]] on February 12.]]
The [[New York metropolitan area|Greater New York City]] area received the brunt of the February Blizzard of 2006. All three of the [[airport]]s in the [[New York City]] area ([[LaGuardia Airport]], [[John F. Kennedy International Airport]] and [[Newark Liberty International Airport]]) were closed during the record blizzard, for the first time since the [[September 11, 2001 attacks]]. Like the [[Blizzard of 1996]], this winter storm does not meet the criteria to be called a blizzard, however. The winds were not strong enough, and visibility was not poor enough. [[Thundersnow]], which is a rare occurrence in New York, occurred for about a 4-hour period in parts of [[Bronx]], [[Manhattan]], [[Brooklyn]], [[Queens]], [[Rockland County, New York|Rockland]] and [[Westchester County, New York|Westchester]] during the height of the storm early Sunday morning.

[[Central Park]] received 26.9&amp;nbsp;inches (68.3&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow, the largest amount for a single storm since records began, breaking the record of 26.4&amp;nbsp;inches (67.1&amp;nbsp;cm) that fell on December 26, 1947. By comparison, the [[Blizzard of 1996|blizzards of 1996]] [[Blizzard of 2003|and 2003]] dropped 20.2 and 19.8&amp;nbsp;inches (51.3 and 50.3&amp;nbsp;cm) in Central Park respectively. The smallest amounts of snowfall were recorded in portions of Nassau County, including the towns of Oceanside, Lynbrook, Rockville Centre and Island Park.
The [[snow removal]] cost in New York City alone is estimated at about $27&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060213/ap_on_re_us/snowstorm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060221224329/http://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20060213/ap_on_re_us/snowstorm |title=Northeast Digs Out From Record Snowstorm |archivedate=2006-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It took nearly two days for utility crews to fully restore service to as many as 300,000 customers.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[Image:LoaderBlizzard2006.jpg|thumb|left|A [[loader (equipment)|loader]] clears snow in [[New York City]] during a lull in the snowfall on Sunday, February 12.]]

The storm did not reach very far north of the city; the [[Albany, New York|Albany]] area only received 1–2&amp;nbsp;inches (2.5–5&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow.  As a result, the 2005–06 winter season ended up being the first time ever since records began in the late 19th century that [[New York City]] received more snow than Albany in a given winter (the inland, upstate city averages about twice as much snowfall per winter as its big neighbor to the south).

The strong winds downed trees and powerlines, resulting in $3&amp;nbsp;million in damage (2006&amp;nbsp;USD).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;  The [[Long Island Rail Road]] reported extensive delays and as many as eight trains disabled up to several hours after the blizzard.  The Monday morning commute was no better, as two of the railroad's lines were shut down completely and delays caused headaches for ambitious commuters.  By Tuesday, two days after the storm, service was back to normal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ble.org/pr/news/headline.asp?id=15558 |title=LIRR back on track two days after blizzard |publisher=Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers |date=2006-02-15 |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the record snowfall, the New York City schools were open on February 13, owing to planning and work by the city and its snowplow team.

===Pennsylvania===
Snowfall totals were measured at 12&amp;nbsp;inches (30&amp;nbsp;cm) at [[Philadelphia International Airport]], but 35&amp;nbsp;miles (56&amp;nbsp;km) to the west in West Caln Township, there were 21&amp;nbsp;inches (53&amp;nbsp;cm). Philadelphia International Airport remained open throughout the storm, although about 50% of flights were cancelled. There were also power outages in the Philadelphia area, with about 10,000 customers losing power. But in contrast, in Western Pennsylvania most got 1" (2.5&amp;nbsp;cm) or less of snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.philly.com/mld/philly/news/13856095.htm |accessdate=February 12, 2006 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Philadelphia public and parchocial schools were closed for the day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://abclocal.go.com/wpvi/story?section=local&amp;id=3899900 |title=6abc.com: Digging Out from Snowstorm 2/13/06 |publisher=Abclocal.go.com |date=2006-02-13 |accessdate=2009-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rhode Island===
The [[Governor of Rhode Island]], [[Donald Carcieri]], declared a statewide [[state of emergency]] due to the blizzard conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060227200335/http://www.turnto10.com/news/6973803/detail.html|title=NBC 10 NEWS - News - Blizzard Of '06 Blasts Into Southern New England|date=27 February 2006|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Providence Journal]] reported that state accumulations were generally between 9 and 19&amp;nbsp;inches (23 to 49&amp;nbsp;cm). Generally, [[Providence County]] received the heaviest accumulations in the state (see the chart below). On February 12, the bulk of the snow ended around 5:00&amp;nbsp;p.m. Eastern Standard Time, with flurries lasting through the early evening. No significant power outages or injuries were reported.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

===Virginia===
[[Image:Falls church va, during Blizzard in Feb 2006.jpg|right|thumb|Picture of [[Falls Church, Virginia]], just outside [[Washington, D.C.]]]]
According to [[Dominion Power]], over 64,000&amp;nbsp;people in [[Northern Virginia]] lost power in the storm, primarily in the suburban areas adjacent to Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="WJLAWashingtonPower"/&gt; Many locations in the extreme northeastern portion of the state recorded 10–15" (25–38&amp;nbsp;cm) of snow, with Falls Church and Fairfax coming in at 13.5" (34.3&amp;nbsp;cm) and 14.0" (35.6&amp;nbsp;cm) respectively. Fairfax County and eastern Loudoun County were generally the start of the 12+" (30+ cm) accumulations, which spread north towards Massachusetts.

===Atlantic Canada===
While the snowfall amounts diminished somewhat (to about 6 to {{convert|12|in|mm}} or 15 to 30&amp;nbsp;cm) by the time the storm tracked east into [[Atlantic Canada]], the winds increased substantially. The worst of the storm was felt along the Atlantic coast, particularly in a swath around the [[Bay of Fundy]], the [[Northumberland Strait]] and the south coast of [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]. Hurricane-force wind gusts were reported in several communities, peaking at 156&amp;nbsp;km/h (97&amp;nbsp;mph) in [[Grand Etang, Nova Scotia]] (equal to a [[Saffir-Simpson hurricane scale|Category 2]] hurricane) and 133&amp;nbsp;km/h (83&amp;nbsp;mph) in [[Cape Race]] on the east coast of Newfoundland. Some damage was reported as a result of the strong winds, particularly downed power lines but also some roof damage to buildings.

== Botanical information and terminology ==
{{Main|Citrus taxonomy}}
All [[Citrus|citrus trees]] belong to the single [[genus]] ''Citrus'' and remain almost entirely [[Hybrid plant|interfertile]].

Different names have been given to the many varieties of the genus. ''Orange'' applies primarily to the sweet orange – ''Citrus sinensis'' ([[Carl Linnaeus|L.]]) [[Osbeck]]. The orange tree is an [[evergreen]], [[Flowering plant|flowering]] tree, with an average height of {{convert|9|to|10|m|ft|abbr=on}}, although some very old specimens can reach {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=webber4 /&gt; Its oval [[leaf|leaves]], [[leaf arrangement|alternately arranged]], are {{convert|4|to|10|cm|in|abbr=on}} long and have [[crenulate]] margins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eol.org/pages/582206|title=Sweet Orange – Citrus sinensis (L.)

Inside and attached to the rind is a porous white tissue, the white, bitter [[mesocarp]] or albedo (''[[pith]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/pith|title=Pith dictionary definition – pith defined|website=www.yourdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The orange contains a number of distinct ''[[carpel]]s'' (segments) inside, typically about ten, each delimited by a membrane, and containing many [[Juice vesicles|juice-filled vesicles]] and usually a few seeds (''pips'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.yourdictionary.com/pip|title=Pip dictionary definition – pip defined|website=www.yourdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; When unripe, the fruit is green. The grainy irregular rind of the ripe fruit can range from bright orange to yellow-orange, but frequently retains green patches or, under warm climate conditions, remains entirely green. Like all other citrus fruits, the sweet orange is non-[[Climacteric (botany)|climacteric]].

Other citrus groups also known as oranges are:
* [[Mandarin orange]] (''Citrus reticulata'') is an original species of citrus, and is a progenitor of the common orange.
* [[Bitter orange]] (''Citrus aurantium''), also known as Seville orange, sour orange (especially when used as [[rootstock]] for a sweet orange tree), bigarade orange and marmalade orange.

[[File:Mandarin Oranges (Citrus Reticulata).jpg|thumb|Mandarin Oranges]]
An enormous number of cultivars have, like the sweet orange, a mix of pomelo and mandarin ancestry. Some cultivars are mandarin-pomelo hybrids, bred from the same parents as the sweet orange (e.g. the [[tangor]] and [[ponkan]] tangerine). Other cultivars are sweet orange x mandarin hybrids (e.g. [[clementines]]). [[Citrus reticulata|Mandarin]] traits generally include being smaller and oblate, easier to peel, and less acidic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nutrition-and-you.com/tangerines.html|title=Tangerines (mandarin oranges) nutrition facts and health benefits|website=nutrition-and-you.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Pomelo]] traits include a thick white albedo (rind pith, mesocarp) that is more closely attached to the segments.

Orange trees generally are [[grafting|grafted]]. The bottom of the tree, including the roots and trunk, is called rootstock, while the fruit-bearing top has two different names: [[budwood]] (when referring to the process of grafting) and [[scion (grafting)|scion]] (when mentioning the variety of orange).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/scion|title=Definition of SCION|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Etymology ==
{{Main|Orange (word)}}
&lt;!-- Please go to the main article, [[Orange (word)]], if you wish to add further examples from any additional languages. --&gt;
The word ''orange'' derives from the [[Sanskrit]] word for "orange tree" (''नारङ्ग nāraṅga''), which in turn derives from a [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] root word (from  ''நரந்தம் narandam'' which refers to [[Bitter orange]] in [[Tamil language|Tamil]]).&lt;ref name="Collins"&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of ''orange''|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/orange?showCookiePolicy=true|publisher=[[Collins English Dictionary]] (collinsdictionary.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Sanskrit word reached [[Languages of Europe|European languages]] through [[Persian language|Persian]] نارنگ (''nārang'') and its [[Arabic language|Arabic]] derivative  نارنج (''nāranj'')&lt;!--, [[Armenian language|Armenian]] նարինջ ''nārinj'', [[Spanish (language)|Spanish]] ''naranja'', [[Portuguese (language)|Portuguese]] ''laranja''), [[late Latin]] ''arangia'', [[Italian (language)|Italian]] ''arancia'' or ''arancio'', and [[Old French]] ''orenge''--&gt;.

The word entered [[Late Middle English]] in the fourteenth century via [[Old French]] ''orenge'' (in the phrase ''pomme d'orenge'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Definition of ''orange''|url=http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/english/orange?q=orange|publisher=[[OED]] online (www.oxforddictionaries.com)}}&lt;/ref&gt; The French word, in turn, comes from [[Old Occitan|Old Provençal]] ''auranja'', based on Arabic ''nāranj''.&lt;ref name="Collins" /&gt; In several languages, the initial ''n'' present in earlier forms of the word dropped off because it may have been mistaken as part of an indefinite article ending in an ''n'' sound—in French, for example, ''une norenge'' may have been heard as ''une orenge''. This linguistic change is called [[juncture loss]]. [[orange (color)|The color]] was named after the fruit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Paterson|first=Ian|title=A Dictionary of Colour: A Lexicon of the Language of Colour |edition=1st paperback|year=2003|publication-date=2004|publisher=Thorogood |location=London| isbn=1-85418-375-3| oclc=60411025|page=280}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the first recorded use of ''orange'' as a color name in English was in 1512.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=orange colour – orange color, n.

As [[Portuguese Empire|Portuguese merchants]] were presumably the first to introduce the sweet orange to some regions of Europe, in several modern [[Indo-European languages]] the fruit has been named after them. Some examples are Albanian [[wikt:portokall#Albanian|portokall]], Bulgarian [[wikt:портокал#Bulgarian|портокал]] (''portokal''), Greek [[wikt:πορτοκάλι#Greek|πορτοκάλι]] (''portokali''), [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]] ''{{transl|mk|portokal}}'', Persian [[wikt:پرتقال#Persian|پرتقال]] (''porteghal''), Turkish [[wikt:portakal#Turkish|portakal]] and Romanian [[wikt:portocală#Romanian|portocală]].&lt;ref name="plantname"&gt;{{cite web |title=Multilingual Multiscript Plant Name Database: Sorting Citrus Names |url=http://www.plantnames.unimelb.edu.au/Sorting/Citrus_2.html|publisher=[[University of Melbourne]] (www.search.unimelb.edu.au) |accessdate=11 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="OstergrenBosse2011"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Ostergren, Robert C.  |author2=Le Bosse, Mathias  |lastauthoramp=yes |title=The Europeans, Second Edition: A Geography of People, Culture, and Environment |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=y-1fwix23zMC&amp;pg=PA129 |year= 2011 |publisher=[[Guilford Press]] |isbn=978-1-60918-140-6 |page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Related names can be found in other languages,&lt;!--"[[Amharic language|Amharic]] birtukan": NOT in sources--&gt; such as Arabic [[wikt:البرتقال#Arabic|البرتقال]] (''bourtouqal''), [[Georgian language|Georgian]] [[wikt:ფორთოხალი#Georgian|ფორთოხალი]] (''pʰortʰoxali'') and [[Amharic]] ''birtukan''.&lt;ref name="plantname" /&gt; Also, in some of the Italian regional languages (e.g. [[Neapolitan language|Neapolitan]]), an orange is ''[[:wikt:portogallo|portogallo]]'' or ''[[:wikt:it:purtuallo|purtuallo]]'', literally "(the) Portuguese (one)", in contrast to the [[standard Italian|Italian]] ''arancia''.

In other Indo-European languages, the words for ''orange'' allude to the eastern origin of the fruit and can be translated literally as "apple from China". Some examples are [[German language|German]] ''Apfelsine'' (alternative name for ''Orange'' and common in northern Germany), Dutch ''appelsien'' and ''sinaasappel'', Swedish ''apelsin'', Russian ''апельсин'' (''apelsin'') and Norwegian ''appelsin''.&lt;ref name="OstergrenBosse2011" /&gt; A similar case is [[Puerto Rican Spanish]] ''china''.&lt;ref name="Duff1971"&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles Duff |title=Spanish for beginners |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0buuN5kapGwC&amp;pg=PA191 |year=1971 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=978-0-06-463271-3 |page=191}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also [[List of Puerto Rican slang words and phrases#C|List of Puerto Rican slang words and phrases]]&lt;/ref&gt;

The sweet orange is not a wild fruit,&lt;ref name=webber4 /&gt; having arisen in domestication from a cross between a non-pure [[mandarin orange]] and a hybrid [[pomelo]] that had a substantial mandarin component.

In Europe, the [[Moors]] introduced the orange to Spain which was known as [[Al-Andalus]], modern [[Andalusia]], with large scale cultivation starting in the 10th century as evidenced by complex irrigation techniques specifically adapted to support orange orchards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://canal.ugr.es/prensa-y-comunicacion/science-news-ugr/social-economic-and-legal-sciences/sugar-cane-cumin-and-orange-grove-crops-were-adapted-in-alandalus-from-the-10th-century/|title=Water and landscape in Granada|date=1 September 2003|website=Universidad de Granada|publisher=|access-date=|last1=Trillo San José|first1=Carmen}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Citrus fruits — among them the bitter orange — were introduced to Sicily in the 9th century during the period of the [[Emirate of Sicily]], but the sweet orange was unknown until the late 15th century or the beginnings of the 16th century, when Italian and Portuguese merchants brought orange trees into the Mediterranean area.&lt;ref name=morton /&gt; Shortly afterward, the sweet orange quickly was adopted as an edible fruit. It also was considered a luxury item and wealthy people grew oranges in private conservatories, called [[orangerie]]s. By 1646, the sweet orange was well known throughout Europe.&lt;ref name=morton /&gt; [[Louis XIV]] of France had a great love of orange trees, and built the grandest of all royal [[Orangerie of Versailles|Orangeries]] at the [[Palace of Versailles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Gardens of Versailles| author=Jean-Baptiste Leroux| publisher=Thames &amp; Hudson| year=2002|p=368}}&lt;/ref&gt; At Versailles potted orange trees in solid silver tubs were placed throughout the rooms of the palace, while the Orangerie allowed year-round cultivation of the fruit to supply the court. When Louis condemned his finance minister, [[Nicolas Fouquet]], in 1664, part of the treasures which he confiscated were over 1,000 orange trees from Fouquet's estate at [[Vaux-le-Vicomte]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=The Sun King| author=Nancy Mitford| publisher=Sphere Books Ltd.| year=1966|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Spanish travelers introduced the sweet orange into the American continent. On his second voyage in 1493, Christopher Columbus may have planted the fruit in Hispaniola.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Sauls |first=Julian W. |title=HOME FRUIT PRODUCTION-ORANGES |url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/citrus/oranges.htm |publisher=The Texas A&amp;M University System |accessdate=30 November 2012 |date=December 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequent expeditions in the mid-1500s brought sweet oranges to South America and Mexico, and to Florida in 1565, when [[Pedro Menéndez de Avilés]] founded [[St. Augustine, Florida|St Augustine]]. [[Spanish missions in Arizona|Spanish missionaries]] brought orange trees to Arizona between 1707 and 1710, while the [[Spanish missions in California|Franciscans]] did the same in San Diego, California, in 1769.&lt;ref name=morton /&gt; An orchard was planted at the [[Mission San Gabriel Arcángel|San Gabriel Mission]] around 1804 and a commercial orchard was established in 1841 near present-day Los Angeles. In Louisiana, oranges were probably introduced by French explorers.

[[Archibald Menzies]], the botanist and naturalist on the [[Vancouver Expedition]], collected orange seeds in South Africa, raised the seedlings onboard and gave them to several Hawaiian chiefs in 1792. Eventually, the sweet orange was grown in wide areas of the Hawaiian Islands, but its cultivation stopped after the arrival of the [[Ceratitis capitata|Mediterranean fruit fly]] in the early 1900s.&lt;ref name=morton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Ceratitis capitata (Wiedemann) |url=http://www.extento.hawaii.edu/kbase/crop/Type/ceratiti.htm |publisher=Knowledge Master, [[University of Hawaii]] |accessdate=5 December 2012 |author1=Mau, Ronald  |author2=Kessing, Jayma Martin  |lastauthoramp=yes |date=April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As oranges are rich in [[vitamin C]] and do not spoil easily, during the [[Age of Discovery]], [[Portuguese empire|Portuguese]], [[Spanish empire|Spanish]], and [[Dutch empire|Dutch]] sailors planted citrus trees along trade routes to prevent [[scurvy]].

Florida farmers obtained seeds from New Orleans around 1872, after which orange groves were established by grafting the sweet orange on to sour orange rootstocks.&lt;ref name=morton /&gt;

== Varieties ==

=== Common oranges ===
[[File:Nigerian Orange seller (2).jpg|thumb|An orange vendor in [[Ilorin, Kwara]], peeling the skin of an orange]]
Common oranges (also called "white", "round", or "blond" oranges) constitute about two-thirds of all the orange production. &lt;!--"and include all oranges not described in one of the other three groups" ??????  CONFUSING--&gt;The majority of this crop is used mostly for juice extraction.&lt;ref name=Kimball /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sauls" /&gt;

==== Valencia ====
{{Main|Valencia orange}}
[[File:Florida orange grove.JPG|thumb|An orange grove in [[Florida]]]]
The Valencia orange is a late-season fruit, and therefore a popular variety when navel oranges are out of season. This is why an anthropomorphic orange was chosen as the [[mascot]] for the [[1982 FIFA World Cup]], held in Spain. The mascot was named [[Naranjito (mascot)|Naranjito]] ("little orange") and wore the colors of the Spanish national football team.

==== Hart's Tardiff Valencia ====
[[Thomas Rivers (nurseryman)|Thomas Rivers]], an English nurseryman, imported this variety from the Azores Islands and catalogued it in 1865 under the name Excelsior. Around 1870, he provided trees to S. B. Parsons, a Long Island nurseryman, who in turn sold them to E. H. Hart of [[Federal Point, Florida]].&lt;ref name=coit&gt;{{cite book |author=Coit, John Eliot |title=Citrus fruits: an account of the citrus fruit industry, with special reference to California requirements and practices and similar conditions |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M54UAAAAYAAJ |accessdate=2 October 2011 |year=1915 |publisher=The Macmillan Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--NO PREVIEW AVAILABLE ON GOOGLE BOOKS--&gt;

==== Hamlin ====
This [[cultivar]] was discovered by A. G. Hamlin near Glenwood, Florida, in 1879. The fruit is small, smooth, not highly colored, and juicy, with a pale yellow colored juice, especially in fruits that come from lemon rootstock. The fruit may be seedless, or may contain a number of small seeds.  The tree is high-yielding and cold-tolerant and it produces good quality fruit, which is harvested from October to December. It thrives in humid subtropical climates. In cooler, more arid areas, the trees produce edible fruit, but too small for commercial use.&lt;ref name=webber4 /&gt;

Trees from groves in [[Hammock (ecology)|hammocks]] or areas covered with pine forest are [[Shield budding|budded]] on sour orange trees, a method that gives a high solids content. On sand, they are grafted on rough lemon rootstock.&lt;ref name=morton /&gt; The Hamlin orange is one of the most popular juice oranges in Florida and replaces the Parson Brown variety as the principal early-season juice orange. This cultivar is now{{Update inline|date=November 2012|post-text=the source dates from 1989}} the leading early orange in Florida and, possibly, in the rest of the world.&lt;ref name="webber4"&gt;{{cite book

=== Navel oranges ===
Navel oranges are characterized by the growth of a second fruit at the [[Apical meristems|apex]], which protrudes slightly and resembles a human [[navel]]. They are primarily grown for human consumption for various reasons: their thicker skin makes them easy to peel, they are less juicy and their bitterness – a result of the high concentrations of [[limonin]] and other [[limonoid]]s – renders them less suitable for juice.&lt;ref name=Kimball /&gt; Their widespread distribution and long growing season have made navel oranges very popular. In the United States, they are available from November to April, with peak supplies in January, February, and March.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sunkist.com/products/oranges.aspx|title=Home|website=Sunkist|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110120184603/http://www.sunkist.com/products/oranges.aspx|archivedate=2011-01-20|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1917 study by [[Palemon Howard Dorsett|Palemon Dorsett]], [[Archibald Dixon Shamel]] and [[Wilson Popenoe]] of the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA), a single [[mutation]] in a Selecta orange tree planted on the grounds of a monastery near [[Salvador, Bahia|Bahia]], Brazil, probably yielded the first navel orange between 1810 and 1820.&lt;ref name=riverside /&gt; Nevertheless, a researcher at the University of California, Riverside, has suggested that the parent variety was more likely the Portuguese navel orange (''Umbigo''), described by [[Antoine Risso]] and [[Pierre Antoine Poiteau]] in their book ''Histoire naturelle des orangers'' ("Natural History of Orange Trees", 1818–1822).&lt;ref name=riverside /&gt; The mutation caused the orange to develop a second fruit at its base, opposite the stem, embedded within the peel of the primary orange.&lt;ref name="cfaitc"&gt;{{cite web | title=Commodity Fact Sheet: Citrus Fruits | work=California Foundation for Agriculture in the Classroom | url=http://www.cfaitc.org/factsheets/pdf/CitrusFruits.pdf | accessdate=2012-03-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Navel oranges were introduced in Australia in 1824 and in Florida in 1835. In 1870, twelve cuttings of the original tree were transplanted to Riverside, California, where the fruit became known as "Washington".&lt;ref&gt;Saunders, William "Experimental Gardens and Grounds", in USDA, Yearbook of Agriculture 1897, 180 ff; USDA, Yearbook of Agriculture 1900, 64.&lt;/ref&gt; This cultivar was very successful, and rapidly spread to other countries.&lt;ref name=riverside /&gt; Because the mutation left the fruit seedless and, therefore, sterile, the only method to cultivate navel oranges was to graft cuttings onto other varieties of citrus trees. The [[California Citrus State Historic Park]] and the [[Orcutt Ranch Horticulture Center]] preserve the history of navel oranges in Riverside.

Today, navel oranges continue to be propagated through [[cutting (plant)|cutting]] and [[grafting]]. This does not allow for the usual [[artificial selection|selective breeding]] methodologies, and so all navel oranges can be considered fruits from that single, nearly two-hundred-year-old tree: they have exactly the same genetic make-up as the original tree and are, therefore, [[Cloning|clones]]. This case is similar to that of the common yellow seedless banana, the [[Cavendish banana|Cavendish]], or that of the [[Granny Smith]] apple. On rare occasions, however, further mutations can lead to new varieties.&lt;ref name="riverside"&gt;{{cite web | last = Staff of the Citrus Experiment Station, College of Natural and Agricultural Sciences | title = Sweet Oranges and Their Hybrids | work = Citrus Variety Collection | publisher = University of California (Riverside) | date = 1910–2011 | url = http://www.citrusvariety.ucr.edu/citrus/sweet_oranges.html | accessdate = January 19, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Cara cara navels ====

=== Blood oranges ===
[[File:Oranges blood vs regular.jpg|thumb|right|alt=Sectioned oranges on a plate|Comparison between the inside and the outside of regular and blood oranges (two segments at upper left)]]
{{Main|Blood orange}}
Blood oranges&lt;ref name=morton /&gt; are a natural mutation of ''C. sinensis'', although today the majority of them are hybrids. High concentrations of [[anthocyanin]] give the rind, flesh, and juice of the fruit their characteristic [[dark red]] color. Blood oranges were first discovered and cultivated in [[Sicily]] in the fifteenth century. Since then they have spread worldwide, but are grown especially in [[Spain]] and [[Italy]] under the names of ''sanguina'' and ''sanguinella'', respectively.

The blood orange, with its distinct color and flavor, is generally considered favorably as a juice, and has found a niche as an ingredient variation in traditional Seville marmalade.

==== Other varieties of blood oranges ====
* Maltese: a small and highly colored variety, generally thought to have originated in Italy as a mutation&lt;!--(although the Maltese claim origin)--&gt; and cultivated there for centuries. It also is grown extensively in southern Spain and Malta. It is used in sorbets and other desserts due to its rich burgundy color.
* Moro: originally from Sicily, it is common throughout Italy. This medium-sized fruit has a relatively long harvest, which lasts from December to April.
* Sanguinelli: a mutant of the Doble Fina, discovered in 1929 in Almenara, in the [[Castellón province]] of Spain. It is cultivated in Sicily.
* Scarlet navel: a variety with the same &lt;!--dual-fruit--&gt;mutation as the navel orange.
* Tarocco: a relatively new variety developed in Italy. It begins to ripen in late January.&lt;ref name="webcapua.com" /&gt;

=== Acidless oranges ===
Acidless oranges are an early-season fruit with very low levels of acid. They also are called "sweet" oranges in the United States, with similar names in other countries: ''douce'' in France, ''sucrena'' in Spain, ''dolce'' or ''maltese'' in Italy, ''meski'' in North Africa and the Near East (where they are especially popular), ''şeker portakal'' ("sugar orange") in Turkey,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turuncgiller.com/seker.htm Portakal Çeşitleri: Seker portakal] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112121255/http://www.turuncgiller.com/seker.htm |date=2012-01-12 }} (in Turkish)&lt;/ref&gt; ''succari'' in Egypt, and ''lima'' in Brazil.&lt;ref name=Kimball /&gt;

The lack of acid, which protects orange juice against spoilage in other groups, renders them generally unfit for processing as juice, so they are primarily eaten. They remain profitable in areas of local consumption, but rapid spoilage renders them unsuitable for export to major population centres of Europe, Asia, or the United States.&lt;ref name=Kimball /&gt;

===Hybrids===
Sweet oranges have also given rise to a range of hybrids, notably the grapefruit, which arose from a sweet orange x pomelo backcross. A spontaneous backcross of the grapefruit and sweet orange then resulted in the [[orangelo]].  Spontaneous and engineered backcrosses between the sweet orange and mandarin oranges or tangerines has produced a group collectively known as [[tangor]]s, which includes the [[clementine]] and [[Murcott (fruit)|Murcott]].  More complex crosses have also been produced.  The so-called Ambersweet orange is actually a complex sweet orange x (Orlando [[tangelo]] x clementine) hybrid, legally designated a sweet orange in the United States so it can be used in orange juices.&lt;ref name="Talon" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Bai | first1=Jinhe | last2=Baldwin | first2=Elizabeth B| last3=Hearn | first3=Jake | last4=Driggers |first4=Randy | last5=Stover | first5=Ed | title=Volatile Profile Comparison of USDA Sweet Orange-like Hybrids versus ‘Hamlin’ and ‘Ambersweet’ | year=2014 | journal=HortScience | volume=49 | pages=1262-1267 |url=http://hortsci.ashspublications.org/content/49/10/1262.full}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[citrange]]s are a group of intergeneric sweet orange x trifoliate orange hybrids.

=== Sensory factors ===
[[File:Octyl acetate.svg|thumb|upright|alt=Skeletal model of octyl acetate|[[Octyl acetate]], a volatile compound contributing to the fragrance of oranges]]

The taste of oranges is determined mainly by the relative ratios of sugars and acids, whereas orange aroma derives from [[volatile organic compound]]s, including [[alcohol]]s, [[aldehyde]]s, [[ketone]]s, [[terpene]]s, and [[ester]]s.&lt;ref name="tietel"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=20812381|year=2011|author1=Tietel|first1=Z|title=Taste and aroma of fresh and stored mandarins|journal=Journal of the Science of Food and Agriculture|volume=91|issue=1|pages=14–23|last2=Plotto|first2=A|last3=Fallik|first3=E|last4=Lewinsohn|first4=E|last5=Porat|first5=R|doi=10.1002/jsfa.4146}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="hadi"&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23852166|year=2013|author1=El Hadi|first1=M.

=== Nutritional value and phytochemicals ===

As with other citrus fruits, orange pulp is an excellent source of [[vitamin C]], providing 64% of the [[Daily Value]] in a 100&amp;nbsp;g serving (right table). Numerous other [[essential nutrients]] are present in low amounts (right table).

=== Grading ===
{{See also|Food grading}}
The [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) has established the following grades for Florida oranges, which primarily apply to oranges sold as fresh fruit: US Fancy, US No. 1 Bright, US No. 1, US No. 1 Golden, US No. 1 Bronze, US No. 1 Russet, US No. 2 Bright, US No. 2, US No. 2 Russet, and US No. 3.&lt;ref name=usda_fla&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110726100358/http://www.ams.usda.gov/AMSv1.0/getfile?dDocName=STELPRDC5050382 United States Standards for Grades of Florida Oranges and Tangelos] (USDA; February, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The general characteristics graded are color (both hue and uniformity), firmness, maturity, varietal characteristics, texture, and shape. ''Fancy'', the highest grade, requires the highest grade of color and an absence of blemishes&lt;!--original read "the highest grade of both color and blemishes". Makes no sense to me, but I'll leave it here just in case (far from an expert on the subject)--&gt;, while the terms ''Bright'', ''Golden'', ''Bronze'', and ''Russet'' concern solely discoloration.

Grade numbers are determined by the amount of unsightly blemishes on the skin and firmness of the fruit that do not affect consumer safety. The USDA separates blemishes into three categories:
# General blemishes: ammoniation, buckskin, caked melanose, creasing, decay, scab, split navels, sprayburn, undeveloped segments, unhealed segments, and wormy fruit
# Injuries to fruit: bruises, green spots, oil spots, rough, wide, or protruding navels, scale, scars, [[skin breakdown]], and thorn scratches
# Damage caused by dirt or other foreign material, disease, dryness, or mushy condition, hail, insects, riciness or woodiness, and sunburn.&lt;ref name=usda_fla /&gt;

The USDA uses a separate grading system for oranges used for juice because appearance and texture are irrelevant in this case. There are only two grades: US Grade AA Juice and US Grade A Juice, which are given to the oranges before processing. Juice grades are determined by three factors:
# The juiciness of the orange
# The amount of solids in the juice (at least 10% solids are required for the AA grade)
# The proportion of anhydric [[citric acid]] in fruit solids

== Cultivation ==

=== Climate ===
[[File:Schnee Orange, Citrus × aurantium 1.JPG|thumb|An orange tree covered and damaged from [[snow]], in the [[Netherlands]]]]
[[File:California Orange Grove2.jpg|thumb|right|Orange grove in [[California]]]]

Like most citrus plants, oranges do well under moderate temperatures—between {{convert|15.5|and|29|°C|°F}}—and require considerable amounts of sunshine and water. It has been suggested the use of water resources by the citrus industry in the Middle East is a contributing factor to the [[desiccation]] of the region. Another significant element in the full development of the fruit is the temperature variation between summer and winter and, between day and night. In cooler climates, oranges can be grown indoors.

As oranges are sensitive to [[frost]], there are different methods to prevent frost damage to crops and trees when subfreezing temperatures are expected. A common process is to spray the trees with water so as to cover them with a thin layer of ice that will stay just ''at'' the freezing point, insulating them even if air temperatures drop far lower. This is because water continues to lose heat as long as the environment is colder than it is, and so the water turning to ice in the environment cannot damage the trees. This practice, however, offers protection only for a very short time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newton.dep.anl.gov/askasci/gen01/gen01243.htm |title=How Cold Can Water Get? |work=NEWTON BBS |publisher=[[Argonne National Laboratory]] |date=2002-09-08 |accessdate=2009-04-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another procedure is burning fuel oil in [[smudge pot]]s put between the trees. These devices burn with a great deal of particulate emission, so condensation of water vapour on the particulate soot prevents condensation on plants and raises the air temperature very slightly. Smudge pots were developed for the first time after a disastrous freeze in Southern California in January 1913 destroyed a whole crop.&lt;ref name='moore'&gt;{{cite journal |last=Moore |first=Frank Ensor |title=Redlands Astride the Freeway: The Development of Good Automobile Roads |publisher=Moore Historical Foundation |location=Redlands, California |year=1995 |page=9 |isbn =0-914167-07-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Propagation ===
{{See also|Fruit tree propagation|Citrus rootstock}}
It is possible to grow orange trees directly from seeds, but they may be infertile or produce fruit that may be different from its parent. For the seed of a commercial orange to grow, it must be kept moist at all times. One approach is placing the seeds between two sheets of damp paper towel until they germinate and then planting them, although many cultivators just set the seeds straight into the soil.

Commercially grown orange trees are [[plant propagation|propagated]] [[asexual reproduction|asexually]] by [[grafting]] a mature [[cultivar]] onto a suitable [[seedling]] [[rootstock]] to ensure the same [[Crop yield|yield]], identical fruit characteristics, and resistance to diseases throughout the years. Propagation involves two stages: first, a rootstock is grown from seed. Then, when it is approximately one year old, the leafy top is cut off and a [[bud]] taken from a specific [[scion (grafting)|scion]] variety, is grafted into its bark. The scion is what determines the variety of orange, while the rootstock makes the tree resistant to pests and diseases and adaptable to specific [[Soil type|soil]] and climatic conditions. Thus, rootstocks influence the rate of growth and have an effect on fruit yield and quality.&lt;ref name="Lacey"&gt;{{cite web |last=Lacey |first=Kevin |title=Citrus rootstocks for WA |url=http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/objtwr/imported_assets/content/hort/fn/cp/citrusfruits/ag%20dept%20fn539%20lores.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131112025544/http://www.agric.wa.gov.au/objtwr/imported_assets/content/hort/fn/cp/citrusfruits/ag%20dept%20fn539%20lores.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2013-11-12 |publisher=Government of WA.

Rootstocks must be compatible with the variety inserted into them because otherwise, the tree may decline, be less productive, or die.&lt;ref name="Lacey" /&gt;

Among the several advantages to grafting are that trees mature uniformly and begin to bear fruit earlier than those reproduced by seeds (3 to 4 years in contrast with 6 to 7 years),&lt;ref name="Citrus"&gt;{{cite web |last=Dr Price |first=Martin|title=Citrus Propagation and Rootstocks |url=http://www.ultimatecitrus.com/pdf/tncitrus.htm |publisher=ultimatecitrus.com |accessdate=30 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that it makes it possible to combine the best attributes of a scion with those of a rootstock.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100528003825/http://www.ars-grin.gov/ars/SoAtlantic/fp/hb/bowman/citrus.html Citrus Propagation].

=== Harvest ===
Canopy-shaking mechanical harvesters are being used increasingly in Florida to harvest oranges. Current canopy shaker machines use a series of six-to-seven-foot-long tines to shake the tree canopy at a relatively constant &lt;!--shaking--&gt; stroke and frequency.&lt;ref&gt;Ehsani, R. ''et al.'' (June 2007) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726020405/http://www.fshs.org/Meetings/2007/FSHS_2007_abstracts.pdf "In-situ Measurement of the Actual Detachment Force of Oranges Harvested by a Canopy Shaker Harvesting Machine"]. ''Abstracts for the 2007 Joint Annual Meeting of the Florida State Horticulture Society''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Normally, oranges are picked once they are pale orange.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://freshcitrusdirect.wordpress.com/tag/riverland/|title=Fresh Citrus Direct|publisher=freshcitrusdirect.wordpress.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150110071334/https://freshcitrusdirect.wordpress.com/tag/riverland/|archivedate=2015-01-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Degreening ===
Oranges must be mature when harvested. In the United States, laws forbid harvesting immature fruit for human consumption in Texas, Arizona, California and Florida.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{cite web|title=Harvesting and Pre-pack Handling|url=http://aggie-horticulture.tamu.edu/citrus/l2294.htm|publisher=The Texas A&amp;M University System|accessdate=29 November 2012|author1=Wagner, Alfred B.  |author2=Sauls, Julian W.  |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ripe oranges, however, often have some green or yellow-green color in the skin. [[Ethylene]] gas is used to turn green skin to orange. This process is known as "degreening", also called "gassing", "sweating", or "curing".&lt;ref name="Wagner" /&gt; Oranges are non-[[Climacteric (botany)|climacteric]] fruits and cannot post-harvest ripen internally in response to ethylene gas, though they will de-green externally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://postharvest.ucdavis.edu/PFfruits/Orange/|title=Orange: Recommendations for Maintaining Postharvest Quality|author1=Arpaia, Mary Lu  |author2=Kader, Adel A.  |lastauthoramp=yes |publisher=UCDavis Postharvest Technology Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Storage ===
[[File:2010-12-14 Maroc Agadir Soukh local market.jpg|thumb|alt=A stand with oranges, a man next to it, a cat on the floor|A stand with oranges at a market in [[Morocco]]]]
Commercially, oranges can be stored by refrigeration in controlled-atmosphere chambers for up to 12 weeks after harvest. Storage life ultimately depends on cultivar, maturity, pre-harvest conditions, and handling.&lt;ref&gt;Ritenour, M.A. [http://www.ba.ars.usda.gov/hb66/100orange.pdf Orange] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120127220523/http://www.ba.ars.usda.gov/hb66/100orange.pdf |date=2012-01-27 }}. From [http://www.ba.ars.usda.gov/hb66/ The Commercial Storage of Fruits, Vegetables, and Florist and Nursery Stocks] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120422200934/http://www.ba.ars.usda.gov/hb66/ |date=2012-04-22 }}. USDA (2004)&lt;/ref&gt; In stores and markets, however, oranges should be displayed on non-refrigerated shelves.

At home, oranges have a shelf life of about one month.&lt;ref name=cpma&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cpma.ca/Files/CPMA.HomeStorageGuide.English.pdf|title=Home Storage Guide for Fresh Fruits &amp; Vegetables.

=== Pests and diseases ===
{{See also|List of citrus diseases}}

==== Cottony cushion scale ====
The first major pest that attacked orange trees in the United States was the cottony cushion scale (''[[Icerya purchasi]]''), imported from Australia to California in 1868. Within 20 years, it wiped out the citrus orchards around Los Angeles, and limited orange growth throughout California. In 1888, the USDA sent Alfred Koebele to Australia to study this [[scale insect]] in its native habitat. He brought back with him specimens of ''Novius cardinalis'', an Australian [[Coccinellidae|ladybird beetle]], and within a decade the pest was controlled&lt;!--original read, "controlled or eradicated", which makes no sense. As source is not available on G books, I can't make out if the sense is "controlled AND". Leaving it up to more knowledgeable ppl.--&gt;.&lt;ref name=coit /&gt;

==== Citrus greening disease&lt;!--linked from 'Forest pathology'--&gt; ====
The [[Huanglongbing|citrus greening disease]], caused by the bacterium ''[[Liberobacter asiaticum]]'', has been the most serious threat to orange production since 2010. It is characterized by streaks of different shades on the leaves, and deformed, poorly colored, unsavory fruit. In areas where the disease is endemic, citrus trees live for only five to eight years and never bear fruit suitable for consumption.&lt;ref name=halbert /&gt; In the western hemisphere, the disease was discovered in Florida in 1998, where it has attacked nearly all the trees ever since. It was reported in Brazil by Fundecitrus Brasil in 2004.&lt;ref name=halbert&gt;''Asian Citrus Psllids (Sternorryncha: Psyllidae) and Greening Disease of Citrus'', by Susan E. Halbert and Keremane L. Manjunath, Florida Entomologist (Abstract. September 2004) p.&amp;nbsp;330 [http://www.fcla.edu/FlaEnt/fe87p330.pdf FCLA.edu]&lt;/ref&gt; As from 2009, 0.87% of the trees in Brazil's main orange growing areas (São Paulo and Minas Gerais) showed symptoms of greening, an increase of 49% over 2008.&lt;ref name=gainbr9006&gt;[http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Commodity%20Report_CITRUS%20SEMI-ANNUAL_Sao%20Paulo%20ATO_Brazil_6-18-2009.pdf GAIN Report Number: BR9006], USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (June, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

The disease is spread primarily by two species of [[psyllid]] insects. One of them is the Asian citrus psyllid (''[[Diaphorina citri]]'' Kuwayama), an efficient [[Vector (epidemiology)|vector]] of the ''Liberobacter asiaticum''. [[Generalist and specialist species|Generalist]] predators such as the ladybird beetles ''[[Curinus coeruleus]]'', ''[[Olla v-nigrum]]'', ''[[Harmonia axyridis]]'', and ''[[Cycloneda sanguinea]]'', and the [[Neuroptera|lacewings]] ''[[Ceraeochrysa]] spp.'' and ''[[Chrysoperla]] spp.'' make significant contribution to the mortality of the Asian citrus psyllid, which results in 80–100% reduction in psyllid populations. In contrast, parasitism by ''[[Tamarixia radiata]]'', a species-specific parasitoid of the Asian citrus psyllid, is variable and generally low in southwest Florida: in 2006, it amounted to a reduction of less than 12% from May to September and 50% in November.

In 2007, foliar applications of insecticides reduced psyllid populations for a short time, but also suppressed the populations of predatory ladybird beetles. Soil application of [[aldicarb]] provided limited control of Asian citrus psyllid, while drenches of [[imidacloprid]] to young trees were effective for two months or more.&lt;ref&gt;Qureshi, Jawwad A. and Stansly, Philip A. (June 2007) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726020405/http://www.fshs.org/Meetings/2007/FSHS_2007_abstracts.pdf "Integrated approaches for managing the Asian citrus psyllid (Homoptera: Psyllidae) in Florida"]. Abstracts for the 2007 Joint Annual Meeting of the Florida State Horticulture Society&lt;/ref&gt;

Management of citrus greening disease is difficult and requires an integrated approach that includes use of clean stock, elimination of inoculum via voluntary and regulatory means, use of pesticides to control psyllid vectors in the citrus crop, and biological control of psyllid vectors in non-crop reservoirs. Citrus greening disease is not under completely successful management.&lt;ref name=halbert /&gt;

==== Greasy spot ====
Greasy spot, a [[Fungal infection in plants|fungal disease]] caused by the ''[[Mycosphaerella citri]]'', produces leaf spots and premature defoliation, thus reducing the tree's vigour and yield. [[Ascospore]]s of ''M. citri'' are generated in [[Ascocarp|pseudothecia]] in decomposing fallen leaves.&lt;ref&gt;Mondal, S.N. ''et al.'' (June 2007) [https://web.archive.org/web/20110726020405/http://www.fshs.org/Meetings/2007/FSHS_2007_abstracts.pdf "Effect of Water Management and Soil Application of Nitrogen Fertilizers, Petroleum Oils, and Lime on Inoculum Production by Mycosphaerella citri, the Cause of Citrus Greasy Spot"]. Abstracts for the 2007 Joint Annual Meeting of the Florida State Horticulture Society&lt;/ref&gt; Once mature, ascospores are ejected and subsequently dispersed by air currents.

Brazil is the world's leading orange producer, with an output of 17 million tonnes, followed by China, India, and the United States as the four major producers.&lt;ref name=fao14 /&gt; As almost 99% of the fruit is processed for export, 53% of total global [[Orange juice#Frozen concentrated orange juice|frozen concentrated orange juice]] production comes from this area and the western part of the state of [[Minas Gerais]]. In Brazil, the four predominant orange varieties used for obtaining juice are Hamlin, Pera Rio, Natal, and Valencia.&lt;ref name=gainbrazil&gt;[http://gain.fas.usda.gov/Recent%20GAIN%20Publications/Citrus%20Semi-annual_Sao%20Paulo%20ATO_Brazil_17-6-2010.pdf GAIN Report Number: BR10005], USDA Foreign Agricultural Service (6/15/2010)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=credit&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.credfinrisk.com/fcoj.html|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317115712/http://www.credfinrisk.com/fcoj.html|title=Frozen Concentrated Orange Juice (FCOJ) Commodity Market – Credit and Finance Risk Analysis|archivedate=17 March 2012|work=credfinrisk.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, groves are located mainly in [[Florida]], [[California]], and [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Oranges: Production Map by State|url=https://www.nass.usda.gov/Charts_and_Maps/Citrus_Fruits/orgmap.php|publisher=US Department of Agriculture|accessdate=1 April 2017|date=1 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The majority of California's crop is sold as fresh fruit, whereas Florida's oranges are destined to juice products. The [[Indian River (Florida)|Indian River]] area of Florida is known for the high quality of its juice, which often is sold fresh in the United States and frequently blended with juice produced in other regions because Indian River trees yield very sweet oranges, but in relatively small quantities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=History of the Indian River Citrus District |url=http://ircitrusleague.org/history/ |publisher=Indian River Citrus League (ircitrusleague.org) |accessdate=27 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Production of orange juice between the São Paulo and mid-south Florida areas makes up roughly 85% of the world market. Brazil exports 99% of its production, while 90% of Florida's production is consumed in the United States.&lt;ref name=us&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/horticulture/citrus/2004%20Citrus.pdf |format=PDF |title=USDA – U.S and the World Situation: Citrus |author=USDA Foreign Agricultural Service |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120604113031/http://www.fas.usda.gov/htp/horticulture/citrus/2004%20Citrus.pdf |archivedate=June 4, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Juice and other products ==
&lt;!--[[File:Harvest Kinnow.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Kinnow]], a variety of [[Mandarin orange]] widely cultivated in Pakistan ]]--&gt;

Oranges, whose flavor may vary from [[sweet]] to [[sour]], are commonly peeled and eaten fresh or squeezed for juice. The thick bitter rind is usually discarded, but can be processed into animal feed by [[desiccation]], using [[pressure]] and heat. It also is used in certain recipes as a food flavoring or [[garnish (food)|garnish]]. The outermost layer of the rind can be thinly grated with a [[zester]] to produce orange [[zest (ingredient)|zest]]. Zest is popular in cooking because it contains oils and has a strong flavor similar to that of the orange pulp. The white part of the rind, including the pith, is a source of [[pectin]] and has nearly the same amount of vitamin C as the flesh and other nutrients.

Although not as juicy or tasty as the flesh, orange peel is edible and has significant contents of vitamin C, [[dietary fiber]], total [[polyphenol]]s, [[carotenoid]]s, [[limonene]] and [[dietary minerals]], such as [[potassium]] and [[magnesium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Food Chem|year=2012|volume=134|issue=4|pages=1892–8|doi=10.1016/j.foodchem.2012.03.090|title=Antioxidant capacity and mineral content of pulp and peel from commercial cultivars of citrus from Brazil|authors=Barros HR, Ferreira TA, Genovese MI|pmid=23442635}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Products made from oranges ===
[[File:Sevilleorangemarmalade.jpg|thumb|upright|Jar of marmalade]]
* [[Orange juice]] is obtained by squeezing the fruit on a special tool (a ''juicer'' or ''squeezer'') and collecting the juice in a tray underneath. This can be made at home or, on a much larger scale, industrially. Brazil is the largest producer of orange juice in the world, followed by the United States, where it is one of the commodities traded on the [[New York Board of Trade]].
* Frozen orange juice concentrate is made from freshly squeezed and filtered orange juice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ultimatecitrus.com/Story/oj_story.html|title=The Story of Florida Orange Juice: From the Grove to Your Glass|author=Townsend, Chet }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Sweet [[orange oil]] is a [[by-product]] of the juice industry produced by pressing the peel. It is used for [[flavoring]] food and drinks and also in the perfume industry and [[aromatherapy]] for its [[fragrance]]. Sweet orange oil consists of approximately 90% [[limonene|&lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-limonene]], a [[solvent]] used in various household chemicals, such as wood conditioners for furniture and—along with other citrus oils—detergents and hand cleansers. It is an efficient cleaning agent with a pleasant smell, promoted for being environmentally friendly and therefore, preferable to petrochemicals. &lt;small&gt;D&lt;/small&gt;-limonene is, however, classified from slightly toxic to humans,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |vauthors=Kegley SE, Hill BR, Orme S, Choi AH |title=Limonene |work=PAN Pesticide Database |publisher=Pesticide Action Network |url=http://www.pesticideinfo.org/Detail_Chemical.jsp?Rec_Id=PC32811}}&lt;/ref&gt; to very toxic to marine life in different countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=April 2005 |title=D-LIMONENE |publisher=[[International Programme on Chemical Safety]] |url=http://www.inchem.org/documents/icsc/icsc/eics0918.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Marmalade]] preserves are traditionally made with [[Seville orange]]s, which are less sweet. All parts of the fruit are used: the pith and pips (separated and placed in a muslin bag) are boiled in a mixture of juice, slivered peel, sliced-up flesh, sugar, and water to extract their pectin, which helps the conserve to set.
* Orange peel is used by gardeners as a slug repellent.

'''''Oreichthys crenuchoides''''' is a small (~2.5" TL) [[cyprinid]] found in [[Assam]], [[India]]. It is imported for the aquarium trade under the name neon highfin barb or high-fin variable barb. It is an atypical ''Oreichthys'' in that the face is more rounded than in ''[[Oreichthys cosuatis|O. cosuatis]]'' and other ''Oreichthys'' species.&lt;ref name=FB&gt;{{FishBase species |genus= Oreichthys |species= crenuchoides | month = November| year = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are strictly freshwater, and are found in ditches, ponds and streams.

==Taxonomic Issues==
The name '''''Oreichthys umangii''''' under which it was known in the aquarium trade, is not an available scientific name under the [[International Code of Zoological Nomenclature]], and must not be used as such. The name was introduced in an aquarium book (Tekriwal et al., 1995), but without accompanying description, and was intended to honor Umang Tekriwal (1975-11-14 to 1996-04-19), son of ''Ornamental Aquarium Fishes of India'' co-author Kishori Tekriwal.

A '''polymer matrix composite''' (PMC) is a [[composite material]] composed of a variety of short or continuous fibers bound together by an organic polymer matrix. PMCs are designed to transfer loads between fibers through the matrix. Some of the advantages with PMCs include their lightweight, high stiffness and their high strength along the direction of their reinforcements. Other advantages are good abrasion resistance and good corrosion resistance.&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.princeton.edu/~ota/disk2/1988/8801/880106.PDF |title=Advanced Materials by Design (Part 6 of 18) |website=Princeton.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Introduction==
PMCs are divided into two categories: reinforced plastics, and [[Advanced composite materials (engineering)|advanced composites]]. The two categories differ in their level of mechanical properties. '''Reinforced plastics''' typically consists of polyester resins reinforced with low-stiffness glass fibers. '''[[Advanced composite materials (engineering)|Advanced Composites]]''' consist of fiber and matrix combinations that yield superior strength and stiffness. The PMC is designed so that the mechanical loads that are being applied to the material is being supported by the reinforcements. The function of the matrix is to bond the fibers together and to transfer loads between them.&lt;ref name="princeton.edu"/&gt;

==Composition==
===Fibers===
PMCs contain about 60 percent reinforcing fiber by volume. The fibers that are commonly found and used within PMCs include fiberglass, graphite and aramid. Fiberglass has a relatively low stiffness at the same time exhibits a competitive tensile strength compared to other fibers. The cost of fiberglass is also dramatically lower than the other fibers which is why fiberglass is one of the most widely used fiber. &lt;ref name="princeton.edu"/&gt;
The reinforcing fibers have their highest mechanical properties along their lengths rather than their widths. Thus, the reinforcing fibers maybe arranged and oriented in different forms and directions to provide different physical properties and advantages based on the application.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.substech.com/dokuwiki/doku.php?id=polymer_matrix_composites_introduction |title=Polymer Matrix Composites (introduction) |website=SubsTech.com |date=2006-11-06 |accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://netcomposites.com/guide-tools/guide/introduction/polymer-composites/ |title=Composite materials guide: Introduction - Polymer Composites &amp;#124; NetComposites Now |website=Netcomposites.com |date=2017-03-31 |accessdate=2017-04-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Matrix===
The properties of the matrix determines the resistance of the PMC to processes that includes impact damage, water absorption, chemical attack, and high-temperature creep.

==Drawbacks of Polymer matrix==
# Environmental degradation{{cn|date=October 2017}}
# Moisture absorption from environment causes swelling in the polymer as well as a decrease of Tg.
# The moisture absorption increases at moderately high temperatures. These hydrothermal effects can lead to internal stresses in the presence of fibres in polymer composites.
# A thermal mismatch between polymer and fibre may cause cracking or debonding at the interface.

A [[radiation accident]] occurred in [[Samut Prakan Province]], [[Thailand]] in January–February 2000. The accident happened when an insecurely stored unlicensed [[cobalt-60]] radiation source was recovered by [[scrap metal]] collectors who, together with a [[scrapyard]] worker, subsequently dismantled the container, unknowingly exposing themselves and others nearby to [[ionizing radiation]]. Over the following weeks, those exposed developed symptoms of [[radiation sickness]] and eventually sought medical attention. The [[Office of Atomic Energy for Peace]] (OAEP), Thailand's nuclear regulatory agency, was notified when doctors came to suspect radiation injury, some seventeen days after the initial exposure. The OAEP sent an emergency response team to locate and contain the radiation source, which was estimated to have an activity of {{convert|15.7|TBq|lk=in}}, and was eventually traced to its owner. Investigations found failure to ensure secure storage of the radiation source to be the root cause of the accident, which resulted in ten people being hospitalized for radiation injury, three of whom died, as well as the potentially significant exposure of 1,872 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Lessons Learned The Hard Way|journal=IAEA Bulletin|volume=47|issue=2|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull472/htmls/lessons_learned.html|accessdate=10 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100718065554/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull472/htmls/lessons_learned.html|archivedate=18 July 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Nci-vol-1819-300 cobalt 60 therapy.jpg|thumb|Cobalt-60 is used as a radiation source for radiotherapy (specifically, [[cobalt therapy]]).]]
[[Cobalt-60]] (&lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co) is a synthetic [[radioactive]] [[isotope]] of [[cobalt]], with a [[half-life]] of 5.27 years, and emits highly penetrating [[gamma ray]]s. It is commonly used as a radiation source for [[radiotherapy]] and equipment sterilization in the hospital setting, and has several other industrial uses as well. The device involved in the Samut Prakan accident was a rotational Gammatron-3 [[teletherapy]] unit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Siemens: from single room to great center|journal=Radiology|date=April 1965|volume=84|issue=4|pages=19A|url=http://radiology.rsna.org/content/84/4/local/front-matter.pdf|accessdate=29 April 2012|publisher=Radiological Society Of North America|doi=10.1148/84-4-767}}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} (Siemens ads with a picture of a Gammatron-3 unit)&lt;/ref&gt;  manufactured by [[Siemens]] and imported to Thailand in 1969. It was licensed for and installed at [[Ramathibodi Hospital]] in Bangkok;&lt;ref name="appeal" /&gt; the radiation source involved was a replacement installed in 1981, with an initial [[radioactive decay#Radioactive decay rates| radioactive activity]] of {{convert|196|TBq|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 1, 5, 7.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of the accident in 2000, its activity was estimated to have decayed to {{convert|15.7|TBq|abbr=on}}.

The licensing of [[radioisotope]]s and nuclear material for import, export, possession and use in Thailand is regulated by the Thai Atomic Energy Commission for Peace and its working body, the [[Office of Atoms for Peace]] (OAP),  formerly known as the Office of Atomic Energy for Peace (OAEP). In principle, the licensing process would involve annual safety inspections, but due to lack of personnel and resources, such inspections were not always properly done, nor were regulatory and control protocols strictly enforced.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 3–4.&lt;/ref&gt;

The hospital retired the radiotherapy unit in 1994 and acquired a new one from [[Nordion]] via its Thai agent [[Kamol Sukosol Electric Company]] (KSE).{{efn|KSE was the local agent of Theratronics Ltd., who was in that time a subsidiary of MDS  Nordion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Public accounts of Canada, 1991|year=1991|pages=IV-46|url=https://archive.org/stream/v3publicacc1991canauoft#page/46/mode/2up|author=Government of Canada|accessdate=29 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}&lt;ref name="appeal" /&gt;&lt;!--The Court of Appeals citation verifies the name of the company, which is referred to only as KSE in the IAEA report.--&gt;&lt;ref name="IAEA 5"&gt;IAEA 2002, p. 5 &lt;/ref&gt; The old unit and its &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co source could not be returned either to its original German manufacturer Siemens, which had stopped producing or servicing them, or to the Canadian supplier Nordion, which was not the original manufacturer. Consequently, the hospital sold the old unit to KSE, which already had another licensed unit in storage. However, neither the hospital nor KSE informed the OAEP of the transfer. In 1996 an OAEP inspection found that KSE had three unlicensed units in its warehouse, which had been licensed for the storage of a single unit in 1988.&lt;ref name="IAEA 6-7"&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 6–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

KSE's lease of the warehouse was terminated in 1999. KSE subsequently returned the licensed unit, while moving the three unregistered units to an unused car park in Bangkok's [[Prawet District]], which was owned by its parent company. The car park was fenced, but the fence had been breached and nearby residents regularly entered to play football in its empty areas. KSE notified the OAEP of its transfer of the licensed unit, but did not mention the other three, which remained [[orphan source]]s.&lt;ref name="IAEA 6-7" /&gt;

In Thailand, many underprivileged people make a living by collecting and/or trading recyclables and [[scrap]] materials. They are popularly referred to as ''saleng'' ({{lang-th|ซาเล้ง}}) after the tricycle-carts they usually use to transport their goods.&lt;ref name="Thongpraparn" /&gt;
--&gt;

==Accident==
[[File:Teletherapy Capsule.jpg|thumb|upright=0.85|Diagram of a generic teletherapy source unit. The radioactive material (G) is embedded within protective metal canisters.]]
On 24 January 2000, the part of the radiation therapy unit containing the radiation source was acquired by two scrap collectors, who claimed to have bought it from some strangers as scrap metal for resale. They took it home, planning to dismantle it later. On 1 February, the two, together with another two associates, attempted to dismantle the metal part (a 97-kilogram, 42-by-20-centimetre lead cylinder held in a stainless steel casing), which was the unit's source drawer. Using a hammer and chisel, they only managed to crack the welded seam. Two of the men then took the metal piece, along with other scrap metal, to a scrapyard on Soi Wat Mahawong in [[Phra Pradaeng District]], [[Samut Prakan Province]]. There they asked a worker at the scrapyard to cut open the cylinder using an [[oxyacetylene torch]]. As the cylinder was cut open, two smaller cylindrical metal pieces, which had held the source capsule, fell out. The worker retrieved the two pieces and kept them in the scrapyard, but was unaware of the source capsule itself. The lead cylinder was returned to the scrap collectors for them to complete the disassembly.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 8–10.&lt;/ref&gt;

That same day, the four men present when the cylinder was opened (two of the scrap collectors and two scrapyard employees) began to feel ill, experiencing headaches, nausea and vomiting. The scrap collectors succeeded in taking the lead cylinder apart, and took the parts to sell at the scrapyard the next day. The scrapyard employees continued to feel sick during the following week, and on 12 February the scrapyard owner, believing the metal to be causing the illness, asked the scrap collector to take it elsewhere, and had the two smaller metal pieces thrown away.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 10–11.&lt;/ref&gt;

By mid-February the symptoms of those involved were worsening; the symptoms included burn wounds, swollen hands, diarrhoea, fever, and hair loss. One of the scrap collectors went to Samut Prakan Hospital on 15 February and was admitted the next day, while the two scrapyard employees were also admitted, on 16 and 17 February. The scrapyard owner's husband was admitted to Bangkok General Hospital on 17 February due to [[epistaxis]] (nosebleeds), while the scrapyard owner, her mother, and her maid (all of whom lived across the street from the scrapyard and sometimes entered) also began to feel ill. A stray dog that was often seen in the scrapyard also died.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

Two of the patients at Samut Prakan Hospital were admitted to the surgical ward, while the other was admitted to the medical ward. All were nauseated and vomiting, and two of them were showing [[leukopenia]] (low white blood cell count). Reviewing the cases on 18 February, the doctors realized their symptoms were likely caused by radiation exposure, and notified the OAEP.&lt;ref name="IAEA 12"&gt;IAEA 2002, p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Response==
Upon receiving notification, the OAEP sent two officers to investigate, who met the doctors and patients at the hospital shortly after noon on 18 February. After questioning the scrapyard owner, they searched for the cylindrical metal pieces initially suspected to be the radiation source, but found that they were not radioactive. They then headed to the scrapyard, and noted abnormally high levels of radiation as they approached, late in the evening. At the scrapyard entrance they measured radiation at an equivalent dose of 1 [[millisievert]] per hour (mSv/h) and decided to request additional assistance.&lt;ref name="IAEA 12" /&gt;

Recognizing the event as a serious radiological accident, the OAEP organized an emergency response team to manage the situation, in conjunction with the local public health and civil defense authorities. They conducted contamination and radiation level surveys and found that there was no contamination, but the radiation dose rate was as high as 10 mSv/h near the source, which kept them from getting close enough to determine what the source was. Surveys to locate the source continued throughout the night. The scrapyard and immediate vicinity were cordoned off, but evacuation was deemed unnecessary.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 15–16.&lt;/ref&gt;

Retrieval operations began in the afternoon of the following day (19 February 2000), after planning and rehearsing. An [[excavator]] was used to clear the way into the scrapyard, and a lead wall was placed to help [[Lead shielding|shield]] operators from radiation. Scrap metal pieces near the source were removed one by one, using a grasping tool for large pieces, and an improvised [[electromagnet]] attached to a {{convert|5|m|adj=on}} bamboo rod for smaller ones.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt; A high range radiation dose rate probe was used to screen these metal pieces for radioactivity. A [[fluorescent screen]] was used to ultimately determine the exact location of the source, but the team had to wait for cloud cover to reduce moonlight enough to see properly. The source capsule was finally retrieved shortly after midnight and placed in a shielded container. It was identified by in situ [[gamma spectroscopy]] as &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co, and had an estimated activity of {{convert|15.7|TBq}}.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 16–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

The &lt;sup&gt;60&lt;/sup&gt;Co source was transferred for storage at the OAEP headquarters. Subsequent surveys found radiation in the scrapyard to have returned to normal background levels. During the same time, the OAEP was informed of the three teletherapy units in the car park, and a separate investigating team found one of the units to have had its drawer assembly missing. This was confirmed to be the origin of the source, and the three units were removed for temporary storage on 21 February.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

The OAEP reported the incident to the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (IAEA), which sent a team of experts on 26 February to assist in the management of the situation and the treatment of those injured.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 21–22.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Casualties==
In total, ten people were admitted to hospital with [[radiation sickness]]: the four scrap collectors, the two scrapyard employees, the scrapyard owner, her husband, her mother, and her maid. Of these, four people (those working at the scrapyard) were estimated to have received radiation doses of over 6 [[gray (unit)|gray]] (Gy). All patients were ultimately referred to [[Rajavithi Hospital]], where they received inpatient care. All but one of the patients developed [[agranulocytosis]] or [[bicytopenia]] (depletion of white blood cells and/or platelets). Several also developed burns, and one (the first scrap collector) had to have his finger amputated. Three patients (the two scrapyard workers and the owner's husband) ultimately died of uncontrolled infection and [[sepsis]], all within two months of exposure.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 22–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to these casualties, 1,872 people living within {{convert|100|m}} of the scrapyard were potentially exposed to different levels of ionizing radiation. Physical exams and blood tests were provided to nearly half these people, who sought medical attention. Radiation doses received by OAEP personnel working to recover the radiation source did not exceed 32 mSv, as measured by individual [[thermoluminescent dosimeter]]s.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 23–24.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Public reaction and aftermath==
[[File:Radiation warning symbol.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|The [[radioactive hazard trefoil|trefoil symbol]] failed to prevent the accident, as it was not recognized by those handling the source container.]]
The accident became a subject of intense news coverage. The origin of the poorly stored radioactive source was traced to KSE, which was charged with possessing radioactive substances without permission and was fined 15,000 [[baht]] (approx US$450&lt;!-- as of June 2015 ---&gt;). [[Environmental Litigation and Advocacy for the Wants]] (EnLAW), a non-governmental [[advocacy group]], later filed a class action lawsuit against KSE on behalf of the victims, and also against the OAEP in the Administrative Court. The Administrative Court later ruled in 2003 in favour of the plaintiffs, ordering the OAEP to pay 5,222,301 baht (approx $155,000) as restitution. KSE was ordered by the Civil Court to pay a total of 640,246 baht (approx $19,000).&lt;ref name="appeal"&gt;{{cite web|script-title=th:คำพิพากษา คดีหมายเลขแดงที่ 11713-11714/2551  ศาลอุทธรณ์|url=http://enlawfoundation.org/newweb/wp-content/uploads/cobalt60_decision_appealcourt1.pdf|publisher=Court of Appeals|date=30 December 2008|accessdate=10 February 2012|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|script-title=th:คำพิพากษา คดีหมายเลขแดงที่ อ.415/2550|url=http://enlawfoundation.org/newweb/wp-content/uploads/cobalt60_decision_supremeadmincourt4.pdf|publisher=Supreme Administrative Court|date=20 December 2007|accessdate=10 February 2012|language=Thai}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In media reports of the accident, several reporters commented negatively on the emergency response team's operation, perceiving them as "not taking the matter [of radiation hazard] seriously"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kanjanachuchai|first=Songphol|title=Didn't they realise the risks involved?|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=24 February 2000}} Quoted in IAEA 2002, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; and being unprofessional and lacking training. The [[BBC]] told of "officials searching through scrap metal heaps for radioactive waste using sticks and wearing cotton gardening gloves and cloth face-masks".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Thailand probes radiation leak|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/asia-pacific/650889.stm|accessdate=10 February 2012|newspaper=BBC|date=21 February 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The IAEA defended the team in its report, noting that it included "experienced personnel with expertise in dealing with high radiation fields and control of known contamination", and that they "used innovative means to achieve rapid recovery of the source". It also commented that the [[lead apron]]s worn by some members of the response team were not appropriate for use in the situation, as they would not offer adequate protection against ionizing radiation.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 17, 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

As public concern over the accident grew while information and education was limited, misconceptions arose about the nature of radiation hazards. Residents near a Buddhist temple protested and prevented the [[cremation]] of one of the victims, believing that the body could spread radiation, despite assurances by the OAEP to the contrary.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kongrut|first=Anchalee|title=Frightened residents force family to shift cremation rite|newspaper=Bangkok Post|date=14 March 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The IAEA report noted that the main contributing factors to the accident were: difficulties in the disposal of radiation sources, the OAEP's limited oversight capacity, transfer of the disused source without the OAEP's approval, moving the sources to an unsecured location, lack of understandable warnings, and the dismantling of the device.&lt;ref&gt;IAEA 2002, pp. 41–42.&lt;/ref&gt; An article published in ''Australasian Physical &amp; Engineering Sciences in Medicine'' commented that "the most serious omission occurred when the medical users ... returned the obsolete units to the Medical Dealer without notifying the OAEP" and that their insecure storage "invited theft". It called for provisions for the safe return and verified disposal of all significant radioactive sources, and stated: "National action is needed to cope with the regulatory problem of orphan sources by maintaining accountability of sources through national registers and the legal enforcement of compliance with the regulations."&lt;ref name="Thongpraparn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thongpraparn|first=T.|author2=Chaudakshetrin, P. |author3=Buranapong, P. |title=Lesson learned from Co-60 accident in Thailand|journal=Australasian Physics &amp; Engineering Sciences in Medicine|date=1 December 2002|volume=25|issue=4|pages=172–174|doi=10.1007/BF03178291}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Logo_iso_radiation.svg|thumb|upright=0.6|alt=The ISO 21482 symbol, depicting the radiation trefoil, radiation waves, a skull, and a person running.|The subsequently created [[ISO 21482]] symbol.]]
The accident, along with other similar events, prompted the IAEA to re-evaluate the effectiveness of the [[radioactive hazard trefoil]] as a warning symbol. Although the symbol was displayed on the teletherapy head, none of those handling the device were aware of its meaning, nor were there written warnings in Thai. Together with the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO), the IAEA developed a new symbol that would serve as an intuitive warning for large sources of ionizing radiation. The new symbol was published in 2007 as [[ISO 21482]], and is intended to accompany the trefoil on internal components of devices containing dangerous sources to prevent persons from unknowingly disassembling them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lodding|first=Linda|title=Drop it and run!|journal=IAEA Bulletin|date=March 2007|volume=48|issue=2|pages=70–71|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull482/pdfs/18RadSymbol.pdf|accessdate=12 February 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120120125920/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull482/pdfs/18RadSymbol.pdf|archivedate=20 January 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Thailand, however, substantial efforts to prevent further such occurrences had not materialized in the months following the accident. Labour activists, trade unions and workers were lobbying for the creation of an independent occupational health and safety institute. Social critics pointed out that the accident, along with several prior disasters such as the [[Kader toy factory fire]], was part of a trend in which the country's rapid industrialization resulted in increasing health and environmental hazards due to poor regulations and lack of official willingness to tackle the issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Gill|first=Teena Amrit|title=Thais pay the price for lax radioactive safeguards|url=http://www.atimes.com/se-asia/BE27Ae02.html|accessdate=10 February 2012|newspaper=Asia Times|date=27 May 2000|agency=Inter Press Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar incidents occurred in Thailand in 2008, without injuries. In June 2008, a [[caesium-137]] sealed radioactive source was found among scrap metal sold to a scrap dealer in [[Ayutthaya Province]]. The dealer recognized the trefoil symbol, and notified the OAP, which responded and found no leak of radiation or contamination. It could not, however, determine the origins of the equipment. In August, a recycling factory in [[Chachoengsao Province]] notified the OAP after a piece of scrap  metal set off its gate detector alarm. The OAP found that the piece of metal contained [[radium-226]] sources, and concluded that it originated from unlicensed use in a lightning preventer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ya-anant|first1=N.|last2=Tiyapun|first2= K.|last3= Saiyut|first3= K.|title=Radiological accident and incident in Thailand: lesson to be learned|journal=Radiation Protection Dosimetry|date=10 May 2011|volume=146|issue=1–3|pages=111–114|doi=10.1093/rpd/ncr130|pmid=21561942}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ship tracks''' are [[cloud]]s that form around the [[exhaust gas|exhaust]] released by [[ship]]s into the still [[ocean]] air.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/images/5488/ship-tracks-over-the-atlantic|title=Ship Tracks over the Atlantic|date=2005-05-12|website=earthobservatory.nasa.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-09-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Water [[molecule]]s collect around the tiny particles ([[particulate|aerosol]]s) from exhaust to form a [[cloud seed]]. More and more water accumulates on the seed until a visible cloud is formed. In the case of ship tracks, the cloud seeds are stretched over a long narrow path where the wind has blown the ship's exhaust, so the resulting clouds resemble long strings over the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Newsroom/NewImages/images.php3?img_id=16907 | title=Ship Tracks over the Atlantic | publisher=[[NASA Earth Observatory]] | accessdate=2006-05-11}} Not available as NASA no longer supports Earth Observatory press releases (accession attempt 2017-09-21 &lt;/ref&gt; Ship tracks are a type of '''[[homogenitus]]''' cloud.&lt;ref name=ICA2017&gt;{{cite news|last1=Sutherland|first1=Scott|title=Cloud Atlas leaps into 21st century with 12 new cloud types|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/cloud-atlas-leaps-into-21st-century-with-12-new-cloud-types/80685/|accessdate=24 March 2017|work=The Weather Network|agency=Pelmorex Media|date=March 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ship tracks study==
In 1965, the first "anomalous cloud lines" were observed in images from the [[TIROS]] VII satellite. It was hypothesized that the most likely cause was from the exhaust from ships.&lt;ref name="Conover1966"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Conover, J.H. | year = 1966 | title = Anomalous cloud lines | journal = [[Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|J. Atmos. Sci.]] | volume = 23 | pages = 778–785 | doi = 10.1175/1520-0469(1966)023&lt;0778:ACL&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1966JAtS...23..778C | issn = 1520-0469 | issue = 6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many studies since have confirmed the cause, and they are now referred to as ship tracks. Scientists soon realized that the climatic impacts from aerosols could have a large effect on climate through the [[Twomey effect]],&lt;ref name="Twomey1977"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Twomey, S. | year = 1977 | title = The Influence of Pollution on the Shortwave Albedo of Clouds | journal = [[Journal of the Atmospheric Sciences|J. Atmos. Sci.]] | volume = 34 | issue = 7 | pages = 1149–1152 | doi = 10.1175/1520-0469(1977)034&lt;1149:TIOPOT&gt;2.0.CO;2|bibcode = 1977JAtS...34.1149T | issn = 1520-0469 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and that ship tracks provided an excellent laboratory for their studies.

Scientists who study how human-produced aerosols affect cloud formation observe ship tracks because in most urban areas, they are unable to discern exactly how [[pollutant]]s contribute to forming clouds because the atmosphere over the land is too tumultuous. In contrast, ships release their exhaust into the relatively clean and still marine air, where the scientists have an easier time of measuring the effects of [[fossil fuel]] emissions on cloud formation.

In general, the air above the oceans suffers from less [[turbulence]] and [[convection]] than the air above land. The lower atmosphere is especially calm over the eastern [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]] in the summertime due to a layer of hot air that settles in 500 to 700 meters above that region of the ocean. This effect creates a [[temperature inversion]], placing a cap on the cooler air below, trapping pollutants and water vapor. While the inversion is responsible for the smog that reduces air quality in [[Los Angeles]], it also allows for the formation of long lasting ship tracks. The particles billowing from ships' smokestacks enter the air above the eastern Pacific and create long, thin clouds that remain there for days. These clouds are a type known as '''homomutatus'''.&lt;ref name=ICA2017/&gt;

==Findings==
[[File:ShipTracks.jpg|thumb|Visible ship tracks in the Northern Pacific, on March 4th 2009.]]
It is theorised that [[sulfur dioxide]] released from ships' [[smokestack]]s could be forming [[sulfate]] aerosol particles in the atmosphere, which cause the clouds to be more reflective, carry more water and possibly stop [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitating]].&lt;ref name="Albrecht1989"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Albrecht, B.A. | year = 1989 | title = Aerosols, Cloud Microphysics, and Fractional Cloudiness | journal = [[Science (journal)|Science]] | volume = 245 | pages = 1227–1230 | doi = 10.1126/science.245.4923.1227 | issue = 4923 | pmid = 17747885|bibcode = 1989Sci...245.1227A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is regarded as proof that humans have been creating and modifying clouds for generations through the [[combustion]] of fossil fuels. 

Although ship tracks can sometimes be visible, researchers usually scan the [[infrared|near-infrared]] light coming off the clouds. At this wavelength many ship tracks appear as bright lines that can be distinguished from the surrounding, uncontaminated clouds. On average, polluted clouds reflect more sunlight than their unaffected counterparts.

When compared to normal clouds, the number of water droplets per volume of air in ship tracks is more than doubled, the radius of the drops is decreased by roughly six percent and the total volume of liquid water per volume of air is increased twofold. In other words, this excessive cloud seeding from the ship causes the clouds to retain more water. Normally, rain forms when cloud drops coagulate and reach a size at which [[gravity]] can pull them to the ground. Yet, in ship tracks, the cloud seeding makes the drops so small that they can no longer easily merge to reach the size needed to escape. Since no [[drizzle]] comes out of the seeded clouds, the liquid water just keeps building in the cloud. This makes the cloud brighter and more reflective to incoming sunlight, especially in the near-infrared part of the spectrum.

Surprising discoveries from recent satellite observations of several hundred ship tracks revealed that approximately 25% had a lower cloud [[albedo]] (reflectivity) than the surrounding unpolluted clouds.&lt;ref name="Chen2012"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Chen, Y.C. | year = 2012 | title = Occurrence of lower cloud albedo in ship tracks | journal = Atmospheric Chemistry and Physics | volume = 12 | pages = 8223–8235 | doi = 10.5194/acp-12-8223-2012 |bibcode = 2012ACP....12.8223C }}&lt;/ref&gt; These dimmer ship tracks tended to have significantly less water despite the strong suppression of precipitation by the aerosol plume. &lt;ref name="Christensen_and_Stephens_2012"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Christensen, M. W. | year = 2012 | title = Microphysical and macrophysical responses of marine stratocumulus polluted by underlying ships: 2. Impacts of haze on precipitating clouds | journal = [[Geophys. Res. (journal)|JGR]] | volume = 117 | doi = 10.1029/2011JD017125 |bibcode = 2012JGRD..11711203C }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dimmer ship tracks are hypothesized to occur when the air above the cloud tops is sufficiently dry. Smaller droplets in polluted clouds enhance cloud-top evaporation and entrainment. The polluted clouds thus engulf more of the overlying dry air causing them to rigorously evaporate and thin under dry meteorological conditions. Under a moist/unstable atmosphere the entrainment effect is smaller and the pollutants from the ship cause the clouds to thicken and the albedo to increase. &lt;ref name="Christensen_and_Stephens_2011"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Christensen, M. W. | year = 2011 | title = Microphysical and macrophysical responses of marine stratocumulus polluted by underlying ships: Evidence of cloud deepening | journal = [[Geophys. Res. (journal)|JGR]] | volume = 116 | doi = 10.1029/2010JD014638 |bibcode = 2011JGRD..116.3201C }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Søhøjlandet''' (English: ''The Lake-highland'') is the highest lying region in [[Denmark]] and at the same time, it has the highest density of lakes.&lt;ref name=Sohoj1&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Naturoplevelser/Beskrivelser/Fjordlandet/Det_midtjyske_Soehoejland/ Det midtjyske Søhøjland] Danish Nature Agency. {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Administrative structure==
Søhøjlandet lies within [[Central Denmark Region]] in eastern [[Jutland]] and comprise [[Silkeborg Municipality]], [[Aarhus Municipality]], [[Samsø Municipality]], [[Odder Municipality]], [[Skanderborg Municipality]], the northern part of [[Horsens Municipality]] and smaller parts of [[Hedensted Municipality]] and [[Favrskov Municipality]].&lt;ref name=Sohoj2&gt;[http://www.naturstyrelsen.dk/Lokalt/Soehoejlandet/#PublicationsList_NextLink Søhøjlandet] Danish Nature Agency. A map of the administrative borders. {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is administered by a special department under the [[Danish Nature Agency]]; ''Nature Agency - Søhøjlandet'', who has responsibility for the management of nature, outdoor activities and public guidance in the area.&lt;ref name=Sohoj2/&gt; In practice this implies tasks such as administering the forestry laws, advisory service to private woodlandowners on subsidies, advisory service about damage to or by wild animals and handling exemptions to game management within the area.

Nature Agency - Søhøjlandet has its headquarters in the southernmost part of [[Silkeborg]] known as Vejlbo, next to the research, business and educational facilities of Ferskvandscenteret (English: ''The Freshwater Centre''), north of [[Vejlsø]] lake.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.visitaqua.dk/en-GB/Forside-1.aspx?AreaID=6 AQUA]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fvc.dk/da-DK/Forside-2.aspx?AreaID=8 Ferskvandscenteret] {{da icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Nature==
The landscape of Søhøjlandet is characterized by extensive forests, lakes enclosed by woodlands, [[heathland]]s and many smaller [[meadow]]s and [[Common land#Pasture commons|pasture commons]], covering hilly terrains. Several of the larger lakes are interconnected by the [[Gudenå]], the longest river in Denmark. The river of [[Salten Å]] also marks the landscape. Several of the lakes in Søhøjlandet are of biological interest and the lake of Slåensø, is considered among the cleanest lakes in Denmark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wikisilkeborg.dk/index.php/Sl%C3%A5ens%C3%B8 |title=Slåensø|language=Danish|website=WikiSilkeborg|publisher=Silkeborg Arkiv|accessdate=26 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forests accounts for more than 30% of the total area of Søhøjlandet, primarily found in [[Silkeborg Forests]].&lt;ref name=Sohoj1/&gt;

A larger part of Søhøjlandet is to be protected and is designated as [[Natura 2000]], [[EU Habitats Directive]], [[Ramsar Convention|Ramsar]] and various bird protection areas. The bird life is rich and varied and of international importance.&lt;ref name=Sohoj1/&gt;

[[Image:Globdisttornado.jpg|thumb|300px|Areas worldwide with the highest frequency of tornadoes are indicated by orange shading.]]

[[Tornado]]es have been recorded on all continents except Antarctica and are most common in the middle latitudes where conditions are often favorable for convective storm development.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology|title=U.S. Tornado Climatology {{!}} National Centers for Environmental Information (NCEI) formerly known as National Climatic Data Center (NCDC)|website=www.ncdc.noaa.gov|access-date=2016-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States has the most tornadoes of any country, as well as the strongest and most violent tornadoes.

The United States averaged 1,274 tornadoes per year in the last decade while Canada reports nearly 100 annually (largely in the southern regions). However, the UK has most tornadoes per area per year, 0.14 per 1000&amp;nbsp;km², although these tornadoes are generally weak, and many other European countries have a similar number of tornadoes per area.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The severity of tornadoes is commonly measured by the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]], which scales tornado intensity from EF0 to EF5 by wind speed and the amount of damage they do to human environments. These judgments are made after the tornado has dissipated and the damage trail is carefully studied by weather professionals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/extremeevents/specialreports/enhanced-fujita-tornado-scale.pdf|title=The Enhanced Fujita Tornado Scale, NOAA|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tornadoes are also common in [[landfall (meteorology)|landfall]]ing [[tropical cyclone]]s, where they are focused in the right poleward section of the cyclone. Tornadoes can also be spawned as a result of [[Eye (cyclone)#Eyewall mesovortices|eyewall mesovortices]], which persist until landfall.&lt;ref name="AOML FAQ L6"&gt;{{cite web | author = [[Atlantic Oceanographic and Meteorological Laboratory]], Hurricane Research Division | title = Frequently Asked Questions: Are TC tornadoes weaker than midlatitude tornadoes?|publisher = [[NOAA]] | date = 4 October 2006 | accessdate = 2006-07-25 | url = http://www.aoml.noaa.gov/hrd/tcfaq/L6.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, favorable conditions for tornado development can occur any time of the year.

Many of these form in an area of the central (with some definitions including Southern) United States known as [[Tornado Alley]].&lt;ref name="Science News 1"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp| title = Tornado Alley, USA| accessdate = 2006-09-20| last = Perkins| first = Sid| date = 11 May 2002| work = [[Science News]]| pages = 296–298 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20060825011156/http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20020511/bob9.asp |archivedate = 25 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; This area extends into Canada, particularly the [[Prairie Provinces]] and [[Ontario]]; however, activity in Canada is less frequent and intense than that of the US. The high frequency of tornadoes in North America is largely due to geography, as moisture from the Gulf of Mexico is easily advected into the midcontinent with few topographic barriers in the way. The [[Rocky Mountains]] block Pacific-sourced moisture and buckle the [[prevailing winds|atmospheric flow]], forcing drier air at mid-levels of the [[troposphere]] due to downsloping winds and causing [[cyclogenesis]] downstream to the east of the mountains. Downsloping winds off the Rockies force the formation of a [[dry line]] when the flow aloft is strong, while the [[Gulf of Mexico]] fuels abundant low-level moisture. This unique topography allows for frequent collisions of warm and cold air, the conditions that breed strong, long-lived storms throughout the year. This area extends into Canada, particularly [[Ontario]] and the [[Prairie Provinces]], and strong tornadoes can also occur in northern Mexico.

A large region of South America is characterized by storms that reach the level of supercells and produce intense hailstorms, floods, and tornadoes during the spring, summer, and early fall. The region recently appointed as the [[:es:Pasillo de los Tornados|Tornado Corridor]] (South America) is considered as the second largest in the world in terms of the formation of extreme weather events. It covers most of central Argentina, southern Paraguay, southeastern Brazil, and Uruguay.{{citation needed|date=September 2015}}

Bangladesh and surrounding areas of eastern India suffer from a couple tornadoes annually of similar severity to stronger tornadoes in the US. These occur with a greater recurrence interval (although over a smaller region), and tend to be under-reported due to the scarcity of media coverage of a developing country. The annual human death toll from tornadoes in Bangladesh is estimated at about 179 deaths per year, which is much greater than in the US. This is likely due to the density of population, poor quality of construction, lack of tornado safety knowledge and warnings, and other factors.&lt;ref name="Bangladesh tornado"&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.colorado.edu/hazards/qr/qr169/qr169.pdf| title = The April 2004 Tornado in North-Central Bangladesh: A Case for Introducing Tornado Forecasting and Warning Systems| accessdate = 2006-08-17| author = Paul, Bhuiyan| year = 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other areas of the world that have frequent strong tornadoes include Germany, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Italy, Spain, China, and [[the Philippines]]. Australia, France, Russia, areas of the Middle East, Japan, and parts of Mexico have a history of multiple damaging tornado events.

{{further|Tornadoes in the United States}}
{{Refimprove section|date=February 2008}}

The United States averaged 1,274 tornadoes per year in the last decade. April 2011 saw the most tornadoes ever recorded for any month in the US [[National Weather Service]]'s history, 875; the previous record was 542 in one month.&lt;ref name="noaanews.noaa.gov"&gt;http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/2011_tornado_information.html&lt;/ref&gt; It has more tornadoes yearly than any other country and reports more violent (F4 and F5) tornadoes than anywhere else.

Tornadoes are common in many states but are most common to the west of the [[Appalachian Mountains]] and to the east of the [[Rocky Mountains|Rockies]]. The Atlantic seaboard states – [[North Carolina]], [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Virginia]] – are also very vulnerable, as well as Florida. The areas most vulnerable to tornadoes are the Southern Plains and Florida, though most Florida tornadoes are relatively weak. The [[Southern United States]] is one of the worst-affected regions in terms of casualties.

Tornado reports have been officially collated since 1950.  These reports have been gathered by the [[National Climatic Data Center]] (NCDC), based in [[Asheville]], North Carolina.  A tornado can be reported more than once, such as when a storm crosses a county line and reports are made from two counties.

=== Common misconceptions ===
Some people mistakenly believe that tornadoes only occur in the countryside.  This is hardly the case.  While it is true that the [[Great Plains|plains states]] are the most tornado-prone places in the nation, it should be noted that tornadoes have been reported in every U.S state, including [[Alaska]] and Hawaii.  One likely reason tornadoes are so common in the central U.S is because this is where Arctic air, cold fronts that have not been "weakened" yet first collide with warm tropical air from the [[Gulf of Mexico]].  As these fronts head further east, they sometimes lose their strength as they travel over more warm air.  For this reason, tornadoes are not as common on the [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] as they are in the Midwest. However, they have happened on rare occasion, such as the F3 twister that struck [[Limerick Township, Montgomery County, Pennsylvania|Limerick Township, Pennsylvania]] near Philadelphia on 27 July 1994,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://media.pottsmerc.com/2014/07/30/1994-limerick-tornado/#1}}&lt;/ref&gt; the F2 twister that struck the northern suburbs of New York City on 12 July 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/14/nyregion/14storm.html?ex=1153022400&amp;en=6f91606b06e86635&amp;ei=5087%0A | work=The New York Times | first=Anahad | last=O'Connor | title=It's Official: That Severe Storm in Westchester Was a Tornado | date=14 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; the EF2 twister in the borough of [[Brooklyn, New York|Brooklyn]] on 8 August 2007, or the F4 twister that [[La Plata, Maryland#Tornado history|struck La Plata, Maryland]] on 28 April 2002.

Tornadoes can occur west of the [[continental divide]], but they are infrequent and usually relatively weak and short-lived.  Recently, tornadoes have struck the Pacific coast town of [[Lincoln City, Oregon|Lincoln City]], Oregon (1996), [[Sunnyvale, California|Sunnyvale]], California (1998), and downtown [[Salt Lake City]], Utah (1999 - see [[Salt Lake City Tornado]]). The [[California Central Valley]] is an area of some frequency for tornadoes, albeit of weak intensity. Though tornadoes that occur on the Western Seaboard are typically weak, more powerful and damaging tornadoes, such as the tornado that occurred on 22 May 2008 in Perris, California, can also occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/may/23/local/me-weather23 | work=The Los Angeles Times | first=David| last=Reyes | title=Tornadoes, hail and snow deliver a May surprise| date=23 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More tornadoes occur in [[Texas]] than in any other US state. The state which has the highest number of tornadoes per unit area is Florida, although most of the tornadoes in Florida are weak tornadoes of '''EF0''' or '''EF1''' intensity. A number of Florida's tornadoes occur along the edge of [[hurricane]]s that strike the state. The state with the highest number of strong tornadoes per unit area is [[Oklahoma]]. The neighboring state of [[Kansas]] is also a particularly notorious tornado state. It records the most EF4 and EF5 tornadoes in the country.

== Tornadoes in Canada ==
{{Refimprove section|date=June 2011}}
Canada also experiences numerous tornadoes, although fewer than the United States. On average 62 are reported per year, but this number is expected to be higher due to undetected tornadoes in large expanses of underpopulated areas.&lt;ref name="Canada62"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vettese|first1=Dayna|title=Tornadoes in Canada: Everything you need to know|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/tornadoes-in-canada-everything-you-need-to-know/25876/|website=The Weather Network|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|NOAA]] has a higher average 100 per year in Canada.&lt;ref name="Canada100"&gt;{{cite web|title=U.S. Tornado Climatology|url=https://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/climate-information/extreme-events/us-tornado-climatology/trends|website=NOAA|accessdate=26 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes tens of millions of [[Canadian dollar|dollars]] in damage.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}} Most are weak F0 or F1 in intensity, but there are on average a few F2 or stronger that touch down each season.

For example, the tornado frequency of [[Southwestern Ontario]] is about half that of the most tornado-prone areas of the central US plains. The last multiple tornado-related deaths in Canada were caused by a tornado in [[Ear Falls, Ontario]] on 9 July 2009, where 3 died, and the last killer tornado was on 3 August 2018 in [[Alonsa, Manitoba]].&lt;ref name="CanadaDeadly"&gt;{{cite web|author=&lt;!--Not stated--&gt;|title=Manitoba tornado: First Canadian tornado death in 7 years|url=https://www.theweathernetwork.com/news/articles/fatality-reported-manitoba-tornado-alonsa/107872|website=The Weather Network|accessdate=6 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two deadliest tornadoes on Canadian soil were the [[Regina Cyclone]] of 30 June 1912 (28 fatalities) and the [[Edmonton Tornado]] of 31 July 1987 (27 fatalities). Both of these storms were rated an F4 on the Fujita scale. The city of [[Windsor, Ontario|Windsor]] was struck by strong tornadoes four times within a 61-year span (1946, 1953, 1974, 1997) ranging in strength from an F2 to F4. Windsor has been struck by more significant tornadoes than any other city in Canada.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Canada's first official F5 tornado struck [[Elie, Manitoba]] on [[Elie, Manitoba Tornado|22 June 2007]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=714D9AAE-1&amp;news=4B3DE57E-4967-4B09-98D6-EF974B32D6B5 Environment Canada News Release: Elie Tornado Upgraded to Highest Level on Damage Scale] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110611150927/http://www.ec.gc.ca/default.asp?lang=En&amp;n=714D9AAE-1&amp;news=4B3DE57E-4967-4B09-98D6-EF974B32D6B5 |date=11 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tornadoes are most frequent in the provinces of [[Alberta]], Saskatchewan, [[Manitoba]], and [[Ontario]].

==Europe==
Europe has about 300 tornadoes per year&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://geography.about.com/b/2003/07/13/tornadoes-in-europe.htm|title=Tornado|newspaper=About.com Education|access-date=2016-10-13|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140412221012/http://geography.about.com/b/2003/07/13/tornadoes-in-europe.htm|archivedate=12 April 2014|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; – much more than estimated by [[Alfred Wegener]] in his classic book ''Wind- und Wasserhosen in Europa'' ("Tornadoes and Waterspouts in Europe"). They are most common in June–August, especially in the inlands – rarest in January–March. Strong and violent tornadoes (F3–F5) do occur, especially in some of the interior areas and in the south – but are not as common as in parts of the US. As in the US, tornadoes are far from evenly distributed. Europe has some small "tornado alleys" – probably because of [[weather front|frontal]] collisions as in the south and east of England,&lt;ref&gt;Paul Rincon: UK, Holland top twister league. By Paul Rincon, BBC Science&lt;/ref&gt; but also because Europe is partitioned by mountain ranges like the Alps. Parts of [[Styria]] (Steiermark) in Austria may be such a tornado alley, and this county has had at least three F3 tornadoes since 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tordach.org/at/Tornado_climatology_of_Austria.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-09-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121001233744/http://www.tordach.org/at/Tornado_climatology_of_Austria.html |archivedate=1 October 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; F3 and perhaps one F4 tornado have occurred as far north as Finland.

Since 1900, deadly tornadoes have occurred in Austria, Belgium, Cyprus, Finland, France, Germany, Italy (such as the F5/T10 of Udine-Treviso on 24 July 1930, which killed 23 people,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tornadoit.org/tornadostorici.htm|title=I tornado in Italia  -  I tornado storici in Italia|website=www.tornadoit.org|access-date=2016-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;), Malta, Poland, Ukraine, Portugal (such as the F3/T7 of [[Castelo Branco, Portugal|Castelo Branco]] on 6 November 1954, which killed 5 and injured 220), Romania, Russia and the United Kingdom. The [[1984 Soviet Union tornado outbreak|1984 Ivanovo–Yaroslavl outbreak]], with more than 400 fatalities and 213 injured, was the century's deadliest tornado or outbreak in Europe. It included at least one F5 and one F4. Europe's perhaps deadliest tornado ever (and probably one of the World's deadliest tornadoes) hit Malta in 1551 (or 1556) and killed about 600.

One notable tornado of recent years was the [[Birmingham Tornado (UK)]] which struck [[Birmingham, United Kingdom]], in July 2005. A row of houses was destroyed, but no one was killed. A strong F3 (T7) Tornado hit the small town [[Micheln]] in Saxony-Anhalt, Germany on 23 July 2004 leaving 6 people injured and more than 250 buildings massively damaged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.naturgewalten.de/micheln.htm| title = 2004 tornado in Micheln (in German) | accessdate = 2010-09-01| author =  Sävert, Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==
Bangladesh and the eastern parts of India are very exposed to destructive tornadoes causing higher deaths and injuries. Bangladesh, Philippines, and Japan have the highest number of reported tornadoes in Asia.

The world's single deadliest tornado struck the [[Manikganj District]] of Bangladesh on April 26, 1989, killing an estimated 1,300 people, injuring 12,000, and leaving approximately 80,000 people homeless.&lt;ref name="Bangladesh tornadoes"&gt;{{citeweb|title=The Deadliest Tornado in the World|url=https://weather.com/storms/tornado/news/deadliest-tornado-world-bangladesh-20140416|publisher=The Weather Channel|author=Chris Dolce|date=17 April 2014|accessdate=19 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five other recorded tornadic events have killed more than 500 people in Bangladesh, the most recent on May 13, 1996 when multiple tornadoes swept through the [[Jamalpur District|Jamalpur]] and [[Tangail District|Tangail]] districts, killing more than 600.&lt;ref name="Bangladesh tornadoes" /&gt;

China occasionally experiences destructive tornadoes. In June 2016, a storm producing multiple tornadoes and hail struck a densely populated area of farms and factories near the city of Yancheng in Jiangsu province, about 800 kilometers (500 miles) south of Beijing, China, killing at least 78 people and destroying buildings. Nearly 500 people were injured, 200 of them critically, the official Xinhua News Agency reported.{{cn|date=December 2017}} Throughout China, an estimate 100 tornadoes may occur per with a few exceeding F4 in intensity, with activity most prevalent in eastern regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last = Chen |first = Jiaya |author2 = et al |title = Tornado Climatology of China |journal = Int.

==South America==
South America has its own [[:es:Pasillo de los Tornados|tornado alley]], composed of central and northern Argentina, southern and southeast Brazil, Uruguay, and part of Paraguay, and is considered the second highest frequency tornado region in the world.{{cn|date=November 2016}} Argentina has areas with high tornadic activity, and the strongest tornadoes in the southern hemisphere{{cn|date=November 2016}} like the [[San Justo tornado|F5 in San Justo]], and the [[:es:Oleada de tornados de Buenos Aires de 1993|tornado outbreak]] in Buenos Aires with more than 300 tornadoes registered in less than 24 hours.

This region is favorable for tornadoes and severe thunderstorms, due to the large size of the Pampas Plain where the cold air from Patagonia and Antarctica collides with warm, moist air from areas of Brazil, northern Argentina and Paraguay, and dry air from the Andes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/vision/earth/lookingatearth/intense_storms.html|title=NASA Satellite Identifies the World's Most Intense Thunderstorms|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;


=== South American Tornadoes ===
{{Unreferenced section|date=April 2014}}
On 16 September 1816, one of the first tornadoes recorded in South America destroyed the town of [[Rojas, Buenos Aires|Rojas]] ({{convert|240|km|mi}} west of Buenos Aires)&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:1816]]&lt;/ref&gt;
An EF4 tornado struck the city of [[Encarnación, Paraguay|Encarnación]], Paraguay, on 20 September 1926 and killed over 300 people, making it the second deadliest tornado in South America.
On 21 April 1970, an F4 struck [[Fray Marcos]] in Uruguay and killed 11, making it the strongest in Uruguay's history.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slideshare.net/escuelarural207/tornados-en-uruguay&lt;/ref&gt;
On 10 January 1973, an F5 struck the city of San Justo, Argentina, {{convert|105|km|mi|abbr=on}} north of the city of [[Santa Fe, Argentina|Santa Fe]]. The [[San Justo tornado]] is considered the worst tornado ever to occur in the Southern Hemisphere, with winds that exceeded {{convert|400|kph|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;[[San Justo tornado]]&lt;/ref&gt;
On 6 May 1992, [[:es:López (Buenos Aires)|Estación López]] {{es}}, in Buenos Aires Province, was devastated by an EF4 tornado that caused 4 deaths among the 150 residents.
The province of [[Buenos Aires]] (Argentina) was impacted by the largest tornado outbreak in South American history on 13 April 1993. More than 300 tornadoes were recorded over 24 hours with intensities ranging from F1 to F3.
On 28 October 1978, an EF4 tornado with winds of {{convert|270|kph|mph|abbr=on}} hit the city of [[Morteros]] in the province of [[Córdoba, Argentina|Córdoba]], killing 5 people.
The 26 December [[:es:Tornado de Córdoba de 2003|2003 Córdoba Tornado]] {{es}} struck {{convert|6|km|mi|abbr=on}} west of Córdoba's city center. It was rated an F3 with winds exceeding {{convert|300|kph|mph|abbr=on}}, killing 5 and injuring hundreds.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Tornado de Córdoba]]&lt;/ref&gt;
An EF4 tornado destroyed the town of [[San Pedro, Misiones|San Pedro]], [[Misiones Province|Misiones]], on the night of 7 September 2009, killing 11 people. The same tornado hit the nearby town of [[Guaraciaba, Santa Catarina|Guaraciaba]], [[Brazil]], killing 6. The neighboring towns of Veloso Santo and Santa Cecilia were seriously damaged and were declared in a state of emergency.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tandar.cnea.gov.ar/eventos/seminariosGIyA/2012/diapositivas/20120605-Diferentes_formas_de_las_trazas_de_danios_en_tornados-Agosta+Altinger.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Africa==
Tornadoes do occur in South Africa. In October 2011 (i.e. in the spring), two people were killed and nearly 200 were injured after a tornado formed, near [[Ficksburg]] in the [[Free State (province)|Free State]]; more than 1,000 shacks and houses were flattened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/world_now/2011/10/south-africa-tornadoes-tear-through-townships-killing-two-and-leaving-hundreds-homeless.html | work=Los Angeles Times | title=SOUTH AFRICA: Tornadoes kill two, leave thousands homeless | date=3 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also the seasonal incidence of tornadoes in the coast of [[West Africa|western Africa]]. These occur during the onset of rainy season when tumultuous winds accompanied by sheets of rain as well as spectacular thunder and lightning batter the coast.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Eurafricans in Western Africa: Commerce, Social Status, Gender, and Religious Observance from the Sixteenth to the Eighteenth Century|last=Brooks|first=George|publisher=Ohio University Press|year=2003|isbn=0852554893|location=Athens, OH|pages=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tornadoes, however, were welcomed by settlers in the region since it dissipates extreme heat and [[humidity]] during the last days of the dry season. These tornadoes are often embedded in the African [[Squall line|squall lines]] and produced by the severe thunderstorms that they bring.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Environmental Structure And Function: Climate System - Volume I|last=Gruza|first=George|publisher=EOLSS Publishers/UNESCO|year=2009|isbn=9781848267381|location=Oxford|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are experts that attribute the formation of the tornado to the large hail, supported by wind shears in the northern part of the squall lines that veer and increase in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=An Introduction to the Meteorology and Climate of the Tropics|last=Galvin|first=J.F.P.|publisher=Wiley Blackwell|year=2016|isbn=9781119086222|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; These tornadoes damage crops, diminishing the positive impact of its rains.

==Oceania==
Australia has about 16 tornadoes per year – excluding waterspouts, which are common.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/science/articles/2010/06/04/2918660.htm&lt;/ref&gt; In New Zealand, a tornado hit the northern suburbs of [[Auckland]] on 3 May 2011, killing one and injuring at least 16 people.

== Frequency of occurrence ==
Tornadoes can form in any month, providing the conditions are favorable. For example, a freak tornado hit South St. Louis County Missouri on 31 December 2010, causing pockets of heavy damage to a modest area before dissipating. The temperature was unseasonably warm that day. They are least common during the winter and most common in spring. Since autumn and spring are transitional periods (warm to cool and vice versa) there are more chances of cooler air meeting with warmer air, resulting in thunderstorms. Tornadoes in the late summer and fall can also be caused by hurricane landfall.

Not every [[thunderstorm]], [[supercell]], [[squall|squall line]], or [[tropical cyclone]] will produce a tornado. Precisely the right atmospheric conditions are required for the formation of even a weak tornado. On the other hand, 700 or more tornadoes a year are reported in the contiguous United States.

On average, the United States experiences 100,000 thunderstorms each year, resulting in more than 1,200 tornadoes and approximately 50 deaths per year.  The deadliest U.S. tornado recorded is the 18 March 1925, [[Tri-State Tornado]] that swept across southeastern [[Missouri]], southern [[Illinois]] and southern [[Indiana]], killing 695 people. The biggest [[tornado outbreak]] on record—with 353 tornadoes over the course of just 3 1/2 days, including four F5 and eleven F4 tornadoes—occurred starting on 25 April 2011 and intensifying on 26 April and especially the record-breaking day of 27 April before ending on 28 April. It is referred to as the [[2011 Super Outbreak]]. Previously, the record was 148 tornadoes, dubbed the [[1974 Super Outbreak]]. Another such significant storm system was the [[Palm Sunday tornado outbreak of 1965]], which affected the United States Midwest on 11 April 1965. A series of continuous tornado outbreaks is known as a [[tornado outbreak sequence]], with significant occurrences in May 1917, 1930, 1949, and 2003.

== Time of occurrence ==

=== Diurnality ===
Tornado occurrence is highly dependent on the time of day.

[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-218362/tornado Tornadoes.] Retrieved on 2006-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; peak hour of occurrence is 5&amp;nbsp;pm, with roughly half of all tornado occurrence between 3 p.m. and 7 p.m. local time,&lt;ref&gt;A. M. Holzer.

Bluestein]] of the [[University of Oklahoma]], have referred to this phenomenon as "five o'clock magic." Despite this, there are several morning tornadoes reported, like the [[Seymour, Texas|Seymour]], Texas one in April 1980.

=== Seasonality ===
The time of year is a big factor of the intensity and frequency of tornadoes. On average, in the United States as a whole, the month with the most tornadoes is May, followed by the months June, April, and July. There is no "tornado season" though, as tornadoes, including violent tornadoes and major outbreaks, can and do occur anywhere at any time of year if favorable conditions develop. Major tornado outbreaks have occurred in every month of the year.

July is the peak month in Austria, Finland, and Germany.&lt;ref&gt;Jenni Teittinen. [http://ams.confex.com/ams/pdfpapers/115319.pdf A Climatology of Tornadoes in Finland.] Retrieved on 2006-10-25.&lt;/ref&gt; On average, there are around 294 tornadoes throughout the United States during the month of May, and as many as 543 tornadoes have been reported in the month of May alone (in 2003). The months with the fewest tornadoes are usually December and January, although major tornado outbreaks can and sometimes do occur even in those months. In general, in the Midwestern and Plains states, springtime (especially the month of May) is the most active season for tornadoes, while in the far northern states (like [[Minnesota]] and [[Wisconsin]]), the peak tornado season is usually in the summer months (June and July). In the colder late autumn and winter months (from early December to late February), tornado activity is generally limited to the southern states, where it is possible for warm Gulf of Mexico air to penetrate.

The reason for the peak period for tornado formation being in the spring has much to do with temperature patterns in the U.S. Tornadoes often form when cool, polar air traveling southeastward from the Rockies overrides warm, moist, unstable [[Gulf of Mexico]] air in the eastern states. Tornadoes therefore tend to be commonly found in front of a cold front, along with heavy rains, hail, and damaging winds.  Since both warm and cold weather are common during the springtime, the conflict between these two air masses tends to be most common in the spring. As the weather warms across the country, the occurrence of tornadoes spreads northward. Tornadoes are also common in the summer and early fall because they can also be triggered by hurricanes, although the tornadoes caused by hurricanes are often much weaker and harder to spot. Winter is the least common time for tornadoes to occur, since hurricane activity is virtually non-existent at this time, and it is more difficult for warm, moist maritime tropical air to take over the frigid Arctic air from Canada, occurrences are found mostly in the Gulf states and Florida during winter (although there have been some notable exceptions). There is a second active tornado season of the year, late October to mid-November. Autumn, like spring, is a time of the year when warm weather alternates with cold weather frequently, especially in the Midwest, but the season is not as active as it is during the springtime and tornado frequencies are higher along the Atlantic Coastal plain as opposed to the Midwest. They usually appear in late summer.

The reliable climatology of tornadoes is limited in geographic and temporal scope; only since 1976 in the United States and 2000 in Europe have thorough and accurate tornado statistics been logged.&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, pg. 194&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.essl.org/projects/ESWD/| title = ESSL [ESWD Project and Data Use&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;| accessdate = 2009-02-15| publisher = [[European Severe Storms Laboratory]]| deadurl = yes| archiveurl = https://archive.is/20120731183716/http://www.essl.org/projects/ESWD/| archivedate = 31 July 2012| df = dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, some trends can be noted in tornadoes causing significant damage in the United States, as somewhat reliable statistics on damaging tornadoes exist as far back as 1880. The highest incidence of violent tornadoes seems to shift from the Southeastern United States to the southern [[Great Plains]] every few decades. Also, the 1980s seemed to be a period of unusually low tornado activity in the United States, and the number of multi-death tornadoes decreased every decade from the 1920s to the 1980s, suggesting a multi-decadal pattern of some sort.&lt;ref&gt;Grazulis, 196–198&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''triple beam balance''' is an instrument used to measure [[mass]] very precisely.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://genchem.rutgers.edu/balance3b.html|title=TRIPLE Beam Balance|website=genchem.rutgers.edu|access-date=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The device has reading error of +/- 0.05 gram. The name refers to the three beams including the middle beam which is the largest size, the front beam which is the medium size, and the far beam which is the smallest size. The difference in size of the beams indicate the difference in weights and reading scale that each beam carry. The reading scale can be enumerated that the middle beam reads in 100 gram increments, the front beam can read from 0 to 10 grams, and the far beam can read in 10 gram increments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=MisterHager|title=how to use a triple beam balance|date=2011-09-14|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4Q5G_HVZ8XI|accessdate=2016-03-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The triple beam balance can be used to measure mass directly from the objects, find mass by difference for [[liquid]], and measure out a substance.

The ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[Setting (fiction)|fictional universe]] contains a variety of [[weapon]]s, ranging from missiles (the classic photon torpedo) to melee (primarily used by the [[Klingon]]s, a race of [[Extraterrestrial life in fiction|aliens]] in the ''Star Trek'' universe). The ''Star Trek'' franchise consists primarily of several multi-season television shows and a dozen movies, as well as various video games and inspired merchandise. Many aspects of the fictional universe impact modern popular culture, especially the lingo and the idea of a spacecraft launching space torpedoes and firing lasers, and have had a wide influence in the late 20th to early 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.space.com/33081-star-trek-50th-anniversary-exhibit-seattle-museum.html]&lt;/ref&gt; ''Star Trek'' is popular enough that its science fiction concepts have even been studied by real scientists, and NASA described its science in relation to the real world as "entertaining combination of real science, imaginary science gathered from lots of earlier stories, and stuff the writers make up week-by-week to give each new episode novelty."&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"&gt;[https://www.nasa.gov/topics/technology/features/star_trek.html]&lt;/ref&gt; For example, NASA noted that the ''Star Trek'' "phasers" were a fictional extrapolation of real-life lasers, and compared them to real-life microwave based weapons that have a stunning effect.&lt;ref name="nasa.gov"/&gt;

{{TOC limit|2}}

==Energy weapons==
The franchise depicts various weapons which fit the motif of the [[raygun]], the most prominent of these being the "phaser". These directed-energy weapons emit energy in an aimed direction without the means of a projectile. The intended effects may be non-lethal or lethal. For example, in ''Star Trek'', a hand phaser can be set to "stun" or "kill".

Phasers are common and versatile [[phased array]] [[pulsed energy projectile]] weapons, first seen in the original ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|Star Trek]]'' series and later seen or referenced in almost all subsequent films and television spin-offs. Phasers come in a wide range of sizes, ranging from [[small arms]] to [[starship]]-mounted weaponry. There are several specific types of phasers used by the United Federation of Planets' Starfleet.

Though they seem to discharge in a continuous "beam", close observation reveals that phasers actually discharge a stream of pulsed energy projectiles into the target.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170201203146/http://24.media.tumblr.com/dae67b641a97a28008c9984b27f3a200/tumblr_mn6tziLHh11rhg5lso1_500.gif Animated GIF showing a phaser discharge in slow motion]&lt;/ref&gt; Phaser output can be adjusted in both area of effect and output: a typical hand phaser can be adjusted so that it will merely shock or stun a living organism, while the effects of higher settings range from burning, and disintegration to true vaporization. This versatility means they can also be used as welding torches or cutting tools, and can create heat sources by firing at a large, solid object (like a rock). The stream can be adjusted to strike multiple targets at once, strike a single target with precision, or even destroy large amounts of material. Phasers can be set to overload, whereby they build up a force-chamber explosion by continuously generating energy without releasing it; the resulting blast can destroy most natural objects within a 50-meter radius. The overload process is marked by a distinctive sound that increases in volume and frequency until it is deactivated or it detonates.&lt;ref name="The Conscience of the King"&gt;"[[The Conscience of the King]]". [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]&lt;/ref&gt; Personal phasers can be made small enough to fit in the user's palm and still be lethal.&lt;ref name="The City on the Edge of Forever"&gt;"[[The City on the Edge of Forever]]". [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]&lt;/ref&gt; Larger and more powerful phaser rifles are commonly issued to security personnel.

Ship-mounted phasers have a similar range of functions on a larger scale: The phasers on the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701)|USS ''Enterprise'']] could be used as an 'anti-missile' defense to destroy incoming projectiles,&lt;ref name="For The World is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky"&gt;"[[For the World Is Hollow and I Have Touched the Sky]]". [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Cathexis"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Cathexis (Star Trek: Voyager)| title=Cathexis| series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; stun entire city blocks full of people,&lt;ref name="A Piece of the Action"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=A Piece of the Action (Star Trek: The Original Series)| title=A Piece of the Action| series=[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; destroy cities,&lt;ref name="Mirror, Mirror"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Mirror, Mirror (Star Trek: The Original Series)| title=Mirror, Mirror| series=[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and even destroy entire asteroids up to a given size. The ship's phaser system was also said to be capable of destroying continents.&lt;ref name="The Cage"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)| title=The Cage| series=[[Star Trek: The Original Series]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="A Taste of Armageddon"&gt;"[[A Taste of Armageddon]]". [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]&lt;/ref&gt; Starship phasers can be freely used while the ship is travelling at Warp speeds.&lt;ref name="Arena"&gt;"[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)]]". [[Star Trek: The Original Series]]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Retroactive continuity#Alteration|later series]], phasers release a beam of fictional subatomic particles called "rapid nadion", which are then refracted ("rectified") through superconducting crystals. The ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Technical Manual]]'' indicates that the superconducting crystals used in phasers are called ''fushigi no umi'', which is Japanese for "sea of mystery", and the phrase is written ふしぎの海 in the original glyphs. This was a homage to the 1990 anime series ''Fushigi no Umi no Nadia'', known in North America as ''[[Nadia: The Secret of Blue Water]]''.

The phasers that appeared in the 2009 [[reboot (fiction)|reboot]] ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' appear similar in shape to the classic phasers, but fire singular energy projectiles instead of a sustained stream of them, in a fashion similar to [[Semi-automatic firearm|semi-automatic weapons]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20170201204208/https://media.giphy.com/media/RjUrL7BeRhpo4/giphy.gif Animated GIF showing a reboot phaser discharge in slow motion]&lt;/ref&gt; This version of the phaser seems to only have two settings, stun and kill, which fire blue and red colored projectiles respectively. The barrel of the weapon is two-sided, one being colored red and the other blue to indicate the current setting: the user must manually rotate to the other output to use the other setting. A similar change was seen in the starship-mounted phaser banks, which also fire single projectiles instead of continuous streams. In ''[[Star Trek Beyond]]'', the barrel sides of the sidearm phasers are flat and both barrels shoot blue bolts that deal no physical damage, while the barrel tips are still colored blue and red.

The original phaser rifle prop from "[[Where No Man Has Gone Before]]" sold at auction for $231,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57578550-1/star-trek-phaser-rifle-sells-for-$231k/| title='Star Trek' phaser rifle sells for $231k| first=Christopher| last=MacManus| accessdate=April 9, 2013| date=April 8, 2013| work=[[CNET]]| publisher=[[CBS Interactive]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laser===
Lasers are a sidearm in the original ''Star Trek'' pilot "[[The Cage (Star Trek: The Original Series)|The Cage]]", and laser pistols appear in several ''Original Series'' episodes, although later episodes in ''The Next Generation'' seemed to indicate that the laser's use as a weapon was outdated. In one instance, the ship-mounted lasers of two spacecraft were incapable of overcoming even the navigational shields of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-D)|USS ''Enterprise''-D]],&lt;ref name="The Outrageous Okona"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Outrageous Okona (Star Trek: The Next Generation)| title=The Outrageous Okona| series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; though on at least two other occasions it was threatened with destruction by laser-armed spacecraft.&lt;ref name="Loud as a Whisper"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Loud as a Whisper| title=Loud as a Whisper| series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Suddenly Human"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Suddenly Human (Star Trek: The Next Generation)| title=Suddenly Human| series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] cutter weapon is a laser, as mentioned in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[Q Who]]" and is capable of quickly disintegrating the hull of a Federation starship, as seen in the pilot episode of [[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]], [[Emissary (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Emissary]]. At lower power levels, it is capable of making 'surgical' incisions into a ship's hull.

According to ''The Making of Star Trek'', [[Gene Roddenberry]] claimed that production staff realized that using laser technology would cause problems in the future as people came to understand what lasers could and could not do; this resulted in the move to phasers on-screen, while letting lasers be known as a more primitive weapon style.

===Pulse cannon===
The So'jan military command and the Romulan defector Commander Telek L'mar developed a weapon that created highly charged disruptor-style beam, which they called a pulse cannon. They later became obsolete. When the laser had reached its upper limits of power, a new weapon was invented at Jupiter Station for the newly designed NX-class. This new weapon could fire much greater energies at longer range but the drawback was that continuous fire would cause damage to the emitter. To solve this problem, Starfleet scientists devised a way to fire the weapon in short pulsed burst streams to help regulate the temperatures of the emitters in a state of constant fire. The pulse cannon is a rather simple particle beam weapon and Starfleet Command ultimately decided on using the more powerful plasma cannon on the NX-class ''Enterprise''. The pulse cannon was nevertheless considered an effective energy weapon at the time and was adopted by many private craft such as freighters and privateers due to its lower cost of implementation.

===Plasma cannon===
Plasma cannons are a form of directed energy weaponry used by both Earth Starfleet and the early Romulan Star Empire. On Starfleet vessels, they were the precursors to phase cannons. Plasma cannons fired a plasma discharge in the form of a beam or a burst similar to the plasma bullets fired by hand-held plasma weapons, but much bigger in size. The NX-class was initially armed with plasma cannons.

===Phase cannon===
Phase cannons are 22nd century weapons, several of which first appear mounted to the ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]'' in the ''Star Trek: Enterprise'' episode "[[Silent Enemy (Star Trek: Enterprise)|Silent Enemy]]". Phase cannons have a variable yield, with the cannons on the ''Enterprise'' being rated for a maximum output of 500 gigajoules, about 120 tons TNT equivalent.&lt;ref name="Silent Enemy"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Silent Enemy (Star Trek: Enterprise)| title=Silent Enemy| series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unitconversion.org/energy/gigajoules-to-kilotons-conversion.html&lt;/ref&gt; Phase cannons are generally more powerful than [[#Spatial torpedoes|spatial torpedoes]].&lt;ref name="Fallen Hero"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Fallen Hero| title=Fallen Hero| series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are the 22nd century precursor to phaser technology. Phase pistols are hand-carried Phase cannons, and are also the 22nd century precursor to phaser technology. However, unlike 24th century phasers, they do not have the normal variable power settings or a variable beam width—only stun and kill.

===Disruptor===
[[File:Klingon Disruptor.svg|thumb|A klingon Disruptor]]

Disruptors are employed by several alien species in this series, including [[Romulan]]s, [[Klingon]]s, [[Breen (Star Trek)|Breen]], [[Cardassian]]s, Iridians and Orions in their personal and military small arms as well as being mounted as cannon, emitters, turrets, and banks. Only the first three species are known to have type-3 disruptors, the most advanced type developed so far, by the 24th Century. Disruptors cause damage by exciting the molecular bonds of targets to such great extents that those bonds are weakened, and/or broken, by the energies emitted, which often manifest as explosive force. According to Last Unicorn's ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation Role-playing Game]]'', disruptors are considered less "elegant" than phaser-based weapons; their effects there are described as thermal shock and blunt force, as opposed to the "rapid nadion effect". As a result, disruptors inflict more damage to matter, but less damage to shields, than phasers.

===Phased polaron cannon===
Phased polaron cannons are the primary armament of the [[Dominion (Star Trek)|Dominion]], the main antagonist faction in the later seasons of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]''. The cannon emits a beam of polaron particles, the fictional in-universe antimatter counterpart of the [[muon]] (not to be confused with the actual [[polaron]] or the actual [[antimuon]]). When first introduced, Dominion polaron cannons easily penetrate the shielding systems of most Alpha Quadrant races. The Alpha Quadrant races eventually learn to modify their shields to resist polaron weaponry, evoking surprise from the Vorta advisor Weyoun ("[[Call to Arms (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Call to Arms]]").

===Tetryon cannon===
Tetryon cannons are the primary armament of the Hirogen and are similar in application to phasers and disruptors. Tetryon cannons are unique in that they are designed primarily to damage energy and force fields such as starship shields. Tetryon cannons do damage matter but not to the same extent as phasers or disruptors. This is in line with the Hirogen philosophy of the hunt. The Hirogen ship would therefore knock out its opponent's shields and beam over hunters to engage in face-to-face ranged or melee combat. This allows the Hirogen hunters to collect items that they would consider to be hunting trophies.

===Varon-T disruptor===
Varon-T disruptors were featured in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[The Most Toys]]", and were mentioned to be a rare type of disruptor made illegal in the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] because of their slow, excruciating method of killing, with the weapons tearing the body apart from the inside. Kivas Fajo, a Zibalian trader in that episode, owned four of the five Varon-T disruptors ever manufactured (he slept with one under his pillow) and even used one on his own crew before his collection of rare items was confiscated after his capture and arrest for kidnapping and theft (among other crimes).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode| title = The Most Toys| episodelink  = The Most Toys| series = TNG| serieslink = Star Trek: The Next Generation| airdate  = May 5, 1990| season = 3| number = 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ferengi energy whip===
The [[Ferengi]] energy whip, as seen in the ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|TNG]]'' episode "[[The Last Outpost (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Last Outpost]]", looks and handles like a typical Earth [[bullwhip]] and discharges a powerful phaser-like energy pulse.

==Projectile weapons==

===Spatial torpedo===
Also referred to as conventional torpedoes, spatial torpedoes are 22nd century weapons used by ''[[Enterprise (NX-01)|Enterprise]]''. Spatial torpedoes are the ship's most powerful and primary ship-to-ship weapon before the installation of phase cannons.&lt;ref name="Silent Enemy" /&gt; Spatial torpedoes are themselves superseded by more powerful photonic torpedoes.&lt;ref name="The Expanse"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Expanse (Star Trek episode)| title=The Expanse| series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike photonic torpedoes or any of the warhead's successors, spatial torpedoes are launched at sub-light velocity and can be used much in the manner of a missile, having the warhead on a [[Aircraft flight control system#Fly-by-wire control systems|fly-by-wire]].&lt;ref name="Fight or Flight"&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=Fight or Flight (Star Trek: Enterprise)| title=Fight or Flight| series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Photon torpedo===
{{or-section|date=March 2018}}
[[File:Star Trek - Photon torpedoes.jpg|thumb|250px|An [[Akira class starship|''Akira''-class starship]] fires photon torpedoes.]]
Photon torpedoes are a standard ship-based weapon armed with an [[Antimatter weapon|antimatter warhead]]. They are present in every version of the ''Star Trek'' series and are a standard weapon on almost every Federation ship, though in ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'', the titular ship uses less powerful spatial torpedoes (guided, rocket propelled missiles) until receiving the more powerful "photonic" (as the characters describe them) variant, though this does not square with established canon because it took place before the "Romulan Wars" in which, to quote Spock in "[[Balance of Terror]]", "This conflict was fought by our standards today with primitive atomic weapons". Photon torpedoes first appear on a [[Starfleet]] ship in the original series' episode "[[Arena (Star Trek: The Original Series)|Arena]]" as part of the USS ''Enterprise''{{'}}s armament—in the ''Star Trek: Enterprise'' episode "[[The Expanse (Star Trek episode)|The Expanse]]", the [[Enterprise (NX-01)|''Enterprise'' (NX-01)]] first receives photonic torpedoes. Smaller Starfleet craft such as shuttlecraft and runabouts can be armed with "micro-torpedoes", a scaled-down version of photon torpedoes designed for use on craft too small to accommodate the full-sized weapon.

When fired, photon torpedoes usually appear as a spiky orb of energy of varying colours, such as red,&lt;ref name="StarTrekUC"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; orange,&lt;ref name="StarTrekFirstContact"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[Star Trek: First Contact]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; yellow, blue, or green,&lt;ref name="StarTrekTMP"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[Star Trek: The Motion Picture]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; or in the case of ''The Original Series'', red bolts (However ''Enterprise'' ignores this). According to the original notes to ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|TOS]]'' and ''The Making of Star Trek'', Photon torpedoes are energy shielded to allow armor-penetration. Several episodes seem to suggest this (reference: ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation|TNG]]'' "[[Suspicions (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Suspicions]]"). The energy output of a photon torpedo, according to the Technical Manuals is a maximum theoretical yield of 25 Isotons and a maximum rated yield of 18.5 Isotons. According to the TNG Technical Manual, photon torpedoes use 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg of matter and 1.5&amp;nbsp;kg of antimatter. However, these amounts would only produce an explosive yield of 64.4 megatons, so a secondary effect must occur to achieve the incredible yields seen on screen. In the ''[[Star Trek: The Original Series|TOS]]'' episode, "[[Balance of Terror]]", Photon Torpedoes apparently replaced nuclear warheads as the primary wartime weapons on Federation starships. The photon torpedo was seen to explode with great force.

Torpedoes are often depicted as being easy to modify to suit specific situations. Despite the stated maximum yield, torpedoes can apparently be made far more destructive with relatively little effort. In ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', Tuvok and Kim modify a normal photon torpedo with a gravimetric charge, a Borg technology, to increase its destructive yield to 54 isotons. Kim comments that 50 isotons would have been sufficient to destroy a small planet. Janeway later instructs them to increase its yield even further, to 80 isotons. It is not specified exactly how they modified the warhead, but they only required a few hours to complete the work using materials readily available on ''Voyager''. In ''[[Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country]]'', Spock and Dr. McCoy modify a photon torpedo to track the plasma emissions from a cloaked Klingon [[Klingon starships|bird of prey]] as it attacks the ''Enterprise''-A and the ''[[USS Excelsior (Star Trek)|Excelsior]]'', similar to the principal function of the [[Infrared homing|heat-seeking missile]].

Photon torpedo launchers aboard ships are shown to be versatile enough to fire probes, which in-universe are designed with this functionality in mind. In ''[[Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan]]'', a torpedo casing is used as a makeshift coffin for [[burial at sea|burial in space]] and as scientific probes as in the ''Next Generation'' episode "[[In Theory (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|In Theory]]" and ''[[Star Trek Generations]]''. Also in the ''Next Generation'' episode [[The Emissary (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Emissary]] a photon torpedo casing was used to convey Klingon ambassador [[K'Ehleyr]] to the USS ''Enterprise'' when no other long range transport was available.

===Plasma torpedo===
Plasma torpedoes are used by the Romulans, Cardassians, and (according to ''[[Star Fleet Battles]]'', ''[[Klingon Academy]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command|Starfleet Command]]'') the [[Gorn]]. The damage of a plasma torpedo spreads out over several ship systems at once, but the torpedo loses its effectiveness after only a few minutes of travel. Romulan plasma torpedoes use trilithium isotopes in their warheads.

===Gravimetric torpedoes===
Gravimetric torpedoes are torpedoes used by the Borg. The weapon emits a complex phase variance of gravitons to create a gravimetric distortion capable of tearing starships apart.

===Quantum torpedo===
Quantum torpedoes first appear in the ''Deep Space Nine'' episode "[[Defiant (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Defiant]]" as a weapon aboard the [[USS Defiant|USS ''Defiant'']]. Additionally, the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise''-E]] is equipped with quantum torpedoes in ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]''. The ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual]]'' states that quantum torpedoes derive their destructive power from [[zero-point energy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine Technical Manual]]|last=Zimmerman|first=Herman |author2=Rick Sternbach |author3=Doug Drexler}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''DS9'' episode "[[Paradise Lost (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Paradise Lost]]", the USS ''Lakota'' was also stated to be carrying quantum torpedoes, although they were never used.&lt;ref name="Paradise Lost"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Paradise Lost (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|title=Paradise Lost| series=[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Four of the USS ''Enterprise''-E's quantum torpedoes destroyed an unshielded [[Borg starships|Borg sphere]]. The launcher appears on the 1701-E in ''Star Trek: Insurrection'' but is never fired. In ''Star Trek: Nemesis'', nine of the ''Enterprise''-E's quantum torpedoes disabled ''Scimitar''{{'}}s cloaking function.

Quantum torpedoes are normally shown in a shade of blue. As of ''Nemesis'' the ''Enterprise'', the ''Lakota'', the ''Valiant'', the ''Defiant'', and the unmanned spacecraft ''[[Dreadnought (Star Trek: Voyager)|Dreadnought]]'' were the only ships known to be equipped with quantum torpedoes.

===Polaron torpedo===
Polaron torpedoes, like the Dominion weapon, are capable of penetrating normal shielding with ease. They appear in various ''Star Trek'' games. In ''[[Star Trek: Starfleet Command III|Starfleet Command III]]'', it is one of the Klingon's three heavy weapon options, the others being the photon torpedo and the [[ion cannon]]. It also appears in ''[[Star Trek: Armada]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Armada II]]'', as a researchable weapon for the Klingon Empire exclusive to the ''Vor'cha''-class cruiser which takes out one of the targeted ship's systems at random.

===Transphasic torpedo===
Transphasic torpedoes appear only once, in the ''Voyager'' series finale, "Endgame". They are high-yield torpedoes that are designed specifically to fight the Borg. The future Admiral Janeway brought them back in time in a Federation shuttlecraft and had them installed onboard ''Voyager'' in 2378. They are among the most powerful weapons used in the ''Star Trek'' universe; just one is capable of obliterating an entire Borg cube, a feat normally requiring an almost impossible amount of punishment using standard Federation weapons. They work by delivering destructive subspace compression pulse explosion. Upon detonation the pulse is delivered in asymmetric superposition of multiple phase states. Since the shields can block only one subcomponent of the pulse the remaining majority is delivered to the target. On the top of it every torpedo has different transphasic configuration generated randomly by a dissonant feedback effect to prevent Borg or any other enemy to predict the configuration of the phase states. Although they did not appear in the film ''Nemesis'', according to the non-canon ''Destiny'' book trilogy these were in fact kept by Starfleet as the weapon of last resort to be deployed to starships only when all else had failed against the Borg. They were the one and only thing Starfleet knew the Borg had not yet adapted to and for that reason wanted to keep this ace in the hole for as long as possible. Eventually, the situation became dire enough that the specifications were released to Federation and Klingon ships; the Borg eventually learned to adapt to them.

===Isokinetic Cannon===
The Isokinetic Cannon was seen in only one episode of ''Star Trek: Voyager'', "[[Retrospect (Star Trek: Voyager)|Retrospect]]". Representatives of ''Voyager'' met with a weapons trader and designer known as Kovin. The demonstration of the weapon destroyed a target buoy composed of 10&amp;nbsp;m thick solid monotanium with a chromoelectric forcefield in one shot, coring it cleanly through. However, Kovin was killed before the installation of the weapon. Though the weapon was never known to have been removed from ''Voyager'', it was never seen in use or referred to again. It is presumed that the diplomatic fallout that resulted from the circumstances surrounding Kovin's death led to the demo version being removed from ''Voyager'' and the deal to have it permanently installed being cancelled.

===TR-116 Projectile Rifle===
The TR-116 Projectile Rifle is a prototype weapon developed by the Federation for situations where conventional energy weapons might be rendered useless by damping fields or other countermeasures. It is essentially a conventional rifle, but with a rather futuristic visual style. It is introduced in the ''Star Trek: Deep Space Nine'' episode "[[Field of Fire (Star Trek: Deep Space Nine)|Field of Fire]]", where it is used in conjunction with a micro-transporter and a visual scanner headpiece to create an extremely potent sniper rifle. With the scanner, the shooter can precisely target people hundreds of meters away and through solid matter with no difficulty. Using the transporter attached to the barrel, the slug can then be transported at full velocity, materializing at point-blank range.

===Phased plasma torpedo===
Phased plasma torpedoes can phase out of normal space-time to bypass shields, then phase back in to detonate on a ship's hull, thus making shields worthless against them. They only appeared in the PC game ''[[Star Trek: Bridge Commander]]''. Shortly after the recovery of the Pegasus device, the phasing properties used in the design were seen as a delivery system for torpedoes. Since Borg ships are almost impossible to destroy by Starfleet's current technology, it made sense to their engineers to design a torpedo that could phase itself and enter the body of a Borg cube, causing devastating damage. However, reducing the size of the phasing coils used to accomplish an intangible state proved difficult. Further, the antimatter within the warhead had a destabilizing effect on the phasing coil. A new kind of explosive material was needed, and it was found using the principles behind the first observed Romulan plasma weapons. The installation of a high-energy plasma infuser would allow a torpedo casing to be filled with a warhead charged with high-energy plasma from the ship's warp nacelles. Warp plasma is highly unstable and can be easily detonated. Until recently, it was considered an undeliverable medium that could not be controlled. However, using a nanite-controlled trigger for reactant release now allows vessels to deliver a high-energy plasma warhead payload within a Mark IV torpedo casing.

===Chroniton torpedo===
Chroniton torpedoes are a unique form of weapon employed by the [[Krenim]]. The weapons phase in and out of normal time, allowing them to pass through ordinary shields and directly damage a vessel's hull.&lt;ref name="Year of Hell"&gt;{{cite episode|episodelink=Year of Hell| title=Year of Hell| series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though quite dangerous, their reliability is not absolute, as [[Seven of Nine]] and [[Tuvok]] (as well as [[Kes (Star Trek)|Kes]] in the alternate timeline presented in "[[Before and After (Star Trek: Voyager)|Before and After]]") find an undetonated chroniton torpedo lodged in ''[[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|Voyager]]''{{'}}s hull, which in turn allowed the crew to adapt the shields to withstand further attacks.&lt;ref name="Year of Hell" /&gt;

===Positron torpedo===
The Kessok are a highly intelligent race that allied themselves with the Cardassians, albeit through deceit, in the video game ''[[Star Trek: Bridge Commander]]''. They utilize positron torpedoes: powerful, slow-moving projectiles able to inflict nearly twice as much damage as quantum torpedoes.

==Biological, radioactive, and chemical weapons==

===Thalaron radiation===
Thalaron radiation was first used in the feature film ''[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]'' by the villain [[List of Star Trek characters (N–S)#S|Shinzon]] to assassinate the entire [[Romulan]] senate. Later in the movie, Shinzon attempts to kill the crew of the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|USS ''Enterprise''-E]] using a ship-mounted version. Thalaron radiation, even in small amounts, petrifies living tissue almost instantly. Its properties also allow its range and area of effect to be precisely controlled, from encompassing a single room to engulfing an entire planet. Its massive destructive potential leads the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] to consider it a biogenic weapon, and an extremely illegal one at that.&lt;ref name="StarTrekNemesis"&gt;{{cite episode|title=[[Star Trek: Nemesis]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It later features prominently in the plot of "Homecoming", the ''[[Star Trek: New Frontier]]'' short story in the 2008 [[Mirror Universe]] anthology ''Shards and Shadows'', in which the rebels manage to steal a Romulan thalaron bomb intended for use by the Alliance, to strike a balance of power against them.&lt;ref&gt;Peter David. "Homecoming" ''Star Trek Mirror Universe'' - ''Shards and Shadows'' 2009; [[Pocket Books]]; Pages 271–310.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Metreon cascade===
The metreon cascade was designed by Dr. Ma'Bor Jetrel of the Haakonian Order. Unstable metreon isotopes were used to create a devastating explosion, with radiation effects similar to those of the 20th-century atomic bomb. Those not killed or vaporized in the initial blast suffered terrible radiation poisoning and death in the aftermath. It was used only once, on the [[Talaxian]] [[natural satellite|moon]] Rinax in 2355.&lt;ref name="Jetrel"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Jetrel| title=Jetrel| series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Trilithium resin===
Trilithium resin is a byproduct of a starship's warp engines that is lethal to humans, but harmless to Cardassians. A team of terrorists attempted to steal Trilithium resin from the warp core of the ''Enterprise''-D when it was docked at Arkaria Station to receive a baryon sweep.&lt;ref name="Starship Mine"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Starship Mine| title=Starship Mine| series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Captain Benjamin Sisko would later use a Trilithium resin torpedo to render a Maquis planet uninhabitable to all human life for fifty years by detonating it in the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="For the Uniform"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=For the Uniform| title=For the Uniform| series=[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cobalt diselenide===
Cobalt diselenide is a biogenic weapon that affects the nervous system. It is composed of selenium and rhodium nitrates. It is the counterpart to trilithium resin, being lethal to Cardassians but harmless to most other humanoids.&lt;ref name="For the Uniform"/&gt;

===Aceton assimilators===
Aceton assimilators are used to absorb energy from other sources and then redirect it back as hazardous radiation.&lt;ref name="Booby Trap"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Booby Trap (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|title=Booby Trap|series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]|date=October 30, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Melee weapons==

===Federation===

====KaBar combat knife====
The KaBar combat knife is the Federation's standard-issue combat and survival knife. It is 32.5&amp;nbsp;cm (12.8&amp;nbsp;in) and is standard equipment in survival gear and in emergency weapons caches aboard starships. Captain Kathryn Janeway uses one in the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode "[[Macrocosm (Star Trek: Voyager)|Macrocosm]]".

In the real world, the [[KA-BAR]] is an official combat knife of the [[United States Marine Corps]].

====Katana====
A [[katana]] is a Federation sword of Japanese origin. The only major difference compared to the old sword of today is that the ''Star Trek'' version is foldable, thus occupying a minimum space when carried and stored. In the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' reboot, Lieutenant Hikaru Sulu produces a folding katana with which to cut the lines of his parachute, having stated just before this that his hand-to-hand combat expertise is in fencing.

===Jem'Hadar===

====Bayonet====
The [[Jem'Hadar]] often have [[bayonet]]s attached to their plasma (AKA polaron-pulse) rifles. They employ these in close combat, or to execute prisoners. Often Jem'Hadar bayonets are chemically-enhanced, releasing a lethal nerve-agent on contact.

====Kar'takin====
These straight-bladed polearms are used by the Jem'Hadar in close combat. They were used by both Starfleet officers and Jem'Hadar in the ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' episode "To the Death". The Kar'takin bear a resemblance to the [[Bardiche]] axe.

====Shock Blade====
This weapon delivers a taser-like jolt to whatever it strikes in combat. Holding the shock blade's trigger discharges a beam of neuro-electrical energy, with an effective range of 15 feet.&lt;ref&gt;http://gaming.trekcore.com/thefallen/images/manualweapon2.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

===Klingon===

====Bat'leth====
{{Main article|Bat'leth}}
[[File:Bat'leth.svg|thumb|A bat'leth]]
The bat'leth is the [[Klingon]] double-sided [[scimitar]]/[[hook sword]]/[[deer horn knives]] hybrid-edge weapon, designed by martial arts enthusiast and ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' effects producer [[Dan Curry]].&lt;ref name="Encyc"&gt;{{cite book|title=[[The Star Trek Encyclopedia]]|author=[[Michael Okuda|Okuda, Mike]] and Denise Okuda, with Debbie Mirek|publisher=Pocket Books|isbn=0-671-53609-5|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bat'leth is a curved blade with spiked protrusions and handholds along the middle of the blade's back. In battle, the handholds are used to twirl and spin the blade rapidly.

Klingon oral history holds that the first bat'leth was forged around 625 A.D. by [[Kahless]], who dropped a lock of his hair into the lava from the Kri'stak Volcano, then plunged the fiery lock into the lake of Lursor and twisted it to form a blade.&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt; After forging the weapon, he used it to defeat the tyrant Molor, and in doing so united the [[Klingon#Homeworld|Klingon homeworld]].&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt; This first bat'leth was known as the Sword of Kahless' and was stolen by the invading [[Hur'q]]; [[The Sword of Kahless|an episode of ''Deep Space Nine'']] revolves around an effort to recover the Sword of Kahless.&lt;ref name="Encyc" /&gt; The name bat'leth itself is a slight corruption of '''''batlh 'etlh''''', which means "Sword of Honor" in Klingon.

A replica bat'leth was among the blades surrendered to British police as part of the 2006 [[Knife legislation|knife amnesty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Lethal Star Trek blade seized in knives amnesty | publisher = The Daily Mail | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-387680/Lethal-Star-Trek-blade-seized-knives-amnesty.html | accessdate = July 31, 2008 | location=London | date=May 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A "Valdris" blade was used in Colorado Springs, Colorado, in two [[7-Eleven]] armed-robberies in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benzel |first1=Lance |title=Where no Klingon has gone before - 7-11 robberies |url=http://gazette.com/where-no-klingon-has-gone-before-7-11-robberies/article/47426 |work=The Colorado Springs Gazette |date=February 4, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150611172537/http://gazette.com/where-no-klingon-has-gone-before-7-11-robberies/article/47426 |archivedate=June 11, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====ChonnaQ (AKA Chon'naq)====
A smaller version of this "belly-spear" (the literal Klingon translation) is used in the children's game of ''qa'vak''...which incorporates spinning hoops, and hones assorted skills needed for hunting. Once a male Klingon reaches the Age of Ascension, he is presented with an adult version of the chon'naq by his father - on the occasion of their first hunt together as men.&lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.maquis.com/w/KTF/Weapons&lt;/ref&gt;

====D'k tahg (AKA Daqtagh)====
[[File:D´k tahg.svg|thumb|A d'k tahg]]
A d'k tahg is a Klingon [[dagger]]. The knife has three blades: a main blade with a cutout in the center, and two smaller blades on either side. In some models, these side blades are spring-loaded and can pop out into position and close up for storage. In other models, the blades are fixed. It also features a [[Hilt#Pommel|pommel]] studded with blunt spikes. The d'k tahg first appeared in ''[[Star Trek III: The Search for Spock]]'', and appeared occasionally throughout the following films and television series. The knife was designed by [[Gil Hibben]].&lt;ref name ="hartink"&gt;{{cite book | last = Hartink| first = A.E.| authorlink = |  title = Complete Encyclopedia of Knives| publisher =Chartwell Books| date = September 30, 2005| location = Lisse, The Netherlands| pages = 168–169| isbn =978-1-85409-168-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the  d'k tahg appeared in ''Star Trek III,'' it was not referred to by its name until ''Star Trek: The Next Generation.''

====Haf'leth====
This polearm is similar to a halberd. &lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.maquis.com/w/KTF/Weapons&lt;/ref&gt; 

===='Iw taj (AKA Iw'taj)====
Directly descended from the weapon which inspired the Klingon ''tIq'ghob'' emblem, this dagger (literal translation: "blood-knife") is longer and heavier than the d’k tahg (which was derived from it). Unlike the d’k tahg, which was conceived as a general-purpose combat-knife intended for mass production, the iw'taj is a dedicated dueling weapon.

The two side-blades, one pointing up and one pointing down, serve particular functions. The upward-pointing blade is designed to catch an opponent’s weapon and, with a twisting motion, disarm him. The downward-pointing blade is designed to inflict shallow cuts in passing, sapping the enemy’s strength; said design allows the weapon to advance smoothly, without this blade getting in the way. Duelists often hook their index and middle fingers over the crossbar; doing this allows the weapon to achieve impressive agility, despite weakening the grip...although it may also be used with a reverse grip.

The iw'taj is often carried by traditionalists, and by discerning martial artists. Usually, a warrior who carries both a mek’leth and an iw'taj is from a Qvav’mar background...and/or is a personal combatant of high caliber. &lt;ref&gt;https://startrekpilgrim.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/klingon-bladed-weapons/&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jejtaj (AKA Jej'taj)====
This throwing-dagger is more often used defensively, to ward off blade attacks. Typically, it is wielded as a combination knuckleduster/boomerang. &lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.maquis.com/w/KTF/Weapons&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mek'leth====
A mek'leth is the Klingon [[short sword]] that appears in several episodes of ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' and in the film ''[[Star Trek: First Contact]]''. Designed by [[Dan Curry]], it consists of a short, thick, curved blade with a metal guard extending back parallel with the grip to protect the hand. [[Worf]] is the most commonly seen user of the mek'leth, owning one and using it several times, including in [[hand-to-hand combat]] against [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] drones in ''First Contact''.

===='oy'naQ (AKA Oy'naq)====
This "pain-stick" (the literal translation), capable of killing a 2-ton Rectyne Monopod, is used as part of the Klingon Age of Ascension ritual. &lt;ref&gt;http://wiki.maquis.com/w/KTF/Weapons&lt;/ref&gt;

====Qutluch (AKA Kut'luch)====
Similar to the d'k tahg, the qutluch is "the ceremonial weapon of an assassin". A qutluch is designed to do considerable damage to internal organs, by Klingon standards thus making it an extremely lethal weapon. The qutluch is featured in the ''Star Trek: The Next Generation'' episode "[[Sins of the Father (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|Sins of the Father]]", when Worf's brother, Kurn, is stabbed; and in the ''Star Trek: Voyager'' episode "[[Real Life (Star Trek: Voyager)|Real Life]]", where the Doctor's simulated "son" prepares for the Qutluch ceremony. It is known in the real world as the "Phoenix" type knife.

====Tik'leth====
This “[[longsword]]” (the literal translation) is one of the more Terran-like Klingon weapons, by most standards. Like spears, tik'leths are traditional weapons of the rank-and-file...although many nobles prefer a tik'leth's offensive functionality to that of a bat'leth, while many soldiers carry mass-produced bat’leths as a status symbol. &lt;ref&gt;https://startrekpilgrim.wordpress.com/2013/06/24/klingon-bladed-weapons/&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romulan===

====Teral'n====
A [[Romulan]] [[polearm]], similar to a [[trident]] with retractable blades. It appears in the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' reboot and is used by the renegade miner Nero. In the ''[[Star Trek: Countdown|Countdown]]'' comic, Nero's weapon is revealed to be the "Debrune teral'n", an ancient Romulan artifact that symbolized the empire's power; it is traditionally held by the presiding [[Praetor]].

A similar weapon, resembling an [[axe]] was also used by a member of Nero's crew. While widely considered to also be a Teral'n, the weapon has yet to be confirmed as one by an official source.

===Vulcan===

====Ahn'woon====
An ahn'woon is a Vulcan catch-strangle weapon, similar in principle to the Earth Roman gladiator's [[cast net]]. However, it is much more versatile. Depending on the skill of the user, it can be used several ways. It is wide enough to be used as a [[Sling (weapon)|sling]]. (In the [[James Blish]] written adaptation of ''The Original Series'' script, Kirk employs it this way and hits Spock in the ribs with a stone.) The multi-strapped weapon (approximately 1.1 meters long) uses weights on the ends of the straps, like [[bolas]], to entangle, stun, or cut the target. The application of tying action and wrapping, as with a [[garrote]], can restrict the breathing of the target, asphyxiating the victim. It is considered the oldest Vulcan weapon.

====Lirpa====
A lirpa is a [[Vulcan (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] weapon consisting of a wooden staff a little over a meter in length, with a semicircular blade at one end and a metal bludgeon on the other. The overall length of the weapon appears to be approximately 48 inches. It is similar to the [[monk's spade]] and the [[pugil stick]]. Captain [[James T. Kirk]] and [[Spock]] used lirpas when they fought for possession of [[Amok Time|T'Pring]] during Spock's [[Pon farr]] ritual in "[[Amok Time]]". Soldiers sent after [[Jonathan Archer]] and [[T'Pol]] fought with lirpas because Vulcan's "Forge" region makes conventional energy weapons useless.

===Other===

====Glavin====
In the ''TNG'' episode "Code of Honor", the Ligonians have deep traditions of fighting with a poison-tipped hand weapon called a Glavin. It is a large glove with a recurved claw at the end, and covered with dozens of spines. In several episodes, Worf is seen displaying one in his quarters, most likely the same one used by Lt. Tasha Yar.

====Mortaes====
In the ''TOS'' episode "The Cloud Minders", mortaes and thongs are mining tools used as martial weapons by the "troglyte" (a corruption of "[[Caveman|troglodyte]]") miners, and apparently the ruling class is also trained with these weapons, as Plasus challenges Kirk to hand-to-hand combat, asking, "Are you as brave with a mortae as with a phaser?" Kirk responds, "Both will kill."

====Ushaan-tor====
In the ''Enterprise'' episode "United", Andorian commander [[Thy'lek Shran]] and the NX-01's captain [[Jonathan Archer]], as a second for a Tellarite officer who kills Tallas, Shran's chief tactical officer and lover, engage in an Andorian "ushaan" duel. The weapon used is the '''ushaan-tor''', an Andorian ice-mining blade. The handheld blade of the ''ushaan-tor'' is about 20&amp;nbsp;cm from end to end, and resembles an Inupiat [[Ulu]] blade from Alaska, but in a one-piece all-metal design instead of having a separate wooden handle.

==Subspace weapons==
Subspace weapons are a class of directed energy weapons that directly affect [[subspace (Star Trek)|subspace]]. The weapons can produce actual tears in subspace, and are extremely unpredictable. These weapons were banned under [[List of treaties in Star Trek#Khitomer Accords|the second Khitomer Accord]]. The Son'a equipped their vessels with these types of weapons.

===Isolytic burst===
[[Son'a]] vessels carried and used isolytic burst weapons, a type of subspace weapon. They were seen using this weapon against the [[USS Enterprise (NCC-1701-E)|''Enterprise''-E]] in ''Star Trek: Insurrection''. The ''Enterprise'' was only able to escape the weapon's effect by ejecting its warp core and detonating it to seal a subspace rift.

===Tricobalt devices===
The tricobalt warhead is a subspace weapon whose high-yield detonations can tear holes in subspace. Tricobalt devices are not a standard armament of Federation vessels and yields are calculated in Tera-Cochranes, indicating that its mechanism is somewhat similar to the general reaction in a warp field.

In ''TOS'': "[[A Taste of Armageddon]]", the Eminian Union classified the USS ''Enterprise'' as 'destroyed' when it was hit by virtual tricobalt satellites. In ''DS9'': "[[Trials and Tribble-ations]]", Arne Darvin plants a tricobalt explosive in a dead Tribble in an attempt to kill Kirk. [[USS Voyager (Star Trek)|USS ''Voyager'']] uses a pair of tricobalt devices to destroy the Caretaker array in the ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'' pilot episode, "[[Caretaker (Star Trek: Voyager)|Caretaker]]", and such a device was used against ''Voyager'' in the episode "[[Blink of an Eye (Star Trek: Voyager)|Blink of an Eye]]". A tricobalt warhead was also used by the [[Tholian]]s in the ''[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]'' episode "[[In a Mirror, Darkly]]". They detonated a tricobalt warhead inside the [[gravity well]] of a dead star. The explosion created an interphasic rift, which they used to lure the Federation starship [[List of Starfleet starships ordered by class#Constitution class|USS ''Defiant'']] from another universe.

The games ''[[Star Trek: Armada]]'' and ''[[Star Trek: Armada II]]'' have ships armed with Tricobalt devices for artillery support. The [[Federation]] ''Steamrunner''-class, the [[Klingon]] ''Chuq'Beh''-class Bird of Prey, the [[Romulan]] ''Raptor''-class Warbird, and the [[Borg (Star Trek)|Borg]] Harbinger are all capable of using them. The workings of the weapon is unknown but theorised is the use of [[Cobalt-60]].&lt;ref name="The Voyager Conspiracy"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=The Voyager Conspiracy| title=The Voyager Conspiracy| series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="In a Mirror, Darkly"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=In a Mirror, Darkly| title=In a Mirror, Darkly, Part 1| series=[[Star Trek: Enterprise]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is far more likely that tricobalt refers to the third periodical table analog for cobalt; similar to dilithium being the second periodic table equivalent of regular lithium. "trititanium" and most other in trek universe usage where a numeric prefix is appended to a regular real world periodic table element refers to additional periodic tables whose elements are composed of nucleons that are not protons or neutrons and maybe not even regular electrons yet can form atoms molecules and chemical compounds similar to normal matter.

Neutron radiation such as produced by a Cobalt 60 weapon is not very useful for destroying outposts, starships or anything else that is not a living creature.

==Other weapons==

===Magnetometric guided charges===
Around Stardate 43995, the Borg used this weapon to drive the USS ''Enterprise'', NCC-1701-D, from the Paulson Nebula. This shortly leads to the abduction of Captain Jean-Luc Picard.

===Multikinetic neutronic mines===
During Season 4, Episode 1 of ''[[Star Trek: Voyager]]'', [[Kathryn Janeway|Captain Janeway]] consults with Borg representative Seven of Nine on how to destroy [[Species 8472]]. Janeway calls Seven of Nine's "multikinetic neutronic mine" a "weapon of mass destruction," following up on a statement from [[Tuvok]] that it would affect an entire starsystem, destroying innocent worlds. The mine's five-million isoton yield can disperse Borg nanoprobes across a five-light year range.

===Dreadnought===
Dreadnought was a Cardassian self-guided missile, containing one thousand kilograms of matter, and another thousand of antimatter. Tuvok describes this as enough to destroy a small moon. Although described as a self-guided missile, in practice Dreadnought functions much like an autonomous starship, and it even had life support capability on board. It possesses shields, phasers, a complement of quantum torpedoes, a Thoron shock emitter, a plasma wave weapon, engines capable of reaching at least Warp 9, and a sophisticated computer AI. It appears in the ''Voyager'' [[Dreadnought (Star Trek: Voyager)|episode of the same name]]. It had been captured by the [[Maquis (Star Trek)|Maquis]] due to a failed detonator and reprogrammed to attack its original creators. It was dragged into the Delta Quadrant in much the same manner as ''Voyager'', and when unable to resolve the unforeseen situation it locked on to a planet that was similar to the one it was programmed to target, but which was inhabited by innocents. Dreadnought was equipped with an exceptionally sophisticated artificial intelligence, capable of "paranoia" to a certain degree, as when reprogrammer B'Elanna Torres attempted to prevent it from destroying the innocent planet, it came to the conclusion that she had been captured by her Cardassian enemies and forced to make up a story to prevent the attack; it then ''pretended'' to follow her commands and shut down, only to re-activate and continue its mission once she was no longer aboard.

===Series 5 long range tactical armor unit===
Similar in purpose to the Cardassian Dreadnought, the Tactical Armor Units are self-guided missiles with sophisticated artificial intelligence. They are much smaller than Dreadnought, being only a few feet in length, and while nowhere near as powerful, they are nonetheless classified as weapons of mass destruction, capable of destroying everything in a 200-kilometer radius with a highly focused antimatter explosion. Their coordination and control is done through a "Strategic Command Matrix", analogous to a nuclear control network of the type used by the United States. Each one possesses shielding, warp drive of indeterminate speed, and a sentient, [[genius]]-level [[artificial intelligence]] programmed to do whatever is necessary to reach their targets and detonate. They can detect and prevent tampering, are intelligent enough to find a way past almost any obstacle, and can win engagements even when outnumbered. They were created by a Delta Quadrant race called the Druoda, and the devices were greatly feared for their endurance and tenacity.&lt;ref name="Warhead"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Warhead (Star Trek: Voyager)| title=Warhead| series=[[Star Trek: Voyager]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Q firearms===
Q firearms were used in the Q Civil War by the ''Voyager'' crew to compensate against the infinite power of the Q in "[[The Q and the Grey]]". They are depicted as muzzle-loading muskets, to fit with the American Civil War-theme used by the Q Continuum as a concession to the human characters' limited perceptions. Presumably, their actual form would be as incomprehensible to non-Q as the Continuum itself. The use of the weapons caused supernovae as a side effect in normal reality. They are arguably the most powerful weapons ever wielded by any humanoid species, as indicated by their ability to injure the otherwise-invulnerable Q.

===Red matter===
In the 2009 ''[[Star Trek (film)|Star Trek]]'' reboot, red matter was developed on [[Vulcan (Star Trek planet)#Homeworld|Vulcan]] before 2387. When even a droplet is ignited an unstable [[Gravitational singularity|singularity]] is formed; accordingly, it must be stored in a protective chamber. The red matter was originally to be used to save the Romulan homeworld from a volatile [[supernova]], but the design was finished too late to prevent Romulus' destruction. Upon capture in the "past" (2258) by the Romulan Nero, it was used as a planet-destroying [[doomsday weapon]] in conjunction with a plasma drill which bored a hole almost to the core of a planet. A small amount of red matter was then activated at the bottom of the drilling site, creating a black hole in the heart of the planet that would tear it apart from within. Red matter was thus used to destroy an alternate Vulcan ("alternate" due to temporal disruption, from Nero's haphazard method of time travel), then ultimately destroyed Nero's ship, the ''Narada'', along with all remaining technology from his ship, and all of the remaining red matter.

===Psionic resonator===
A psionic resonator was a weapon that functioned by amplifying telepathic energy and focusing it into kinetic form. In 2369 one type of Vulcan psionic resonator, known as the Stone of Gol was discovered to still exist, though in pieces, long after it was thought destroyed. The mercenary Arctus Baran was hired to locate the pieces and deliver them to the Vulcan Isolationist Movement.&lt;ref name="Gambit"&gt;{{cite episode| episodelink=Gambit (Star Trek: The Next Generation)| title=Gambit| series=[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Willie Tax''' is the municipal 1% tax imposed on the residents of the city of [[Caguas]], [[Puerto Rico]]. The name is derived from the proponent mayor [[William Miranda Marin]]. The tax was levied in September 2005 after much debate and protest from the local residents. It was levied as a way to charge residents for the waste disposal that the municipalities have to provide by law. It has resulted in an estimated $500,000 city income.

The '''Yusufeli Dam''' is an [[arch dam]] under construction on the [[Çoruh River]] near [[Yusufeli]] in [[Artvin Province]] within the eastern [[Black Sea]] region of [[Turkey]]. The Yusufeli Dam will be the second largest dam within the larger Çoruh River Development Plan, which plans to build 13 dams, of which two are operational and another two are under construction. The dam's main purpose is [[hydroelectric]] power production and it will support a 540 [[Watt#Megawatt|MW]] power station. The dam is controversial because of its projected impact on the biodiversity within its reservoir area along with the relocation of locals.

On February 26, 2013, the foundation stone was laid in a ceremony attended by Minister of Forestry and Waterworks [[Veysel Eroğlu]] and Minister of Labor and Social Security [[Faruk Çelik]]. It is expected that the construction of the dam will cost {{Turkish lira}}487 million (approx. US$270 million).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.todayszaman.com/news-308216-foundation-of-turkeys-tallest-dam-yusufeli-laid-in-artvin.html |newspaper=[[Today's Zaman]] |title=Foundation of Turkey's tallest dam, Yusufeli, laid in Artvin |date=2013-02-26 |accessdate=2013-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The dam's opening date is set to May 29, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.hurriyet.com.tr/gundem/22688708.asp |newspaper=[[Hürriyet]] Gündem |title=Canlı yayında ilginç pazarlık |date=2013-02-26 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; When completed, Yusufeli Dam will be Turkey's highest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.sabah.com.tr/Yasam/2013/02/27/turkiyenin-en-yuksek-barajinin-temeli-atildi |newspaper=[[Sabah (newspaper)|Sabah]] |title=Türkiye'nin en yüksek barajının temeli atıldı |date=2013-02-27 |language=Turkish |accessdate=2013-02-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first studies on the Yusufeli Dam were carried out in the 1970s and it was included in the Coruh River Hydropower Development Master Plan in 1982. The feasibility report was completed in 1986 and the project was added to the national plan in 1997.&lt;ref name="dsi"/&gt;

==Design==
Situated {{convert|70|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Artvin]], the Yusufeli will be a double-curvature arch dam with a height of {{Convert|270|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} from its foundation and {{Convert|223|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} from the river's [[thalweg]] (lowest point of river bed). It will have a crest length of {{Convert|490|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and crest width of {{Convert|15|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} while being composed of {{Convert|2900000|m3|ft3|0|abbr=on}} of concrete.&lt;ref name="dsi"&gt;{{cite web|title=YUSUFELİ BARAJI ve HES|url=http://www2.dsi.gov.tr/yusufeli_projesi.pdf|publisher=[[State Hydraulic Works]]|accessdate=15 January 2011|language=Turkish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The dam's crest will sit at an altitude of {{Convert|715|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} above sea level while the normal operating level of its reservoir will be {{Convert|710|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, maximum will be {{Convert|712|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} and the minimum {{Convert|670|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}. The reservoir surface area of {{Convert|33|km2|sqmi|0|abbr=on}} will have a total storage capacity of {{Convert|2130000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on|lk=out}} and an active or "useful" storage of {{Convert|1080000000|m3|acre.ft|0|abbr=on|lk=out}}. The dam's spillway will be a service controlled chute type with a maximum discharge capacity of {{Convert|8000|m3/s|ft3/s|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="dsi"/&gt;

The dam will have an [[underground power station]] that is {{Convert|110|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} long, {{Convert|21.4|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} wide and {{Convert|45.2|m|ft|0|abbr=on}} high. Within the power station will be 3 x 180 MW vertical shaft [[Francis turbine]]s.&lt;ref name="dsi"/&gt;

Design activities will be carried out by Su-Yapi Engineering and Consulting Inc.

Construction is to be carried out by a [[Limak Holding]]-[[Cengiz Holding]]-Kolin consortium.&lt;ref name=limak&gt;{{cite web|title=Yusufeli Dam and Hydroelectric Power Plant|url=http://www.limak.com.tr/sectors/construction/projects/dams/yusufeli-dam-and-hydroelectric-power-plant|publisher=Limak|accessdate=7 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Projected biological impacts ==
If built, Yusufeli Dam is expected to have significant biological impacts including:

*Adversely affecting 21 nationally listed threatened plant species, (including ''[[Iris taochia]]'') of which all except one are [[Endemism|endemic]] to Turkey.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eca-watch.org/problems/dams/Comments_Yusufeli_EIA_9oct06.pdf Lambourne, M 2006, 'Biological Assessment: the Yusufeli Dam &amp; Hydro-electric Power Project's Environmental Impact Assessment']&lt;/ref&gt; Of these threatened species 2 [[taxa]] are limited to [[Yusufeli]] and its surroundings, 8 are limited to the Çoruh Valley, and 6 to the [[Artvin]]-[[Erzurum]] area. Turkish Red Book for Plants shows that of these, 7 species are critically endangered, 5 are endangered and 9 are vulnerable.&lt;ref&gt;Ekim, T, Koyuncu, M, Vural, M, Duman, H, Aytac, Z &amp; Adiguzel, N 2000, Türkiye Bitkileri Kırmızı Kitabi – Red Data Book of Turkish Plants, Türkiye Tabiatını Koruma Derneği – Turkish Association for the Conservation of Nature, Ankara, Turkey.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adversely affecting 12 nationally listed threatened mammal species including the; [[wild goat]] (''Capra aegagrus''), [[chamois]] (''Rupicapra rupicapra''), [[Persian squirrel]] (''Sciurus anomalus''), [[forest dormouse]] (''Dryomys nitedula''), [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos''), [[Eurasian badger]] (''Meles meles''), [[gray wolf]] (''Canis lupus''), [[Mediterranean horseshoe bat]] (''Rhinolophus euryale''), [[lesser horseshoe bat]] (''Rhinolophus hipposideros''), [[greater mouse-eared bat]] (''Myotis myoti''s), Schreibers’ bat (''[[Miniopterus schreibersii]]'') and [[pipistrelle bat]] (''Pipistrellus pipistrellus''). Of these species the Mediterranean bat and wild goat are internationally listed on [[IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/search-basic IUCN 2006, IUCN Red List of Threatened Species]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071230183532/http://www.iucnredlist.org/search/search-basic |date=December 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Adversely affecting 2 nationally threatened fish species, the Black Sea [[salmon]] (''Salmo trutta labrax'') and brown [[trout]] (''Salmo trutta macrostigma''). The Black Sea salmon’s migration will be blocked because of this and the other planned and built dams. Existing populations of fish will be adversely affected by the construction of the dam and another 6 species populations may not recover due to the reduction of creek and river habitat needed for breeding.
*Potentially adversely affecting 5 [[butterfly]] and 1 [[dragonfly]] regionally rare species (''[[Polyommatus]] poseidon'', ''[[Pseudophilotes vicrama]]'', ''[[Pyrgus cirsii]]'', ''[[Scolitantides orion]]'', ''[[Thymelicus acteon]]'', and ''[[Onychogomphus assimilis]]'')  of which 2 are listed in the IUCN Red List ''Pyrgus cirsii'' and ''Onychogomphus assimilis''.&lt;ref&gt;Eken G, Bozdogan M, I˙sfendiyaroglu S, Kılıç DT &amp; Lise Y, (editor) 2006, Key biodiversity areas in Turkey, Doga Dernegi, Ankara, Turkey.&lt;/ref&gt;
