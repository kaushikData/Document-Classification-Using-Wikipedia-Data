      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2611">'''Abu Lubaba ibn Abd al-Mundhir''' was a leading member of the [[Banu Aws]], an Arabic tribe in [[Medina|Yathrib, today known as Medina]].

At some point after [[Muhammad]]'s [[Hijra (Islam)|arrival at Medina]] in 622, Abu Lubaba converted to [[Islam]].

He appears in 627 during the [[Banu Qurayza#Siege and surrender|siege of the Banu Qurayza]], a Jewish tribe in conflict with Muhammad. The Qurayza had a long-standing alliance with the Aws and during the siege asked to confer with Abu Lubaba. According to [[Ibn Ishaq]], Abu Lubaba felt pity for the women and children of the tribe who were crying and when asked whether the Qurayza should surrender to Muhammad, advised them to do so.

Ibn Ishaq's account, going back to Abu Lubaba's own statements, related that he regretted his actions, stating: "My feet had not moved away from the spot before I knew I had been false to [[God]] and His Apostle". He then went to the [[mosque]] in [[Medina]], tied himself to a pillar and declared: "I will not leave this place until God forgives me for what I have done". He also added that he would never enter the locality of Banu Qurayza in recompense for the deadly mistake he made.&lt;ref name="Al-Mubarakpuri, Safiur-Rahman 2002"&gt;Al-Mubarakpuri, Safiur-Rahman, ''The Sealed Nectar''. Riyadh: Darussalam, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; When Muhammad was informed of this incident, he said: "''I would have begged God to forgive him if he had asked me but since he tied himself out of his own free will, then it is God Who would turn to him in forgiveness''".&lt;ref name="Al-Mubarakpuri, Safiur-Rahman 2002"/&gt;

Abu Lubaba stayed tied for six nights.&lt;ref name="Al-Mubarakpuri, Safiur-Rahman 2002"/&gt; One early morning, Muhammad declared that God had forgiven him after reportedly receiving a [[revelation]].&lt;ref name="GPS"&gt;Guillaume, p. 461-463; Peters, p. 222-223; Stillman, p. 137-140.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ashraf Muhammad Yusuf Uthman Abd al-Salam''' ([[Arabic]]: عبدالسلام عثمان يوسف محمد اشرف) is a financial and logistical supporter of [[al-Qaeda]], [[Al-Nusra Front|Jabhat Fateh al-Sham]] (previously known as the al-Nusra Front) and [[Tanzim Qaidat al-Jihad fi Bilad al-Rafidayn|al-Qaeda in Iraq]]. Al-Salam is a [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Department of the Treasury]] labeled [[Specially Designated Global Terrorist]] and was added to the [[United Nations]] and [[European Union]] sanctions lists for his association to the al-Qaeda network. Al-Salam has been fighting in [[Syria]] since early 2014.

== Background ==
Ashraf Muhammad Yusuf Uthman Abd al-Salam is a Jordanian national born in [[Iraq]] in 1984.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/press/en/2015/sc11750.doc.htm|title=Security Council Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee Adds Four Names to Its Sanctions List {{!}} Meetings Coverage and Press Releases|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ashraf al-Salam also holds a national identification card from [[Qatar]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; It is believed that the founder of [[Jund al-Aqsa]], Muhammad Yusuf Uthman Abd al-Salam, is his father and that al-Nusra Front and al-Qaeda supporter ‘Abd al-Malik Muhammad Yusuf Uthman ‘Abd al-Salam is his brother.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.longwarjournal.org/archives/2016/11/analysis-jund-al-aqsas-deep-gulf-roots.php|title=Analysis: Jund al Aqsa’s deep Gulf roots {{!}} FDD's Long War Journal|website=FDD's Long War Journal|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ashraf al-Salam’s brother ‘Abd al-Malik al-Salam is also known as Umar al-Qatari.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2651.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

The man thought to be his father, Muhammad Yusuf Uthman Abd al-Salam, was a Jordanian national of [[Palestinians in Jordan|Palestinian]] descent who was born in Iraq and lived in Qatar. While in Qatar, the suspected father Muhammad al-Salam provided material and logistical support to al-Qaeda in Iraq, the predecessor group of [[Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant|ISIS]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Before founding Jund al-Aqsa, Muhammad Yusuf Uthman Abd al-Salam was a longtime veteran of al-Qaeda and is believed to have worked closely with [[Osama bin Laden]], [[Ayman al-Zawahiri]], and [[Abdullah Yusuf Azzam|Abdullah Azzam]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.alalam.ir/news/1552475|title=‘Spiritual father’ of Syria militants killed in Idlib infighting|website=en.alalam.ir|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ashraf al-Salam’s brother, ‘Abd al-Malik al-Salam is also a citizen of Jordan and a holder of Qatari identification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Support of terrorism ==

=== Al-Qaeda in Iraq ===
Ashraf al-Salam began working with al-Qaeda in Iraq (AQI) in 2005 while the group was under the leadership of [[Abu Musab al-Zarqawi]]. According to the U.S. Treasury, Ashraf supported AQI by opening “stores to facilitate the communications of AQI officials” and assisting in the transfer of thousands of dollars to support AQI operations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Al-Qaeda in Iraq is widely referred to as the predecessor of ISIS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.vox.com/cards/things-about-isis-you-need-to-know/what-is-isis|title=ISIS used to be al-Qaeda in Iraq|last=Beauchamp|first=Zack|date=2014-06-17|newspaper=Vox|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.lawfareblog.com/al-qaeda-iraq-isis-al-zarqawi-al-baghdadi|title=From Al Qaeda in Iraq to ISIS, From al Zarqawi to al Baghdadi|newspaper=Lawfare|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Al-Nusra Front ===
According to the U.S. Department of the Treasury, in early 2012 Ashraf al-Salam facilitated the travel of “associates” to Syria in order to provide training to Syria-based al-Nusra Front members. Also during early 2012, Ashraf al-Salam worked with al-Nusra Front and an “Iraqi explosives expert” in an effort to commit acts of terrorism with explosives.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/jl2651.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Al-Qaeda Core ===
In mid-2012, al-Salam worked with Qatari al-Qaeda financier [[Khalifa Muhammad Turki al-Subaiy]] to facilitate the transfer of funds intended for al-Qaeda in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In 2008, the U.S. Department of the Treasury listed al-Subaiy in its press release entitled “Gulf-Based al Qaida Financiers” while the UN listed al-Subaiy in 2008 as being associated with al-Qaeda.&lt;ref&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.treasury.gov/press-center/press-releases/Pages/hp1011.aspx&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.un.org/sc/suborg/en/search/content/KHALIFA%20MUHAMMAD%20TURKI%20AL-SUBAIY|title=Search {{!}} United Nations Security Council Subsidiary Organs|website=www.un.org|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the U.S. Department of Treasury, al-Salam worked with al-Subaiy “to facilitate the transfer of hundreds of thousands of dollars” to Pakistan-based al-Qaeda.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; [[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]] covered al-Salam’s connections to al-Subaiy in October 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/middleeast/syria/11140190/Banker-who-financed-911-mastermind-now-funding-terrorists-in-Syria-and-Iraq.html|title=Banker who financed 9/11 mastermind now funding terrorists in Syria and Iraq|newspaper=Telegraph.co.uk|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Telegraph article was later covered in Arabic and appeared on the e-newspaper [[Bahrain Mirror]].

== International terrorist designations  ==
In September 2014, the U.S. Department of Justice designated Ashraf al-Salam a Specially Designated Global Terrorist pursuant to {{Executive Order|13224}}.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

On January 23, 2015, the UN added Ashraf al-Salam to its ISIL (Da’esh) &amp; Al-Qaida Sanctions List. As a result, al-Salam has been subject to a UN assets freeze, travel ban, and arms embargo as specified in the 2012 Security Council resolution 2083 of [[Chapter VII of the United Nations Charter|Chapter VII of the UN Charter]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In February 2015, the European Union added al-Salam and three other individuals to a sanctions list against persons and entities associated with the al-Qaeda network.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;&lt;nowiki&gt;http://hb.betterregulation.com/external/Notice%202015_C%2038_09.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In each of the three designations, Ashraf’s brother, ‘Abd al-Malik Muhammad Yusuf Uthman ‘Abd al-Salam, was also listed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Syria ==
According to the U.S. Treasury and UN, Al-Salam has been “a fighter” in Syria since early 2014. It has been presumed that al-Salam is a member of the al-Nusra Front in Syria for his ties to the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.counterextremism.com/extremists/ashraf-muhammad-yusuf-uthman-abd-al-salam|title=Ashraf Muhammad Yusuf Uthman Abd al-Salam {{!}} Counter Extremism Project|website=www.counterextremism.com|access-date=2016-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6559">'''Avram Moiseevich Razgon''' ({{lang-ru|Аврам Моисе́евич Разго́н́}}; 6 January 1920, [[Yartsevo, Smolensk Oblast|Yartsevo]]  – 3 February 1989, [[Moscow]]) was a Russian historian and a prominent Soviet theoretician of museology, [[Doktor nauk]] (1974), and [[Academic ranks in Russia#Professorship|university professor]] (1986).

== Career ==
A. Razgon graduated from [[Moscow State University|Lomonosov University]]  in 1948. He was a student and later an associate of N. Rubinstein, a renowned Soviet historian and specialist in the [[historiography]] of Russian history.

He worked as a Senior scientific officer (1952-1962) and later as the Deputy Director for Science (1962-1972) in the Research Institute for Museum Studies in Moscow.

Razgon was the head of the Museum Studies sector at the ''Museum of Revolution'' from 1972 to 1974. He headed the Department of cartography of the [[State Historical Museum]], Moscow, from 1974 to 1988. In 1984, he founded the Department of Museum Studies at the ''All-Union Institute of improvement of professional skills of workers of art and culture'', and was the head of the Department until 1989. He was also lecturing on [[Museology]] in the Faculty of History at [[Moscow State University|Lomonosov University]] and in the Department of Museum Studies of the ''Moscow State Historico-Archival Institute''.  In the USSR, he was the first academic to attain the rank of Professor in the Department of Museum Studies (1986).

Razgon was one of the founders of [[International Council of Museums|ICOM]]’s International Committee for museology (ICOFOM) and from 1977 to 1983 was ICOFOM’s Vice President. He participated in the creation of the international Glossary of museum terms ''[[Dictionarium museologicum]]'' published in 1983 and 1986.

Together with museologists from the [[GDR]], Razgon led an international project to write the book “Museum Studies: Historical museums” which was published in 1988 and which was, for many years, the main textbook on museology. In the last decades of his life, Razgon put a lot of energy into the development of the theoretical and methodological foundations of the education of professional museologists.

The [[State Historical Museum]] and other heritage institutions have organized a number of conferences to commemorate his work and ideas for the purpose of the further development of museum theory and practice.

== Research interests ==

Razgon authored over 100 scientific papers on [[economic history]] and [[museology]]. His research was based on both printed and archival sources as well as on objects from museum collections, and his writings were devoted to the history of historical, archaeological, military and local lore museums and to the protection of monuments of history and culture in the context of the history of society and development of scientific knowledge. Summarizing these observations, his doctoral dissertation "Historical museums in Russia in 1861-1917" (1973) became an important work in the historiography of [[Russian museology]]. He directed the preparation of collective writings on the history of museum work entitled: “Essays on the History of museums in Russia and the USSR” (1960-1971) and were among those Razgon published about the state of historical museums and monuments from the 18th century to [[Russian Revolution|the year 1917]].

Since the mid1970s, Razgon’s scientific interests lay mainly in the field of history and the theory of museum work. Razgon considered that museology was showing “features of an independent scientific branch” &lt;ref&gt;[http://network.icom.museum/fileadmin/user_upload/minisites/icofom/pdf/MuWoP%201%20(1980)%20Eng.pdf ''Razgon A.M.'' Museological provocations 1979, in Museology – Science or just practical museum work? MuWoP 1, 1980, p. 11–12.]&lt;/ref&gt; that was studying the processes of the preservation of social information, a knowledge of the world and the transfer of knowledge and emotion through museum objects. Razgon was promoting the idea of “museum sources studies”, i.e. museum objects analyzed as a source of information. He was also interested in determining the place of museology in relation to other sciences and fields of knowledge and in the improvement of museological terminology.

Razgon’s idea of “museum sources studies” as a separate area of knowledge was later developed in the writings of Nina P. Finyagina (1930-2000) and Natalia G. Samarina (1958-2011). From their point of view, the main difference between the “museum sources studies” and “[[Source criticism#Source criticism in archaeology and history|historical source studies]]” lay in the emphasis on semantic information that a museum object carries.

Born in [[Langenburg]], [[Kingdom of Württemberg]] on 13 September 1863, Ernst was the oldest of three children, and the only son, of [[Hermann, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]], and [[Princess Leopoldine of Baden]], daughter of [[Prince William of Baden]].  He was also the grand-nephew of [[Queen Victoria]]: i.e., his paternal great-grandmother was Victoria (of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld, and later by her first marriage of Leiningen), the mother of Queen Victoria, and his grandmother was Feodora of Leiningen, Queen Victoria's half-sister.  He married the Queen's granddaughter, [[Princess Alexandra of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|Princess Alexandra of Edinburgh]], daughter of [[Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha|The Prince Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha and Duke of Edinburgh]] and [[Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna of Russia|Grand Duchess Maria Alexandrovna]], on 20 April 1896 at the [[Ehrenburg Palace]] (''Schloss'' Ehrenburg) in [[Coburg]], [[Germany]].

===Education===
After finishing high school in [[Karlsruhe]], the young prince studied law in [[Paris]], [[Bonn]], [[Tübingen]] and [[Leipzig]], where he graduated in 1885 with the first legal exam in [[Naumburg]]. He also gained membership in the Corps Suevia Tübingen (1st Class) in 1884, when he was at the [[University of Tübingen]] and Borussia Bonn in 1886, because he had gone to the [[University of Bonn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Otto Gerlach, ''Kösener Corpslisten 1960'' ([[Bochum]]: ''Verbandes Alten Corpsstudenten'' [Association of Old Students Corps], 1961), Corps List 129, p. 381; Corps List 9, p. 713&lt;/ref&gt;  After his officer training in [[Lichterfelde (Berlin)|Berlin-Lichterfelde]] (1886-1891), he passed the diplomatic examination (1890-1891) with the appointment as Secretary of the Imperial German Embassy in [[St. Petersburg]] and London (1891-1894). In the following years he worked in [[Strasbourg]] as an assistant for his father, Prince Hermann, the Imperial Governor of [[Alsace-Lorraine]], and prepared himself for his future as a Peer of the Kingdom of Württemberg.

===Career===
Because his wife was the daughter of Alfred, Duke of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, Ernst became the Regent of the Duchy after the death of the Duke.  From 30 July 1900 to 18 July 1905, he governed Saxe-Coburg and Gotha on the behalf of the still immature successor, Charles Edward.  In 1901, Ernst was awarded with the Grand Cross of the [[Order of the Crown (Württemberg)|Order of the Crown of Württemberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Königliches Statistisches Landesamt [Royal State Office of Statistics], ''Hof- und Staatshandbuch des Königreichs Württemberg 1907, Erster Teil'' [Court and State Handbook of the Kingdom of Württemberg 1907, First Part] ([[Stuttgart]]:  W[ilhelm]. Kohlhammer, 1907), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt;  Afterwards, he made several unsuccessful attempts to gain a foothold in the politics of the German Empire.  He served as the Head of the Colonial Department of the Foreign Office (1906–1906) and the Deputy (1907–1911) and Vice President (1909–1910) of the ''[[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]]''.  In 1913, on the death of his father, Ernst became the Prince of Hohelohe-Langeburg, entitling him to sit in the ''[[Estates of Württemberg|Kammer der Standesherren]]'' [House of Lords] of Württemberg, where he had already been serving as his father’s deputy since 1895.  He would keep his seat until the [[German Revolution of 1918|November Revolution]] of 1918.  During the [[First World War]], the Prince was active as a volunteer in the military hospitals as well as the General Delegate to the [[Eastern Front (World War I)|Eastern Front]] and Imperial Commissioner and military inspector.  He was also sent in 1915 as a special envoy to [[Istanbul|Constantinople]] and the [[Balkans]].

===Relationship with the Nazi Party===
After [[Adolf Hitler]] came to power in 1933, Ernst joined his son (who had already entered in 1931) in the [[Nazi Party]] with the membership number of 3726902.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} Ernst Klee, ''Das Kulturlexikon zum Dritten Reich. Wer war was vor und nach 1945'' [The Cultural Dictionary of the Third Reich:  Who was What Before and After 1945] ([[Frankfurt am Main]]:  S. Fischer, 2007), p. 261.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Retirement===
After the Second World War, Ernst retired to private life.  His wife, who suffered from various illnesses died in 1942. Ernst was dedicated to church and nursing activities and was a member of the [[German Evangelical Church Assembly]] (the ''Kirchentag''), Commander of the ''Württemberg-Badenschen Genossenschaft'' (Württemberg-Baden Cooperative), Governor of the [[Order of Saint John (Bailiwick of Brandenburg)|Bailiwick of Brandenburg Order of St. John]], Honorary President of the Württemberg State Association of the [[Red Cross]] as well as of the Evangelical People’s League of Württemberg (''Evangelischen Volksbund für Württemberg'').  On 11 December 1950, Ernst died at the age 87 at Langenburg, [[Baden-Württemberg]], in what was then [[West Germany]].

==Children==
The children of Prince Ernst and Princess Alexandra of Hohelohe-Langenburg were descended from both [[Queen Victoria]] and Victoria's half-sister [[Feodora of Leiningen]].  They were:
*[[Gottfried, Prince of Hohenlohe-Langenburg|Gottfried Hermann Alfred Paul Maximilian Viktor Fürst zu Hohenlohe-Langenburg]] + b. 24 Mar 1897, d. 11 May 1960, married 20 April 1931 [[Princess Margarita of Greece and Denmark]], sister of [[Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh]].
*[[Princess Marie Melita of Hohenlohe-Langenburg]] + b. 18 Jan 1899, d. 8 Nov 1967; married Wilhelm Friedrich, Duke of Schleswig-Holstein
*Princess Alexandra Beatrice Leopoldine of Hohenlohe-Langenburg b. 2 Apr 1901, d. 26 Oct 1963
*Princess Irma Helene of Hohenlohe-Langenburg b. 4 Jul 1902, d. 8 Mar 1986

[[File:A Cricket fan at the Chepauk stadium, Chennai.jpg|thumb|[[Sudhir Kumar Chaudhary]] is a diehard fan of [[cricket]]er [[Sachin Tendulkar]] and the [[Indian cricket team]], who travels to all Indian home games with his body painted as the [[Indian flag]]]]
A '''fan''', or [[Fanaticism|fanatic]], sometimes also termed '''aficionado''' or '''supporter''', is a person who is enthusiastically devoted to something or somebody, such as a singer or band, a sports team, a [[genre]], a politician, a book, a movie or an entertainer. Collectively, the fans of a particular object or person constitute its fanbase or [[fandom]]. They may show their [[enthusiasm]] in a variety of ways, such as by promoting the object of their interest, being members of a [[fan club]], holding or participating in [[fan convention]]s, or writing [[fan mail]]. They may also engage in creative activities ("[[fan labor]]") such as creating [[fanzine]]s, writing [[fan fiction]], making memes or drawing [[fan art]].

==Etymology==
Merriam-Webster, the Oxford dictionary and other sources define "fan" as a shortened version of the word ''fanatic''.  ''[[Fanaticism|Fanatic]]'' itself, introduced into English around 1550, means "marked by excessive enthusiasm and often intense uncritical devotion". It comes from the Modern [[Latin (language)|Latin]] ''fanaticus'', meaning "insanely but divinely inspired". The word originally pertained to a [[temple]] or sacred place [Latin ''fanum'', poetic English ''fane'']. The modern sense of "extremely zealous" dates from around 1647; the use of ''fanatic'' as a noun dates from 1650. However, the term "fancy" for an intense liking of something (a usage attested by 1545&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title="fancy, v." OED Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/68026|date=July 2018|url-access=subscription|accessdate=2018-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;), while being of a different etymology, coincidentally carries a less intense but somewhat similar connotation to "fanatic". Use of "the fancy" to mean avid sports enthusiasts emerged as an [[American English|Americanism]] in the mid-19th C.&lt;ref name="BBCblog"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/blogs-magazine-monitor-34298659 |title=The Vocabularist: Are fans fanatical or fanciful? - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=2015-09-22 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Dickson Baseball Dictionary'' cites William Henry Nugent's work asserting that it was derived from ''the fancy'', a term referring to the fans of a specific hobby or sport from the early 18th century to the 19th, especially to the followers of [[boxing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=fan&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|title=Fan (n.2)|author=Douglas Harper |work= Online Etymology Dictionary |accessdate=22 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that theory, it was originally shortened to ''fance'' then just to the homonym ''fans''.{{failed verification|date=October 2018}} ''The Great American Baseball Scrapbook'' attributes the term to [[Chris Von der Ahe]], owner of the Saint Louis Brown Stockings in 1882. Von der Ahe sold tickets for 25 cents, hoping the many patrons would purchase his beer; the low ticket price helped him lead the stats in attendance. He called the fanatics filling his stands "fans". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Suehsdorf |title=The Great American Baseball Scrapbook |year=1978 |publisher=Random House |ISBN=0-394-50253-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Supporter'' is a synonym to "fan" that predates the latter term and is still commonly used in [[British English]], especially to denote fans of [[sport]]s teams. However, the term "fan" has become popular throughout the [[English language|English]]-speaking world, including the [[United Kingdom]]. The term ''supporter'' is also used in a [[political]] sense in the [[United States]], to a fan of a [[politician]], a [[political party]], and a controversial issue.

==Characteristics==

Fans usually have a strong enough interest that some changes in their [[lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyles]] are made to accommodate devotion to the focal object. Fans have a desire for external involvement – they are motivated to demonstrate their involvement with the area of interest through certain behaviors (attending [[Fan convention|conventions]], posting online, displaying team banners outside their homes, etc.). Fans often have a "wish to acquire" material objects related to the area of interest, such as a baseball hit by a famous slugger or a used [[guitar pick]] from their musical hero. As well, some fans have a desire for [[social interaction]] with other fans. This again may take many forms, from casual conversation, e-mail, chat rooms, and electronic mailing lists to regular face-to-face meetings such as fan club meetings and organized conventions.

There are several groups of fans that can be differentiated by the intensity level of their level of involvement or interest in the hobby (level of [[fanaticism]])&lt;ref name=TB&gt;{{cite journal | last = Thorne | first = Scott |author2=Bruner, Gordon C. | year = 2006 | title = An exploratory investigation of the characteristics of consumer fanaticism | journal = Qualitative Market Research: an International Journal | volume = 9 | issue = 1 | pages = 51–72 | doi = 10.1108/13522750610640558 | url = http://www.emeraldinsight.com/Insight/ViewContentServlet?Filename=Published/EmeraldFullTextArticle/Articles/2160090104.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; The likelihood for a subject of interest to be elevated to the level of fandom appears to be dictated by its complexity. Complexity allows further involvement of fans for a longer period of time because of the time needed to work the subject of interest 'out.' It also contributes to a greater sense of belonging because of the mental effort invested in the subject.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Types==
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2016}}

===Celebrities===
[[File:Tobey Maguire greets fans at Spiderman 3 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|[[Tobey Maguire]] greets fans at ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' premiere]]
These fans will often hold a crush on a major [[movie star]], [[pop music|pop star]], [[athlete]] or [[celebrity]] (see [[teen idol]]). The [[groupie]] is an example, a fan of a particular band or musician, who will follow them on concert tours. The degree of devotion to celebrities can range from a simple crush to the [[delusion|deluded]] belief that they have a special relationship with the star which does not exist. In extreme cases, this can lead to [[celebrity worship syndrome]], [[stalking]] behavior. This can easily switch to [[hatred]] of the previously loved celebrity, and result in attempts at violent attacks, one notable incident being the death of [[Rebecca Schaeffer]] by a stalking fan in 1989.

This is somewhat related to the concept of [[parasocial interaction]] where audiences develop one-sided relationships with media characters and celebrities.

===Gaming===
{{details|Gamers}}
Gaming fans, or "gamers", are fans focused on playing non-sport games, usually [[role-playing game]]s, [[board game]]s, [[miniature wargame]]s, [[collectible card game]]s or [[video game]]s.

===Music===
Music fans can differ somewhat from fans of particular musicians, in that they may focus on a genre of music. Many of the trade journals around music, such as ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', were created by music fans. A notable music fan was groupie [[Cynthia Plaster Caster]], famous for making numerous plaster casts of rock stars' penises.  Another was [[Pamela Des Barres]], author of the book ''[[I'm with the Band: Confessions of a Groupie|I'm With The Band]]''.  Fans who are not [[groupie]]s prefer the term ''supporter''.

====Musicals====
{{unreferenced section|date=March 2017}}
Popular [[musical theatre|musicals]] have their own particular sets of fans. ''[[Rent (musical)|Rent]]'' has boasted a sizable number of 'Rentheads' since its Broadway debut,{{citation needed|date=November 2011}} and likewise those devoted to ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'' dub themselves 'Phans'.

===Otaku===
{{details|Otaku}}

''Otaku'' is a Japanese term for people with obsessive interests. In Japan, the term is normally derogatory, a connotation lacking in English, where it generally refers to people in the [[anime and manga fandom]].

===Politics===
People who approve of or associate themselves with certain [[politician]]s or political groups are generally called "supporters" rather than "fans", although there are politicians with official or unofficial "fan clubs".  Intense and organized support for a politician may be referred to as a [[personality cult]], particularly in authoritarian or totalitarian regimes.

===Professional wrestling===

Fans of [[professional wrestling]] can be divided into two groups: [[Mark (professional wrestling)|marks]] and [[Smark (professional wrestling)|smarks]]. Derived from the same term for the prey of [[Confidence trick|conmen]], a mark is a fan who believes that everything associated with professional wrestling is real. In contrast, a "smark" is a fan who recognizes that they are witnessing a stage-managed work ("[[kayfabe]]"), but appreciates it nonetheless, including its backstage aspects.

===Science fiction===

[[File:Star Trek cosplayers in Dragon Con Parade 2010.jpg|thumb|alt=People wearing Star Trek: the Next Gneration uniforms in a parade.|''[[Star Trek]]'' fans cosplaying at Atlanta Dragon Con 2010.]]

Since the 1920s, an increasingly elaborate sub-culture of organized [[science fiction fandom]] has arisen, initially among correspondents to the [[letter column]]s of [[science fiction magazine]]s. This non-centralized movement has given birth to [[science fiction fanzines]] (and [[amateur press associations]]), [[science fiction conventions]], the [[Hugo Awards]] (and various imitators/derivatives), [[filk music]], "fan funds" such as the [[Trans Atlantic Fan Fund]], and a variety of other institutions, jargon and customs. It has nurtured writers and artists such as [[Ray Bradbury]], [[Roger Ebert]], [[Lenny Kaye]], [[Michael Moorcock]] and [[Trina Robbins]]; and has generated such spin-offs as comic book fandom, [[media fandom]], the [[Society for Creative Anachronism]], [[game|gaming]] fandom, and [[furry fandom]], sometimes collectively referred to as "fringe fandoms".

Science fiction fandom developed its own slang, known as [[fanspeak]] after the "Newspeak" of the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-four]]''.  Fanspeak is made up of [[acronym]]s, blended words, obscure in-jokes, [[pun]]s, coinages from science fiction novels or films, and archaic or standard English words used in specific ways relevant or amusing to the science fiction community.  Some fanspeak terms, like [[fanzine]] have become standard English.  Some fanspeak terms relate to fans themselves:
* An [[wikt:actifan|Actifan]] is a fan involved in "[[wikt:fanac|fanac]]" (fan activity), such as producing a fanzine or running a convention.  The opposite is a [[wikt:passifan|Passifan]], who enjoys the subject of the fandom and is not directly involved in the fandom.
* A [[Big Name Fan]] (BNF) is a fan who has become well-known within a fandom for their contributions of various sorts, such as heading of a major blog or contributing to the franchise itself.
* [[wikt:fanne|Fanne]] was used in early fandom as a feminine equivalent to "fan".
* [[wikt:fen#Etymology 2|Fen]] was used within fandom as the plural of the word "fan", by analogy with "men" as the plural of "man".  This extended to other fanspeak terms, resulting in actifen, passifen, trufen, and so forth.
* A [[wikt:trufan|Trufan]] is a very active and dedicated fan.

Specific sub-groups of science fiction fandom are often known by a collection term.  For example:
* [[Trekkie]]s are fans focused on the ''[[Star Trek]]'' [[science fiction]] franchise. Arising out of [[science fiction fandom]] they, to some extent, have served as a template for other organized fandoms in the [[science fiction television]] and [[science fiction film|film]] genres.  Some "Trekkies" prefer to be referred to as "Trekkers" as they feel the term "Trekkies" was used in the past as a derogatory name for them and they hope to avoid the traditional stigma sometimes associated with being known as a "Trekkie".  Many "old school" fans of the ''Star Trek'' universe defiantly, and proudly, refer to themselves, and other ''Star Trek'' fans, as "Trekkies" rather than the kinder, gentler "Trekkers" name used by many of the newer generations of ''Star Trek'' fans.
* [[Whovians]] are fans of the longest running science fiction television show in the world, [[Doctor Who]].

{{see also|Sociology of sport|:Category:Sports fandom}}
A sports fan can be an enthusiast for a particular athlete, team, sport, or all of organized sports as a whole. Sports fans often attend sporting events in [[stadiums]], in [[sports bars]], or watch them at home on television, and follow news through newspapers,  websites, and social media.&lt;ref name="understanding"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Earnheardt |first1=Adam C. |last2=Haridakis |first2=Paul M. |editor-last1=Earnheardt |editor-first1=Adam C. |editor-last2=Haridakis |editor-first2=Paul M. |editor-last3=Hugenberg |editor-first3=Barbara |title=Sports Fans, Identity, and Socialization: Exploring the Fandemonium  |publisher=Lexington Books |date=May 30, 2013 |pages=1–6 |chapter=Understanding Fans' Consumption and Dissemination of Sports: An Introduction |isbn=978-0739146217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mentality of the sports fan is often such that they will experience a game, or event while living vicariously through players or teams whom the fan favors.&lt;ref name="fandom1"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Earnheardt |first1=Adam C. |last2=Haridakis |first2=Paul M. |date=October 1, 2009 |title=An examination of fan-athlete interaction: Fandom, parasocial interaction, and identification |url=http://digitalcommons.kent.edu/commpubs/2 |journal=Ohio Communication Journal |volume=47 |pages=27–53}}&lt;/ref&gt; This behavior manifests itself in a number of different ways, depending on the venue. At a stadium or arena, sports fans will voice their pleasure with a particular incident, player, or team by [[cheering]], which consists of clapping, fist-pumping, or shouting positive exclamations toward the field of play and ultimately, the favorable object. Likewise, displeasure toward a particular incident, player, or team may be met by fans with booing, shouting of expletives, and sometimes throwing of objects onto the field. This violent type of fan reaction is often called [[hooliganism]].

[[File:Shea Crowded.jpg|thumb|left|Shea Stadium filled with fans prior to the start of a [[New York Mets]] game in 2008. The stadium had the best attendance in the [[National League]] that year, garnering over 53,000 fans per game on average.]]

Lighter, more harmless objects are also occasionally thrown onto certain fields of play as a form of celebration of a favorable sports feat. This is most common when a member of the home team scores a [[hat trick]] in hockey. Other, more mild forms of displeasure shown by sports fans at sporting events involve simple groans of disappointment, and silence. These actions often denote that the favored home team is being outperformed by, or has lost to the much less-favored road team.

In North America, extremely enthusiastic fans are often called  "superfans": fans who dress up in outrageous and ostentatious costumes or outfits showing their devotion. Fanbases well known for their tenacious love and undying support are called ''[[Rabies|rabid]] fans'' or fanatics. These fans often congregate hours before kickoff in what is known as a [[tailgation]] or tailgating.

At [[Bar (establishment)|sports bars]], sports fans will gather together, often while consuming food and alcoholic beverages, with the purpose of following a particular sporting event on television as a group. Sports bars often advertise in hopes of drawing fans of a particular player or team to watch together to increase bonds between fans and prevent fights. This can create the sense of unity in a sports bar as all cheers and boos will appear to be synchronized due to similar feelings and reactions by nearly all fans at the fortunes and misfortunes of the favored team or athlete. Due to the level of devotion and intensity of feeling towards the favored team or athlete by sports bar patrons, as well as partially due to the alcohol being served, behavior that would be seen as unruly or fanatical outside a sports bar is generally more common inside of one. The intensity of cheering and jeering at a sports bar by sports fans can often range from equal to stronger than that of fans actually at the sporting event for particularly significant games and matches.

At home, sports fans may have few fellow fans but also more freedom. This is sometimes where the most intense cheering or jeering will take place. In the fan's own home, unbridled and lengthy screaming, crying, acts of destruction to household objects, and other manifestations of joy or anguish, are perhaps seen as most acceptable in comparison to the sports bar or sporting venue simply because such acts taken to such an extreme can be seen as disruptive to a large number of fellow fans even if they share the same sentiment if it is of less intensity. The greatest variables of the reaction of a sports fan in their own home are the intensity of the fan's desire to see their team win or perform well, and the presence of another: often a wife, children, or friends who may be significantly less ardent sports fans or not sports fans at all, which may significantly temper the fan's reaction to a highly positive or negative moment due to the fear of causing a scene or scaring those close to the fan, or alienating themselves from said others. Often sports fans will invite other fans of relatively similar rooting intensity over to their house to experience a sporting event together so that all involved can voice pleasure or displeasure to their heart's content and increase [[male bonding|shared bonds]] in the process. It is becoming common for this type of bonding to take place over sports-related [[social networks]] like eFans.

==Fan psychology and motives==

===Sports===
[[File:Fan de hockey 01.jpg|thumbnail|Representation of a hockey fan]]
The drivers that make people fans, and in particular sports fans, have been studied by psychologists, such as Dan Wann at [[Murray State University]],&lt;ref name="wann"&gt;{{cite book |last=Wann |first=Daniel L. |title=Sport Fans: The Psychology and Social Impact of Spectators |publisher=Routledge |date=January 10, 2001 |isbn=978-0415924641}}&lt;/ref&gt; and communication scholars, such as [[Adam Earnheardt]] at [[Youngstown State University]].&lt;ref name="earnheardt1"&gt;{{cite book |last=Earnheardt |first=Adam C. |authorlink1=Adam Earnheardt |title=Judging Athlete Behaviors: Exploring Possible Predictors of Television Viewer Judgments of Athlete Antisocial Behaviors |publisher=AV Akademikerverlag |date=June 28, 2012 |isbn=978-3639433456}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="earnheardt2"&gt;{{cite book |editor-last1=Earnheardt |editor-first1=Adam C. |editor-last2=Haridakis |editor-first2=Paul M. |editor-last3=Hugenberg |editor-first3=Barbara |title=Sports Fans, Identity, and Socialization: Exploring the Fandemonium |publisher=Lexington Books |date=May 30, 2013 |isbn=978-0739146217}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They attribute people becoming fans to the following factors:&lt;ref name=Conrad&gt;{{cite book|title=The Business of Sports: A Primer for Journalists|author=Mark Conrad|chapter=What Makes Sports a Unique Business?|pages=xxx–xxxi|year=2006|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-8058-5044-9|nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; One element is entertainment, because sports spectatorship is a form of leisure. Sports is also a form of escapism, and being a fan gives one an excuse to yell at something, an activity that may be constrained in other areas of one's life. Fan activities give participants a combination of euphoria and stress (about the potential for their team to lose) for which they coin the name "eustress". Fans experience euphoria during moments when play is going well for their team, and stress when play is going against their team. This tension between the two emotions generates an unusual sense of pleasure or heightened sensations.&lt;ref name="motives"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Earnheardt |first1=Adam C. |last2=Haridakis |first2=Paul M. |editor-last1=Hugenberg |editor-first1=Lawrence W. |editor-last2=Haridakis |editor-first2=Paul M. |editor-last3=Earnheardt |editor-first3=Adam C. |title=Sports Mania: Essays on Fandom and the Media in the 21st Century |publisher=MacFarland |date=July 16, 2008 |pages=158–171 |chapter=Exploring Motives and Fandom for Viewing Televised Sports |isbn=978-0786437269}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aesthetics are another draw for some fans, who appreciate the precision or skill of play, or of the coordinated movement of the players during a pre-planned "play".&lt;ref name="motives" /&gt; Family bonding is a reason for some fan activities. Some families watch televised sports on a regular basis and go to sports games as a family outing to watch events and form a [[human bonding|psychological bond]] with one another and as a family. Going to sports events can create a borrowed sense of self-esteem if fans identify with their teams to the extent that they consider themselves to be successful when their teams have been successful (e.g., as seen in the phrase "we have won").&lt;ref name="motives" /&gt; If a fan identifies strongly with a favorite team, they will respond to the performance of the team as if team success were a personal success and team failure a personal failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lynn R. Kahle |author2=Angeline G. Close |title=Consumer Behavior Knowledge for Effective Sports and Event Marketing|year=2011|location=New York|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0-415-87358-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Loyalty===
{{Main|Fan loyalty}}
'''Fan loyalty''' is the loyalty felt and expressed by a fan towards the object of his/her fanaticism. Allegiances can be strong or weak. The loyalties of sports fans have been studied by psychologists and have often been reviewed.

Fangirls and fanboys in fandoms sometimes, with various meanings, consider their fandom to be their "family," and feel very loyal to it, usually.

==="Stan" fans===
A '''stan''' is a particularly (perhaps excessively) avid fan and supporter of a [[celebrity]], TV show, group, or a film or film series. The object of the stan's affection is often called their "fave". Based on the 2000 song "[[Stan (song)|Stan]]" by American rapper [[Eminem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Keeffe|first1=Kevin|title=Directioners, Arianators, Mixers, the Skeleton Clique, Katy Cats, Oh My: Stanbase Names, Ranked|url=http://www.thewire.com/entertainment/2014/08/from-directioners-to-arianators-stanbases-ranked/378941/|accessdate=December 19, 2014|work=The Atlantic|date=August 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the term has frequently been used to describe artist devotees whose fanaticism matches the severity of the obsessive character in the song. The word has been described as a blend of "stalker" and "fan".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.bustle.com/articles/94986-what-does-stan-mean-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-slang-term |title=What Does "Stan" Mean?

====Usage====
{{main|List of fandom nicknames}}
Colloquially, the term can be used as both a [[noun]] or a [[verb]].&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; Stans of a particular singer are often given more detailed names, such as "Arianators" for fans of [[Ariana Grande]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/may/24/arianators-assemble-ariana-grandes-fans-weave-a-web-of-support|title=Arianators assemble: Ariana Grande’s fans weave a web of support|last=Sullivan|first=Caroline|date=2017-05-24|work=The Guardian|access-date=2017-06-12|language=en-GB|issn=0261-3077}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metro.co.uk/2017/05/25/ariana-grande-fans-are-grieving-together-and-their-strength-is-beautiful-6662430/|title=Ariana Grande fans are grieving together and their strength is beautiful|last=Leaver|first=Kate|date=2017-05-25|website=Metro|access-date=2017-06-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; and "[[Belieber]]" for fans of [[Justin Bieber]]. Some artists, however, do not have specific titles attributed to their stans; fans of [[Kylie Minogue]] have been called Kylie Stans.&lt;ref name="popdust"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://popdust.com/2012/08/21/daily-tweetcap-lady-gaga-stans-for-kylie-minogue/|title=Daily Tweetcap: Lady Gaga Stans For Kylie Minogue|last=Martin|first=Samantha|work=Pop Dust|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Anitai|first=Tamar|title=12 Unforgettable Moments In VMA History: Live Snakes, Baby Bumps, Meat Dresses, Oh My!|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2012/08/27/most-unforgettable-vma-moments-poll/|work=[[MTV|MTV Buzzworthy]]|publisher=[[Viacom]]|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even for fandoms with specific titles, the "artist stan" formula still applies.&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt;

====Prevalence====
Some of these monikers are almost universally known and used by fans of the artists as well as outsiders. Other nicknames are not commonly used, neither by outsiders nor by the concerning fan-base, such as [[Kylie Minogue]]'s so called "Kylie Stans", [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]]'s so called "Madonna Fans" [[Maroon 5]]'s so called "Maroon 5 Stans" or [[Nick Jonas]]'s so called "Nick Jonas Fans" usually appearing on [[social media]] networks such as Twitter and [[Tumblr]],&lt;ref name=nytimes/&gt; The term "stan" is also used to describe fans of K-pop. The term is not to be confused with Sasaeng fans, which are overly obsessed fans who stalk and sometimes bring harm to idols. Stans, however, are merely highly dedicated fans.

The term was added to the ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/article/40129462/stan-an-eminem-song-from-2000-is-now-in-the-oxford-english-dictionary |title=Stan, an Eminem song from 2000, is now in the Oxford English Dictionary |work=BBC News |publisher=BBC |date=June 2, 2017 |accessdate=June 2, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Celebrity reaction====
Celebrities have positively reacted to their "stan" followings. Notably, English singer-songwriter [[Jessie J]] had this to say about her stans, "They support me and buy my albums and singles, and they stand outside hotels, and they come to shows, and they get tattoos of my lyrics and they cut their hair like me. You have to love your fans. That's why I call them my Heartbeats, because without them I wouldn't be here".&lt;ref name=jessiej&gt;{{cite web|last=Anitai|first=Tamar|title=Jessie J Talks 'Domino,' Dedicates Her VMA Performance To The Heartbeats|url=http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2011/08/27/jessie-j-domino-vma-performance/|work=MTV News|publisher=Viacom|accessdate=11 September 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120705021521/http://buzzworthy.mtv.com/2011/08/27/jessie-j-domino-vma-performance/|archivedate=5 July 2012|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, a stan for Jessie J broke her leg to emulate her own leg injury. The fan tracked down Jessie J's personal address and sent her a photograph of the self-inflicted injury. The singer was horrified and decided to increase her security.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sciarretto|first=Amy|title=Jessie J Increases Security After Fan Breaks Leg to Be Like Her|url=http://popcrush.com/jessie-j-security-fan-break-leg/|work=Pop Crush|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tinny|first=Aaron|title=Jessie J fan: I broke my own leg to be like you – Star's stalker hell|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/thevoice/4230715/Jessie-fan-I-broke-my-own-leg-to-be-like-you.html|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|publisher=[[News International]]|accessdate=11 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Singer-songwriter [[Lorde]] has a different opinion on the matter of giving her followers a nickname. She discouraged it by saying "I find it grating to lump everyone into a really awkward, pun-centric name" and affirmed she will never name her fanbase.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mtv.com/news/1720322/lorde-fan-names/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender stereotypes==

===Fanboy===
[[File:Union Berlin Fan.JPG|thumb|upright|Young [[1. FC Union Berlin]] supporter]]

Fanboys are frequently portrayed as "angry nerds", over-aggressive, derogatory, and protective of the object of their obsession,&lt;ref name="verge"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.theverge.com/2014/1/21/5307992/inside-the-mind-of-a-fanboy |title=Fanboys |publisher=The Verge |date=2014-01-24 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; or as bespectacled, geekoid, obsessive male fans. The term nerd, defined as "[an] insignificant, foolish, or socially inept person; a person who is boringly conventional or studious; a person who pursues an unfashionable or highly technical interest with obsessive or exclusive dedication,"&lt;ref&gt;"nerd, n." ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the term geek, defined as "[a] person […] who is regarded as foolish, offensive, worthless; an overly diligent, unsociable student; any unsociable person obsessively devoted to a particular pursuit,"&lt;ref&gt;"geek, n." ''OED Online''. Oxford University Press, September 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; are often used to describe stereotypical fanboys. In regards to chosen fandoms, they are typically associated with comic books, video games, science fiction movies or television series, or technology (such as computer or smartphone brands).&lt;ref name="verge" /&gt;

An exception to this portrayal is the sports fan, who is expected to be overtly sexual, and aggressive.&lt;ref name="sports"&gt;Gosling, Victoria K. "Girls Allowed? The Marginalization of Female Sports Fans." Eds. Gray, Jonathan, et al. ''Fandom: Identities and Communities in a Mediated World.'' New York: New York University Press, 2007. Print. 250-260.&lt;/ref&gt; This portrayal is particularly dominant within the sports arena, which provides a legitimate site for men to act in hyper masculinized ways.&lt;ref name="sports" /&gt; According to Williams, "Many [men] want to be overtly sexist and racist. They need to have this exaggerated sense of their sexuality to defend themselves from potential accusations that they are not real men."&lt;ref&gt;Coddington, A. ''One of the Lads: Women who Follow Football.'' London: Harper Collins, 1997. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Societal gender roles====

According to [[Jackson Katz]] in the documentary ''Tough Guise 2'', boys are taught early on that to be "real men" they need to be tough and not to show their feelings.&lt;ref name="TG2"&gt;''Tough Guise 2.'' Writ./Dir. Jackson Katz and Jeremy Earp. Media Education Foundation Production, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;[Men] can't show any emotion except anger. We can't think too much or seem too intellectual. We can't back down when someone disrespects us. We have to show we're tough enough to inflict physical pain and take it in turn. We're supposed to be sexually aggressive with women. And then we're taught that if we step out of this box, we risk being seen as soft, weak, feminine, or gay.&lt;ref name="TG2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He later elaborates, stating that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;Qualities like compassion, caring, empathy, intellectual curiosity, fear, vulnerability, even love – basic human qualities that boys have inside them every bit as much as girls do – get methodically driven out of them by a sexist and homophobic culture that labels these things as 'unmanly,' 'feminine,' 'womanly,' and 'gay,' and teaches boys to avoid them at all costs.

And, most importantly, they're taught that real men turn to violence not as a last resort, but as the go-to method of resolving disputes – and also as a primary means of winning respect and establishing masculine credibility.&lt;ref name="TG2" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the predecessor to this documentary, ''Tough Guise'', Katz also addresses the issue of body image, using multiple movies, such as ''[[The Terminator|Terminator]]'' and ''[[Rambo (film series)|Rambo]]'', as well as action figures like [[GI Joe]], to illustrate how 'real men' are defined as big, strong, and muscular.&lt;ref&gt;''Tough Guise.'' Writ. Jackson Katz. Dir. Sut Jhally. Media Education Foundation 
Production, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fanboy portrayals, by definition, do not fit into this mold of a 'real man', with the exception of sports fans. In a study by Gerard Jones on comic book fans, he described the comic book fanboys as "small, anxious, withdrawn, and terrified of the opposite sex."&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Gerard. Men of Tomorrow: Geeks, Gangsters, and the Birth of the Comic Book. New York: Basic Books, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Quite the opposite of the 'real man' previously described by Katz. Their interests may also be considered as a deviation from societal gender roles, according to Noah Berlastsky, such as playing ''[[Dungeons and Dragons]]'' instead of football.&lt;ref name="bully"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theatlantic.com/sexes/archive/2013/01/why-geeks-get-bullied-its-not-necessarily-for-being-geeks/272723/2/ |title=Why Geeks Get Bullied (It's Not Necessarily for Being Geeks) |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2013-01-31 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This lack of traditional masculine traits warrants them much teasing from peers, parental figures, coaches, or older male role models for not conforming to these ideas of masculinity.&lt;ref name="TG2" /&gt;&lt;ref name="bully" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pustz, Matthew. ''Comic Book Culture: Fanboys and True Believers.'' Jackson: University Press of Mississippi, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; A popular example of such treatment in mainstream media is shown on the sitcom ''[[The Big Bang Theory]]'', where, multiple times throughout the show's run, the four main characters, portrayed as 'nerdy fanboys', are humiliated by larger 'real men'. For instance, in the show pilot, the two main characters, Leonard and Sheldon, get their pants taken by the main female character's ex-boyfriend, who is portrayed as big, strong, tough, confident, and successful with women.&lt;ref&gt;"Pilot." ''The Big Bang Theory.'' Writ. Chuck Lorre and Bill Prady. Dir. James Burrows. Chuck Lorre Productions. Warner Bros. Television, California, USA. 24 Sept. 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, fanboys also deal with issues of gender discrimination in relation to their fandom interests. For example, [[Bronies]], a group of young men enthralled by the TV show ''[[My Little Pony: Friendship Is Magic]]'', a show typically geared towards young girls, are often the target of ridicule. Their interest in a 'feminine' media item can be the cause of great shame, causing many to become 'private' bronies, enjoying the show in secret out of fear.&lt;ref name="bronies"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HV0lDp3I58I |title=BABScon 2014 - Bronies; An Analysis of Fandom and Gender |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-04-26 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Violence====
{{see also|Crowd abuse|:Category:Association football hooliganism}}
Fanboys are often portrayed as quite angry, violent, and offensive while defending the objects of their affection, such as the smartphone fanboys who frequently verbally attack anybody saying anything the slightest bit offensive about their chosen technological product through online anonymous sites.&lt;ref name="verge" /&gt; In fact, the term 'fanboy' is often used as an insult towards other fans, deemed unreasonable, arrogant, or overly loyal to their chosen token of affection.{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}

Such defensiveness is particularly prominent against women who are interested in their chosen fandoms or who pose a "threat" to their community. For example, in 2012, male gamers created a Flash game in which players could physically assault [[Anita Sarkeesian]], a woman who launched a Kickstarter to create a series of documentaries on women tropes in video games.&lt;ref name="fridge"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journal.transformativeworks.org/index.php/twc/article/view/460/384 |title=Fangirls in refrigerators: The politics of (in)visibility in comic book culture &amp;#124; Scott &amp;#124; Transformative Works and Cultures |publisher=Journal.transformativeworks.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These violent acts against Sarkeesian continued in 2014, during the controversial event or movement known as [[GamerGate]], during which Sarkeesian received numerous threats by fanboys due to her Tropes vs Women series on YouTube, where she analyzes the alleged limited and sexist female roles available in video games. These threats escalated dangerously, requiring her to leave her home in fear for her safety, as well as cancel a speaking engagement at Utah State University after there were threats of a mass shooting on campus due to her presence.&lt;ref name="anita"&gt;{{cite web|last=Collins |first=Sean T. |url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/features/anita-sarkeesian-gamergate-interview-20141017 |title=Anita Sarkeesian on GamerGate: 'We're Going to Fix This' |publisher=Rolling Stone |date=2014-10-17 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such discriminatory acts of violence towards women are not isolated cases. For instance, male comic book fans frequently harass women frequenting comic book shops, either by demeaning them or by hitting on them, causing them to feel uncomfortable and excluded from the fan community.&lt;ref name="fridge" /&gt;&lt;ref name="geek"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5UohmGU-Gng |title=If Geek Girls Acted Like Geek Guys |publisher=YouTube |date=2014-08-25 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="comic"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gingerhaze.tumblr.com/post/76241121783/oh-i-know-i-have-it-better-than-a-lot-of-would-be |title=How Are You I'm Fine Thanks |publisher=Gingerhaze.tumblr.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fangirl===

Fangirls are often portrayed as teenagers obsessed with something to a frightening degree. The term is often used in a demeaning, derogatory fashion to describe the fans that give "normal" fans a bad name. In fact, the term "fangirling" is used to describe anyone who obsessively follows a certain [[fandom]] to the point where it interferes with their daily lives. Such a trend of 'authentic' versus 'inauthentic' fan is common within fan communities, and is particularly pertinent to gender discrimination and misogynistic ideals.&lt;ref name="fridge" /&gt; However, on the other hand of the spectrum, some fangirls have embraced the title, considering it a compliment rather than a derogatory term.

====Discrimination====
Women tend to be "more restricted in their leisure choices and opportunities than men,"&lt;ref name="sports" /&gt; and their experiences within fandoms are typically demeaned to a more sexualized, emotional, or bodily experience, as opposed to intellectual interests.&lt;ref name="groupies"&gt;Cline, Cheryl.

''Sociology'': 38 (3), 2004. 477-493.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in music, women are more predominant, and accepted, within pop music fandoms, which Diane Railton describes as evoking an emotional and physical response, in contrast with the 'masculine' rock music, which is defined as 'serious' music with a 'meaning', focusing on political, cultural, and psychological discussion.&lt;ref name="music" /&gt; Due to this, women are rarely given space or voice within the intellectual realm of music.&lt;ref name="music" /&gt; According to [[Frank Zappa]], "men come to hear the music and chicks come for the sex thrills,"&lt;ref&gt;Hiwatt, S. "Cock rock." ''Twenty-Minute Fandangos and Forever Changes: A Rock Bazaar.'' Ed. J. Eisen. New York: 1971. 141-7.&lt;/ref&gt; implying that women's involvement in fan communities is purely sexual, and that they are incapable of displaying intellectual or artistic interest in the music itself.&lt;ref name="music" /&gt; Those who do manage to become involved within the world of 'serious' music are often relegated to the realm of a 'groupie'.&lt;ref name="groupies" /&gt; A groupie, according to Cheryl Cline, is

&lt;blockquote&gt;[A] person (a woman, usually), who 'chases after' rock stars, as my mother would say. But 'groupie' is also used more or less synonymously with 'girl Rock fan', 'female journalist', and 'woman Rock musician'; it's used to mean anyone working in the music field who isn't actually a Rock musician; it's used as an all-purpose insult and a slut on one's professionalism; it's used as a cute term for 'hero worship'; and it's used interchangeably with 'fan'.&lt;ref name="groupies" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In other words, the term 'groupie' (used synonymously with the term 'fan' or 'fangirl') is frequently used to shame women involved within the music community, restricting their involvement to sexual relations with band members or worshipping male rock stars.&lt;ref name="groupies" /&gt;

This trend can also be observed within other fan communities, such as comic book fandoms, where women are frequently portrayed as "Fake Geek Girls", only interested in comic books to impress guys or to view the attractive men present within their content,&lt;ref name="geek" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Gavia Baker-Whitelaw |url=http://www.dailydot.com/geek/fake-geek-girls-geek-guys-buzzfeed/ |title=The absurdity of this 'fake geek guys' video makes a powerful point |publisher=The Daily Dot |date=2014-08-27 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; or sports communities, where women are often made uncomfortable at live sporting events due to the overt sexism and aggressive masculinity displayed by male spectators, and then labelled as 'inauthentic' for viewing the games via television instead.&lt;ref name="sports" /&gt; Within hockey, female fans are often called "Puck Bunnies", defined as,

&lt;blockquote&gt;[S]omeone who hangs around the players, always on the lookout for the chance to get that autograph / photograph / quick pint [drink] / quick knee trem-bler round the back of the Arena from the player or players (or even coach) of their choice, heck let's face it even the water carrier is in with a chance here.&lt;ref name="hockey" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Such discrimination against female fans can become violent at times in an effort to police "authenticity".&lt;ref name="fridge" /&gt; The recent events known as [[GamerGate]] provide a good example of such attacks, whereby multiple women working within the gaming industry were victims of sexual harassment and violent threats, some even forced to leave their homes for fear of a physical confrontation.&lt;ref name="anita" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/technology-29821050 |title=Zoe Quinn: GamerGate must be condemned - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2014-10-29 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Peter Frase|url=https://www.jacobinmag.com/2014/10/in-defense-of-gamers/ |title=In Defense of Gamers |publisher=Jacobin |date=2014-10-04 |accessdate=2016-09-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Conduct and age====

In terms of their involvement within fandoms, fangirls are typically portrayed as losing all control, fainting, sobbing, and dashing about in mobs.&lt;ref name="beatles"&gt;Ehrenreich, Barbara, Elizabeth Hess, and Gloria Jacobs. "Beatlemania: Girls Just Want to Have Fun." Ed. Lewis, Lisa A. ''The Adoring Audience: Fan Culture and Popular Media.'' New York; London: Routledge, 1992. Print. 84-106.&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, while describing the phenomenon of Beatlemania, fan activity is described by stating that: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;The appropriate reaction to contact with [the Beatles] – such as occupying the same auditorium or city block – was to sob uncontrollably while screaming, 'I'm gonna die, I'm gonna die,' or, more optimistically, the name of a favorite Beatle, until the onset of either unconsciousness or laryngitis. Girls peed in their pants, fainted, or simply collapsed from the emotional strain.&lt;ref name="beatles" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fangirls' so-called 'hysteria' is described as the product of sexual repression.&lt;ref name="beatles" /&gt; However, while it is expected for women to be involved in certain fandoms for physical or sexual reasons, this is also viewed as undesirable and driven by hormonal changes.

These acts of adoration are societally limited to adolescent youth, or menopausal women, in both instances blaming "these two periods of hormonal lunacy" on the irrational, overtly sexual behaviour.&lt;ref name="groupies" /&gt; For instance, Cheryl Cline, in her text entitled "Essays from Bitch: The Women's Rock Newsletter with Bite", discusses how women need to keep their interests hidden once they pass adolescence.&lt;ref name="groupies" /&gt; In her own words, "[i]t's a sign of maturity to pack up all the posters, photos, magazines, scrapbooks, and unauthorized biographies you so lovingly collected and shove them in the back of the closet.&lt;ref name="groupies" /&gt; Furthermore, while discussing Beatlemania and the crazed Beatles fangirl behaviour, Barbara Ehrenreich, Elizabeth Heiss, and Gloria Jacobs mention how the 'only cure' for what was at the time considered an affliction was age, and that similarly to "the girls who had screamed for Frank Sinatra," the Beatles fangirls would "[grow] up to be responsible, settled housewives."&lt;ref name="beatles" /&gt;

These conflicting accounts of fangirl behaviour are due to the belief that women are not supposed to express such sexual fantasies unless influenced by some hormonal induced craziness, while for men it is normal to be sexual regardless of age.&lt;ref name="groupies" /&gt; As Cheryl Cline summarizes, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;It's much easier for a man to be indulgent about the crushes of teenage girls than it is for him to be fair-minded about the sexual fantasies of the woman he loves when they're about someone else. And the same guy who'll leave ''Penthouse'' in the bathroom will yell, 'No woman of mine is gonna hang a poster of Prince naked to the waist on the inside of the closet of the spare room where no one will see it!' […] [U]ntil you reach the age when everybody thinks you're crazy anyway, so why not admit to an intense hankering to run your fingers through Willie Nelson's whiskers?&lt;ref name="groupies" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Saints Gervasius and Protasius''' (also '''Saints Gervase and Protase''', '''Gervasis and Prothasis''' and in [[French (language)|French]] ''Gervais and Protais'') are venerated as [[Christian martyrs]], probably of the 2nd century. They are the [[patron saints]] of [[Milan]] and of [[hay]]makers and are invoked for the discovery of thieves. Their [[feast day]] in the Latin Rite of the [[Catholic Church]] is 19 June, the day marking the [[translation (relics)|translation]] of their relics. In the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and in the Eastern Rites of the [[Catholic Church]], their feast takes place on 14 October ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|O.S.]])/24 October ([[Adoption of the Gregorian calendar#Adoption in Eastern Europe|N.S.]]), the traditional day of their death. In Christian [[iconography]] their emblems are the scourge, the club and the sword.

==Legend==
The ''[[Acta Sanctorum|acta]]''&lt;ref&gt;"Acta Sanctorum" June, IV, 680 and 29.&lt;/ref&gt; may have been expanded from a letter (''Epistle'' liii) to the bishops of [[Italy]], falsely ascribed to [[Saint Ambrose]]. They are written in a very simple style; it has not been possible to establish the date of their composition. According to these, Gervasius and Protasius were the twin sons of martyrs. Their father, [[Vitalis of Milan|Saint Vitalis of Milan]], a man of consular dignity, suffered martyrdom at [[Ravenna]], possibly under [[Nero]]. Their mother, [[Saint Valeria]], died for her faith at Milan. Gervasius and Protasius were imprisoned, and visited in prison by [[Nazarius and Celsus|Saint Nazarius]].

The sons are said to have large hands and had been scourged and then beheaded, during the reign of the Emperor [[Nero]], under the presidency of Anubinus or Astasius, and while Caius was [[Bishop of Milan]]. Some authors place the martyrdom under the Emperor [[Diocletian]], but others object to this time, because it is not clear how, in that case, the place of burial, and even the names, could be forgotten by the time of Saint Ambrose, as is stated. It probably occurred during the reign of Emperor [[Marcus Aurelius]] (161-180).&lt;ref name=mershman&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06537a.htm Mershman, Francis. "Sts. Gervasius and Protasius." The Catholic Encyclopedia. Vol. 6. New York: Robert Appleton Company, 1909. 24 Jan. 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ambrose and Saints Gervasius and Protasius==
[[Image:Philippe de Champaigne SS Gervase and Protase.jpg|thumb|left|Gervasius and Protasius, by [[Philippe de Champaigne]]]] 
[[Saint Ambrose]], in 386, had built a magnificent [[basilica]] at Milan, now called the [[Basilica Sant'Ambrogio]]. Asked by the people to consecrate it in the same solemn manner as was done in [[Rome]], he promised to do so if he could obtain the necessary relics. In a dream, he was shown the place where such relics could be found. He ordered excavations to be made outside the city, in the cemetery Church of [[Nabor and Felix|Saints Nabor and Felix]], who were at the time the primary patrons of Milan, and there found the relics of Saints Gervasius and Protasius. In a letter, St Ambrose wrote: ''"I found the fitting signs, and on bringing in some on whom hands were to be laid, the power of the holy martyrs became so manifest, that even whilst I was still silent, one was seized and thrown prostrate at the holy burial-place. We found two men of marvelous stature, such as those of ancient days. All the bones were perfect, and there was much blood."''&lt;ref&gt;[http://urban.hunter.cuny.edu/~thead/gervase.htm Letter of St. Ambrose of Milan on the discovery of the Relics of Sts. Gervasius and Protasius] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516012528/http://urban.hunter.cuny.edu/~thead/gervase.htm |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

St Ambrose had their relics removed to the Basilica of Fausta (now the Church of [[Saints Vitalis and Agricola]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://urban.hunter.cuny.edu/~thead/gervase.htm Letter of Ambrose of Milan on the&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080516012528/http://urban.hunter.cuny.edu/~thead/gervase.htm |date=2008-05-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the next day into the basilica, accompanied in the texts by many miracles, emblematic of divine favor in the context of the great struggle then taking place between St Ambrose and the [[Arianism|Arian]] Empress [[Justina (empress)|Justina]].&lt;ref&gt;D. H. Williams, "Ambrose of Milan and the End of the Arian-Nicene Conflicts," Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1995 discusses the "inventio" and "depositio" of the relics as thecrowning gesture of Ambrose's triumph over the Arians.&lt;/ref&gt; Of the vision, the subsequent discovery of the relics and the accompanying miracles, St Ambrose wrote to his sister Marcellina.

[[Saint Augustine]], not yet baptized, witnessed these facts, and relates them in his ''"Confessions"'' (IX, vii), and in ''"De Civitate Dei"'' (XXII, viii) as well as in his ''"Sermon 286 in natal. Ss. Mm. Gerv. et Prot."''. They are also attested by [[Paulinus of Nola|Saint Paulinus]] in his life of Saint Ambrose. The latter died in 397 and by his own wish was buried in his basilica by the side of these martyrs.&lt;ref name=mershman/&gt; It has been suggested that the [[Brescia Casket]] was made for or used to hold the relics.

==Veneration==
[[Image:Sant'Ambrogio Cript in Basilica of Sant'Ambrogio, Milan.jpg|thumb|left|The crypt in [[Basilica Sant'Ambrogio|Sant'Ambrogio]] basilica. Embossed silver urn, displaying the skeletons of [[Saint Ambrose|Saints Ambrose]], Gervase, and Protase.]]
J. Rendel Harris, in ''"The Dioscuri in the Christian Legends"'' (London, 1903), addressed the subject of twin saints in Christian legend, who seem to be connected with the [[Dioscuri]], whose cult was tenacious, surmised from an oration decrying their veneration by [[Dio Chrystostom]] (''"Orations"'' 61.11). The historicity of Gervasius and Protasius was defended in the ''"Analecta Bollandist."'' (1904), XXIII, 427.&lt;ref name=mershman/&gt;

Immediately after the discovery of the relics by Saint Ambrose, the [[Cult (religious practice)|cult]] of Saints Gervasius and Protasius was spread in Italy, and churches were built in their honor at [[Pavia]], [[Nola]] and other places. In [[Gaul]] (modern-day [[France]]), about 400{{citation needed|date=November 2015}} churches were dedicated to them, at [[Le Mans|Mans]], [[Rouen]] and [[Soissons]]. At the [[Louvre]] in [[Paris]], there is now a famous picture of the saints by [[Eustache Le Sueur|Lesueur]] (d. 1655), which was formerly in their church at [[Paris]]. According to the ''"[[Liber Pontificalis]],"'' [[Pope Innocent I]] (402-417) dedicated a church to them at Rome. Later, the name of [[Vitalis of Milan|St Vitalis]], their father, was added to the title of this church ([[Basilica of San Vitale (Rome)|Basilica of San Vitale]]). Very early on, their names were inserted into the [[Litany of the Saints]].

In 835, Angilbert II, [[Bishop of Milan]], placed the relics of the three saints in a [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] [[sarcophagus]], where they were found in January 1864.&lt;ref&gt;''Civiltà Cattolica'', 1864, IX, 608, and XII, 345&lt;/ref&gt;

A tradition claims that, after the destruction of Milan by [[Frederick Barbarossa]], his chancellor, [[Rainald of Dassel]], had taken the relics from Milan and deposited them at [[Breisach]] in [[Germany]], whence some came to [[Soissons]]. The claim is rejected by Milan.&lt;ref&gt;Biraghi, ''Civiltà Cattolica'', 1864, IX, 608, and XII, 345.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, they were [[venerated]] by farmers in Germany and a German saying amongst harvesters was: ''"Wenn's regnet auf Gervasius / es vierzig Tage regnen muss"'' (''"When it rains on St Gervasius' Day / forty days of rain will follow"'').&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heiligenlexikon.de/BiographienG/Gervasius.htm Gervasius - Ökumenisches Heiligenlexikon&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, as with the cults of [[Swithun|Saint Swithun]], [[Saint Medard]], the [[Seven Sleepers]], and [[Saint Godelieve]], that of Sts Gervasius and Protasius was connected with the weather.

A famous series of [[tapestry|tapestries]] of the ''"Life of Gervasius and Protasius,"'' donated to the [[Cathedral of Our Lady (Antwerp)|Cathedral of Antwerp]] in 1509, is displayed in the cathedral's choir.&lt;ref&gt;Laura Weigert, "Reconstructing Medieval Pictorial Narrative: Louis Joubert's Tapestry Restoration Project" ''Art Journal'' '''54'''.2, Conservation and Art History, Summer 1995:67-72.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Thomas Henry Gartside Neville''' (20 June 1837 – 19 June 1910) was an English actor, dramatist, teacher and [[Actor-manager|theatre manager]]. He began his career playing dashing juvenile leads, later specialising in Shakespearean roles, modern comedy and melodrama.  His most famous role was as Bob Brierley in [[Tom Taylor]]'s ''[[The Ticket-of-Leave Man (play)|The Ticket-of-Leave Man]]''.  As the manager of the [[Olympic Theatre]] from 1873 to 1879, he presented numerous successful productions.  In later years, he became a respected character actor.

==Biography==

===Early years===
Neville was born in [[Manchester]], England, son of John Garside Neville and his second wife Mary Anna, ''née'' Gartside (died 1895).&lt;ref name=who&gt;[http://www.ukwhoswho.com/view/article/oupww/whowaswho/U189379 "Neville, Thomas Henry Gartside (Henry Neville)",] ''Who Was Who'', A &amp; C Black, 1920–2008, online edn, Oxford University Press, December 2007, accessed 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; He was the twentieth child of his father, an actor and the manager of Queen's Theatre, Spring Gardens, Manchester, who himself was the twentieth child of ''his'' father.&lt;ref name=times&gt;''The Times'', obituary notice, 21 June 1910, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; Though Neville senior was in the theatre, there were strong military traditions on both sides of the family, and John Neville was opposed to his son's decision to pursue a theatrical rather than a military career and refused to help him.&lt;ref name=dnb&gt;Lawrence, W. J. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/35204  "Neville, (Thomas) Henry Gartside (1837–1910)"], rev. Nilanjana Banerji, ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, 2004, accessed 22 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;  Neville had one brother, George (born c. 1839), one sister, Josaphine (c. 1838–1895), and nineteen half-brothers and sisters.&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Barry.

From 1857 to 1860 Neville acted in the English provinces and Scotland. When the tragedian John Vandenhoff made his farewell performance in 1858 at the Theatre Royal, [[Liverpool]], Neville played Cromwell to Vandenhoff's Wolsey in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Henry VIII (play)|King Henry VIII]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; He made his London debut in 1860 as Percy Ardent in [[Dion Boucicault]]'s ''The Irish Heiress'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]]. ''[[The Observer]]'' said of his performance: "Mr Henry Neville, a new importation from Liverpool, was gentlemanly and easy, of good manners and dashing appearance; and he promises to fill a dreary gap in the London theatrical world – the line of ''jeunes premières''."&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 14 October 1860, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; He attracted further good notices for his next role, in ''The Love Chase'', receiving encouragement from ''The Times'' "as a representative of young men of something like rank and position."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 20 October 1860, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  The same year, he played Victor Savignie in ''Arrienne'' at the Lyceum and, at the [[Olympic Theatre]], he played Ivan in ''Serf'' and Valjean in an adaptation of ''[[Les Miserables]]''.&lt;ref name=perfs&gt;Collins, Barry. [http://users.zoominternet.net/~bcollins/preview_198.htm "Thomas Henry Gartside Neville Performances"], Gartside–Neville family website, 2007, accessed 25 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1863, still at the Olympic, Neville created the role of Bob Brierley in [[Tom Taylor]]'s drama about the dismal life of a released convict, ''[[The Ticket-of-Leave Man (play)|The Ticket-of-Leave Man]]'', a character in which he made the success of his career.  He played in its long first run and revivals for a total of about 2000 performances.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt; In 1865, he played the title role in Taylor's ''Henry Dunbar'' at the Olympic opposite [[Kate Terry]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 21 November 1877, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and in 1867 was her chosen Romeo to her Juliet in her farewell London performances at the [[Adelphi Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 2 September 1867, p. 7&lt;/ref&gt;  1867 had been a busy year for Neville at the Adelphi, where he played Job Arnroyd in ''Lost in London'', Benedick in ''[[Much Ado About Nothing]]'', Dunbar again, Farmer Allan in ''Dora'', Richard Watt in ''His First Champagne'', Claude Meinotee in ''Lady of Lyons'', Walter Maidenblush in ''Little Treasure'', Sir Thomas Clifford in ''Hunchback'', and George Vendale in ''[[No Thoroughfare]]'', another notable success.&lt;ref name=perfs/&gt; The next year at the Adelphi, he played the title role in ''[[Hamlet]]'' and repeated Robert Brierley.  In 1869, still at the Adelphi, he portrayed the role of Vernon Wainwright in ''Eve''.&lt;ref name=perfs/&gt;  At the [[Gaiety Theatre, London|Gaiety Theatre]] in the same year, he played an important role in [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s early comedy, ''[[An Old Score]]''.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

===Actor-manager===
[[File:TicketFarrenBarrington.jpg|left|thumb|upright|1875 Revival of ''The Ticket-of-Leave Man'', starring Neville and [[Nellie Farren]]]]
Neville continued building his reputation on the London stage in the 1870s as actor and also as the manager of the Olympic Theatre from 1873 to 1879, where his company included rising actors such as [[Rutland Barrington]], [[Helen Ernstone]], [[Emily Fowler]] and [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www-unix.oit.umass.edu/~a0fs000/1800/0409.html The Olympic Theatre: Static Information - list of managers], accessed 21 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 July 1877, p. 42; and 4 September 1878, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1870, he played Henry Little in ''Put Yourself in His Place'' at the Adelphi.&lt;ref name=perfs/&gt;  In 1872 he had a great success in ''[[The School for Scandal]]'' of which ''The Times'' said, "Mr Henry Neville is the leading actor in the class of characters in which Charles Surface is comprised."&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 November 1872, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;  This was followed, at the Olympic, by ''The School for Intrigue'', in which he played the part of Almaviva.&lt;ref name=perfs/&gt;  Other successes during the 1870s, both as manager and actor, included his portrayal of Lord Clancarty in Taylor's ''Lady Clancarty'', Pierre in [[John Oxenford]]'s ''The Two Orphans'' in 1874, an 1874–75 revival of ''The Ticket-of-Leave Man'', and Franklin Blake in a dramatisation of [[Wilkie Collins]]'s ''[[The Moonstone]]'' in 1877.&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;  In the same year he produced and starred in a revival of ''Lady Audley's Secret'' by Robert Walters.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 July 1877, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  He also produced [[W. S. Gilbert]]'s plays ''[[The Ne'er-do-Weel]]'' in 1878 and  ''[[Gretchen (play)|Gretchen]]'' in 1879.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 24 March 1879, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:LONDON ILLUSTR(1877) p6.137 HENRY NEVILLE.jpg|thumbnail|Henry Neville (1877)]]
In 1878, Neville opened a successful drama school which he managed for many years.&lt;ref&gt;The ODNB gives the date as 1878, but Neville's own entry in ''Who's Who'' gives the year as 1884&lt;/ref&gt;  By the 1880s, he had become famous in [[melodrama]] roles, playing the romantic lead.  His Shakespeare roles included Jaques in ''[[As You Like It]]'', produced by Madame Modjeska (1882) and Leonato in ''Much Ado About Nothing''.  In 1888, he played Count Heidegger in ''Handsome Is that Handsome Does'', a comedy by C. J. Ribton Turner at the [[Vaudeville Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 6 June 1888, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt;  At the Olympic that year, he reprised the role Pierre in ''The Two Orphans'' and appeared in ''Hands Across the Sea'' by Henry Pettitt.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 January 1889, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later years===
In 1890, Neville went to America with [[Augustus Harris]]'s company, appearing for 200 nights as Captain Temple in ''Human Nature'', renamed ''The Soudan'' for its U.S. production. On his return to England he resumed his successful place in the autumn melodramas at the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].&lt;ref name=dnb/&gt;

The last phase of Neville's career was with [[Beerbohm Tree|Herbert Beerbohm Tree's]] company at [[Her Majesty's Theatre|His Majesty's Theatre]], where his roles included Leonato&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 January 1905, p. 10&lt;/ref&gt; and, in ''[[Richard II (play)|Richard II]]'', John of Gaunt.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 25 April 1905, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; His last engagement was in Tree's revival of ''The School for Scandal'' in 1909. By this stage in his career, Neville had moved to the role of Sir Oliver Surface, with Robert Loraine in Neville's old role as Sir Oliver's nephew, Charles. ''[[The Manchester Guardian]]'' found Neville "admirably sonorous" in the part.&lt;ref&gt;''The Manchester Guardian'', 8 April 1909. p. 7&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Observer'' wrote: "the weighty Sir Oliver of Mr Henry Neville, so well remembered as the dashing Charles Surface of thirty years ago, is exactly in tune with the quietly humorous Moses of Mr [[Lionel Brough]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Observer'', 11 April 1909. p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

Neville wrote six plays, all  melodramas. He also published some short books on the theatre, entitled ''The Stage, its Past and Present, in Relation to Fine Art''; ''Gesture; Her First Appearance''; and ''His First and Last Benefit,''&lt;ref name=who/&gt;

Neville died at [[Seaford, East Sussex|Seaford]], [[Sussex]], one day short of his 73rd birthday, of a heart attack induced by a minor accident and was buried at Christ Church in [[Denshaw]], [[Saddleworth]], [[Yorkshire]].&lt;ref name=times/&gt; He left four sons, from his marriage to Harriet Jane Waddell (c. 1837–1903).&lt;ref name=who/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Collins, Barry. [http://users.zoominternet.net/~bcollins/preview_200.htm "Thomas Henry Gartside &amp; Harriet Jane Neville Family (A)"], Gartside–Neville family website, 2007, accessed 25 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Times'' concluded its obituary notice of Neville: "He had troops of friends, and there are not two opinions as to his reputation for fair dealing with his fellow men. As well as an actor, he was a man of business, with a fund of common sense, fond of sport, and a glutton for outdoor exercise. He was well known as a [[Freemason]] and generally respected by all with whom he was associated, and beloved by those who knew him intimately."&lt;ref name=times/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4800">'''I Wayan Gobiah''' ({{circa}} 1898 – ?) was a Balinese teacher and writer. He is best known for ''[[Nemoe Karma]]'', a 1931 novel which is considered the first Balinese-language novel.

==Biography==
Little has been uncovered about Gobiah's life, despite efforts by several researchers.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=18}} However, it is known that Gobiah was born in approximately 1898 to a poor family in Panjer village, [[Badung Regency]], [[Bali]] (now part of southern [[Denpasar]]). Gobiah's father was a manservant to King Tjokorda at Denpasar Palace; the family received land on which to live from the palace in exchange for Gobiah's father's work.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=19}}

During the [[Dutch intervention in Bali (1906)|Dutch intervention in 1906]], Gobiah was tasked to accompany Prince Ida Tjokardo Alit Ngurah to exile in nearby [[Lombok]]. By order of the prince, Gobiah was schooled until the third year in a local school. After finishing his time there, he was sent to [[Singaraja]] to continue his studies in 1910.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=19}} In Singaraja, he studied to be a teacher under Mas Nitisastro; Nitisastro, who also worked as a writer, used [[Balinese language|Balinese-language]] short stories he had written to interest his students and introduce them to the world of literature.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=20}}{{sfn|Suardiana|2012|p=31}} By 1912 Gobiah was reportedly working as a teacher in Denpasar, at the age of 14.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=20}}

While working as a teacher, Gobiah developed an interest in theatre, including traditional dance and singing. By 1919 he was working as the principal of an elementary school in Mengwi, Badung.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=20}} While in Mengwi, he married Si Luh Rupek; together the couple had one child. However, not long after the birth of their child, Si Luh Rupek fell ill and died. She was followed by their child several years later.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=21}}

Alone again, Gobiah began reading heavily. Through his school and contacts with Mas Nitisastro, he subscribed to [[Balai Pustaka]]-published periodicals such as ''[[Pandji Poestaka]]'' and ''Seri Poestaka''. He also read novels, such as ''[[Sitti Nurbaya]]'' (1922), published by the state-owned publishing house.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=21}} According to Balinese literary scholars I Gusti Ngurah Bagus and I Ketut Ginarsa, this reading influenced his literary work.{{sfn|Bagus|Ginarsa|1978|p=ii}}

By 1922 Gobiah had begun rewriting traditional stories to be more accessible to his students; this was followed by translating works into Balinese.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=21}} In 1923 he published an illustrated fable entitled ''Satua Lutung Mungil'' (''A Favourite Monkey''), written with [[Balinese script]]. This was published by Balai Pustaka.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=22}}{{sfn|Marrison|1987|p=21}} ''Satua Lutung Mungil'' was followed by a retelling of Rare Angon in ''geguritan'' form in 1926. Although Gobiah is known to have received money from Balai Pustaka for this work, it is unknown if it was ultimately published. Not long afterwards he remarried.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=22}} 

Gobiah's seminal work, ''[[Nemoe Karma]]'', was published by Balai Pustaka in 1931. The first Balinese language novel, it dealt with themes of forced marriage and love.{{sfn|Putra|2010|p=22}}

'''John Milton Oskison''' (1874–1947) was a Native American author, editor and journalist. His fiction focused on the culture clash that mixed-bloods like himself faced.
&lt;ref name=stan&gt;{{cite web|title=Native American History at Stanford|publisher=Stanford University|website=Native American Cultural Center|url=http://studentaffairs.stanford.edu/nacc/history}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Oskison was born the son of John (English) and Rachel Crittendon (part-Cherokee) Oskison in Cherokee Nation. He attended [[Willie Halsell College]]&lt;ref&gt;Actually, a high school.&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Vinita, Oklahoma|Vinita]], where he met and befriended [[Will Rogers]].&lt;ref name=ok /&gt;

Oskison was an undergraduate at Stanford, where he was president of the Stanford Literary Society. He graduated in 1898, and was Stanford's first Native American graduate.&lt;ref name=stan /&gt;  He attended Harvard for graduate school. But after one year, his short story "Only the Master Shall Praise" won a competition held by ''[[The Century Magazine]]'', and he became a professional writer.&lt;ref name=edd /&gt;

He became an editorial writer for the ''[[New York Evening Post]]''. He married Florence Ballard Day in 1903. In 1904 his short story "The Greater Appeal" won the Black Cat Prize.

==Later life and career==
Oskison switched to ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'' in 1907, and became their financial editor in 1910.

Oskison served with the [[American Expeditionary Force]] in World War I. In 1920, still in France, he and his wife divorced. On his return to the U. S., Oskison married [[Hildegarde Hawthorne]], a novelist.&lt;ref name=edd /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;She was a granddaughter of [[Nathaniel Hawthorne]]: {{cite news|newspaper=The New York Times|date=1952-12-11|title=Mrs. H. H. Oskison, Novelist, is Dead|page=33|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/112258627}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He did not resume his position with ''Collier's'', but instead became an independent writer.

Oskison wrote four novels, one novelized biography (of Sam Houston), one history with commentary (on Tecumseh), and part of an autobiography.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7146">'''Johnny Htoo''' and '''Luther Htoo''' (pronounced ''''too'''', 'H' is ''silent''; born circa 1988) are twin brothers who jointly led the [[God's Army (revolutionary group)|God's Army]] [[guerrilla warfare|guerrilla]] group — a splinter group of the [[Karen National Union]] — in [[Myanmar]] (Burma) during the late 1990s.

==Formation of God's Army (1997)==
The Htoo twins were from an area of eastern Burma populated by the [[Karen people|Karen ethnic group]].  The Karen and Burmese army had fought at various times for over fifty years, but in the early 1990s the Burmese army launched a major operation to secure the route of an oil pipeline through the area.  In March 1997, a local pastor brought the two illiterate nine-year-olds to the local military chief and said the Lord had spoken to them and they would save the Karen people.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.theguardian.com/g2/story/0,3604,347432,00.html | title = Two little boys | newspaper = The Guardian | date = 2000-07-27 | accessdate = 2012-01-16 | quote = The cameras found the students in the camp of the twins, who were nine years old at the time | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.start.umd.edu/start/data_collections/tops/terrorist_organization_profile.asp?id=4032 | title = Terrorist Organization Profile: God's Army | publisher = [[National Consortium for the Study of Terrorism and Responses to Terrorism]] | accessdate = 2012-01-16 | quote = Johnny and Luther Htoo, twin brothers who were only nine years old when they formed the God's Army... }}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the legend among followers, the twins then rallied defenders of their village by shouting "God's Army!", leading them to a victory over Burmese troops.&lt;ref name=time&gt;{{cite news | url = http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,2054474,00.html | title = The Twin Terrors | newspaper = Time | date = 2000-02-07 | accessdate = 2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Various legends claimed that the brothers had numerous magical powers, including invulnerability to bullets and [[land mine|mines]], and that they could hand out magical bullets. Supposedly, they could kill by pointing a rifle at the ground and concentrating. One tale claims that Johnny turned himself into an old man and back when bathing in a river.   The legend of the boys was embraced by locals who viewed the existing Karen National Union as corrupt and ineffective.  A new rebel group called God's Army of the Holy Mountain, or God's Army for short, was thus formed under the nominal leadership of the Htoo twins.&lt;ref name=guardian /&gt;

==Worldwide attention (1999–2000)==
God's Army was situated in mountainous rainforests along the border between Burma and [[Thailand]].&lt;ref name=time /&gt; They were a band of [[Christian]] guerrillas who maintained an austere lifestyle, including abstinence from sexual intercourse, alcohol, milk, eggs and pork. The boys, called "Bu Lu" and "Bu Joh" by their followers, were both [[Chain smoking|chain smokers]] and were said to know the Bible by heart although they had never studied it.
  
In October 1999, a group calling themselves Vigorous Burmese Student Warriors seized the Burmese embassy in [[Bangkok]] and the situation ended with their departure, at which point they were taken in by God's Army.&lt;ref name=nytimes&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2001/01/17/world/17THAI.html | title = Burmese Rebel Twins and 14 Followers Surrender in Thailand | newspaper = NY Times | date = 2001-01-17 | accessdate = 2013-11-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Htoos came to worldwide attention in January 2000 when 10 members of God's Army seized a hospital in [[Ratchaburi]], Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/pmextra/jan00/24/hostage.htm | work=The Washington Post | title= Child Terrorists Hold Hundreds Hostage in Thailand | date=2000-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group held 700 to 800 patients and staff members [[hostage]] for 22 hours. They demanded the Thai government stop shelling Karen positions in Burma and treatment for their wounded. Thai security forces stormed the hospital, killing all 10 of the gunmen.&lt;ref name=time /&gt;  A photograph taken by Associated Press photographer Apichart Weerawong of a long-haired Johnny posing next to his tougher-looking, cigar-puffing brother was circulated around the world after the hospital raid.  After the raid, God's Army were strenuously pursued by the [[Tatmadaw]] (Burmese armed forces) and shunned by other Karen rebels. Luther claimed at the time he had 250,000 invisible soldiers in his command while Johnny had 150,000 of his own. Their flesh-and-blood followers was estimated to be around 500 in 1998, but gradually declined to between 100 and 200 men by early 2000 after many left to find work to support their refugee families.  Meanwhile, the Burmese army had 21,000 troops in the area.&lt;ref name=nytimes2&gt;{{cite news | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/10/world/burmese-rebel-chief-more-boy-than-warrior.html | title = Burmese Rebel Chief More Boy Than Warrior | newspaper = NY Times | date = 2000-04-01 | accessdate = 2013-11-02 | first=Seth | last=Mydans}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Surrender and life after God's Army (2001– )==
The twins surrendered to Thai soldiers in January 2001 and requested sanctuary. By that time the number of their followers had dwindled to less than 20.&lt;ref name=nytimes /&gt; They repudiated the stories about being invulnerable but insisted that God had helped them to survive over the years. They were reunited with their family. In July 2006, Johnny Htoo surrendered in Burma's military government with eight other members of God's Army in two groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/w-asia/2006/jul/25/072500407.html |title=Myanmar Teen Rebel Leader Surrenders|date=2006-07-25|publisher=Las Vegas Sun|accessdate=2009-09-14 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080104152815/http://www.lasvegassun.com/sunbin/stories/w-asia/2006/jul/25/072500407.html |archivedate = 2008-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jonathan Martin''' (1782– 3 June 1838) was an English [[arsonist]], famous for setting fire to [[York Minster]] in 1829.

==Early life==
Martin was born at Highside House, near [[Hexham]] in Northumberland, one of the twelve children of William Fenwick Martin and Isabella, ''née'' Thompson. Among his siblings was the artist [[John Martin (painter)|John Martin]] and the philosopher [[William Martin (philosopher)|William Martin]].  Jonathan was [[tongue tied]] and spoke with an [[speech impediment|impediment]].  He was brought up by his aunt, Ann Thompson, a staunch Protestant with a vivid image of hell.

After he witnessed the murder of his sister by a neighbour, he was sent to his uncle's farm to recover from the shock.  He was apprenticed to a [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]] but was [[Impressment|press ganged]] in London in 1804.  He served in the [[Royal Navy]] ship [[HMS Hercule (1798)|HMS ''Hercule'']] for six years, including the [[Battle of Copenhagen (1807)|Battle of Copenhagen]] in 1807.  He was noted among his shipmates for his religious obsession.

He left the Navy when his ship was broken up in 1810, returning to [[Norton, County Durham]], where he married, and his son Richard was born in 1814.  After his parents died, he became a [[Methodist Church of Great Britain|Wesleyan]] preacher in 1814, strongly denouncing the [[Church of England]]. He gained a reputation for disrupting church services.

After threatening to shoot the [[Bishop of Oxford]], [[Edward Legge (bishop)|Edward Legge]] at a confirmation service in [[Stockton-on-Tees|Stockton]] in 1817, he was arrested, tried, and was sent to a private [[lunatic asylum]] in [[West Auckland]].  He was later moved to the public asylum in [[Gateshead]].  He escaped in June 1820, but was soon recaptured.

His wife died of breast cancer in 1821, and he escaped from the asylum for a second time, returning to work as a [[Tanning (leather)|tanner]] and preacher. The Wesleyan Church refused to take him back, and he was turned away by the [[Primitive Methodism|Primitive Methodists]].  He published his autobiography at [[Lincoln, Lincolnshire|Lincoln]] in 1826, with further editions published in 1828, 1829 and 1830, and he made a living by selling his book.

==Arson==
He remarried in [[Boston, Lincolnshire]] in 1828, to Maria Hudson, and the couple moved to [[York]].

A year later, Martin had another mental breakdown. On Sunday 1 February 1829, he became upset by a buzzing sound in the [[Organ (music)|organ]] while attending [[Evening Prayer (Anglican)|evensong]] at [[York Minster]]. He hid in the building, and then lit a lamp in the belltower.  The cathedral watchman had been discharged, and the light was ignored by anyone who saw it.  Later that night, he set fire to the woodwork in the [[choir]] before escaping through a window.  Smoke was seen coming out of the building at 7am on 2 February, and the fire was raging through the organ and choir by 8am. The fire was brought under control that afternoon and extinguished on 3 February, when the extent of the damage became apparent.  A section of the roof of the central aisle approximately {{convert|131|foot}} long was destroyed, stretching from the lantern tower towards the east window, together with much of the internal woodwork from the organ screen to the altar screen, including the organ, medieval choir stalls, the bishop's throne, and the pulpit.   The cause –  arson – soon became apparent, and the culprit was identified from threatening placards Martin had left on the Minster railings in previous days, including his initials and address.

Martin was captured near Hexham on 6 February.  He was tried at [[York Castle]] in March 1829, before [[baron of the exchequer|Baron]] [[John Hullock|Hullock]] and a jury.  The case was a national cause célèbre, coming only two months after the trials of [[Burke and Hare]] in Edinburgh.  Martin was defended by [[Henry Brougham, 1st Baron Brougham and Vaux|Henry Brougham]], who had gained notoriety for defending [[Caroline of Brunswick|Queen Caroline]] in 1821. Despite the jury ruling that he was guilty on a capital charge, which should have resulted in a death sentence, the judge declared him not guilty on the grounds of insanity. He was detained in [[Bethlem Royal Hospital]], where he remained until he died 9 years later. During this period of detention, he made a number of drawings, including self-portraits and an apocalyptic picture of the destruction of London.  His son, Richard, from his first marriage, was brought up by Jonathan's brother [[John Martin (painter)|John]].  Richard committed suicide in September 1838, three months after his father's death.

Professor [[Herschel Prins]] has described Martin as "probably the most well-known example of a [[manic depressive]] arsonist".

Historically, Copeland's ministry held a number of conventions across the United States which lasted anywhere from three to six days. The number of longer set conventions has waned in recent years, although KCM still holds an annual Believer's Convention in his hometown of [[Fort Worth, Texas|Fort Worth]], Texas, during the week of July 4. Kenneth and Gloria Copeland, along with ministry friends including some family members, also preach at other conventions and conferences throughout the world.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} These events stream live on Copeland's website, kcm.org, as well as being shown on Christian television stations such as [[God TV]] and the [[Daystar Television Network]]. Portions of recorded conferences are shown Sundays. The Monday through Friday television broadcasts feature a Copeland family member, either alone or with another minister, discussing subjects from [[The Holy Bible]].
Most of these episodes are available on BVOV.tv.  In July 2015, KCM launched the Believer's Voice of Victory Network on channel 265 of [[Dish TV]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dish.com/business/downloads/dish-general-channel-lineup.pdf |title=dish general channel linup |publisher=dish |accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kenneth Copeland Ministries has taken advantage of a [[Federal Aviation Administration]] program that keeps flights private from tracking websites, and the ministry owns five such aircraft whose flights are kept private, including the [[Cessna Citation X|Cessna 750 Citation X]] note above and a [[North American T-28 Trojan]].&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/news/washington/2010-04-08-blocked-flights-inside_N.htm|title=Televangelist, college boosters, Hooters on stealth fliers list - USATODAY.com|publisher=|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Senator]] [[Chuck Grassley]] has questioned some of the flights taken by these aircraft, including layovers in [[Maui]], [[Fiji]], and [[Honolulu]].&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt; The ministries say that the stopovers were for preaching or for allowing pilot rest.&lt;ref name="usatoday30.usatoday.com"/&gt;

According to the [[Washington Times]], Kenneth Copeland (and another televangelist [[Jesse Duplantis]]), has defended his use of private jets as a luxury means of travel, arguing that commercial planes are full of "a bunch of demons."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2016/jan/5/kenneth-copeland-jesse-duplantis-defend-private-je/|title=Kenneth Copeland, Jesse Duplantis defend private jets: Commercial planes full of 'demons'|first=The Washington Times|last=http://www.washingtontimes.com|publisher=|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===2006 Angel Flight 44 Controversy===
According to ''[[The Christian Post]]'', Kenneth Copeland Ministries was criticized in 2010 for failing to fly disaster relief missions to [[Haiti]] after allegedly promising an aviation relief assistance program called '''Angel Flight 44'''.&lt;ref name="christianpost.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/televangelist-kenneth-copeland-blasted-for-unfulfilled-vows-43561/|title=Televangelist Kenneth Copeland Blasted for 'Unfulfilled Promises'|publisher=|accessdate=April 16, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Angel Flight 44 ministry was announced by Kenneth Copeland Ministries in 2006 and the ministry attempted to raise money to fund it.&lt;ref name="christianpost.com"/&gt; Richard Vermillion, co-author of a book on Angel Flight 44 commissioned by Kenneth Copeland Ministries, said that Copeland promised to form the aviation ministry but now believes it was never created.&lt;ref name="christianpost.com"/&gt; A spokesperson for Kenneth Copeland Ministries, Stephen Swisher, told ''The Christian Post'', "This was not a specific promise with a time line attached", and said that the money was spent on airplane repairs, and that the airplane was "not in airworthy condition" and had "structural issues.".&lt;ref name="christianpost.com"/&gt;

===2008 Mike Huckabee controversy===
In late November 2007, [[Mike Huckabee]], a [[Republican Party (United States) presidential primaries, 2008|2008 Republican presidential primary]] candidate, made six appearances on Copeland's daily television program ''[[Believer's Voice of Victory]]'', discussing "Integrity of Character."{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}} Huckabee, an ordained Baptist minister, was appearing on Copeland's daily broadcast to promote his book, ''Character IS the Issue: How People with Integrity Can Revolutionize America''. Through the years, Copeland has invited many church pastors and evangelists to appear on his daily program to discuss their respective books.  Subsequently, in January 2008, the Huckabee campaign paid for use of Kenneth Copeland Ministries' facilities for a fundraiser.&lt;ref name="2008-01-29 ADG"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www2.arkansasonline.com/news/2008/jan/29/plate-passed-huckabee-ministry-site |title=Plate passed for Huckabee at ministry site |publisher=[[Arkansas Democrat-Gazette]] |date=January 29, 2008 |accessdate=2008-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fundraising at the church was criticized by the [[Trinity Foundation (Dallas)|Trinity Foundation]].&lt;ref name="2008-01-29 ADG" /&gt;

As a result of the Huckabee appearances, Kenneth Copeland Ministries was one of six approached by the [[United States Senate inquiry into the tax-exempt status of religious organizations]]. The Copelands responded with a [[financial statement]] and created a website, ''Believers Stand United'', to help explain their perspective.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}&lt;ref&gt;The investigation found no evidence of the Copelands making personal profit from financial donations. {{cite web |url=http://www.nbcnews.com/id/40960871/ns/politics-capitol_hill/t/televangelists-escape-penalty-senate-inquiry/#.URiVeTsiGYV |title=Televangelists escape penalty in Senate inquiry |publisher=www.nbcnews.com |date=2011-07-01 |accessdate=2013-02-11 |author=Zoll, Rachel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===2013 vaccination controversy===
In 2013, a [[Measles outbreaks in the 21st century#United States|measles outbreak]] (20 confirmed cases as of August 26) in [[Tarrant County]] was attributed in the press to [[Vaccine controversies|anti-vaccination]] sentiments expressed by members of the Copeland Ministries. The church denied making any such statements and urged members to get vaccinations, even offering free immunizations through the church itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.christianpost.com/news/texas-measles-outbreak-linked-to-church-led-by-kenneth-copelands-daughter-infection-spread-to-congregation-staff-day-care-103057/|title=Texas Measles Outbreak Linked to Church Led by Kenneth Copeland's Daughter; Infection Spreads to Congregation, Staff, Day Care|website=www.christianpost.com|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pastor Terri Copeland Pearsons, who is Kenneth Copeland's daughter, offered free vaccination clinics and advised those who did not attend one of the clinics to [[quarantine]] themselves at home for two weeks. In a statement on the church website, Pearsons said she was not against immunizations, but also raised concerns about them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.npr.org/2013/09/01/217746942/texas-megachurch-at-center-of-measles-outbreak|title=Texas Megachurch At Center Of Measles Outbreak|work=NPR.org|access-date=2017-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Some people think I am against immunizations, but that is not true," the statement said. "Vaccinations help cut the mortality rate enormously. I believe it is wrong to be against vaccinations. The [[MMR vaccine controversy|concerns]] we have had are primarily with very young children who have family history of [[autism]] and with [[Vaccine bundling|bundling]] too many immunizations at one time. There is no indication of the [[Controversies in autism|autism connection]] with vaccinations in older children. Furthermore, the new [[MMR vaccine|MMR vaccination]] is without [[thimerosal]] (mercury), which has also been [[Thiomersal controversy|a concern]] to many."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/Health/texas-church-epicenter-measles-outbreak/story?id=20071644|title=Texas Church at Epicenter of Measles Outbreak|last=News|first=A.

===2015 ''Last Week Tonight'' criticism===
Kenneth Copeland and his wife, Gloria Copeland, were featured in a 2015 episode of ''[[Last Week Tonight with John Oliver]]'' that gained media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Last Week Tonight with John Oliver: Televangelists (HBO)|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7y1xJAVZxXg|website=YouTube|accessdate=18 August 2015|format=16 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ohlheiser|first1=Abby|title=Comedian John Oliver takes on the prosperity gospel by becoming a televangelist|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/acts-of-faith/wp/2015/08/17/comedian-john-oliver-takes-on-the-prosperity-gospel-by-becoming-a-televangelist/|website=The Washington Post|accessdate=18 August 2015|date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Locker|first1=Melissa|title=John Oliver Becomes a Televangelist and Finally Starts His Own Church|url=http://time.com/3999933/john-oliver-televangelist-church-alst-week-tonight/|website=Time Magazine|accessdate=18 August 2015|date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stern|first1=Marlow|title=John Oliver Exposes Shady Televangelists Fleecing Americans For Millions|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2015/08/17/john-oliver-exposes-shady-televangelists-fleecing-americans-for-millions.html|website=The Daily Beast|accessdate=18 August 2015|date=17 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Comedian [[John Oliver (comedian)|John Oliver]] criticized the Copelands for using tax laws to live in a $6.3 million mansion as the [[parsonage]] allowance for their home is not subject to income taxes,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Burnett|first1=John|title=Can A Television Network Be A Church?

Do you want to do that," Copeland asked of the doctor's "poison" treatment, "or do you want to sit here on a Saturday morning, hear the word of God, and let faith come into your heart and be healed?"

===Private jets===
In 2009, Copeland's $3.6 million jet was denied tax-exempt status, opening up a possible investigation into the church's expenses; Copeland failed to disclose the salaries of his directors. In 2008 the ministry stated it owned five airplanes, one of which is valued at $17.5 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Tax-Exempt Status For Televangelist's Jet Denied|publisher=Americans United|url=https://au.org/church-state/january-2009-church-state/au-bulletin/tax-exempt-status-for-televangelist%E2%80%99s-jet-denied}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Copeland's ministry bought a multi-million&lt;ref name=CP-KC&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenneth Copeland Acquires New Gulfstream V Jet, Seeks $19.5M for Upgrades and Maintenance|publisher=Christian Post|url=https://www.christianpost.com/news/kenneth-copeland-acquires-new-gulfstream-v-jet-seeks-19-5m-for-upgrades-and-maintenance-214408/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gulfstream V]] jet airplane and Copeland thanked his followers and Jesus for buying it when it was delivered at the Fort Worth airstrip, wearing a [[Flight jacket|pilot jacket]] and sunglasses.&lt;ref name=D5286955&gt;{{cite web|title='Jesus bought this': Delighted televangelist Kenneth Copeland giggles with glee as he unveils new $3million private jet paid for by donations from his followers|publisher=Daily Mail|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5286955/Prosperity-Preacher-Kenneth-Copeland-giggles-GV.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jet was bought from filmmaker and businessman [[Tyler Perry]]. Copeland had earlier stated that flying commercial was like entering "a long tube with a bunch of demons",&lt;ref name=D5286955/&gt; and defended the use of private jets as it was important, it lets for prayer in privacy 'as the Lord leads' and avoids unnecessary demons.&lt;ref name=CP-KC/&gt; Now, the church is asking another $17&lt;ref name=D5286955/&gt; or $19.5 million for the building of a hangar, upgrading the runway and maintenance.&lt;ref name=CP-KC/&gt;

Copeland's and other televangelists' use of private jets and other lavish houses and vehicles has been criticized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenneth Copeland Ministries Ups Being a Scumonaut by Bragging About New G5 Jet|publisher=Pulpit&amp;Pen|url=http://pulpitandpen.org/2018/01/16/kenneth-copeland-ministries-ups-being-a-scumonaut-by-bragging-about-new-g5-jet/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenneth Copeland Loves His New $36 Million Jet|publisher=Patheos|url=http://www.patheos.com/blogs/warrenthrockmorton/2018/01/18/kenneth-copeland-36-million-jet/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Televagelist thanks Jesus for $36M private jet he uses to avoid demons|publisher=The Maven|url=https://www.themaven.net/beingliberal/room/televagelist-thanks-jesus-for-36m-private-jet-he-uses-to-avoid-demons-sldtGWfs-kq7Qisw941q5w}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Quiambao was born on May 20, 1975 in [[Quezon City]] to Medgardo Quiambao of [[Bacacay, Albay]] and Magdalena (''née'' Redito) of [[Oas, Albay]] and is the first of two children. She attended the [[School of the Holy Spirit of Quezon City]] during her [[Elementary school|elementary]] and [[high school]] years and went for her collegiate studies at the [[University of Santo Tomas]] where she obtained her degree in [[physical therapy]]. She is also a licensed Physical Therapist for the state of [[Indiana]] in the [[United States]]. Before her Binibining Pilipinas stint, Quiambao had a thriving career as a therapist for [[St. Luke's Medical Center|St. Luke's Hospital]] in [[Manila]]. Also, she worked as an [[teacher|instructor]] for a local [[gym]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Miriam Quiambao Biography - PINOYSTOP|url=http://www.pinoystop.com/bio/celebrity-profile/1502/miriam-quiambao-biography|website=PinoyStop|accessdate=2 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==As Beauty Queen==

===Binibining Pilipinas===

In 1999, Quiambao joined the [[Binibining Pilipinas]] pageant. She received several awards, including Miss Photogenic, and captured the [[Binibining Pilipinas World|Binibining Pilipinas World 1999]] title. However, controversy soon erupted when the Binibining Pilipinas Universe titleholder ''Janelle Bautista'' was dethroned due to questionable citizenship.  She was then asked to take over the title and be the Philippine representative to the [[Miss Universe 1999]] pageant to be held that year in [[Trinidad and Tobago]]. [[Binibining Pilipinas International|Binibining Pilipinas International 1999]], ''Lalaine Edson'' took over Quiambao's previous title.

===Miss Universe 1999===
Before arriving at the host country, Quiambao trained in Venezuela under the guidance of [[Osmel Sousa]] for a week.

She was one of the strongest and most visible contenders for the crown. She consistently placed second during the pageant's [[preliminaries]] and bested a composite score of 9.52, just trailing behind the score of [[Sonia Raciti]], the [[South African]] candidate. At the [[semifinals]], she once again placed second overall in the [[swimsuit]] and [[evening gown]] competitions, racking up scores as high as 9.32 and 9.42 respectively. It was [[Spain]]'s candidate, Diana Nogueira that dominated the semifinals with a marginal lead over Quiambao of 9.33 for the swimsuit event and 9.45 for the evening gown competition.

====The fall====
During the preliminary round of the evening gown competition, Quiambao slipped and fell on stage. As she walked, the heel of one of her shoes got caught in the trail of her evening gown and she slipped on the floor. Despite this incident she collected herself, regained composure, walked graciously, finished her walk, and drew applause from the audience. At the finals, Quiambao referred to the incident during an interview portion. She said "she felt she represented those women who have fallen both on and off the stage" and hopes to be "an example to the rest of the women in the world".

====Final results====
Early at the competition she received the [[Clairol]] [[Herbal Essences]] Style Award, the only Asian candidate at the pageant to do so. She was called as one of the final three delegates, alongside Misses [[Botswana]] and [[Spain]]. Quiambao faltered during the final question, which tackled the debate of whether a Miss Universe should continue her reign even if she gets pregnant. Spain's Diana Nogueira placed as 2nd Runner-Up. It all came down to [[Philippines]]' Quiambao and [[Botswana]]'s [[Mpule Kwelagobe]], and in the end, Quiambao placed as 1st Runner-up, with [[Mpule Kwelagobe]] of [[Botswana]] win the [[Miss Universe 1999]] title.

==Television and Showbiz Career==
After her triumphant stint at the pageant, Quiambao began a new career working as a TV Host/Correspondent for [[GMA Network]] back in the Philippines. In December 1999, she co-hosted [[Unang Hirit]]" with [[Arnold Clavio]], Lyn Ching-Pascual, Suzi Entrata-Abrera, [[Mickey Ferriols]] and [[Ryan Agoncillo]]. Quiambao hosted a lifestyle segment of the show called "Istayl".

Quiambao then joined [[Paolo Bediones]] on hosting the show ''Extra, Extra'', which eventually evolved into a reality program called ''[[Extra Challenge]]''. Upon leaving the show in December 2003, a nationwide search was made for her replacement. She briefly hosted ''All About You'', a show about women and good values, and fulfilled her dream of having her own talk show.

In January 2004, she got married to [[Italy|Italian]] [[businessman]] Claudio Rondinelli but the two-year marriage eventually fell apart and Quiambao went back to the Philippines in 2006. She resumed her TV hosting career, working alongside again with Paolo Bediones, this time presenting a travel show, ''Pinoy Meets World''.

She also co-host for the show ''Palaban'' on [[GMA Network|GMA 7]] with Winnie Monsod and Malou Mangahas tackling [[current events]], [[socio-economic]] and [[political issue]]s in the Philippines in 2007. Also, she became the host for [[Q (TV network)|QTV 11]]'s "Dahil Sa Iyong Paglisan", a made for TV show highlighting the experiences, trials and success of [[Overseas Filipinos|Overseas Filipino Workers]] or OFW.

During the first anniversary of ''[[100% Pinoy]]'', she was one of the new host together with Joaquin Valdez. She was also the co-host for ''[[The Beat (Philippine TV series)|The Beat]]'' (formerly Sapulso) on QTV with journalist/newscaster [[Ivan Mayrina]].

On the second half of the year 2009, she went on to test her acting skills by appearing in a Philippine horror movie [[Patient X (film)|Patient X]] as the Nurse Betty and the comedy movie [[Kimmy Dora]] as Gertrude. Once again, she appeared on television through the TV series "[[Kung Tayo'y Magkakalayo]]" as Aludra, the guest villain for the series.

In 2011, she played Josie/Alonah in the Fantasy series [[Carlo J. Caparas' Bangis|Bangis]] on [[TV5 (Philippines)|TV5.]] She played as  "Maxene" in notable sitcom ''[[The Jose and Wally Show Starring Vic Sotto]]'' on the said network. In that same year, she had a cameo role as [[Ryan Agoncillo]]'s boss for the movie ''House Husband: Ikaw Na!''.

==Controversy==
Quiambao was criticized by the [[LGBT]] community in the [[Philippines]]&lt;ref name=ity&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.mb.com.ph/articles/358485/miriam-quiambao-apologizes-lgbt-community-over-remarks-homosexuality-and-religion}}{{deadlinl|date=October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; in early 2012 over remarks she made about [[homosexuality]] while being a guest on the current affairs talk show ''[[The Bottomline with Boy Abunda]]''. It was followed by her taking her stand to a [[Twitter]] post, saying: "Homosexuality is not a sin but it is a lie from the devil." Her words have caused a huge backlash with openly gay Filipino celebrities and the rest of the entertainment industry criticizing her for such a "closed-minded" statement. She has since apologized for "not being sensitive" with her choice of words on a Twitter post.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

'''Mitanni'''  ({{IPAc-en|m|ɪ|ˈ|t|æ|n|i}}; [[Hittite cuneiform]]
{{transl|hit|[[KUR]] &lt;sup&gt;[[Cities of the ancient Near East|URU]]&lt;/sup&gt;''Mi-ta-an-ni''}}; '''Mittani''' ''{{transl|hit|Mi-it-ta-ni}}''), also called '''Hanigalbat''' (''Hanigalbat'', ''Khanigalbat'' cuneiform ''{{transl|akk|Ḫa-ni-gal-bat}}''&lt;!--{{cuneiform|��������}}--&gt;) in [[Assyria]]n or '''Naharin''' in [[Ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] texts, was a [[Hurrian language|Hurrian]]-speaking state in northern [[Syria (region)|Syria]] and southeast [[Anatolia]] from c. 1500 to 1300 BC. Mitanni came to be a regional power after the Hittite destruction of [[Amorite]]&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = The Kingdom of the Hittites | author = Trevor Bryce | publisher = Oxford University Press | year = 2005 | page = 98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[First Babylonian Dynasty|Babylon]] and a series of ineffectual [[Assyria]]n kings created a power vacuum in Mesopotamia.

At the beginning of its history, Mitanni's major rival was Egypt under the [[Eighteenth Dynasty of Egypt|Thutmosids]]. However, with the ascent of the [[Hittite Empire]], Mitanni and Egypt struck an alliance to protect their mutual interests from the threat of Hittite domination. At the height of its power, during the 14th century BC, Mitanni had outposts centred on its capital, [[Washukanni]], whose location has been determined by archaeologists to be on the [[headwaters]] of the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur River]]. The Mitanni dynasty ruled over the northern [[Tigris–Euphrates river system|Euphrates-Tigris]] region between c. 1475 and c. 1275 BC. Eventually, Mitanni succumbed to Hittite and later Assyrian attacks and was reduced to the status of a province of the [[Middle Assyrian Empire]].

While the Mitanni kings were [[Indo-Aryan peoples|Indo-Aryan]], they used the language of the local people, which was at that time a non-[[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] language, Hurrian. Their sphere of influence is shown in Hurrian place names, personal names and the spread through Syria and the [[Levant]] of a distinct pottery type.

==Geography==
The Mitanni controlled [[trade route]]s down the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] to [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and up the [[Euphrates]] from there to [[Carchemish]]. For a time they also controlled the [[Assyria]]n territories of the upper [[Tigris]] and its headwaters at [[Nineveh]], [[Erbil]], [[Assur]] and [[Nuzi]]. Their allies included [[Kizuwatna]] in southeastern [[Anatolia]], Mukish which stretched between [[Ugarit]] and [[Quatna]] west of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]] to the sea, and the [[Niya (kingdom)|Niya]] which controlled the east bank of the Orontes from [[Alalah]] down through [[Aleppo]], [[Ebla]] and [[Hama]] to Qatna and [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]. To the east, they had good relations with the [[Kassites]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Roaf, Cambridge Atlas of Mesopotamia maps pp 134&amp;ndash;135.&lt;/ref&gt; The land of Mitanni in northern Syria extended from the [[Taurus mountains]] to its west and as far east as Nuzi (modern [[Kirkuk]]) and the river Tigris in the east. In the south, it extended from Aleppo across (''Nuhashshe'') to Mari on the Euphrates in the east. Its centre was in the Khabur River valley, with two capitals:  [[Taite]] and [[Washshukanni]] called ''Taidu'' and ''Ushshukana'' respectively in Assyrian sources. The whole area supports agriculture without artificial irrigation and cattle, sheep and goats were raised. It is very similar to Assyria in climate, and was settled by both indigenous Hurrian and [[Amorites|Amoritic]]-speaking (''Amurru'') populations.

==Name==
The Mitanni kingdom was referred to as the '''Maryannu, Nahrin''' or '''Mitanni''' by the [[Egyptians]], the '''Hurri''' by the Hittites, and the '''Hanigalbat''' by the Assyrians. The different names seem to have referred to the same kingdom and were used interchangeably, according to Michael C. Astour.&lt;ref&gt;Astour, "Ḫattusilis̆, Ḫalab, and Ḫanigalbat" ''Journal of Near Eastern Studies'' '''31'''.2 (April 1972:102&amp;ndash;109) p 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Hittite annals mention a people called ''Hurri'' (''{{transl|hit|Ḫu-ur-ri}}''), located in northeastern Syria. A Hittite fragment, probably from the time of [[Mursili I]], mentions a "King of the Hurri". The [[Akkadian language|Assyro-Akkadian]] version of the text renders "Hurri" as ''Hanigalbat''. Tushratta, who styles himself "king of Mitanni" in his [[Amarna letters|Akkadian Amarna letters]], refers to his kingdom as Hanigalbat.&lt;ref&gt;Astour 1972:103, noting Amarna letters 18:9; 20:17;29:49.&lt;/ref&gt;

Egyptian sources call Mitanni "''nhrn''", which is usually pronounced as ''[[Naharin]]/Naharina'' &lt;ref&gt;Faulkner, Raymond O. ''A Concise Dictionary of Middle Egyptian.'' p.135. Griffith Institute, Oxford, 1962; [http://history.memphis.edu/murnane/Kitchen%20-%20New%20Kingdom%20Topographical%20Lists.pdf Egyptian New Kingdom Topographical lists], by Kenneth Kitchen, p.5 bottom paragraph, University of Memphis&lt;/ref&gt; from the [[Akkadian language|Assyro-Akkadian]] word for "river", cf. ''[[Aram-Naharaim]]''. The name ''Mitanni'' is first found in the "memoirs" of the Syrian wars (c. 1480 BC) of the official astronomer and clockmaker Amenemhet, who returned from the "foreign country called ''Me-ta-ni''" at the time of [[Thutmose I]].&lt;ref&gt;His memoir was published by L. Borchardt, "Altägyptische Zeitmessung" in E. von Basserman-Jordan, ''Die Geschichte der Zeitmessung und der Ühre'', vol. I. (Berlin/Leipzig) 1930, pp 60ff, noted in Astour 1972:104, notes 25,26.&lt;/ref&gt; The expedition to the Naharina announced by [[Thutmosis I]] at the beginning of his reign&lt;ref&gt;W. Helck, ''''Oriens Antiquus'' '''8''' 1969:301, note 41; 302.&lt;/ref&gt; may have actually taken place during the long previous reign of [[Amenhotep I]].&lt;ref&gt;[[É. Drioton]] and J. Vandier, ''L'Égypte''4th ed. (Paris) 1962:396f.&lt;/ref&gt; Helck believes that this was the expedition mentioned by [[Amenhotep II]].

== People ==
The ethnicity of the people of Mitanni is difficult to ascertain. A treatise on the training of chariot horses by [[Kikkuli]] contains a number of Indo-Aryan glosses.&lt;ref name=Drews&gt;[[Robert Drews]], "The Coming of the Greeks: Indo-European Conquests in the Aegean and the Near East", Princeton University Press, Chariot Warfare. p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; Kammenhuber (1968)  suggested that this vocabulary was derived from the still undivided [[Indo-Iranian languages|Indo-Iranian]] language,&lt;ref name=Drews /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Annelies Kammenhuber, "Die Arier im vorderen Orient" (Heidelberg: Carl Winter Universistätsverlag, 1968. p. 238.  On p. 238 she indicates they spoke a "''noch ungeteiltes Indo-Iranisch''".&lt;/ref&gt; but Mayrhofer (1974) has shown that specifically Indo-Aryan features are present.&lt;ref&gt;M. Mayrhofer, Die Arier im Vorderen Orient &amp;ndash; ein Mythos? Sitzungsberichte der Oesterreichischen Akademie der Wissenschaften 294,3, Vienna 1974; M. Mayrhofer, Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen, Heidelberg 1986&amp;ndash;2000, vol. IV&lt;/ref&gt;

The names of the Mitanni aristocracy frequently are of [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] origin, but it is specifically their deities which show [[Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni|Indo-Aryan]] roots ([[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Indra]], [[Nasatya]]), though some think that they are more immediately related to the [[Kassites]].&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq,'' p. 229. Penguin Books, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; The common people's language, the [[Hurrian language]], is neither [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]] nor Semitic.&lt;ref&gt;Georges Roux, ''Ancient Iraq,'' p. 234. Penguin Books, 1966.&lt;/ref&gt; Hurrian is related to [[Urartian language|Urartian]], the language of [[Urartu]], both belonging to the [[Hurro-Urartian languages|Hurro-Urartian language family]]. It had been held that nothing more can be deduced from current evidence.&lt;ref&gt;[[E. A. Speiser]], ''Introduction to Hurrian,'' p. 10. American Schools of Oriental Research, New Haven. Annual of the American Schools of Oriental Research, Vol. 20. 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; A Hurrian passage in the Amarna letters &amp;ndash; usually composed in [[Akkadian (language)|Akkadian]], the ''lingua franca'' of the day &amp;ndash; indicates that the royal family of Mitanni was by then speaking Hurrian as well.

Bearers of names in the Hurrian language are attested in wide areas of Syria and the northern Levant that are clearly outside the area of the political entity known to Assyria as ''Hanilgalbat''. There is no indication that these persons owed allegiance to the political entity of Mitanni; although the [[German language|German]] term ''Auslandshurriter'' ("Hurrian expatriates") has been used by some authors. In the 14th century BC numerous city-states in northern Syria and Canaan were ruled by persons with Hurrian and some Indo-Aryan names. If this can be taken to mean that the population of these states was Hurrian as well, then it is possible that these entities were a part of a larger polity with a shared Hurrian identity. This is often assumed, but without a critical examination of the sources. Differences in dialect and regionally different pantheons (''Hepat/Shawushka, Sharruma/Tilla'' etc.) point to the existence of several groups of Hurrian speakers.

==History==

No native sources for the history of Mitanni have been found so far. The account is mainly based on Assyrian, Hittite, and [[ancient Egypt|Egyptian]] sources, as well as inscriptions from nearby places in Syria. Often it is not even possible to establish synchronicity between the rulers of different countries and cities, let alone give uncontested absolute dates. The definition and history of Mitanni is further beset by a lack of differentiation between linguistic, ethnic and political groups.

===Summary===

It is believed that the warring Hurrian tribes and city states became united under one dynasty after the collapse of [[Babylon]] due to its sacking by Hittite king [[Mursili I]], and the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion. The Hittite conquest of Aleppo ([[Yamhad]]), the weak middle Assyrian kings who succeeded [[Puzur-Ashur III]], and the internal strife of the Hittites had created a power vacuum in upper [[Mesopotamia]]. This led to the formation of the kingdom of Mitanni.

King [[Barattarna]] of Mitanni expanded the kingdom west to Halab (Aleppo) and made the [[Canaan]]ite{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} king [[Idrimi]] of [[Alalakh]] his vassal. The state of [[Kizzuwatna]] in the west also shifted its allegiance to Mitanni, and Assyria in the east had become largely a Mitannian vassal state by the mid-15th century BC. The nation grew stronger during the reign of [[Shaushtatar]] but the Hurrians were keen to keep the Hittites inside the Anatolian highland. Kizzuwatna in the west and [[Ishuwa]] in the north were important allies against the hostile Hittites.

After a few successful clashes with the Pharaohs over the control of Syria, Mitanni sought peace with Egypt and an alliance was formed. During the reign of [[Shuttarna II|Shuttarna]] in the early 14th century BC the relationship was very amicable, and he sent his daughter Gilu-Hepa to Egypt for a marriage with Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]]. Mitanni was now at its peak of power.
 
However, by the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1390&amp;ndash;1366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between [[Tushratta]] and his brother [[Artatama II]] and after this his son [[Shuttarna II]], who called himself king of the [[Hurri]] while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Hurri/Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus loosened Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs.&lt;ref&gt;George Roux - Ancient Iraq&lt;/ref&gt;
King [[Ashur-Uballit I]] (1365&amp;ndash;1330 BC) of [[Assyria]] attacked Shuttarna and annexed Mittani territory in the middle of the 14th century BC, making Assyria once more a great power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cline |first=Eric H. |date=2014 |title=[[1177 B.C.: The Year Civilization Collapsed]] |url= |location= |publisher=Princeton University Press |page=61 |isbn=1400849985 |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the death of Shuttarna, Mitanni was ravaged by a war of succession. Eventually Tushratta, a son of Shuttarna, ascended the throne, but the kingdom had been weakened considerably and both the Hittite and Assyrian threats increased. At the same time, the diplomatic relationship with Egypt went cold, the Egyptians fearing the growing power of the Hittites and Assyrians. The Hittite king [[Suppiluliuma I]] invaded the Mitanni vassal states in northern Syria and replaced them with loyal subjects.

In the capital [[Washukanni]], a new power struggle broke out. The Hittites and the Assyrians supported different pretenders to the throne. Finally a Hittite army conquered the capital Washukanni and installed [[Shattiwaza]], the son of Tushratta, as their vassal king of Mitanni in the late 14th century BC. The kingdom had by now been reduced to the Khabur Valley. The Assyrians had not given up their claim on Mitanni, and in the 13th century BC, [[Shalmaneser I]] annexed the kingdom.

===Early kingdom===

As early as [[Akkadian Empire|Akkadian]] times, Hurrians are known to have lived east of the river Tigris on the northern rim of Mesopotamia, and in the Khabur Valley. The group which became Mitanni gradually moved south into Mesopotamia before the 17th century BC.

Hurrians are mentioned in the private [[Nuzi]] texts, in [[Ugarit]], and the Hittite archives in [[Hattusa|Hattushsha]] ([[Boğazköy]]). [[Cuneiform (script)|Cuneiform]] texts from [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] mention rulers of city-states in upper Mesopotamia with both ''Amurru'' (Amorite) and Hurrian names. Rulers with Hurrian names are also attested for [[Urshu]]m and [[Khashshum|Hashshum]], and tablets from [[Alalakh]] (layer VII, from the later part of the old-[[Babylonia]]n period) mention people with Hurrian names at the mouth of the [[Orontes river|Orontes]]. There is no evidence for any invasion from the North-east. Generally, these [[onomastic]] sources have been taken as evidence for a Hurrian expansion to the South and the West.

A Hittite fragment, probably from the time of [[Mursili I]], mentions a "King of the Hurrians" (''LUGAL ERÍN.MEŠ Hurri''). This terminology was last used for King Tushratta of Mitanni, in a letter in the Amarna archives. The normal title of the king was 'King of the Hurri-men' (without the determinative ''KUR'' indicating a country).

It is believed that the warring Hurrian tribes and city states became united under one dynasty after the collapse of [[Babylon]] due to the Hittite sack by [[Mursili I]] and the [[Kassites|Kassite]] invasion. The Hittite conquest of Aleppo ([[Yamkhad]]), the weak middle Assyrian kings, and the internal strifes of the Hittites had created a power vacuum in upper Mesopotamia. This led to the formation of the kingdom of Mitanni. The legendary founder of the Mitannian dynasty was a king called [[Kirta]], who was followed by a king [[Shuttarna I|Shuttarna]]. Nothing is known about these early kings.

===Barattarna / Parsha(ta)tar ===
{{Main|Parshatatar}}

King Barattarna is known from a cuneiform tablet in Nuzi and an inscription by [[Idrimi]] of [[Alalakh]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/farfarer2001/alalakh/idrimi_inscription.htm&amp;date=2009-10-24+21:45:59 ''IDRIMI INSCRIPTION'']&lt;/ref&gt;  Egyptian sources do not mention his name; that he was the king of Naharin whom [[Thutmose III]] fought against in the 15th century BC can only be deduced from assumptions. Whether Parsha(ta)tar, known from another Nuzi inscription, is the same as Barattarna, or a different king, is debated.

Under the rule of Thutmose III, Egyptian troops crossed the Euphrates and entered the core lands of Mitanni. At [[Megiddo (place)|Megiddo]], he fought an alliance of 330 Mitanni princes and tribal leaders under the ruler of [[Kadesh (Syria)|Kadesh]]. See [[Battle of Megiddo (15th century BC)]]. Mitanni had sent troops as well. Whether this was done because of existing treaties, or only in reaction to a common threat, remains open to debate. The Egyptian victory opened the way north.

Thutmose III again waged war in Mitanni in the 33rd year of his rule. The Egyptian army crossed the Euphrates at [[Carchemish]] and reached a town called Iryn (maybe present day Erin, 20&amp;nbsp;km northwest of Aleppo.) They sailed down the Euphrates to [[Emar]] (Meskene) and then returned home via Mitanni. A hunt for elephants at Lake Nija was important enough to be included in the annals. This was impressive PR, but did not lead to any permanent rule.{{citation needed|date=August 2015}} Only the area at the [[Orontes River|middle Orontes]] and [[Phoenicia]] became part of Egyptian territory.

Victories over Mitanni are recorded from the Egyptian campaigns in ''Nuhashshe'' (middle part of Syria). Again, this did not lead to permanent territorial gains. Barattarna or his son Shaushtatar controlled the North Mitanni interior up to ''Nuhashshe'', and the coastal territories from [[Kizzuwatna]] to Alalakh in the kingdom of Mukish at the mouth of the Orontes. Idrimi of Alalakh, returning from Egyptian exile, could only ascend his throne with Barattarna's consent. While he got to rule Mukish and Ama'u, [[Aleppo]] remained with Mitanni.

===Shaushtatar===
{{Main|Shaushtatar}}
[[File:Royal seal of Šauštatar of Mitanni.svg|thumb|right|Šauštatar's royal seal]]

[[Shaushtatar]], king of Mitanni, sacked the Assyrian capital of [[Assur]] some time in the 15th century during the reign of [[Nur-ili]], and took the silver and golden doors of the royal palace to [[Washshukanni]].&lt;ref&gt;Cline 2014, p. 61&lt;/ref&gt; This is known from a later Hittite document, the Suppililiuma-Shattiwaza treaty. After the sack of Assur, Assyria may have paid tribute to Mitanni up to the time of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1390&amp;ndash;1366 BC). There is no trace of that in the Assyrian king lists; therefore it is probable that Ashur was ruled by a native Assyrian dynasty owing sporadic allegiance to the house of Shaushtatar. While a sometime vassal of Mitanni, the temple of [[Sin (mythology)|Sin]] and [[Shamash]] was built in Ashur.

The states of [[Aleppo]] in the west, and [[Nuzi]] and [[Arrapha]] in the east, seem to have been incorporated into Mitanni under Shaushtatar as well. The palace of the [[Crown Prince|crown prince]], the governor of Arrapha has been excavated. A letter from Shaushtatar was discovered in the house of Shilwe-Teshup. His [[Seal (device)|seal]] shows heroes and winged geniuses fighting lions and other animals, as well as a [[winged sun]]. This style, with a multitude of figures distributed over the whole of the available space, is taken as typically Hurrian. A second seal, belonging to Shuttarna I, but used by Shaushtatar, found in Alalakh, shows a more traditional Assyro-Akkadian style.

The military superiority of Mitanni was probably based on the use of two-wheeled war-[[chariots]], driven by the 'Marjannu' people. A text on the training of war-horses, written by a certain "[[Kikkuli]] the Mitannian" has been found in the archives recovered at [[Hattusa]]. More speculative is the attribution of the introduction of the chariot in Mesopotamia to early Mitanni.

During the reign of Egyptian Pharaoh [[Amenhotep II]], Mitanni seems to have regained influence in the middle Orontes valley that had been conquered by Thutmose III. Amenhotep fought in Syria in 1425 BC, presumably against Mitanni as well, but did not reach the Euphrates.

===Artatama I and Shuttarna II===
{{Main|Artatama I|Shuttarna II}}

Later on, Egypt and Mitanni became allies, and King [[Shuttarna II]] himself was received at the Egyptian court. Amicable letters, sumptuous gifts, and letters asking for sumptuous gifts were exchanged. Mitanni was especially interested in Egyptian gold. This culminated in a number of royal marriages: the daughter of King [[Artatama I]] was married to [[Thutmose IV of Egypt|Thutmose IV]]. Kilu-Hepa, or [[Gilukhipa]], the daughter of Shuttarna II, was married to Pharaoh [[Amenhotep III]], who ruled in the early 14th century BC. In a later royal marriage Tadu-Hepa, or [[Tadukhipa]], the daughter of Tushratta, was sent to Egypt.

When [[Amenhotep III]] fell ill, the king of Mitanni sent him a statue of the goddess Shaushka ([[Ishtar]]) of [[Nineveh]] that was reputed to cure diseases. A more or less permanent border between Egypt and Mitanni seems to have existed near [[Qatna]] on the Orontes River; [[Ugarit]] was part of Egyptian territory.

The reason Mitanni sought peace with Egypt may have been trouble with the Hittites. A Hittite king called [[Tudhaliya]] conducted campaigns against Kizzuwatna, [[Arzawa]], [[Ishuwa]], Aleppo, and maybe against Mitanni itself. Kizzuwatna may have fallen to the Hittites at that time.

===Artashumara and Tushratta===
{{Main|Artashumara|Tushratta}}
[[Image:Cuneiform letter to Amenhotep III.jpg|thumb|275px|left|Cuneiform tablet containing a letter from Tushratta of Mitanni to Amenhotep III (of 13 letters of King Tushratta).]]

Artashumara followed his father Shuttarna II on the throne, but was murdered by a certain UD-hi, or Uthi. It is uncertain what intrigues that followed, but UD-hi then placed [[Tushratta]], another son of Shuttarna, on the throne. Probably, he was quite young at the time and was intended to serve as a figurehead only. However, he managed to dispose of the murderer, possibly with the help of his Egyptian father-in-law, but this is sheer speculation.

The Egyptians may have suspected the mighty days of Mitanni were about to end. In order to protect their Syrian border zone the new Pharaoh [[Akhenaten]] instead received envoys from the resurgent powers of the Hittites and Assyria. From the [[Amarna letters]] we know how Tushratta's desperate claim for a gold statue from Akhenaten developed into a major diplomatic crisis.

The unrest weakened the Mitannian control of their vassal states, and [[Aziru]] of [[Amurru kingdom|Amurru]] seized the opportunity and made a secret deal with the Hittite king [[Suppiluliuma I]]. [[Kizzuwatna]], which had seceded from the Hittites, was reconquered by Suppiluliuma. In what has been called his first Syrian campaign, Suppiluliuma then invaded the western Euphrates valley, and conquered the ''Amurru'' and ''Nuhashshe'' in Mitanni.

According to the later Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty, Suppiluliuma had made a treaty with [[Artatama II]], a rival of Tushratta. Nothing is known of this Artatama's previous life or connection, if any, to the royal family. He is called "king of the Hurri", while Tushratta went by the title "King of Mitanni". This must have disagreed with Tushratta. Suppiluliuma began to plunder the lands on the west bank of the Euphrates, and annexed [[Mount Lebanon]]. Tushratta threatened to raid beyond the Euphrates if even a single lamb or kid was stolen.
By the reign of [[Eriba-Adad I]] (1390&amp;ndash;1366 BC) Mitanni influence over Assyria was on the wane. Eriba-Adad I became involved in a dynastic battle between Tushratta and his brother Artatama II and after this his son Shuttarna III, who called himself king of the Hurri while seeking support from the Assyrians. A pro-Hurri/Assyria faction appeared at the royal Mitanni court. Eriba-Adad I had thus loosened Mitanni influence over Assyria, and in turn had now made Assyria an influence over Mitanni affairs

Suppiluliuma then recounts how the land of [[Ishuwa]] on the upper Euphrates had seceded in the time of his grandfather. Attempts to conquer it had failed. In the time of his father, other cities had rebelled. Suppiluliuma claims to have defeated them, but the survivors had fled to the territory of Ishuwa, that must have been part of Mitanni. A clause to return fugitives is part of many treaties between sovereign states and between rulers and vassal states, so perhaps the harbouring of fugitives by Ishuwa formed the pretext for the Hittite invasion.

A Hittite army crossed the border, entered Ishuwa and returned the fugitives (or deserters or exile governments) to Hittite rule. "I freed the lands that I captured; they dwelt in their places. All the people whom I released rejoined their peoples, and Hatti incorporated their territories."

The Hittite army then marched through various districts towards [[Washukanni]]. Suppiluliuma claims to have plundered the area, and to have brought loot, captives, cattle, sheep and horses back to Hatti. He also claims that Tushratta fled, though obviously he failed to capture the capital. While the campaign weakened Mitanni, it did not endanger its existence.

In a second campaign, the Hittites again crossed the Euphrates and subdued [[Halab]], [[Mukish]], [[Niya (kingdom)|Niya]], [[Arahati]], [[Apina]], and Qatna, as well as some cities whose names have not been preserved. The booty from Arahati included charioteers, who were brought to Hatti together with all their possessions. While it was common practice to incorporate enemy soldiers in the army, this might point to a Hittite attempt to counter the most potent weapon of Mitanni, the war-chariots, by building up or strengthening their own chariot forces.

All in all, Suppiluliuma claims to have conquered the lands "from Mount Lebanon and from the far bank of the Euphrates". But Hittite governors or vassal rulers are mentioned only for some cities and kingdoms. While the Hittites made some territorial gains in western Syria, it seems unlikely that they established a permanent rule east of the Euphrates.

===Shattiwaza / Kurtiwaza===
{{Main|Shattiwaza}}

A son of Tushratta conspired with his subjects, and killed his father in order to become king. His brother [[Shattiwaza]] was forced to flee. In the unrest that followed, the Assyrians asserted themselves under [[Ashur-uballit I]], and he invaded the country; and the pretender Artatama/Atratama II gained ascendancy, followed by his son Shuttarna. Suppiluliuma claims that "the entire land of Mittanni went to ruin, and the land of Assyria and the land of [[Alshi]] divided it between them", but this sounds more like wishful thinking. Although Assyria annexed Mitanni territory, the kingdom survived. Shuttarna wisely maintained good relations with Assyria, and returned to it the palace doors of Ashur, that had been taken by Shaushtatar. Such booty formed a powerful political symbol in ancient [[Mesopotamia]].

The fugitive Shattiwaza may have gone to [[Babylon]] first, but eventually ended up at the court of the Hittite king, who married him to one of his daughters. The treaty between Suppiluliuma of Hatti and Shattiwaza of Mitanni has been preserved and is one of the main sources on this period. After the conclusion of the Suppiluliuma-Shattiwaza treaty, [[Piyashshili]], a son of Suppiluliuma, led a Hittite army into Mitanni. According to Hittite sources, Piyashshili and Shattiwaza crossed the Euphrates at Carchemish, then marched against [[Irridu]] in Hurrian territory. They sent messengers from the west bank of the Euphrates and seemed to have expected a friendly welcome, but the people were loyal to their new ruler, influenced, as Suppiluliuma claims, by the riches of Tushratta. "Why are you coming? If you are coming for battle, come, but you shall not return to the land of the Great King!" they taunted. Shuttarna had sent men to strengthen the troops and chariots of the district of Irridu, but the Hittite army won the battle, and the people of Irridu sued for peace.

Meanwhile, an Assyrian army "led by a single charioteer" marched on the capital Washshukanni. It seems that Shuttarna had sought Assyrian aid in the face of the Hittite threat. Possibly the force sent did not meet his expectations, or he changed his mind. In any case, the Assyrian army was refused entrance, and set instead to besiege the capital. This seems to have turned the mood against Shuttarna; perhaps the majority of the inhabitants of Washshukanni decided they were better off with the Hittite Empire than with their former subjects. In any case, a messenger was sent to Piyashshili and Shattiwaza at Irridu, who delivered his message in public, at the city gate. Piyashshili and Shattiwaza marched on Washukanni, and the cities of Harran and Pakarripa seem to have surrendered to them.

While at Pakarripa, a desolate country where the troops suffered hunger, they received word of an Assyrian advance, but the enemy never materialised. The allies pursued the retreating Assyrian troops to Nilap_ini but could not force a confrontation. The Assyrians seem to have retreated home in the face of the superior force of the Hittites.

Shattiwaza became king of Mitanni, but after Suppililiuma had taken Carchemish and the land west of the Euphrates, that were governed by his son Piyashshili, Mitanni was restricted to the Khabur River and [[Balikh River]] valleys, and became more and more dependent on their allies in [[Hattarsus]]. Some scholars speak of a Hittite puppet kingdom, a buffer-state against the powerful Assyria.

Assyria under [[Ashur-uballit I]] began to infringe on Mitanni as well. Its vassal state of [[Nuzi]] east of the Tigris was conquered and destroyed. According to the Hittitologist [[Trevor R. Bryce]], Mitanni (or Hanigalbat as it was known) was permanently lost to Assyria during the reign of [[Mursili III]] of the Hittites, who was defeated by the Assyrians in the process. Its loss was a major blow to Hittite prestige in the ancient world and undermined the young king's authority over his kingdom.

===Shattuara I===
{{Main|Shattuara}}

The royal inscriptions of the Assyrian king [[Adad-nirari I]] (c. 1307&amp;ndash;1275 BC) relate how the vassal king [[Shattuara]] of Mitanni rebelled and committed hostile acts against Assyria. How this Shattuara was related to the dynasty of Partatama is unclear. Some scholars think that he was the second son of Artatama II, and the brother of Shattiwazza's one-time rival Shuttarna. Adad-nirari claims to have captured King Shattuara and brought him to Ashur, where he took an oath as a vassal. Afterwards, he was allowed to return to Mitanni, where he paid Adad-nirari regular tribute. This must have happened during the reign of the Hittite King [[Mursili II]], but there is no exact date.

===Wasashatta===
{{Main|Wasashatta}}
Despite Assyrian strength, Shattuara's son [[Wasashatta]] attempted to rebel. He sought Hittite help, but that kingdom was preoccupied with internal struggles, possibly connected with the usurpation of [[Hattusili III]], who had driven his nephew [[Mursili III|Urhi-Teshup]] into exile. The Hittites took Wasashatta's money but did not help, as Adad-nirari's inscriptions gleefully note.

The Assyrians expanded further, and conquered the royal city of [[Taite|Taidu]], and took [[Washshukannu]], [[Amasakku]], [[Tell Barri|Kahat]], [[Shuru, Fars|Shuru]], [[Nabula]], [[Hurra, Syria|Hurra]] and [[Shuduhu]] as well. They conquered [[Irridu]], destroyed it utterly and [[salting the earth|sowed salt over it]].
The wife, sons and daughters of Wasashatta were taken to [[Ashur]], together with much booty and other prisoners. As Wasashatta himself is not mentioned, he must have escaped capture. There are letters of Wasashatta in the Hittite archives. Some scholars think he became ruler of a reduced Mitanni state called [[Shubria]].

While [[Adad-nirari I]] conquered the Mitanni heartland between the [[Balikh]] and the [[Khabur (Euphrates)|Khabur]] from the [[Hittites]], he does not seem to have crossed the Euphrates, and [[Carchemish]] remained part of the Hittite kingdom. With his victory over Mitanni, Adad-nirari claimed the title of Great King (''sharru rabû'') in letters to the Hittite rulers.

===Shattuara II===
{{Main|Shattuara II}}

In the reign of [[Shalmaneser I]] (1270s&amp;ndash;1240s) King [[Shattuara]] of Mitanni, a son or nephew of Wasahatta, rebelled against the Assyrian yoke with the help of the Hittites and the nomadic [[Ahlamu]] ([[Arameans]]) around 1250 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Bryce 2005, p. 314&lt;/ref&gt; His army was well prepared; they had occupied all the mountain passes and waterholes, so that the Assyrian army suffered from thirst during their advance.

Nevertheless, Shalmaneser I won a crushing victory for Assyria over the Hittites and Mitanni. He claims to have slain 14,400 men; the rest were blinded and carried away. His inscriptions mention the conquest of nine fortified temples; 180 Hurrian cities were "turned into rubble mounds", and Shalmaneser "…slaughtered like sheep the armies of the Hittites and the Ahlamu his allies…". The cities from Taidu to [[Irridu]] were captured, as well as all of mount Kashiar to Eluhat and the fortresses of Sudu and Harranu to Carchemish on the Euphrates. Another inscription mentions the construction of a temple to the Assyrian god [[Adad]]/[[Hadad]] in Kahat, a city of Mitanni that must have been occupied as well.

===Hanigalbat as an Assyrian province===
A part of the population was deported and served as cheap labour. Administrative documents mention barley allotted to "uprooted men", deportees from Mitanni. For example, the Assyrian governor of the city [[Nahur]], [[Meli-Sah]] received barley to be distributed to deported persons from [[Shuduhu]] "as seed, food for their oxen and for themselves".
The Assyrians built a line of frontier fortifications against the Hittites on the [[Balikh River]].

Mitanni was now ruled by the Assyrian grand-vizier [[Ilī-padâ]], a member of the royal family, who took the title of king (''sharru'') of Hanigalbat. He resided in the newly built Assyrian administrative centre at [[Tell Sabi Abyad]], governed by the Assyrian steward [[Tammitte]]. Assyrians maintained not only military and political control, but seem to have dominated trade as well, as no Hurrian or Mitanni names appear in private records of Shalmaneser's time.

Under the Assyrian king [[Tukulti-Ninurta I]] (c. 1243&amp;ndash;1207 BC) there were again numerous deportations from Hanigalbat (east Mitanni) to Ashur, probably in connection with the construction of a new palace. As the royal inscriptions mention an invasion of Hanigalbat by a Hittite king, there may have been a new rebellion, or at least native support of a Hittite invasion. The Mitanni towns may have been sacked at this time, as destruction levels have been found in some excavations that cannot be dated with precision, however. [[Tell Sabi Abyad]], seat of the Assyrian government in Mitanni in the times of Shalmaneser, was deserted between 1200 and 1150 BC.

In the time of [[Ashur-nirari III]] (c. 1200 BC, the beginning [[Bronze Age collapse]]), the [[Phrygians]] and others invaded and destroyed the [[Hittite Empire]], already weakened by defeats against Assyria. Some parts of Assyrian-ruled Hanigalbat was temporarily lost to the Phrygians also; however, the Assyrians defeated the Phrygians and regained these colonies. The Hurrians still held [[Katmuhu]] and [[Paphu]]. In the transitional period to the [[Early Iron Age]], Mitanni was settled by invading [[Aramaeans]].

==Indo-Aryan superstrate==

{{main|Indo-Aryan superstrate in Mitanni}}
Some theonyms, proper names and other terminology of the Mitanni exhibit close similarities to [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]], suggesting that an [[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]] elite imposed itself over the [[Hurrian]] population in the course of the [[Indo-Aryan migration|Indo-Aryan expansion]]. In a treaty between the [[Hittites]] and the Mitanni, the deities [[Mitra]], [[Varuna]], [[Indra]], and [[Nasatya]] ([[Asvins|Ashvins]]) are invoked. [[Kikkuli]]'s horse training text includes technical terms such as ''aika'' (''eka'', one), ''tera'' (''tri'', three), ''panza'' (''pancha'', five), ''satta'' (''sapta'', seven), ''na'' (''nava'', nine), ''vartana'' (''vartana'', turn, round in the horse race). The numeral aika "one" is of particular importance because it places the superstrate in the vicinity of Indo-Aryan proper as opposed to Indo-Iranian or early Iranian (which has "aiva") in general.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Thieme, The 'Aryan' Gods of the Mitanni Treaties. JAOS 80, 1960, 301-17&lt;/ref&gt;

Another text has ''babru'' (''babhru'', brown), ''parita'' (''palita'', grey), and ''pinkara'' (''pingala'', red). Their chief festival was the celebration of the [[solstice]] (''vishuva'') which was common in most cultures in the ancient world. The Mitanni warriors were called ''marya'', the term for warrior in [[Sanskrit]] as well; note mišta-nnu (= miẓḍha,~ Sanskrit mīḍha) "payment (for catching a fugitive)".&lt;ref&gt;(M. Mayrhofer, Etymologisches Wörterbuch des Altindoarischen Heidelberg 1986-2000; Vol. II 358)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanskritic interpretations of Mitanni royal names render Artashumara (artaššumara) as Arta-smara "who thinks of Arta/Ṛta",&lt;ref&gt;(Mayrhofer II 780)&lt;/ref&gt; Biridashva (biridašṷa, biriiašṷa) as Prītāśva "whose horse is dear",&lt;ref&gt;Mayrhofer II 182&lt;/ref&gt; Priyamazda (priiamazda) as Priyamedha "whose wisdom is dear",&lt;ref&gt;(Mayrhofer II 189, II378)&lt;/ref&gt; Citrarata as citraratha "whose chariot is shining",&lt;ref&gt;(Mayrhofer I 553)&lt;/ref&gt; Indaruda/Endaruta as Indrota "helped by Indra",&lt;ref&gt;(Mayrhofer I 134)&lt;/ref&gt; Shativaza (šattiṷaza) as Sātivāja "winning the race price",&lt;ref&gt;(Mayrhofer II 540, 696)&lt;/ref&gt; Šubandhu as Subandhu "having good relatives",{{refn|group=note|a name in Palestine&lt;ref&gt;Mayrhofer II 209, 735&lt;/ref&gt;}} Tushratta (tṷišeratta, tušratta, etc.) as *tṷaiašaratha, Vedic [[Tvastr]] "whose chariot is vehement".&lt;ref&gt;(Mayrhofer, Etym.

==Legacy==
{{main|Urartu}}
Within a few centuries of the fall of Washshukanni to Assyria, Mitanni became fully [[Assyria]]nized and linguistically [[Aramaic language|Aramaized]], and use of the Hurrian language began to be discouraged throughout the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]]. However, [[Urartian language|Urartean]], a dialect closely related to Hurrian seems to have survived in the new state of [[Urartu]], in the mountainous areas to the north in their [[Armenian Highlands]].{{refn|group=note|Jacquetta Hawkes, ''The First Great Civilizations'' "Yet the Hurrians did not disappear from history. Away to the North in their Armenian homeland, they entrenched themselves and build up the kingdom of Urartu."; M. Chahin, ''The Kingdom of Armenia,'' "The new kingdom of Urartu, which proved to be the stronghold of the Hurrian race."}} 
In the 10th to 9th century BC inscriptions of [[Adad-nirari II]] and [[Shalmaneser III]], ''Hanigalbat'' is still used as a geographical term.

'''Mona Seif''' ({{lang-arz|منى سيف}}, {{IPA-arz|ˈmonæ ˈseːf|IPA}}) is an Egyptian [[human rights]] activist known for her participation in dissident movements during and after the [[2011 Egyptian revolution]],&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt; for her creative use of social media&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com/2011/06/16/cnn%E2%80%99s-amber-lyon-reports-on-the-digital-roots-of-the-%E2%80%98arab-spring%E2%80%99/ |title=CNN’s Amber Lyon Reports on the Digital Roots of the ‘Arab Spring’ – CNN Press Room - CNN.com Blogs |publisher=Cnnpressroom.blogs.cnn.com |date= 2011-06-16|accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in campaigns, and for her work to end military trials for civilian protesters. She is a biology graduate student, investigating the [[BRCA1]] breast cancer gene.

==Background==
Seif grew up in a family of activists, and politics was a constant topic of discussion during her childhood. Her father, [[Ahmed Seif El-Islam|Ahmed Seif]], who died in 2014, was a human rights attorney and opposition leader who spent five years in prison during the Mubarak regime. During his detention, he was tortured. Her mother, [[Laila Soueif]], is also an activist and a mathematics professor.  She helped organize demonstrations against the Mubarak regime over the decades before his downfall.  Her mother is "known on the streets as brash and courageous, and has on numerous occasions faced down baton-wielding policemen with nothing but her scolding, scathing, booming voice and steely eyes".&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

Seif's brother [[Alaa Abd El-Fattah]] co-created the Egyptian blog aggregator ''Manalaa'' and in 2005 began to document abuses by the Mubarak regime.  Alaa was arrested at a demonstration in 2006 and imprisoned for 45 days, during which Mona and his wife Manal helped organize an online campaign to free him.  Seif's younger sister, Sanaa Seif, has also been an opposition activist and protester.&lt;ref name=cnn&gt;{{cite news|author=Scott Bronstein, CNN Special Investigations Unit |url=http://www.cnn.com/2011/WORLD/meast/06/16/arab.unrest.irevolution/ |title=For Egyptian online warrior, father's torture fueled activism |publisher=CNN.com |date= 2011-06-16|accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seif is a graduate student in cancer biology. She is studying the [[BRCA1]] breast cancer gene and its mutation pattern in Egyptian patients. She says she has two full-time careers: one in cancer research, and another in human rights activism.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.onthemedia.org/2011/apr/15/state-run-newspapers-and-mona-seif/transcript/ State Run Newspapers and Mona Seif] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111113124617/http://www.onthemedia.org/2011/apr/15/state-run-newspapers-and-mona-seif/transcript/ |date=2011-11-13 }}, On the Media, Brooke Gladstone, April 15, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://ma3t.blogspot.com/2012/11/the-happy-scientist-me.html The happy scientist ME], blog entry, ma3t, November 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==2011 revolution==
[[File:Noor Ayman &amp; Mona Seif.jpg|thumb|right|Nour ([[Ayman Nour]]'s son) &amp; Mona Seif.]]
In the year leading up to the revolution Mona became involved in the dissident movement, spreading awareness and attending demonstrations. Between January 25 and February 5, the members of her immediate family and many members of their extended family participated in the Tahrir Square protests. Mona recalls "It was a life-changing moment for most of the people in Tahrir Square. You could see the gunshots at people...".&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

Seif is a founding member of ''No to Military Trials for Civilians'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://en.nomiltrials.com/ |title=No Military Trials for Civilians |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; a group pushing for the release of those detained during the revolution; and end to trials of civilians by military courts; transfer of all such civilian facing trial to the jurisdiction of civilian courts; and the investigation of torture allegations involving military police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.almasryalyoum.com/en/node/467893 |title=Military promises activists it will review military trials of civilians &amp;#124; Al-Masry Al-Youm: Today's News from Egypt |publisher=Al-Masry Al-Youm |date=2011-06-01 |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/64/14285/Egypt/Politics-/Egypt%E2%80%99s-ruling-military-makes-promises-to-No-to-Mi.aspx |title=Egypt’s ruling military makes promises to No to Military Trials campaigners - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date= |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedailynewsegypt.com/human-a-civil-rights/scaf-promises-to-reconsider-military-trials.html |title=SCAF promises to reconsider military trials |publisher=Thedailynewsegypt.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2011/06/14/137176946/egypts-secret-military-trials-erode-activists-trust |title=Egypt's Secret Military Trials Erode Activists' Trust |publisher=NPR |date= |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hennessy |first=Molly |url=http://www.latimes.com/news/nationworld/world/la-fg-egypt-prisoners-20110527,0,5482207.story |title=Egypt democracy protests: Egyptian activists plan protests over military trials |publisher=latimes.com |date=2011-05-27 |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Seif wrote on her blog ''Ma3t'', about the military police during crackdowns on Tahrir protesters, requesting people come forward with their stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedailynewsegypt.com/human-a-civil-rights/bloggers-slam-army-council-in-anti-scaf-blogging-day.html |title=Bloggers slam army council in anti-SCAF blogging day |publisher=Thedailynewsegypt.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

She has been critical of the actions of Egypt's interim ruling body the [[Supreme Council of the Armed Forces]] (SCAF) saying, of the release of protesters without full exoneration:  “The fact that they have suspended sentences does not give them the pride they deserve as revolutionaries who did nothing wrong."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/~/NewsContent/1/64/12804/Egypt/Politics-/Majority-of-activists-in-military-prisons-released.aspx |title=Majority of activists in military prisons released, criticism of SCAF continues - Politics - Egypt - Ahram Online |publisher=English.ahram.org.eg |date=2011-05-24 |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Seif estimates that military courts have sentenced 7,000 civilians since former [[Hosni Mubarak]]'s ouster in February, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/163380/20110615/egypt-brazil-military-regime-authoritarian-coup-prison-jail-7k-7000-trials.htm |title=Egyptian military government jails 7,000 civilians |publisher=Ibtimes.com |date= |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sabry |first=Mohannad |url=http://www.miamiherald.com/2011/06/13/2265178/new-egypt-7000-civilians-jailed.html |title=New Egypt? 7,000 civilians jailed since Mubarak fell - World Wires |publisher=MiamiHerald.com |date=2011-06-13 |accessdate=2011-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;  She notes that there has been a shift in the SCAF's approach since March and that protesters are now getting suspended sentences rather than the 3-5-year sentences they were previously getting.  She speculates that this may be an attempt to stop the regular marches and may also be due to the pressure applied by international human right groups.

She has continued to criticize tactics of the SCAF: "We have evidence that the military right now is targeting protesters. ... They selected known figures of the Tahrir protest. They selected people who were known and they tortured and beat them up...and if you read or listen to the testimonies of those who were released, which are a few, we still have a lot of people detained unconstitutionally. And you see that it's not just that they're getting tortured or beaten up, but there's an element of the Army trying to break the revolutionary spirit."&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

Part of Seif's project involves asking detainees who have been released to record what happened to them. In some cases she says she has managed to get their testomies immediately after their release and so record bruise marks and burns.  It is Seif's opinion that with these cases the only way to fight them is via the internet.&lt;ref name=cnn/&gt;

In 2012, she was a finalist for the [[Front Line Award for Human Rights Defenders at Risk]], which ultimately went to Syrian blogger [[Razan Ghazzawi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frontlinedefenders.org/front-line-award-human-rights-defenders-risk |title=The Front Line Defenders Award |year=2012 |publisher=Front Line |accessdate=20 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120607004952/http://www.frontlinedefenders.org/front-line-award-human-rights-defenders-risk |archivedate=7 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
When it was announced in April 2013 that Seif was a finalist for the [[Martin Ennals Award for Human Rights Defenders]] presented by [[Human Rights Watch]], both she and HRW were criticised for what some considered taking a firm pro-Palestinian stance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://english.al-akhbar.com/node/15693 |title=Egyptian activist faces pro-Israel backlash after award nomination |date=2 May 2013 |publisher=Al Akhbar |accessdate=2014-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; The specific accusations, made by  the pro-Zionist [[UN WATCH]] were that she tweeted support for violence in the form of attacks on the Egypt-Israel-Jordan gas pipeline; invasion of the Israeli embassy in Cairo and missile attacks on Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blog.unwatch.org/index.php/2013/05/01/tweets-for-hatred-mona-seif-nominee-for-2013-martin-ennals-human-rights-award/ |title=Tweets for Hatred: Mona Seif, Nominee for 2013 Martin Ennals Human Rights Award |date=1 May 2013 |publisher=UN Watch |accessdate=2014-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; The accusations were examined and dismissed in detail by [[Scott Long]], who denied the 3 tweets, of 93,000 examined, showed any evidence whatsoever of support for violence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Scott Long]], [https://paper-bird.net/2013/05/03/hillel-neuer-liar-mona-seif-hero/ Hillel Neuer: Liar.

'''Paulo Autuori de Mello''' (born 25 August 1956), known as '''Paulo Autuori''', is a Brazilian [[association football|football]] coach who is the manager of [[Categoría Primera A]] club [[Atlético Nacional]].

==Early life==
A football fan since early childhood and a [[futsal]] player, Paulo Autuori had to give up his dream of becoming a professional footballer after contracting [[poliomyelitis]] in his teens. The disease left him with an [[Atrophy|atrophied]] leg and a permanent limp on his walk, which prevented him from playing. However, he did not give up his dream of being part of the footballing world, and decided to learn other aspects of the game. Autuori worked as a physical coach for clubs such as [[Associação Atlética Portuguesa (RJ)|Portuguesa (RJ)]], and [[CD Nacional|Nacional]] in Portugal. At Nacional, Paulo Autuori was promoted to manager of the main team, and has enjoyed a successful coaching career ever since.&lt;ref&gt;http://terceirotempo.bol.uol.com.br/quefimlevou/qfl/sobre/paulo-autuori-4351.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Autuori graduated in [[Physical Education]] at [[Universidade Castelo Branco]]; and attended a Sport Admninstration course at [[PUC-RJ]] and a Soccer Coach Course at [[UERJ]].

==Managing career==
Autuori coached some teams from [[Portugal]]: Nacional, [[Vitória de Guimarães]], [[CS Marítimo|Marítimo]] and [[S.L. Benfica|Benfica]]; from Brazil: Portuguesa (RJ), [[Botafogo de Futebol e Regatas|Botafogo]], [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro]], [[Clube de Regatas do Flamengo|Flamengo]], [[Sport Club Internacional|Internacional]], [[Santos Futebol Clube|Santos]] and [[São Paulo Futebol Clube|São Paulo]]; and from [[Peru]]: [[Alianza Lima]], [[Sporting Cristal]] and the [[Peru national football team|Peru national team]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zerozero.pt/treinador.php?id=339|title=Paulo Autuori|work=www.zerozero.pt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of April 2005, just before quitting Peru, he was hired by [[São Paulo Futebol Clube|São Paulo FC]] to replace [[Émerson Leão]], who had just gone to [[Japan]]. In that year, he won the [[Copa Libertadores 2005]] and the [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://br.sambafoot.com/treinadores/1070_Paulo_Autuori.html Profile on sambafoot.com.br] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090525111207/http://br.sambafoot.com/treinadores/1070_Paulo_Autuori.html |date=2009-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 December 2005, he resigned São Paulo to sign with [[Kashima Antlers]], from [[Japan]]. At the end of 2006 he announced his new club as [[Cruzeiro Esporte Clube|Cruzeiro E.C.]], this was his third time at the club.&lt;ref&gt;[http://de.fifa.com/tournaments/archive/tournament=107/edition=4735/news/newsid=98872.html FIFA.com – Paulo Autuori: ein unermüdlicher Trophäensammler]&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 November 2009, Paulo Autuori has decided to leave [[Gremio]], after have reached an agreement with the club. [[Gremio]] decided to let free the manager, because they can't win the championship title.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clicrbs.com.br/esportes/rs/noticias/futebol-gremio,2713460,Paulo-Autuori-ja-esta-fora-do-Gremio.html|title=Paulo Autuori já está fora do Grêmio|work=ZH 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 21 November 2009, Qatar League side [[Al Rayyan Sports Club|Al Rayyan]] have replaced Brazilian coach Marcus Paqueta with his compatriot Paulo Autuori. The latter only left the club six months ago to join Gremio in his homeland, but has made a swift return after signing a three-year contract.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://globoesporte.globo.com/Esportes/Noticias/Futebol/0,,MUL1483902-9842,00-PAULO+AUTUORI+PEDE+DEMISSAO+NO+INTERVALO+DE+JOGO+E+DEIXA+CLUBE+NO+QATAR.html|title=Globoesporte.com &gt; Futebol Internacional - NOTÍCIAS - Paulo Autuori pede demissão no intervalo de jogo e deixa clube no Qatar|work=globo.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Paulo Autuori became the coach of the Qatar Olympic team on 27 August 2011. He replaced Frenchman [[Bernard Simondi]]. His first assignment was to lead the team during the 2012 London Olympics Qualification stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dohastadiumplusqatar.com/autuori-qatars-olympic-team-coach/|title=Autuori is new coach of Qatar Olympic team - Doha Stadium Plus|work=dohastadiumplusqatar.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 February 2012 The 55-year-old Brazilian became the fourth manager of the Qatar national team in the previous year, but is full of confidence they can progress towards the 2014 World Cup.
[http://www.goal.com/en-ie/news/3908/main/2012/02/20/2916846/qatar-announces-paulo-autuori-as-new-national-coach] He was fired on 15 January 2013 after his team failed to progress in [[2013 Gulf Cup of Nations]].

After being dismissed from [[Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama|Vasco da Gama]], on 10 July 2013, Autuori signed with [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]]. In 2005, as coach for [[São Paulo FC|''Tricolor'']], he won two important titles: [[Copa Libertadores 2005]] and [[2005 FIFA Club World Championship]]. This time, however, Autuori is arriving in [[São Paulo]] to solve a crisis, the club losing its five last games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.goal.com/br/news/805/transfer%C3%AAncias/2013/07/11/4109162/interino-do-s%C3%A3o-paulo-confirma-paulo-autuori|title=Interino do São Paulo confirma Paulo Autuori|work=Goal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the following day, Autuori was introduced as the new coach despite the preference of many fans, who wanted [[Muricy Ramalho]]'s return.  The new coach of [[São Paulo FC|São Paulo]] said that, if the choice were his he would have signed Ramalho who Autuori considered a "winner". Autuori affirmed that he felt "a lot of satisfaction to return to this glorious institution, with big aims."  The former [[Club de Regatas Vasco da Gama|''vascaíno'']] coach said that "I have not come to be loved; I have come to be champion."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gazetaesportiva.net/noticia/2013/07/sao-paulo/nao-vim-para-ser-amado-diz-autuori-que-votaria-em-muricy.html|title="Não vim para ser amado", diz Autuori, que votaria em Muricy|work=Gazetaesportiva.Net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even in a middle of a crisis, Autuori has improved the ambient in [[São Paulo FC]], a bad one in comparison to period that [[Ney Franco]] was the coach. The [[Lucimar da Silva Ferreira|Lúcio]]'s removal from staff, according some people of club, was essential for this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esporte.uol.com.br/futebol/campeonatos/brasileiro/serie-a/ultimas-noticias/2013/08/24/mesmo-em-crise-autuori-cria-bom-clima-no-sp-e-agrada-elenco.htm|title=Mesmo em crise, Autuori cria clima bom no SP e agrada elenco|work=uol.com.br}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 9 September 2013, Autuori was dismissed by directors of [[São Paulo FC]] after the 2–0 loss against [[Coritiba FC]], a result that kept the club in relegation zone of [[2013 Campeonato Brasileiro Série A|Brazilian League]]. In a report from official site of club, there is a praising about his work. His substitute is [[Muricy Ramalho]], that, ironically, also replaced him in 2006 in [[São Paulo FC|club from Morumbi Stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saopaulofc.net/noticias/noticias/sao-paulo-fc/2013/9/9/sao-paulo-substitui-comando-de-autuori-pelo-de-muricy/|title=São Paulo Futebol Clube|work=saopaulofc.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 5 June 2018 Autuori was announced as the new Director of football in the Bulgarian champion [[PFC Ludogorets Razgrad|Ludogorets Razgrad]], but on the next day he was presented as the new manager of the team, since [[Dimitar Dimitrov (football manager)|Dimitar Dimitrov]] wanted to leave the club.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.sportal.bg/news.php?news=728437 Официално: Херо напусна Лудогорец, "орлите" обявиха неговия заместник (видео)]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Born to an [[Indian Air Force]] officer, he accompanied his parents with their postings at various Indian cities. As a consequence his education was cross cultural and spread across various regions in India and the schools he studied in include Frank Anthony School in [[Agra]], Bishops School in [[Pune]], Jesus and Mary School in [[Amritsar]] before completing his high schooling from [[The Air Force School (Subroto Park)|The Air Force School]] in [[New Delhi]]. He subsequently completed his professional education from [[Lal Bahadur Shastri College of Advanced Maritime Studies and Research|LBS College of Advanced Maritime Studies and Research]] as a certified Master Mariner, having earlier completed his professional training at the [[Training Ship Rajendra|TS Rajendra]].

==Career==
In 1982 Kohli commenced his career as a [[merchant mariner|mariner]] and was later master of oceangoing ships for the final 15 years. Amongst others, he was the [[Master mariner|master]] and [[Captain (nautical)|captain]] of one of the world's largest refrigerated cross-ocean carriers ([[reefer ship]]s). Besides refrigerated transportation, he also directed or operated [[car carrier]]s, [[oil tankers]], [[container ships]], ice-class [[General cargo ship|general cargo]]carriers, timber carriers and others.

Between 2008 and 2012 Capt. Kohli contributed through professional executive roles as the prime mover in one of the largest logistics and distribution companies in India and later for the integration of the largest logistics &amp; supply chain infrastructure enterprises, heading the development of solutions to drive a pan-national footprint of India's first set of [[Free trade zone|Free Trade Zones]].

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Eminent persons from private industry in Indian Government.jpg|thumb|List of Eminent people in government service, article in Business Standard Newspaper, 16 July 2013]] --&gt;
In 2012 he was selected to help the Government of India incubate the [[National Centre for Cold-chain Development]] (NCCD) as their founding Chief Advisor. At NCCD, Kohli was closely involved in establishing a historic MoU of cooperation in cold chain between nodal Indian and French organisations and represented India as guest of honor at the International Conference on sustainable cold chain in Paris (April 2013).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ubifrance.com/in/Posts-7047-An-Indo-French-agreement-to-reinforce-cooperation-in-the-cold-chain-expertise|title=An Indo-French agreement to reinforce cooperation in the cold chain expertise}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.prlog.org/12108276-india-is-guest-of-honor-at-international-cold-chain-conference-in-paris.html|title=India is Guest of Honor at International Cold chain Conference in Paris}}&lt;/ref&gt; In July 2015 he was invited as a global expert to speak on the Global Food Crisis at the [[House of Lords]] in UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/ranisingh/2015/08/12/without-cooling-most-modern-society-would-crumble-says-cold-chain-expert-pawanexh-kohli|title=Without Cooling, Most Modern Society Would Crumble}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dearman.co.uk/#!Sustainably-Meeting-the-Global-Food-Crisis/ccrp/558a742d0cf20d45521c45c1|title=Sustainably Meeting the Global Food Crisis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rashid Yakhyayevich Gaysanov''' ({{lang-ru|Рашид Яхьяевич Гайсанов}}; born 17 September 1972), last name also spelled '''Gaisanov''', is a [[Russia]]n [[politician]] in the southern [[Ingushetia|Republic of Ingushetia]]. He has served as the [[Prime Minister]] of Ingushetia under Ingush President [[Yunus-bek Yevkurov]].  He was further appointed the acting [[President of Ingushetia]] following an assassination attempt against Yevkurov in June 2009.&lt;ref name=RIA&gt;{{cite news|last=|first=|coauthors=|title=Gaysanov will govern Ingushetia as necessary|work=|place=|pages=|language=Russian|publisher=[[RIA Novosti]]|date=2009-06-22|url=http://www.rian.ru/politics/20090622/175080867.html|accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Russian government of [[Dmitry Medvedev]] appointed Gaysanov as the acting [[President of Ingushetia]] by [[presidential decree]]&lt;ref name=gs&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Ingush president regains consciousness after attack|url=http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/library/news/2009/07/mil-090703-rianovosti05.htm|work=[[RIA Novosti]]|publisher=GlobalSecurity.org|date=2009-07-03 |accessdate=2010-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; following the [[assassination]] attempt against President Yunus-bek Yevkurov in June 2009.&lt;ref name=mia&gt;{{cite news|first=|last=|title=Ten Chechen police killed in Russian Caucasus|url=http://www.mia.com.mk/default.aspx?mId=41&amp;vId=65942875&amp;lId=2&amp;title=BULLETINS+-+NEWSLETTER |work=[[Macedonian Information Agency]]|publisher=|date=2009-08-13 |accessdate=2009-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bombing left Yevkurov in a coma for two weeks after the bombing and unable to govern.&lt;ref name=mia/&gt;

Gaysanov's appointment as acting president was seen as an attempt by the Kremlin to halt potential [[political infighting]].

Rashid Gaysanov was the acting President of Ingushetia.

'''Raymond Harvey''' (March 1, 1920 – November 18, 1996) was a [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] in the [[United States Army]] who served during [[World War II]] and the [[Korean War]]. He received the [[Medal of Honor]] for his actions on March 9, 1951.

==Military Service==
Harvey enlisted in the [[United States Army]] on August 16, 1939.

===World War II===
During World War II, he served in the [[79th Infantry Division (United States)|79th Infantry Division]], landing in [[Normandy, France]] one week after the [[Invasion of Normandy]] and participating in the division's campaigns in northern [[France]] and [[Germany]]. Harvey was decorated for valor several times, earning the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]] (second only to the Medal of Honor), two [[Silver Stars]], two [[Bronze Star]]s and two [[Purple Heart]]s.

===Korean War===
After World War II ended, Harvey entered the Army's Organized Reserve, and returned to active duty in 1948.  He was serving with the [[7th Infantry Division (United States)|7th Infantry Division]] in 1950 when the [[Korean War]] began, and landed with the division at [[Battle of Inchon|Inchon]], Korea in September 1950.  Shortly after the landing, and before the Chinese counterattack in November 1950, Harvey took command of the division's Company C, [[17th Infantry Regiment (United States)|17th Infantry Regiment]].

Harvey was in command of the company the following March, when it led the attack of 1st Battalion, 17th Infantry Regiment on Hill 1232 near Taemi-Dong, where Harvey would earn the [[Medal of Honor]]. On that day, Harvey commanding Company C of the 17th Infantry Regiment, received orders to lead the attack on Hill 1232 overlooking Taemi-dong. But [[North Korea]]n machine gun nests canvassed the hillside inside fortifications. Harvey and his men were soon pinned down under a hail of North Korean machine gun fire.

Suddenly, Harvey charged up the hill alone in the face of enemy fire. Harvey tossed grenades into the first pillbox he got to, killing those inside. Then Harvey advanced on the next [[entrenchment (fortification)|entrenchment]] and dispatched all five occupants with his [[M1 carbine]]. The men of Company C eventually joined Harvey, only to watch their commander charge the next machine gun nest. He single-handedly wiped out gunners in another fortification while taking a bullet to the chest.

Eyewitnesses then saw Harvey, bleeding and probably moving on [[adrenaline]], crawl toward another enemy stronghold disguised with logs. He burst upon them with his carbine. Unable to move, he ordered his men to complete the mission with a final push. Harvey refused medical care until Hill 1232 had been taken.

Wounded in the battle, Harvey was presented a third Silver Star while in the aid station, for bravery in the fall 1950 campaign after the Inchon landings.  On July 5, 1951, Harvey was presented the Medal of Honor by President [[Harry S Truman]] at a White House ceremony. Truman called them the "backbone of the government" and the "reason we will win the Cold War." He then added with a touch of reverence that he would rather have that Medal of Honor than be president.

'''Citation:'''

&lt;blockquote&gt;Capt. Harvey Company C, distinguished himself by conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity above and beyond the call of duty in action. When his company was pinned down by a barrage of automatic weapons fire from numerous well-entrenched emplacements, imperiling accomplishment of its mission, Capt. Harvey braved a hail of fire and exploding grenades to advance to the first enemy machine gun nest, killing its crew with grenades. Rushing to the edge of the next emplacement, he killed its crew with carbine fire. He then moved the 1st Platoon forward until it was again halted by a curtain of automatic fire from well fortified hostile positions. Disregarding the hail of fire, he personally charged and neutralized a third emplacement. Miraculously escaping death from intense crossfire, Capt. Harvey continued to lead the assault. Spotting an enemy pillbox well camouflaged by logs, he moved close enough to sweep the emplacement with carbine fire and throw grenades through the openings, annihilating its 5 occupants. Though wounded he then turned to order the company forward, and, suffering agonizing pain, he continued to direct the reduction of the remaining hostile positions, refusing evacuation until assured that the mission would be accomplished. Capt. Harvey's valorous and intrepid actions served as an inspiration to his company, reflecting the utmost glory upon himself and upholding the heroic traditions of the military service.&lt;ref name=AMOHW&gt;{{Cite web

==Later years==
Harvey was assigned by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]] to be military technical adviser to [[Samuel Fuller]] for his [[Korean War]] film ''[[Fixed Bayonets!]]'' (1951).  The two of them struck up a friendship with Harvey also acting as [[technical advisor]] on Fuller's ''[[Verboten!]]'' (1958) and accompanied Fuller and his wife to Europe at the end of the 1950s to scout locations for a projected filming of ''[[The Big Red One]]'' for [[Warner Bros.]] that did not eventuate.&lt;ref&gt;Fuller, Samuel with Christa Lang Fuller and Jerome Henry Rudes. ''A Third Face : My Tale of Writing, Fighting and Filmmaking''. New York: A. Knopf, 2002&lt;/ref&gt;  Harvey remained in the Army after the Korean War and rose to the rank of [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] before retiring in 1962.  After retirement, he was employed by the [[Northrop Corporation]], then worked as an investment banker, and then served as Director of Indian Affairs for the Arizona Division of Emergency Services. He retired fully after a stroke in 1981.

He died in 1996 at the age of 76 and is buried with full military honors at [[Arlington National Cemetery]], [[Arlington County, Virginia]].

[[File:Unterzeichnung des Koalitionsvertrages der 18. Wahlperiode des Bundestages (Martin Rulsch) 079.jpg|thumb|upright|Current German Chancellor, Angela Merkel is Lutheran.]]

Most [[German Chancellor]]s have been followers of a [[Christianity|Christian church]]. German society has been affected by a [[Religion in Germany|Catholic-Protestant divide]] since the [[Protestant Reformation]], and the same effect is visible in this list of German Chancellors. It is largely dominated by [[Roman Catholics]] and [[Lutherans]] as these remain the main confessions in the country.

The current German Chancellor, [[Angela Merkel]], is a [[Lutheran]] [[Protestant]] within the [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Church]].

==Details==
Most of Germany's chancellors have been either [[Lutherans]] or [[Roman Catholics]]. A significant portion of [[Protestant]] chancellors belonged to the [[Prussian Union of churches]], which united the Reformed and Lutheran confessions throughout the [[Kingdom of Prussia]], and was in force since 1817. Some Roman Catholic chancellors came from the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic Centre Party]]. The [[Christian Democratic Union (Germany)|Christian Democratic Union]], a party of both Roman Catholics and Protestants, produced both kinds of chancellors. One chancellor, namely [[Philipp Scheidemann]], was [[Reformed]] (Calvinist).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.deutsche-biographie.de/sfz111363.html Scheidemann, Philipp Heinrich]&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there were some religiously sceptic chancellors, most never officially renounced their faith and were given a Christian funeral. [[Hermann Müller (politician)|Hermann Müller]], a [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|Social Democrat]] heavily influenced by his father-an advocate of [[Ludwig Feuerbach]]'s views, is the only one notable for not having been a member of any confession  at all. [[Friedrich Ebert]] was baptised a Roman Catholic, but later officially left the denomination&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bundesarchiv.de/aktenreichskanzlei/1919-1933/1021/lut/lut1p/kap1_2/kap2_32/para3_1.html Federal Archives, files of the Reich chancellery, Friedrich Ebert's death]&lt;/ref&gt;. Gustav Bauer is on record as unaffiliated to any recognised religion at least from 1912 to 1924 (thus including his term of office)&lt;ref&gt;See parliamentary handbooks downloadable [http://www.reichstagsprotokolle.de/rtbhauf.html here]&lt;/ref&gt;, but he was buried on a Protestant cemetery&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.stadtmagazinverlag.de/orte/glienicke08/schon-gewusst.htm Gemeinde Glienicke/Nordbahn: Schon fast in Vergessenheit geraten]"&lt;/ref&gt;.

As some chancellors' views are uncertain or causing confusion among researchers, such as these of [[Adolf Hitler]] or [[Joseph Goebbels]], the official religion they were brought up in is only mentioned with a further information on their worldviews, if available. For issues pertaining to Nazi stance on religion, see [[Religion in Nazi Germany]], [[Religious aspects of Nazism]], and [[Religious views of Adolf Hitler]].

'''Richard Earl Mourdock''' (born October 8, 1951) was the 53rd treasurer of the state of [[Indiana]], serving from February 10, 2007, to August 29, 2014.&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youth"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Fox59"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://fox59.com/2014/08/29/state-treasurer-richard-mourdock-submits-resignation-to-gov-pence/|title=State Treasurer Richard Mourdock submits resignation to Gov. Pence|first=Greg|last=Margason|date=August 29, 2014|work=Fox59}}&lt;/ref&gt; Running with the support of the [[Tea Party movement]], he defeated six-term incumbent [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Richard Lugar]] in the May 2012 [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[primary election]]. He lost the [[United States Senate election in Indiana, 2012|November 6, 2012, general election]] for Lugar's seat to Democratic [[United States House of Representatives|U. S. Representative]] [[Joe Donnelly]].&lt;ref name="face"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bw"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/articles/2012-11-06/obama-wins-big-time |title=Obama Wins, Big Time |first=Joshua |last=Green |date=November 6, 2012 |work=Business Week}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early life, education, and business career ==
Mourdock was born in [[Wauseon, Ohio]],&lt;ref name="NPR"/&gt; the son of Dolores Elaine (Bobel) and David Lee Mourdock.&lt;ref&gt;http://birth-records.mooseroots.com/l/7666051/Richard-Earl-Mourdock&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Bucyrus, Ohio]].&lt;ref name="native"/&gt; His father worked as an Ohio State Highway Patrol trooper.&lt;ref name="native"/&gt; Richard graduated from [[Wynford High School]] in Bucyrus in 1969, earned a [[Bachelor of Science]] in natural systems from [[Defiance College]] in 1973 and a [[Master of Arts]] in [[geology]] from [[Ball State University]] in 1975.&lt;ref name="treasurer"/&gt;

After completing his education, Mourdock took a position as a field [[geologist]] with AMAX Coal Company and was working as Surface Mine Geology Project Coordinator the time of his departure from the company in 1979.&lt;ref name="taps"/&gt; From 1979 to 1984, Mourdock was employed by [[Standard Oil of Ohio]] as a senior geologist and ultimately became chief geologist for the company. In 1984, Mourdock accepted a position with Koester Companies in [[Evansville, Indiana]]. For sixteen years, Mourdock served as Vice President of the company's coal subsidiary and eventually became Vice President of Business Development for the parent company. In addition, Mourdock served as a trustee for the company's [[employee-owned corporation|employee stock ownership plan]] (ESOP). After leaving Koester, Mourdock founded and ran his own environmental consulting business, R. E. Mourdock &amp; Associates.&lt;ref name="for state"/&gt;

== Early political career (1988–2002) ==
Mourdock ran in 1988, 1990 and 1992 for the U.S. House of Representatives, seeking to represent [[Indiana's 8th congressional district]]. In 1988, he was defeated in the Republican primary.  In 1990 and 1992, he won the Republican nomination but was defeated by Democrat [[Frank McCloskey]] in the general election, 55–45% and 53–45%, respectively.&lt;ref name="statistics"/&gt;&lt;ref name=1992election/&gt;

From 1995 to 2002, Mourdock served two terms as an elected member of [[Vanderburgh County]] Board of Commissioners,&lt;ref name="urges"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tale"/&gt; the county's executive governing body.&lt;ref name="when knocked"/&gt; In 2002, Mourdock sought the Republican nomination for Indiana Secretary of State—a position chosen at the party's convention. In the three-way contest, Mourdock and fellow conservative Mike Delph split the conservative vote, with the result that the more moderate [[Todd Rokita]] won the nomination&lt;ref name="lines"/&gt; In 2004, Mourdock unsuccessfully sought a seat on the Vanderburgh County Council.&lt;ref name="when knocked"/&gt;

== State Treasurer (2007–2014) ==
In 2006, he ran for Indiana treasurer, winning most of the counties in the northern portion of the state, and defeating Michael W. Griffin, 52%–48%.&lt;ref name="2006 election report"/&gt; Mourdock began his first four-year term in February 2007. In 2009, in his role as state treasurer, he sued to stop the federal [[Effects of the 2008–2010 automotive industry crisis on the United States|bailout of Chrysler]], contending that the bailout plan violated U.S. bankruptcy law by giving more funds to unsecured creditors than it did secured creditors including three Indiana pension funds.&lt;ref name="nyt-pursuits"/&gt;&lt;ref name="races"/&gt; Though the suit was unsuccessful,&lt;ref name="races"/&gt; it helped Mourdock gain national recognition.&lt;ref name="races"/&gt;

Mourdock was re-elected in November 2010 against naval officer [[Pete Buttigieg]], 62%–38%, receiving more than 1,000,000 votes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1/&gt;

Mourdock resigned from his position as treasurer on August 29, 2014, effective immediately.&lt;ref name="Fox59"/&gt; Governor [[Mike Pence]] appointed chief financial officer and chief operating officer of the Indiana Finance Authority Daniel Huge to serve as interim treasurer. Mourdock's resignation came on the last day that state employees could retire before cuts to pension benefits took effect in September 2014.&lt;ref name="Indianapolis Star"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.indystar.com/story/news/politics/2014/08/29/mourdock-resign-state-treasurer-source-says/14808273/|title=Richard Mourdock resigns as Indiana state treasurer|first=Tony|last=Cook|date=August 29, 2014|work=Indianapolis Star}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== 2012 U.S. Senate election ==
{{See also|United States Senate election in Indiana, 2012|Rape and pregnancy controversies in United States elections, 2012}}

On February 22, 2011, Mourdock announced he would challenge incumbent U.S. Senator [[Richard Lugar]] in the 2012 Republican primary.&lt;ref name="announces"/&gt; At the announcement, Mourdock criticized Lugar for his support of the auto bailouts, his votes in favor of the [[DREAM Act]] and the [[New START|START]] treaty and his opposition to [[Earmark (politics)|earmark]] reform.&lt;ref name="announces"/&gt; He said Indiana needed a senator who would return home to hold town halls, and not "a globe-trotting Senator", like Lugar.&lt;ref name="announces"/&gt;&lt;ref name="state"/&gt;  Mourdock later criticized Lugar's record on bipartisanship, his authorship of the 1991 [[Nunn-Lugar]] Act to secure and dismantle [[weapons of mass destruction]] in the former Soviet Union, and the 2006 expansion of the legislation to cover [[conventional weapon]]s stockpiles and secure loose nukes. He called Lugar "President [[Barack Obama|Obama]]'s favorite Republican",&lt;ref name="favorite"/&gt; referring to an October 2008 [[MSNBC]] article titled, "Barack Obama's favorite Republican?", which had described Lugar as a "loyal Republican" while reporting on a 10-day international trip Lugar and then-Senator Obama had taken in 2005 to inspect weapons sites.&lt;ref name="losing"/&gt;&lt;ref name="obama's"/&gt;

At the time he announced his candidacy, Mourdock released a list of 12 Republican state central committee members and 67 GOP county chairs who endorsed him;&lt;ref name="supporting"/&gt; he soon began gathering tea party support as well.  He spoke at over two dozen local tea party gatherings across Indiana where he gained name recognition and support. At a 2011 local tea party convention in [[Greenfield, Indiana]], Mourdock received 96 of the 97 straw poll votes cast.&lt;ref name="seattle"/&gt; In the week before the primary, political action groups such as [[FreedomWorks]], the NRA, [[National Right to Life Committee|National Right to Life]], and 45 local tea party groups held a get-out-the-vote rally for Mourdock&lt;ref name="supporters"/&gt; that was attended by 500 tea party members along with [[Reverend]] [[C.L. Bryant]] and [[Fox News Channel|FOX News]] political commentator [[Michelle Malkin]].&lt;ref name="rally"/&gt; Mourdock addressed the rally praising the support he had been given by FreedomWorks and similar groups, and adding that the tea party movement was very much alive "showing up to work for campaigns."&lt;ref name="outside"/&gt;

During the primary campaign, tea party-backed organizations such as [[Liberty News|Liberty News Network]] and America ReFocused campaigned door to door, sent out mailers and helped sponsor TV and radio ads.&lt;ref name="impact"/&gt; Mourdock's largest contributor was the Club for Growth which accounted for 40% of all outside spending, contributing $2.2 million.&lt;ref name="club"/&gt; According to campaign finance records, some of Mourdock's other top donors and the respective amounts they have contributed are the NRA, $491,000; Citizens United Political Victory Fund, $96,300; and FreedomWorks For America, $437,184.&lt;ref name="struggles"/&gt;

On May 8, 2012, Mourdock defeated Lugar in the primary, capturing just over 60% of the vote.&lt;ref name=primarywin/&gt;&lt;ref name="routed"/&gt; Mourdock's victory was attributed in part to voter dissatisfaction with Lugar's moderate record as well as his absence from Indiana; he had not had a residence in the state since 1977.&lt;ref name="defeated"/&gt; During his concession speech, Lugar criticized Mourdock for having an "unrelenting partisan mind-set" and predicted he would be an ineffective legislator; Mourdock in turn, praised Lugar's record of public service.&lt;ref name="defeated"/&gt; Indiana political analyst Brian Howey ascribed Mourdock's primary win to Republican voters' belief that Lugar was too old and that he had been in Congress too long. Howey also said that "Just 15% ... voted for Mourdock because of his Tea Party ideology."&lt;ref name="trails"/&gt;

Mourdock faced Democratic nominee [[Joe Donnelly]] and Libertarian nominee Andy Horning in the general election. Mourdock said that if elected to the Senate, he would limit himself to two terms.&lt;ref name=principles/&gt;

Mourdock had been endorsed by several conservative interest groups, including the [[Americans for Prosperity]], [[Club for Growth]], [[FreedomWorks]], [[Citizens United (organization)|Citizens United]] and the [[Tea Party Express]], the [[National Rifle Association]] (NRA),&lt;ref name="defeated"/&gt;&lt;ref name="powerful"/&gt;&lt;ref name="freedom"/&gt; and Indiana Right to life.&lt;ref name="anti"/&gt; During the general election campaign, millions of dollars were spent by outside groups supporting both Mourdock and his opponent, Donnelley. Only three other US Senate races reportedly attracted more outside money.&lt;ref name="trails"/&gt;

Although heavily favored to win in a GOP stronghold state, Mourdock lost to Democratic nominee [[Joe Donnelly]] in the general election after the media attention over his comment that "life is that gift from God that I think even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://nbcpolitics.nbcnews.com/_news/2012/11/06/14973899-democrats-make-gains-in-senate-majority | title = Democrats make gains in Senate majority | first = M. Alex | last = Johnson | publisher = NBC News | date = November 7, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political positions ==
===Social Security and Medicare===
Mourdock has questioned the constitutionality of [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid (United States)|Medicaid]], saying to a group of supporters: "I challenge you in [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 8: Powers of Congress|Article I, Section 8]] of the [[United States Constitution]] where those so-called [[Enumerated powers]] are listed. I challenge you to find words that talk about Medicare or Medicaid or, yes, even Social Security."&lt;ref name="constitutionality"/&gt;&lt;ref name="says"/&gt;&lt;ref name="social"/&gt; Mourdock does not support cutting benefits for current Medicare beneficiaries, but he does support a new [[voucher]] plan for those under age 55. Mourdock also believes the age of eligibility for Medicare should be increased from 65 to 67.&lt;ref name="ryan"/&gt;&lt;ref name="cbo"/&gt; Mourdock believes Social Security should be reformed to allow younger workers to invest in personalized retirement accounts.&lt;ref name="personalized"/&gt;&lt;ref name="during"/&gt; and that it will be necessary to increase the retirement age to collect Social Security benefits.&lt;ref name="raising"/&gt;

===Abortion===
As a candidate for Congress in 1992, Mourdock stated that he supported legal abortion in the case of some "crisis pregnancies", but did not believe abortion should be used as a form of birth control.&lt;ref name="woo"/&gt; During his 2012 U.S. Senate race, he reiterated that he opposes abortion except to save the life of the mother.&lt;ref name="under"/&gt; At an October 23, 2012, candidate debate, Mourdock explained why he is opposed to abortion even when the pregnancy is the result of rape:

&lt;blockquote&gt;I, too, certainly stand for life. I know there are some who disagree, and I respect their point of view. But I believe that life begins at conception. The only exception I have, to have an abortion, is in that case of the life of the mother. I've struggled with it myself for a long time, but I came to realize that life is that gift from God. And even when life begins in that horrible situation of rape, that it is something that God intended to happen."&lt;ref name=TPMLW&gt;{{cite web|title=Mourdock: Rape Pregnancies 'Something That God Intended to Happen'|url=http://talkingpointsmemo.com/livewire|website=Talking Points Memo – Live Wire|publisher=TPM Media LLC|accessdate=11 July 2014|ref=TPMLW|date=October 23, 2012 &lt;!-- 8:13 PM EDT --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Dan Parker, chairman of the [[Indiana Democratic Party]], immediately attacked Mourdock, saying that, "I'm stunned and ashamed that Richard Mourdock believes God intended rape", and that he is an "extremist" who is out of touch with Indiana.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Raju|first=Manu|title=Richard Mourdock Under Fire for Rape Remarks|url=http://www.politico.com/blogs/on-congress/2012/10/richard-mourdock-under-fire-for-rape-remarks-139411.html?hp=l1|work=On Congress: Reporting and Analysis of Capitol Hill|date=October 23, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Speculation that Mourdock's remark could affect the outcome of the Senate race&lt;ref name="over"/&gt; centered on attempts to liken his comments to those of [[Todd Akin]].&lt;ref name="at work "/&gt;&lt;ref name="abortion1"/&gt;

Responding to Parker, Mourdock issued a statement saying: "God creates life, and that was my point. God does not want rape, and by no means was I suggesting that he does. Rape is a horrible thing, and for anyone to twist my words otherwise is absurd and sick."&lt;ref name="press release"/&gt;  He later added, "I believe God controls the universe.  I don't believe biology works in an uncontrolled fashion."&lt;ref name="defense"/&gt; A number of Republican officials and candidates, including Sen. [[John McCain]], called for him to issue an apology,&lt;ref name="Lobianco1"/&gt; but Mourdock refused. He instead aired a television ad titled "Leadership" several days after the comments stating that Democrats and Democratic PACs were "mocking Richard Mourdock's religious faith and twisting his words(...) playing politics and distracting from the real issues". One week after the remark, Mourdock was greeted enthusiastically by the attendees of a semiannual dinner for prominent Indiana Republican officials and supporters.&lt;ref name="standby"/&gt;

Mourdock lost to Donnelly by almost 6 percent in the general election.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/1112/83449.html |work=Politico |first=Jennifer |last=Haberkorn |title=Abortion, rape controversy shaped key races |date=November 6, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Federal spending===
Mourdock has called for cuts in federal spending and for a balanced budget.&lt;ref name=guide/&gt; On his website, Mourdock has said that he supports [[The Path to Prosperity|the Ryan Path to Prosperty Plan]]. However, Mourdock has also said that "'Ryan's overall budget proposal might not go far enough, fast enough"; Mourdock would like to shrink government spending by $7.6 trillion in 10 years, (as opposed to Ryan's budget which would cut $5.5 trillion).&lt;ref name="proposal"/&gt;&lt;ref name="budget"/&gt; Mourdock said he would not have supported the [[Troubled Assets Relief Program]]&lt;ref name="nyt-pursuits"/&gt; and opposed the bailout of GM and Chrysler which included measures causing losses to secured bondholders in retirement funds he managed as treasurer.&lt;ref name="fighting"/&gt; He would abolish [[Earmark (politics)|earmarks]].&lt;ref name=principles/&gt;

===Immigration===
Mourdock opposes amnesty for illegal immigrants and opposes the [[DREAM Act]].&lt;ref name="nyt-pursuits"/&gt;&lt;ref name=guide/&gt;

===Views on bipartisanship===
In February 2012, Murdoch told the [[Conservative Political Action Conference]] (CPAC) that bipartisanship has nearly bankrupted the country, and that confrontation, not collegiality was needed.&lt;ref name="bipartisanship"/&gt;&lt;ref name="press"/&gt; In an interview on [[MSNBC]] in May 2012 Murdoch said, "bipartisanship ought to consist of Democrats coming to the Republican point of view...If we win the House, Senate, and White House, bipartisanship means they have to come our way".&lt;ref name="idea"/&gt; In the same interview he said, "To me, the highlight of politics, frankly, is to inflict my opinion on someone else."&lt;ref name="youtube"/&gt; Republican [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012]] [[Vice President of the United States|Vice Presidential nominee]] [[Paul Ryan]] later expressed his disagreement with Mourdock's statement, saying, "I obviously don't agree with that."&lt;ref name="disagreed"/&gt;&lt;ref name="youtube1"/&gt;

'''Safari Kimanzi''' (or '''Kimanthi'''), best known as just "Safari" (born 20 August 1993) is a [[Kenya]]n who as a six-year-old boy received extensive plastic surgery over the course of 12 months to correct disfigurement of his face, neck, shoulder and hand caused by severe burns when he was an infant in Kenya. He was operated on by a team of volunteers at the [[Royal Prince Alfred Hospital]] (RPA) in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]], headed by senior plastic surgeon, Dr David Pennington. Safari spent almost twelve months in Australia, in and out of hospital, for his 14 operations. Before his surgery he was malnourished and only able to eat mashed bananas and milk because of severe contractures of his mouth and neck. His plight was discovered by Lesley Coverdale who was visiting with a friend in the area where Safari lived. She returned to Australia and began raising funds for his treatment. In a chance meeting with Ms Coverdale, Pennington, the Head of RPA's Department of Plastic Surgery, offered to operate on Safari gratis. Further funds to accomplish this were raised through the Adventist Development and Relief Agency (ADRA) and after nearly a year he was flown to Australia for treatment. At the end of his twelve-month treatment program in 2000, he was able to eat normally and was enabled to use his arm and hand for day-to-day activities.

His case was brought to the attention of the Australian public primarily through the television series ''[[RPA (TV series)|RPA]]'' which was filmed at the hospital, and covered Safari's rehabilitation over the course of a year. Safari became a household name{{cn|date=March 2015}} as the large RPA audience followed his progress from week to week. Safari's travel and accommodation expenses were paid for by ADRA, which also raised funds to assist Safari's village in Kenya. Channel Nine assisted in his return to Kenya.

Safari lives with foster parents in Australia. He is studying at [[St. Philip's Christian College]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hardie|first1=Alan|title=Safari's bravery: horrific burns and 18 operations|url=http://www.maitlandmercury.com.au/story/1557355/safaris-bravery-horrific-burns-and-18-operations/|accessdate=11 June 2014|work=maitlandmercury.com.au|date=8 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Safari is from [[Kasaala]], a small village in the Ikutha Division of [[Kitui District]], in the [[Eastern Province (Kenya)|Eastern Province]] of Kenya, a country in [[East Africa]]. The village is located by the [[Tsavo West National Park|Tsavo National Park]]. He was born around the year 1994.

The book ''Let the Journey Begin: Safari's Story'', was published in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;''Let the Journey Begin: Safari's Story'', edited by Paul Crawford, and with contributions from the [[Sanitarium Health Food Company]], the National Nine Network, Dr David Pennington and ADRA. Warburton, Victoria: ADRA Australia, 2001. {{ISBN|0-9579738-0-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Safari returned to Africa, his mother tragically died in 2003 from a [[snakebite]].&lt;ref&gt;Leesha McKenny, "[http://www.smh.com.au/national/safari-returns-to-sydney-for-new-facial-operation-20091017-h232.html Safari returns to Sydney for new facial operation]". ''[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]'', 18 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 2007, Safari lives with foster parents Janet Seath and Frank Scaysbrook in the town of [[Buttaba, New South Wales|Buttaba]],&lt;ref&gt;Julie Hartigan, "[http://www.maitlandmercury.com.au/news/local/news/news-features/safari-continues-inspiring-journey/527544.aspx?storypage=0 Safari Continues Inspiring Journey] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706110339/http://www.maitlandmercury.com.au/news/local/news/news-features/safari-continues-inspiring-journey/527544.aspx?storypage=0 |date=6 July 2011 }}". ''[[The Maitland Mercury]]'' 27 April 2007&lt;/ref&gt; in the [[City of Lake Macquarie]] in [[New South Wales]], Australia. The couple has published the book ''Safari: I Won't Cry, Mother''.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Seath with Frank Scaysbrook, ''Safari: I Won't Cry, Mother''. [[Random House]] Australia&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, Seath and Scaysbrook criticised the [[Adventist Development and Relief Agency]] (ADRA), a major sponsor, for allegedly not providing promised funds to Safari's village and for his education (ADRA had raised $180,000). On January 7, 2001, Seath &amp; Scaysbrook's criticisms were aired on Channel 7's television program, "Today Tonight" (rival to Nine's "A Current Affair") and on Sydney radio station [[2GB]]. In response, ADRA rejected the charges, and quoted a formal NSW state government investigation that had found the complaint to be unjustified.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.adra.org.au/newsroom/news/ADRA_Allocated_All_Funds_to_Safari_and_Community.htm ADRA Allocated All Funds to Safari and Community] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110706124246/http://www.adra.org.au/newsroom/news/ADRA_Allocated_All_Funds_to_Safari_and_Community.htm |date=6 July 2011 }}", ADRA website, 8 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[David Pennington]], the head of plastic surgery at the RPA hospital, and who led the surgical team, also rejected the charges.&lt;ref&gt; [http://aca.ninemsn.com.au/article.aspx?id=993202 Safari statement], ''A Current Affair'' website; 12 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The reason why funds were slow to be disbursed was that they had to pass through Kenyan government channels in order to fund an upgrade of the Kasaala Medical Clinic and extensions to the Kasaala school. However, these funds eventually did flow to the benefit of the Kasaala community.

He married Princess Aleksandra Lubomirska, the daughter of Great Marshal of the Crown, Prince [[Stanislaw Lubomirski (1722–1782)|Stanisław Lubomisrki]], on 2 June 1776.

He visited Rome in 1780, where he was painted by [[Jacques-Louis David]].&lt;ref name="Portrait"&gt;{{en icon}} {{cite web |author = |url = http://www.wilanow-palac.pl/the_equestrian_portrait_of_stanislaw_kostka_potocki.html|title = The equestrian portrait of Stanislaw Kostka Potocki |work = wilanow-palac.art.pl |publisher = |pages = |page = |date = |accessdate = 2011-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an alumnus of the [[Collegium Nobilium, Warsaw|Collegium Nobilium]] in [[Warsaw]], and later studied [[Polonistics]], literature and arts in [[Wilanów]]. He became Great [[Podstoli]] of the Crown in 1781&amp;ndash;1784. In 1792, he became an Artillery General of the Crown and participated in the [[War in Defense of the Constitution]]. He was a deputy of [[Lublin]] and one of the leaders of the [[Patriotic Party]] on the [[Four-Year Sejm]].

From 1792 to 1797 he lived abroad.

Potocki was a co-founder of the Society of Friends of Science (''Towarzystwo Przyjaciół Nauk'', ''or [[Society of Friends of Science in Warsaw|TPN]]'') in Warsaw in 1800. From 1807 he was a member of the Governing Commission (''Komisja Rządząca''), chairman of the Education Chamber (''Izba Edukacyjna''), and from 1810 director of the Commission of National Education (''Komisja Edukacji Narodowej'') in the [[Duchy of Warsaw]].

'''Tessouat''' (''[[Anishinaabe language|Anishinaabe]]'':  '''Tesswehas''') ([[Circa|c.]] ??? &amp;ndash; 1636/1654) was an [[Algonquin people|Algonquin]] chief from the [[Kitchesipirini]] nation ("Kitche"=Great, "sipi"=river, "rini"=people: the people from the great river, the [[Ottawa River]]). His nation lived in an area extending from [[Lake of Two Mountains]] to modern-day [[Pembroke, Ontario]].

Tessouat lived in [[L'Isle-aux-Allumettes, Quebec|L'Isle-aux-Allumettes]], in a neck of the Ottawa River. He was described by the French settlers as having a strong character. He was also blind in one eye (in French, borgne) and was dubbed "le Borgne de l'isle".  His position was highly strategic, as the Ottawa River was the safest way to go from the [[St. Lawrence River]] to [[Hudson Bay]] and to Huronia, near [[Georgian Bay]]. Tessouat took advantage of his position to impose some sort of customs duties on the French fur traders navigating on the Ottawa River, as well as to impose some of his authority. For example, in 1633, he refused to let the Jesuits go to Huronia, fearing he would lose authority in the region.  To maintain the economic supremacy of the Kitchisipirini, he made great efforts to keep his French, [[Wyandot people|Wendat]] (Huron), and [[Odawa people|Odawa]] allies from trading with each other directly, preferring that they trade through Algonquin middlemen.

At that time, the Algonquins, [[Wendats]], and several other Great Lakes First Nations were at war with the [[Iroquois Confederacy]]. Yet, Tessouat initiated peace talks with the [[Mohawk nation]] and, in 1634, they agreed to a peace treaty.  The alleged motive behind this political move was to gain access to the Dutch settlers in what is now known the New York State, perhaps in order to be in a better negotiating position with the French traders.  Peace with the Mohawks only lasted two years  and Tessouat died a few months after bloody fights against the Mohawks.

In 1641, after Tessouat's death, in the fashion of an Algonquian custom, a new Tessouat was reborn. The custom consisted of bringing back to life an important dead chief in a highly spectacular ritual. The new Tessouat was brought to life to save the Kitchesipirini nation, which was by then afflicted by death, caused by the European diseases, and isolated after several losses to the Iroquian confederation. Strangely enough, the new Tessouat was also blind in one eye. This fact probably contributed to muddle the French, who sometimes did not distinguish the new Tessouat from the old one. To save his nation, the new Tessouat decided to move from the Ottawa River area to a place nearby the French. After going to Sillery (nearby Quebec), where the Wendats refused their hospitality, Tessouat decides to bring his nation to [[Montreal|Montreal island]], where he agrees to receive the Christian baptism. In 1647, fearing an attack from the [[Iroquois]] and suspecting that the French would not defend them, Tessouat and his nation moved again. The new Tessouat finally died at [[Trois-Rivières, Quebec|Trois-Rivières]], in 1654.

:''For the mentalist Kreskin (born 1935), see [[The Amazing Kreskin]].''

'''Jeron Criswell King''' (August 18, 1907&amp;nbsp;&amp;ndash; October 4, 1982), born '''Jeron Criswell Konig''', and known by his stage-name '''The Amazing Criswell''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|k|r|ɪ|z|w|ɛ|l}}, was an American [[psychic]] known for wildly inaccurate predictions. In person, he went by '''Charles Criswell King''', and was sometimes credited as '''Jeron King Criswell'''.

Criswell was flamboyant, with [[Kiss curl|spit curled]] hair, a [[wikt:stentorian|stentorian]] style of speaking, and a [[sequin]]ed [[Black tie|tuxedo]]. He owned a [[coffin]] in which he claimed to sleep. He grew up in a troubled family in [[Indiana]] with relatives who owned a funeral home, and said that he became comfortable with sleeping in caskets in the storeroom. He appeared in two of [[Ed Wood]]'s films.

==Career==
Criswell said he had once worked as a [[radio announcer]] and news broadcaster. He began buying time on a local Los Angeles television station in the early 1950s to run [[infomercials]] for his Criswell Family Vitamins. To fill the time, he began his "Criswell Predicts" part of the show. This made him a minor off-beat celebrity in Los Angeles and around Hollywood, and his friendship with old show-business people such as [[Mae West]] and rising fringe celebrities such as [[Korla Pandit]] made Criswell an entertaining presence at parties. His fame brought him appearances on ''[[The Tonight Show|The Jack Paar Show]]'' (1957–1962) which allowed him to publish his predictions in three publications of Spaceway Magazine (February 1955, April 1955, and June 1955), as well as run a weekly syndicated newspaper article starting on September 6, 1951. He later published three books of predictions; ''From Now to the Year 2000'', ''Your  Next Ten Years'', and ''Forbidden Predictions''.  He also recorded a long playing record, ''Your Incredible Future'' (which  was later released on CD), featuring 84 minutes of his predictions in his own voice. Criswell appeared in the movies of writer and director [[Ed Wood]]. After Criswell's death, his longtime friend [[Paul Marco]] released Criswell's song "Someone Walked Over My Grave" on a 7" record which was recorded by Criswell as a memorial song that he wanted released posthumously.

==Predictions==
[[File:Plan 9 from Outer Space - Criswell Predicts.ogv|thumb|250px|"Criswell Predicts" scene in [[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]]]
Criswell's predictions were nationally syndicated and he appeared on the television show ''Criswell Predicts'' on KLAC Channel 13 (now [[KCOP|KCOP-13]]) in Los Angeles as well as being recorded for syndication. His announcer was Bob Shields, who later played the judge on ''[[Divorce Court]]''. Criswell wore heavy makeup in public after his live program was broadcast in [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. Only selected people were allowed in the KCOP studio during his broadcast.

Criswell wrote several books of predictions, including 1968's ''Criswell Predicts: From Now to the Year 2000.'' In it, he claimed that [[Denver, Colorado]] would be struck by a ray from space that would cause all metal to adopt the qualities of [[Natural rubber|rubber]], leading to horrific accidents at amusement parks.&lt;ref&gt;[http://deeky.blogspot.com/2010/02/criswell-predicts-pt-1.html Dharma Pancakes: Criswell Predicts (Part 1)]&lt;/ref&gt; He predicted mass [[cannibalism]]&lt;ref name=predicts&gt;[http://deeky.blogspot.com/2010/02/criswell-predicts-pt-5.html Dharma Pancakes: Criswell Predicts (Part 5)]&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[End time|end of planet Earth]], which he set as happening on August 18, 1999.&lt;ref name="predicts"/&gt; Neither became reality.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

Criswell was a student of history. He believed history repeated itself, that the United States were the "modern Romans". Each day, he read the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' looking for clues for his predictions.

Some sources claim Criswell's most famous prediction was on ''[[Jack Paar#Prime time|The Jack Paar Program]]'' (1962–65) in March 1963, when he predicted that US President [[John F. Kennedy]] would not run for reelection in 1964 because [[John F. Kennedy assassination|something]] was going to happen to him in November 1963.&lt;ref&gt;[http://c-e-n-t-e-r.com/ed_interview.html C-E-N-T-E-R Art Project interview with Criswell biographer Edwin L. Canfield]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sources say that Criswell never claimed to be a real psychic; however, those who knew him, including actress and fellow ''Plan 9'' alumna [[Maila Nurmi]] ("Vampira"), believed he was. According to writer [[Charles A. Coulombe]], whose family rented an apartment from him, Criswell told Coulombe's father "[I] had the gift, but&amp;nbsp;... lost it when I started taking money for it."

==Private life==
Criswell married a former [[speakeasy]] dancer named [[Halo Meadows]], who once appeared on ''[[You Bet Your Life]]'', and whom Coulombe describes as "quite mad": "Mrs Criswell had a huge standard [[poodle]] (named "Buttercup") which she was convinced was the [[reincarnation]] of her cousin Thomas.&lt;ref name="criswellpredicts.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.criswellpredicts.com/criswell.htm|title=Who Was Criswell?|publisher=Criswell Predicts|date= |accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; She spent a great deal of time [[Sun tanning|sunbathing]]&amp;nbsp;... which, given her size, was not too pleasing a sight."

[[File:Charles Criswell King Grave.JPG|thumb|200px|Niche of "The Amazing Criswell" at Valhalla Memorial Park]]

[[Mae West]] used Criswell as her personal psychic; he once predicted her rise to [[President of the United States]], whereupon she, Criswell and [[George Liberace]], the brother of showman [[Liberace]], would take a rocket to the Moon.&lt;ref name="criswellpredicts.com"/&gt; Criswell and West were great friends and she would lavish him with home-cooked food which she had delivered to the studio that he shared with [[Maila Nurmi]] ("Vampira").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hulu.com/watch/85365/haunted-world-of-ed-wood-jr|title=Watch Haunted World of Ed Wood, Jr. online &amp;#124; Free|publisher=Hulu|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is said that West sold Criswell her old luxury cars for five dollars.&lt;ref name="criswellpredicts.com"/&gt;

He died in 1982.

==Legacy==
* In 1955, Mae West, known as ''[[The Fabulous Mae West]]'', wrote and recorded a song called "Criswell Predicts".&lt;ref name="criswellpredicts.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://musicnotmusic.wordpress.com/2009/01/02/mae-west-sings-about-criswell/|title=Mae West Sings About Criswell &amp;#124; Music/ Not Music|publisher=Musicnotmusic.wordpress.com|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1994, Criswell was portrayed in the [[Tim Burton]] biopic, ''[[Ed Wood (film)|Ed Wood]]'', by actor [[Jeffrey Jones]].&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0109707|Ed Wood (1994)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1997, several actors, including Sean Phillip Mabrey,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7o3L539Xb5g|title=Plan 9 From Outer Space: The Musical|publisher=YouTube|date=1997|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; have played Criswell in ''Plan 9 from Outer Space: The Musical'', written by David G. Smith.
* In 1999, the film ''Devil Girls'' featured a portrayal of Criswell by Rob Gorden.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|0198417|Devil Girls (1999)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2005, Criswell and the ''Plan 9'' cast were lampooned in an episode of the television series, ''[[Deadly Cinema]]'', and clips of this episode were featured in the documentary, ''Vampira: The Movie''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vampirathemovie.com/cast.php|title=Cast of Vampira: The Movie|publisher=Vampirathemovie.com|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, Craig Brown played Criswell in ''Plan Live From Outer Space'', a stage adaptation of ''[[Plan 9 from Outer Space]]'' which won a Canadian Comedy Award the following year.&lt;ref&gt;{{IMDb title|1108860|Plan Live from Outer Space (2006)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2009, a teaser trailer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eJh-gdpJxJo|title=Plan 9 Teaser Trailer|publisher=YouTube|date=8 September 2009|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; was released by Darkstone Entertainment for the John Johnson film ''Plan 9'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://plan9movie.com/|title=PLAN 9|publisher=Plan9movie.com|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; a remake of ''Plan 9 From Outer Space''. The voice of popular television [[horror host]] [[Mr. Lobo]] can be heard narrating the trailer as Criswell. He also portrayed Criswell in the film, in a much larger role in this re-imagining of the original Ed Wood story. In addition, for the purpose of promoting the film on the internet, Mr. Lobo has produced 62 episodes of ''Criswell Predicts!''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=from Darkstone Entertainment 3 years ago not yet rated|url=http://vimeo.com/11636849|title=Criswell Predicts! #7 - Community of the Universe on Vimeo|publisher=Vimeo.com|date=10 May 2010|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=from Darkstone Entertainment 3 years ago not yet rated|url=http://vimeo.com/11616048|title=Criswell Predicts! #6 - Body Modification on Vimeo|publisher=Vimeo.com|date=10 May 2010|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; which is a parody and homage to Criswell's original television program of the same name ''sans'' the exclamation mark.

'''Tirimüjgan Kadın'''&lt;ref&gt;Freely, John – ''Inside the Seraglio'', Chapter 15: On the Shores of the Bosphorus, published 1999, Istanbul)&lt;/ref&gt; (16 August 1819 – 3 October 1852; {{lang-ota|تیرمژکان قادین}}) was a consort of Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url =http://www.osmanli.org.tr/osmanlisultanlari-5-243.html|title=Ottoman Research Foundation (in Turkish); announces the results of their recent investigations and proclaims her name as "Tîr-î-Müjgan Kadın Efendi"|accessdate=17 December 2010|work=Ottoman Sultans Web Page}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the mother of Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kultur.gov.tr/EN/belge/2-1305/sultan-ii-abdulhamid-han.html|title=Sultan Abdülhamid II Khan | accessdate=17 December 2010|work=Ministry of Culture and Tourism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
According to some sources, Tirimüjgan Kadınefendi was [[Armenians|Armenian]].&lt;ref name="Freely2001"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Freely|title=Inside the Seraglio: private lives of the sultans in Istanbul|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Za0TAQAAIAAJ|date=1 July 2001|publisher=Penguin}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to others Tirimüjgan Kadınefendi was born in historical [[Circassia]] in the [[Caucasus]] (present-day western Russia), and belonged to the [[Shapsugs|Shapsug]] tribe of the [[Circassians]].&lt;ref name="Kadınefendiler"/&gt; Her father was Bekhan [[Bey]] and her mother was Almaş [[Khanum|Hanım]].&lt;ref name="Kadınefendiler"/&gt;

She was given the name "Tirimüjgan" in the Ottoman Empire. She was among the longest serving kalfas at the palace for her refinement, her politeness, and her beauty. In her memoirs, Ayşe Sultan, the daughter of Sultan Abdul Hamid II, depicts Tirimüjgan Kadınefendi as having "green eyes and long, dark blond hair, pale skin of translucent white colour, thin waist, slender body structure, and very good-looking hands and feet."&lt;ref name="Kadınefendiler"/&gt; Ayşe Sultan adds that "Old Circassian women at the palace used to tell that she [Tirimüjgan] was from the Shapsug tribe, and I also remember my father [Abdul Hamid II] referring to every Shapsug Adyghe [Circassian] girl as "Our Valide's (''mother'') kind".&lt;ref name="Kadınefendiler"/&gt; Despite her well-documented origins, Abdülhamid II's personal enemies falsely claimed that she was the daughter of an Armenian musician, originally named Çandır.

==Marriage==
Tirimüjgan married Abdülmecid in 1839 at the [[Topkapı Palace]] in [[Istanbul]]. She gave birth to two princes and one princess. Her first child was Princess Naime Sultan, who died of [[smallpox]] at the age of two and a half in March 1843. Sultan [[Abdul Hamid II]] was her second child, while her third child was Şehzade Mehmed Abid Efendi, who died in May 1848 around the age of one month.&lt;ref&gt;Yavuz Bahadıroğlu, Resimli Osmanlı Tarihi, Nesil Yayınları ''(Ottoman History with Illustrations, Nesil Publications)'', 15th Ed., 2009, p. 505, {{ISBN|978-975-269-299-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whenever Sultan Abdülhamid II would speak of his mother, he would say: "My poor mother left this world at such a young age, but I can still picture her. I can never forget her. She loved me very much. When she became ill, she used to have me sit opposite her and content herself with gazing into my face, for she could not bring herself to kiss me. May God bless her soul."{{citation needed|date=February 2017}}

==Death==
Tirimüjgan Kadınefendi died of [[tuberculosis]] on 3 October 1852 at the [[Feriye Palace]] in [[Istanbul]]. She died nearly 23 years before Sultan Abdul Hamid II's accession to the Ottoman throne on 31 August 1876. In place of his biological mother Tirimüjgan Kadınefendi, the title of [[Valide Sultan]] was acquired by  [[Perestu Kadın]] who was the adoptive mother of [[Abdul Hamid II]]. Her tomb is located inside the royal mausoleum of imperial ladies at the [[New Mosque (Istanbul)|Yeni Mosque]] in [[Istanbul]]. In 1887, her son Abdul Hamid II built a mosque in her memory.

'''William Greet''' (1851 &amp;ndash; 25 April 1914) was a British theatre manager from the end of the 19th century and into the 20th century. Originally a business manager for other theatre licensees in the 1880s, he branched out as an independent manager in the 1890s and was associated with various London theatres, principally the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric]], the [[Savoy Theatre|Savoy]] and the [[Adelphi Theatre]]s.

==Biography==
Greet was the seventh child and eldest son of Captain Wiliam Greet [[Royal Navy|R.N.]], commander of the recruiting ship H.M.S. Crocodile, and the former Sarah Vallance Barling.  Greet's younger brother was the actor-manager [[Ben Greet]]. Greet was born on his father's ship, christened at [[Church of St Peter ad Vincula|St Peter ad Vincula]] at the [[Tower of London]], and educated at the [[Royal Naval School]], [[New Cross]].  He served as a Lieutenant of the [[Royal Marine Artillery]] from 1871 to 1877.  

===Career===
He worked first as a farmer and then began working in theatre management in the 1880s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~pnlowe/egerton/g0000006.html#I342 William Greet] at Rootsweb&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1884 and 1890, Greet was successively business manager at the [[Folly Theatre|Toole's Theatre]] under its licensee, [[J. L. Toole]],&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Observer]]'', 28 December 1884, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Novelty Theatre]] (licensee, [[Willie Edouin]]),&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', 22 November 1885, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Royalty Theatre]] (licensee, [[Kate Santley]]),&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bl.uk/catalogues/evanion/FullImage.aspx?EvanID=024-000001699&amp;ImageId=50659 British Library catalogues]&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Scala Theatre|Prince of Wales's Theatre]] (licensee, Horace Sedger),&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 23 January 1888, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and from 1890 to 1894 the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]], also for Sedger, with whom Greet's wife collaborated on a stage adaptation of the novel ''The Little Squire''.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 9 October 1890 and 6 April 1894&lt;/ref&gt;

Greet became a producer and theatre manager in his own right in 1894, as licensee of the [[Playhouse Theatre|Avenue Theatre]], starting successfully with the long-running ''[[Dandy Dick Whittington]]'' by [[George R. Sims]] and [[Ivan Caryll]]&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 12 November 1894, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; and a popular comedy by [[F. C. Burnand]], ''Mrs Ponderbury's Past'' (later billed as ''Mrs Ponderbury''), directed by and starring [[Charles Hawtrey (stage actor)|Charles Hawtrey]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'', 4 November 1895 and 2 March 1896&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1896, Greet gave up the licence at the Avenue and moved to the Lyric, where he presented the long-running ''The Sign of the Cross'' by [[Wilson Barrett]], also producing an American tour of the play.&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 29 August 1896, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;  He followed that success with another, ''Dandy Dan the Lifeguardsman'' by [[Basil Hood]] and [[Walter Slaughter]], starring [[Arthur Roberts (comedian)|Arthur Roberts]] and [[W. H. Denny]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Times'' 6 January 1898, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt; Greet sat on the Board of Directors of The Lyceum Theatre Ltd. from 1899 until 1902.&lt;ref name=irving&gt;[http://www.theirvingsociety.org.uk/landlord.htm The Irving Society]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, Greet leased the [[Savoy Theatre]] from [[Helen Carte]], the widow of [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]].  He then managed the [[D'Oyly Carte Opera Company]]'s revival of ''[[Iolanthe]]'' at the Savoy and its production of several new [[comic opera]]s including ''[[The Emerald Isle]]'', ''[[Merrie England (opera)|Merrie England]]'' (1902) and ''[[A Princess of Kensington]]'' (1903), both at the Savoy and on tour.  At the same time, he also leased the [[Lyric Theatre (London)|Lyric Theatre]] in London, producing ''Mice and Men'' in 1902, ''The Light that Failed'' in 1903 and [[Edwardian musical comedy|the musical comedies]] ''The Medal and the Maid'' (1903), and ''[[The Duchess of Dantzic]]'' (1904).  He also leased the [[Comedy Theatre]] in London, where he produced the hit musicals ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (operetta)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'' and ''[[Morocco Bound]]'', both in 1902.

Greet continued to produce musical comedies and operettas, many of them very successful, including ''[[The Earl and the Girl]]'' at the [[Adelphi Theatre]] (1903), ''The Talk of the Town'' (1905, Lyric Theatre), ''Blue Moon'' (1905, Lyric), ''The Sign of the Cross'' (Terriss Theatre), ''[[Alice in Wonderland (musical)|Alice in Wonderland]]'' (1908), ''A White Man'' (1908, Lyric), ''Little Hans Andersen'' (1909, by [[Basil Hood]]), ''The Fires of Fate'' (1909, Lyric), ''The Rivals'' (1910, Lyric), ''[[The Chocolate Soldier]]'' (1910, Lyric), ''Baby Mine'' (1911, [[Vaudeville Theatre]]), ''Nightbirds'' (1911, Lyric), and ''[[The Girl in the Taxi]]'' (1912, Lyric).

Greet died in [[Bournemouth]] at the age of 62 and was buried at [[Shillingford]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://freepages.genealogy.rootsweb.com/~pnlowe/egerton/g0000002.html#I342 Rootsweb]&lt;/ref&gt;

He succeeded his father as [[Viscount Mountjoy]] on 10 January 1727.  He was Grand Master of the Freemasons (in Ireland) between 1738 and 1740. He was created '''Earl of Blessington''' on 7 December 1745, his mother having been sister and sole heiress of [[Charles Boyle, 2nd Viscount Blesington|Charles, 2nd and last Viscount Blesington]].&lt;ref&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Mountjoy, Barons and Viscounts |display=Mountjoy, Barons and Viscounts s.v.

{{For|the surname|Vinther}}
A '''winemaker''' or '''vintner''' is a person engaged in [[winemaking]]. They are generally employed by [[winery|wineries]] or [[:Category:Wine companies|wine companies]], where their work includes:
*Cooperating with [[viticulture|viticulturist]]s
*Monitoring the maturity of grapes to ensure their quality and to determine the correct time for harvest
*Crushing and [[pressing (wine)|pressing]] grapes
*Monitoring the settling of [[grape juice|juice]] and the fermentation of grape material
*[[filter (chemistry)|Filtering]] the wine to remove remaining solids
*Testing the quality of wine by [[wine tasting|tasting]]
*Placing filtered wine in [[casks]] or tanks for [[storage (wine)|storage]] and maturation
*Preparing plans for bottling wine once it has matured
*Making sure that quality is maintained when the wine is bottled&lt;ref&gt;Echikson, Tom. ''Noble Rot''. NY: Norton, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, these duties require an increasing amount of scientific knowledge, since laboratory tests are gradually supplementing or replacing traditional methods. Winemakers can also be referred to as oenologists as they study [[oenology]] – the science of wine.

==Vintner==
[[File:Grapes.jpg|300px|thumb|right|Wine grapes.]]
A vintner is a [[wine]] [[merchant]]. In some modern use, particularly in [[American English]], the term is also used as a synonym for winemaker.&lt;ref name=OCW-vint/&gt;

The term started in [[Middle English]], superseding the earlier term ''vinter''.&lt;ref name=OCW-vint/&gt;

Due to the close political and commercial ties between [[Bordeaux wine|Bordeaux]] and England during the 14th and early 15th centuries, vintners were among the more important people in [[London]] with winemakers being four times mayor of the city under the reign of [[Edward II of England|Edward II]].&lt;ref name="OCW-vint"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |editor=[[Jancis Robinson]] | encyclopedia=[[Oxford Companion to Wine]] |edition= Third |title=Vintner |year=2006 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |isbn=0-19-860990-6 |page=754 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vigneron==
A vigneron is someone who cultivates a [[vineyard]] for winemaking.  The word connotes or emphasizes the critical role that vineyard placement and maintenance has in the production of high-quality wine.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vinsdebandol.com/en/savoir-faire.html The Vigneron's Savoir-Faire: The Result of Commitment] from the website of the Association les VINS de Bandol&lt;/ref&gt; The term, French for someone who grows grapes or makes wine,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.larousse.com/en/dictionaries/french/vigneron]{{dead link|date=February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; is often used in Australia to describe a winemaker who is also involved as an owner or manager&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/CA256EB5000644CE/page/Liquor-Types+of+Licences-Vignerons+Licence?OpenDocument&amp;1=75-Liquor~&amp;2=010-Types+of+Licences~&amp;3=090-Vignerons+Licence~ Vignerons Licence] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091016113504/http://www.consumer.vic.gov.au/CA256EB5000644CE/page/Liquor-Types+of+Licences-Vignerons+Licence?OpenDocument&amp;1=75-Liquor~&amp;2=010-Types+of+Licences~&amp;3=090-Vignerons+Licence~ |date=2009-10-16 }} from a [[Government of Victoria (Australia)|Government of Victoria]] website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.farmonline.com.au/winemags/grapegrowersvignerons/index.aspx ''GrapeGrowers &amp; Vignerons''] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090914161857/http://www.farmonline.com.au/WineMags/grapegrowersvignerons/index.aspx |date=2009-09-14 }} magazine&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.miettas.com.au/food_wine_recipes/wine/wine_articles/kingvalley.html King Valley] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091119093351/http://www.miettas.com.au/food_wine_recipes/wine/wine_articles/kingvalley.html |date=2009-11-19 }} from Mietta's Guide to Australian Restaurant, Cafes &amp; Bars&lt;/ref&gt; as opposed to a person who is employed only to make wine, who is generally referred to as a winemaker.  It is also used when referring to a winemaker from France.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pittsburghlive.com/x/pittsburghtrib/lifestyles/fooddrink/winecellar/s_553191.html Vigneron discusses what makes great wine]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from the ''[[Pittsburgh Tribune-Review]]''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://us.ft.com/ftgateway/superpage.ft?news_id=fto051220080021293510&amp;page=1 Brits who love a vigneron's life]{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} from the ''[[Financial Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Vincent of Saragossa]] is the [[patron saint]] of vignerons.

==Négociant==
A '''''négociant''''' is the [[French language|French]] term for a [[wine]] merchant who assembles the produce of smaller growers and winemakers and sells the result under its own name.&lt;ref name="OCW-neg"&gt;{{Cite web |last= ''Oxford Companion to Wine'' |title= Negociant |url= http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=2184 |deadurl= yes| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20131110160323/http://www.winepros.com.au/jsp/cda/reference/oxford_entry.jsp?entry_id=2184 |archivedate= 2013-11-10|df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Négociants buy everything from [[grape]]s to grape [[must]] to wines in various states of completion. In the case of grapes or must, the ''négociant'' performs virtually all the [[wine-making|winemaking]]. If he buys already fermented wine in barrels or ''en-vrac''—basically in bulk containers, he may [[age the wine]] further, blend in other wines or simply bottle and sell it as is. The result is sold under the name of the ''négociant'', not the name of the original grape or wine producer.

Some ''négociants'' have a recognizable house style.

''Négociants'', who are also called wine merchants/traders, were the dominant force in the wine trade until the last 25 years for various reasons:
* Historically the owners of vineyards and producers of wine had no direct access to buyers.
* It was too expensive for growers to purchase the [[Fruit press|wine presses]] and [[bottling line]]s necessary to produce a finished wine.
* Owning only a small portion of a particular high-quality single vineyard (''[[lieu-dit]]'')  meant that a grower often had insufficient wine from a parcel to vinify on its own. Under French inheritance laws, vineyard holdings were often split until offspring owned no more than a single row of grapes, not enough to fill a [[barrel]]. Since prices for a ''[[premier cru]]'' are typically higher than for wines from a larger area like a village or region, the grower could make more money selling off the production as the ''premier cru'' rather than blending it into a less specific appellation.

Many ''négociants'' are also vineyard owners in their own right. In [[Burgundy wine|Burgundy]] for instance, ''négociants'' as [[Bouchard Père et Fils]] and [[Faiveley (winery)|Faiveley]] are among the largest owners of vineyards.&lt;ref name=OCW-neg/&gt; Well-known ''négociants'' in Burgundy are [[Maison Louis Jadot]], [[Joseph Drouhin]], and [[Vincent Girardin]]; in Beaujolais, [[Georges Duboeuf]]; in Province, Mirabeau&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mirabeauwine.com/ mirabeauwine.com]&lt;/ref&gt;; and in the [[Rhône (wine region)|Rhône]] region, [[Guigal]], [[Jaboulet]], [[Jean-Luc Colombo]], [[Chapoutier]], and [[Famille Perrin]]''.
