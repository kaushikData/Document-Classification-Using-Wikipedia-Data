      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="26909">'''Annette Kolodny''' (born August 21, 1941, New York, N.Y., U.S.) is a [[feminism|feminist]] [[literary criticism|literary critic]] and [[activist]], and currently holds the position of College of Humanities Professor Emerita of American Literature and Culture at the University of [[Arizona]] in [[Tucson]]. Her major scholarly writings examine the experiences of women on the American frontiers and the projection of female imagery onto the American landscape. Her other writings examine some aspects of feminism after the 1960s; the revision of dominant themes in [[American studies]]; and the problems faced by women and minorities in the American academy.

==Biography==
Capping what was already a long and distinguished career, in 2012 Annette Kolodny published ''In Search of First Contact: The Vikings of Vinland, the Peoples of the Dawnland, and the Anglo-American Anxiety of Discovery'' (Duke University Press). The influential magazine ''Indian Country Today'' immediately named it as one of the 12 most important books in Native American Studies published in 2012. The Western Literature Association awarded the book the Thomas Lyon Prize as "the best book in Western literary and cultural studies published in 2012." Professor Kolodny had earlier made her mark in the field of Native American Studies with the publication of the long-lost 1893 masterpiece of Native American literature, [[Joseph Nicolar]]'s ''The Life and Traditions of the Red Man'' (Duke University Press, 2007). This new edition included an interpretive analysis of Nicolar's text as well as a fascinating history of the [[Penobscot Nation]] in Maine. These two latest books mark the culmination of a scholarly career that began with studies of the American frontiers and moved into breakthrough examinations of trans-Atlantic contacts between Europeans and Native Americans.

Kolodny was born in [[New York City]] to Esther Rifkind Kolodny and David Kolodny.&lt;ref name="Jay 211"&gt;Jay, Gregory (ed.), ''Dictionary of Literary Biography'', Detroit: Gale Research Company, 1988, p. 211.&lt;/ref&gt; She did her undergraduate work at Brooklyn College, from which she graduated [[Phi Beta Kappa]] [[magna cum laude]] in 1962.  After graduation, she took a position on the editorial staff at ''[[Newsweek]]''. Kolodny left to return to graduate studies in 1964, citing a desire “to teach people to think critically and because she wanted to be able to publish her own ideas, not merely report the ideas of others."&lt;ref name="Jay 211" /&gt; Her [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] and [[Ph.D.]] work were completed at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and she earned the latter degree in 1969. &lt;ref name="Leitch 2143"&gt;"Annette Kolodny", Leitch, Vincent B. (ed.), ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism.'' New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2001, p. 2143.&lt;/ref&gt; Her first teaching position at [[Yale University]] was cut short as she left after a year to move to [[Canada]] with her husband, whose [[conscription|draft]] board appeal for [[conscientious objector]] status for the duration of the [[Vietnam War]] was rejected.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2143" /&gt; Finding a position at the [[University of British Columbia]], she helped develop western Canada’s first accredited interdisciplinary [[women’s studies]] program before returning to the United States in 1974 to teach at the [[University of New Hampshire]].&lt;ref name="Jay 212"&gt;Jay, p. 212.&lt;/ref&gt;
	
In [[New Hampshire]], she wrote her first major work of feminist eco-criticism, ''The Lay of the Land: Metaphor as Experience and History in American Life and Letters'' (1975). While the book got positive reviews and pioneered the field of feminist [[ecocriticism]], Kolodny was denied promotion and [[tenure]] in the English Department at the University of New Hampshire. (Richter 1387) Active in the student movements while in Berkeley, she continued to advocate for the right to establish a program in women’s studies. She later [[lawsuit|sued]] the University of New Hampshire charging sex discrimination and anti-Semitism.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144"&gt;Leitch, p. 2144.&lt;/ref&gt; She settled with the "largest financial award in history in a case of this kind".&lt;ref name="Jay 212" /&gt; She used this money to establish the Legal Fund of the Task Force on Discrimination for the [[National Women's Studies Association]] (NWSA),&lt;ref name="Jay 212" /&gt; an organization she had helped found, and served as director of the task force from 1980 to 1985.&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; The Task Force is now renamed Feminists Against Academic Discrimination within the NWSA.

Kolodny taught at several universities, including the [[University of Maryland, College Park|University of Maryland]] and [[Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute]] before being named Dean of the College of Humanities at the [[University of Arizona]] in [[Tucson]]. Following her tenure as dean, which spanned from 1988 to 1993, Kolodny was named College of Humanities Professor of American Literature and Culture at the University of Arizona. Currently, she is Professor Emerita of Comparative Cultural and Literary Studies at the University of Arizona in Tucson.

In 1993 she was elected to lifetime membership in the [[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dnva.no/c26849/artikkel/vis.html?tid=40106|title=Gruppe 4: Litteraturvitenskap|publisher=[[Norwegian Academy of Science and Letters]]|language=Norwegian|accessdate= January 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Her books have won many awards both in the United States and abroad. Over the course of her scholarly career, Kolodny has received grants and fellowships from the National Endowment for the Humanities, the Ford Foundation, the Guggenheim Foundation, the Rockefeller Humanities Fellowship, and others. She retired from the University of Arizona in July 2007 and has continued an active professional life as a consultant in higher education policy issues and as a scholar of American literature and culture.

==Works==
Kolodny’s first two books were ''The Lay of the Land: Metaphor as Experience and History in American Life and Letters'' (University of North Carolina Press, 1975) and ''The Land Before Her: Fantasy and Experience of the American Frontiers, 1630-1860 ''(University of North Carolina Press, 1984); both of these texts deal with [[Environmentalism|environmental]] concerns and the historic destruction of the land (Jay 217). Based on her experience as a senior administrator in higher education, Kolodny published ''Failing the Future: A Dean Looks at Higher Education in the Twenty-First Century'' (Duke University Press, 1998), which "details the extent to which women and non-white students are still outsiders on American campuses."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; The book also examines the status of the humanities disciplines in higher education, the value of tenure, and the need for family friendly policies on campus. It is a book about needed educational innovations in the twenty-first century.

Kolodny is also well known for two essays published in 1980: "Dancing Through the Minefield: Some Observations on the Theory, Practice, and Politics of a Feminist Literary Criticism" (''Feminist Studies'', Spring 1980) and "A Map for Re-Reading: Gender and the Interpretation of Literary Texts" (''New Literary History'', Spring 1980). Of these, "Dancing Through the Minefield" is the most well-known, and has been called "the most reprinted essay of American feminist literary criticism".&lt;ref name="Leitch 2143" /&gt; It has been translated and reprinted worldwide.

In 2007, Kolodny published a long-lost masterpiece of Native American literature, Joseph Nicolar’s ''The Life and Traditions of the Red Man'' (Duke University Press), originally published in 1893. Nicolar’s work traces the history of his people, the Penobscot Nation, from the first moments of creation through the arrival of the white man. Kolodny’s reprint of this important work includes a history of the Penobscot Nation and an interpretive introduction to the text. It was stipulated that the royalties from this text go to the Penobscot. In 2012, Kolodny published ''In Search of First Contact: The Vikings of Vinland, the Peoples of the Dawnland, and the Anglo-American Anxiety of Discovery'' (Duke University Press). A major contribution to the field of American Studies, this book examines both Native American and Euroamerican stories of first contacts between the peoples of the New and Old Worlds. It examines the competition between [[Leif Eiriksson]] and [[Christopher Columbus]] for the title of "first discoverer".

===Literary theory and criticism===

====Landscape symbolism and ecofeminism====

=====''The Lay of the Land: Metaphor As Experience and History in American Life and Letters''=====

In her first book, ''The Lay of the Land'', Kolodny explores the [[colony|colonization]] of America, both in reality and in the realm of [[metaphor]]. She examines "the continued repetition of the land-as-woman symbolization in American life and letters" (Kolodny, ix). The projection of female imagery onto the landscape was essential to its colonization, she argued; in her introduction, she asks, "was there perhaps a need to experience the land as a nurturing, giving maternal breast because of the threatening, alien, and potentially emasculating terror of the unknown?" (9) By construing the land as female, she argued, it was possible for the colonists to remove some of the terror and mystery from an unknown land. Instead, it became either a nurturing maternal figure, existing to provide sustenance, or a passive virginal figure, existing only to be dominated, sexually or otherwise. With these metaphors firmly in sight, the colonists had a framework through which to view the vast stretches of [[North America]] as less alien and terrifying. Through an examination of several male writers, such as [[Philip Freneau]], [[James Fenimore Cooper]], and [[John James Audubon]], Kolodny pursues the implications of this metaphorically female land.

Different chapters of the book correspond to different chronological eras after the discovery and colonization of the Americas and to different metaphorical mindsets as manifested in the writings of the authors considered. In chapter 2, "Surveying the Virgin Land: The Documents of Exploration and Colonization, 1500–1740", the comparison of the land to an untouched, virginal paradise begins the exploration. Chapter 3, "Laying Waste Her Fields of Plenty: The Eighteenth Century", discusses the romanticized [[agriculture|agrarian]] and [[pastoral]] ideals that coloured the view of America, especially in its comparisons to ideal lands like [[Elysium]] and [[Arcadia (utopia)|Arcadia]], and the consequences that arose from such ideals, such as the exploitation and alteration of the land. Chapter 4, "Singing Her Past and Singing Her Praises: The Nineteenth Century", examines the dual images of Mother and Mistress in the land, as well as the frustration of the pastoral impulse with the closing of the American frontier and the victory of the industrialized North in the [[American Civil War]]. Finally, chapter 5, "Making It with Paradise: The Twentieth Century", deals with the increase of [[industrialization]] and the yearning both "to return to and to master the beautiful and bountiful femininity of the new continent." (139)

[[Freud]]ian and [[psychoanalysis|psychoanalytic]] influences are apparent in this text, especially in the "psychosexual dynamic of a virginal paradise" (Kolodny, ''Land Before Her'', 3). It also has tones of [[ecofeminism]], which will be discussed below.

=====''The Land Before Her: Fantasy and Experience of the American Frontiers, 1630-1860''=====

In the preface to this book, Kolodny states that "[t]he purpose of this study is to chart women’s private responses to the successive American frontiers and to trace a tradition of women’s public statements about the west." (Kolodny, ''Land Before Her'', xi) Thus, she approaches the same topic as that of ''Lay of the Land'' ("landscape as a symbolic…realm" [xii]), but from a different direction. In the writings she examined, she noticed a different theme from that of the male writers:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Like their husbands and fathers, women too shared in economic motives behind [[emigration]]; and like the men, women also dreamed of transforming the wilderness. But the emphases were different…Avoiding for a time male assertions of a rediscovered [[Garden of Eden|Eden]], women claimed the frontiers as a potential sanctuary for an idealized domesticity. Massive exploitation and alteration of the continent do not seem to have been a part of women’s [[fantasy (psychology)|fantasies]].  They dreamed, more modestly, of locating a home and a familial human community within a cultivated garden. (xii–xiii)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

There is little sense of the conquering-of-the-[[frontier]] mentality that Kolodny discovered in the male writers she discussed in ''Lay of the Land''. There were no triumphant [[hero]]es of the order of [[Daniel Boone]] or [[Davey Crockett]]; rather, the narratives of these women focused on the triumph of domesticity and order in a wild land.

The book is organized chronologically, in much the same way as ''Lay of the Land''. The first section is titled "Book One: From Captivity to Accommodation, 1630-1833", and traces the writings of and about women as they moved from captivity both literal ([[Mary Rowlandson]]’s account of being captured by [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]]s) and figurative (the sense of being forcibly confined in a new and strange land) to adaptation in the form of survival skills, such as those reputedly possessed by [[Rebecca Boone]], the wife of Daniel Boone. Book two, "From Promotion to Literature, 1833–1850", follows attempts to encourage women to move westward by male writers to western narratives by the women themselves. The third and final section, "Book Three: Repossessing Eden, 1850–1860", documents the attempts by women to create a familiar order in a still unfamiliar country.

=====Ecofeminism=====

Both of these books relate to a subgenre of feminism called ecological feminism or ecofeminism, a social and political doctrine that posits a relationship between the subjugation of women and the destruction of nature. Ecofeminists theorize that a culture based on dominating women is directly connected to social ideals that promote the environmental abuse of the earth. 

These two books have a connection to ecofeminism, particularly ''Lay of the Land''. The feminization of the land and the images of the earth as a passive, giving female figure show the social ideas that ecofeminism protests against. Likewise, ''The Land Before Her'' exemplifies the same ideas from a different point of view in the ideal of the domestic garden, or the altering of nature.

===="Dancing Through the Minefield"====

Perhaps her best known work, Kolodny’s 1980 essay "Dancing Through the Minefield" was the "first work to attempt both a survey of the first ten years of feminist literary inquiry and an analysis of the informing theoretical propositions".&lt;ref&gt;Jay, p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; It has been the subject of criticism in the years since its initial publication, but can still be seen as a guide to "feminist concerns and methodologies."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt;

=====Social constructionism=====
{{Main article|Social constructionism}}
Kolodny emphasizes Social constructionism in this essay, although she herself never uses the term. Briefly, social constructionism is a school of thought that involves looking at the ways social phenomena are created, by people. (See full article on Social constructionism) Using this theory, social entities are seen as always being in a state of change as society itself changes, and the relationships of the entities change. "[T]hings in the world … are the products of ongoing social processes of interaction, and thus do not have fixed or inherent meanings."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt;

In "Dancing Through the Minefield", Kolodny applies this theory to the [[wiktionary:canon|literary canon]], those works of [[literature]] that are considered appropriate for study. But such a canon is formed by critics whose values of [[Literary Criticism|aestheticism]] are not neutral. The critical interpretation is formed by the interaction between two objects: the text and the reader. According to Kolodny, the reader’s ability to read any given text is shaped by the social conventions and assumptions of their time and place; Reading becomes a social product. But neither is the text pure; it is also moulded by social relations and customs. So any critical interpretation is necessarily a product of two forms of social construction. "Readers and texts are both made &amp;mdash; and they are continually being remade."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; The dynamic nature of both texts and readers must be taken into consideration when examining any text, or the established criticism of that text.

=====Theory=====
Kolodny’s essay has a clear theoretical outline. In light of the social constructionist view that aesthetic values, as assigned to the literary canon, are in actuality the products of social conventions and values, Kolodny claims that feminist criticism should "discover how aesthetic value is assigned in the first place" (Kolodny 2147) and then assess the socially-constructed reading patterns that lead to those value judgements. "Having become embroiled in value disagreements, feminism should consider the processes underlying value judgements."&lt;ref name="Leitch 2144" /&gt; "Dancing Through the Minefield" outlines a three-part nucleus assumed by most contemporary feminist literary critics to be essential. First, any construction of a literary canon is a social construction; second, readers unconsciously engage texts from a certain point-of-view; and third, this unconscious bias present in all readers must be consciously and critically re-examined. 

First, she writes, "literary history…is a fiction." (Kolodny 2153) This refers to the traditional formation of the literary canon and literary history as a social construction. Literary histories define the major, minor, and ignored texts according to their own social values and conventions, not out of any inherent aesthetic value on the text itself. For example, the western literary canon has been largely created by well-educated white men, and the focus of the canon is therefore on works by well-educated white men. It embodied, as well as upheld, the dominant ideology of the time, and had implications beyond aesthetic values. To give preference to texts by this group was to ignore texts created by other social groups. In recent years, the monolithic nature of the canon has been challenged, and works by previously ignored sections of the literary world (women, [[homosexual]]s, and [[ethnic minority|ethnic minorities]]) have gained some footholds in the canon.

Secondly, readers of texts "engage…not texts but [[paradigm]]s." (2155) Just as texts and canons are socially constructed, so are the vantage points from which readers engage with any given text. This was also mentioned by [[Stanley Fish]], who called these vantage points [[interpretive communities]]. Kolodny states that "we appropriate meaning from a text…according the critical assumptions or predispositions (conscious or not) that we bring to it." (2155)

Finally, Kolodny "strives to undo the unconsciousness of the reader identified"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145"&gt;Leitch, p. 2145.&lt;/ref&gt; in the second part of her theory:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Since the grounds upon which we assign aesthetic value to texts are never infallible, unchangeable, or universal, we must re-examine not only our [[aesthetics]] but, as well, the inherent biases and assumptions informing the critical methods which (in part) shape our aesthetic responses. (Kolodny 2158)&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
These three general theoretical principles are then supported by the concept of pluralism. Pluralism in this context refers to a conscious effort not to limit oneself to a single critical approach when reading a text. Rather, the object of pluralism is to make use of multiple critical approaches and to get a fuller appreciation of the variety of meanings which can be present in a single text. Kolodny specifically refers to a feminist pluralism, which validates "multiple interpretations of various texts"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145" /&gt; according to the usefulness of a pluralistic view of a text. This method of reading would give equality to different approaches as well as allow critical examinations of those same approaches, which in turn helps create the "broad critical awareness"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145" /&gt; advocated by Kolodny’s third principle as outlined above.

The essay emphasizes the real situation of contemporary women. Kolodny believes that feminism and women’s studies should not be confined to books or classrooms. “[I]deas are important because they determine the ways we live, or want to live, in the world” (Kolodny 2164); ideas are therefore not meant to exist in a vacuum. Rather, they must be taken into the world through [[activism]].

=====Criticism=====
Several authors have criticized "Dancing Through the Minefield". The most well-known of these criticisms appeared in a collaborative article Kolodny wrote with Judith Gardiner, Elly Bulkin, and Rena Patterson entitled "An Interchange on Feminist Criticism: On ‘Dancing Through the Minefield’", which was published in the journal ''Feminist Studies'' in 1983. 

Both Bulkin and Patterson believe that Kolodny, while speaking to women in her essay, is only speaking to a certain group of women &amp;mdash; those who are white, [[middle class]], and [[heterosexual]]. Patterson states that "despite its language and intent, [the essay]…represents [[classism|classist]], white, and [[heterosexism|heterosexist]] attitudes which are common in feminist literary criticism and which contradict the best of feminist thought and the aims of the women's movement" (Patterson, 654). This is a common criticism of [[second-wave feminism]]: that it tended to ignore the problems of non-white and non-heterosexual women in favor of a homogenized white heterosexual feminist culture. However, Kolodny’s advocacy of the concept of pluralism may offset this claim. While she does not specify that alternative critical approaches should come from different [[ethnicity|ethnicities]] or [[Sexual orientation|sexualities]], there is no reason why they could not and such inclusion would only increase the scope of the "broad critical awareness"&lt;ref name="Leitch 2145" /&gt; mentioned above.

Gardiner, on the other hand, disagrees with Kolodny about the use of pluralism. While there can be no single ideology to which all feminist theories belong, Gardiner writes, there are some strong ideological concepts that define areas of feminism. Examples of this would include [[liberal feminism]], [[socialist feminism]], and [[ecofeminism]]. In Gardiner’s view, the strong ideological beliefs shared by these groups would "limit their susceptibility to pluralism." (Gardiner 634)

====''Failing the Future: A Dean Looks at Higher Education in the Twenty-First Century''====
Kolodny’s 1998 book is not a work of literary criticism, but rather one of institutional criticism. After serving as dean of Humanities for five years at the University of Arizona, Kolodny wrote this book in order to outline some of the problems facing academic institutions. These include the ability of legislators and administrators to make uninformed decisions about budget cuts without realizing the effect of such cuts on quality education; a myriad of problems about [[tenure]] and promotions processes, which Kolodny believes still reflect an attitude antagonistic to women or ethnic minorities; a problem with anti-feminist and anti-[[intellectual]] harassment; the lack of support available for students with children; the extent to which women and non-whites are still considered outsiders on university campuses; and the effect of an outdated curriculum in the face of greater demographic diversity and changing student learning needs. She outlines a number of changes which can be made to improve conditions and, realizing that any substantial change will require equally substantial money, encourages government reinvestment in higher education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13214">{{History of Armenia}}
The term "'''Armenian Question'''", as used in [[History of Europe|European history]], became commonplace among diplomatic circles and in the popular press after the [[Congress of Berlin]] in 1878. As with the [[Eastern Question]], it refers to [[Europe]]'s involvement with the [[Armenians in the Ottoman Empire|Armenian subjects]] of the [[Ottoman Empire]], beginning with the [[Russo-Turkish War of 1877–78]]. In specific terms, the Armenian question refers to the protection and the freedoms of Armenians from their neighboring communities.&lt;ref name=etudes&gt;''Armenian Studies: Études Arméniennes'' by Lebanese Association of Armenian University Graduates, pp. 4–6&lt;/ref&gt; The "Armenian Question" explains the 40 years of Armenian-Ottoman history in the context of English, German, and Russian politics between 1877–1914. The term "Armenian Question" is also often used to refer to the question of Turkey's lack of acknowledgement of the events surrounding the [[Armenian Genocide]]. Armenian Question is also a high school subject in some schools of Armenia.

Beginning in the mid-19th century, the [[Great Power]]s took issue with the Ottoman Empire's treatment of its Christian minorities and increasingly pressured it to extend equal rights to all its citizens. Following the violent suppression of Christians in the uprisings in [[Ottoman Bosnia and Herzegovina|Bosnia and Herzegovina]], [[Ottoman Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], and [[Ottoman Serbia|Serbia]] in 1875, the Great Powers invoked the 1856 [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]], claiming it provided the authority for their intervention to protect the Ottoman Empire's Christian minorities. By the late 1870s, the [[Greeks]], along with several other Christian nations in the [[Balkans]], frustrated with their conditions, had, with the help of the Powers, broken free of Ottoman rule. The Armenians, on the other hand, received less interest and no support that wasn't later withdrawn from the Great Powers and remained, by and large, stagnant during these years, earning them the title of ''millet-i sadıka'' or the "loyal [[millet (Ottoman Empire)|millet]]".&lt;ref name = "Dadrian"&gt;{{Cite book | authorlink = Vahakn Dadrian | last = Dadrian | first = Vahakn N | title = The History of the Armenian Genocide: Ethnic Conflict from the Balkans to Anatolia to the Caucasus | page=192 | place = Oxford | publisher = Berghahn Books | year = 1995 | isbn = 1-57181-666-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1827-28, [[Tsar Nicholas I]] sought help from Persian Armenians in the [[Russo-Persian War (1826–1828)|Russo-Persian War]], promising that afterward, their lives would improve. In 1828, the Russians declared [[Russo-Turkish War (1828–1829)|war on Turkey]]. In 1828, Russia annexed the [[Erivan Khanate]], [[Nakhichevan Khanate]], and the surrounding countryside with the [[Treaty of Turkmenchay]]. After the Treaty of Turkmenchay, Armenians still living under Persian rule were encouraged to emigrate to Russian Armenia and 30,000 followed the call. Russia annexed significant portions of territory occupied by the Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Peimani|2009|pp=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the [[Russian Empire Census|1897 Russian Census]], 1,127,212 Armenians were counted in Russian lands:

* [[Erivan Governorate]], 439,926;
* [[Elisabethpol Governorate]], 298,790; 
* [[Kars Oblast]], 72,967;

* [[Dagestan Oblast]], 1,652;
* [[Kutais Governorate]], 24,505.

For the same period (1896 [[Vital Cuinet]]) there were 1,095,889 Armenians in the Ottoman Empire:&lt;ref&gt;[[Vital Cuinet]], La Turquie d'Asie : géographie administrative, statistique, descriptive et raisonée de chaque province de l'Asie-Mineure, 4 vols., Paris, 1890–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Russia advanced its southern border, it became increasingly involved with Ottoman affairs. Russia was instrumental in obtaining the independence of Romania and Serbia. Russia, and Russian life, attracted Armenians. Many Armenians became educated and adopted Russian ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Peimani|2009|pp=236}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Russia was also a path to Europe for Armenians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Peimani|2009|pp=236}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia gained control over a large part of Armenia, and became the champion of Armenians in the Ottoman Empire.

Most Armenians lived in provinces bordering Russia and not any other European states. By the [[Treaty of Adrianople (1829)|Treaty of Adrianople]], Akhalkalak and Akhaltsikhe were ceded to Russia. This resulted in a wave of emigration, with 25,000 Ottoman Armenians moving to [[Russian Armenia]].&lt;ref&gt;Bournoutian. ''Armenian People'', p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; The Armenians began to look more toward the [[Russian Empire]] as the ultimate guarantors of their security.

Many Armenians in the Eastern provinces of the Ottoman Empire, living under the threat of unchecked violence and depredation on the part of aggressive neighboring peoples, greeted the advancing Russian army as liberators. In January 1878, [[Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople]] [[Nerses II Varzhapetian]] approached the Russian leadership to receive assurances that Russia would introduce provisions for Armenian self-administration in the new peace treaty.

In March 1878, after the conclusion of the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)]], the Armenian Patriarch of Constantinople, Nerses II Varzhaptian (1874–1884), forwarded Armenian complaints of widespread "forced land seizure&amp;nbsp;... forced conversion of women and children, arson, protection racket, rape, and murder" to the Powers. Patriarch Nerses Varjabedyan convinced Russians to insert Article 16 to [[Treaty of San Stefano]], stipulating that the Russian forces occupying the Armenian-populated provinces in the eastern Ottoman Empire would withdraw only with the full implementation of reforms. Though not as explicit, Article 16 of the Treaty of San Stefano read: {{quotation |As the evacuation of the Russian troops of the territory they occupy in Armenia, and which is to be restored to Turkey, might give rise to conflicts and complications detrimental to the maintenance of good relations between the two countries, the [[Ottoman Porte|Sublime Porte]] engaged to carry into effect, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians and to guarantee their security from [[Kurds]] and [[Circassians]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hertslet | first = Edward | authorlink=Edward Hertslet | title = The Map of Europe by Treaty | volume = 4 | place = London | publisher = Butterworths | year = 1891 | page = 2686}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

However, in June 1878, Great Britain took objection to Russia holding on to so much Ottoman territory and forced it to enter into new negotiations with the convening of the [[Congress of Berlin]]. Article 16 was modified so that all mention of the Russian forces remaining in the provinces was removed. Instead, the Ottoman government was periodically to inform the Great Powers of the progress of the reforms. In the final text of the [[Treaty of Berlin (1878)|Treaty of Berlin]], it was transformed into Article 61, which read: {{quotation |The Sublime Porte undertakes to carry out, without further delay, the improvements and reforms demanded by local requirements in the provinces inhabited by Armenians, and to guarantee their security against the Circassians and Kurds. It will periodically make known the steps taken to this effect to the powers, who will superintend their application.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | last = Hurewitz | first = Jacob C | title = Diplomacy in the Near and Middle East: A Documentary Record 1535–1956 | volume = I | place = Princeton, NJ | publisher = Van Nostrand | year = 1956 | page = 190}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}} The [[Armenian National Assembly]] and Patriarch [[Nerses Varjabedyan]] asked his predecessor on Patriarchal See and future Catholicos [[Mkrtich Khrimian]] to present the case for the Armenians at Berlin. An Armenian delegation led by Mkrtich Khrimian traveled to Berlin to present the case of the Armenians but, much to its dismay, was left out of the negotiations. Following the Berlin negotiations, in his famous patriotic speech “The Paper Ladle,” Mkrtich Khrimian advised Armenians to take the [[national awakening of Bulgaria]] (Liberation of Bulgaria) as a model for the hopes for [[self-determination]].&lt;ref&gt;Haig Ajemian, Hayotz Hayrig, pp. 511–13; translated by Fr. Vazken Movsesian.&lt;/ref&gt; In Bulgarian historiography, [[Liberation of Bulgaria]] means the events of the Russo-Turkish War of 1877-78 that led to the re-establishment of the [[Bulgarian people|Bulgarian]] sovereign state with the Treaty of San Stefano.

[[file:Six armenian provinces.png|left|thumb|320px|[[Six Armenian provinces]] of the Ottoman Empire]]

In 1880, the Armenians, especially encouraged by the prime minister Gladstone, broached the Armenian issue with the words, "To serve Armenia is to serve the Civilization". On 11 June 1880, the great powers sent to porte an “Identic Note” which asked for the enforcement of Article 61.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Nalbandian|1963|p=84}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was followed on 2 January 1881 with a "British Circular on Armenia" sent to the other Powers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Nalbandian|1963|pp=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{See also|Armenian reform program|Hamidian massacres}}
[[Armenian reform program]] of 11 May 1895 was a set of reforms proposed by [[European Powers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harv|Nalbandian|1963|pp=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[France|French]] diplomat [[Victor Bérard]] wrote: {{quotation |After six months of constant massacres, while Europe pretended that the Armenian Question was already solved, the Armenians decided to show Europe that the Armenian Question still existed but that there was no Ottoman government any more.&lt;ref&gt;V. Bérard, La Politique du Sultan, Revue de Paris, January 15, 1897, p. 457&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Armenian reform package ==

The [[Armenian reform package]] was a reform plan devised by the [[European powers]] in 1912–1914 that envisaged the creation of two provinces placed under the supervision of two European inspectors general. As it turned out, the reforms were not forthcoming. With the lack of visible progress in the improvement of the plight of the Armenian community, a number of disillusioned Armenian intellectuals living in Europe and Russia in the 1880s and 1890s decided to form political parties and revolutionary societies which would struggle to attain better conditions for their compatriots.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | first = Richard G | last = Hovannisian | contribution = The Armenian Question in the Ottoman Empire, 1876–1914 | title = The Armenian People From Ancient to Modern Times | volume = II: Foreign Dominion to Statehood: The Fifteenth Century to the Twentieth Century | editor-first = Richard G | editor-last = Hovannisian | place = New York | publisher = St Martin's | pages = 206–12 | ISBN = 0-312-10168-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Assyrian Democratic Movement''' ({{lang-syr|ܙܘܥܐ ܕܝܡܘܩܪܛܝܐ ܐܬܘܪܝܐ|Zawʻá Demoqraṭáyá ʼÁṯuráyá}}), usually abbreviated as '''ADM''' and popularly known as '''Zowaa''' (English: ''The Movement'') is an [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]] political party situated in [[Iraq]], which is one of the main Assyrian parties within the [[Council of Representatives of Iraq|Iraqi parliament]].

== History ==

The Assyrian Democratic Movement (Zowaa) was founded in April 12, 1979 in a general conference that was held in secrecy in several meetings in [[Kirkuk]], [[Mosul]] and [[Baghdad]]. The party was established among various smaller cultural-political and student groups such as the Assyrian Brothers, with the primary focus to satisfy the political objectives of the [[Assyrians in Iraq|Assyrian people in Iraq]], in response to the oppressive brutality of the [[Baath Party|Ba'ath]] regime and its attempts to forcibly expropriate [[Ethnic group|ethnic]] Assyrians from their native lands. The ideology of the movement stemmed from Assyrian cultural awareness that had developed in [[Urmia]] and [[Elazığ|Harput]] during the [[Assyrian independence movement]]. The movement took up armed struggle against the Iraqi regime in 1982 under the leadership of Ninos Pithyou with the primary focus of defending Assyrian villages, and joined the Iraqi-Kurdistan Front (IKF) in early 1990s. Yonadam Kanna, in particular was a target of the Saddam Hussein Ba'ath regime for many years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atour.com/adm/docs/history.htm|title=Assyrian Democratic Movement - History|website=www.atour.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Profile: Assyrian parties |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/not_in_website/syndication/monitoring/media_reports/2588611.stm |website=BBC |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Donabed |first1=Sargon |title=Reforging a Forgotten History: Iraq and the Assyrians in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bwLdCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT156&amp;lpg=PT156&amp;dq=assyrian+democratic+movement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ttQuBaPXaO&amp;sig=llLvN5PYMFR4cXmyhjPYxvFOrSo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLgbet0OrdAhWHa94KHYNtAI04KBDoATACegQIBxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=assyrian%20democratic%20movement&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since its inception, the ADM have joined with the Iraqi patriotic factions in the fight against dictatorship. The movement has also participated in the political field since 1982 alongside other groups.  It started by issuing its central newspaper, Bahra, in June 1982.  In 1988, fighter members of the movement and its headquarters as well as the rest of the Kurdish parties were attacked in the [[Al-Anfal Campaign]]. ADM participated in the uprising in 1991; then won seats in parliamentary elections for the Kurdistan region of Iraq in 1992. 

The ADM is credited with the development of education in the [[Syriac language]] in both elementary and secondary schools as well as the initiation of different organizations such as the Chaldo-Assyrian Students' Union, Hammurabi Scouts, Assyrian Women's Union of Iraq and the [[Assyrian Aid Society]]. 

The ADM has endured a struggle through the sacrifice of its martyrs' in the arena of armed struggle. On 14 July 1984, the Saddam led regime attacked ADM locations in Baghdad, arresting more than 150 members of the movement who were imprisoned in the notorious [[Abu Ghraib prison]]. Twenty-two members were sentenced to life imprisonment, and four were sentenced to death where  Yousip Toma, Youbert Benyamin and Youkhanna Esho were hanged on treason charges.  Jamil Matti and Sheba Hamey were later murdered by the Iraqi Army while safeguarding the villages of Hejerke and Pireka. Relatives of ADM members were also imprisoned, tortured and murdered for their connection to the movement. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.atour.com/news/assyria/20031220a.html|title=The Heroes of the Assyrian Democratic Movement|website=www.atour.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Donabed |first1=Sargon |title=Reforging a Forgotten History: Iraq and the Assyrians in the Twentieth Century |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=bwLdCQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT156&amp;lpg=PT156&amp;dq=assyrian+democratic+movement&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ttQuBaPXaO&amp;sig=llLvN5PYMFR4cXmyhjPYxvFOrSo&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwjLgbet0OrdAhWHa94KHYNtAI04KBDoATACegQIBxAB#v=onepage&amp;q=assyrian%20democratic%20movement&amp;f=false |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some ADM members were victims of political assassinations such as Francis Yousef Shabo who was allegedly assassinated by Wahid Kovli, a [[Kurdistan Democratic Party]] (KDP) hitman. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ekurd.net/mismas/articles/misc2010/6/state3940.htm|title=Murderers of Iraqi Kurdistan MP Francis Yousif Shabo lives in KDP controlled regions|website=ekurd.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Prior to the Iraqi invasion ==
[[File:Assyrianfighters80.JPG|thumb|left|Zowaa fighters in the [[Assyrian homeland]] in the 1980s.]]
Due to successful lobbying from influential [[Assyrians in the United States|Assyrian-Americans]] and from Congressman [[Henry Hyde]], American President [[George W. Bush]] designated the ADM an officially recognized Iraqi opposition movement. In a December 9, 2002 memorandum, President Bush invoked both articles four and five of the Iraq Liberation Act of 1998 as a means of allowing the United States government to provide financial resources to the ADM and other Iraqi opposition groups. Kanna himself participated in a September 2002 meeting of Iraqi opposition leaders in New York and addressed the London conference of Iraqi opposition leaders in December 2002. In February 2003, Kanna addressed both Iraqi opposition leaders and U.S. envoy [[Zalmay Khalilzad]] at a conference in northern Iraq. Just hours prior to the American-led war against Iraq in March 2003, Kanna stressed the importance of the coming war for the history of the Assyrian people. He noted that some Assyrians were leaving the cities for the villages and urged diaspora Assyrians to provide humanitarian aid to their brethren.

== After the fall of Baghdad ==
Yonadam Kanna became the leader of the party in 2001, succeeding Ninos Pithyou. He served on the temporary [[Iraqi Governing Council]] before it was disbanded in favor of the elected body formed after the January 2005 [[Iraqi elections]].

The party's website, zowaa.org, describes it as "a democratic and political organization -- national and patriotic -- to defend our people and their legitimate rights and to struggle under the banner of [a] free democratic Iraq." The site's declarations include calls for official recognition of the rights of Assyrians and "unity of our people under their several religious identities": Chaldean church, Syriac church, and Assyrian church (various Christian denominations in the Assyrian demographic).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/iraq/adm.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The group supports the idea of a federal Iraq, and maintains good relations with other Assyrian and Kurdish groups present in northern Iraq, as well as with Shi'a leaders in southern Iraq. The movement is also represented in the [[Kurdistan Regional Government|Kurdistan parliament]]. Party members and Assyrians in general have been the focus of some Islamic insurgent attacks in the time since the fall of [[Saddam Hussein]].

The party also operates [[Ashur TV]], Ashur Radio and issues [[Bahra (newspaper)|Bahra]] newspaper.

The party is based in the former headquarters of the [[Fedayeen Saddam]] in [[Zayouna|Zayouna, Baghdad]]. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Tyson |first1=Ann Scott |title=Iraqi council faces many hurdles |url=https://www.csmonitor.com/2003/0807/p06s01-woiq.html |website=Christian Science Monitor |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Szego |first1=Julie |title=Visiting Iraqi Christians tell exiles to stay strong |url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/visiting-iraqi-christians-tell-exiles-to-stay-strong-20080627-2y5p.html |website=Sydney Morning Herald |accessdate=3 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Parliamentary '''committees of the Australian House of Representatives''' are groups of Members of Parliament, appointed by the [[Australian House of Representatives|House of Representatives]], to undertake certain specified tasks. They comprise government and non-government Members and have considerable powers to undertake work on behalf of the Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_4_-_Committees|title=Infosheet - Committees - Parliament of Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Federation Chamber==
{{Main|Australian House of Representatives#Federation Chamber}}

The Federation Chamber, formerly the Main Committee, provides an additional forum for the second reading and consideration in detail stages of bills and debate of committee reports and papers presented to the House. All Members of the House are automatically members of the Federation Chamber and eligible to participate in its meetings.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.aph.gov.au/About_Parliament/House_of_Representatives/Powers_practice_and_procedure/00_-_Infosheets/Infosheet_16_-_The_Federation_Chamber|title=Infosheet - The Federation Chamber - Parliament of Australia|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Standing committees ==
Under the [[Parliamentary procedure|Standing Orders]] of the House, standing committees are appointed for the life of the Parliament and they are usually re-established in some form in successive Parliaments (that is, after each election).

The House has two types of standing committees:

* '''general purpose committees''' — established to inquire into and report upon any matters referred to them, including legislation. These committees specialise by subject area, between them covering most areas of policy and government administration.
* '''domestic''' or '''internal''' '''committees''' — concerned with the powers and procedures of the House or the administration of Parliament.

== Select committees ==
Select committees are appointed as the need arises for a specific purpose, and have a limited life.

== Joint committees ==
Joint committees are established by both Houses of the [[Australian parliament]] and include both Members and Senators.

The '''Australian Protectionist Party''' is a minor [[Australia]]n [[political party]] with [[protectionist]] and [[nationalist]] policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.protectionist.net/primary-polices/ |title=Policies &amp;#124; Australian Protectionist Party |publisher=Protectionist.net |date= |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The party was registered by the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] in January 2011, and went on to contest the [[Australian federal election, 2013|2013 federal election]], but was de-registered in June 2015.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aec.gov.au/Parties_and_Representatives/Party_Registration/Deregistered_parties/aust-pp.htm Australian Protectionist Party] – AEC. Retrieved 21 June 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ideology==
The Australian Protectionist Party is an Australian [[nationalist]] political party with [[protectionism]] as its ideological basis. 

According to their website, the party has seven primary policies which include, amongst others, the protection of the economy, environment, the family unit and way of life.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.protectionist.net/primary-polices/&lt;/ref&gt; The APP opposes [[multiculturalism]] saying it is "ruining Australia."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2009/06/10/1244313180075.html?page=2 |title=Racist Facebook group targets Aussie immigrants |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=10 June 2009 |author=Barrett, Briena |accessdate=12 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Registered as a federal political party with the [[Australian Electoral Commission]] on 18 January 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aec.gov.au/parties_and_representatives/party_registration/registered_parties/aust-pp.htm |title=Australian Protectionist Party |date=18 January 2011 |work=Current Register of Political Parties |publisher=Australian Electoral Commission |accessdate=12 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Australian Protectionist Party opposes [[refugees]] and [[asylum seekers]] and often participates in rallies such as the one outside the [[Villawood Immigration Detention Centre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/activists-showdown-at-villawoods-gates-20100411-s0wh.html?skin=text-only |title=Activists' showdown at Villawood's gates |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=12 April 2010 |author=Kontominas, Bellinda |accessdate=12 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Since inception, the Australian Protectionist Party has been active in protesting against the presence of asylum seekers and Muslims,  and has also organised several  protests against [[Sharia law]] being implemented in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sally |first=By |url=http://www.news.com.au/national-old/islamist-leader-burhan-hanif-tells-aussie-muslims-told-to-shun-democracy/story-e6frfkvr-1225887784755 |title=Islamist leader Burhan Hanif tells Aussie Muslims to 'shun democracy' |publisher=News.com.au |date=2010-07-05 |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/australian-troops-fair-game-for-muslims-in-war-on-afghanistan-hizb-ut-tahrir-believe/story-e6freuy9-1226086675320&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.protectionist.net/photo-galleries/anti-defamation-league-rally-2011/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120912032847/http://www.protectionist.net/photo-galleries/anti-defamation-league-rally-2011/ |date=12 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The APP hailed the election of US president [[Donald Trump]], believing this "ushered in a new era". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.protectionist.net/2017/01/27/trump-ushers-in-a-new-era/&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In April 2007 Darrin Hodges, chairman of the Sutherland Shire branch, was expelled from the [[Australia First Party]] due to disagreements with other party members. Hodges went on to co-found the Australian Protectionist Party. Andrew Phillips became national chairman of the new party.

On Saturday 23 June 2012, the APP held what they described as a "counter protest" to a pro-refugee celebration day by the "Walk Together" group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.nick-folkes.com/2012/06/20/torpedo-gillards-boat-policy/ |title=Torpedo Gillard’s boat policy &amp;#124; Nicholas Hunter Folkes |publisher=Nick-folkes.com |date=2012-06-20 |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.getup.org.au/campaigns/refugees/walk-together/walk-together Walk Together], GetUp.org.au&lt;/ref&gt;

The party has been involved in [[Glenn Druery]]'s [[Minor Party Alliance]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2013-09-05/bitter-dispute-erupts-over-senate-preferences-in-queensland/4939300 Bitter dispute erupts over Senate preferences in Queensland: ABC 5 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/news/special-features/alliance-of-micro-parties-boosts-odds-for-likes-of-one-nation-or-shooters-and-fishers-gaining-senate-spot-through-preferences/story-fnho52jp-1226713114765 Alliance of micro parties boosts odds for likes of One Nation or Shooters and Fishers gaining Senate spot through preferences: Daily Telegraph 5 September 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016, the Australian Protectionist Party hosted a public speaking event in Perth &lt;ref&gt;http://www.protectionist.net/2016/08/12/graeme-campbell-speaks-to-the-app-in-perth/&lt;/ref&gt; featuring former Labor and independent MP [[Graeme Campbell (politician)|Graeme Campbell]], whom the APP described as "the Father of modern Australian nationalism". &lt;ref&gt;http://www.protectionist.net/2016/03/24/graeme-campbell-meeting-2016-perth/&lt;/ref&gt;  

In October 2016, the Australian Protectionist Party joined with the [[Australia First Party]], Nationalist Alternative, Eureka Youth League, and Hellenic Nationalists of Australia to form the Australian Coalition of Nationalists (ACN).

==Electoral performance==
Darrin Hodges ran unsuccessfully as a candidate in the 2008 [[Sutherland Shire Council]] elections, coming last in his ward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/national/locals-oppose-muslim-school/2008/09/25/1222217430708.html |title=Locals oppose Muslim school |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=26 September 2008 |author=Gibson, Jano |accessdate=12 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.onlineopinion.com.au/view.asp?article=8129 |title=Scrutinising the religious and political right |date=7 November 2008 |author=Matheson, Alan |work=ON LINE opinion |location=Australia |accessdate=12 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hodges ran again unsuccessfully as a candidate for the [[Australian Senate|Senate]] in the [[Australian federal election, 2010|2010 Australian federal election]]. Hodges had to run as an [[independent (politics)|independent]] as his party was not registered in time and his ticket received 1,501 votes (0.03%).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.smh.com.au/federal-election/minor-parties/sex-socialism-and-shooting-lead-the-charge-in-microparty-race-20100819-12s3x.html?skin=text-only |title=Sex, socialism and shooting lead the charge in microparty race |work=The Sydney Morning Herald |date=20 August 2010 |author=Sharp, Ari |accessdate=12 September 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2012, NSW spokesman [[Nick Folkes]] was also unsuccessful when he contested the NSW council elections for the [[Municipality of Leichhardt]] and received 0.6% of the total vote for the ward with 41 votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/elections/nsw/2012/council/?page=Leichhardt |title=2012 NSW Local Council Elections - ABC News (Australian Broadcasting Corporation) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2013-09-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Central Treaty Organization''' (''CENTO''), originally known as the '''Baghdad Pact''' or the '''Middle East Treaty Organization''' (''METO''), was formed in 1955 by [[Iran]], [[Iraq]], [[Pakistan]], [[Turkey]] and the [[United Kingdom]]. It was dissolved in 1979.

US pressure and promises of military and economic aid were key in the negotiations leading to the agreement, but the [[United States]] could not initially participate. [[John Foster Dulles]], who was involved in the negotiations as [[U.S. Secretary of State]] under President [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], claimed that was due to "the [[Israel lobby in the United States|pro-Israel lobby]] and the difficulty of obtaining Congressional Approval."&lt;ref&gt;[[Selwyn Lloyd]]; ''Suez 1956: A Personal account''&lt;/ref&gt; Others said that the reason was "for purely technical reasons of budgeting procedures."&lt;ref&gt;Hadley, Guy. ''CENTO: The Forgotten Alliance'' ISIO Monographs, University of Sussex, UK (1971): 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958, the US joined the military committee of the alliance. It is generally viewed as one of the least successful of the [[Cold War]] alliances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Martin |first=Kevin W. |editor=Ruud van Dijk |encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of the Cold War |title=Baghdad Pact |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rUdmyzkw9q4C&amp;pg=PA57&amp;dq=cento+%22least+successful%22+%22baghdad+pact%22&amp;client=safari |accessdate=2009-01-30 |year=2008 |publisher=Routledge |location=New York |isbn=978-0-415-97515-5 |pages=57 |quote=Thus, the Baghdad Pact is widely considered the least successful of the Cold War schemes engendered by the Anglo-American alliance.|display-editors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization's headquarters were in [[Baghdad]], [[Iraq]], in 1955 to 1958 and in [[Ankara]], [[Turkey]], in 1958 to 1979. [[Cyprus]] was also an important location for CENTO because of its location in the [[Middle East]] and the [[British Sovereign Base Areas]] on the island.&lt;ref&gt;Dimitrakis, Panagiotis, "[http://www.informaworld.com/smpp/content~content=a913300799~db=all~jumptype=rss The Value to CENTO of UK Bases on Cyprus]", ''Middle Eastern Studies'', Volume 45, Issue 4, July 2009, pp 611–624&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:F-4Es 50th TFW in Iran 1977.JPEG|thumb|left|200px|Three U.S. Air Force McDonnell Douglas F-4E Phantom II aircraft parked at Shiraz Air Base, Iran, during exercise Cento, 1 August 1977]]
Modeled after the [[North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO), CENTO committed the nations to mutual cooperation and protection, as well as non-intervention in each other's affairs. Its goal was to [[containment|contain]] the [[Soviet Union]] ([[USSR]]) by having a line of strong states along the USSR's southwestern frontier. Similarly, it was known as the 'Northern Tier' to prevent Soviet expansion into the Middle East.&lt;ref name=LenczAmerPres&gt;[[George Lenczowski]], ''American Presidents and the Middle East'', 1990, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike NATO, CENTO did not have a unified military command structure, nor were many U.S. or UK [[military bases]] established in member countries, although the U.S. had communications and electronic intelligence facilities in Iran, and operated [[Lockheed U-2|U-2]] intelligence flights over the [[USSR]] from bases in Pakistan. The United Kingdom had access to facilities in Pakistan and Iraq at various times while the treaty was in effect. 

On July 14, 1958, the Iraqi monarchy was overthrown in a military coup. The new government was led by General [[Abdul Karim Qasim]] who withdrew Iraq from the Baghdad Pact, opened diplomatic relations with Soviet Union and adopted a non-aligned stance. The organization dropped the name 'Baghdad Pact' in favor of 'CENTO' at that time.

The [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]] became extremely volatile areas during the 1960s with the ongoing [[Arab–Israeli Conflict]] and the [[Indo-Pakistani Wars]]. CENTO was unwilling to get deeply involved in either dispute. In 1965 and 1971, Pakistan tried unsuccessfully to get assistance in its wars with [[India]] through CENTO, but this was rejected under the idea that CENTO was aimed at containing the [[USSR]], not India.
[[File:1958-01-30 Baghdad pact.ogv|thumb|[[Universal Newsreel]] about the Baghdad Pact]]
CENTO did little to prevent the expansion of Soviet influence to non-member states in the area. Whatever containment value the pact might have had was lost when the Soviets 'leap-frogged' the member states, establishing close military and political relationships with governments in [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Iraq]], the [[People's Democratic Republic of Yemen]], [[Somalia]], and [[Libya]]. By 1970, the USSR had deployed over 20,000 troops to Egypt, and had established naval bases in Syria, Somalia, and P.D.R. Yemen.

The [[Iranian revolution]] spelled the end of the organization in 1979, but in reality, it essentially had been finished since 1974, when [[Turkey]] [[Turkish invasion of Cyprus|invaded]] [[Cyprus]]. This led the United Kingdom to withdraw forces that had been earmarked to the alliance,{{citation needed|date=April 2008}} and the [[United States Congress]] halted Turkish military aid despite two Presidential vetoes.&lt;ref name=LenczAmerPres/&gt; With the fall of the Iranian monarchy, whatever remaining rationale for the organization was lost. Future U.S. and British defense agreements with regional countries—such as Pakistan, Egypt, and the Persian Gulf states—were conducted bilaterally.

With the withdrawal of Iran, the secretary-general of CENTO, Turkish diplomat [[Kamran Gurun]], announced on March 16, 1979, that he would call a meeting of the pact's council in order to formally dissolve the organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=CENTO pact members to dissolve alliance soon |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vJYuAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=haEFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5263%2C6037291 |newspaper=[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]] |agency=[[Associated Press|AP]] |location=Montreal |date=1979-03-17 |page=46 |accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==CENTO railway==
CENTO sponsored a railway line, some of which was completed, to enable a rail connexion between [[London]] and [[Tehran]] via [[Van, Turkey|Van]]. [[Van-Sufian railway|A section]] from [[Lake Van]] in Turkey to [[Sharafkhaneh]] in Iran was completed and funded in large part by CENTO (mainly the US and UK). The civil engineering was especially challenging because of the difficult terrain. Part of the route included a rail ferry across Lake Van with a terminal at [[Tatvan]] on the Western side of the lake. Notable features of the railway on the Iranian side included 125 bridges, among them the [[Ghotour Bridge|Towering Quotor span]], measuring {{convert|1,485|ft}} in length, spanning a gorge {{convert|396|ft|}} deep.&lt;ref&gt;Geneva Times, 15 April 1971. p9 http://fultonhistory.com/Newspaper%2011/Geneva%20NY%20Daily%20Times/Geneva%20NY%20Daily%20Times%201971%20Mar-Apr%201971%20Grayscale/Geneva%20NY%20Daily%20Times%201971%20Mar-Apr%201971%20Grayscale%20-%201035.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Meklis, Y.

==Cultural and research institutions==
Like its counterparts NATO and SEATO, CENTO sponsored a number of cultural and scientific research institutions:
* CENTO Conferences on Teaching Public Health and Public Health Practice&lt;ref&gt;Kashani-Sabet, Firoozeh. OUP (2011) Conceiving Citizens: Women and the Politics of Motherhood in Iran. p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institutions supported a wide range of non-military activities, with a particular focus on agriculture and development, In 1960, for example, CENTO had funded 37 projects covering agriculture, education, health, economic development and transportation.&lt;ref&gt;CIA memorandum, released under US Freedom of Information provisions.

'''D. Chris Buttars''' (April 1, 1942 – September 10, 2018) was an American politician who served in the [[Utah State Senate]] representing the [[10th Utah Senate District]]. He began his service as a state senator in 2001 and resigned in 2011 citing health problems.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc4.com/content/news/top_stories/story/Sen-Buttars-resigns-seat-in-Utah-State-Senate/Noskki7S4kOieKDb2dL49g.cspx&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Buttars was born in [[Logan, Utah]] on April 1, 1942, and graduated from [[Utah State University]] with a [[B.S.]] in [[Marketing]]/[[Economics]] in 1967. Upon graduating from [[Utah State University]] he was employed at [[Amoco|Amoco Oil Company]] from 1967 to 1976 as a Retail Sales Manager. In 1976 he became the Executive Director of the Petroleum Retails Organization. He was director of the [[Utah Boys Ranch]], now known as West Ridge Academy, a boarding school for boys.&lt;ref&gt;[http://live.orato.com/current-events/2009/02/02/illegal-disciplinary-tactics-senator-buttar-039-s-utah-west-ridge-academy - Illegal Disciplinary Tactics at Buttars' West Ridge Academy. ]&lt;/ref&gt;

Buttars is married to Helen, and is the father of six and currently lives in [[West Jordan, Utah]]. He successfully ran for the [[West Jordan, Utah|West Jordan]] City Council in 1970, and served on the City Council until 1983. Buttars ran for the [[Utah Senate]] in 2000, and served as Utah State Senator for [[10th Utah Senate District|district 10]] from 2001 to 2011. Buttars has served in various Republican Party leadership positions.  Buttars is also a recipient of the [[Boy Scouts of America]]'s Silver Beaver award for distinguished service to the BSA. He died in 2018 after a period of declining health.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.mcdougalfuneralhomes.com/obituary/d-chris-buttars/&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legislation and policy==
Buttars sponsored legislation against [[gay straight alliance]]s in public schools, introduced a resolution urging companies to have their employees say "Merry Christmas" rather than "Happy Holidays" to customers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

Buttars sponsored legislation to fund drug treatment programs, supported raising the [[minimum wage]] and assisting child crime victims.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/search/ci_3426720 Salt Lake Tribune - Buttars stands out as morals crusader&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In February, 2010, Buttars proposed eliminating the 12th grade from Utah high schools to close a budget shortfall.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.latimes.com/news/nation-and-world/la-na-utah-school15-2010feb15,0,906102.story Los Angeles Times - In Utah, a plan to cut 12th grade&lt;/ref&gt;

===Intelligent design===
During the 2006 General Session of the [[56th Utah State Legislature]] Buttars sponsored S.B. 96, an [[Intelligent Design]] Bill. The bill would allow instructors to teach students that [[evolution]] is a controversial theory and counter it with the [[pseudoscience]] of Creationism, using the term "Divine Design."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/goodk/www.MormonGulag.com/Utah_Boys_Ranch_Network_Video.html - Response to Controversy: Politics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{cite web

===Accusations of racism===
In an interview with radio hosts Tom Grover &amp; Ryan Yonk, Buttars said that he "[doesn't] know of an example where the minority is being jeopardized by legislative action." When Grover mentioned ''[[Brown v. Board of Education]],'' which [[desegregation|desegregated]] American schools, Buttars responded that he thought "''Brown v. Board of Education'' is wrong to begin with." In response to public reaction to his statements and accusations of racism, Buttars responded, "I don't think there's a racial [sic] bone in my body..." and "I don't see black and white. I see people. I always have."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sltrib.com/search/ci_4223675 Salt Lake Tribune - Buttars insists his radio remarks were not motivated by racism&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

During a debate of a school-funding bill on the floor of the State Senate in February 2008, the bill's sponsor compared the bill to the baby involved in the [[Judgment of Solomon|Biblical story of King Solomon]].&lt;ref name="kutv"&gt;{{cite news |title=Senator apologizes for 'black baby' comment |work=Associated Press |publisher=[[KUTV]], Four Points Media Group LLC |date=2008-02-13 |url=http://www.kutv.com/content/news/local/story.aspx?content_id=1e113158-aad1-4cdf-a85c-6521d6805425 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Buttars responded saying, "This baby is black, I'll tell you. This is a dark, ugly thing."&lt;ref name="kutv"/&gt; Buttars apologized for a remark on the State Senate floor,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sen.

Less than six months after Buttars' re-election, he was recorded saying of the [[ACLU]], "bless their black little hearts," in an interview with documentary maker and former KTVX ABC 4 reporter Reed Cowan. Cowan’s documentary is called,  "[[8: The Mormon Proposition]]."

Buttars was outspoken on issues dealing with [[homosexuality]], and co-sponsored [[Utah Constitutional Amendment 3]] with [[Utah Boys Ranch]] colleague [[LaVar Christensen]], which defined marriage in Utah as consisting "only of the legal union between a man and a woman."&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.mac.com/goodk/www.MormonGulag.com/Utah_Boys_Ranch_Network_Video.html - Response to Controversy: Politics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="measure"&gt;{{cite news

In a January 2009 interview with openly gay documentary filmmaker Reed Cowan, for the documentary ''8: The Mormon Proposition'', Buttars said that gays and [[lesbians]] were "the greatest threat to America going down," comparing members of the LGBT community to [[Islamic fundamentalism|radical Muslims]].

[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] issued a statement urging "civil and respectful dialogue."

The '''Comprehensive Agreement on Bangsamoro''' ('''CAB''')  is a final peace agreement signed between the [[Government of the Philippines]] and the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] on 27 March 2014 at the [[Malacañang Palace|Malacañang Palace]] in [[Manila]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/588852/500-milf-members-to-attend-bangsamoro-accord-signing-at-palace |title=500 MILF members to attend Bangsamoro accord signing at Palace &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2014-03-25 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under the agreement, the Islamic separatists would turn over their firearms to a third party, which would be selected by the rebels and the Philippine government. The MILF agreed to decommission its armed wing, the Bangsamoro Islamic Armed Forces (BIAF). In return, the government would establish an autonomous [[Bangsamoro (political entity)|Bangsamoro]]. Power sharing was a central point to the autonomy redesign.

The current ARMM charter lists 14 areas that are outside the powers of the regional legislature. In this comprehensive peace agreement, the parties lists 81 powers categorized into reserved for the central government, exclusive to the Bangsamoro, and concurrent with or shared by the two sides for power sharing. Of the 81 powers, 58 are devolved to the Bangsamoro, nine are reserved to the central government, and 14 are shared.&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsinfo.inquirer.net/589347/power-sharing-central-to-moro-self-rule |title=Power-sharing central to Moro self-rule &amp;#124; Inquirer News |publisher=Newsinfo.inquirer.net |date=2014-03-27 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro]] and Four annexes, namely on Transitional Arrangements and Modalities, Revenue Generation and Wealth Sharing, Power Sharing and Normalization, together with the Addendum on Bangsamoro Waters, will be included in the comprehensive agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Rodel |first=Jose |url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/2014/02/12/1289375/bangsamoro-deal-signed-march |title=Bangsamoro deal signed by March &amp;#124; Headlines, News, The Philippine Star |publisher=philstar.com |date=2014-02-12 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Armed Forces of the Philippines has raised red alert status on 24 March in preparation for the event.

==Background==
{{see also|Moro insurgency in the Philippines}}
In pursuit of their goal of liberating [[Bangsamoro Republik|Bangsamoro]], the MNLF engaged the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|government forces]] in extensive armed collisions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://publishing.cdlib.org/ucpressebooks/view?docId=ft0199n64c;chunk.id=0;doc.view=print |title=Muslim Rulers and Rebels |publisher=Publishing.cdlib.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; peaking in the early 70s when the rebels’ blitz-like operations brought them control of a substantial number of municipalities surrounding [[Cotabato City]] and its airport complex. This prompted the [[Ferdinand Marcos|Marcos]] regime to beef up military presence by deploying almost three-fourths of the army&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://asiasociety.org/countries/conflicts/origins-muslim-separatist-movement-philippines?page=0,1 |title=The Origins of the Muslim Separatist Movement in the Philippines |publisher=Asia Society |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; in most Muslim parts of [[Mindanao]]. Things took a different turn in 1976 when [[Libya]]n leader [[Muammar Gaddafi]] brokered an agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqgiE94IAmIC |title=Militant Islam in Southeast Asia: Crucible of Terror - Zachary Abuza - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; that led to the signing of the Tripoli Agreement&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mnlfnet.com/The_Tripoli.htm |title=MNLF Home Page |publisher=Mnlfnet.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}},&lt;/ref&gt; introducing the concept of an autonomous Muslim region in Mindanao. On 1 August 1989, under the mandate of the new 1987 Constitution,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/index7.php?doctype=Constitutions&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd64558f82c40d9d#sam |accessdate=27 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121028105057/http://elibrary.judiciary.gov.ph/index7.php?doctype=Constitutions&amp;docid=a45475a11ec72b843d74959b60fd7bd64558f82c40d9d |archivedate=28 October 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Congress of the Philippines|Congress]] enacted Republic Act 6734&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawphil.net/statutes/repacts/ra1989/ra_6734_1989.html |title=R.A. 6734 |publisher=Lawphil.net |date=1989-08-01 |accessdate=2015-02-27}},&lt;/ref&gt; authorizing the creation of the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM). However, out of the 13 provinces and 9 cities that participated in the plebiscite,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/research/08/10/08/fast-facts-armm-elections|title=Fast Facts on the ARMM Elections|publisher=Abs-cbnnews.com|accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; only the provinces of [[Lanao del Sur]], [[Maguindanao]], [[Sulu]], and [[Tawi-Tawi]] opted to become part of the ARMM. The ARMM was formally established on 6 November 1990.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/8fa942046ff7601c85256983007ca4d8/7098d74184207a3385256b040066f055?OpenDocument |title=Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao |publisher=[[United Nations Multilingual Terminology Database|Unterm.un.org]] |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131015020445/http://unterm.un.org/DGAACS/unterm.nsf/8fa942046ff7601c85256983007ca4d8/7098d74184207a3385256b040066f055?OpenDocument |archivedate=15 October 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Instead of bringing the Muslim leaders together, this agreement further fragmented the MNLF,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fas.org/irp/world/para/mnlf.htm |title=Moro National Liberation Front (MNLF) |publisher=Fas.org |date= |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; because some factions within the group preferred independence over autonomy. Thus, a group of officers led by [[Hashim Salamat]] broke away&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/moro.cfm |accessdate=27 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120909040310/http://www.cdi.org/terrorism/moro.cfm |archivedate=9 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and formed the [[Moro Islamic Liberation Front]] (MILF) to continue their armed struggle for an independent Bangsamoro (Moro nation) in Mindanao.

Though the combined strength of these two rebel forces has not reached a point of posing any real threat to the [[Government of the Philippines|government]] in [[Manila]], their existence—and the reasons for their resilience—certainly brings lots of headaches for the government. For nearly five decades, five [[President of the Philippines|presidents]] have tried to completely end these two rebellions, utilizing both [[Military force|force]] and [[diplomacy]]. So far, no combination has succeeded. Perhaps the most remarkable effort to bring closure to these movements was that of the [[Fidel V. Ramos|Ramos]] Administration, which tried to reach out to both the communist and Muslim rebels through peaceful means. There were many [[Peace process with the Bangsamoro in the Philippines#Efforts to reach peace with Islamic separatists|efforts to reach peace with Islamist separatists]].

==Framework Agreement==
{{Main|Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro}}
On 15 October 2012, the Philippine government signed a much-hyped document touted as the [[Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro]], which culminated the Aquino Administration's effort to end the deadlock in the peace process. This new document, while merely providing for a general framework for the actual peace negotiations, announced that "the status quo is unacceptable and that the Bangsamoro shall be established to replace the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao (ARMM). The Bangsamoro was the new autonomous political entity (NPE) referred to in the Decision Points of Principles as of April 2012."
According to President [[Benigno Aquino III|Aquino]], this was the agreement that could "finally seal genuine, lasting peace in Mindanao."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.gov.ph/2012/10/15/speech-of-president-aquino-during-the-signing-of-the-gph-milf-framework-agreement-october-15-2012/%20 |title=Speech of President Aquino during the signing of the GPH-MILF Framework Agreement on the Bangsamoro, October 15, 2012 &amp;#124; Official Gazette of the Republic of the Philippines |publisher=Gov.ph |date=2012-10-15 |accessdate=2015-02-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228173309/http://www.gov.ph/2012/10/15/speech-of-president-aquino-during-the-signing-of-the-gph-milf-framework-agreement-october-15-2012/ |archivedate=28 December 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Bangsamoro (political entity)|Bangsamoro]] replacing ARMM which was described by [[President of the Philippines|President]] [[Benigno Aquino III]] as "a failed experiment".&lt;ref name="gma"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gmanetwork.com/news/story/277218/news/nation/govt-milf-agree-to-create-bangsamoro-to-replace-armm |title=Govt, MILF agree to create ‘Bangsamoro’ to replace ARMM &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; GMA News Online |publisher=Gmanetwork.com |date=2012-10-07 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaching the agreement==
The peace talks between the MILF and the [[Philippine government]] had been brokered by [[Malaysia]] since 1997. After 2009, the negotiations were also supported by an International Contact Group(the ICG).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.c-r.org/sites/c-r.org/files/PracticePaper_MindanaoICG_ConciliationResources_0.pdf|format=PDF|title=Innovation in mediation support: The International Contact Group in Mindanao|publisher=C-r.org|accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ICG represented an innovation in peace process support, in that it was a hybrid body composed of both states and international non-governmental organisations (INGOs). The members were [[Turkey]], [[Saudi Arabia]], the [[United Kingdom]], and [[Japan]], [[The Asia Foundation]], the [[Centre for Humanitarian Dialogue]], [[Muhammadiyah]], and [[Conciliation Resources]]. When the Asia Foundation became an official member of the Third Party Monitoring Team in 2012, the Community of [[San’Egidio]] from Italy replaced the Asia Foundation in the ICG.

On 24 January 2014, Philippine government chief negotiator Miriam Coronel Ferer and  MILF chief negotiator Mohagher Iqbal signed a peace agreement in [[Kuala Lumpur]]. The agreement would pave the way for the creation of the new Muslim autonomous entity called "Bangsamoro" under a law to be approved by the Philippine Congress.

The government aims to set up the region by 2016. The agreement calls for Muslim self-rule in parts of the southern Philippines in exchange for a deactivation of rebel forces by the MILF. MILF forces would turn over their firearms to a third party to selected by the MILF and the Philippine government. A regional police force would be established, and the Philippine military would reduce the presence of troops and help disband private armies in the area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bangkokpost.com/print/391473/ |title=Bangkok Post article |publisher=Bangkok Post article |date=2014-01-25 |accessdate=2015-02-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the Agreement, the government committed to change a 37-year autonomy experiment whose current version, the [[Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao]] (ARMM), has failed to live up to the Moro people’s aspiration for freedom from a highly centralized government.&lt;ref name="newsinfo.inquirer.net"/&gt;

The '''Confucius Peace Prize''' ({{zh|s=孔子和平奖|t=孔子和平獎|p=Kǒngzǐ Hépíngjiǎng}}) is a Chinese alternative to the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] established in 2010 by the Association of Chinese Indigenous Arts&lt;ref name="Auto1H-1"&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/zhongwen/trad/china/2010/12/101209_brief_china_confucius.shtml 中國官方「否認設立孔子和平獎」]&lt;/ref&gt; in the People's Republic of China (PRC), in response to a proposal by business person Liu Zhiqin on November 17, 2010.

==Origins and first award==
The Confucius Peace Prize originated as a response to the announcement that Chinese dissident [[Liu Xiaobo]] had won the [[2010 Nobel Peace Prize]];&lt;ref name=confucius/&gt;&lt;ref name=20141211nytimes/&gt; the awarding of the prize to Liu was viewed negatively in China, with some in the government arguing that Liu did not promote "international friendship, disarmament, and peace meetings", the stated goals of the Nobel Peace Prize.&lt;ref name="The Age: China furious at Nobel's 'violation'"&gt;{{cite news|author=Garnaut, John |url=http://www.theage.com.au/world/china-furious-at-nobels-violation-20101008-16c29.html |title=China furious at Nobel's 'violation' |date=9 October 2010 |work=The Age |location=Australia  |accessdate=9 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Competing groups staked claims to its founding, and some have links to the Ministry of Culture.&lt;ref name=20141211nytimes/&gt;

According to ''[[The New York Times]]'', Liu Zhiqin, a prominent Chinese scholar and banker, was the first to propose the prize, in a commentary in the ''[[Global Times]]''.&lt;ref name="nyt"/&gt; Liu's commentary stated, "The Nobel Peace Prize Committee won Liu Xiaobo while losing the trust of 1.3&amp;nbsp;billion Chinese people. They support a criminal while creating 1.3&amp;nbsp;billion 'dissidents' that are dissatisfied with the Nobel Committee, which is definitely a bad decision. ... China's civil society should consider setting up a 'Confucius Peace Prize', launching the evaluation and selection and finding the real Peace Prize winners from all over the world. This is the best opportunity for the Chinese to declare China's view in peace and human rights to the world."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.globaltimes.cn/content/592778.shtml |title=Confucius Prize could be weapon in battle of ideas |author=Liu Zhiqin |date=2010-11-17 |work=[[Global Times]] |accessdate=2016-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Association of Chinese Indigenous Arts, which is registered with the Chinese Cultural Ministry, awarded the first prize to Taiwanese politician [[Lien Chan]] in December 2010, for his contribution to developing positive ties [[Cross-Strait relations|between Taiwan and mainland China]].&lt;ref name="NYtimes"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://news.yahoo.com/s/ap/20101207/ap_on_re_as/as_china_nobel |title=China to award prize to rival Nobel |publisher=Yahoo!

In the jostling, one group tried to create the "Confucius World Peace Prize" to rival the "Confucius Peace Prize".&lt;ref name=20141211nytimes/&gt;

==Purported cancellation and second award==
In September 2011, the [[Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China|Ministry of Culture]] stated that it would be disbanding the organizers of Confucius Peace Prize and cancelling the prize.&lt;ref name="CCMcancel"/&gt; The Ministry stated in a news conference on September 17 that there was improper uses of the Ministry's name.&lt;ref name="NYtimes"/&gt; The Association of Chinese Indigenous Arts was quick to blame a "rogue department" for the debacle surrounding the award.&lt;ref name="TelegraphCancel"/&gt;

Despite the cancellation, on November 15, 2011, ''[[The Guardian]]'' reported that the original organizers had formed a new committee, the China International Peace Studies Center, in Hong Kong, where they awarded the second Confucius Peace Prize to Russian prime minister [[Vladimir Putin]]. Other contenders were [[Angela Merkel]], [[Bill Gates]], [[Jacob Zuma]], [[Kofi Annan]], [[Yuan Longping]], [[Gyaincain Norbu]] (one of the [[Panchen Lama]]s), and [[Soong Chu-yu]]. Putin won for his opposition to [[NATO]] involvement in the [[2011 Libyan Civil War|Libyan Civil War]] as well as his decision to go to war in [[Second Chechen War|Chechnya in 1999]].&lt;ref name="bbc2011"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-15750979 |title=Vladimir Putin in China Confucius Peace Prize fiasco |date=2011-11-15 |accessdate=2011-11-15 |publisher=[[BBC]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the committee, Putin's "Iron hand and toughness revealed in this war impressed the Russians a lot, and he was regarded to be capable of bringing safety and stability to Russia." Putin was also praised for fulfilling his childhood dream of joining the [[KGB]].  The 2011 award, a gilded statuette of Confucius was given out on December 9 along with a certificate, although the committee did not mention a cash prize.&lt;ref name=NYtimes/&gt; The award ceremony featured a speech by [[Kong Qingdong]]. Kong claimed that the award accurately reflects [[Confucius]]'s original vision of peace.&lt;ref name=20111209voanews&gt;{{cite news |title=孔子和平奖二次颁发 获奖者再度缺席 |url=http://www.voanews.com/chinese/news/20111209-Peace-Prize-Putin-135310893.html |author=Zhang, Nan |accessdate=22 January 2012 |date=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The award and recipients==

The prize initially carried a financial reward of CNY100,000, and has been awarded at the same time as the Nobel Peace Prize.&lt;ref name=20141211nytimes&gt;http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2014/12/11/castro-awarded-confucius-peace-prize/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp1095244/&gt; In 2012, the China International Peace Studies Centre boasted that the new reward of $1.5 million – mostly derived from sales of works of the committee chairman's, Qiao Damo – was "more than the US$1.2 million that the recipient of this year's Nobel Peace Prize, will receive".&lt;ref name=scmp1095244&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1095244/annan-scientist-share-us15m-confucius-prize|title=Annan, scientist to share US$1.5m Confucius prize|work=South China Morning Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, ''The Guardian'' reported in 2015 that the cash prize was worth CNY500,000 (£51,000).&lt;ref name=20151022guardian&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2015/oct/22/zimbabwes-robert-mugabe-awarded-chinas-nobel-peace-prize|title=Zimbabwe's Robert Mugabe awarded 'China's Nobel peace prize'|author=Tom Phillips|work=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 ===
The shortlist for the 2012 award consisted of previous nominees [[Kofi Annan]], [[Bill Gates]], agricultural scientist [[Yuan Longping]], and [[Gyancain Norbu]], as well as [[Ban Ki-moon]], Thai prime minister [[Yingluck Shinawatra]], Chinese philosopher [[Tang Yijie]], and [[Wang Dingguo]], the last surviving female participant in Mao Zedong's [[Long March]].&lt;ref name=20120901time&gt;{{cite news |url=http://newsfeed.time.com/2012/09/11/chinas-confucius-prize-announces-its-wacky-2012-short-list/ |title=China's Confucius Prize Announces Its Wacky 2012 Short List |last=Boehler |first=Patrick |date=2012-09-11 |work=[[Time (magazine)|Time]] |accessdate=19 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a tie in the voting, the committee announced that Annan and Yuan would share the award.&lt;ref name="raymondli"/&gt;&lt;ref name=scmp1095244/&gt;

=== 2013 ===
Zen master [[Yicheng (monk)|Yicheng]] was awarded the 2013 prize for his work as chairman of the [[Buddhist Association of China]] and his contribution for Chinese Buddhism. As an addition to the Peace Prize in 2013 the first [[Confucius Art Prize]] was awarded. A gold medal was for calligrapher [[Ouyang Zhongshi]] and silver medals for Yang Lin and [[Hou Mingming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.sina.com.cn/s/blog_5f3d33510101b045.html|title=抱歉，您要访问的页面不存在或被删除！|publisher=Sina Corp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2014 ===
The ''Global Times'' reported that nominees included former Cuban president, [[Fidel Castro]], South Korean President [[Park Geun-hye]] and the UN Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]].&lt;ref name=npr370086460/&gt; The 2014 recipient of the prize was Castro, who when leader of Cuba, "never used any violence or force when faced with problems and conflicts in international relations, especially in Cuba's relationship with the United States."&lt;ref name="NYT2"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com//2014/12/11/castro-awarded-confucius-peace-prize |work=[[The New York Times]] |title=China's Defiant Choice for Its Peace Prize: Castro |author=Edward Wong |date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NR2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/394436/fidel-castros-perfect-peace-prize-jay-nordlinger |work=[[National Review]] |title=The Corner: Fidel Castro's Perfect Peace Prize |author=Jay Nordlinger |date=11 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro's prize was received by a Cuban student in China.&lt;ref name="npr370086460"/&gt;

=== 2015 ===
Nominated for the award in 2015 were the [[Chinese Taoist Association]], [[Ban Ki-moon]], former Japanese prime ministers [[Yasuo Fukuda]] and [[Tomiichi Murayama]], Kazakhstan president [[Nursultan Nazarbayev]], [[Bill Gates]], Chinese-American politician [[Anna Chennault]], South Korean president [[Park Geun-hye]], [[Hsing Yun]] of the [[Fo Guang Shan]] Buddhist movement in Taiwan, and [[Robert Mugabe]] of Zimbabwe. Mugabe was eventually declared the winner for "working tirelessly to build the political and economic stability of his country, bringing peace to the people of Zimbabwe, strongly supporting pan-Africanism and African independence, and making unparalleled contributions for the renaissance of African civilisation."&lt;ref name=20151002shanghaiist/&gt; One of the committee's 76 members disclosed that only 36 voted for Mugabe over concerns for his record, saying that "Mugabe has been in power for such a long time that he could be easily be labelled a dictator, tyrant or despot."&lt;ref name=20151022guardian/&gt; Mugabe, who made a speech to the United Nations that day in which he declared that "we are not gays", did not collect his prize.&lt;ref name=20151002shanghaiist&gt;{{cite web|url=http://shanghaiist.com/2015/10/22/robert-mugabe-confucius-peace-prize.php|title=Zimbabwean dictator Robert Mugabe named winner of the Confucius Peace Prize, fails to show up at award ceremony|work=Shanghaiist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The award drew out critics of Mugabe and his human rights record. An unofficial spokesman said that the Chinese government had notified Zimbabwe that it was not associated with the conferring organisation. Mugabe repudiated the award, a spokesman saying that he "receives many prizes without even knowing, approving or receiving them. What is dramatic in this case is that oppositional interests drew a revolver at the mentioning of an honour or prize to Robert Mugabe.

==Response to Confucius Peace Prize==
Chinese sources have not treated the prize seriously. The Ministry of Culture of the People's Republic of China denied any cooperation with the Association of Chinese Indigenous Arts to present the prize,&lt;ref name=e /&gt; stating that prior to foreign press reports, the Ministry "had never even heard of the name". The ministry added that "the government is very careful" and "if the government genuinely intended to establish a 'Confucius Peace prize', it would not have been implemented so sloppily."&lt;ref name=e /&gt; Mainland media did not widely report about the prize in 2010,&lt;ref name=e /&gt; with journalists claiming that they had come across neither the organization nor the prize, believing it to be "闹剧" (a farce).&lt;ref name=e /&gt;

Netizens in Mainland China responded to the Prize with widespread humour as well as derision, referring to the prize organizers as "bullheaded dreaming idiots", "jokes", and "embarrassments to Chinese",&lt;ref name="Auto1H-2"&gt;[http://hk.apple.nextmedia.com/news/art/20101206/14736240 《京報籲設「孔子和平獎」惹恥笑》] - 蘋果日報 - 6-12-2010&lt;/ref&gt; as well as suspicion that the prize was a practical joke.&lt;ref name=e /&gt;

The Confucius Peace Prize's first winner, Lien Chan, claimed he had not officially heard that he had won; an aide said that they had only received "secondhand information from journalists".&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/09/world/asia/09china.html |title=China's Answer to Nobel Mystifies Its Winner |first=Edward |last=Wong |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=2010-12-08 |accessdate=2010-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This contradicted a statement in the ''[[Global Times]]'' by the chairman of the Confucius Peace Prize Committee, Tan Liuchang, that Lien had been contacted by the committee.&lt;ref name="global"&gt;{{cite news |author=Liu, Linlin |url=http://china.globaltimes.cn/society/2010-12/600306.html |title=NGO creates 'Peace Prize' |date=9 December 2010 |work=Global Times |accessdate=15 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110905073941/http://china.globaltimes.cn/society/2010-12/600306.html |archivedate=5 September 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tsai Chi-chang, a spokesperson for the opposition [[Democratic Progressive Party]] in Taiwan, said the award should not be taken seriously.&lt;ref name="times"/&gt;

Officials from the Taiwanese government are reported to have found the award of the Confucius Peace Prize to Lien Chan "amusing".&lt;ref name=confucius&gt;{{cite web|last=Martina |first=Michael |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6B81YC20101209 | title=China stood up by winner of 'Confucius peace prize' |agency=Reuters |date=9 December 2010 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
When asked by a reporter about the prize, a spokesman for Vladimir Putin said that he had heard about the award through the press, but that "we do not know much about the prize."&lt;ref name=NYtimes/&gt;

Western media, however, have reacted to the prize as genuine. ''[[The Economist]]'' compared the substitute award to the reaction by [[Nazi Germany]] and the creation of the [[German National Prize for Art and Science]] after [[Carl von Ossietzky]] was prohibited from accepting his Nobel Prize in 1935, as well as the [[Soviet Union]] preventing [[Andrei Sakharov]] from accepting his Nobel Peace Prize in 1975.&lt;ref name="Asia view"&gt;{{cite news |title=The empty chair |work=[[The Economist]] |url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/asiaview/2010/12/china_and_nobel_peace_prize |date=12 December 2010 |accessdate=12 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[National Review]]'' likewise compared the prize to Hitler's and Stalin's responses to the Nobel Peace Prize.&lt;ref name="NR1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nationalreview.com/corner/254791/nazis-and-soviets-jay-nordlinger |work=[[National Review]] |title=The Corner: Like the Nazis and the Soviets ... |author=Jay Nordlinger |date=8 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]]'' has described the prize as "[s]omething of a [[Internet troll|trolling]] exercise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Keating |first1=Joshua |title="Chinese Nobel" Awarded to Dictator and Mass Murderer Robert Mugabe |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2015/10/23/robert_mugabe_wins_2015_confucius_prize.html |website=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |accessdate=2015-10-25 |date=2015-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Global Times'' reported that the five 2011 nominees were selected based on their being the winners of an online poll.&lt;ref name="global"/&gt; However, when asked about the details of the online vote, the organizer said they failed to carry it out because of "technical problems", The ''South China Morning Post'' reported.&lt;ref name=20101209scmp&gt;{{cite web | url=http://topics.scmp.com/news/china-news-watch/article/Confusion-Prize-brings-Beijing-doubtful-reward | title=Confusion Prize brings Beijing doubtful reward | work=South China Morning Post | date=December 9, 2010 | accessdate=November 15, 2011 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120716100223/http://topics.scmp.com/news/china-news-watch/article/Confusion-Prize-brings-Beijing-doubtful-reward | archivedate=July 16, 2012 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Democratic Party of Albanians''' ({{lang-sq|Partia Demokratike Shqiptare}}; {{lang-mk|Демократска партија на Албанците}}, ''Demokratska Partija na Albancite'') or DPA is a [[List of political parties in the Republic of Macedonia|political party]] of ethnic [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia]]. The DPA is a merger of the Party for Democratic Prosperity of Albanians (PDPA) and the [[People's Democratic Party (Macedonia)|People's Democratic Party]] (NDP) which took place in June 1997. The former party was established in 1994 after some radical members of the [[Party for Democratic Prosperity]], led by Menduh Thaçi and [[Arbën Xhaferi]], left the PDP and the latter party was founded in August 1990 as a more radical opponent of the PDP.
[[File:DPA in Tetovo, Macedonia.JPG|thumb|left|200px|DPA sign in Tetovo]]
At the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2002|2002 legislative elections]], the party won 5.2% of the popular vote and 7 out of 120 seats. The party lost its status as a government party due to the defeat of the VMRO-DPMNE. At the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2006|2006 parliamentary elections]], the party increased its support, winning 7.5% of the vote and 11 seats. After the elections the DPA entered the government coalition led by the [[VMRO-DPMNE]]. DPA returned to opposition after the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2008|2008 legislative early election]].

In the [[Macedonian parliamentary election, 2011|2011 parliamentary election]], DPA received 5.9% of the popular vote, winning 8 seats. This is a loss of 3 seats from the previous election.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=136984879 |title=Conservative Leader Claims 3rd Term In Macedonia |work=[[NPR]] |date=2011-06-06 |accessdate=2011-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Christian grew up in Los Angeles. She learned to write at what she calls a "real-life school of writing".  

==Published works==
Christian is the author of two books designed to help people who want to join or start their own ecovillages or other [[intentional communities]]. In ''Creating a Life Together: Practical Tools to Grow Ecovillages and Intentional Communities'', she uses success stories, cautionary tales, and step-by-step advice to cover typical time-frames and costs; the role of founders; getting started as a group; vision documents; power, governance, and decision-making; legal structures; finding and financing land; zoning issues; sustainable site plans; selecting new members; and good process and communication skills for dealing well with conflict.

In ''Finding Community: How to Join an Ecovillage or Intentional Community'', she covers researching, visiting, evaluating, and joining communities.

During the 1970s and 80s Christian wrote articles for ''New Age'' magazine, ''[[Yoga Journal]]'', and ''East West Journal''. She hosted radio interview programs in Hawaii and in northern California.&lt;ref name="about"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dianaleafechristian.org/about_diana.html|title=Diana Leafe Christian: About|publisher=Diana Leafe Christian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s Christian published a newsletter, ''Growing Community'', about starting new communities.

'''Electoralism''' is a term first used by [[Terry Karl]], professor of [[political science]] at [[Stanford University]], to describe a "half-way" transition from [[authoritarian]] rule toward [[democracy|democratic]] rule. As a topic in the [[dominant party system]] political science literature, electoralism describes a situation where the transition out of hard-authoritarian rule is initiated and managed by the incumbent regime. However, due to the dominant position of the incumbent regime throughout the transition process, the transition fails to attain the institutional qualities of [[liberal democracy]]. Other terms, such as guided transition or managed transition have been used to describe this process.

Under electoralism, the regime essentially conducts the electoral aspects of democratic governance in a relatively 'free and fair' manner. Massive acts of [[voting fraud]] and election-day intimidation are essentially absent. However, other features of democracy, such as the [[rule of law]] and institutional [[separation of powers]], are absent under electoralism. The entire election process is skewed in favor of the incumbent regime. The media tends to ignore or paint the opposition in a negative light, the high court and election commission tends to make judgements in favor of the incumbent, and on some occasions, opposition rallies are denied or canceled by the police.

{{Taxation|expanded=International}}
A '''financial transaction tax''' is a [[tax|levy]] on a specific type of [[financial transaction]] for a particular purpose. The concept has been most commonly associated with the [[financial sector]]; it is not usually considered to include [[consumption tax]]es paid by consumers.&lt;ref&gt;With the exception, perhaps, of the [[Financial transaction tax#Bank transaction tax|bank transaction tax]] which taxes transactions on bank accounts and the [[Automated Payment Transaction tax]] which taxes all transactions.&lt;/ref&gt;

A transaction tax is not a levy on [[financial institution]]s per se; rather, it is charged only on the specific transactions that are designated as taxable. So if an institution never carries out the taxable transaction, then it will never be subject to the transaction tax.&lt;ref&gt;This illustration is attributed to the public lecture of economist Rodney Schmidt, Principal Researcher, [[The North-South Institute]], 20 June 2010, at the "[[People's Summit]]", held at [[Ryerson University]] in Toronto, Ontario, Canada.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, if an institution carries out only one such transaction, then it will only be taxed for that one transaction. As such, this tax is neither a [[Bank tax#2. Financial Activities Tax .28FAT.29|financial activities tax (FAT)]], nor a Financial stability contribution (FSC), or "[[bank tax]]",&lt;ref name="distraction"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20100624/Flaherty-on-bank-tax-100624/ |title=Flaherty says global bank tax a distraction for G20 |author=[[The Canadian Press]] |date=24 June 2010 |work= |publisher=[[CTV news]] via [[The Canadian Press]] |accessdate=24 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101031060550/http://www.ctv.ca/CTVNews/Canada/20100624/Flaherty-on-bank-tax-100624/ |archivedate=31 October 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; for example. This clarification is important in discussions about using a [[financial transaction]] tax as a tool to selectively discourage excessive [[speculation]] without discouraging any other activity (as [[John Maynard Keynes]] originally envisioned it in 1936).&lt;ref name="Spratt"/&gt;

There are several types of financial transaction taxes. Each has its own purpose. Some have been implemented, while some are only proposals. Concepts are found in various organizations and regions around the world. Some are domestic and meant to be used within one nation; whereas some are multinational.&lt;ref name=Page&gt;Richard T.

==History of the concept==
[[File:Keynes 1933.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Maynard Keynes]] (1933) envisaged the financial transaction tax in 1936]]
The year 1694 saw an early implementation of a financial transaction tax in the form of a [[Stamp duty in the United Kingdom|stamp duty]] at the [[London Stock Exchange]]. The tax was payable by the buyer of shares for the official stamp on the legal document needed to formalize the purchase. {{As of | 2011}}, it is the oldest tax still in existence in Great Britain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Reshaping globalisation: a new order for international financial markets |author1=Heribert Dieter | publisher=Institute for Global Dialotue | year=2003 | isbn= 978-1-919697-64-2| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gX2wAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22stamp+duty%22++1694++%22london+stock+exchange%22&amp;dq=%22stamp+duty%22++1694++%22london+stock+exchange%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=6so9TNWMBIK-4gb1rtzGAg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAA | pages=7 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States instituted a [[transfer tax]] on all sales or transfers of stock in The Revenue Act of 1914 (Act of 22 October 1914 (ch. 331, 38 Stat. 745)). Instead of a fixed tax amount per transaction, the tax was in the amount of 0.2% of the transaction value (20 basis points, bips). This was doubled to 0.4% (40 bips) in 1932, in the context of the Great Depression, then eliminated in 1966.

In 1936, in the wake of the [[Great Depression]], [[John Maynard Keynes]] advocated the wider use of financial transaction taxes.&lt;ref name="Spratt"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Keynes&gt;{{cite book |url=http://biblioeconomicus.googlepages.com/KeynesJohnMaynard-TheGeneralTheoryOfEmploymentInterestAndMoney.pdf |title= The General Theory of Employment, Interest and Money |author= John Maynard Keynes |year=1936}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|105}} He proposed the levying of a small transaction tax on dealings on [[Wall Street]], in the United States, where he argued excessive speculation by uninformed financial traders increased [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] (see Keynes financial transaction tax below).

In 1972 the [[Bretton Woods system]] for stabilizing currencies effectively came to an end. In that context, [[James Tobin]], influenced by the work of Keynes, suggested his more specific [[currency transaction tax]] for stabilizing currencies on a larger global scale.&lt;ref name="Tobin"&gt;{{cite journal |url=https://ideas.repec.org/a/eej/eeconj/v4y1978i3-4p153-159.html |title=A Proposal for International Monetary Reform |author=James Tobin |date=July–October 1978 |work=Eastern Economic Journal|publisher=Eastern Economic Association |pages=153–159|accessdate=2010-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1989, at the Buenos Aires meetings of the [[International Institute of Public Finance]], [[University of Wisconsin-Madison]] Professor of Economics [[Edgar L. Feige]] proposed extending the tax reform ideas of [[John Maynard Keynes]],&lt;ref&gt;Keynes, J.M. (1936).

The goal of the APT tax is to significantly improve economic efficiency, enhance stability in financial markets, and reduce to a minimum the costs of tax administration (assessment, collection, and compliance costs).&lt;ref name=Akst&gt;Daniel Akst for the New York Times. 2 February 2003.

As the [[EU]], European free trade and [[Euro]] came together, various financial transaction taxes were considered openly.  One non-tax regulatory equivalent of Tobin's narrow tax, to require "non-interest bearing deposit requirements on all open foreign exchange positions", was considered in particularly but rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EsaCMRHILb8C&amp;pg=PA196&amp;lpg=PA196&amp;dq=differentiate%20speculation%20from%20hedging%20tax&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=omSuLsSdvj&amp;sig=iAXx7I7FUrAWNfOqDtazApn45mE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjp_dSDgL_OAhVGpx4KHQaBCb4Q6AEIeDAS#v=onepage&amp;q=differentiate%20speculation%20from%20hedging%20tax&amp;f=false|title=Europe's Monetary Future|first=Stefan|last=Collignon|date=1 January 1994|publisher=Fairleigh Dickinson Univ Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;  During the 1980s the Chicago School view became dominant, that speculation served a vital purpose in keeping currencies accurately reflecting the prospects of their economies, and that even very short term transactions in response to news could in fact reflect fundamental analysis.

Economic literature of the period 1990s-2000s emphasized that derivatives and other variations in the terms of payment in trade-related transactions (so-called "swaps" for instance) provided a ready means of evading any tax other than the [[Automated Payment Transaction tax]] since it uniformly taxed all transactions.  Other measures and exemptions from such transaction taxes, to avoid punishing hedging (a form of insurance for cashflows) were also proposed.  These tended to lead to generally more complex schemes that were not implemented, in part due to lack of standardization of risk reporting under the [[Basel I]] framework, which was itself a response to 1980s financial speculation crises.

However, disclosure had not kept pace with practices.  Regulators and policy-makers and theorists by the 1990s had to deal with increasingly complex [[financial engineering]] and the "avoidance by change of product mix... market participants would have an incentive to substitute out of financial instruments subject to the tax and into instruments not subject to it.  In this fashion, markets would innovate so as to avoid the tax" as they were doing with the creation of [[financial derivative]]s.  "The real issue is how to design a tax that takes account of all the methods and margins of substitution that investors have for changing their patterns of activity to avoid the tax. [as] suggested by Pollin et al. (1999)." - Palley, 2000 &lt;ref name="globalpolicy.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.globalpolicy.org/social-and-economic-policy/global-taxes-1-79/currency-transaction-taxes/45990-destabilizing-speculation-and-the-case-for-an-international-currency-transactions-tax.html|title=Destabilizing Speculation and the Case for an International Currency Transactions Tax|first=|last=Administrator|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The global adoption of a small flat rate [[Automated Payment Transaction tax]] whose base included all transactions would eliminate evasion and avoidance possibilities since the tax would apply equally at all substitution margins. 
Advocates including Pollin, Palley and Baker (2000) &lt;ref&gt;Baker, D., "The Case for a Unilateral Speculation Tax in the United State," Briefing Paper, Center for Economic and Policy Research, Washington DC 20036, 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; emphasized that transaction taxes "have clearly not prevented the efficient functioning of" financial markets in the 20th century.

Many theorists raised the issue that hedging and speculation were more of a spectrum than a distinct duality of goals.  "Academic studies (e.g. Bodnar et al, 1998) show that companies usually incorporate predictions of future price levels (i.e. a ‘view’) when executing hedges (a fact which will come as no surprise to most risk management practitioners). If hedging is really just about reducing risk, then why should our expectations of future market direction have any bearing on our hedging decisions? If we hedge 50% of our exposure, instead of 80% or 100%, because we feel that the price / rate of the underlying exposure is more likely to move in our favour, does this meet the criteria for speculation?...On one level (at the extremes), there is no doubt that hedging and speculation are very different activities. However, once you move beyond the straightforward elimination of open positions, into more nuanced transactions involving complex hedging strategies or tenuous relationships between hedges and exposures, the distinction between a hedge and a bet becomes increasingly vague."&lt;ref&gt;http://validusrm.com/news/hedging-and-speculation-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/&lt;/ref&gt;

To avoid this problem, most proposals emphasized taxing clearly speculative high-volume very-short-term (seconds to hours) transactions that could not in general reflect any change of fundamental exposure or cashflow expectation.  Some of these emphasized the automated nature of the trade.  FTT proposals often emerge in response to specific crisis.  For example, the December 1994 [[Mexican peso crisis]] reduced confidence in its currency. In that context, [[Paul Bernd Spahn]] re-examined the [[Tobin tax]], opposed its original form, and instead proposed his own version in 1995.&lt;ref name="Paul Bernd Spahn"&gt;
{{cite web | url = http://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/profs/spahn/pdf/publ/7-041.pdf | title = International Financial Flows and Transactions Taxes: Survey and Options | author= [[Paul Bernd Spahn]] |date= 16 June 1995|work= |publisher= University of Frankfurt/Main; Paper originally published with the [[International Monetary Fund]] as Working Paper WP/95/60. | accessdate = 2010-01-13}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In the context of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], many economists, governments, and organizations around the world re-examined, or were asked to re-examine, the concept of a financial transaction tax, or its various forms. As a result, various new forms of financial transaction taxes were proposed, such as the [[European Union financial transaction tax|EU financial transaction tax]].   The outcry after this crisis had major political, legal and economic fallout.  By the 2010s the [[Basel II]] and [[Basel III]] frameworks required reporting that would help to differentiate hedging from speculation.&lt;ref name="keydifferences.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://keydifferences.com/difference-between-hedging-and-speculation.html|title=Difference Between Hedging and Speculation (with Comparison Chart) - Key Differences|date=6 January 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Economic thought was tending to reject the belief that they could not be differentiated, or (as the "Chicago School" had held) should not be.  However, even Basel III did not require detailed enough disclosure of risk to enable a clear differentiation of hedging vs. speculation.

As another example of an FTT proposal as a warning to speculators, or as response to crisis, in March 2016 [[China]] drafted rules to impose a genuine [[currency transaction tax]] and this was referred to in financial press as a '''Tobin tax''' [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2016-03-15/china-said-to-draft-rules-for-tobin-tax-on-currency-transactions].  This was widely viewed as a warning to curb shorting of its currency the [[Renminbi|yuan]].  It was however expected to keep this tax at 0% initially, calculating potential revenue from different rate schemes and exemptions, and not to impose the actual tax unless speculation increased.

Also in 2016 [[US Democratic Party]] [[POTUS]] nominee [[Hillary Clinton]] asserted that speculation had "placed stress on our markets, created instability, and enabled unfair and abusive trading strategies" and that as [[POTUS]] she would seek to "impose a tax on harmful high-frequency trading and reform rules to make our stock markets fairer, more open, and transparent.".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hillaryclinton.com/issues/wall-street/|title=Hillary Clinton on Wall Street reform|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term "high-frequency" implied that only a few large volume transaction players engaged in [[arbitrage]] would likely be affected.  In this respect, Clinton was following the general 1990s trend to focus on automated transactions in particular, those which could not reflect any genuine human-reviewed fundamental risk or hedge analysis.

She also vowed to "Impose a risk fee on the largest financial institutions. Big banks and financial companies would be required to pay a fee based on their size and their risk of contributing to another crisis."  How such fees would be assessed, and whether they amounted to a tax, were an active topic of speculation in the financial community, which expected them to follow [[Basel III]] definitions with further refinements.

==Purpose==
Although every financial transaction tax (FTT) proposal has its own specific intended purpose, there are some general intended purposes which are common to most of them. Below are some of those general commonalities. The intended purpose may or may not be achieved.

;Curbing volatility of financial markets
In 1936, when Keynes first proposed a financial transaction tax, he wrote, "Speculators may do no harm as bubbles on a steady stream of enterprise. But the situation is serious when enterprise becomes the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation."&lt;ref name=Keynes/&gt;{{rp|104–105}}  Rescuing enterprise from becoming "the bubble on a whirlpool of speculation" was also [[Tobin tax#Tobin.27s concept|an intended purpose of]] the 1972 [[Tobin tax]]&lt;ref name="Jubilee-trans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Reiermann"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Summaries"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EMN1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Translated quote from [[James Tobin]]: "The tax on foreign exchange transactions was devised to cushion exchange rate fluctuations." For source, see the following references.&lt;!-- This is improper; sources should be identified within this reference not somewhere else, which is likely to be moved or edited away if it hasn't already --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is a common theme in several other types of financial transaction taxes. For the specific type of [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]] in specific areas, see [[Financial transaction taxes#Types of financial transaction taxes|each specific type of financial transaction taxes]] below. An exception to the purpose of "curbing of volatility" is likely the "bank transaction tax".

;Curbing speculation without discouraging hedging

The role of large numbers of individual speculators willing to take both short and long positions without prejudice,  does play some role in preventing price bubbles and asset inflation.  However, excess speculation is often deemed not only a source of volatility but a distraction of talent and dangerous shift of focus for a developed economy.  By contrast, hedging is necessary for the stability of enterprises.  Tax schemes in general seek to tax speculation - seen as akin to [[gambling]] - while trying not to interfere with hedging (a form of [[insurance]]).  A brief summary of the differences is that:&lt;ref name="keydifferences.com"/&gt; 
*hedging protects an existing investment against unforeseen price changes, while speculation takes on additional risk the investor could have avoided
*hedging is a means to manage or limit price risk, while speculation actually relies on taking a risk for profit (and is in this respect similar to [[gambling]])
*hedging protects against price changes and makes them less relevant to the overall price of outputs sold to the public, while speculation incurs risk to make a profit specifically from price volatility
*hedging is a form of insurance for risk averse investors, speculation is for those seeking more rapid returns through higher risk

It can be difficult to draw a clear distinction between hedging activities and speculation "if the actual exposure cannot be clearly ascertained, then differentiating between a hedging transaction and a speculative trade can become very complicated; if the impact of the underlying exposure is opaque, then the risk-reducing impact of the hedge becomes obscured (if it ever existed)...once you move beyond the straightforward elimination of open positions, into more nuanced transactions involving complex hedging strategies or tenuous relationships between hedges and exposures, the distinction between a hedge and a bet becomes increasingly vague" - [http://validusrm.com/news/hedging-and-speculation-two-sides-of-the-same-coin/].  In general the advocates of financial transaction tax point to [[Basel III]] and other treaties and regulations that have increasingly required disclosure to make it easier to ascertain the degree of hedging or speculation in a given transaction or set of transactions.&lt;ref name="globalpolicy.org"/&gt;

Sheer duration of a holding is the most cogent clue:  Day traders all engage in speculation by definition. [http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/the-difference-between-speculating-and-hedging-whe.html].

;More fair and equitable tax collection
Another common theme is the proposed intention to create a system of more fair and equitable tax collection. The [[Automated Payment Transaction tax]] (APT tax) taxes the broadest possible tax base, namely all transactions including all real and financial asset transactions. Instead of introducing progressivity through the tax rate structure, the flat rate [[APT tax]] introduces progressiveness through the tax base since the highest income and wealth groups undertake a disproportionate share of financial transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/25299549/Feige-APT-Presentation-to-Tax-Reform-Panel-2005|title=Feige APT Presentation to Tax Reform Panel 2005|work=scribd.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the context of the [[financial crisis of 2007–2008]], many economists, governments, and organizations around the world re-examined, or were asked to re-examine, the concept of a financial transaction tax, or its various forms. In response to a request from the [[G20]] nations, the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) delivered a report in 2010 titled "A Fair and Substantial Contribution by the Financial Sector" which made reference to a financial transaction tax as one of several options.&lt;ref name="interim"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.globalprintmonitor.com/en/gpm-blogs/financial-crisis/21750-a-fair-and-substantial-contribution-by-the-financial-sector-interim-report-for-the-g-20|title=A Fair and Substantial Contribution by the Financial Sector Interim Report for the G-20 |author=[[International Monetary Fund]] |date=16 April 2010 |work= |publisher= [[International Monetary Fund]]; Excerpt and Link to Full Report as a PDF – republished online by Global Print Monitor on 22 April 2010|accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/business/8633455.stm|title=IMF proposes two big new bank taxes to fund bail-outs |author= [[BBC]]|date=21 April 2010 |work= |publisher= [[BBC]]|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to several leading figures, the "fairness" aspect of a financial transaction tax has eclipsed, and/or replaced, "prevention of volatility" as the most important purpose for the tax. Fraser Reilly-King of [[Halifax Initiative]] is one such economist.&lt;ref name ="Fraser"&gt;Public lecture of economist Fraser Reilly-King of [[Halifax Initiative]], 20 June 2010, at the "People's Summit", held at [[Ryerson University]], Toronto, Ontario&lt;/ref&gt; He proposes that an FTT would not have addressed the root [[causes of the United States housing bubble]] which, in part, triggered the financial crisis of 2007–2008. Nevertheless, he sees an FTT as important for bringing a more equitable balance to the taxation of all parts of the economy.&lt;ref name ="Fraser"/&gt;

;Less susceptible to tax evasion than alternatives
According to some economists, a financial transaction tax is less susceptible to [[tax avoidance and tax evasion]] than other types of taxes proposed for the financial sector. The [[Automated Payment Transaction tax]] ([[APT tax]])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/1468-0327.00067/abstract;jsessionid=C8630A1710B177B59781F368F3042AC8.d01t04|title=Wiley Online Library: Not Found|publisher=|via=onlinelibrary.wiley.com|doi=10.1111/1468-0327.00067|volume=15|year=2000|journal=Economic Policy|pages=474–511|author=Feige E.

[[Joseph Stiglitz]], former Senior Vice President and [[World Bank Chief Economist|Chief Economist]] of the [[World Bank]] affirmed [[Financial transaction tax#Technical feasibility|the "technical feasibility" of the tax]]. Although Tobin said his tax idea was unfeasible in practice, Stiglitz noted that modern technology meant that was no longer the case and said that the tax is "much more feasible today" than a few decades ago, when Tobin disagreed.&lt;ref name="Edmund Conway"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/financetopics/financialcrisis/6262242/Joseph-Stiglitz-calls-for-Tobin-tax-on-all-financial-trading-transactions.html |title=Joseph Stiglitz calls for Tobin tax on all financial trading transactions |author=Edmund Conway |date=5 October 2009 |work= |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |accessdate=17 March 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Fraser Reilly-King of Halifax Initiative also points out that the key issue and advantage of an FTT is its relatively superior functional ability to prevent [[tax evasion]] in the financial sector.&lt;ref&gt;Public lecture of economist Fraser Reilly of [[Halifax Initiative]], 20 June 2010, at the "People's Summit", held at [[Ryerson University]], Toronto, Ontario&lt;/ref&gt; Economist Rodney Schmidt, principal researcher of [[The North-South Institute]], also concurred that a financial transaction tax is more technically feasible than the [[Bank tax#1.

==Types of financial transaction taxes==
Transaction taxes can be raised on the sale of specific financial assets, such as stock, bonds or futures; they can be applied to currency exchange transactions; or they can be general taxes levied against a mix of different transactions.&lt;ref name="Spratt"/&gt;

===Securities transaction tax===

[[John Maynard Keynes]] was among the first proponents of a [[securities]] transaction tax.&lt;ref name="Spratt"/&gt; In 1936 he proposed that a small tax should be levied on dealings on [[Wall Street]], in the United States, where he argued that excessive speculation by uninformed financial traders increased volatility. For Keynes, the key issue was the proportion of 'speculators' in the market, and his concern that, if left unchecked, these types of players would become too dominant.&lt;ref name="Spratt"/&gt; Keynes writes: "The introduction of a substantial Government [[transfer tax]] on all transactions might prove the most serviceable reform available, with a view to mitigating the predominance of speculation over enterprise in the United States. (1936:159–60)"&lt;ref name="Spratt"/&gt;

===Currency transaction tax===
{{main|Currency transaction tax}}

A currency transaction tax is a tax placed on a specific type of currency transaction for a specific purpose. This term has been most commonly associated with the financial sector, as opposed to consumption taxes paid by consumers. The most frequently discussed versions of a currency transaction tax are the Tobin tax, [[Edgar L. Feige]]'s [[Automated Payment Transaction tax]] and [[Spahn tax]]. The [[Automated Payment Transaction tax]] requires that all transactions be taxed regardless of the means of payment. As such, it proposes a unique tax on currency transactions collected at the time currency leaves or enters the banking system. Since each transaction mediated by currency can not be directly taxed, the APT tax proposes a brokerage fee on currency deposits and withdrawals that is some multiple of the flat transaction tax rate applied to all payments made via electronic payments mechanisms.

;Tobin tax
In 1972 the economist [[James Tobin]] proposed a tax on all [[Spot market|spot conversions]] of one currency into another. The so-called [[Tobin tax]] is intended to put a penalty on short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency. Tobin suggested his currency transaction tax in 1972 in his Janeway Lectures at Princeton, shortly after the [[Bretton Woods system]] effectively ended.&lt;ref name="Tobin"/&gt; In 2001, James Tobin looked back at the 1994 [[Mexican peso crisis]], the [[1997 Asian financial crisis]], and the [[1998 Russian financial crisis]], and said: "[My proposed] tax [idea] on foreign exchange transactions... dissuades speculators as many investors invest their money in foreign exchange on a very short-term basis. If this money is suddenly withdrawn, countries have to drastically increase interest rates for their currency to still be attractive. But high interest is often disastrous for a national economy, as the nineties' crises in Mexico, South East Asia and Russia have proven...."&lt;ref name="Jubilee-trans"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.jubilee2000uk.org/worldnews/lamerica/james_tobin_030901_english.htm |title= James Tobin: "The antiglobalisation movement has highjacked my name"|author= [[Der Spiegel]] – German interview translated into English|date=3 September 2001 |work= |publisher= Jubilee Research, a successor to [[Jubilee 2000]] UK|accessdate=11 February 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20050306201839/http://www.jubilee2000uk.org/worldnews/lamerica/james_tobin_030901_english.htm |archivedate = 6 March 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reiermann"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-20017795.html |title=Die missbrauchen meinen Namen |trans-title=They Are Misusing My Name |author1=Christian Von Reiermann |author2=Michaela Schießl |date= 3 September 2001 |work=Der Spiegel |accessdate=2010-01-01 |quote=SPIEGEL: Diese Bewegung will die Einführung einer Steuer auf Devisengeschäfte.

Die Devisenumsatzsteuer war dafür gedacht, Wechselkursschwankungen einzudämmen. Die Idee ist ganz simpel: Bei jedem Umtausch von einer Währung in die andere würde eine kleine Steuer fällig, sagen wir von einem halben Prozent des Umsatzes. So schreckt man Spekulanten ab. Denn viele Investoren legen ihr Geld sehr kurzfristig in Währungen an. Wird dieses Geld plötzlich zurückgezogen, müssen die Länder die Zinsen drastisch anheben, damit die Währung attraktiv bleibt. Hohe Zinsen aber sind oft desaströs für die heimische Wirtschaft, wie die Krisen in Mexiko, Südostasien und Russland während der neunziger Jahre gezeigt haben. Meine Steuer würde Notenbanken kleiner Länder Handlungsspielraum zurückgeben und dem Diktat der Finanzmärkte etwas entgegensetzen."}} (Interview with James Tobin)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Summaries"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,154539,00.html |title= They are misusing my name|date=2001-09-03|work= English Summaries [of quotes in Spiegel Online]|publisher= Spiegel Online International|accessdate=2010-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="EMN1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eumed.net/cursecon/textos/tobin-antiglob.htm|title=James Tobin-El movimiento antiglobalización abusa de mi nombre|work=eumed.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''It is intended to put a penalty on short-term financial round-trip excursions into another currency''

;Spahn tax
[[Paul Bernd Spahn]] opposed the original form of a Tobin Tax in a Working Paper ''International Financial Flows and Transactions Taxes: Survey and Options'', concluding "...the original Tobin tax is not viable. First, it is virtually impossible to distinguish between normal liquidity trading and speculative noise trading. If the tax is generally applied at high rates, it will severely impair financial operations and create international liquidity problems, especially if derivatives are taxed as well."&lt;ref name="Paul Bernd Spahn"/&gt; However, on 16 June 1995 Spahn suggested that "Most of the difficulties of the Tobin tax could be resolved, possibly with a two-tier rate structure consisting of a low-rate financial transactions tax and an exchange surcharge at prohibitive rates."&lt;ref name="Paul Bernd Spahn"/&gt; This new form of tax, the [[Spahn tax]], was later approved by the Belgian Federal Parliament in 2004.&lt;ref name="ecb.int"&gt;[[European Central Bank|ECB]] (2004). [http://www.ecb.int/ecb/legal/pdf/en_con_2004_34_f_sign.pdf Opinion of the European Central Bank (CON/2004/34)]&lt;/ref&gt;

''It has a two-tier rate structure consisting of a low rate financial transactions tax and an exchange surcharge at prohibitive rates.''

;Special Drawing Rights
On 19 September 2001, retired speculator [[George Soros]] put forward a proposal, issuing [[special drawing rights]] (SDR) that the rich countries would pledge for the purpose of providing international assistance and the alleviation of poverty and other approved objectives. According to Soros this could make a substantial amount of money available almost immediately. In 1997, IMF member governments agreed to a one-time special allocation of SDRs, totaling approximately $27.5 billion. This is slightly less than 0.1% of the global GDP. Members having 71% of the total vote needed for implementation have already ratified the decision. All it needs is the approval of the [[United States Congress]]. If the scheme is successfully tested, it could be followed by an annual issue of SDRs and the amounts could be scaled up "so that they could have a meaningful impact on many of our most pressing social issues".&lt;ref name=soros&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/soros.html |title=George Soros: Open Societies, Sovereignty, and International Terrorism |author=[[George Soros]] |date=19 September 2001 |work= |publisher=[[Asia Society]] |accessdate=2011-11-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090414015049/http://www.asiasociety.org/speeches/soros.html |archivedate=14 April 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bank transaction tax===

{{main|Bank transaction tax}}

Between 1982 and 2002 Australia charged a [[bank account debits tax]] on customer withdrawals from bank accounts with a [[cheque]] facility. Some Latin American countries also experimented with taxes levied on bank transactions. Argentina introduced a bank transaction tax in 1984 before it was abolished in 1992. Brazil implemented its temporary "CPMF" in 1993, which lasted until 2007. The broad based tax levied on all debit (and/or credit) entries on bank accounts proved to be evasion-proof, more efficient and less costly than orthodox tax models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/pra/mprapa/16710.html |title=Bank transactions: pathway to the single tax ideal.

''It often applies to deposits and withdrawals from bank accounts, often including checking accounts.''

===Automated payment transaction tax===
{{main|Automated payment transaction tax}}

In 1989, Edgar L. Feige proposed a synthesis and extension of the ideas of Keynes and Tobin by proposing a flat rate tax on all transactions.&lt;ref name=Akst/&gt; The total volume of all transactions undertaken in an economy represents the broadest possible tax base and therefore requires the lowest flat tax rate to raise any requisite amount of revenue. Since financial transactions in stocks, bonds, international currency transactions and derivatives comprise most of the automated payment transaction (APT) tax base, it is in essence the broadest of financial transaction taxes. Initially proposed as a revenue neutral replacement for the entire Federal tax system of the United States,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/wpa/wuwppe/0106001.html|title=Taxation for the 21st Century: The Automated Payment Transaction (APT) Tax|date=2 February 2001|work=repec.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; it could alternatively be considered as a global tax whose revenues could be used by national governments to reduce existing income, corporate and VAT tax rates as well as reducing existing sovereign debt burdens. If adopted by all of the developed nations, it would have the advantage of eliminating all incentives for substitution between financial assets and between financial centers since all transactions would universally be taxed at the identical flat tax rate.

The foundations of the APT tax proposal—a small, uniform tax on all economic transactions—involve simplification, base broadening, reductions in marginal tax rates, the elimination of tax and information returns and the automatic collection of tax revenues at the payment source.

==Implemented financial transaction taxes==

In 2011 there were 40 countries that had FTT in operation, raising $38 billion (€29bn).&lt;ref name="European voice"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.europeanvoice.com/article/2012/march/why-critics-are-wrong-about-a-financial-transaction-tax/73843.aspx |title=Why critics are wrong about a financial-transaction tax |author1=Stephany Griffith-Jones |author2=Avinash Persaud |date=12 March 2012 |work= |publisher=European Voice |accessdate=2012-03-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Belgium===

The Belgium securities tax applies to certain transactions concluded or executed in Belgium through a professional intermediary, to the extent that they relate to public funds, irrespective of their (Belgian or foreign) origin. The "tax on stock exchange transactions" is not due upon subscription of new securities (primary market transactions). Both buyers and sellers are subject to the tax. The tax rate varies in accordance with the type of transactions. A 0.09% tax (subject to a maximum of €1.300 per transaction) is charged for distributing shares of investment companies, certificates of contractual investment funds, bonds of the Belgian public debt or the public debt of foreign states, nominative or bearer bonds, certificates of bonds, etc. A 1.32% tax (subject to a maximum of €4.000 per transaction) is charged for accumulating shares of investment companies and 0.27% (subject to a maximum of €1.600 per transaction) for any other securities (such as shares). Transactions made for its own account by non-resident taxpayers and by some financial institutions, such as banks, insurance companies, organizations for financing pensions (OFPs) or collective investment are exempted from the tax.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt;

===Colombia===

In 1998 Colombia introduced a [[Taxation in Colombia#Financial transactions tax|financial transaction tax of 0.2%]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.banrep.gov.co/documentos/presentaciones-discursos/pdf/aso4eng.pdf |title=Towards Multibanking in Colombia: from 'Patchwork' to Financial Holdings |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; covering all financial transactions including [[banknotes]], [[promissory notes]], processing of payments by way of telegraphic transfer, [[EFTPOS]], internet banking or other means, [[cheque|bank drafts]] and [[cheque|bank cheques]], money on [[term deposit]], [[overdraft]]s, installment loans, documentary and standby [[letters of credit]], guarantees, [[performance bond]]s, securities underwriting commitments and other forms of off balance sheet exposures, safekeeping of documents and other items in [[safe deposit box]]es, currency exchange, sale, distribution or brokerage, with or without advice, unit trusts and similar financial products. Currently the rate is 0.4%

===Finland===

Finland imposes a tax of 1.6% on the transfer of certain Finnish securities, mainly equities such as bonds, debt securities and derivatives. The tax is charged if the transferee and/or transferor is a Finnish resident or a Finnish branch of certain financial institutions. However, there are several exceptions. E.g. no transfer tax is payable if the equities in question are subject to trading on a qualifying market.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt; Prime Minister [[Jyrki Katainen]] (National Coalition Party) decided that Finland will not join a group of eleven other European Union states that have signed up to be at the forefront of preparing a financial transaction tax in November 2012. Other government parties the [[Green League]], the [[Social Democratic Party of Finland]] and the [[Left Alliance (Finland)|Left Alliance]] had supporters of the tax.&lt;ref&gt;[http://yle.fi/uutiset/finland_steers_clear_of_financial_transaction_tax/6398239 Finland steers clear of financial transaction tax] yle 30 November 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Supporters of the tax are Austria, Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Slovakia, Slovenia and Spain and likely Estonia. For example, British banks opposed the tax. Supporters said: "We are delighted that the European FTT is moving from rhetoric to reality and will ensure banks pay for the damage they have caused; This shows it is possible to put the needs of the public over the profits of a privileged few. It's unforgivable in this age of austerity that the UK government is turning down billions in additional revenue to protect the City's elite."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/business/2012/oct/23/european-financial-transaction-tax-closer|title=European financial transaction tax moves step closer|author=Larry Elliott|work=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===France===

On 1 August 2012, France introduced a financial transaction tax in French tax regulation pursuant to Article 5 of the French Amended Finance Bill of 14 March 2012. Two other taxes applicable to financial transactions were also introduced, including a tax on [[high-frequency trading]], (Article 235 ter ZD bis of the FTC); and a tax on naked sovereign credit default swaps (Article 235 ter ZD ter of the FTC). The FTT levies a 0.2% tax on stock purchases of French publicly traded companies with a market value over €1 billion. The scheme does not include debt securities, except convertible and exchangeable bonds, which are included but benefit from a dedicated exemption to the FTT.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cms-bfl.com/The-French-tax-on-financial-transactions-the-FTT-19-06-2012 |title=The French financial transaction tax |author1=Christophe Aldebert |author2=Corinne Reinbold |author3=Marc-Etienne Sébire |author4=Jérôme Sutour |date=21 June 2012 |work= |publisher=CMS Bureau Francis Lefebvre |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to French president [[Francois Hollande]] the tax will generate €170 million in additional revenue for 2012 and another €500 million in 2013.&lt;ref name="French-FTT"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://euobserver.com/tickers/117134 |title=France launches financial transaction tax |date=2 August 2012 |work= |publisher=EUobserver.com |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; France is the first European country to impose a transaction tax on share purchases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2012-07-31/french-lawmakers-pass-budget-bill-including-transaction-tax |title=French Lawmakers Pass Trading Transaction Tax |author1=Helene Fouquet |author2=Adria Cimino |date=1 August 2012 |work= |publisher=Bloomberg Businessweek |accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; From 2 January 2017 settlement date the rate increased to 0.3%.&lt;ref name="THE FINANCIAL TRANSACTION TAX: A REALLY GOOD IDEA"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.amf-france.org/magnoliaPublic/dam/jcr:d9fe690a-fc86-4dc8-827c-28ead3c9617b/201710_Etude_TTF_VA.pdf | title=THE FINANCIAL TRANSACTION TAX: A REALLY GOOD IDEA |author1=Panthéon-Sorbonne |author2=Labex ReFi | date=September 2017 | work= | publisher=Scientific Advisory Board of the AMF | accessdate=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Listed shares acquired as of 1 January 2013 will no longer be subject to the sales tax; rather, any capital gains received will be added to the taxpayer's total income.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt;

===India===

Since 1 October 2004, India levies financial transaction taxes of up to 0.135% payable on the value of taxable securities transaction made through a recognized national stock exchange. The securities transaction tax (STT) is not applicable on off-market transactions. The tax rate is set at 0.125% on a delivery-based buy and sell, 0.025% on non-delivery-based transactions, and 0.017% on [[Options (finance)|Futures and Options]] transactions. The tax has been criticized by the Indian financial sector and is currently under review.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daytradingshares.com/security_transaction_tax_STT.html|title=What is Security Transcation Tax - STT ? security transaction tax calculation|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===

Since 1 March 2013, Italy levies financial transaction tax on qualified equity transactions of up to 0.2% (0.22% in 2013) of the value of the trade.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.agenziaentrate.gov.it/wps/content/nsilib/nsi/home/cosadevifare/versare/imposta+sulle+transazioni+finanziarie/schedainfo+imposta+transazioni+finanziarie |title=Imposta sulle transazioni finanziarie - Scheda normativa |author= Agenzia delle Entrate |language=it |accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.camera.it/Camera/browse/561?appro=496&amp;Imposta+sulle+transazioni+finanziarie+(Tobin+tax) |title=Temi dell'attività Parlamentare - Imposta sulle transazioni finanziarie (Tobin tax) |author=Camera dei Deputati |language=it |accessdate=2015-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Financial transaction tax on derivatives of qualified equity transactions went into effect on 1 September 2013. The regulation is to apply the tax on the net balance of purchase and sale transactions executed same day on the same financial instrument by the same person/entity.

It is applicable to:
* Shares issued by Italian resident companies with a capitalization equal or higher than 500 million euros; 
* Cash equity contracts; 
* Equity Derivatives contracts;
* Instruments incorporating or representing the shares (ADR, GDR) regardless the residency of the issuer;
* High Frequency Trading on cash equities and equity derivatives transactions. The liable party is the investor (net buyer) for cash equities and both parties of the derivatives contract.

===Japan===

Until 1999, Japan imposed a transaction tax on a variety of financial instruments, including debt instruments and equity instruments, but at differential rates. The tax rates were higher on equities than on debentures and bonds. In the late 1980s, the Japanese government was generating significant revenues of about $12 billion per year. The tax was eventually withdrawn as part of "big bang" liberalization of the financial sector in 1999.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

===Peru===

In 2003 the Peruvian government introduced a 0.1% general financial transaction tax on all foreign currency denominated incoming wire transfers regardless of their country of origin, with the aim of raising finance for the education sector. The tax is to be assessed automatically but collected manually.&lt;ref name="Spratt"/&gt;

===Poland===

Poland charges a 1% Civil Law Activities Tax (CLAT) on the sale or exchange of property rights, which includes securities and derivatives. The tax applies to transactions, which are performed in Poland or which grant property rights that are to be exercised in Poland. It also applies to transactions executed outside Poland if the buyer is established in Poland. All transactions on a stock market, Polish treasury bonds and Polish treasury bills, bills issued by the National Bank and some other specified securities are exempted from the tax.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt;

===Singapore===

Singapore charges a 0.2% stamp duty on all instruments that give effect to transactions in stocks and shares.&lt;ref name="SingaporeIRAS"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iras.gov.sg/irashome/Other-Taxes/Stamp-Duty-for-Shares/Learning-the-basics/Stamp-Duty-Basics-for-Shares/ |title=Stamp Duty Basics for Shares |author=Inland Revenue Authority of Singapore|accessdate=2016-02-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this duty only applies to actual physical documents, and is not levied on computerized transactions performed through securities accounts. Stamp duty is not levied on [[derivative (finance)|derivative]] instruments.

===Sweden===

{{Main|Swedish financial transaction tax}}
In January 1984, Sweden introduced a 0.5% tax on the purchase or sale of an [[Security (finance)#Equity|equity security]]. Hence a round trip (purchase and sale) transaction resulted in a 1% tax. In July 1986, the rate was doubled, and in January 1989, a considerably lower tax of 0.002% on fixed-income securities was introduced for a security with a maturity of 90 days or less. On a bond with a maturity of five years or more, the tax was 0.003%. Analyst Marion G. Wrobel prepared a paper for the Canadian Government in June 1996, examining the international experience with financial transaction taxes, and paying particular attention to the Swedish experience.&lt;ref name="FTT"&gt;Financial Transaction Taxes: The International Experience and the Lessons for Canada. http://dsp-psd.tpsgc.gc.ca/Collection-R/LoPBdP/BP/bp419-e.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The revenues from taxes were disappointing; for example, revenues from the tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year. They did not amount to more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year and the average was closer to 50 million.&lt;ref&gt;Campbell, John Y. and Froot, Kenneth A. "International Experiences with Securities Transaction Taxes (December 1993)", NBER Working Paper No. W4587. http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=338864&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, as taxable trading volumes fell, so did revenues from capital gains taxes, entirely offsetting revenues from the equity transactions tax that had grown to 4,000 million Swedish kronor by 1988.&lt;ref name="SRU1"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Umlauf Steven R | year = 1993 | title = Transaction Taxes and the Behavior of the Swedish Stock Market | url = https://ideas.repec.org/a/eee/jfinec/v33y1993i2p227-240.html | journal = Journal of Financial Economics | volume = 33 | issue = | pages = 227–240 | doi=10.1016/0304-405x(93)90005-v}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the day that the tax was announced, share prices fell by 2.2%. But there was leakage of information prior to the announcement, which might explain the 5.35% price decline in the 30 days prior to the announcement. When the tax was doubled, prices again fell by another 1%. These declines were in line with the capitalized value of future tax payments resulting from expected trades. It was further felt that the taxes on fixed-income securities only served to increase the cost of government borrowing, providing another argument against the tax.

Even though the tax on fixed-income securities was much lower than that on equities, the impact on market trading was much more dramatic. During the first week of the tax, the volume of bond trading fell by 85%, even though the tax rate on five-year bonds was only 0.003%. The volume of futures trading fell by 98% and the options trading market disappeared. On 15 April 1990, the tax on fixed-income securities was abolished. In January 1991 the rates on the remaining taxes were cut in half and by the end of the year they were abolished completely. Once the taxes were eliminated, trading volumes returned and grew substantially in the 1990s.&lt;ref name="FTT"/&gt;

The Swedish FTT is widely considered a failure by design since traders could easily avoid the tax by using foreign broker services.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.parlament.gv.at/cgi-bin/eukp.pdf?P_EU=XXIV.pdf/EU/05/98/059894.pdf |title=Commission Staff Working Paper: Impact Assessment – Proposal for a Council Directive on a common system of financial transaction tax and amending Directive 2008/7/EC |pages=4–6 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120112213622/http://www.parlament.gv.at/cgi-bin/eukp.pdf?P_EU=XXIV.pdf%2FEU%2F05%2F98%2F059894.pdf |archivedate=12 January 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Switzerland===

In Switzerland a [[transfer tax]] (Umsatzabgabe) is levied on the transfer of domestic or foreign securities such as bonds and shares, where one of the parties or intermediaries is a Swiss security broker. Other securities such as options futures, etc. do not qualify as taxable securities. Swiss brokers include banks and bank-linked financial institutions. The duty is levied at a rate of 0.15% for domestic securities and 0.3% for foreign securities. However, there are numerous exemptions to the Swiss transfer tax. These are among others: Eurobonds, other bonds denominated in a foreign currency and the trading stock of professional security brokers. The revenue of the Swiss transfer tax was CHF 1.9 billion in 2007 or 0.37% of GDP.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt;

===Taiwan===

In Taiwan the securities transaction tax (STT) is imposed upon gross sales price of securities transferred and at a rate of 0.3% for share certificates issued by companies and 0.1% for corporate bonds or any securities offered to the public which have been duly approved by the government.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt; However, trading of corporate bonds and financial bonds issued by Taiwanese issuers or companies are temporarily exempt from STT beginning 1 January 2010. The Taiwanese government argued this "would enliven the bond market and enhance the international competitiveness of Taiwan's enterprises."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ey.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=65822&amp;ctNode=1334&amp;mp=11 Seven-year Transaction Tax Exemption for Corporate and Financial Bonds], 12 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998, Taiwan also levies a stock index futures transaction tax imposed on both parties. The current transaction tax is levied per transaction at a rate of not less than 0.01% and not more than 0.06%, based on the value of the futures contract. Revenue from the securities transaction tax and the futures transaction tax was about €2.4 billion in 2009. The major part of this revenue came from the taxation of bonds and stocks (96.5%). The taxation of stock index future shares was 3.5%. In total, this corresponds to 0.8% in terms of GDP.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt;

===United Kingdom===

{{Main|Stamp duty in the United Kingdom}}
;Stamp Duty
A stamp duty was introduced in the United Kingdom as an [[ad valorem]] tax on share purchases in 1808.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Stamp Taxes Manual|publisher=HM Revenue and Customs|url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/so/manual.pdf|accessdate=2011-11-06}} paras 1.34 to 1.40&lt;/ref&gt; Stamp duties are collected on documents used to effect the sale and transfer of [[Stock certificate|certificated stock]] and other securities of UK based companies.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt; It can be avoided using [[Contract for difference|CFDs]].

;Stamp Duty Reserve Tax
To address the development of trades in uncertificated stock, the UK [[Finance Act 1986]] introduced the [[Stamp duty in the United Kingdom|Stamp Duty Reserve Tax]] (SDRT) at a rate of 0.5% on share purchases,&lt;ref name="HMRC Stamp Taxes Manual"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/so/manual.pdf |title=HMRC Stamp Taxes Manual |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; raising around €3.8bn per year, of which 40% is paid by foreign residents.&lt;ref name="European voice"/&gt; The tax is charged whether the transaction takes place in the UK or overseas, and whether either party is resident of the UK or not. Securities issued by companies overseas are not taxed. This means that—just like the standard stamp duty—the tax is paid by foreign and UK-based investors who invest in UK incorporated companies. In other words, the tax applies to all companies which are headquartered in the UK,&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt; albeit there is a relief for intermediaries (such as [[Market maker#London|market makers]] and large banks that are members of a qualifying exchange) as a condition of their obligation to provide [[Market liquidity|liquidity]].&lt;ref name="GOVUK1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hmrc.gov.uk/so/manual.pdf |title=Stamp Taxes Manual|publisher=HM Revenue and Customs |pages=8, 11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both stamp duty and SDRT remain in place today, albeit with continued relief for intermediaries, so that over 70% of transactions are exempt from tax.&lt;ref name="Spratt"/&gt; SDRT accounts for the majority of revenue collected on share transactions effected through the UK's Exchanges. On average almost 90% of revenues stem from the SDRT. Only a minor part comes from Stamp Duty.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt; Revenue is pro-cyclical with economic activity. In terms of GDP and total tax revenue the highest values were reached during the [[dot.com boom]] years around the end of the 20th century, notably in 2000–01. In 2007–08, SDRT generated €5.37 billion in revenue (compared to 0.72 billion of the standard stamp duty). This accounts for 0.82% over total UK tax revenue or 0.30% of GDP. In 2008–09 the figure dropped to €3.67 billion (0.22% of GDP), due to reduced share prices and trading volumes as a result of the financial crisis.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt;

===United States===

The US imposed a financial transaction tax from 1914 to 1966 that was originally 0.2% and was doubled during the [[Great Depression]].&lt;ref&gt;Dealbook.  New York Times. 16 October 2009 http://dealbook.nytimes.com/2009/10/16/transaction-tax-is-floated-on-capitol-hill/?_r=0 Transaction Tax Is Floated on Capitol Hill]&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, the US imposes a $0.0042 round-trip transaction tax on security futures transactions and $21.80 per million dollars for securities transactions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sec.gov/answers/sec31.htm|title=SEC.gov -  Section 31 Transaction Fees|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The tax, known as Section 31 fee, is used to support the operation costs of the [[Securities and Exchange Commission]] (SEC).

===Global Tobin tax===

In 2000 a "pro–Tobin tax" NGO proposed that a tax could be used to fund international development: "In the face of increasing income disparity and social inequity, the Tobin Tax represents a rare opportunity to capture the enormous wealth of an untaxed sector and redirect it towards the public good. Conservative estimates show the tax could yield from $150–300 billion annually."&lt;ref name=newint&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newint.org/issue320/tobin.htm|title= Time for Tobin!|author= Robin Round|date= January–February 2000|work= |publisher= [[New Internationalist]]|accessdate= 2009-12-17|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091206100227/http://www.newint.org/issue320/tobin.htm|archivedate= 6 December 2009|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dr. Stephen Spratt, "the revenues raised could be used for ... international development objectives ... such as meeting the Millennium Development Goals."&lt;ref name="Spratt"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stampoutpoverty.org/?lid=9889 |title=A Sterling Solution |author= Stephen Spratt of Intelligence Capital |date=September 2006 |work=Stamp Out Poverty report|publisher=Stamp Out Poverty Campaign |pages=19|accessdate=2010-01-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;There are eight [[international development]] goals that 192 [[United Nations member states]] and at least 23 [[international organizations]] have agreed (in 2000) to achieve by the year 2015. They include reducing [[extreme poverty]], reducing [[child mortality]] rates, fighting disease epidemics such as AIDS, and developing a global partnership for development.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml Background page], United Nations Millennium Development Goals website, retrieved 16 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the UN [[World Conference against Racism 2001]], when the issue of compensation for colonialism and slavery arose in the agenda, President [[Fidel Castro]] of Cuba advocated the Tobin Tax to address that issue. According to Cliff Kincaid, Castro advocated it "specifically in order to generate U.S. financial reparations to the rest of the world", however a closer reading of Castro's speech shows that he never did mention "the rest of the world" as being recipients of revenue. Castro cited [[holocaust reparations]] as a previously established precedent for the concept of [[Reparation (legal)|reparation]]s.&lt;ref name="key"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.un.org/WCAR/statements/0109cubaE.htm |title= Key address by Dr. Fidel Castro Ruz, President of the Republic of Cuba at the World Conference against racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance|author= [[Fidel Castro]]|date=1 September 2001 |work= |publisher=United Nations |accessdate=29 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Kincaid"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aim.org/aim-column/progressives-back-obama-push-for-global-tax/ |title=Progressives Back Obama Push for Global Tax |author=Cliff Kincaid |date=6 October 2009 |work= |publisher= Accuracy in Media|accessdate=2010-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castro also suggested that the United Nations be the administrator of this tax, stating the following:&lt;blockquote&gt;May the tax suggested by Nobel Prize Laureate James Tobin be imposed in a reasonable and effective way on the current speculative operations accounting for trillions of US dollars every 24 hours, then the United Nations, which cannot go on depending on meager, inadequate, and belated donations and charities, will have one trillion US dollars annually to save and develop the world. Given the seriousness and urgency of the existing problems, which have become a real hazard for the very survival of our species on the planet, that is what would actually be needed before it is too late.&lt;ref name="key"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Member countries have not given the UN a mandate to seek a global financial tax.

===Robin hood tax===
{{main|Robin Hood tax}}
On 15 February 2010 a [[coalition]] of 50 charities and [[civil society organisation]]s launched a campaign for a Robin Hood tax on global financial transactions. The proposal would affect a wide range of asset classes including the purchase and sale of stocks, bonds, commodities, unit trusts, mutual funds, and derivatives such as futures and options.&lt;ref name = "Kylie"&gt;{{cite news|url= http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE61900U20100210|title= "Robin Hood" tax campaign launched|publisher= [[Reuters]]|author1=Kylie MacLellan |author2=Ron Askew |date=10 February 2010 |accessdate=2010-03-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States financial transaction tax===

Different US financial transaction tax (US FTT) bills have been proposed in [[United States Congress|Congress]] since 2009. The main differences between the proposals has been the size of the tax, which financial transactions are taxed and how the new tax revenue is spent. The bills have proposed a .025%–.5% tax on stocks, .025%–.1% tax on bonds and .005%–.02% on derivatives with the funds going to health, public services, debt reduction, infrastructure and job creation. The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] has introduced since 2009 ten different US FTT related bills and the [[United States Senate|Senate]] has introduced four. The bills in the Senate have been variously sponsored by [[Tom Harkin]] (D-Iowa) or [[Bernie Sanders]] (I-Vermont). The bills in the House have been variously sponsored by [[Peter DeFazio]] (D-Oregon), [[John Conyers]] (D-Michigan) or a number of other Representatives.&lt;ref&gt;House of Representative bills: [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-4191 Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Act], [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=s111-2927 S. 2927:Wall Street Fair Share Act], [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h111-5204 H.R. 5204:21st Century Full Employment and Training Act], [http://thehill.com/blogs/congress-blog/economy-a-budget/109869-currency-tax-a-way-to-invest-in-our-future-rep-stark "Currency tax: A way to invest in our future (Rep.

The US FTT bills proposed by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon) and Sen. Harkin (D-Iowa) have received a number of cosponsors in the Senate and House. The [[Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill]] is an early version of their cosponsored US FTT bill which includes a tax on US [[financial market]] securities transactions.&lt;ref name=Page/&gt; The bill suggests to tax [[stock]] transactions at a rate of 0.25%.

===European Union financial transaction tax===
{{main|European Union financial transaction tax}}

The EU financial transaction tax (EU FTT) is a proposal made by the [[European Commission]] in September 2011 to introduce a financial transaction tax within the 27 member states of the [[European Union]] by 2014. The tax would only impact [[financial transactions]] between [[financial institutions]] charging 0.1% against the exchange of [[Share (finance)|shares]] and [[Bond (finance)|bonds]] and 0.01% across [[derivative contract]]s. According to the European Commission it could raise €57 billion every year,&lt;ref name="impact-summary"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.euinside.eu/en/news/the-eu-expects-57-billion-euros-a-year-by-a-new-bank-tax |title=The EU Expects 57 Billion Euros a Year from a New Financial Tax|author= Ralitsa Kovacheva |date= 30 September 2011|work= |publisher= EU inside |accessdate=26 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; of which around €10bn (£8.4bn) would go to Great Britain, which hosts Europe's biggest financial center.&lt;ref name=Semeta&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/finance/newsbysector/banksandfinance/9087264/Financial-transaction-tax-would-raise-10bn.html |title=Financial transaction tax would raise €10bn |author= Harry Wilson |date= 16 February 2012 |work= |publisher= Telegraph |accessdate=3 March 2012 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear whether a financial transaction tax is compatible with European law.&lt;ref&gt;Dietlein, Georg (2012): National Approaches towards a Financial Transaction Tax and Their Compatibility with European Law, EC Tax Review, Vol. 21 Issue 4, S. 207–211&lt;/ref&gt;

If implemented the tax must be paid in the European country where the financial operator is established. This "R plus I" (residence plus issuance) solution means the EU-FTT would cover all transactions that involve a single European firm, no matter if these transactions are carried out in the EU or elsewhere in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.fes.de/pdf-files/id/ipa/09063.pdf Sieling, Carsten (2012): Financial Transaction Tax.

According to John Dizard of the [[Financial Times]], the unilateral extension of extraterritorial power can only cause problems:- &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/817af53a-9b7c-11e2-8485-00144feabdc0.html#axzz2QVOnu48z|title=Trouble brews over EU transactions tax|date=12 April 2013|accessdate=2013-04-15|publisher=The Financial Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;blockquote&gt; From a US perspective, this unilateral extension of extraterritorial power by the commission goes beyond anything attempted since the US and Great Britain concluded the Treaty of Paris ending the Revolutionary War in 1783. Most institutions that try to do something like that have their own navy, and usually a larger one than the sovereign territory where they are attempting to impose the tax.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Being faced with stiff resistance from some non-eurozone EU countries, particularly United Kingdom and Sweden, a group of eleven states began pursuing the idea of utilizing [[enhanced co-operation]] to implement the tax in states which wish to participate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.europolitics.info/economy-monetary-affairs/lowering-contributions-possible-even-under-enhanced-cooperation-art342321-30.html|title=Lowering contributions possible even under enhanced cooperation|last=Sebag|first=Gaspard|date=31 August 2012|accessdate=2012-09-20|publisher=[[Europolitics]]|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130512094546/http://www.europolitics.info/economy-monetary-affairs/lowering-contributions-possible-even-under-enhanced-cooperation-art342321-30.html|archivedate=12 May 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international-business/11-eurozone-states-ready-to-launch-financial-transactions-tax-eu-tax-commissioner/articleshow/16738834.cms |title=11 eurozone states ready to launch financial transactions tax: EU tax commissioner |date=9 October 2012 |accessdate=2012-10-09 |publisher=The Economic Times }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Opinion polls indicate that two-thirds of British people are in favour of some forms of FTT (see section: [[Financial transaction tax#Public opinion|Public opinion]]).

==Evaluation==

===Effect on volatility===
Proponents of the tax assert that it will reduce price [[Volatility (finance)|volatility]]. In a 1984 paper, Lawrence Summers and Victoria Summers argued, "Such a tax would have the beneficial effects of curbing instability introduced by speculation, reducing the diversion of resources into the financial sector of the economy, and lengthening the horizons of corporate managers."&lt;ref name = "Summers"&gt;{{cite journal | author = Summers L. H., Summers V. P. | year = 1989 | title = When financial markets work too well: a cautious case for a securities transactions tax | url = | journal = Journal of Financial Services Research | volume = 3 | issue = | pages = 163–188 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is further believed that FTTs "should reduce volatility by reducing the number of noise traders".&lt;ref name="IDS"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ids.ac.uk/files/dmfile/IF14.2web.pdf |title=Is a Financial Transaction Tax a Good Idea? A Review of the Evidence|author=Neil McCulloch |date=October 2010 |work=| publisher =Institute of Development Studies| page=2|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However most empirical studies find that the relationship between FTT and short-term price volatility is ambiguous and that "higher transaction costs are associated with more, rather than less, volatility".&lt;ref name="IDS"/&gt;

A 2003 IMF Staff Paper by Karl Habermeier and Andrei Kirilenko found that FTTs are "positively related to increased volatility and lower volume".&lt;ref name="Habermeier"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2001/wp0151.pdf |title= Securities Transaction Taxes and Financial Markets|author1=Karl Habermeier |author2=Andrei Kirilenko |date=May 2001 |work= |publisher=Monetary and Exchange Affairs Department, IMF| page=178|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the Shanghai and Shenzhen stock exchanges says the FTT created significant increases in volatility because it "would influence not only noise traders, but also those informed traders who play the role of decreasing volatility in the stock market."&lt;ref name="Zhang"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ecu.edu/cs-educ/econ/upload/zhangli.pdf |title=The Impact of Transaction Tax on Stock Markets: Evidence from an Emerging Market|author=Li Zhang |year=2001 |work= |publisher =Department of Economics, East Carolina University| pages=20, 2|accessdate=2 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A French study of 6,774 daily realized volatility measurements for 4.7 million trades in a four-year period of index stocks trading in the [[Paris Bourse]] from 1995 to 1999 reached the same conclusion "that higher transaction costs increase stock return volatility". The French study concluded that these volatility measures "are likely to underestimate the destabilizing role of security transactions since they – unlike large ticks – also reduce the stabilizing liquidity supply".&lt;ref name="Hau"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.inquire-europe.org/project/finished%20projects/hau.pdf |title=The Role of Transaction Costs for Financial Volatility: Evidence from the Paris Bourse|author=Harold Hau |date=14 October 2002 |work=| publisher=INSEAD and CEPR| pages=2, 20|accessdate=12 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1997 study of the UK Stamp Duty, which exempts market makers and large banks that are members of a qualifying exchange, found no significant effect on the volatility of UK equity prices.&lt;ref name="IDS"/&gt;

===Effect on liquidity===
In 2011 the IMF published a study paper, which argues that a securities transaction tax (STT) "reduces trading volume, it may decrease liquidity or, equivalently, may increase the price impact of trades, which will tend to heighten price volatility".&lt;ref name="Matheson"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/wp/2011/wp1154.pdf |title=Taxing Financial Transactions: Issues and Evidence|author=Thornton Matheson |date=March 2011 |work= |publisher=Fiscal Affairs Department, IMF| page=20|accessdate=10 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study by the think tank Oxera found that the imposition of the UK's Stamp Duty would "likely have a negative effect on liquidity in secondary markets". Regarding proposals to abolish the UK's Stamp Duty, Oxera concluded that the abolition would "be likely to result in a non-negligible increase in liquidity, further reducing the cost of capital of UK listed companies".&lt;ref name="Oxera"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.oxera.com/cmsDocuments/Agenda_June%2007/Stamp%20duty%20on%20share%20trading.pdf |title=Stamp duty on share trading: what is the effect on UK listed companies?|author=Derek Holt, editor |date=June 2007 |work= |publisher =Oxera| pages=2, 3|accessdate=1 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; A study of the FTT in Chinese stock markets found liquidity reductions due to decreased transactions.&lt;ref name=Zhang /&gt;{{rp|6}}

===Effect on price discovery===
An IMF Working Paper found a FTT impacts [[price discovery]]. The natural effect of the FTT's reduction of trading volume is to reduce liquidity, which "can in turn slow price discovery, the process by which [[financial market]]s incorporate the effect of new information into asset prices". The FTT would cause information to be incorporated more slowly into trades, creating "a greater autocorrelation of returns". This pattern could impede the ability of the market to prevent asset bubbles. The deterrence of transactions could "slow the upswing of the asset cycle", but it could also "slow a correction of prices toward their fundamental values".&lt;ref name=Matheson /&gt; {{rp|16,18,21}}

Habermeier and Kirilenko conclude that "The presence of even very small transaction costs makes continuous rebalancing infinitely expensive. Therefore, valuable information can be held back from being incorporated into prices. As a result, prices can deviate from their full information values."&lt;ref name=Habermeier /&gt;{{rp|174}} A Chinese study agrees, saying: "When it happens that an asset's price is currently misleading and is inconsistent with its intrinsic value, it would take longer to correct for the discrepancy because of the lack of enough transactions. In these cases, the capital market becomes less efficient."&lt;ref name=Zhang /&gt;{{rp|6}}

Revenues vary according to tax rate, transactions covered, and tax effects on transactions. The Swedish experience with transaction taxes in 1984–91 demonstrates that the net effect on tax revenues can be difficult to estimate and can even be negative due to reduced trading volumes. Revenues from the transaction tax on fixed-income securities were initially expected to amount to 1,500 million Swedish kronor per year but actually amounted to no more than 80 million Swedish kronor in any year. Reduced trading volumes also caused a reduction in capital gains tax revenue which entirely offset the transaction tax revenues.&lt;ref name="SRU1"/&gt;

An examination of the scale and nature of the various payments and derivatives transactions and the likely elasticity of response led [https://ideas.repec.org/p/wbk/wbrwps/5230.html Honohan and Yoder (2010)] to conclude that attempts to raise a significant percentage of gross domestic product in revenue from a broad-based financial transactions tax are likely to fail both by raising much less revenue than expected and by generating far-reaching changes in economic behavior. They point out that, although the side effects would include a sizable restructuring of financial sector activity, this would not occur in ways corrective of the particular forms of financial overtrading that were most conspicuous in contributing to the ongoing financial crisis. Accordingly, such taxes likely deliver both less revenue and less efficiency benefits than have sometimes been claimed by some. On the other hand, they observe that such taxes may be less damaging than feared by others.

On the other hand, the case of UK stamp duty reserve tax shows that provided exemptions are given to market makers and banks, that FTT can generate modest revenues, at the expense of pensioners and savers. Despite the low tax rate of 0.5% on the purchase of shares, the UK managed to generate between €3.7 and €7.4 billion in [[Stamp duty in the United Kingdom#Revenues from stamp duties|revenues from stamp duties]] per year throughout the last decade.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt; Also the cases of Japan, Taiwan and Switzerland suggest that countries may generate sizable amounts of income by introducing FTT on a national scale. If implemented on an international scale, revenues may be even considerably higher, since it would make it more difficult for traders to avoid the tax by moving to other locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/taxation_customs/taxation/other_taxes/financial_sector/index_en.htm|title=Taxation of the financial sector|author=[[European Commission]]|date=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*''European Union'': The European Commission expects its proposed EU financial transaction tax of 0.1% on bond and equity transactions, and 0.01% on derivative transactions between financial firms to raise up to €55 billion per year.&lt;ref name="fxstreet"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.fxstreet.com/news/forex-news/article.aspx?storyid=97a29b8a-6ff2-4edb-9bd6-b41225d67e7a |title=Barroso calls for financial transactions tax |date=28 September 2011 |work= |publisher=FX Street |accessdate=2011-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wallstreetpit"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://wallstreetpit.com/84790-eu-financial-transaction-tax-is-feasible-and-if-set-right-desirable|title=EU's Financial Transaction Tax is Feasible, and If Set Right, Desirable |author= Avinash Persaud |date= 3 October 2011|work= |publisher= Wall Street Pit |accessdate=22 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effect on share prices===
According to a European Commission working paper, empirical studies show that the UK stamp duty influences the share prices negatively. More frequently traded shares are stronger affected than low-turnover shares. Therefore, the tax revenue capitalizes at least to some extent in lower current share prices. For firms which rely on equity as marginal source of finance this may increase capital costs since the issue price of new shares would be lower than without the tax.&lt;ref name="FTT-impact"/&gt;

Kenneth Rogoff, Professor of Economics and Public Policy at Harvard University, and formerly Chief Economist at the IMF, argues that "Higher transactions taxes increase the cost of capital, ultimately lowering investment. With a lower capital stock, output would trend downward, reducing government revenues and substantially offsetting the direct gain from the tax. In the long run, wages would fall, and ordinary workers would end up bearing a significant share of the cost. More broadly, FTTs violate the general public-finance principle that it is inefficient to tax intermediate factors of production, particularly ones that are highly mobile and fluid in their response."&lt;ref name="reuters"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://blogs.reuters.com/great-debate/2011/10/03/the-wrong-tax-for-europe/ |title=The wrong tax for Europe |author=Kenneth Rogoff |date=3 October 2011 |work= |publisher= [[Reuters]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Progressive or regressive tax===
An IMF Working Paper finds that the FTT "disproportionately burdens" the financial sector and will also impact pension funds, public corporations, international commerce firms, and the public sector, with "multiple layers of tax" creating a "cascading effect". "[E]ven an apparently low-rate [FTT] might result in a high tax burden on some activities." These costs could also be passed on to clients, including not only wealthy individuals and corporations, but charities and pension and mutual funds.&lt;ref name=Matheson /&gt;{{rp|25,37}}

Other studies have suggested that the financial transaction tax is regressive in application—particularly the Stamp Duty in the UK, which includes certain exemptions only available to institutional investors. One UK study, by the Institute for Development Studies, suggests, "In the long run, a significant proportion of the tax could end up being passed on to consumers."&lt;ref name=IDS /&gt;{{rp|3}} Another study of the UK Stamp Duty found that institutional investors avoid the tax due to intermediary relief, while short-term investors who are willing to take on additional risk can avoid the tax by trading noncovered derivatives. The study concluded, therefore, "The tax is thus likely to fall most heavily on long-term, risk-averse investors."&lt;ref name=Matheson /&gt;{{rp|36}}

===Technical feasibility===
Although James Tobin had said his own Tobin tax idea was unfeasible in practice, a study on its feasibility commissioned by the German government 2002 concluded that the tax was feasible even at a limited scale within the European time zone without significant tax evasion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiwi.uni-frankfurt.de/professoren/spahn/tobintax/|title=Leitseite|work=uni-frankfurt.de}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Joseph Stiglitz]], former Senior Vice President and [[World Bank Chief Economist|Chief Economist]] of the [[World Bank]], said, on 5 October 2009, that modern technology meant that was no longer the case. Stiglitz said, the tax is "much more feasible today" than a few decades ago, when Tobin recanted.&lt;ref name="Edmund Conway"/&gt; However, on 7 November 2009, at the [[G20]] finance ministers summit in Scotland, the head of the [[International Monetary Fund]], Dominique Strauss-Khan, said, "transactions are very difficult to measure and so it's very easy to avoid a transaction tax."&lt;ref name="Lukewarm"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/8348653.stm|title=Lukewarm reaction to UK tax plan |author=[[BBC]] |date=7 November 2009 |work= |publisher= [[BBC]]|accessdate=2009-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, in early December 2009, economist [[Stephany Griffith-Jones]] agreed that the "greater centralisation and automisation of the exchanges' and banks' clearing and settlements systems ... makes avoidance of payment more difficult and less desirable."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2009/dec/07/tobin-tax-climate-change-investment |title=Now let's tax transactions |author=Stephany Griffith-Jones |date=7 December 2009 |work= |publisher= [[The Guardian]]|accessdate=2010-01-13 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2010, feasibility of the tax was supported and clarified by researchers Rodney Schmidt, Stephan Schulmeister and Bruno Jetin who noted "it is technically easy to collect a financial tax from exchanges ... transactions taxes can be collected by the central counterparty at the point of the trade, or automatically in the clearing or settlement process."&lt;ref name="box"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-566113 |title= Rewriting the rules on exchange rates (BOX: Controversy over IMF's likely dismissal of financial transaction taxes) |date=16 April 2010 |publisher=[[Bretton Woods Project]] |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schmidt Feasibility"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.imf.org/external/np/exr/consult/2009/pdf/Comment84.pdf |title= Notes on the Feasibility and Impact of a General Financial Transactions Tax; Civil society consultation with the IMF on 28 January 2010 |author=Rodney Schmidt, Principal Researcher, [[The North-South Institute]], Ottawa |date=28 January 2010 |work= |publisher= [[International Monetary Fund]]|accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; (All large-value financial transactions go through three steps. First dealers agree to a trade; then the dealers' banks match the two sides of the trade through an electronic central clearing system; and finally, the two individual financial instruments are transferred simultaneously to a central settlement system. Thus a tax can be collected at the few places where all trades are ultimately cleared or settled.)&lt;ref name="Schmidt Feasibility"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dillon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kairoscanada.org/en/ecojustice/news-list/news/archive/2010/04/browse/1/article/an-idea-whose-time-has-come-adopt-a-financial-transactions-tax/?tx_ttnews |title=An Idea Whose Time Has Come: Adopt a Financial Transactions Tax |author=John Dillon |date=May 2010 |work=KAIROS Policy Briefing Paper No. 24 revised and updated |publisher=[[KAIROS]] |accessdate=24 June 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120123144102/http://www.kairoscanada.org/en/ecojustice/news-list/news/archive/2010/04/browse/1/article/an-idea-whose-time-has-come-adopt-a-financial-transactions-tax/?tx_ttnews |archivedate=23 January 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When presented with the problem of speculators shifting operations to [[Offshore financial centre|offshore]] [[tax havens]], a representative of a "pro–Tobin tax" NGO argued as follows:
{{quote|Agreement between nations could help avoid the relocation threat, particularly if the tax were charged at the site where dealers or banks are physically located or at the sites where payments are settled or 'netted'. The relocation of [[Chase Manhattan Bank]] to an offshore site would be expensive, risky and highly unlikely – particularly to avoid a small tax. Globally, the move towards a centralized trading system means transactions are being tracked by fewer and fewer institutions. Hiding trades is becoming increasingly difficult. Transfers to tax havens like the [[Cayman Islands]] could be penalized at double the agreed rate or more. Citizens of participating countries would also be taxed regardless of where the transaction was carried out.&lt;ref name="Round"/&gt;}}

===Gradual implementation feasibility===
There has been debate as to whether one single nation could unilaterally implement a financial transaction tax. In the year 2000, "eighty per cent of foreign-exchange trading [took] place in just seven cities. Agreement [to implement the tax] by [just three cities,] London, New York and Tokyo alone, would capture 58 per cent of speculative trading."&lt;ref name="Round"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.newint.org/issue320/tobin.htm|title= Time for Tobin!|author= Robin Round (representative of [[Halifax Initiative]])|date= January–February 2000|work= |publisher= [[New Internationalist]]|accessdate= 2009-12-17|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20091206100227/http://www.newint.org/issue320/tobin.htm|archivedate= 6 December 2009|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, on 27 June 2010 at the [[2010 G-20 Toronto summit]], the G20 leaders declared that a "global tax" was no longer "on the table", but that individual countries will be able to decide whether to implement a [[Bank tax#1. Financial stability contribution .28FSC.29.2C or .22Bank tax.22|levy against financial institutions]] to recoup billions of dollars in taxpayer-funded bailouts.&lt;ref name="Madhavi Acharya-Tom Yew"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.thestar.com/business/bank/article/829540--banks-relieved-as-g20-backs-off-on-bank-tax |title=Banks relieved as G20 backs off on bank tax |author= Madhavi Acharya-Tom Yew|date=27 June 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Toronto Star]] |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We will look at it from various angles and consider all proposals.'"&lt;ref name="Tobin tax remains Treasury ambition"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/b827b62c-e5f4-11de-b5d7-00144feab49a.html?nclick_check=1 |title= Tobin tax remains Treasury ambition|author= Tobin tax remains Treasury ambition|date= 11 December 2009|work= |publisher=[[Financial Times]] |accessdate=2009-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the IMF presented its interim report&lt;ref name="interim"/&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC1"/&gt; for the G20 on 16 April 2010, it laid out three options: a [[bank tax]], a Financial Activities Tax (FAT), and a third option (which was not promoted but not ruled out), a financial transaction tax.&lt;ref name="Dillon"/&gt; On 16 April 2011, the IMF stated, it does not endorse a financial transaction tax, believing it "does not appear well suited to the specific purposes set out in the mandate from the G-20 leaders".&lt;ref name="interim"/&gt; However, it concedes that "The FTT should not be dismissed on grounds of administrative practicality".&lt;ref name="interim"/&gt;

Challenging the IMF's belittling of the financial transaction tax, Stephan Schulmeister of the [[Austrian Institute of Economic Research]] found that, "the assertion of the IMF paper, that a financial transaction tax 'is not focused on the core sources of financial instability', does not seem to have a solid foundation in the empirical evidence."&lt;ref name="proposals"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.brettonwoodsproject.org/art-566355 |title= IMF bank tax proposals cause controversy|author=[[Bretton Woods Project]] |date=17 June 2010 |work= |publisher=[[Bretton Woods Project]] |accessdate=24 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the IMF's watchdog group, the Independent Evaluation Office (IEO), released a report in 2011 which questioned the quality and level of bias in the IMF's research between 1999 and 2008. The report indicated that "there is a widely held perception that IMF research is message driven. About half of the authorities held this view, and more than half of the staff indicated that they felt pressure to align their conclusions with IMF policies and positions."&lt;ref name="relevence"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ieo-imf.org/ieo/pages/EvaluationImages124.aspx |title= Research at the IMF: Relevance and Utilization|author=IEO|date=21 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Computer security}}
In [[computing]], a '''firewall''' is a [[network security]] system that [[Network monitoring|monitors]] and controls incoming and outgoing [[network traffic]] based on predetermined security rules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Noureddine | last1=Boudriga | title=Security of mobile communications | publisher=CRC Press | date=2010 | location=Boca Raton | pages=32–33 | isbn=0849379423}}&lt;/ref&gt; A firewall typically establishes a barrier between a trusted internal network and untrusted external network, such as the [[Internet]].&lt;ref name="Oppliger 1997 94"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Oppliger|first=Rolf|title=Internet Security: FIREWALLS and BEYOND|journal=Communications of the ACM|date=May 1997|volume=40|issue=5|page=94|doi=10.1145/253769.253802}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Firewalls are often categorized as either '''network firewalls''' or '''host-based firewalls'''. Network firewalls filter traffic between two or more networks and run on network hardware. Host-based firewalls run on host computers and control network traffic in and out of those machines.

== History ==
The term ''[[firewall (construction)|firewall]]'' originally referred to a wall intended to confine a fire within a building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1= Canavan|first1=John E.|title=Fundamentals of Network Security|date=2001|publisher=Artech House|location=Boston, MA|isbn=9781580531764|page=212|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later uses refer to similar structures, such as the [[Firewall (engine)|metal sheet]] separating the engine compartment of a vehicle or aircraft from the passenger compartment. The term was applied in the late 1980s to network technology that emerged when the Internet was fairly new in terms of its global use and connectivity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liska|first1=Allan|title=Building an Intelligence-Led Security Program|date=Dec 10, 2014|publisher=Syngress|isbn=0128023708|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predecessors to firewalls for network security were the routers used in the late 1980s.&lt;ref name="report_unm"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.unm.edu/~treport/tr/02-12/firewall.pdf |title=A History and Survey of Network Firewalls |year=2002 |format=PDF |last1=Ingham |first1=Kenneth |last2=Forrest |first2=Stephanie |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== First generation: packet filters ===
[[File:Gufw 10.04.4.png|thumb|Screenshot of [[Uncomplicated Firewall#GUIs for Uncomplicated Firewall|Gufw]]: The firewall shows its settings for incoming and outgoing traffic.]]

The first reported type of network firewall is called a packet filter. Packet filters act by inspecting packets transferred between computers. When a packet does not match the packet filter's set of filtering rules, the packet filter either drops (silently discards) the packet, or rejects the packet (discards it and generate an [[Internet Control Message Protocol]] notification for the sender) else it is allowed to pass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Peltier|first1=Justin |first2=Thomas R. |last2=Peltier |title=Complete Guide to CISM Certification |date=2007 |publisher=CRC Press |location=Hoboken |isbn=9781420013252 |page=210}}&lt;/ref&gt; Packets may be filtered by source and destination [[network address]]es, protocol, source and destination [[port number]]s. The bulk of Internet communication in 20th and early 21st century used either [[Transmission Control Protocol]] (TCP) or [[User Datagram Protocol]] (UDP) in conjunction with [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|well-known ports]], enabling firewalls of that era to distinguish between, and thus control, specific types of traffic (such as web browsing, remote printing, email transmission, file transfer), unless the machines on each side of the packet filter used the same non-standard ports.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.skullbox.net/tcpudp.php|title=TCP vs. UDP : The Difference Between them|website=www.skullbox.net|language=en|access-date=2018-04-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;William R. Cheswick, Steven M. Bellovin, Aviel D. Rubin (2003). "[https://books.google.com/books?id=_ZqIh0IbcrgC&amp;lpg=PA142&amp;dq=Firewalls%20and%20Internet%20Security%2C%20by%20Cheswick%20et%20al.&amp;pg=PA176#v=onepage&amp;q=Firewalls%20and%20Internet%20Security,%20by%20Cheswick%20et%20al.&amp;f=false Google Books Link]". ''[[Firewalls and Internet Security]]: repelling the wily hacker''&lt;/ref&gt;

The first paper published on firewall technology was in 1988, when engineers from [[Digital Equipment Corporation]] (DEC) developed filter systems known as packet filter firewalls. At [[Bell Labs|AT&amp;T Bell Labs]], [[William Cheswick|Bill Cheswick]] and [[Steven M. Bellovin|Steve Bellovin]] continued their research in packet filtering and developed a working model for their own company based on their original first generation architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cs.unm.edu/~treport/tr/02-12/firewall.pdf |title=A History and Survey of Network Firewalls |year=2002 |format=PDF |last1=Ingham |first1=Kenneth |last2=Forrest |first2=Stephanie |page=4 |accessdate=2011-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Second generation: stateful filters ===
{{Main article|Stateful firewall}}
From 1989–1990, three colleagues from [[AT&amp;T Bell Laboratories]], Dave Presotto, Janardan Sharma, and Kshitij Nigam, developed the second generation of firewalls, calling them [[circuit-level gateway]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=TnJk09xmdFsC&amp;pg=PA513&amp;lpg=PA513&amp;dq=circuit+level+gateways+at%26t&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=AJ1qvKxvGF&amp;sig=4RcxAO2-bENP2fbzIeSreghVe9E&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=g-5WU6qGGMmyyAS-lYC4DA&amp;ved=0CDYQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=circuit%20level%20gateways%20at%26t&amp;f=true |title=Proceedings of National Conference on Recent Developments in Computing and Its Applications, August 12–13, 2009|publisher=I.K. International Pvt. Ltd. |date=2009-01-01 |accessdate=2014-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Second-generation firewalls perform the work of their first-generation predecessors but operate up to layer 4 ([[transport layer]]) of the OSI model. This is achieved by retaining packets until enough information is available to make a judgment about its state.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Conway|first=Richard|title=Code Hacking: A Developer's Guide to Network Security|year=204|publisher=Charles River Media|location=Hingham, Massachusetts|isbn=1-58450-314-9|page=281}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

This type of firewall is potentially vulnerable to [[denial-of-service attack]]s that bombard the firewall with fake connections in an attempt to overwhelm the firewall by filling its connection state memory.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chang|first=Rocky|title=Defending Against Flooding-Based Distributed Denial-of-Service Attacks: A Tutorial|journal=IEEE Communications Magazine|date=October 2002|volume=40|issue=10|pages=42–43|doi=10.1109/mcom.2002.1039856}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--[[User:Kvng/RTH]]--&gt;

=== Third generation: application layer ===
[[File:Netfilter-packet-flow.svg|thumb|Flow of [[network packet]]s through [[Netfilter]], a [[Linux kernel]] module]]
{{Main article|Application level firewall}}
Marcus Ranum, Wei Xu, and Peter Churchyard developed an application firewall known as Firewall Toolkit (FWTK). In June 1994, Wei Xu extended the FWTK with the kernel enhancement of IP filter and socket transparent. This was known as the first transparent application firewall, released as a commercial product of Gauntlet firewall at [[Trusted Information Systems]]. Gauntlet firewall was rated one of the top firewalls during 1995–1998.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Citation confirming Ranum, Xu and Churchyards' work}}

The key benefit of [[application layer firewall|application layer filtering]] is that it can "understand" certain applications and protocols (such as [[File Transfer Protocol]] (FTP), [[Domain Name System]] (DNS), or [[Hypertext Transfer Protocol]] (HTTP)). This is useful as it is able to detect if an unwanted application or service is attempting to bypass the firewall using a protocol on an allowed [[List of TCP and UDP port numbers|port]], or detect if a protocol is being abused in any harmful way.

As of 2012, the so-called [[Next-Generation Firewall|next-generation firewall]] (NGFW) is nothing more than the "wider" or "deeper" inspection at the application layer. For example, the existing [[deep packet inspection]] functionality of modern firewalls can be extended to include:
* [[Intrusion prevention system]]s (IPS)
* User [[identity management]] integration (by binding user IDs to IP or MAC addresses for "reputation")
* [[Web application firewall]] (WAF). WAF attacks may be implemented in the tool "WAF Fingerprinting utilizing timing side channels" (WAFFle)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.usenix.org/conference/woot12/waffle-fingerprinting-filter-rules-web-application-firewalls |title=WAFFle: Fingerprinting Filter Rules of Web Application Firewalls |year=2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==
[[File:Firewall.png|thumb|An illustration of where a firewall would be located in a network]]
Firewalls are generally categorized as network-based or host-based. Network-based firewalls are positioned on the gateway computers of [[Local area network|LANs]], [[Wide Area Network|WANs]] and [[intranet]]s. They are either [[software appliance]]s running on general-purpose hardware, or hardware-based [[Computer appliance#Types of appliances|firewall computer appliances]]. Firewall appliances may also offer other functionality to the internal network they protect, such as acting as a [[DHCP]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Firewall as a DHCP Server and Client|url = https://paloaltonetworks.com/documentation/70/pan-os/pan-os/networking/firewall-as-a-dhcp-server-and-client.html|website = Palo Alto Networks|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = DHCP|url = http://www.shorewall.net/dhcp.htm|website = www.shorewall.net|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[VPN]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = What is a VPN Firewall? – Definition from Techopedia|url = https://www.techopedia.com/definition/30753/vpn-firewall|website = Techopedia.com|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = VPNs and Firewalls|url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc958037.aspx|website = technet.microsoft.com|access-date = 2016-02-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/cc753364%28v=ws.10%29.aspx|title = VPN and Firewalls (Windows Server)|date = |access-date = |website = Resources and Tools for IT Professionals {{!}} TechNet|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.techrepublic.com/article/configuring-vpn-connections-with-firewalls/|title = Configuring VPN connections with firewalls|date = |access-date = |website = |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; server for that network.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=Steven | last1=Andrés | title=Security Sage's Guide to Hardening the Network Infrastructure | publisher=Syngress | date=2004 | last2=Kenyon | first2=Brian | first3=Jody Marc | last3=Cohen | first4=Nate | last4=Johnson | first5=Justin | last5=Dolly | editor-first=Erik Pack | editor-last=Birkholz | location=Rockland, MA | pages=94–95 | isbn=9780080480831}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Host-based firewalls are positioned on the [[network node]] itself and control network traffic in and out of those machines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1=John R. | last1=Vacca | title=Computer and information security handbook | publisher=Elsevier | date=2009 | location=Amsterdam | page=355 | isbn=9780080921945}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://personalfirewall.comodo.com/what-is-firewall.html |title= What is Firewall?|accessdate=2015-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The host-based firewall may be a [[daemon (computing)|daemon]] or [[Windows service|service]] as a part of the [[operating system]] or an agent application such as [[endpoint security]] or protection. Each has advantages and disadvantages. However, each has a role in [[layered security]].

Firewalls also vary in type depending on where communication originates, where it is intercepted, and the state of communication being traced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Firewalls|url=http://www.tech-faq.com/firewall.html|publisher=MemeBridge|accessdate=13 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Network layer or packet filters ===
Network layer firewalls, also called packet filters, operate at a relatively low level of the [[Internet protocol suite|TCP/IP]] [[protocol stack]], not allowing packets to pass through the firewall unless they match the established rule set. The firewall administrator may define the rules; or default rules may apply. The term "packet filter" originated in the context of [[BSD]] [[operating systems]].

Network layer firewalls generally fall into two sub-categories, [[stateful firewall|stateful]] and [[stateless firewall|stateless]]. 

Commonly used packet filters on various versions of [[Unix]] are ''[[ipfirewall|ipfw]]'' ([[FreeBSD]], [[Mac OS X]] (&lt; 10.7)), ''[[NPF (firewall)|NPF]]'' ([[NetBSD]]), ''[[PF (firewall)|PF]]'' (Mac OS X (&gt; 10.4), [[OpenBSD]], and some other [[BSD]]s), ''[[netfilter|iptables]]''/''[[ipchains]]'' ([[Linux]]) and ''[[IPFilter]]''.{{Citation needed|date=April 2018|reason=Citation for firewalls used by MacOS}}

=== Application-layer ===
{{Main article|Application layer firewall}}

Application-layer firewalls work on the application level of the [[Internet protocol suite#Key architectural principles|TCP/IP stack]] (i.e., all browser traffic, or all [[telnet]] or FTP traffic), and may intercept all packets traveling to or from an application.

Application firewalls function by determining whether a process should accept any given connection. Application firewalls accomplish their function by hooking into socket calls to filter the connections between the application layer and the lower layers of the [[OSI model]]. Application firewalls that hook into socket calls are also referred to as socket filters. Application firewalls work much like a packet filter but application filters apply filtering rules (allow/block) on a per process basis instead of filtering connections on a per port basis. Generally, prompts are used to define rules for processes that have not yet received a connection. It is rare to find application firewalls not combined or used in conjunction with a packet filter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.symantec.com/connect/articles/software-firewalls-made-straw-part-1-2 |title=Software Firewalls: Made of Straw? Part 1 of 2 |publisher=Symantec Connect Community |date=2010-06-29 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, application firewalls further filter connections by examining the process ID of data packets against a rule set for the local process involved in the data transmission. The extent of the filtering that occurs is defined by the provided rule set. Given the variety of software that exists, application firewalls only have more complex rule sets for the standard services, such as sharing services. These per-process rule sets have limited efficacy in filtering every possible association that may occur with other processes. Also, these per-process rule sets cannot defend against modification of the process via exploitation, such as memory corruption exploits. Because of these limitations, application firewalls are beginning to be supplanted by a new generation of application firewalls that rely on [[mandatory access control]] (MAC), also referred to as [[Sandbox (computer security)|sandboxing]], to protect vulnerable services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://help.comodo.com/topic-72-1-451-4846-.html |title= Auto Sandboxing |publisher=Comodo Inc |accessdate=2014-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Proxies ===
{{Main article|Proxy server}}

A proxy server (running either on dedicated hardware or as software on a general-purpose machine) may act as a firewall by responding to input packets (connection requests, for example) in the manner of an application, while blocking other packets. A proxy server is a gateway from one network to another for a specific network application, in the sense that it functions as a proxy on behalf of the network user.&lt;ref name="Oppliger 1997 94"/&gt;

Proxies make tampering with an internal system from the external network more difficult, so that misuse of one internal system would not necessarily cause a security breach exploitable from outside the [[Red/black concept|firewall]] (as long as the application proxy remains intact and properly configured). Conversely, intruders may hijack a publicly reachable system and use it as a proxy for their own purposes; the proxy then [[Spoofing attack|masquerades]] as that system to other internal machines. While use of internal address spaces enhances security, [[security cracking|crackers]] may still employ methods such as [[IP spoofing]] to attempt to pass packets to a target network.

=== Network address translation ===
{{Main article|Network address translation}}
Firewalls often have [[network address translation]] (NAT) functionality, and the hosts protected behind a firewall commonly have addresses in the "private address range", as defined in RFC 1918. Firewalls often have such functionality to hide the true address of computer which is connected to the network. Originally, the NAT function was developed to address the limited number of IPv4 routable addresses that could be used or assigned to companies or individuals as well as reduce both the amount and therefore cost of obtaining enough public addresses for every computer in an organization. Although NAT on its own is not considered a security feature, hiding the addresses of protected devices has become an often used defense against [[Vulnerability scanner|network reconnaissance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/hh831365.aspx |title= Advanced Security: Firewall |publisher=Microsoft |accessdate=2014-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights''' (usually known in English as the '''Fundamental Rights Agency'''; '''FRA''') is a [[Vienna]]-based [[Agencies of the European Union|agency of the European Union]] inaugurated on 1 March 2007. It was established by [[European Union regulation|Council Regulation]] (EC) No 168/2007 of 15 February 2007.

==Mandate==
The FRA is an EU body tasked with "collecting and analysing data on [[fundamental rights]] with reference to, in principle, all rights listed in the [[Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union|Charter]]"; however, it is intended to focus particularly on "the thematic areas within the scope of EU law".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Proposal for a Council Regulation establishing a European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice_home/doc_centre/rights/doc/com_2005_280_en.pdf |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=23 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Those nine thematic areas are defined by Council Decision No 252/2013/EU of 11 March 2013, establishing a Multiannual Framework for 2013-2017 for the Agency. They are: access to justice; victims of crime; information society; Roma integration; judicial co-operation; rights of the child; discrimination; immigration and integration of migrants; and racism and xenophobia.

The FRA's primary methods of operation are surveys, reports, provision of expert assistance to [[Institutions of the European Union|EU bodies]], [[List of European Union member states|member states]], and [[Enlargement of the European Union|EU candidate countries and potential candidate countries]], and raising awareness about fundamental rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |url=http://ec.europa.eu/justice/fundamental-rights/agency/index_en.htm |publisher=European Commission |accessdate=28 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FRA is not mandated to intervene in individual cases but rather to investigate broad issues and trends.

==History==
The FRA was established in 2007 as the successor to the '''European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia''' (EUMC), which was also based in Vienna. The EUMC's mandate was narrower than that of the FRA, as it was restricted to issues of [[racism]] and [[xenophobia]].

The EUMC grew from the Commission on Racism and Xenophobia (CRX), established in 1994, and also known as the Kahn Commission. The CRX was transformed into the EUMC in June 1998; officially established by Council Regulation (EC) No 1035/97 of 2 June 1997.

==Publications and surveys==
Since its inception, the FRA has carried out surveys and  published reports which are available online. A full list of publications is given on Publications &amp; resources &gt; Publications. This section discusses reports that have seen significant attention from outside observers.

===Survey: Violence against Women===
In March 2014, FRA published a major survey on [[violence against women]], based on face-to-face interviews with over 42,000 women from across the 28 Member States of the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Violence against women: an EU-wide survey. Main results report |url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2014/violence-against-women-eu-wide-survey-main-results-report|publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Report reveals 'extensive' violence against women in EU|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/mar/05/violence-against-women-eu|publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The survey asked about their experiences of physical, [[sexual violence|sexual]] and psychological [[violence]] including incidents of [[intimate partner violence]] ('[[domestic violence]]'). Questions also asked about incidents of [[stalking]], [[sexual harassment]] and [[computer crime|online harassment]] as well as their experience of [[child abuse|violence in childhood]].

According to the responses of the report some of the key findings indicated that:
* 33% of women had experienced physical and/or sexual violence since the age of 15;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Violence against women: One-third of EU women affected – survey|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-26444655|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=5 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*22% had experienced physical and/or sexual violence by a partner;
*5% had been [[rape]]d, and;
*33% had childhood experiences of physical or sexual violence at the hands of an adult.

=== Survey: EU-MIDIS (Minorities and Discrimination)===
In 2009, FRA released a survey on the experiences of [[discrimination]], [[hate crime|racist crime]], and policing of [[ethnic minority|minority group]] and [[immigrant|immigration]] groups in the EU. The survey was based on the responses of 23,000 individuals from selected ethnic minority and immigrant groups, and additionally, 5,000 people from the majority population living in the same areas as minorities in 10 [[Member state of the European Union|Member States]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU MIDIS Main results report |url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/project/2011/eu-midis-european-union-minorities-and-discrimination-survey|publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU MIDIS: FRA survey sheds new light on extent of racism in the EU |url=http://www.minoritycentre.org/news/eu-midis-fra-survey-sheds-new-light-extent-racism-eu|publisher=Regional Centre for Minorities |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Key findings of the survey include that:
* 55% of respondents thought that discrimination based on ethnic origin is widespread in their country, with 37% saying that they had experienced discrimination in the past 12 months;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Diskriminierung in der EU ist "gravierendes Problem"|url=http://www.kleinezeitung.at/s/chronik/3970958/Ethnische-Minderheiten_Diskriminierung-in-der-EU-ist-gravierendes|publisher=Kleine Zeitung|accessdate=1 August 2012|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402100051/http://www.kleinezeitung.at/s/chronik/3970958/Ethnische-Minderheiten_Diskriminierung-in-der-EU-ist-gravierendes|archivedate=2 April 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*12% said they had personally experienced a racist crime in the past 12 months, however 80% did not report the incident to the police;
* Roma reported the highest levels of discrimination, with one in two respondents saying that they were discriminated against in the last 12 months,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Los gitanos, la minoría más discriminada en Europa, por encima de árabes y judíos|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2010/04/09/espana/1270820841.html|publisher=El Mundo|accessdate=9 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and;
* high levels of discrimination were also mentioned by Sub-Saharan Africans (41%) and North Africans (36%).
A second round of the survey (EU-MIDIS II) is currently underway, and the results will be published in 2016. This will collect comparable data, and assess the impact of national anti-discrimination and equality legislation and policies in the EU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU-MIDIS II: European Union minorities and discrimination survey  |url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/project/2015/eu-midis-ii-european-union-minorities-and-discrimination-survey |publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Survey: European Union lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender survey ===
In 2013, FRA conducted an [[online survey]] to identify how [[lesbian]], [[gay]], [[bisexual]] and [[transgender]] ([[LGBT]]) people living in the European Union experience the fulfilment of their fundamental rights. This followed a 2009 report on [[homophobia]] and [[discrimination]] on grounds of [[sexual orientation]] or [[gender identity]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Homophobia and Discrimination on Grounds of Sexual Orientation in the EU Member States Part I – Legal Analysis |url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2010/homophobia-and-discrimination-grounds-sexual-orientation-eu-member-states-part-i|publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; which identified the need for comparative data on this issue.
The results reflect the experiences of more than 93,000 individuals&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=LGBT Discrimination In Europe: Most Gay People Afraid To Hold Hands In Public, Survey Says|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/05/17/lgbt-discrimination-europe-afraid-hold-hands_n_3292933.html|publisher=Huffington Post |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who completed the online survey across Europe. The aim was to support the development of more effective laws and policies to fight discrimination, violence and harassment, improving equal treatment across society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=EU LGBT survey: Poll on homophobia sparks concern|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22563843|publisher=BBC|accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From the findings, it was noted that:
*2 out of 3 LGBT respondents were hid or disguised being LGBT at school;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Fear, isolation and discrimination common in Europe's LGBT community|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2013/0517/450822-lgbt-survey/|publisher=RTE |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*19% of respondents felt discriminated against at work or when looking for a job, despite legal protection under EU law, and;
*More than 1/4 of LGBT people who answered the survey had been attacked or threatened with violence in the last five years, while more than half of these did not report the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=EU LGBT survey: Poll on homophobia sparks concern|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-22563843|publisher=BBC |accessdate=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Methodology====
The online survey methodology was chosen to ensure the anonymity of ‘hard-to-reach’ or ‘closeted’ LGBT populations, to encourage reporting of sensitive or negative experiences, such as criminal victimisation, and eliminate bias, which could have been introduced by telephone or face-to-face interview approaches.&lt;ref name="fra.europa.eu"&gt;{{cite web |title=EU LGBT Survey Technical Report and Questions &amp; answers on LGBT survey methodology |url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/survey/2012/eu-lgbt-survey|publisher=European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |accessdate=24 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Multiple responses were discouraged through the length (approximately 30 minutes) and complexity of the survey, while the input process in the different countries was closely monitored for falsifications. The results are not intended to be representative of all LGBT people in the EU, but provide the largest collection of empirical evidence on the experiences of LGBT people in Europe to date.&lt;ref name="fra.europa.eu"/&gt;
Data about the perceptions of discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation or gender identity of the general public was not included in the survey, as it is already collected by [[Eurobarometer]]. The analysis of the results in the EU LGBT survey – Main results report compares some Eurobarometer data with the EU LGBT survey results.&lt;ref name="fra.europa.eu"/&gt;

===Survey: Roma===
The Agency has a [http://fra.europa.eu/en/project/2013/multi-annual-roma-programme multi-annual Roma programme] to allow it "to make regular reports on progress made and provide evidence based advice to the EU institutions and Member States based on data systematically collected across the EU". Data from the 2011 Roma survey is available via an [http://fra.europa.eu/DVS/DVT/roma.php online data explorer tool].

EUMC published reports are available from the website here&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fra.europa.eu/en/publications-and-resources/publications?title=&amp;year%5Bmin%5D%5Byear%5D=&amp;year%5Bmax%5D%5Byear%5D=&amp;related_content=&amp;language=All&amp;publisher=80&amp;=Apply |title=Publications &amp;#124; European Union Agency for Fundamental Rights |website=Fra.europa.eu |date=2005-07-07 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; of the FRA, the EUMC successor agency. A selection is given below.

===Report: Working Definition of Antisemitism===
{{main|Working Definition of Antisemitism}}
In 2005, the EUMC published a working definition of [[antisemitism]], whose stated purpose was to "provide a guide for identifying incidents, collecting data and supporting the implementation and enforcement of legislation dealing with antisemitism". In November 2013 the definition was removed from the organisation's website in 'a clear-out of non-official documents'. A spokesperson stated that the document had never been viewed as a valid definition and that "We are not aware of any official definition".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wiesenthal.com/site/apps/nlnet/content.aspx?c=lsKWLbPJLnF&amp;b=8776547&amp;ct=13381863 |title=SWC to EU Baroness Ashton: "Return Anti-Semitism Definition Document to EU Fundamental Rights Agency Website" &amp;#124; Simon Wiesenthal Center |website=Wiesenthal.com |date=2013-11-06 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ToI&gt;{{cite news|title=EU drops its ‘working definition’ of anti-Semitism|url=http://www.timesofisrael.com/eu-drops-its-working-definition-of-anti-semitism/|accessdate=2014-01-24|newspaper=Times of Israel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Report: Rise in antisemitic attacks in the EU===
In May 2014, a report labeled 'Manifestations of [[antisemitism]] in the EU 2002 – 2003' was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
| title      = Manifestations of Antisemitism in the EU 2002-2003
| url        = http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/AS-Main-report.pdf
| publisher  = European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia
| accessdate = 24 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It detailed a rise in attacks targeting Jewish businesses, [[synagogues]], [[cemeteries]] and individuals. The countries with the most significant number of attacks were [[Belgium]], [[France]], [[Germany]], the [[Netherlands]] and the [[UK]]. A second report, on perceptions of antisemitism, was also published.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fra.europa.eu/en/publication/2010/manifestations-antisemitism-eu-2002-2003 Manifestations of Antisemitism in the EU 2002 – 2003, FRA website&lt;/ref&gt;

===Report: Rise of Islamophobic attacks in the EU following 9/11===

The largest monitoring project ever to be commissioned regarding [[Islamophobia]] was undertaken following [[9/11]] by the European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia (EUMC).

From a total of 75 reports, 15 from each member state, a synthesis report, entitled "Summary report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001", was published in May 2002.&lt;ref name=AllenNielsen&gt;{{cite web
| title      = Summary Report on Islamophobia in the EU after 11 September 2001
| url        = http://fra.europa.eu/fraWebsite/attachments/Synthesis-report_en.pdf
| publisher  = European Monitoring Centre on Racism and Xenophobia
| accessdate = 24 July 2010
| author     = Christopher Allen
|author2=[[Jørgen S. Nielsen]] 
| location   = Vienna
|date=May 2002
| authorlink = Chris Allen (author)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The report highlighted occasions in which citizens abused and sometimes violently attacked [[Muslim]]s. Discrimination included verbal abuse, indiscriminately accusing Muslims of responsibility for the attacks, removing women's [[hijab]], spitting, using the name "Usama" as a pejorative epithet, and assaults. The report concluded that "a greater receptivity towards anti-Muslim and other xenophobic ideas and sentiments has, and may well continue, to become more tolerated".&lt;ref name=AllenNielsen/&gt;

== Reception ==
{{POV section|date=July 2015}}
The need for a new human rights institution was questioned given that human rights policy was a principal concern of the [[Council of Europe]] (CoE), of which all EU member states were also members.&lt;ref&gt;Financial Times, 7. February 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007 the British Conservative MEP [[Syed Kamall]] said: "The Fundamental Rights Agency will take £20m (30m euros) of taxpayers' money and use it to advance a partisan agenda with little accountability to anyone".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/6407985.stm |title=Europe &amp;#124; EU gets fundamental rights agency |publisher=[[BBC News]] |date=2007-03-01 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010 the German newspaper ''[[Die Welt]]'' reported that the centre-right French politician [[Pierre Lellouche]], then EU minister in the [[Nicolas Sarkozy|Sarkozy]] government, questioned "the added value" of the FRA when the Council of Europe already took care of human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.welt.de/politik/ausland/article7888056/Die-verrueckte-Behoerdenschwemme-in-der-EU.html |title=Immer mehr Agenturen: Die verrückte Behördenschwemme in der EU - DIE WELT |website=Welt.de |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A Resolution adopted in September 2009, in which the EP condemned a "Law on the Protection of Minors", which was then under discussion in Lithuania, as "homophobic" and requested the FRA to issue a legal opinion on whether the draft law was compatible with the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://euobserver.com/9/28680|title=EU parliament condemns Lithuanian anti-gay law|last=Phillips|first=Leigh|date=2009-09-17|publisher=EUobserver|accessdate=2009-09-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lithuanian Parliament, however, responded by adopting a Resolution that condemned the EP's Resolution as an "illegal act" (pointing to the fact that the FRA explicitly has no mandate to examine the legislation adopted by Member States) and requesting the Lithuanian Government to take legal action against the EP before the [[European Court of Justice]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lithuaniatribune.com/2009/11/10/the-controversial-lithuanian-law-on-protection-of-minors-%E2%80%93-lithuanian-parliament-v-european-parliament/#comment-546 |title=The controversial Lithuanian Law on Protection of Minors – Lithuanian Parliament v.

'''Gun Owners South Africa''' (abbreviated to '''GOSA''') is a firearms rights and advocacy group in the [[South Africa|Republic of South Africa]]. It was founded on 26 January 2004 by Abios Khoele, Charl van Wyk, Pieter van Wyk, Juan de greeff, Martin Hedington, Dr. Richard Wesson, Peter Moss, and Thomas Eastes. While in excess of ten years old, the organisation only started to gain traction around 2015, with the first significant attempts at membership growth occurring late 2016.

GOSA is the most diverse firearms group in South Africa, on levels ranging from race, gender, and religion, to political affiliation and income levels. GOSA’s membership is on public display on its Facebook page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GOSA Facebook Page; GOSA : Gun Owners South Africa |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/gunownerssa/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the founding members of GOSA, [[Charl van Wyk]], was a congregant at the St. James Church in Cape Town when the St. James Church Massacre happened. [[Azanian People's Liberation Army|Azanian People’s Liberation Army]] (APLA) militants attacked the church with automatic rifles and a grenade. Van Wyk was armed with a five-shot snub nosed revolver at the time, and returned fire, prompting the attackers to flee. The death toll stood at eleven, and an injured count of fifty-eight when the chaos ended.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first1=Kieren|last1= Legg|first2=Neo|last2= Maditla|title=20 years later St James horror endures |url=https://www.iol.co.za/news/crime-courts/20-years-later-st-james-horror-endures-1552670}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Larry Pratt]], head of [[Gun Owners of America]], spoke at a GOSA conference at the time of GOSA's founding, and publicly criticized the South African police chief who opposed the group.&lt;ref name="HorwitzAnderson2009"&gt;{{cite book|first1=Joshua|last1=Horwitz|first2=Casey|last2=Anderson|title=Guns, Democracy, and the Insurrectionist Idea|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9qDIamIBC90C&amp;pg=PA48|date=1 January 2009|publisher=University of Michigan Press|isbn=0-472-02199-0|pages=48–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[File:Photo of Gun Owners South Africa Founders and Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.jpg|thumb|A photo taken at the founding of Gun Owners South Africa at the Parow Civic Centre in Cape Town, attended by Larry Pratt of Gun Owners of America.Left to right: T.F. Eastes, P. van Wyk, A. Khoele, W. de Waal, L. Pratt, R. Boothroyd, C. van Wyk]]
Gun Owners South Africa was founded in 2004 in response to disillusionment with the other established firearm rights group, the South African Gun Owners Association (SAGA). SAGA has been in existence since 1985, and is still active to present day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SAGA at 30 Years |url=https://www.saga.org.za/SAGA-30-YEARS/}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the years 2004 until 2015, GOSA was largely silent and inconspicuous on the South African political and firearms rights fronts. In 2011, the South African homicide rate started a gradual climbing trend{{Citation needed|reason=Source?|date=January 2018}}, and in 2013, revelations of the bad state of affairs and corruption at the Central Firearms Registry had emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Daneel|last=Knoetze|title=SAPS: R400 million firearms control system in shambles |url=https://mg.co.za/article/2014-10-18-r400-million-firearms-control-system-in-shambles}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2015, the GOSA leadership had realised that disillusionment with SAGA was not going to change any time soon, and started to slowly put in place the necessary mechanisms of moving towards a professionally organised organisation, including a paid membership structure and benefits such as legal financial insurance against firearm discharge under legal circumstances. Other changes included a more inclusive and simplified brand name (changing from the old English and Afrikaans abbreviations "Wapeneienaars Suid Africa / Gun Owners South Africa" (WESA/GOSA), to just the English abbreviation, and a logo update. Additionally, GOSA also contributed a significant amount of funding to Dr. David Klatzow's work on the validity of ballistic fingerprinting, which delivered a scathing rebuke of the 'science' in his article "Defective Science: An Inquiry into the Valaidity of Ballistic Fingerprinting as a Reliable Tool and into the Feasibility of Establishing an Effective national Ballistic Imaging Database". Towards the end of 2015 and start of 2016, it became clear that paid membership structures in their current form were inefficient and putting the finances at a deficit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Oxley|title=Address to Volunteers |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/2361645800726540/permalink/2452753848282401/|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were unbundled and simplified, with the insurance offering being moved to Gunsure (a now discontinued firearm insurance firm), and the membership offerings instead reflecting discount legal services for firearm administrative matters pertaining to firearm licensing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Address to Volunteers |url=http://www.gosaonline.co.za/gosa-gun-owners-sa-join/silver-member |access-date=2018-01-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180116135240/http://www.gosaonline.co.za/gosa-gun-owners-sa-join/silver-member# |archive-date=2018-01-16 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; With the collapse of Gunsure, GOSA started to look back at bundling a reformed insurance membership option for firearm owners in January 2018.

With the start to 2017, the reformed membership structures had started turning significant profits for the organisation, and this afforded the ability to hire a small complement of full time staff, allow the funding of more travelling expenses for official business (such as flights between Pretoria and Cape Town, where the capital and parliamentary precinct are based respectively), a new website, and put a presence with a permanent stand at the Huntex firearms and hunting expo in Gauteng and the Eastern Cape. The investment in a Huntex presence dealt a negative drag to GOSA, and the leadership quickly culled the initiative before the 2018 Huntex expos went ahead. By November 2017, GOSA had stabilized the financial flows again.

In the year from January 2016 until December 2017, Facebook membership had grown from just shy of 21 000 members, to 35 000. Paid membership growth was slower, rising from zero in late 2015, to over three thousand at the end of 2017. In a country of between 2.5 million to 3.0 million firearm owners, these numbers are very low, and GOSA faces an uphill battle in mobilising as many as possible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|first1=L.|last1=Bopape|first2=R.|last2=Snyman|title=An Analysis of the Measures Used to Control Firearms in South Africa: Looking Back and Looking Forward |journal=South African Journal of Criminology|issue=Special Edition Number 5|pages=114–130}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2018, Jonathan Wright lodged a complaint on behalf of GOSA with the [[Press Council of South Africa]] against [[Jacaranda FM|Jacaranda 94.2 FM]] after an article on the latter's website claimed that research shows people are four times more likely to have their own firearms used against them; and that having a firearm in one's home "has been proven to increase the risk of a firearm [[homicide]] or firearm [[suicide]] in the home" unless it is kept in a [[safe]]. GOSA argued that the first claim was unsubstantiated and the second was biased, and asked for Jacaranda FM to publicly retract the statements. The article was pulled once controversy surrounding the claims came about, but no reason for taking the piece down was given. The Press Ombud, Johan Retief, ruled that Jacaranda had "to publish a retraction, correction or explanation as to ''why'' the story was pulled", which is required by section 1.10 of the Press Code.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.presscouncil.org.za/Ruling/View/gun-owners-south-africa-vs-jacaranda-942-fm-4235|title=The Press Ombudsman|website=www.presscouncil.org.za|language=en|access-date=2018-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Political activity ==
GOSA is not associated with any political parties or candidates, and opts instead to engage and lobby directly with political entities willing to engage.

On the other hand, within this Sphere GOSA is diametrically opposed to the disarmament of law abiding citizens and organizations, such as [[Gun Free South Africa]], which promote that agenda.

== Programs ==
GOSA currently{{when|date=January 2018}} runs the GOSA Girls on Fire campaign, which was started in 2015 to coincide with the [[16 Days of Activism against Gender-based Violence|16 Days of Activism]], which is aimed at teaching and increasing female participation in firearm related activities. The campaign is run by female organisers, and regularly helps new female firearm owners with carry techniques, training, and promoting firearm safety and etiquette.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=GOSA Girls on Fire |url=http://www.gosaonline.co.za/girls-on-fire-gosa-gun-owners-sa}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans are in the formation to start hosting official GOSA events, such as the touted first time ever Gauteng Firearms Festival, focusing on showcasing firearm and self-defence exhibits and hosting shooting competitions and activities, at the [[Municipal Police (South Africa)|Johannesburg Metropolitan Police Department]] shooting range.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Paul|last=Oxley|title=Address to Volunteers |url=https://www.facebook.com/groups/2361645800726540/permalink/2452753848282401/|subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Organisational structure ==
GOSA is headed by a chairperson, who chairs an Executive Committee, which was created in 2015.
*Thomas Eastes (2006-2015)
*Paul Oxley (2015–present)

The Executive Committee is currently composed of:
*Paul Oxley (Sitting Chairperson)
*Bryan Mennie
*Wouter De Waal
*Gideon Joubert
*Aziza De Villers
*Craig Pederson

GOSA's organisational structure also includes numerous volunteers who operate and advocate for GOSA with no remuneration.

== Public image ==
GOSA is currently largely unknown in public life, although this is changing as it becomes more vocal within [[Parliament of South Africa|Parliament]] and political circles. It has not drawn any criticism, controversy or been involved with any scandals.

Published in 1925, '''{{lang|es|La raza cósmica}}''' ('''''The Cosmic Race''''') is an essay written by Mexican philosopher, secretary of education, and 1929 presidential candidate [[José Vasconcelos]] to express the ideology of a future "fifth race" in the Americas; an agglomeration of all the races in the world with no respect to color or number to erect a new civilization: Universópolis.

As he explains in his literary work, armies of people would then go forth around the world professing their knowledge. Vasconcelos continues to say that the people of the Iberian regions of the Americas (that is to say, the parts of the continent colonised by Portugal and Spain) have the territorial, racial, and spiritual factors necessary to initiate the "universal era of humanity".

Claiming that the [[Social Darwinism|Darwinist]] ideologies are "scientific" theories only created to validate, explain, and justify ethnic superiority and to repress others, Vasconcelos attempts to refute these theories and goes on to recognize his words as being an ideological effort to improve the cultural morale of a "depressed race" by offering his optimistic theory of the future development of a cosmic race.

==Usage of phrase==
The title {{lang|es|La raza cósmica}}, in English ''The Cosmic Race'', embodies the notion that traditional, exclusive concepts of so-called "[[Race (human categorization)|race]]" and [[nationality]] can be transcended in the name of humanity's common destiny. It originally referred to a movement by Mexican intellectuals during the 1920s who pointed out that so-called [[Latin Americans|"Latin" Americans]] have the blood of all the world's so-called "races": European, Asian-descended native Americans, and Africans, thereby transcending the peoples of the "[[Old World]]".

Vasconcelos also [[Allusion|alluded]] to the term when he coined the National Autonomous University of Mexico's motto: "{{lang|es|Por mi raza hablará el espíritu}}" ('Through my race the spirit will speak').

The term has come, often in its shortened version ''[[la Raza]]'', to refer to the [[Multiracial|mixed-race people]] of [[Latin America]], i.e., primarily [[mestizo]]s, [[mulatto]]s, and [[zambo]]s, or all [[Pardo|three combined]]. Vasconcelos also used the expression {{lang|es|la raza de [[Bronze (color)|bronce]]}} ('the [[bronze race]]'), in this same sense.{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

Radical activists [[Penelope Rosemont|Penelope]] and [[Franklin Rosemont]] and Tor Faegre helped to popularize the phrase by printing thousands of "Make Love, Not War" buttons at the Solidarity Bookshop in Chicago, Illinois and distributing them at the Mother's Day Peace March in 1965. They were the first to print the slogan.&lt;ref&gt;Rosemont, Penelope. ''Dreams and Everyday Life: A Sixties Notebook.'' Chicago: Charles H. Kerr, 2008:40-41.&lt;/ref&gt; In April 1965, at a Vietnam demonstration in Eugene, Oregon, Diane Newell Meyer, then a senior at the University of Oregon, pinned a handwritten note on her sweater reading "Let's make love, not war", thus marking the beginning of the popularity of this phrase. A picture of Meyer wearing the slogan was printed in the ''[[Eugene Register-Guard]]'', after which a related article turned up in ''[[The New York Times]]'' on May 9, 1965.

When the slogan was used during a protest in California in 1967, then Governor [[Ronald Reagan]] joked: "Those guys [the protesters] look like they can't make either of both".&lt;ref&gt;D'Souza, Dinesh: ''Ronald Reagan: How an Ordinary Man Became an Extraordinary Leader'', p.&amp;nbsp;71, Simon and Schuster 1999, {{ISBN|0684848236}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
*The slogan was featured in two 1973 songs: [[John Lennon]]'s "[[Mind Games (John Lennon song)|Mind Games]]" and [[Bob Marley]]'s "No More Trouble" (first released on the album ''[[Burnin' (The Wailers album)|Burnin']]'').
*[[David Allyn]] named his 2001 book after the slogan: ''[[Make Love, Not War: The Sexual Revolution: An Unfettered History]]''.
*In the movie 1989 ''[[Field of Dreams]]'', fictional character Terence Mann is credited with coining the phrase.
*The character of 'Pop', in the futuristic [[Queen (band)|Queen]] musical play ''[[We Will Rock You (musical)|We Will Rock You]]'', shouts "Make love, not war!" as he is brainwashed at the start of the show, which leads into the stage performance of "[[Radio Ga Ga]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | title=We Will Rock You (London Cast Album) | url=http://www.ultimatequeen.co.uk/queen/songs/we-will-rock-you-musical-uk-cast.htm | website=www.ultimatequeen.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*A 2006 episode of ''[[South Park]]'' is named "[[Make Love, Not Warcraft]]".
*On the DEC [[PDP-10]], typing the command "make love" would result in the response "not war?". This action was copied on some [[Ancient UNIX|older versions]] of [[Unix]].

In [[military]] usage, a '''military asset''' is a [[weapon]] or [[means of production]] of weapons or other [[Defense (military)|defensive]] or [[Offensive (military)|offensive]] devices or capabilities.

==Description==
Whether a military asset is considered a [[capital asset]], or part of a [[public infrastructure]], is a matter of definition. War planners may deem individuals and other items in war zones and rebel controlled area as military assets and not civilian infrastructure. This can include train lines, water plants, agricultural factories, and medicine supplies.

Tactical imagery is used to find concealed high-value assets like artillery placements, ammo dumps and other logistical sites. Terrain and the proximity to supported units would dictate probable locations of logistical routes, ammo dumps, supply depots and assembly areas. Being that the military by definition embraces uniformity, patterns of emplacement and concealment are targeting by the opposing forces assets (such as artillery and air strikes). The size, shape, and surroundings of items frequently gave away the location of military assets and identifiable targets.

[[Marilyn Waring]] argued in the 1980s that under the [[UN System of National Accounts]] there was no clear differentiator of investment in [[public good]]s versus weaponry, and that this distorted the entire monetary system.  ''See [[monetary reform]] for more on this issue.''

{{Redirect|MDG}}

[[File:MDGs.svg|thumb|Official logos for each of the Millennium Development Goals.]]

The '''Millennium Development Goals''' ('''MDGs''') were the eight [[international development]] [[goal]]s for the year 2015 that had been established following the [[Millennium Summit]] of the [[United Nations]] in 2000, following the adoption of the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]]. All 191 [[United Nations member states]] at that time, and at least 22 [[international organizations]], committed to help achieve the following Millennium Development Goals by 2015:

# To eradicate [[extreme poverty]] and hunger
# To achieve [[universal primary education]]
# To promote [[gender equality]] and empower women
# To reduce [[child mortality]]
# To improve [[maternal health]]
# To combat [[HIV/AIDS]], [[malaria]], and other diseases
# To ensure environmental sustainability&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml], United Nations Millennium Development Goals website, retrieved 21 September 2013&lt;/ref&gt;
# To develop a global partnership for development&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/bkgd.shtml Background page], United Nations Millennium Development Goals website, retrieved 16 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flag of the United Nations.svg|thumb|The Millennium Development Goals are a UN initiative.]]

Each goal had specific targets, and dates for achieving those targets. To accelerate progress, the [[G8]] finance ministers agreed in June 2005 to provide enough funds to the [[World Bank]], the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF) and the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB) to cancel $40 to $55&amp;nbsp;billion in debt owed by members of the [[heavily indebted poor countries]] (HIPC) to allow them to redirect resources to programs for improving health and education and for alleviating poverty.

Interventions evaluated include (1) improvements required to meet the millennium development goals (MDG) for water supply (by halving by 2015 the proportion of those without access to safe drinking water), (2) meet the water MDG plus halving by 2015 the proportion of those without access to adequate sanitation, (3)increasing access to improved water and sanitation for everyone, (4) providing disinfection at point-of-use over and above increasing access to improved water supply and sanitation (5) providing regulated piped water supply in house and sewage connection with partial sewerage for everyone (Hutton, G. Evaluation of the Cost and Benefits of Water and Sanitation Improvements at the Global Level, 2004 WHO-Geneva)

Critics of the MDGs complained of a lack of analysis and justification behind the chosen objectives, and the difficulty or lack of measurements for some goals and uneven progress, among others. Although developed countries' aid for achieving the MDGs rose during the challenge period, more than half went for debt relief and much of the remainder going towards [[natural disaster]] relief and military aid, rather than further development.

As of 2013, progress towards the goals was uneven. Some countries achieved many goals, while others were not on track to realize any. A UN conference in September 2010 reviewed progress to date and adopted a global plan to achieve the eight goals by their target date. New commitments targeted women's and children's health, and new initiatives in the worldwide battle against poverty, hunger and disease (

Among the non-governmental organizations assisting were the United Nations Millennium Campaign, the Millennium Promise Alliance, Inc., the Global Poverty Project, the [[Micah Challenge UK|Micah Challenge]], The Youth in Action EU Programme, "Cartoons in Action" video project and the 8 Visions of Hope global art project.

The [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) replaced the MDGs in 2016.

{{toclimit|3}}

== Background ==
=== Millennium Summit ===
Preparations for the 2000 [[Millennium Summit]] launched with the report of the Secretary-General entitled, "We the people: The Role of the United Nations in the Twenty-First Century". Additional input was prepared by the Millennium Forum, which brought together representatives of over 1,000 non-governmental and civil society organizations from more than 100 countries. The Forum met in May to conclude a two-year consultation process covering issues such as [[poverty reduction|poverty eradication]], [[environmental protection]], human rights and protection of the [[social vulnerability|vulnerable]].

MDGs derive from earlier development targets, where world leaders adopted the [[United Nations Millennium Declaration]]. The approval of the Millennium Declaration was the main outcome of the Millennium Summit.

The MDGs originated from the United Nations [[Millennium Declaration]]. The Declaration asserted that every individual has dignity; and hence, the right to freedom, equality, a basic standard of living that includes freedom from hunger and violence and encourages tolerance and solidarity. The MDGs set concrete targets and indicators for poverty reduction in order to achieve the rights set forth in the Declaration.&lt;ref&gt;An Introduction to the Human Development and Capability Approach: Freedom and Agency'&lt;/ref&gt;

===Precursors===
The [[Report of the Panel on United Nations Peacekeeping|Brahimi Report]] provided the basis of the goals in the area of peace and security.{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}}

The Millennium Summit Declaration was, however, only part of the origins of the MDGs. More ideas came from Adam Figueroa,{{citation needed|date=January 2014}} [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD), the [[World Bank]] and the [[International Monetary Fund]]. A series of UN‑led conferences in the 1990s focused on issues such as children, nutrition, human rights and women. The OECD criticized major donors for reducing their levels of [[Official Development Assistance]] (ODA). UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] signed a report titled, ''We the Peoples: The Role of the United Nations in the 21st Century''. The OECD had formed its International Development Goals (IDGs). The two efforts were combined for the World Bank's 2001 meeting to form the MDGs.&lt;ref&gt;"The Political Economy of the MDGs: Retrospect and Prospect for the World's Biggest Promise"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human capital, infrastructure and human rights===
The MDGs emphasized three areas: [[human capital]], [[infrastructure]] and human rights ([[economic, social and cultural rights|social, economic]] and [[civil and political rights|political]]), with the intent of increasing living standards.&lt;ref&gt;"The Millennium Development Goals Report"&lt;/ref&gt; Human capital objectives include nutrition, healthcare (including [[child mortality]], [[HIV/AIDS]], [[tuberculosis]] and [[malaria]], and [[reproductive health]]) and education. Infrastructure objectives include access to safe drinking water, energy and modern information/communication technology; increased farm outputs using sustainable practices; transportation; and environment. Human rights objectives include empowering women, reducing violence, increasing political voice, ensuring equal access to public services and increasing security of property rights. The goals were intended to increase an individual’s [[capability approach|human capabilities]] and "advance the means to a productive life". The MDGs emphasize that each nation's policies should be tailored to that country's needs; therefore most policy suggestions are general.

===Partnership===
MDGs emphasize the role of developed countries in aiding developing countries, as outlined in Goal Eight, which sets objectives and targets for developed countries to achieve a "global partnership for development" by supporting [[fair trade]], debt relief, increasing aid, access to affordable essential medicines and encouraging technology transfer. Thus developing nations ostensibly became partners with developed nations in the struggle to reduce world poverty.

==Goals==

The MDGs were developed out of several commitments set forth in the [[Millennium Declaration]], signed in September 2000.

==Criticism==
===General===
General criticisms include a perceived lack of analytical power and justification behind the chosen objectives.&lt;ref name="idrc.ca"&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Deneulin | first1 = Séverine | last2 = Shahani | first2 = Lila | author-link1 = Séverine Deneulin | title = An introduction to the human development and capability approach freedom and agency | publisher = Earthscan International Development Research Centre | location = Sterling, Virginia Ottawa, Ontario | year = 2009 | isbn = 9781844078066 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The MDGs lack strong objectives and indicators for within-country equality, despite significant disparities in many developing nations.&lt;ref name=idrc.ca /&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Can the MDGs provide a pathway to social justice?: The challenge of intersecting inequalities. 2010. Naila Kabeer for Institute of Development Studies.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iterations of proven local successes should be scaled up to address the larger need through human energy and existing resources using methodologies such as [[participatory rural appraisal]], [[asset-based community development]], or [[SEED-SCALE]].&lt;!-- originally developed under [[UNICEF]] and now tested in a number of countries over two decades--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel C. Taylor, Carl E. Taylor, Jesse O. Taylor, ‘’Empowerment on an Unstable Planet: From Seeds of Human Energy to a Scale of Global Change’’ (New York: Oxford University Press, 2012) p.25-33.&lt;/ref&gt;

MDG&amp;nbsp;8 uniquely focuses on donor achievements, rather than development successes. The ''[[Commitment to Development Index]]'', published annually by the [[Center for Global Development]] in Washington, D.C., is considered the best numerical indicator for MDG&amp;nbsp;8.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/hdr03_complete.pdf |title=Human Development Report 2003 |format=PDF |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a more comprehensive measure of donor progress than official development assistance, as it takes into account policies on a number of indicators that affect developing countries such as trade, migration and investment.

The MDGs were attacked for insufficient emphasis on environmental [[sustainability]].&lt;ref name="idrc.ca" /&gt; Thus, they do not capture all elements needed to achieve the ideals set out in the Millennium Declaration.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Agriculture was not specifically mentioned in the MDGs even though most of the world's poor are farmers.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Alleged lack of legitimacy===
The entire MDG process has been accused of lacking [[legitimacy (political)|legitimacy]] as a result of failure to include, often, the voices of the very participants that the MDGs seek to assist. The International Planning Committee for Food Sovereignty, in its post 2015 thematic consultation document on MDG 69 states "The major limitation of the MDGs by 2015 was the lack of political will to implement due to the lack of ownership of the MDGs by the most affected constituencies".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Position International Planning Committee on Food Sovereignty Informal Thematic Consultation Hunger, Food and Nutrition Post 2015, CSA actors|url=http://www.fao.org/fsnforum/post2015/sites/post2015/files/files/IPC%20declarat%20post2015%2B%2011feb%20(ES%20EN).pdf|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human rights===
The MDGs may under-emphasize local participation and empowerment (other than women’s empowerment).&lt;ref name=idrc.ca /&gt; FIAN International, a human rights organization focusing on the right to adequate food, contributed to the Post 2015 process by pointing out a lack of: "primacy of human rights; qualifying policy coherence; and of human rights based monitoring and [[accountability]]. Without such accountability, no substantial change in national and international policies can be expected."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=FIAN International|title=Post 2015 Thematic Consultation|url=http://www.fao.org/fsnforum/post2015/comments/2?page=1|accessdate=7 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Human capital===
MDG 2 focuses on primary education and emphasizes enrollment and completion. In some countries, primary enrollment increased at the expense of achievement levels. In some cases, the emphasis on primary education has negatively affected secondary and post-secondary education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Waage |first=Jeff|title=The Millennium Development Goals: a cross-sectoral analysis and principles for goal setting after 2015 |url=http://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(10)61196-8/fulltext |date=18 September 2010 |journal=The Lancet |volume=376 |issue=9745 |pages=991–1023 |doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(10)61196-8|display-authors=etal |pmid=20833426}}{{registration required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A publication from 2005 argued that goals related to [[maternal mortality]], [[malaria]] and [[tuberculosis]] are impossible to measure and that current UN estimates lack scientific validity or are missing.&lt;ref name="Amir Attaran 2005"&gt;{{cite journal|first=Amir |last=Attaran |authorlink=Amir Attaran |date=October 2005 |title=An Immeasurable Crisis? A Criticism of the Millennium Development Goals and Why They Cannot Be Measured |journal=[[PLOS Medicine]] | volume=2 | issue=10 | page=318 | doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0020318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Household surveys are the primary measure for the health MDGs but may be poor and duplicative measurements that consume limited resources. Furthermore, countries with the highest levels of these conditions typically have the least reliable data collection. The study also argued that without accurate measures, it is impossible to determine the amount of progress, leaving MDGs as little more than a rhetorical call to arms.&lt;ref name="Amir Attaran 2005"/&gt;

MDG proponents such as McArthur and Sachs countered that setting goals is still valid despite measurement difficulties, as they provide a political and operational framework to efforts. With an increase in the quantity and quality of healthcare systems in developing countries, more data could be collected.&lt;ref name="McArthur JW 2005"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = McArthur | first1 = J. W. | last2 = Sachs | first2 = J. D. | last3 = Schmidt-Traub | first3 = G. | doi = 10.1371/journal.pmed.0020379 | title = Response to Amir Attaran | journal = PLoS Medicine | volume = 2 | issue = 11 | pages = e379 | year = 2005 | pmid =  16288557| pmc =1297542 }}&lt;/ref&gt; They asserted that non-health related MDGs were often well measured, and that not all MDGs were made moot by lack of data.

The attention to well being other than income helps bring funding to achieving MDGs.&lt;ref name=idrc.ca /&gt; Further MDGs prioritize interventions, establish obtainable objectives with useful measurements of progress despite measurement issues and increased the developed world’s involvement in worldwide poverty reduction.&lt;ref name=haines&gt;Andy Haines and Andrew Cassels. 2004. "Can The Millennium Development Goals Be Attained?" ''BMJ: British Medical Journal'', Vol. 329, No. 7462 (14 August 2004), pp. 394-397&lt;/ref&gt; MDGs include gender and reproductive rights, environmental sustainability, and spread of technology. Prioritizing interventions helps developing countries with limited resources make decisions about allocating their resources. MDGs also strengthen the commitment of developed countries and encourage aid and information sharing.&lt;ref name=idrc.ca /&gt; The global commitment to the goals likely increases the likelihood of their success. They note that MDGs are the most broadly supported poverty reduction targets in world history.&lt;ref name="undp.org"&gt;United Nations. 2006. "The Millennium Development Goals Report: 2006." United Nations Development Programme, www.undp.org/publications/MDGReport2006.pdf (accessed 2 January 2008).&lt;/ref&gt;

Achieving the MDGs does not depend on economic growth alone. In the case of MDG&amp;nbsp;4, developing countries such as [[Bangladesh]] have shown that it is possible to reduce child mortality with only modest growth with inexpensive yet effective interventions, such as [[measles]] immunization.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/blogs/2010/08/addressing-the-inequalities-in-child-survival/ ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100902084512/http://www.savethechildren.org.uk/blogs/2010/08/addressing-the-inequalities-in-child-survival/ |date=2 September 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, government expenditure in many countries is not enough to meet the agreed spending targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/docs/6325.pdf/ |title=The Feasibility of Financing Sectoral Development Targets |accessdate=2014-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research on health systems suggests that a "one size fits all" model will not sufficiently respond to the individual healthcare profiles of developing countries; however, the study found a common set of constraints in scaling up international health, including the lack of absorptive capacity, weak health systems, human resource limitations, and high costs. The study argued that the emphasis on coverage obscures the measures required for expanding health care. These measures include political, organizational, and functional dimensions of scaling up, and the need to nurture local organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Subramanian |first=Savitha |author2=Joseph Naimoli |author3=Toru Matsubayashi |author4=David Peters |title=Do We Have the Right Models for Scaling Up Health Services to Achieve the Millennium Development Goals?|journal=BMC Health Services Research |year=2011|volume=11|issue=336|doi=10.1186/1472-6963-11-336|url=http://www.futurehealthsystems.org/publications/do-we-have-the-right-models-for-scaling-up-health-services-t.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fundamental issues such as gender, the divide between the humanitarian and development agendas and economic growth will determine whether or not the MDGs are achieved, according to researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute]] (ODI).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender and the MDGs|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=2386&amp;title=gender-mdgs-gender-lens-vital-pro-poor-results/ |work=ODI Briefing Paper|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=MDGs and the humanitarian-development divide |url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=1937&amp;title=mdgs-humanitarian-development-divide|work=ODI Briefing Paper|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Economic Growth and the MDGs|url=http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4892&amp;title=millennium-development-goals-equitable-growth-policy-brief|work=ODI Briefing Paper|publisher=[[Overseas Development Institute]]|accessdate=7 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Health Partnership]] (IHP+) aimed to accelerate MDG progress by applying international principles for effective aid and development in the health sector. In developing countries, significant funding for health came from external sources requiring governments to coordinate with international development partners. As partner numbers increased variations in funding streams and bureaucratic demands followed. By encouraging support for a single national health strategy, a single monitoring and evaluation framework, and mutual accountability, IHP+ attempted to build confidence between government, civil society, development partners and other health stakeholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.internationalhealthpartnership.net/en/ |title=IHP+ The International Health Partnership|publisher=Internationalhealthpartnership.net |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Equity===
Further developments in rethinking strategies and approaches to achieving the MDGs include research by the [[Overseas Development Institute]] into the role of [[equity (economics)|equity]].&lt;ref name=ODI2&gt;Vandemoortele, Milo (2010) [http://www.odi.org.uk/resources/details.asp?id=4895&amp;title=mdgs-equity "The MDGs and Equity"], Overseas Development Institute.&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers at the ODI argued that progress could be accelerated due to recent breakthroughs in the role equity plays in creating a [[virtuous circle and vicious circle|virtuous circle]] where rising equity ensures the poor participate in their country's development and creates reductions in poverty and financial stability.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Yet equity should not be understood purely as economic, but also as [[equity (legal concept)|political]]. Examples abound, including Brazil's [[cash transfers]], [[Uganda]]'s eliminations of user fees and the subsequent huge increase in visits from the very poorest or else [[Mauritius]]'s dual-track approach to liberalization (inclusive growth and inclusive development) aiding it on its road into the [[World Trade Organization]].&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt; Researchers at the [[Overseas Development Institute|ODI]] thus propose equity be measured in league tables in order to provide a clearer insight into how MDGs can be achieved more quickly; the ODI is working with partners to put forward league tables at the 2010 MDG review meeting.&lt;ref name=ODI2/&gt;

The effects of increasing drug use were noted by the ''International Journal of Drug Policy'' as a deterrent to the goal of the MDGs.&lt;ref name=singer&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Singer | first1 = M | year = 2008 | title = Drugs and Development: The Global Impact of Drug Use and Trafficking on Social and Economic Development | url = | journal = International Journal of Drug Policy | volume = 19 | issue = 6| pages = 467–478 | doi=10.1016/j.drugpo.2006.12.007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Women's issues===
[[File:Geena Davis at the podium (9922450166).jpg|thumb|The Hollywood actress [[Geena Davis]] in a speech at the MDG Countdown event at the [[Ford Foundation]] in New York, addressing gender roles and issues in film such as her organisation's work in combating [[inequality in Hollywood]] (24 September 2013)]]
Increased focus on gender issues could accelerate MDG progress, e.g. empowering women through access to paid work could help reduce child mortality.&lt;ref name="Kabeer, Naila 2003"&gt;Kabeer, Naila. 2003. ''Gender Mainstreaming in Poverty Eradication and the Millennium Development Goals: A Handbook for Policy-Makers and Other Stakeholders''. Commonwealth Secretariat.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[South Asia]]n countries babies often suffered from [[low birth weight]] and high mortality due to limited access to healthcare and maternal [[malnutrition]]. Paid work could increase women's access to health care and better nutrition, reducing child mortality. Increasing female education and workforce participation increased these effects. Improved economic opportunities for women also decreased participation in the sex market, which decreased the spread of AIDS, MDG&amp;nbsp;6A.&lt;ref name="Kabeer, Naila 2003"/&gt;
Another way in which women can be empowered is through access to paid work. Kabeer states that this access increases women’s agency in their households, it does so in the economic and political spheres as well. A study of women in rural Mexico found that those of them engaged in industrial work were able to negotiate and obtain a greater degree of respect in their households. Additionally, another study from Tanzania found that increased access to paid work led to a long-term reduction in domestic violence.  Lastly, Women’s employment and access to financial resources increased their political participation. Data from Bangladesh indicates that longer membership in microfinance organizations have many positive effects including higher levels of political participation and improved access to government programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kabeer|first1=Naila|title=Gender equality and women’s empowerment: a critical analysis of the third millennium development goal|journal=Gender and Development|date=2005|volume=13|issue=Gender and Development|pages=13–24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the resources, technology and knowledge exist to decrease poverty through improving gender equality, the political will is often missing.&lt;ref name="Grown, Caren 2005"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Grown | first1 = Caren | year = 2005 | title = Answering the Skeptics: Achieving Gender Equality and the Millennium Development Goals | url = | journal = Development | volume = 48 | issue = 3| pages = 82–86 | doi=10.1057/palgrave.development.1100170}}&lt;/ref&gt; If donor and developing countries focused on seven "priority areas", great progress could be made towards the MDG. These seven priority areas include: increasing girls’ completion of secondary school, guaranteeing sexual and reproductive health rights, improving infrastructure to ease women’s and girl’s time burdens, guaranteeing women’s property rights, reducing gender inequalities in employment, increasing seats held by [[women in government]], and combating violence against women.&lt;ref name="Grown, Caren 2005"/&gt;

It is thought{{By whom|date=December 2016}} that the current MDGs targets do not place enough emphasis on tracking gender inequalities in poverty reduction and employment as there are only gender goals relating to health, education, and political representation.&lt;ref name="Kabeer, Naila 2003"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Noeleen Heyzer. 2005. "Making the Links: Women's Rights and Empowerment Are Key to Achieving the Millennium Development Goals". ''Gender and Development'', Vol.&amp;nbsp;13, No.&amp;nbsp;1, Millennium Development Goals (March 2005), pp. 9-12&lt;/ref&gt; To encourage women’s empowerment and progress towards the MDGs, increased emphasis should be placed on gender mainstreaming development policies and collecting data based on gender.{{According to whom|date=December 2016}}

==Progress==

Progress towards reaching the goals has been uneven across countries. [[Brazil]] achieved many of the goals,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdgmonitor.org/country_progress.cfm?c=BRA&amp;cd= |title=Brazil: Quick Facts |publisher=MDG Monitor |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others, such as [[Benin]], are not on track to realize any.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdgmonitor.org/country_progress.cfm?c=BEN&amp;cd= |title=Benin: Quick Facts |publisher=MDG Monitor |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The major successful countries include China (whose [[Poverty in China|poverty population]] declined from 452 million to 278 million) and India.&lt;ref name="econ.lse.ac.uk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://econ.lse.ac.uk/staff/rburgess/wp/jep11.pdf |title=Halving Global Poverty |format=PDF |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[World Bank]] estimated that MDG&amp;nbsp;1A (halving the proportion of people living on less than $1 a day) was achieved in 2008 mainly due to the results from these two countries and East Asia.&lt;ref&gt;Chen, Shaohua and [[Martin Ravallion]], (29 February 2012) "[http://siteresources.worldbank.org/INTPOVCALNET/Resources/Global_Poverty_Update_2012_02-29-12.pdf An Update to the World Bank’s Estimates of Consumption Poverty in the Developing World]" Development Research Group, World Bank, Retrieved 14 August 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1990s [[Nepal]] was one of the world's poorest countries and remains South Asia's poorest country. Doubling health spending and concentrating on its poorest areas halved maternal mortality between 1998 and 2006. Its [[Multidimensional Poverty Index]] has seen the largest decreases of any tracked country. [[Bangladesh]] has made some of the greatest improvements in infant and maternal mortality ever seen, despite modest income growth.&lt;ref name=econ2013&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/news/international/21586601-eradicating-extreme-poverty-no-longer-pipe-dream-first-governments-must-agree |title=Poverty: Growth or safety net? |publisher=The Economist |date=2013-09-21 |accessdate=2013-10-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1990 and 2010 the population living on less than $1.25 a day in developing countries halved to 21%, or 1.2 billion people, achieving MDG1A before the target date, although the biggest decline was in China, which took no notice of the goal. However, the child mortality and maternal mortality are down by less than half. Sanitation and education targets will also be missed.&lt;ref name=econ2013/&gt;

===Multilateral debt reduction===
[[G8|G‑8]] Finance Ministers met in [[London]] in June 2005 in preparation for the [[31st G8 summit|Gleneagles Summit]] in July and agreed to provide enough funds to the World Bank, IMF and the [[African Development Bank]] (AfDB) to cancel the remaining HIPC multilateral debt ($40 to $55&amp;nbsp;billion). Recipients would theoretically re-channel debt payments to health and education.&lt;ref name=Carrasco&gt;E.&amp;nbsp;Carrasco, C.&amp;nbsp;McClellan, &amp; J.&amp;nbsp;Ro (2007) [http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/contents/part4-I.shtml "Foreign Debt:  Forgiveness and Repudiation"] University of Iowa Center for International Finance and Development E-Book {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080731123358/http://www.uiowa.edu/ifdebook/ebook2/contents/part4-I.shtml |date=31 July 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Gleaneagles plan became the Multilateral Debt Relief Initiative (MDRI). Countries became eligible once their lending agency confirmed that the countries had continued to maintain the reforms they had implemented.&lt;ref name=Carrasco /&gt;

While the World Bank and AfDB limited MDRI to countries that complete the HIPC program, the IMF's eligibility criteria were slightly less restrictive so as to comply with the IMF's unique "uniform treatment" requirement. Instead of limiting eligibility to HIPC countries, any country with [[per capita income]] of $380 or less qualified for debt cancellation. The IMF adopted the $380 threshold because it closely approximated the HIPC threshold.&lt;ref name=Carrasco /&gt;

===Sub-Saharan Africa===
{{see also|The Earth Institute}}
One success was to strengthen rice production in Sub-Saharan Africa. By the mid‑1990s, rice imports reached nearly $1&amp;nbsp;billion annually. Farmers had not found suitable rice varieties that produce high yields. [[New Rice for Africa]] (NERICA), a high-yielding and well adapted strain, was developed and introduced in areas including Congo Brazzaville, Côte d'Ivoire, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Guinea, Kenya, Mali, Nigeria, Togo and Uganda. Some 18 varieties of this strain became available, enabling African farmers to produce enough rice to feed their families and have extra to sell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mdgmonitor.org/story.cfm?goal=1 |title=Goal :: Tracking the Millennium Development Goals |publisher=Mdg Monitor |date=2007-11-01 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region also showed progress towards MDG&amp;nbsp;2. School fees that included Parent-Teacher Association and community contributions, textbook fees, compulsory uniforms and other charges took up nearly a quarter of a poor family’s income and led countries including [[Burundi]], the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]], [[Ethiopia]], [[Ghana]], [[Kenya]], [[Malawi]], [[Mozambique]], [[Tanzania]], and [[Uganda]] to eliminate such fees, increasing enrollment. For instance, in Ghana, public school enrollment in the most deprived districts rose from 4.2&amp;nbsp;million to 5.4&amp;nbsp;million between 2004 and 2005. In Kenya, primary school enrollment added 1.2&amp;nbsp;million in 2003 and by 2004, the number had climbed to 7.2&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mdgmonitor.org/story.cfm?goal=2 |title=Goal: Tracking the Millennium Development Goals|publisher=MDG Monitor |date=1 November 2007|accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Following the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), in 2000, [[Jeffrey Sachs]] of [[The Earth Institute]] at [[Columbia University]] was among the leading academic scholars and practitioners on the MDGs. He chaired the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (2000–01), which played a pivotal role in scaling up the financing of health care and disease control in the low-income countries to support MDGs 4, 5, and 6. He worked with UN Secretary-General [[Kofi Annan]] in 2000–2001 to design and launch [[The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria]].&lt;ref name="Mountains Beyond Mountains"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kidder|first1=Tracy|title=Mountains Beyond Mountains|date=2003|publisher=Random House|location=New York|page=257|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also worked with senior officials of the [[George W. Bush administration]] to develop the PEPFAR program to fight [[HIV/AIDS]], and the PMI to fight [[malaria]]. On behalf of Annan, from 2002 to 2006 he chaired the [[UN Millennium Project]], which was tasked with developing a concrete action plan to achieve the MDGs. The UN General Assembly adopted the key recommendations of the UN Millennium Project at a special session in September 2005. The recommendations for rural Africa are currently being implemented and documented in the Millennium Villages, and in several national scale-up efforts such as in Nigeria.

The [[Millennium Villages Project]], which Sachs directs, operates in more than a dozen African countries and covers more than 500,000 people. The MVP has engendered considerable controversy associated as critics have questioned both the design of the project and claims made for its success.  In 2012 ''[[The Economist]]'' reviewed the project and concluded "the evidence does not yet support the claim that the millennium villages project is making a decisive impact."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/feastandfamine/2012/05/jeffrey-sachs-and-millennium-villages?zid=295&amp;ah=0bca374e65f2354d553956ea65f756e0|title=Jeffrey Sachs and the millennium villages: Millennium bugs|accessdate=September 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics have pointed to the failure to include suitable controls that would allow an accurate determination of whether the Projects methods were responsible for any observed gains in economic development. A 2012 ''Lancet'' paper claiming a 3-fold increase in the rate of decline in childhood mortality was criticized for flawed methodology, and the authors later admitted that the claim was "unwarranted and misleading".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2013/06/24/does-it-take-a-village|title=Does It Take a Village?|date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although developed countries' financial aid rose during the Millennium Challenge, more than half went towards debt relief. Much of the remainder aid money went towards disaster relief and military aid. According to the [[United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affairs]] (2006), the 50 least developed countries received about one third of all aid that flows from developed countries.&lt;ref name=singer /&gt;

=== Funding commitment ===
Over the past 35 years, UN members have repeatedly "commit[ted] 0.7% of rich-countries' [[Measures of national income and output|gross national income]] (GNI) to [[Official development assistance|Official Development Assistance]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/press/07.htm |title=Press Archive |publisher=UN Millennium Project |accessdate=2012-10-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150218162526/http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/press/07.htm |archivedate=18 February 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commitment was first made in 1970 by the [[UN General Assembly]].

The text of the commitment was:
{{quote|Each economically advanced country will progressively increase its official development assistance to the [[Developing country|developing countries]] and will exert its best efforts to reach a minimum net amount of 0.7 percent of its gross national product at market prices by the middle of the decade.&lt;ref name="unmillenniumproject.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/reports/costs_benefits2.htm |title=Publications |publisher=UN Millennium Project |date=2007-01-01 |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====European Union====
In 2005 the [[European Union]] reaffirmed its commitment to the 0.7% aid targets, noting that "four out of the five countries, which exceed the UN target for ODA of 0.7%, of GNI are member states of the European Union".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/EUExternalRelations24May.pdf |title=External Relations Council, Brussels 24 May 2005 |publisher=Unmillenniumproject.org |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Further, the UN "believe[s] that donors should commit to reaching the long-standing target of 0.7 percent of GNI by 2015".&lt;ref name="unmillenniumproject.org"/&gt;

===United States===
However, the United States as well as other nations disputed the [[Monterrey Consensus]] that urged "developed countries that have not done so to make concrete efforts towards the target of 0.7% of gross national product (GNP) as ODA to developing countries".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/07_aconf198-11.pdf |title=United Nations Report of the International Conference on Financing for Development|format=PDF |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usunnewyork.usmission.gov/fact_sheet/ecosoc_Chapter_4_apr15.pdf ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090508175513/http://www.usunnewyork.usmission.gov/fact_sheet/ecosoc_Chapter_4_apr15.pdf |date=8 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The US consistently opposed setting specific foreign-aid targets since the [[United Nations General Assembly|UN General Assembly]] first endorsed the 0.7% goal in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.businessweek.com/bwdaily/dnflash/sep2005/nf2005092_5264_db039.htm |title=Bush Balks at Pact to Fight Poverty |date=2 September 2005 |work=BusinessWeek online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====OECD====
Many [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] (OECD) nations, did not donate 0.7% of their GNI. Some nations' contributions fell far short of 0.7%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.unmillenniumproject.org/documents/endorse_TI_19Jan05.pdf |title=Poverty Can Be Halved If Efforts Are Coupled with Better Governance, says TI |publisher=UN Millennium Project |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Australian government committed to providing 0.5% of GNI in International Development Assistance by 2015-2016.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ausaid.gov.au/media/release.cfm?BC=Media&amp;ID=5854_3696_6753_7484_7221 ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401231906/http://www.ausaid.gov.au/media/release.cfm?BC=Media&amp;ID=5854_3696_6753_7484_7221 |date=1 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Review Summit 2010===
A major conference was held at [[UN headquarters]] in New York on 20–22 September 2010 to review progress.  The conference concluded with the adoption of a global action plan to accelerate progress towards the eight anti-poverty goals.  Major new commitments on women's and children's health, poverty, hunger and disease ensued.

===MDG3===
According to MDG Monitor, the target under MDG 3 "To eliminate gender disparity in primary and secondary education by 2005, and in all levels of education by 2015" was met.&lt;ref name="Monitor"&gt;{{Cite web|quote=Gender disparity has reduced dramatically at all levels of education in the developing regions since 2000, hitting the MDG target.|url=http://www.mdgmonitor.org/mdg-3-promote-gender-equality-and-empower-women/|title=MDG 3: Promote gender equality and empower women|date=15 November 2016|accessdate=1 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However MDG monitor points out that while parity has been achieved across the developing world, there are regional and national differences favouring girls in some cases and boys in others.  In secondary education in "Western Asia, Oceania, and sub-Saharan Africa, girls are still at a disadvantage, while the opposite is true in Latin America and the Caribbean – boys are at a disadvantage."  Similarly in tertiary education there are disparities "at the expense of men in Northern Africa, Eastern Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean" while conversely they are "at the expense of women in Southern Asia and sub-Saharan Africa."&lt;ref name="Monitor" /&gt;

== Improvements ==
Improving living conditions in developing countries may encourage healthy workers not to move to other places that offer a better lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Haines|first=Andy|author2=Andrew Cassels|title=Can the Millennium Development Goals Be Attained?|journal=British Medical Journal|date=August 2004|volume=329 | issue = 7462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Cuba]], itself a developing country, played a significant role in providing medical personnel to other developing nations; it has trained more than 14,500 medical students from 30 different countries at its [[ELAM (Latin American School of Medicine) Cuba|Latin American School of Medicine]] in [[Havana]] since 1999. Moreover, some 36,000 Cuban physicians worked in 72 countries, from Europe to Southeast Asia, including 31 African countries, and 29 countries in the Americas. Countries such as [[Honduras]], [[Guatemala]], and [[Nicaragua]] benefit from Cuban assistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Huish|first=Robert|title=Canadian Foreign Aid for Global Health: Human Security Opportunity Lost|journal=Can Foreign Policy|year=2009|issue=1192-6422|page=60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Post 2015 development agenda==
Although there have been major advancements and improvements achieving some of the MDGs even before the deadline of 2015, the progress has been uneven between the countries. In 2012 the UN Secretary-General established the "UN System Task Team on the Post-2015 UN Development Agenda", bringing together more than 60 UN agencies and international organizations to focus and work on sustainable development.&lt;ref name="ECOSOC MDGs Post Agenda"&gt;{{cite web|title=Millennium Development Goals and post-2015 Development Agenda|url=https://www.un.org/en/ecosoc/about/mdg.shtml|website=The United Nations|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the MDG Summit, UN Member States discussed the [[Post-2015 Development Agenda]] and initiated a process of consultations. Civil society organizations also engaged in the post-2015 process, along with academia and other research institutions, including think tanks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/beyond2015.shtml |title=United Nations Millennium Development Goals |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2012-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Sustainable Development Goals]] (SDGs) have been proposed as targets relating to future international development once they expire at the end of 2015.

On 31 July 2012, Secretary-General [[Ban Ki-moon]] appointed 26 public and private leaders to advise him on the post-MDG agenda.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.un.org/millenniumgoals/Press%20release_post-2015panel.pdf |title=UN Secretary-General Appoints High-Level Panel on Post-2015 Development Agenda |publisher=Un.org |accessdate=2012-10-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, the UN's [[Commission on the Status of Women]] agreed on a document that called for the acceleration of progress towards achieving the millennium development goals, and confirmed the need for a stand-alone goal on gender equality and women's empowerment in post-2015 goals, and for gender equality to underpin all of the post-2015 goals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/2014/mar/23/campaigners-welcome-agreement-un-gender-csw-talks&lt;/ref&gt;

===UN Goals===
UN Goals is a global project dedicated to spreading knowledge of MDG through various internet and offline awareness campaigns.This has had tremendous progress.

===Libraries and the Millennium Development Goals===
Librarians and others in the information professions are in a unique position to help achieve the Millennium Development Goals. It is often the dissemination of key information, e.g., about health, that changes daily life and can affect an entire community.

Millennium Development Goals are not only for the developing world. Maret (2011) specifically addresses how U.S. public libraries can help the United States meet the goals.&lt;ref&gt;Maret, S. (2011). True community: connecting the Millennium Development Goals to public library services in the United States. Information, Society and Justice, 4(2), 29-55.&lt;/ref&gt; The work of U.S. librarians has evolved in a manner that incorporates human rights values and precepts without having generally used the language that characterizes the philosophical and ethical goals of human rights and human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ala.org/offices/olos/olosprograms/jeanecoleman/index3|title=Librarians and Human Rights {{!}} Offices of the American Library Association|website=www.ala.org|access-date=2016-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Librarians are able to further the Millennium Development Goals and contribute by providing information and services to all people in varying formats and languages.

Albright and Kwooya (2007) report that cultural and financial barriers in Sub-Saharan Africa impede LIS education programs. As a result, MDG goals for poverty, healthcare, and education fall short. High rates of HIV/AIDS, and escalating child and maternal mortality are the direct result of poverty and substandard medical care. Limited instruction in information access and exchange contributes to this ongoing dilemma.&lt;ref&gt;Albright, K., &amp; Kawooya, D. (2007). Libraries in the time of AIDS: African perspectives and recommendations for a revised model of LIS education. International Information And Library Review, 39(Library and Information Science Education in Developing Countries), 109-120.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Miller v. Johnson''''', 515 U.S. 900 (1995), was a [[Supreme Court of the United States|United States Supreme Court]] case concerning "affirmative [[gerrymandering]]/racial gerrymandering", where racial minority-majority electoral districts are created during [[redistricting]] to increase minority [[United States Congress|Congressional]] representation.

==Background==
Only one of Georgia's ten congressional districts was primarily African American between 1980 and 1990. According to the 1990 Census, Georgia's increase in population entitled the state to an eleventh congressional seat. That  prompted Georgia's General Assembly to re-draw the state's [[congressional districts]]. After the [[United States Department of Justice|Justice Department]] denied several of the Assembly's proposed new districts, as the state's population was 27% African-American, but formed a majority in only one of the now 11 districts, the Assembly drew the 11th district to create a second majority-black district. However the district lacked any sort of organic structure, and  was deemed a "geographic monstrosity" because it extended 6,784.2 square miles from Atlanta to the Atlantic Ocean. The case was brought to court by white voters in [[Georgia's 11th congressional district|the Eleventh Congressional District]] of the [[U.S. state|state]] of [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]].

==Question Before the Supreme Court==
Is racial gerrymandering of the congressional redistricting process a violation of the [[Equal Protection Clause]]?

==Decision of the Court==
Writing for the majority, [[Justice Kennedy]] wrote the opinion for the Court. Ruling against the district, the Court declared the district [[unconstitutional]] under the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the [[Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution|Fourteenth Amendment]], according to the interpretation in ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' (1993).  The court noted that in some instances, "a reapportionment plan may be so highly irregular and bizarre in shape that it rationally cannot be understood as anything other than an effort to segregate voters based on race." Applying the rule laid down in ''[[Shaw v. Reno]]'' requires strict scrutiny whenever race is the "overriding, predominant force" in the redistricting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=''Miller v.

Its 42 members are business, religious, and political leaders from all over the United States.  The Council focuses its public policy advocacy on reversing the rise in hate crimes based on religion in the United States.

'''Nasserism''' ({{Lang-ar|التيار الناصري}} ''at-Tayyār an-Nāṣerī'') is a [[Arab socialism|socialist]] [[Arab nationalism|Arab nationalist]] [[List of political ideologies|political ideology]] based on the thinking of [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]], one of the two principal leaders of the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952]] and [[Egypt]]'s second [[President of Egypt|President]]. Spanning the domestic and international spheres, it combines elements of [[Arab socialism]], [[republicanism]], [[nationalism]], [[anti-imperialism]], [[Developing country|developing world solidarity]] and [[Non-Aligned Movement|international non-alignment]]. In the 1950s and 1960s, Nasserism was amongst the most potent political ideologies in the [[Arab world]]. This was especially true following the [[Suez Crisis]] of 1956 (known in Egypt as the Tripartite Aggression), the political outcome of which was seen as a validation of Nasserism and a tremendous defeat for [[Western world|Western]] [[Imperialism|imperial]] powers. During the [[Cold War]], its influence was also felt in other parts of [[Africa]] and the developing world, particularly with regard to anti-imperialism and non-alignment.

The scale of the Arab defeat in the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967 damaged the standing of Nasser and the ideology associated with him. Though it survived Nasser's death in 1970, certain important tenets of Nasserism were revised or abandoned totally by his successor [[Anwar Sadat]] during what he termed the [[Corrective Revolution (Egypt)|Corrective Revolution]] and later his ''[[Infitah]]'' economic policies. Under the three decade rule of Sadat's successor [[Hosni Mubarak]], most of the remaining socialist infrastructure of Egypt was replaced by [[Neoliberalism|neoliberal]] policies strongly at odds with Nasserist principles. In the international arena, Mubarak departed almost entirely from traditional Egyptian policy, becoming a steadfast ally of both the [[United States government]] and [[Israel]], the latter still viewed by most Egyptians with enmity and distrust, derived largely from the five wars that Egypt fought against Israel between 1948 and 1973.

During Nasser's lifetime, Nasserist groups were encouraged and often supported financially by Egypt to the extent that many became seen as willing agents of the Egyptian government in its efforts to spread revolutionary nationalism in the Arab world. In the 1970s, as a younger generation of Arab revolutionaries came to the fore Nasserism outside Egypt metamorphosed into other Arab nationalist and [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arabist]] movements, including component groups of the [[Lebanese National Movement]] during the [[Lebanese Civil War]].  The main Nasserite movements that continued to be active until today on the Lebanese scene are mainly represented by the organization in [[Sidon]] of populist Nasserist partisans (''al-Tanzim al-Sha'bi al-Nassiri'') that are led by Oussama Saad and in Beirut as represented mainly by the [[Al-Mourabitoun]] movement. Both groups have been mainly active since the early 1950s among [[Sunni Islam|Sunni]] [[Muslim]]s and they are currently associated politically with the [[March 8 Alliance|March 8]] coalitions in Lebanese politics.

Nasserism continues to have significant resonance throughout the Arab world to this day and informs much of the public dialogue on politics in Egypt and the wider region. Prominent Nasserist [[Hamdeen Sabahi]] competed in the first round of the [[Egyptian presidential election, 2012|2012 Egyptian Presidential election]] and only narrowly avoided securing a position in the run-off against eventual winner [[Mohamed Morsi]].

== Interpretations ==
"Nasserism", the broad term used in literature to describe the aspects of Nasser's rule and his legacy, can be interpreted in many ways. Granted that there is a multitude of ways in which the term is read and used, [[P. J. Vatikiotis]] in his book ''Nasser and his Generation'' (1978)&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/464697929|title=Nasser and his generation|last=Vatikiotis|first=Panayiotis Jerasimof|date=1 January 1978|publisher=Croom Helm|year=|isbn=0856644331|location=|pages=297–299|oclc=464697929|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; argues that Nasserism had the limited political connotation of a phenomenon of "personal charismatic leadership, not to a movement or ideology". Vatikiotis elaborates upon Nasser's use of speech as a political tool to sway his constituents despite their deprivation of any participation in their leader's policies. To this end, Nasser frequently addressed masses on both radio and television as well as in huge rallies, with a "repeated hypnotic incantation of "imperialism" and "agents of imperialism", "reactionaries", "revenge", "dignity and self-respect", "[[Zionism]]" and "[[Pan-Arabism|Arabism]]". Crowds were galvanized to hysteria as Nasser excited them with hopes and aspirations of strong leadership and Arab unity.&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt;

In ''Rethinking Nasserism'' (2004),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/77585878|title=Rethinking Nasserism : revolution and historical memory in modern Egypt|last=Elie.|first=Podeh,|last2=Onn.|first2=Winckler,|date=1 January 2004|publisher=University Press of Florida|year=|isbn=9780813031378|location=|pages=|oclc=77585878}}&lt;/ref&gt; Podeh and Winckler discuss another interpretation of Nasserism. According to them, "Western social scientists in the 1950s and 1960s, perceived Nasserism as a modernization movement and Nasser as a modernizing leader…Egypt was seen as a typical Third World country undergoing a process of decolonization and, under new revolutionary leadership, aspiring to national prosperity through modernization. Thus, Nasserism was perceived as an attempt to transform Egyptian traditional society through the modernization of its economy and society".

Yet another insight into Nasserism is provided in ''Political Trends in the Fertile Crescent'' (1958) by Walid Khalidi,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Middle East in Transition|last=Laqueur|first=Walter Z.|publisher=F. A. Praeger|year=1958|isbn=|location=New York|pages=125|chapter=Political Trends in the Fertile Crescent by Walid Khalidi|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; who discusses it as not an ideological movement, rather an  "attitude of mind" that is "eclectic, empirical, radical, and yet conservative". According to Walidi, Nasserism was able to attract support in the Arab world because it "transferred, if only partially, to the Arab world itself, the center of decisions concerning the future of that world". Khalidi asserts that this change inspired self-confidence in the Arab community, which was particularly welcome after the recent shock over the loss of Palestine.

== Ideology ==
[[File:Nasser's Three Circles Theory.jpg|thumb|According to [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]]'s Three Circles Theory, the mission of the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|Egyptian Revolution]] had three spheres, namely the [[Arab world]], [[Africa]] and the [[Muslim world]]]]
Nasserism is an Arab nationalist and pan-Arabist ideology, combined with a vaguely defined socialism, often distinguished from [[Eastern Bloc]] or [[Western culture|Western]] socialist thought by the label "Arab socialism". Though opposed ideologically to Western [[capitalism]], Arab socialism also developed as a rejection of [[communism]], which was seen as incompatible with Arab traditions and the religious underpinnings of Arab society. As a consequence, Nasserists from the 1950s to the 1980s sought to prevent the rise of communism in the Arab world and advocated harsh penalties for individuals and organizations identified as attempting to spread communism within the region.

Though mindful of the [[Islam]]ic and [[Christianity|Christian]] heritage of the Arab world as with [[Ba'athism]], Nasserism is largely a secular ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sheikh|2003|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shehadi|Mills|1988|p=265}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Just as with other manifestations of Arab nationalism, this led to direct conflict with [[Islamism|Islamic-oriented]] political movements in the Arab world from the 1950s onward, particularly the [[Muslim Brotherhood]]. Nasserists espouse an end to Western interference in Arab affairs, developing world solidarity, international non-alignment, [[modernisation]] and [[industrialisation]]. Nasser himself was opposed vehemently to Western [[imperialism]], sharing the commonly held Arab view that [[Zionism]] was an extension of European [[colonialism]] on Arab soil.

In world politics, Nasser's Egypt, along with [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]] under [[Josip Broz Tito]] and [[India]] under [[Jawaharlal Nehru]], was a major proponent of the [[Non-Aligned Movement]], which advocated developing countries remaining outside the influence of the [[superpower]] blocs. However, notwithstanding this policy and government suppression of communist organisations within Egypt, Egypt's deteriorating relations with Western powers, particularly following the Tripartite Aggression of 1956, made Egypt heavily dependent on military and civil assistance from the [[Soviet Union]]. The same was true for other revolutionary Arab governments, which although repressive of communism within Arab borders, entered into strong longstanding relationships with communist states outside the Arab world. The Egyptian-Soviet alliance continued well into the presidency of Nasser's successor as president, Anwar Sadat, especially with regard to the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].

== Today ==
Nasserism remains a political force throughout the Arab world, but in a markedly different manner than in its heyday. Whereas in the 1950s and 1960s Nasserism existed as a revolutionary and dynamic movement with definite political and social goals, by the 1980s it had become a much less pronounced and distinct ideology. Today, many more Arabs are informed by Nasserism in a general sense than actually espouse its specific ideals and objectives. In terms of political organisations within Egypt itself and during the presidency of former Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak, Nasserism's scope was confined generally to writers, [[intellectual]]s and minor opposition parties. Nasserist movements were largely overshadowed by Islamic political organisations, especially the Muslim Brotherhood. This was a part of an overall trend within Egypt and the Arab world of Arab nationalism being overshadowed, and even eclipsed by political Islam. In Egypt, the [[Arab Democratic Nasserist Party|Nasserist Party]] styles itself as the successor to Nasser and his [[Arab Socialist Union (Egypt)|Arab Socialist Union]] as does its offshoot, the [[Dignity Party (Egypt)|Karama Party]] of [[Hamdeen Sabahi]]. However, as with all opposition parties in Egypt, their activities was severely limited by the Mubarak regime prior to the [[Egyptian revolution of 2011]].

Whilst Nasser governed Egypt through a strictly [[Authoritarianism|authoritarian]] [[One-party state|one-party system]], with extreme limits on any form of political dissent, present-day Nasserists stress their support for [[democracy]], explaining Nasser's autocratic excesses as necessary to implement his revolutionary policies.

== Influence outside the Arab World ==
[[File:Che_Gueava,_Sabri_and_Nasser.jpg|thumb|250px|Nasser and [[Che Guevara]] in 1966]]
Despite being a quintessentially Arab ideology, Nasserism influenced to a degree left-wing movements in other parts of the developing world, particularly [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] and [[Latin America]]. Under Nasser, the Egyptian government gave support both moral and material to Sub-Saharan liberation movements fighting European imperialism. [[Nelson Mandela]], the former [[President of South Africa|South African President]] and Leader of the [[African National Congress]], remarked that this support was crucial in helping sustain the morale of such movements, including in South Africa. Similar sentiments have been expressed by [[Fidel Castro]], the former [[President of Cuba|Cuban President]], with regard to the [[Cuban Revolution]] and Cuba's later [[Bay of Pigs Invasion|adversities with the United States Government]]. Both men stated that Egypt's resistance under Nasser against the [[Suez Crisis|joint British, French and Israeli invasion of Egypt in 1956]] proved to be inspirational for their own movements.

[[Hugo Chávez]], late President of [[Venezuela]] and leader of the self-styled [[Bolivarian Revolution]], cited Nasserism as a direct influence on his own political thinking by stating: "Someone talked to me about his pessimism regarding the future of Arab nationalism. I told him that I was optimistic, because the ideas of Nasser are still alive. Nasser was one of the greatest people of Arab history. To say the least, I am a Nasserist, ever since I was a young soldier".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip/en/1220.htm "President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez"]. MEMRI.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.memritv.org/clip_transcript/en/1220.htm "President of Venezuela Hugo Chavez: Israel Uses the Methods of Hitler, the U.S. Uses the Methods of Dracula. I'm a Nasserist who Has Crossed the Deserts, Ridden Camels, and Sung Along with the Bedouins. Al-Jazeera Plays a Role in Liberating the World"]. MEMRI. Clip No. 1220 (4 August 2006). Retrieved 16 August 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

Left-wing British politician [[George Galloway]] has referred to Gamal Abdel Nasser as "one of the greatest men of the 20th century"&lt;ref&gt;George Galloway (2005). ''I'm Not the Only One''.&lt;/ref&gt; and has called repeatedly for Arab governments to embrace the tenets of Nasserism in the 21st century.

The '''Palmer Raids''' were a series of raids conducted during the [[First Red Scare]] by the [[United States Department of Justice]] under the administration of President [[Woodrow Wilson]] to capture and arrest suspected radical [[leftist]]s, mostly [[Italians|Italian]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an [[immigrant]]s and especially [[anarchists]] and [[communist]]s, and [[deport]] them from the United States. The raids particularly targeted [[Italian diaspora|Italian immigrants]] and [[Eastern Europe]]an [[Jews in the United States|Jewish immigrants]] with suspected radical leftist ties, with particular focus on [[Anarchism in Italy|Italian anarchists]] and immigrant leftist [[labor activist]]s. The raids and arrests occurred in November 1919 and January 1920 under the leadership of Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]]. Though more than 500 foreign citizens were deported, including a number of prominent leftist leaders, Palmer's efforts were largely frustrated by officials at the [[United States Department of Labor|U.S. Department of Labor]], which had authority for deportations and objected to Palmer's methods.

The Palmer Raids occurred in the larger context of the [[First Red Scare|Red Scare]], the term given to fear of and reaction against communist radicals in the U.S. in the years immediately following [[World War I]]. There were strikes that garnered national attention, [[Red Summer (1919)|race riots]] in more than 30 cities, and [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|two sets of bombings]] in April and June 1919, including one bomb mailed to Palmer's home. The Palmer Raids preceded the [[Immigration Act of 1924]], which also targeted [[Southern Europe]]an and [[Eastern Europe]] immigrants on not just political grounds but also mostly ethnic and racial grounds.

==Background==
During the [[First World War]], there was a nationwide campaign in the United States against the real and imagined divided political loyalties of immigrants and ethnic groups, who were feared to have too much loyalty for their nations of origin. Particular targets were Germans, with sympathies for their homeland, and Irish, whose countrymen were in revolt against America's ally, the United Kingdom. In 1915, [[Woodrow Wilson|President Wilson]] warned against [[hyphenated American]]s who, he charged, had "poured the poison of disloyalty into the very arteries of our national life." "Such creatures of passion, disloyalty and anarchy", Wilson continued "must be crushed out".&lt;ref&gt;Kennedy, 24&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Russian Revolution (1917)|Russian Revolution of 1917]] added special force to fear of labor agitators and partisans of ideologies like anarchism and communism. The [[Seattle General Strike|general strike in Seattle]] in February 1919 represented a new development in labor unrest that the war had suppressed.

The fears of Wilson and other government officials were confirmed when Galleanists—Italian followers of the anarchist [[Luigi Galleani]]—carried out a series of [[1919 United States anarchist bombings|bombings in April and June 1919]].&lt;ref name="AVR"&gt;Avrich, Paul, ''[[Sacco and Vanzetti: The Anarchist Background]]'', Princeton University Press, {{ISBN|0-691-02604-1}} (1991), pp. 140-143, 147, 149-156&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of April, some 30 Galleanist [[letter bomb]]s had been mailed to a host of individuals, mostly prominent government officials and businessmen, but also law enforcement officials.&lt;ref name="AVR"/&gt;  Only a few reached their targets, and not all exploded when opened. Some people suffered injuries, including a housekeeper in Senator [[Thomas W. Hardwick]]'s residence, who had her hands blown off.&lt;ref name="AVR"/&gt;  On June 2, 1919, the second wave of bombings occurred, when several much larger package bombs were detonated by Galleanists in eight American cities, including one that damaged the home of Attorney General [[A. Mitchell Palmer]] in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref name="AVR"/&gt;  At least one person was killed in this second attack, night watchman William Boehner, and fears were raised because it occurred in the capital.&lt;ref name="AVR"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Plotter Here Hid Trail Skillfully; His Victim Was A Night Watchman", ''The New York Times,'' 4 June 1919&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Wreck Judge Nott's Home", ''The New York Times,'' 3 June 1919&lt;/ref&gt; [[Flyer (pamphlet)|Flyer]]s declaring war on capitalists in the name of anarchist principles accompanied each bomb.&lt;ref name="AVR"/&gt;

==Preparations==
{{Anarchism sidebar}}
In June 1919, Attorney General Palmer told the [[United States House Committee on Appropriations|House Appropriations Committee]] that all evidence promised that radicals would "on a certain day...rise up and destroy the government at one fell swoop." He requested an increase in his budget to $2,000,000 from $1,500,000 to support his investigations of radicals, but Congress limited the increase to $100,000.&lt;ref&gt;Hagedorn, 229-30; Coben, 211&lt;/ref&gt;

An initial raid in July 1919 against an anarchist group in [[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]], New York, achieved little when a federal judge tossed out Palmer's case. He found in the case that the three arrested radicals, charged under a law dating from the [[American Civil War|Civil War]], had proposed transforming the government by using their [[freedom of speech|free speech]] rights and not by violence.&lt;ref&gt;Pietruszka, 146-7&lt;/ref&gt; That taught Palmer that he needed to exploit the more powerful immigration statutes that authorized the deportation of [[alien (law)|alien]] anarchists, violent or not. To do that, he needed to enlist the cooperation of officials at the Department of Labor. Only the Secretary of Labor could issue warrants for the arrest of alien violators of the Immigration Acts, and only he could sign deportation orders following a hearing by an immigration inspector.&lt;ref&gt;Coben 217-8&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 1, 1919, Palmer named 24-year-old [[J. Edgar Hoover]] to head a new division of the Justice Department's [[Federal Bureau of Investigation#Beginnings: The Bureau of Investigation|Bureau of Investigation]], the [[FBI Index#General Intelligence Division|General Intelligence Division]] (GID), with responsibility for investigating the programs of radical groups and identifying their members.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 207-9&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Boston Police Strike]] in early September raised concerns about possible threats to political and social stability. On October 17, the Senate passed a unanimous resolution demanding Palmer explain what actions he had or had not taken against radical aliens and why.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 214-5&lt;/ref&gt;

At 9 pm on November 7, 1919, a date chosen because it was the second anniversary of the [[Bolshevik]] revolution, agents of the Bureau of Investigation, together with local police, executed a series of well-publicized and violent raids against the [[Union of Russian Workers]] in 12 cities. Newspaper accounts reported some were "badly beaten" during the arrests. Many later swore they were threatened and beaten during questioning. Government agents cast a wide net, bringing in some American citizens, passers-by who admitted being Russian, some not members of the Russian Workers. Others were teachers conducting night school classes in space shared with the targeted radical group. Arrests far exceeded the number of warrants. Of 650 arrested in New York City, the government managed to deport just 43.&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 219-21; Post, 28-35. Post says 11 cities.&lt;/ref&gt;

When Palmer replied to the Senate's questions of October 17, he reported that his department had amassed 60,000 names with great effort. Required by the statutes to work through the Department of Labor, they had arrested 250 dangerous radicals in the November 7 raids. He proposed a new Anti-Sedition Law to enhance his authority to prosecute anarchists.&lt;ref&gt;''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1919/11/16/archives/palmer-for-stringent-law-attorney-general-asks-Senate-for-sedition.html "Palmer for Stringent Law," November 16, 1919], accessed January 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Raids and arrests in January 1920==
[[Image: Radicals awaiting deportation.jpg|thumb|right|Men arrested in raids awaiting deportation hearings on Ellis Island, January 13, 1920]]
As Attorney General Palmer struggled with exhaustion and devoted all his energies to the [[United Mine Workers]] [[A. Mitchell Palmer#Coal strike|coal strike in November and December 1919]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Miners Finally Agree|url=https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1919/12/11/118243636.pdf|accessdate=June 11, 2014|work=New York Times|date=December 11, 1919}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoover organized the next raids. He successfully persuaded the Department of Labor to ease its insistence on promptly alerting those arrested of their right to an attorney. Instead, Labor issued instructions that its representatives could wait until after the case against the defendant was established, "in order to protect government interests."&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 222-3&lt;/ref&gt; Less openly, Hoover decided to interpret Labor’s agreement to act against the Communist Party to include a different organization, the [[Communist Labor Party of America|Communist Labor Party]]. Finally, despite the fact that Secretary of Labor [[William Bauchop Wilson|William B. Wilson]] insisted that more than membership in an organization was required for a warrant, Hoover worked with more compliant Labor officials and overwhelmed Labor staff to get the warrants he wanted. Justice Department officials, including Palmer and Hoover, later claimed ignorance of such details.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 223-7&lt;/ref&gt;

The Justice Department launched a series of raids on January 2, 1920, with follow up operations over the next few days. Smaller raids extended over the next 6 weeks. At least 3000 were arrested, and many others were held for various lengths of time. The entire enterprise replicated the November action on a larger scale, including arrests and seizures without search warrants, as well as detention in overcrowded and unsanitary holding facilities. Hoover later admitted "clear cases of brutality."&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 227-9&lt;/ref&gt; The raids covered more than 30 cities and towns in 23 states, but those west of the Mississippi and south of the Ohio were "publicity gestures" designed to make the effort appear nationwide in scope.&lt;ref&gt;States (cities where available): California ([[Los Angeles]], [[San Francisco]]), Colorado ([[Denver]]), Connecticut ([[Ansonia, Connecticut|Ansonia]], [[Bridgeport, Connecticut|Bridgeport]], [[Hartford, Connecticut|Hartford]], [[Meriden, Connecticut|Meriden]], [[New Haven, Connecticut|New Haven]], [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], [[Manchester, Connecticut|South Manchester]], [[Waterbury, Connecticut|Waterbury]]), Florida, Illinois ([[Chicago]], [[Rockford, Illinois|Rockford]], [[East St. Louis, Illinois|East St. Louis]]), Indiana, Iowa ([[Des Moines, Iowa|Des Moines]]), Kansas ([[Kansas City, Kansas|Kansas City]]), Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts ([[Boston]], [[Chelsea, Massachusetts|Chelsea]], [[Brockton, Massachusetts|Brockton]], [[Bridgewater, Massachusetts|Bridgewater]], [[Norwood, Massachusetts|Norwood]], [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Springfield, Massachusetts|Springfield]], [[Chicopee, Massachusetts|Chicopee Falls]], [[Holyoke, Massachusetts|Holyoke]], [[Gardner, Massachusetts|Gardner]], [[Fitchburg, Massachusetts|Fitchburg]], [[Lowell, Massachusetts|Lowell]], [[Lawrence, Massachusetts|Lawrence]], [[Haverhill, Massachusetts|Haverhill]]), Michigan ([[Detroit]]), Minnesota ([[Saint Paul, Minnesota|St. Paul]]), Nebraska ([[Omaha, Nebraska|Omaha]]), New Hampshire ([[Claremont, New Hampshire|Claremont]], [[Derry, New Hampshire|Derry]], [[Lincoln, New Hampshire|Lincoln]], [[Manchester, New Hampshire|Manchester]], [[Nashua, New Hampshire|Nashua]], [[Portsmouth, New Hampshire|Portsmouth]]), New Jersey ([[Camden, New Jersey|Camden]]), New York ([[Buffalo, New York|Buffalo]] and "nearby towns", [[New York City]]), Ohio ([[Cleveland]], [[Toledo, Ohio|Toledo]], [[Youngstown, Ohio|Youngstown]]), Oregon ([[Portland, Oregon|Portland]]), Pennsylvania ([[Chester, Pennsylvania|Chester]], [[Pittsburgh]]), Washington ([[Spokane, Washington|Spokane]]), Wisconsin ([[Milwaukee]], [[Racine, Wisconsin|Racine]]). Others were arrested in West Virginia by agents working from Pittsburgh. Post, 91-2, 96, 104-5, 108, 110, 115-6, 120-1, 124, 126, 131&lt;/ref&gt; Because the raids targeted entire organizations, agents arrested everyone found in organization meeting halls, not only arresting non-radical organization members but also visitors who did not belong to a target organization, and sometimes American citizens not eligible for arrest and deportation.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 96-147, ''passim''&lt;/ref&gt;

The Department of Justice at one point claimed to have taken possession of several bombs, but after a few iron balls were displayed to the press they were never mentioned again. All the raids netted a total of just four ordinary pistols.&lt;ref&gt;Post, 91-5, 96-147&lt;/ref&gt;

While most press coverages continued to be positive, with criticism only from leftist publications like ''[[The Nation]]'' and ''[[The New Republic]]'', one attorney raised the first noteworthy protest. [[Francis Fisher Kane]], the U.S. Attorney for the Eastern District of [[Pennsylvania]], resigned in protest. In his letter of resignation to the President and the Attorney General he wrote: "It seems to me that the policy of raids against large numbers of individuals is generally unwise and very apt to result in injustice. People not really guilty are likely to be arrested and railroaded through their hearings...We appear to be attempting to repress a political party...By such methods, we drive underground and make dangerous what was not dangerous before." Palmer replied that he could not use individual arrests to treat an "epidemic" and asserted his own fidelity to constitutional principles. He added: "The Government should encourage free political thinking and political action, but it certainly has the right for its own preservation to discourage and prevent the use of force and violence to accomplish that which ought to be accomplished, if at all, by parliamentary or political methods."&lt;ref&gt;Coben, 230; ''New York Times'': [https://www.nytimes.com/1920/01/24/archives/palmer-upholds-red-repression-replies-to-federal-attorney-kane-who.html "Palmer Upholds Red Repression," January 24, 1920], accessed January 15, 2010, &lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Washington Post]]'' endorsed Palmer's claim for urgency over legal process: "There is no time to waste on hairsplitting over infringement of liberties."&lt;ref&gt;''Washington Post'', "The Red Assassins," January 4, 1920&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
In a few weeks, after changes in personnel at the Department of Labor, Palmer faced a new and very independent-minded Acting Secretary of Labor in Assistant Secretary of Labor [[Louis Freeland Post]], who canceled more than 2,000 warrants as being illegal.&lt;ref name="Coben, 232"&gt;Coben, 232&lt;/ref&gt; Of the 10,000 arrested, 3,500 were held by authorities in detention; 556 resident aliens were eventually deported under the [[Immigration Act of 1918]].&lt;ref&gt;Avakov, Aleksandr Vladimirovich, ''Plato's Dreams Realized: Surveillance and Citizen Rights from KGB to FBI'', Algora Publishing, {{ISBN|0-87586-495-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-87586-495-2}} (2007), p. 36&lt;/ref&gt;

At a Cabinet meeting in April 1920, Palmer called on Secretary of Labor William B. Wilson to fire Post, but Wilson defended him. The President listened to his feuding department heads and offered no comment about Post, but he ended the meeting by telling Palmer that he should "not let this country see red." Secretary of the Navy [[Josephus Daniels]], who made notes of the conversation, thought the Attorney General had merited the President's "admonition", because Palmer "was seeing red behind every bush and every demand for an increase in wages."&lt;ref&gt;Daniels, 545-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer's supporters in Congress responded with an attempt to [[impeachment|impeach]] Louis Post or, failing that, to censure him. The drive against Post began to lose energy when Attorney General Palmer’s forecast of an attempted radical uprising on [[May Day]] 1920 failed to occur. Then, in testimony before the House Rules Committee on May 7–8, Post proved "a convincing speaker with a caustic tongue"&lt;ref name="Coben, 232"/&gt; and defended himself so successfully that Congressman [[Edward W. Pou]], a Democrat presumed to be an enthusiastic supporter of Palmer, congratulated him: "I feel that you have followed your sense of duty absolutely."&lt;ref&gt;Post, 273&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 28, 1920, the nascent [[American Civil Liberties Union]] (ACLU) published its ''Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=National Popular Government League|title=Report Upon the Illegal Practices of the United States Department of Justice| date=1920|url=https://archive.org/details/toamericanpeople00natiuoft}}&lt;/ref&gt; which carefully documented unlawful activities in arresting suspected radicals, illegal entrapment by [[agent provocateur|''agents provocateur'']], and unlawful incommunicado detention. Such prominent lawyers and law professors as [[Felix Frankfurter]], [[Roscoe Pound]] and [[Ernst Freund]] signed it. Harvard Professor [[Zechariah Chafee]] criticized the raids and attempts at deportations and the lack of legal process in his 1920 volume ''Freedom of Speech''. He wrote: "That a [[Quaker]] should employ prison and exile to counteract evil-thinking is one of the saddest ironies of our time."&lt;ref&gt;Chafee, 197, ch. 5 "Deportations"&lt;/ref&gt;
The Rules Committee gave Palmer a hearing in June, where he attacked Post and other critics whose "tender solicitude for social revolution and perverted sympathy for the criminal anarchists...set at large among the people the very public enemies whom it was the desire and intention of the Congress to be rid of." The press saw the dispute as evidence of the Wilson administration's ineffectiveness and division as it approached its final months.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, 255-6&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1920, a decision by Massachusetts District Court Judge [[George Weston Anderson|George Anderson]] ordered the discharge of 17 arrested aliens and denounced the Department of Justice's actions. He wrote that "a mob is a mob, whether made up of Government officials acting under instructions from the Department of Justice, or of criminals and loafers and the vicious classes." His decision effectively prevented any renewal of the raids.&lt;ref&gt;Murray,  250-1; Post, 97&lt;/ref&gt;

Palmer, once seen as a likely [[President of the United States|presidential]] candidate, lost his bid to win the [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] nomination for president later in the year.&lt;ref&gt;Pietrusza, 257&lt;/ref&gt; The anarchist bombing campaign continued intermittently for another twelve years.&lt;ref&gt;Avrich, 213&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Preta Maria Gadelha Gil Moreira''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈpɾetɐ maˈɾiɐ ɡaˈdeʎɐ ˈʒiw moˈɾejrɐ}}) (born August 8, 1974), known as '''Preta Gil''' ({{IPA-pt|ˈpɾetɐ ˈʒiw}}), is a Brazilian singer and actress. She is the daughter of [[Gilberto Gil]], a famous musician and former [[Government minister|Minister]] of [[Ministry of Culture (Brazil)|Culture]] in Brazil.

==Biography==
In 1974, Preta Gil's father, the famous singer [[Gilberto Gil]], went to a government office to register his daughter's name after his own mother's name. Upon arrival, the clerk informed him he was unable to register ''Preta'' as a name for his daughter. [[Gilberto Gil]] began to protest, ''"Why not? There's Branca (White), Clara (Clear) and Rosa (Rose) . . . why can't Preta (Black) be a name?"''. The clerk conceded, only if the child was registered along with a Catholic name. So ''Preta Gil'' was registered "Preta Maria".

''Preta'' lived in [[Rio de Janeiro|Rio]], and at the age of one, she moved to [[Salvador, Bahia|Salvador]]. Her mother, Sandra, soon after had another daughter named "Maria". Gil always believed it was lack of creativity. She had an older brother, "Pedro", who was born in London, at the time of her father's famous exile from Brazil during the Military Dictatorship, along with friend and singer [[Caetano Veloso|Caetano]]. 

Sandra's mother, was also the mother of Andréa Gadelha, known as Dedé wife of [[Caetano Veloso|Caetano]]. In the situation faced, she believed her two daughters married crazy men. Gilberto Gil and Veloso were both exiled, went to live in London, and Preta's grandmother was left to raise the children. Preta has great admiration for her grandmother, who stood firm in a chaotic time in the family's life.

Since childhood she has had a very vivid imagination. She once had an imaginary puppy, when she was five. When her father was making a record in Los Angeles with [[Sergio Mendes]], the family moved to California, where they lived for eight months. Preta's mother joked, calling the airplane that took them to L.A. as a slave ship, since she and the children were all black. Petra's siblings, Maria and Pedro, both had curly hair. ''Preta'' has straight hair. [[Caetano Veloso|Caetano]] used to call her Filipina.

She was in [[Rio de Janeiro]] at the height of the 1980s. Bombando, [[Blitz (Brazilian band)|Blitz]], [[Paralamas do Sucesso|Paralamas]], Barão Vermelho, [[Lulu Santos]]. The Brazilian music scene in the 1980s was something very striking. As a daughter of one of Brazil's music icons, Preta had backstage access to the craziness that made up that scene. ''"It all made me crazy, loved this environment, I felt comfortable. The stage was one thing that attracted me a lot."''.

She wanted to be "Chacrete" (the famous TV show of Chacrinha) and every Saturday in the theater Fenix, the Botanical Garden. Preta's father, at that time, exploded in the charts, along with her uncle Veloso, and her godmother [[Gal Costa]], who always went to the show Chacrinha. Preta would always beg her mother to ask her father, her uncle and even her godmother, who always went, to attend the tapings of the show. And one day, she was permitted to attend. She went into her uncle Caetano's dressing room, saw all the costumes, instruments and thought he was the male version of [[Carmen Miranda]]. When the taping began, she was in a corner and watched the magic happen. She loved Elke Maravilha a constant fixture in the show. That was the environment of the 1980s, effervescent, colorful, and full of life. This was when she also decided to be a singer and an actress. She would imitate her godmother, Gal Costa, as well as other reputable and talented singers and actresses like [[Rita Lee]] and [[Elba Ramalho]], whom she loved and attended all her concerts.

==Career==
===2003–2004: ''The First CD "Prêt-à-Porter" and Controversy 'Naked' and Raw''===
The first studio album ''Preta Gil'', entitled "Prêt-à Porter" was released in 2003. ''Preta'' took nude pictures for the cover and the booklet of the CD. The idea was for the singer, in particular, to feel reborn with that her first job, and how we are born naked, then declined as well.

When you finish the pictures, showed them the label. But soon it was alerted and asked if she was sure that, if you thought it would not cause any 'scandal'. Innocently, ''Preta'' said that since she had to include other singers on the disc, singers who were also naked on the covers of their CDs, and would not be a 'chest out' that would cause a controversy.

From there, the same time, ''Preta'' did an interview for Trippe. But like all media thought that ''Preta'' was in the clearance of wanting to spur, called her to make a sensual. ''Preta'', very relaxed, loved it, because it has always been a dream of mine to do [[Playboy Brazil|Playboy]].

But ''Preta'' reveals that when she read the magazine of her interview, it was not exactly what she had said, because they had many questions to which her answers would be misunderstood and made her look bad. The interview came out in magazine with the release of her controversial CD, so it would have been another reason for the media to think that she was willing to appear.

In a TV interview just, GNT, the program Annoying "Fernanda Young", ''Preta Gil'' says, like fun and relaxed for the presenter, that if she were thin, with all certainty that fuss would not have happened.

===2005–2010: ''The second CD "Preta", the tour "Noite Preta" and first DVD/Blu-ray/CD Live''===
The Preta Gil's second studio album, entitled ''Preta'', was released in September 2005. The CD contained two songs, "Very Dangerous" and "You and Mene, You and Me", both released in 2005.

In 2008, ''Preta'' debuted her new tour, called "Noite Preta", where on October 20, 2009 recorded her first live DVD/[[Blu-ray]], scheduled for release on July 17, 2010.

"I'm thinking about launching an extra DVD with only the prohibited. In my day to day, I'm very different from the "Preta Gil character, "one that people know the stage. Say the Preta woman from the stage is a more liberal without locks on the tongue, foul mouth like that," Preta told the ''EGO''.

Waiting for the [[2010 FIFA World Cup]] through the pre-release first live DVD/Blu-ray of ''Preta Gil'' was on July 17, 2010, in "Scala Rio," with a big party.

With the packed house at "The Week Rio", and an audience of about three thousand people, Gil celebrated the anniversary of her show and pre-release of his DVD/[[Blu-ray]] which hits stores in August: "It's eight-year career and three of them working on this show. Today I am an artist mature and aware enough of my segment. I have a wonderful staff and very nice experience every minute with this whole situation," Preta told the ''EGO'' during a conversation in the dressing room.

===2013–present: ''10 Years Career &amp; Recording their 2nd DVD/Blu-ray Live''===
Preta Gil celebrated 10 years of career with burning the DVD/[[Blu-ray]], ''[[:pt:Bloco da Preta|Bloco da Preta]]'', which took place on the evening of Wednesday, October 23, 2013, at "Citibank Hall" in [[Rio de Janeiro]]. With a mix of Brazilian rhythms ranging from pop to swing, passing through funk, axé, pagode and samba, the show had the participation of Lulu, [[Ivete Sangalo]], [[Anitta (singer)|Anitta]], Israel and Thiago Novaes and had three hours of duração. Some songs had to be repeated due to the raspy voice of singer and errors in some letters. Master Pablo in front of the battery "Black Power" with 10 drummers and dancers on stage gave a special glow to the show .

''"Every singer dreams about it, with this mega production. I am very happy"'' said Preta, who despite having taken a physical therapist did not care about the knee problem, jumped high heels and used during the presentation said. ''" Only now can"''

During Carnival 2014, [[South Korea]]n singer, [[Psy]], will sing alongside the Preta Gil, also, besides singing alongside [[Claudia Leitte]] integrates the programming of "Varanda Elétrica" the cabin "Expresso 2222".

Your street block in the Marvelous City, the "Bloco da Preta" (Preta's Block), is the third largest in the [[Rio de Janeiro]] and has already reached concentrate to 2.5 million people in the streets. To account for so much work, the singer is staffed by a team of diverse professionals. ''"Before he was afraid of wardrobe, shoe, every detail. Caused me pain Everything. Had remedy, analgesic and ice packs waiting for me at the exit of each show. Had two knee injuries in 2010 and 2012 carnivals. Today learned to delegate responsibility and caring for me. I osteopath, physiotherapist, Rodrigo (groom) as personal , speech therapist. useless But not so many people taking care of me if I did not care for it myself"'', she says, who claims not to leave more heavy routine interfere with your health.

The [[United States Interests Section in Havana]], although it was staffed by personnel of the [[United States Foreign Service]], was formally a section of the Embassy of Switzerland.&lt;ref name=LT2015&gt;{{fr}} Stéphane Bussard, "[http://www.letemps.ch/monde/2015/07/19/voix-suisse-etats-unis-cuba-se-tait La voix suisse des États-Unis à Cuba se tait]", ''[[Le Temps]]'', Monday 20 July 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

A '''protecting power''' is a country that represents another [[sovereign state]] in a country where it lacks its own [[diplomatic mission|diplomatic representation]]. It is common for protecting powers to be appointed when two countries break off diplomatic relations with each other. The protecting power is responsible for looking after the sending state's diplomatic property and citizens in the hosting state. If diplomatic relations were broken by the outbreak of war, the protecting power will also inquire into the welfare of [[prisoners of war]] and look after the interests of civilians in enemy-occupied territory.

The institution of protecting power dates back to the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870 and was formalized in the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention of 1929]]. Protecting powers are authorized in all four of the [[Geneva Conventions]] of 1949. In addition, the International Red Cross may itself be appointed a protecting power under [[Protocol I]] (1977). The practice of selecting a protecting power in time of peace was formalized in the [[Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations]] (1961).&lt;ref name="vienna_convention"&gt;{{cite web|title=Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations|url=http://legal.un.org/ilc/texts/instruments/english/conventions/9_1_1961.pdf|publisher=United Nations|date=18 April 1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=fam1020&gt;{{cite book|title=U.S. Department of State Foreign Affairs Manual|location=7 FAM 1020|url=https://fam.state.gov/FAM/07FAM/07FAM1020.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Diplomacy==

[[File:Embassy of Switzerland, Washington, D.C..jpg|thumb|Between 1991 and 2015, the Swiss Embassy in Washington DC also officially represented [[Cuban Interests Section|Cuba's interests]] in the United States.&lt;ref name=LT2015/&gt;]]

The protecting power is appointed by the sending state and must also be acceptable to the host state. It must therefore maintain diplomatic relations with both states. In time of war, the [[Geneva Conventions]] also require the protecting power to be a neutral country. The specific responsibilities and arrangements are agreed between the protecting power, the sending state, and the host country.

In a comprehensive mandate, the protecting power carries out most diplomatic functions on behalf of the protected state. This is necessary when relations are so hostile that the sparring nations have no diplomatic or consular staff posted on each other's territory. For example, Sweden carries out limited consular functions for the United States, Canada, and Australia in North Korea.&lt;ref name="SwedenProtecting"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swedenabroad.com/en-GB/Embassies/Pyongyang/About-us/About-the-Embassy/|title=About the Embassy|publisher=Embassy of Sweden, Pyongyang|quote=In particular, Sweden functions as Protective Power for the United States, Australia and Canada, including consular responsibility for citizens.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In other cases, the two nations have broken diplomatic relations, but are nevertheless willing to exchange personnel on an informal basis. The protecting power serves as the mechanism for facilitating this exchange. The embassy of the protected state is staffed by its own diplomatic personnel, but it is formally termed an "interests section" of the protecting power. Between 1991 and 2015, the [[Cuban Interests Section]] was staffed by Cubans and occupied the old Cuban embassy in Washington, D.C., but it was formally a section of the Swiss Embassy to the United States.

There is no requirement that the same protecting power be selected by both countries, although this is convenient for the purposes of communication. Each may appoint a different protecting power, provided that the choice is acceptable to the other state. There is also no requirement that a country select only one protecting power in the receiving country. During the [[Second World War]], Japan appointed Spain, Sweden and Switzerland to be its protecting powers in the United States.&lt;ref name=levie/&gt;

== Current mandates ==

&lt;!-- This section should list only current mandates. Do not add a section for historical protecting power mandates, as it would turn into a list of belligerents in almost every war since 1870. It would be better to mention the protecting power in the Wikipedia article on that topic. For example, it would be appropriate to mention that Switzerland was the protecting power in the article on US-Cuban relations. --&gt;

==History==

&lt;!-- This section should be reserved for important developments in the institution of protecting power. We do not want this to turn into a list of every pair of belligerents in every war fought since 1870. --&gt;

=== Origins ===

Although protecting powers have existed in diplomatic usage since the 16th century, the modern institution of protecting power originated in the [[Franco-Prussian War]] of 1870–1871.&lt;ref name="levie"/&gt;&lt;ref name="clapham2015"&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last=Clapham |editor1-first=Andrew |editor2-last=Gaeta |editor2-first=Paola |editor3-last=Sassòli |editor3-first=Marco |title=The 1949 Geneva Conventions: A Commentary |date=2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191003523}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|550}} All of the belligerents appointed protecting powers, necessitated by the expulsion of diplomats and placing of restrictions on enemy aliens.&lt;ref name=levie&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Levie|first1=Howard|title=Prisoners of War and the Protecting Power|journal=American Journal of International Law|volume=55|year=1961|url=https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/3264c3d1-de9f-4e0f-b634-cc2adbc88692/Prisoners-of-War-and-the-Protecting-Power.aspx|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140714123909/https://www.usnwc.edu/getattachment/3264c3d1-de9f-4e0f-b634-cc2adbc88692/Prisoners-of-War-and-the-Protecting-Power.aspx|archivedate=2014-07-14|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The United States acted as protecting power for the [[North German Confederation]] and several of the smaller German states, while Switzerland was the protecting power for [[Grand Duchy of Baden|Baden]] and [[Kingdom of Bavaria|Bavaria]], and Russia for [[Kingdom of Württemberg|Württemberg]].&lt;ref name="washburne_memoirs_1"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Washburne|first1=E. B.|title=Recollections of a Minister to France, Volume I|date=1887|publisher=Scribner|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the United Kingdom served as the protecting power for France.

The energetic efforts of [[Elihu B. Washburne]], the [[United States Minister to France]], set a precedent for the actions of protecting powers in war.&lt;ref name="berridge2012"/&gt; The American flag was raised over the North German Embassy, and the embassy archives were transferred to the U.S. [[legation]] for safekeeping. Washburne arranged for the evacuation of 30,000 North German subjects from France in the opening days of the war. As the only chief of mission from a major power to remain in the French capital during the [[Siege of Paris (1870–71)|Siege of Paris]], he was also charged with the protection of seven Latin American consulates and was responsible for feeding 3,000 German civilians who were stuck in the city.&lt;ref name="washburne_memoirs_1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="hill2012"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Hill|editor1-first=Michael|title=Elihu Washburne: the Diary and Letters of America's Minister to France during the Siege and Commune of Paris|date=2012|publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster|location=New York|isbn=9781451665307}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Early developments ===
After the Franco-Prussian War, the appointment of protecting powers became [[customary international law]]. In subsequent wars, the protecting powers expanded their duties with the consent of the belligerents. In the [[First Sino-Japanese War]], both sides selected the United States as their protecting power, establishing the concept of a reciprocal mandate. During the [[Spanish–American War]], the United States requested neutral inspection of [[prisoner of war]] camps for the first time.&lt;ref name="levie" /&gt;

Since the institution of protecting power had not been formalized by treaty, disputes arose over the protecting power's rights and responsibilities. In the [[Second Boer War]], the British Empire selected the United States to be its protecting power, but the Boers refused to allow the U.S. to transmit funds from the British government to prisoners of war. The Netherlands, acting as the protecting power for the Boer Republics, was also unable to secure an agreement to exchange the names of prisoners of war. Two years later during the [[Russo-Japanese War]], the belligerents agreed to exchange lists of prisoners, communicating through France as the protecting power for Russia, and the United States as the protecting power for Japan. The practice of swapping prisoner lists became customary and was eventually included in the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention of 1929]].&lt;ref name="blake1990"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Blake|first=James J.|title=Pragmatic Diplomacy: The Origins and Use of the Protecting Power|editor-last=Newsom|editor-first=David D.|encyclopedia=Diplomacy Under a Foreign Flag: When Nations Break Relations|date=1990|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0312040512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== World Wars ===

The United States was initially a popular choice for protecting power, going back to its protection of the North German Confederation during the Franco-Prussian War. The pinnacle of American diplomatic protection came during [[World War I]], when the United States accepted reciprocal mandates from five of the largest belligerents on both sides: Britain, France, Austria-Hungary, Germany, and the Ottoman Empire. Between 1914 and 1917, the United States accepted a total of 54 mandates as protecting power.&lt;ref name="newsom1990_a"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Appendix A: The United States as a Protecting Power, by Country and Date|editor-last=Newsom|editor-first=David D.|encyclopedia=Diplomacy Under a Foreign Flag: When Nations Break Relations|date=1990|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0312040512}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the United States entered the war on the Allied side in 1917, the American mandates were transferred to smaller neutrals, with the Netherlands, Spain, and Switzerland being popular choices.

In the [[interwar period]], the role of a protecting power was finally formalized in the [[Geneva Convention (1929)|Geneva Convention of 1929]]. Protecting powers were allowed to inspect prisoner of war camps, interview prisoners in private, communicate freely with prisoners, and supply books for the prison library. However, a suggestion by the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]] that it be made responsible for ensuring compliance with the treaty was rejected.&lt;ref name="levie"/&gt;

The United States remained a popular choice at the start of World War II, accepting 75 mandates on behalf of Allied countries between 1939 and 1941. However, the United States was no longer seen as a disinterested neutral, and none of the Axis countries asked the United States to be its protecting power.&lt;ref name="newsom1990_a"/&gt; The greater scope of the war also disqualified two of the most popular protecting powers of the First World War: [[Francoist Spain]] remained neutral but was Axis-leaning, and the Netherlands were [[History of the Netherlands (1939–1945)#German occupation|occupied by Germany]]. As a result, [[Switzerland]] and [[Sweden]] became the most popular choices for protecting power. Switzerland formally undertook 219 mandates for 35 states, and represented another eight states unofficially, while Sweden accepted 114 mandates for 28 states.&lt;ref name=schelbert&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last1=Schelbert |first1=Leo |article=Good offices |title=Historical Dictionary of Switzerland |year=2014 |publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield |isbn=9781442233522 |page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Geneva Conventions]] of 1949 addressed the abuses that had taken place during World War II. The appointment of a protecting power had been optional in the 1929 Convention, but the 1949 Convention made it obligatory.&lt;ref name="clapham2015"/&gt;{{rp|550}} All four of the Conventions refer to protecting powers, and the Fourth Geneva Convention formalized the role of protecting powers toward civilians. The detaining power was also required to appoint a substitute whenever the benefit of a protecting power was lost. 70% of prisoners of war had lost their protecting power in World War II because their governments were disputed or had ceased to exist. Anticipating a war in which every country was a belligerent, the Conventions provide the option of appointing an international organization as protecting power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Commentary of 2016, Article 10: Substitutes for Protecting Powers, Convention (I) for the Amelioration of the Condition of the Wounded and Sick in Armed Forces in the Field. Geneva, 12 August 1949 |url=https://ihl-databases.icrc.org/applic/ihl/ihl.nsf/Comment.xsp?action=openDocument&amp;documentId=85D4222674253FAAC1257F7D0035A6C7 |website=Historical Treaties and Documents |publisher=International Committee of the Red Cross |date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Cold War ===

The superpower rivalry of the [[Cold War]] led to changes in the institution of protecting power. The United States, which had accepted over 200 mandates as protecting power before 1945, was no longer seen as a disinterested third party and managed to secure only one mandate after 1945.&lt;ref name="newsom1990_a"/&gt; Instead, the United States had to appoint a protecting power to represent its interests over a dozen times since 1945.&lt;ref name="newsom1990_b"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|title=Appendix B: Protecting Powers That Have Represented the United States, by Country and Date|editor-last=Newsom|editor-first=David D.|encyclopedia=Diplomacy Under a Foreign Flag: When Nations Break Relations|date=1990|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0312040512}}&lt;/ref&gt; Switzerland and Sweden both chose to remain non-aligned in the Cold War and refused to join any military alliances, leading to their continued popularity as protecting powers. Since 1945, Switzerland has held as many as 24 simultaneous mandates as protecting power.&lt;ref name="ch"/&gt;

The interests section was born in the aftermath of [[Rhodesia's Unilateral Declaration of Independence]] in 1965, when nine African countries broke off diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom. The protecting power for the United Kingdom notified the receiving governments that British diplomats were members of the protecting power's own embassy. As a result, the British diplomats retained their [[diplomatic immunity]] and could stay in the former British embassy, which had been placed into the charge of the protecting power.&lt;ref name="satow6th"&gt;{{cite book|editor-last=Roberts|editor-first=Ivor|title=Satow's Diplomatic Practice|date=2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=9780198739104|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The innovation was widely adopted after the [[Six-Day War]] of 1967. The Arab states allowed American diplomats to remain in their capitals as the ''U.S. Interests Section'' of the respective protecting power, while Israel allowed Soviet diplomats to [[List of diplomatic missions in Israel|remain in Tel Aviv]] as the ''Soviet Interests Section'' of the Finnish Embassy.&lt;ref name="bergus1990"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Bergus|first=Donald C.|title=U.S. Diplomacy under the Flag of Spain, Cairo, 1967-74|editor-last=Newsom|editor-first=David D.|encyclopedia=Diplomacy Under a Foreign Flag: When Nations Break Relations|date=1990|publisher=St. Martin's Press|location=New York|isbn=0312040512}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The fiercest proxy wars of the Cold War were civil wars, including the [[Vietnam War]]. Because the principal belligerents each claimed to be the country's sole legitimate government, they did not recognize each other and refused to maintain diplomatic relations with any countries that recognized the other side. This difficulty was resolved by [[Protocol I]] (1977) to the [[Geneva Conventions]], which stipulated that the belligerents should nominate protecting powers to the [[International Committee of the Red Cross]]. The Red Cross would then approach any countries that appeared on both lists, without the belligerents having to communicate with each other directly. If no arrangement could be made with a third country, then the belligerents had to accept the Red Cross or another international organization to act as the protecting power.&lt;ref name="berridge2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Berridge|first1=Geoff R.|title=Embassies in Armed Conflict|date=2012|publisher=Continuum|location=New York|isbn=9781441104625}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Other meanings ==

* Historically a protecting power held a permanent [[protectorate]] over a weaker state, which in practice could constitute a form of colonial domination, in the logic of [[indirect rule]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}}
* The term "friendly protection" also applied to "guarantor" state(s) vowing to prevent the protected state (or a specific part) being overrun by a third party.

=== Consular services ===

Certain countries may have agreements to provide limited consular services to the citizens of other countries. This does not necessarily constitute a protecting power relationship, as the host country may not have formally agreed, and there may in fact be diplomatic relations between the host country and the third country, but no physical representation. Without the agreement of the host country, [[consular officials]] in this role may not be recognized as representing the interests of another, and be limited to a "good offices"{{Citation needed|date=September 2010}} role.

* The United States provides consular services to citizens of the [[Federated States of Micronesia]], the Republic of the [[Marshall Islands]] and the Republic of [[Palau]], which had been part of a US [[Trust Territory]].{{citation needed|date=May 2014}}
* Certain Commonwealth countries, including Australia, New Zealand, Canada and the United Kingdom, have agreements in certain countries to provide consular services for citizens of the other countries where they do not have physical representation. The United Kingdom provides consular assistance to Canadians abroad where there is no Canadian mission, as stated in each Canadian passport. Under the [[Canada–Australia Consular Services Sharing Agreement]] Canada provides consular assistance to Australian citizens to several states in Latin America and Africa; while [[Australian diplomatic missions]] reciprocate in several Asia-Pacific states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Embassies and consulates |url=http://travel.gc.ca/assistance/embassies |publisher=Government of Canada |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our embassies and consulates overseas |url=http://www.dfat.gov.au/missions/ |website=Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade |publisher=Australian Government |language=en-us}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DFAT Australia http://www.dfat.gov.au/missions/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Under Article 20 section 2c of the [[Treaty on the functioning of the European Union]] citizens of [[European Union]] countries may request consular services at the missions of other EU countries when their home country does not have a mission locally.&lt;ref name="TFEU consolidated"&gt;[http://eur-lex.europa.eu/LexUriServ/LexUriServ.do?uri=OJ:C:2008:115:0047:0199:EN:PDF Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union], Europa&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2006, the governments of Montenegro and Serbia adopted the Memorandum of Agreement between the Republic of Montenegro and the Republic of Serbia on Consular Protection and Services to the Citizens of Montenegro. By this agreement, [[Serbia]], through its network of diplomatic and consular [[Serbian diplomatic missions|missions]], provides consular services to the Montenegrin citizens on the territory of states in which Montenegro has no missions of its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mip.gov.me/en/index.php/Bilateral-Relations/republic-of-serbia.html |title=Bilateral Relations, The Republic of Serbia |website=Montenegro Ministry of Foreign Affairs and European Integration |accessdate=2012-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120605062140/http://www.mip.gov.me/en/index.php/Bilateral-Relations/republic-of-serbia.html |archivedate=2012-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
It is named after [[Ramon Magsaysay]], the [[List of Presidents of the Philippines|third]] President of the Philippines. The Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation gives the prize to [[Asia]]n individuals achieving excellence in their respective fields. The awards were given in six categories, five of which were discontinued in 2009:
* Government Service (1958&amp;ndash;2008)
* Public Service (1958&amp;ndash;2008)
* Community Leadership (1958&amp;ndash;2008)
* Journalism, Literature, and Creative Communication Arts (1958&amp;ndash;2008)
* Peace and International Understanding (1958&amp;ndash;2008)
* Emergent Leadership (2001&amp;ndash; )
* ''Uncategorized'' (2009&amp;ndash; )

==History==
In May 1957, seven prominent Filipinos were named to the founding board of trustees of the Ramon Magsaysay Award Foundation, the non-profit corporation tasked with implementing the awards program. Later on, the board of trustees diversified and included prominent Asians from all over the Asian continent and outlying islands.

The RMAF recognizes and honors individuals and organizations in [[Asia]] regardless of race, creed, sex, or nationality, who have achieved distinction in their respective fields and have helped others generously without anticipating public recognition.  The awards have traditionally been given in five categories: government service; public service; community leadership; journalism, literature, and creative communication arts; and peace and international understanding.

== Awardees ==
{{Main list|List of Ramon Magsaysay Award winners}}

The winners of the Ramon Magsaysay Awards come from different parts of Asia, although there are some instances where the winners came from countries outside Asia who had served, worked or accomplished something in different Asian countries. As of 2016, recipients have come from twenty-two Asian countries.

'''''Rome and Jerusalem: The Last National Question''''' ({{lang-de|Rom und Jerusalem, die Letzte Nationalitätsfrage}}) is a book published by [[Moses Hess]] in 1862 in [[Leipzig]]. It gave impetus to the [[Labor Zionism]] movement. In his ''[[Masterpiece|magnum opus]]'', Hess argued for the [[Jew]]s to return to [[Palestine_(region)|Palestine]], and proposed a [[socialist]] country in which the Jews would become [[agrarianism|agrarianised]] through a process of "redemption of the soil". 

==Importance==
{{further|Jewish Question|National Question}}
The book was the [[Proto-Zionism|first Zionist]] writing to put the question of [[Jewish nationalism]] in the context of European [[nationalism]]. 

Hess blended [[Jewish secularism|secular]] as well as [[Jewish philosophy|religious philosophy]], [[Hegel]]ian [[dialectics]], [[Spinoza]]'s [[pantheism]] and [[Marxism]].&lt;ref name=ZOW&gt;Moses Hess, Rome and Jerusalem. 1862, Introduction by Ami Isserov.&lt;/ref&gt;

It was written against the background of [[History of the Jews in Germany|German Jewish]] [[Jewish assimilation|assimilation]]ism, German [[antisemitism]] and German antipathy to nationalism arising in other countries. Hess used terminology of the day, such as the term "race", but he was an [[egalitarian]] who believed in the principles of the [[French Revolution]], and wanted to apply the progressive concepts of his day to the Jewish people.&lt;ref name=ZOW/&gt;

==Major themes==

Written in the form of twelve letters addressed to a woman in her grief at the loss of a relative. 
In his work, Hess put forward the following ideas:&lt;ref name=JE&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/view.jsp?artid=681&amp;letter=H "Rom und Jerusalem."] by Isidore Singer, Max Schloessinger in the [[Jewish Encyclopedia]], 1906 Ed.&lt;/ref&gt;
# The Jews will always remain strangers among the European peoples, who may [[Jewish emancipation|emancipate them]] for reasons of humanity and justice, but will never respect them so long as the Jews place their own great national memories in the background and hold to the principle, "Ubi bene, ibi patria." ([[Latin language]]: "where [it is] well, there [is] the fatherland")
# The Jewish type is indestructible, and Jewish national feeling can not be uprooted, although the German Jews, for the sake of a wider and more general emancipation, persuade themselves and others to the contrary. 
# If the emancipation of the Jews is irreconcilable with Jewish nationality, the Jews must sacrifice emancipation to nationality. Hess considers that the only solution of the Jewish question lies in the returning to Palestine.

==Reactions and legacy==

At the time the book was met with a cold reception, and only in retrospect it became one of the basic works of Zionism, as it prefigured ideas laid out in ''[[Der Judenstaat]]'' by [[Theodor Herzl]] by some 35 years.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2359">Many organizations have used [[sticker]]s to publicize their philosophy or cause. The [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), which during its colorful history has [[Industrial Workers of the World philosophy and tactics|pioneered a variety of creative tactics]], calls its stickers '''silent agitators''', or '''silent organizers'''. Professor [[Eric Margolis (sociologist)|Eric Margolis]] has written about the history of such media,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Wobbly organizers were revolutionary fish swimming in the sea of [[bindle]] stiffs and [[Hobo|tramp]] workers. The Wobbly card was a ticket to ride the rails. "Side door coaches," as box cars were called, were plastered with paper stickers, "silent organizers," that Wobs put up everywhere they passed: "Join the One Big Union," "I Will Win," "Win a World." &lt;ref&gt;Slaughter in Serene: the Columbine Coal Strike Reader, 2005, Prof. [[Eric Margolis (sociologist)|Eric Margolis]], pp. 28.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Silent agitators were produced by the millions.&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, by William D. Haywood, pp. 282.&lt;/ref&gt; Professor Margolis described the way such stickers were used when the Wobblies [[Columbine Mine massacre|called a strike]] in 1927:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Bill Lloyd, Superintendent at the Puritan Mine (in [[Colorado]]'s northern coal field), went to work one chilly Autumn morning to discover Wobbly stickers pasted on every timber and cross beam in the place: "Join the Wobblies, Join the Wobblies," he said indignantly, "From the bottom of the shaft clear to the working faces, see, they had these posters."&lt;ref&gt;Slaughter in Serene: the Columbine Coal Strike Reader, 2005, Prof. Eric Margolis, pp. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
[[Bill Haywood|Big Bill Haywood]] described in his autobiography how the IWW issued stickers to propagandize against [[World War I|the war]]. The stickers declared, "Don't be a soldier, be a man. Join the I.W.W. and fight on the job for yourself and [[Working class|your class]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Autobiography of Big Bill Haywood, 1929, by William D. Haywood, pp. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Sporting Shooters' Association of Australia''' (SSAA) was established in 1948{{cn|date=December 2017}} to promote the [[shooting sports]] and protect [[Right to keep and bear arms|firearm owners' interests]] in [[Australia]]. The SSAA currently claims a membership of over 186,000,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hunt|first1=Peter|title=Shooting among Australia’s fastest-growing sports thanks to women, tradies|url=https://www.weeklytimesnow.com.au/news/national/shooting-among-australias-fastestgrowing-sports-thanks-to-women-tradies/news-story/9cb0cb306b160ff557a86afa22d94654|accessdate=14 February 2018|work=SHOOTING has become one of Australia’s fastest growing sports, attracting women and tradies in record numbers.|publisher=News Corp|date=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; making it the largest body representing licensed firearm owners in Australia,{{cn|date=December 2017}} with interests covering all aspects of recreational shooting and hunting, including firearms collecting and youth education. The SSAA also participates in the ongoing [[Gun laws in Australia|debates on government firearms policies]].

==Structure==
The SSAA is organised at the bottom level as local sporting clubs, around locations and/or speciality shooting disciplines or conservation activities. Members may be unaffiliated with a club, or members of one or more clubs. {{cn|date=December 2017}} Clubs are organised in branches, where each club sends two voting delegates to the branch AGM. A state may have one or more branches according to the population and size of membership. State level executive teams deal with state level sporting management and legislative issues, and elect the SSAA National Executive Board. SSAA states it is independent of any political party and supports politicians who support recreational shooting and hunting while condemning those that work against its members' interests.

==Activities==
The SSAA at the club and branch level has many thousands of volunteers and officials running competitions and managing facilities of their clubs for all levels of competition. The SSAA manages more than 16 handgun, rifle and shotgun shooting competitions at the local, state, national and international levels, as well as having several branches devoted to historic and collectible firearms. {{cn|date=December 2017}}

The SSAA also comprises an insurance arm, SSAA Insurance Brokers Pty Ltd, which provides general insurance for the majority of major shooting organisations within Australia, as well as public liability insurance for SSAA members while shooting or hunting.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Publications==
The SSAA publishes a range of publications, including the monthly ''[[Australian Shooter]]'', quarterly ''Australian Hunter'', annual ''[[Australian &amp; New Zealand Handgun]]'', biannual ''The Junior Shooter'', ''SSAA's Comprehensive Guide to Shooting &amp; Hunting in Australia'', ''Shooting and the SSAA - A Beginner's Guide'', ''A Journalist's Guide to Firearms and the Shooting Sports'', ''ASJ: The political voice of the SSAA'', the ''SSAA National E-newsletter'', ''Field to Fork - The Australian Game Cookbook'', and more.

==Revenue==
The national branch of the SSAA collects $10 million in annual fees.&lt;ref&gt;https://croakey.org/how-john-howards-gun-control-laws-have-given-a-multi-million-boost-to-the-shooters-lobby/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Trussell Trust''' is a [[Non-governmental organization|NGO]] and charity, based in [[Salisbury]], [[UK]], that co-ordinates the only nationwide network of [[food bank]]s in the country.

== History ==
The Trussell Trust was founded in 1997, by Paddy and Carol Henderson while working with street children in Bulgaria at [[Sofia Central Station|Sofia Central Railway Station]].&lt;ref name="Stewart 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Catriona |date=15 December 2013 |title=An American idea that has spread across the world |url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/an-american-idea-that-has-spread-across-the-world.22956872 |newspaper=[[Herald Scotland|Sunday Herald]] |location= |publisher=Herald &amp; Times Group |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Named for Carol's mother Betty Trussell from whom they had received a legacy, the couple's work spread to the United Kingdom after the couple were contacted by a British mother who was struggling to feed her children.&lt;ref name="How we started"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trusselltrust.org/how-we-started |title=How we started |last1= |first1= |last2= |first2= |date= |website= |publisher=The Trussell Trust |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After researching the issue of short-term hunger in the area, Henderson founded the first of the trust's food banks in the garage and shed of his [[Salisbury]] home.&lt;ref name="Thompson 2013"&gt;{{cite news |last=Thompson |first=Melissa |date=14 August 2013 |title=Meet Trussell Trust founders Paddy and Carol Henderson whose Foodbanks have fed 900,000 hungry Brits |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/trussell-trust-founders-paddy-carol-2163135 |newspaper=[[Daily Mirror]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate=21 December 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Work ==

=== Food banks ===
The trust runs a network of food banks across the United Kingdom. In 2004 they ran only two food banks. With new banks opening every week, it was estimated in a May 2013 report published by [[Oxfam]] and [[Church Action on Poverty]] that over 500,000 people had used the trust's food banks.&lt;ref name="Cooper &amp; Dumpleton 2013"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.church-poverty.org.uk/walkingthebreadline/info/report/walkingthebreadlinefile |title=Walking the breadline: the scandal of food poverty in 21st century Britain |last1=Cooper |first1=Niall |last2=Dumpleton |first2=Sarah |date=May 2013 |website= |publisher=[[OXFAM]] and [[Church Action on Poverty]] |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of people using food banks in the first half of the 2014-15 financial year was 38% higher than the same period the previous year.&lt;ref name="Boffey 2014"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Boffey|first1=Daniel|date=22 November 2014|title=Firms flouting the minimum wage not prosecuted in the past year|url=https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/nov/22/firms-minimum-wage-not-prosecuted|accessdate=22 November 2014|work=[[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Reasons why people have difficulty getting enough to eat include [[Layoff|redundancy]], sickness, delays over receiving [[:Category:pensions and benefits in the United Kingdom|benefits]], [[domestic violence]], family breakdown, [[debt]], additional fuel costs in winter.&lt;ref name=Foodbanks&gt;{{cite web|title=UK Foodbanks|url=http://www.trusselltrust.org/foodbank-projects|publisher=The Trussell Trust|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some clients of foodbanks are in work but cannot afford everything they need due to low pay.&lt;ref name="Davis 2012"/&gt; In 2015, the trust released figures showing that there were over one million users of food banks during the 2014-2015 financial year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dial2donate.org/poverty-in-the-uk-a-real-issue/ |title=Poverty in the UK - a real issue |publisher=Dial2Donate |accessdate=21 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The banks run on a 'front line' model rather than a 'warehouse' model. That is, food is taken in and distributed directly to those who need it. People are referred to the food banks by doctors, social services, [[Citizens Advice Bureau|CAB]] and police who assess need to ensure that it is genuine. Visitors are given vouchers for three days' worth of food, with each visitor eligible for no more than three vouchers.&lt;ref name="Davis 2012"&gt;{{cite news |last=Davis |first=Rowena |date=12 May 2012 |title=The rise and rise of the food bank |url=http://www.newstatesman.com/blogs/society/2012/05/rise-and-rise-food-bank |newspaper=[[New Statesman]] |location= |publisher= |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="How it works"&gt;{{cite web|title=How a foodbank works|url=http://www.trusselltrust.org/how-it-works|publisher=The Trussell Trust|accessdate=22 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors are also signposted to agencies that can help with longer-term difficulties.&lt;ref name="How it works"/&gt;  The Trussell Trust needs extra donations during the long summer school holiday because school children from poor families do not get free school meals then.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/food-bank-donations-uk-children-hunger-summer-holidays-trussel-trust-a8475516.html Food banks appeal for donations ahead of expected rise in demand from hungry children over summer holidays] ''[[The Independent]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Bulgaria ===
The charity continues to work in Bulgaria, where it operates programmes that work with [[street children]] in the country, and [[Romani people]] who are among the poorest in the region.&lt;ref name="Bulgaria projects"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.trusselltrust.org/bulgaria-projects |title=Bulgaria projects |last1= |first1= |date= |website= |publisher=The Trussell Trust |accessdate=21 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Trisodium phosphate''' (TSP) is the [[inorganic compound]] with the [[chemical formula]] Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is a white, granular or crystalline solid, highly soluble in water, producing an alkaline solution.  TSP is used as a cleaning agent, [[Builder (detergent)|builder]], lubricant, food additive, stain remover, and [[degreaser]].&lt;ref name=Ullmann /&gt;

The item of commerce is often partially hydrated and may range from anhydrous Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; to the dodecahydrate [[Sodium|Na]]&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;[[Phosphate|PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]·12 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O. Most often found in white powder form, it can also be called '''trisodium orthophosphate''' or simply '''sodium phosphate'''.

== Production ==
Trisodium phosphate is produced by neutralization of [[phosphoric acid]] using [[sodium hydroxide]], often with [[sodium carbonate]].  Carbonate can only produce [[disodium phosphate]]:
: Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;   →   Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O
: Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;HPO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  NaOH   →   Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;PO&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;  +  H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O

== Uses ==

=== Cleaning ===
Trisodium phosphate was at one time extensively used in formulations for a variety of consumer-grade soaps and detergents, and the most common use for trisodium phosphate has been in cleaning agents. The [[pH]] of a 1% solution is 12 (i.e., very [[Basic (chemistry)|basic]]), and the solution is sufficiently alkaline to [[saponification|saponify]] grease and oils. In combination with [[surfactants]], TSP is an excellent agent for cleaning everything from laundry to concrete driveways. This versatility and low manufacturing price made TSP the basis for a plethora of cleaning products sold in the mid-20th century. TSP is still sold and used as a cleaning agent, but since the late 1960s, its use has diminished in the United States and many other parts of the world because, like many phosphate-based cleaners, it is known to cause extensive [[eutrophication]] of lakes and rivers once it enters a water system.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.npr.org/2010/12/15/132072122/it-s-not-your-fault-your-dishes-are-still-dirty Dishes Still Dirty? Blame Phosphate-Free Detergent], ''National Public Radio'', December 15, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;  Substitutes are generally not as effective.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.boston.com/lifestyle/house/articles/2010/08/26/handyman_on_call_restoring_hardwood_floors/ | work=The Boston Globe | first=Peter | last=Hotton | title=Handyman on Call | date=26 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

TSP is commonly used after cleaning a surface with [[mineral spirits]] to remove hydrocarbon residues and may be used with household [[Sodium hypochlorite|chlorine bleach]] in the same solution without hazardous reactions.{{Citation needed|date=February 2009}} This mixture is particularly effective for removing [[mildew]], but is less effective at removing mold.{{Citation needed|date=August 2015}}

Although it is still the active ingredient in some toilet bowl-cleaning tablets, TSP is generally not recommended for cleaning bathrooms because it can stain metal fixtures and can damage [[grout]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.naturalhandyman.com/iip/infxtra/inftsp.html |title=TSP&amp;nbsp;... Cleaning for the Big Dogs |date= |work=Home Repair and Do It Yourself Tips and Articles from the Natural Handyman |publisher=Natural Handyman |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chlorinated trisodium phosphate ===
With the formula &lt;chem&gt;Na3PO4.1/4NaOCl.11H2O&lt;/chem&gt; the material called chlorinated trisodium phosphate is used as a disinfectant and bleach, like sodium hypochlorite.  It is prepared using NaOCl in place of some of the base to neutralize phosphoric acid.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Klaus Schrödter, Gerhard Bettermann, Thomas Staffel, Friedrich Wahl, Thomas Klein, Thomas Hofmann "Phosphoric Acid and Phosphates" in ''Ullmann’s Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry'' 2008, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a19_465.pub3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flux ===
In the U.S., trisodium phosphate is an approved flux for use in [[brazing|hard soldering]] joints in medical-grade copper plumbing. The flux is applied as a concentrated water solution and dissolves copper oxides at the temperature used in copper brazing. Residues are water soluble and can be rinsed out before plumbing is put into service.

TSP is used as an ingredient in fluxes designed to deoxygenate nonferrous metals for casting. It can be used in ceramic production to lower the flow point of glazes.

=== Painting enhancement ===
TSP is still in common use for the cleaning, degreasing, and deglossing of walls prior to painting. TSP breaks the gloss of oil-based paints and opens the pores of latex-based paint, providing a surface better suited for the adhesion of the subsequent layer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.naturalhandyman.com/qa/qapaintprep.html|title = Painting Preparation Q&amp;A|last = Alonzy|first = Jerry|date = |website = |publisher = |accessdate =}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify credibility|date=March 2011}}

=== Food additive ===
[[Sodium phosphates]] including [[monosodium phosphate]], [[disodium phosphate]], and trisodium phosphate are approved as food additives in the EU.  They are commonly used as acidity regulators and have the collective [[E number]] '''E339'''.&lt;ref name=FSA6&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist#anchor_7 Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers], [[Food Standards Agency]], 26 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt; The United States [[Food and Drug Administration]] lists sodium phosphates as [[generally recognized as safe]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=182.1778 21CFR182.1778], [[Code of Federal Regulations]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?SID=936d3874344a3267898259b7a3369fb0&amp;mc=true&amp;node=se21.3.182_11778&amp;rgn=div8 21CFR182.1778], Electronic [[Code of Federal Regulations]]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Exercise performance enhancement ===
Trisodium phosphate has gained a following as a nutritional supplement that can improve certain parameters of exercise performance.&lt;ref name="Folland"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Folland JP, etal | journal = Journal of Science and Medicine in Sport | year = 2008 | volume = 11 | pages = 464–468 | pmid = 17569583 | title = Sodium phosphate loading improves laboratory cycling time-trial performance in trained cyclists. | issue = 5 | doi = 10.1016/j.jsams.2007.04.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The basis of this belief is the fact that [[phosphate]] is required for the energy-producing [[Krebs cycle]] central to aerobic metabolism. [[Phosphate]]s are available from a number of other sources that are much milder than TSP. While TSP is not toxic per se, it is severely irritating to gastric mucosa unless used as part of a [[buffering agent#Examples|buffered]] solution.

== Regulation ==
In the Western world, phosphate usage has declined owing to ecological problems with the damage to lakes and rivers through eutrophication.

=== TSP substitutes ===
{{See also|Cleaning products and the environment}}
By the end of the 20th century, many products that formerly contained TSP were manufactured with TSP substitutes, which consist mainly of [[sodium carbonate]] along with various admixtures of nonionic surfactants and a limited percentage of sodium phosphates.

Products sold as TSP substitutes, containing [[soda ash]] and [[zeolites]], are promoted as direct substitutes. However, sodium carbonate is not as strongly basic as trisodium phosphate, making it less effective in demanding applications. Zeolites, which are clay based, are added to laundry detergents as water softening agents and are essentially non-polluting; however, zeolites do not dissolve and can deposit a fine, powdery residue in the wash tub. Cleaning products labeled as TSP may contain other ingredients, with perhaps less than 50% trisodium phosphate.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dap.com/docs/msds/00079403001_english.pdf MSDS] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926035651/http://dap.com/docs/msds/00079403001_english.pdf |date=26 September 2010 }} for Dap TSP cleaner&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[[United Nations]] [[List of UN Security Council Resolutions|Security Council Resolution]] 181''', adopted on August 7, 1963, was concerned with an arms build-up by the [[Republic of South Africa]] and fears that those arms might be used to further the racial conflict in that country.  The Council called upon the government of South Africa to abandon its policy of [[apartheid]], as first requested to by [[United Nations Security Council Resolution 134|Resolution 134 (1960)]], and called upon all states to voluntarily cease the sale and shipment of all arms, ammunition and other military equipment to South Africa.

The resolution was adopted by nine votes to none; [[France]] and the [[United Kingdom]] [[Abstention|abstained]]. However, the resolution had little immediate effect on the conduct of the regime in South Africa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hilaire|first=Max|title=United Nations law and the Security Council|publisher=Ashgate Publishing, Ltd.|date=2005|page=256|isbn=978-0-7546-4489-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Flickr - boellstiftung - Strategiedebatte (5).jpg|thumb|Werner Schulz (2010)]]
'''Werner Gustav Schulz''' (born January 22, 1950 in [[Zwickau]]) is a German politician ([[Alliance '90/The Greens]]). He was from 1990 to 2005 a Member of the German [[Bundestag]] and from 2009–2014 a [[Member of the European Parliament]] (MEP). Schulz is considered the only profiled civil rights activist from [[East Germany]] who prevailed permanently in his party.

==Training and career as a scientist==
Werner Schulz grew up in Zwickau, the son of an independent haulage contractor and former professional officer from a social-democratic dominated family.&lt;ref&gt;Eckhard Jesse, Martin Böttger: ''Friedliche Revolution und deutsche Einheit. Sächsische Bürgerrechtler ziehen Bilanz'', Ch. Links Verlag, Berlin 2006, S. 226, 270.&lt;/ref&gt; From 1964 to 1968, he attended the  "[[:de:Käthe-Kollwitz-Gymnasium (Zwickau)|Käthe Kollwitz]]" Advanced High School. His father forbade him to join the Young Pioneers. He received a degree in Food Technology at the [[Humboldt University of Berlin]] in 1972. From 1974 he worked as a research assistant working at the Humboldt University.

Members received a deep [[political indoctrination]] and basic [[military training]].  Their responsibilities included forming part of the [[Militia|home guard]] to assist in matters of [[civil defense]] under the direction of official local authorities.  They were issued mostly obsolete weapons provided to the organization under orders from their Director-General [[Kingoro Hashimoto]],&lt;ref name=Shillony/&gt; and were intended to assist local efforts in fire fighting following [[strategic bombing|air raid]]s, distribution of emergency supplies and rendering basic first aid. The most advanced pupils were earmarked for eventual enrollment in the [[Imperial Japanese Army Academy]], or for a future role as elected local politicians within the ''Taisei Yokusankai'' organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Payne | first = Stanley G.  | title = A History of Fascism, 1914-1945 | publisher = Routledge | year = 1996 | url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=9wHNrF7nFecC&amp;pg=RA1-PA335&amp;dq=young+mens+corps+japan&amp;as_brr=3&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;sig=OhnvWowSgx3An76Ag1PfOXQHFMo | isbn = 1-85728-595-6 | page = 335}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to its civil defence and para-military role, the Yokusan Sonendan was also tasked with assisting the local ''[[tonarigumi]]'' organizations and the ''[[Kempeitai]]'' in watching for any signs of subversive ideologies in their local areas and reporting any anti-war or anti-government activities.

In the last stages of [[World War II]], the members receiving additional military training in the use of [[anti-tank]] weapons and light [[machine gun]]s, for conversion into reserve combat units to support Japan's remaining troops against the [[Operation Downfall|projected invasion]] of the Japanese homeland by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]]. The group suffered heavy combat casualties during the [[Battle of Okinawa]]. The Yokusan Sonendan was disbanded on 30 May 1945 &lt;ref name=Shillony/&gt; and its membership merged into the [[Volunteer Fighting Corps]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=MwnqPgAACAAJ&amp;dq=Downfall,+the+End+of+the+Japanese+Empire&amp;cd=1 Frank, ''Downfall, the End of the Japanese Empire'']&lt;/ref&gt;
