The 2010 American film ''[[The Pregnancy Pact]]'' is based on the same story.

==Plot==
In Lorient, 17 teenage girls from the same high school make an unexpected decision, incomprehensible to the boys and adults. They decide to get pregnant at the same time. Camille (Louise Grinberg) lives alone with her mother who is overwhelmed by her work. She becomes pregnant after a condom problem with a sexual partner who is not her boyfriend. She is the first to discover a positive pregnancy test.

She wants to keep her child, which will convince the others to become pregnant and they can all raise their children together.  These girls do not want to comply with the traditional code of conduct and just want to "give the love they have to a baby." Emancipation, is the keyword of these girls who build a plan to no longer be reflections of their parents. "We will be only 16 years apart from our kids, this is ideal. We will be closer in age, no clash of generations!" They decide to educate their future children together in the form of a "hippie community."

In the end, Camille loses her baby after a minor traffic accident. She and her mother leave town without telling anyone where they've gone. The other girls have their babies, but they do not form a "community."

'''''84, Charing Cross Road''''' is a 1970 book by [[Helene Hanff]], later made into a stage play, television play, and [[84 Charing Cross Road (film)|film]], about the twenty-year correspondence between the author and [[Frank Doel]], chief buyer of [[Marks &amp; Co]] antiquarian booksellers, located at the [[eponymous]] address in [[London]], England.

==Background==
Hanff was in search of obscure classics and British literature titles that she had been unable to find in [[New York City]] when she noticed an ad in the ''[[Saturday Review (US magazine)|Saturday Review of Literature]]''. She first contacted the shop in 1949 and it fell to Doel to fulfil her requests. In time, a long-distance friendship developed between the two and between Hanff and other staff members, as well, with an exchange of [[Christmas]] packages, birthday gifts and food parcels to help with the post-[[World War II]] [[Rationing in the United Kingdom#After World War II|food shortages in Britain]]. Their letters included discussions about topics as diverse as the sermons of [[John Donne]], how to make [[Yorkshire Pudding]], the [[Brooklyn Dodgers]] and the [[Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II|coronation of Elizabeth II]]. Hanff postponed visiting her English friends until too late; Doel died in December 1968 from [[peritonitis]] from a burst [[Vermiform appendix|appendix]], and the bookshop eventually closed in December 1970. Hanff did finally visit [[Charing Cross Road]] and the empty shop in the summer of 1971, a trip recorded in her 1973 book ''The Duchess of Bloomsbury Street''. 

==The shop's site today==
The five-story building where Marks &amp; Co. was located during the events of the book still exists {{nowrap|({{coord|51.51365|-0.12916|format=dms|type:landmark_region:GB}})}}. A circular brass plaque on a [[pilaster]] on the street frontage acknowledges the story and marks the site. The premises were occupied by a music and [[Compact disc|CD]] shop in the early 1990s, and later other retail outlets. In 2009 they housed a Med Kitchen restaurant; and now form part of a [[McDonald's]] restaurant.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.84charingcrossroad.co.uk/hist2.html |title=A Brief History – Page 2|work=84charingcrossroad.co.uk|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Whitemore returned to the project to write the [[screenplay]] for the [[84 Charing Cross Road (film)|1987 film adaptation]] starring [[Anne Bancroft]] and [[Anthony Hopkins]]. The ''dramatis personae'' were expanded to include Hanff's [[Manhattan]] friends, the bookshop staff, and Doel's wife Nora, played by [[Judi Dench]]. Bancroft won a [[BAFTA]] Award as Best Actress; Whitemore and Dench were nominated for Director and Supporting Actress, respectively.

'''Art theft''' is usually for the purpose of resale or for [[ransom]] (sometimes called '''artnapping'''). Stolen art is sometimes used by criminals as [[Collateral (finance)|collateral]] to secure loans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Nick |last=Hopkins |title=How art treasures are stolen to order |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/08/nickhopkins |work=The Guardian |date=January 8, 2000 |location=London |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160316154211/http://www.theguardian.com/uk/2000/jan/08/nickhopkins |archivedate=March 16, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only a small percentage of stolen art is recovered—estimates range from 5 to 10%. This means that little is known about the scope and characteristics of art theft.

==Individual theft==
Many thieves are motivated by the fact that valuable art pieces are worth millions of dollars and weigh only a few kilograms at most.  Transport for items such as paintings is also trivial, assuming the thief is willing to inflict some damage to the painting by cutting it off the frame and rolling it up into a tube carrier.{{Citation needed|reason=Reliable source needed|date=July 2011}} Also, while most high-profile museums have extremely tight security, many places with multimillion-dollar art collections have disproportionately poor security measures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Cameron |last=Skene |title=Art theft ranked as fourth-largest criminal enterprise |url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=40babe8f-84b5-46d7-a311-344494e03788 |work=National Post |location=Canada |date=September 1, 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303174559/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/news/story.html?id=40babe8f-84b5-46d7-a311-344494e03788 |archivedate=March 3, 2016 |df=mdy}}&lt;/ref&gt; That makes them susceptible to thefts that are slightly more complicated than a typical [[smash-and-grab]], but offer a huge potential payoff.  Thieves sometimes target works based on their own familiarity with the artist, rather than the artist's reputation in the art world or the theoretical value of the work.&lt;ref name="rembrandts" /&gt;

Unfortunately for the thieves, it is extremely difficult to sell the most famous and valuable works without getting caught, because any interested buyer will almost certainly know the work is stolen and advertising it risks someone contacting the authorities. It is also difficult for the buyer to display the work to visitors without it being recognized as stolen, thus defeating much of the point of owning the art.  Many famous works have instead been held for ransom from the legitimate owner or even returned without ransom, due to the lack of black-market customers.  Returning for ransom also risks a [[sting operation]].&lt;ref name="rembrandts"&gt;{{cite book|title=Stealing Rembrandts: The Untold Stories of Notorious Art Heists|author1=Anthony M.

==Prevention in museums==
Museums can take numerous measures to prevent the theft of artworks include having enough guides or guards to watch displayed items, avoiding situations where security-camera sightlines are blocked, and fastening paintings to walls with hanging wires that are not too thin and with locks.&lt;ref name=rkhhii/&gt;

=== Art theft education ===
The Smithsonian Institution sponsors the National Conference on Cultural Property Protection, held annually in Washington, D. C. The conference is aimed at professionals in the field of cultural property protection.

Since 1996, the Netherlands-based Museum Security Network has disseminated news and information related to issues of cultural property loss and recovery. Since its founding the Museum Security Network has collected and disseminated over 45,000 reports about incidents with cultural property. The founder of the Museum Security Network, Ton Cremers, is recipient of the National Conference on Cultural Property Protection Robert Burke Award.

2007 saw the foundation of the Association for Research into Crimes against Art (ARCA). ARCA is a nonprofit [[think tank]] dedicated principally to raising the profile of art crime ([[art forgery]] and [[vandalism]], as well as theft) as an academic subject.  Since 2009, ARCA has offered an unaccredited postgraduate certificate program dedicated to this field of study. The [[Postgraduate Certificate Program in Art Crime and Cultural Heritage Protection]] is held from June to August every year in Italy. A few American universities, including [http://arthistory.as.nyu.edu/page/home New York University], also offer courses on art crime.

==Recovery==

In the public sphere, [[Interpol]], the [[FBI]] Art Crime Team, London's [[Metropolitan Police]], [[New York Police Department]]'s special frauds squad&lt;ref&gt;Yarrow, Andrew L. [https://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/arts/a-lucrative-crime-grows-into-a-costly-epidemic.html?scp=10&amp;sq=international%20foundatin%20for%20art%20research&amp;st=cse  "A Lucrative Crime Grows Into a Costly Epidemic,"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161228031853/http://www.nytimes.com/1990/03/20/arts/a-lucrative-crime-grows-into-a-costly-epidemic.html?scp=10&amp;sq=international%20foundatin%20for%20art%20research&amp;st=cse |date=December 28, 2016}} ''New York Times.'' March 20, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt; and a number of other law enforcement agencies worldwide maintain "squads" dedicated to investigating thefts of this nature and recovering stolen works of art.

According to [[Robert King Wittman]], a former FBI agent who led the Art Crime Team until his retirement in 2008, the unit is very small compared with similar law-enforcement units in Europe, and most art thefts investigated by the FBI involve agents at local offices who handle routine property theft. "Art and antiquity crime is tolerated, in part, because it is considered a victimless crime," Wittman said in 2010.&lt;ref name=rkhhii&gt;Kennedy, Randy, [https://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/arts/design/07wittman.html?ref=arts "His Heart Is in the Art of Sleuthing"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160209034311/http://www.nytimes.com/2010/06/07/arts/design/07wittman.html?ref=arts |date=February 9, 2016}}, p C1, ''The New York Times'', June 7, 2010, retrieved same day&lt;/ref&gt;

In response to a growing public awareness of art theft and recovery, a number of not-for-profit and private companies now act both to record information about losses and oversee recovery efforts for claimed works of art. Among the most notable are:

* [[International Foundation for Art Research|IFAR]]
* [[Commission for Looted Art in Europe]]
* [[Holocaust Claims Conference]]
* [[Art Loss Register]]
* [[Art Recovery Group]]

In January 2017, Spain's [[Interior Ministry]] announced that police from 18 European countries, with the support of Interpol, [[Europol]], and [[Unesco]], had arrested 75 people involved in an international network of art traffickers. The pan-European operation had begun in October, 2016 and led to the recovery of about 3,500 stolen items including archaeological artifacts and other artwork. The ministry did not provide an inventory of recovered items or the locations of the arrests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/22/world/europe/75-arrested-in-european-crackdown-on-art-trafficking.html?emc=edit_ee_20170123&amp;nl=todaysheadlines-europe&amp;nlid=62598762 |title=75 Arrested in European Crackdown on Art Trafficking |newspaper=The New York Times |date=January 22, 2017 |author=Raphael Minder |accessdate=January 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==State theft, wartime looting and misappropriation by museums==
From 1933 through the end of World War II, the [[Nazi]] regime maintained a policy of [[Nazi plunder|looting art]] for sale or for removal to museums in the Third Reich. [[Hermann Göring]], head of the [[Luftwaffe]], personally took charge of hundreds of valuable pieces, generally stolen from Jews and other victims of [[the Holocaust]].

In early 2011, about 1,500 art masterpieces, assumed to have been stolen by the [[Nazis]] during and before World War II, were confiscated from a private home in Munich, Germany. The confiscation was not made public until November 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?_r=0 "Report of Nazi-Looted Trove Puts Art World in an Uproar"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170205111313/http://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/arts/design/trove-of-apparently-nazi-looted-art-found-in-munich-apartment.html?_r=0 |date=February 5, 2017}}, ''The New York Times'', Nov. 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; With an estimated value of $1 billion, their discovery is considered "astounding,"&lt;ref&gt;video: [https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/10424791/Expert-stolen-Nazi-art-find-astounding.html "Expert: stolen Nazi art find 'astounding'"], ''The Telegraph'', U.K., Nov. 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; and includes works by [[Pablo Picasso]], [[Henri Matisse]], [[Marc Chagall]], [[Paul Klee]], [[Max Beckmann]] and [[Emil Nolde]], all of which were considered lost.&lt;ref name=guardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police "Modernist art haul, 'looted by Nazis', recovered by German police"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105213919/http://www.theguardian.com/world/2013/nov/03/nazis-looted-modernist-masterpieces-germany-police |date=November 5, 2013}}, ''The Guardian'', U.K. Nov. 3, 2013&lt;/ref&gt;

The looted, mostly [[Modern art|Modernist]] art, was banned by the Nazis when they came to power, on the grounds that it was "un-German" or Jewish Bolshevist in nature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10425983/Nazi-art-does-Germany-have-a-problem-returning-art-stolen-by-the-Nazis.html "Nazi art: does Germany have a problem returning art stolen by the Nazis?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131106020130/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/art/art-news/10425983/Nazi-art-does-Germany-have-a-problem-returning-art-stolen-by-the-Nazis.html |date=November 6, 2013}}, ''The Telegraph'', U.K., Nov. 4, 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Descendants of Jewish collectors who were robbed of their works by the Nazis may be able to claim ownership of many of the works.&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Members of the families of the original owners of [[looted art|these artworks]] have, in many cases, persisted in claiming title to their pre-war property.

The 1964 film [[The Train (1964 film)|''The Train'']], starring [[Burt Lancaster]], is based on the true story of  works of art which had been placed in storage for protection in France during the war, but was looted by the Germans from French museums and private art collections, to be shipped by train back to Germany. Another film, ''[[The Monuments Men]]'' (2014), co-produced, co-written and directed by [[George Clooney]], is based on a similar true-life story. In this film, U.S. soldiers are tasked with saving over a million pieces of art and other culturally important items throughout Europe, before their destruction by [[Nazi plunder]].

In 2006, after a protracted court battle in the United States and Austria (see [[Republic of Austria v. Altmann]]), five paintings by [[Austrians|Austrian]] artist [[Gustav Klimt]] were returned to [[Maria Altmann]], the niece of pre-war owner, Ferdinand Bloch-Bauer. Two of the paintings were portraits of Altmann's aunt, Adele.  The more famous of the two, the gold ''[[Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer I]]'', was sold in 2006 by Altmann and her co-heirs to philanthropist [[Ronald Lauder]] for $135 million. At the time of the sale, it was the highest known price ever paid for a painting. The remaining four [[Restitution|restituted]] paintings were later sold at [[Christie's East|Christie's New York]] for over $190 million.

Because antiquities are often regarded by the country of origin as national treasures, there are numerous cases where artworks (often displayed in the acquiring country for decades) have become the subject of highly charged and political controversy. One prominent example is the case of the [[Elgin Marbles]], which were moved from Greece to the [[British Museum]] in 1816 by [[Thomas Bruce, 7th Earl of Elgin]]. Many different [[Greece|Greek]] governments have maintained that removal was tantamount to theft.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Summer |last=Banks |title=Now you see it, now you don't |date=January 25, 2008 |url =http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/23119 |work =Yale Daily News |accessdate=January 27, 2008 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080129122413/http://www.yaledailynews.com/articles/view/23119 |archivedate=January 29, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar controversies have arisen over [[Etruscan civilization|Etruscan]], [[Aztec]], and [[Italian art|Italian]] artworks, with advocates of the originating countries generally alleging that the removal of artifacts is a pernicious form of [[cultural imperialism]]. [[Yale University]]'s [[Peabody Museum of Natural History]] is engaged (as of November 2006) in talks with the government of [[Peru]] about possible [[Art repatriation|repatriation]] of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] taken during the excavation of [[Machu Picchu]] by Yale's [[Hiram Bingham III|Hiram Bingham]].   Likewise the Chinese government considers Chinese art in foreign hands to be stolen and there may be a clandestine repatriation effort underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Palmer |first1=Alex W |title=The Great Chinese Art Heist |url=https://www.gq.com/story/the-great-chinese-art-heist |accessdate=17 August 2018 |work=[[GQ]] |date=16 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006, New York's [[Metropolitan Museum]] reached an agreement with Italy to return many [[illicit antiquities|disputed pieces]].  The [[Getty Museum]] in Los Angeles is also involved in a [[Marion True|series of cases]] of this nature. The artwork in question is of Greek and ancient Italian origin. The museum agreed on November 20, 2006, to return 26 contested pieces to Italy. One of the Getty's signature pieces, a statue of the goddess [[Aphrodite]], is the subject of particular scrutiny.

In January 2013, after investigations by Interpol, FBI and The U.S. Department of Homeland Security, police in Canada arrested [[John Tillmann (art thief)]] for an enormous spate of art thefts. It was later determined that Tillmann in conjunction with his Russian wife, had for over twenty years, stolen at least 10,000 different art objects from various museums, galleries, archives and shops from around the world. While not the largest art heist in total dollar value, Tillmann's case may be the largest art heist ever, in number of objects stolen.

The [[Nazi plunder]]ing of artworks was carried out by the [[Reichsleiter Rosenberg Institute for the Occupied Territories]] (Einsatzstab Reichsleiter Rosenberg für die Besetzen Gebiete). In occupied France, the [[Galerie nationale du Jeu de Paume|Jeu de Paume Art Museum]] in Paris was used as a central storage and sorting depot for looted artworks from museums and private [[art collection]]s throughout France pending distribution to various persons and places in Germany. The Nazis confiscated tens of thousands of works from their legitimate Jewish owners. Some were confiscated by the [[Allies of World War II|Allies]] at the end of the war. Many ended up in the hands of respectable collectors and institutions. Jewish ownership of some of the art was codified into the [[Geneva conventions]].

In 1945, an American soldier Joe Meador stole eight medieval artifacts found in a mineshaft near [[Quedlinburg]] which had been hidden by local members of the clergy from Nazi looters in 1943.

Returning to the United States, the artifacts remained in Meador's possession until his death in 1980.  He made no attempt to sell them. When his older brother and sister attempted to sell a 9th-century manuscript and 16th-century prayer book in 1990, the two were charged. However, the charges were dismissed after it was declared the [[statute of limitations]] had expired.

In 1974, members of the [[Provisional Irish Republican Army|IRA]], including [[Rose Dugdale]], bound and gagged the Beits, making off with nineteen paintings worth an estimated £8 million.  A deal to exchange the paintings for prisoners was offered, but the paintings were recovered after a raid on a rented cottage in [[County Cork|Cork]], and those responsible were caught and imprisoned.

In 1986, a [[Dublin]] gang led by [[Martin Cahill]] stole eighteen paintings worth an estimated £30 million in total.  Sixteen paintings were subsequently recovered, with a further two still missing {{as of|2006}}.

Two paintings worth an estimated £3 million were stolen by three armed men in 2001. One of these, a [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]] had been previously stolen by Cahill's gang. Both paintings were recovered in September 2002.

A mere two to three days after the recovery of the two paintings stolen in 2001, the house was robbed for the fourth time, with five paintings taken. These paintings were recovered in December 2002 during a search of a house in [[Clondalkin]].

On April 15, 1983, more than 200 rare clocks and watches were stolen from the [[L. A. Mayer Institute for Islamic Art]] in [[Jerusalem]]. Among the stolen watches was one known as the [[Marie-Antoinette]], the most valuable piece of the watch collection made by the French-Swiss watchmaker [[Abraham-Louis Breguet]] on order by Queen [[Marie Antoinette]], it is estimated to be worth $30 million. The heist is considered to be the largest robbery in Israel. The man responsible for the robbery was [[Naaman Diller]]. On November 18, 2008, French and Israeli police officials discovered half of the cache of stolen timepieces in two bank safes in France. Of the 106 rare timepieces stolen in 1983, 96 have now been recovered. Among those recovered was the rare Marie-Antoinette watch. In 2010, Nilli Shomrat, Diller's widow, was sentenced to 300 hours of community service and given a five-year suspended sentence for possession of stolen property.

|A cast of [[Barbara Hepworth]]'s (5/6) ''[[Two Forms (Divided Circle)]]'' was displayed in Dulwich Park from 1970 until it was cut from it plinth by scrap metal thieves in December 2011. It was insured for £500,000, but its scrap value was estimated at perhaps £750. Southwark Council offered a reward of £1,000, and the Hepworth Estate increased the reward to £5,000, for information leading to the arrest and conviction of the thieves.

|[[John Tillmann (art thief)]]

|{{main|John Tillmann (art thief)}}
On January 18, 2013, police in Canada arrested John Mark Tillmann of Fall River Nova Scotia after extensive investigations by Interpol, FBI, RCMP and the US Dept of Homeland Security. The case was a mammoth one and it took authorities nearly three years to close the file. Tillmann was sentenced to nine years in prison for stealing over 10,000 pieces of art-work. In sheer volume, it may be the biggest case of art heist of all time. It was later determined that Tillmann had acted in concert with his Russian wife and her brother, and that they had travelled extensively over the world posing as security and maintenance workers to gain access to museums. Successfully eluding authorities for almost twenty years, the trio had stolen millions of dollars of artifacts in every continent except Australia. Tillmann and his accomplice wife, even raided the Nova Scotia Provincial Legislature in his home province, making off with a valuable 200 year old watercolour. He was versatile in his art thefts, not solely concentrating on paintings, but also known for stealing rare books, statutes, coins, edged weapons, medieval Knight suits of armour and even a 5,000 year old Egyptian mummy. A university graduate, he was also known to be an avid history buff.

In 2006, about 8 antique [[Chola]] idols, that of [[Nataraja]]r and Uma Mashewari, [[Ganesha|Vinayagar]], Devi, [[Lakshmi|Deepalaksmi]], Chandrashekarar, Sampanthar and [[Krishna]]r, were stolen from the Brihadeeswarar temple at Sripuranthan, allegedly on the orders of New York-based art dealer [[Subhash Kapoor (art dealer)|Subhash Kapoor]], and smuggled to the United States. Of these statues the Natarajar idol was sold to the [[National Gallery of Australia]], Canberra for USD 5.1 million and the Vinayagar idol to the [[Toledo Museum of Art]], Ohio and the Uma Maheswari idol to [[Asian Civilisation Museum]], Singapore. The scandal was exposed by the investigative website Chasing Aphrodite, and received wide coverage in the Indian media. The Australian Government decided to return to idol to India and it was handed over to the Indian Prime Minister. The other museums also agreed to return the stolen idols.

|[[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] art in [[Madrid]] 
|June 2015, made public in March 2016
|Five paintings –said to be of medium-to-small size and worth a combined estimated €30m– by British artist [[Francis Bacon (artist)|Francis Bacon]] were stolen from the Madrid home of their owner during his absence in what has been defined as the largest contemporary art heist in recent Spanish history. The owner is the last known love interest of the painter, from whom he had inheritted the paintings. The art thieves left no fingerprints and managed to get away with the works without setting off any alarms or raising any eyebrows in one of the city’s safest and most heavily monitored districts. 
In May 2016 seven people were detained in connection with the case, they stand accused for masterminding the heist and are currently on parole. However the artworks (which are believed to remain somewhere in Spain) were not found.

In July 2017 three of the five paintings were recovered by the Spanish police.

==Fictional art theft==
Genres such as [[crime fiction]] often portray fictional art thefts as glamorous or exciting raising generations of admirers. Most of these sources add adventurous, even heroic element to the theft, portraying it as an achievement. In literature, a niche of the [[Mystery (fiction)|mystery]] genre is devoted to art theft and forgery. In film, a [[caper story]] usually features complicated heist plots and visually exciting getaway scenes. In many of these movies, the stolen art piece is a [[MacGuffin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.allmovie.com/movie/stolen-v324754 |title=Stolen (2005) - Trailers, Reviews, Synopsis, Showtimes and Cast - AllMovie |work=AllMovie |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151019024217/http://www.allmovie.com/movie/stolen-v324754 |archivedate=October 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1485">A '''book rhyme''' is a short [[poem]] or [[rhyme]] that was formerly printed inside the front of a book or on the flyleaf to discourage [[theft]] or to indicate ownership.

Book rhymes were fairly common in the [[United States]] during the 18th and 19th centuries, but the printing of [[bookplate]]s pushed them out of use.

==Anti-theft warnings==
One of the most common is:
&lt;poem&gt;If this book you steal away,
What will you say
On Judgment Day?&lt;/poem&gt;

==Identification rhyme==
&lt;poem&gt;''Everytown is my dwelling-place''
''America is my nation''
''John Smith is my name''&lt;/poem&gt;

The end line has several variations,
&lt;poem&gt;''And Christ is my salvation''
''And heaven my expectation''&lt;/poem&gt;

The title of [[Thornton Wilder]]'s novel "Heaven's My Destination" and [[Alfred Bester]]'s novel ''[[The Stars My Destination]]'' play on the final line.

A typical example of a book rhyme features prominently in [[M. R. James|M.R. James']] ghost story ''[[A Warning to the Curious]]'':

&lt;poem&gt;''Nathaniel Ager is my name and England is my nation,
''Seaburgh is my dwelling-place and Christ is my salvation,''
''When I am dead and in my Grave, and all my bones are rotton,''
''I hope the Lord will think on me when I am long forgotton.''&lt;/poem&gt;

'''''Capital, Volume III''''', subtitled ''The Process of Capitalist Production as a Whole'', is the third volume of ''[[Capital: Critique of Political Economy]]''. It was prepared by [[Friedrich Engels]] from notes left by [[Karl Marx]] and published in 1894. 

==Contents==
Volume III is in seven parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Capital, Volume 3|isbn=0-7178-0490-9|last=Engels|first=Friedrich|publisher=International Publishers Co, Inc.|year=1967}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# The conversion of Surplus Value into Profit and the rate of Surplus Value into the rate of Profit
# Conversion of Profit into Average Profit
# The Law of the [[Tendency of the rate of profit to fall|Tendency of the Rate of Profit to Fall]]
# Conversion of Commodity Capital and Money Capital into Commercial Capital and Money-Dealing Capital (Merchant's Capital)
# Division of Profit Into Interest and Profit of Enterprise, Interest Bearing Capital.
# Transformation of Surplus-Profit into [[economic rent|Ground Rent]].
# Revenues and Their Sources

The work is best known today for part 3, which in summary says that as the organic fixed capital requirements of production rise as a result of advancements in production generally, the [[rate of profit]] tends to fall. This result, which orthodox Marxists believe is a principal contradictory characteristic leading to an inevitable collapse of the capitalist order,&lt;ref&gt;"At any rate, it is but a requirement of the capitalist mode of production that the number of wage-workers should increase absolutely, in spite of its relative decrease. Labour-power becomes redundant for it as soon as it is no longer necessary to employ it for 12 to 15 hours a daily. A development of productive forces which would diminish the absolute number of labourers, i.e. enable the entire nation to accomplish its total production in a shorter time span, would cause a revolution, because it would put the bulk of the population out of the running. This is another manifestation of the specific barrier of capitalist production, showing also that capitalist production is by no means an absolute form for the development of the productive forces and for the creation of wealth, but rather that at a certain point it comes into collision with this development. This collision appears partly in its [[Late 2000s recession|periodical crises]], which arise from the circumstances that now this and now that portion of the labouring population becomes redundant under its old mode of employment. The limit of capitalist production is the excess time of the labourers. The absolute spare time gained by society does not concern it. The development of productivity concerns it only in so far as it increases the surplus labour-time of the working class, not because it decreases the labour time for material production in general. It moves thus in a contradiction. " Ch. XV ''Exposition of the Internal Contradictions of the Law'', &amp;sect; IV Supplementary Remarks. p 263 Institute of Marxism Leninism, Moscow translation. The reference to hours worked per day reflects [[full employment]] norms [[eight-hour day|of the 19th century]].&lt;/ref&gt; was held by Marx and Engels to, as a result of  various contradictions in the [[capitalist mode of production (Marxist theory)|capitalist mode of production]], result in [[Crisis (Marxian)|crises]] whose resolution necessitates the emergence of an entirely new [[mode of production]] as the culmination of the same historical dialectic that led to the emergence of [[capitalism]] from [[feudalism|prior forms]].&lt;ref&gt;"... This transformation stems from the development of the productive forces under capitalist production, and from the ways and means by which this development takes place." Ch. XV ''Exposition of the Internal Contradictions of the Law'', &amp;sect; IV Supplementary Remarks. p 264 &amp;para; 2 Institute of Marxism Leninism, Moscow translation.&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume 3 is subtitled "The process of capitalist production as a whole" and is concerned primarily with the internal differentiation of the capitalist class. The first three parts are concerned with the division of surplus value amongst individual capitals, where it takes the form of profit. The following parts are concerned with merchants' capital, interest-bearing capital and landed capital. The last part draws the whole account together. The aim of the volume as a whole is to 'locate and describe the concrete forms which grow out of the movements of capital as a whole...The various forms of capital,
as evolved in this book, thus approach step by step the form which they assume on the surface of society, in the action of different capitals on one another in competition, and in the ordinary consciousness of the agents of production themselves." (25) (Clarke).{{Citation needed|date=November 2014}}

'''Chic''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|ʃ|iː|k}}, meaning "stylish" or "smart", is an element of fashion.

==Etymology==
''[[:wikt:chic#French|Chic]]'' is a French word, established in English since at least the 1870s. Early references in English dictionaries classified it as slang and [[New Zealand]]-born [[lexicographer]] [[Eric Partridge]] noted, with reference to its [[Colloquialism|colloquial]] meaning, that it was "not so used in Fr[ench]."&lt;ref&gt;''Dictionary of Slang and Unconventional English'', several ed 1937–61.{{full|date=November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gustave Flaubert]] notes in ''[[Madame Bovary]]'' (published in 1856) that "chicard" (one who is chic) is then Parisian very current slang for "classy" noting, perhaps derisively, perhaps not, that it was bourgeoisie. There is a similar word in German, ''[[:wikt:schick|schick]]'', with a meaning similar to ''chic'', which may be the origin of the word in French; another theory links ''chic'' to the word ''[[:wikt:chicane#French|chicane]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{OEtymD|chic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the French pronunciation (/ˈʃiːk/ or "sheek") is now virtually standard and was that given by [[H. W. Fowler|Fowler]],&lt;ref&gt;''Modern English Usage'', 1926&lt;/ref&gt; ''chic'' was often rendered in the anglicised form of "chick".&lt;ref&gt;An example was in [[Simon Raven]]'s ''[[Edward and Mrs Simpson]]'' (Thames, 1978), a television drama based on the events leading to the [[Abdication crisis]] of 1936, when the leader of the Labour Party, [[Clement Attlee]] (played by Patrick Troughton), used the word slightly contemptuously during a meeting with Prime Minister [[Stanley Baldwin]] (David Waller).&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Monte Carlo Casino 2.JPG|thumb|280px|left|[[French Riviera|Riviera]] chic—[[Monte Carlo]].]]
In a fictional [[vignette (literature)|vignette]] for ''[[Punch (magazine)|Punch]]'' (''c''. 1932) Mrs F. A. Kilpatrick attributed to a young woman who 70 years later would have been called a "[[chavette]]" the following assertion: "It 'asn't go no buttons neither ... That's the latest ideer. If you want to be chick you just 'ang on to it, it seems".&lt;ref&gt;''Round the Year with Mr Punch'', vol XIX&lt;/ref&gt;

By contrast, in [[Anita Loos]]' novel, ''[[Gentlemen Prefer Blondes (novel)|Gentlemen Prefer Blondes]]'' (1925), the diarist Lorelei Lee recorded that "the French use the word 'sheik' for everything, while we only seem to use if for gentlemen when they seem to resemble [[Rudolf Valentino]]" (a pun derived from the latter's being the star of the 1921 silent film, ''[[The Sheik (film)|The Sheik]]'').

The [[Oxford Dictionary]] gives the comparative and superlative forms of ''chic'' as ''chicer'' and ''chicest''. These are wholly English words: the French equivalents would be ''plus chic'' and ''le/la plus chic''. ''Super-chic'' is sometimes used: "super-chic Incline bucket in mouth-blown, moulded glass".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 8 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

An adverb ''chicly'' has also appeared: "Pamela Gross ... turned up chicly dressed down".&lt;ref&gt;''Tatler'', May 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of the French ''très chic'' (very chic) by an English speaker – "Luckily it's ''très'' chic to be neurotic in New York"&lt;ref&gt;[[Plum Sykes]] (2004) ''[[Bergdorf Blondes]]''&lt;/ref&gt; – is usually rather pretentious, but sometimes merely facetious—[[Micky Dolenz]] of [[The Monkees]] described the [[Red Indian|Indian]]-style suit he wore at the [[Monterey Pop Festival]] in 1967 as ''"très chic"''.&lt;ref&gt;Micky Dolenz &amp; Mark Bego (1993) ''I'm a Believer''&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Über]]-chic'' is roughly the mock-German equivalent: "Like his clubs, it's super-modern, über-chic, yet still comfortable".&lt;ref&gt;''Times Magazine'', 24 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The opposite of "chic" is ''unchic'': "the then uncrowded, unchic little port of [[Saint Tropez|St Tropez]]".&lt;ref&gt;Peter Lewis (1978) ''The Fifties''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotes==
Over the years "chic" has been applied to, among other things, social events, situations, individuals, and modes or styles of dress. It was one of a number of "slang words" that [[H. W. Fowler]] linked to particular professions – specifically, to "society journalism" – with the advice that, if used in such a context, "familiarity will disguise and sometimes it will bring out its slanginess."&lt;ref&gt;H W &amp; [[Francis George Fowler|F G Fowler]], ''The King's English '', 3rd ed revised H W Fowler, 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

*In 1887 ''[[The Lady (magazine)|The Lady]]'' noted that "the ladies of New York ... think no form of entertainment so ''chic'' as a luncheon party."&lt;ref&gt;''The Lady'', 20 January 1887&lt;/ref&gt;
*Forty years later, in [[E. F. Benson]]'s novel ''[[Mapp and Lucia|Lucia in London]]'' (1927), Lucia was aware that the arrival of a glittering array of guests ''before their hostess'' for an impromptu post-opera gathering was "the most ''chic'' informality that it was possible to conceive."
*In the 1950s, [[Edith Head]] designed a classic dress, worn by [[Audrey Hepburn]] in the film [[Sabrina (1954 film)|''Sabrina'']] (1954), of which she remarked, "If it had been worn by somebody with no ''chic'' it would never have become a style."&lt;ref&gt;Ian Woodward (1984) ''Audrey Hepburn''&lt;/ref&gt;
*By the turn of the 21st century, the travel company [[Thomas Cook]] was advising those wishing to sample the nightlife of the sophisticated Mediterranean resort of [[Monte Carlo]] that "casual is fine (except at the Casino) but make it expensive, and very chic, casual if you want to blend in."&lt;ref&gt;Paul Medbourne (2006) ''City Spots: Monte Carlo''&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to American magazine ''[[Harper's Bazaar]]'' (referring to the "dramatic simplicity" of the day-wear of couturier [[Cristóbal Balenciaga]], 1895–1972), "elimination is the secret of chic."&lt;ref&gt;See ''New Yorker'', 3 July 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Daryl "Chill" Mitchell''' (born 16 July 1965)&lt;ref name="filmr"/&gt; is an American [[actor]]. He is known for such roles as Dexter Walker on ''[[The John Larroquette Show]]'', Tommy Webber in ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'', Leo Michaels on ''[[Veronica's Closet]]'', Eli Goggins III on ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]'', and Patton Plame on ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]''.
==Early life and career==
Mitchell was born in [[The Bronx]], [[New York (state)|New York]] to a secretary mother and a bus driver father.&lt;ref name="filmr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/62/Daryl-Mitchell.html|title=Daryl Mitchell Biography (1969-)|work=filmreference.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Wyandanch, New York|Wyandanch]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.people.com/people/archive/article/0,,20137620,00.html Moving Man - Personal Tragedy, Veronica's Closet, Coping and Overcoming Illness, Daryl Mitchell : People.com] Retrieved 2014-09-23.&lt;/ref&gt; After a career in [[Hip hop music|hip hop]] in the 1980s with ''Groove B. Chill'', Mitchell had considerable success as an actor, appearing in ''[[House Party (film)|House Party]]'' and its [[House Party 2|sequel]], ''[[Sgt. Bilko]]'', ''[[Galaxy Quest]]'', ''[[10 Things I Hate About You]]'', and the TV [[sitcom]]s ''[[The John Larroquette Show]]'' and ''[[Veronica's Closet]]''. He has also made appearances in the sitcom ''[[Becker (TV series)|Becker]]'', and in ''[[The Game (U.S. TV series)|The Game]]'' and ''[[Desperate Housewives]]''.  In 2009, he co-starred in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Brothers (2009 TV series)|Brothers]]''. Since 2014 he has guest-starred in ''[[NCIS: New Orleans]]'' as recurring-turned-main character Patton Plame, a computer specialist for NCIS.

In September 2009, Mitchell was profiled on [[TV One (US TV network)|TV One]]'s biographical documentary program ''Life After'', a series that examines the lives of celebrities following a career turning point.

==Personal life==
In November 2001, Mitchell was [[paralysis|paralyzed]] from the waist down in a [[motorcycle]] accident in [[South Carolina]]. "It was dark and I didn't know the roads really well," said Mitchell, "I went around a bend and on the other side there was gravel and loose pavement and bam, the bike shot right underneath me. I woke up five days later in the hospital." "It was a blessing," explained Mitchell, to have a friend, who was once shot in a random act of violence, be "one of the first people to show up at the hospital." Spending much time with him previously, doing things and going places, really helped Mitchell to better understand his circumstances.&lt;ref name="ABILITYMagazine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Daryl-Chill-Mitchell.html|title=Daryl "Chill" Mitchell|date=Aug–Sep 2010|publisher=ABILITY Magazine|accessdate=August 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mitchell got full support from his family and friends, including [[Denzel Washington]] and [[Chris Tucker]], to continue his career. Mitchell advises other wheelchair users to hold on to something they believe in. "You cannot do this by yourself. You need your family, your friends, faith, and love," he said.

After the accident, he appeared on the TV program ''[[Ed (TV series)|Ed]]'' between 2002 and 2004 as a [[bowling alley]] manager who was paralyzed after an accident similar to Mitchell's own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foxnews.com/story/0,2933,81160,00.html|title=Ed Star Daryl Mitchell on Rolling With Life's Punches|last=Straka|first=Mike |date=2003-03-13|publisher=foxnews.com|accessdate=2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later started the Daryl Mitchell Foundation to raise awareness of spinal cord injuries and serves as the Minority Outreach spokesman for the [[Christopher Reeve Foundation]]. He has also become a strong advocate for employing actors with disabilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Daryl-Chill-Mitchell.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Daryl "Chill" Mitchell"'' (2010)|accessdate=2012-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Mitchell resides in [[Sugar Hill, Georgia]]&lt;ref name="ABILITYMagazine"/&gt; with his wife and three children. His two sons play [[American football|football]] for [[North Gwinnett High School]], while his daughter also cheers for North Gwinnett High.&lt;ref name="filmr" /&gt; Mitchell won an [[National Association for the Advancement of Colored People|NAACP]] Image Award on February 26, 2010.

'''David David-Weill''' (1871-1952) was a French-American banker, chairman of Lazard Frères in Paris, who built an important collection of art.  His collection was plundered by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazis]] during the Second World War and over 2000 items seized. He was a major donor to French and American museums and galleries and a benefactor to universities.

==Early life and family==
David-Weill was born in San Francisco on 30 August 1871.&lt;ref name=dumb&gt;[http://www.doaks.org/resources/bliss-tyler-correspondence/annotations/david-david-weill David David-Weill.] Dumbarton Oaks. Retrieved 10 February 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; He was the son of Julie (née Cahn) and [[:fr:Alexandre Weill (banquier)]] (1834-1906). His father was a cousin to the three French Jewish brothers who founded [[Lazard Frères &amp; Co.]]. His parents had left France in 1870 because of the [[Franco-Prussian War]] and settled in California, where [[Raphael Weill]], a brother of Alexandre Weill lived. They returned to France about 1883. David-Weill continued his education there at the [[Lycée Condorcet]] and the [[École Libre des Sciences Politiques]]. He married Flora Raphael in 1897 and they had seven children, including [[Pierre David-Weill]] and [[Jean David-Weill]].

==Banking career==
Following his education, David-Weill performed his military service and began to work at Lazard Frères, where he rose to become chairman. He became regent of the [[Banque de France]] in 1935.

==Collecting==
David-Weill began to collect from an early age. His acquisitions included paintings, drawings, miniatures, sculpture, furniture, silverware and other items. He became president of the council of French national museums and vice president of the Friends of the Louvre.&lt;ref name=dumb/&gt;

His collection was looted by the Nazis during the Second World War and, according to German records, 2687 items seized.&lt;ref name=Harc&gt;Harclerode, Peter, &amp; Brendan Pittaway. (1999) ''The Lost Masters: The Looting of Europe's Treasurehouses''. London: [[Victor Gollancz]], p. 44. {{ISBN|0575052546}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life he donated more than 2000 items to museums and galleries, including the [[Guimet Museum]], the [[Louvre]], and universities at New York, Hamburg, Leiden, Honolulu, and Stockholm. He donated to the libraries of the Museum of Man and the National Institute of Art History, to which he gave the manuscript and journal of [[Eugène Delacroix]]. He gave his Chinese bronzes to the [[Musée Guimet]], and his  [[cloisonné]] objects to the Musée des Arts Décoratifs.&lt;ref name=dumb/&gt;

==Death==
David-Weill died in [[Neuilly-sur-Seine]] on 7 July 1952.&lt;ref name=dumb/&gt; Parts of his collection were sold in a series of auctions in 1970.

==Honours==
[[File:P1110765 Paris XIV avenue David-Weill rwk.JPG|thumbnail|Avenue David-Weill, Paris.]]
*David-Weill was elected to the [[Académie des beaux-arts]] in 1934.
*Avenue David-Weill in the [[14th arrondissement of Paris]] was named in his honour in 1960 in tribute to his involvement with the [[Cité internationale universitaire de Paris]].

'''Dragiša Stanisavljević''' was born in [[Jabučje]], near [[Lajkovac]], (May 25, 1921 - August 21, 2012) is an internationally known [[Serbia]]n [[naive art|naïve]] and [[outsider art|outsider]] [[sculptor]].

==Biography==
'''Dragiša Stanisavljević''' was born in [[Jabučje]], near [[Lajkovac]], on May 25, 1921). He began doing sculpture in 1958. The life in the village under [[patriarchal]] principles, century-old forests of his homeland certainly encouraged his impulse for freedom and modelling. He is an absolute [[self-taught]], with strong sense for the stylization of form. A farmer by trade, Stanisavljević began to do [[sculpture]] in [[wood]] in 1958. Stanisavljević died in his native [[Jabučje]] ([[Serbia]]), on August 21, 2012. He is a world classic.&lt;ref name="krstic1"&gt;N. Krstić, ''Outsider Art in Serbia'', [http://www.mnmu.rs MNMA], Јагодина, 2014, pp. 132-139&lt;/ref&gt;

==Artistic Style and Work==
Frontal aspect, [[simplicity]] of expression and archaic approach to form are unconsciously achieved. From black, age-old tree-trunks the artist liberated the form, polished it to brightness, imprisoned it and emphasized its organic essence, thus completing what the nature had begun. Everything is stylized nearly to the bare, basic primordial form, and reduced with the pronounced sense for measure, which was known only to authentic artists of [[primitive cultures]]. More than five-decade-long [[instinctive]] and [[creative work]] of this artist points to the force of his authentic and original forms and the connection between [[Primordialism|primordial]] and [[Modern art|modern]] [[sensibility]] of [[artistic expression]]. Age-old [[oak]] trunks which he tooled from the bed of the [[Kolubara River]] had a secret trace in its very substance, a kind of [[patina]]. With a pronounced sense of [[harmony]], without [[gestures]], expressive movements, but with interest in the [[Spirituality|spiritual]] background of his figures, Dragiša unconsciously understood the role of form in the achievement of the universal. [[Relief]]-like [[concept]] of form with pronounced vertical [[Composition (visual arts)|composition]] helped the artist with the simplicity of expression, especially when the selected motif was [[philosophical]] contemplation on [[human relationships]], destinies, hidden characteristics, sins or prayers. 
His works reflect the [[mythology]], [[folklore]] and [[legend]]s of his [[native land]].

'''Edith Melba Artois''' (Edith spelled Édith in French), also referred to as Madame Edith, is the fictional main antagonist character in the [[BBC]] sitcom ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=BBC Comedy: 'Allo 'Allo!|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/comedy/alloallo/|work=BBC|publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt; which ran from 1982 to 1992.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Artois|first=Edith|title=IMDB: Edith Artois (Character)|url=https://www.imdb.com/character/ch0030360/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t2|work=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt; The character was played by [[Carmen Silvera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Silvera|first=Carmen|title=IMDB: Carmen Silvera|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0798819/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cl_t2|work=IMDB}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Family ==

Little is known about Edith's family, except that she married childhood sweetheart [[Rene Artois]], aged 16. She is the only child of [[Madame Fanny La Fan|Fanny La Fan]], and her stepfather is [[Monsieur Ernest LeClerc|Ernest LeClerc]]. It is hinted at that either Ernest or his brother, [[Monsieur Roger LeClerc|Roger]] is her father. She loves Rene, but he prefers their waitresses/servants: [[Yvette Carte-Blanche|Yvette]], [[Maria Recamier|Maria]] and [[Mimi Labonq|Mimi]].

==Past life==
When '''Edith '''was a baby, Madame Fanny sent her to work at the Chateau as a serving girl, and she worked in the servant's quarters, where she discovered all the secret passageways. In her late teens-early twenties, she met Rene, started to court with him, and later married him.

==Personality==
Edith Melba Artois (née La Fan) is the wife (and subsequently, sister-in-law) of her husband [[René François Artois|René Artois]]. After Rene's 'execution' and fake death, she became the legal owner of the café, which gave her greater influence over her husband's actions than she had had before. She does however dream of the day when René will remarry her (as his own false twin brother).

Edith, despite being [[tone deaf]], fancies herself a [[cabaret]] singer, and insists on treating café customers to displays of her talents.  Her concerts usually clear the café; those who remain stuff cheese in their ears to muffle her wails.  While one of the waitresses, [[Mimi Labonq]], actually does have talent, Edith will not usually permit her to entertain the customers. Edith's singing is so horrible that she has shattered glass, in one duet, she made every dog in the town howl, and to prevent Rene from being killed by several Resistance girls who were going to shoot him as a collaborator. She has no problem with the waitresses taking favoured customers upstairs, though.

Edith is a very jealous wife, and will become angry and suspicious of Rene whenever he is near other women. However she is very easy to hoodwink, whenever she catches her husband in a clinch with one of the waitresses, she swallows whatever transparent lies Rene chooses to tell her. Since she is thought to be a widow, she occasionally has suitors of her own, who flatter her enormously. They include [[Monsieur Alfonse]], the local undertaker; and 
[[Captain Alberto Bertorelli|Bertorelli]], an Italian captain. Edith's relationship with Rene himself can be quite contradictory at times, at one point she was quite ready to commit a suicide bombing to save Rene from the Germans and on other occasions is quite eager to see Rene die in some heroic manner so she can be considered the widow of a great man.

Edith appeared in the pilot episode and every subsequent episode. She is sometimes the butt of several jokes about her [[looks]] and exaggerating her [[ageing|age]]. Her age was at one point suggested to be over a hundred years old as she claimed she entertained soldiers returning from War and Rene riposte'd that it was during the [[Crimean War]].

==Character development==

===First appearance===
Madame Édith attempts to sing in her café, to no avail. Later, she delivers a message to René. Her mother upstairs, [[Madame Fanny La Fan]], interrupts during the radio transmission.

Édith's [[Accent (dialect)|accent]] is greatly exaggerated in this episode. It nearly bears no resemblance to the voice she quipped in later episodes. Also, she is less of a pushover.

===Subsequent episodes===
Edith is later shown to be adopted, that Madame Fanny is not her birth mother. Edith was delivered to Madame Fanny in a basket. She could also have been a [[Romani people|gypsy]] princess: a Gypsy read her palm, and all clues pointed to her being a long lost princess. However, none of the Gypsies could take her voice, so they forced her away.

===Last appearance===
She appears on the last episode of ''[['Allo 'Allo!]]''. After the war, now aged, she was confined to a bed and has adopted several of her mother's mannerisms. When René elopes with his Waitress/Mistress [[Yvette Carte-Blanche]], she is left alone in Nouvion.

'''Elena Sánchez Valenzuela''' (1900&amp;ndash;1950) was one of the first Mexican silent film stars, was a journalist, and created the Mexican film archive. In addition, she was an ardent feminist and suffragette.

==Biography==
Valenzuela was born on 2 March 1900 in [[Mexico City]], Mexico&lt;ref name="birth/death dates"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elena Sánchez Valenzuela|url=http://cinemexicano.mty.itesm.mx/estrellas/elena_sanchez.html|website=Cine Mexicano|publisher=Cine Mexicano|accessdate=24 July 2015|location=Mexico|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; to journalist Abraham Sánchez Arce&lt;ref name="women in film" /&gt; and Juana Valenzuela.&lt;ref name=parents&gt;{{cite news|last1=Morales Valentine|first1=Emilio|title=Pugnan porque se le dé su lugar a la primera ?Santa?|url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/espectaculos/4492.html|accessdate=24 July 2015|publisher=El Universal|date=6 March 2000|location=Mexico City, Mexico|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was still a student at the [[Conservatorio Nacional de Música (Mexico)|National Conservatory of Music]] when she made her film debut in ''[[Barranca trágica]]'' (1917). The following year, she was chosen to star in the first film adaptation of [[Federico Gamboa]]'s 1902 novel, ''[[Santa (1918 film)|Santa]]'' (1918). The silent film was produced by [[Germán Camus]], directed by [[Luis G. Peredo]]&lt;ref name="Silent career"&gt;{{cite web|title=Efemérides del Periodismo Mexicano: Elena Sánchez Valenzuela|url=http://imgayuq.cambiodigital.com.mx/mosno.php?nota=217293#.VbGf4fm2oVI|website=Imgayuq|publisher=Cambio Digital|accessdate=24 July 2015|location=Veracruz, México|language=Spanish|date=30 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; It would establish a formula that prevailed in Mexico until the 1940s,&lt;ref name="women in film"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Torres San Martín|first1=Patricia|title=Elena Sánchez Valenzuela|url=https://wfpp.cdrs.columbia.edu/pioneer/ccp-elena-sanchez-valenzuela/|website=Women Film Pioneers Project|publisher=Columbia University Libraries|accessdate=24 July 2015|location=New York, NY|date=27 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; the theme of the "noble prostitute", a girl typically living in urban slums, caught in the trap of the onset of modernity and industrialization.&lt;ref name="Callahan (2010)"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Callahan|first1=Vicki|title=Reclaiming the archive: feminism and film history|date=2010|publisher=Wayne State University Press|location=Detroit|isbn=978-0-814-33300-6|url=https://books.google.com.mx/books?id=sNaLYKGNWAwC&amp;pg=PA329&amp;lpg=PA329|accessdate=24 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Santa'', after a young peasant girl named Santa is seduced and abandoned by a soldier, the affair is discovered by her family and she is banished. She relocates to Mexico City and turns to prostitution to support herself. The film premiered on 13 July 1918 and was a sensational hit.&lt;ref name="Silent career" /&gt;

In 1919 she starred in another film directed by Peredo, ''[[La llaga]]'' and in 1920 made ''[[El escándalo (1920 film)|El escándalo]]'' under the direction of [[Alfredo B. Cuellar]]. At the same time she was making films, Sánchez was mirroring her father's career as a journalist and had become a correspondent for ''El Demócrata''.&lt;ref name="women in film" /&gt; In August 1920, she was sent to Los Angeles, California&lt;ref name="transit to Los Angeles"&gt;{{cite web|title=Immigration Arrival Manifests and Indexes|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:KXFC-Y1C|website=Family Search|publisher=National Archives and Records Administration|accessdate=24 July 2015|location=Eagle Pass, Texas|date=8 August 1920}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a correspondent for ''El Demócrata''. While she was in the US, Sánchez won a contest organized by a local newspaper to promote her acting career and meet Hollywood personalities at publicity events at places like as [[Grauman’s Chinese Theatre]]. She was offered a role in ''Almas que sufren'', but the film project was abandoned and Sánchez returned to Mexico.&lt;ref name="women in film" /&gt;

1921 brought her most acclaimed role, in ''[[En la hacienda]]'', which  premiered at [[Chapultepec Castle]] for President [[Álvaro Obregón]]. It was screened in 20 theaters and was declared the year's best motion picture. Like "Santa" before it, the film fostered an iconic genre, the rural melodrama, which typically featured poor, indigenous rural suffering.&lt;ref name="women in film" /&gt; It would be her last role, as her father ordered her to end her career,&lt;ref name=parents /&gt; which she had undertaken without his authorization as a minor.&lt;ref name=unauthorized&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lamas|first1=Marta|title=Miradas feministas sobre las mexicanas del siglo xx|url=http://ces.colmex.mx/pdfs/gabriela/Las%20mujeres%20en%20el%20M%C3%A9xico%20del%20siglo%20XX.%20Una%20cronolog%C3%ADa%20m%C3%ADninma.pdf|website=Conaculta|publisher=Consejo Nacional Para la Cultura y las Arte|accessdate=24 July 2015|location=Mexico City, Mexico|language=Spanish|date=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1922, she began writing a column in ''El Universal Gráfico'' called “El cine y sus artistas" (Cinema and Its Artists) and in 1929, she moved to Paris as a news correspondent for the next four years, returning to Mexico in the 1930s to work at ''El Día''.&lt;ref name="women in film" /&gt;

In 1936 Sánchez began working on a project called "Brigadas Cinematográficas" requested by President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]]. The film which she photographed and directed was a sound documentary about the state of [[Michoacán]] and was praised for its artistic and historic worth, depicting rural life in the western state. The film was feature-length and its contract stated that it could not be shown commercially.&lt;ref name="women in film" /&gt; Throughout the 1930s she visited the film library of the Cine Club in Mexico City and lobbied for the creation of a functional and archival Cinematography Department of the Ministry of Education.&lt;ref name="Mex Film Archive"&gt;{{cite web|title=Elena Sánchez Valenzuela, pionera de los archivos fílmicos en México |url=http://www.mexfilmarchive.com/documents/elena_se1nchez_valenzuela.html |website=Mex Film Archive |publisher=Mex Film Archive |accessdate=24 July 2015 |location=Mexico City, Mexico |language=Spanish |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150724041331/http://www.mexfilmarchive.com/documents/elena_se1nchez_valenzuela.html |archivedate=24 July 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Finally in 1942, she was successful and the Filmoteca Nacional (Mexican National Film Library) became a reality, when President [[Manuel Ávila Camacho]] not only authorized its creation&lt;ref name=authorization&gt;{{cite web|title=Elena Sánchez Valenzuela|url=http://sic.conaculta.gob.mx/ficha.php?table=cineasta&amp;table_id=331|website=Sistema de Información CONACULTA|publisher=Secretaría de Educación Pública|accessdate=24 July 2015|location=Mexico City, Mexico|language=Spanish|date=27 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but gave her the responsibility for promotion of archival preservation.&lt;ref name="women in film" /&gt;

Sánchez began traveling the country in 1944 in an attempt to collect films, as only a few governmental agencies had sent in films. She visited with public agencies as well as private individuals and companies trying to convince them to archive copies of their films for preservation.&lt;ref name="Mex Film Archive" /&gt; By 1947, the archive had been assigned to [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]]&lt;ref name=UNAM&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zweig|first1=Noah|title=Algunos Aspectos del Filmoteca de la UNAM|url=http://www.tft.ucla.edu/mediascape/Spring05_AlgunosAspectos.html|website=Mediascape|publisher=UCLA|accessdate=24 July 2015|location=Los Angeles, California|date=Fall 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Sánchez began traveling throughout Latin America to urge film preservation. On one trip, she represented the Film Archive at the [[Primer Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres]] held in [[Guatemala City]], Guatemala where the women were discussing enfranchisement, employment protections, as well as world affairs.&lt;ref name="Flores Asturias"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Flores Asturias|first1=Ricardo|title=Las Mujeres no Votan Porque Sí: Congreso Interamericano de Mujeres, 1947|url=http://politicaysentidocomun.blogspot.com/2011/06/las-mujeres-no-votan-porque-si-congreso.html|website=Politica y Sentido Comun|publisher=Ricardo Flores Asturias|accessdate=19 June 2015|location=Guatemala City, Guatemala|language=Spanish|date=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1948, she was traveling through Argentina and Uruguay giving lectures on the Mexican film industry and her preservation work at the National Film Archive.&lt;ref name="Mex Film Archive" /&gt;

She died on 30 September 1950 in Mexico City.&lt;ref name="Silent career" /&gt;

New Zealand's '''Fortune Theatre''' lays claim to being the world's southernmost professional theatre company and is the sole professional theatre group in [[Dunedin]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dunedinentertainment.co.nz/fortunetheatre FortuneTheatre – DunedinEnternatinment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100525014345/http://dunedinentertainment.co.nz/fortunetheatre |date=25 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a regular host of both local and touring shows.

The Fortune Theatre building is registered as a category I historic place by [[Heritage New Zealand]], which recognises its historic and architectural significance.&lt;ref name=architecture&gt;{{cite web | title=Architecture| url=http://www.fortunetheatre.co.nz/historical_information/architecture | publisher=Fortune Theatre  | accessdate=12 April 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100513200514/http://fortunetheatre.co.nz/historical_information/architecture |archivedate=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is located on the corner of [[Moray Place, Dunedin|Moray Place]] and Upper Stuart Street, in the heart of the southern city of Dunedin.

Financial difficulties in 2000 threatened the theatre with closure, and forced the sale of the building to the [[Dunedin City Council]]. The council currently leases the building back to the Fortune Theatre Trust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Dunedin's sole theatre in danger|url=http://www.nzherald.co.nz/section/1/story.cfm?c_id=1&amp;objectid=3610988|work=The New Zealand Herald|accessdate=11 April 2008|date=17 November 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |date=December 2003|title=A look at the multi-million dollar contribution of City Property|journal=City Talk|pages=9|url=http://www.cityofdunedin.com/city/?MIvalObj=citytalk_december2003_preservh&amp;MItypeObj=application/pdf&amp;ext=.pdf|accessdate= 11 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre announced its closure on 1 May 2018, again citing financial difficulties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/news/dunedin/fortune-theatre-closes|title=Fortune Theatre closes|date=1 May 2018|work=Otago Daily Times Online News|access-date=30 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
The Fortune Theatre company was co-founded by David Carnegie, Alex Gilchrist, Murray Hutchinson and Huntly Elliot. The company has been operational since 1973 and from 1974, was initially located in the 105-seat Otago Cine Club [[theatrette]] at the rear of the Athenaeum building of the Octagon. However, after hiring full-time acting staff in 1977, it was decided that the venue was too small to continue to be viable. Since 1978, the Fortune Theatre has been located in the former Trinity Methodist Church which was opened in 1870 and is close to the city's centre, [[The Octagon, Dunedin|The Octagon]].&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;

== Education ==
The Fortune Theatre provides a range of options for schools such as tours around the theatre, and opportunities to talk to the cast and crew of a production.

It also offers education workshops which are show-specific. The workshops are designed to link to a range of subjects in the New Zealand Curriculum, including [[National Certificate of Educational Achievement|NCEA]] achievement standards in subjects such as Drama at NCEA levels 1–3.

In addition, the Fortune Theatre hosts a drama ambassador programme to engage students with the theatre by offering opportunities to attend rehearsals as well as complimentary tickets to the shows with the condition recipients review each production. This programme began in 2005 with 19 schools in the [[Otago]] and [[Southland, New Zealand|Southland]] region areas of New Zealand. Each school can nominate one or two students per term to be their "Drama Ambassador".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fortunetheatre.co.nz/education Education – FortuneTheatre.co.nz]&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Larnach – Castle of Lies"==
In 1994, the Fortune Theatre performed a play about the tragedies of [[William Larnach]]'s family, titled "Larnach – Castle of Lies", before 100 invited guests in the ballroom of [[Larnach Castle]].&lt;ref name=play&gt;{{cite web | title=Larnach Castle at Tvnz.co.nz | url=http://tvnz.co.nz/view/page/411424/597703 | publisher=One News | date=July 2005 | accessdate=12 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
"It was a night to remember. As the guests arrived a terrible storm blew up from nowhere. The smoke from the fires blew back down the chimneys so that you couldn't see – and your eyes hurt. Hail crashed on the iron roof so that you couldn't hear. Doors mysteriously opened by themselves and it got very cold. In the play – just as Larnach shot himself there was a blinding white light. Afterwards at supper people were talking about the lightning strike as Larnach held the gun to his head. I said `Oh no that was stage effects.' We asked the stage manager. He said `It was none of our doing, it was lightning.' I think that Larnach was present that night. He didn't like the play."&lt;br&gt;
:-- Margeret Barker (Co-owner of Larnch Castle)&lt;ref name=play /&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

== Building architecture ==
The Trinity Methodist Church was designed by [[Scotland|Scotsman]] [[R. A. Lawson]] and made out of the local materials trachyandesite and [[Oamaru]] stone. The former church is an example of [[Gothic Revival architecture]] and contains a "Rose" [[stained glass]] window which is located at the back of what is now the theatre's main stage.&lt;ref name=architecture /&gt;

== ''Ghost Hunt'' ==
In 2005, the theatre was featured on ''[[Ghost Hunt (NZ TV series)|Ghost Hunt]]'', a New Zealand television show, as it is claimed that the theatre is haunted. Not long after the Fortune Theatre moved into the old church, tales spread of "sinister voices" being heard offstage and well-secured lights falling from the lighting grid. A phantom audience member has also been reported by theatregoers on numerous occasions. Reports continued to come from a variety of reliable sources until the claimed hauntings of the Fortune Theatre became a part of Dunedin folklore.

The Ghost Hunt investigation team visited the theatre and were shown a picture that is claimed to show the ghost of a young woman gliding through a wall of the [[foyer]], below a Gothic window. During the investigation team's visit, they were also able to talk to people who had worked at the theatre and claim to have had [[paranormal]] experiences in the building:

A [[lighting technician]] claimed that he was all alone setting up on stage one day when he "glimpsed a person" over his shoulder on the edge of the stage and thought that "they were reading through some lines, as an actor would" but knew no cast members were around at the time. He turned the stage lights on and "suddenly they were gone".

A man who ran the box office claimed to have had two "disconcerting" experiences. The first experience involved a "young boy sitting in the corner". He initially "thought nothing of it" but the "realisation struck" him that the theatre was closed. He "turned back around, but he'd disappeared." The second experience involved a girl he claims he noticed when he "looked up to the back corner of the audience seating, near where the soundman usually sits" after he heard "a strange noise in the theatre" on one occasion.&lt;ref&gt;Ghost Hunt: True New Zealand Ghost Stories {{ISBN|0-7900-1012-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3453">{{Situationists}}

The '''Golden Fleet''' ({{lang-sv|Gyllene Flottan}}) was a minor left-wing group in [[Sweden]], existing during the end of the 1960s and the beginning of the 1970s. It was ideologically aligned with the [[Situationist International]], an [[avant-garde]] revolutionary movement. The Situationists, whose intellectual foundations were derived primarily from [[libertarian Marxism]] and the avant-garde art movements of the early 20th century (particularly [[Dada]] and [[Surrealism]]),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Plant|first=Sadie|date=1992|title=The Most Radical Gesture|url= |location=[[New York City]]|publisher=Routledge|page= |isbn=978-0-415-06222-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; initially put its emphasis on concepts like [[unitary urbanism]] and [[psychogeography]]. Gradually the focus moved more towards revolutionary and political theory. Much like the main organ of that particular ideological current, the Situationist International, the Golden Fleet had its heyday around the [[protests of 1968]], gradually disappearing by the first years of the 1970s.

Extremely little is known about the Golden Fleet, yet still it became notorious, this to such an extent that it has been labelled "legendary".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Edin|first=Fredrik|date=6 September 2013|title=Den siste situationisten|url=http://arbetaren.se/artiklar/den-sista-situationisten/|newspaper=[[Arbetaren]]|language=Swedish|location=[[Stockholm]]|publisher=[[Central Organisation of the Workers of Sweden]]|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nothing is known about its establishment, composition, and disestablishment. The name was most likely taken from an art exhibit in [[Denmark]] by the Situationist [[Jeppesen Victor Martin]], which consisted of geopolitical paintings featuring coastlines, strategic arrows and toy battleships sprayed over with metallic paint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Slater|first=Howard|date=2001|title=Divided We Stand - An Outline of Scandinavian Situationism|url= |location=[[London]]|publisher=Infopool|page= |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group was centered in the capital [[Stockholm]], although some members appear to have been from [[Gothenburg]]. It is primarily notable through the fact that its members were those that introduced situationist writings to Sweden by its brief but hectic work with publishing political texts. Among them were ''Instruktion i vapendragning'' in 1970 (a translation of "Instructions for an Insurrection", originally published 1961), as well as longer translations of texts by [[Guy Debord]] and [[Raoul Vaneigem]] among others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hyllienmark|first=Olov|date=10 October 1997|title=Jakten på Gyllene Flottan|newspaper=Känguru|language=Swedish|location= |publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The group also produced a number of works on its own, prominent among them the poster "Hang the [[Stalinism|Stalinists]] High" ({{lang-sv|Häng stalinisterna högt}}, on the subject of the contemporary left-wing) and the brochure "King [[Gustaf V of Sweden|Gustaf's]] Sardines" ({{lang-sv|Kung Gustafs sardiner}}) which discussed the "meaningful meaninglessness of the Swedish students". Another Situationist group existed in Sweden, the [[Second Situationist International]] of [[Jørgen Nash]], but there appears to have been no connection between the Golden Fleet and the Nashists.

'''Highbury Theatre''' is a [[amateur theatre|non-professional theatre]] situated in the Royal Town of [[Sutton Coldfield]], [[Birmingham]], [[England]]. It is one of the oldest, established amateur theatres in the city and a founding member of the [[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]].

== Origins ==
[[File:Highbury Theatre, Boldmere - geograph.org.uk - 1599272.jpg|thumb|left|Highbury Theatre]]
Conceived in 1924 by Bertie English, the theatre originally started life as a simple play reading group, under the name, The Erdington ILP Play-reading Circle. As the members passion developed from just reading plays together, they began to start producing and acting in various productions. On 5 March 1925, they performed their first stage production of ''Little Sins and Pretty Sinners'' at the Folkhouse, [[Erdington]]. In 1928, a 17-year-old [[John English (theatre director)|John English]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Midland+Arts+Centre+and+Highbury+Theatre+founder%3B+OBITUARY.-a060547538 |title=Midland Arts Centre and Highbury Theatre founder; OBITUARY. - Free Online Library |publisher=Thefreelibrary.com |date=1999-01-01 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; took over from his father as the Director of the company. Rehearsals would often be held at his home which was named, ''Highbury''. Subsequently, in that same year, the group chose to rename themselves after their rehearsal space and became; The Highbury Players. Due to no theatre of their own, the company were still having to produce plays in local church halls until 1935.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/birmingham/stage/venues/g_m/highbury.shtml |title=Birmingham Stage - The Highbury Little Theatre |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mollie Randle &amp; Noel Sherwood|title=Highbury Theatre Centre: Sixteen Years After|year=1963|publisher=Highbury Theatre Centre.|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In hope more than expectation they set up a building fund and began to search for premises.

[[File:The_original_Highbury_Theatre.jpg|thumb|right|The original theatre (right) and building next door later purchased]] But it was in 1937, that they purchased the freehold site on Sheffield Road from Rhonda Anstey (of [[Anstey College of Physical Education]]), using an existing World War I mission chapel (once used as a hospital for World War I veterans) as the basis for their new theatre, at a cost of just over £200.&lt;ref&gt;http://highburytheatre.co.uk/ahlt/history.html&lt;/ref&gt; Using this basic structure they built, almost entirely on their own, their own theatre. Members learnt new skills on site first hand, to build brick walls, plastering, joinery, electrics, metalwork and much more, pulling together to create a theatre of their own. They worked both night and day during the early years of the Second World War to complete it. When the war broke out in 1939 most of the work was undertaken by the female members. It was through dedication and without financial aid or patronage; that the theatre was constructed, along with its traditions which helped to lay the foundations of what it eventually became. The original theatre seats were donated to the theatre when the then newly refurbished Prince of Wales theatre in the City Centre was bombed during an air raid, some of the seats still proudly bore the bomb splinters. When building work was completed, the new building was christened; Highbury Little Theatre.

Highbury Little Theatre officially opened on 22 May 1942&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/theatres/show/627-highbury-little-theatre |title=Highbury Little Theatre |publisher=The Theatres Trust |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Arms and the Man]]'' and has since then continually produced a season of plays for the last 7 decades. The theatre and its programme are constantly being revised and  adjusted&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assets.openlylocal.com/planning_applications/1940147-Planning-Application-2012-04495-PA-Highbury-Theatre-Centre-Sheffie- |title=Planning Application 2012/04495/PA, Highbury Theatre Centre Sheffie... :: Birmingham City Council :: Openly Local |publisher=Assets.openlylocal.com |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140521065909/http://assets.openlylocal.com/planning_applications/1940147-Planning-Application-2012-04495-PA-Highbury-Theatre-Centre-Sheffie- |archivedate=2014-05-21 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a 21st Century theatregoing audience.

It was in 1946 that John English who, along with other theatre directors around the country, had the vision to form the [[Little Theatre Guild of Great Britain]] of which Highbury was a founder member, alongside The [[Crescent Theatre]] and [[The Questors Theatre]] with 6 other theatre companies. The early years of the twentieth century saw the beginning of the "little theatre" movement, whereby small, independent  theatres ran on an unpaid basis providing theatre to their local areas. In January 1949, Highbury hosted its first Guild National Conference with an increased number of 14 member theatres. From the 9 original members, the LTG now have over 100 member theatres. English consequently went on to co-found The [[Midlands Arts Centre]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://macbirmingham.co.uk/about/history/ |title=History |publisher=mac birmingham |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://secure.thebiggive.org.uk/charity/view/4095/mac-birmingham |title=mac birmingham &amp;#124; The Big Give |publisher=Secure.thebiggive.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Arena Theatre Company&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.search.connectinghistories.org.uk/engine/resource/default.asp?theme=49&amp;originator=%2Fengine%2Ftheme%2Fdefault.asp&amp;page=&amp;records=&amp;direction=&amp;pointer=61&amp;text=1&amp;resource=1726 |title=Proposal for a Midlands Arts Centre for Young People |publisher=Search.connectinghistories.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; along with his wife Mollie Randle.

The Theatre was fortunate enough to have amongst its Patrons the founder of [[The Birmingham Rep]]; [[Barry Jackson (director)|Sir Barry Jackson]], the actor [[Sir Cedric Hardwicke]] and MP [[Sir John Mellor, 2nd Baronet]] alongside fifteen other influential people in both the local and theatrical communities.

During the 1980s major alterations and extensions took place. This was possible due to the acquisition of an old shop next door, which was incorporated into the theatre allowing the theatre to expand and add more facilities to a much better equipped theatre. During this period, the theatre's executive body also purchased land and houses that surrounded the theatre, as a result they could, and still remain able to, rent out the houses/apartments with the funds being used to support the theatre and allowing it to produce more challenging plays without the fear of making losses.

In 2008, the decision was made that the theatre change its name for the second time in its history, this time changing it to; Highbury Theatre Centre. This was primarily due to the fact that the theatre had been expanding over the years offering more than just theatre and offering more facilities to the community, essentially making it a [[community theatre]]. In 2018 as part of a marketing revamp, the theatre slightly edited its name once more, to the more to the point, Highbury Theatre.

== Plays ==

The theatre's resident company remains, The Highbury Players who during the course of a 10-month season; put on 7 Main Stage productions and 3 Studio plays.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bdtg.magix.net/index_htm_files/Highbury.pdf |title=Birmingham and district theatre guild: group members' profile |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The plays are chosen by an elected Arts Committee led by the Arts Director and aim to continue the Highbury tradition of having within every season; an English Classic, an International Classic and a play connecting the theatre with our own times, amongst both classic and contemporary plays. The theatre is one of two major [[amateur]] companies that operate in the Sutton Coldfield area, the other being Sutton Arts Theatre who have close ties with Highbury both historically and personally.

All plays staged at the theatre are reviewed by the online reviewers ''Behind the Arras''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.behindthearras.com/reviewsam/reviews_by_affiliates.html#HIGHBURY |title=Reviews By Affiliates |publisher=Behindthearras.com |date=1916-07-17 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; who employ retired, professional theatre journalists to critique each production. Each year, plays and performances are nominated for the BFAME Awards. This is a ceremony held with all the nominated amateur theatres in the city and in which Highbury has either received a nomination in a certain category or won every year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mail |first=Birmingham |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/your-communities-theatre-gongs-sutton-6766029|title=Your Communities: Theatre Gongs |publisher=Birmingham Mail | date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-05-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 2014 it was announced that Highbury would be working in partnership with [[Birmingham Town Hall]] and [[Symphony Hall, Birmingham|Symphony Hall]] (THSH) to support community arts as Birmingham City Council Arts Champions for the Sutton Coldfield District.&lt;ref&gt;http://suttoncoldfieldlocal.co.uk/thsh-arts-champions-1221446/&lt;/ref&gt;

== Opportunities ==

The theatre is a registered charity&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://opencharities.org/charities/223923 |title=Highbury Theatre Centre Limited |publisher=OpenCharities |date=2013-11-10 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and is run entirely by a 160+ team of dedicated volunteers who are involved in many aspects from [[acting]], [[Theatre director|directing]], [[set design]], [[costume]], [[front of house]] amongst numerous other opportunities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avenueq.org/the-venue.aspx |title=The Venue - Avenue Q at The Highbury Theatre Centre |publisher=Avenueq.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140809100607/http://avenueq.org/the-venue.aspx |archivedate=2014-08-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre welcomes newcomers allowing them to get involved in all areas, such as helping out as a costumer in their extensive wardrobe departments or by helping construct some of their award-winning sets.

The theatre is a valuable asset to the local and wider community; with various events and art exhibitions&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mail |first=Birmingham |url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/news/local-news/artist-to-exhibit-work-at-highbury-theatre-60239 |title=Artist to exhibit work at Highbury Theatre Centre |publisher=Birmingham Mail |date=2008-03-18 |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; taking place there throughout the year. In late 2013, the theatre decided to resurrect one of the original theatre's features from 1943 to 1956, the Highbury Film Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://highburytheatre.co.uk/ahlt/0htc/filmclub.html |title=Highbury Little Theatre - Sutton Coldfield. Youth Theatre |publisher=Highburytheatre.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working alongside the [[British Film Institute]] and the [[British Federation of Film Societies]]. The original club was known for showing [[Experimental film]]s and [[Art film|arthouse]] films from around the world, which they have now reintroduced alongside classic films. The new, reinstated film club became a permanent fixture in 2014, now being included in all the theatre's future seasons.

== Other facilities ==

The theatre is also home to Highbury Youth Theatre, which gives local children the chance to experience performing on stage, in front of a live audience, as well as developing their skills and confidence. Members are given the opportunity to work towards [[LAMDA]] examinations should they wish and have access to the National Association of Youth Theatres' workshops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=MDK Web &amp; Media Ltd. |url=http://www.nayt.org.uk/youth_theatres/highbury_youth_theatre |title=Youth Theatre: Youth Theatre: Highbury Youth Theatre - Highbury Youth Theatre - National Association of Youth Theatres |publisher=Nayt.org.uk |date= |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre is one of very few amateur societies that has its own premises, doing so enables the theatre to be able to provide more amenities to both members and audiences. It has its own bar, coffee lounge, 3 large dressing rooms, communal [[green room]], vast wardrobe departments, in house set building workshops, rehearsal rooms, props department, furniture store and much more. It is by having such facilities that the theatre and its equipment is available for hire by external companies who are without places to rehearse and stage their own productions.

On 29 April 2014, the theatre commemorated the 90th anniversary of the formation of The ILP Play reading circle, by having a special reading of two of the first plays ever performed by them back in 1924 when the company simply read the plays. The plays, by [[John Drinkwater (playwright)|John Drinkwater]], included; ''The Storm'' and ''X=0''. On 5 March 2015, the theatre celebrated the 90th anniversary of The Highbury Players first ever stage production. At the event, rare unseen film footage was shown of the original members building the first theatre.

'''Ilija Bašičević''', later '''Ilija "Bosilj" Bašičević''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Илија Башичевић Босиљ}}; [[Šid]], July 18, 1895 - May 14, 1972) was a [[painter]]; a classic of [[Serbia]]n [[outsider art]].

==Biography==
Bašičević was born in Šid, which was part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] and is now in [[Serbia]] and died in 1972 in Šid. His parents were [[peasant]] [[farmers]]&lt;ref name="gseart.com"&gt;[http://www.gseart.com/artists.asp?ArtistID=682 Ilija Bosilj Basicevic at Galerie St. Etienne&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; and he only received about four years of school before starting work on the farm. He left the country during both [[World War I]] to escape [[conscription]] and during [[World War II]] to avoid the [[Ustaše]]. He resisted [[collective farming]] and was periodically jailed on dubious charges by the political police. He began doing painting in 1957. His first major showing was at a [[Belgrade]] gallery in 1963, and was very controversial because of Bašičeviċ's political stance. The painter took the surname "Bosilj" as a [[pseudonym]] for the showings. From the 1960s to the 1980s, his work was popular in [[Europe]], often showcased in [[Zagreb]] and [[Belgrade]] but also [[Amsterdam]] and [[Paris]]. He donated his collection of paintings as the legacy to his native town. He died in Šid in 1972.
Ilija Bašičeviċ's son [[Dimitrije Bašičević]] was an [[art critic]] and became involved in a "[[naïve art]]"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mbasicevic.net/mangelos_biography.html mangelos biography&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; movement started by the [[USSR]] which rejected "decadent" [[modernism]], and the father was inspired to paint. His son disapproved at first, because Ilija's work was not as precise or refined as the official Hlebene School's [[Reverse painting on glass]] techniques.
Bašičeviċ's work is partially [[Outsider Art|art brut]] and partially [[naïve art]] and most of his work is oil on canvas.&lt;ref name="gseart.com"/&gt;  Much of his work dealt with religion and folk legends and two-headed and two-faced creatures are a common theme. Unlike the traditional peasant style of his region, Bosilj created a flat two-dimensional world often inhabited by men and demons, snakes, fish, anthropomorphic creatures and spacemen.&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.rawvision.com/books/outsider-art-sourcebook Outsider Art Sourcebook]'', ed. John Maizels, Raw Vision, Watford, 2009, p.51&lt;/ref&gt;  He gave many of his paintings to found an art museum in his home town in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.basicevic.net/ilijanum.html Ilija Basicevic - Bosilj | Ilijanum&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Artistic Style ==
Ilija’s oeuvre can be classified into a few thematic units. Most numerous are the presentations of the Biblical, especially Old Testament motifs. Then the motifs inspired by epics, legends and myths followed. In the Iliad Cycle, which has nothing in common with the famous Homer’s epic but is related to the painter’s name, the artistic allusions to the real world and his fights against human foolishness, duplicity and hypocrisy are often. Then, he portrays the cycle with figures of real and imaginary animals. A significant part of his oeuvre includes the flying astrological beings. Ilija’s works are not descriptive, but are allegorical with multi-layered and symbolical context. He does not make difference between the presentation of an apocalyptic angel or modern astronaut, kings of Apocalypse and kings of Iliad, between a simple and an apocalyptic bird etc. Ilija creates the anti-illusionistic, the abstract. He does not use perspective; he eliminates reminiscences; he generalizes and prefigures by using symbols. Two-headed beings denote the duplicity of everything presented. In Biblical scenes or Serbian myths, legends and epics, the dynamics and morale prevail, while in scenes from Iliad we find humor, irony and grotesque. In these presentations, the artist tried to demythologize Biblical heroes and historical characters. His works are not descriptive, since they are the product of a self-taught visionary and instinctive neo-primitive. He most often used allegory with a multi-layered connotation. The mere names of his paintings, like in Sekulić and Jakić, help us to get acquainted with his world full of personal symbolism. He created in anti-illusionist and abstract manner, eliminated reminiscences and generalized due to his purely authentic understanding of the realistic. Ilija’s dynamic treatment of the colored structure points to outstandingly modern dimension of his pictorial expression. The backgrounds in his paintings are often empty and flat, while rhythmically sequenced figures are floating, animated with wavy lines. The colour is raw, of visible ductus. Golden background is characteristic in the paintings of the special cycle.&lt;ref&gt;N. Krstić, ''Outsider Art in Serbia'', MNMA, Јагодина, 2014, pp. 56-63&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibitions and awards ==
He had exhibitions in the country and abroad and was awarded many times. He is the greatest representative of art brut in Serbia. On the Third Triennial of Naive Art in Bratislava in 1972, Ilija was posthumously awarded special recognition by an international Jury for his achievements in the domain of naïve and marginal art. The greatest collection of his paintings is in the [http://www.mnuilijanum.rs/ Museum Ilijanum], in Šid (Serbia). He is a worldly classic.

The '''Institute of Art and Ideas'''&lt;ref&gt;https://iai.tv/about-iai/introducing-iai&lt;/ref&gt; is an arts organisation founded in 2008 in London. Its programming includes the world's largest philosophy and music festival, [[HowTheLightGetsIn]]&lt;ref name="iai"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iai.tv/about-iai/introducing-iai |title=Introducting the IAI. |publisher=Institute of Art and Ideas |date= |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the online channel [https://iai.tv/player IAI TV], where talks and debates can be accessed for free, under the slogan "Philosophy for our times."&lt;ref name="iai"/&gt;

The IAI's main offering, [[HowTheLightGetsIn]], is held annually in [[Hay-on-Wye]] at the globe at Hay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globeathay.org/about-us/ |title=About the globe. |publisher=The globe at Hay |date= |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IAI is led by its founding director, the British post-realist philosopher and former broadcaster [[Hilary Lawson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://iai.tv/home/host/hilary-lawson |title=Hilary Lawson: Profile. |publisher=Institute of Art and Ideas |date= |accessdate=2016-01-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==IAI TV==

IAI TV is an online channel where the debates and talks curated by the IAI are released and made available online. Subjects include philosophy, science, politics and art.

In September 2016 the videos had received in excess of 670,000 views, reaching over 1,000,000 people each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walesartsreview.org/interview-hilary-lawson-director-of-how-the-light-gets-in/ |title=Interview: Hilary Lawson, Director of How the Light Gets In. |publisher=Wales Art Review |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hilary Lawson in an interview in 2014: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;"One of the things we're up to is breaking down the idea of philosophy as being the sort of thing that is undertaken only by a specialist and is impenetrable. Not to say laughable, frankly. And I think when we started – I founded the Institute of Art and Ideas seven years ago, two years before the first HowTheLightGetsIn – that was indeed the only way people thought about philosophy. But every human being, in a way, is a philosopher. Because that's what it is to be human. You wonder about life. You wonder about what you're doing. You wonder about where you're going. You wonder: "What the hell's going on"'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/culture/2014/apr/27/howthelightgetsin-2014-philosophy-music-hay-on-wye |title=HowTheLightGetsIn 2014: philosophy, music and thought for all |publisher=The Guardian |date=27 April 2014 |accessdate=2017-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''Isuma''' ([[Inuktitut syllabics]], '''ᐃᓱᒪ'''; [[Inuktituk]] for "to think") is [[Canada]]'s first [[Inuit]] (75%) [[production company]] co-founded by [[Zacharias Kunuk]], [[Paul Apak Angilirq]] and [[Norman Cohn (film producer)|Norman Cohn]] in [[Igloolik]], [[Nunavut]] in 1990. The company focuses on bringing people of multiple age ranges, cultural backgrounds, and belief systems together to support and promote [[Aboriginal peoples in Canada|Canada's indigenous community]] through television, the Internet and films. Isuma's mission is to produce independent community-based media aimed to preserve and enhance [[Inuit culture]] and language; to create jobs and economic development in Igloolik and Nunavut; and to tell authentic Inuit stories to Inuit and non-Inuit audiences worldwide. Isuma is related to [[Arnait Video Productions]].

In 2011, Isuma filed for [[receivership]], citing $750,000 in debts, including $500,000 to Atuqtuarvik Corp. of [[Rankin Inlet]]. A Montreal-based receiver, [[RSM Richter]], is putting company’s assets—most notably its film library—up for sale.&lt;ref name=Dixon&gt;{{cite news|last=Dixon|first=Guy|title=Out in the cold: the struggle of Inuit film|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/arts/movies/out-in-the-cold-the-struggle-of-inuit-film/article2287215/|accessdate=2 January 2012|newspaper=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=year-end&gt;{{cite news|title=Nunavut: a timeline for the year that was|url=http://www.nunatsiaqonline.ca/stories/article/65674nunavut_a_timeline_for_the_year_that_was/|accessdate=4 January 2012|newspaper=[[Nunatsiaq News]]|date=2 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
In 1999, the company filmed and produced the supernatural historical thriller ''[[Atanarjuat: The Fast Runner]]'',.  It was a box office success around the world, and won the [[Caméra d'Or]] for Best First Feature Film at the 2001 [[Cannes Film Festival]], six [[Genie Award]]s (including Best Picture), and several other international film awards. The film had its Canadian premiere at the [[Toronto International Film Festival]] in 2001.

The massive critical success of ''Atanarjuat'' led to funding from [[Telefilm Canada]], enabling Isuma to begin development on multiple scripts. One of these, ''[[The Journals of Knud Rasmussen]]'', about the switch from [[shamanism]] to [[Christianity]] in Igloolik in the early 1920s, received the offer to open the Toronto International Film Festival in 2006.

Since Isuma means "to have a thought", the collaborators of Igloolik Isuma Productions encourage alternative and multimedia processes designed to make the world at large think not only about the Inuit and their current plight, but about indigenous peoples in general, and the future of the role of community in society. Much of the [[New World]]’s wealth today was extracted from its Aboriginal citizens, who by every measure now are the most destitute populations in these countries. If the Inuit of ''Fast Runner'' ended up in 1922 in church, the Inuit of ''The Journals'' ended up in today’s newspapers stories, living in [[Third World]] ghettos scattered across the wealthiest [[First World]] nations.

Historically, how a country treats its indigenous people is an excellent gauge of its social and political views on humanism in general; what happens to the indigenous peoples of any given country is a sign of what will eventually happen to the dominant culture in time. Even today the law, education, religion and media continue to efface living memories of Aboriginal cultural history. As Norman Cohn says,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Save the seals and Save the bears seems more attractive than Save the people, but unless the rights of humans to live in their habitat are more widely recognized and protected it's a little fatuous to even dream about saving birds and animals.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Isuma aims to increase awareness and focus about and for indigenous peoples of all cultures, not just [[Northern Canada]], through encouraging multimedia approaches. Their goal is to ensure that these rights are not compartmentalized, but rather include the awareness of [[human rights]] in a larger cultural and holistic context: through exploration of spirituality, globalization, environmentalism, cinema, world media, and Native awareness.

==IsumaTV==

'''Jean-Léon Gérôme''' (11 May 1824 – 10 January 1904) was a French [[Painting|painter]] and [[sculpture|sculptor]] in the style now known as [[Academic painting|academicism]]. The range of his oeuvre included [[historical painting]], [[Greek mythology]], [[Orientalism]], portraits, and other subjects, bringing the academic painting tradition to an artistic climax. He is considered one of the most important painters from this academic period. He was also a teacher with a long list of students.

==Biography==

===Early life===
[[File:Maison natale de Jean-Léon Gérôme à Vesoul 2.jpg|thumb|right|Birthplace of Jean-Léon Gérôme in [[Vesoul]] ([[France]]).]]

Jean-Léon Gérôme was born at [[Vesoul]], [[Haute-Saône]]. He went to Paris in 1840 where he studied under [[Hippolyte Delaroche|Paul Delaroche]], whom he accompanied to Italy (1843–44). He visited [[Florence]], Rome, the [[St. Peter's Basilica|Vatican]] and [[Pompeii]], but he was more attracted to the world of nature. Taken by a fever, he was forced to return to Paris in 1844. On his return, he followed, like many other students of Delaroche, into the [[atelier]] of [[Charles Gleyre]] and studied there for a brief time. He then attended the École des Beaux-Arts. In 1846 he tried to enter the prestigious [[Prix de Rome]], but failed in the final stage because his figure drawing was inadequate.

[[File:JEAN-LÉON GÉRÔME - Jóvenes griegos presenciando una pelea de gallos (Museo de Orsay, París, 1846. Óleo sobre lienzo, 143 x 204 cm).jpg|thumb|''[[The Cock Fight]] ''(1846); now in the [[Musée d'Orsay]], Paris]]

His painting, ''[[The Cock Fight]]'' (1846), is an academic exercise, depicting a nude young man and a lightly draped young woman with two [[fighting cocks]], the Bay of [[Naples]] in the background. He sent this painting to the [[Paris Salon|Salon]] of 1847, where it gained him a third-class medal. This work was seen as the epitome of the [[Neo-Grec]] movement that had formed out of Gleyre's studio (such as [[Henri-Pierre Picou]] (1824–1895) and [[Jean-Louis Hamon]]), and was championed by the influential French critic [[Théophile Gautier]].

Gérôme abandoned his dream of winning the Prix de Rome and took advantage of his sudden success. His paintings ''The Virgin, the Infant Jesus and St John''  (private collection) and ''Anacreon, Bacchus and Cupid'' (Musée des Augustins, [[Toulouse]], France) took a second-class medal in 1848. In 1849, he produced the paintings ''Michelangelo'' (also called ''In his studio'') (now in private collection) and ''A portrait of a Lady'' ([[Musée Ingres]], [[Montauban]]).

In 1851, he decorated a vase, later offered by Emperor [[Napoleon III of France]] to [[Albert, Prince Consort|Prince Albert]], now part of the Royal Collection at [[St. James's Palace]], London. He exhibited ''Bacchus and Love, Drunk'', a ''Greek Interior'' and ''Souvenir d'Italie'', in 1851; ''Paestum'' (1852); and ''An Idyll'' (1853).

[[File:Truth Coming Out of Her Well to Shame Mankind, 1896.jpg|thumb|''[[Truth Coming Out of Her Well]]'', 1896]]

In 1852, Gérôme received a commission by Alfred Emilien Comte de Nieuwerkerke, ''Surintendant des Beaux-Arts'' to the court of Napoleon III, for the painting of a large historical canvas, the ''Age of Augustus''. In this canvas he combines the birth of Christ with conquered nations paying homage to Augustus. Thanks to a considerable down payment, he was able to travel in 1853 to Constantinople, together with the actor [[François Jules Edmond Got|Edmond Got]]. This would be the first of several travels to the East: in 1854 he made another journey to Greece and [[Turkey]]&lt;ref&gt;Rosenthal, Donald A. 1982. ''Orientalism, the Near East in French painting, 1800–1880''. Rochester, N.Y.: Memorial Art Gallery of the University of Rochester. p. 77. {{ISBN|0918098149}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the shores of the [[Danube]], where he was present at a concert of Russian conscripts, making music under the threat of a lash.

In 1853, Gérôme moved to the ''Boîte à Thé'', a group of studios in the Rue Notre-Dame-des-Champs, Paris. This would become a meeting place for other artists, writers and actors. [[George Sand]] entertained in the small theatre of the studio the great artists of her time such as the composers [[Hector Berlioz]], [[Johannes Brahms]] and [[Gioachino Rossini]] and the novelists [[Théophile Gautier]] and [[Ivan Turgenev]].

In 1854, he completed another important commission of decorating the Chapel of St. Jerome in the [[Saint-Séverin (Paris)|church of St. Séverin]] in Paris. His ''Last communion of St. Jerome'' in this chapel reflects the influence of the school of Ingres on his religious works.

To the [[Exposition Universelle (1855)|exhibition of 1855]] he contributed a ''Pifferaro'', a ''Shepherd'', ''A Russian Concert'', and ''The Age of Augustus, the Birth of Christ''. The last was somewhat confused in effect, but in recognition of its consummate rendering the State purchased it. However the modest painting, ''A Russian Concert'' (also called ''Recreation in the Camp'') was more appreciated than his huge canvases.

===Orientalism===
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2017}}
In 1856, he visited [[Egypt]] for the first time. Gérôme's recurrent itinerary followed the classic grand tour of most occidental visitors to the Orient; up the Nile to Cairo, across to Fayoum, then further up the Nile to Abu Simbel, then back to Cairo, across the Sinai Peninsula through Sinai and up the Wadi el-Araba to the Holy land, Jerusalem and finally Damascus.&lt;ref&gt;Gerald M. Ackerman: Jean-Léon Gérôme: Eight Oil Sketches. 5 December 2004&lt;/ref&gt;This would herald the start of many orientalist paintings depicting Arab religion, genre scenes and North African landscapes. In an autobiographical essay of 1878, Gérôme described how important oil sketches made on the spot were for him: "even when worn out after long marched under the bright sun, as soon as our camping spot was reached I got down to work with concentration. But Oh! How many things were left behind of which I carried only the memory away! And I prefer three touches of colour on a piece of canvas to the most vivid memory, but one had to continue on with some regret."&lt;ref&gt;Gérôme, Notes, "J. L. Gérôme á la montée de sa carrière, fait la balance", in: ''Bulletin de la société d'agriculture, lettres, sciences et arts de la Haute-Saône'', 1980, pp. 1–30&lt;/ref&gt; He did not only gather themes, artefacts and costumes for his oriental scenes, but also made oil studies from nature for their backgrounds. Several of these quick sketches are filled with details that exceed his wished for three touches of colour.

Gérôme's reputation was greatly enhanced at the Salon of 1857 by a collection of works of a more popular kind: the ''Duel: after the Masked Ball'' ([[Château de Chantilly|Musée Condé]], [[Chantilly, Oise|Chantilly]]), ''Egyptian Recruits crossing the Desert'', ''Memnon and Sesostris'' and ''Camels Watering'', the drawing of which was criticized by [[Edmond François Valentin About|Edmond About]].

In 1858, he helped to decorate the Paris house of Prince [[Napoléon Joseph Charles Paul Bonaparte]] in the Pompeian style. The prince had bought his ''Greek Interior'' (1850), a depiction of a brothel also in the Pompeian manner.

In ''Caesar'' (1859) Gérôme tried to return to a more severe class of work, the painting of Classical subjects, but the picture failed to interest the public. ''[[Phryne before the Areopagus]]'', ''King Candaules'' and ''Socrates finding Alcibiades in the House of Aspasia'' (1861) gave rise to some scandal by reason of the subjects selected by the painter, and brought down on him the bitter attacks of [[Paul Bins, comte de Saint Victor|Paul de Saint-Victor]] and [[Maxime Du Camp]]. At the same Salon he exhibited the ''Egyptian Chopping Straw'', and ''[[Rembrandt Harmenszoon van Rijn|Rembrandt]] Biting an Etching'', two very minutely finished works.

He married Marie Goupil (1842–1912), the daughter of the international art dealer [[Goupil &amp; Cie|Adolphe Goupil]]. They had four daughters and one son. Upon his marriage he moved to a house in the Rue de Bruxelles, close to the music hall [[Folies Bergère]]. He expanded it into a grand house with stables with a sculpture studio below and a painting studio on the top floor.

He started an independent [[atelier]] at his house in the ''Rue de Bruxelles'' between 1860 and 1862.

===Atelier at Beaux-Arts===

Between 1864 and 1904, more than 2,000 students received at least some of their art education through Gérôme's atelier at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]]. Places in Gérôme's atelier were limited, keenly sought and highly competitive. Only the very best students were admitted and aspirants considered it an honour to be selected. Gérôme progressed his students through drawing from antique works, casts and followed by life study with live models generally selected on the basis of their physique, but occasionally for their expression in exercises known as the ''academie.'' The sequence was that they drew parts of a bust before the entire bust and then parts of the live model before preparing full figures. Only when they had mastered sketching were they permitted to work in oils. In his school, the floor sloped so that students could gain a view of the model from the rear of the room. They were also taught to draw clearly and correctly before consideration of tonal qualities. Students sat around any model in order of seniority, with the more senior students towards the rear so that they could draw the full figure, while the more junior members sat towards the front and concentrated on the bust or other part of the anatomy.&lt;ref&gt;O'Sullivan, N., ''Aloysius O'Kelly: Art, Nation, Empire,'' Field Day Publications, 2010 pp 17–21&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to John Milner, who studied with Gérôme, his atelier was the most "riotous" and "lewd" of all the studios at Beaux-Arts. There students were treated to bizarre initiation rites which included such things as slashing each other's canvases, throwing students down stairs, out of windows, and onto upturned stools, staging fencing matches on the model's dais, in the nude and with paintbrushes loaded with paint.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in O'Sullivan, N., ''Aloysius O'Kelly: Art, Nation, Empire,'' Field Day Publications, 2010 pp 17–18&lt;/ref&gt; 

Gérôme attended every Wednesday and Saturday, demanding punctilious attendance to his instructions. His reputation as a severe critic was well-known. One of his students, the American, Stepen Wilson Van Shaick, commented that Gérôme was "merciless in judgement" yet possessed a "singular magnetism."&lt;ref&gt;Cited in O'Sullivan, N., ''Aloysius O'Kelly: Art, Nation, Empire,'' Field Day Publications, 2010 p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Gérôme's atelier was the only studio that conferred the master's cachet on its students. Although Gérôme was very demanding of his students, he offered them considerable assistance outside Beaux-Arts; including inviting them to his personal studio, making recommendations to the Salon on their behalf, and encouraging them to study with his colleagues.&lt;ref&gt;Cited in O'Sullivan, N., ''Aloysius O'Kelly: Art, Nation, Empire,'' Field Day Publications, 2010 p. 21&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honours===
Gérôme was elected, on his fifth attempt, a member of the [[Institut de France]] in 1865. Already a knight in the [[Légion d'honneur]], he was promoted to an officer in 1867. In 1869, he was elected an honorary member of the British [[Royal Academy]]. The King of Prussia [[William I, German Emperor|Wilhelm I]] awarded him the Grand [[Order of the Red Eagle]], Third Class. His fame had become such that he was invited, along with the most eminent French artists, to the opening of the [[Suez Canal]] in 1869.

He was appointed as one of the three professors at the ''Ecole des Beaux-Arts''. He started with sixteen students, most who had come over from his own studio. His influence became extensive and he was a regular guest of Empress [[Eugénie de Montijo|Eugénie]] at the Imperial Court in [[Compiègne]].

The theme of his ''[[The Death of Caesar|Death of Caesar]]'' (1867) was repeated in his historical canvas ''[[The Execution of Marshal Ney]]'', that was exhibited at the Salon of 1868, despite official pressure to withdraw it as it raised painful memories.

Gérôme returned successfully to the Salon in 1873 with his painting ''L'[[Eminence Grise]]'' ([[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston]]), a colorful depiction of the main stair hall of the palace of [[Cardinal Richelieu]], popularly known as the Red Cardinal (''L'Eminence Rouge''), who was [[France]]'s ''[[de facto]]'' ruler under King [[Louis XIII]] beginning in 1624. In the painting, François Le Clerc du Trembly, a [[Order of Friars Minor Capuchin|Capuchin]] friar dubbed ''L'[[Eminence Grise]]'' (the Gray Cardinal), descends the ceremonial staircase immersed in the [[Bible]] while subjects either bow before him or fix their gaze on him. As Richelieu's chief adviser, ''L'[[Eminence Grise]]'' was called "the power behind the throne," which became the known definition of his title.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mfa.org/collections/object/l-eminence-grise-31214 Museum of Fine Arts, Boston: ''L'[[Eminence Grise]]'']&lt;/ref&gt;

When he started to protest and show a public hostility to "decadent fashion" of [[Impressionism]], his influence started to wane and he became unfashionable. But after the exhibition of [[Manet]] in the Ecole in 1884, he eventually admitted that "it was not so bad as I thought."

In 1896 Gérôme painted ''[[Truth Coming Out of Her Well]]'', an attempt to describe the transparency of an illusion. He therefore welcomed the rise of photography as an alternative to his photographic painting. In 1902, he said "Thanks to photography, Truth has at last left her well."

===Death===
Jean-Léon Gérôme died in his [[atelier]] on 10 January 1904. He was found in front of a portrait of [[Rembrandt]] and close to his own painting ''Truth Coming Out of Her Well''.  At his own request, he was given a simple burial service without flowers. But the [[Requiem Mass]] given in his memory was attended by a former president of the Republic, most prominent politicians, and many painters and writers. He was buried in the [[Cimetière de Montmartre|Montmartre Cemetery]] in front of the statue ''Sorrow'' that he had cast for his son Jean who had died in 1891.

He was the father-in-law of the painter [[Aimé Morot]].

==Sculpture==
[[File:Gérome Tanagra 1890.jpg|right|thumb|''Tanagra'', marble, 1890, [[Musée d'Orsay]]]]

Gérôme was also successful as a [[sculpture|sculptor]]. His first work was a large bronze statue of a gladiator holding his foot on his victim, shown to the public at the Exposition Universelle of 1878. This bronze was based on the main theme of his painting ''Pollice verso'' (1872). The same year he exhibited a marble statue at the Salon of 1878, based on his early painting ''[[Anacreon]], [[Dionysus|Bacchus]] and [[Cupid]]'' (1848).

Aware of contemporary experiments of tinting marble (such as by [[John Gibson (sculptor)|John Gibson]]) he produced ''Dancer with Three Masks'' (Musée des Beaux-Arts, ''Caen'' ), combining movement with colour (exhibited in 1902). His tinted group ''Pygmalion and Galatea'' provided his inspiration for several paintings in which he depicted himself as the sculptor who could turn marble into flesh, examples of which (c. 1890) are in the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York, and the [[Smart Museum]], Chicago.

Among his other works are ''[[Omphale]]'' (1887), and the statue of the [[Henri d'Orléans, duc d'Aumale|duc d'Aumale]] which stands in front of the [[château of Chantilly]] (1899).

He started experimenting with mixed ingredients, using for his statues tinted marble, bronze and ivory, inlaid with precious stones and paste. His ''Dancer'' was exhibited in 1891. 
His lifesize statue ''Bellona'' (1892), in ivory, bronze, and gemstones, attracted great attention at the exhibition in the [[Royal Academy of London]].

The artist then began a series of Conquerors, wrought in gold, silver and gems: ''Bonaparte entering Cairo'' (1897); ''Tamerlane'' (1898); and ''Frederick the Great'' (1899).

'''LTTR''' is a [[feminist]] [[genderqueer]] collective founded in 2001 with a flexible project oriented practice. LTTR produces a performance series, events, screenings and collaborations. It also released five issues of an annual independent art journal between 2002 and 2006. The collective is rooted in community and collaborative processes without hierarchy.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IVH7P1JiOhEC&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;ots=usATaM9Vs4&amp;dq=LTTR%20art&amp;pg=PA79#v=onepage&amp;q=LTTR&amp;f=false Rethinking Contemporary Art and Multicultural Education By New Museum]&lt;/ref&gt; 

== About ==
The editorial debates of LTTR and decision making surrounding the printed journal were based on the idea of making a significant contribution to [[contemporary]] [[feminist]] [[genderqueer]] concerns. It was edited by consensus in long-process editorial sessions. Each issue was initiated with an international open call and through interpersonal relationships from within their communities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lttr.org/journal The Journal]&lt;/ref&gt; Each submission was considered independently and in regards to the working themes of the journal. Each issue included handmade artists’ multiples and was published in a print run of 1000 copies. According to Holland Cotter of ''The New York Times'', "The idea of moving art out of the control of the professional art world underlies the thinking of many of the individuals and collectives associated with LTTR."&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nytimes.com/2004/08/06/arts/art-in-review-explosion-lttr.html New York Times Article&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
LTTR was founded in 2001 by [[Ginger Brooks Takahashi]], [[K8 Hardy]] and [[Emily Roysdon]]. [[Ulrike Müller (artist)|Ulrike Müller]] joined LTTR in 2005 and Lanka Tattersal was an editor and collaborator for issue 4. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lttr.org/about-lttr LTTR homepage] &lt;/ref&gt;

LTTR is a shifting acronym; it started in 2001 as “Lesbians to the Rescue" and has since stood for phrases ranging from “Lacan Teaches to Repeat” to “Let’s Take the Role.”&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artpractical.com/feature/repetition-and-difference-lttr/ Article in Art Practical ]&lt;/ref&gt; The inaugural issue of the collective's art journal was entitled “Lesbians to the Rescue,” followed by “Listen Translate Translate Record,” “Practice More Failure,” “Do You Wish to Direct Me?,” and finally "Positively Nasty." LTTR is dedicated to highlighting the work of radical communities whose goals are sustainable change, queer pleasure, and critical feminist productivity.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=WTvfzdpTyuUC&amp;lpg=PT35&amp;ots=Ro6OkraScm&amp;dq=LTTR%20art&amp;pg=PT35#v=onepage&amp;q=LTTR%20art&amp;f=false Modern Women: Women Artists at the Museum of Modern Art edited by Cornelia H. Butler, Alexandra Schwartz] &lt;/ref&gt; It seeks to create and build a context for a culture of critical thinkers whose work not only speaks in dialogue with one another, but consistently challenges its own form by shifting shape and design to best respond to contemporary concerns.

As their project expanded, LTTR exhibited the journal at venues including [[Artists Space]] in New York City, the [[Generali Foundation]] in Vienna, the [[Yerba Buena Center for the Arts]] in San Francisco, [[Los Angeles County Museum of Art]] and [[Documenta]] 12 in Kassel, Germany. &lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PUT7K5Ltj6gC&amp;pg=PA155&amp;lpg=PA155&amp;dq=LTTR+art&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=nLYhlPz0K_&amp;sig=sj1IsHwe7ORfxMyXjy4yN-EoP7U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=gFanUub8E4fkoATivoHgDA&amp;ved=0CFQQ6AEwATgK#v=onepage&amp;q=LTTR%20art&amp;f=false LTTR:The Artists' Publication as a Medium for Performing a Queer Utopia ] &lt;/ref&gt; LTTR’s members have also used their bands, poster projects, workshops and sit-ins as media for exploring the political possibilities of feminist pop-cultural influence. &lt;ref&gt;[http://artpulsemagazine.com/once-more-with-feeling-feminist-art-and-pop-culture-now ArtPulse Magazine Article] &lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Momotaro2.jpg|thumb|right|A [[Bisque (pottery)|bisque]] doll of Momotarō]]
{{Nihongo|'''Momotarō'''|桃太郎||"Peach Boy"}} is a popular hero of [[Japanese folklore]] originating from [[Okayama Prefecture]]. His name translates as ''Peach [[Tarō (given name)|Tarō]]'', a common Japanese masculine name, and is often translated as ''Peach Boy''. ''Momotarō'' is the title of various books, films and other works that portray the tale of this hero.

==Story==
[[File:Japanese Fairy Book - Ozaki - 247.png|thumb|left|Momotarō coming out of a peach]]
According to the present form of the tale (dating to the [[Edo period]]), Momotarō came to Earth inside a giant peach which was found floating down a river, by an old, childless woman who was washing clothes there. The woman and her husband discovered the child when they tried to open the peach to eat it. The child explained that he had been sent by Heaven to be their son. The couple named him Momotarō, from ''momo'' (peach) and ''tarō'' (eldest son in the family).&lt;ref name=Ozaki&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Japanese Fairy Book |chapter=Momotaro, or the story of the Son of a Peach |last=Ozaki |first=Yei Theodora |year=1903 |publisher=Archibald Constable &amp; Co. |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=V_RyPbadxJgC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Years later, Momotarō left his parents to fight a band of marauding ''[[Oni]]'' (demons or ogres) on a distant island. En route, Momotarō met and befriended a talking dog, monkey and pheasant, who agreed to help him in his quest. At the island, Momotarō and his animal friends penetrated the demons' fort and beat the band of demons into surrendering. Momotarō and his new friends returned home with the demons' plundered treasure and the demon chief as a captive. Momotarō and his family lived comfortably from then on.&lt;ref name=Ozaki/&gt;

[[File:Momotaro Hasegawa cover 1886.jpg|thumb|1885 English ''Momotaro'' published by [[Hasegawa Takejirō]]]]
Momotarō is strongly associated with [[Okayama]], and his tale may have its origins there. The demon island ({{Nihongo|Onigashima|鬼ヶ島}}) of the story is sometimes associated with [[Megijima]] Island, an island in the [[Seto Inland Sea]] near [[Takamatsu, Kagawa|Takamatsu]], due to the vast manmade caves found on that island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.city.takamatsu.kagawa.jp/english/kankou/B1e.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080110004627/http://www.city.takamatsu.kagawa.jp/english/kankou/B1e.html |archivedate=2008-01-10 |title=Oni-ga-shima(or Megijima) |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |title=Megi-jima/Ogi-jima |url=http://www.city.takamatsu.kagawa.jp/english/sightseeing/spot/megi-jimaogi-jima.html |website=Takamatsu City Web Site |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Variants==
The story has some regional variations. Some say Momotarō floated by in a box, a white peach or a red peach. Stories from the [[Shikoku]] and [[Chūgoku region|Chūgoku]] regions muddy the distinction with characters from another folk story, the [[The Crab and the Monkey|Monkey-Crab Battle]], that Momotarō took with him allies to Oni Island, namely a {{Nihongo|bee|蜂|hachi}}, a {{Nihongo|crab|蟹|kani}}, a {{Nihongo|[[millstone]]|臼|usu}}, a {{Nihongo|chestnut|栗|kuri}}, and {{Nihongo|[[cow dung]]|牛の糞|ushi no kuso}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.f49m24.niknak.ne.jp/~kire/sub1-21.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208142021/http://www.f49m24.niknak.ne.jp/~kire/sub1-21.htm |archivedate=2008-02-08 |title=桃太郎 |accessdate=2010-09-01 }} (Japanese)&lt;/ref&gt;

There are variances about the Momotarō's process of growth; one is that he grew up to meet the expectation of the old couple to be a fine boy. Another is that he grew up to be a strong but lazy person who just sleeps all day and does not do anything. It is possible that the Momotarō being a fine boy version is more famous to give lessons to children. Nowadays, Momotarō is one of the most famous characters in Japan, as an ideal model for young kids for his kind-heartedness, bravery, power, and care for his parents.

Grown up, Momotarō goes on his journey to defeat the demons when he hears about the demons of the Onigashima (demon island). In some versions of the story, Momotarō volunteered to go help the people by repelling the demons, but in some stories he was forced by the townspeople or others to go on journey. However, all the stories describe Momotarō defeating the Oni and live happily ever after with the old couple.

==English translations==
The story has been translated into English many times. "The Adventures of Little Peachling" appeared in [[A.B. Mitford]]'s ''[[Tales of Old Japan]]'' in 1871. Rev. David Thomson's translation as "Little Peachling" appeared as the first volume of [[Hasegawa Takejirō]]'s ''Japanese Fairy Tale'' series in 1885. Susan Ballard included it in ''Fairy Tales from Far Japan'' (1899). [[Yei Theodora Ozaki]] included it in her ''Japanese Fairy Tales'' (1911). Teresa Peirce Williston included it in ''Japanese Fairy Tales'', Second Series, in 1911. And there are many other translations.

==Momotarō festivals==
[[Inuyama]] holds a festival called the Momotarō Festival at the Momotarō Shrine on May 5 every year.{{cn|date=December 2015}}

==''Momotarō's Song''==
{{anchor|Song}}&lt;!-- [[Momotarō's Song]] redirects here --&gt;

The popular children's song about Momotarō titled ''Momotarō-san no Uta'' (''Momotarō's Song'') was first published in 1911; the text's author is unattributed, while the melody was written by [[Teiichi Okano]].  The first two stanzas, with romanization and translation, are given below.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.d-score.com/ar/A02011408.html|title=d-score 楽譜 - 桃太郎　----　文部省唱歌／岡野貞一|author=|date=|website=www.d-score.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World War II==
Momotarō was an immensely popular figure in Japan during World War II, appearing in many wartime films and cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;[[John W. Dower]], ''War Without Mercy: Race &amp; Power in the Pacific War'' p. 253 {{ISBN|0-394-50030-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Momotarō represented the Japanese government, citizens were animals and the United States was the oni, the demonic figure. Even though it is not directly mentioned, it is implied that Onigashima was Pearl Harbor. It was used to convey the idea that Japan would fight against the wicked, yet powerful United States and victory could only be achieved if the citizens supported the government. Also, the food and treasure that Momotarō and the animals earned after conquering the oni was supposed to reflect the glory that the powerful Japanese Empire would have had after defeating the United States. One such movie was ''[[Momotarō: Umi no Shinpei|Momotarō's Divine Sea Warriors]]''.

The school closed in 1983 but a significant number of its students went on to successful international careers.,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kringelbach|first=Hélène Neveu|date=2014-02-01|title=CHOREOGRAPHIC PERFORMANCE, GENERATIONS AND THE ART OF LIFE IN POST-COLONIAL DAKAR|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/africa/article/choreographic-performance-generations-and-the-art-of-life-in-post-colonial-dakar/0DEA6C822D5F6218AF5689E17ADAF164|journal=Africa|volume=84|issue=1|pages=36–54|doi=10.1017/S000197201300065X|issn=0001-9720}}&lt;/ref&gt; such as the Burkinabe choreographer, dancer, actor and artist [[Irene Tassembedo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bourdié|first=Annie|year=2013|title=Art chorégraphique contemporain d’Afrique, enjeux d’une reconnaissance|url=https://www.cairn.info/revue-marges-2013-1-page-73.htm|journal=Marges - Revues|volume=16|pages=73–86|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mudra Afrique played a crucial role in preparing the basis for contemporary African dance by training the first generation of “modern” African dancers according to international artistic standards.

== History of the School ==
The name of the school comes from the Sanskrit term “mudra” meaning “gesture” or “sign.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Mudra|date=1980-01-01|url=http://www.unesco.org/archives/multimedia/?s=films_details&amp;pg=33&amp;id=117|language=fr|accessdate=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The school, once located where the [[Court of Cassation (Senegal)|Court of Cassation]] in Dakar is currently housed,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://keurvision.net/public/newsletter/nl20130131/DPM_JACQUES_H_SY.pdf|title=Le domaine public maritime de Dakar: élites, pouvoir et impunité, Une enquête de terrain d’Aide Transparence, UNE ONG regionale d’analyse de poliques économiques et sociales, au service des peuples africains,|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=Jacques Habib Sy, Mamadou Aliou Diallo, Papa Samba Kane|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; was founded in 1977 by Leopolod Sédar Senghor and Maurice Béjart&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/maurice-b-jart-influential-choreographer-who-attracted-huge-audiences-to-ballet-760253.html|title=Maurice Béjart: Influential choreographer who attracted huge|date=2007-11-24|newspaper=The Independent|language=en-GB|access-date=2016-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and funded by Senegal and [[Belgium]], with support from [[UNESCO]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sieveking|first=Nadine|date=2014-02-01|title=‘CREATE YOUR SPACE!’ LOCATING CONTEMPORARY DANCE IN OUAGADOUGOU|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/africa/article/create-your-space-locating-contemporary-dance-in-ouagadougou/C00929698A57E2092DC7E9913BE35B77|journal=Africa|volume=84|issue=1|pages=55–77|doi=10.1017/S0001972013000661|issn=0001-9720}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Germaine Acogny]], a Senegalese dancer and choreographer originally from [[Benin]], who is probably the best-known and most influential forerunner of contemporary dance in the West-African region,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; was appointed director of the school from its opening. Mudra Afrique, with an international student body, emphasized the Senghorian concepts of both ''enracinement'' and ''ouverture,'' rootedness and openness. The school was based on the premise that dance could be used to connect distinctly different African cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nnsWhJGkXo8C&amp;pg=PA69&amp;dq=in+1977+maurice+bejart,+choreographer+and+artistic+director&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjzrJiw_pHQAhVEKCYKHTEHAG4Q6AEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=in%201977%20maurice%20bejart,%20choreographer%20and%20artistic%20director&amp;f=false|title=African Dance: An Artistic, Historical, and Philosophical Inquiry|last=Welsh-Asante|first=Kariamu|date=1996-01-01|publisher=Africa World Press|year=|isbn=9780865431973|location=|pages=69|language=en|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Students received training in African, contemporary, and classical dance, as well as in African drumming.

== Influence on Other Dance Schools ==
Many non-Senegalese African dancers, who went on to found their own schools, attended Mudra Afrique, and so its multidisciplinary training greatly influenced dance across West Africa.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dubois|first=Olivier|year=2016|title=Le rayonnement de Mudra-Afrique, Entretien avec Germaine Acogny, "la fille noire de Béjart"|url=http://www.contredanse.org/pdf/nddinfo/ndd_66.pdf|journal=Nouvelles de Danse, CONTREDANSE|volume=|pages=6|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This includes Germaine Acogny, the former director of Mudra Afrique, who established her own African contemporary dance school, École des Sables, in Senegal in 2004, based on the same Pan-African principles which inspired Mudra Afrique. The school is now a platform for choreographers from all over the world and for African dancers aspiring to an international career.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She explains her conception of contemporary African dance saying “the artistic movement into which I insert my own work, even though it is deeply rooted in popular traditions, is not at all a return to roots. On the contrary, we pursue a way that is altogether different and ''resolutely'' urban, reflecting the modern context within which so many of us, Africans of our time, must live and move and have our being. The Africa of sky-scrapers, the Africa of international alliances”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Danse africaine - Afrikanischer Tanz - African dance|last=Acogny|first=Germaine|publisher=Fricke|year=1980|isbn=|location=Frankfurt|pages=74|quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast with Mudra Afrique, however, funding for this school did not come from African states but from French and European agencies, private charities in Europe and North America, and from fee-paying students from outside Africa.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Other examples include Irène Tassembedo from [[Burkina Faso]], who founded her own dance school, École Danse Irène Tassembedo (EDIT), in 2009 in [[Ouagadougou]] and developed an international career popularizing African contemporary dance.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Laurent Longafo from the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]] (DRC) also introduced Germaine Acogny’s dance techniques to a wider university student population.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Maurice Béjart established another dance school called École Mudra in Belgium in 1970, which closed in 1988.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; So the influence of Mudra Afrique extends beyond Senegal.

== Critiques of the School ==
The school served as a showcase for Senegal’s advanced artistic initiatives, which were elaborated and complicated by the dancers it trained. Since the foundation of Mudra Afrique in 1977, however, [[France]] and other European countries have been financing the choreographic arts in Africa via training, workshops, and space, using cultural agencies attached to the [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and International Development (France)|French Ministry of Foreign Affairs]]. This necessitates that performers respond to the artistic demands of these institutions, which raises concerns over creative agency and drives choreographic standardization towards European and away from African.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bushidi|first=Cécile Feza|date=2015-05-01|title=HÉLÈNE NEVEU KRINGELBACH , Dance Circles: movement, morality and self-fashioning in urban Senegal. New York NY and Oxford: Berghahn Books (hb $95/£60 – 978 1 78238 147 1). 2013, 252 pp.|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/africa/article/helene-neveu-kringelbach-dance-circles-movement-morality-and-self-fashioning-in-urban-senegal-new-york-ny-and-oxford-berghahn-books-hb-9560-978-1-78238-147-1-2013-252-pp/850A486B46982CF270875A13C505AF8C|journal=Africa|volume=85|issue=2|pages=369–371|doi=10.1017/S0001972015000091|issn=0001-9720}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, efforts for self-determination by African performing artists deliberately opposing ongoing French [[cultural hegemony]] are coupled with a search for alternative frameworks of artistic development, following a strategy of diversification in a dual sense: broadening the range of potential donors and gaining access to new politico-economic resources by promoting “cultural diversity”. An example of this are both EDIT (École Danse Irène Tassembedo) and École des Sable, which show the trend of combining profit-making with a “cultural exchange” and a political and social development agenda.

The new “choreographic movement” born out of transnational African collaboration has become more and more male-dominated with regards to international visibility, which is contrasted against the important role played by women such as Germaine Acogny and Irène Tassembedo, who are considered to be among the ''avant garde'' of contemporary dance in Africa. Given the family backgrounds of these dancing pioneers, who were part of the social, political and economic elite during the first decades of national independence and enjoyed state patronage, the current underrepresentation of female choreographers might be explained by the professionalization and opening of the dancing field towards less-privileged social spheres and groups, with the unfortunate effect of decreasing the representation of women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The '''Paseo del Prado''' is one of the main [[boulevard]]s in [[Madrid]], Spain. The Paseo del Prado is the oldest historical urban in Madrid and was declared [[Bien de Interés Cultural]] (BIC). It runs north-south between the [[Plaza de Cibeles]] and the [[Plaza del Emperador Carlos V]] (also known as Plaza de [[Madrid Atocha railway station|Atocha]]), with the [[Plaza de Cánovas del Castillo]] (the location of the [[Fuente de Neptuno]], and of the Ritz and Palace five-star hotels) lying approximately in the middle. The Paseo del Prado forms the southern end of the city's central axis (which continues to the north of Cibeles as the [[Paseo de Recoletos]], and further north as the [[Paseo de la Castellana]]).

This densely tree-lined, wide and centric avenue is a landmark for the city residents and the location of important cultural and tourist spots in the city, including the so-called ''[[Golden Triangle of Art]]'', which encompasses three museums: the [[Museo del Prado|Prado Museum]] (with highlights such as [[Diego Velázquez]]'s ''[[Las Meninas]]'' and [[Francisco de Goya]]'s ''[[La maja vestida]]'' and ''[[La maja desnuda]]''), the [[Thyssen-Bornemisza Museum]] (housing a collection that spans eight centuries of European painting), and the [[Museo Nacional Centro de Arte Reina Sofia|Reina Sofia Museum]] (where [[Pablo Picasso]]'s ''[[Guernica (painting)|Guernica]]'' hangs, among a collection of 20th-century art). In the vicinity are located the [[Parque del Buen Retiro]] and the [[Casón del Buen Retiro]] (hosting the 19th-century collection of the Prado Museum), as well as the headquarters of the [[Real Academia Española]] (the Spanish language academy), the [[Bolsa de Madrid]] (the city's stock exchange), and the [[Congreso de los Diputados]] (the national congress).

The Paseo del Prado boulevard includes several monuments and enclosures that are of historical and artistic interest, erected in the eighteenth century for the Hall of Prado urban project.  Numerous ornamental and landscaping grounds were constructed for this project. The highlights of this project include the [[Edificio Villanueva|Villanueva Building]], headquarters of the Prado Museum, the [[Real Jardín Botánico de Madrid|Royal Botanical Gardens]] and the sculptural water fountains of [[Fountain of Neptune (Madrid)|Neptune]], [[Fountain of Cybele (Madrid)|Cibeles]] and [[Fountain of Apollo (Madrid)|Apollo]]. {{Citation needed|date=April 2012}}

'''Pointillé''' is a decorative technique in which patterns are formed on a surface by a means of punched dots.  The technique is similar to [[Repoussé and chasing|embossing]] or [[engraving]] but is done manually and does not cut into the surface being decorated.  Pointillé was commonly used to decorate arms and armor starting in the fifteenth century [http://www.metmuseum.org/toah/hd/dect/hd_dect.htm].  The [[Holy Thorn Reliquary]] in the [[British Museum]], made in France at the end of the 14th century, has very fine and delicate pointillé work in gold.

== Common uses of pointillé ==

Pointillé is commonly used:

* in the decoration of metallic arms and armor
* in the decoration of hand-finished firearms
* in [[bookbinding]] to finish hand-made bookcovers [http://palimpsest.stanford.edu/don/dt/dt2621.html]

'''Robert Studley Forrest Hughes''' [[Officer of the Order of Australia|AO]] (28 July 1938{{spaced ndash}}6 August 2012) was an Australian-born [[art critic]], writer, and producer of [[television documentary|television documentaries]]. His best seller ''[[The Fatal Shore]]'' (1986) is a study of the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] and [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|early history of Australia]]. He was described in 1997 by Robert Boynton of ''[[The New York Times]]'' as "the most famous art critic in the world."&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Randy|date=6 August 2012|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/08/07/arts/robert-hughes-art-critic-whose-writing-was-elegant-and-contentious-dies-at-74.html?pagewanted=all|title=Robert Hughes, Art Critic Whose Writing Was Elegant and Contentious, Dies at 74|work=The New York Times|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes earned widespread recognition for his book and television series on [[modern art]], ''[[The Shock of the New]]'', and for his longstanding position as art critic with ''[[TIME]]'' magazine. Known for his contentious critiques of art and artists, Hughes was generally conservative in his tastes, although he did not belong to a particular philosophical camp. His writing was noted for its power and elegance.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt;

==Early life==
Hughes was born in [[Sydney]], Australia, in 1938. His father and paternal grandfather were lawyers. Hughes's father, [[Geoffrey Forrest Hughes]], was a pilot in the [[First World War]], with later careers as a solicitor and company director. He died from lung cancer when Robert was aged 12.&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt; His mother was Margaret Eyre Sealy, née Vidal. His older brother was Australian politician [[Tom Hughes (Australian politician)|Thomas Eyre Forrest Hughes]],&lt;ref name=duggan/&gt; and the uncle of former Sydney Lord Mayor [[Lucy Turnbull]], the wife of Australian Prime Minister [[Malcolm Turnbull]]. He had another brother Geoffrey and one sister, Constance.

Growing up in [[Rose Bay, New South Wales|Rose Bay, Sydney]],&lt;ref name="Carey 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/07/robert-hughes-by-peter-carey|title='Robert Hughes was Australia's Dante,' says his friend Peter Carey|work=[[The Guardian]]|date=7 August 2012|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was educated at [[Saint Ignatius' College, Riverview]] before studying arts and then architecture at the [[University of Sydney]].&lt;ref name="The Australian obituary"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Williamson 2012"/&gt; At university, he associated with the [[Sydney Push|Sydney "Push"]] – a group of artists, writers, intellectuals and drinkers. Among the group were [[Germaine Greer]] and [[Clive James]].&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.robertboynton.com/articleDisplay.php?article_id=1532|title=The Lives of Robert Hughes|last=Boynton|first=Robert S.|date=12 May 1997|work=[[The New Yorker]]|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Career==

=== As an art critic ===
Hughes, an aspiring artist and poet, abandoned his university endeavours to become first a cartoonist and then an art critic for the Sydney periodical ''[[The Bulletin|The Observer]]'', edited by [[Donald Horne]].&lt;ref name="Australian Book Review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/Current/Rose%20review.htm|title=Up On Stilts|last=Rose|first=Peter|authorlink=Peter Rose (poet)|work=[[Australian Book Review]]|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081022081732/http://home.vicnet.net.au/~abr/Current/Rose%20review.htm|archivedate=22 October 2008|deadurl=yes|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was briefly involved in the original Sydney version of [[Oz (magazine)|''Oz'' magazine]] and wrote art criticism for ''[[The Nation]]'' and ''[[Sunday Mirror|The Sunday Mirror]]''.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}}

Hughes left Australia for Europe in 1964, living for a time in Italy before settling in London in 1965,&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997" /&gt; where he wrote for ''[[The Spectator]]'', ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'', ''[[The Times]]'', and ''The Observer'', among others, and contributed to the London version of ''Oz''. In 1970 he was appointed art critic for ''[[Time (magazine)|TIME]]'' magazine and moved to New York, where he soon became an influential voice.&lt;ref name="Williamson 2012" /&gt;

In 1966 Hughes published a history of [[Australian painting]] titled ''The Art of Australia'', still considered an important work.&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997" /&gt; 

Hughes co-produced, in association with German producer Reiner Moritz and Lorna Pegram, the BBC eight-part series ''[[The Shock of the New]]'' (1980) on the development of [[modern art]] since the [[Impressionism|Impressionists]]. It was accompanied by a book with the same title. John O'Connor of ''[[The New York Times]]'' said, "Agree or disagree, you will not be bored. Mr. Hughes has a disarming way of being provocative."&lt;ref name="O'Connor"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1981/01/11/arts/tv-view-a-provocative-new-series-on-modern-art-by-john-o-connor.html?pagewanted=all|title=A Provocative New Series on Modern Art|last=O'Connor|first=John|date=11 January 1981|work=New York Times|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes's TV series ''American Visions'' (1997) reviewed the history of [[Visual art of the United States|American art]] since the [[American Revolution|Revolution]].&lt;ref name="Boynton 1997" /&gt; Hughes's documentary on [[Francisco Goya]], ''Goya: Crazy Like a Genius'' (2002),&lt;ref name="The Australian obituary" /&gt; was broadcast on the first night of the new British domestic [[Digital television|digital service]], [[BBC Four]].{{citation needed|date=February 2013}} He created a one-hour update to ''The Shock of the New'', titled ''The New Shock of the New'', which first aired in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2004/jun/30/art1|title=Robert Hughes on updating The Shock Of The New|author=Robert Hughes|date=30 June 2004|work=Guardian|accessdate=31 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; He published the first volume of his [[memoirs]], ''Things I Didn’t Know'', in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotsman.com/lifestyle/books/features/things-i-didn-t-know-1-721027|title=Things I didn't know: Book review|date=14 October 2006|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== As a journalist and historian ===
Hughes and [[Harold Hayes]] were recruited in 1978 to anchor the new [[ABC News]] (US) [[newsmagazine]] ''[[20/20 (US television show)|20/20]]''. His only broadcast, on 6 June 1978, proved so controversial that, less than a week later, ABC News president [[Roone Arledge]] terminated the contracts of both men, replacing them with veteran TV host [[Hugh Downs]].&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt;

Hughes's book ''[[The Fatal Shore]]'' followed in 1987. A study of the British [[penal colony|penal colonies]] and [[History of Australia (1788–1850)|early European settlement of Australia]], it became an international best-seller.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt; During the late 1990s, Hughes was a prominent supporter of the [[Australian Republican Movement]].&lt;ref name="BBC obituary"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-19158897|title=Australian art critic Robert Hughes dies, aged 74|publisher=BBC News|date=14 April 2003|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Australia: Beyond the Fatal Shore'' (2000) was a series musing on modern Australia and Hughes's relationship with it. During production, Hughes was involved in a near-fatal road accident.&lt;ref name="Rothenberg 1999" /&gt;

==Personal life==
Hughes met his first wife, Danne Emerson, in London in 1967. Together they became involved in the [[counterculture of the 1960s]], exploring drug use and sexual freedom.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Maunder 2012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/robert-hughes-turned-criticism-into-an-art-20120807-23r1m.html|title=Robert Hughes turned criticism into an art|last=Maunder|first=Patricia|date=7 August 2012|work=Sydney Morning Herald|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; They divorced in 1981; she died of a brain tumor in 2003.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Things 2"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hughes|first=Robert|title=Things I Didn't Know: A Memoir|year=2006|publisher=[[Alfred A.

He had been in a long term relationship with fashion designer [[Jenny Kee]], who found his body on 15 April. Robert Hughes later wrote: "I miss Danton and always will, although we had been miserably estranged for years and the pain of his loss has been somewhat blunted by the passage of time".&lt;ref name="Williamson 2012"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/obituaries/robert-hughes-forthright-critic-who-transformed-the-public-perception-of-modern-art-8015623.html|title=Robert Hughes: Forthright critic who transformed the public perception of modern art|last=Williamson|first=Marcus| authorlink =  Marcus Williamson|date=8 August 2012|work=The Independent|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hughes was married to his second wife, Victoria Whistler, a housewife from California, from 1981 until a divorce in 1996.&lt;ref name="Williamson 2012" /&gt;

In 1999, Hughes was involved in a near-fatal car accident south of [[Broome, Western Australia]]. He was returning from a fishing trip and driving on the wrong side of the road when he collided head on with another car carrying three occupants. He was trapped in the car for three hours before being airlifted to [[Perth]] in critical condition.&lt;ref name="Rothenberg 1999"&gt;{{cite web|first=Jackie|last=Rothenberg|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/art_critic_robert_hughes_seriously_YKMdoMNtlTcPQn04m1t6MO|title=Art Critic Robert Hughes Seriously Hurt In Crash|publisher=NYPOST.com|date=30 May 1999|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes was in a coma for five weeks after the crash.&lt;ref name="BBC News April 2003"/&gt; In a 2000 court hearing, Hughes's defence barrister alleged that the occupants of the other car had been transporting illicit drugs at the time of the accident and were at fault.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Jackie|last= Rothenberg|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/drug_link_eyed_for_men_who_struck_Iol2L0hHTHI4j3LAA7e7sO|title=Drug Link Eyed For Men Who Struck Hughes's Car| publisher=NYPOST.com|date=6 June 1999|accessdate=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003 Hughes pleaded guilty to dangerous driving causing bodily harm and was fined A$2,500.&lt;ref name="BBC News April 2003"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/arts_and_culture/2946409.stm|title=Art critic admits crash guilt|date=14 April 2003|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also allegedly described the crown prosecutor, [[Lloyd Rayney]], as a "curry muncher", which resulted in a [[defamation]] action and out-of-court settlement.&lt;ref name=duggan&gt;Duggan, Paul.

In 2001, Hughes wed his third wife, the American artist and [[art director]] [[Doris Downes]]. "Apart from being a talented painter, she saved my life, my emotional stability, such as it is", he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sptimes.com/2003/11/09/Floridian/The_art_of_conversati.shtml|title=The art of conversation|work=St. Petersburg Times Floridian|date=9 November 2003|last=Bennett|first=Lennie|accessdate=22 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Death==
After a long illness, Hughes died at [[Calvary Hospital, Bronx|Calvary Hospital]] in [[The Bronx]], [[New York City|New York]], on 6 August 2012, with his wife at his bedside. He was also survived by two stepsons from his wife's previous marriage, Freeborn Garrettson Jewett IV and Fielder Douglas Jewett; his brothers, Tom and Geoffrey Hughes; a sister, Mrs. Constance Crisp; and many nieces and nephews.&lt;ref name="Kennedy 2012"/&gt;

==Assessment==
When ''The Shock of the New'' was proposed to the BBC, television programmers were skeptical that a [[journalist]] could properly follow the aristocratic tone of [[Kenneth Clark]], whose ''[[Civilisation (TV series)|Civilisation]]'' had been so successful.&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=McNay|first=Michael|date=6 August 2012|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2012/aug/07/robert-hughes|title=Robert Hughes obituary|work=The Guardian|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Shock of the New'' proved to be a popular and critical success: it has been assessed "much the best synoptic introduction to modern art ever written", taking as its premise the vitality gained by modern art when it ceded the need to replicate nature in favor of a more direct expression of human experience and emotion.&lt;ref name="Gopnik 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Gopnik|first=Adam|date=7 August 2012|url=http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/books/2012/08/postscript-robert-hughes.html|title=Postscript: Robert Hughes|work=The New Yorker|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes' explanations of modern art benefited from the coherence of his judgments, and were marked by his ability to summarise the essential qualities of his subject.&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;

Whether positive or negative, his judgments were enthusiastic. He championed London painters like [[Frank Auerbach]] and [[Lucian Freud]], helping to popularise the latter in the United States, and wrote with unabashed admiration for [[Francisco Goya]] and [[Pierre Bonnard]].&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"&gt;{{cite news|last=Lacayo|first=Richard|date=7 August 2012|url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/08/07/the-art-of-being-critical-robert-hughes-1938-2012/|title=The Art of Being Critical: Robert Hughes (1938–2012)|work=Time magazine|accessdate=17 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast Hughes was dismissive of much [[postmodernism]] and [[neo-expressionism]], as well as the vicissitudes of a money-fueled art market.&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012" /&gt; While his reviews expressed [[antipathy]] for the [[avant-garde]], he was beholden neither to any theory nor ideology, and managed to provoke both ends of the political spectrum.&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Woodward|first1=Richard B.|title=The Most Feared Art Critic of His Time?|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10000872396390443537404577577300626558944|website=Wall Street Journal|accessdate=28 February 2017|date=8 August 2012|quote=Robert Hughes, who died on Monday at the age of 74, leaves behind many admirers but few followers. The most feared art critic of his time, as learned as he was readable, he cultivated no acolytes who aped his opinions and verbal mannerisms, as did Clement Greenberg and Pauline Kael, critics of equal stature. Despite his professorial air, Hughes spurned academia and it has responded in kind.}}&lt;/ref&gt; He distrusted novelty in art for its own sake, yet he was also disdainful of a conservative aesthetic that avoided risk. Hughes, according to [[Adam Gopnik]], was drawn to work that was rough-hewn, "craft attempted with passion."&lt;ref name="Gopnik 2012"/&gt;

Hughes's critical prose, vivid in both praise and indignation, has been compared to that of [[George Bernard Shaw]],&lt;ref name="Gopnik 2012"/&gt; [[Jonathan Swift]]&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"/&gt; and [[William Shakespeare]].&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"/&gt; "His prose", according to a colleague, "was lithe, muscular and fast as a bunch of fives. He was incapable of writing the jargon of the art world, and consequently was treated by its mandarins with fear and loathing."&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt; In different moods he could write that "[[Julian Schnabel|Schnabel’s]] work is to painting what [[Sylvester Stallone|Stallone’s]] is to acting: a lurching display of oily pectorals,"&lt;ref name="Lacayo 2012"/&gt; as well as conclude that [[Antoine Watteau]] "was a connoisseur of the unplucked string, the immobility before the dance, the moment that falls between departure and nostalgia."&lt;ref name="McNay 2012"/&gt;

'''''Rock Profile''''' is a British television comedy show written by and starring [[double act|comedy partnership]] [[Matt Lucas (comedian)|Matt Lucas]] and [[David Walliams]], both later widely known for the [[sketch comedy|sketch show]] ''[[Little Britain]]''. ''Rock Profile'' first appeared on the channel [[UK Play]] in 1999, directed by [[Michael Cumming]], before moving to [[BBC Two]] in 2000.

The show comprises a series of spoof interviews, involving [[Jamie Theakston]] questioning Lucas and Walliams who play famous musicians. The interviews are often bizarre and involve broad, unflattering caricatures or just downright fictional characteristics. They are often interspersed with videos by the featured artist, including humorous captions and congratulations from other impersonated celebrities.

== Broadcast history ==

The first series was broadcast in 1999, comprising 13 episodes, on digital channel UK Play. The series was then picked up by BBC Two, with a second series of 13 episodes following in 2000. Series one was later shown on BBC Two. In Christmas 2000, a special 45-minute episode of the series was broadcast, entitled ''[[Rock the Blind]]''. The episode followed [[Gary Barlow]] (Lucas) and [[Ronan Keating]] (Walliams) as they recorded a charity single. [[Ted Robbins]] appeared as [[Pete Waterman]], and [[Sara Cox]] as herself. Following the episode, the series saw a break of two years.

In October 2001, several sketches were comprised for the re-launch of ''[[Top of the Pops]]'', entitled ''The All-New Top of the Pops''. All of the sketches were filmed backstage, featuring characters which had appeared in the previous two series. Fans of the series were happy to see its brief return, however, people who were unaware of the show at the time did not understand the segments. Complaints were also sparked regarding the sketch featuring Lucas as [[Elton John]], who was being interviewed about his appearance on ''TOTP'', in which he performed ''[[The Lion King]]'''s main theme, "[[Circle of Life]]". A member of the audience also verbally harassed Lucas during the sketch, which resulted in the entire feature being cut from all future repeat screenings of the episode, meaning only the DVD release is the only existent source to the public to view these.

In 2009, a third series was recorded by Walliams and Lucas and was made available on the website [[Funny or Die]] for free viewing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.broadcastnow.co.uk/news/2009/05/lucas_and_walliams_revive_rock_profiles.html|title=Lucas and Walliams revive Rock Profiles|work=broadcastnow.co.uk|accessdate=10 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The third series replaced host Jamie Theakston with new host [[Dermot O'Leary]]. The first episode aired virally on 11 May 2009, and featured a mock interview with [[Katie Price|Jordan]] and [[Peter Andre]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.funnyordie.co.uk/videos/f6bb86d6d0/rock-profile-episode-one-peter-andre-and-jordan-pt-1|title=Rock Profile:Peter Andre &amp; Jordan Pt.1|work=Funny or Die|accessdate=10 March 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100729033635/http://www.funnyordie.co.uk/videos/f6bb86d6d0/rock-profile-episode-one-peter-andre-and-jordan-pt-1|archivedate=29 July 2010|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

''Rock Profile'' has been well received by critics. ''[[Radio Times]]'' described the show as "truly silly and truly inspired". ''[[Sunday Mirror]]'' described it as "excellent comedy",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite DVD notes |title=Rock Profile |publisher=BBC DVD |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' called it "hilarious".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/showbiz/tv/221770/Rock-Profile-on-DVD.html |title=''Rock Profile'' on DVD |last=Wood |first=Beci |date=July 26, 2005 |website=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]] |accessdate=May 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Limes and borders.gif|thumb|400px|Map of all the territories once occupied by the Roman Empire, along with locations of ''limes'']]
{{RomanMilitary}}

'''Roman military borders and fortifications''' were part of a [[grand strategy]] of territorial defense in the [[Roman Empire]], although this is a matter of debate. By the early 2nd century, the [[Roman Empire]] had reached the peak of its territorial expansion and rather than constantly expanding their borders as earlier in the Empire and Republic, the Romans solidified their position by fortifying their strategic position with a series of fortifications and established lines of defense. Historian [[Adrian Goldsworthy]] argues that the Romans had reached the natural limits which their military traditions afforded them conquest over and that beyond the borders of the early-to-mid Empire lay peoples whose military traditions made them militarily unconquerable, despite many Roman battle victories. In particular, Goldsworthy argues that the cavalry-based warfare of the [[Parthian Empire|Parthians]], [[Sarmatians]] and [[Sassanian Empire|Persians]] presented a major challenge to the expansion of Rome's infantry-based armies.

==Nature of the fortifications==
The [[borders of the Roman Empire]], which fluctuated throughout the empire's history, were a combination of natural frontiers (the [[Rhine]] and [[Danube]] rivers to the north and east, the [[Atlantic]] to the west, and deserts to the south) and man-made fortifications which separated the lands of the empire from the "[[barbarian]]" lands beyond.

Individual fortifications had been constructed by the [[Roman military]] from as early as the building of Rome's first city walls in the 6th or 7th century BC. However, systematic construction of fortifications around the periphery of the empire on a strategic scale began around 40 AD under Emperor [[Caligula]].{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} However, it was under [[Hadrian]]'s rule, which began in 117, that the Roman frontier was systematically fortified. He spent half of his 21-year reign touring the empire and advocating for the construction of forts, towers, and walls all across the edges of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Curry, Andrew. "Roman Frontiers." ''National Geographic'' Sept 2012: 106-127. Print&lt;/ref&gt; The coherent construction of these fortifications on a strategic scale (''i.e.'' to protect the empire as a whole rather than fortifying individual settlements) are known as the ''[[limes]]'', and continued until around 270.

The ''limes'' consisted of fortresses for legions or vexillations (e.g. [[Segedunum]]) as well as a system of roads for the rapid transit of troops and, in some places, extensive walls. Perhaps the most famous example of these is [[Hadrian's Wall]] in [[Great Britain]], which was built across the entire width of the island to protect from attack from tribes located in modern-day Scotland. The so-called ''[[Limes Britannicus]]'' is perhaps the best example of the ultimate ''limes'' - like the [[Great Wall of China]], it was an attempt to construct a continuous man-made fortification along the length of an entire border, a massive undertaking. However, it is not correct to interpret other ''limes'' in the same way or to view the ''limes'' as an impenetrable barrier. Other limes would not have had a continuous man-made fortification for the entirety of their length. In places, a river, desert or natural outcropping of rock could provide the same effect for zero outlay. Also, fortifications as impressive as [[Hadrian's Wall]] were not unbreachable: with milecastles some distance apart and patrols infrequent, small enemy forces would have been able to penetrate the defenses easily for small-scale raiding. However, a raiding party would be forced to fight its way through one of the well-defended gates, abandon its loot, such as cattle, thus negating the whole purpose of the raid or be trapped against the wall by the responding legions.  Additionally, a large army would have been able to force a crossing of the ''limes'' using siege equipment. The value of the limes lay not in its absolute impenetrability but, as S. Thomas Parker argues, in its hindrance to the enemy: granting a delay or warning that could be used to summon concentrated Roman forces to the site. The ''limes'' are therefore perhaps better seen as an instrument allowing a greater economy of force in defense of a border than otherwise would be necessary to provide the same level of defense.

After 270, the maintenance of an impenetrable solid frontier was abandoned by [[Constantine I]] in favor of a policy, whether deliberate or forced by circumstance, of "[[defense in depth]]". This called for the maintenance of a softer, deeper perimeter area of defense, with concentrated hard points throughout its depth. The idea was that any invading force of a sufficient size could penetrate the initial perimeter but in doing so with any element of surprise or rapid movement would be forced to leave several defended hard points (fortresses) to its rear, hampering its lines of supply and communications, and threatening surrounding of the force.

In the very late Empire the frontiers became even more elastic, with little effort expended in maintaining frontier defense. Instead, armies were concentrated near the heart of the empire, and enemies allowed to penetrate in cases as far inwards as the Italian peninsula before being met in battle.

==Northern borders==

===Britannia===
After conquering much of the modern landmass of [[Great Britain]], the Romans halted their northern expansion at the southern fringe of [[Caledonia]], what is now [[Central Belt|central Scotland]]. This left them with a border shared with a people who made repeated raids and insurrections against them. Unlike other borders throughout the empire, there was no natural border to fall back on such as desert or wide river that crossed the whole peninsula, so instead a series of defenses were built in southern to mid-Scotland in order to protect the province of ''Britannia'' from the Caledonians and later the [[Picts]].

[[Image:Hadrians Wall from Housesteads1.jpg|200px|thumb|left|[[Hadrian's Wall]] viewed from [[Vercovicium]]]]
Although the border was not a continuous wall, a series of fortifications known as [[Gask Ridge]] in mid-Scotland may well be Rome's earliest fortified land frontier. Constructed in the '''70CE''' or '''80CE''', it was superseded by the later [[Hadrian's Wall]] forty years later and then the final [[Antonine Wall]] twenty years after that. Rather than representing a series of consecutive advancements, the border should be seen as fluctuating - the Antonine Wall for example was built between 142 and 144, abandoned by 164 and briefly re-occupied in 208.

Although records are scarce, there are indications that the border fluctuated between the various fortifications depending on the local strength of the military. There is archaeological evidence for widespread burning of fortifications, but it is disputed whether this represents fortifications falling to attack or part of the normal process of the Roman military to destroy their own fortified camps on abandonment so as not to furnish the enemy with a fortified base at their expense.

These northern fortifications are sometimes styled the ''Limes Britannicus''. The average garrison of the wall fortifications is thought to have been around 10,000 men. Along with a continuous wall (except in the case of Gask Ridge), there existed a metaled road immediately behind the wall for transport of troops. Along the wall there existed a few large forts for [[Roman legion|legions]] or [[vexillation]]s, as well as a series of [[milecastle]]s - effectively watchtowers that were unable to defend a stretch of wall against anything but low-scale raiding but were able to signal attack to legionary forts by means of fire signals atop the towers.

In the later Empire, Roman Britannia found itself increasingly vulnerable to external aggression, in parallel to attacks felt across the length of the Empire's borders. However, since Britannia shared no land bridge with continental Europe, the method of attack and thus methods of defense varied from the imperial standard. A series of naval forts was built along the south east coast, initially to combat piracy but later to protect from raiding and the threat of invasion from Saxons that eventually led to the Saxon occupation of Lowland Britain by 600 and is reflected in the name of the fortification system: the [[Saxon Shore]], which extended to the northern coasts of France. Each shore fort both protected against direct attack and also sheltered a small naval sub-fleet of vessels that could patrol the coast against pirates and raiders.

===Continental Europe===
[[Image:004 Conrad Cichorius, Die Reliefs der Traianssäule, Tafel IV (Ausschnitt 02).jpg|thumb|Roman watchtower and beacon on the lower Danube frontier]]

In continental Europe, the borders were generally well defined, usually following the courses of major rivers such as the [[Rhine]] and the [[Danube]]. Nevertheless, those were not always the final border lines: the original province of [[Dacia]], in modern [[Romania]], was completely north of the Danube, and the province of ''[[Germania Magna]]'',{{citation needed|date=September 2013}} which should not be confused with ''[[Germania Inferior]]'' and ''[[Germania Superior]]'', was the land between the Rhine, the Danube and the [[Elbe]] (Although this province was lost three years after its creation as a result of the [[Battle of Teutoburg Forest]]). The ''limes'' that ran across the line of the Rhine-Danube was known as the [[Limes Germanicus]]. It consisted of:
*The Lower (Northern) Germanic Limes, which extended from the North Sea at Katwijk in the Netherlands along the Rhine;
*The Upper Germanic Limes (just to be confusing, also called the Rhaetian Limes or simply "the Limes") started from the Rhine at Rheinbrohl (Neuwied (district)) across the Taunus mountains to the river Main (East of Hanau), then along the Main to Miltenberg, and from Osterburken (Neckar-Odenwald-Kreis) south to Lorch (Ostalbkreis) in a nearly perfect straight line of more than 70&amp;nbsp;km;
*The proper Rhaetian Limes extended east from Lorch to Eining (close to Kelheim) on the Danube. The total length was {{convert|568|km|mi|abbr=on}}. It included at least 60 castles and 900 watchtowers.

In ''[[Dacia]]'', the limes between the Black Sea and the Danube were a mix of the camps and the wall defenses: the ''[[Limes Moesiae]]'' was the conjunction of two, and sometimes three, lines of ''vallum'', with a Great Camp and many minor camps spread through the fortifications.

==Eastern borders==
The eastern borders changed many times, of which the most enduring was the [[Euphrates]] river, bordering the [[Parthian Empire]] in modern [[Iran]] and western [[Iraq]]. Rome advanced beyond the Euphrates for a time upon defeating their rivals, the [[Parthia]]ns in 116 AD, when [[Trajan]] captured [[Ctesiphon]], and established new provinces in [[Assyria]] and [[Babylonia]]. Later that year he took the Parthian capital, [[Susa]], and deposed the Parthian King [[Osroes I]]. However, the Romans did not [[Romanization|Romanize]] the entire Parthian Empire, leaving [[Parthamaspates]] as a [[Puppet state|puppet king]] on the throne to rule over former Parthian lands with the exclusion of modern Iraq, which became [[Assyria (Roman province)|Assyria]] and [[Mesopotamia]].

==Southern borders==
At its greatest extent, the southern borders were the deserts of Arabia and the Sahara, that represented a natural barrier to prevent expansion. The Empire controlled the Mediterranean shores and the mountains opposite. However the Romans attempted twice to occupy effectively the [[Siwa Oasis]] (and failed) and controlled the [[Nile]] many miles into Africa until the [[1st Cataract]] near the modern border between Egypt and Sudan.

For ''Mauretania'' there was a single wall with forts on both sides of it. In other places, such as ''[[Syria (Roman province)|Syria]]'' and ''[[Arabia Petraea]]'', there was instead a network of border settlements and forts occupied by the Roman army.

*''[[Limes Arabicus]]'', (called the ''Limes Uranus'') was the frontier of the Roman province of [[Arabia Petraea]] facing the desert.
*''[[Limes Tripolitanus]]'' was the frontier in modern Libya facing the Sahara.

==Western borders==

The western borders were mainly protected by the Atlantic coast and unfortified.

'''''Special Illumination: The Sufi Use Of Humour''''' is a book by the writer [[Idries Shah]] published [[Octagon Press]] in 1977. Later editions were published in 1983, 1989 and 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Amazon.com page on Special Illumination: The Sufi Use Of Humour&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly before he died, Shah stated that his books form a complete course that could fulfil the function he had fulfilled while alive. As such, ''Special Illumination'' can be read as part of a whole course of study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==Content==

[[File:Idries Shah.gif|thumb|left|100px|Idries Shah]]
''Special Illumination'' was the phrase used by Jalaludin [[Rumi]] to stress the importance of humour in relation to mystical experience; 'If you want special illumination look upon the human face: See clearly within laughter the Essence of Ultimate Truth.'

Presenting commentaries, stories and jokes, Shah writes; ‘Rumi directly contradicts such numerous sour-faced religionists as, in all persuasions, find that humour disturbs the indoctrination which is all that they usually have to offer.’

==Reception==

In the essay ''The Sufis and Idries Shah'', the [[Nobel Prize]]–winning novelist [[Doris Lessing]] writes that the book is about the Sufi use of humour, not an academic treatise, and takes the reader "through a sequence of tales, explaining possible meanings." She tells us that "Shah warns not to fall in love with the great classics of the past. 'People study Rumi and turn themselves into perfect replicas of 14th century people.' For classics to be of use, we need a Sufi to choose the parts that are still relevant, and put them into our context — to 'unlock' them."&lt;ref name="TimeBites"&gt;{{cite book

The '''Station Theatre''' is a small amateur dramatics theatre located in the village of West Town, [[Hayling Island]], [[Hampshire]], [[England]] which is run for the people of Hayling Island. It was converted from the derelict railway [[goods shed]] into a 144-seat theatre by [http://www.hants.gov.uk/hayling_dramatics/index.htm Hayling Island Amateur Dramatic Society (HIADS)].
The theatre is run entirely by volunteer members for the non-profit making Hayling Island Amateur Dramatic Society (HIADS) who put on five shows a year, including a pantomime, and one show performed by HIYA an affiliated group of young actors.  The theatre also hosts visiting groups from on and off the island.
The Station Theatre is equipped with modern lighting and sound systems, has stepped seating for 144, a licensed bar, a coffee bar, wheelchair access, hearing loop and free car parking.

{{italic title}}
'''''Světozor''''' ("Seeing the World") was a [[Czech language]] illustrated magazine published in 19th and 20th century.

==History and profile==
''Světozor'' was created by [[Pavel Josef Šafařík]] in 1834. Šafařík was inspired by the British [[penny press]] and the German ''[[Das Pfennig-Magazin|Pfennig-Magazin]]''. The newspaper, trying to entertain the readers with curiosities, did not incite much interest and closed down in two years.

In 1867 the magazine was reestablished by [[František Skrejšovský]] (1837–1902), an entrepreneur and politician. A substantial portion of the weekly was dedicated to the literature and the arts. Since 1899 for more than 30 years the magazine was owned by the publishing house of [[Jan Otto]]. Between 1933–1939 the magazine was owned by leftist journalist and photographer [[Pavel Altschul]] (1900–1944).

==Other notable uses==
''Světozor'' is also name of a large (700 seats) cinema built in 1918 in [[Prague]]. There seems to be no relation with the magazine. The building serves as a cinema and an [[arthouse]] until today: [http://www.kinosvetozor.cz/ website], [http://www.kinosvetozor.cz/_download/svetozor_history.pdf history].

==History==
The Workshop was founded in 1937 following the dissolution of the [[Liga de Escritores y Artistas Revolucionarios]] (LEAR, Revolutionary Writers’ and Artists’ League), a group of artists who had supported the goals of the [[Mexican Revolution]].

Initially called the Taller Editorial de Gráfica Popular, its founders built off a rich tradition of printmaking in Mexico, particularly the legacy of [[José Guadalupe Posada]] and [[Manuel Manilla]].

Under President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]], the work of the Taller supported the government's policies, including the [[Mexican oil expropriation]].

In 1940, muralist [[David Alfaro Siqueiros]] launched an armed assault on the residence of exiled [[Russian Revolution]]ary [[Leon Trotsky]], using the Taller's print shop as a headquarters and including some artists affiliated with the Taller in his squad.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

There was some collaboration between the TGP and the artists of the [[New Deal]]-era [[Works Progress Administration]], including [[Rafael Tufiño]].

During the [[Civil Rights Movement]], [[Chicano]] and [[African American art]]ists such as [[Elizabeth Catlett]] produced work at the Taller. The Taller became inspiration to many politically active leftist artists; for example, American expressionist painter [[Byron Randall]] went on to found similar artist collectives after becoming an associate member.&lt;ref&gt;Makin, Jean, ed.

The TGP faced financial instability and had to relocate several times, but [[Jesús Alvarez Amaya]] kept it running up to his death in 2010.

==Work==
During its heyday, the Taller specialized in linoleum prints and woodcuts. It produced posters, handbills, banners, and portfolio editions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

  | accessdate =2009-11-29 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The art supported causes such as [[anti-militarism]], [[organized labor]], and [[antifascism|opposition to fascism]].
 
The art was often made through the collaborative process, and the Taller took the anti-commercial policy of not numbering prints, but it sold prints as part of and was the first political publishing workshop in Mexico to do so.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Under the brand ''La Estampa Mexicana'', the TGP sold song lyrics, posters of heroes and Mexican culture and Left movements worldwide, and gave rise to a new generation of ''calaveras'', the Mexican tradition of humorous poetry ridiculing politicians and other popular figures. The [[raised fist]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.docspopuli.org/articles/Bancroft/BANC_PIC_2001_206.html Mexican posters on social and educational themes]&lt;/ref&gt; emerged as a graphic symbol of resistance and unity.

It still working on art and social issues and it is located in Dr. Villada 46, Colonia Doctores, [[Mexico City]].

'''''The Beginner's Guide''''' is an [[interactive storytelling]] [[video game]] created by Davey Wreden under the studio name Everything Unlimited Ltd. The game was released for [[Microsoft Windows]], [[OS X]] and [[Linux]] on October 1, 2015. The game is Wreden's follow-up to the critically praised ''[[The Stanley Parable]]'', his previous interactive storytelling title that was initially released in 2011.

The game is narrated by Wreden and takes the user through a number of incomplete and abstract game creations made by a developer named Coda. Wreden challenges the player to try to come to understand the type of person Coda is from exploring these spaces in a [[first-person perspective]]. Within the narrative, the player discovers that Wreden had tried to force meaning onto Coda's games, causing them to end their relationship. Wreden has stated the game is open to interpretation: some have seen the game as general commentary on the nature of the relationship between game developers and players, while others have taken it as an allegory to Wreden's own personal struggles with success resulting from ''The Stanley Parable''.

The game received mixed to positive reviews. Many reviewers readily took to the narrative and the questions and ideas it raised on game development, while others felt the game forced some of Wreden's thoughts too hard and in a pretentious manner.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay in ''The Beginner's Guide'' is presented in a [[first-person perspective]] allowing the player to move about and explore the environment and interact with some elements of it as they progress along the work's [[interactive storytelling]]. The player hears details of the various scenes they explore via the game's narrator, Wreden himself, to describe what they see and make conclusions on the nature of the games' developer. Some areas include puzzle solving and [[conversation tree]]s, but there is no way for the player-character to die, or the player to make a mistake or lose the game.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt; The narration helps the player get past certain parts of the game-spaces that were otherwise difficult or insuperable as designed, such as by providing a bridge to cross an invisible maze after the player discovers the difficulty. Once the player has completed a chapter, they can then return to any of them within the game, as well as disable the narration (and the help it provides) to explore the spaces on their own. The game has [[metafiction]]al elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.wired.com/2016/01/metafiction-games/ | title = The Best New Videogames Are All About … Videogames | first = Jake | last = Muncy | date = January 18, 2016 | website = [[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] | publisher = [[Condé Nast]] | accessdate = January 22, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
[[File:The beginners guide screenshot.png|thumb|right|In one of Coda's games, Wreden as the narrator, by removing the visibility of some walls, shows to the user the numerous inaccessible corridors that were programmed into this game.]]
The concept of the game is based on trying to understand the nature of a person based on exploring files and documents on their computer without any other notes or documentation or knowing this person in the first place. In the game, the player, aided by Wreden's narration, looks to understand that of a game developer named Coda whom Wreden had met at a [[game jam]] in 2009. Coda is considered enigmatic, having created numerous strange game ideas which he has subsequently deleted or stored away and forgotten. The player explores these games, most being [[exploration game]]s developed from 2008 to 2011&lt;ref name="paste review"/&gt; that were only half-created, and is encouraged by Wreden's narration to try to imagine what Coda's personality would be like based on the abstract and unconventional game spaces and ideas.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-10-01-the-beginners-guide-review|title=The Beginner's Guide review|work=[[Eurogamer]]|first=Jeffrey|last=Matulef|date=October 1, 2015|accessdate=October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Beginner's Guide'' is presented in generally chronological order of Coda's prototypes, showing the progression of Coda's work as the developer learned more.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"/&gt;

Wreden's narration explains that he was inspired by many of Coda's game concepts, providing his own analysis on many of the themes he perceived to appear in Coda's games. However, Wreden had seen that many of the games are based on themes of prisons, isolation, and difficulty in communicating with others, and as Coda's games took a darker tone and took much longer to produce, focusing even more strongly on dialogue that implied that game development was no longer a positive activity for Coda. Wreden felt concerned that Coda was feeling depressed and weighed down by game development, and took it upon himself to show some of Coda's game concepts to others to get feedback to help encourage Coda to develop more. However, this in turn led to Coda to draw into seclusion. At some point in 2011, Wreden believed Coda had stopped making games, until he was sent an email with a private link to a final game by Coda.

This game, its design in stark contrast to the others Coda had made, included puzzles that were nearly unsolvable and a door that could not be opened from within the game. Wreden found that when he was able to use various programming tools to bypass these, he ended up in a gallery with a message from Coda directed at him, asking him not to talk to him any more nor to showcase his games to others. The messages implied Coda felt that Wreden mistook the tone of his games as a sign of an emotional struggle and was missing the point of why he had engaged in game design, as well as accusing Wreden with modifying Coda's games to add more symbolism, and that Wreden's actions had betrayed Coda. As a result, Wreden felt terrible about what he had done, and thus reveals that the purpose of ''The Beginner's Guide'' was to try to reconnect to Coda by sharing his games with the public at large and to hope to apologize for his actions.&lt;ref name="boing boing"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://boingboing.net/2015/10/02/the-beginners-guide-is-a-gam.html|title=The Beginner's Guide is a game that doesn't want to be written about|first=Laura|last=Hudson|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015|work=[[Boing Boing]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game concludes with an [[epilogue]] level with Wreden sparsely narrating about his dependence on [[social validation]], something he saw as the cause for showing Coda's games to other people.

===Interpretations===
Within the game, Wreden states that ''The Beginner's Guide'' is open to interpretation and invites players to share their own theories with him, providing his email address near the start of the game.&lt;ref name="kotaku review"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/the-beginners-guide-tackles-the-fears-we-dont-talk-abou-1734268227|title=The Beginner's Guide Tackles The Fears We Don't Talk About|first=Patrick|last=Klepick|date=October 2, 2015|accessdate=October 2, 2015|work=[[Kotaku]]|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One common interpretation is that the game is a metaphor for Wreden's own success and attempts to move past his struggles, with Coda being a fictional developer created for the game. ''[[Destructoid]]'' writer Darren Nakamura points out that for Wreden to publish a game at cost that is claimed to be the work of someone else, released without their permission, would be illegal, and thus providing evidence that Coda must be part of the game's fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/the-paradox-of-selling-the-beginner-s-guide-313521.phtml | title = The paradox of selling The Beginner's Guide | first = Darren | last = Nakamura | date = October 3, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2015 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emanuel Maiberg of ''Motherboard'' theorizes that Coda is in fact Wreden himself, with Coda representing Wreden's own psyche up to and including the release of ''[[The Stanley Parable]]''. Among other hints in the game, Maiberg explains that the name "Coda" can be taken as its definition, meaning "a concluding part of a literary or dramatic work", and the theme of closing one door and moving on repeats frequently in the game. Maiberg also points to one of the game concepts where the player in Coda's game is inundated with abstract figures from the press, and considers how much attention Wreden had received following ''The Stanley Parable''{{'}}s re-release.&lt;ref name="motherboard"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://motherboard.vice.com/read/step-inside-the-labyrinthine-mind-of-a-game-developer-in-the-beginners-guide | title = Step Inside the Labyrinthine Mind of a Game Developer in 'The Beginner's Guide' | first = Emanuel | last = Maiberg | work = Motherboard | publisher = [[Vice Media]] | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 2, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Christopher Byrd, writing for the ''[[Washington Post]]'', points to blog posts made by Wreden after he had received a great deal of attention following the re-release of ''The Stanley Parable'', and that the game's version of Wreden is really a fictionalized version of himself acting as an [[unreliable narrator]], building upon his own personal experiences from the sudden media spotlight in the relationship between the fictional Wreden and Coda.&lt;ref name="wapost"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2015/10/08/the-beginners-guide-to-blurring-the-lines-between-video-games-and-interactive-art/ | title = ‘The Beginners Guide’ to blurring the lines between video games and interactive art | first = Christopher | last = Byrd | date = October 8, 2015 | accessdate = October 8, 2015 | work = [[Washington Post]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Interactive fiction writer [[Emily Short]] believes that neither Wreden-as-narrator or Coda are to be taken as Wreden's own self, but instead two representative characters of the game player and game developer, respectively, that Wreden attempts to show sympathy for in modern game development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://boingboing.net/2015/10/12/lets-talk-more-about-the-beg.html | title = Let's talk more about The Beginner's Guide, a game about games | work = [[Boing Boing]] | date = October 12, 2015 | accessdate = October 13, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another interpretative theme taken by some is that the game is presented as commentary on the role between the video game developer and their audience. ''[[PC World]]''{{'}}s Hayden Dingman believed the game was designed to demonstrate the fallacy of the ''[[Death of the Author]]'' essay applied to video game development, in which commentators attempt to attribute aspects of a game to how the game developer approached it, as opposed to considering how the game affected themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.pcworld.com/article/2989032/software-games/the-beginners-guide-review-a-weird-fiercely-personal-game.html | title = The Beginner's Guide review: A weird, fiercely personal game | first = Hayden | last = Dingman | date = October 3, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2015 | work = [[PC World]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Gamasutra]]'s editor-in-chief Kris Graft notes that, as the game attempts to deconstruct the way players will interpret narrative video games, any attempt to interpret the deeper meaning behind ''The Beginner's Guide'' is paradoxically "committing all of the sins" that the game presents as problems with player interpretations of games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/KrisGraft/20151012/255997/Creativity_as_an_open_question_Random_thoughts_on_The_Beginners_Guide.php | title = Creativity as an open question: Random thoughts on The Beginner's Guide | first = Kris | last = Graft | date = October 12, 2015 | accessdate = October 12, 2015 | publisher = [[Gamasutra]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Laura Mandanas, writing for Autostraddle, described the game as "a man (poorly) coming to terms with his hugely overinflated sense of entitlement", interpreting the game's themes as not only applicable to game development, but also to inter-personal relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autostraddle.com/the-beginners-guide-is-brilliant-horrifying-secretly-feminist-310119/|title="The Beginner’s Guide" Is Brilliant, Horrifying, Secretly Feminist|date=October 7, 2015|publisher=|accessdate=November 14, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some have taken the game to be a work of non-fiction, in that the games presented are works of a real developer other than Wreden, and that the game itself could be seen an unethical use of someone else's work and potentially copyrighting-violating. In considering this aspect, ''[[Destructoid]]''{{'}}s Laura Kate Dale commented with later clarification that the game was short enough to fall within the Steam [[Money back guarantee|refund]] window for those that believed the game was non-fiction and thus contain stolen works to return the game.&lt;ref name="dtoid best new ip"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.destructoid.com/the-best-new-ips-of-2015-327259.phtml | title = The best new IPs of 2015 | first = Laura Kate | last = Dale | date = December 18, 2015 | accessdate = December 23, 2015 | work = [[Destructoid]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dale's statement, prior to clarification, led to some controversy in that Dale was suggesting misuse of the Steam refund system, though her clarification made it clear she was addressing those believing it to be non-fiction. The controversy led some to point out that the interpretation of the game was very personal, differing between each player; Wreden himself in light of the controversy refused to affirm or deny any interpretation of the game, until confirming the game's ultimately fictional nature in an in-depth interview with the podcast Tone Control.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://kotaku.com/the-controversy-over-a-video-games-suggestion-of-a-crim-1749448664 | title = The Controversy Over A Video Game's Suggestion Of A Crime | work = [[Kotaku]] | first = Patrick | last = Klepek | date = December 23, 2015 | accessdate = December 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamasutra.com/blogs/PaulKilduffTaylor/20151221/262335/The_Beginners_Guide_to_Interpretation.php | title = The Beginner’s Guide to Interpretation | work = [[Gamasutra]] | first = Paul Kilduff | last = Taylor | date = December 21, 2015 | accessdate = December 23, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.idlethumbs.net/forums/topic/11946-tone-control-season-2-episode-6-davey-wreden/|title=Tone Control Season 2 Episode 6: Davey Wreden|website=Idle Forums|language=en-US|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
''The Beginner's Guide'' was developed on the [[Source (game engine)|Source]] engine, which itself serves as part of Wreden's commentary within the game on the nature of level design limited by the Source engine.&lt;ref name="avclub"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.avclub.com/review/beginners-guide-wants-intimacy-then-again-were-all-226170 | title = The Beginner’s Guide wants intimacy, but then again, we’re all so alone | first = Jake | last = Muncy | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 | work = [[The A.V. Club]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wreden has stated that he does not plan to give media interviews about the game and is letting the game speak for itself.&lt;ref name="motherboard"/&gt;

''The Beginner's Guide'' was announced by Wreden two days before its official release on October 1, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.ign.com/articles/2015/09/29/the-stanley-parable-co-creator-to-launch-new-game-the-beginners-guide-this-week | title = The Stanley Parable Co-Creator to Launch New Game The Beginner's Guide This Week | work = [[IGN]] | first =  Cassidee | last = Moser | date = September 29, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The game was developed by Wreden himself; his co-creator for ''The Stanley Parable'', William Pugh, had been engaged in creating a new studio, Crows Crows Crows, and working on projects with [[Justin Roiland]], the co-creator of ''[[Rick and Morty]]'', with one title being a similar exploration game, ''[[Dr. Langeskov, The Tiger, and The Terribly Cursed Emerald: A Whirlwind Heist]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2015-09-29-the-stanley-parable-creator-reveals-the-beginners-guide | title = The Stanley Parable creator reveals The Beginner's Guide | first = Jeffrey | last = Matulef | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 | work = [[Eurogamer]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | url =  http://www.pcgamer.com/creature-prison-inside-the-vr-designs-of-rick-and-mortys-co-creator/ | title = Creature prison: The VR designs of Rick and Morty's co-creator | work = [[PC Gamer]] | date = September 29, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 | first = Tyler | last = Wilde }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Beginner's Guide'' received mixed to positive reviews on its release. Several reviewers were very positive about the allusions it made to game development. Jeffrey Matulef of ''[[Eurogamer]]'' considered ''The Beginner's Guide'' to be one of the site's "Essential" titles, calling the game a novel approach to providing story without relying on [[non-player character]]s or collectible diaries, and also an insight into Wreden's own psyche.&lt;ref name="eurogamer review"/&gt;
[[Stephanie Bendixsen]] and [[Steven O'Donnell (Australian actor)|Steven O'Donnell]] of ''[[Good Game (television series)|Good Game]]'' both gave the game five stars, O'Donnell calling it "gut-wrenchingly emotional" and Bendixsen commenting that the game "honestly made me experience the whole creative process in a completely different way."&lt;ref name="ABC Review"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.abc.net.au/tv/goodgame/stories/s4335154.htm |title=The Beginner's Guide |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=October 20, 2015  |work=Good Game |publisher=[[Australian Broadcasting Corporation|ABC]] |access-date=November 12, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Edmond Tran of ''[[GameSpot]]'', giving the game an 8 of 10 rating, identifies that the game asks philosophical questions on the nature of the role between game developers and players, and how to understand some elements of video game design.&lt;ref name="gamespot review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-beginners-guide-review/1900-6416261/ | title = The Beginner's Guide Review | first = Edmond | last = Tran | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 | work = [[GameSpot]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Paste (magazine)|Paste]]''{{'}}s Cameron Kunzelman compared Wreden's self-insertion as the narrator to that of [[Alfred Hitchcock]], and suggested that Wreden's [[Janus]]-like duality between being the game's narrator as well as the game's developer poses many questions for the player to think about regarding the nature of video game development.&lt;ref name="paste review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2015/10/the-beginners-guide-review-good-evening.html | title = The Beginner's Guide Review: Good Evening | first = Cameron | last = Kunzelman | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 | work = [[Paste (magazine)|Paste]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeff Marchiafava for ''[[Game Informer]]'', rating the game 8 out of 10, stated that Wreden's approach to the game created a thought-provoking experience, "tackling serious human issues and emotions in a wholly unique way."&lt;ref name="gameinformer review"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.gameinformer.com/games/the_beginners_guide/b/pc/archive/2015/10/01/searching-for-answers.aspx | title = The Beginner's Guide | first = Jeff | last = Marchiafava | work = [[Game Informer]] | date = October 1, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Todd Martens, writing for the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', said that ''The Beginner's Guide'' is "an odd, thoughtful and beautifully surreal game" with much of its imagery being iconic and memorable well after the player has finished the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/herocomplex/la-et-hc-1002-theplayer-beginners-guide-20151005-story.html | title = Can a video game make you a better friend?

Other reviewers criticized the game, finding the narration and intended message was too forced. Brittany Vincent of ''[[Shacknews]]'' was more critical of the game, rating it 3 out of 10, and stating that the narration was pretentious while the game concepts felt forced and overly complex.&lt;ref name="Shacknews"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.shacknews.com/article/91572/the-beginners-guide-review-wreden-begin-again | title = The Beginner's Guide Review: Wreden, Begin Again | work = [[Shacknews]] | first = Brittany | last = Vincent | date = October 2, 2015 | accessdate = October 1, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Ars Technica]]''{{'}}s Sam Machkovech called the game Wreden's "[[sophomore slump]]", and felt that while the game was intended as a personal journal for Wreden, his emotion-driven narration telegraphed the final moments of the game and failed to follow "[[Show, don't tell]]" narrative techniques.&lt;ref name="arstech"&gt;{{cite web | url = https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2015/10/the-beginners-guide-review-failure-is-as-failure-does/ | title = The Beginner’s Guide review: Failure is as failure does | work = [[Ars Technica]] | first = Sam | last = Machkovech | date = October 3, 2015 | accessdate = October 3, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[US Gamer]]''{{'}}s Bob Mackey rated the game 2 of 5 stars, sharing the same opinion as Machkovech that Wreden's narration pushed too much interpretation onto the player, and felt a game like ''[[The Magic Circle (video game)|The Magic Circle]]'', also dealing with exploring an unfinished game and the reasons for why it was unfinished, succeeded better at presenting this idea.&lt;ref name="usgamer review"&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.usgamer.net/articles/the-beginners-guide-pc-review-a-walking-tour-of-writers-block | title = The Beginner's Guide PC Review: A Walking Tour of Writer's Block | first= Bob | last = Mackey | work = [[US Gamer]] | date = October 5, 2015 | accessdate = October 5, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tyler Wilde of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' gave the game a 69 out of 100 rating, feeling that some of Wreden's messages were delivered a bit heavy-handed through the narration but still positively critiques some of the experimental approaches that were used for narration and player experience.&lt;ref name="PCGamerReview"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/the-beginners-guide-review/ | title = The Beginner's Guide Review | work = [[PC Gamer]] | first=  Tyler | last = Wilde | date = October 5, 2015 | accessdate = October 6, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Enraged Musician''''' is a 1741 [[etching]] and [[engraving]] by English artist [[William Hogarth]] which depicts a comic scene of a violinist driven to distraction by the cacophony outside his window. It was issued as companion piece to the third state of his print of ''[[The Distrest Poet]]''.

==Background==
In November 1740, Hogarth advertised his intention to issue a three-image set: ''The Provok'd Musician'', ''[[The Distrest Poet]]'', and a third image on the subject of "Painting" . The third image was never completed, and the two other prints were issued together in November 1741. The engraving appears to be based on an oil sketch held in the [[Ashmolean Museum]] in [[Oxford]], though there are some differences between the monochrome sketch and the engraving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/servlet/ViewWork?cgroupid=999999961&amp;workid=6634&amp;searchid=10433&amp;tabview=text|title=The Enraged Musician|publisher=Tate|accessdate=7 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Picture==

The image is ostensibly a purely comic scene. While the violinist attempts to rehearse, the noisiest inhabitants of London pass by his window. On the far left a squawking parrot perches above a pregnant ballad-seller singing "The Ladies' Fall" while holding her bawling baby. A young girl with a rattle (otherwise [[ratchet (instrument)]]) looks with amazement at a boy urinating below the musician's window (this is an often repeated image in Hogarth's work: similar scenes can be seen in ''[[The March to Finchley]]'' and in his illustrations for ''[[Hudibras]]'' and may be a reference to [[John Gay]]'s "[[Trivia (poem)|Trivia]]").&lt;ref&gt;Paulson p.145&lt;/ref&gt; The boy has a cord tied round his waist attached to a trailing slate which would clatter along the ground as he ran. In the centre of the picture a young milk-seller calling her wares provides the real focus of the picture; though set back more from the viewer than some of the subjects, she appears larger than the children and the crouching figure of the cutler. She balances a large pail of milk on her head and is the only subject that looks out at the viewer. This, combined with the large expanse of white apron, draws the viewer's eye towards her. [[Ronald Paulson]], the modern authority on Hogarth, suggests that she is singing and that her beauty and grace—she delicately lifts her skirt to avoid dragging it through the boy's urine—mark her out as the only natural musician in the scene; while the other inhabitants of the street produce discordant notes, the music of the violinist would be no better, because he has restricted himself by his studies and by removing himself from nature. He covers his ears to block out the cacophony of the street noise, but at the same time he denies himself the sweet music of the milkmaid's voice.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson p.115&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Laroon the merry milk maid.jpg|thumb|left|[[John Savage (engraver)|John Savage]]'s etching of [[Marcellus Laroon]]'s (c.1688) ''The Merry Milk Maid''. Images of the ''Cryes'' genre may have been a target of Hogarth's satire; Laroon's ''The Cryes of the City of London'' was the most popular series of this type during Hogarth's lifetime.]]
The milkmaid is flanked on either side by street musicians: to her right a man plays a [[oboe|hautboy]], metaphorically thumbing his nose at the violinist; and to her left a small boy beats a drum. Behind the milkmaid, a paviour beats the ground with a heavy rammer. In the lower right-hand corner a dog barks at the racket created by a knife-grinder sharpening a cleaver. Behind these characters, a host of street vendors noisily announce their services: a dustman with a basket on his back rings a handbell, a sow-gelder blows a horn, and a [[fishmonger]] cups his hand to his mouth as he shouts. In the distance there is a hint of yet more noise. A church—traditionally identified as [[St Martin-in-the-Fields]] yet closer in form to [[St Giles-in-the-Fields]]&lt;ref&gt;Barlow p.200&lt;/ref&gt;—flies a flag, suggesting perhaps an important event during which bells would be rung. The building to the right is the works of pewterer John Long, from which would issue a constant ring of hammers, and on its roof two hissing cats with arched backs prepare to fight. Appearing from the chimney is a sweep who may be calling to an unseen colleague that his work is done. In the lower left corner some loose bricks—suggestive of building works out of view—have been piled up (no doubt noisily) into a little house. The long-nosed violinist framed in the open window clamps his hands to ears in frustration.&lt;ref name="Hallett"&gt;Hallett p.138&lt;/ref&gt;

While the image entertains purely by the number of references to noisy activities crammed into the scene, the play-bill for Gay's ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', prominently displayed on the wall next to the musician's window, hints at developments in British music at the time. ''The Beggar's Opera'' had enjoyed extraordinary success and had caused, or at least coincided with, a shift in the taste of audiences away from Italian opera and towards "British" music and homegrown culture. Hogarth was an enthusiastic supporter of the change in public tastes. He had mocked the vogue for continental fashions in many of his works (''[[A Rake's Progress]]'' and ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'' both have scenes dedicated to the foolishness of the ''[[Levée]]'', and, in 1724, even before ''The Beggar's Opera'', in the earliest of his self-published satirical prints ''[[The Bad Taste of the Town]]'' Hogarth mocked the fashion for Italian opera and Italian opera singers). The play-bill here is anachronistic as it advertises the play with the original 1728 cast. The musician's identity has never been satisfactorily established. He is identified as an Italian both by Jean André Rouquet, whose French notes on the prints were approved by Hogarth, and by [[John Trusler]] who claimed Hogarth's widow's approval for his ''Hogarth Moralized''.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow p.201&lt;/ref&gt; He has been variously identified as a number of foreign musicians of the time, including "Corvetto, well known by the name of Nosee"&lt;ref name="Hogarth"&gt;Hogarth p.209&lt;/ref&gt; (probably [[Giacobbe Cervetto]], often caricaturized for his large nose), and [[Pietro Castrucci]], the leader of [[Handel]]'s orchestra. Handel had noted the shift in public taste himself, and from the 1730s he composed more English oratorio and theatre works, including the setting the works of [[John Milton|Milton]], [[John Dryden|Dryden]] and [[William Congreve (playwright)|Congreve]] to music.&lt;ref name="Hallett" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Hogarth" /&gt; Hogarth, as well as comically juxtaposing high and low culture, could be suggesting that a foreign tradition is being silenced by a burgeoning sense of Britishness. This may have been an afterthought though, as the playbill was not present in the earliest impressions, and the hautboy player and paver are usually respectively identified as Jewish and Irish, while the drummer boy is dressed in the same fashion as the young [[Huguenot]] leaving the church in ''Noon'', the second scene of Hogarth's ''[[Four Times of the Day]]''. The musician has also been identified as John Festin (mistakenly rendered as Foster in some accounts), a teacher of the flute and hautboy, by Hogarth's friend and biographer John Ireland and later by the commentator John Trusler. The story Festin told Hogarth obviously provided the inspiration for at least part of the scene:

{{quote|I once waited upon my lord Spencer, but his lordship being out of town, from him I went to Mr. V——n. It was so early that he was not arisen. I went into his chamber, and, opening a shutter, sat down in the window-seat. Before the rails was a fellow playing upon the hautboy. A man with a barrow full of onions offered the piper an onion if he would play him a tune. That ended, he offered a second onion for a second tune; the same for a third, and was going on: but this was too much; I could not bear it; it angered my very soul—'Zounds!' said I, 'stop here! This fellow is ridiculing my profession; he is playing on the hautboy for onions!'&lt;ref&gt;Trusler p.64&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The hautboy player has similarly defied identification. Charles Frederick Weideman, a leading London flautist, who had played the oboe earlier in his career, has been suggested as the flautist seen playing in plate 4 of ''[[Marriage à-la-mode (Hogarth)|Marriage à-la-mode]]'', and in ''The Enraged Musician: Hogarth's Musical Imagery'', Jeremy Barlow claims that he and the hautboy player are one and the same.&lt;ref&gt;Barlow p.204&lt;/ref&gt;
The presence of many street traders may also satirise [[Marcellus Laroon]]'s much-copied 17th-century prints of ''The Cryes of the City of London'' and more recent images by Hogarth's rival, [[Giacomo Amiconi]].

==Variations==
[[Image:Enragedmusician trial.jpg|thumb|right|The early trial was not as crowded or, by extension, as noisy, as the issued print. The character of the drummer boy was most changed between versions, but other subjects also underwent alterations, and more features were added.]]
An early trial impression was missing the church steeple, cats, the man blowing the horn and the play-bill. In this version the dustman was missing his nose (a sign that he was syphilitic), a doll was placed in the model brick house in the foreground, and the drummer boy sported a Grenadier's cap. The drummer was handsome and had turned to look towards the little girl. By the time the print was issued this suggestion of a domestic theme with the boy, girl, and house with "child" had been removed. The boy had his cap removed and his handsome face turned away from the girl and replaced by features which [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]] described as "idiotic".&lt;ref name="Hogarth" /&gt; The doll was removed and the girl given a rattle to add to the image of pure noise.&lt;ref&gt;Paulson. p.116&lt;/ref&gt; Later copies featured a black horse in place of the white horse ridden by the horn blower and showed cross-hatching on the sleeves of the ballad-seller and the play-bill. Later impressions also made the dog and grinder darker, while lightening the cap of the sow-gelder.&lt;ref name="Hogarth2"&gt;Hogarth p.210&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Man Without Qualities''''' ({{lang-de|Der Mann ohne Eigenschaften}}; 1930–1943) is an unfinished modernist [[novel]] in three volumes and various drafts, by the late Austrian writer [[Robert Musil]]. It is typically considered to be one of the most significant novels of the twentieth century.

The novel is a "story of ideas", which takes place in the time of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]]'s last days, and the plot often veers into allegorical dissections on a wide range of existential themes concerning humanity and feelings. It has a particular concern with the values of truth and opinion and how society organizes ideas about life and society, though the book is well over a thousand pages long in its entirety, and so no one single theme dominates.

==Plot summary==
The first book, entitled ''A Sort of Introduction'', is an introduction to the protagonist, a 32-year-old mathematician named Ulrich who is in search of a sense of life and reality but fails to find it. His ambivalence towards morals and indifference to life has brought him to the state of being "a man without qualities", depending on the outer world to form his character. A kind of keenly analytical passivity is his most typical attitude.

Musil once said that it is not particularly difficult to describe Ulrich in his main features. Ulrich himself only knows he is strangely indifferent to all his qualities. Lack of any profound essence and ambiguity as a general attitude to life are his principal characteristics.

Meanwhile, we meet a murderer and rapist, Moosbrugger, who is condemned for his murder of a prostitute. Other protagonists are Ulrich's mistress, Bonadea,&lt;ref&gt;Ironic usage of virginal Roman goddess name [[Bona Dea]]&lt;/ref&gt; and Clarisse, his friend Walter's neurotic wife, whose refusal to go along with commonplace existence leads to Walter's insanity.

In the second book, ''Pseudoreality Prevails'', Ulrich joins the so-called "Collateral Campaign" or "Parallel Campaign", frantic preparations for a celebration in honor of 70 years of the Austrian Emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph]]'s reign. That same year, 1918, the German Emperor [[Wilhelm II of Germany|Wilhelm II]] would be ruler of his country for 30 years. This coincidence stirs the Austrian patriots into a fury of action to demonstrate Austria's political, cultural, and philosophical supremacy via a feast which will capture the minds of the Austrian Emperor's subjects and people of the world forever. On that account, many bright ideas and visions are discussed (e.g., The Austrian Year 1918, The World Year 1918, The Austrian Peace Year 1918 or The Austrian World Peace Year 1918).

A couple of people take part in the organization team or catch the eye of Ulrich. Ermelinda Tuzzi, called [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]],&lt;ref&gt;The [[pseudonym]] is a [[Calque|literary loan]] from [[Diotima of Mantinea|Diotima]], a priestess and wise female tutor of [[Socrates]].&lt;/ref&gt; is Ulrich's cousin as well as the wife of a civil servant; she tries to become a Viennese [[muse]] of philosophy, inspiring whoever crosses her path; she miraculously attracts both Ulrich and Arnheim, a Prussian business magnate and prosaic writer whose character is based on the figure of [[Walter Rathenau]]. The nobleman in charge of the Campaign, the old conservative [[Count]] Leinsdorf, is incapable of deciding or even of not-deciding. General Stumm von Bordwehr of the Imperial and Royal Army is unpopular for his attempts in this generally mystical atmosphere to make things systematic and German businessman Paul Arnheim is an admirer of Diotima's combination of beauty and spirit, without feeling the need to marry her.

While most of the participants (Diotima most feverishly) try to associate the reign of Franz Joseph I with vague ideas of humanity, progress, tradition, and happiness, the followers of [[Realpolitik]] see a chance to exploit the situation: Stumm von Bordwehr wishes to get the Austrian army income raised and Arnheim plans to buy oil fields in an eastern province of Austria. Musil's great irony and satire is that what was planned as a celebration of peace and imperial cohesion in fact turns out as a path toward war, imperial collapse, and national chauvinism. The novel provides an analysis of all the political and cultural processes that contributed to the outbreak of World War I.

The last volume, entitled ''Into the Millennium (The Criminals)'', is about Ulrich's sister Agathe (who enters the novel at the end of the second book). They experience a mystically incestuous stirring upon meeting after their father's death. They see themselves as soulmates, or, as the book says, "Siamese twins".

As it was published, the novel ends in a large section of drafts, notes, false-starts and forays written by Musil as he tried to work out the proper ending for his book. In the German edition, there is even a CD-ROM available that holds thousands of pages of alternative versions and drafts.

==The history of the novel==
Musil worked on the novel for more than twenty years. He started in 1921 and spent the rest of his life writing it. When he died in 1942, the novel was not completed. The 1,074-page&lt;ref name="wiki"&gt;{{cite web

Part III did not include 20 chapters withdrawn from Vol. 2 of 1933 while in printer's galley proofs. From 1933 until death, Musil was working on Part III. In 1943 in Lausanne, Musil's widow Martha published a 462-page collection of material from literary remains including the 20 galley chapters withdrawn from Part III, as well as drafts of the final incomplete chapters and notes on the development and direction of the novel. ''The Man Without Qualities'' Vol. 1 was published in English first in 1953 in translation by Eithne Wilkins and Ernst Kaiser. Vol. 2 followed in 1955, and 3 – in 1961. (London: Secker &amp; Warburg, 1953, 1954, 1960, [http://chechoquerio.com.ar/kagome-robert-musil-jud/ first editions], 8vo [Octavo (max. 6x9 inches)]; New York: Coward-McCann, Inc., [http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/I/61V9d-ZCoYL.jpg first US editions]).

Musil's almost daily preoccupation with writing left his family in dire financial straits. The book brought neither fame nor fortune to him or his family. This was one of the reasons why he felt bitter and unrecognized during the last two decades of his life. The combination of poverty and a multitude of ideas is one of the most striking characteristics of Musil's biography.

There are strong autobiographical features to be found in the text as the main characters' ideas and attitudes are believed to be those of Musil.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}} Most of the aspects of the [[Vienna|Viennese]] life in the novel are based on history and Musil's life. The plot and the characters (with the exception of a short appearance of the Austrian emperor [[Franz Joseph I of Austria|Franz Joseph I]]) are invented (although some of them had inspirations in eminent Austrians and Germans). Elsa (Berta) von Czuber, whom Musil met while he studied in [[Brno]] between 1889 and 1901, inspired him with the image of Ulrich's sister Agathe. Donath and Alice Charlemont, Musil's friends, were models of Walter and Clarisse and Viennese socialite [[Eugenie Schwarzwald]] gave birth to the character of Diotima. Arnheim may have been based on [[Walther Rathenau]] and [[Thomas Mann]].

His detailed portrait of a decaying ''[[fin de siècle]]'' world is similar to those of [[Hermann Broch]]'s ''[[The Sleepwalkers (Broch novel)|The Sleepwalkers]]'', [[Karl Kraus (writer)|Karl Kraus]]' ''The Last Days of Mankind'' or [[Stefan Zweig]]'s ''[[The World of Yesterday]]''.

Some of Musil's working titles were ''The Gutters'', ''Achilles'' (the original name of the main character Ulrich) or ''The Spy''.

==Style and structure==
Musil's monumental novel contains more than 1,700 pages (depending on edition) in three volumes, the last of which was published by Musil's wife after his death. The novel is famous for the irony with which Musil displays Austrian society shortly before [[World War I]]. 

The story takes place in 1913 in [[Vienna]], the capital of [[Austria-Hungary]], which Musil refers to by the playful term ''Kakanien''. The name Kakanien is derived from the German abbreviation ''K und K'' (pronounced "ka oond ka") for ''[[kaiserlich und königlich]]'' or "Imperial and Royal", used to indicate the status of Austria-Hungary as a Dual Monarchy.  But 'kaka' is also a child's word for faeces in German, just as in American English, and 'kakos' is a Greek term for ''bad'' borrowed by a number of words in German and English, and Musil uses the expression to symbolise the lack of political, administrative and sentimental coherence in [[Austria-Hungary]]. 

Musil elaborates on the paradoxes of the Kakanian way of life: "By its constitution it was liberal, but the system of government was clerical. The system of government was clerical, but the general attitude to life was liberal. Before the law all citizens were equal, but not everyone, of course, was a citizen." (Musil: ''The Man without Qualities'', Vol. 1: A Sort of Introduction, Chapter 8 – Kakanien).

The story contains approximately twenty characters of bizarre Viennese life, from the ''beau monde'' to the ''[[Demimonde|demi-monde]]'', including an aristocrat, an army officer, a banker, three [[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] wives, an intriguing chambermaid, a black pageboy, and last but not least a man who murders a prostitute.

The novel is told in the third-person omniscient point of view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2006/jun/17/featuresreviews.guardianreview28|title=Robert Musil: The Man without Qualities|last=Smiley|first=Jane|date=2006-06-16|website=the Guardian|language=en|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Italian writer [[Alberto Arbasino]], Fellini's 1963 film ''[[8½]]'' used similar artistic procedures and had parallels with Musil's novel.&lt;ref name="ArbasinoPedulla2000"&gt;Gabriele Pedullà, [[Alberto Arbasino]] [2000] [http://www.libraweb.net/articoli3.php?chiave=543&amp;rivista=23&amp;articolo=200302301011 ''Sull'albero di ciliegie''] [On the cherry tree] – ''Conversando di letteratura e di cinema con Alberto Arbasino'' in ''CONTEMPORANEA Rivista di studi sulla letteratura e sulla comunicazione'', Volume 1, 2003 quotation: {{quotation|Q. In alcuni tuoi scritti degli anni Sessanta – penso soprattutto a ''Certi romanzi'' – la riflessione critica sulla questione del romanzo (che cosa è il romanzo, cosa
l’antiromanzo, come si può e come si deve scrivere un’opera in prosa...) è sempre intrecciata, quando in modo più implicito, quando in modo più esplicito con la riflessione sul cinema. In particolare mi pare che la tua vicinanza con Fellini sia particolarmente significativa, per esempio nella tua recensione di ''Otto e mezzo'' per «''Il Giorno''».
A. Stavamo leggendo Musil e scoprivamo dei paralleli e dei procedimenti simili. E senza poter stabilire, né allora, né oggi, quanto ci fosse di Flaiano e quanto, invece, fosse proprio una intuizione sua.
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
'''English translation:''' (translated from Italian by Enzo Michelangeli &lt;enzomich@gmail.com&gt;)
&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Q. In some of your writings of the sixties – I'm now thinking mainly to ''Certi romanzi'' – critical musings on the issue of novel (what is ''novel'', what ''antiromanzo'', how one might and how one should write a work of prose...) are always intertwined, in some moments more plainly, in others more explicitly, with musings about cinema. In particular, your closeness to Fellini appears, to me, particularly significant – for example, in your review of ''8 1/2'' for the newspaper «''Il Giorno''».
A. We were reading Musil and discovering parallels and similar processes. And without ever being able to determine, either then or now, how much in the latter was attributable to Flaiano and how much, instead, was due to his own intuition.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Musil's aim (and that of his main character, Ulrich) was to arrive at a synthesis between strict scientific fact and the mystical, which he refers to as "the hovering life."

Musil originally opposed publishing only sections of his still unfinished work and later regretted submitting to his publisher's insistence, because what was already printed could not be subjected to further amendments. Some chapters were redacted by Musil from the printers after he has already sent them for publication. Critics speculate on the viability of Musil's original conception. Some estimate the intended length of the work to be twice as long as the text that survives.{{Citation needed|date=May 2009}}

==Plot==
The story begins in the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] province of [[Judea (Roman Province)|Judea]] with the portrayal of the [[Massacre of the Innocents]] in the Nativity. The remainder of the film portrays the [[annunciation]] (conception) and birth of [[Jesus Christ]] to explain why King [[Herod the Great]] ([[Ciarán Hinds]]) ordered the murder.

One year before the massacre, [[Zechariah (priest)|Zachariah]] ([[Stanley Townsend]]), a [[kohen|rabbi]] in Jerusalem, is making an offering, when he is told in a vision by the [[Archangel Gabriel]] that his wife, [[Elizabeth (Biblical person)|Elizabeth]] ([[Shohreh Aghdashloo]]), will bear a son. Zachariah does not believe him, stating that he is too old, and Gabriel tells him that he will be unable to speak until the boy is born. In [[Nazareth]], 14 year old [[Virgin Mary|Mary]] ([[Keisha Castle-Hughes]]) is farming when soldiers come to collect taxes. One man, unable to pay, has a third of his land seized and his daughter pressed into [[debt slavery]]. Mary, [[erusin|betrothed]] to marry 32 year old [[Saint Joseph|Joseph]] of Judaea ([[Oscar Isaac]]), is visited by Archangel Gabriel and told that she will become pregnant with God's son, whom she is to name "Jesus". He tells her that God has blessed her cousin Elizabeth with a child despite her old age. Mary visits her before the harvest, where she witnesses the birth of [[John the Baptist]] to Elizabeth and Zechariah, who regains his speech. Mary returns from the visit pregnant, to the shock of Joseph and her parents, who fear that Joseph will accuse her of adultery, a sin punishable by [[stoning|death by stoning]] according to the [[Torah]]. At first Joseph does not believe Mary's religious explanation, but decides not to accuse her. Still shocked and angry, he is later visited in a dream by the Archangel Gabriel, who tells him of God's plan for Mary's son. Finally believing, he is ashamed of his earlier doubts.

Meanwhile, Roman emperor [[Caesar Augustus]] has demanded that every man across the [[Roman Empire]] return with his family to his place of birth for the [[census]]. A direct descendant of [[King David]], Joseph is forced to travel {{convert|110|km|mi|sp=us}} across Palestine's rocky terrain from Nazareth to [[Bethlehem]], the place of his birth. With Mary on a donkey laden with supplies, it takes the couple nearly four weeks to reach Bethlehem. Upon arriving in town, Mary goes into labour, and Joseph frantically seeks a place for her to deliver. There is, however, no room in any inn or home because of the crowds arriving for the census, but at the last minute an innkeeper offers his stable for shelter.

Meanwhile, three Magi—[[Biblical Magi|Gaspar, Melchior and Balthasar]]—travel towards Judaea after having previously discovered that three planets will align to form a great star. This [[Star of Bethlehem]] appears before the Magi, after a visit by the Archangel Gabriel. The Magi visit Herod and reveal to him that the [[Messiah]] is still a child and he will be a Messiah "for the lowest of men to the highest of kings." Shocked by this, Herod asks that they visit the newborn Messiah and report the child's location back to him, under the pretence that he, too, would like to worship him, while in fact he plans to kill the baby for fear of a new king taking his throne. The Magi arrive at the stable where Mary is giving birth to Jesus, and they present the Infant with gifts of gold, [[frankincense]], and [[myrrh]].

Suspicious of his intentions, the Magi avoid Herod, returning home via a different route. Herod realises that the Magi have tricked him and orders the death of every boy in Bethlehem under the age of two. Joseph is warned in a dream of the danger and [[Flight into Egypt|flees to Egypt]] with Mary and Jesus as the film ends.

==Reception==

===Box office===
''The Nativity Story'' opened to a modest first weekend at the domestic [[box office]] by grossing $7.8 million,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/weekend/chart/?yr=2006&amp;wknd=48&amp;p=.htm|title=Weekend Box Office Results for December 1-3, 2006|work=[[IMDB]]|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a 39% increase over the extended Christmas weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nativity Story (2006) – Weekend Box Office Results|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=weekend&amp;id=nativity.htm|work=[[IMDB]]|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After its initial run, the film closed out with about $37.6 million in domestic gross and $8.8 million in foreign gross, resulting in a worldwide total of almost $46.4 million on a reported $35 million budget.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nativity Story (2006)|url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?page=main&amp;id=nativity.htm|work=[[IMDB]]|publisher=[[Box Office Mojo]]|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critical response===
The movie received mixed reviews. Review aggregator [[Rotten Tomatoes]] reports that 38% of 130 film critics have given the film a positive review, with a rating average of 5.3/10. The site's consensus says, "''The Nativity Story'' is a dull retelling of a well-worn tale with the look and feel of a high-school production."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nativity Story – Rotten Tomatoes|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/nativity_story/|work=[[Flixster]]|publisher=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Metacritic]], which assigns a weighted average score out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, gives the film a score of 52 based on 28 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Nativity Story|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/the-nativity-story|work=[[CBS Interactive]]|publisher=[[Metacritic]]|accessdate=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[A. O. Scott]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' gave the film a positive review saying, "At its best, ''The Nativity Story'' shares with ''[[Hail Mary (film)|Hail Mary]]'' an interest in finding a kernel of realism in the old story of a pregnant teenager in hard times. Buried in the pageantry, in other words, is an interesting movie."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Scott|first=A. O.|title=The Virgin Mary as a Teenager With Worries|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/2006/12/01/movies/01nati.html?_r=0|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ann Hornaday of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' concluded a positive review of the film stating, "The most intriguing thing about ''The Nativity Story'' transpires during the couple's extraordinary personal journey, advancing a radical idea in an otherwise long slog of a cinematic Sunday school lesson: that Jesus became Who He was not only because He was the Son of God, but because He was the son of a good man."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hornaday|first=Ann|title=Chapter and Verse|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/11/30/AR2006113001587.html|newspaper=[[The Washington Post]]|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=1 December 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Conversely, many critics felt that the film did not take the story to new cinematic heights. [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' noted, "''The Nativity Story'' is a film of tame picture-book sincerity, but that's not the same thing as devotion. The movie is too tepid to feel, or see, the light."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|title=The Nativity Story (2006)|url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,1564208,00.html|newspaper=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=29 November 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]] of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' said, "This is not a chance to 'experience the most timeless of stories as you've never seen it before' but just the opposite: an opportunity, for those who want it, to encounter this story exactly the way it's almost always been told."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Turan|first=Kenneth|title='The Nativity Story': A "Story" told with too much naiveté|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/movies/cl-et-nativity1dec01,1,4548828.story|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=1 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Incidents==
Keisha Castle-Hughes became pregnant during filming and received a lot of media attention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Introducing Felicity-Amore Hull — Keisha speaks about her labor, delivery, and new little girl|url=http://celebritybabies.people.com/2007/06/08/introducing_fel/ |publisher=[[People (magazine)|People]]|accessdate=14 December 2012|date=8 June 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==
[[Mychael Danna]]'s score of the film was released as an album on December 5, 2006. The album was nominated for a [[Dove Award]] for Instrumental Album of the Year at the [[39th GMA Dove Awards]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbn.com/cbnmusic/news/021508doves.aspx Nominations Announced for 39th GMA Dove Awards] on CBN.com (February 14, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4530">'''Unrealised Projects''' is an artist run web-based project established in London by [[Sam Ely and Lynn Harris]] in 2003. Unrealised Projects investigates the potential of unrecognised, unfinished or unfulfilled ideas. The project is ongoing.

[[Lisa Le Feuvre]] writing on Art Failure states:

:“Other, more recent, catalogues of unrealised projects are [[Hans Ulrich Obrist]]’s Unbuilt Roads or the online archive Unrealised Projects devised by artist [[Sam Ely and Lynn Harris]]. These collections show proposals that have been deemed failures before they have been realised, yet nonetheless they are released into the space of critical engagement.” &lt;ref&gt;Le Feuvre, Lisa, February 2008, [[Art Monthly]] 313, ‘Art Failure’, {{ISSN|0142-6702}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sam Ely and Lynn Harris are research-led artists who have worked together since September 2002. In this time, they have worked on several contextually specific projects with such artists/curators as [[Per Hüttner]], [[Lisa Le Feuvre]], [[Apolonija Šušteršič]], Simon Morris, [[Dallas Seitz]] and [[Denise Hawyrsio]]. They are interested in understanding how critical cultural production has the potential to create better living conditions through analysing and responding to existing systems/situations.&lt;ref&gt;Jablonskiene, Lolita, October 2008, Printed Project, Issue 10, 'The Art of Living with Strangers', p132, ISSN 1649-4075.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unrealised Projects have participated in [[Publish And Be Damned]], an annual independent publishing fair in both 2009 and 2006, in June 2009 Volume 4 publication (a partial introduction to a process in progress) was launched at the [[Liverpool Artists Book Fair]] at [[A Foundation]].

The '''Villa Romana del Tellaro''' is a [[Roman villa]] dating from the late [[Roman Empire]] on [[Sicily]] in southern Italy.&lt;ref&gt;www.villaromanadeltellaro.com&lt;/ref&gt; It is located south of [[Noto]] in the [[province of Syracuse]].

==History and description==
The remains of the villa were found in 1971 in a fertile agricultural area, on a low elevation near the [[Tellaro (river)|Tellaro]] river. The site was located on a farm dating from the 17th to the 19th century.

The central building was constructed around a large [[peristyle]]. The section of the porch on the north side had a floor which was decorated with [[mosaic]]s. They show [[laurel wreath]]es forming circles and octagons with geometric and floral motifs. They border two other rooms that retain figurative mosaics.

In the first of these rooms a very damaged mosaic contains a panel with scenes of the ransom of the body of [[Hector]]. In this scene [[Odysseus]], [[Achilles]] and [[Diomedes]], identified by inscriptions in [[Ancient Greek]], are weighing the body of the hero. The figure of [[Priam]] is lost, but the legs of Hector's body can be seen partially on the right side of the scales. The gold of the ransom is visible on the left side. This event was not mentioned in the [[Iliad]] by [[Homer]] and is probably derived from a tragedy of [[Aeschylus]]. The mosaic floor in the second room shows a hunting scene with a banquet in the open air among the trees. The female figure in the scene is the personification of [[Africa]].

The scenes on the mosaic found in the second room are reminiscent of the mosaics in the [[Villa Romana del Casale]] near [[Piazza Armerina]]. However, this mosaic has more stylized figures and two-dimensional, uncertain proportions, making the effect very different. The mosaics were probably the work of craftsmen from [[North Africa]]. Based on [[numismatics|numismatic]] evidence, they were made in the second half of the fourth century CE.

==The villa today==
The villa has seen renewed interest in recent years, mainly due to a series  of reconstruction projects and redevelopment of the site. On 15 March 15, 2008, over thirty years after the [[Excavation (archaeology)|excavations]], it was finally inaugurated and made accessible to the public.

Behind the villa lie vineyards, where the traditional grapes of the region are still grown. These include [[Nero d'Avola]], [[Muscat (grape)|Muscat]] and [[Albanello Bianco]] which are increasingly difficult to find today.

'''Šovinistička farsa''' ({{lang-sr|Шовинистичка фарса}}), ''Chauvinistic Farce'' in [[English language|English]] is a theatre play, written by [[Radoslav Pavlović]] that performed across former [[Yugoslavia]] prior to and during its dissolution. A total of 4 sequels of the play were produced from 1985 to 1998, and according to one of the main actors, [[Predrag Ejdus]], the play was performed more than 1800 times,&lt;ref name=ejdus/&gt; and was performed in almost every city in former [[Yugoslavia]] that had a decent theatre.&lt;ref name=nadlanu/&gt; Thanks to its great popularity with the audience, the play launched the carriers of then young and later famous, main actors [[Josif Tatić]] and [[Predrag Ejdus]].

The play is mostly set as a dialog between a stereotypical [[Serbs|Serb]], Slobodan Mihajlovic (played by [[Josif Tatić|Tatić]]) and a stereotypical [[Croats|Croat]], Bernard Drah (played by [[Predrag Ejdus|Ejdus]]), both of whom drink heavily. The script derives its capacity to make the audience laugh from the everlasting differences between Serbs and Croats, and the destiny of two people historically, culturally and geographically bound to one another. At first the play may have been seen as controversial due to its departure from then omnipresent dogma of [[Brotherhood and unity]] of the two people. The later events of dissolution of [[Yugoslavia]] have shown the script to be the predictor of an inevitable divorce.

[[Radoslav Pavlović]] received an award for Best script at 11th Satire days ({{lang-hr|Dani satire}}) in [[Zagreb]], 1986.&lt;ref name=kerempuh/&gt;

==Trivia==
[[Petar Božović]] and [[Lazar Ristovski]] were initially cast to play the main roles but abandoned the project during rehearsals. The director then replaced them by [[Josif Tatić|Tatić]] and [[Predrag Ejdus|Ejdus]].
In addition to the main production of the play that toured across the country, independent plays based on the script of ''Šovinistička farsa'' were also produced in [[Zagreb]],  (with Željko Vukmirica and Mladen Crnobrnja playing the main two roles), [[Kruševac]], [[Sombor]], [[Banja Luka]], [[Rijeka]] and [[Varaždin]]. The version of the play produced in [[Zagreb]] was performed for more than 300 times.
