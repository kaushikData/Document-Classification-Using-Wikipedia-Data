      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="16861">'''Appraisal''', in the context of [[archival science]] and archive administration, is a process usually conducted by a member of the [[archive|record-holding institution]] (often a professional [[archivist]]) in which a body of records is examined to determine its value for that institution. When it occurs prior to acquisition, the appraisal process involves assessing records for inclusion in the archives. In connection with an institution's collecting policy, appraisal "represents a doorway into the archives through which all records must pass."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/70054151|title=Understanding archives &amp; manuscripts|last=O'Toole, James M. &amp; Cox, Richard J.|first=|publisher=Society of American Archivists|others=|year=2006|isbn=9781931666206|location=Chicago|pages=120|oclc=70054151}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some considerations when conducting appraisal include how to meet the record-granting body’s organizational needs, how to uphold requirements of organizational accountability (be they legal, institutional, or determined by archival ethics), and how to meet the expectations of the record-using community.

Appraisal is considered a core archival function, along with acquisition, arrangement and description, [[preservation (library and archival science)|preservation]] and [[reference|access]]. The official definition from the [[Society of American Archivists]] is as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In an archival context, appraisal is the process of determining whether records and other materials have permanent (archival) value. Appraisal may be done at the collection, creator, series, file, or item level. Appraisal can take place prior to donation and prior to physical transfer, at or after accessioning. The basis of appraisal decisions may include a number of factors, including the records' provenance and content, their authenticity and reliability, their order and completeness, their condition and costs to preserve them, and their intrinsic value. Appraisal often takes place within a larger institutional collecting policy and mission statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pearce-Moses|first=Richard|title=A Glossary of Archival &amp; Records Terminology|year=2005|publisher=Society of American Archivists|location=Chicago, IL|pages=22|url=http://www2.archivists.org/glossary/terms/a/appraisal}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;Appraisal can be viewed as a balancing act between the demands of administrative and heritage objectives; between the context of creation and the use of records.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Depending on the degree of her or his autonomy to make appraisal decisions, an archivist's role is more or less central to the ''memory'' of an institution or society. Jacques Grimard sees archivists as participating in the "management of the world's memory" in three ways, by developing, preserving and communicating memory.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In Luciana Duranti's view, appraisal is an analogue for the archival profession as a whole. It is the duty of the profession to "act as a mediator between those who produce archives and those who use them, as a facilitator of public memory making and keeping." She is cautious in her use of the term ''value'' in the context of archives, if establishing value means compromising the relationships between documents and the "impartial societal evidence" they might convey to future generations. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Duranti|first=Luciana|date=Spring 1994|title=The concept of appraisal and archival theory|url=|journal=American Archivist|volume=57|pages=341-344|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History of appraisal theory==

===Muller, Feith &amp; Fruin: the Dutch Manual, 1898===
Mostly concerned with the records of government bodies, the ''Manual for the Arrangement and Description of Archives: Drawn up by the Netherlands Association of Archivists'' (1898), commonly referred to as the "Dutch Manual," assumed, generally, that the archives would keep each record it acquired.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muller|first1=Samuel|last2=Fruin|first2=R.|last3=Feith|first3=Johan Adriaan|title=Manual for the arrangement and description of archives : drawn up by direction of the Netherlands Association of Archivists|date=1940|publisher=The H. W. Wilson company|location=New York|pages=225|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015005389211;view=1up;seq=9|accessdate=16 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors articulated concepts of provenance and original order that privileged an "organic bond" in a collection that precedes its transfer to an archival repository. Appraisal decisions that involve selecting individual records or groups of records for exclusion would consequently lie outside the responsibilities of the archivist, in their view.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/961923754|title=Currents of archival thinking|last=Eastwood|first=Terry|publisher=Libraries Unlimited|others=|year=2017|isbn=9781440839092|edition=2nd|location=Santa Barbara, California|pages=7-8|oclc=961923754}}&lt;/ref&gt;
===Sir Hilary Jenkinson, 1922===
[[Hilary Jenkinson|Sir Hilary Jenkinson]] was a British archivist and Deputy Keeper of the [[Public Record Office]] upon his retirement. His great contribution to appraisal theory is his ''Manual of Archive Administration'' (1922; revised 1937; reissued 1965) in which he argued that archives are "documents which formed part of an official transaction and were preserved for official reference". For Jenkinson, the records creator is responsible for determining which records should be transferred to the archives for preservation. Since in his view records are "impartial", the task of selection is merely a matter of choosing documents that best describe "what happened".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkinson |first=Hilary |title=A Manual of Archive Administration|origyear=1922 |year=1937 |publisher=Percy Lund, Humphries and Co.|location=London |pages=4, 12, 145–7, 149–52 |url=https://archive.org/stream/manualofarchivea00iljenk#page/4/mode/2up }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jenkinson staked out a limited role for the archivist, positioned between the administrative body transferring the records and the researcher who might seek to access them. The archivist, according to Jenkinson, is to act as a steward of the records in his or her custody. Neither the archivist nor the historian is competent to make appraisal decisions. That process should be left to the donor. Jenkinson deals directly with destruction of records, which he sees as solely the purview of the creator of those records. As long as destruction is done in accordance with the needs of its "practical business" and the agency of origin refrains "from thinking of itself as a body producing historical evidence", its actions should not, in Jenkinson's view, be considered illegitimate, even by succeeding generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Kolsrud |first=Ole |date=Winter 1992 |title=The evolution of basic appraisal principles – some comparative observations |journal=American Archivist |volume=55 |pages=27–28 |jstor=40293622 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===T. R. Schellenberg, 1956===
[[T. R. Schellenberg]]'s work in ''Modern Archives'' (1956) represents a departure from Jenkinson’s approach, necessitated by the advent of mass duplication and an overwhelming influx of documents into archives. In his work, he divides the value of records into primary values (the original value for the creator; for their administrative, fiscal, and operating uses) and secondary values (their lasting value after they are no longer in current use; for those other than the original creator). He defines evidential value as deriving from the "evidence records contain of the organization and functioning of the Government body that produced them", and informational value as related to the "information records contain on persons, corporate bodies, things, problems, conditions, and the like, with which the Government body dealt". After defining the terms, Schellenberg details the manner in which an archivist could perform appraisal based on these criteria, placing a stress in every case on the importance of research and analysis on the part of the archivist.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Schellenberg|first=Theodore R.|title=Modern Archives: Principles and Techniques|year=1956|publisher=University of Chicago Press|location=Chicago, IL}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Schellenberg, informational value is based on three criteria:

*''Uniqueness'': The information in the record cannot be found anywhere else and must also be unique in form (i.e., not duplicated elsewhere).
*''Form'': An archivist must, according to Schellenberg, consider the form of the information (the degree to which the information is concentrated) as well as the form of the records itself (whether or not they can easily be read by others, e.g., punchcards and tape recordings would involve the use of expensive machinery to decipher).
*''Importance'': When appraising records, one must judge records first based on the needs of the government itself, then on the needs of historians/social scientists, as well as local historians and genealogists; he encourages archivists to be wary of records with sentimental value.

==Some current approaches to appraisal==

===Macro-appraisal===
According to [[Terry Cook (archivist)|Terry Cook]], North American appraisal theory is unplanned, taxonomic, random and fragmented, and has rarely embodied the concepts of institutional and societal dynamics which would lead archivists to a working model that would allow them to appraise the broad spectrum of human experience. His model is a top-down approach, which focuses on key processes through which a particular function is expressed by intersecting with structures and individuals. 

Macro-appraisal is distinguished from ''micro''-appraisal in that the former seeks to ''appraise'' the institution by understanding the context of creation and the interrelationships between, for instance, the different ministries or agencies within a government. In Cook's view, this institutional understanding should precede and inform the latter, micro-appraisal; the appraisal of documents. His approach to macro-appraisal doesn't just derive from the position of the creating body within an established hierarchy. It is not ''top-down'' in a conventional, bureaucratic sense. It is top-down in that it moves from macro to micro-appraisal.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Couture|first=Carol|date=Spring 2005|title=Archival appraisal: A status report|url=|journal=Archivaria|volume=59|pages=102-103|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This requires a planned, logical approach—archivists embarking upon appraisals are equipped with an understanding of the record creator, its mandate and functions, its structure and decision-making processes, the way it creates records, and changes to these processes over time.

{{Quote|text=Macroappraisal assesses the societal value of both the functional-structural context and the work-place culture in which the records are created and used by the creator(s), ''and'' the interrelationship of citizens, groups, organizations – the "public" – with that functional-structural context. If appraisal designates the long-term value of the context of records, or series of records, for their potential research values, macroappraisal assesses the significance of the context of their creation and contemporary use. |source=Terry Cook, "Macroappraisal in Theory and Practice: Origins, Characteristics, and Implementation in Canada, 1950–2000&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cook|first1=Terry|title=Macroappraisal in Theory and Practice: Origins, Characteristics, and Implementation in Canada, 1950–2000|journal=Archival Science|date=December 2005|volume=5|issue=2|pages=101–161|doi=10.1007/s10502-005-9010-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The benefits of this process are theoretical (identifying the important functions in society which should be documented) and practical (the ability to focus appraisal activities on records of the highest potential archival value).

===Documentation strategy===
Connected with the writings of [[Helen Willa Samuels]], documentation strategy aims to reach beyond institutional frameworks when appraising collections. In the past, she says, archivists have been passive, concentrating on researchers’ needs rather than understanding a document in context. This has led to a circular problem, as researchers state their needs based on the context that they deduce from the archives, and as the archives create an artificial context based on researchers’ stated needs. "Archivists are challenged to select a lasting record", Samuels says, "but they lack techniques to support this decision making" (1992).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Samuels|first=Helen|title=Who Controls the Past|journal=The American Archivist|url=http://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=mdp.39015072453130;view=1up;seq=119|year=1986|volume=49|series=Spring|issue=2|pages=109–124|jstor=40292980}}&lt;/ref&gt; Samuels argues that while archivists once needed to know and understand the complex bureaucratic structures of organizations, they must now understand the structures between organizations and ignore institutional boundaries.

However, this is increasingly impossible; archivists need to examine documentation in a comprehensive manner. A documentation strategy is, then, "a plan formulated to assure the documentation of an ongoing issue, activity or geographic area" (ibid). Its development includes records creators, archivists, and users, and it is carried out through a system-wide understanding of the intended [[Records life-cycle|life-cycle of the record]].

'''Balamku''' is a small [[Maya civilization|Maya]] archaeological site located in the Mexican state of [[Campeche]]].&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p437"&gt;Rodríguez Campero 2008, p. 437.&lt;/ref&gt; It features elaborate plaster facades dating to the Early Classic period.&lt;ref&gt;Sharer and Traxler 2006, p. 214.&lt;/ref&gt;  It has one of the largest surviving stucco friezes in the Maya world.  Balamku was first occupied from around 300 BC.  Its most important buildings date from AD 300–600.  
==Location==
Balamku is located {{convert|50|km|mi}} north of the ruins of the great [[Maya city]] of [[Calakmul]], approximately the same distance west of [[Becan]], {{convert|60|km|mi}} west of [[Xpujil]] and {{convert|12|km|mi}} southeast of the ruins of [[Nadzca'an]].&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Campero 2008, p. 438. Arnauld et al 1998, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; The ruins lie  upon a poorly drained [[karst]]ic plateau.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p438"&gt;Rodríguez Campero 2008, p. 438.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The  architectural style of Balamku has more in common with the Petén tradition to the south, although Río Bec influences are also evident.&lt;ref&gt;Arnauld 1998, pp. 144-145.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Balamku1.jpg|thumb|right|Section of stucco frieze in Structure I]]
Balamku was occupied from about 300 BC, in the Late Preclassic, through to the Terminal Classic period, between 800 and 1000 AD.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p438"/&gt; The earliest architecture in the site is found in the Central and South Groups, dating to the Late Preclassic to Early Classic transition.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p445"&gt;Rodríguez Campero 2008, p. 445.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ruins were discovered in 1990 by Mexican archaeologist Florentino García Cruz in the company of [[INAH]] custodians, when they investigated a report of archaeological looting; they found a looters' trench that had partly uncovered a painted stucco frieze that had originally formed part of the upper facade of an Early Classic building. After initial rescue work, the site was formally excavated in 1994 to 1995 by a team headed by Mexican archaeologist Ramón Carrasco and including two French archaeologists, Claude Baudez and Jean Pierre Courau.&lt;ref name="Arnauld98p144"&gt;Arnauld et al 1998, p. 144.&lt;/ref&gt; Carrasco and his Mexican team concentrated on the Central Group while the French archaeologists investigated the South Group.&lt;ref name="BenavidesC05p16"&gt;Benavides C. 2005, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Site description==
The ruins of Balamku cover an area of approximately {{convert|25|ha|acre}}.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p438"/&gt; The site features a very low density of peripheral architecture around the principal groups; by {{convert|100|m|ft}} away there are practically no further buildings.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Campero 2008, p. 444.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Architectural Groups===
The ruins are distributed in four major architectural groups.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Campero 2008, pp. 438–440.&lt;/ref&gt; The Central and North Groups are situated close to water sources.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p443"&gt;Rodríguez Campero 2008, p. 443.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Central Group====
The Central Group comprises three plazas, labelled as Plaza A, B and C.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p438"/&gt;

'''Plaza A''' is situated at the southern extreme of the Central Group. It supports a [[Mesoamerican ballcourt]] and a number of mounds that have not yet been investigated archaeologically.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p438"/&gt;

'''Plaza B''' is located in the northwestern sector of the Central Group. It is enclosed by Structure I on the north side, Structure IV on the south side, and structures V and VI on the east and west sides respectively.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p438"/&gt; Test pits have uncovered architectural remains dating back to the Late Preclassic, the earliest phase of operation at the site.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p445"/&gt;

'''Plaza C''' is separated from Plaza B by Structure V. It is bordered by Structure II on its north side and Structure III on its west side. It is enclosed on its south side by a number of unexcavated structures.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p438"/&gt;

====South Group====
[[File:Balamku GS1.JPG|thumb|left|Structures in the South Group]]
The South Group comprises four plazas, labelled A through to D.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p438440"/&gt;

'''Plaza A''' is enclosed by Structure D5-5 on its north side. Structure D5-10 limits its western side and Structure D5-11 encloses it on the south side.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p438"/&gt;

'''Plaza B''' has Structure D5-5 on its eastern side. Structure D5-10 is on the south side of the plaza and Structure D5-7 encloses the northern side of the plaza.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p438"/&gt;

'''Plaza C''' is bordered by Structure D5-4 and Structure D5-6 on its east and south sides respectively.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p440"&gt;Rodríguez Campero 2008, p. 440.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Plaza D''' is enclosed by Structure D5-1 on its eastern side. Structure D5-2 limits the south side of the plaza and Structure D5-3 closes the plaza on the west side.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p440"/&gt;

====Southwest Group====
{{Maya civilization}}
The Southwest Group consists of two structures that together form an [[E-Group]] astronomical complex.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p440"/&gt;

====North Group====
The North Group has not been excavated by archaeologists although it has been mapped. It consists of six plazas bordered by structures, some of which over {{convert|15|m|ft}} tall.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p440"/&gt;

===Structures===
'''Structure I''' is located in the Central Group. Excavations of an earlier substructure (Sub I-A) have uncovered a stucco frieze stylistically dated to between the 4th century BC and the middle of the 6th century AD,&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p443"/&gt; although [[radiocarbon dating]] of the lintel of the structure returned a date of 631&amp;nbsp;AD&amp;nbsp;±&amp;nbsp;30 years. The frieze was first uncovered by looters and was fully excavated under the direction of INAH. The complete frieze measured {{convert|16.8|m|ft}} long when excavated and stood {{convert|1.75|m|ft}} high.&lt;ref name="Arnauld98p144"/&gt; The frieze combines imagery of rulers with that of a sacred mountain.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez Campero 2008, pp. 443-444.&lt;/ref&gt; The frieze preserved almost intact;&lt;ref name="BenavidesC05p16"/&gt; it is protected by roofing and is accessible to visitors.&lt;ref&gt;Carrasco Vargas and Colón González 2006, p. 393.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Structure D5-5''' is located in the South Group between plazas B and C.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p438440"&gt;Rodríguez Campero 2008, pp. 438, 440.&lt;/ref&gt; Two burials were excavated in the structure, one of them was an elite status individual.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p443"/&gt;

'''Structure D5-10''', in the South Group, is built over two earlier structures dating to the Late Preclassic.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p445"/&gt;

'''Structure D5-11''' is located in the South Group, on the south side of Plaza A. It dates as far back as the Late Preclassic and is one of the earliest known buildings at Balamku.&lt;ref name="RodriguezCampero08p445"/&gt;

The '''size of a [[book]]''' is generally measured by the height against the width of a leaf, or sometimes the height and width of its cover.&lt;ref name="Roberts 1982 Book sizes"/&gt; A series of terms is commonly used by [[libraries]] and [[publishers]] for the general sizes of modern books, ranging from ''[[folio]]'' (the largest), to ''[[quarto]]'' (smaller) and ''[[octavo]]'' (still smaller). Historically, these terms referred to the format of the book, a technical term used by printers and [[Bibliography|bibliographers]] to indicate the size of a leaf in terms of the size of the original sheet. For example, a quarto (from Latin ''quartō'', ablative form of ''quartus'', fourth&lt;ref name="OED 1989"&gt;{{Cite book| title=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]| edition=2nd| year=1989| publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;) historically was a book printed on a sheet of paper folded twice to produce four leaves (or eight pages), each leaf one fourth the size of the original sheet printed. Because the actual format of many modern books cannot be determined from examination of the books, bibliographers may not use these terms in scholarly descriptions.

==Book formats==
In the [[Printing press|hand press]] period (up to about 1820) books were manufactured by printing text on both sides of a full sheet of paper and then folding the paper one or more times into a group of leaves or ''[[Gathering (bookbinding)|gathering]]''. The binder would sew the gatherings (sometimes also called ''signatures'') through their inner hinges and attached to cords in the spine to form the book block. Before the covers were bound to the book, the block of text pages was sometimes trimmed along the three unbound edges to open the folds of the paper and to produce smooth edges for the book. When the leaves were not trimmed, the reader would have to cut open the leaf edges using a knife.
[[File:Traditional book sizes.svg|thumb|Traditional book sizes/formats used in English-speaking countries. Based on the 19"×24" printing paper size. [[Letter (paper size)|US Letter]] is added for comparison.]]
Books made by printing two pages of text on each side of a sheet of paper, which is then folded once to form two leaves or four pages, are referred to as ''[[folio]]s'' (from Latin, ''foliō'', ablative of ''folium'', leaf&lt;ref name="OED 1989"/&gt;). Those made by printing four text pages on each side of a sheet of paper and folding the paper twice to form a gathering containing four leaves or eight pages are called ''[[quarto]]s'' (fourths). Similarly, books made by printing eight pages of text on each side of a sheet, which was then folded three times to form gatherings of eight leaves or sixteen pages each, are called ''[[octavo]]s''. The size of the resulting pages in these cases depends, of course, on the size of the full sheet used to print them and how much the leaves were trimmed before binding, but where the same size paper is used, folios are the largest, followed by quartos and then octavos.&lt;ref name="Gaskell 1972"/&gt;{{rp|80–81}} The proportion of leaves of quartos tends to be squarer than that of folios or octavos.&lt;ref name="McKerrow 1927"/&gt;{{rp|164}}

These various production methods are referred to as the format of the book. These terms are often abbreviated, using 4to for quarto, 8vo for octavo, and so on. The octavo format, with eight leaves per gathering, has half the page size of the quarto format before trimming. Smaller formats include the ''duodecimo'' (or ''twelvemo''), with twelve leaves per sheet and pages one-third the size of the quarto format, and the ''sextodecimo'' (or ''sixteenmo''), with sixteen leaves per sheet, half the size of the octavo format and one quarter the size of the quarto. The vast majority of books were printed in the folio, quarto, octavo or duodecimo formats.&lt;ref name="Gaskell 1972"/&gt;{{rp|82}}

There are many variations in how such books were produced. For example, folios were rarely made by simply binding up a group of two leaf gatherings; instead several printed leaf pairs would be inserted within another, to produce a larger gathering of multiple leaves that would be more convenient for binding.&lt;ref name="McKerrow 1927"/&gt;{{rp|30–31}} For example, three two-leaf printed sheets might be inserted in a fourth, producing gatherings of eight leaves or sixteen pages each. Bibliographers still refer to such books as folios (and not octavos) because the original full sheets were folded once to produce two leaves, and describe such gatherings as ''folios in 8s''. Similarly, a book printed as an octavo, but bound with gatherings of four leaves each, is called an ''octavo in 4s''.&lt;ref name="McKerrow 1927"/&gt;{{rp|28}}

In determining the format of a book, bibliographers will study the number of leaves in a gathering, their proportion and sizes and also the arrangement of the [[Laid paper|chain lines]] and [[watermarks]] in the paper.&lt;ref name="Gaskell 1972"/&gt;{{rp|84–107}}

In order for the pages to come out in the correct order, the printers would have to properly lay out the pages of [[Typeface|type]] in the printing press. For example, to print two leaves in folio containing pages 1 through 4, the printer would print pages 1 and 4 on one side of the sheet and, after that has dried, print pages 2 and 3 on the other side. If a printer was printing a folio in 8s, as described above, he would have to print pages 1 and 16 on one side of a leaf with pages 2 and 15 on the other side of that leaf, etc. The arrangement of the pages of type in the press is referred to as the ''imposition'' and there are a number of methods of imposing pages for the various formats, some of which involve cutting the printed pages before binding.&lt;ref name="Gaskell 1972"/&gt;{{rp|80–110}}
:''See [[#Further reading|Further reading]] for more on imposition schemes.''

==Modern book production==
As printing and paper technology developed, it became possible to produce and to print on much larger sheets or rolls of paper and it may not be apparent (or even possible to determine) from examination of a modern book how the paper was folded to produce them. For example, a modern novel may consist of gatherings of sixteen leaves, but may actually have been printed with sixty-four pages on each side of a very large sheet of paper.&lt;ref name="Bowers 1949"/&gt;{{rp|429}} Similarly, the actual printing format cannot be determined for books that are [[perfect bound]], where every leaf in the book is completely cut out (i.e., not conjugate to another leaf as in gatherings) and is glued into the [[Book design#Front cover, spine, and back cover of the dust-jacket|spine]]. Modern books are commonly called ''folio'', ''quarto'' and ''octavo'' based simply on their size rather than the format in which they were actually produced, if that can even be determined. Scholarly bibliographers may describe such books based on the number of leaves in each gathering (eight leaves per gathering forming an octavo), even where the actual number of pages printed on the original sheet is unknown&lt;ref name="Gaskell 1972"/&gt;{{rp|80–81}} or may reject the use of these terms for modern books entirely.{{refn|group="note"|''Cf.'' Bowers,&lt;ref name="Bowers 1949"/&gt;{{rp|429–430}} suggesting that a book with eight leaves per gathering where the format cannot be determined should be referred to as ''{{nowrap|in 8s}}'' and not ''octavo''.}}

Today, octavo and quarto are the most common book sizes, but many books are produced in larger and smaller sizes as well. Other terms for book size have developed, an ''elephant folio'' being up to {{nowrap|23 inches}} tall, an ''atlas folio'' {{nowrap|25 inches}}, and a ''double elephant folio'' {{nowrap|50 inches}} tall.

== Records ==
===Largest book===
According to the 2003 [[Guinness World Records]], the largest book in the world was ''[[Bhutan: A Visual Odyssey Across the Last Himalayan Kingdom]]'' by [[Michael Hawley]]. Its size is {{convert|1.5|x|2.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/12/16/largest.book.ap/ |title=Guinness: Scientist creates world's largest book |accessdate=2007-06-07 |author=Associated Press |authorlink=Associated Press |date=2003-12-16 |publisher=[[CNN]] |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070522003607/http://www.cnn.com/2003/TECH/ptech/12/16/largest.book.ap/ |archivedate=2007-05-22 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the 2007 Guinness World Records, the largest published book in the world was ''[[The Little Prince]]'' printed in Brazil in 2007. Its size is {{convert|2|x|3.1|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest book published|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-book-published/|website=Guinness World Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the 2012 Guinness World Records, the largest book in the world was ''This the Prophet Mohamed'' made in [[Dubai]], UAE. Its size is {{convert|5|x|8|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Largest book|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/largest-book/|website=Guinness World Records}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though larger than ''The Little Prince'', the two hold separate records, as ''This the Prophet Mohamed'' was constructed by hand, not published. 

===Smallest book===
The smallest book is ''[[Teeny Ted from Turnip Town]]'' measured {{convert|0.07|x|0.10|mm|in|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Smallest reproduction of a printed book|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/smallest-reproduction-of-a-printed-book/|website=Guinness World Records}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Largest manuscript===
The largest surviving medieval manuscript is the ''[[Codex Gigas]]'' or 'Devil's Manuscript', measured at 92 cm tall by 50 cm wide (36 inches tall by 20 inches wide).

==Paper sizes==
{{main|Paper size}}

During the hand press period, full sheets of paper were manufactured in a great variety of sizes which were given a number of names, such as ''pot'', ''demy'', ''foolscap'', ''crown'', etc.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Ringwalt|editor1-first=John Luther|title=American Encyclopaedia of Printing|date=1871|publisher=Menamin&amp;Ringwald|location=Philadelphia|pages=139–140|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ztQoAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA139|chapter=Dimensions of Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Savage1841&gt;{{cite book|last1=Savage|first1=William|title=A Dictionary of the Art of Printing|date=1841|publisher=Burt Franklin|location=New York|pages=560–566|chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S_s1AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA560|chapter=Paper}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were not standardized and the actual sizes varied depending on the country of manufacture and date.&lt;ref name="Gaskell 1972"/&gt;{{rp|67–70, 73–75}}

The size and proportions of a book will thus depend on the size of the original sheet of paper used in producing the book. For example, if a sheet {{nowrap|19 inches}} by {{nowrap|25 inches}} is used to print a quarto, the resulting book will be approximately {{nowrap|12.5 inches}} tall and {{nowrap|9.5 inches}} wide, before trimming. Because the size of paper used has differed over the years and localities, the sizes of books of the same format will also differ. A typical octavo printed in Italy or France in the {{nowrap|16th Century}} thus is roughly the size of a modern [[Paperback#Mass-market|mass market paperback]] book, but an English {{nowrap|18th-century}} octavo is noticeably larger, more like a modern [[Paperback#Trade|trade paperback]] or hardcover novel.

===United Kingdom===
A common paperback size in the UK is [[Paperback#B-format|B-format]]. For example, [[Penguin Classics]] are in B-format, which is 129mm x 198mm. This contrasts with A-format (110 mm × 178 mm) and C-format (135mm x 216mm).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/books/2001/aug/11/gettingpublished&lt;/ref&gt;

===Japan===
In book construction, Japan uses a mixture of [[ISO_216#A_series|ISO A-series]], [[Paper_size#Japanese_B-series_variant|JIS B-series]], and several traditional Japanese paper sizes. A- and B-series signatures are folded from a sheet slightly larger than ISO A1 and JIS B1, respectively, then trimmed to size. The most commonly encountered sizes are listed below.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3210">A '''Credit Support Annex''', or '''CSA''', is a [[legal document]] which regulates credit support ([[Collateral (finance)|collateral]]) for [[Derivative_(finance)#Types|derivative transactions]]. It is one of the four parts that make up an [[ISDA Master Agreement]] but is not mandatory. It is possible to have an ISDA agreement without a CSA but normally not a CSA without an ISDA.

Essentially, a '''CSA''' defines the terms or rules under which collateral is posted or transferred between swap counterparties to mitigate the [[credit risk]] arising from "[[in the money]]" derivative positions. 

If on any Valuation Date, the Delivery Amount equals or exceeds the Pledgor's Minimum Transfer Amount, the Pledgor must transfer Eligible Collateral with a Value at least equal to the Delivery Amount. The Delivery Amount is the amount the Credit Support Amount exceeds the Value of all posted Collateral held by the Secured Party. The Credit Support Amount is the Secured Party's Exposure plus Pledgor's Independent Amounts minus Secured Party's Independent Amounts minus the Pledgor's Threshold. The Collateral must meet the Eligibility criteria in the agreement, e.g., which currencies it may be in, what types of bonds are allowed, and which  [[Haircut (finance)|haircuts]] are applied.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.isda.org/press/pdf/cexpdrft.doc&lt;/ref&gt; There are also rules for the settlement of disputes arising over valuation of derivative positions.

To distinguish between the [[ISDA_Master_Agreement|Schedule to the Master Agreement]] and the Credit Support Annex, the schedules are numbered as Parts and CSA are numbered as Paragraphs. To customise the requirements of an OTC Transaction, the clauses which are required are added as Paragraph 11 (for London Agreements) and as Paragraph 13 (for New York Agreements).

Under English Law, CSA are considered transactions: Any collateral listed as ‘Eligible Collateral’ is delivered as an outright transfer of title. The collateral taker becomes the outright owner of that collateral free of any third party interest.

Compare the "Outright transfer" offered under English Law Credit Support Annex with "Security Interest" under New York Law Credit Support Annex. Both New York Law Credit Support Annex and an English law Credit Support Annex operate to create security interests in the collateral being posted, the differences are operational and can be material upon an insolvency of the other party.

*English law credit support annex operates by way of outright transfers of title to the posted collateral
*Parties might select New York or English CSA for many operational considerations, also the choice of credit support documentation can materially change the parties’ rights and obligations and their standing upon an insolvency of the other party

'''''Daisy-Head Mayzie''''' is a [[children's book]] written by [[Dr. Seuss]] and illustrated in his style. It was published in 1995, as Seuss's last book before his death. It was republished on July 5, 2016 with Seuss's original drawings.

==Plot==
The book is about a 12-year-old warmhearted schoolgirl named Mayzie who one day suddenly sprouts a bright white daisy from her head. It causes alarm in her classroom, family, and town, until an agent makes her a celebrity. [[The Cat in the Hat]] who serves as the narrator to this story helps Mayzie to understand her problem and persuade her to go back home. The book has a mini-song titled "Daisy-Head Mayzie" which her classmates chant.

== Adaptations==
In 1995, prior to its actual publication, the book was adapted into a special for television on [[Turner Network Television|TNT]]. The special, which was produced by [[Hanna-Barbera]], can be found as a bonus feature on the ''[[Horton Hears a Who! (TV special)|Horton Hears a Who!]]'' Deluxe Edition DVD.

In 2011, Daisy-Head Mayzie was made a meetable character at [[Seuss Landing]] at Universal's Islands of Adventure.

===Cast===
*[[Francesca Marie Smith|Francesca Smith]] - Mayzie McGrew
*[[Henry Gibson]] - [[The Cat in the Hat]]
*[[Tim Curry]] - Finagle
*[[George Hearn]] - Mayor
*[[Lewis Arquette]] - Principal
*[[Jonathan Winters]] - Dr. Eisenbart
*[[Susan Silo]] - Miss Sneetcher
*[[B. J. Ward (actress)|B. J. Ward]] - Mrs. McGrew
*[[Paul Eiding]] - Mr. McGrew
*[[Robert Ridgely]] - Finch
*Benjamin Smith - Butch
*John Graas - Einstein

==Differences in the 2016 edition==
In 2016, after the popularity of ''[[What Pet Should I Get?]]'', the book was republished with Seuss' original text and illustrations. As such, there are several differences between the editions.

*The Cat in the Hat does not appear as the narrator. 
*The characters are all designed differently and are given normal hairstyles, as opposed to the wild hairstyles in the 1995 edition.
*The principal is named Grumm instead of McGrumm.
*Instead of catching all of the bees in his hat, the police officer puts a fishbowl over Mayzie's head to protect her from the bees.
*Mrs. McGrew is a housewife instead of a welder.
*The plot in which the agent gives Mayzie a contract to be rich and famous is completely absent.
*Because of the absence of the Cat in the Hat, the daisy instead assures Mayzie that everyone loves her, and her flight with the Cat on the flying umbrella is not present.

A '''drinking horn''' is the [[horn (anatomy)|horn]] of a [[bovid]] used as a  [[drinking vessel]]. Drinking horns are known from [[Classical Antiquity]] especially the [[Balkans]], and remained in use for ceremonial purposes throughout the [[Middle Ages]] and the [[Early Modern period]] in some parts of Europe, notably in [[Germanic-speaking Europe|Germanic Europe]], and in the [[peoples of the Caucasus|Caucasus]]. Drinking horns remain an important accessory in the culture of ritual [[toast (honor)|toasting]] in [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]] in particular, where they are known as ''[[kantsi]]''.&lt;ref name="Georgia"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A1033840 |title=bbc.co.uk |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=2003-05-13 |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinking vessels made from glass, wood, ceramics or metal styled in the shape of drinking horns are also known from antiquity.
The ancient Greek term for a drinking horn was simply ''[[:wikt:κέρας|keras]]'' (plural ''kerata'', "horn").&lt;ref&gt;Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', s.v. [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dke%2Fras κέρας] "III.3  drinking-horn, "ἐκ τοῦ κέρατος αὖ μοι δὸς πιεῖν" [[Hermippus]] 43 [...] "ἐξ ἀργυρέων κεράτων  πίνειν" [[Pindar]] Fr. 166 [?147] [...] "ἀργυρηλάτοις κέρασι χρυσᾶ στόμια προσβεβλημένοις" [[Aeschylus]] Fr. 185 [?170];  "ἐκπιόντι χρύσεον κέρας" [[Sophocles]] Fr. 483 [?429]".C.f. [[Wilhelm Pape|Pape]] (1842), s.v. [http://translate.academic.ru/%CE%BA%CE%AD%CF%81%CE%B1%CF%82/el/xx/1 κέρας].&lt;/ref&gt;  To be distinguished from the drinking-horn proper is the ''[[rhyton]]'' (plural ''rhyta''), a drinking-vessel made in the shape of a horn with an outlet at the pointed end.

==Antiquity==

Rybakov]], Язычество древней Руси ("Paganism of Ancient Rus", 1987, fig. 7).&lt;/ref&gt; Many of them depict warriors holding a drinking horn in their right hand.]]
[[File:Hochdorf drinking horn.jpg|thumb|The Hochdorf drinking horn (iron with sheet gold ornaments, capacity 5.5 litres)]]

Both in the Greek and the Scythian sphere, vessels of clay or metal shaped like horns were used alongside actual horns from an early time.
A Late Archaic (ca. 480 BC) [[Attic red-figure vase]] shows [[Dionysus]] and a [[satyr]] each holding a drinking horn.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text.jsp?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0043%3Aalphabetic+letter%3DK Kansas City 30.13] (ARV2, 249, no. 1), [[Campania]].&lt;/ref&gt;

During Classical Antiquity, the [[Thracians]] and [[Scythians]] in particular were known for their custom of drinking from horns (archaeologically, the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]] "[[Thraco-Cimmerian]]" horizon).
[[Xenophon]]'s account of his dealings with the Thracian leader [[Seuthes II|Seuthes]] suggests that drinking horns were integral part of the drinking ''kata ton Thrakion nomon'' ("after the Thracian fashion").
[[Diodorus]] gives an account of a feast prepared by the [[Getic]] chief [[Dromichaites]] for [[Lysimachus]] and selected captives, and the Getians' use of drinking vessels made from horn and wood is explicitly stated.

The Scythian elite also used horn-shaped ''rhyta'' made entirely from precious metal. A notable example is the 5th century BC gold-and-silver ''rhython'' in the shape of a [[Pegasus]] which was found in 1982 in Ulyap, [[Republic of Adygea|Adygea]], now at the Museum of Oriental Art in Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dla.library.upenn.edu/dla/fisher/image.html?fq=culture_facet:%22Scythian-Greek%22&amp;id=FISHER_n2002011086 upenn.edu], [http://vm.kemsu.ru/en/skyth/skyth-pegas.html kemsu.ru]&lt;/ref&gt;
M.I. Maksimova (1956) in an archaeological survey of Scythian drinking horns distinguished two basic types (excluding vessels of clearly foreign origin), a strongly curved type, and a slender type with only slight curvature; the latter type was identified as based on aurochs horns by Maksimova (1956:221). This typology became standard in Soviet-era archaeology.&lt;ref&gt;a more detailed survey of drinking Scythian drinking horn types was published by  E.V. Vlassova, ''Skifskij Rog'', in:  S.L. Solov'ev (ed.), ''Antichnoe Prichernomor'e''. Sbornik statej po klassicheskoy arkheologii (2000) 46-67 (=  J. Boardman  et al. (eds.) ''Northern Pontic Antiquities in the State Hermitage Museum'', Colloquia Pontica 7 (2001) 71-112).&lt;/ref&gt;
There are a few artistic representation of Scythans actually drinking from horns from the rim (rather than from the horn's point as with ''rhyta'').&lt;ref&gt;Wieland (2013) p. 28 (fn. 18).&lt;/ref&gt; The oldest remains of drinking horns or ''rhyta'' known from Scythan burials are dated to the 7th century BC, reflecting Scythian contact with oriental culture during their raids of the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire|Assyrian Empire]] at that time. After these early specimens, there is a gap with only sparse evidence of Scythian drinking horns during the 6th century. Drinking horns re-appear in the context of Pontic burials in the  5th century BC: these are the specimens classified as Scythian drinking horns by Maksimova (1956).
The 5th-century BC practice of depositing drinking horns with precious metal fittings as grave goods for deceased warriors appears to originate in the [[Kuban]] region.&lt;ref&gt;Wieland (2013:28&amp;ndash;34).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 4th century BC, the practice spreads throughout the Pontic Steppe. Rhyta, mostly of Achaemenid or Thracian import, continue to be found  in Scythian burials, but they are now clearly outnumbered by Scythian drinking horns proper. 
Around the midpoint of the 4th century BC, a new type of solid silver drinking horn with strong curvature appears. While the slightly curving horn type is found throughout the Pontic Steppe, specimens of the new type have not been found in the Kuban area.
The custom of depositing drinking horns as grave goods begins to subside towards the end of the 4th century BC.&lt;ref&gt;Wieland (2013:35&amp;ndash;45).&lt;/ref&gt;
The depiction of drinking horns on [[kurgan stelae]] appears to follow a slightly different chronology, with the earliest examples dated to the 6th century BC, and a steep increase in frequency during the 5th, but becoming rare by the 4th century (when actual deposits of drinking horns become most frequent). In the Crimean peninsula, such depictions appear somewhat later, from the 5th century BC, but then more frequently than elsewhere.&lt;ref&gt;Wieland (2013:47). The high frequency of such depictions in Crimea is contingent on the "Renaissance" of such stelae in general during the 5th and 4th centuries.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scythian drinking horns have been found almost exclusively in warrior burials. 
This has been taken as strongly suggesting an association of the drinking horn with the 
Scythian cult of kingship and warrior ethos. In the influential interpretation due to [[Michael Rostovtzeff|M. I. Rostovtzeff]] (1913), the Scythian ruler received the drinking horn from a deity as a symbol of his investiture. This interpretation is based on a number of depictions of a Scythian warrior drinking from a horn standing or kneeling next to a seated woman.&lt;ref&gt;M. I. Rostovtzeff, ''Predstavlenie o monarchicheskoy  vlasti v Skifii i na Bospore'', IAK 49, 1913. 
D.S.Raevsky (VDI 1980 (1) 95 f.) proposed a ceremony of [[sacred marriage]] between the Scythian ruler and the highest Scythian goddess, [[Scythian religion#Pantheon|Tabiti]]. A survey of later interpretations is presented in  A. Vinogradov, ''Peterburgskij archeologicheskiy vestnik'' 6, 1993.&lt;/ref&gt; Rolle (1980) interpreted the woman not as a goddess but as a high-ranking Scythian woman performing a ritual office.&lt;ref&gt;R. Rolle in: Festschrift K. Raddatz. ''Beiträge zur Archäologie Nordwestdeutschlands  und Mitteleuropas. Materialhefte zur Ur-und Frühgeschichte'' 16 (1980), 290f.&lt;/ref&gt;
Krausse (1996) interpreted the same scenes as depicting a marriage ceremony, with
the man drinking from the horn as part of an [[oath]] ritual comparable to the scenes of Scythian warriors jointly drinking from a horn in an oath of [[blood brother]]hood.&lt;ref&gt;D. Krausse, ''Hochdorf III. Das Trink- und Speiseservice  aus dem späthallstattzeitlichen Fürstengrab von  Eberdingen-Hochdorf (Kr. Ludwigsburg)'' (1996), 121.

The Scythian drinking horns are clearly associated with the consumption of [[History of wine#Antiquity|wine]].&lt;ref&gt;based on finds of horns in the context of other wine-related implements, e.g. in Kurgan nr. 13 in  Velikaja Znamenka, 
with a [[kyathos]] (dipper), a strainer and a deposit of fourteen wine amphorae. See Wieland (2013:46).&lt;/ref&gt;

The drinking horn reached [[Central Europe]] with the [[Iron Age Europe|Iron Age]], in the wider context of "[[Thraco-Cimmerian]]" cultural transmission. A number of early [[Celts|Celtic]] ([[Hallstatt culture]]) specimens are known, notably the remains of a huge gold-banded horn found at the [[Hochdorf Chieftain's Grave|Hochdorf burial]].
Krauße (1996) examines the  spread of the "fashion" of drinking horns (''Trinkhornmode'') in prehistoric Europe, assuming it reached the eastern [[prehistoric Balkans|Balkans]] from [[Scythia]] around 500 BC. It is more difficult to assess the role of plain animal horns as everyday drinking vessels, because these decay without a trace, while the metal fittings of the ceremonial drinking horns of the elite are preserved archaeologically.&lt;ref&gt;Gocha R. Tsetskhladze (ed.), ''Ancient Greeks West and East'', 1999, {{ISBN|978-90-04-11190-5}}, pp. 416ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Julius Caesar]] has a description of [[Gauls|Gaulish]] use of aurochs drinking horns  (''cornu urii'')  in  ''[[De bello gallico]]''  6.28:
:''„Amplitudo cornuum et figura et species multum a nostrorum boum cornibus differt. Haec studiose conquisita ab labris argento circumcludunt atque in amplissimis epulis pro poculis utuntur.“''
:"The [Gaulish] horns in size, shape, and kind are very different from those of our cattle. They are much sought-after, their rim fitted with silver, and they are used at great feasts as drinking vessels."

==Migration period==
[[File:Vendel-era bronze horn fittings and glass drinking horn (Swedish Museum of National Antiquities).jpg|thumb|[[Vendel era]] bronze horn fittings and glass drinking horn on display  at the [[Swedish Museum of National Antiquities]].]]
The [[Germanic peoples]] of the [[Migration period]] imitated glass drinking horns from Roman models.
One fine 5th century [[Merovingian]] example found at [[Bingerbrück]], [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] made from olive green glass is kept at the [[British Museum]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/g/glass_drinking-horn.aspx |title=britishmuseum.org |publisher=britishmuseum.org |date= |accessdate=2014-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Some of the skills of the Roman glass-makers survived in [[Lombards|Lombardic]] Italy, exemplified by a blue glass drinking-horn from [[Sutri]], also in the British Museum.
The two [[Golden Horns of Gallehus|Gallehus Horns]] (early 5th century), made from some 3&amp;nbsp;kg of [[gold]] and [[electrum]] each, are usually interpreted as drinking horns, although some scholars point out that it cannot be ruled out that they may have been intended as [[blowing horn]]s. After the discovery of the first of these horns in 1639, [[Christian IV of Denmark]] by 1641 did refurbish it into a usable drinking horn, adding a rim, extending its narrow end and closing it up with a screw-on pommel. These horns are the most spectacular known specimens of [[Germanic Iron Age]] drinking horns, but they were lost in 1802 and are now only known from 17th to 18th century drawings.

Some notable examples of drinking horns of Dark Ages Europe were  made of the horns of the [[Aurochs]], the wild ancestor of domestic [[cattle]] which became extinct in the 17th century. These horns were carefully dressed up and their edges lipped all round with [[silver]]. The remains of a notable example were recovered from the [[Sutton Hoo]] burial.&lt;ref&gt;[[Rupert Bruce-Mitford|R.L.S. Bruce-Mitford]], The Sutton Hoo ship burial-1, vol. 3 (London, The British Museum Press, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

The British Museum also has a fine pair of 6th century [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] drinking horns, made from Aurochs horns with silver-gilt mounts, recovered from the  princely burial at [[Taplow]], [[Buckinghamshire]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/explore/highlights/highlight_objects/pe_mla/p/pair_of_drinking_horns.aspx britishmuseum.org]; J. Stevens, 'On the remains found in an Anglo-Saxon tumulus at Taplow, Buckinghamshire', Journal of the British Archa-2, 40 (1884), pp. 61-71, plates 1, 11-12&lt;/ref&gt;

Numerous pieces of elaborate drinking equipment have been found in female graves in all pagan Germanic societies, beginning in the Germanic [[Roman Iron Age]] and spanning a full millennium, into the [[Viking Age]].&lt;ref&gt;"In Viking Age cemeteries, the combination of the bucket-container for distribution together with long-handled sieve and drinking horn or cup remains very common..." (Enright, pp. 103-104)&lt;/ref&gt;

Drinking horns are attested from  [[Viking Age]] Scandinavia. In the ''[[Prose Edda]]'', [[Thor]] drank from a horn that unbeknown to him contained all the seas, and in the process he scared [[Útgarða-Loki]] and his kin by managing to drink a conspicuous part of its content. They also feature in ''[[Beowulf]]'', and fittings for drinking horns were also found at the [[Sutton Hoo]] burial site. Carved horns are mentioned in ''[[Guðrúnarkviða II]]'', a poem composed about 1000 AD and preserved in the ''[[Poetic Edda]]'':

''[[Beowulf]]'' (493ff.) describes the serving of mead in carved horns.

Horn fragments of Viking Age drinking horns are only rarely preserved, showing that both cattle and goat horns were in use, but the number of decorative metal horn terminals and horn mounts recovered archaeologically show that the drinking horn was much more widespread than the small number of preserved horns would otherwise indicate.
Most Viking Age drinking horns were probably from domestic cattle, holding rather less than half a litre. The significantly larger aurochs horns of the Sutton Hoo burial would have been the exception.&lt;ref&gt;[[Arthur MacGregor]], ''Bone, Antler, Ivory &amp; Horn: The Technology of Skeletal Materials Since the Roman Period'', Taylor &amp; Francis, 1985, {{ISBN|978-0-7099-3242-0}}, p. 152&lt;/ref&gt;

==Medieval to Early Modern period==
Drinking horns were the ceremonial drinking vessel for those of high status all through the medieval period&lt;ref&gt;Hagen, p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt;
References to drinking horns in medieval literature include the [[Arthurian]] tale of [[Caradoc]] and the Middle English romance of [[King Horn]].
The [[Bayeux Tapestry]] (1070s) shows a scene of feasting before [[Harold Godwinson]] embarks for Normandy. Five figures are depicted as sitting at a table in the upper story of a building, three of them holding drinking horns.

Most Norwegian drinking horns preserved from the Middle Ages have ornamented metal mountings, while the horns themselves are smooth and unornamented. Carvings in the horns themselves are also known, but these appear relatively late, and are of a comparative simplicity that classifies them as folk art.&lt;ref&gt;Magerøy, p. 70.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge|Corpus Christi College]] of [[Cambridge University]] has a large [[aurochs]] drinking horn, allegedly predating the College's foundation in the 14th century, which is still drunk from at College feasts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/about-corpus/maps-and-tours/take-a-virtual-tour/217 corpus.cam.ac.uk] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607183624/http://www.corpus.cam.ac.uk/about-corpus/maps-and-tours/take-a-virtual-tour/217 |date=June 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Drinking horn of Sigismund of Luxemburg.PNG|166px|thumb|Drinking horn of Sigismund of Luxemburg, before 1408]]

The "Oldenburg horn" was made in 1474/75 by German artisans for [[Christian I of Denmark]] when he visited Cologne to reconcile [[Charles the Bold]] of Burgundy. It is made of silver and gilt, richly ornamented with the coats of arms of Burgundy and Denmark. The horn has its name from being kept in the [[Oldenburg]] family castle for two centuries before being moved to its present location in Copenhagen. It became associated in legend with count [[Otto I of Oldenburg]], who was supposed to have received it from a fairy woman in 980.

Drinking horns remained in use for ceremonial purposes throughout the Early Modern period. A magnificent drinking horn was made for the showpiece of the Amsterdam Guild of Arquebusiers by Amsterdam jeweller Arent Coster in 1547, now kept in the [[Rijksmuseum Amsterdam|Rijksmuseum]].

In 17th to 18th century [[Scotland]], a distinct type of drinking horn develops.
One aurochs drinking horn  still preserved in [[Dunvegan Castle]] on the [[Isle of Skye]] in [[Scotland]]. It was only produced before guests, and the drinker in using it, twisted his arms round its spines, and turning his mouth towards the right shoulder, was expected to drain it off.&lt;ref&gt;''Dwelly’s [Scottish] Gaelic Dictionary'': Còrn&lt;/ref&gt;

[[German Renaissance]] and [[Baroque]] horns often were lavishly decorated with silverwork.
One such example is depicted in a 1653 painting by [[Willem Kalf]], known as ''Still Life with Drinking Horn''.

==Modern period==
[[File:Sif from Swedish Edda translation.jpg|thumb|right|An 1893 depiction of the [[Norse goddess]] [[Sif]] holding a drinking horn.]]
Lavishly decorated drinking horns in the Baroque style, some imitating [[cornucopia]]s, some made from [[ivory]], including gold, silver and [[Vitreous enamel|enamel]] decorations continued to be produced as luxury items
in 19th to early 20th century [[Austrian Empire|imperial Austria]] and [[German Empire|Germany]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vfkk.de/beilage208.html ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719112207/http://www.vfkk.de/beilage208.html |date=July 19, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in the 19th century, drinking horns inspired by the [[Romanticism|Romantic]] [[Viking revival]] were made for German [[Studentenverbindung|student corps]] for ritual drinking.
In the context of Romanticism, a ceremonial drinking horn with decorations depicting the story of the [[Mead of Poetry]] was given to Swedish poet [[Erik Gustaf Geijer]] by his students in 1817, now in the Private Collection of Johan Paues, Stockholm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.civilization.ca/media/docs/images/vik05b.jpg ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061203050347/http://www.civilization.ca/media/docs/images/vik05b.jpg |date=December 3, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ram or goat drinking horns, known as ''[[kantsi]]'', remain an important accessory in the culture of ritual [[Toast (honor)|toasting]] in  [[Georgia (country)|Georgia]].
During a formal dinner (''supra'') Georgians propose a toast, led by a toastmaster (''tamada'') who sets the topic of each round of toasting.  Toasts are made with either wine or brandy, toasting with beer is considered an insult.&lt;ref name="Georgia"/&gt;

In [[Swiss culture]], a large drinking horn together with a wreath of oak leaves is the traditional prize for the winning team of a [[Hornussen]] tournament.

Modern-day [[Asatru]] adherents use drinking horns for [[Blót]]s and [[sumbel]]s.

[[Image:dust jacket.jpg|thumb|right|A dust jacket, propped up and partially unfolded for illustration]]
The '''dust jacket''' (sometimes '''book jacket''', '''dust wrapper''' or '''dust cover''') of a book is the detachable outer cover, usually made of paper and printed with text and illustrations. This outer cover has folded flaps that hold it to the front and back [[book cover]]s. Often the back panel or flaps are printed with biographical information about the author, a summary of the book from the publisher (known as a [[blurb]]), and/or critical praise from celebrities or authorities in the book's subject area. In addition to its promotional role, the dust jacket protects the book covers from damage. However, since it is itself relatively fragile, and since dust jackets have practical, aesthetic, and sometimes financial value, the jacket may in turn be wrapped in another jacket, usually transparent, especially if the book is a [[public library|library]] volume.

== Early history ==
Before the 1820s, most books were published as unbound sellers and were generally sold to customers either in this form, or in simple bindings executed for the bookseller, or in bespoke bindings commissioned by the customer. At this date, publishers did not have their books bound in uniform "house" bindings, so there was no reason for them to issue dust jackets. Book owners did occasionally fashion their own jackets out of [[leather]], [[wallpaper]], fur, or other material, and many other types of detachable protective covers were made for [[codex|codices]], [[manuscript]]s, and [[scroll]]s from ancient times through the [[Middle Ages]] and into the modern period.

At the end of the 18th century publishers began to issue books in plain paper-covered boards, sometimes with a printed spine-label; this form of binding was intended to be temporary. Some collections of loose prints were issued at this period in printed paper wrappings, again intended to be temporary. In the first two decades of the nineteenth century, publishers started issuing some smaller books in bindings of printed paper-covered boards, and throughout the 1820s and 1830s some small popular books, notably annual gift-books and almanacs, were issued in detachable printed [[card stock|pasteboard]] sheaths. These small boxes are sometimes loosely and erroneously referred to as the first dust jackets. True publisher's bindings in cloth and leather, in which all, or a substantial part of, an edition were bound, were also introduced shortly before 1820, by the innovative publisher [[William Pickering (publisher)|William Pickering]].

===Oldest dust jackets===
After publishers' [[Bookbinding#Hardcover binding|cloth bindings]] started coming into common use on all types of books in the 1820s, the first publishers' dust jackets appeared by the end of that decade. The earliest known examples were issued on English literary annuals which were popular from the 1820s to the 1850s. These books often had fancy bindings that needed protection. The jackets that were used at this time completely enclosed the books like [[wrapping paper]] and were sealed shut with [[wax]] or [[glue]].

The oldest publishers' dust jacket now on record was issued in 1829 on an English annual, ''Friendship's Offering'' for 1830. It was discovered at the [[Bodleian Library]] in Oxford by Michael Turner, a former curator and Head of Conservation at the Library. Its existence was announced by Oxford in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://www.theguardian.com/books/2009/apr/24/earliest-dust-jacket-library "Earliest-known book jacket discovered in Bodleian Library"] (Michelle Pauli, guardian.co.uk, Friday 24 April 2009).&lt;/ref&gt; It is three years older than the previous oldest known jacket, which was discovered in 1934 by the English [[Bookman (reading)|bookman]] [[John Carter (author)|John Carter]] on another English annual, ''The Keepsake'' for 1833 (issued in 1832).&lt;ref&gt;Carter, author of the classic ''ABC for Book Collectors'', reported his find in the September 22, 1934, issue of ''Publisher's Weekly''&lt;/ref&gt; Both jackets are of the type that completely enclosed the books.

Most jackets of this type were torn when they were opened and then discarded like gift-wrapping paper; they were not designed to be reused, and surviving examples are known on only a handful of titles. The scarcity of jackets of this type, together with the lack of written documentation from publishers of the period, makes it very hard to determine how widely these all-enclosing jackets were used during the period from 1820 to 1850, but they were probably common on ornately bound annuals and on some trade books.

The earliest known dust jackets of the modern style, with flaps, which covered just the binding and left the text block exposed, date from the 1850s, although this type of jacket was probably in at least limited use some years earlier. This is the jacket that became standard in the publishing industry and is still in use today. It is believed that flap-style jackets were in general use by the 1880s, and probably earlier, although the number of surviving examples from the 1850s, 1860s, and 1870s is too small to prove exactly when they became ubiquitous, and again, there are no known publishers' records that document the use of dust jackets during these decades. There are, however, enough surviving examples from the 1890s to state unequivocally that dust jackets were all but universal throughout that decade. They were probably issued more often than not by the 1860s and 1870s in Europe, Great Britain, and the United States.

==Late 19th and early 20th centuries==
[[File:Hermione - dust jacket.jpg|thumb|right|180px|Dust jacket of ''Hermione and her Little Group of Serious Thinkers'' by [[Don Marquis]], an early work of humour, produced in 1916.]]

Throughout the nineteenth century, nearly all dust jackets were discarded at or soon after purchase. Many were probably discarded in bookstores as the books were put out for display, or when they were sold; there is evidence that this was common practice in England until World War I. The period from the 1820s to 1900 was a golden age for publishers' decorative bookbinding, and most dust jackets were much plainer than the books they covered, often simply repeating the main elements of the binding decoration in black on cream or brown paper. For this reason, most people preferred to display their books in their bindings, much as earlier generations had displayed their library books in their gold-tooled individual bindings, usually in leather or [[vellum]]. Even late in the nineteenth century there were still some publishers who were not using dust jackets at all (the English publisher [[Methuen Publishing|Methuen]] is one example). Some firms, such as subscription houses which sold millions of cheap books [[door-to-door]], probably never used them.

Cloth dust jackets became popular late in the nineteenth century. These jackets, with the outer cloth usually reinforced with an underlayer of paper, were issued mostly on ornate gift editions, often in two volumes and often with a [[slipcase]]. Other types of publishers' boxes were also popular in the second half of the nineteenth century, including many made to hold multi-volume sets of books. The jackets on boxed volumes were often plain, sometimes with cutouts on the spine to allow the title or volume numbers of the books to be seen.

After 1900, fashions in, and the economics of, publishing caused book bindings to become less decorative, and it was cheaper for publishers to make the jackets more attractive. By around 1920, most of the artwork and decoration had migrated from the binding to the dust jacket, and jackets were routinely printed with multiple colors, extensive advertising and blurbs; even the underside of the jacket was now sometimes used for advertising.

As dust jackets became more attractive than the bindings, more people began to keep the jackets on their books, at least until they became soiled, torn, or worn out. One bit of evidence that indicates when jackets became saved objects is the movement of the printed price from the spine of the jacket to a corner of one of the flaps. This also occurred in the 1910s and early 1920s. When jackets were routinely discarded at point of purchase, it did not matter where the price was printed (and many early jackets were not printed with any price), but now if book buyers of the 1910s and 1920s wanted to save the jacket and give a book as a gift, they could clip off the price without ruining the jacket.

=== Supplementary bands ===
In Japan, both hardcover and softcover books frequently come with two dust jackets – a full-sized one, serving the same purpose as in the West (it is usually retained with the book), and a thin "[[Obi (publishing)|obi]]" ("belt"; colloquially "belly band" in English), which is generally disposed of and serves a similar function to 19th century Western dust jackets.

Similar bands occasionally appear in the west, for example in [[Palookaville (comics)|Palookaville]] #20.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.shelfari.com/my_weblog/2010/11/graphic-novel-friday-enter-the-new-palookaville.html Graphic Novel Friday: Enter the New Palookaville], Alex Carr, ''Shelfari,'' November 12, 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==As collectible items==
Dust jackets from the 1920s and later were often decorated in [[art deco]] styles which are highly prized by collectors. Some of them are worth far more than the books they cover. The most famous example is the jacket on the first edition of ''[[The Great Gatsby]]'' by [[F. Scott Fitzgerald]], published in 1925. Without jacket, the book brings $1,000 or so. With the jacket it can bring $20,000 or $30,000 or more, depending on condition. One copy in a near mint jacket was listed for sale in 2009 for half a million dollars.&lt;ref&gt;See the [http://www.abebooks.com/servlet/BookDetailsPL?bi=1042916914&amp;searchurl=imagefield.x%3D11%26imagefield.y%3D7%26kn%3Dfitzgerald%26prl%3D10.00%26sortby%3D1%26sts%3Dt listing at ABEbooks.com], unsold as of April, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; The most valuable jackets are usually those on the high spots of literature. Condition is of paramount importance to value. Other examples of highly prized jackets include those on most of Ernest Hemingway's titles, and the first editions of books such as Harper Lee's ''To Kill A Mockingbird,'' J. D. Salinger's ''Catcher in the Rye'' and Dashiell Hammett's ''The Maltese Falcon'', among many others. Prices for dust jackets have become so inflated in recent years that even early reprints of certain titles in jacket can command good prices. Conversely, if the book itself is unimportant, or at least has little demand, the jacket is usually of little value either, but nearly all surviving pre-1920 jackets add some additional value to the book they cover.

Some collectors and dealers, in an effort to increase the value of a [[first edition]] that has lost its original jacket, will take a jacket from a later printing and "marry" it to the earlier one. This practice persists because some customers will pay more for a first edition in a later jacket than they would for a jacketless copy. However, switching jackets muddles the bibliographical record and creates a [[forgery]] of sorts.

'''El Tajín''' is a [[pre-Columbian]] archeological site in southern [[Mexico]] and is one of the largest and most important cities of the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Classic era of Mesoamerica]]. A part of the [[Classic Veracruz culture]], El Tajín flourished from 600 to 1200 CE and during this time numerous temples, palaces, [[Mesoamerican ballcourt|ballcourts]], and pyramids were built.&lt;ref name="wilkerson7273"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S.

==Location==
The site is located in [[Mexico]] in the highlands of the municipality of [[Papantla, Veracruz|Papantla]] in modern-day [[Veracruz]], not far from the city of [[Poza Rica, Veracruz|Poza Rica]], which lies northwest of the port and city of [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]].

Most of the buildings are at the southern end, where the land is relatively flat and the two streams converge. The site extends to the northwest where terraces where constructed to place more buildings, mostly for the city’s elite. However the city also had communities located on the hills east and west of the main city, with mostly lower-class dwellings.&lt;ref name="prodigiosa"/&gt; Total site extends for {{convert|1056|ha|sqmi}}.&lt;ref name="zaleta15"&gt;{{cite book |title= Tajín: Misterio y Belleza |last= Zaleta |first= Leonardo |year=2007 |edition= 15 |publisher= Artes Impresas Eón SA deCV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |page=15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The area is rainforest, with a hot wet climate of the Senegal type. Average temperature for the year is 35&amp;nbsp;°C with hurricanes possible from June to October. It is also affected by a weather phenomenon called “nortes.” These are cold fronts with winds that come from the north and down the Tamaulipas and Veracruz coasts.&lt;ref name="zaleta15"/&gt; The site has no major settlements located next to it. Surrounding it are tobacco fields, banana plantations, apiaries and vanilla groves. The closest settlement of any real size is Papantla.&lt;ref name="aschuster"/&gt;

==Name==
When it was rediscovered by officialdom in 1785, the site was known to the local [[Totonac]], whose ancestors may also have built the city, as El Tajín, which was said to mean “of thunder or lightning bolt”. Related to this is their belief that twelve old thunderstorm deities, known as Tajín, still inhabit the ruins. However, a series of indigenous maps dating from the time of the Spanish conquest, found in nearby [[Tihuatlán (municipality)|Tihuatlan]] and now known as the Lienzos de Tuxpan, suggest that the city might then have been called “[[Mictlan]]” or “place of the dead”, a common denomination for ancient sites whose original names have been lost. This name also appears in the Matricula de Tributos, a surviving Aztec tribute record, which later formed part of the [[Codex Mendoza]]. This may therefore be linked to another Totonac meaning claimed for El Tajín: “place of the invisible beings or spirits”.&lt;ref name="aschuster"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkerson16"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S.

==History of the city==
[[Image:Tajin1913.jpg|thumbnail|270px|left|Pyramid of the Niches before restoration (1913 photo).  The present-day view of the pyramid can be seen [[:Image:El Tajín Pyramid of the Niches.jpg|here]].]]

Chronology studies at Tajín and nearby sites show that the area has been occupied at least since 5600 BCE and show how nomadic hunters and gatherers eventually became sedentary farmers, building more complex societies prior to the rise of the city of El Tajin.&lt;ref name="wilkerson23"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K. |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=23  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The pace of this societal progression became more rapid with the rise of the neighboring [[Olmec]] civilization around 1150 BCE, although the Olmecs were never here in great numbers.&lt;ref name="natgeo"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Wilkerson |first1= S Jeffrey K.  |date=August 1980 |title= Man’s Eighty Centuries in Veracruz |journal= National Geographic |volume=158 |issue=2 |pages=214–217 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear who built the city. Some argue in favor of the Totonacs and the Xapaneca; however, there is a significant amount of evidence that the area was populated by the [[Huastec people|Huastec]] at the time the settlement was founded in the 1st century CE&lt;ref name="wilkerson23"/&gt;&lt;ref name="zaleta23"&gt;{{cite book |title= Tajín: Misterio y Belleza |last= Zaleta |first= Leonardo |year=2007 |edition= 15 |publisher= Artes Impresas Eón SA deCV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |page=23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Monumental construction started soon after and by 600 CE, El Tajín was a city.&lt;ref name="aschuster"/&gt;&lt;ref name="origenes"&gt;{{cite news |title= Esclarecen orígenes de la cultura de El Tajín |url=http://www.eluniversal.com.mx/notas/427088.html |agency=Notimex |newspaper=El Universal |location=Mexico City |date=2007-05-24 |accessdate=2010-02-09 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Origins of the culture of El Tajin becoming clearer }}&lt;/ref&gt; The rapid rise of Tajin was due to its strategic position along the old Mesoamerican trade routes. It controlled the flow of commodities, both exports such as vanilla and imports from other locations in what is now Mexico and Central America. From the early centuries, objects from [[Teotihuacan]] are abundant.&lt;ref name="origenes"/&gt;

From 600 to 1200 CE, El Tajín was a prosperous city that eventually controlled much of what is now modern Veracruz state. The city-state was highly centralized,&lt;ref name="wilkerson7273"/&gt;  with the city itself having more than fifty ethnicities living there.&lt;ref name="zaleta16"&gt;{{cite book |title= Tajín: Misterio y Belleza |last= Zaleta |first= Leonardo |year=2007 |edition= 15 |publisher= Artes Impresas Eón SA deCV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |page=16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most of the population lived in the hills surrounding the main city,&lt;ref name="zaleta5"/&gt;  and the city obtained most of its foodstuffs from the [[Tecolutla]], [[Nautla, Veracruz|Nautla]] and [[Cazones de Herrera|Cazones]] areas. These fields not only produced staples such as corn and beans but luxury items such as [[cacao bean|cacao]]. One of the panels at the Pyramid of the Niches shows a ceremony being held at a cacao tree.&lt;ref name="wilkerson7273"/&gt; The religion was based on the movements of the planets, the stars and the Sun and Moon,&lt;ref name="zaleta15"/&gt; with the [[Mesoamerican ballgame]] and [[pulque]] having extremely important parts. This led to the building of many pyramids with temples and seventeen ballcourts, more than any other Mesoamerican site.&lt;ref name="aschuster"/&gt; The city began to have extensive influence starting around this time,&lt;ref name="wilkerson10"/&gt; which can be best seen at the neighboring site of [[Yohualichan]], whose buildings show the kinds of niches that define El Tajin.&lt;ref name="prodigiosa"/&gt; Evidence of the city’s influence can be seen along the Veracruz Gulf coast to the [[Maya civilization|Maya]] region and into the [[Mexican plateau|high plateau of central Mexico]].&lt;ref name="WHOTaj"/&gt;

At the end of the Classic period, El Tajín survived the widespread social collapse, migrations and destructions that forced the abandonment of many population centers at the end of this period.&lt;ref name="wilkerson10"/&gt; El Tajín reached its peak after the fall of Teotihuacan, and conserved many cultural traits inherited from that civilization.&lt;ref name="WHOTaj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="origenes"/&gt; It reached its apogee in the Epi-Classic (900-1100 CE) before suffering destruction and the encroachment of the jungle.&lt;ref name="wilkerson10"/&gt;

El Tajín prospered until the early years of the 13th century, when it was destroyed by fire, presumably started by an invading force believed to be the [[Chichimeca|Chichimecs]].&lt;ref name="softseattravel.com"/&gt; The Totonacs established the nearby settlement of [[Papantla, Veracruz|Papantla]] after the fall of El Tajín. El Tajín was left to the jungle and remained covered and silent for over 500 years.&lt;ref name="zaleta24"&gt;{{cite book |title= Tajín: Misterio y Belleza |last= Zaleta |first= Leonardo |year=2007 |edition= 15 |publisher= Artes Impresas Eón SA deCV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |page=24 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While the city had been completely covered by jungle from its demise until the 19th century, it is unlikely that knowledge of the place was completely lost to the native peoples. Archeological evidence shows that a village existed here at the time the Spanish arrived and the area has always been considered sacred by the Totonacs. However, there are no records by any Europeans about the place prior to the late 18th century.&lt;ref name="wilkerson12"/&gt;

==History of its rediscovery==
In 1785, an official by the name of Diego Ruiz stumbled upon the Pyramid of the Niches, whilst looking for clandestine tobacco plantings breaching the royal monopoly in this isolated area rarely visited by the authorities.&lt;ref name="prodigiosa"/&gt; He made a drawing of the pyramid and reported his find to a publication called Gaceta de Mexico. He claimed the natives had kept the place secret.&lt;ref name="wilkerson13"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=13  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publication of the pyramid’s existence in the Gaceta influenced academic circles in [[New Spain]] and Europe, attracting the attention of antiquarians [[José Antonio Alzate y Ramírez]] and Ciriaco Gonazlez Carvajal, who wrote about it. It also gained the interest of several academics, who compared the pyramid with the constructions of [[ancient Rome]].&lt;ref name="llopez"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arqueomex.com/S2N3nTajin89.html |title=El Tajín en el siglo xviii Dos exploraciones pioneras en Veracruz |first=Leonardo |last=López Luján |publisher=Arqueomex magazine |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |trans-title=El Tajin in the 18th century: two pioneering explorations in Veracruz |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100206104815/http://arqueomex.com/S2N3nTajin89.html |archivedate=2010-02-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pyramid was further advertised by Italian Pietro Márquez in Europe and by [[Alexander von Humboldt]].&lt;ref name="wilkerson13"/&gt;

[[File:Carl Nebel02.jpg|thumb|One of Carl Nebel's drawings of the Pyramid of the Niches]]
Since its discovery by Europeans, the site has attracted visitors for two centuries.&lt;ref name="wilkerson10"/&gt; German architect Charles Nebel visited the site in 1831 and was the first to graphically and narratively detail the Pyramid of the Niches as well as the nearby ruins of Mapilca and Tuzapan. He was also the first to speculate that the pyramid was part of a larger city. His drawings and descriptions were published in a book named ''Voyage pittoresque et archéologique'' published in Paris in 1836.&lt;ref name="llopez"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkerson14"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K. |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9 |page=14 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first archeologists reached the site in the early 20th century and included [[Teobert Maler]], [[Edward Seler]], [[Francisco del Paso y Troncoso]] and Herbert and Ellen Spinden.  With the discovery of oil in the area came roads that were built and improved from the 1920s to the 1940s. This allowed for more intensive investigation of the area. In 1935-38 the first formal mapping, clearing and exploration was done by Agustin Garcia Vega.   The first building to be completely cleared of jungle growth was the Pyramid of the Niches. He eventually cleared {{convert|77|acre|m2}}, uncovering more buildings and proposed that it be called “The Archeological City of El Tajín.” Starting from 1938, excavation and reconstruction work was sponsored by [[INAH]] and headed by Jose Garcia Payon,&lt;ref name="wilkerson16"/&gt; uncovering platforms, ballcourts and part of Tajín Chico with its palaces.  He continued to explore the site for 39 years until his death in 1977 despite the challenges of working in the jungle and the lack of funds. By this time, he had uncovered most of the major buildings and established that Tajín was one of the most important cities of ancient Mexico. By the 1970s, the site was one of the few in Veracruz state that attracted significant numbers of tourists.&lt;ref name="prodigiosa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkerson1416"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |pages=14–16  }}&lt;/ref&gt; From 1984 to 1994, Jürgen K. Brüggemann built on the work of García Payón, uncovering 35 more buildings.&lt;ref name="prodigiosa"/&gt; It is believed that only half of El Tajin archeological site has been uncovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.archaeology.org/online/features/sapieha/tajin/ |title=The Photography of Nicolas Sapieha: El Tajin |publisher=Archaeology.org |date=1998-02-13 |accessdate=2012-11-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==World Heritage Site==
[[File:PlaqueWHSTajin.JPG|thumb|left|World Heritage Site plaque]]
El Tajín was inscribed as a [[World Heritage Site]] in 1992, because of its historical significance and architecture and engineering.&lt;ref name="WHOTaj"/&gt;&lt;ref name="patrimonialinah"/&gt; “Its architecture, which is unique in Mesoamerica, is characterized by elaborate carved reliefs on the columns and frieze. The 'Pyramid of the Niches', a masterpiece of ancient Mexican and American architecture, reveals the astronomical and symbolic significance of the buildings.”&lt;ref name="WHOTaj"/&gt; The site is one of the most important in Mexico and the most important in the state of Veracruz.&lt;ref name="patrimonialinah"/&gt;

Its significance is due to its size and unique forms of art and architecture.&lt;ref name="wilkerson10"/&gt; The borders of the city’s residential areas have not yet been defined but is the entire site is estimated at {{convert|2640|acre|km2}}.&lt;ref name="wilkerson16"/&gt; To date, only about fifty percent of the city's buildings has been excavated, revealing a series of plazas, palaces, and administrative buildings within a two-square-mile area.&lt;ref name="aschuster"/&gt; Unlike the highly rigid grid patterns of ancient cities in the central highlands of Mexico,  the builders of El Tajin designed  and aligned buildings as individual units.&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;
There are several architectural features here which are unique to the place or seen in only rarely in Mesoamerica. Adornment in the form of niches and stepped frets are omnipresent, decorating even utilitarian [[buttress]]es and platform walls. [[fretwork|Stepped frets]] are seen in other parts of Mesoamerica but rarely to this extent. The use of niches is unique to El Tajin.&lt;ref name="wilkerson10"/&gt;

One notable aspect of the construction at El Tajin is the use of poured cement in forms. Surviving roof fragments from Building C in the Tajín Chico section is an example of cement roof constructions. Due to the lack of beams or other materials to prop it up, this roof had to be very thick to support itself. To lighten the load and to bind the layers of cement, pumice stones and pottery shards were mixed into the cement. The cement could not be poured all at once but rather in successive layers. It has been suggested that the buildings were filled with earth to support the roof as it was being poured and dried.&lt;ref name="wilkerson37"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=37  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The finished roofs were nearly a meter thick and almost perfectly flat. While this kind of cement roof is common in modern times, it was unique in the Mesoamerican world. Impressions of baskets, tamale wrappers and other items have been found in the dried cement.&lt;ref name="wilkerson38"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=38  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The poured cement was used in the only building with two floors at the site, Building B, as a roof and as a separator between the ground and upper floor.&lt;ref name="wilkerson45"/&gt; The only other known example of two story construction is in the Mayan territories. Another feature shared only with the Mayans is the use of a light blue paint.&lt;ref name="fsolis"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/interior/index.php?p=nota&amp;idNota=6967 |title=El embrujo de El Tajín (Veracruz) |first=Felipe |last=Solís |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=The magic of El Tajín (Veracruz) |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100204080711/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/interior/index.php?p=nota&amp;idNota=6967 |archivedate=2010-02-04 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; (wikerson45) Another feature unique to El Tajin is that a number of the residences have windows placed to allow cool breezes to enter on hot days.&lt;ref name="prodigiosa"/&gt;

While ballcourts are common in Mesoamerica, El Tajin distinguishes itself by having seventeen. Two of these ballcourts contain sculpted panels which depict the ball game and its ritual significance. The most impressive of these panels are on the South Ballcourt which contain images of underworld deities and a ballplayer being decapitated in order to approach the gods and ask for pulque for his people.&lt;ref name="aschuster"/&gt;

Since becoming a World Heritage Site, research and conservation efforts have been made to promote knowledge of and protect the site. There have been a number of research projects as well as reconstruction projects and projects to make more of the site accessible to visitors. However, the director states that more needs to be done to conserve the site, especially its fragile murals, and to balance the needs of tourists against the need to conserve the site in general. Each year since 1992, the number of visitors to the site increases which now stands at 653,000 annually.&lt;ref name="patrimonialinah"/&gt;

Air pollution from oil-drilling platforms and power stations along the coast causes high levels of acid rain in the region, which is eroding the intricately carved reliefs on the soft limestone buildings “at an alarming rate”, according to Humberto Bravo of the University of Mexico's Center for Atmospheric Sciences in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Ancient Mexican Carvings Being Erased by Acid Rain, Experts Say |author=Stefan Lovgren |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/01/070126-mexico-tajin.html |newspaper=National Geographic News |date=January 26, 2007 |accessdate=2011-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Major monuments ==

===The entrance and site museum===
The entrance to the site is located at the south end. In being named a World Heritage Site in 1992, new facilities have been added to this area, such as a cafeteria, information services, a park and administrative offices.&lt;ref name="patrimonialinah"/&gt; The site museum is also located here. In addition, the Danza de los Voladores is enacted at the entrance to the site and is considered a requirement for visitors.&lt;ref name="fsolis"/&gt;  The voladores appear every half-hour at the pole and circle erected just outside the main gate.&lt;ref name="mexdes1"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6344-Los-voladores-de-Papantla-%28Veracruz%29 |title=Los voladores de Papantla (Veracruz) |publisher=Mexico Desconocido magazine |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |trans-title=The Voladores of Papantla |accessdate=2010-02-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090418010531/http://www.mexicodesconocido.com.mx/notas/6344-Los-voladores-de-Papantla-%28Veracruz%29 |archivedate=2009-04-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The park is named '''Parque Takilhsukut''' and is located about one km outside the site proper. It is a modern facility with the aim of being a center of Veracruz indigenous identity. It covers 17 hectares with a capacity of 40,000 people. It hosts fairs, conventions and other events, including part of the annual Cumbre Tajín cultural festival which is held in March. There are also facilities for workshops, exhibitions, alternative therapies, seminars and ceremonies.&lt;ref name="ptak"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cumbretajin.com/esp/idt/8/cumbre-tajin--parque-tematico-takilhsukut//1-1-3 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303105443/http://www.cumbretajin.com/esp/idt/8/cumbre-tajin--parque-tematico-takilhsukut//1-1-3/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2008-03-03 |title=Parque Takilhsukut |publisher=Cumbre Tajin |location=Mexico |language=Spanish |accessdate=2010-02-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:HeadScuptureYTajin.JPG|thumb|left|Sculpture on display at the site museum]]
The '''site museum''' is divided into two parts: an enclosed building and a roofed area covering large stone sculpture fragments. The enclosed room is for smaller objects that have been found during the years the site has been explored, most coming from the Pyramid of the Niches. One of the most interesting objects on display is an altar from Building 4. It is a large stone slab sculpted to depict four individuals standing in pairs with a figure of intertwined snakes between the two pairs. The snakes represent the ball game marker called the tlaxmalacatle in [[Aztec]] times.  The main exhibits of the roofed area are the fragments recovered from the Building of the Columns, with a number partially reassembled. One tells the story of 13 Rabbit, a ruler of El Tajin who  probably had the building constructed. The scene shows as dual procession with 13 Rabbit seated on a wooden throne and his feet on a severed head. In front is a sacrifice victim with his entrails slung over a frame. 13 Rabbit’s name glyph appears above as well as an attendant named 4 Axe.  The rest of the procession consists of warriors holding captives by their hair.&lt;ref name="wilkerson71"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=71  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arroyo Group===
[[File:SECornerArroyoTajin.JPG|thumb|Approaching Arroyo Group from south east]]
This is called the Arroyo Group because two streams surround it on three sides.  This area is one of the oldest sections of the city, and is more than {{convert|86100|sqft|m2}}. It is flanked by four high buildings, named Buildings 16, 18, 19 and 20, which were topped by temples. Stairways lead from the plaza floor to the temples above.  Unlike the rest of the city, these four buildings are uniform in height and nearly symmetrical.  The pyramids here are primitive in comparison to the rest of the site, with niches that are not as finely formed.&lt;ref name="wilkerson25"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=25  }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zaleta37"&gt;{{cite book |title= Tajín: Misterio y Belleza |last= Zaleta |first= Leonardo |year=2007 |edition= 15 |publisher= Artes Impresas Eón SA deCV |location=Mexico City |language=Spanish |page=37 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The east and west pyramids of the arroyo group each held three temples at the top.&lt;ref name="prodigiosa"/&gt; Another unusual feature is that this plaza has no smaller structures such as buildings or altars to break up the space. It has been determined that this was the city marketplace because of the large plaza space for stalls and for a deity found here that is related to commerce.  The merchant deity found here has features more in common with this kind of deity in the central highlands of Mexico than of Tajín.&lt;ref name="wilkerson25"/&gt; The market that filled this plaza consisted of stalls made with sticks and cloth offering regional products such as vanilla as well as products from other parts of Mesoamerica such as jaguar skins, exotic birds such as the [[true parrots|parrot]]  and the [[Ara (genus)|macaw]] and [[quetzal]] feathers. Slaves for service and sacrifice were also sold here.&lt;ref name="prodigiosa"/&gt;  West of the building on the south side is a large ball court with sloped sides and sculpted friezes depicting the god [[Quetzalcoatl]].  When the city fell, most of the sculptures in this area were smashed or defaced with some being reused as building stone.&lt;ref name="prodigiosa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkerson25"/&gt;

===The Pyramid of the Niches===
[[File:PyramidNiches1.JPG|thumb|The Pyramid of the Niches]]
This pyramid has as a number of names including, El Tajín, Pyramid of Papantla, Pyramid of the Seven Stories and the Temple of the Niches. It has become the focus of the site because of its unusual design and good state of preservation.  It was prominent in ancient times as well. A large quantity of sculpture was recovered from this pyramid.  The building is mostly constructed of carefully cut and crafted [[flagstone]]s, the largest of which is estimated to be about eight metric tons in weight. The stones, especially around the niches are fitted together as to need a minimum amount of lime and earth mortar. The structure originally was covered in stucco which served as the base for paint.&lt;ref name="wilkerson28"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=28  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pyramid has seven stories. Each of these consists of a sloping base wall called a talud and a vertical wall called a [[talud-tablero|tablero]], which was fairly common in Mesoamerica.  What is unusual about this construction and others in the city are the addition of decorative niches with the top capped by what Jose Garcia Payon called a “flying [[cornice]],” a triangular overhang.  The stones are arranged in controlled lines and delicate proportions.  Originally the structure was painted a dark red with the niches in black intended to deepen the shadows of the recessed niches. Niches are also found underneath the stairway along the east face, which indicates that the stairway was a later addition.  The niches on the original structure, not counting those on the later stairway, total 365, the solar year. At the top of the pyramid there were tablets framed by grotesque serpent-dragons.&lt;ref name="natgeo"/&gt;&lt;ref name="wilkerson29"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=29  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ritual function of the building is not primarily calendaric. The deep niches imitate caves, which long have been considered to be passageways to the [[underworld]], where many of the gods reside.  Caves, especially those with springs, have been considered sacred in much of Mexico with offerings of flowers and candles being traditional. As last as the mid 20th century, remains of beeswax candles could still be found left on the first level of this pyramid. There is a popular belief that each niche contained an idol or [[effigy]] but archeological work here has ruled this out. The most important part of the structure was the temple that was on top of this pyramid; however, this was completely destroyed and little is known about what it might have looked like.&lt;ref name="wilkerson30"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=30  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Tablet27Nichos.JPG|thumb|Tablet 27 from the Pyramid of the Niches]]
Sculpture from the temple is largely fragmentary. The larger tablets have depictions of the rain god, or a ruler dressed as the deity, involved in several ritual or mythological scenes. This seems to have been the most important god of the culture as other depictions are found in other places at the site.  His appearance here underlies the significance of this pyramid. The stairway to the temple is adorned on the sides with frets, which are called ''[[xicalcoliuhqui]]''. It is thought to symbolize lightning and while it is common in Mesoamerica, it is a very prominent motif here. These frets were probably painted blue as they were on other buildings, where remains of paint have been found. At the top of the stairway were probably two large three-dimensional stelae. One has survived mostly intact and is now in the site museum.  Off the stairs and leading east from the pyramid are large round stone with holes in the middle, in which were probably placed banners. The interior of the pyramid is rocks and earth. This fill is strained between the sloping walls which become the [[talud-tablero|taluds]] of each level of the pyramid. Buried under all of this is a smaller stricter with taluds but no niches.&lt;ref name="wilkerson31"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=31  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pyramid is flanked by two smaller structures named Building 2 and Building 4. Both are small temple-like platforms. Building 4 contains a smaller, older structure inside it that may be among the earliest structures at the site.&lt;ref name="wilkerson3233"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |pages=32–33  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tajin Chico===
Tajin Chico is a multilevel portion of the site that stretches north-northwest from the older parts of the city up a hill. Much of this section was created by using massive amounts of landfill. It is an immense [[acropolis]] composed of numerous palaces and other civil structures. There are relatively few temples here. It is also more easily defended than other parts of the city.&lt;ref name="wilkerson3637"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |pages=36–37  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tajin Chico is so named because it was initially thought to be a separate but related site. It is now known that it belonged to the center of the city. However, as the term was already in the literature about the site, it has stuck.&lt;ref name="wilkerson16"/&gt;
[[File:BldgC2TChico.JPG|thumb|Building C]]
'''Building C''' was not a temple but its function is not entirely clear. Nearby buildings A and B were palaces. It is probably that this building was used by priests or rulers to receive visitors, petitioners and others.&lt;ref name="wilkerson36"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=36  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The roof of Building C was more than {{convert|1600|sqft|m2}} in size and covered two rooms on the west side as well as main room which opened to the east through five piers.  The entire exterior of the building is covered in stepped frets, with these frets arranged to give the appearance as niches. To further this effect, the inside of the frets were painted dark red and the exterior portion light blue, similar to [[turquoise]]. The broad eastern stairway was also painted with cloud-like [[scrollwork|scroll motifs]].&lt;ref name="wilkerson39"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=39  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BuildingBTChico.JPG|thumb|left|Building B]]
'''Building B''' is a two story structure that was used as a residence and classified as a palace. Like other structures nearby, its roof is a thick slab of cement and there is another slab that separates the ground and upper floors. The entrance to the building from the plaza was through a divided stairway, leading to a single room {{convert|32|by|24|ft|m}} in size. This space is broken by six stone and cement pillars which support the floor above. These columns were thickened over time as it became apparent to have stronger bracing for the weight of the two floors.&lt;ref name="wilkerson45"/&gt; The upper story is reached by narrow stairway. This floor is more spacious even though there are columns here as well. This is the only multistoried palace found outside the Mayan areas.&lt;ref name="wilkerson4647"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |pages=46–47  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BuildingATChico.JPG|thumb|Building A]]
'''Building A''' has two levels, stepped frets and niches and is reminiscent of structures found in the Yucatán. However, the lower level of the building is not rooms but a solid base. The lower level is adorned with large rectangular panels which appear to have been painted red. The entrance is on the south side of the building and is quite elaborate.&lt;ref name="wilkerson48"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=48  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The upper level contains a corridor that goes all the way around and a number of rooms.  The upper level was adorned with stepped frets and scrolls as well. These were painted yellow, blue, red and black. The panels inside were painted with murals, of which only fragments survive. At the east and west side of the corridors are entrances to the rooms, two interconnected rooms on each side of the building.&lt;ref name="wilkerson49"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=49  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Building A is constructed over older buildings that were buried when this area was filled in, some aspects of the building, like the buttresses been damage due to settling where there are no buildings below. The facade depicts a false stairway and [[balustrade]]s of stepped frets capped by niches.  It is unknown if the similarity between this building and the Pyramid of the Niches indicates a relationship between the two.  The false stairs were originally adorned with scroll motifs done in blue and yellow paint, but very little remains.  At the center of the false stairway are true stairs leading upwards under an arch to the first level of the palace.&lt;ref name="wilkerson48"/&gt;
[[File:Column1BldgColumnsTajin.JPG|thumb|100px|left|Fragments from one of the columns]]
The '''Building of the Columns''' dominates the highest portion of Tajin Chico. It is part of one of the last building complexes built at El Tajín. These buildings are situated on a platform-terrace with was formed on natural contours and filled in spaces. The other structure on this platform is called the Annex or the Building of the Tunnels, as it is connected to the Building of the Columns by a passageway. Behind these buildings is a large plaza with small low structures on its edges.&lt;ref name="wilkerson50"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=50  }}&lt;/ref&gt; This building is named for the columns that adorned the east facade of the structure. The columns were made by stacking circles cut from flagstone. Then the surface of the columns was sculpted with scenes celebrating a ruler named 13 Rabbit, who probably had this structure built. Most of the remains of these columns are on display at the site museum. This structure also had a cement roof, which was arched in the “porch” area between the columns and the inner rooms. There is an inner courtyard and ornately decorated, with stepped frets, other symbols in stone and cement which were painted. This complex was one of the last to be built and it also shows evidence if fire and other damage from the fall of the city.&lt;ref name="wilkerson51"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=51  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:GrandXicalco1.JPG|thumb|Great Xicalcoluihqui]]
Just east of Tajin Chico is an area of valley floor. There are numerous buildings in this section but many are not accessible to visitors due to the lack of trails and many have yet to be explored.  Two have been partially explored. The first is the '''Great Xicalcoluihqui''', or the Great Enclosure. This is a wall, which from above forms a giant stepped fret and encloses about {{convert|129000|sqft|m2}}. This structure is unique among Mesoamerican sites and contains two or three small ballcourts. The sides of the enclosure are formed by a slender platform with sloping sides and free standing niches, resembling the Pyramid of the Niches.  There are more than a hundred niches in this wall, broken up by a number of entrances.  The other structure is the '''Great Ballcourt''', the largest court at El Tajin. It is located at the northwest corner of the Great Xicalcoluihqui and at the base of Tajin Chico. It has vertical sides and is about {{convert|213|ft|m}} long. Unlike other ballccourts, there are no carved panels and no sculptures have been associated with this structure.&lt;ref name="wilkerson41"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=41  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Buildings 3, 23, 15 and 5===
[[File:BlueTemple1Tajin.JPG|thumb|Blue Temple]]
Building 3 or the '''Blue Temple''' has some features that set it apart from other pyramids at the site. Except for six benches on the staircase and at the top of the balustrades, probably later additions, there are no niches. The seven stories of the pyramid are composed of gently sloping walling divided into panels of varying widths. The unreconstructed north side has a large indentation made by looters before the site was protected by guards. No sculpture is known to have come from this building and nothing of the temple at the top remains. The building was covered in cement several times over its history, and each layer of this cement was painted in blue rather than the more common red. Remnants of this paint can be seen on part of the stairway and on the side facing east toward Building 23. Blue is most often associated with the rain god but there is no other evidence to support this.&lt;ref name="wilkerson5355"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |pages=53–55  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

While the Blue Temple was a fairly early construction, the pyramid next to it, '''Building 23''' was built very late in Tajin’s history.  It consists of five stories in near vertical talud without niches. The original staircase was destroyed then reworked into its present form. The divider in the center is a buttress to hold the fill behind the stairs in place. The stairs are made from a mixture of [[lime mortar|lime]], sand and clay without a stone core. The interior of the building is composed of loose stone, mostly rounded river boulders. At the top, there the temple was located, is a series of stepped [[merlon]]s which look like medieval European battlements.&lt;ref name="wilkerson5556"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |pages=55–56  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Just south of Buildings 3 and 23 is '''Building 15''', which is only partially excavated.  It faces west and appears to have a civil function much like Building C in Tajín Chico. It has stairways on both the east and west sides that lead to the top of the second level. The third story begins with a wall of niches and no visible stairs. The two lower levels are adorned with larger niches as is the top of the stairway divider. Beneath the larger niches is a line of seven panels. Under the fourth panel, an older panel was found. Deeper excavation found an older, damaged structure which was covered over by the visible structure.  This building is thought to the last built with niches.&lt;ref name="wilkerson57"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=57  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Ruins of El Tajín 2.jpg|thumb|View of Building 5]]
'''Building 5''' is considered to be the stateliest of the El Tajin site. While located next to the Pyramid of the Niches, its visual appeal is not lost to its more famous neighbor. It is located in the center of a pyramid complex and consists of a truncated pyramid rising from a platform that is over {{convert|32000|sqft|m2}} in size. Access to the first level of the pyramid, which is lined with niches, is via a single staircase on the west side or a double staircase on the east side. Access to the top of the pyramid, where the temple once stood, is via a double staircase on the east side.  The top of the pyramid contains two platforms, both of which are decorated with stepped frets. Between the two sets of staircases on the first level on the east side is a tall column-line sculpture. It had been thrown down from the top of the pyramid in ancient times and broken. Archeologists reassembled it at the spot in which it was found. The sculpture is similar in style to the carved stone yokes of Veracruz. The figure seems to be an allegorical representation of a seated figure with a severed upper torso and a skull for a head. The arms are holding a serpent like form and the body contains scrolls, which may signify sacrificial blood. The small buildings that surround this pyramid are meant to compliment it. However, the one on the northeast side has been completely destroyed due to centuries-old trail that was used when this area was still jungle.&lt;ref name="wilkerson5860"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |pages=58–60  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The North and South Ballcourts===
[[File:NorthBallCourtLookingEast.JPG|thumb|View of North Ball Court]]
The '''North Ballcourt''' is constructed by three layers of large flagstones. There are six carved panels with ritual scenes and an ornamental frieze that runs along both walls.  The court is {{convert|87|ft|m}} long, which is considered to be unusually small and has vertical rather than sloping walls. It is probably one of the oldest structures at Tajín.&lt;ref name="wilkerson34"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=34  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Portions of the panels and friezes are worn to the point that large areas are incomplete. The four end panels have scenes relating to the ritual of the ball game that result in entreaties to the gods. The central panels depict the gods responding or performing a ritual of their own. Variant forms of the god of pulque appear over each of the end panels, suggesting that the drink was an important part of the ritual. The southeast, east and northwest panels show a ruler on a throne. The southwest panel has a figure dressed as an eagle seated in a vat of liquid, probably pulque, and being fed by a female figure on the left and a male on the right. The deteriorated north central panel shows two cross-legged figures facing each other. One is seated on a throne and the other by a pulque vat. In the center are two intertwined serpents which seem to form the shape of a tlaxmalactl or ball game marker. The friezes running along the upper edges of the court are composed of interlocking scroll figures, each containing a central element of a head and an eye. Many have feathered headdresses and reptilian attributes and a few are human like.&lt;ref name="wilkerson35"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=35  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SBCLookingEastTajin.JPG|thumb|View of South Ball Court]]
The '''South Ballcourt''', like the North Ball court, has only vertical walls which are sculpted. The sculpted panels on these walls remain largely intact and show in step-by-step fashion  how the ball game was played here, complete with ceremonies, sacrifice and the response of the gods.  The court has a general east-west alignment and is {{convert|198|ft|m}} long and {{convert|34.5|ft|m}} wide. Spectators could watch events from Building 5 to the north and Building 6 to the south as well as from stands built on one side of the court.  The court is made of stones of up to ten tons in weight many of which came from outside the valley. Once the court walls were built six panels were sculpted at the corners and centers of the two walls. The panels on the ends show scenes from the ballgame itself and the center panels show responses from the gods.&lt;ref name="wilkerson61"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=61  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The southeast panel illustrates the opening ritual when the principal participant is elaborately dressed and is being handed a bundle of spears. This is part of an initial activity before the game itself starts. Overlooking this scene is the death deity who rises from a vat of liquid, perhaps pulque. The glyphs above the deity identify it with the planet Venus.  Next is the southwest panel in which a different ceremonial preparation is depicted. The principal participant is supine on a kind of a sofa. Two musicians are playing a turtle shell drum and clay rattles. A figure dressed as an eagle dances in front while a skeletal deity flies above and the death deity rises from liquid. The northwest panel shows the beginning of the ballgame. Two participants are standing in the center of the court with speech scrolls emerging from their mouths. One holds a large knife in his left hand and gestures with his right. Between them are intertwined slashes, the symbol of the ballgame and a ball. At their waists are the protective and ritual accoutrements which are very similar to the stone yokes, palmas and hachas common in elite burials. Behind the players are two figures, one with a deer head, who are watching from the court walls as well as the death deity again above. The northeast panel indicates that the game has been played and one of the participants is about to be sacrificed by having his head cut off. The three figures are all dressed in the garments and symbols of the ballgame. The center figure has his arms held back by the one on the left. The figure on the right holds a large knife which is at the center figure’s neck.  There are scrolls indicating speech from the sacrifice as well as a depiction of the skeletal god.&lt;ref name="wilkerson62"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=62  }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:BeheadingPanelSBCTajin.JPG|thumb|left|Panel showing ballplayer being beheaded]]
After this point, the panels deal with the response of the gods. The north central panel represents the continuation of the ritual in the afterlife, and shows how the events of the game connect the society of El Tajin to the gods. At the center of the scene is a temple with the rain and wind gods seated on top and a vat of liquid within. The sacrificed player appears here, whole and with a pot under his arm. He points to the vat and addresses the rain god. The liquid is protected by a reclining [[chacmool]], who is speaking.  What is being requested is pulque, indicated by a [[glyph]] indicating the mythical origin of the drink and a split image of the god of pulque above the scene. On the south central panel is depicting a scene after the sacrificed ball player has received the pulque with the same temple, glyphs and depiction of the pulque god. The differences are a depiction of the moon as a rabbit, the rain god in front of the temple and the level of the liquid in the vat lowered. The rain god is shown in a rite of auto sacrifice running a spike through part of his penis. The blood falls into the vat and to refill it with pulque.&lt;ref name="wilkerson69"&gt;{{cite book |title= El Tajin: A Guide for Visitors   |last= Wilkerson |first= S. Jeffery K.   |year=1987 |isbn=968-499-293-9  |page=69  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Cumbre Tajín event==
The Cumbre Tajin is an annual artistic and cultural festival which is held at the site in March. The Cumbre Tajin is considered to be an identity festival of the Totonacs, who are considered to be the guardians of El Tajín. Events include those traditional to the Totonac culture as well as modern arts and events from cultures from as far as Tibet. Some of the events include musical concerts, experiencing a ''[[temazcal]]'', theatrical events and visiting El Tajin at night, with a total over 5,000 activities.&lt;ref name="rreyes"/&gt; Many of the cultural, craft and gastronomic events occur at the adjacent Parque Takilhsukut which just located just outside the archeological site.&lt;ref name="acruz"&gt;{{cite news |title= La Cumbre Tajín no dañará la ciudad sagrada, recalcan |first= Arturo |last= Cruz Bárcenas |url= http://www.jornada.unam.mx/2008/03/16/index.php?section=espectaculos&amp;article=a08n1esp |newspaper=La Jornada |location=Mexico City |date=2008-03-16 |accessdate=2010-02-09 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Cumbre Tajin will not damage the sacred city, they emphasize }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, 160,000 attended the event which featured [[Fito Páez]], [[Ximena Sariñana]] and [[Los Tigres del Norte]]. Thirty percent of the revenue the event generates goes toward scholarships for Totonaca youth.&lt;ref name="rreyes"/&gt;

In 2009, the event added the Encuentro Internacional de Voladores (International Encounter of Voladores). For five days, voladores from various places perform at the poles erected at the site. The objective is not only to see the different costumes and styles of the groups but to share experiences about the fertility ritual. Voladores come from as far as [[San Luis Potosi]] and [[Guatemala]].&lt;ref name="rreyes"/&gt;

The Cumbre Tajín has been criticized for its emphasis on modern shows rather than on cultural events. One criticism is the illumination of pyramids at night without any kind of cultural historical instruction. The criticism is that it disrespects the site and the Totonac people. There are also fears that large numbers of visitors to the site for events such as concerts by names such as [[Alejandra Guzmán]] damage the site.&lt;ref name="acruz"/&gt; However, the Centro de Artes Indígenas de Veracruz states that it works very hard to preserve and promote Totonac culture through the event, sponsoring events such as traditional cooking, painting and the ritual of the Voladores.&lt;ref name="agenciareforma"&gt;{{cite news |title= Impulsan en 'Tajín' expresión indígena |url= http://www.elsiglodetorreon.com.mx/noticia/419407.impulsan-en-tajin-expresion-indigena.html |agency=Agencia Reforma |newspaper=El Siglo de Torreon |location=Torreon, Coahuila, Mexico |date=2009-03-09 |accessdate=2010-02-09 |language=Spanish |trans-title=Pushing for indigenous expression at "Tajin" }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are nine main '''ethnolinguistic groups in the Cordilleras'''. The [[Cordillera Administrative Region|Cordillera Region]] is located in Luzon and is the largest region in the Philippines. It has a distinct culture from the rest of the country and each town has its own dialect.

[[File:Ph cordillera.png|framed|right|Map of Cordillera Administrative Region]]

==Bontocs==

The Bontoc ethnolinguistic group can be found in the central and east portions of the Mountain Province. It mainly consists of the Balangaos and Gaddangs, with a significant portion who identify as part of the Kalinga group. The Bontoc live in a mountainous territory, particularly close to the Chico River and its tributaries.

Mineral resources ([[gold]], [[copper]], [[limestone]], [[gypsum]]) can be found in the mountain areas. Gold in particular has been traditionally extracted from the Bontoc municipality. The [[Chico River (Philippines)|Chico River]] provides sand, gravel and white clay, while the forests of Barlig and Sadanga within the area have rattan, bamboo and pine trees.

Bontocs have three different indigenous housing structures: the residence place of the family (''katyufong''), the dormitories for females (''olog''), and the dormitories for males (''ato''/''ator''). Different structures are mostly associated with agricultural needs, such as granaries and pigpens. [[File:Bontoc.jpg|thumb|150px|left|A Bontoc man]] Traditionally, all structures have ''inatep'', cogon grass roofs. Bontoc houses also have numerous utensils, tools, and weapons: like cooking tools; agricultural tools like bolos, trowels, and plows, bamboo or rattan fish traps; and battleaxes, knives, and spears for battle.

Music is also important to Bontoc life, and is usually played during ceremonies. Songs and chants are accompanied by nose flutes, gongs, bamboo mouth organ, and Jew’s harp. Wealthy families make use of jewelry, which are commonly made of gold, glass, agate, or shells, to show their status.

The Bontoc take pride in their kinship ties and oneness as a group (''sinpangili'') based on affiliations, history together against intruders, and community rituals for agriculture and matters which affect the entire province, like natural disasters. Kinship groups have two main functions: controlling property and regulating marriage. However, they are also important for the mutual cooperation of the group’s members.

There are generally three social classes in Bontoc society, the ''kakachangyan'' (rich), the ''wad-ay ngachanna'' (middle-class), and the ''lawa'' (poor).

Anthropologists believe that the Bontoc descended from Indonesian and Malay immigrants, however Bontocs believe that they have lived in their present area since time immemorial. Today, they are distributed all over the Philippines. They are the second largest group in the [[Mountain Province]].

==Ibaloi==

The Ibaloi group inhabits the southeastern part of Benguet Province. The area is rich in mineral resources like [[copper]], [[gold]], [[pyrite]], and [[limestone]]. Plants and animals are also abundant in the forests and mountain areas, and there is an extensive water system that includes the [[Bued]], [[Agno River|Agno]], and [[Amburaya]]n rivers. [[Mount Pulag]], the second highest mountain of the Philippines, is found in their territory and is a culturally important area as well, considered the place where spirits join their ancestors.

The Ibaloi are distributed in the mountain valleys and settlements. Their language is called either ''Inibaloi'' or ''Nabaloi''. Their ancestors are likely to have originated from the [[Lingayen Gulf|Lingayen]] and [[Ilocos]] coasts, who then migrated into the Southern Cordillera range before settling.

The Ibaloi have a rich material culture, most notably their [[mummification]] process, which makes use of saltwater to prevent organ decomposition. Pounded guava and patani leaves are applied to the corpse to prevent maggot or worm infestation while the body dries, the process taking anywhere from two months to even a year until the body is hardened.

The Ibaloi build their houses near their farms. These are usually built on stilts and contain only one room with no windows. Pine trees are usually used to build the houses, especially for wealthy families, while bark bamboo and cogon grass are used by the poor. For cooking, they use pots are made of copper, and food compartments and utensils made of wood. Baskets and coconut husks are also used as containers. Traditional weapons of the Ibalois are the spear, shield, bow and arrow, and war club, though they are rarely used in present times. The Ibaloi also employ cutting tools like knives, farm tools, and complete pounding implements for rice: mortars (round or rectangular, for different purposes) and numerous pestles, carved from sturdy tree trunks and pine branches.

Music is also important among the Ibaloi, with the Jew’s harp, nose flute, native guitar, bamboo striking instruments, drums, gongs, and many others. They are considered sacred, and must always be played for a reason.

Older Ibaloi people may have tattooed arms as a sign of prestige.

==Ikalahans==

The Ikalahan is a small group distributed amongst the mountain ranges of [[Sierra Madre (Philippines)|Sierra Madre]], the [[Caraballo]], and the eastern part of the Cordillera mountain range. The main population resides in the [[Nueva Vizcaya]] province, with Kayapa as the center. They are considered to be part of the [[Igorot]] (mountain people) but distinguish themselves with the name Ikalahan, the name taken from the forest trees that grow in the Caraballo Mountain.

They are among the least studied ethnic groups, thus their early history is unknown, however studies by Keesing (1962) suggests that, like other groups in the mountains, they fled from the lowlands to escape Spanish persecution. Rice (1974) however says that, according to Kalahan literature and language, they may have descended from Proto-Benguet people from the southern end of the Cordillera Mountain ranges.

Ikalahan proudly embrace their culture with its strong family ties and association with the forest, and modern Ikalahan are known for their community-based management of forests.  Like many indigenous groups, they face the threat of losing their ancestral lands to commercial developments.

Ikalahan started out as hunter-gatherers, but now practice swidden (“slash-and-burn”) farming, with especially developed technology for the production of their staple food, [[camote]], and of [[ginger]]. These technologies are supported by their customs. Originally they only lived together in small groups of houses, but now gather in larger residential communities in order to facilitate children’s education. Many now reside in the [[Kalahan reserve]], with the Imugan community the largest.

Ikalahan houses, traditionally made for one [[nuclear family]], have of reeds (''pal-ot'') or cogon for roofs, barks or slabs of trees for the walls, and palm strips for the floor. The houses are traditionally rectangular and raised from the ground, with one main room for general activities and few or no windows. There is usually a separate room for visitors or single family members only, opposite the kitchen area. Shelves keep household utensils, including wooden bowls and camote trays made of rattan. Camote peelings or rejects are fed to the pigs, which are herded under the living area or in a sty near the house.

The Ikalahan, like many ethnic groups, enjoy using musical instruments in celebration, most of which are made out of bamboo. Gongs are the primary instruments used, and are complemented by drums. They also use a native guitar, or ''galdang'', and a vibrating instrument called the ''pakgong'' played by striking.

For clothing, Ikalahan men wear a loincloth or [[G-string]], and carry backpacks made out of deer hide. Men almost always carry a bolo when leaving the house. Women wear woven skirts around the waist, made up of flaps of different color combinations. They wear a blouse from the same material.

==Ifugaos==
[[File:Banaue Rice Terraces.jpg|350px|thumbnail|right|Banaue Rice Terraces]]
Ifugaos, commonly known as Igorots in Filipino, are an ethnolinguistic group majorly found in [[Ifugao]] province, which is located in the heart of Cordillera. The province is one of the smallest provinces in the Philippines with an area of only 251,778 hectares, or about 0.8% of the total Philippine land area. It has a temperate climate and is rich in mineral and forest products. It is also famous for its [[Banaue Rice Terraces]] which became one of the main tourist attractions in the country.

The term ''Igorot'' or ''Ygolote'' was the term used by Spanish conquerors for mountain people. The Ifugaos, however, prefer the name ''Ifugao'' which came from the word ''ipugo''(''human beings'' in English). Although majority of them already converted to [[Roman Catholic]] from their original animistic religion, from their mythology, they believed that they descended from Wigan and Bugan, who are the children of Bakkayawan and Bugan of the Skyworld (''Kabunyan''). Scholars, however, have differing theories about the true origin of Ifugaos. The two most prevailing theories are that they either came from the Magat area because of the Spanish military penetration there before, or from the western Mountain Province if you base it on the similarities of their language and culture. The Ifugao popular epic, ''The Hudhud of Dinulawan'' and ''Bugan of Gonhadan'', however, favors the theory that they came from the Magat Area.

As of 1995, the population of the Ifugaos was counted to be 131,635. Although the majority of them are still in Ifugao province, some of them already transferred to [[Baguio City]], where they worked as woodcarvers, and to other parts of the Cordillera region.

They are divided into subgroups based on the differences in dialects, traditions, and design/color of costumes. The main subgroups are Ayangan, Kalangaya, and Tuwali. Furthermore, the Ifugao society is divided into 3 social classes: the ''kadangyans'' or the aristocrats, the ''tagus'' or the middle class, and the ''nawotwots'' or the poor ones. The ''kadangyans'' sponsor the prestige rituals called ''hagabi'' and ''uyauy'' and this separates them from the ''tagus'' who cannot sponsor feasts but are economically well off. The ''nawotwots'' are those who have limited land properties and are usually hired by the upper classes to do work in the fields and other services.

The Ifugaos host a number of similarities with the Bontocs in terms of agriculture, but the Ifugao tend to have more scattered settlements, and recognize their affiliation mostly towards direct kin in households closer to their fields &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Cordillera: Diversity in Culture Change, Social Anthropology of  Hill People in Northern Luzon, Philippines|last = Goda|first = Toh|publisher = New Day Publishers|year = 2001|isbn = |location = Quezon City, Philippines|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

From a person’s birth to his death, the Ifugaos follow a lot of traditions. ''Pahang'' and ''palat di oban'' are performed to a mother to ensure safe delivery. After delivery, no visitors are allowed to enter the house until ''among'' is performed when the baby is given a name. ''Kolot'' and ''balihong'' are then performed to ensure the health and good characteristics of the boy or the girl, respectively. As they grow older, they sleep in exclusive dormitories because it is considered indecent for siblings of different genders to sleep in the same house. The men are the ones who hunt, recite myths, and work in the fields. Women also work in the fields, aside from managing the homes and reciting ballads. Betrothals are also common, especially among the wealthy class; and like other Filipinos they perform several customs in marriage like ''bubun'' (providing a pig to the woman’s family). Lastly, the Ifugaos don’t mourn for the elderly who dies, as well as for the baby or the mother who died in a conception. This is to prevent the same event from happening again in the family. Also, the Ifugaos believe in life after death so those who are murdered are given a ritual called ''opa'' to force their souls into the place where his ancestors dwell.

==Isnegs==

The Isnegs are native in [[Apayao]] province, which was formerly a sub-province of Mountain Province, but are also found in portions of [[Abra (province)|Abra]], [[Ilocos Norte]], &amp; [[Kalinga (province)|Kalinga]]. Apayao has an area of 397,720 hectares and is typographically divided into two parts: the Upper Apayao that is mountainous, and the Lower Apayao that is generally flat with rolling mountains and plateaus.

In 1923, they were the last ethnic group to be conquered by the American colonialists. Before, they had no collective name. Instead, they referred to themselves based on their residence or whether they lived: upstream (''Imandaya'') or downstream (''Imallod''). At present, they are commonly known as Isnegs, which came from an Ilocano word ''itneg'' that means ''Inhabitants of the Tineg River''. Some of them, however, still call themselves as ''Apayaos''. Majority of them live along the [[Apayao-Abulug River]], [[Matalag River]], and the small rivers on the hillsides of Ilocos Norte and Abra.

Because there was no political or ward system, the kinship groups and family clans became the central social organizations and were usually led by the husbands. [[Polygamy]] is allowed, but depends on the capacity of the husband to support the family. Like other ethnic groups, they also follow a lot of [[taboos]]. These taboos vary from place to place. A pregnant woman, for example, is discouraged to eat some kinds of [[sugarcane]], [[banana]], and the soft meat of sprouting [[coconut]] to have a normal conception. In the past, [[twins]] were also believed to be unlucky, so whenever twins were born, they would let the weaker twin die. Also, if the mother dies upon giving birth, the child is also left to die and is usually buried with the mother. Unlike the [[Ifugaos]], the Isnegs don’t follow rituals on the adolescence of the child. They, however, have rituals on marriage, like the ''amoman'' (or the present-day ''pamamanhikan''), and death, like the ''mamanwa'' which is done by the widowers.

The Isnegs are aesthetically-inclined. In ceremonies, women wear a lot of colourful ornaments and clothings, and men wear G-strings (usually of blue color) and ''bado'' (upper garment). Men don’t wear pendants but they wear an ornament called ''sipattal'', made of shells and beads, used only on special occasions. They also practice tattooing which is done by rubbing soot on the wounds caused by the needles. Furthermore, [[rice]] was their main crop. Fishing was also common as they were living along bodies of water.

==Kalingas==
[[File:Kalinga 5927.JPG|300px|thumbnail|right|Young Kalinga boys]]
The Kalingas are mainly found in [[Kalinga province]] which has an area of 3,282.58 sq.&amp;nbsp;km. Some of them, however, already migrated to [[Mountain Province]], [[Apayao]], [[Cagayan]], and [[Abra (province)|Abra]]. As of 1995, they were counted to be 105,083, not including those who have migrated outside the Cordillera region.

The name ''Kalinga'' came from the Ibanag and Gaddang term ''kalinga'', which means ''headhunter''. They can be divided into three sub-cultures and geographical position: Balbalan (north); Pasil, Lubuagan, and Tinglayan (south); and Tanudan (east). They can also be divided based on their dialects: Guinaang, Lubuagan, Punukpuk, Tabuk, Tinglayan, and Tanudan.

Like other ethnic groups, families and kinship systems are also important in the social organizations of Kalingas. They are, however, stratified into two economic classes only which are determined by the number of their rice fields, working animals, and heirlooms: the ''kapos'' (poor) and the ''baknang'' (wealthy). Politically, the ''mingol'' and the ''papangat'' have the highest status. The ''mingols'' are those who have killed many in headhunting and the ''papangats'' are those former ''mingols'' who assumed leadership after the disappearance of headhunting. They are usually the peacemakers, and the people ask advice from them, so it is important that they are wise and have good oratorical ability.

Like the other ethnic groups, they also follow a lot of customs and traditions. For example, pregnant women and their husbands are not allowed to eat [[beef]], cow’s milk, and dog meat. They must also avoid streams and waterfalls as these cause harm to unborn children. Other notable traditions are the ''ngilin'' (period of restriction of household activities after the birth of the child) and the ''kontad'' (ritual performed to the child to avoid harms in the future). Betrothals are also common, even as early as birth, but one may break this engagement if he/she is not in favour of it. Upon death, sacrifices are also made in honour of the spirit of the dead and ''kolias'' is celebrated after one year of mourning period. The Kalingas, along with the Bontocs, the Kankana-ey, and the Ifugao follow the system of ''tayan'', which relates to the heredity of communal property, or lands. They are also known for building their houses on treetops,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = On the Cordilleras: A look at the peoples and cultures of the Mountain Province|last = Scott|first = William Henry|publisher = MCS Enterprises, Inc|year = 1996|isbn = |location = 884 Nicanor Reyes, Manila, Philippines|pages = 16}}&lt;/ref&gt; for the use of swidden farming, and for the uniquely shaped Kalinga head ax, which was used both as a weapon and a farming implement.

Kalinga men wear ''ba-ag'' (loincloths) while the women wear ''saya'' (colourful garment covering the waist down to the feet). The women are also tattooed on their arms up to their shoulders and wear colourful ornaments like bracelets, earrings, and necklaces, especially on the day of festivities.

==Northern Kankana-eys==

The Northern Kankana-eys live in [[Sagada]] and [[Besau]], west of Mountain province, and whom [[Dr. H. Otley Beyer]] believed to have originated from a migrating group from Asia who landed on the coasts of [[Pangasinan]] before moving to Cordillera. The Northern Kankana-eys are tall and well proportioned, have a more aquiline nose, lighter skin color and are quick on their feet. Their smallest social unit is the ''sinba-ey'', which includes the father, mother and child. The ''sinba-eys'' make up the ''dap-ay''/''ebgan'' which is the ward. Their society is divided into two classes: the ''kadangyan'' (rich), who are the leaders and who inherit their power through lineage or intermarriage, and the ''kado'' (poor).

The Northern Kankana-eys believe in many supernatural beliefs and omens, and in gods and spirits like the ''anito'' (soul of the dead) and nature spirits.

They also have various rituals, such as the rituals for courtship and marriage and death and burial. The courtship and marriage process of the Northern Kankana-eys starts with the man visiting the woman of his choice and serenading her using an ''awiding'' (harp) or a [[nose flute]]. If the parents agree to their marriage, they exchange work for a day, i.e. the man brings logs or bundled firewood as a sign of his sincerity, the woman works on the man’s father’s field with a female friend. They then undergo the preliminary marriage ritual (''pasya'') and exchange food. Then comes the marriage celebration itself (''dawak''/''bayas'')inclusive of the ''segep'' (which means ''to enter''), ''pakde'' (sacrifice), ''betbet'' (butchering of pig for omens), ''playog''/''kolay'' (marriage ceremony proper), ''tebyag'' (merrymaking), ''mensupot'' (gift giving), ''sekat di tawid'' (giving of inheritance), and ''buka''/''inga'' (last leg of the marriage ritual). The married couple cannot separate once a child is born, and [[adultery]] is forbidden in their society as it is believed to bring misfortune and illness upon the adulterer. On the other hand, the Northern kankana-eys honor their dead by keeping vigil and performing the rituals ''sangbo'' (offering of pigs and 3 ducks), ''baya-o'' (singing of a dirge by three men), ''menbaya-o'' (elegy) and ''sedey'' (offering of pig). They finish off the burial ritual with ''dedeg'' (song of the dead), and then, the sons and grandsons carry the body to its resting place.

The Northern Kankana-eys have rich material culture among which is the four types of houses: the ''inhagmang'', ''binang-iyan'', ''tinokbobo'' and ''tinabla''. Their men wear rectangular woven cloths wrapped around their waist to cover the buttocks and the groin. The women wear native woven skirts that cover their lower body from waist to knees and is held by a thick belt (''bagket'').

Their household is sparsely furnished with only a ''bangkito''/''tokdowan'', ''po-ok'' (small box for storage of rice and wine), clay pots, and ''sokong'' (carved bowl). Their baskets are made of woven [[rattan]] and come in various shapes and sizes.

The Kankana-eys have three main weapons, the bolo (''ganig''), the axe (''wasay'') and the spear (''balbeg''), which they previously used to kill with but now serve practical purposes in their livelihood. They also developed tools for more efficient way of doing their work like the ''saged'' (harrow), ''alado'' ([[plow]] dragged by [[carabao]]), ''sinowan'' and ''kagitgit'' (for digging).

For a living, the Northern Kankana-eys take part in barter and trade in kind, agriculture (usually on [[terrace (agriculture)|terraces]]), camote/[[sweet potato]] farming, slash-and-burn/swidden farming, hunting, fishing and food gathering, handicraft and other cottage industry. They have a simple political life and are governed by ''Dap-ay''/''abong'' and experience a certain degree of autonomy. The council of elders, known as the ''Amam-a'', are a group of old, married men expert in custom law and lead in the decision-making for the village.Through time the village has maintained a perfect balance between modern and traditional way of living. The modifications on the culture of the Northern Kankana-eys were brought about the interaction with other villages with different customs and the trade relations with the lowland traders. There is also some external influence from the arrival of missionaries bringing Anglican and Pentecostal religions, towards which some have converted. Despite the modifications, the culture of the Northern Kankana-eys remain vibrant and alive.

==Southern Kankana-eys==

Originally from [[Banao]] and [[Ampontoc]], the Southern Kankana-eys are one of the ethnolinguistic groups in the Cordillera. They live in the mountainous regions of Mountain Province and [[Benguet]], more specifically in the municipalities of [[Tidian]], [[Bauko]], [[Sabangan]], [[Bakun, Benguet|Bakun]], [[Kibungan]] and [[Mankayan]]. They are predominantly a nuclear family type (''sinbe-ey''), which are either patri-local or matri-local, composed of the husband, wife and their children. The kinship group of the Southern Kankana-eys consists of his descent group and, once he is married, his affinal kinsmen. Their society is divided into two social classes based primarily on the ownership of land: The rich (''baknang'') and the poor (''abiteg''). The ''baknang'' are the primary landowners to whom the ''abiteg'' render their services to. The Mankayan Kankana-eys, however, has no clear distinction between the ''baknang'' and the ''abiteg'' and all have equal access to resources such as the [[copper]] and [[gold]] mines.

Contrary to popular belief, the Southern Kankana-eys do not worship idols and images. The carved images in their homes only serve decorative purposes. They believe in the existence of deities, the highest among which is ''Adikaila'' of the Skyworld whom they believe created all things. Next in the hierarchy is the ''Kabunyan'', who are the gods and goddesses of the Skyworld. They also believe in the spirits of ancestors (''ap-apo'') and the earth spirits they call ''anito''. They are very superstitious and believe that performing rituals and ceremonies help deter misfortunes and calamities. Some of these rituals are ''pedit'' (to bring good luck to newlyweds), ''pasang'' (cure sterility and sleeping sickness, particularly drowsiness) and ''pakde'' (cleanse community from death-causing evil spirits).

The Southern Kankana-eys have a long process for courtship and marriage which starts when the man makes his intentions of marrying the woman known to her. Next is the ''sabangan'', when the couple makes their wish to marry known to their family.The man offers firewood to the father of the woman, while the woman offers firewood to the man’s father. The parents then talk about the terms of the marriage, including the bride price to be paid by the man’s family. On the day of the marriage, the relatives of both parties offer gifts to the couple, and a pig is butchered to have its bile inspected for omens which would show if they should go on with the wedding. The wedding day for the Southern Kankana-eys is an occasion for merrymaking and usually lasts until the next day. Though married, the bride and groom are not allowed consummate their marriage and must remain separated until such a time that they move to their own separate home.

The funeral ritual of the Southern Kankana-eys lasts up to ten days, when the family honors their dead by chanting [[dirges]] and vigils and sacrificing a pig for each day of the vigil. Five days after the burial of the dead, those who participated in the burial take a bath in a river together, butcher a chicken, then offer a prayer to the soul of the dead.

The Southern Kankana-eys have different types of houses among which are ''binang-iyan'' (box-like compartment), ''apa'' or ''inalpa'' (smaller than ''bingang-iyan''), ''inalteb'' (has a gabled roof and shorter eaves allowing for the installation of windows and other opening at the side), ''allao'' (a temporary or casual structure), ''at-ato'' or ''dap-ay'' (long, low gable-roofed structure with only a single door for entrance and exit). Men traditionally wear a G-string (''wanes'') around the waist and between the legs which is tightened at the back. Both ends hang loose at the front and back to provide additional cover. Men also wear a woven blanket for an upper garment and sometimes a headband, usually colored red like the G-string. The women, on the other hand, wear a ''tapis'', a skirt wrapped around to cover from the waist to the knees held together by a belt (''bagket'') or tucked in the upper edges usually color white with occasional dark blue color. As adornments, both men and women wear bead leglets, copper or shell earrings and beads of copper coin. They also sport tattoos which serve as body ornaments and “garments”.

Southern Kankana-eys are economically involved in hunting and foraging (their chief livelihood), agriculture, fishing, animal domestication, trade, mining, weaving and pottery in their day-to-day activities to meet their needs. The leadership structure is largely based on land ownership, thus the more well-off control the community’s resources. The village elders ('''amam-a''') who act as arbiters and jurors have the duty to  settlements between conflicting members of the community, facilitate discussion among the villagers concerning the welfare of the community, and lead in the observance of rituals.

There is no more pure Southern Kankana-ey culture because of culture change that modified the customs and traditions of the people. The socio-cultural changes are largely due to a combination of factors which include the change in the local government system when the Spaniards came, the introduction of Christianity, the education system that widened the perspective of the individuals of the community, and the encounters with different people and ways of life through trade and commerce.

==Tingguans/Itnegs==

The Tingguinians live in the mountainous area of Abra in northwestern Luzon who descended from immigrants from Kalinga, Apayao, and the Northern Kankana-ey. They are large in stature, have mongoloid eyes, aquiline nose, and are effective farmers. They refer to themselves as ''Itneg'', though the Spaniards called them ''Tingguian'' when they came in the Philippines because they are mountain dwellers. The Tingguians are further divided into nine distinct subgroups which are the Adasen, Mabaka, Gubang, Banao, Binongon, Danak, Moyodan, Dawangan, and Ilaud. Wealth and material possessions determine the social standing of a family or person. Despite the divide of social status, there is no sharp distinction between rich and poor. Wealth is inherited but the society is open for social mobility of the citizens by virtue of hard work. Medium is the only distinct group separation in the society but even then it is only during ceremonial periods.

The Itnegs’ marriage are arranged by the parents and are usually between distant relatives in order to keep the family close knit and the family wealth within the kinship group. The parents select a bride for their son when he is six to eight years old, and the proposal is done to the parents of the girl. If accepted, the engagement is sealed by tying beads around the girl’s waist as a sign of engagement. A bride price is also paid to the bride’s family, half during the ''pakalon'' and the rest during the actual wedding. No celebration accompanies the Itneg wedding and the guests leave right after the ceremony.

The Itnegs dress much like the Southern Kankana-eys. The females dress in a wrap-around skirt that reaches to the knees and fastened by an elaborately decorated belt. They also wear short sleeved jacket on special occasions. The men, on the other hand, wear a G-string made of woven cloth (''balibas''). On special occasions, the men also wear a long-sleeved jacket. They also wear a belt where they fasten their knife and a bamboo hat with a low, dome-shaped top. Beads are the primary adornment of the Tingguians and a sign of wealth. Also, tattooing is commonly practiced. The Tingguians have two general types of housing. The first is a 2-3 room-dwelling surrounded by a porch and the other is a one-room house with a porch in front. Their houses are usually made of [[bamboo]] and [[cogon]]. A common feature of a Tingguian home with wooden floors is a corner with bamboo slats as flooring where mothers usually give birth.

The Tingguians use weapons for hunting, headhunting, and building a house, among others. Some examples of their weapons and implements are the lance or spear (''pika''), shield (''kalasag''), head axe (''aliwa''). Foremost among all these weapons and implements is the bolo which the Tangguians are rarely seen without.

The traditional leadership in the Tangguian community is held by ''panglakayen'' (old men), who compose a council of leaders representing each ''purok'' or settlement. The ''panglakayen'' are chosen for their wisdom and eagerness to protect the community’s interest. Agriculture is the dominant activity for the Itnegs in Abra as the landscape is favorable for such trade. Tingguians are also involved in livestock raising, fishing, hunting and foraging, and crafts as source of living.

The Itnegs are religious beings who believe in believe in the existence of numerous supernatural powerful beings. They believe in spirits and deities, the greatest of which they believe to be is Kadaklan who lives up in the sky and who created the earth, the moon, the stars, and the sun. The Itnegs believe in life after death, which is in a place they call ''maglawa''. They take special care to clean and adorn their dead to prepare them for the journey to ''maglawa''.

The Tingguians still practice their traditional ways. Socio-cultural changes started when the [[Spanish conquistadors]] ventured to expand their reach to the settlements of Abra. The Spaniards brought with them their culture some of which the Tangguians borrowed. More changes in their culture took place with the coming of the Americans and the introduction education and catholic and [[Protestant proselytization]].

The '''Ferré Foundation''' was created by don [[Luis A. Ferré]], [[Puerto Rico]]'s first pro-statehood [[governor]], as well as an industrialist and philanthropist.  The foundation is fed by a portion of the revenue of the many businesses founded and owned by Ferré, who died in 2003 at the age of 99. Don Luis, as he was known, founded the [[Museo de Arte de Ponce]], Puerto Rico's foremost art museum,{{citation needed|date=April 2012}} housed in an [[Edward Durrell Stone]]-designed building in [[Ponce, Puerto Rico|Ponce]].  He was also a strong supporter of [[Centro Sor Isolina Ferré]], founded by his sister [[Isolina Ferré]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5959">'''Frege's puzzles''' are puzzles about the [[semantics]] of [[proper name]]s, although related puzzles also arise in the case of [[indexical]]s. [[Gottlob Frege]] (1848–1925) introduced the puzzle at the beginning of his article "Über Sinn und Bedeutung" ("[[On Sense and Reference]]") in 1892 in one of the most influential articles in [[analytic philosophy]] and [[philosophy of language]].

==The puzzles ==

The term "Frege's puzzle" is commonly applied to two related problems.  One is a problem about identity statements that Frege raised at the beginning of "On Sense and Reference", and another concerns propositional attitude reports.&lt;ref&gt;Zalta, Edward N., "[http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/frege/ Gottlob Frege]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' (Fall 2014), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  For the first problem, consider the following two sentences:

(1) [[Hesperus]] is Hesperus.

(2) Hesperus is [[Phosphorus (morning star)|Phosphorus]].

Each of these sentences is true, since 'Hesperus' refers to the same object as 'Phosphorus' (the planet Venus). Nonetheless, (1) and (2) seem to differ in their meaning or what Frege called "cognitive value". (1) is just a truth of logic that can be known [[A priori and a posteriori|a priori]], whereas (2) records an empirical truth that was discovered by astronomers. The problem, however, is that proper names are often taken to have no meaning beyond their reference (a view often associated with [[John Stuart Mill]]). But this seems to imply that the two statements mean the same thing, or have the same cognitive value.&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2017). Lexemes, practs, and those who have yet to decide. Linguistik Online, 81, 77-93.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Salmani Nodoushan, M. A. (2018). Which view of indirect reports do Persian data corroborate? International Review of Pragmatics, 10(1), 76-100. &lt;/ref&gt;

Frege proposed to resolve this puzzle by postulating a second level of meaning besides reference in the form of what he called [[Sense and reference|sense]]: a difference in the mode of presentation or the way an object can be "given" to us.  Thus 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' have the same reference, but differ in sense because they present Venus in different ways.

The second puzzle concerns [[propositional attitude]] reports, such as belief reports.  Ordinarily, coreferring names are substitutable [[salva veritate]], that is, without change in truth value.  For example, if 'Hesperus is bright' is true then 'Phosphorus is bright' is also true given that 'Hesperus' and 'Phosphorus' refer to the same planet.  But now consider the following argument:

(3) Alex believes Hesperus is visible in the evening.

(4) Hesperus = Phosphorus.

(5) Alex believes Phosphorus is visible in the evening.

This argument appears to be [[Validity (logic)|invalid]]: even if (3) and (4) are true, (5) could be false.  If Alex is not aware that Hesperus and Phosphorus are the same planet, then it seems that he could believe that Hesperus is visible in the evening while rejecting the claim that Phosphorus is visible in the evening (perhaps he thinks Phosphorus, the morning star, is only visible in the morning).  The principle that coreferring names are substitutable ''salva veritate'' thus appears to fail in the context of belief reports (and similarly for other propositional attitude reports).

Frege again proposed to solve this problem by appeal to his distinction between sense and reference.  In particular, he held that when a proper name occurs in the context of an attitude report, its reference shifts to its ordinary sense: thus 'Phosphorus', for example, denotes the planet Venus when it occurs in the sentence 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' or in an identity sentence like (4), but when it occurs embedded in an attitude report like (5) it denotes its ordinary ''sense.''

==New theories of reference and the return of Frege's puzzle==

Frege's puzzle has received a great deal of attention since the attacks on the [[descriptivist theory of names]] mounted in the 1970s and 1980s by philosophers such as [[Keith Donnellan]], [[Saul Kripke]], [[Ruth Barcan Marcus]], [[Hilary Putnam]], and [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]].&lt;ref&gt;Cumming, S. "[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/names/ Names]", ''[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]]'' Edward N. Zalta (ed.)&lt;/ref&gt;  In the wake of these attacks on descriptivism, many philosophers embraced the Millian or direct-reference view of proper names, according to which the meaning of a name is simply its referent. As noted above, this Millian view has the result that (1) and (2) express the same proposition.  Similarly, the embedded sentences 'Hesperus is visible in the evening' and 'Phosphorus is visible in the evening' from (3) and (5) express the same proposition.  It therefore looks like (3) and (5) cannot differ in truth value since they attribute belief in one and the same proposition.

In view of this problem, many philosophers of language have attempted to work out a solution to the puzzle within the confines of direct-reference theories of proper names. Some of these philosophers include [[Nathan Salmon]] (e.g. in ''Frege's puzzle'' and ''Content, Cognition, and Communication''), [[Howard Wettstein]] (e.g. in "Has Semantics Rested on a Mistake?"), [[Scott Soames]], [[David Kaplan (philosopher)|David Kaplan]], [[John Perry (philosopher)|John Perry]] (e.g. in ''Reference and Reflexivity''), and [[Joseph Almog]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1997">'''''GIGA Journal Family''''' is a publishing initiative of the [[GIGA German Institute of Global and Area Studies]] that brings together four international area studies journals. It comprises the GIGA journals ''[[Africa Spectrum]]'', ''[[Journal of Current Chinese Affairs]]'', ''[[Journal of Politics in Latin America (JPLA)]]'' and ''[[Journal of Current Southeast Asian Affairs]]'' offering original research and empirical analysis on contemporary politics, society and economy of [[Africa]], [[China]], [[Latin America]] and [[Southeast Asia]].

==Publishing Concept==
The ''GIGA Journal Family'' is funded by the German Research Foundation (Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft, DFG) as a pilot project in [[Open access (publishing)|open-access]] publishing. Since the beginning of 2009 all socio-scientific journals of the GIGA German Institute of Global and Area Studies have been transformed into open-access journals which means their full content is freely online accessible without time delay or cost to the reader. In addition, it remains available in traditional printed format.
To ensure the journals' quality, all essays are evaluated in a double-blind peer-review process.

The American linguist [[Joseph Greenberg]] (1915-2001) proposed a set of [[linguistic universals]] based primarily on a set of 30 languages.  The following list is verbatim from the list printed in the appendix of Greenberg's ''Universals of Language''&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/Korean/Artikel02/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920162920/http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/Korean/Artikel02/ |date=September 20, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and "Universals Restated",&lt;ref&gt;[http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/Korean/Artikel02/Appendix3.html]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080503102258/http://ling.kgw.tu-berlin.de/Korean/Artikel02/Appendix3.html |date=May 3, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Greenberg "Some Universals of Grammar with Particular Reference to the Order of Meaningful Elements," ''Universals of Language'', London: MIT Press, pp. 110-113.&lt;/ref&gt; sorted by context.

'''Note:''' The entries below require additional explanations and notation. The numbering is fixed to keep Greenberg's number associations, as these are commonly referenced by number, for example "Greenberg's linguistic universal number 12."

==Typology==
{{Main|Typology (linguistics)}}
# "In [[declarative sentence]]s with nominal [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] and [[Object (grammar)|object]], the dominant [[word order|order]] is almost always one in which the subject precedes the object."
# "In languages with [[prepositions]], the [[genitive]] almost always follows the governing [[noun]], while in languages with [[postpositions]] it almost always precedes."
# "Languages with dominant [[verb–subject–object|VSO order]] are always [[prepositional]]."
# "With overwhelmingly greater than chance frequency, languages with normal [[subject–object–verb|SOV order]] are [[postposition]]al."
# "If a language has dominant [[subject–object–verb|SOV order]] and the [[genitive]] follows the governing noun, then the [[adjective]] likewise follows the noun."
# "All languages with dominant [[verb–subject–object|VSO order]] have [[subject–verb–object|SVO]] as an alternative or as the only alternative basic order."

==Syntax==
{{Main|Syntax}}
{{Ordered list|start=7
| "If in a language with dominant [[subject–object–verb|SOV order]] there is no alternative basic order, or only [[Object–subject–verb|OSV]] as the alternative, then all adverbial modifiers of the verb likewise precede the verb. (This is the 'rigid' subtype of III.)"
| "When a [[yes-no question]] is differentiated from the corresponding assertion by an [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonation]]al pattern, the distinctive intonational features of each of these patterns are reckoned from the end of the sentence rather than from the beginning."
| "With well more than chance frequency, when question particles or affixes are specified in position by reference to the sentence as a whole, if initial, such elements are found in prepositional languages, and, if final, in postpositional."
| "Question particles or affixes, when specified in position by reference to a particular word in the sentence, almost always follow that word. Such particles do not occur in languages with dominant [[verb–subject–object|order VSO]]."
| "Inversion of statement order so that [[verb]] precedes [[Subject (grammar)|subject]] occurs only in languages where the [[question word|question word or phrase]] is normally initial. This same inversion occurs in yes-no questions only if it also occurs in [[interrogative]] word questions."
| "If a language has dominant [[verb–subject–object|order VSO]] in [[declarative sentence]]s, it always puts [[interrogative]] words or phrases first in interrogative word questions; if it has dominant [[subject–verb–object|order SOV]] in declarative sentences, there is never such an invariant rule.
| "If the nominal [[Object (grammar)|object]] always precedes the [[verb]], then verb forms subordinate to the main verb also precede it."
| "In [[conditional sentence|conditional]] statements, the [[conditional clause]] precedes the conclusion as the normal order in all languages."
| "In expressions of [[volition (linguistics)|volition]] and purpose, a subordinate verbal form always follows the main verb as the normal order except in those languages in which the nominal object always precedes the verb."
| "In languages with dominant [[verb–subject–object|order VSO]], an [[inflection|inflected]] auxiliary always precedes the main verb. In languages with dominant [[subject–verb–object|order SOV]], an inflected auxiliary always follows the main verb."
| "With overwhelmingly more than chance frequency, languages with dominant [[verb–subject–object|order VSO]] have the adjective after the noun."
| "When the descriptive adjective precedes the noun, the demonstrative and the numeral, with overwhelmingly more than chance frequency, do likewise."
| "When the general rule is that the descriptive [[adjective]] follows, there may be a minority of adjectives which usually precede, but when the general rule is that descriptive adjectives precede, there are no exceptions."
| "When any or all of the items ([[demonstrative]], [[numeral (linguistics)|numeral]], and [[descriptive]] adjective) precede the [[noun]], they are always found in that order. If they follow, the order is either the same or its exact opposite."
| "If some or all adverbs follow the adjective they modify, then the language is one in which the qualifying adjective follows the noun and the verb precedes its nominal object as the dominant order."
| "If in comparisons of superiority the only order, or one of the alternative orders, is [[standard-marker-adjective]], then the language is [[postposition]]al. With overwhelmingly more than chance frequency if the only order is [[adjective-marker-standard]], the language is [[preposition]]al."
| "If in apposition the proper noun usually precedes the common noun, then the language is one in which the governing noun precedes its dependent genitive. With much better than chance frequency, if the common noun usually precedes the proper noun, the dependent genitive precedes its governing noun."
| "If the relative expression precedes the noun either as the only construction or as an alternate construction, either the language is postpositional, or the adjective precedes the noun or both."
| "If the [[pronominal]] object follows the verb, so does the nominal object."

== Morphology ==

| "If both the [[derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] and [[inflection]] follow the [[root (linguistics)|root]], or they both precede the root, the derivation is always between the root and the inflection."
| "If a language has inflection, it always has derivation."
| "If the verb has categories of [[person-number]] or if it has categories of [[grammatical gender|gender]], it always has [[tense-mode]] categories."
| "If either the subject or object noun agrees with the verb in gender, then the adjective always agrees with the noun in gender."
| "Whenever the verb agrees with a nominal subject or nominal object in gender, it also agrees in number."
| "When number agreement between the noun and verb is suspended and the rule is based on order, the case is always one in which the verb precedes and the verb is in the singular."
| "No language has a [[trial number]] unless it has a [[dual (grammatical number)|dual]]. No language has a dual unless it has a [[plural]]."
| "There is no language in which the plural does not have some nonzero [[allomorph]]s, whereas there are languages in which the singular is expressed only by zero. The dual and the trial are almost never expressed only by zero."
| "If a language has the category of gender, it always has the category of number."
| "A language never has more gender categories in nonsingular numbers than in the singular."
| "Where there is a case system, the only case which ever has only zero allomorphs is the one which includes among its meanings that of the subject of the intransitive verb."
| "Where [[morpheme]]s of both number and case are present and both follow or both precede the noun base, the expression of number almost always comes between the noun base and the expression of case."
| "When the [[adjective]] follows the noun, the adjective expresses all the [[inflection]]al categories of the noun. In such cases the noun may lack overt expression of one or all of these categories."

The '''Heyward Shepherd memorial''' was erected in 1931 by the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]]. It commemorates Heyward (sometimes spelled "Hayward") Shepherd (1825–October 16, 1859), a free black man, who was the first person killed during [[John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry]].
[[File:Heyward shepherd, a black porter who was the first killed during John Brown's raid on Harpers Ferry.jpg|thumb|This is from a 1906 book by Elijah Avey, ''The Capture and Execution of John Brown''. The author says he was an eyewitness. It is not known if it was the author who himself made the drawing.]]

==Heyward Shepherd==
Heyward Shepherd was a free black man who lived in [[Winchester, Virginia]], about {{convert|30|mi}} from Harpers Ferry. He owned property there, a small house, and had a wife and five children, according to the 1860 census. "It is unclear whether Shepherd was born a free man or was an emancipated slave because various anecdotal references present different opinions on that subject."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite article

He had a job as a porter or baggage handler with the [[Baltimore and Ohio Railroad]], and worked on the trains going back and forth through Harpers Ferry, an important rail junction. When the stationmaster was absent, he was in charge of the station. During the early hours of the raid on October 16, 1859, he recognized Brown's party, and tried to warn the town instead of helping the liberators. The raiders unexpectedly met Heyward, and ordered him to stop when he turned to run. When he failed to stop, he was shot in the back and/or the head, and killed. He was buried in the Winchester-Fairfax Colored Cemetery, without a grave marker. He was "accorded public honors by the state of Virginia, his funeral being attended by a detachment of the Virginia State militia."&lt;ref&gt;

===1931 Monument===
In 1931 a monument to Shepherd {{nowrap|({{coord|39.32330|-77.73005|format=dms|type:landmark_region:US-WV|display=inline}})}} was erected by both the [[Sons of Confederate Veterans]] and the [[United Daughters of the Confederacy]]. The text of the granite monument read: &lt;blockquote&gt;On the night of October 16, 1859, Heyward Shepherd, an industrious and respected colored freeman, was mortally wounded by John Brown's raiders, in pursuance of his duties as an employee of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company, he became the first victim of this attempted insurrection. This boulder is erected by the United Daughters of the Confederacy and the Sons of Confederate Veterans as a memorial to Heyward Shepherd, exemplifying the character and faithfulness of thousands of Negros who under many temptations throughout subsequent years of war. So conducted themselves that no stain was left upon a record which is the peculiar heritage of the American people, and an everlasting tribute to the best in both races.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1932 Plaque===
The monument was immediately challenged by many as perpetuating the "faithful slave" concept of slavery as a justification for the practice.

The NAACP responded by preparing a plaque to be displayed at [[Storer College]] in Harpers Ferry, where the firehouse used by John Brown as a fort had been placed. The president of the college refused to allow the plaque to be mounted because of the militant text. In 2006 the plaque was finally placed on the side of the firehouse. The text of the plaque reads:&lt;blockquote&gt; HERE JOHN BROWN AIMED AT HUMAN SLAVERY A BLOW THAT WOKE A GUILTY NATION. WITH HIM FOUGHT SEVEN SLAVES AND SONS OF SLAVES. OVER HIS CRUCIFIED CORPSE MARCHED 200,000 BLACK SOLDIERS AND 4,000,000 FREEDMEN SINGING  "JOHN BROWN'S BODY LIES A-MOULDERING IN THE GRAVE BUT HIS SOUL GOES MARCHING ON!" IN GRATITUDE THIS TABLET IS ERECTED THE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF COLORED PEOPLE MAY 21, 1932&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1955 Plaque===
A plaque to contexualize the original 1931 monument was placed in 1955 by the National Park Service. The text of the plaque read: &lt;blockquote&gt;John Brown’s raid on the armory at Harpers Ferry caused the death of four townspeople. One of those died in the fighting was Heyward Shepherd, a railroad baggagemaster and a free black. Although the true identity of his assailant is uncertain, Shepherd soon became a symbol of the "faithful servant" among those who deplored Brown’s action against the traditional southern way of life. This monument, placed here in 1931, reflects those traditional views.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===1994 Plaque===
Another plaque was installed near the 1931 monument to place the monument in context by the National Park Service. It reads: &lt;blockquote&gt;On October 17, 1859, abolitionist John Brown attacked Harpers Ferry to launch a war against slavery. Heyward Shepherd, a free African-American railroad baggage master, was shot and killed by Brown’s men shortly after midnight. Seventy-two years later, on October 10, 1931, a crowd estimated to 300 whites and 100 blacks gathered to unveil and dedicate the Shepherd Monument. During the ceremony, voices rose to praise and denounce the monument. Conceived around the turn of the century, the monument endured controversy. In 1905, the United Daughters of the Confederacy stated that erecting the monument would influence for good the present and coming generations, and prove that the people of the South who owned slaves valued and respected their good qualities as no one else ever did or will do.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

'''The Institute of Commonwealth Studies''' was a graduate research centre of the [[University of Oxford]] which was in existence between 1945 and 1986. 

==History==
The last year of Sir [[Reader Bullard]] as Director, 1956, saw the alteration of the Institute’s name from Institute of Colonial Studies to Institute of Commonwealth Studies, reflecting changes in Britain’s imperial status. The Institute of Colonial Studies had been established in 1945. Its antecedent had been the training courses at the [[University of Oxford]] for both the probationers of the [[Indian Civil Service]] and the [[Colonial Service]]s (such as the Tropical African Service Course). More directly it had developed out of the University’s response to a proposed expansion, to be made in the post-war years, in the training of colonial civil servants. These proposals were eventually published as the Report on Post-War Training for the Colonial Service (Devonshire Report, 1946). Much of the drafting of the report had been undertaken by [[Margery Perham]], then Reader in Colonial Administration at Oxford, who had also been influential in establishing the Committee for Colonial Studies, the Institute’s supervising body, in 1943. The Institute was set up under the directorship of Perham, assisted by Col. F.B.H. Drummond as administrative secretary who also acted as secretary to the Committee. In 1948 both Perham and Drummond resigned and the Institute’s affairs were placed in the hands of a Committee of Management, consisting of the [[Beit Professor of Commonwealth History]] (then, of the History of the British Empire), the Registrar and the Reader in Colonial Administration, who continued to run the Institute until Bullard's appointment as Director in 1951. The Institute, initially located at 10 Bardwell Road, Oxford, moved in 1948 to premises in South Parks Road, in 1951 to 10 Keble Road, and in 1961 to Queen Elizabeth House (21 St Giles). It continued in existence until 1986, when it was amalgamated with the Institute of Agricultural Economics and [[Queen Elizabeth House]] to form the International Development Centre, a centre for international Development Studies.&lt;ref name="QEH History"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.qeh.ox.ac.uk/content/history|title=History|publisher=qeh.ox.ac.uk|accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2005, the centre moved to Mansfield Road and became the [[Oxford Department of International Development]].&lt;ref name="QEH History"/&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Noam Chomsky]] [[Faurisson affair|defended an author]] who wrote articles for the journal ([[Robert Faurisson]]), it led to great controversy, though Chomsky insisted he was defending Faurisson's right to [[free speech]] rather than any specific claims made in his articles.

''[[The History Teacher]]'' wrote that the "[journal] is shockingly [[racist]] and [[antisemitic]]: articles on 'America's Failed Racial Policy' and anti-Israel pieces accompany those about gas chambers... They clearly have no business claiming to be a continuation of the revisionist tradition, and should be referred to as 'Holocaust Deniers'."&lt;ref&gt;

The [[Organization of American Historians]] commissioned a study of the journal in which a panel had found that it was "nothing but a masquerade of scholarship".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/historical_review.asp?xpicked=3&amp;item=ihr Extremism in America: Institute for Historical Review] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061202163147/http://www.adl.org/learn/ext_us/historical_review.asp?xpicked=3&amp;item=ihr |date=2006-12-02 }}, [[Anti-Defamation League]], 2005. Retrieved May 9, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Russian historians [[Igor Ryzhov]], [[Maria Borodina]] note that the publication by the Institute for Historical Review of its own "''historical journal, the Journal of Historical Review, helped not only to unite the deniers into a single movement, but also to give their activities a form of pseudo-scientificness.''"&lt;ref name="rb2015" /&gt;

The journal commenced publication in the spring of 1980 as a quarterly periodical. Publication was suspended in 1986–1987, and thereafter continued until 2002.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/institute-historical-review Institute for Historical Review] by the [[Southern Poverty Law Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; Publication of the journal is now again suspended.

{{Portal|Ancient Near East}}
The '''''Journal of Semitic Studies''''' is a biannual [[peer-reviewed]] [[academic journal]] that was established in 1955. It covers research of the modern as well as the [[ancient Near East]], with a special focus on [[Semitic languages]] and the corresponding literatures. The [[editors-in-chief|editorial committee]] currently consists of P. S. Alexander, G.J. Brooke, R. Buckley, D. C. Eades, J. F. Healey, P. C. Sadgrove, and R. Smithuis.

==History==
[[H. H. Rowley]] was notably the editor of the ''Journal of Semitic Studies'' from 1956 to 1960 along with [[Pinkas Rudolf Weis]].&lt;ref name=HHWel&gt;{{cite web|title= Rowley, Harold Henry|publisher=Dictionary of Welsh Biography|url=http://yba.llgc.org.uk/en/s2-ROWL-HEN-1890.html|accessdate=20 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The role was picked up after Rowley's death by [[Joseph E. Lowry]] as editor from 1961.

==Supplement==
From 1993 to date the Society publishes a Supplement series of books.&lt;ref name=Suppl&gt;{{cite web|title= Journal of Semitic Studies publication |publisher=OxfordJournals.org |url=http://www.oxfordjournals.org/semitj/book_suppl_series.html|accessdate=27 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rationale is to give scope for larger treatments of subject than is possible in the context of a journal.

== Origin ==
[[Lacquerware]] is a longstanding [[Japanese traditional culture|tradition in Japan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/1985/09/22/travel/shopper-s-world-japan-s-ancient-art-of-lacquerware.html|title = Japan's Ancient Art of Lacquerware|date = September 22, 1985|website = [[New York Times]]|last = Ota|first = Alan K.|publisher = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/04/04/arts/design/04lacq.html|title = A Craft Polished to the Lofty Heights of Art|date = April 4, 2008|website = New York Times|publisher = |last=Ken|first=Johnson|accessdate = April 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and at some point ''kintsugi'' may have been combined with ''[[maki-e]]'' as a replacement for other ceramic repair techniques. While the process is associated with Japanese craftsmen, the technique was also applied to ceramic pieces of other origins including China, Vietnam, and Korea.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.si.edu/Exhibitions/Details/Golden-Seams-The-Japanese-Art-of-Mending-Ceramics-4567 |title=Golden Seams: The Japanese Art of Mending Ceramics |date=November 8, 2008 |work=[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]] |accessdate=2014-04-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kintsugi'' became closely associated with [[List of Japanese tea ceremony equipment|ceramic vessels]] used for ''chanoyu'' ([[Japanese tea ceremony]]).&lt;ref name="seams" /&gt; One theory is that ''kintsugi'' may have originated when Japanese ''[[shōgun]]'' [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa]] sent a damaged Chinese [[Chawan|tea bowl]] back to [[China]] for repairs in the late 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/03/02/AR2009030202723.html|title = 'Golden Seams: The Japanese Art of Mending Ceramics' at Freer|website = [[The Washington Post]]|last = Gopnik|first = Blake|date = March 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; When it was returned, repaired with ugly metal staples, it may have prompted Japanese craftsmen to look for a more aesthetic means of repair. Collectors became so enamored with the new art that some were accused of deliberately smashing valuable pottery so it could be repaired with the gold seams of ''kintsugi''.&lt;ref name="smashing" /&gt;

== Philosophy ==
As a philosophy, kintsugi can be seen to have similarities to the Japanese philosophy of [[wabi-sabi]], an embracing of the flawed or imperfect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://makezine.com/2015/08/17/kintsugi-japanese-art-recognizing-beauty-broken-things/|title=Kintsugi Is Recognizing Beauty in Broken Things {{!}} Make:|date=2015-08-17|website=Make: DIY Projects and Ideas for Makers|access-date=2017-07-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Japanese [[aesthetics]] values marks of wear by the use of an object. This can be seen as a rationale for keeping an object around even after it has broken and as a justification of kintsugi itself, highlighting the cracks and repairs as simply an event in the life of an object rather than allowing its service to end at the time of its damage or breakage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Exploring Japanese Art and Aesthetic as inspiration for emotionally durable design|url = http://www.designedasia.com/2012/Full_Papers/Exploring%20Japanese%20Art%20and%20Aesthetic.pdf|last = Kwan|first = Pui Ying}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kintsugi can relate to the [[Japanese philosophy]] of {{Nihongo|"no mind"|無心|[[mushin (mental state)|mushin]]}}, which encompasses the concepts of non-attachment, acceptance of change, and fate as aspects of human life.&lt;ref&gt;Flickwerk The Aesthetics of Mended Japanese Ceramics Paperback, January 1, 2008 by Christy, James Henry Holland and Charly Iten Bartlett&lt;/ref&gt;

{{centered pull quote|Not only is there no attempt to hide the damage, but the repair is literally illuminated... a kind of physical expression of the spirit of [[mushin (mental state)|mushin]]....Mushin is often literally translated as "no mind," but carries connotations of fully existing within the moment, of non-attachment, of equanimity amid changing conditions. ...The vicissitudes of existence over time, to which all humans are susceptible, could not be clearer than in the breaks, the knocks, and the shattering to which ceramic ware too is subject. This poignancy or aesthetic of existence has been known in Japan as [[mono no aware]], a compassionate sensitivity, or perhaps identification with, [things] outside oneself.|

== Types of joinery ==
There are a few major styles or types of kintsugi:
* {{Nihongo|Crack|ひび}}, the use of gold dust and resin or lacquer to attach broken pieces with minimal overlap or fill-in from missing pieces
* {{Nihongo|Piece method|欠けの金継ぎ例}}, where a replacement ceramic fragment is not available and the entirety of the addition is gold or gold/lacquer compound
* {{Nihongo|Joint call|呼び継ぎ}}, where a similarly shaped but non-matching fragment is used to replace a missing piece from the original vessel creating a [[patchwork]] effect&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://matome.naver.jp/odai/2136989780569618901|title = Gold joint (mending gold) What is it?|accessdate = 2014-04-02|date = 2013-05-04|language = Japanese}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Related techniques ==
[[File:Staple repairs.jpg|thumb|Nanking reticulated basket, c. 1750, mended with metal staples]]
Staple repair is a similar technique used to [[Conservation and restoration of ceramic objects|repair broken ceramic]] pieces,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/arts/design/repaired-china-the-potter-john-bennett-schoolgirl-rugs.html|title = It’s as Good as Glue: Mending Shattered China|accessdate = 2014-04-05|last = Kahn|first = Eve|date = January 17, 2013|publisher = New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; where small holes are drilled on either side of a crack and metal [[Staple (fastener)|staples]] are bent to hold the pieces together.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Stapled Repairs on Chine; Confessions of a curious collector|date = February 2012|url = https://www.antiquesjournal.com/flipbooks/neajfeb12/index.html|publisher = Antiques Journal|accessdate = 2014-04-05|pages = 37–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Staple repair was used in Europe (in ancient Greece, England and Russia among others) and China as a repair technique for particularly valuable pieces.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Influence on modern art ==
Kintsugi is the general concept of highlighting or emphasizing imperfections, visualizing mends and seams as an additive or an area to celebrate or focus on, rather than absence or missing pieces. Modern artists experiment with the ancient technique as a means of analyzing the idea of loss, synthesis, and improvement through destruction and repair or rebirth.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.smh.com.au/entertainment/art-and-design/smashing-idea-to-put-it-together-again-20110226-1b990.html|title = Smashing idea to put it together again|date = February 27, 2011|last = Taylor|first = Andrew|website = [[Sydney Morning Herald]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While originally ignored as a separate art form, kintsugi and related repair methods have been featured at exhibitions at the [[Freer Gallery of Art|Freer Gallery]] at the [[Smithsonian Institution|Smithsonian]], the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], and the [[Herbert F. Johnson Museum of Art]], Cornell University Ithaca NY, USA.&lt;ref name="smashing" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2010/12/16/garden/16makedo.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0|title = In Make-Do Objects, Collectors Find Beauty Beyond Repair|publisher = [[New York Times]]|date = December 15, 2010|accessdate = 2014-04-05|first = Lippke|last = Andrea Codrington}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://museum.cornell.edu/exhibitions/aesthetics-mended-japanese-ceramics|title=The Aesthetics of Mended Japanese Ceramics {{!}} Herbert F.

==Effects on tourism==

Authenticity continues to ignite interest among tourism and marketing scholars&lt;ref name="Taheri 1–19"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Taheri|first=Babak|last2=Farrington|first2=Thomas|last3=Curran|first3=Ross|last4=O'Gorman|first4=Kevin|date=2017-04-11|title=Sustainability and the authentic experience.

By highlighting that the authentic object or site is that which, despite the ravages of time, retains cultural value (be that local, national, and/or international), site managers can re-figure and promote a conception of authenticity to tourists.&lt;ref name="Taheri 1–19"/&gt;

'''Leonid Pavlovich Potapov''' ({{lang-ru|Леони́д Па́влович Пота́пов}}; 6 July 1905 – 9 October 2000) was a 20th-century [[ethnographer]] specialising in the study of peoples of southern [[Siberia]].

==Early life and education==
Leonid Potapov was born in the [[Altai Krai|Altai]] city of [[Barnaul]]. From his early years Potapov showed interest to ethnography of his native land, travelling to study the culture of [[Altaian]]s with a known Altaist [[Andrey V. Anokhin]]. He visited Alatai in 1925 to gather ethnographic material on behalf of the [[Russian Geographical Society]]. He graduated from the geographical department of the [[Leningrad State University]] with a major in ethnography in 1928. Here he had studied with [[Lev Sternberg]],  [[Vladimir Bogoraz]],  [[Dmitry Konstantinovich Zelenin|Dmitrii Zelenin]], [[Sergei Rudenko]]. [[Alexander Samoylovich]], and [[Sergey Malov]] tutored him in Türkic languages.

==Career==
Following his graduation Potapov was appointed a head of scientific department in an [[Uzbeks|Uzbek]] research institute, leading ethnographic expeditions to various areas of [[Uzbekistan]].

Doctor of Historical sciences, professor, "[[Tuva ASSR]] Honored Worker of Science", an outstanding researcher of history and culture of [[Altaians]], [[Shors]], [[Khakas people|Khakases]], [[Tuvinians]] and other peoples of southern Siberia. He continued to collect material, publishing his first major text ''Essays on [[Shoria]] history'' in 1931 and continued with his post graduate work at the [[USSR Academy of Sciences]]. He accepted [[Marxism-Leninism]] and its application to ethnography. After completing his postgraduate study, Potapov headed the Siberia and ethnography department of the [[Peter the Great Museum of Anthropology and Ethnography|State Ethnographical Museum of the USSR peoples]] in the [[Kunstkamera]] and conducted research work at the USSR Academy of Science's History of Material Culture Institute.

In 1939, Potapov gained a PhD in Historical Sciences, presenting the monograph ''Relicts of primitive-communal system of Altai peoples''. By that time Potapov had published about 30 works, including a number of monographs. At the beginning of the [[World War II]] Potapov worked on the evacuation of museum valuables, moving with the museum collection to [[Novosibirsk]] in 1942. In 1946 he published ''Altaians'' and was appointed professor. he then headed the [[Khakas people|Khakass]] ethnographic expedition, spending the next 11 years with various expeditions to Altai, Shoria, Khakassia and Tuva. He broadened his research materials on shamanism incorporating non-soviet sources. Potapov focussed on pre-Islam beliefs of peoples of Central Asia, ethnogenesis, ethnographic materials, archival, written and archeological sources.

In 1948 Potapov published ''"Essays on history of Altaians"'' (Novosibirsk, 1948), which was awarded with "Stalin" (later renamed ''State'') premium. He contributed to ''Essays on the USSR history'', ''History of the USSR'', the five-volume ''History of Siberia'' and published ''Brief Esasay on culture and a life of Altaians'' (Gorno-Altaisk, 1948), ''Brief Essays on history and ethnography of Khakases (17th–19th centuries)''  (Abakan, 1952), ''Origin and formation of Khakass nation'' (Abakan, 1957), ''Ethnic Composition and Origin of Altaians'' (Leningrad, 1969), ''Essays on native life of Tuvinians'' (Moscow, 1969).

From 1957 to 1966 the Tuva Archeological  Ethnographical Expedition worked on studies of ethnogenesis and history of Tuvinians. working with [[A.D. Grach]], [[S.I. Weinstein]] and [[V.P. Diakonova]], he edited the three-volume ''Works of Tuva complex archeological ethnographical expedition''. Participants wrote a collective monograph ''"History of Tuva"'' (Vol. 1). In 1956 Potapov wrote chapters on 'Altaians', 'Khakases', 'Tuvinians' and 'Shors' for the ''Peoples of Siberia'' in ''Nations of the world'' series, published also in English by the [[University of Chicago]]. Potapov participated in the 23rd and 25th congresses of Orientalists, and in the 6th and 7th congresses of anthropologists and ethnographers (Paris, 1960).

Potapov created a scientific school studying the peoples of Siberia, especially the [[Sayan-Altai region]], and prepared 48 PhD in sciences. A special scientific contribution was his work ''Altai shamanism'' (1991) with a rich collection of material brought from uncountable field research materials. Potapov joined the names of [[Nicholas Poppe|N.N. Poppe]] (1970), [[V.I. Tsintsius]] (1972), [[A.N. Kononov]] (1976), [[Nikolai A.Baskakov|N.A. Baskakov]] (1980), [[A.M. Scherbak]] (1992) who were awarded "PIAK Gold medal" for Altaic studies.

[[Micronations]], sometimes also referred to as ''model countries'' and ''new country projects'', are small, [[self-proclaimed]] entities that claim to be independent sovereign states but which are not acknowledged as such by any recognised sovereign state, or by any supranational organization. They should not be confused with [[microstate]]s, which are recognised independent states of a small size, nor should they be confused with [[list of unrecognised states|unrecognised states]], which may have legitimate claim to sovereign state status.&lt;ref name="Ryan"&gt;{{cite book |title=Micronations |last=Ryan |first=John |author2=Dunford, George |author3=Sellars, Simon  |year=2006 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=1-74104-730-7 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=5ZRrwrlIPSYC&amp;pg=PA139&amp;dq=%22Dominion+of+British+West+Florida%22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|5}}

Motivations for the creation of micronations include theoretical experimentation, political protest, artistic expression, personal entertainment and the conduct of criminal activity.&lt;ref name="Ryan"/&gt;{{rp|4}}

When the federal courts refused to hear the matter, Assistant State Attorney General [[Mario Cuomo]] was dispatched to negotiate a settlement.

'''''Lo!''''' was the third published [[nonfiction]] work of the author [[Charles Fort]] (first edition 1931).  In it he details a wide range of unusual phenomena.  In the final chapter of the book he proposes a new [[cosmology]] that the earth is stationary in space and surrounded by a solid shell which is (in the book's final words) ".. not unthinkably far away."

== Overview ==

Of Fort's four books, this volume deals most frequently and scathingly with [[astronomy]] (continuing from his previous book ''[[New Lands]]''). The book also deals extensively with other subjects, including paranormal phenomena (see [[parapsychology]]), which were explored in his first book, ''[[The Book of the Damned]]''. Fort is widely credited with having coined the now-popular term [[Teleportation#Etymology|teleportation]] in this book, and here he ties his previous statements on what he referred to as the [[Super-Sargasso Sea]] into his beliefs on teleportation. He would later expand this theory to include purported mental and [[psychic]] phenomena in his fourth and final book, ''[[Wild Talents]].''

It takes its derisive title from what he regarded as the tendency of [[astronomers]] to make [[positivist]]ic, overly precise, and premature announcements of [[Sky|celestial]] events and discoveries. Fort portrays them as quack [[prophet]]s, sententiously pointing towards the skies and saying "Lo!"—inaccurately, as it turn out.

''Lo!'' is arguably Fort's most popular book, perhaps due to the fact that it deals with an extremely wide and diverse range of phenomena (as can be seen below), and Fort by then had a clear theorem. His book is divided into two sections: the first on the above phenomena; the second, on his attacks on astronomy. The reason for this is that Fort had been working on a follow-up to ''[[The Book of the Damned]]'', but he scrapped the idea and incorporated many of the subjects into this one.

'''''Lo!''''' is used extensively in Blue Balliett's book, ''[[Chasing Vermeer]]''.

==Part One: Teleportation==

Fort established his [[thesis statement|thesis]] for this particular book early on—that some sort of mysterious force, known as the "[[cosmic joker]]" (in his words), is responsible for the teleportation of people, animals, and materials. This thesis would be revised later to accommodate Fort's research on psychic phenomena in ''[[Wild Talents]]''.

Fort started the book largely where he left off in ''[[The Book of the Damned]]'': mysterious falls of animals and strange materials, flying stones, [[poltergeist]] activity, etc., and incorporated these strange phenomena into his new theory on teleportation, saying that teleportation from the Super-Sargasso Sea can explain these phenomena.  Fort also briefly touched on [[UFOs]] again in this book, and wrote extensively on a number of other topics which he felt can be explained by teleportation: [[cryptozoology]] (including the [[Jersey Devil]] and various out of place animals), animal mutilations and attacks on people, strange swarming of balls, the appearance of various strange people from nowhere (the famous cases of [[Princess Caraboo]] and [[Kaspar Hauser]]), and the mysterious disappearances of others (including the diplomat [[Benjamin Bathurst (disappearance)|Benjamin Bathurst]], and vessels such as the ''[[Mary Celeste]]'', ''[[Carroll A. Deering]]'', and ''[[USS Cyclops (1910)|USS Cyclops]]'', presaging later interest in the [[Bermuda Triangle]] phenomenon). He wrote an extensive chapter on the winter of 1904-5 in Britain, when a widespread religious [[Revivalism|revival]] in England and Wales coincided with numerous other strange occurrences: the appearances of [[ghosts]], poltergeists, a few purported cases of [[Spontaneous Human Combustion]], and a ravenous [[wolf]] (or perhaps [[werewolf]]) mutilating sheep and other farm animals in [[Northumberland]].

Fort believed that all of these anomalous phenomena can be explained by his teleportation theory—though he later apparently retracted this theory to an extent in his final book.

==Part Two: Astronomy ==

Astronomy was in vogue since the discovery of the [[Planet]] [[Pluto]], in part by calculation.

Fort was sceptical of [[Albert Einstein]]'s theories of [[theory of relativity|relativity]] and the claim that these could be confirmed by a transit of the Sun. He was sceptical of the accuracy of the [[mathematics]] and the observations involved, and pointed out seeming contradictions and anomalies in scientists' statements to the press.

The book was recently released in a paperback version, and it is included in ''The Complete Works Of Charles Fort'' with Fort's other paranormal writings.  An online version of the book is linked below.

'''''Mathesis universalis''''' (Greek μάθησις, ''mathesis'' "science or learning",  Latin ''universalis'' "universal") is a hypothetical universal science modeled on [[mathematics]] envisaged by [[Descartes]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], among a number of more minor 16th and 17th century philosophers and mathematicians. [[John Wallis]] invokes the name as the title to a textbook on [[Cartesian geometry]]. For Leibniz, it would be supported by a [[calculus ratiocinator]].

Descartes' clearest description of the ''mathesis universalis'' occurs in Rule IV of the [[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]], written before 1628. The desire for a language more perfect than any [[natural language]] had been expressed before Leibniz by [[John Wilkins]] in his ''[[An Essay towards a Real Character and a Philosophical Language]]'' in 1668. Leibniz attempts to work out the possible connections between algebra, infinitesimal calculus, and universal character in an incomplete treatise titled "''Mathesis Universalis''" in 1695.

[[Predicate logic]] could be seen as a modern system with some of these ''universal'' characteristics, at least as far as mathematics and [[computer science]] are concerned. More generally, ''mathesis universalis'', along with perhaps [[François Viète]]'s [[algebra]], represents one of the earliest attempts to construct a [[formal system]].

One of the perhaps most prominent critics of the idea of ''mathesis universalis'' was [[Ludwig Wittgenstein's philosophy of mathematics|Ludwig Wittgenstein and his philosophy of mathematics.]] As Anthropologist Prof. Emily Martin notes: 'Tackling mathematics, the realm of symbolic life perhaps most difficult to regard as contingent on social norms, Wittgenstein commented that people found the idea that numbers rested on conventional social understandings "unbearable"'&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=Emily|date=October 2013|title=The Potentiality of Ethnography and the Limits of Affect Theory|url=|journal=Current Anthropology|volume=54| issue =  S7|pages=156|doi=10.1086/670388}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discussions of Wittgenstein|last=Rhees|first=Rush|publisher=Schocken|year=1970|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

F.|title=Perspectives on culture, technology, and communication: The media ecology tradition|year=2006|publisher=NJ: Hampton|location=Gencarelli|pages=201–225}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

[[Ecology]] in this context refers to the environment in which the medium is used – what they are and how they affect society.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;''Understanding Me:  Lectures and Interviews,'' by Marshall McLuhan, edited by Stephanie McLuhan and David Staines, Foreword by Tom Wolfe.  MIT Press, 2004, p. 271&lt;/ref&gt; Neil Postman states, "if in biology a 'medium' is something in which a bacterial culture grows (as in a Petri dish), in media ecology, the medium is 'a technology within which a [human] culture grows.'" &lt;ref&gt;Postman, N. (2006). Media Ecology Education. Explorations in Media Ecology, 5(1), 5-14. doi:10.1386/eme.5.1.5_1&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, "Media ecology looks into the matter of how media of communication affect human perception, understanding, feeling, and value; and how our interaction with media facilitates or impedes our chances of survival. The word ecology implies the study of environments: their structure, content, and impact on people. An environment is, after all, a complex message system which imposes on human beings certain ways of thinking, feeling, and behaving."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Postman|first=Neil|date=|website=Media Ecology Association|publisher=|access-date=2 Oct 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Media ecology argues that media act as extensions of the human senses in each era, and [[communication technology]] is the primary cause of social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hakanen|first=Ernest A.|title=Branding the teleself: Media effects discourse and the changing self|year=2007|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|location=Lanham, MD|isbn=978-0-7391-1734-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan is famous for coining the phrase, "[[the medium is the message]]", which is an often-debated phrase believed to mean that the medium chosen to relay a message is just as important (if not more so) than the message itself.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; McLuhan proposed that media influence the progression of society, and that significant periods of time and growth can be categorized by the rise of a specific technology during that period.

Additionally, scholars have compared media broadly to a system of infrastructure that connect the nature and culture of a society with media ecology being the study of "traffic" between the two.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.b.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=eea7d6ba-45f9-4434-912c-3d9a2405e153@pdc-v-sessmgr01|title=Infrastructuralism: Media as Traffic between Nature and Culture.: EBSCOhost|website=web.b.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==

===Marshall McLuhan===

In 1934, Marshall McLuhan enrolled as a student at [[Cambridge University]], a school which pioneered modern literary [[criticism]]. During his studies at Cambridge, he became acquainted with one of his professors, [[I.A. Richards]], a distinguished English professor, who would inspire McLuhan's later scholarly works. McLuhan admired Richards' approach to the critical view that English studies are themselves nothing but a study of the process of communication.&lt;ref name="Marchand"&gt;{{cite book|last=Marchand|first=Philip|title=Marshall McLuhan: The Medium and The Messenger : A Biography|year=1998|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=0-262-63186-5|pages=37–39|edition=Rev Sub}}&lt;/ref&gt; Richards believed that "words won't stay put and almost all verbal constructions are highly ambiguous".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This element of Richards' perspective on communication influenced the way in which McLuhan expressed many of his ideas using metaphors and phrases such as "[[Global village (term)|The Global Village]]" and "[[The Medium Is the Message]]" two of his most well known phrases that encapsulate the theory of Media Ecology.  
[[File:Marshall McLuhan.jpg|thumb|[[Marshall McLuhan]], c. 1936.]]
McLuhan used the approaches of Richards, [[William Empson]], and [[Harold Innis|Harlold Innis]] as an "entrée to the study of media".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; However, it took many years of work before he was able to successfully fulfill their approaches. McLuhan determined that "if words were ambiguous and best studied not in terms of their 'content' but in terms of their effects in a given context and if the effects were often subliminal, the same might be true of other human artifacts, the wheel, the printing press, the telegraph and the TV".&lt;ref name="Marchand" /&gt; This led to the emergence of his ideas on Media Ecology.

In addition to his scholarly work, McLuhan was also a well known media personality of his day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://marshallmcluhan.com/biography/|title=Who was Marshall McLuhan? – The Estate of Marshall McLuhan|website=marshallmcluhan.com|access-date=2016-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; He appeared on television shows, in magazine articles, and even had a small cameo in the movie ''[[Annie Hall]]''.

Few theories receive the kind of household recognition that Media Ecology received, due directly to McLuhan's role as a pop culture icon.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mullen|first=Megan|year=2006|title=Coming to Terms with the Future He Foresaw : Marshall McLuhan's 'Understanding Media'|jstor=40061070|journal=Technology and Culture|volume=47|issue=2|pages=373–380|doi=10.1353/tech.2006.0143}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was an excellent debater and public speaker,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Marshall McLuhan: The medium and the messenger|last=Marchand|first=Phillip|publisher=Ticknor &amp; Fields|year=1989|isbn=0899194850|location=New York|pages=153|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but his writing was not always what would normally pass in academia.

=== Neil Postman ===
Inspired by McLuhan, [[Neil Postman]] founded the Program in Media Ecology at [[New York University]] in 1971, as he further developed the theory McLuhan had established. According to Postman, media ecology emphasizes the environments in which communication and technologies operate and spread information and the effects these have on the receivers.&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "What is Media Ecology." ''Media Ecology Association.'' 2009. Web. 29 Sept 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; "Such information forms as the alphabet, the printed word, and television images are not mere instruments which make things easier for us. They are environments - like language itself, symbolic environments with in which we discover, fashion, and express humanity in particular ways."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Neil. "Teaching as a conserving activity." Instructor 89.4 (1979).&lt;/ref&gt;

Postman focused on media technology, process, and structure rather than content and considered making moral judgments the primary task of media ecology. "I don't see any point in studying media unless one does so within a moral or ethical context."&lt;ref name="Griffin"&gt;Griffin, Em. A First Look at Communication Theory. 7th ed. New York, NY: The McGraw-Hill , 2009. Print&lt;/ref&gt;  Postman's media ecology approach asks three questions: What are the moral implications of this bargain? Are the consequences more humanistic or antihumanistic? Do we, as a society, gain more than we lose, or do we lose more than we gain?&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt;

=== Walter Ong ===
Walter Ong was a scholar with a master’s degree in English who was once a student of McLuhan at the Saint Louis University.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/631683671|title=Echoes and reflections : on media ecology as a field of study|last=Lance,|first=Strate,|date=2006|publisher=Hampton Press|isbn=9781572737259|location=Cresskill, N.J.|oclc=631683671}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contributions of Ong standardized and gave creditability to the field of Media Ecology as an academic study that’s worth scholarship.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

The studies of Ong have contributed greatly towards developing the concept of Media Ecology. Ong has written over 450 publications, many of which focused on the relation between conscious behavior and the evolution of the media, and he received the Media Ecology Association's Walter Benjamin Award for Outstanding Article for his paper, "Digitization Ancient and Modern: Beginnings of Writing and Today's Computers". &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.slu.edu/arts-and-sciences/ong-center/walter-ong.php|title=About Walter J.

=== North American, European and Eurasian versions ===
Media ecology is a contested term within [[media studies]] for it has different meanings in European and North American contexts. The North American definition refers to an [[Interdisciplinarity|interdisciplinary]] field of media theory and media design involving the study of media environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/media_ecology/index.html|title=What is Media Ecology?|last=Nystrom|first=Christine|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The European version of media ecology is a materialist investigation of media systems as complex dynamic systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Strate|first=Lance|year=2004|title=A Media Ecology Review|url=http://cscc.scu.edu/trends/v23/v23_2.pdf|journal=Communication Research Trends|volume=23|pages=28–31|issn=0144-4646|accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Russia, a similar theory was independently developed by [[Yuri Rozhdestvensky]]. In more than five monographs, Rozhdestvensky outlined the systematic changes which take place in society each time new communication media are introduced, and connected these changes to the challenges in politics, philosophy and education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Polski, M. |author2=Gorman, L.|year=2012|title=Yuri Rozhdestvensky vs. MArshall McLuhan: A triumph vs. a Vortex|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=10 |issue=3–4|url=http://www.intellectbooks.co.uk/journals/view-Article,id=13566/|doi=10.1386/eme.10.3-4.263_1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a founder of the vibrant school of ecology of culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Polski, M.|year=2013|title=Media Ecology Pedagogy—Art or Techne?|conference=MEA conference|location=Grand Rapids, MI}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The European version of media ecology rejects the North American notion that ecology means environment. Ecology in this context is used "because it is one of the most expressive [terms] language currently has to indicate the massive and dynamic interrelation of processes and objects, beings and things, patterns and matter".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Fuller, Matthew|title=Media Ecologies: Materialist Energies in Art and Technoculture|publisher=MIT Press|year=2005|pp=2–3|isbn=9780262062473|series=Leonardo Series}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following theorists such as [[Felix Guattari]], [[Gregory Bateson]], and [[Manuel De Landa]], the European version of media ecology (as practiced by authors such as [[Matthew Fuller (author)|Matthew Fuller]] and [[Jussi Parikka]]) presents a post-structuralist political perspective on media as complex dynamical systems.

=== Other contributions ===
Along with McLuhan {{Harv|McLuhan|1962}}, Postman {{Harv|Postman|1985}} and [[Harold Innis]], media ecology draws from many authors, including the work of [[Walter Ong]], [[Lewis Mumford]], [[Jacques Ellul]], [[Félix Guattari]], [[Eric Havelock]], [[Susanne Langer]], [[Erving Goffman]], [[Edward T. Hall]], [[George Herbert Mead]], [[Margaret Mead]], [[Claude Lévi-Strauss]], [[Benjamin Lee Whorf]], and [[Gregory Bateson]].

==Core concepts==

=== Assumptions of the theory ===
* Media are infused in every act and action in society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = West|first = Richard|title = Introducing Communication Theory: Analysis and Application|year = 2010|publisher = Mc Graw Hill|location = New York|isbn = 978-0-07-338507-5|pages = 428–430|edition = 4|author2 = Lynn H. Turner|chapter = 25}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Media fix our perceptions and organize our experiences.
* Media tie the world together.

These three assumptions can be understood as: media are everywhere all the time; media determine what we know and how we feel about what we know; and media connect us to others. Communication media have penetrated the lives of almost all people on the planet, arranging people into an interconnected human community.

===McLuhan's media history===

McLuhan believed there are three inventions that transformed the world: the [[phonemic orthography|phonetic alphabet]], the [[printing press]], and the [[telegraph]]. Due to these technologies, the world was taken from one era into the next. In order to understand the effects of symbolic environment, McLuhan split history into four periods:&lt;ref name="epoch" /&gt; the tribal age, the literary age, the print age, and the [[electronic age]] (information age). Throughout the structure of their distinctive methods of communication (e.g., oral, written, printed, electronic), different media arouse patterns in the brain that are distinctive to each and every particular form of communication.&lt;ref name="epoch"&gt;{{cite book|last = McLuhan|first = M.|title = The Medium is the Massage: An Inventory of Effects|year = 1967|publisher = HardWired|location = San Francisco|isbn = 978-1-888869-02-6|pages = |author2 = Fiore Q.|author3 = Agel J.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Tribal age====

The first period in history that McLuhan describes is the Tribal Age, a time of community because the ear is the dominant sense organ. This is also known as an acoustic era because the senses of hearing, touch, taste, and smell were far more strongly developed than the ability to visualize. During this time, hearing was more valuable because it allowed people to be more immediately aware of their surroundings, which was extremely important for hunting. Everyone hears at the same time making listening to someone in a group a unifying act, deepening the feeling of community. In this world of surround sound, everything is more immediate, more present, and fosters more passion and spontaneity. During the Tribal Age, hearing was believing.

====Literacy age====

The second age is the Literacy Stage, a time of private detachment because the eye is the dominant sense organ; also known as the visual era. Turning sounds into visible objects radically altered the symbolic environment. Words were no longer alive and immediate, they were able to read over and over again. Hearing no longer becomes trustworthy; seeing was believing. Even though people read the same words, the act of reading is an individual act of singular focus. Tribes didn't need to come together to get information anymore. This is when the invention of the alphabet came about. During this time, when people learned to read, they became independent thinkers.

====Print age====

The third stage is the Print Age, when individual products were mass produced due to the invention of the printing press. It gave the ability to reproduce the same text over and over again. With printing came a new visual stress: the portable book. It allowed people to carry books, so they could read in privacy isolated from others. Libraries were created to hold these books and also gave freedom to be alienated from others and from immediacy of their surroundings.

====Electronic age====

Lastly, the Electronic Age, otherwise included under the [[Information Age|information age]], is an era of instant communication and a return to an environment with simultaneous sounds and touch. It started with a device created by Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph and led to the telephone, the cell phone, television, internet, DVD, video games, etc. This ability to communicate instantly returned us to the tradition of sound and touch rather than sight. Being able to be in constant contact with the world becomes a nosy generation where everyone knows everyone's business and everyone's business is everyone else's. This phenomenon is called the [[Global village (term)|global village]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Updating the ages ====
[[Robert K. Logan]] is professor emeritus of [[physics]] at the [[University of Toronto]] and Chief Scientist of the Strategic Innovation Lab at the [[Ontario College of Art and Design]]. He worked collaboratively with Marshall McLuhan at the University of Toronto, co-publishing various works and producing his own works, heavily inspired by McLuhan. Logan updates the era of communications, adding two new eras:
# Age of nonverbal mimetic communication (characteristic of archaic [[Homo sapiens]])
# Age of orality
# Age of literacy
# Age of electric mass media
# Age of digital interactive media, or 'new media'&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Understanding New Media: Extending Marshall McLuhan|last=Logan|first=Robert K.|publisher=Peter Lang Publishing|year=2010|isbn=9781433111266|location=New York|pages=28–31}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In addition, through the study of media ecology, it is argued that through technological advancements in media, many societies have become a "[[participatory culture]]." Tom Valcanis argues that this very easily witnessed by looking at the rise of Apple's iPhone. "If the technology is the medium in which a culture grows, the interactive and user oriented nature of these technologies have given rise to a participatory and 'mash-up' culture in which the ways of producing and accessing content are deconstructed, uploaded, mixed, converged, and reconstructed through computers and smartphones mediated by online platforms; it becomes a 'participatory culture'..."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=1&amp;sid=2a4280c5-20e6-4610-831e-e8e7e7c9ae04@sessionmgr4007|title=AN IPHONE IN EVERY HAND: MEDIA ECOLOGY, COMMUNICATION STRUCTURES, AND THE G...: EBSCOhost|website=web.a.ebscohost.com|language=en|access-date=2017-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==='The medium is the message'===

"The medium is the message"&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Understanding media|last = McLuhan|first = Marshall|publisher = Mentor|year = 1964|isbn = 978-0262631594|location = New York|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is the most famous insight from McLuhan, and is one of the concepts that separates the North American theory from the European theory. Instead of emphasizing the information content, McLuhan highlighted the importance of medium characteristics which can influence and even decide the content. He proposed that it is the media format that affects and changes on people and society.

For example, [[traditional media]] is an extension of the human body, while the [[new media]] is the extension of the human nervous system. The emergence of new media will change the equilibrium between human sensual organs and affect human psychology and society.  The extension of human senses will change our thoughts and behaviors and the ways we perceive the world. That's why McLuhan believed when a new medium appears, no matter what the concrete content it transmits, the new form of communication brings in itself a force that causes social transformation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Chen|first=Xianhong|author2=Guilan Ding|title=SPECIAL COMMENTARY New media as relations|journal=Chinese Journal of Communication|date=November 2009|volume= 2| issue =  3|pages=367–369|url=http://www.informaworld.com|doi=10.1080/17544750903209242}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We are accustomed to thinking the [[message]] is separate from a [[Medium (website)|medium.]] McLuhan saw the message and the medium to mean the same thing. The audience is normally focused on the content and overlook the medium. What we forget is that the content cannot exist outside of the way that it is mediated. McLuhan recognized that the way media work as environments is because we are so immersed in them. "It is the medium that has the greatest impact in human affairs, not specific messages we send or receive.&lt;ref name="Strate"&gt;Strate, Lance. "Studying Media as Media: McLuhan and the Media Ecology Approach." MediaTropes eJournal. 1. (2008): 1-16. Web. 28 Nov. 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The media shape us because we partake in them over and over until they become a part of us.

Different mediums emphasize different senses and encourage different habits, so engaging in this medium day after day conditions our senses.&lt;ref name="Griffin" /&gt; Different forms of media also affect what their meaning and impact will be. The form of medium and mode of information determines who will have access, how much information will be distributed, how fast it will be transmitted, how far it will go, and, most importantly, what form it will be displayed.&lt;ref name="Strate" /&gt; With society being formed around the dominant medium of the day, the specific medium of communication makes a remarkable difference.

==== The Metaphor ====
The key elements to Media Ecology has been largely attributed to Marshal McLuhan, who coined the statement “the medium is the message.” Levinson furthers McLuhan’s statement by stating that “the way we communicate, often taken for granted, often determines what we communicate, and therein just about everything else in life and society” &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Levinson|first=paul|date=2000|title=McLuhan and Media Ecology|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/levinson01.pdf|journal=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=1|pages=17-22|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan gave a center of gravity, a moral compass to Media Ecology which was later adapted and formally introduced by Neil Postman&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

The very foundation for this theory is based on a metaphor that provides a model for understanding the new territory, offers a vocabulary, and indicates in which directions to continue exploring.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Scolari|first=Carlos A.|date=2012-04-09|title=Media Ecology: Exploring the Metaphor to Expand the Theory|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article-abstract/22/2/204/4085708?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=Communication Theory|language=en|volume=22|issue=2|pages=204–225|doi=10.1111/j.1468-2885.2012.01404.x|issn=1050-3293}}&lt;/ref&gt;  As Carlos Scolari states, “the configuration of media ecology in the 1960s and 1970s was part of a broader process of the general application of the ecological metaphor to the social sciences and humanities in the postwar period.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; There is still a scholarly debate over who coined the phrase “the medium is the message”. Author Niall Stephan argues that while most attribute the  metaphor to Marshall McLuhan, it is better directed to Neil Postman, who helped popularize McLuhan under the banner of “media ecology”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stephens|first=Niall|date=2014|title=Toward a More Substantive Media Ecology: Postman's Metaphor Versus Posthuman Futures|url=|journal=International Journal of Communications|volume=8|pages=2027-2045|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholar [[Janet Sternburg|Janet Sternberg]] has a different take on the metaphor- using her own metaphor to make sense of it all. Sternberg applies the Chinese “yin/ yang” metaphor to media ecology as a means of better understanding the divergence among scholars. She states that there are two basic intellectual traditions can be distinguished in the field: the “yang” tradition of studying media as environments, focusing on mass communication and on [[intrapersonal communication]] and the “yin” tradition is studying environments as media, emphasizing interpersonal communication.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v3/Sternberg03.pdf|title=The Yin and Yang of Media Ecology|last=Sternberg|first=Janet|date=2002|year=|website=MEA Convention Proceedings|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Connection to general systems theory ====
While [[general systems theory]] originated in 1928 in the Ph.D. thesis of [[Ludwig von Bertalanffy]]. Robert Logan summarizes a general system as "one that is composed of interacting and interrelated components such as an understanding of it must entail considering the general system as a whole and not as a collection of individual components".&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://summit.is4is.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/logan3text.pdf|title=General Systems Theory and Media Ecology: Parallel Disciplines that Inform Each Other|date=June 2015|doi=10.1386/eme.14.1-2.39_1|author=Robert Logan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Logan argues that general systems theory, as well as cybernetics, complexity theory, and emergent dynamics, and media ecology "cross pollinate each other" in that,  "a general system is a medium" due to the non-linear aspects of messages and that general systems are "quasi-deterministic".&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

This thinking is in line with McLuhan who once wrote, "A new medium is never an addition to an old one, nor does it leave the old one in peace. It never ceases to oppress the older media until it finds new shapes and positions for them."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Global village ===
Marshall McLuhan used the phrase [[Global village (term)|global village]] to describe that "humans can no longer live in isolation, but rather will always be connected by continuous and instantaneous [[electronic media]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Introducing communication theory: analysis and application|last=West|first=Richard|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780073385075|pages=432}}&lt;/ref&gt; McLuhan addresses the idea of a global village in his book ''[[The Gutenberg Galaxy]]'' saying, "Such is the character of a village or, since electric media, such is also the character of global village. And it is the advertising and PR community that is most aware of this basic new dimension of global interdependence".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Tremblay|first1=Gaetan|title=From Marshall McLuhan to Harold Innis, or From the Global Village to the World Empire|journal=Canadian Journal of Communications|date=2012|volume=37|issue=4|page=572|url=http://www.cjc-online.ca/index.php/journal/article/view/2662/2341}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Technology, especially electronic media in today's age, makes the world increasingly interconnected. Socially, economically, politically, culturally, what happens in one part of the world has a ripple effect into other countries.

This seems like a common sense idea today, where the internet makes it possible to check news stories around the globe, and social media connects individuals regardless of location. However, in McLuhan's day, the global village was just becoming possible due to technology like television and long distance phone calls. This concept has become one of the most prolific and understandable ideas to come out of media ecology, and has spurred significant research in many areas. It is especially relevant in today's society, where the internet, social media, and other new media have made the world a smaller place, and today many researchers give McLuhan credit for his foresight.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author1=Walkosz, Barbara J.|author2=Tessa Jolls|author3= Mary Ann Sund|title=Global/Local: Media Literacy for the Global Village|work=Medialit.org|conference= Proc. of International Media Literacy Research Forum, London|publisher=OfCom|year=2008|url=http://www.medialit.org/sites/default/files/33_globallocal.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Of note is McLuhan's insistence that the world becoming a global village should lead to more global responsibility. Technology has created an interconnected world, and with that should come concern for global events and occurrences outside one's own community.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Postman builds on this concept with the idea of teaching the narrative of 'Spaceship Earth' where students are taught the importance of everyone taking care of planet earth as a fragile system of diversity both biological and cultural;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://hepg.org/her-home/issues/harvard-educational-review-volume-66-issue-4/herarticle/redefining-the-value-of-school_287|title=The Harvard Educational Review - HEPG|website=hepg.org|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, the original person to coin the term 'Spaceship Earth' was futurists R. Buckminster Fuller who once said, "I've often heard people say: 'I wonder what it would feel like to board a spaceship,' and the answer is very simple. What does it feel like? That's all we have experienced. We're all astronauts on a little spaceship called earth."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bfi.org/about-fuller/big-ideas/spaceshipearth|title=Spaceship Earth {{!}} The Buckminster Fuller Institute|website=www.bfi.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics do worry though, that in creating a truly global village, some cultures will become extinct due to larger or more dominant cultures imposing their beliefs and practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=K|first=Dixon, Violet|date=2009-01-01|title=Understanding the Implications of a Global Village|url=http://www.inquiriesjournal.com/articles/61/understanding-the-implications-of-a-global-village|journal=Inquiries Journal|volume=1|issue=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea of the global village helps to conceptualize [[globalization]] within society. Michael Plugh writes, "[The] village is an environment produced both by technological change and human imagination of this globalized environment."&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Global village: Globalization through a media ecology lens|date=2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|issue=3-4|pages=219–235|doi=10.1386/eme.13.3-4.219_1|author=Plugh, Michael}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, the rise in media communication technology has uniformed the way individuals across the globe process information. Plugh says, "Where literate societies exchange an 'eye for an ear,' according to McLuhan, emphasizing the linear and sequential order of the world, electronic technology retrievers the total awareness of environment, characteristic of oral cultures, yet to an extended or 'global' level."&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

===Hot vs. cool media===
McLuhan developed an idea called hot and cold media.&lt;ref&gt;McLuhan, Marshall, and Quentin Fiore. "The medium is the message." New York 123 (1967): 126-128.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hot media]] refer to a high-definition communication that demand little involvement from the audience and concentrate on one sensory organ at a time. These types of media require no interpretation because they give all the information necessary to comprehend. Some examples of hot media include radio, books, and lectures. [[Cool media]] describe media that demand active involvement from the audience. Cool media require the audience to be active and fill in information by mentally participating. This is multi-sensory participation. Some examples of cool media are TV, seminars, and cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|title=Understanding media: The Extension of Man|year=1994|publisher=The MIT Press|location=Massachusetts|isbn=978-0-262-63159-4|author2=Lewis H. Lapham}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"McLuhan frequently referred to a chart that hung in his seminar room at the University of Toronto. This was a type of shorthand for understanding the differences between hot and cool media, characterized by their emphasis on the eye or the ear."&lt;ref&gt;Harold Innis: The Philosophical Historian. An Exchange of Ideas Between Prof. Marshall McLuhan and Prof. Eric A. Havelock," recorded at Innis College, Toronto, October 14, 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Eye'': left hemisphere (hot) controls right side of the body; visual; speech; verbal; analytical; mathematical; linear; detailed; sequential; controlled; intellectual; dominant worldly;quantitative; active; sequential ordering
* ''Ear:'' right hemisphere (cool) controls the left side of the body; spatial; musical; acoustic; holistic; artistic; symbolic; simultaneous; emotional; creative; minor; spiritual; qualitative; receptive; synthetic; gestalt; facial recognition; simultaneous comprehension; perception of abstract patterns

===Laws of media===
Another aspect of media ecology is the ''laws of media,'' which McLuhan outlined with his son [[Eric McLuhan]] to further explain the influence of technology on society.&lt;ref name="Laws of media"&gt;{{cite book|title=Laws of media: The new science|last=McLuhan|first=Marshall|publisher=University of Toronto Press|year=1988|isbn=978-0-8020-7715-8|location=Toronto|pages=98–99|author2=Eric McLuhan}}&lt;/ref&gt; The laws of media theory are depicted by a tetrad, which poses questions about various media, with the goal of developing peoples' critical thinking skills and to prepare people for "the social and physical chaos" that accompany every technological advancement or development. There is no specific order to the laws of media, as the effects occur simultaneously and form a feedback loop: technology impacts society, which then impacts the development of technology.
[[File:MediaTetrad.svg|thumb|Depiction of Media Tetrad]]
The four effects, as depicted in the [[tetrad of media effects]] are:&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt;
* ''Enhancement'': What does the medium enhance? Media can enhance various social interactions, such as the telephone, which reduced the need for face-to-face interactions.
* ''Obsolescence'': What does the medium obsolesce? Technological advancements can render older media obsolete, as television did for the radio. This does not necessarily mean that the older medium is completely eradicated however, as radio, for example, is still in use today. 
* ''Retrieval'': What does the medium retrieve? New media can also spur a restoration of older forms of media, which the new forms may not be able to incorporate into their new technologies. For example, the Internet has promoted new forms of social conversations, which may have been lost through television. 
* ''Reversal'': What will the medium reverse? When a medium is overwhelmed due to its own nature, "pushed to the limit of its potential,"&lt;ref name="Laws of media" /&gt; it ceases to have functional utility and can cause a reversion to older media.

==Criticism==

===Technological determinism===
A significant criticism of this theory is a result of its deterministic approach. [[Determinism]] insists that all of society is a result of or effected by one central condition. In some cases the condition can be language ([[linguistic determinism]]), religion ([[theological determinism]]), financial ([[economic determinism]]). In the case of McLuhan, Postman and Media Ecology, technology is the sole determinant for society and by breaking up time in measures of man's technological achievements they can be classified as [[technological determinism]]. According to Postman, "The printing press, the computer, and television are not therefore simply machines which convey information. They are metaphors through which we conceptualize reality in one way or another. They will classify the world for us, sequence it, frame it, enlarge it, reduce it, argue a case for what it is like. Through these media metaphors, we do not see the world as it is. We see it as our coding systems are. Such is the power of the form of information."&lt;ref&gt;Postman, Teaching as a Conserving Activity (1979), p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; Postman has also stated that "a medium is a technology within which a culture grows; that is to say, it gives form to a culture's politics, social organization, and habitual ways of thinking".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Postman|first=Neil|title=The Humanism of Media Ecology|url=http://media-ecology.org/publications/MEA_proceedings/v1/humanism_of_media_ecology.html|accessdate=9 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Scholars such as [[Michael Zimmer (academic)|Michael Zimmer]] view McLuhan and his "Medium is the Message" theory as a prime example of technological determinism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;...an overarching thread in media ecological scholarship, exemplified by McLuhan's (1964/1994) assertion 
that "the medium is the message", the technological bias of a medium carries greater importance than the particular message it is delivering. McLuhan saw changes in the dominant medium of communication as the main determinant of major changes in society, culture, and the individual. This McLuhanesque logic, which rests at the center of the media ecology tradition, is often criticized for its media determinism. Seeing the biases of media technologies as the primary force for social and cultural change resembles the hard technological determinism of the embodied theory of technological bias.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|author=Zimmer, Michael|authorlink=Michael Zimmer (academic)|title=Media Ecology and Value Sensitive Design: A Combined Approach to Understanding the Biases of Media Technology|conference=Proceedings of the Media Ecology Association|volume=6|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The critics of such a deterministic approach could be theorists who practice other forms of determinism, such as economic determinism. Theorists such as John Fekete believes that McLuhan is oversimplifying the world "by denying that human action is itself responsible for the changes that our socio-cultural world is undergoing and will undergo, McLuhan necessarily denies that a critical attitude is morally significant or practically important."&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Fekete, John|title=McLuhanacy: Counterrevolution in cultural theory|journal=Telos|year=1973|volume=1973|issue=15|pp=75–123|doi=10.3817/0373015075}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lance Strate]], on the other hand, argues that McLuhan's theories are in no way deterministic. "McLuhan never actually used the term, "determinism," nor did he argue against human agency. In his bestselling book, ''The Medium is the Message'', he wrote, "there is absolutely no inevitability as long as there is a willingness to contemplate what is happening" (McLuhan &amp; Fiore, 1967, p.&amp;nbsp;25). John Culkin (1967) summed up McLuhan's position with the quote, "we shape our tools and thereafter they shape us",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Culkin, J.|year=1967|chapter=Each culture develops its own sense ratio to meet the demands of its environment|editor=G. Stearn|title=McLuhan: Hot and cool|pp=49–57|location=New York: New American Library}}&lt;/ref&gt; suggesting a transactional approach to media."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strate, Lance|title=Studying media as media: McLuhan and the media ecology approach|journal=MediaTropes|volume=1|issue=1|year=2008|p=133|url=http://www.mediatropes.com/index.php/Mediatropes/article/view/3344/1488}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement from Strate would define McLuhan and Media Ecology as "[[soft determinism]]" opposed to "[[hard determinism]]" with the difference being that "hard determinism" indicates that changes to society happen with no input or control from the members of that society, whereas "soft determinism" would argue that the changes are pushed by technology but free will and agency of the members of society ultimately have a chance to influence the outcome.

While ideas of technological determinism generally have negative connotations, technology philosopher Paul-Peter Verbeek argued that technologies are "inherently moral agents" and their development is a "moral enterprise".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cussing the buzz-saw, or, the medium is the morality of Peter-Paul Verbeek|date=2016|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=2|pages=129–139|doi=10.1386/eme.15.2.129_1|author=Grosswiler, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Can Technological Artefacts Be Moral Agents?|date=2011|publisher=|journal=Science and Engineering Ethics|volume=17|issue=3|pages=411–424|doi=10.1007/s11948-010-9241-3|pmid=20927601|pmc=3183318}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Peter-Paul Verbeek|title=Obstetric Ultrasound and the Technological Mediation of Morality: A Postphenomenological Analysis|date=1 March 2008|publisher=|journal=Human Studies|volume=31|issue=1|pages=11–26|doi=10.1007/s10746-007-9079-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Disruptions to existing systems ===
While advancing technologies allow for the study of media ecology, they also frequently disrupt the existing system of communication as they emerge. In general, four types of disruption can occur within the study of media ecology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.waccglobal.org/articles/a-shifting-media-ecology-what-the-age-of-luther-can-teach-us|title=A shifting media ecology: What the age of Luther can teach us|journal=Media Development|date=2017|volume=64|issue=2|pp=5–10|author=Soukup, Paul A.}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
# New Technologies
# New Audiences
# New Authority
#New Rhetoric

One example where this can be seen is in do-it-yourself education. Advancing technologies have also expanded access to do-it-yourself (DIY) education. DIY education can be defined to include "any attempt to decentralize or disrupt traditional place-based educational models through the sometimes collective, other times individual use of digital media".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=A media ecological analysis of do-it-yourself education: Exploring relationships between the symbolic and the material realms of human action|author=John Dowd|doi=10.1386/eme.13.2.155_1|date=June 2014|publisher=Intellect|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=13|number=2|pp=155–175(21)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Through an analysis of media ecology the impact of these new technologies on society can better be understood.

==== Mobility and Modality ====
Various scholars have looked to media ecology theory through different lenses to better understand this theory in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt; century. While Sternberg applied the yin/yang metaphor to make sense of the theory, Julia Hildebrand and John Dimmick et. al create a new languages of modality. As such, contributing to a new rhetoric to contextualize Media Ecology in the age of the internet, social media, and advances in technologies. Hildebrand uses the conceptualization of ‘mediated mobilities’ to illustrate a connection between media ecology and mobilities research, ultimately making a case for a ''modal medium theory''. She looks into the articles of Emily Keightley and Anna Reading, and Lance Strate as a basis for her case. In 1999, Lance Strate states Media Ecology Theory is “grammar and rhetoric, semiotics and systems theory, the history and the philosophy of technology”.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hildebrand|first=Julia M|date=2017-05-11|title=Modal media: connecting media ecology and mobilities research|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/0163443717707343|journal=Media, Culture &amp; Society|language=en|volume=40|issue=3|pages=348–364|doi=10.1177/0163443717707343|issn=0163-4437}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hildebrand explains that Strate’s concept of media ecology is not limited to the study of information and communication technology but technology, in general. Technology is therefore implying materialities and mobilities that is put into relation with media ecology. As Hildebrand states, “[e]nvironments are created and shaped by different media and modes and the physical, virtual, and mental processes and travels they generate”.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Much like Media Ecology, mobilities research talk about a “flow” that shapes the environment, creating a contact zones. Dimmick furthers this statement by creating a term that describes the intersection of communication environments (“contact zones”) and issues of mobility- ''interstices.''&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dimmick|first=John|last2=Feaster|first2=John Christian|last3=Hoplamazian|first3=Gregory J.|date=2010-05-18|title=News in the interstices: The niches of mobile media in space and time|url=https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1461444810363452|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=13|issue=1|pages=23–39|doi=10.1177/1461444810363452|issn=1461-4448}}&lt;/ref&gt; He quotes two scholars, Hemment and Caronia, to contextualize his new word. Hemment argues that mobile technologies create a place out of space and time, a kind of “nonspace” or “nonplace” considering they are independent from the variables of space and time. Caronia notes that such technologies extend media to creating empty space and places.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;

===The medium is not the message===
McLuhan's critics state the medium is not the message. They believe that we are dealing with a mathematical equation where medium equals x and message equals y. Accordingly, x = y, but really "the medium is the message" is a metaphor not an equation.  His critics also believe McLuhan is denying the content altogether, when really McLuhan was just trying to show the content in its secondary role in relation to the medium. McLuhan says technology is an "extension of man" and when the way we physically sense the world changes, how we perceive it will also collectively change, but the content may or may not affect this change in perception. McLuhan said that the user is the content, and this means that the user must interpret and process what they receive, finding sense in their own environments.&lt;ref name=Grosswiler&gt;{{cite book|last=Grosswiler|first=Paul|title=Transforming McLuhan: Cultural, Critical, and Postmodern Perspectives|year=2010|publisher=Peter Lang|location=p.52|isbn=9781433110672|pages=238}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of McLuhan's high profile critics was [[Umberto Eco]]. Eco comes from background in [[semiotics]], which goes beyond linguistics in that it studies all forms of communication. He reflected that a cartoon of a cannibal wearing an alarm clock as a necklace was counter to McLuhan's assertion that the invention of clocks created a concept of time as consistently separated space. While it could mean this it could also take on different meanings as in the depiction of the cannibal. The medium is not the message. An individual's interpretation can vary.  Believing this to be true Eco says, "It is equally untrue that acting on the form and content of the message can convert the person receiving it." In doing this Eco merges form and content, the separation of which is the basis of McLuhan's assertion. McLuhan does not offer a theory of communication. He instead investigates the effects of all media mediums between the human body and its physical environment, including language.&lt;ref name=Gordon&gt;{{cite book|last=Gordon|first=W. Terrance|title=McLuhan: A Guide for the Perplexed|year=2010|publisher=Continuum International Publishing|location=London, GBR|isbn=9781441143808|pages=214}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Others===

The North American variant of media ecology is viewed by numerous theorists such as John Fekete&lt;ref name="Fekete, John 1973"/&gt; and Neil Compton as meaningless or "McLuhanacy". According to Compton, it had been next to impossible to escape knowing about McLuhan and his theory as the media embraced them. Compton wrote, "it would be better for McLuhan if his oversimplifications did not happen to coincide with the pretensions of young status-hungry advertising executives and producers, who eagerly provide him with a ready-made claque, exposure on the media, and a substantial income from addresses and conventions."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal&gt;{{cite book|last=Rosenthal|first=Raymond|title=McLuhan: Pro and Con|year=1968|publisher=Funk &amp; Wagnalls|location=New York|pages=308}}&lt;/ref&gt; Theorists such as [[Jonathan Miller]] claim that McLuhan used a subjective approach to make objective claims, comparing McLuhan's willingness to back away from a "probe" if he did not find the desired results to that of an objective scientist who would not abandon it so easily.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;{{cite book|last=Miller|first=Jonathan|title=Marshall McLuhan|year=1971|publisher=Viking Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0670019120|pages=133}}&lt;/ref&gt; These theorists against McLuhan's idea, such as [[Raymond Rosenthal]], also believe that he lacked the scientific evidence to support his claims:&lt;ref name='Strate'/&gt; "McLuhan's books are not scientific in any respect; they are wrapped however in the dark, mysterious folds of the scientific ideology."&lt;ref name=Rosenthal /&gt; Additionally, As [[Lance Strate]] said: "Other critics complain that media ecology scholars like McLuhan, Havelock, and Ong put forth a "Great Divide" theory, exaggerating, for example, the difference between orality and literacy, or the alphabet and hieroglyphics.

==Research ==

===New media===
Many ecologists are using media ecology as an analytical framework, to explore whether the current [[new media]] has a "new" stranglehold on culture or are they simply extensions of what we have already experienced. The new media is characterised by the idea of [[web 2.0]]. It was coined in 2003 and popularized by a media consultant, [[Tim O'Reilly]]. He argues that a particular assemblage of software, hardware and sociality have brought about 'the widespread sense that there's something qualitatively different about today's Web. This shift is characterised by co-creativity, participation and openness, represented by software that support for example, wiki-based ways of creating and accessing knowledge, social networking sites, blogging, tagging and 'mash ups'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=O'Reilly|first=Tim|title=What Is Web 2.0? Design Patterns and Business Models for the Next Generation of Software|url=http://radar.oreilly.com/2005/09/what-is-web-20.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interactive and user-oriented nature of these technologies have transformed the global culture into a [[participatory culture]] which proves Neil Postman's saying "[[Wikiversity:Neil Postman: Five Things We Need to Know About Technological Change|technological change]] is not additive; it is ecological".

As new media power takes on new dimension in the digital realm, some scholars begin to focus on defending the democratic potentialities of the Internet on the perspective of corporate impermeability. Today, corporate encroachment in cyberspace is changing the balance of power in the new media ecology, which "portends a new set of social relationships based on commercial exploitation".&lt;ref name=Milberry&gt;{{cite journal|last=Milberry|first=K|author2=Anderson, S.|title=Open Sourcing Our Way to an Online Commons: Contesting Corporate Impermeability in the New Media Ecology|journal=Journal of Communication Inquiry|year=2009|pages=393–412|volume=33|issue=4|doi=10.1177/0196859909340349}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many social network websites inject customized advertisements into the steady stream of personal communication. It is called commercial incursion which converts user-generated content into fodder for marketers and advertisers.&lt;ref name=Milberry/&gt; So the control rests with the owners rather than the participants. It is necessary for online participants to be prepared to act consciously to resist the enclosure of digital commons.

There is some recent research that puts the emphasis on the youth, the future of the society who is at the forefront of new media environment. Each generation, with its respective worldview, is equipped with certain media grammar and [[media literacy]] in its youth.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gumpert|first=Gary|author2=Robert Cathcart|title=Media grammars, generations, and media gaps|journal=Critical Studies in Mass Communication|year=1985|volume=2|pages=23–35|doi=10.1080/15295038509360059}}&lt;/ref&gt; As each generation inherits an idiosyncratic media structure, those born into the age of radio perceive the world differently from those born into the age of television.&lt;ref name="Gumpert 1985 23–35"/&gt; The nature of new generation is also influenced by the nature of the new media.

According to the media ecology theory, analyzing today's generational identity through the lens of media technologies themselves can be more productive than focusing on media content. Media ecologists employ a media ecology interpretative framework to deconstruct how today's new media environment increasingly mirrors the values and character attributed to young people. Here are some typical characteristics of the new generation: first, it is "the world's first generation to grow up thinking of itself as global. The internet and satellite television networks are just two of the myriad technologies that have made this possible."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huntley|first=Rebecca|title=The World According to Y: Inside the New Adult Generation|year=2006|publisher=Crows Nest NSW|location=Australia|pages=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Second, "there may actually be no unified ethos".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Serazio|first=Michael|title=(New) Media Ecology and Generation Mash-Up Identity: The Technological Bias of Millennial Youth Culture|url=http://citation.allacademic.com/meta/p_mla_apa_research_citation/2/3/8/6/6/p238668_index.html|conference= NCA 94th Annual Convention}}&lt;/ref&gt;  With "hundreds of cable channels and thousands of computer conferences, young generation might be able to isolate themselves within their own extremely opinionated forces".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Rushkoff|first=Douglas|title=Screenagers: Lessons In Chaos From Digital Kids|year=2006|publisher=Hampton Press|location=Cresskill, NJ|isbn=978-1572736245|pages=79}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===
In 2009 a study was published by Cleora D'Arcy, Darin Eastburn and Bertram Bruce entitled "How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=D'Arcy, C. J.|author2=Eastburn, D. M.|author3=Bruce, B. C.|lastauthoramp=y|year=2009|title=How Media Ecologies Can Address Diverse Student Needs|journal=College Teaching|volume=57|issue=1|pp=56–63|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/274764053|doi=10.3200/CTCH.57.1.56-63}}&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of this study was to use Media Ecology in order to determine which media is perceived as the most useful as an instructional tool in post-secondary education. This study specifically analyzed and tested "new media" such as podcasts, blogs, websites, and discussion forums with other media, such as traditional text books, lectures, and handouts. Ultimately comparing "hot" and "cold" media at today's standard of the terms. The result of the study, which included student surveys, indicated that a mixture of media was the most "valued" method of instruction, however more interactive media enhanced student learning.

==Application and Case Studies ==
There is significant research being done on the rise of [[social media]] platforms such as Twitter, Instagram, Facebook and their influence on communication in society. Some of that research is being done through a media ecology perspective. Below are some examples: 

=== Social media activism ===
While many people utilize social media platforms to stay in contact with friends and family, socialize, or even shop,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Correa|first=Teresa|last2=Hinsley|first2=Amber Willard|last3=de Zúñiga|first3=Homero Gil|date=2010-03-01|title=Who interacts on the Web?: The intersection of users' personality and social media use|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563209001472|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=26|issue=2|pages=247–253|doi=10.1016/j.chb.2009.09.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; these platforms have also been pivotal for social activism. [[Social media activism]] and [[hashtag activism]] have become popular ways to gain mainstream media and public attention for causes, and to facilitate protests.

Thomas Poell researched the influence of social media on the 2010 protests of the [[2010 G20 Toronto summit|Toronto G20 Summit]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Poell|first=Thomas|year=2014|title=Social media and the transformation of activist communication: exploring the social media ecology of the 2010 Toronto G20 protests|url=|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|volume=17|issue=6|pages=716–731|via=|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2013.812674}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the article, he focused on identifying how each social media site was used independently, and then how they were integrated together. The sites analyzed were [[Twitter]], [[YouTube]], [[Flickr|Flikr]], Facebook, and an open publishing website. What he found is that each site is used differently for social media activism. While this kind of activism was originally looked at as a way to promote causes and encourage long term focus on the issues, Poell found that sites like Twitter and Facebook tend to do the opposite. Posts center around photographs and videos of action during protests and rallies, not on the issues that are being protested. This would be an example of hot media, because the user can scroll through photos or watch videos without being otherwise engaged, instead of cool media where the user has to be more involved. Additionally, because activists are using sites they do not own, the social media platform actually has more control over the information being posted. For example, Twitter no longer allows unrestricted access to all posts made with a certain hashtag after a period of time. This seems to mean that the issue being highlighted fades over time.

Additionally, Heather Crandall and Carolyn M. Cunningham focus on hashtag activism, where activists use [[Tag (metadata)|metadata tags]] to focus on specific issues (ex: #activism).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Crandall|first=Heather|last2=Cunningham|first2=Carolyn M.|year=2016|title=Media ecology and hashtag activism: #Kaleidoscope|url=|journal=Explorations in Media Ecology|volume=15|issue=1|pages=22–32|doi=10.1386/eme.15.1.21_1|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They did not look at one specific protest like the G20 summit, but rather at the benefits and criticisms of hashtag activism as a whole. They discuss that social media is a new media ecology, one where users can connect and share ideas without boundaries. This falls under McLuhan's idea of the world as a global village. By using hashtags, activists are able to bring awareness to social issues. Crandall and Cunningham point out that this is both beautiful and interesting, because it encourages learning, conversations, and community for social justice, and that it is also dark and confusing, because the open environment of the internet also allows hashtags to be used for hate speech and threats of violence. Also, they posit that hashtag activism is pointed and stacked, in that hashtags are often short lived, and the user has to be able to navigate the platform and understand hashtags in order to gain knowledge of the issue. When viewed through media ecology, hashtag activism is changing the way people encounter and engage in social justice.

=== Case Studies ===

==== [[Arab Spring]]: Egypt and Iran ====
Doctor Mark Allen Peterson of in the Department of Anthropology at Miami University published an article in the Summer of 2011 comparing the media ecology of 1970's Iran to that in Egypt in 2011. The article, title "Egypt's Media Ecology in a Time of Revolution"&lt;ref name=Peterson&gt;Peterson, Mark Allen. "Egypt's media ecology in a time of revolution." Arab media &amp; society 13 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; looks at the difference that social media made in the Egyptian uprising and makes two observations: social media extends the "[[Grapevine (gossip)|grapevine]]" network and that social media, despite the result of the uprising, completely changes the "[[mediascape]]" of Egypt. One dramatic difference between the two uprising noticed by Peterson is the ultimate position of the media of choice during each in the end. On the one hand, Iran's news media, the primary source of information at that time, reverted to its original role, while the Egyptian use of social media changed the media of choice for Egypt.

Peterson's study compared his observations to that of William Beeman, who in 1984 published an essay, "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after"&lt;ref name=Beeman&gt;Beeman, William O. "The cultural role of the media in Iran: The revolution of 1978–1979 and after." The news media and national and international conflict (1984): 147-165.&lt;/ref&gt; on the media ecology of Iran. Beeman's ultimate conclusion of his review of the [[Iranian Revolution]] followed that of what you would expect to find from most media ecologists: "At times newly introduced mass media have produced revolutionary effects in the societal management of time and energy as they forged new spaces for themselves. Thus media are cultural forces as well as cultural objects. In operation, they produce specific cultural effects that cannot be easily predicted."&lt;ref name=Beeman/&gt;{{rp|147}}

Although there were many similarities between the Iranian and [[Egyptian Revolution of 2011|Egyptian revolutions]], such as censorship in media, including newspaper and television, the one major difference was the availability of the internet and social media as a tool to spread messages and increase awareness in Egypt. Social media in 2011's uprising was equivalent to the use of cassette tapes in Iran in the 1970s. The tapes provided a way to spread information that could not be as easily censored and was repeatable through the country.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}} The rise of social media helped free Egyptians from censorship of other media. In this case, the medium was the message, a message of freedom and by the Egyptian government's attempt to also censor this medium, they only managed to spread the message further and faster:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Although we may never know the true impact, in fact it likely sped up the regime's fall. In the absence of new technologies, people were forced to rely on traditional means of communication, including knocking on doors, going to the mosque, assembling in the street, or other central gathering places. Thomas Schelling won a Nobel prize in part for discovering that in the absence of information, people will coordinate by selecting a focal point that seems natural, special or relevant to them. Given the protests, Tahrir Square was the obvious focal point. By blocking the Internet, the government inadvertently fueled dissent and galvanized international support for the people of Egypt. (Bowman 2011)&lt;ref&gt;Bowman, Warigia. 2011. Dictators and the Internet. Cairo Review of Global Affairs. http://www.aucegypt.edu/GAPP/CairoReview/Pages/articleDetails.aspx?aid=34 [accessed November 14, 2013]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Since 2011, leaders of the protest continue to utilize social media as a method to push democratic reform.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|4}} According to Peterson the role of social media in Egypt is also evolving the political culture as even state figures are beginning to make announcements using social media rather than more traditional forms of media.&lt;ref name=Peterson/&gt;{{rp|5}}

==== [[Gezi Park protests|Gezi Protests]]: Turkey  ====
Much like the Arab Spring, the Gezi protests were an environmental sit-in that ultimately turned into a social movement based on the influence of various forms of social media. Rolien Hoyng and Murat Es coin the term “Turkish media ecology” to evoke a sense of particularly on the part of Turkey’s relationship with media outlets and platforms.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ijoc.org/index.php/ijoc|title=Conspiratorial Webs: Media Ecology and Parallel Realities in Turkey|last=Hoyng|first=Rolien|last2=Es|first2=Murat|date=2016|website=International Journal of Communications|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Turkey, media censorship and control by state institutions most directly impact broadcast media. Both authors emphasize how “…media-ecological affordances are conditioned and modulated by legal frameworks and institutional-political rationalities”.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They also note that such censored media ecology forms a ‘fertile milieu’ for the proliferation of conspiracy theories which both feed on one another.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; Scholar Gulizar Haciyakupoglu examines how social media influenced the protests, specifically looking at how trust was built and maintained among protestors across multiple platforms.&lt;ref name=":13"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haciyakupoglu|first=Gulizar|last2=Zhang|first2=Weiyu|date=2015-03-18|title=Social Media and Trust during the Gezi Protests in Turkey|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/20/4/450/4067584|journal=Journal of Computer-Mediated Communication|language=en|volume=20|issue=4|pages=450–466|doi=10.1111/jcc4.12121|issn=1083-6101}}&lt;/ref&gt; From his interviews, the scholar extrapolates that “closed groups” like Whatsapp and Facebook “…allowed the circulation of confidential and trustworthy information among first- and second-degree friends” whereas Twitter was used for “rapid acquisition of logistic information” that became important during the protest.&lt;ref name=":13" /&gt; 

====[[Anti-austerity movement in Spain|15M Movement]]: Spain  ====
Emiliano Treré looks to the Media Ecology metaphor as a way to investigate the relationship between social movements, media ecologies and communication technologies through the lens of Spain’s 15M movement. Treré states how most scholars believe the media ecological framework is particularly suited for the study of the social movements/media nexus “…because of its ability to provide fine-tuned explorations of the multiplicity, the interconnections, the dynamic evolution of old and new media forms for social change”.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treré|first=Emiliano|last2=Mattoni|first2=Alice|date=2015-11-25|title=Media ecologies and protest movements: main perspectives and key lessons|url=https://doi.org/10.1080/1369118X.2015.1109699|journal=Information, Communication &amp; Society|language=en|volume=19|issue=3|pages=290–306|doi=10.1080/1369118x.2015.1109699|issn=1369-118X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The author also agrees with Scolari (mentioned above) that the key reflections from the theory is especially beneficial for modern analysis on media and social events.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; One such application is seen with the analysis of Spain’s anti-austerity movement, also called the “15M movement.” Facing different degrees of mainstream media manipulation and bias “various media activists turned to Web TV services, radical online tools, Twitter and Facebook among others to organize, and contrast the official narratives of the protest."&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Scholar John Postill argues that Twitter, among all the types of technologies used, produced a greater effect for setting and tone and agenda of the movement.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Postill|first=John|date=2013-10-23|title=Democracy in an age of viral reality: A media epidemiography of Spain’s indignados movement|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1466138113502513|journal=Ethnography|language=en|volume=15|issue=1|pages=51–69|doi=10.1177/1466138113502513|issn=1466-1381}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such appropriation of technologies demonstrates the dichotomies between old and new technologies that in term created a kind of “technological sovereignty” among activists.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; Media Ecology has the innate ability to aggregate different analytical approaches to better understand the technology that is at place during such a protest. Postill and other scholars ultimately look to a new age in social activism, where “viral” posts shared by media professionals and amateurs empower people and become the rising voice for the future of democracy in Spain.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

A '''midden''' (also '''kitchen midden''' or '''shell heap''') is an old [[landfill|dump for domestic waste]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Brinton | first = DG | title =Artificial Shell-deposits of the United States | work = Reports | publisher= [[Smithsonian Institution]] | location=Washington | year=1866}}&lt;/ref&gt; which may consist of  animal [[bone]], [[feces|human excrement]], [[botanical]] material, [[mollusc shell]]s, [[sherd]]s, [[Lithic flake|lithics]] (especially [[debitage]]), and other [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]]s and [[ecofact]]s associated with past human occupation.

These [[Feature (archaeology)|features]], therefore, provide a useful resource for [[archaeologist]]s who wish to study the [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and habits of past societies. Middens with damp, [[Hypoxia (environmental)|anaerobic]] conditions can even preserve [[Organic material|organic]] remains in deposits as the debris of daily life are tossed on the pile. Each individual toss will contribute a different mix of materials depending upon the activity associated with that particular toss. During the course of deposition sedimentary material is deposited as well. Different mechanisms, from wind and water to animal digs, create a matrix which can also be analyzed to provide seasonal and climatic information. In some middens individual dumps of material can be discerned and analysed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stein |first=Julie  |title=Exploring Coast Salish Prehistory: The Archaeology of San Juan Island |year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Shell middens==
[[File:Whaleback Shell Midden gully - 20070722 07986.JPG|thumb|The [[Whaleback Shell Midden]] in [[Maine]] resulted from oyster harvesting from 200 BC to 1000 AD.]]

A '''shell midden''' or '''shell mound''' is an [[archaeological]] feature consisting mainly of [[mollusk]] shells. The Danish term ''køkkenmøddinger'' (plural) was first used by [[Japetus Steenstrup]] to describe shell heaps and continues to be used by some researchers. A midden, by definition, contains the debris of human activity, and should not be confused with wind or tide created beach mounds. Some shell middens are processing remains: areas where aquatic resources were processed directly after harvest and prior to use or storage in a distant location.

Some shell middens are directly associated with villages, as a designated village dump site. In other middens, the material is directly associated with a house in the village. Each household would dump its garbage directly outside the house. In all cases, shell middens are extremely complex and very difficult to excavate fully and exactly. The fact that they contain a detailed record of what food was eaten or processed and many fragments of [[stone tools]] and household goods makes them invaluable objects of [[archaeological]] study.

Shells have a high [[calcium carbonate]] content, which tends to make the middens [[alkaline]]. This slows the normal rate of decay caused by soil acidity, leaving a relatively high proportion of organic material (food remnants, organic tools, clothing, human remains) available for archaeologists to find.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title=Whaleback Shell Midden | work=Whaleback Shell Midden | url=http://www.maine.gov/doc/parks/programs/history/whaleback/index.htm | accessdate=2006-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Edward Sylvester Morse]] conducted one of the first archaeological excavations of shellmounds in [[Omori]], Japan in 1877, which led to the discovery of a style of pottery described as "cord-marked", translated as "[[Jōmon pottery|Jōmon]]", which came to be used to refer to the early period of [[Japanese prehistory|Japanese history]] when this style of pottery was produced.&lt;ref name="Hall1988"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Whitney Hall|title=The Cambridge History of Japan|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A3_6lp8IOK8C&amp;pg=PA61|year=1988|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-22352-2|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.um.u-tokyo.ac.jp/publish_db/2000dm2k/english/02/02-03.html|title=Collections of Morse  from The Shell Mounds of Omori|work=Digital Museum, University of Tokyo|author=Keiji Imamura|accessdate=4 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shell middens were studied in Denmark in the latter half of the 19th century. The Danish word ''køkkenmødding'' (kitchen mound) is now used internationally. The English word "midden" (waste mound) derives from the same Old Norse word that produced the modern Danish one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?allowed_in_frame=0&amp;search=midden&amp;searchmode=none|title=Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Examples===
[[File:TurtleMound1970 FPS1191.jpg|thumb|The [[Turtle Mound]] shell midden, in [[Florida]], is the largest on the US East Coast.]]

Shell middens are found in coastal zones all over the world. Consisting mostly of [[mollusc]] shells, they are interpreted as being the waste products of meals eaten by nomadic groups or hunting parties. Some are small examples relating to meals had by a handful of individuals, others are many metres in length and width and represent centuries of shell deposition. In [[Brazil]], they are known as ''sambaquis'', having been created over a long period between the 6th millennium BC and the beginning of European colonisation.

On [[Canada]]'s west coast, there are shell middens that run for more than a kilometer along the coast and are several meters deep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Stein |first=Julie  |title=Deciphering a Shell Midden |year=1992 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=0-12-664730-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The midden in [[Namu, British Columbia]] is over 9 meters deep and spans over 10,000 years of continuous occupation.

Shell middens created in coastal regions of Australia by [[indigenous Australians]] exist in [[Australia]] today. Middens provide evidence of prior occupation and are generally protected from mining and other developments. One must exercise caution in deciding whether one is examining a midden or a beach mound. There are good examples on the [[Freycinet Peninsula]] in Tasmania where wave action currently is combining charcoal from forest fire debris with a mix of shells into masses that storms deposit above high-water mark. Shell mounds near [[Weipa, Queensland|Weipa]] in far north Queensland that are mostly less than 2 meters high (although ranging up to 10 meters high) and a few tens of meters long are claimed to be middens,&lt;ref&gt;Bailey, G; Chappell, J.B; [[Roger Cribb|Cribb, R]] (1994) "The origin of Anadara shell mounds at Weipa, North Queensland, Australia"  Archaeology in Oceania. Volume 29 Number 2. pp. 69–80&lt;/ref&gt; but are in fact shell cheniers (beach ridges) re-worked by nest mound-building birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6V6M-3VW179G-K&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;view=c&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=e4afd582ed6f6c164c44d303b52acf9a |title= Shell mound formation in coastal northern Australia |date=1995-12-31 |accessdate=2014-02-24 |doi=10.1016/0025-3227(95)00101-8 |volume=129 |journal=Marine Geology |pages=77–100 | last1 = Stone | first1 = Tim|bibcode=1995MGeol.129...77S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shell mounds are also attributed to the creation of [[tropical hardwood hammocks]], one example being the [[Otter mound]] preserve in [[Florida]], where shell deposits from [[Calusa]] natives provided flood free high areas in otherwise large watered areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.colliergov.net/Index.aspx?page=2888 |title=Otter Mound Preserve |publisher=Colliergov.net |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are instances in which shell middens may have doubled as areas of ceremonial construction or ritual significance. The [[Woodland period]] [[Crystal River Archaeological State Park|Crystal River site]] provides an example of this phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pluckhahn|first1=Thomas J.|last2=Thompson|first2=Victor D.|last3=Cherkinsky|first3=Alexander|title=The temporality of shell-bearing landscapes at Crystal River, Florida|journal=Journal of Anthropological Anthropology|date=2015|volume=37|pages=19–36|doi=10.1016/j.jaa.2014.10.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some shell mounds, known as [[shell ring]]s, are circular or open arcs with a clear central area. Many are known from Japan and the southeastern United States, and at least one from South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lawrence|first=David R. and Hilda L. Wrightson|title=Late Archaic-Early Woodland Period Shell Rings of the Southeastern United States Coast: A Bibliographic Introduction|url=http://scholarcommons.sc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1191&amp;context=archanth_books|publisher=University of South Carolina|accessdate=10 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
{{see also|Midden (disambiguation)}}
The word is of [[Scandinavia]]n via [[Middle English]] derivation; from early Scandinavian; Danish: mødding, Swedish regional: mödding)&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = [[Oxford English Dictionary]] | edition = 3rd | year = 2003}}.&lt;/ref&gt;, and is today used by [[archaeology|archaeologists]] worldwide to describe any kind of feature containing waste products relating to day-to-day human life. They may be convenient, single-use pits created by [[nomadic]] groups or long-term, designated dumps used by [[Sedentism|sedentary]] communities that accumulate over several generations.

The word "midden" is still in everyday use in [[Scotland]] and [[Northern England]], and has come by extension to refer to anything that is a mess, including people and pets. This use was also taken to [[Northern Ireland]] by Scottish plantation settlers. [[Privy midden]]s were common in [[Manchester]].  In [[West Yorkshire]], a midden is also an outside lavatory, typically in the back yards of terraced houses. Often attached to this small building is an outhouse which houses [[dustbin]]s.

The word is used by [[farmers]] in Britain to describe the place where farm yard manure from cows or other animals is collected. Grants are sometimes available to protect these from rain to  [[Agricultural wastewater treatment|avoid runoff and pollution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Topics/farmingrural/SRDP/RuralPriorities/Options/Manurestorage|title=Manure/Slurry Storage|quote=Investment under this storage and handling Option may include:action to minimise the volume of clean water getting into manure or slurry stores, including the installation of covers for slurry storage facilities and middens|publisher=Scottish Government}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jennifermackenzie.co.uk/2008/04/02_booth.html|title=Roofed Midden benefits Lake District Farm|quote=Thanks to a grant from Farming Connect Cumbria the Booths were able to roof the slurry midden, probably trebling its capacity by excluding the rainwater, as well as making necessary repairs to the midden itself to prevent possible run-off to a nearby beck. The midden can now provide up to 10 weeks' storage for the slurry.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Red squirrel midden.jpg|thumb|Squirrel midden, [[Kenai National Wildlife Refuge]], Alaska]]
In the animal kingdom, some species establish ground [[burrow]]s, also known as middens, that are used mostly for food storage. For example, the North [[American red squirrel]] (''Tamiasciurus hudsonicus'') usually has one large active midden in each territory with perhaps an inactive or auxiliary midden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=dfg.webmaster@alaska.gov |url=http://www.adfg.state.ak.us/pubs/notebook/furbear/redsquir.php |title=Alaska Department of Fish &amp; Game: North American Red Squirrel |publisher=Adfg.state.ak.us |date= |accessdate=2014-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; A midden may be a regularly used [[animal toilet]] area or [[dunghill]], created by many mammals, such as the [[hyrax]], and also serving as a territorial marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chase |first1=B.M. |last2=Meadows |first2=M.E. |last3=Scott |first3=L. |last4=Thomas |first4=D.S.G. |last5=Marais |first5=E. |last6=Sealy |first6=J. |last7=Reimer |first7=P.J. |year=2009 |title=A record of rapid Holocene climate change preserved in hyrax middens from southwestern Africa |journal=Geology |volume=37 |issue=8 |pages=703–6 |bibcode=2009Geo....37..703C |doi=10.1130/G30053A.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some animals, including some species of fishes, collect foodstuffs with heavy shells that are hard to remove. They may establish sites where rocks or similar items are available as natural [[Anvil#Anvils in ethology and general biology|anvil]]s on which the animals habitually break open the shells. These discarded shells may accumulate around the anvils in sizable middens, sometimes for generations. Commonly such middens are sited where there is a convenient rock that is an unusual resource in the region.

[[Octopus]] middens are piles of debris that the octopus piles up to conceal the entrance of its den. Octopus middens are commonly made of rocks, shells, and the bones of prey, although they may contain anything the octopus finds that it can move.

Some more currently widespread used terms include garbage pile, garbage dump, waste pile, waste dump, and waste/garbage disposal site. The material (waste, garbage, refuse, rubbish, etc.) may be placed on a pile/mound on level ground or in a hole/pit dug into the ground which may be subsequently covered over with other material, often for sanitary, aesthetic or land reclamation reasons.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25187">[[File:Midland American English map.jpg|thumb|475px|According to Labov et al.'s (2006) ''[[Atlas of North American English|ANAE]]'', the strict Midland dialect region comprises the cities represented here by circles colored red (North Midland) and orange (South Midland). In the past, linguists considered the Midland dialect to cover an even larger area, extending eastward through Pennsylvania to the Atlantic Ocean.{{hidden begin|title=Further information|toggle=left}}The color blue on this map indicates the [[Inland North|Inland North dialect]], which is intruding southward into the middle of this region towards [[St. Louis, Missouri]].

'''Midland American English''' is a regional [[dialect]] or super-dialect of [[American English]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=5, 263}}&lt;/ref&gt; geographically lying between the traditionally-defined [[Northern United States|Northern]] and [[Southern United States]].&lt;ref&gt;Labov, William; Ash, Sharon; Boberg, Charles (1997). "[http://www.ling.upenn.edu/phono_atlas/NationalMap/NationalMap.html Dialects of the United States]." ''A National Map of The Regional Dialects of American English''. University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; The boundaries of Midland American English are not entirely clear, being revised and reduced by linguists due to definitional changes and several Midland sub-regions undergoing rapid and diverging pronunciation shifts since the early-middle twentieth century onwards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=263}}: "The Midland does not show the homogeneous character that marks the North in Chapter 14, or defines the South in Chapter 18. Many Midland cities have developed a distinct dialect character of their own[....] Pittsburgh, Cincinnati, and St Louis are quite distinct from the rest of the Midland[....]"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bierma, Nathan. "[http://articles.chicagotribune.com/2006-05-24/features/0605230378_1_language-variation-dialect-north-american-english American 'Midland' has English dialect all its own]." ''Chicago Tribune''.&lt;/ref&gt;

These general characteristics of the Midland regional accent are firmly established: [[fronting (phonetics)|fronting]] of the {{IPAc-en|oʊ}}, {{IPAc-en|aʊ}}, and {{IPAc-en|ʌ}} vowels occurs towards the center or even front of the mouth;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=137, 263, 266}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[cot–caught merger]] is neither fully completed nor fully absent; and [[æ tensing|short-''a'' tensing]] evidently occurs strongest before [[nasal consonant]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt; The currently-documented core of the Midland dialect region spans from central Ohio at its eastern extreme to central Nebraska and Oklahoma City at its western extreme. Certain areas outside of this core also clearly demonstrate a Midland accent, including Charleston, South Carolina;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Texan cities of Abilene, Austin, and Corpus Christi; and central and southern Florida.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=107, 139}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Twentieth-century dialectology was the first to identify the "Midland" as a region [[lexicology|lexically]] distinct from the Northern and Southern U.S., later even focusing on an internal division (North Midland versus South Midland); however, twenty-first-century studies now reveal increasing unification of the South Midland with a larger, newer [[Southern American English|Southern accent region]], while much of the North Midland retains a more "[[General American]]" accent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; Early twentieth-century boundaries established for the Midland dialect region are being reduced or revised, since several previous sub-regions of Midland speech have since developed their own distinct dialects. Pennsylvania, the original home state of the Midland dialect, is one such area, having now formed such unique dialects as [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia]] and [[Western Pennsylvania English|Pittsburgh English]].&lt;ref name="ANAE 135"&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Original and former Midland==
The dialect region "Midland" was first defined by [[Hans Kurath]] as centered on central Pennsylvania and expanding westward and southward to include most of [[Pennsylvania]], and the Appalachian regions of Kentucky, Tennessee, and all of West Virginia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=182}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kurath, Hans (1949). ''A Word Geography of the Eastern United States''. University of Michigan.)&lt;/ref&gt; A decade later, Kurath split this into two discrete subdivisions: the "North Midland" beginning north of the [[Ohio River]] valley area and extending westward into Indiana, Illinois, Iowa, and northern [[Missouri]], as well as parts of [[Nebraska]] and northern [[Kansas]] ; and the "South Midland", which extends south of the Ohio River and expands westward to include Kentucky, [[southern Indiana]], [[southern Illinois]], southern Missouri, [[Arkansas]], southern Kansas, and [[Oklahoma]], west of the [[Mississippi river]].&lt;ref&gt;Kurath, Hans; McDavid, Raven Ioor (1961).''The Pronunciation of English in the Atlantic States''. University of Michigan Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While Craig Carver and the related ''[[Dictionary of American Regional English]]'' based their 1960s research only on lexical (vocabulary) characteristics, [[William Labov]] and his team conversely based their [[Atlas of North American English|1990s research]] largely on phonological (sound) characteristics and defined the Midland area as a buffer zone between the [[Inland Northern American English|Inland North]] and the [[Southern American English|South]] accent regions. In Labov et al.'s newer study, the "Midland" essentially coincides with Kurath's "North Midland", the "South Midland" being now considered as largely a portion, or the northern fringe, of the [[Southern American English|Southern dialect region]]. Indeed, while the lexical and grammatical isoglosses encompass the Appalachian Mountains regardless of the Ohio River, the phonological boundary fairly closely follows along the Ohio River itself.

The original Midland dialect region, thus, has split off into having more of a Southern accent in southern Appalachia, while, the second half of the twentieth century has seen the emergence of a unique [[Western Pennsylvania English|Western Pennsylvania accent]] in northern Appalachia (centered on Pittsburgh) as well as a unique [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia accent]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=135}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mid-Atlantic region===
{{see also|Mid-Atlantic American English}}
The dialect region of the [[Mid-Atlantic States]]—centered on Philadelphia, Pennsylvania; Baltimore, Maryland; and Wilmington, Delaware—falls under the Midland, except that it strongly resists the [[cot–caught merger]] and traditionally has a [[/æ/ raising|short-''a'' split]] that is similar to New York City's, though still unique. Certain vocabulary is also specific to the Mid-Atlantic dialect, and particularly to its [[Philadelphia English|Philadelphia sub-dialect]].

===Western Pennsylvania===
[[File:Western Pennsylvania.PNG|300px|right|thumb|Based on Labov et al., averaged F1/F2 means for speakers from Western PA. The merger of {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} is complete for 11 out of 14 speakers;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=263}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{IPA|/ʌ/}} is backer and lower than in the rest of the North Midland.]]

{{see also|Western Pennsylvania English}}
The emerging and expanding dialect of [[Western Pennsylvania|western]] and much of central Pennsylvania is, for many purposes, an extension of the South Midland;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is spoken also in [[Youngstown, Ohio]], ten miles west of the state line, as well as [[Clarksburg, West Virginia]]. Like the Midland proper, the Western Pennsylvania accent features fronting of {{IPA|/oʊ/}} and {{IPA|/aʊ/}}, as well as positive ''anymore''. Its chief distinguishing features, however, also make it a separate dialect than the Midland one. These features include a completed [[cot–caught merger|{{Sc|lot}}&amp;ndash;{{sc|thought}} merger]] to a rounded vowel, which also causes a chain shift that drags the {{sc|strut}} vowel into the previous position of {{sc|lot}}. The Western Pennsylvania accent, lightheartedly known as "Pittsburghese", is perhaps best known for the monophthongization of {{sc|mouth}} to {{sc|palm}} ({{IPA|/aʊ/}} to {{IPA|[aː]}}), such as the stereotypical Pittsburgh pronunciation of ''downtown'' as ''dahntahn''. Despite having a Northern accent in the first half of the 20th century, [[Erie, Pennsylvania]], is the only major Northern city to change its affiliation to Midland by now using the Western Pennsylvania accent.

==Phonology and phonetics==
[[File:Midland.PNG|300px|right|thumb|Based on Labov et al.; averaged F1/F2 means for speakers from the (North) Midland (excluding Western PA and the St. Louis corridor). {{IPA|/ɑ/}} and {{IPA|/ɔ/}} are close but not merged.]]
*Rhoticity: Midland speech is firmly [[rhotic and non-rhotic accents|rhotic]] (or fully ''r''-pronouncing), like most North American English.
*[[Cot–caught merger]] in transition: The merger of the vowel sounds in {{sc|lot}} and {{sc|cloth}} is consistently in a transitional phase throughout most of the Midland region, showing neither a full presence nor absence of the merger. This involves a vowel [[phonemic merger|merger]] of the "short o" {{IPA|/ɑ/}} (as in ''cot'' or ''stock'') and "aw" {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (as in ''caught'' or ''stalk'') phonemes.
**''On'' boundary: A well-known phonological difference between Midland and Northern accents is that the single word ''on'' contains the phoneme {{IPA|/ɔ/}} (as in ''caught'') rather than {{IPA|/ɑ/}} (as in ''cot''). For this reason, one of the names for the boundary between the dialects of the Midland and the North is the "''on'' line".
*[[Epenthesis|Epenthetic]] ''r'': The phoneme sequence {{IPA|/wɑʃ/}}, as in ''wash'', ''squash'', and ''Washington'', traditionally receives an additional {{IPA|/r/}} sound after the {{angbr|a}}, thus with ''Washington'' sounding like "Warshington" {{IPAc-en|ˈ|w|ɑːr|ʃ|ɪ|ŋ|t|ə|n}}. Likely inherited from Scots-Irish influence, this features ranges from D.C., Maryland, southern Pennsylvania, West Virginia, Kentucky, Arkansas, West Texas, and the Midland dialect regions within Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Missouri, Oklahoma, and Kansas.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, John (2004). "[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/articles/A62786-2004Oct25.html Catching the Sound of the City]". ''The Washington Post''. The Washington Post Company.&lt;/ref&gt; Studied best of all in southern Pennsylvania, this feature may be declining.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Johnstone, Barbara; et al. (2015). ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=TpmnCgAAQBAJ&amp;dq Pittsburgh Speech and Pittsburghese]''. Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KGp. p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The short-''a'' phoneme, {{IPA|/æ/}} {{sc|(trap)}}, most commonly follows a [[General American]] ([[Phonological history of English short A#Non-phonemic æ-tensing|"continuous"]] and pre-nasal) distribution: {{IPA|/æ/}} is raised and tensed toward {{IPA|[eə]}} before [[nasal stop|nasal consonants]] (such as ''fan'') but remains low {{IPA|[æ]}} in other contexts (such as ''fact''). An increasing number of speakers from central Ohio realize the {{sc2|TRAP}} vowel {{IPA|/æ/}} as open front {{IPAblink|a|audio=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Thomas|2004|p=308}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fronting of {{IPA|/oʊ/}} {{sc|(goat)}}: the phoneme {{IPA|/oʊ/}} (as in ''goat'') is fronter than in many other American accents, particularly those of the North; the phoneme is frequently realized as a diphthong with a central nucleus, approximating {{IPA|[ɵʊ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=255–258 and 262–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fronting of {{IPA|/aʊ/}} {{sc|(mouth)}}: the diphthong {{IPA|/aʊ/}} (as in ''mouth'') has a fronter nucleus than {{IPA|/aɪ/}}, approaching {{IPA|[æʊ~ɛɔ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|pp=255–258 and 262–265}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fronting of {{IPA|/ʌ/}} {{sc|(strut)}}: among younger speakers, {{IPA|/ʌ/}} (as in ''bug'', ''strut'', ''what'', etc.) is shifting strongly to the front: {{IPAblink|ɜ|audio=y}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=266}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Lowering of {{IPA|/eɪ/}} {{sc|(face)}}: the diphthong {{IPA|/eɪ/}} (as in ''face'', ''reign'', ''day'', etc.) often has a lower nucleus than the Northern accents just above Midland region, so that the Midland diphthong approaches {{IPA|[ɛɪ~ɜɪ]}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Phonologically, the South Midland remains slightly different from the North Midland in one major respect: its greater likelihood of using a  "glideless" {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} vowel reminiscent of the [[Southern American English|Southern U.S. accent]], though {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} deletion in the South Midland only appears before [[sonorant consonant]]s: {{IPA|/m/, /n/, /l/, /r/}}. For example, ''fire'' may be pronounced something like ''fahr'' or even ''far''&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=268}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Southern Indiana is the northernmost extent of this accent, forming what dialectologists refer to as the "[[Hoosier]] Apex" of the South Midland, with the accent locally known as the "Hoosier Twang".

==Grammar==
*Positive ''anymore'': A common feature of the greater Midland area is so-called "[[Positive anymore|positive ''anymore'']]": It is possible to use the adverb ''anymore'' with the meaning "nowadays" in sentences without [[polarity item|negative polarity]], such as ''Air travel is inconvenient anymore.''&lt;ref name="Vaux"/&gt;
*"''Need'' + participle": Many speakers use the construction "''need'' + past participle". Some examples include:
**''The car needs washed'', where speakers of other dialects would say ''the car needs to be washed''
**''They need repaired'' for ''they need to be repaired''
**''So much still needs said'' for ''so much still needs to be said''
*"''All the'' + comparative": Speakers throughout the Midland (except central and southern Illinois) may use "''all the'' [[comparative|[comparative form of an adjective]]]" to mean "''as'' [adjective] ''as''", when followed by a subject. Some examples include:&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena/all-the-further All the Further]". ''Yale Grammatical Diversity Project English in North America''. Yale University. 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; 
**''I held all the tighter I could'' to mean ''I held as tight as I could''
**''That was all the higher she could jump'' to mean ''That was as high as she could jump''
**''This is all the more comfortable it gets'' to mean ''This is as comfortable as it gets''
*''Alls'': At the start of a sentence, "''alls'' [subject] [verb]" can be used in place of "''all that'' [subject] [verb]" to form a [[noun phrase]] followed by ''is'' or ''was''. For example (with the entire clause in italics): "''Alls we brought'' was bread" or "''Alls I want to do'' is sing a song". This has been especially well-studied in southern Ohio, though it is widespread throughout the Midwest.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://ygdp.yale.edu/phenomena//alls-construction The ''alls'' construction]".

Today, the South Midland is an area with more Midland vocabulary and grammar but more Southern phonology. However, the South Midland employs some [[Southern American English#Vocabulary|Southern vocabulary]] too, for example, favoring ''[[y'all]]'' as the plural of ''you'', whereas the North Midland favors ''you guys''.

==Charleston==
Today, the city of [[Charleston, South Carolina]], clearly has all the defining features of a mainstream Midland accent. The vowels {{IPAc-en|oʊ}} and {{IPAc-en|u:}} are extremely fronted, and yet not so not before {{IPAc-en|l}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, the older, more [[Older Southern American English#Lowcountry (Charleston and Savannah)|traditional Charleston accent]] was extremely "non-Southern" in sound (as well as being highly unique), spoken throughout the South Carolina and Georgia [[Lowcountry]], but it mostly faded out of existence in the first half of twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=259}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cincinnati==
Older English speakers of [[Cincinnati|Cincinnati, Ohio]], have a phonological pattern quite distinct from the surrounding area (Boberg and Strassel 2000), while younger speakers now align to the general Midland accent. The older Cincinnati short-''a'' system is unique in the Midland.  While there is no evidence for a [[phonemic split]], the phonetic conditioning of short-''a'' in conservative Cincinnati speech is similar to and originates from that of [[Phonological history of English short A#Phonemic æ tensing in the Mid-Atlantic region|New York City]], with the raising environments including nasals (m, n, ŋ), voiceless fricatives (f, unvoiced th, sh, s), and voiced stops (b, d, g).  Weaker forms of this pattern are shown by speakers from nearby [[Dayton, Ohio|Dayton]] and [[Springfield, Ohio|Springfield]].  Boberg and Strassel (2000) reported that Cincinnati's traditional short-''a'' system was giving way among younger speakers to a [[/æ/ tensing|nasal system]] similar to those found elsewhere in the Midland and the West.

==St. Louis Corridor==
[[St. Louis]], Missouri, is historically one among several (North) Midland cities, but it has developed some unique features of its own distinguishing it from the rest of the Midland. The area around St. Louis has been in dialectal transition throughout most of the 1900s until the present moment. The eldest generation of the area may exhibit a rapidly-declining merger of the phonemes {{IPA|/ɔr/}} (as in ''for'') and {{IPA|/ɑr/}} (as in ''far'') to the sound {{IPA|[ɒɹ]}}, while leaving distinct {{IPA|/oʊr/}} (as in ''four''), thus being one of the few American accents to still resist the [[horse-hoarse merger]] (while also displaying the [[card-cord merger]]). This merger has led to jokes referring to "[[Interstate 44 in Missouri|I farty-far]]",&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Wolfram|Ward|2006|p=128}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a more accurate [[eye spelling]] would be "I farty-four". Also, some St. Louis speakers, again usually the oldest ones, have {{IPA|/eɪ/}} instead of more typical {{IPA|/ɛ/}} before {{IPA|/ʒ/}}—thus ''measure'' is pronounced {{IPA|/ˈmeɪʒ.ɚ/}}—and ''wash'' (as well as ''Washington'') gains an {{IPA|/r/}}, becoming {{IPA|[wɒɻʃ]}} ("warsh"). 

Since the mid-1900s (namely, in speakers born from the 1920s to 1940s), however, a newer accent arose in a dialect "corridor" essentially following historic [[U.S. Route 66 in Illinois]] (now [[Interstate 55 in Illinois]]) from Chicago southwest to St. Louis. Speakers of this modern "St. Louis Corridor"—including St. Louis, Fairbury, and [[Springfield, Illinois]]—have gradually developed more features of the [[Inland North]] dialect, best recognized today as the Chicago accent. This twentieth-century St. Louis accent's separating quality from the rest of the Midland is its strong resistance to the ''cot–caught'' merger and the most advanced development of the [[Northern Cities Vowel Shift]] (NCS).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the twentieth century, Greater St. Louis therefore became a mix of Midland accents and Inland Northern (Chicago-like) accents.

Even more complicated, however, there is evidence that these Northern sound changes are reversing for the younger generations of speakers in the St. Louis area, who are re-embracing purely Midland-like accent features, though only at a regional level and therefore not including the aforementioned traditional features of the eldest generation. According to a [[UPenn]] study, the St. Louis Corridor's one-generation period of embracing the NCS was followed by the next generation's "retreat of NCS features from Route 66 and a slight increase of NCS off of Route 66", in turn followed by the most recent generations' decreasing evidence of the NCS until it disappears altogether among the youngest speakers.&lt;ref&gt;Friedman, Lauren (2015). ''A Convergence of Dialects in the St. Louis Corridor''. Volume 21. Issue 2. ''Selected Papers from New Ways of Analyzing Variation''(NWAV). 43. Article 8. University of Pennsylvania.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, due to harboring two different dialects in the same geographic space, the "Corridor appears simultaneously as a single dialect area and two separate dialect areas".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwav43.illinois.edu/program/documents/Northern.Cities.Panel_NWAV14PanelRevAbs.pdf "Northern Cities Panel".] 43rd NWAV. School of Literature's, Cultures, and Linguistics. University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Texas==
Rather than a proper Southern accent, several cities in Texas can be better described as having a Midland accent, as they lack the "true" Southern accent's full {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} deletion and the oft-accompanying Southern Vowel Shift. Texan cities classifiable as such specifically include Abilene, Austin, and Corpus Christi. [[Austin, Texas|Austin]], in particular, has been reported in some speakers to show the South Midland (but not the Southern) variant of {{IPAc-en|aɪ}} deletion mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvcoltxt|Labov|Ash|Boberg|2006|p=126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Mythologies''''' is a 1957 book by [[Roland Barthes]]. It is a collection of essays taken from ''Les Lettres nouvelles'', examining the tendency of contemporary social value systems to create modern [[mythology|myth]]s. Barthes also looks at the [[semiology]] of the process of myth creation, updating [[Ferdinand de Saussure]]'s system of [[sign (semiotics)|sign]] analysis by adding a second level where signs are elevated to the level of myth.

==Format==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
''Mythologies'' is split into two: Mythologies and Myth Today, the first section consisting of a collection of essays on selected modern myths and the second further and general analysis of the concept.

==Mythologies==
{{refimprove section|date=August 2018}}
The first section of ''Mythologies'' describes a selection of modern cultural phenomena, chosen for their status as modern myths and for the added meaning that has been conferred upon them. Each short chapter analyses one such myth, ranging from ''Einstein's Brain'' to ''Soap Powders and Detergents''. They were originally written as a series of bi-monthly essays for the magazine ''Les Lettres Nouvelles''.

In a typical example, Barthes describes the image that has been built up around red wine and how it has been adopted as a French national drink, how it is seen as a social equaliser and the drink of the [[proletariat]], partly because it is seen as blood-like (as in [[Holy Communion]]) and points out that very little attention is paid to red wine's [[Wine#Health effects|harmful effects to health]], but that it is instead viewed as life-giving and refreshing — 'in cold weather, it is associated with all the myths of becoming warm, and at the height of summer, with all the images of shade, with all things cool and sparkling.'&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p. 60&lt;/ref&gt;

In another chapter, Barthes explores the myth of [[professional wrestling]]. He describes how, unlike in the sport of [[boxing]], the aim of theatrical stunt fighting is not to discover who will win or 'a demonstration of excellence',&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p.15&lt;/ref&gt; it is a staged [[spectacle]] acting out society's basic concepts of good and evil, of 'Suffering, Defeat and Justice'.&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p.19&lt;/ref&gt; The actors pretending to be wrestlers, like characters in a [[pantomime]], portray grossly-exaggerated stereotypes of human weakness: the traitor, the conceited, the 'effeminate teddy-boy'. The audience expects to watch them suffer and be punished for their own transgressions of wrestling's rules in a theatrical version of society's ideology of [[justice]].{{cn|date=August 2018}}

In an interview Barthes once mentioned working on an essay on [[hidden track]]s in recorded music. This essay, however, has never been published.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

==Myth today==
In the second half of the book Barthes addresses the question of "What is a myth, today?" with the analysis of ideas such as: [[myth]] as a type of speech, and myth on the wings of politics.

[[File:Paris Match - child soldier cover.jpg|thumb|left|The front cover of the ''[[Paris Match]]'' magazine that Barthes analyzes]]
Following on from the first section, Barthes justifies and explains his choices and analysis. He calls upon  the concepts of [[semiology]] developed by [[Ferdinand de Saussure]], who described the connections between an object (the [[Sign (linguistics)|signified]]) and its linguistic representation (such as a word, the signifier) and how the two are connected.&lt;ref name="Sanders2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Carol Sanders|title=The Cambridge Companion to Saussure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KRy-xWG1MvIC&amp;pg=PA162|date=2 December 2004|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-0-521-80486-8|pages=162–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Working with this structure Barthes continues to show his idea of a myth as a further sign, with its roots in language, but to which something has been added. So with a [[word]] (or other linguistic unit) the meaning (apprehended content) and the sound come together to make a sign. To make a myth, the sign itself is used as a ''signifier'', and a new meaning is added, which is the ''signified''. But according to Barthes, this is ''not'' added arbitrarily.&lt;ref name="Adams2018"&gt;{{cite book|author=Laurie Schneider Adams|title=The Methodologies of Art: An Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnhQDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT172|date=9 March 2018|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-429-97407-6|pages=172–}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although we are not necessarily aware of it, modern myths are created with a reason. As in the example of the red wine, mythologies are formed to perpetuate an idea of society that adheres to the current ideologies of the [[ruling class]] and its [[Mass media|media]].&lt;ref name="WagonerWagoner2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Associate Professor of Psychology Brady Wagoner|author2=Brady Wagoner|title=Symbolic Transformation: The Mind in Movement Through Culture and Society|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HWeMAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA98|date=4 December 2009|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-135-15090-7|pages=98–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barthes demonstrates this theory with the example of a front cover from ''[[Paris Match]]'' edition no. 326, of July 1955,&lt;ref name="EvansHall1999"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jessica Evans|author2=Stuart Hall|title=Visual Culture: The Reader|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l209XFHIzrIC&amp;pg=PA55|date=6 July 1999|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=978-0-7619-6248-9|pages=55–}}&lt;/ref&gt; showing a young black soldier in French uniform [[Salute|saluting]]. The ''signifier'': a saluting soldier, cannot offer us further factual information of the young man's life. But it has been chosen by the magazine to symbolise more than the young man; the picture, in combination with the ''signifieds'' of Frenchness, militariness, and relative ethnic difference, gives us a message about France and its citizens. The picture does not explicitly demonstrate 'that France is a great empire, that all her sons, without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under her flag,' etc.,&lt;ref&gt;Barthes, ''Mythologies'', p.116&lt;/ref&gt; but the combination of the signifier and signified perpetuates the myth of imperial devotion, success and thus; a property of 'significance' for the picture.

{{Cquote|I am at the barber’s, and copy of Paris-Match is offered to me. On the cover, a young Negro in a French uniform is saluting, with his eyes uplifted, probably fixed on a fold of the tricolour. All this is the meaning  of the picture. But whether naively or not, I see very well what it signifies to me: that France is a great Empire, that all her sons, without any colour discrimination, faithfully serve under the flag, and that there is no better answer to the detractors of an alleged colonialism than the zeal shown by this Negro in serving his so-called oppressors ...&lt;ref name="Rosello2010"&gt;{{cite book|author=Mireille Rosello|title=The Reparative in Narratives: Works of Mourning in Progress|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Avc88FBCJVMC&amp;pg=PT61|year=2010|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=978-1-84631-220-5|pages=61–}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Myth and power ===
Exploring the concept of myth, Barthes seeks to grasp the relations between language and power. He assumes that myth helps to naturalize particular worldviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Barthes, myth is based on humans’ history, and myth cannot naturally occur. There are always some communicative intentions in myth. Created by people, myth can easily be changed or destroyed. Also, myth depends on the context where it exists. By changing the context, one can change the effects of myth. At the same time, myth itself participates in the creation of an [[ideology]]. According to Barthes, myth doesn’t seek to show or to hide the truth when creating an ideology, it seeks to deviate from the reality. The major function of myth is to naturalize a concept, a belief. Myth purifies signs and fills them with a new meaning which is relevant to the communicative intentions of those who are creating the myth. In the new sign, there are no contradictions that could raise any doubts regarding the myth. Myth is not deep enough to have these contradictions; it simplifies the world by making people believe that signs have inherent meaning. Myth “abolishes the complexity of human acts, it gives them the simplicity of essences…”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Why do people believe in myth? The power of myth is in its impressive character. It seeks to surprise the audience. This impression is way more powerful than any rational explanations which can disprove the myth. So, myth works not because it hides its intentions, but because the intentions of myth have been naturalized. Through the usage of myths, one can naturalize “the Empire, [the] taste for [[Basque culture|Basque]] things, the Government.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Speaking of myth and power, Barthes asserts that myth is a depoliticized speech. He uses the term {{anchor|exnomination}}'''ex-nomination''' (or '''exnomination'''), by which he "means 'outside of naming'. Barthes' point was that dominant groups or ideas in society become so obvious or common sense that they don't have to draw attention to themselves by giving themselves a name. They're just the 'normality', against which everything else can be judged."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = McKee | first = Alan | chapter = How do I know what's a likely interpretation? | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=H2Rn0Wpq5uQC&amp;pg=PA106 | title = Textual analysis: a beginner's guide | page = 106 | publisher = Sage Publications | location = London Thousand Oaks, California | year = 2003 | isbn = 9780761949930 }} ''See also'': {{cite journal | last = Wasson | first = Richard | title = Myth and the ex-nomination of class in ''The Time Machine'' | journal = [[The Minnesota Review]] | volume = 15 | pages = 112&amp;ndash;122 | publisher = [[Johns Hopkins University Press]] | date = Fall 1980 | url = http://muse.jhu.edu/article/427124 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example he says, "[the bourgeoisie] makes its status undergo a real ''ex-nominating operation'': the bourgeoisie is defined as ''the social class which does not want to be named''" (italics in original).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Lakoff | first = Robin Tolmach | author-link = Robin Lakoff | chapter = The neutrality of the status quo | chapter-url = https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=xmr3ZBHFbVwC&amp;pg=PA53 | title = The language war | page = 53 | publisher = University of California Press | location = Berkeley | year = 2000 | isbn = 9780520928077 }}{{Cite book| title = Mythologies| last = Barthes| first = Roland | page = 138| publisher = Cape| year = 1972| location = London | oclc = 222874772}}&lt;/ref&gt; Myth removes our understanding of concepts and beliefs as created by humans. Instead, myth presents them as something natural and innocent. Drawing upon [[Karl Marx]], Barthes states that even the most natural objects include some aspect of politics. Depending on how strong the political side of myth is, Barthes defines the strong and the weak myths (''des mythes forts et des mythes faibles'').&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = Mythologies| last = Barthes| first = Roland| publisher = Éditions du Seuil| year = 1957| isbn = | location = Paris| pages = 218}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Depoliticization of the strong myths happens abruptly, as the strong myths are explicitly political. The weak myths are the myths which have already lost their political character. However, this character can be brought back by “the slightest thing”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Mythologies | last = Barthes | pages = 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:The model of semiosis.png|thumb|348x348px|The model of semiosis suggested by Barthes.]]

Barthes also provides a list of rhetorical figures in [[bourgeoisie]] myths:
* The inoculation. The government admits the harm brought by one of the institutes. Focusing on one institute, myth hides the inconsistency of the system.&lt;ref name="Sandoval2000"&gt;{{cite book|author=Chela Sandoval|title=Methodology of the Oppressed|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XZ-uoDNV7IcC&amp;pg=PT137|year=2000|publisher=University of Minnesota Press|isbn=978-0-8166-2736-3|pages=137–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The privation of History. A history standing behind a myth gets removed. People don’t wonder where the myth comes from; they simply believe it.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* Identification. The ideology of bourgeoisie seeks for sameness. It denies all the concepts that don’t fit into the system. The bourgeoisie either ignores subjects that differ from them, or they put the efforts to make this subject the same as the bourgeoisie.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* Tautology. The myths of the bourgeoisie define the concepts through the same concepts (Barthes provides an example of theatre, “Drama is drama”)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | title = Mythologies| last = Barthes | pages = 152}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Neither-Norism (''le ninisme)''. Two concepts are defined by each other, and both of the concepts are considered inconsistent.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* The quantification of quality. Myth measures reality by numbers, not by quality. This way, myth simplifies reality.{{cn|date=August 2018}}
* The statement of fact. Myth doesn’t explain the reality. Myth asserts a certain picture of the world without explanation just like a [[proverb]] does.{{cn|date=August 2018}}

The model of [[semiosis]] suggested by Barthes seeks to link signs with the social myths or ideologies that they articulate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://www.communicationencyclopedia.com/public/ | title = International Encyclopedia of Communication | website = International Encyclopedia of Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythologisation and cultural studies==
{{unreferenced section|date=August 2018}}
In writing about the mythologisation process, Barthes refers to the tendency of [[social constructionism|socially constructed]] notions, narratives, and assumptions to become "naturalised" in the process, that is, taken unquestioningly as given within a particular culture. Barthes finishes ''Mythologies'' by looking at how and why myths are built up by the bourgeoisie in its various manifestations. He returns to this theme in later works including ''The Fashion System''.

== Reception ==
In January 2005, ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' wrote, "The International Society for Philosophers, which is aimed at anyone interested in philosophy, now has 800 members in 68 countries, though it is only two years old. The society's magazine, Philosophy Pathways, goes out fortnightly to more than 1,000 addresses, and around 400 students from 40 countries have participated in its distance learning programme."&lt;ref&gt;Talbot, Marianne (21 January 2005). ''[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/education/3349129/I-link-therefore-I-am.html I link, therefore I am]''. ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''. Retrieved 14 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, the British philosopher and [[literary critic]] [[Christopher Norris (critic)|Christopher Norris]] sent an email to Geoffrey Klempner with the following message: "I am sending (by attachment) a poem -- actually a long verse-essay -- that you might wish to publish in a forthcoming number of Philosophy Pathways. I should perhaps explain that the piece originates in my various published exchanges with Rorty many years back, and that it responds to his challenge that philosophy should become more adventurous, exploratory, inventive, metaphorical, and -- in short -- poetic. Hence my otherwise rather odd choice of verse as a medium in which to conduct philosophical debate." On the 1st of the following June, a couple of Norris' works were published in ''Philosophy Pathways''.&lt;ref&gt;''[https://philosophypathways.com/newsletter/issue186.html Special Christopher Norris Issue]''. ''Philosophy Pathways''. Issue No. 186. Retrieved 14 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[archaeology]], a '''prismatic blade''' is a long, narrow, specialized [[lithic flake|stone flake]] tool with a sharp edge, like a small razor blade.&lt;ref&gt;Hester ''et al.'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt; Prismatic blades are flaked from [[lithic core|stone core]]s through [[pressure flaking]] or direct percussion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Driscoll|first1=Killian|last2=García-Rojas|first2=Maite|title=Their lips are sealed: identifying hard stone, soft stone, and antler hammer direct percussion in Palaeolithic prismatic blade production|journal=Journal of Archaeological Science|date=2014|volume=47|pages=134–141|doi=10.1016/j.jas.2014.04.008|url=http://lithicsireland.ie/driscoll_garcia_rojas_2014_identifying_palaeolithic_blade_production_journal_archaeological_science_47.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process results in a very standardized finished tool and [[Debitage|waste assemblage]]. The most famous and most prevalent prismatic blade material is [[obsidian]], as [[Obsidian use in Mesoamerica|obsidian use was widespread in Mesoamerica]], though [[chert]], [[flint]], and [[chalcedony]] blades are not uncommon.  The term is generally restricted to [[Mesoamerica]]n archeology, although some examples are found in the [[Old World]], for example in a [[Minoan civilization|Minoan]] grave in [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;Betancourt, Philip P., ''Hagios Charalambos: A Minoan Burial Cave in Crete: I. Excavation and Portable Objects'', 2014, INSTAP, {{ISBN|1623033934}}, 9781623033934, [https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=BIXOBgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA80 google books]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prismatic blades were used for cutting and scraping, and have been reshaped into other tool types, such as [[projectile points]] and [[stitching awl|awls]].

==Morphology==
[[Image:chunchucmil-obsidian.jpg|thumb|An obsidian prismatic blade fragment from [[Chunchucmil]], [[Yucatán (state)|Yucatán]], [[Mexico]]]]

Prismatic blades are often [[trapezoid]]al in cross section, but very close in appearance to an [[isosceles trapezoid]].  Triangular blades (in cross-section) are also common.  The ventral surface of the prismatic blade is very smooth, sometimes bearing slight rippling reflecting the direction of applied force and a very small [[bulb of applied force]] (indicative of pressure reduction).  Flake scars are absent on the ventral surface of these blades,  though [[Eraillure|eraillure flakes]] are sometimes present on the bulb .  The dorsal surface, on the other hand, exhibits scar ridges running parallel to the long axis of the blade.  These facets are created by the previous removal of blades from the core.  The proximal end contains the blade's [[striking platform]] and its bulb of applied force, while the distal end will consist of a snap break, a feather termination, or a stepped termination.

==Production==
[[Obsidian]] prismatic blade production was ubiquitous in Mesoamerica, and these tools can be found at a large majority of Mesoamerican [[archaeological site]]s from the [[Mesoamerican chronology|Preclassic period]] on until the [[Spanish conquest of Mexico|arrival of the Spanish]] in the early 16th century. Ethnohistoric sources recount the process of prismatic blade production.  Fray [[Toribio de Benavente Motolinia|Motolinia]], a [[Spain|Spanish]] observer, recorded:

{{quote|It is in this manner: First they get out a knife stone (obsidian core) which is black like [[Jet (lignite)|jet]] and 20 cm or slightly less in length, and they make it cylindrical and as thick as the calf of the leg, and they place the stone between the feet, and with a stick apply force to the edges of the stone, and at every push they give a little knife springs off with its edges like those of a razor.&lt;ref&gt;Hester ''et al.'' (1971)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The production of prismatic blades creates not only a very standardized final product, but also a standardized waste assemblage.&lt;ref&gt;Clark and Bryant (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;  The analysis of obsidian [[debitage]] can reveal whether or not prismatic blade production occurred at a site and, if it had, what stages of production the process included. In other words, the types of manufacturing waste present (e.g., rejuvenation flakes and/or blades, platform rejuvenation flakes, etc.) at a site can inform archaeologists about the stage in which blades were being produced.&lt;ref&gt;Clark (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7995">The '''repatriation and reburial of human remains''' is a current debate in [[archaeology]]. Various indigenous peoples around the world, such as [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native Americans]] and [[Indigenous Australians]] have requested that human remains from their respective communities be repatriated for reburial. A famous case is that of the [[Kennewick Man]] in the United States. Similarly, contemporary [[Neo-druidism|Druids]] have requested the reburial of ancient human remains in the [[British Isles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Archaeology Live, English Heritage repatriation request notes. ''"a test case for the Druids to gain a precedent for more repatriations all over the British isles [sic]"'' |url=http://archaeological.livejournal.com/449932.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130626191502/http://archaeological.livejournal.com/449932.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 June 2013 |accessdate=30 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Repatriation in general seems to be concerned with objects, in the broadest sense of the word, ranging from human remains to [[art repatriation]]. But it actually is about people in the present and their perception of the past in the present. Repatriation claims are linked to politics, ethnic identity, and other debates or problems in contemporary society that have or claim to have a historical link to the object.

== Ethical considerations ==
The controversy comes from the fact that some believe that it is disrespectful to the dead and to their contemporary descendants for their remains to be displayed in a [[museum]] or stored in other ways.&lt;ref&gt;Scarre and Scarre (2006). ''The ethics of archaeology : philosophical perspectives on archaeological practice'', p. 206-208. Cambridge University Press, Cambridge. {{ISBN|0-521-54942-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

== The trauma of history ==
The first and foremost undercurrent of repatriation is the ill treatment of people in the past, the repatriation of human remains is to a degree part of a healing process bandaging the traumas of history.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002). Introduction: the reburial issue in the twenty-first century. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''.C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P. Turnbull (Ed). Routledge, London and New York, p. 1. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In essence it is important that this ill treatment is addressed but with the repatriation and reburial of remains they are essentially lost to the world as a reminder of that part of the object's history or biography. Repatriation also presents an opportunity for people to lay claim to their own past and actively decide what is and what is not a part of their cultural heritage. The basis beneath the open wounds of history is the difference in treatment of remains that were seen as sufficiently other and could therefore be studied without any ethical considerations.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002). Introduction: the reburial issue in the twenty-first century. In: ''The dead and their possessions: repatriation in principle, policy and practice''.C. Fforde, J. Hubert and P.

The contesting of ownership of human remains in museums and other institutions, and demands of return to cultural groups is largely fuelled by the difference in the handling of ‘white’ and indigenous remains. Where the former were reburied the latter were subjects of study and eventually ending up in museums. In a sense one cultural group assumed the right to carry out scientific research upon another cultural group.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002).

Routledge, London and New York, p. 1-3. {{ISBN|0-415-34449-2}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This disrespectful unequal treatment stems from a time when race and cultural differences had huge social implications. These are changing but the aftermath of centuries of inequality cannot be corrected so easily. This frustration is what partly fuels the repatriation and ownership claims that seem to have increased in the last 30 years.&lt;ref&gt;Hubert, J. and C. Fforde (2002).

==Druids and human remains==
The [[Neo-druidism|Neo-druidic]] movement is a modern religion, with some groups originating in the 18th century and others in the 20th century. They are generally inspired by either Victorian-era ideas of the [[druids]] of the [[Iron Age]], or later [[Neopaganism|neopagan]] movements. Some practice [[ancestor veneration]], and because of this may believe that they have a responsibility to care for the ancient dead where they now live. In 2006 Paul Davies requested that the Alexander Keiller Museum in [[Avebury]], [[Wiltshire]] rebury their [[Neolithic]] human remains, and that storing and displaying them was "immoral and disrespectful"&lt;ref&gt;https://www.academia.edu/12766795/Request_for_the_Reburial_of_Ancestral_Human_Remains_at_Avebury_Wiltshire_2008_&lt;/ref&gt;. The [[National Trust for Places of Historic Interest or Natural Beauty|National Trust]] refused to allow reburial, but did allow for Neo-druids to perform a healing ritual in the museum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Consultation on ancient human remains ends Jan 31 |journal=British Archaeology |issue=104 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The archaeological community has voiced criticism of the Neo-druids, making statements such as "no single modern ethnic group or cult should be allowed to appropriate our ancestors for their own agendas. It is for the international scientific community to curate such remains."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Letters: Human Remains |journal=British Archaeology |issue=105 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; An argument proposed by archaeologists is that, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;''"Druids are not the only people who have feelings about human remains... We don't know much about the religious beliefs of these [Prehistoric] people, but know that they wanted to be remembered, their stories, mounds and monuments show this. Their families have long gone, taking all memory with them, and we archaeologists, by bringing them back into the world, are perhaps the nearest they have to kin. We care about them, spending our lives trying to turn their bones back into people... The more we know the better we can remember them. Reburying human remains destroys people and casts them into oblivion: this is at best, misguided, and at worse cruel."''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Letters: Human Remains |journal=British Archaeology |issue=105 |year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

{{Politics of the European Union}}
The '''Santer Commission''' was the [[European Commission]] in office between 23 January 1995 and 15 March 1999. The administration was led by [[Jacques Santer]] (former [[Prime Minister of Luxembourg]]).

The body had 20 members and oversaw the introduction of the euro. It was cut short when the Commission became the first to resign ''en masse'' due to allegations of corruption. Some members continued under [[Manuel Marín]] until the [[Prodi Commission]] was appointed.

==Appointment==
In 1994 [[Jacques Delors]] was due to step down from a successful tenure as [[President of the European Commission]]. However his federalist style was not to the liking of many national governments. Hence when the proposal of [[Jean-Luc Dehaene]] (the then-[[Prime Minister of Belgium]]) was presented, he was vetoed by the UK on the grounds he was too federalist. [[Jacques Santer]], then-[[Prime Minister of Luxembourg]], was seen as less federalist as his [[Presidency of the Council of the European Union|presidency]] had earlier proposed the [[Three pillars of the European Union|pillar structure]]. Hence he was nominated and approved by the [[European Council]] on 15 July 1994.&lt;ref name="ENA"&gt;{{cite web | title =The crisis of the Santer Commission  | publisher =CVCE (Centre for European Studies) | url =http://www.cvce.eu/obj/the_crisis_of_the_santer_commission-en-7380f95b-1fb2-484d-a262-d870a0d5d74d.html | accessdate = 2013-05-04 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hence he was seen as being the "second choice" which weakened his position, with the [[European Parliament]] approving him only by a narrow majority.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt; Santer himself admitted that he "was not the first choice – but to become Commission president was not my first choice either."&lt;ref name="E!Sharp Jan8 EV"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meade|first=Geoff|title=Euroville|journal=E!Sharp magazine|pages=63|date=January–February 2008|publisher = Encompass Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt; He did however flex his powers over the nominations for the other [[European Commissioner|Commissioners]]. The President gained this power under the [[Maastricht Treaty]] that came into force the previous year. On 18 January 1995 he got his Commission approved by Parliament by 416 votes to 103 (a larger majority than expected) and they were appointed by the Council on 23 January.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt;

==Early work==
The Santer Commission oversaw the development of the [[Treaty of Nice]] before it was signed in 2000, negotiations with those [[Enlargement of the European Union|countries to join]] in 2004 and the signing of the [[Amsterdam Treaty]] in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Discover the former Presidents: The Santer Commission | publisher =[[Europa (web portal)]] | url =http://ec.europa.eu/commission_barroso/president/history/santer/index_en.htm | accessdate = 2007-08-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Notably it contributed to the development of the euro and issued a series of [[green paper]]s based on Commissioner [[Yves-Thibault de Silguy]]'s work. The Commission also developed the [[Euro sign|euro currency symbol]]. The euro was established on 1999-01-01. The Commission also continued Delors' social agenda, pushed for more powers in that field including tackling unemployment and began proposals for the reform of the [[Common Agricultural Policy]].&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt;

Santer, desiring a quotable slogan for his administration, stated his Commissions aim would be "to do less, but do it better" (a slogan adopted and adapted by many since). Although just a [[sound bite]], it touched a chord for some thinking the Community needed a rest after the new treaties and the euro, even if the nature of the Community itself requires movements and new projects to keep it busy.&lt;ref name="E!Sharp Jan8 EV"/&gt; However, during 1998 the Commission began to lose authority due to management criticisms from the Parliament.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt;

==Budget controversy==
The [[Budget of the European Union|community's budget]] for each year needs to be discharged by the Parliament following its report by the [[European Court of Auditors]]. It had only refused to do so once previously, in 1984.&lt;ref name="background"&gt;{{cite web | title=Budgetary control: 1996 discharge raises issue of confidence in the Commission  | publisher =[[Europa (web portal)]]| year=1999  | url =http://www.europarl.europa.eu/election/bilan/en/pf1901en.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Towards the end of 1998 the Parliament's [[Committee on Budgetary Control]] initially refused to discharge the [[Budget of the European Union|community's budget]] for 1996 over what it saw as the arrogance of the Commission in its refusal to answer questions relating to financial mismanagement.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"&gt;{{cite book| last = Hoskyns | first = Catherine |author2=Michael Newman  | title = Democratizing the European Union: Issues for the twenty-first Century (Perspectives on Democratization | publisher = [[Manchester University Press]] | year = 2000 | pages=106–7 | isbn = 978-0-7190-5666-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Paul van Buitenen]], a [[whistle-blower]] working in the Commission, had sent the Parliament a report alleging that widespread fraud and cover ups, stating: ''"I found strong indications that . . . auditors have been hindered in their investigations and that officials received instructions to obstruct the audit examinations . . . The commission is a closed culture and they want to keep it that way, and my objective is to open it up, to create more transparency and to put power where it belongs – and that's in the democratically-elected European Parliament."'' In response, the Commission suspended him on half pay for releasing details of an inquiry.&lt;ref name="Buitenen"&gt;{{cite web | title=EU chief: No fraud cover-up  | publisher =[[BBC News]]| date=7 January 1999  | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/250052.stm | accessdate = 2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Paul van Buitenen |title=Blowing the Whistle: Fraud in the European Commission |publisher=Politicos Pub |year=2000 |isbn=9781902301464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:PaulineGreenatEP.jpg|thumb|left|[[Party of European Socialists|PES]] leader [[Pauline Green]] tabled a vote of no confidence in the Commission]] --&gt;
However it eventually supported the discharge 14 to 13 on 11 December, recommending that the plenary support the discharge. It was taken to plenary for debate four days later however the assigned rapporteur publicly went against the Committee's official position and urged the plenary to reject the discharge motion. President Santer announced that the Commission would treat the vote of discharge as [[vote of confidence|one of confidence]]. In a vote on 17 December 1998, the Parliament denied the discharge.&lt;ref name="Ringe"&gt;{{cite web  | last =Ringer  | first =Nils F.  | title =The Santer Commission Resignation Crisis  | publisher =[[University of Pittsburgh]]  |date=February 2003  | url =http://aei.pitt.edu/2919/01/156.pdf  | format =PDF  | accessdate = 2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, on the basis it was tantamount to a vote of no confidence, the President of PES, [[Pauline Green]], announced she would put forward a [[motion of censure]]. However PES would vote against its own motion, as there is no method for a motion of confidence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/democracylive/hi/historic_moments/newsid_8207000/8207105.stm BBC Democracy Live: 14 January 1999: Crisis in the EU]&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the Parliament took on an increased government-opposition dynamic, with PES as a party supporting the Commission and the EPP renouncing its support and acting as a ''de facto'' opposition party to the executive.&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt; This is in part because the allegations centred on [[Édith Cresson]] and [[Manuel Marín]], both from the [[Party of European Socialists|Socialist party]] (PES). It was seen by some that it was an attempt by the [[European People's Party|People's party]] (EPP) to discredit PES ahead of the [[European Parliament election, 1999|1999 elections]]. This led to hesitation from the PES leadership, who were the largest group in Parliament, to support the allegations.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; Motions tabled by the two groups outlined the differing stances the EPP favouring individual responsibility (just those whom the main allegations are against) and PES favouring an emphasis on collective responsibility (so EPP members such as the President, as well as PES members, would be forced to resign). The PES resolution also proposed establishing a committee of independent experts to investigate the allegations.&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt;

==Resignation==
Following negotiations, including national capitals pressuring their MEPs,&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; the Parliament met to vote on the resolutions on 14 January 1999. It accepted the PES resolution and turned down a censure motion 293 to 232. Hence the ''Committee of Independent Experts'' was set up with its members appointed by the political leaders in Parliament and the Commission to create a balance.&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt; A number of high-profile figures&lt;ref&gt;André Middelhoek (chair) [[Inga-Britt Ahlenius]], Juan Antonio Carillo Salcedo, Pierre Lelong and [[Walter van Gerven]]&lt;/ref&gt; were appointed and President Santer agreed to "respond" to its findings.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; The report was produced on 15 March 1999 and was presented to the Commission and Parliament. It largely cleared most members, aside from Cresson, but concluded that there was growing reluctance of the Commissioners to acknowledge responsibility and that "It was becoming increasingly difficult to find anyone who had the slightest sense of responsibility."&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt;

[[Image:Santer Commission.jpg|thumb|The entire Santer Commission resigned in response to the report]]
In response to the report, PES withdrew their support from the Commission&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt; and joined the other groups stating that unless the Commission resigned of its own accord, it would be forced to do so.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt; So, on the night of 15 March, Santer announced the mass resignation of his Commission.&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt; The morning following the resignation, against the recommendation of his advisors, Santer attacked the conclusions of Committee.&lt;ref name="EV"/&gt; The report was seen to be even in criticising not only PES members but also the workings of the Commission itself. It also exposed the situation that neither Parliament, nor the President, could force the resignation of individual Commissioners as they could only be 'recalled' by national governments. Paris refused to recall Cresson,&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; who refused to resign of her own accord, which sparked the need for a mass resignation. Commissioner [[Mario Monti]] criticised this stating that "This Commission has collectively resigned, I believe, not because of collective responsibility but because certain members of it preferred not to take their own individual responsibilities."&lt;ref name="EV"&gt;{{cite web | last =Harding | first =Gareth | title =Unfolding drama of the Commission's demise | date =18 March 1999 | publisher =[[European Voice]] | url =http://www.europeanvoice.com/archive/article.asp?id=8627 | accessdate =2007-10-07 }}{{dead link|date=May 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Édith Cresson went before the [[European Court of Justice]] and, in July 2006, was found guilty but was not stripped of her pension.&lt;ref name="Cresson"&gt;{{cite web | title=Court rules against ex-French PM  | publisher =[[BBC News]]  | url =http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5167940.stm | accessdate = 2007-10-07  | date=11 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cresson today is largely held accountable for the fall of Santer, who went on to serve time as an MEP and never fully recovered, and the rest of his Commission.&lt;ref name="E!Sharp Jan8 EV"/&gt;

==Repercussions==
The immediate effect was that the politically weakened Commission was unable to react to the beginning of the [[Kosovo War]] and the close of the [[Agenda 2000]] negotiations. The crisis had compounded the already reduced powers of the Commission in favour of the Parliament's legislative power, the Council's foreign policy role and the ECB's financial role. However the change with Parliament was the most profound, the previous permanent cooperation between the two bodies came to an end with the shift in power.&lt;ref name="Topan"&gt;{{cite web | last = Topan | first = Angelina | title= The resignation of the Santer-Commission: the impact of 'trust' and 'reputation'  | publisher = European Integration online Papers | date = 30 September 2002 | url = http://eiop.or.at/eiop/texte/2002-014.htm | accessdate = 2007-10-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

It was hoped by the leaders in Parliament that such a political challenge would generate useful publicity ahead of the elections, with previous polls producing a low turn out with a perception of the body being powerless. In this respect the affair did generate extensive media attention with the Parliament now seeming 'dramatic'. The committee report also was written in an unusually accessible manner, filled with [[soundbite]]s. Further more it also drew greater attention from the Council to a Parliament willing to exercise its powers. Hence when the Council came in to agree on a new president, it was clear that the candidate had to be acceptable to parliament.&lt;ref name="Hoskyns"/&gt; The crisis also displayed the increasing party competition within the Parliament, leading to the development of a Parliamentary system between the executive and legislative branches. Indeed, it can be seen that the government-opposition dynamic of the two main parties in Parliament aggravated the development of the crisis and contributed to the downfall of the Commission.&lt;ref name="Ringe"/&gt;

The [[Prodi Commission]], which succeeded Marín's caretaker administration, announced a zero-tolerance approach to fraud. Following pressure from Parliament, the Commission quickly established [[OLAF]], an anti-fraud office which replaced the Unit for the Co-ordination of Fraud Protection (UCLAF) established in 1988&lt;ref name="OLAF"&gt;{{cite web|title=EU Budget Fraud |publisher=politics.co.uk |url=http://www.politics.co.uk/issue-briefs/europe/eu-budget/eu-budget-fraud/eu-budget-fraud-$366701.htm |accessdate=2007-10-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070211092606/http://www.politics.co.uk/issue-briefs/europe/eu-budget/eu-budget-fraud/eu-budget-fraud-$366701.htm |archivedate=11 February 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and seen as having failed in its duty.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt; OLAF was established with more powers and to be more independent, especially in terms of investigation where they are formally autonomous from the Commission.&lt;ref name="OLAF"/&gt; There were a few members who survived the Santer Commission to continue under Prodi: [[Franz Fischler]], [[Erkki Liikanen]], [[Mario Monti]] and [[Neil Kinnock]]. The latter was appointed to undertake institutional reform.&lt;ref name="ENA"/&gt;

The reappointment of some of these members showed that individual Commissioners still maintained their own reputations despite the massive loss of face of the institution as a whole, while Cresson would have never been able to have been reappointed. The Commission itself suffered from a loss of trust and reputation, only compounded by the post-Delors mood. Prodi had to deal with increased euroscepticism which helped bring down the Santer Commission. Since the end of the Delors era, pro-integrationism had given way with greater concern about the Commission's powers. By just 2000 the Council curbed the Commission's powers once more when they believed Prodi overstepped his remit.&lt;ref name="Topan"/&gt;

==College==
The Commission college had 20 members (two for the largest five member states, one each for the remainder) and included Commissioners from new member states Sweden, Finland and Austria. Had Norway not rejected EU membership in 1995, their Commissioner would have been [[Thorvald Stoltenberg]] who was proposed as [[European Commissioner for Fisheries &amp; Maritime Affairs|Commissioner for Fisheries]];&lt;ref name="Composition"&gt;{{cite web | title = Division of portfolios in the new Commission | date = 29 October 1994 | publisher =[[Europa (web portal)]] | url =http://europa.eu/rapid/pressReleasesAction.do?reference=IP/94/1002&amp;format=HTML&amp;aged=1&amp;language=EN&amp;guiLanguage=en | accessdate = 2008-01-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Great Seal of the [[State of Florida]]''' is used to represent the [[Government of Florida|government of the state of Florida]], and for various official purposes, such as to seal official documents and legislation. It is commonly used on state government buildings, vehicles and other effects of the state government. It also appears on the [[Flag of Florida|state flag of Florida]]. The University of Florida was bestowed the honor of using the seal as its university seal.

The seal features a shoreline on which a [[Seminole]] &lt;!--[[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] - phrase reads clunky and not crucial to article--&gt; woman is spreading flowers. Legend says that the woman is the historical heroine [[Milly Francis]], but there is no documentation supporting this.&lt;ref name=Milly&gt;{{cite book
|first=Dale
|last=Cox
|year=2013
|editor-first=Savannah
|editor-last=Brininstool
|isbn=9780615894058
|title=Milly Francis. The Life &amp; Times of the Creek Pocahontas}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|159}} Two [[Sabal palmetto|Sabal palm]]s (Florida's state tree) are growing. In the background a [[steamboat]] sails before a sun breaking the horizon, with rays of sunlight extending into the sky. The seal is encircled with the words "Great Seal of the State of Florida", and "[[In God We Trust]]" (the state motto).

==History==
The Florida Legislature in 1868 specified in a Joint Resolution the design of Florida's first seal. "The Resolution specified that the seal had to be the size of an American silver dollar. It also stated that the seal should contain the sun's rays, a cocoa tree, a steamboat, and a female Indian scattering flowers. These images were to be circled by the words 'Great Seal of the State of Florida: In God We Trust.'"

Several changes have occurred on the seal over the years. The Indian woman no longer has a feathered headdress, which female Seminoles did not wear. "A mountain in the background has been flattened (Florida has no mountains). The steamboat has been repaired a few times. And a sabal palm has been transplanted in place of the original cocoa tree to reflect the state's adoption of the sabal palmetto palm as the official state tree in 1953. The latest revisions took place in 1985."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Stand Up! Records''' is an American independent comedy [[record label]] founded in [[Minneapolis]], Minnesota, by former [[-ismist Recordings]] label head Dan Schlissel. Schlissel had released around 70 records with -ismist when his most promising act, [[Slipknot (band)|Slipknot]], dumped the label.&lt;ref name="StandUp! Records1"&gt;{{cite news | last =Smith| first =Rod| title =A Man Walks Into A Bar| publisher =City Pages| date = 28 January 2004 | url =http://citypages.com/databank/25/1208/article11849.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first act was signed to Stand Up! shortly afterwards, [[Lewis Black]] in 1999.&lt;ref name="StandUp!

== Discography ==
All releases from 2000 and 2001 were originally issued by -ismist Recordings, the predecessor to Stand Up! Records.  When the titles were repressed, starting in early 2002, the branding was switched to the Stand Up! Records imprint.  All titles from 2002 onward were originally issued by Stand Up! Records, unless under license from another label, or bringing an out of print release back into print.

'''''Stargate''''' is a [[Science fiction|science fiction]] [[media franchise]] based on the film written by [[Dean Devlin]] and [[Roland Emmerich]].  The franchise is based on the idea of an alien [[Einstein–Rosen bridge]] device (the [[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]) that enables nearly [[teleportation|instantaneous travel]] across the cosmos. The franchise began with the film ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'', released on October 28, 1994, by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] and [[Carolco]], which grossed [[United States dollar|US$]]197&amp;nbsp;million worldwide.&lt;ref name="estimated"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=stargate.htm |title=Stargate (1994) |publisher=Box Office Mojo | accessdate=2011-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="estimated2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.the-numbers.com/movies/1994/0SGTE.php|title=Movie Stargate - Box Office Data, News, Cast Information - The Numbers|publisher=Nash Information Services, LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1997, [[Brad Wright]] and [[Jonathan Glassner]] created a television series titled ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' as a sequel to the film. This show was joined by ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' in 2004, ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' in 2009, and a prequel web series, ''Stargate Origins'', in 2018. Also consistent with the same story are a variety of [[List of Stargate literature|books]], video games and [[List of Stargate comics|comic books]], as well as the [[direct-to-DVD]] movies ''[[Stargate: The Ark of Truth]]'' and ''[[Stargate: Continuum]]'', which concluded the first television show after 10 seasons.

In 2011, ''Stargate Universe'', the last ''Stargate'' program on television, ended its run. Brad Wright announced that there were no more plans to continue the same story in further productions.&lt;ref name="Colvin"&gt;{{Cite news |first=Chad | last=Colvin |title=SGU continuation, other movies dead — for now |url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/04/wright-sgu-continuation-other-movies-dead-for-now/ |work=GateWorld |date=April 17, 2011|accessdate=April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, comic publisher American Mythology acquired the rights to publish new ''Stargate Atlantis'' stories set within the established franchise canon. This was expanded in 2017 to include new ''Stargate Universe'' comics as well, resolving the cliffhanger that ended the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://boundingintocomics.com/2016/01/26/stargate-atlantis-continues-comic-book-form-april-american-mythology/|title='Stargate: Atlantis' Continues in Comic Book Form This April from American Mythology|last=Trent|first=John F.|date=2016-01-26|website=Bounding Into Comics|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://nerdist.com/stargate-universes-cliffhanger-resolved-comics/|title=STARGATE UNIVERSE’s Cliffhanger Will Be Resolved in Comics {{!}} Nerdist|date=2017-06-10|work=Nerdist|access-date=2017-07-21|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The predominant story arc thus ran on television for 15 years, including 17 seasons (354 episodes) of programming, and 8 comic book issues as of July 2017. However, a variety of other media either ignore this main continuity or resets it, while maintaining essential elements that define the franchise (mainly, the inclusion of a Stargate device). These include the 2002 animated series ''[[Stargate Infinity]].''

In 2017, the franchise was revived with the announcement of a new prequel web series, ''[[Stargate Origins]]''.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theverge.com/2017/7/20/16007184/stargate-origins-sg-1-mgm-sdcc-2017|title=Stargate is coming back as a digital-only prequel series|last=Liptak|first=Andrew|date=2017-07-20|website=The Verge|access-date=2017-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Episodes premiered on a central "fan hub" for the franchise called Stargate Command,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stargatecommand.co/ |title=Stargate: A Brand New Chapter |publisher=Stargatecommand.co |date=2017-07-20 |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a first season of ten 10-minute episodes.

==Premise==
''Stargate'' productions center on the premise of a "[[Stargate (device)|Stargate]]," a ring-shaped portal that enables rapid transportation to other stargates located cosmic distances away. The story begins when one such device is discovered on Earth. The 1994 film and subsequent television series depict how the device is kept under the control of the United States government, who use it to conduct interplanetary missions by dialing the thousands of stargates located in the galaxy, which are the legacy of an ancient civilization. The expeditions originally had the goal of acquiring extremely rare resources, new technology and detecting threats; but often face scientific and humanitarian issues and the dilemmas of interacting with different societies. Finally they resulted in a unified ''United Nation''-coalition to better support the constant need to continue the program to defend Earth from invading aliens.

Combined with the notion that the Stargate is a secret, ''Stargate'' productions are notable for presenting no contradiction with reality, being set in the [[present day]] on an otherwise normal Earth, and being dominated by human interaction in the galaxy. In the story of the 1994 film, this is explained as being the result of forced deportations by aliens, with the suggestion that most ancient [[mythology|mythologies]] are the result of aliens posing as gods in the distant past (as in the unproven [[ancient astronaut hypothesis]]).

The longest-running series, ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' sets the context having the ''[[Milky Way]]'' galaxy as a [[failed state]] in which Goa'uld System Lords war against each other. Goa'uld used superior technology to pose as gods to the human populations who had been deported from Earth to everywhere in the galaxy; these people are kept in poverty, ignorance and slavery. The US Stargate Command represents simultaneously a higher level of civilization and a lower level of technology during conflicts. Only a small portion of stargate dial numbers do not lead to planets dominated by the Goa'uld.

==Franchise releases==
Due to multiple developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, the various ''Stargate'' productions are not entirely consistent with each other; and while no set of works forms an official [[canon (fiction)|canon]],&lt;ref name="gateworldbradwright"&gt;{{Cite interview|subject=Brad Wright |interviewer= Darren Sumner |work=GateWorld |title=Brad Wright Interview |location=Chicago | accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; the largest [[fanbase|following]] exists for the three live-action series.&lt;ref name="gateworldomnipedia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/omnipedia/faq.shtml#5 |website=GateWorld |title=GateWorld Omnipedia |accessdate=May 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/61Fh0Qz5N?url=http://www.gateworld.net/omnipedia/faq.shtml#5 |archivedate=August 27, 2011 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Through the work of various authors and developers, at least six separate story cycles can be discerned, some of which are continuations of the other ones (either endorsed or unendorsed by their predecessor).

==''Stargate'' franchise timeline==
{{Stargate timeline}}

==Theatrical films==

===''Stargate''===
{{main|Stargate (film)}}

In 1994, the [[military science fiction]] feature film ''Stargate'' was released, directed by [[Roland Emmerich]] and co-written by Emmerich and [[Dean Devlin]]. The film lays the foundation for all the Stargate productions that come after it, by explaining the notion, function, and history of the Stargate.

The film begins with the unearthing of the Stargate in [[Giza]] in 1928. In a [[present day]], ''i.e.'', 1994, military base in Creek Mountain, Colorado, discredited [[Egyptology|Egyptologist]] [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Daniel Jackson]] ([[James Spader]]) enables use of the Stargate when he recognizes that symbols on the [[cover stone]]s of the Stargate are [[Asterism (astronomy)|asterisms]] used in a three dimensional coordinate system. A team led by Colonel [[Jack O'Neill|Jack O'Neil]] ([[Kurt Russell]]) is ordered to step through the Stargate and identify potential military threats on the other side. Jackson accompanies them to operate the other Stargate with his knowledge of the coordinate system. The team discovers a [[slave]] civilization serving an alien who is [[Ra (Stargate)|posing as the Egyptian god Ra]] ([[Jaye Davidson]]). Ra and his minions have taken human form, dominating the slaves with brute force. With the help of the locals, O'Neil's team is eventually able to instigate a [[slave rebellion]], overwhelming Ra's forces. Ra escapes in his mothership, but O'Neil is able to [[Teleportation|teleport]] a nuclear warhead on-board Ra's ship in orbit and detonate it. With Ra dead, the civilization can live in peace; O'Neil and his team return home through the Stargate, but Daniel Jackson stays on the planet with a young local woman named [[Sha'uri]].

=== Other releases and possible future development {{anchor|Future productions}} ===
After Bill McCay had written a [[Stargate film novels|series of five novels]] continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite the success of the ''Stargate'' television series, [[Dean Devlin]] stated in 2006 that "he has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that will pick up the story from the 1994 original"&lt;ref name="newstargatefilmfromorg"/&gt; According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader. Devlin regretted giving MGM control over the franchise.&lt;ref name="newstargatefilmfromorg"/&gt; The first movie already tapped into Egyptian mythology; the second one would have moved into other mythologies; and the third would tie all the mythologies together.&lt;ref name="comingsoon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/movienews.php?id=15537 |title=Devlin Announces Plans For Stargate Sequels |website=ComingSoon.net | accessdate=April 3, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'' producer Brad Wright said in 2002 that "Devlin can wish to do a sequel to ''Stargate'' all he wants. MGM owns the rights, and I doubt very much that they'll ask him to do it. He knows better."&lt;ref name="gateworldinterview"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/brad_wright.shtml |title=Interview: Brad Wright |website=GateWorld |accessdate=April 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319011631/http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/brad_wright.shtml |archivedate=March 19, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Plans for producing two sequels of the original film were announced by the original film's creator Dean Devlin at the 2006 [[San Diego Comic-Con]]. He was in talks with MGM to produce four films and he wanted two of them to be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy. In an interview with [[Sci Fi Wire]], Devlin said that should the sequels be made, he hoped to enlist [[Kurt Russell]] and [[James Spader]] in the two sequels. Both Russell and Spader expressed interest, Devlin revealed. "They've always said they wanted to do it. The irony is actually because it was 12 years ago that we made Stargate, [and] part two was actually supposed to take place about 12 years later. We were just going to kind of age them up as actors. So it actually works out really nicely." These sequels would bypass the 12 years of mythology created by ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' if they are ever produced.&lt;ref name="newstargatefilmfromorg"/&gt;

Dean Devlin spoke out again on July 4, 2011 stating that he hadn't given up on the idea of sequels to his 1994 feature film. He talked about the idea again in a new interview with Collider. Devlin actually wrote it as a trilogy of movies, but was never able to do parts two and three.  His hope was, as the series started to wind down, that perhaps it would be time to actually get to do parts two and three.

Devlin has said "I think it'll change a little bit from our original idea since so many years have passed." "We wanted to explore the idea of how the Stargates were built originally, and where else in the universe they exist, and why they exist — and where else they exist on Earth. We had really planned out, as a trilogy of films, to allow this mythology to grow bigger and bigger."&lt;ref name="gateworldinterview2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gateworld.net/news/2011/07/devlin-still-talking-stargate-movie-sequels/ |title=Interview: Darren |website=GateWorld | accessdate=July 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was announced that [[MGM]] and [[Warner Bros.]] are partnering with both Emmerich and Devlin for a reboot of Stargate as a trilogy with Emmerich directing and Devlin producing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://variety.com/2014/film/news/mgm-warner-bros-team-with-roland-emmerich-dean-devlin-on-stargate-reboot-1201196082/|title=MGM, Warner Bros.

{{main|Stargate SG-1}}
[[File:Sg1-poster.jpg|thumb|upright|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate SG-1]]''.]]
In 1997, [[Jonathan Glassner]] and [[Brad Wright]] co-developed ''Stargate SG-1'', a television series intended to continue the story laid down by the original film. Although new actors were cast, several roles from the film were reprised, including the main characters Daniel Jackson and Jack O'Neill (which was re-spelled to include an extra "L"). The [[Stargate Command]] setting was transferred from a fictional military facility located in Creek Mountain, to the [[Cheyenne Mountain Complex]]. Other variations and differences between the original film and ''SG-1'' mostly concern the location of the planet [[Abydos (Stargate)|Abydos]], the alien [[Ra (Stargate)|Ra]], the race of Ra's underlings ([[Jaffa (Stargate)|Jaffa]]), and Stargate travel.&lt;ref name=nytimes &gt;{{cite web |author=Will Joyner |title=Through a Gate to the Far Side of the Universe: A TV Series |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9C05E5D7163AF935A15754C0A961958260 |website=The New York Times |date=July 26, 1997 |accessdate=October 15, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/dna/h2g2/A765597 |title=Stargate SG-1 – TV Shows |publisher=BBC | accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The series debuted on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]] on July 27, 1997, and moved to the [[Syfy|Sci-Fi Channel]] after its fifth season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-08/14/12.30.sfc |title=Announcement from SciFi Channel |website=SciFi Wire |accessdate=May 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080615095958/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/art-main.html?2001-08%2F14%2F12.30.sfc |archivedate=June 15, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It starred [[Richard Dean Anderson]] (as [[Jack O'Neill|O'Neill]]) and [[Michael Shanks]] (as [[Daniel Jackson (Stargate)|Jackson]]), alongside [[Amanda Tapping]], [[Christopher Judge]] and [[Don S. Davis]] respectively playing the new characters [[Samantha Carter]], [[Teal'c]] and [[George Hammond (Stargate)|George Hammond]]. The cast remained fairly regular for most of ''SG-1'''s run, but experienced some changes. [[Michael Shanks]] left the show at the end of Season 5 and was replaced by [[Corin Nemec]] as [[Jonas Quinn]]. Shanks returned at the beginning of Season 7 and Nemec was written out. At the end of Season 7 [[Don S. Davis|Davis]] left the show and Anderson filled the gap he left in the story. Season 9 saw the departure of [[Richard Dean Anderson|Anderson]], but added new regulars [[Beau Bridges]] and [[Ben Browder]]. After a debut episode in Season 8, followed by appearances in eight episodes of Season 9, [[Claudia Black]]'s popular reception earned her a position in the regular cast in Season 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thescifiworld.net/interviews/claudia_black_01.htm|title=Interview – Vala joins ''SG-1'' regulars|website=SciFi World | accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[MGM]] put an average of $1,400,000 into each episode of the show, and regards it as one of its most important franchises.&lt;ref name="Stargate 200"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.multichannel.com/article/CA6332083.html|title=''Stargate 200'': 10 years of ''Stargate'' success|website=MultiChannel | accessdate=May 5, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''SG-1'' was taken off air in 2007; however, two [[Direct-to-video|direct-to-DVD]] movies entitled ''[[#The Ark of Truth &amp; Continuum|The Ark of Truth]] and [[Stargate Continuum]]'' were made to tie up loose ends.

In June 2009, "[[Children of the Gods]]", ''Stargate SG-1'''s pilot episode, was re-cut into a ''Stargate SG-1'' direct-to-DVD movie with brand new visual effects and scenes not previously included in the television version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.uk/Stargate-SG-1-Children-Gods-Final/dp/B002AN3QAQ/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1351774269&amp;sr=8-1 |title=Stargate SG-1 - Children of The Gods Final Cut DVD: Amazon.co.uk: Richard Dean Anderson, Michael Shanks, Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge, Don S.

===''Atlantis''===
{{main|Stargate Atlantis}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Sga poster 1.JPG|thumb|upright|The original starring cast of ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]''.]] --&gt;
The ''Stargate Atlantis'' series follows the adventures of the "Atlantis expedition", a combination of military forces and civilian scientists that travel to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus Galaxy]] in search of the Lost City of [[Atlantis (Stargate)|Atlantis]], left behind by the most powerful race known to ever have lived, referred to as the [[Ancient (Stargate)|Ancients]], also known as Lanteans and [[Alterans]]. The finding of the city had been a plot arc for most of ''SG-1'''s Season 7, and the Ancients themselves had been a long-running facet of the ''SG-1'' setting. Arriving at the City, the expedition discovers Atlantis rests at the bottom of an ocean, protected by shields keeping the City habitable. As the Atlantis Expedition Team explores the myriad corridors and equipment, they quickly drain the already nearly depleted power source (known as a [[Zero Point Module|ZPM]]) allowing the shields to hold and Atlantis remain watertight. As an emergency default "programme", Atlantis detects this sudden power drop, activates a failsafe, the City surfaces, and appears as an island in the middle of an ocean.

Using small ships discovered in the City, Team Members fly and discover the mainland, where they explore, meet the Indigenous Population, and learn that the Pegasus Galaxy is dominated by a terrible enemy known as the "[[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]]." Although first encountered whilst in a long-term hibernation state, the Expedition unintentionally and prematurely wakes the [[Wraith (Stargate)|Wraith]], alerting them to the reemergence of Atlantis, a new race of humans, and a potential new feeding ground: The Milky Way Galaxy. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Team must defend and protect the City, the Locals, and the entire Expedition.  

''Stargate Atlantis'' was a spin-off television series from ''Stargate SG-1''.  A new feature film was originally intended to transition the two series after the sixth season of ''SG-1''.  Later, ''SG-1'' was renewed for a seventh season, and the feature film was then planned to transition that season.  Finally, when ''SG-1'' was renewed for an eighth season, the intended film instead became the two-part [[season finale]] episode "[[Lost City (Stargate SG-1)|Lost City]]", and the setting of ''Stargate Atlantis'' was moved to the [[Pegasus Galaxy (Stargate)|Pegasus galaxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | author=Sharon Gosling | title = Stargate Atlantis: The Official Companion Season 1 | date = 2005 | publisher=Titan Books | location = London | isbn = 978-1-84576-116-5 | pages = 10–14 | chapter = Watergate }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same [[fictional universe]], and later the two shows even become interconnected. ''Atlantis'' was developed by most of the same people and in the same studios as ''SG-1''.

''Atlantis'' debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel on July 16, 2004, starring [[Joe Flanigan]] and [[Torri Higginson]] in the lead roles, with [[Rainbow Francks|Rainbow Sun Francks]], [[David Hewlett]], and [[Rachel Luttrell]] alongside. Hewlett and Higginson's characters had previously appeared in ''SG-1'' (though Higginson inherited the role from actress [[Jessica Steen]]). In ''Atlantis''' second season, [[Paul McGillion]] and [[Jason Momoa]] (replacing Francks) were added as regulars. At the end of the third season, Higginson and McGillion were removed as regulars, both serving recurring roles in the 4th season. Season 4 brought in Amanda Tapping, reprising her role as Samantha Carter from SG-1, and [[Jewel Staite]] in a recurring role. Tapping left the show for season five to concentrate on ''[[Sanctuary (web series)|Sanctuary]]'', and was replaced by [[Robert Picardo]], who reprised his role as [[Richard Woolsey]] from both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''. However, in late summer 2008 it was announced that SciFi would not renew ''Atlantis''. The final episode aired on January 9, 2009.

{{main|Stargate Universe}}
''[[Stargate Universe]]'' is the third live-action ''Stargate'' series, and premiered on October 2, 2009. The series was pitched to the [[Syfy|Sci Fi Channel]] in the fall of 2007, just before the writer's strike—which put a hold on the project. "The pitch was received very well," according to Stargate Atlantis co-creator Brad Wright. Sci Fi Channel ordered ''Universe'' after announcing the cancellation of ''Stargate Atlantis''. Syfy announced on December 16, 2010 that they would not pick the show up for a third season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2010/12/syfy-cancels-stargate-universe|title=Syfy Cancels "Stargate Universe"|accessdate=December 16, 2010 |date=December 16, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The final episode aired May 9, 2011.

The show follows the crew as they struggle to survive on board ''Destiny'' with no apparent way home. The show was intended to have a darker tone than its predecessors and delve more into the humanity of the characters and their relationships with each other.

On April 17, 2011, ''Stargate'' writer and executive producer Brad Wright announced that the ''SGU'' movie is not going to happen. He also confirmed that the proposed ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' movies have been permanently shelved, along with another movie idea he had been trying to get a greenlight on that would have involved cast members of all three series. Still, Wright did not rule out future ''Stargate'' films, saying; "It's a franchise. ''Stargate'' is not over. Somebody smart from MGM is going to figure it out, and something will happen."&lt;ref name="Colvin" /&gt;

In May 2014, MGM announced a re-imagined version of the original 1994 film to be produced as a trilogy with Warner Bros. Pictures. Emmerich will direct and Devlin will produce. This set of two sequel films to the original ''Stargate'' starring Kurt Russell and James Spader will take a dramatically different course than the ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' universe created in the following 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mgm.com/#/news/189&lt;/ref&gt; On November 17, 2016, Devlin told Empire Online that the plans to make a reboot and potential new series are stalled.&lt;ref name="nov2016" /&gt;

The writers and producers of ''Stargate SG-1'', ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' and ''[[Stargate Universe]]'' and the main [[canon (fiction)|canon]] of the ''Stargate'' franchise were not involved with ''Infinity'', and neither MGM, the production teams nor the fans of ''Stargate'' consider ''Infinity'' to be an official part of the ''Stargate'' universe. According to ''Stargate SG-1'' co-creator [[Brad Wright]], the animated series should not be considered official ''Stargate'' [[canon (fiction)|canon]]. Commenting on it, he stated, "I don't have a problem with it. I'm just not involved."&lt;ref name="wright"&gt;{{cite web | author=Sumner, Darren | url=http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/brad_wright.shtml | title=Brad Wright (Interview) | date=2001 | website=GateWorld | accessdate=June 7, 2009 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319011631/http://www.gateworld.net/interviews/brad_wright.shtml | archivedate=March 19, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Stargate'' took in $16.7&amp;nbsp;million on its opening weekend,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://boxofficemojo.com/alltime/weekends/month/?mo=10&amp;p=.htm| title=Top Opening Weekends By Month | publisher=boxofficemojo.com | accessdate=April 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and received mixed reactions from critics; while it was panned by some critics such as [[Roger Ebert]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | author=Roger Ebert | url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19941028/REVIEWS/410280308/1023 | title=Stargate |work=Sun Times | accessdate=April 4, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; several positive reviews counterbalanced this leading to a score of 46% on [[Rotten Tomatoes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stargate/?name_order=asc |title=Stargate |work=Rotten Tomatoes |accessdate=April 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110615011810/http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/stargate/?name_order=asc |archivedate=June 15, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the film was originally intended as the first of a trilogy of films,&lt;ref name="newstargatefilmfromorg"&gt;{{cite web|author=Patrick Lee |url=http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=37194 |title=Devlin Develops New ''Stargates'' |website=Sci-Fi.com |accessdate=April 3, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319020050/http://www.scifi.com/scifiwire/index.php?category=0&amp;id=37194 |archivedate=March 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Emmerich and Devlin ultimately moved on to produce ''[[Independence Day (1996 film)|Independence Day]]'', and it was not until 2006 that Devlin showed renewed interest in developing sequels.&lt;ref name="ignrusselspader"&gt;{{cite web|author=Stax |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2006/07/21/comic-con-2006-devlin-on-stargate-sequels |title=Comic-Con 2006: Devlin on Stargate Sequels |publisher= [[Ziff Davis]] |website= [[IGN]] |date=2006-07-21 |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the intervening time, copyright-holder [[MGM]] succeeded the film with the television series ''Stargate SG-1'' without the input of Emmerich and Devlin.

According to ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Atlantis'' co-creator [[Brad Wright]], the show is popular in Great Britain, Germany, France and Australia, but with a steadily declining viewership in [[homeland]] Canada.

==Literature==
{{main|Stargate literature|List of Stargate comics|List of Stargate audiobooks}}
There are three series of novels based on the Stargate franchise, one based on the original ''[[Stargate (film)|Stargate]]'' film and two based in the ''[[Stargate SG-1]]'' and ''[[Stargate Atlantis]]'' television shows. A series of books written by [[Bill McCay]] were published from 1995 to 1999 that were unofficial sequels to the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/m/bill-mccay/ |title=Bill McCay |website=Fantasy Fiction |accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; These were produced by consulting the original notes made by [[Dean Devlin]] and [[Roland Emmerich]], in an attempt to envision where the film "would have gone". Neither party has commented on whether McCay's interpretation was correct. Despite attempting to remain close to the original vision, the subsequent television series ''Stargate SG-1'' (which began under an entirely independent development) developed the story along different lines, making no attempt to reconcile the plot lines of the books. This marked the first major branching of the franchise.

From 1999 to 2001, [[New American Library|ROC]] published four novels based in ''Stargate SG-1'' written by [[Ashley McConnell]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fantasticfiction.co.uk/m/ashley-mcconnell/stargate-sg1.htm |title=SG-1 by Ashley McConnell |website=Fantasy Fiction |accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2004, UK-based [[Fandemonium (publisher)|Fandemonium Press]] started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on ''Stargate SG-1''. Due to the conflict with ROC's license, these books were available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK, but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006. The official ''Stargate Magazine'', produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both ''SG-1'' and ''Atlantis''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://titanmagazines.com/app?service=external/Product&amp;sp=l12 |title=Stargate Magazine |website=Titan Magazines |accessdate=July 7, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090713232122/http://titanmagazines.com/app?service=external%2FProduct&amp;sp=l12 |archivedate=July 13, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of [[comic book]]s, based on ''Stargate SG-1'' and ''Stargate Atlantis'', began to be published by [[Avatar Press]] in 2003. Five have been published to date, with stories by James Anthony and artwork by Jorge Correa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.avatarpress.com/stargate/ |title=Stargate |website=Avatar Press |accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008 it was announced that [[Big Finish Productions]] would release officially licensed [[audiobook]]s featuring members of the cast reading new stories. The first two stories, available on CD and digital download, are ''[[Gift of the Gods]]'' read by [[Michael Shanks]] and ''[[A Necessary Evil (Stargate audio)|A Necessary Evil]]'' read by [[Torri Higginson]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.bigfinish.com/Stargate-SG-1-and-Atlantis |title=Stargate SG-1 and Atlantis |website=Big Finish Production |accessdate=July 7, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brock]] - second edition 2006&lt;/ref&gt; A specialist in Syriac studies is known as a '''Syriacist'''. Specifically, British, French, and German scholars of the 18th and 19th centuries who were involved in the study of Syriac/Aramaic language and literature were commonly known by this designation, at a time when the Syriac language was little understood outside [[Assyrian people|Assyrian]], [[Syriac Christian]] and [[Maronite Christian]] communities. In Germany the field of study is distinguished between ''Aramaistik'' (Aramaic studies) and ''Neuaramaistik'' (Neo-Aramaic (Syriac) studies).

At universities Syriac studies are mostly incorporated into a more 'general' field of studies, such as [[Eastern Christianity]] at the [[SOAS, University of London|School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London]], [[Aramaic studies]] at the [[University of Oxford]] and [[University of Leiden]], [[Eastern Christianity]] at [[Duke University]],&lt;ref&gt;Eastern Crossroads: Essays on Medieval Christian Legacy - Page 391 Juan Pedro Monferrer Sala - 2007 "Not because this list would be very long, but since Syriac Studies are mostly incorporated into a more general field of studies, e.g. [[Aramaic studies]] (as is the case, e.g. at the Universities of Oxford or Leiden), or Eastern Christianity, as in Duke, ..."&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Semitic studies]] at the [[Freie Universität Berlin]]. Most students learn the [[Syriac language]] within a [[biblical studies]] program.&lt;ref&gt;Orientalia christiana periodica - Volume 74 - Page 564 Pontificium Institutum Orientalium Studiorum - 2008 "(a question those of us in Syriac studies are too often asked). Then, posing the question, why study Syriac, he situates the field within the broader academy. While most students learn Syriac within a biblical studies program, Syriac also impacts ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Conferences for Syriac studies include the Symposium Syriacum,&lt;ref&gt;VI Symposium Syriacum 1992: University of Cambridge 1994 Page 14 "René Lavenant, Pontificium Institutum Orientalium Studiorum - 1994 "must have felt in 1892: Syriac studies were very much alive then — however restricted the number of scholars working in the field at the time; Syriac studies are even more alive today — as the large registration at this conference ..."&lt;/ref&gt; the Section "Bible and Syriac Studies in Context" at the International Meetings of the [[Society of Biblical Literature]],&lt;ref name=sbl1&gt;http://www.sbl-site.org/meetings/Congresses_CallForPaperDetails.aspx?MeetingId=22&amp;VolunteerUnitId=594&lt;/ref&gt; and the Section "Syriac Literature and Interpretations of Sacred Texts" at the Annual Meetings of the Society of Biblical Literature.&lt;ref name=sbl1/&gt;  

Syriac academic journals include the annual ''Oriens Christianus'' ([[Wiesbaden]]) and ''Syriac Studies Today''.&lt;ref&gt;Eastern churches review - Volume 1 - Page 370 1966 "... assisted by periodicals devoted to Christian oriental studies; the most important for Syriac studies are the annual Oriens Christianus (Wiesbaden) and 370 Syriac Studies Today by Robert Murray, SJ."&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Trivial Pursuit''''' is a [[board game]] from [[Canada]] in which winning is determined by a player's ability to answer [[trivia|general knowledge]] and [[popular culture]] questions.

Dozens of question sets have been released for the game. The question cards are organized into themes; for instance, in the standard Genus question set, questions in green deal with science and nature. Some question sets have been designed for younger players, and others for a specific time period or as [[promotion (marketing)|promotion]]al tie-ins (such as ''[[Star Wars]]'', ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'', and ''[[The Lord of the Rings]]'' movies).

==History==
The game was created in December 1979 in Montreal in [[Quebec]], by Canadian [[Chris Haney (Trivial Pursuit)|Chris Haney]], a photo editor for Montreal's ''[[The Gazette (Montreal)|The Gazette]]'', and [[Scott Abbott]], a sports editor for ''[[The Canadian Press]]''.&lt;ref name="Trivial Pursuit History"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/trivialpursuit.htm |title=Trivial Pursuit History |publisher=ideafinder.com |date= |accessdate=2017-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; After finding pieces of their ''[[Scrabble]]'' game missing, they decided to create their own game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mary Bellis |url=http://inventors.about.com/library/inventors/bl_trivia_pursuit.htm |title=The History of '&amp;#39;Trivial Pursuit'&amp;#39; |publisher=Inventors.about.com |date= |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the help of John Haney and Ed Werner, they completed development of the game, which was released in 1981.&lt;ref name="Trivial Pursuit History"/&gt;

In [[North America]], the game's popularity peaked in 1984, a year in which over 20 million games were sold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fascinating facts about the invention of TRIVIAL PURSUIT|url=http://www.ideafinder.com/history/inventions/trivialpursuit.htm|website=The Great Idea Finder|accessdate=12 November 2016|date=May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rights to the game were initially licensed to [[Selchow and Righter]] in 1982, then to [[Parker Brothers]] (now part of [[Hasbro]]) in 1988, after initially being turned down by the [[Virgin Group]]; in 2008 Hasbro bought the full rights, for US$80 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |work=[[CBC News]]|url=http://www.cbc.ca/money/story/2008/03/31/trivial-sale.html |title=Trivial Pursuit sells for a non-trivial sum: $80 million US |publisher=Cbc.ca |date=31 March 2008 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{As of|2004}}, nearly 88 million games had been sold in 26 countries and 17 languages. Northern Plastics of [[Elroy, Wisconsin]] produced 30,000,000 games between 1983 and 1985. In December 1993, Trivial Pursuit was named to the "Games Hall of Fame" by [[Games (magazine)|''Games'' magazine]]. An online version of ''Trivial Pursuit'' was launched in September 2003.&lt;ref name=ward&gt;{{cite web |first=Eric |last=Ward |url=http://www.urlwire.com/news/092903.html |title=Trivial Pursuit Launches Online Version |publisher=Urlwire.com |date=29 September 2003 |accessdate=2012-07-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gameplay==
[[File:Trivialpursuit Token.jpg|thumb|A ''Trivial Pursuit'' playing piece, with all six wedges filled]]
The object of the game is to move around the board by correctly answering trivia questions. Questions are split into six categories, with each one having its own color to readily identify itself; in the classic version of ''Trivial Pursuit'', these are [[Geography]] (blue), [[Entertainment]] (pink), [[History]] (yellow), Arts &amp; [[Literature]] (originally brown, later purple), [[Science]] &amp; [[Nature]] (green), and [[Sports]] &amp; Leisure (orange). The game includes a board, playing pieces, question cards, a box, small plastic wedges to fit into the playing pieces, and a die.

Playing pieces used in ''Trivial Pursuit'' are round and divided into six sections, similar to a [[cheese spread|cheese triangle]]. A small plastic wedge, sometimes called cheese,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Stelfox|first1=Hilarie|title=Tried and tested family games for Christmas|url=http://www.examiner.co.uk/whats-on/family-kids-news/13-board-games-keep-family-12326946|work=Huddersfield Examiner|date=19 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; can be placed into each of these sections to mark each player's progress.

During the game, players move their playing pieces around a track which is shaped like a wheel with six spokes. This track is divided into spaces of different colors, and the center of the board is a hexagonal "hub" space. At the end of each spoke is a "category headquarters" space. When a player's counter lands on a square, the player answers a question according to the color of the square, which corresponds to one of the six categories. If the player answers the question correctly, his turn continues; if the player's piece was on one of the category headquarters spaces, he/she collect a wedge of the same color, which fits into the playing piece. Some spaces say "roll again," giving an extra roll of the die to the player. The hub is a "wild" space; a player landing here may answer a question in the category of his choice. Questions must be answered without any outside assistance. Any number of playing pieces may occupy the same space at the same time. A variant rule ends a player's turn on collecting a wedge, preventing a single knowledgeable player from running the board.

Once a player has collected one wedge of each color and filled up his playing piece, he must return to the hub and answer a question in a category selected by the other players. If this question is answered correctly, that player wins the game. Otherwise, the player must leave the center of the board and try again on the next turn.

==Editions==
[[File:Trivial Pursuit.jpg|thumb|Board and pieces of Trivial Pursuit.]]
{{Main article|List of Trivial Pursuit editions}}
Over the years, numerous editions of ''Trivial Pursuit'' have been produced, usually specializing in various fields. The original version is known as the ''Genus'' edition (or ''Genus I''). Several other general knowledge editions (such as ''Genus II'') have followed. Some include, Junior Edition (1985), All-Star Sports, Baby Boomers, 1980s, All About the 80s, and 1990s.

In the United Kingdom, ''Trivial Pursuit'' players complained that the 2006 version of the game was "[[dumbing down|dumbed down]]" in comparison to previous editions, with easier questions and more focus on celebrities and show business.&lt;ref name=telegraph&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/1537151/Trivial-brain-teasers-enrage-games-fans.html |title=Trivial 'brain-teasers' enrage game's fans |work=[[The Telegraph (UK)|The Telegraph]] |publisher=Telegraph.co.uk |date=17 December 2006 |first1=Beth |last1=Jones |first2=Julie |last2=Henry |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal action==

===Fred Worth lawsuit===
In October 1984, Fred L. Worth, author of ''[[The Trivia Encyclopedia]]'', ''Super Trivia'', and ''Super Trivia II'', filed a $300 million lawsuit against the distributors of ''Trivial Pursuit''. He claimed that more than a quarter of the questions in the game's Genus Edition had been taken from his books, even to the point of reproducing typographical errors and [[fictitious entry|deliberately placed misinformation]]. One of the questions in ''Trivial Pursuit'' was "What was [[Columbo (character)|Columbo]]'s first name?" with the answer "Philip". That information had been [[Fictitious entry|fabricated to catch]] anyone who might try to [[Copyright infringement|violate his copyright]].&lt;ref name=overend&gt;{{cite news| url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=gOYKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=2U8DAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4598%2C4685968| publisher=[[The Daily Courier (Arizona)|The Courier]]| location=[[Prescott, Arizona]]| title=Trivial Suit| date=25 October 1984| last=Overend| first=William| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventors of ''Trivial Pursuit'' acknowledged that Worth's books were among their sources, but argued that this was not improper and that facts are not protected by copyright. The district court judge agreed, ruling in favor of the ''Trivial Pursuit'' inventors. The decision was appealed, and in September 1987 the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit]] upheld the ruling.&lt;ref name=9cir&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Worth v. Selchow &amp; Righter Company |vol=827 |reporter=F.2d |opinion=596 |court=9th Cir. |date=1987 |url=http://law.justia.com/cases/federal/appellate-courts/F2/827/569/3179/}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Worth asked the [[Supreme Court of the United States]] to review the case, but the Court declined, denying [[certiorari]] in March 1988.&lt;ref name=supreme&gt;{{cite court |litigants=Worth v. Selchow &amp; Righter Co. |vol=485 |reporter=U.S. |opinion=977 |date=1988 |url=http://wy.findacase.com/research/wfrmDocViewer.aspx/xq/fac./SCT/1988/19880328_0041517.SCT.htm/qx}} (''cert. denied.'')&lt;/ref&gt;

===David Wall lawsuit===
In 1994, David Wall of [[Cape Breton Regional Municipality|Cape Breton, Nova Scotia]], launched a lawsuit against the game's creators. He claimed that in the fall of 1979, he and a friend were hitchhiking near [[Sydney, Nova Scotia]], when they were picked up by Chris Haney. Wall claimed that he told Haney about his idea for the game in detail, including the shape of the markers.

Wall's mother testified she found drawings of his that looked like plans for a ''Trivial Pursuit''-like game, but the drawings had since been destroyed. Wall's friend, who was allegedly hitchhiking with him that day, never testified. Haney said he never met Wall.

Over the years, there was much legal wrangling, notably around whether the suit should be decided by a judge or jury. On June 25, 2007, the [[Nova Scotia Supreme Court]] ruled against Wall.&lt;ref name=abcnews&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2007/06/26/1962864.htm |title=Hitchhiker loses Trivial Pursuit rights battle | work=[[ABC News (Australia)|Australian Broadcasting Corporation News]] |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=26 June 2007 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===Television===
{{See also|Trivial Pursuit (U.S. game show)||Trivial Pursuit (UK game show)|Trivial Pursuit: America Plays}}
A version of ''Trivial Pursuit'', hosted by [[Wink Martindale]], aired on [[ABC Family|The Family Channel]] in the [[United States]] from 1993 to 1995 ([[Jay Wolpert]] had attempted a pilot in 1987, but it was not picked up). A [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] version entitled ''[[Trivial Pursuit: America Plays]]'' aired from 2008 to 2009 and hosted by [[Christopher Knight (actor)|Christopher Knight]]. In September 2004, [[Roger Lodge]] hosted a sports trivia game show on [[ESPN]] entitled ''ESPN Trivial Pursuit'', which aired five episodes.

[[BBC Television]] produced a ''Trivial Pursuit'' [[game show]] based on the game in the [[UK]] hosted by [[Rory McGrath]]. Another British version (with rules/format similar to the Wink Martindale version, and also using the same theme tune as the Wink Martindale version) was hosted on [[Challenge TV|The Family Channel (now Challenge)]] by [[Tony Slattery]]. [[Birgit Lechtermann]] hosted a version for [[VOX (TV channel)|VOX]] in [[Germany]] from 1993 to 1994.

In 1988, a made-for-television movie entitled ''Breaking all the Rules: The Creation of Trivial Pursuit'' aired. Treated largely as a comedy, the movie featured the music of [[Jimmy Buffett]] and portrayed the creators of the game as three beer-loving Canadians.

In [[Spain]], a version of the show called ''Trivial Pursuit: Spain Plays'' premiered in September 2008 on [[Antena 3 (Spain)|Antena 3]].&lt;ref name=antenna3&gt;{{cite news| title=Trivial deals, new gameshow for Debmar-Mercury| url=http://www.c21media.net/trivial-deals-new-gameshow-for-debmar-mercury/?ss=trivial+pursuit+spain| publisher=C21 Media| last=Grant| first=Jules| date=6 April 2008| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arcade game===
In 1984, [[Bally Sente]] released a ''Trivial Pursuit'' arcade game.&lt;ref name=arcade&gt;{{cite web| title=Trivial Pursuit| url=http://www.arcade-museum.com/game_detail.php?game_id=10199| publisher=International Arcade Museum| accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like the board game, several variants were also released.

===Home computer games===
British software company [[Domark]] released a home computer version (billed as ''Trivial Pursuit: The Computer Game'') for multiple formats during the 1980s.&lt;ref name="page6"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.page6.org/archive/issue_26/page_24.htm |title=Issue 26 - Trivial Pursuit| publisher=Page 6| date=March–April 1987| last=Davison| first=John S. |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cpcpower"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.cpc-power.com/index.php?page=detail&amp;onglet=jaquette&amp;num=2297| title=Trivial Pursuit Edition Genus |publisher=cpc-power.com |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="zxsoftware"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.zxsoftware.co.uk/gamedetails.php?id=6555|title=ZXSoftware.co.uk|publisher=ZXSoftware.co.uk|date=|accessdate=2012-07-07|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130309145154/http://www.zxsoftware.co.uk/gamedetails.php?id=6555|archivedate=2013-03-09|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="lemon64"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D3125 |title=Trivial Pursuit: Commodore-Genus Edition |publisher=Lemon64.com |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; This version included pictorial and musical questions&lt;ref name="ysorig"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuit.htm |title=Trivial Pursuit |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |date=November 1986 |first=Gwen |last=Hughes |accessdate=2014-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140618224434/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuit.htm |archive-date=2014-06-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but was otherwise mostly faithful to the mechanics of the original board game.

Later, Domark released another version called ''Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning'', also across multiple formats.&lt;ref name="lemon64new"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lemon64.com/?mainurl=http%3A//www.lemon64.com/games/details.php%3FID%3D3475 |title=Trivial Pursuit: A New Beginning |publisher=Lemon64.com |date=1988 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ysnew"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuitanewbeginning.htm |title=Trivial Pursuits - A New Beginning |publisher=Ysrnry.co.uk |date=January 1989 |first=Phil |last=South |accessdate=2014-07-16 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140619011101/http://ysrnry.co.uk/articles/trivialpursuitanewbeginning.htm |archive-date=2014-06-19 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This version featured a plot about the dying Earth&lt;ref name="incredibly"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://incrediblystrangegames.com/post/1166003331/trivial-pursuit-a-strange-new-beginning |title=Trivial Pursuit: A Strange New Beginning |publisher=Incredibly Strange Games |date=21 September 2010 |accessdate=2014-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; and significantly altered gameplay mechanics.&lt;ref name="ysnew"/&gt;

[[Hasbro Interactive]] released a "Millennium Edition" in 1999 with three different modes, and different categories:
*''Classic Pursuit'': Played just like the board game.  A "QUICKPLAY" option was also available, where, to speed the game up, every question would be a wedge question.  Up to six can play.  The winner is the first one to earn all six wedges, land back in the center hub by exact count, and then give a correct answer.
*''Party Pursuit'': Up to three can play.  The computer randomly spins categories until there are three to choose from.  A correct answer by the first player to buzz in earns the wedge; a wrong answer gives the opposition a chance, as well as take away any wedges earned in a category.  The first player to earn all six wedges wins the game.  After 20 questions, the computer begins selecting categories for the players.
*''Point Pursuit'': Same as ''Party Pursuit,'' except point scores are kept, and questions range from 250 to 1,000 points.  Players can also wager any or all of their scores on one final question.  Bonus points are earned for a wedge and for how much or how little time it took to answer a question.

There are also three different ways to answer the questions:
*Multiple choice, where players choose from numbers 1, 2, 3, or 4;
*Spelling accuracy: loose, where imperfect spelling is accepted by the program;
*Spelling accuracy: strict, where spelling must be precise.

This game featured a total of seven voice-overs, one host, and one for each of the six categories: People &amp; Places (blue wedge), Arts &amp; Entertainment (pink wedge), History (yellow wedge), Science &amp; Nature (brown wedge), Sports &amp; Leisure (green wedge), and Wild Card (orange wedge).

===Online game===
In 2003, Bolenka Games released an online game of ''Trivial Pursuit'' on the now-defunct website Uproar.com&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20031118005445/en/Trivial-Pursuit-Online-Games-Brings-Worlds-Popular|title=Trivial Pursuit Online Games Brings World's Most Popular Trivia Game to Uproar.com|date=November 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.archive.org/web/20040204013755/http://www.uproar.com/promos/trivialpursuit/ Trivial Pursuit on Uproar]&lt;/ref&gt;where it features five editions such as: ''Genius'', ''Silver Screen'', ''Music'', ''1980s'' and ''TV''.

===Video games===
Trivial Pursuit was released for a number of home video systems, including [[Sega CD]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= |first= |title=ProReview: Trivial Pursuit|journal=[[GamePro]]|issue=70 |publisher=[[International Data Group|IDG]]|date=May 1995|page=56}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Wii]], [[Xbox 360]], [[Xbox One]], [[PlayStation 2]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[PlayStation 4]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://ign.com/games/hasbro-game-channel-trivial-pursuit-live/ps4-20022843 Trivial Pursuit Live! on PlayStation 4], ign.com&lt;/ref&gt; The board game was also adapted into a mobile game called ''[[Trivia Crack]]''.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7809">A '''tronie''' (16/17th-century [[Dutch language|Dutch]] for "face") is a common type, or group of types, of works common in [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and [[Flemish Baroque painting]] that shows an exaggerated [[facial expression]] or a [[stock character]] in costume.

==Definition==
[[File:Joos van Craesbeeck - The Smoker.jpg|thumb|right|270px|upright|[[Joos van Craesbeeck]]'s ''The Smoker'', an example of a "tronie"]]
The term 'tronie' is not clearly defined in art historical literature. Literary and archival sources show that initially the term 'tronie' was not always associated with people. Inventories sometimes referred to flower and fruit still lifes as 'tronies'.  More common was the meaning of face or visage. Often the term referred to the entire head, even a bust, and in exceptional cases the whole body. A tronie could be two-dimensional, but also made of plaster or stone. Sometimes a tronie was a likeness, the depiction of an individual, including the face of God, Christ, Mary, a saint or an angel.  In particular a tronie denoted the characteristic appearance of the head of a type, for example a farmer, a beggar or a jester. Tronie sometimes meant so much as a grotesque head or a model such as the type of an ugly old person.  When conceived as the face of an individual and of a type a tronie's aim was to express feelings and character in an accurate manner and must therefore be expressive.&lt;ref name=tronie&gt;[http://www.dbnl.org/tekst/_zev001200101_01/_zev001200101_01_0017.php Jan Muylle, ''Tronies toegeschreven aan Pieter Bruegel''], in: De zeventiende eeuw. Jaargang 17. Uitgeverij Verloren, Hilversum 2001, p. 174-203 {{link language|nl|Middle Dutch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In modern art-historical usage the term tronie is typically restricted to figures not intended to depict an identifiable person, so it is a form of [[genre painting]] in a portrait format.  Typically a painted head or bust only, if concentrating on the facial expression, but often half-length when featured in an exotic costume, tronies might be based on studies from life or use the features of actual sitters.  The picture was typically sold on the art market without identification of the sitter, and was not commissioned and retained by the sitter as [[portrait]]s normally were.  Similar unidentified figures treated as [[history painting]]s would normally be given a title from the classical world, for example the Rembrandt painting now known as ''Saskia as Flora''.

==History==
The genre started in the Low Countries in the 16th century where it was likely inspired by some of the grotesque heads drawn by Leonardo.  Leonardo had pioneered drawings of paired grotesque heads whereby two heads, usually in profile, were placed opposite each other in order to accentuate their diversity.  This paired juxtaposition was also adopted by artists in the Low Countries.  In 1564 or 1565 Joannes and Lucas van Doetecum are believed to have engraved 72 heads attributed to [[Pieter Brueghel the Elder]] that followed this paired arrangement.&lt;ref name=tronie/&gt;

This paired model was still being used by some artists in the 17th century.  For instance, the Flemish artist [[Jan van de Venne]] who was active in the first half of the 17th century painted a number of tronies juxtaposing different faces.

File:Jan van der Venne - Head of an old woman.jpg|Jan van de Venne, ''Head of an old woman''
&lt;/gallery&gt;

Several [[Rembrandt]] [[self-portrait]] [[etching]]s are tronies, as are paintings of himself, his son and his wives. &lt;!--&lt;ref&gt;This is true of modern art-historical terminology; however, historical usage is not so precise. Seventeenth-century Dutch and Flemish inventories of paintings might use the term for any unidentified sitter.&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;  Three [[Vermeer]] paintings were described as "tronies" in the [[Jacob Dissius|Dissius]] auction of 1696, perhaps including the ''[[Girl with a Pearl Earring]]'' and the Washington ''[[:File:Johannes Vermeer - Young Girl with a Flute - WGA24683.jpg|Young Girl with a flute]]''.  [[Frans Hals]] also painted a number of tronies, which are now among his best-known works, including the two tronies known as ''[[Malle Babbe]]'' and the ''[[The Gypsy Girl - Malle Babbe|Gypsy Girl]]'' (see gallery).

[[Adriaen Brouwer]] was one of the most successful practitioners of the genre as he had a talent for expressiveness. His work gave a face to lower-class figures by infusing their images with recognizable and vividly expressed human emotions—anger, joy, pain, and pleasure.   His ''Youth Making a Face'' (c. 1632/1635, [[National Gallery of Art]]) shows a young man with a satirical and mocking gesture which humanises him, however uninviting he may appear. Brouwer's vigorous application of paint in this composition, with his characteristically short, unmodulated brushstrokes, increases the dramatic effect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nga.gov/content/ngaweb/Collection/art-object-page.86204.html Brouwer, Adriaen, ''Youth Making a Face''] at the [[National Gallery of Art]]&lt;/ref&gt;   Genre painters often returned to the old theme of the allegory of the five senses and created series of tronies depicting the five senses. Examples are  [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]]'s ''A man removing a plaster, the sense of touch'' and [[Joos van Craesbeeck]]'s ''The Smoker'' which represents taste.&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.wellcomelibrary.org/record=b1202823 ''A man removing a plaster, the sense of touch'' by [[Lucas Franchoys the Younger]]] at the [[Wellcome Library]], London&lt;/ref&gt;

The tronie is related to, and has some overlap with, the "portrait historié", a portrait of a real person '''as''' another, usually historical or [[mythological]], figure. [[Jan de Bray]] specialised in these, and many portraitists sometimes showed aristocratic ladies in particular as mythological figures.

The '''Vienna School of Art History''' ({{lang-de|Wiener Schule der Kunstgeschichte}}) was the development of fundamental [[art history|art-historical]] methods at the [[University of Vienna]]. This school was not actually a dogmatically unified group, but rather an intellectual evolution extending over a number of generations, in which a series of outstanding scholars each built upon the achievements of their forerunners, while contributing their own unique perspectives. Essential elements of this evolution became fundamental for modern art history, even if the individual methods can today no longer claim absolute validity.

A characteristic trait of the Vienna School was the attempt to put art history on a "scientific" ("wissenschaftlich") basis by distancing art historical judgements from questions of aesthetic preference and taste, and by establishing rigorous concepts of analysis through which all works of art could be understood. Nearly all of the important representatives of the Vienna School  combined academic careers as university teachers with curatorial activity in museums or with the preservation of monuments.

The concept of a Viennese "school" of art history was first employed by the Czech art critic and collector Vincenc Kramář in 1910; it attained general currency following articles published by [[Otto Benesch]] in 1920 and by [[Julius von Schlosser]] in 1934. In the following entry it has only been possible to make cursory mention of the most important representatives of the school.

== History ==

===Pragmatic art history===

[[Rudolf Eitelberger]] is considered to have been the "forefather" of the Vienna School. He acquired a profound knowledge of art through private study during the [[Vormärz]], and in 1852 was appointed as the first professor of art history at the University of Vienna. His greatest concern was to render the aesthetic appreciation of art more objective through giving weight to historical sources and demonstrable facts. He perceived art-historical research as an absolute prerequisite for the elevation of taste and for the improvement of contemporary art. On account of this goal-oriented attitude he became one of the most important protagonists in the historicist movement in Austrian art and architecture.

The first graduate of the Eitelberger's new program in art history was [[Moritz Thausing]], who in 1879 became the second ''Ordinarius'' (full professor) of art history at Vienna. He advanced beyond his teacher's program in his advocacy of an autonomous art history and promoted the separation of art history from [[aesthetics]].

===Formalist art history===

Thausing's students [[Franz Wickhoff]] (Professor 1891) and [[Alois Riegl]] (Professor 1897) furthered his approach, insofar as they developed the methods of comparative stylistic analysis and attempted to avoid all judgements of personal taste. Thus both contributed to the revaluation of the art of [[late antiquity]], which before then had been despised as a period of decline. Riegl in particular, as an avowed disciple of [[positivism]], focused on the purely formal qualities of the work of art, and rejected all arguments about content as metaphysical speculation.

===Idealist art history===

After the early deaths of Riegl and Wickhoff, one of the art-historical positions at the University was filled by [[Max Dvořák]], who at first continued the tradition of his predecessors. However, Dvořák's interest gradually turned towards issues of content; that is, to precisely those issues that, for Riegl, were not the object of art history. Dvořák, in part influenced by the contemporary [[expressionism|expressionist]] movement in German painting, developed a deep appreciation for the unclassical formal qualities of [[Mannerism]]. Dvořák's idealistic method, which would later be termed "''Kunstgeschichte als Geistesgeschichte''" ("art history as intellectual history"), found its most committed champions in [[Hans Tietze]] and [[Otto Benesch]].

===Structuralist art history===

Dvořák also died young, and in 1922 [[Julius von Schlosser]] was appointed as his successor. Schlosser embodied the type of the classical, humanistic scholar, and nourished a deep attachment to the art and culture of Italy throughout his life. He was a close friend of the Italian philosopher [[Benedetto Croce]] and of [[Karl Vossler]], a Munich-based professor of the [[Romance languages]], under whose influence he developed an art-historical method based on philological models. He drew a distinction between the "''Stilgeschichte''" ("style-history") of brilliant artists and their unique creations, and the "''Sprachgeschichte''" ("language-history") of the fine arts, which latter embraced the entire spectrum of artistic creation. Among those to emerge from Schlosser's school, besides [[Ernst Gombrich]], were [[Hans Sedlmayr]] and [[Otto Pächt]], who in the 1930s founded art-historical "structuralism." Their methodology was described by [[Meyer Schapiro]] as the "New Vienna School"; it has also been described as the "Second Vienna School."

===Ideological art history===

[[Josef Strzygowski]], who was appointed in 1909, at the same time as Dvořák, holds a unique position in the history of the Vienna School. He was a vehement opponent of the traditional view of history, in place of which he advocated an anticlassical, antihumanist, and anticlerical outlook. In opposition to the standard view of history, which was centered on ancient Greece and Rome, Strzygowski turned his attention towards the Orient, where he thought he had discovered the traces of an original "Nordic" character, which was superior to the "Mediterranean." As he held such a single-minded point of view, he found himself in irreconcilable opposition to the "orthodox" branch of the Vienna School, in particular to the "arch-humanist" Schlosser, who on his side condemned Strzygowski as the "Attila of art history." The dispute resulted in a complete separation, not only ideological but also physical, so that two art-historical institutes existed within the University without any relationship to each other. As Strzygowski could naturally not allow himself to adopt the methods of his opponents, he devised a tabular method of "''Planforschung''," which was supposed to guarantee absolute objectivity, but in hindsight was completely impracticable and clearly intended to justify his abstruse theories. Strzygowski's worldview developed a markedly bizarre, racist tendency that approached Nazi ideology. However, his institute was closed upon his retirement in 1933. Nevertheless, he is to be credited with the expansion of the boundaries of western art history, which he opened to the consideration of non-European cultures. Moreover, his esteem for abstract art, which he understood as uniquely "Nordic," was a step towards an art-historical confrontation with modernity. With all due care, then, Strzygowski may also find his proper place today in the history of the Vienna School.

===Synthesis===

The era of [[Nazism]] signified a turning point for the Vienna School.&lt;ref&gt;Hans Aurenhammer, "Zäsur oder Kontinuität? Das Wiener Kunsthistorische Institut im Ständestaat und im Nationalsozialismus." In ''Wiener Schule. Erinnerung und Perspektiven'' (''Wiener Jahrbuch für Kunstgeschichte'', 53). Vienna, Cologne and Weimar 2004, pp. 11-54.&lt;/ref&gt; Numerous scholars were forced to emigrate and came into contact with the methdological approaches of other nations, in particular in the Anglo-American world. [[Hans Sedlmayr]], a declared Nazi, led the institute throughout the war, and at war's end his career in Vienna likewise came to an end. In 1946, [[Karl Maria Swoboda]] assumed leadership of the ''Insitut'', where he constructed a synthesis of the previously irreconcilable schools of Schlosser and Strzygowski, now drained of their ideological intransigence. In 1963 two ''Ordinarius'' positions were once more created, and were filled by [[Otto Pächt]] (a student of Schlosser) and [[Otto Demus]] (a student of Strzygowski). Under the "two Ottos" Vienna became a "''Mekka der Mittelalterkunstgeschichte''" ("a mecca for medieval art history"), while also offering excellent coverage of post-medieval art through the appointment of [[Fritz Novotny]]. Today Werner Hoffmann, who developed the traditions of the school and adapted them for an intellectual engagement with contemporary art, may count as the youngest heir of the Vienna School.

'''''Vijenac''''' ([[English language|English]]: ''[[Wreath|The Wreath]]'') is a biweekly magazine for literature, art and science, established in December 1993 and published by ''[[Matica hrvatska]]'', the central national cultural institution in [[Croatia]].

==Historical background==
[[Image:Vienac.jpg|thumb|180px|left|First edition cover page, 1869]]

The magazine is seen as the direct descendant of the ''Vienac'' literary magazine, which gathered the best [[Croatian literature|Croatian writers and poets]] of the second half of the 19th century. It was created in 1869 to "delight and educate" (''zabavi i pouci''). Prominent cultural figures were editors-in-chief. In the first year, the magazine was managed by [[Đuro Deželić]], then by [[Ivan Perkovac]], [[Milivoj Dežman]], [[Franjo Marković]] and [[Vjekoslav Klaić]]. 

''Vienac'' soon became the main Croatian literary magazine of the second half of the 19th century, especially when it was managed by the greatest Croatian writer of the time, [[August Šenoa]], from 1874 until his death in 1881. It is a showcase of the big literary names of the period. For example, [[Ksaver Šandor Gjalski]] published his first short story there in 1884. ''Vijenac'' also published translations of works by [[Émile Zola|Zola]], [[Daudet]] and [[Turgenev]]. From 1890 to 1896, it was edited by [[Josip Pasarić]], a major critic of Croatian [[Realism (arts)|realism]].

Both the content and the illustrations were on the level of the contemporary European literary magazines. ''Vienac'' was the only edition of [[Matica ilirska]] (the [[Illyrian movement|Illyrian]] Matrix) until Matica was restructured in 1874 to become the [[Matica hrvatska]]. After that, Vienac was published by a printing company. It died out in 1903.

==Vijenac today==
After its revival in 1993, ''Vijenac'' soon regained its prestige status as a prominent literary and arts publication. However, in late 1998 a group of top contributors (including the then editor-in-chief, [[Andrea Zlatar]]) left ''Vijenac'' and established ''[[Zarez]]''. ''Vijenac'' continued publishing with a new editorial staff. {{As of|2013}} it had an estimated circulation of 7,000 copies.&lt;ref name="hazu"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5641">'''The Walter Chapin Simpson Center for the Humanities''', located in Seattle, Washington, is one of the largest and most comprehensive [[humanities]] centers in the United States. Housed in the College of Arts and Sciences at the [[University of Washington]] (UW), it offers UW scholars a spectrum of local opportunities for intellectual community and grant support that advances [[crossdisciplinarity]], [[collaboration]], and research while networking them nationally and internationally.

==History==
In 1987, the UW's College of Arts and Sciences established the University of Washington Center for the Humanities with a mandate to support interdisciplinary activities. Ron Moore and [[Leroy Searle]] served as formative leaders of the Center. In 1997, Barclay and Sharon Simpson endowed the Center, which was renamed the Walter Chapin Simpson Center for the Humanities, in tribute to Barclay Simpson's father, a lifelong supporter of humanistic education. [[Kathleen Woodward]] was named Director of the Center in 2000; she continues to lead it today.[http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/about/history]

==Programs and Initiatives==
===Collaboration and Crossdisciplinarity===
All Center programs are grounded in [[collaboration]] and [[crossdisciplinarity]]. The Center provides funding and support for fellowship programs, research clusters, graduate student interest groups, conferences, and symposia, allowing faculty and graduate students to exchange ideas and develop individual and collaborative projects together with other faculty, students, visiting scholars, and community practitioners.

Between 2000 and 2013, the Simpson Center funded 126 faculty fellowships and 51 dissertation fellowships supporting scholars from 30 campus units across the humanities, arts, social sciences, and professional schools.

The Center also supports large-scale projects funded by major foundations and agencies. Recent examples include the American Music Partnership with [[KEXP-FM]] of Seattle ([[Paul G. Allen Family Foundation]], 2009–2011), the Sawyer Seminar on Now Urbanism ([[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]], 2010–2012), and Biological Futures in a Globalized World ([[Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center]], 2011–2012).

===Public Scholarship===
The Simpson Center has gained national recognition for its work advancing scholarship as a publicly engaged practice, a field often referred to as the [[public humanities]]. Undertaken with and for diverse communities, public scholarship promotes mutually-beneficial partnerships between higher education and organizations in the public and private sectors.

The Certificate in Public Scholarship is a portfolio- and project-based program that enables graduate students and faculty mentors to integrate their scholarly, social, and political commitments in the context of their intellectual and professional development.[http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/programs/curriculum/certificate-in-public-scholarship]

Center grants support humanities-based research, teaching, and engagement projects that encourage dialogue, exchange, and collaboration among UW scholars and community members.

The Center hosts the Solomon Katz Distinguished Lectures in the Humanities, which feature leading thinkers such as [[Dipesh Chakrabarty]], [[Robin D. G. Kelley]], [[Wendy Brown (political scientist)|Wendy Brown]], [[Anne Balsamo]], and [[Cathy Davidson]] in events that are free and open to the public.

===Digital Humanities===
In 2008, the Simpson Center received a $625,000 Challenge Grant by the [[National Endowment for the Humanities]] (NEH), an endorsement for its plans to raise funds to establish the Digital Humanities Commons, a fellowship program that will support inventive and experimental research inspired by new and emerging technologies in the [[digital humanities]]. In 2010, the [[Andrew W. Mellon Foundation]] gave $600,000 to underwrite the Digital Humanities Commons fund-raising efforts.[http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/programs/initiatives/digital-humanities-commons] The fundraising goal was met in February 2013,[http://depts.washington.edu/uwch/news/2013/02/simpson-center-meets-digital-humanities-fundraising-goal] and  beginning Summer 2014, the Simpson Center Digital Humanities Commons will enable UW faculty and graduate students to collaborate with librarians, engineers, and designers in the development, innovation, and exchange of digital research and scholarship.

Simpson Center Initiatives, such as the 2011 Digital Research Summer Institute and the Puget Sounds archives for rare performances of Northwest popular music, are helping to build campus communities of scholarly digital practice.

==Affiliations==
The Simpson Center maintains affiliations with national and international scholarly organizations, such as the [[Consortium of Humanities Centers and Institutes]]; [[HASTAC]] (Humanities, Arts, Science, Technology Advanced Collaboratory); Imagining America: Artists and Scholars in Public Life; the National Humanities Alliance; and the Western Humanities Alliance.

'''Yaqut al-Musta'simi''' (also '''Yakut-i Musta'simi''') (died 1298&lt;ref name="efendi"/&gt;) was a well-known [[Calligraphy|calligrapher]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dankoff|first=Robert|title=An Ottoman mentality: the world of Evliya Çelebi|year=2004|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-13715-8|pages=42|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6ZRx2UZOtFkC&amp;pg=PA42}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Çelebi|first=Evli̇ya|title=Evliya Çelebi in Bitlis: the relevant section of the Seyahatname|year=2006|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-09242-6|pages=285|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6LNlZuhunSIC&amp;pg=PA285|author2=Robert Dankoff |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and secretary of the last [[Abbasid Caliphate|Abbasid caliph]]. 

==Life and work==
Born Abu’l-Majd Jamal al-Din Yaqut, he became known as Yaqut al-Musta‘simi because he served [[Al-Musta'sim|Caliph al-Musta‘sim]], the last Abassid caliph. He was probably of [[Greek people|Greek]] origin in [[Amaseia]] and carried off when he was very young.&lt;ref name="Houtsma 1987"&gt;{{cite book |title=E.J. Brill's First Encyclopaedia of Islam 1913-1936, Volume 1 |last= Houtsma |first= M. Th |year=1987 |publisher= BRILL|isbn=9789004082656 |quote= YAKUT al-MUSTA'SIMI, Djamal al-DIn Auu 'l-Madjd ... some say he was a Greek from Amasia; he was probably carried off on a razzia while still very young. He was a eunuch. |page=1154 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was a slave in the court of Al-Musta'sim and went on to become a calligrapher in the Royal Court. He spent most of his life in Baghdad and converted to Islam. &lt;ref&gt;Osborn, J.T., ''Letters of Light: Arabic Script in Calligraphy, Print, and Digital Design'', Harvard University Press, 2017, [E-book edition], n.p.&lt;/ref&gt; He studied with the female scholar and calligrapher, Shuhda Bint Al-‘Ibari, who was herself a student in the direct line of [[Ibn al-Bawwab]].&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, G., ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World'',  Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 268; Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture'', Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; During the Mongol invasion of Baghdad (1258), he took refuge in the minaret of a mosque so he could finish his calligraphy practice, while the city was being ransacked. His career, however, flourished under Mongol patronage.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture'', Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 442; "Yaqut al-Musta'simi" [Biography], ''Islamic Arts'',  [http://islamic-arts.org/2011/yaqut-al-musta%E2%80%98simi/ Islamic Arts Online (in English):]&lt;/ref&gt; 

He refined and codified six basic calligraphic styles of the [[Arabic script]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sözen|first=Metin|title=The evolution of Turkish art and architecture|year=1987|publisher=Haşet Kitabevi|author2=İlhan Akşit}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Naskh (script)|Naskh script]] was said to have been revealed and taught to the scribe in a vision. He improved on [[Ibn Muqla]]'s style by replacing the straight cut reed pen with an oblique cut, which resulted in a more elegant script.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture'', Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 442;  Sajoo, A.B., ''A Companion to Muslim Cultures'', I.B.Tauris, 2011, p. 148&lt;/ref&gt; He developed ''Yakuti'', a handwriting named after him, described as a [[thuluth]] of "a particularly elegant and beautiful type."&lt;ref name="efendi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Efendi|first=Cafer|title=Risāle-i miʻmāriyye: an early-seventeenth-century Ottoman treatise on architecture: facsimile with translation and notes|year=1987|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-90-04-07846-8|pages=36|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dJk3AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA36|author2=Howard Crane |accessdate=26 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He taught many students, both Arab and non-Arab. His most celebrated students are Ahmad b. al-Suhrawardi and Yahya al-Sufi.&lt;ref&gt;Sajoo, A.B., ''A Companion to Muslim Cultures'', I.B.Tauris, 2011, p. 148; Bloom, J. and Blair, S.S., ''Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art &amp; Architecture'', Vol. 1, Oxford University Press, 2009, p. 442&lt;/ref&gt; 

He became a much-celebrated calligrapher across the Arab-speaking world. His school became the model followed by Persian and Ottoman calligraphers for centuries. In the second half of the 13th-century, he gained the honorific, ''quiblat al-kuttab'' [cynosure of the calligraphers]. &lt;ref&gt;Türk ve İslâm Eserleri Müzesi, ''The Art of the Qurʼan: Treasures from the Museum of Turkish and Islamic Arts'', Smithsonian Institution, 2016, p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

His output was prolific. Although, he is said to have copied the [[Qur'an]] more than a thousand times,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Knappert|first=Jan|title=Swahili culture, Book 2|year=2005|publisher=E. Mellen Press|isbn=978-0-7734-6109-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; problems with attributing his work, may have contributed to exaggerated estimates.&lt;ref&gt;Mansour, N., ''Sacred Script: Muhaqqaq in Islamic Calligraphy'', I.B. Tauris, 2011,  p. 88n&lt;/ref&gt; Other sources suggest that he produced 364 copies of the Q'ran.&lt;ref&gt;''Islamic Arts'',  [http://islamic-arts.org/2011/yaqut-al-musta%E2%80%98simi/ Islamic Arts Online (in English):]&lt;/ref&gt; He was the last of the great medieval calligraphers.&lt;ref&gt;Robinson, G., ''The Cambridge Illustrated History of the Islamic World'',  Cambridge University Press, 1996, p. 268&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yıldız Palace''' ({{lang-tr|Yıldız Sarayı}}, {{IPA-tr|jɯɫˈdɯz saɾaˈjɯ|IPA}}) is a vast complex of former imperial [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] pavilions and villas in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]], built in the 19th and early 20th centuries. It was used as a residence by the [[Sultan of Turkey|Sultan]] and his court in the late 19th century.

== Origin ==
Yıldız Palace, meaning "Star Palace", was built in 1880 and was used by the Ottoman Empire Ottoman Sultan Abdülhamid II.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.dailysabah.com/feature/2015/03/14/the-luxurious-palaces-of-the-ottoman-empire|title=The luxurious palaces of the Ottoman Empire|work=DailySabah|access-date=2018-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; The area of the palace was originally made of natural woodlands and became an imperial estate during the reign of Sultan Ahmed I (1603-1617). Various sultans after Ahmed I enjoyed vacationing on these lands and Sultans Abdülmecid I and Abdülaziz built mansions here.

In the late 19th century, Sultan Abdülhamid II left [[Dolmabahçe Palace]] because he feared a seaside attack on the palace, which is located at the shore of the Bosporus strait. He expanded the Yıldız Palace and ordered the renowned Italian architect [[Raimondo D'Aronco]] to build new buildings to the palace complex. When he moved there, the palace became the fourth seat of Ottoman government (the previous ones were the ''Eski Saray'' Old Palace in Edirne, and the [[Topkapı Palace]] and Dolmabahçe Palaces in Istanbul.

== Layout ==
The palace is a complex of buildings including the State Apartments Büyük Mabeyn, Şale Pavilion, the Malta Pavilion, the Çadır Pavilion, the Yıldız Theater and Opera House, the Yıldız Palace Museum, and the Imperial Porcelain Factory. The Yıldız Palace Gardens are also a popular public site among the residents of Istanbul. A bridge connects the Yıldız Palace with the Çırağan Palace on the Bosporus through this garden.

=== State apartments ===
Government officials working for Abdülhamid II had their offices in this building.

=== Şale Kiosk ===
[[Image:Sale Pavilion 01.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Şale Kiosk&lt;/center&gt;]]

The sultan’s residence was in the Şale Kiosk or pavilion. The building has two floors and a basement and constructed from a mix of wood and stone. It was constructed in three phases. The first part was built in the 1870s and was designed to resemble a Swiss chalet, hence the name ''Şale''. Winston Churchill and Charles de Gaulle were among the visitors to this part of the palace. The second section was added in 1889 to accommodate Kaiser Wilhelm II, who was the first foreign monarch to visit Constantinople. It was during this phase that the Sedefli Salon Mother-of-Pearl Salon was added. The name derives from the extensive use of mother-of-pearl that covered almost all of its surfaces. There are also detailed painted landscapes on the ceiling. The third section was also built for Kaiser Wilhelm II in 1898. The reception chamber was built during this period and remains the most impressive room in the entire Şale Pavilion. There is a single carpet on the floor that has an area greater than 400 square meters and was hand woven by 60 weavers. Elegant features of the chamber include a gilded, coffered ceiling and large mirrors. Abdülhamid II was a skilled carpenter and actually made some of the pieces of furniture that can be found in the Şale Pavilion.

=== Malta Kiosk ===
[[Image:Malta Kiosk March 2008e.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Malta Kiosk&lt;/center&gt;]]

The Malta Kiosk is a pavilion located in Yıldız Park to the north side of the wall separating Yıldız Palace. There are also two watching and resting pavilions in the grove being the rear garden of Çırağan Palace from the Abdül Aziz I period. The origin of the name is not certain: during the Ottoman era certain parts of palaces were called after the names of conquered places or important battles, so this name is given after the Siege of Malta 1565 siege of Malta.

The trial of Midhat Pasha took place in a tent behind the pavilion.

=== Çadır Kiosk ===
[[Image:Cadir Kiosk March 2008b.JPG|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Çadır Kiosk&lt;/center&gt;]]

It was built by Sultan [[Abdülaziz]] (1861–76), who used them as prisons. Today it houses a café and restaurant.

=== Yıldız Theater and Opera House ===
Built by Sultan [[Abdülhamid II]] in 1889, it has stars on its domed ceiling, a reference to the name of the Yıldız Palace, which means Star Palace. Because no one was allowed to have his back to the sultan, the positioning of the sultan’s balcony box meant that the first row seats were never used.

=== Yıldız Palace Museum ===
This used to be Abdülhamid II’s carpentry workshop and is now used to display art and objects from the palace.

=== Imperial Porcelain Factory ===
[[Image:Yildiz Porcelain Factory 01.jpg|thumb|&lt;center&gt;Yıldız Porcelain Factory&lt;/center&gt;]]

Opened in 1895, the factory was constructed to meet the demand of the upper classes for European-style ceramics. The bowls, vases and plates it produced often pictured idealized scenes of the Bosphorus. The building has an interesting appearance in that it resembles a European medieval castle.

== Present use ==
After the Ottoman Empire ended, the palace was used as a luxury casino before being converted into a guest house for visiting heads of state and royalty. Today it is a museum and its gardens can be used for private receptions, such as the Istanbul Antiques Fair at the Silahhane (Armoury) Hall, which usually takes place in November. The Istanbul office of the [[OIC]] is also located within the Yıldız Palace.

In Our days, in the museum are organized ceramic or porcelain art exhibitions as Yildiz İbram's 'Ottoman Caftans' ceramic exhibition  organized between 1 November-1 December 2013 under the auspices of the 135 years of diplomatic relations between Romania and Turkey, creating a nice ambiance in a unique atmosphere and compatibility regarding the historical past of the palace.

The palace is in the [[Beşiktaş]] district of Istanbul and is open daily from 9:30 to 16:00, except on Mondays and Thursdays, from October to February; and between 9:30 to 17:00 from March to September.

The '''Zamorano Eighty''' is a list of books intended to represent the most significant early volumes published on the [[History of California|history]] of [[California]].  It was compiled in 1945 by members of the Zamorano Club, a [[Los Angeles]]-based group of [[bibliophile]]s.  Collecting [[first edition]]s of every volume on the list has become the goal of a number of book collectors, though to date only four people have completed the task.&lt;ref name="volkmann"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.sfgate.com/bayarea/article/Dan-Volkmann-collector-of-rare-books-dies-3162597.php | title=Dan Volkmann, collector of rare books, dies | publisher=[[Hearst Corporation]] | work=[[San Francisco Chronicle]] | date=May 7, 2009 | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Tucker, Jill}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zamorano Club was founded in 1928 and named for [[Agustín Vicente Zamorano]], the first [[Printer (publisher)|printer]] in California.&lt;ref name="zhistory"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zamoranoclubla.org/history/ | title=History of the Zamorano Club | publisher=The Zamorano Club | accessdate=June 3, 2013 | author=Nunis, Doyce B., Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Madness"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3Z-KL2voBoUC | title=A Gentle Madness: Bibliophiles, Bibliomanes, and the Eternal Passion for Books | publisher=Henry Holt and Company | author=Basbanes, Nicholas A. | authorlink=Nicholas A.

During this process, Cowan died, and his ''Bibliography of the History of California and the Pacific West'' was added to the list as a tribute.&lt;ref name="z80"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.zamoranoclubla.org/zam80/ | title=The Zamorano 80 | publisher=The Zamorano Club | accessdate=June 4, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The list contains significant works by a number of well-known authors like [[Mark Twain]], [[John Muir]], [[Bret Harte]], and [[Robert Louis Stevenson]], as well as obscure texts concerning geographical exploration and legal matters.  Some of the works exist in very few, highly sought after copies, while others were quite common and not particularly valuable, until interest in the list caused their prices to rise.&lt;ref name="Water2010"&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pIuC3A4_v_UC | title=The Zamorano 80 Revisited: A Collector's Update of a Classic Work | publisher=Xlibris Corporation | date=April 16, 2010 | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Gordon J. Water | page=xi | isbn=978-1-4628-1868-6}}{{Self-published inline|certain=yes|date=January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Book dealers often refer to items for sale using their "Zamorano number" or have special sections dedicated to items on the list.

Thomas Streeter was the first collector to assemble a complete collection of first editions of every item on the list.  His collection was auctioned between 1966 and 1969.&lt;ref name="z80"/&gt;  Businessman Frederick William Beinecke was the second.  Retired investment counselor Henry H. Clifford completed his collection in 1988 and his collection was auctioned in 1995.  The fourth was architect Daniel Volkmann, who completed his collection in 1994, and it was auctioned in 2003.&lt;ref name=volkmann /&gt;&lt;ref name="z80"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clifford /&gt;  Many other collectors have pursued this goal, including notorious [[bibliomane]] and book thief [[Stephen Blumberg]].&lt;ref name=Madness /&gt;

Only one institution, the [[Beinecke Rare Book and Manuscript Library]] at [[Yale University]], possesses a complete collection of the Zamorano 80, donated by Frederick W. Beinecke.  Both the [[Bancroft Library]] at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and the [[Huntington Library]] in [[San Marino, California]] possess all but one of the volumes.&lt;ref name="Sloan"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dsloan.com/Auctions/A12/DSIntro.htm | title=The Zamorano 80 | publisher=Dorothy Sloan Books | accessdate=May 30, 2013 | author=Sloan, Dorothy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rarest book on the list is number 64, the [[dime novel]] ''[[The Life and Adventures of Joaquín Murieta]]'' by [[John Rollin Ridge]] writing as "Yellow Bird".  Only two first-edition copies are known to exist, each used twice to complete the list.&lt;ref name=sloanJM /&gt;  It may be on the list only because Wagner owned a copy, which he sold to Streeter.  When Streeter's collection was being periodically auctioned, the auction of this copy was moved up over a year so the elderly Beinecke would be able to complete his Zamorano collection.  This copy is now in the Beinecke Library with the rest of Beinecke's Zamorano books.&lt;ref name="sloanJM"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dsloan.com/Auctions/A12/64WebA12.htm | title=Auction 12: The Zamorano 80 Collection of Daniel G.

Blumberg wanted it so much he and his accomplices planned and researched a potential burglary of Clifford's house when that collector owned the book.&lt;ref name=Madness /&gt;
